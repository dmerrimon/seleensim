Protocol Summary  
Title of Study:  The RhinAer® Procedure for Treatment of CHronic Rh Initis - A 
Prospective, Multice Nter Randomized ConT rolled T Rial Comparing 
RhinA er to Sham C ontrol (RHINTRAC)  
Purpose:  The purpose of this study is to compare the RhinAer procedure to treat 
tissue in the posterior nasal nerve area to improve symptoms in adults 
diagnosed with chronic rhinitis  with a sham procedure that duplicates 
the actual procedure as closely as possible absent the delivery of 
radiofrequency (RF) energy to the nasal tissue. 
Indications for 
Use:  The RhinAer  Stylus is indicated for use in otorhinolaryngology (ENT) 
surgery for the destruction of soft tissue in the nasal airway, including in posterior nasal nerve regions in patients with chronic rhinitis.   
The Aerin Console is an electrosurgical system intende d to generate 
radiofrequency electrical current for the use of an Aerin Medical Stylus.  
The Aerin Console is indicated for use in small clinic, office,  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143077]. 
RhinAer 
Treatment:  The RhinAer procedure will be performed in the study clin ic using the 
RhinAer Stylus and Aerin Console. The RhinAer Stylus is a disposable handheld device capable of delivering bipolar radiofrequency energy to tissue when connected to the Aerin Console radiofrequency generating device. Participants will have the  
portion of the nasal cavity mucosa 
overlying the region of the posterior nasal nerve (the posterior middle meatus and posterior inferior turbinate) in both nostrils treated during a 
single study procedure session. Each nostril will be treated at 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 
nonoverlappi[INVESTIGATOR_836755]. Treatment settings to be used are temperature 60  °C, 
power 4 watts, treatment time 12 seconds, and cooling time 0 seconds. 
Control 
Treatment:  The control treatment will be  performed in the study clinic using the 
RhinAer Stylus while  audible sounds that accurately simulate the Aerin 
Console's active treatment are produced even though RF energy is not being 
generated or delivered . All other aspects of the procedure will be the same 
as used for the active treatment, including administration of anesthetic agent(s).  
Study Design:  The study is designed as a multicenter (up to 20 sites), prospective, 
randomized, controlled superiority trial with a one -way crossover 
component available to participants randomized to the control 
procedure. A 2:1 site-stratified randomization will be used to allocate 
participants to either the RhinAer procedure  or  treatment with the sham 
(control) procedure to provide  up to 120 total participants  in the 
following groups: 
  CTP1004 Rev E

• 80 active treatment receiving the RhinAer procedure  
• 40 inactive treatment receiving the sham procedure 
All participants will be evaluated prior to  treatment and following 
treatment at week 4 (1 month)  and week 13 (3 months) . The [ADDRESS_1161656] an extended follow -up phase with evaluations 
conducted at 6 months (26 weeks), 12 months (52 week s) and 24 months 
(104 week s) to provide additional information on longer -term efficacy 
and duration of treatment effect. 
Participants receiving the sham procedure may elect to crossover and 
receive the active RhinAer procedure within [ADDRESS_1161657] to  exit from the study 
following the 3- or 6 -month evaluation. 
Study 
Objective:  The primary objective is to assess the performance of the RhinAer 
procedure compared to a sham procedure with respect to individual 
participant success rates when used as a treatment for chronic rhinitis. A secondary objective is evaluation of treatment effect duration through an extended follow-up to 2 years . 
Individual participant success (responder) is defined as at least 30% 
improvement (decrease) in the 24-hour reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS).  
Primary Study 
Hypothesis: The proportion of participants receiving the RhinAer procedure with a 
successful outcome (responders) will exceed the proportion of 
participants receiving the  sham procedure with a successful outcome 
(responders) at 3 months posttreatment.  
Primary 
Endpoint:  The primary endpoint is the responder rate at 3 months after the 
procedure for the randomized participants.  
Secondary 
Endpoints:  • Mean change in rTNSS from baseline to 3 months after the 
procedure.  
• Frequency of device -related and procedure -related serious adverse 
events through the 3-month evaluation.

1.0 Introduction and Background  
Rhinitis is a condition in which the membrane lining the nasal cavity becomes irritated 
and swollen. Patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_143082], runny nose, 
sneezing, nasal itching, irritated throat, and postnasal discharge. The 2 major 
class ifications of rhinitis are allergic rhinitis (AR) and nonallergic rhinitis (NAR). AR  
may be caused by [CONTACT_143105], pet dander, mold or dust . NAR may result 
from trigge rs that include chemicals, irritants, and medications.[ADDRESS_1161663] a patient’s quality of life by [CONTACT_143106], 
headache, and sleep disturbance, resulting in cognitive impairment and diminished productivity and thereby [CONTACT_143107] a personal and financial burden.
[ADDRESS_1161664] or foreign substances that enter the nasal passage. Mucus is  cleared by 
[CONTACT_143108].
4 Regulation of the seromucous 
glands and mucosal blood supply occurs through parasympathetic and adrenergic 
stimulation via the vidian nerve, posterior nasal nerves and other nerves. In some situations, the mucosa may become hyperresponsive to stimuli and produce excess mucu s, resulting in rhinorrhea or postnasal discharge. 
Patients presenting with runny or congested nose, watery eyes, irritated throat and/or sneezing symptoms are evaluated to understand the types of triggers that may prompt the symptoms experienced. Understa nding the patient’s r espi[INVESTIGATOR_836757].
2,5,[ADDRESS_1161665] common methods to determine allergy sensitivity are percutaneous skin testing and the allergen -specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody testing. These tests can 
identify allergens  the patient should avoid. However, if an allergic cause is eliminated 
through this testing, a diagnosis of nonallergic rhinitis could be made.
1,2 
Treatment to reduce symptoms may include nasal irrigation (nasal lavage) multiple times a day with a saline rinse, use of over -the-counter oral or nas al antihistamines 
and/or corticosteroid sprays, and allergen immunotherapy in AR  patients. Patients with 
nonallergic rhinitis are less likely to respond to oral antihistamines, but may find their symptoms relieved with intranasal antihistamine, corticoster oid or anticholinergic 
sprays. Patients whose symptoms are not adequately relieved with conservative treatment often  seek treatment  to alleviate symptoms and may be candidates for nasal

surgery. Vidian neurectomy is a surgical option to relieve chronic rhi nitis symptoms as 
the vidian nerve supplies autonomic input to the nasal mucosa (as well as the palate 
and the lacrimal gland). While this surgery has been performed for over 50 years, it is 
controversial since access to the nerve can be  technically difficult and complications 
with numerous surrounding important structure s can occur.7,8 Common procedural side 
effects include dry eyes, nasal dryness or crusting and mild pain. M ore significant risks 
may include hemorrhage, vision loss and palate/lip/cheek numbness. In addition, improvement in symptoms is often unpredictabl e.
7 An alternative neurectomy target is 
the posterior nasal nerve (PNN). The advantage of the PNN over the vidian nerve is its more limited innervation and activity on the nasal mucosa and its physical distance 
from other major nerve structures. As a result, complications associated with PNN 
surgery are less significant and occur less frequently than those described for vidian 
neurectomy,
7 while still providing significant improvement in quality of life.9 A recent 
development is use of a cryosurgical probe to ablate PNN tissue.10 Significant 
impr ovement from baseline in Total Nasal Symptom S core (TNSS) using this 
cryosurgical probe was observed.  
Radiofrequency (RF) energy has been used for decades in the fields of 
otorhinolaryngology, neurosurgery, cardiology, urology and general surgery. ENT surgeons currently use radiofrequency energy in numerous nasal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including
 
radiofrequency turbinate reduction (RFTR), which is a minimally invasive surgical option that can reduce tissue volume in a precise, targeted manner. There have been multip le studies analyzing the safety and outcomes of using radiofrequency energy in 
the RFTR  procedure.
[ADDRESS_1161666] also demonstrated that radiofrequency tissue therapy in the nasal passage can be safe and effective in improving nasal obstruction and in preserving nasal function.
12 
Aerin Medical’s radiofrequency system using the Vivaer® ARC Stylus has been 
investigated and shown effective in treatment of nasal airway obstruction.13 
Aerin Medical previous ly conducted a small feasibility study (TP220) using the Aerin 
Medical radiofrequency system to treat subjects with chronic rhinitis. The InSeca® 
Stylus was used to apply radiofrequency energy to the inferior turbinate  in the PNN 
area. At [ADDRESS_1161667]  procedure, 73% of subjects showed improvement in their Sino-
Nasal Outcomes (SNOT -22) score. There were no device -related or procedure- related 
serious adverse events.  
The feasibility study was followed by a prospective, nonrandomized multicenter study 
(TP668) with 50 participants that supported regulatory clearance of the RhinAer Stylus  
for treating rhinitis by [CONTACT_836769].
 The mean reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score 
(rTNSS) at baseline was 8.5 (SD 1.8) and improved to 3.4 (SD 2.3) at the 12- week 
primary endpoint ( 5.1-point or 59.2% improvement). The responder rate for at least a 
1-point improvement in rTNSS at 12 weeks was 94%. Responder rates based on at least 
2-, 3- (~30%), and 4-point improvements in rTNSS were 92%, 88%, and 69%. Patient  
reported satisfaction with the procedure and quality of life improvement were high. No serious adverse events related to the device were observed and the limited number of adverse ev ents possibly associated with the procedure or device were relatively mild,

The current study is proposed to provide additional evidence for the effectiveness of 
the RF procedure when compared to a sham procedure through a randomized clinical trial. 
2.0 Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to compare the RhinAer  procedure to treat tissue in the 
posterior nasal nerve area to improve symptoms in adults diagnosed with chronic rhinitis  with a sham procedure that duplicates the actual procedure as closely as 
possible absent the delivery of radiofrequency energy to the nasal . 
2.1 Device and Regulatory Status 
The RhinAer  procedure will be performed in the study clinic  using the RhinAer  
Stylus and Aerin Console . The RhinAer  Stylus is a disposable handheld device 
capable of delivering bipolar radiofrequency energy to tissue when connected to the Aerin Console radiofrequency generating device. 
The RhinAer  Stylus was cleared for use in the [LOCATION_003] by [CONTACT_93364] 510(k) 
K192471 and the Aerin Console was cleared under 510(k) K162810. 
2.2 Indications for Use  
The RhinAer  Stylus is indicated for use in otorhinolaryngology (ENT) surgery for 
the destruction of soft tissue in the nasal airway, including in posterior nasal nerve 
regions in patients with chronic rhinitis. The Aerin Console is an electrosurgical system intended to generate radiofrequency

of effectiveness , discomfort, and potential complications . There remains a significant 
need for a simple, safe, nonsurgical, minimally invasive treatment that can provide sustained relief for patients suffering with symptoms of chronic rhinitis . The RhinAer  
procedure using RF technology has been shown to be safe, effective and durable in a single- arm trial comparing pretreatment condition with posttreatment condition. This 
study is being undertaken to provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of the procedure using the randomized, controlled trial, “gold standard” study design.

4.0 Study  Plan  
4.1 Study Design  
The study is designed as a m ulticenter  (up to 20  sites) , prospective, randomized, 
controlled superiority trial with a one -way crossover component available to 
participants randomized to the control procedure  A 2:1 site -stratified randomization 
will be used to allocate participants with chronic rhinitis to either the RhinAer procedure or  treatment with the sham (control) procedure to provide up to 120 total participants: 
• 80 active treatment ( RhinAer  procedure) 
• 40 sham treatment control.  
All participant s will be evaluated prior to treatment and following treatment at week 
4 (1 month) and week 13 (3 months). The 3- month evaluation will be used for the 
primary endpoint analysis.

months (26 weeks), 12 months (52 week s) and 24 months (104 week s) to provide 
additional information on longer- term efficacy and duration of treatment effect.  
The study will have an additional evaluation at [ADDRESS_1161675] 6 months. Patients with sympto ms due only 
to seasonal allergies are to be excluded. This study requires significant symptoms 
demonstrated by a n rTNSS ≥  6, which includes moderate to severe symptoms of 
rhinorrhea and mild to severe symptoms of nasal congestion. 
Patients who have anatomic obstructions that may limit access to the target treatment 
area or have altered posterior nasal anatomy due to prior surgery or injury are excluded from participation. 
Patients  must meet all  inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below for participation 
in the study. 
4.2.1 Inclusion Criteria  
1. Age 18 to 85 years (inclusively). 
2. Willing and able to provide informed consent. 3. Willing and able to comply with the participant -specific requirements

4.4 Blinding  
It will not be possible to blind the investigator administering the treatment because of obvious differences in the actual application of the RF energy versus the sham control. However, every effort should be made to keep the participant blinded as to the treatment received. Steps to help maintain blinding include: 
• Following the same preparation procedures for all cases, including administration of anesthetics (topi[INVESTIGATOR_836760]) . 
• Application of the RhinAer  Stylus in the same manner (pressure, locations, 
timing) for both the active and sham procedures. 
  CTP1004 Rev E 
Clinical Study Protocol - R HINTRAC    
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
 20 of 57  
• Simulation of RF energy being applied by [CONTACT_836770]. 
• Use of a blinded evaluator  (nontreating physician) to conduct  the follow- up visit  
nasal assessment  when feasible; however , this is not required . Medical personnel 
who are unaware of the treatment received are also preferred for  overseeing and 
coordinating the collection of the participant reported outcome measures during the follow- up evaluations. At a minimum, the treating physician should not be 
present when the participant reported outcomes are being collected. Site training will include the importance of maintaining the blinded nature of the study and caution against inadvertent revelation of the treatment assignment  by [CONTACT_25617]. 
4.5 Outcome Measures  
4.5.1 Nasal Assessment  
The target posterior nasal nerve  area within each nostril will be visually 
assessed at baseline (pretre atment), immediately following the treatment 
procedure , and at the 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month evaluations . The use of 
an endoscope for visual assessment is required. Observations are categorized as 
not present, mild, moderate, or severe. R epresentative still photographs or video 
of each nostril will be captured at each visit.  
Assessments include:  
• Significant dry eye (yes/no) 
• Bruising around orbital area 
• Soreness, pain 
• Numbness 
Endoscope required : 
• Inflammation / generalized redness  
• Swelling, edema  
• Bleeding at anesthetic injection site (not requiring physician intervention) 
• Bleeding at treatment site (not requiring physician intervention) 
• Nasal obstruction from tissue edema 
• Disruption of mucosal flow / crusting. 
4.5.2 Pain – Visual A nalog Scale Pain Score 
A horizontal 100 mm VAS
14 anchored on the left with the words “No Pain” and 
on the right with the words “Worst Pain Imaginable ”, will be used to measure 
nasal pain associated with the procedure.  Scores are obtained by [CONTACT_836771]1004 Rev E

distance in millimeters from the left origin of the line (0) to the point indicated 
with a slash placed by [CONTACT_836772]. 
4.5.3 Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) 
The TNSS is an instrument used to collect patient self -rated severity of nasal 
symptoms originally comprised of  3 symptoms (nasal obstruction, 
itching/sneezing and secretion/runny nose)15 that has been widely adapted to 
include 4 nasal symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and 
sneezing . The FDA cites this as a preferred measure of efficacy in trials of drug 
treatments for allergic rhinitis16 and nonallergic rhinitis.17 The TNSS requires 
the patient  to rate 4 nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching 
and sneezing) on the following 4- point scale:  
• 0 = absent symptoms (no sign/symptom is evident) 
• 1 = mild symptom s (sign/symptom present, but minimal awareness; 
easily tolerated)  
• 2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness of sign/s ymptom that is 
bothersome but tolerable) 
• 3 = severe symptoms (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]).  
The total score is the sum of the [ADDRESS_1161679] severe symptoms. 
The minimal  clinically important difference (MCID) for change in mean TNSS 
derived from anchor -based methodologies has been shown to be 0.23 - 0.28 
units and by [CONTACT_143116] -based methodology the MCID was determined to be  
0.59 units.
18 A less rigorous expert panel -based estimate of the MCID was 30% 
of the maximum score of 12, which is 3.[ADDRESS_1161680] been recommended to supersede the panel -based 
method.20,21 
The 24-hour reflective TNSS (rTNSS) will be used in this study. Participants 
will be asked to self -evaluate their symptom severity over the preceding 24 
hours.  
Treatment Responder based on rTNSS improvement 
Individual participant success (responder) is defined as at least 30% improvement (decrease) in the rTNSS from baseline. 
4.5.4 Other R hinitis S ymptoms - Cough and Postnasal D rip 
Self-reported assessment of current problems with cough and postnasal drip or 
excess mucous in the throat rated on the same 4 -point scale used for symptoms

4.5.5 Mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire ( Mini RQLQ ) 
The RQLQ is a well -established, validated, and the most frequently used 
rhinoconjuctivitis disease -specific instrument .
22 The original RQLQ consisted 
of 28 questions across 7 domains and included ratings of 3 activities selected 
by [CONTACT_102].23 The validated standardized version (RQLQ(S)) uses 
standardized activity questions, which facilitates ease of administration .24 The 
MiniRQLQ, to be used in this study, was developed and validated to further facilitate ease of use and efficiency  by [CONTACT_143117] 14.
25 
The RQLQ(S) and the Mini RQLQ were found to be the best tests with optimal 
discriminant validity and  responsiveness for measurement of health -related 
quality of life in AR patients .[ADDRESS_1161681] occurred in AR patients, the MiniRQLQ has also been validated for NAR patients.
27 
The instrument consists of 14 questions across 5 domains ( activity limitations 
(n=3), practical prob lems (n=2), nose symptoms (n=3), eye symptoms  (n=3), 
and other symptoms (n=3)) . Responses are based on a 1- week recall and 
provided on a 7 -point scale: 
• 0 = not troubled 
• 1 = hardly troubled at all 
• 2 = somewhat troubled 
• 3 = moderately troubled 
• 4 = quite a bit troubled 
• 5 = very troubled 
• 6 = extremely troubled. 
The total or overall Mini RQLQ score is the mean of the 14 responses and the 
domain scores are the mean of the questions in each domain. 
The generally accepted MCID for the overall RQLQ(S) and each individual 
domain is 0.522,24,28,29 and has also been reported as ≥ 0.62.30 The developers of 
the RQLQ instruments reported that the MCID for the MiniRQLQ  was slightly 
higher (0.7) than for the RQLQ(S).25 Another study using a combination of both 
anchor- based and distribution- based methods determined t he MCID for the 
MiniRQLQ to be 0.42 ( 95% confidence interval 0.30 - 0.51).31

4.5.6 Participant Satisfaction  
Five-question self -reported survey using a 5- point scale to assess tolerability of 
the procedure, ease of recovery, change in drainage/rhinor rhea/runny nose 
symptoms , overall satisfaction with the procedure , and recommendation to

4.5.7 Change in A mount of PRN M edication/ Device Use for C hronic R hinitis  
Symptoms  
Self-reported assessment of an increase or decrease from baseline in as  needed 
medications and/or devices used for treatment of nasal symptoms following the 
procedure.  
4.5.8 Medication  and Other Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_143086] , devices or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_143087], medication name, frequency, and dose will be recorded at each 
evaluation visit. Medications may  be categorized for reporting purposes. 
4.5.9 Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be documented according to Section 7.2. 
4.6 Success /Failure Criteria  
Determinations of the successfulness of the treatment will be made on 2 levels, the 
individual participant  level and in terms of the overall treatment group success 
relative to the sham  control group. Each level has its own criteria for success.  
4.6.1 Part icipant  Succes s 
The primary outcome success measure for i ndividual participant success 
(responder) is defined as at least 30% improvement (decrease) in the rTNSS from baseline at the 3 -month primary endpoint. 
4.6.2 Participant  Failure  
A participant  will be considered a nonresponder at the 3-month evaluation  if 
the success criterion has not been attained.  
4.6.3 Study Success  
The study will be considered a success if the proportion of participants  
achieving a successful outcome (responder) that received treatment with the RhinAer  procedure is statistically significantly greater than  the proportion 
achieving individual success when treated with the sham control procedure 
when evaluated at [ADDRESS_1161682] to crossover and receive the active RhinAer 
procedure within 30 days after the 3- or 6-month evaluation with continued follow -
up for 24 more months for a total of up to 31 months of follow -up. Enrollment is 
anticipated to be completed within 12 months. Therefore, total study duration is anticipated to be approximately 43 months. 
4.8 Site Staffing and Responsibilities of Study Personnel  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_836761]/she has sufficient and 
qualified staff to conduct the clinical study and that all study -related tasks have been 
appropriately delegated and documented. Roles may include:  
• Treating physician – The treating physician will perform the procedure and 
discharge assessments.  The treating physician must be a medical doctor with 
experience in ENT procedures and trained in administering the RhinAer  
procedure. 
• Blinded physician evaluator ( not required) – A physician experienced in ENT 
procedures , trained for participation in this study, and unaware of the 
treatment received may be used to conduct the follow -up nasal assessment.  
The blinded evaluator may  also be responsible for the initial assessment and 
treatment of adverse events; however, in some cases it may be necessary to refer the event to the treating physician. If a blinded evaluator is not available, 
the treating physician or principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_836762] -up 
assessments.  
• Oversight of  participant reported outcomes  and other data collection – 
Medical or office staff with relevant knowledge and experience as determined by [CONTACT_458]  [INVESTIGATOR_836763] . Ideally , these 
individuals would be unaware of the treatment received by [CONTACT_3038]. 
Due to difference s between the actual and sham control procedure s, staff may also 
become aware of the treatment being administered. Staff with knowledge of the 
treatment assignment should not communicate any information to the participant  or 
blinded evaluator (if used) in order to minimize any potential bias.  
4.9 Device Description  
The RhinAe r procedure incorporates use of the RhinAer  Stylus (Model  FG815), 
which is a cleared ( FDA - K192471 ) disposable handheld device capable of 
delivering bipolar radiofrequency energy to tissue, and the Aerin Console  (Model 
FG226), a cleared (FDA - K162810) RF generator with temperature control capable 
of delivering very low doses of energy. 
  CTP1004 Rev E 
Clinical Study Protocol - R HINTRAC    
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
 25 of 57  
The RhinAer  Stylus (Figure 1)  consists of a handle, shaft and treatment tip. An array 
of bipolar electrodes is positioned on a nonconductive tip (Figure 2) that  is attached 
to the handle via a nonconductive shaft. A temperature sensor is located on the Stylus 
tip to monitor tissue temperature  during RF energy delivery. The Stylus is powered 
by [CONTACT_143118]- controlled radiofrequency generator  via a flexible cable 
(Figure 3).  The Stylus incorporates features to allow compatibility with and 
authentication by [CONTACT_836773]. The connector for the RhinAer  Stylus has 
a pin configuration that prevents its use with other RF generators, making it onl y 
compatible with the Aerin Console. Authentication of the Stylus is achieved via a 
crypto chip that is built into the Stylus handle assembly. The chip is read and written to by [CONTACT_143120]. Information stored on the chip includes the Stylus model 
information, default treatment parameters (Power 4W, Temperature 60  °C, Duration 
12s, Cooling Time 0s ), custom treatment setting ranges (Power 3- 5W, Temperature 
50-70°C, Duration 10-18s, Cooling 9-12s), usage timestamp data, and a count of the 
remaining treatment cycles (based upon pre- set maximum).  
The RhinAer Stylus is temporarily inserted into the nose to access the treated area. 
The Stylus requires the application of conductive media to the treatment tip prior to use. The conductive media helps to ensure good contact [CONTACT_836774]. Application of the RF energy is controlled by a foot switch connected to the Console. The RhinAer Stylus treats symptoms of chronic rhinitis by [CONTACT_836775] . The low -power radiofrequency energy generates heat within the 
submucosal tissue, destroying local tissue, mucous cells, and glands, and creating a coagulation lesion. This destruction of tissue in posterior nasal nerve regions improves symptoms of chronic rhinitis. 
The procedure requires local anesthesia only. The Stylus is manufactured and 
supplied sterile and  for single use only by [CONTACT_143123].

4.10 Risk/Benefit Analysis  
4.10.1 Risks  
Potential risks associated with the use of the Rhin Aer Stylus do not differ from 
commonly used devices and treatments for chronic rhinitis, but due to the 
nonsurgical nature of the therapy, small treatment area, low energy delivery , 
and lack of need for general anesthesia, the overall risk to the participant may 
be less than presented by [CONTACT_143124] . 
Potential risks associated with the use of the Rhin Aer Stylus and the associated 
local anesthetics are listed  below. Participants  will be monitored closely as part 
of this study to allow for early detection of potential problems and prompt  
treatment if required . 
Adverse events or side effects that may occur as a result of the treatment  
include: 
• External deformity  
• Blanching (generalized whiteness)  
• Bruising including around the orbital area (black eyes) 
• Infection  
• Bleeding (other than during the treatment at treatment sites and greater 
than anticipated by [CONTACT_093]) 

  CTP1004 Rev E 
Clinical Study Protocol - R HINTRAC    
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
 28 of 57  
• Mucosal changes  
• Scar forma tion leading to nasal obstruction 
• Sensory changes at treatment site 
• Dry eye 
• Vasovagal response secondary to the procedure 
Anticipated observations that are expected in and around the treatment area and 
are considered minor  include: 
• Inflammation / generaliz ed redness  
• Temporary swelling, edema 
• Temporary numbness/tingling 
• Temporary soreness/pain  
• Mild bleeding at anesthetic injection and/or treatment site (not requiring 
physician-level intervention, such as cautery) 
• Temporary nasal obstruction from tissue edema 
• Disruption of mucosal flow/intranasal crusting 
• Scab formation . 
These observations will be assessed in the nasal assessment and recorded at study visits if they occur. Should any of the following require mitigation by [CONTACT_836776], they will be considered an adverse event and will be recorded on the study Adverse Event CRF. 
Symptomatic improvements may not be achieved in all participants receiving 
the RhinAer  procedure and may not be durable beyond the 3-month evaluation 
in all participants with relief at 3 months.  
An additional risk to participants receiving the sham procedure is a potential for higher likelihood of the treatment not relieving their chronic rhinitis symptoms compared to those receiving the RhinAer  procedure.  
4.10.2 Mitigation of Risks 
The study was developed based on previous preclinical and clinical experience and includes a number of steps to minimize any additional risks to participants  
in the study: 
• Careful consideration has been given to the inclusion/exclusion criteria in order to select appropriate candidates for treatment.  
• Patient s will be fully informed of the study requirements prior to 
enrollment.  
  CTP1004 Rev E 
Clinical Study Protocol - R HINTRAC    
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
 29 of 57  
• Only physicians with experience in nasal surgical and minimally 
invasive procedures, and with specific training using the RhinAer  Stylus 
for performing the Rhin Aer procedure will be permitted  to participate 
in the study. 
• The s tudy will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_154630](s) and conducted according to applicable regulations with ongoing review by [CONTACT_1201] . 
• Study procedures, f ollow-up, and study monitoring are designed to 
detect and respond to any adverse events in a timely manner. 
• Preclinical mechanical and bench evaluations have been conducted to demonstrate that the design characteristics of the study devi ce are 
appropriate for reliable clinical use of the device.  
• The RhinAer  Stylus and Console have been cleared for use by [CONTACT_836777]. 
• Participants receiving the sham control procedure will be offered the 
RhinAer  procedure if they have not responded to the sham procedure by 
[CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_1161683] to par ticipants . Participants 
randomized to the sham control procedure will be offered the opportunity to 
receive the RhinAer  procedure within 30 days after the 3- or 6-month evaluation 
if the control procedure has  not alleviate d their symptoms.  
4.10.4 Potential Risks to Participant Confidentiality  
In all clinical studies, confidentiality of protected health information may be 
breached due to study- related  activities  beyond those of routine clinical  care.  
This risk will be minimized  by [CONTACT_836778]’s electronic case report forms (eCRF).

physical and endoscopic nasal assessment conducted just prior to the procedure will 
be documented on the appropriate CRF. The study physician will map out the 
treatment area by [CONTACT_836782]. Participants  will have both posterior nasal nerve areas  treated in a single 
study procedure session. Each nostril will be treated at up to 5 nonoverlappi[INVESTIGATOR_836765] (Figure 4). 
 
Figure 4.  RhinAer Stylus in the nose.  
The physician will anesthetize the treatment area by [CONTACT_2329] a topi[INVESTIGATOR_143091]/gauze or 
spray  of lidocaine to numb the mucosal tissue , wait approximately [ADDRESS_1161688] anesthesia to the treatment area after  initial numbness has occurred. The 
sham cont rol participants will receive the same anesthesia as the actively treated 
participants.  
Treatment a dministration  
An endoscope will be inserted into the nasal cavity so the physician can visualize the  
mucosal area of treatment. The RhinAer  Stylus will then be inserted to access the 
treatment  area.  The Stylus will be connected to the Aerin Console generator and the 
RF energy level will be set on the generator.  
The default settings for the RhinAer Stylus will be used for the study:  
Temperature   60 °C 
Power   [ADDRESS_1161689] when energy is 
being delivered until the treatment is complete. After the treatment time is reached, the A erin Console will cease to delivery energy and reset for subsequent treatments.  
When conducting a sham control procedure,  the physician will  activat e an audible 
tone mimicking the activation of the Aerin Console; however , no energy will be 
transmitted to the Stylus. The physician should apply the Stylus to the mucosal surface with similar pressure and in similar locations as would be done if energy was actually being applied. 
No repeat ("touch- up") procedures will be permitted during the study follow-up 
period.  
Procedure data collection  
Data relating to the procedure and the products used will be recorded on the 
Procedure CRF . The following information will be recorded:  
• Date of procedure  
• Preprocedure nasal assessment (each nostril) including photos or video 
(physical and endoscopic) 
• Preprocedure and procedure medications 
• RhinAer  Stylus and Aerin Console information  
• Aerin Console settings 
• Procedure start and end time s 
• Number of sites treated  
• Occurrence of device malfunction, protocol deviation, or a dverse events . 
5.5 Postprocedure Assessments and Care 
An endoscopic  nasal assessment will  be conducted prior to discharging the 
participant  and reported on the Procedure CRF . 
Participants will be as ked to indicate  the pain level experienced during the study 
procedure from anesthesia delivery to procedure completion using the VAS pain score instrument (vertical line marked on the 100 mm line) on the Pain VAS CRF. 
At the discretion of the physician, the following care may be provided: 
• Apply compression to the treatment area internally for 5 minutes. 
• Apply petroleum jelly to the treatment area as needed.  
• Use of nasal saline spray or ointment as needed . 
• The participant  should be instructed not to blow their nose for [ADDRESS_1161690] follow- up visit (4 weeks) scheduled within the 
visit window prior to release . 
Participants  should not generally receive other concomitant nasal treatment therapi[INVESTIGATOR_143092] -up period to avoid 
confounding the evaluation of the effect of the treatment , unless the additional care 
is in response to an adverse event or is considered in the best interest of the 
participant . Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], interventions, and pain medication will be monitored at 
follow-up evaluations.   
5.6 Follow- up Evaluations  and Study Exit  
Follow- up visit dates will be calculated from the study procedure date. Follow -up 
visits should be scheduled within the specified visit windows described in Section 
5.1 and Table 1 (Section 8.3.2). In-office f ollow-up evaluations are scheduled for 4 
weeks  (1 month), 13 weeks (3 months), and 26 weeks (6 months) after the treatment 
procedure . Evaluations at [ADDRESS_1161691] the RhinAer  procedure within 30 days after their 3 , 
or 6-month evaluation, should be followed through the final evaluation visit at 2 years  
postprocedure r egardless of their  success/failure classification.   Participants who 
receive the sham procedure and are evaluated at 13 weeks or 26 -weeks and continue 
to meet all of the original inclusion and exclusion criteria, including rTNSS ≥  6, will 
be offered the op portunity to have the RhinAer procedure performed. Participants 
who choose to have the procedure will maintain their original study ID and will 
follow the same pretreatment, treatment, and follow -up processes as any newly 
enrolled participant. 
Sham control  procedure participants who choose not to have the RhinAer procedure 
or who fail to meet inclusion and exclusion criteria may  elect to  exit from the study 
following the 3- or 6-month evaluation. Refer to the Participant Flowchart, Section 
5.2 for depi[INVESTIGATOR_836766].   
Every effort should be made to avoid having participants  withdraw from the 
study(Section 9.5). If a participant  does choose to withdraw from the study, it is very 
important to record information regarding the reason(s) and the last known status of 
the participant . 
The following assessments will be conducted as indicated for each follow -up time 
point and recorded on the corresponding CRF s:

final disposition  of study inventory. 
6.0 Statistical Considerations  
6.1 Study Design  
This is a prospective, m ulticenter, randomized, sham -controlled s tudy to compare the 
RhinAer  procedure for treatment of chronic rhinitis  with a sham procedure that 
duplicates the actual procedure as closely as possible absent the delivery of radiofrequency  (RF) energy to the nasal tissue . Participants  will be randomized using 
a 2:1 allocation to receive either the RhinAer  procedure or a sham procedure 
(control) . This study is designed to demonstrate the superiority of the active RhinAer  
treatment compared to the sham  control. 
6.2 Study Hypotheses  
The null hypothesis (H
0) for this superiority study is that there is no difference 
between the success (responder) ra te for the sham  control and the success (responder) 
rate for the RhinAer  procedure: 
H0: πC - π T = 0 vs. H 1: πC - π T ≠ 0 
where:  
πC=proportion of responders in the sham procedure control group 
πT=proportion of responders in the RhinAer  procedure treatment group. 
Rejection of the two -sided null hypothesis in favor of the alternative (H 1) hypothesis 
means that there is evidence for a statistically significant difference in responder rates 
between the [ADDRESS_1161694]  and on the following assumptions: 
• Significance level α = 0.05 (two-sided) 
• Power = 80% 
• πC = 0.50 (allowance for a 50% control responders ) 
• πT = 0.80 (assumed 80% responde rs in the treated group) 
• Treatment allocation is 2:1  
• 10% dropout and nonevaluable. 
The 80% responder rate assumed for the active RhinAer  procedure group is an  
estimate based on the prior clinical study of this procedure in which 43 of 50 
  CTP1004 Rev E 
Clinical Study Protocol - R HINTRAC    
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
 39 of 57  
participants (86%) were responders at 12 weeks . The one-sided lower 95% 
confidence bound on the responder rate of 86% is 76%, which supports the estimate 
of 80% responders assu med for the purpose of sample size calculation. 
Studies of randomized placebo -controlled efficacy trials of drugs used to treat allergic 
rhinitis  have found high response to placebo including up to a 57% share of the 
therapeutic effect for AR34 and up to a  25% reduction in TNSS  for perennial allergic 
rhinitis35 with a strong placebo effect observed where the evaluating parameters tend 
to be physical or subjective rather than objective indicators of drug efficacy.36 The 
50% responder rate assumed for the sham control procedure is based on the literature 
for placebo and sham controls in therapeutic and device studies suggesting from 30% 
to 60% responder rates, with device studies tending to be at the higher end of the range
37. 
The minimum number of participant s to achieve 80% power with a 2:1 active 
treatment to sham  control allocation is 66 in the active treatment group and 33 in the 
sham  group. The sample size, allowing for 10% loss (nonevaluable) in each group  
and adjusting for a balanced distribution across 20 sites is 120 participants  (80 active 
treatment  (RhinAer procedure), 40 sham procedure control ). 
It is anticipated that participant s will be enrolled at sites on a competitive basis; 
however, a  reasonable balance of partic ipants among sites may  be maintained by

primary endpoint at 13 weeks (3 months) postprocedure. The primary  and secondary 
endpoints will be analyzed using the data from the primary evaluation phase for an 
interim study report  when  these data become available. I nformational outc omes will 
be analyzed and included in interim reports after all participants have reached each 
of the successive follow -up time points. A  final study report  will be provided after all 
participants have reached the final follow- up evaluation of the extended  follow-up 
phase of the study, including sham procedure control participants who subsequently received the RhinAer procedure. 
6.5 Analysis Populations 
The primary endpoint analysis will be based on the intent -to-treat (ITT) princip le. 
Participants  will be analyzed in the originally randomized treatment group regardless 
of actual treatment received. The effects of protocol deviations will only be examined when the validity of the study conclusion is in question. All secondary and other 
analyses and reports will include an ITT population analysis. Following data 
reporting conventions, statistics on the per protocol population will also be reported. The per protocol population is defined as all participant s who received treatments, 
with 13- week ( 3-month) follow-up data and no major protocol deviations.

7.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) may occur during the treatment phase or during the follow-up phase. Adverse events occurring after the baseline assessment but before the 
treatment procedure will be documented in the participant ’s medical record but will 
not count as related to the study device or procedure.   
7.1.1 Definitions  
Following are definitions associate d with adverse events:  
Adverse Event (AE)  - any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical sign or symptom (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), in subjects whether or not related to the investigational drug or medical device product. This includes events related to investigational drug or medical device product, comparator and/or events related to the procedures involved. For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events  related to 
investigational medical devices . 
  CTP1004 Rev E 
Clinical Study Protocol - R HINTRAC    
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
 44 of 57  
Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) - any untoward medical occurrence that: (a) led 
to death, (b) resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury, (c) resulted in 
permanent impairment of a body structure or body function, (d) required 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], (e) resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to a body structure or body function or  (f) led to fetal distress, fetal death or a con genital 
abnormality or birth defect. 
Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  - Adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device. This includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device and also includes any event 
resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational 
medical device.  
Serious Adverse D evice  Effect (SADE)  - An adverse device effect that has 
resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event or 
that might have led to any of these consequences if suitable action had not been taken or intervention had not been made or if circumstances had been less opportune. 
Anticipated Adverse Device Effect (AADE)  - A device -related event described 
in the investigational protocol or informed consent for the clinical trial of an investigational device. 
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE  or [LOCATION_003]DE ) - A serious 
adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
Relationship to device and procedure 
The potential relationship of the event to the device or procedure:  
• Not related  
An adverse event for which sufficient information exists to indicate that there is no causal connection between the event and the device or procedure. The adverse event is due to and readily explained by [CONTACT_2299] ’s underlying disease state or is due to concomitant 
medication or therapy not related to the use of the device or the procedure. In addition, the adverse event may not follow a reasonable 
temporal sequence following the treatment procedure.  
• Possibly related  
There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been primarily caused by [CONTACT_239060].  The adverse event has a 
  CTP1004 Rev E 
Clinical Study Protocol - R HINTRAC    
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  
 45 of 57  
reasonable temporal relationship to the use of the device or the 
procedure and follows a known or expected response pattern to the device or procedure, but alternative etiology is equally or more likely compared to the potential relationship to the use of the device or the 
procedure. 
• Probably related  
There is a reasonable probability that the adverse event may have been primarily caused by [CONTACT_41491]. The adverse event has a reasonable temporal relationship to the use of the device or the procedure and follows a known or expected response pattern to the device or procedure.  
• Definitely related  
The adverse event has a strong causal relationship to the device or procedure. The adverse event follows a strong temporal relationship to the use of the device or the procedure, follows a known response pattern 
to the device  or procedure, and cannot be reasonably explained by 
[CONTACT_143140] ’s clinical state or other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Every effort should be made to determine the cause of each adverse event, because a judgment must be made as to the relationship to the device or procedure. If an investigator cannot assign a causality category the event will be considered possibly related for reporting and analysis. 
NOTE: The occurrence of a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a pre-
existing condition, unless the  condition becomes more severe or increases in 
frequency, would not be considered procedure- related  or device- related.  
Intensity of adverse events :  
• Mild  
The adverse event is noticeable to the participant  but does not interfere 
with routine activity.  
• Moder ate 
The adverse event interferes with routine activity but responds to symptomatic therapy or rest. 
• Severe  
The adverse event significantly limits the participant 's ability to perform 
routine activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_4795]. The adverse event requires medical or surgical treatment or results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
February  16, [ADDRESS_340322] of genetic variation on response to clopi[INVESTIGATOR_278662] (i.e. clopi[INVESTIGATOR_278663]), as assessed by [CONTACT_278674], in 
healthy Amish individuals.  The research design of this investigation closely mirror s the study design 
implemented in the P harmacogenomics of Anti -Platelet  Intervention (P API) Study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The 
primary reason for the significant overlap in study design is that it is our intention to integrate data collected in 
this protocol with currently existing data generated as part of the PAPI [INVESTIGATOR_278664] p erform robust, well -
powered statistical analyses pertaining to clopi[INVESTIGATOR_278665].  
 
Specifically, we enroll ed 6 healthy Amish participants who were  identified using genomic and  bioinformatic 
approaches. Enrolled participants  under went  a two -stage intervention with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (300 mg loading dose 
then 75 mg per day for the next 6 days), followed by [CONTACT_8311][INVESTIGATOR_7745] (75 mg) plus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 324 mg (4 baby [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_248]) 
for 1 day. Platelet aggregation studies were performed before and after each intervention.  
 
Home visit to screen for eligibility : A research nurse and an Amish community liaison visit ed potential research 
subjects in their homes. This mechanism is culturally appropriate since the Amish do not have phones in their 
homes and pr efer face -to-face contact [CONTACT_278675].  The nurse explain ed the study and , if the individual was 
interested in participating,  obtain ed informed consent  and HIPAA authorization . Following informed consent, 
vital signs as well as medical and family history wil l be obtained. Approximately [ADDRESS_340323] (TSH) to evaluate eligibility.  Exclusion 
criteria were  identical to the original PAPI [INVESTIGATOR_278666] . Briefly, participants 
were excluded if they were  pregnant, currently breastfeeding, had a history of a bleeding disorder or major 
spontaneous bleed, hypertensive, creatinine lev els > 2.0 mg/dL, ALT or AST > 2 x the upper limit of normal, 
hematocrit < 28%, TSH < 0.4 or >5.5 mlU/L, platelet count > 500,000 or < 75,000, currently taking antiplatelet 
or anti -coagulant medication, history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, taking vitamins or other 
supplements and unwilling or cannot safely, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_9764], discontinue their use at least 
[ADDRESS_340324] is on medications that may potentially interfere with the planned intervention, 
he/she w as instructed to consult with his/her physician regarding discontinuing such therapy prior to study 
enrollment. Alternatively, with the subject's permission, the study physician contact [CONTACT_278676]'s physician to 
discuss and obtain permission for med ication withdrawal. If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_121479]'s physician and the 
study physician, discontinuation of medications for the duration of the study d id not pose any undue health 
risks, medications w ere discontinued one week before the first clinic visit . If a medication require d tapering, this 
commence d two weeks prior to the first clinic visit. Similarly, all vitamins (except daily multivitamins) and other 
supplements w ere withdrawn for [ADDRESS_340325] w as performed at the clinic visit #1 prior to drug administration.  
 
Following review of screening information and lab results, eligibility was confirmed. Eligible participants 
complete d studies during the course of two visits to the Amish Research Clinic  in Lancaster, PA . 
 
Clinic Visit #1 (Baseline Platelet Function) : Research subjects w ere transported to the Amish Research Clinic 
after an overnight fast where heights, weights, and vital signs will be measured. Women of child bearing age 
under went  a pregnancy test. Fasting blood samples were  obtained to assess circulating lipid levels (LDL, HDL, 
and triglycerides), evaluate baseline measures of agonist -stimulated platelet aggregation, and for sample 
banking. Participants were  observed while taking the loading dose of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (300 mg), discharged to home 
with additional tablets, and instru cted to take 75 mg/ day for the following 6 days at the same time each day. 
Drug adherence w as assessed by [CONTACT_278677][INVESTIGATOR_278667] a study nurse at the 
beginning of Clinic Visit #2.  
 
Clinic Visit #2 (On -Drug Platelet Function) : On t he 7th day, subjects return ed to the clinic. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_278668]. Fasting blood samples w ere drawn approximately [ADDRESS_340326]  occu rred up to 10 days after Visit 1 in which case the drug w as taken for 1 to 3 additional days. After the 
participants completed all of the procedures pertaining to on -clopi[INVESTIGATOR_278669], they receive d a one -
time dose of 324 m g of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (oral ingestion of 4 baby [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_278670]). Approximately 2 hours after the 
participants t ook the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], repeat measures of platelet aggregation w ere recorded and blood samples w ere 
banked . 
 
Assessment of Platelet Function : At both clinic vi sits, platelet -rich plasma (PRP) w as isolated from fasting 
blood samples drawn into 3.2% citrate -anticoagulated tubes (Becton -Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and 
platelet counts w ere adjusted to approximately 200,000 platelets/μl using platelet -poor plasma.  Platelet 
function w as assessed by [CONTACT_278678] a PAP8E Aggregometer (Bio/Data Corporation, 
Horsham, PA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions after stimulation with collagen (5 μg/ml)  and ADP 
(20 μM) and w as expressed as the maximal percentage change in li ght transmittance using platelet -poor 
plasma as a referent.  Platelet function was assessed twice during Clinic Visit #2; before and after 
administration of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_278671].  
 
Distributions of summary statistics (e.g. age, sex, change in platelet function ) were generated using SAS 9.2 
(Cary, NC) . Change in clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] -induced platelet aggregation in response to ADP and collagen w ere 
calculated by [CONTACT_278679] -clopi[INVESTIGATOR_278672] (i.e. 
pre-drug)  values  of the same platelet agonist . Similarly, change in dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_278673]) -induced platelet aggregation in response to ADP and collagen w ere calculated by [CONTACT_278680] (i.e. pre -drug) values of the same platelet 
agonist.

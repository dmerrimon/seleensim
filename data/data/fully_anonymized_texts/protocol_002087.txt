EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY  
The intravascular  administration  of iodinated contrast  media  for diagnostic  imaging  is a common  
cause of acute  kidney  injury  (AKI)  and a leading  cause of iatrogenic  renal  disease.  Multiple  
studies  have  demonstrated  that contrast -induced  AKI (CIAKI)  is associated  with increased  short - 
term mortality,  prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], increased  medical  resource  utilization,  and adverse  
long-term outcomes.  CIAKI is a unique  form  of renal  disease in that it is universally  iatrogenic,  
its risk factors  and pathophysiology  are well-characterized,  and its inciting  event is highly  
predictable.  All of these characteristics  make CIAKI particularly  amenable  to preventive  
interventions.  
 
Intravenous  (IV) isotonic  fluid  is the principal  intervention with documented  effectiveness  for 
the prevention of CIAKI.  Over  the past half-decade,  clinical  trials  have focused  on the 
comparative effectiveness  of IV sodium  bicarbonate  (bicarbonate)  and IV sodium  chloride  
(saline).  While  several  trials  demonstrated  bicarbonate  to be more  effective than saline  for the 
prevention  of CIAKI,  other  trials  reported  no difference between  these two IV fluids. Another  
preventive  intervention  for CIAKI that has received  substantial  attention  over the past decade is 
peri-procedural  administration  of N-acetylcysteine  (NAC),  an anti-oxidant  agent  with 
vasodilatory  properties.  Published  results regarding  the efficacy  of NAC  are inconsistent. 
Multiple  meta -analyses  attempting  to reconcile the conflicting  studies  on these  interventions  
have  themselves,  been inconclusive.  Consequently,  there remains  clinical  equipoise  regarding  
the superiority  of bicarbonate (compared  to saline)  and role of  NAC for the  prevention  of CIAKI.  
 
We believe  that there  are three reasons  that past trials  and meta -analyses  have  not provided clear  
evidence to guide  the use of bicarbonate and NAC  for the prevention of CIAKI.  First,  all of the 
published clinical  trials  enrolled relatively  small  numbers  of patients  and most  assumed  
unrealistically  large  effect  sizes  for the tested  interventions.  As a result,  these  studies  were  
underpowered  to detect  biologically  plausible,  yet clinically  important  benefits  of these 
interventions  and were particularly  susceptible to false positive  and false negative results.  Second,  
many  trials  included patients  at low-risk for CIAKI,  which  resulted  in relatively  few primary  
study  events  and diminished the ability  to discern  the effects  of these interventions  in

CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75734]  importantly,  nearly  all prior  trials  used small  absolute  and/or  relative increases  in 
serum  creatinine (SCr)  as the primary  study  endpoint  rather  than serious, adverse patient - centered  
outcomes  thought  to represent  downstream  consequences  of CIAKI  (e.g., mortality,  need  for 
acute dialysis,  or persistent  decline in kidney  function).  While  a multitude  of studies  have 
demonstrated  that minor  increases  in SCr  following angiography  are associated  with serious  
adverse events,  it is unknown whether  the prevention of small  increases  in  SCr  following  contrast  
administration  results in a  reduction in clinically  important patient -centered  outcomes.  
 
To assess  the comparative  effectiveness  of bicarbonate  and saline  and the benefit  of NAC,  we 
propose  to conduct  a multicenter,  randomized,  clinical  trial designed  and adequately  powered  to 
evaluate  these interventions  for the prevention  of clinically  important,  adverse,  patient -centered  
outcomes  in high-risk Veterans  undergoing cardiac and non-cardiac angiography. In this trial, 
7,680 patients  scheduled  to undergo  coronary  or non-coronary  angiography who are at increased  
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_69421]  (i.e., diabetics  with 
eGFR  <60 ml/min/1.73  m2 or any patient  with eGFR  <45 ml/min/1.73  m2) will be enrolled.  
Using  a 2 x 2 factorial  design, patients  will be randomized  to receive:  1) either  IV isotonic  
sodium  bicarbonate  or IV isotonic  saline and 2) either  oral NAC  or oral placebo  prior  to and 
following  the angiographic  procedure. We will assess  the effectiveness  of bicarbonate  compared  
to saline  and NAC  compared  to placebo  for the prevention of a composite  primary  endpoint  
consisting  of clinically  significant,  patient -centered  events  including  death,  need for acute  
dialysis,  or persistent  decline in kidney  function, all within  [ADDRESS_75735] 0.5 mg/dL  and/or  25% at [ADDRESS_75736]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”

CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75739] -induced acute kidney  injury  (CIAKI)  is defined  by [CONTACT_69505].  CIAKI  occurs  in a 
substantial proportion of high-risk patients  following  angiography and is associated  with serious, 
adverse,  short  and long- term outcomes. CIAKI is one of the few preventable  forms  of acute  
kidney  injury  and substantial advancements  in our understanding  of its risk factors  and 
pathogenesis  have  informed  research  efforts  to identify  safe and effective preventive  
interventions.  
 
The cornerstone  of preventive  care for CIAKI  is the administration  of peri-procedure  IV isotonic  
fluid.  Recent  clinical  trials  and meta -analyses  suggest  that IV isotonic  sodium  bicarbonate  
(bicarbonate)  is more  effective than IV isotonic  sodium  chloride  (saline).  However,  these  studies  
have  significant  limitations  and definitive  conclusions  regarding  the superiority  of bicarbonate  
compared  to saline  have  not been  reached.  Another  promising  preventive  strategy  is the provision  
of anti-oxidant  therapy  using  N-acetylcysteine (NAC).  Although  some  clinical  trials  and meta -
analyses  of NAC  support  its effectiveness,  conclusive  evidence is lacking  due to limitations  
of the studies  to date.  Consequently, there continues  to be clinical  equipoise  on the superiority  
of bicarbonate  compared  to saline  and on the benefit  of NAC  for the prevention  of CIAKI.  
Moreover,  because the majority  of past studies  focused  only on endpoints  defined  by [CONTACT_69506] -
term changes  in kidney  function,  it is unknown whether  the purported  beneficial  effects  of these 
two interventions  on the prevention  of CIAKI  translate  into meaningful  reductions  in serious,  
adverse,  patient -centered  outcomes  such as death,  need for dialysis,  or persistent  decline  in kidney  
function. Therefore,  we propose  to conduct  a multicenter,  randomized clinical  trial to assess  the 
effectiveness  of IV isotonic  bicarbonate  compared  with IV isotonic  saline  and oral NAC  
compared  with oral placebo  for the prevention  of serious,  adverse outcomes  in high-risk 
Veterans  undergoing  coronary  or non- coronary  angiography.

II. STUDY HYPOTHESES  AND OBJECTIVES  
A. Study  hypotheses  
1. Compared  to peri-procedural  infusion of IV isotonic  saline,  peri-procedural  infusion  of 
IV isotonic  sodium  bicarbonate  will decrease 90-day morbidity  (i.e., need for acute dialysis,  
persistent  decline  in kidney  function)  and mortality  in high-risk patients  undergoing  coronary  or 
non-coronary  angiography. The decrease in 90-day morbidity  and mortality  associated  with 
sodium  bicarbonate administration  in high-risk patients  will be mediated  by a reduction  in the 
incidence of  contrast -induced  acute kidney  injury  within  4 days  of angiography.  
 
2. Administration  of NAC  in the  peri-procedural  period will decrease 90-day morbidity  (i.e.,  
need  for acute dialysis,  persistent  decline  in kidney  function)  and mortality  in high-risk patients  
undergoing  coronary  or non-coronary  angiography. The decrease  in 90-day morbidity  and 
mortality  associated  with NAC  administration  in high-risk patients  will be mediated  by a 
reduction in the  incidence of  contrast -induced acute kidney  injury  within  4 days  of angiography.

III. BACKGROUND  
A. CIAKI:  Definition,  incidence,  risk  factors,  and outcomes  
1. Definition,  incidence,  and risk  factors  for CIAKI  
Contrast -induced acute kidney  injury  (CIAKI)  is defined  as a sudden decline in kidney  function  
following  the intravascular  administration  of iodinated  contrast  media  for diagnostic  imaging.1-[ADDRESS_75741]  commonly  in research  and clinical  practice is an increase in the serum  
creatinine concentration (SCr) of at least 0.5 mg/dL  and/or  25% within  3-[ADDRESS_75742]  
exposure.4-6 Precise  estimates  of the incidence  of CIAKI following  angiography  vary 
considerably  based  on patient  characteristics,  procedural  factors,  and the threshold change  in SCr 
used to define  this condition.4, 7 We recently  found that CIAKI occurred  in 8.5%  of clinically  
stable  Veterans  with eGFR  <60 ml/min/1.73  m2 undergoing  non-urgent  coronary  angiography  
and 13.2%  of clinically  stable  Veterans  with eGFR  <60 ml/min/1.73  m2 undergoing  non-urgent, 
non-coronary  angiography.8 Some  studies  demonstrate  that up to 33% of very high-risk patients  
develop this condition following  contrast -enhanced  procedures.[ADDRESS_75743] research  has elucidated  the principal  patient  and procedure -related  risk factors  for CIAKI 
(Table  1). Underlying  kidney  dysfunction is recognized  as the most  important  risk factor  for the 
development  of CIAKI,  with increasing  levels  of renal  impairment associated  with escalating  
levels  of risk.[ADDRESS_75744],  as are 
patients   with   advanced  heart   failure.10   In Table  1 - Principal  risk  factors  for CIAKI  
 
• Underlying  renal  insufficiency  
• Diabetes  mellitus*  
• Intravascular volume  depletion  
• Congestive heart  failure  
• Volume of  contrast  used 
• Hyper -osmolal contrast  media  
• Intra-arterial  contrast  administration  
 
*amplifies  risk in the  setting  of renal  insufficiency  
both clinical  states,  decreas ed effective circulating  volume  and reduced  renal  perfusion potentiate  
renal  vasoconstriction  following  the administration  of intravascular  contrast.  The risk of CIAKI  
increases  with larger  volumes  of administered  contrast.14, [ADDRESS_75745]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”

 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75746]  likely  to develop CIAKI and has informed research  efforts  to assess the 
effectiveness  of preventive  interventions  for this iatrogenic condition. 
 
2. Association of  CIAKI  with clinically  meaningful, patient -centered  outcomes  
a. Short -term mortality associated  with CIAKI  
Observational  studies  demonstrate  an association  between  CIAKI  (defined  by [CONTACT_69509]/or  relative  changes  in SCr) and increased  short -term mortality.11, 16-22 In a retrospective  
study,  Levy  et al. found that the incidence  of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69423]  183 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69424]  (defined  by [CONTACT_69510] ≥25%  to at least 2.0 mg/dL)  was 34% 
compared  to 7% in 174 matched  controls  without  CIAKI (unadjusted OR=6.5, p<0.001).16 In 
analyses  that accounted  for underlying  severity  of illness,  CIAKI  remained  a strong predictor  of 
in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51347]  (OR=5.5, p<0.001). A subsequent  study by [CONTACT_69511]. of 1,826 patients  
who underwent  percutaneous  coronary  intervention (PCI)  found an incidence  of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69425] 7.1%  among  patients  who developed CIAKI  (defined  by [CONTACT_69510] 
>25%)  compared  to 1.1%  in those  without  this change in SCr (p<0.0001).11  In patients  who 
developed CIAKI  that required  renal  replacement  therapy,  in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69426] 35.7%. Six 
additional  studies,  including  an analysis  by [CONTACT_69512] 27,000 patients  reported  an 
independent  association  of CIAKI  with short -term mortality  (Table 2). 17-22

missing  data.11, 16-19, 21, 22 However,  prospective  studies  confirm  these  findings.23, 24 A clinical  
trial by [CONTACT_69513]. found  that patients  who developed  CIAKI (defined  by [CONTACT_69514] ≥25%)  had a significantly  increased  incidence of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69427] (26%  v. 1.4%,  p<0.001).23 An even  more  recent  trial of 
patients  undergoing  coronary  angiography  by [CONTACT_69515]. demonstrated that in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69428] (defined  by [CONTACT_69516] ≥0.5 mg/dL) 
was markedly  higher  than among  patients  who did not develop  this post-procedure  complication  
(11.1%  v. 0.2%, p=0.001).[ADDRESS_75750] -angiography  decrements  in renal  function with  short -term mortality.  
 
b. Prolonged  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69429]  
A series  of retrospective  studies  and clinical  trials  also document  an association  of CIAKI  with 
other  clinically -relevant  short -term outcomes.17, 19, 25-28 In our recent  analysis  of over 27,000  
patients  who underwent  coronary  angiography, a rise in SCr of 0.25 - 0.5 mg/dL  was associated  
with a prolongation in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69430].[ADDRESS_75751]-angiography  increase in SCr of ≥25%  or ≥0.5 mg/dL remained  in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  a mean  
of two days longer  than patients  without  such an increase in SCr.25 This extended  length  of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69431].27, 28 In our analysis  of 598 diabetics  with CKD  undergoing  coronary  
angiography, CIAKI  (defined  by a rise in SCr of ≥50%)  was independently  associated  with a 2- 
fold increase in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69432].27, 28 A study  by [CONTACT_69517]. that used a decision  analytic  
model  reported that CIAKI  results  in an average increase in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -related  costs  of more  than 
$10,300 and 1-year costs  in excess  of $11,800.[ADDRESS_75752]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”   
CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75753] of CIAKI of greater  than $1.2 billion.26, 29 Collectively,  these  
data indicate  that CIAKI  is associated  with prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69433],  underscoring the significant economic  implications  of this iatrogenic  
condition.  
 
c. Long -term adverse outcomes  associated with CIAKI  
In addition to increased  short -term complications, CIAKI defined  by [CONTACT_69518]-term mortality  in recent  studies  (Table  3). 21, 30-34 Solomon et al. 
demonstrated  that CIAKI  following  angiography  (defined  by [CONTACT_69516] ≥0.3 mg/dL ) 
was associated  with a greater  than 3-fold increased  risk of major  adverse  outcomes  (death,  
stroke, myocardial  infarction, end-stage  renal  disease requiring  renal  replacement  therapy)  at 1- 
year of follow  up.33 In an analysis  by [CONTACT_69519]. of 985 patients  who underwent  PCI, CIAKI  
(defined  by [CONTACT_69510] ≥0.5 mg/dL)  was independently  associated  with increased  
mortality  at 24 months  of follow -up (HR=2.6;  95% CI: 1.5-4.4).[ADDRESS_75754]  increased  long- term mortality  that did not reach  statistical 
significance in multivariable analyses.  21, 30, 32, 34

p=0.02).30 In a study by [CONTACT_69515]., patients  who developed CIAKI  (defined  by a rise in SCr of 
≥0.5 mg/dL)  had a 0.2 mg/dL  higher  mean  SCr at one month post-angiography  compared  to 
patients  who had not developed CIAKI (p=0.001).[ADDRESS_75758]  a ≥25%  reduction in eGFR  at 30 days compared  to patients  without  CIAKI (OR=5.5,  
95% CI: 2.2–13.3).35 Finally,  James  et al. recently  reported  that patients  who developed mild 
CIAKI following  coronary  angiography  had a nearly  5-fold increased  risk of experiencing  a

Patients  who developed more  severe CIAKI  had a greater  than 17-fold increased  risk of persistent  
renal  injury at 90 days following  angiography (adjusted OR=17.3, 95% CI: 12.0- 24.9), supporting  
a graded  relationship  between  the severity  of CIAKI  and risk for sustained  renal  damage at  
90 days. In this study,  CIAKI was also associated  with  an increased risk of accelerated  decline in 
kidney function, defined  as a loss of eGFR  >4 ml/min/1.73  m2 per year over 2-3 years  of follow  
up (OR=2.9, 95% CI: 2.2-3.7), as well as a markedly  increased  risk of ESRD  over this same  
period of follow -up (OR=13.8, 95% CI: 7.4–25.9).[ADDRESS_75759]  (e.g.,  post-cardiac

et al. demonstrated  that increases  in SCr of <0.6 mg/dL  following  cardiothoracic surgery  were  
independently  associated  with a nearly  2-fold increase in 30-day mortality  (HR=1.92,  95% CI: 
1.34- 2.77).38 Similarly,  in a study  of over  87,000 patients,  Newsome  and colleagues  demonstrated  
that increases  in SCr of 0.3 to 0.5 mg/dL  following  acute MI were independently  associated  
with an increased  risk for ESRD  (HR = 2.36, p<0.05)  and long-term mortality  (HR=

N-acetylcysteine (NAC).  
 
3. Intravenous  fluids  for the  prevention of  CIAKI  
Intravascular  volume  expansion with IV fluids  is believed  to have  two actions  that protect  
against  the development  of CIAKI.  First,  expansion of the intravascular  space is thought  to blunt  
the vasoconstrictive  effect  of contrast  on the renal  medulla  due to the suppression of vasopressin,  
inhibition of  the renin -angiotensin  axis, and increased  synthesis  of vasodilatory  renal  
prostaglandins.82-[ADDRESS_75768]  of IV fluid  alone  or in combination with IV mannitol  
or furosemide.79 Patients  with CKD undergoing  coronary  angiography  were randomized  to 
receive IV 0.45%  (half -isotonic)  saline  alone  prior  to and following  angiography  or in 
combination  with either  [ADDRESS_75769]  
administration.  The incidence of CIAKI  among  patients  who received  IV fluids  alone  was 11% 
compared  to 28% in the  IV fluid  plus mannitol group  and 40% in subjects who received  
furosemide  in addition  to IV fluids  (p=0.02 for comparison with IV fluid  alone).  While  this trial 
did not include  a control  group  of patients  who did not receive IV fluid, Trivedi  et al. 
subsequently  confirmed  the benefit  of IV fluid  in a small clinical  trial of patients  undergoing  
non-emergent  coronary  angiography.88 Subjects  in this study  were randomized  to receive either  
IV isotonic  saline  for 12 hours  prior  to and 12 hours  following  angiography  or unrestricted  oral 
fluids. The study  was stopped at an interim analysis  after 53 of 160 potential  subjects  had been 
enrolled  when  the rate of CIAKI  was found  to be nearly  10-fold higher  in the oral fluid  group 
compared  to the IV saline  group (34.6%  v. 3.7%, p=0.005).  The effect  of tonicity of  IV fluids  on 
the development  of CIAKI was assessed  by [CONTACT_69520].  Low-risk patients  
undergoing   coronary  angiography  were  randomized  to  receive  peri-procedural   IV  volume

expansion with either  0.45%  (half-isotonic)  saline  or 0.9%  (isotonic)  saline.89 The overall  rate of 
CIAKI was greater  in patients  who received  half-isotonic  saline  compared  to those  who were 
administered  isotonic  saline  (2% v 0.7%, P=0.04).  On the basis  of this study, it has generally  
been  accepted  that isotonic  saline is superior to hypotonic  saline for the  prevention of  CIAKI.  
 
a.         Clinical  trials  and meta -analyses  of bicarbonate versus  saline  to prevent  CIAKI  
Recent  research  on IV fluids  for the prevention of CIAKI  has focused  on identifying  the optimal  
fluid  composition;  specifically,  whether  isotonic  sodium  bicarbonate  (bicarbonate)  is superior  to 
isotonic  sodium  chloride  (saline)  for the prevention of CIAKI.  One of the principal  factors  
believed  to be associated  with the development  of CIAKI is the generation  of reactive oxygen  
species  (ROS)  in the kidney  following  contrast -induced  ischemic  injury  to renal  tubular  cells 
(see Figure  3 above).  Moreover, important  clinical  risk factors  for CIAKI,  including  chronic  
kidney  disease,  diabetes,  intravascular  volume  depletion,  and heart  failure  are themselves  
associated  with enhanced  ROS  formation.60, 90-[ADDRESS_75770],  ROS  are 
associated  with the depletion of intracellular  energy  stores  used for cellular  reparative 
processes.93, 94 Second,  ROS  may play an important  role in potentiating  intra-renal  ischemia  by 
[CONTACT_69521]/or  augmenting  the effects  of vasoconstrictors, including  isoprostane, angiotensin 
II, and endothelin- I.95-[ADDRESS_75771]  been  published in the peer-reviewed  
literature.  Six trials  demonstrated a lower  incidence  of CIAKI  with bicarbonate  administration,  
whereas  four showed no significant differences  (Table  4).24, 25, [ADDRESS_75772]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”

In an effort  to reconcile the incongruent  clinical  trial findings,  multiple  systematic  reviews  and 
meta -analyses  have  been performed  to analyze  the collective  results  of these studies.119, 121-137 In 
one of the more  recent  of these meta -analyses,  Kelly  and colleagues  included  26 trials  
encompassing  3,393 patients.138 Based  on the pooled data,  they calculated  a 38% reduction  in the 
risk of CIAKI  associated  with NAC  (RR=0.62;  95% CI: 0.44- 0.88). Although  the investigators  
reported  heterogeneity  among  the pooled studies, they found no evidence of publication  bias. In 
another  meta -analysis  of [ADDRESS_75777] described  the efficacy  of NAC  for the prevention of CIAKI  in humans  a decade 
ago.142 This trial randomized  83 patients  undergoing  computed tomography  to receive 600 mg of 
NAC  or placebo  twice  daily  on the day prior  to and the day of  the procedure.  Significantly  fewer  
subjects  treated  with NAC  developed CIAKI compared to patients  in the placebo  arm (2% v. 
21%, p=0.01). A multitude  of trials  evaluating  NAC for the prevention of CIAKI  have since been  
published and  have  yielded  highly  conflicting  results (Table 5).  23, 142-166

undergoing  angiography.168 While  this study  did not demonstrate  a benefit  to NAC  for the 
prevention  of CIAKI,  a small minority  of patient -participants  had underlying  CKD (N=367)  and 
hence,  most  were  at minimal  risk for renal  injury.  While  approximately  half of the trials  of NAC  
tracked  short -term need for dialysis,  few assessed  other  clinically -relevant,  adverse  outcomes  
such as death  or persistent  decline in kidney  function and none  were powered  to assess  the 
effectiveness  of NAC  in preventing  these  patient -centered  outcomes.  One trial by [CONTACT_69513]. 
demonstrated  that in addition  to preventing  CIAKI,  NAC  was associated  with a reduction in 
death  and the need for dialysis.[ADDRESS_75782]  media.169 In a recent  systematic  review  and meta -analysis  of IV sodium  
bicarbonate  for the prevention  of CIAKI,  Zoungas  et al. identified  four studies  which  included  
data on 983 patients  that evaluated  combined  treatment with sodium  bicarbonate  and NAC.118 
They  observed no difference in the incidence  of CIAKI  following  sodium  bicarbonate  
administration  with or without  concomitant  administration  of NAC  (p for heterogeneity  = 0.73).  
Similar results  were also  seen  in a meta -analysis  by [CONTACT_69522].[ADDRESS_75783] been relatively  small. The median  number  of patients  enrolled  in 
the trials  comparing  bicarbonate to saline was 184 (IQR  119, 265), while  the median  number  of 
patients  enrolled  in the trials  of NAC  was 96 (IQR  80, 183).  These  small  sample  sizes  mean  that 
the individual  studies  only had adequate  statistical power  to detect  clinical  effects  of such

CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75784]  a meaningful  clinical  benefit. These  limitations  were  
well summarized  by [CONTACT_69523]. in a 2006 review  of the use of NAC  in preventing  CIAKI:  
“…given  the clinical trial data published to date,  meta -analyses  cannot  resolve  the uncertainty  
engendered  by 19 small  [randomized  clinical  trials]  with heterogeneous  results  for a surrogate  
outcome  (change in serum  creatinine level  rather  than “harder” end points, such as need  for 
dialysis   or  mortality)…Ultimately,   a  much   larger  trial  with  high  methodologic   quality  that 
involved multiple  centers  to achieve sufficient power  to study  clinically  meaningful  outcomes  is 
needed…….”  170 We believe these comments  are equally  applicable to the primary  studies  and 
meta -analyses  comparing  bicarbonate to saline.  
 
C. Clinical implications  of the equipoise on the effectiveness  of bicarbonate and NAC  
The lack of consensus  on the role of bicarbonate and NAC  for the prevention of CIAKI  is 
evident  from  the inconsistent  use of prophylactic  regimens  in clinical  practice.  We recently  
completed  a prospective,  observational  study  of 239 Veterans  with CKD  who underwent  non- 
emergent  coronary  or non-coronary  angiography.171 Nearly  20% of patients  did not receive any 
peri-procedural   IV  fluid.   Of  patients   who  received   pre-procedure   IV  fluid,   66%  received  
bicarbonate  and 34% received  hypotonic  or isotonic  saline.  Of patients  who received  post- 
procedure  IV fluid,  44% were administered  bicarbonate  and 56% received  hypotonic  or isotonic  
saline.  One hundred and eighty -six (78%) of the 239 patients  received  NAC.  However,  24 (12%) 
patients  who received  NAC  did not receive any IV fluid,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_69435].  
 
In this same study,  we surveyed  87 VA providers  on their knowledge  of the effectiveness  of 
different  interventions  for the prevention  of CIAKI.172  Nearly  half of providers  (48%)  reported  
Weisbord  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”   
CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8

that bicarbonate  is ineffective  for the prevention of CIAKI  or were unsure  of its effectiveness,  
while  54% reported  NAC  to be effective,  24% reported  NAC  to be ineffective,  and 22% were  
unsure  of its effectiveness.  These  observations  reflect  the clinical  equipoise  on the comparative  
effectiveness  of bicarbonate  and saline  and benefit  of NAC.  
 
There are also data suggesting that that the failure  to establish  a solid  evidence basis  for the 
prevention  of CIAKI and  its adverse medical  outcomes has contributed to the  under -utilization  of 
clinically  indicated  coronary  angiograms  in patients  with CKD.  Chertow  and colleagues  
conducted an analysis  of more  than 55,[ADDRESS_75785] kidney  function.173 While  the provision of coronary  angiography  was 
associated  with a significant  reduction in mortality  (OR=0.62;  95% CI: 0.54- 0.70), those  with 
CKD deemed  to be appropriate  candidates  for this procedure  were less than half as likely  to 
undergo angiography  compared to patients  without  CKD (OR=0.47;  95% CI: 0.40- 0.52).  
Although  the authors  did not systematically  examine the reasons  for under -utilization  of 
angiography  in individuals  with CKD,  they posited that concern  for the development  of CIAKI  
may explain  this finding. A subsequent  study  by [CONTACT_69524]., which included 45,[ADDRESS_75786] elevation  MI, of whom  6,560  had moderate to advanced  CKD,  reported  that the presence 
of CKD  was independently  associated  with a nearly  50% decreased  likelihood of undergoing  
coronary  angiography  with  PCI  (adjusted   OR=0.52;   95%  CI:  0.34- 0.80).  The  investigators  
concluded that  fear of CIAKI  was a principal  reason  for this  finding.[ADDRESS_75787]  of whom  had CKD.  While  the 
use of coronary  angiography  in patients  with CKD  was associated  with a 36% lower  risk of in- 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69436],  considerably  fewer  patients  with CKD  underwent  this procedure  compared  to 
patients  without  CKD  (49.9%  v. 67.8%,  p<0.001).[ADDRESS_75788]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”

isotonic  sodium bicarbonate  rather  than IV isotonic  sodium chloride  (grade  2B 
recommendation),  yet recommends  against  the use of N-acetylcysteine (grade  2B 
recommendation)  for the prevention  of CIAKI.[ADDRESS_75789],  while  guidelines  from  the Kidney  
Disease:  Improving  Global  Outcomes  (KDIGO)  initiative  recommend  that providers  administer  
isotonic  IV crystalloid  to prevent  CIAKI,  they specifically  do not differentiate between  use of 
sodium  bicarbonate  or sodium  chloride  (grade  1A recommendation).177 Moreover,  the KDIGO 
guidelines  recommend  the use of NAC  (grade  2C recommendation)  for the prevention  of CIAKI.  
Thus,  two clinical  practice  guidelines  differ substantially  in regard  to their recommendations  for 
the use of bicarbonate  and NAC  to prevent  CIAKI.  
 
D. Summary  
CIAKI is a common  complication  of angiographic  procedures  in high-risk patients  and is 
associated  with serious  adverse outcomes. Greater  understanding  of its risk factors  and 
pathophysiology  has informed  research  on preventive  strategies.  Although the two most  
promising  preventive  interventions  are isotonic  sodium  bicarbonate and NAC,  multiple  clinical  
trials  evaluating  these interventions  have  yielded  highly  conflicting  results.  Past trials  have  been 
limited  by [CONTACT_69525];  the inclusion  of patients  at relatively  low risk for adverse  outcomes;  and the reliance on 
small and transient changes  in SCr as a surrogate  study  endpoint, rather  than clinically  
meaningful,  patient -centered  events.  Finally  and most  importantly,  past studies  of preventive  
strategies  were  not designed  or powered to determine  the impact  of bicarbonate  or NAC  on 
serious,  adverse,  patient -centered  outcomes.  The absence  of a consensus  on the benefit  of these 
interventions  has led to non-uniform  implementation  of these  measures  in clinical  practice and 
may be a factor  in the under -utilization  of clinically  indicated  and potentially  life-saving  
angiographic  procedures  in patients  with CKD.  Considered  collectively,  these observations  
underscore  the need  for a large,  adequately  powered, multicenter  clinical  trial to assess the 
effectiveness  of bicarbonate compared  to saline  and NAC  compared  to placebo  for the 
prevention  of serious,  adverse,  patient -centered  outcomes  in high-risk patients  undergoing  
angiographic procedures.

Within  the VA Healthcare System,  there are more  than 51,000 coronary  and non-coronary  
angiograms  performed  each year involving  Veterans  with chronic  kidney  disease (CKD).  As a 
result,  there  are likely  many  thousands  of Veterans  who develop  angiography -associated  CIAKI

V. OVERVIEW  OF STUDY DESIGN 
The proposed  comparative effectiveness  study  is a multicenter,  randomized,  double -blind  clinical  
trial that will use a 2 x 2 factorial  design  to assess the effectiveness  of IV isotonic  sodium  
bicarbonate  compared  to IV isotonic  saline  and NAC  compared  to placebo  for the prevention of 
serious,  adverse,  patient -centered  outcomes  in high-risk patients  undergoing  coronary  or non- 
coronary  angiography.  The primary  hypotheses  to be tested  are that isotonic  bicarbonate is more  
effective than saline  and that NAC  is more  effective than placebo  for the prevention of serious  
morbidity  and mortality  following  coronary  and non-coronary  angiography  in high-risk 
Veterans.  Each  of these two hypotheses  are of equal  importance  as there is clinical  equipoise  on 
both the comparative effectiveness  of bicarbonate  and saline  and the benefit  of NAC.  Moreover,  
despi[INVESTIGATOR_69438],  our data indicate  that as many  as 12% of high-risk Veterans  receive this anti-oxidant  in 
lieu of any IV fluids  (vide supra ).[ADDRESS_75796] underlying CKD  with  an eGFR  
<60 ml/min/1.73  m2 and a diagnosis  of diabetes  mellitus,  or an eGFR  <45 ml/min/1.[ADDRESS_75797] diabetes  mellitus.  Eligible  patients  who consent  to 
participate  will be randomized prior  to angiography  to receive:  1) IV isotonic  bicarbonate  or IV 
isotonic  saline  and 2) oral NAC  or oral placebo.  Randomization will be stratified  by [CONTACT_3725]. At least 
3 ml/kg  of the IV isotonic  study  crystalloid  solution (sodium  bicarbonate  or saline)  will be 
infused over a minimum  of 1 hour at an infusion rate of not less than 1 mL/kg  per hour and not 
more  than 3 mL/kg  per hour immediately  prior  to the angiographic  procedure;  1-1.5ml/kg  per 
hour will be infused during  angiography;  and at least 6 ml/kg  will be administered  during  over at 
least  2 hours  at an infusion rate of not less than 1 mL/kg  per hour and not more  than  3 mL/kg  
per hour following  the procedure. This approach  will ensure  the provision of a minimum necessary  
volume  of IV fluid, yet permit  providers  to administer  additional  study  IV fluid  as they deem  
clinically  appropriate  based  on their assessment  of individual  patients.  In patients who are obese 
(BMI >30 kg/m2) and weigh more than [ADDRESS_75798]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”   
CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/2019  Page 30   
 
 
The primary  study  outcome  will be a 90-day composite  end-point  comprised  of death,  need  for 
acute  dialysis,  or persistent  decline  in kidney function, defined  based  on an increase  in SCr at 90 
days of ≥50%  relative  to baseline . The development  of CIAKI,  defined  by [CONTACT_69516] 
≥0.5 mg/dL  and/or  ≥25% at [ADDRESS_75799]  administration  will be assessed  as a 
secondary  outcome. As additional  secondary  outcomes,  we will evaluate death,  the renal  
components  of the primary  composite  endpoint  (i.e., need  for acute dialysis,  persistent  decline in 
kidney  function), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69439]  (i.e., ACS,  HF, CVA),  and 
all-cause  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  We will assess  the development  of ESRD  and mortality  at 1 year as a 
tertiary  (exploratory) outcome.  
 
Based  on analyses  of over 25,000 Veterans  with CKD who underwent  angiography  within  the 
VA Healthcare System,  we estimate  that the baseline incidence of our primary  study  endpoint  
among  eligible  patients  is 8.7%.  Using  this rate in the control  arms  of our study  allows  us to 
more  conservatively  estimate  the overall  event  rate to be 7.6%. Considering  these estimates,  an 
intervention  effect  size of 25%, the absence  of an interaction  between  our two interventions, a 
two-sided  alpha  of 0.025, and anticipated  loss to follow -up of 3%, 7,680 patients  (1,920  patients  
per treatment  cell) will be required  to test the primary  hypothesis  with 90% power. Thirty -three  
VA sites will be expected  to enroll  an average of 100 patients  per year during  the 2½ year 
recruitment  period.

subsequent  adverse clinical  events  following  angiography  is the presence of decreased  kidney  
function,  and at any given  level  of kidney  function the risk is increased  in patients  with diabetes

B. Screening  and patient recruitment  
Requisite  waivers  of HIPAA  authorization  and informed consent  for screening  will be obtained  
in order  to allow  study  coordinators  to review  angiography  logs/schedules  in advance  to identify  
patients  scheduled  for coronary  or non-coronary  angiography  and assess their electronic  medical  
records  for eligibility.  After  the study  is introduced to the  patient  by [CONTACT_69529],  research  personnel  will contact  [CONTACT_69530].  
 
Based  on our past study  of Veterans undergoing  angiography  and recent  queries  of VA clinical  
sites nationwide, more  than 90% of patients  will have had a SCr measured  as part of routine  care

pregnancy  test before being  enrolled  in the  study.  
 
We believe  that even for urgent  angiograms  for indications  such as non-ST elevation  MI or 
peripheral  vascular  occlusion, there  will be sufficient time (>3 hours)  prior  to the procedure  to 
determine eligibility,  obtain  consent,  perform randomization,  and implement the study

VII. STUDY PROCEDURES  
A. Assessment of  pre-procedure renal  function  
Based  on the structure  of healthcare delivery within  the VA Healthcare System  in which  patients  
frequently travel  long distances  to large  VA Medical  Centers  for procedures  such as angiograms, 
the SCr measured  by [CONTACT_69531] a different  VA laboratory  than the SCr measured  by [CONTACT_69532]. While  an increasing  majority  of VA laboratories  are using  a standardized,  
IDMS -traceable method of measuring  SCr, not all VA laboratories  are using  this calibrated  
methodology. Therefore,  there may be inter-laboratory  variation  in SCr values  due to differences  
in laboratory  instrumentation and the lack of use of standardized  methods  of calibration. To 
reliably  and accurately  assess  the development  of persistent  decline in kidney  function  
(component  of the primary  endpoint)  and CIAKI  (secondary  endpoint), it is essential  that pre- 
and post-procedure  SCr measurements  for this purpose  be standardized.  We will therefore utilize  
a central  laboratory  to measure the pre-procedure  study  SCr and follow -up SCr values  for 
endpoint  ascertainment.  
 
The timing  of the pre-procedure  study  SCr (reference SCr)  measurement  used to assess  these  
outcomes  is also critical  as the administration  of IV fluids  may lead to hemodilution  and artifactual  
lowering  of SCr. In addition,  variation  in intravascular  volume  status  affects  renal  function, 
particularly  in patients  with underlying  CKD.  Therefore,  we will standardize  the timing  of 
assessment  of the reference SCr for endpoint  ascertainment.  This sample  will be obtained  
following  patient  enrollment  and immediately  prior  to the initiation  of study  IV fluids  and study  
drug capsules  to avoid  any potential  effects  of study interventions  on the baseline SCr level.  This 
reference SCr sample  will be distinct from  the baseline  pre-procedure  SCr measured  by [CONTACT_69533].  It 
is possible  that due to expected  variation in SCr levels  and measurements,  the baseline SCr used 
to determine eligibility  will differ from  the reference SCr such that patients  who meet  inclusion  
criteria  based  on the screening  SCr would  not have been  eligible  based  on the reference  SCr. 
Such  patients  will not subsequently  be excluded  or withdrawn from the  study.

B. Randomization  procedures  
All patients  meeting  eligibility  criteria  and providing  informed  consent  will be randomized  to 
each of the two study  interventions  (IV isotonic  bicarbonate versus  IV isotonic  saline  and NAC  
versus  placebo).  The 2 x 2 factorial  design  will result  in four discrete  treatment  combinations  
(bicarbonate/NAC,  bicarbonate/placebo,  saline/NAC  and saline/placebo).  Patients  will be 
allocated  in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_75812]  media  administered  during  angiography  and site-specific  
differences  in peri-procedural  provider  practices  such as discontinuation  of angiotensin  
converting  enzyme inhibitors,  angiotensin  receptor  blockers,  and diuretics.  
 
Study  coordinators  at each site will be responsible  for obtaining  a randomized  treatment  
assignment  for each eligible  patient.  A web-based  randomization  program  will be provided to 
study  sites for this purpose. This web-based  program  will be tested  at each site prior  to the start 
of the trial and will be reviewed,  as per Center  guidelines, by [CONTACT_69534]  (CSPCRPCC)  and the MAVERIC  CSPCC.  At the time of subject  
enrollment,  study  coordinators  will enter  the Subject  ID number  and study  site into the 
randomization  program.  The program  will check  that all eligibility  criteria are met. If met, the 
program  will select  the first unused entry  from  the pre-specified  list of random  treatment  
assignments  for the particular  site. The lists are stored  on a secure server  at the CSPCRPCC.  If 
the electronic system  fails,  the same  process  will be carried  out by [CONTACT_69535]. In such 
instances,  research  personnel  at the site will contact  [CONTACT_69536]  a manual  randomization. The eligibility  criteria  will be verified  by [CONTACT_69537].  
If eligible,  the random  treatment assignment  will be provided to research  personnel.  
 
C. Blinding  
Providers  performing  angiography, participating  patients,  personnel  at the study  chairmen's  
office,  and research  personnel  at each site will be blinded to treatment  assignment.  Study  IV

fluids  will be provided  in coded bags without  specific  labeling  on the bag regarding  the 
composition of the fluid.  The appearance of the sodium  bicarbonate  solutions  and sodium  
chloride  solutions  will be identical.  NAC  will be provided as 300 mg capsules  or matching  
placebo  capsules  prepared  by [CONTACT_69538], NM. The use of NAC  powder  as a capsule avoids  the difficulty  of masking the 
strong  odor and unpleasant taste associated  with  the liquid formulation  of NAC.  
 
D. Study  interventions  
In each of the four  study  arms,  patients  will receive a  combination  of the two interventions:  
 IV isotonic  sodium bicarbonate or  IV isotonic  saline  
 Oral NAC  or oral placebo  
 
 
1. IV fluids  
We will administer  ≥3 ml/kg  of study  IV fluid  over ≥1 hour at an infusion rate of not less than 1 
mL/kg  per hour and not more  than 3 mL/kg  per hour immediately  prior to the angiographic  
procedure,  1-1.5ml/kg  of study  IV fluid  per hour during  angiography, and ≥6 ml/kg  of study  IV 
fluid  over ≥ 2 hours  following  the procedure  at an infusion rate of not less than 1 mL/kg  per hour 
and not more  than  3 mL/kg  per hour.  Providers  will retain  discretion  to administer  larger  
volumes  of the randomly  allocated  study IV fluid  (up to a maximum of  12 mL/kg) over durations  
of up to [ADDRESS_75813]-procedure.  The protocol  will prohibit  the delivery  of 
smaller  volumes  of study  IV fluid  over shorter  durations  than the pre-specified  minimums  
described  above. In patients who are obese (BMI >30 kg/m2) and weigh more than [ADDRESS_75814]  not been  conclusively  determined. Although  there is a general  
belief  that “more  fluid”  is superior  to “less  fluid,”  this premise  has not been rigorously  tested.  
This uncertainty  is underscored by [CONTACT_69539]  a specific IV fluid  regimen.[ADDRESS_75815]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”

used variable rates of fluid  administration  ranging  from  3 mL/kg  for 1 hour pre-procedure  and

NAC  is associated  with minimal risk, while  up to 15% of patients  who receive IV NAC  experience  
an adverse  reaction,  which  rarely,  includes  anaphylaxis.187, [ADDRESS_75819]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”

demonstrate  that high osmolality  (>1200 mOsm/kg)  agents  pose a greater  risk for CIAKI than 
low osmolality  (500- 860 mOsm/kg)  agents  in high-risk patients.12, [ADDRESS_75821]  are conflicting  and 
inconclusive. To provide  care that is consistent  with prior  guidelines  issued  by [CONTACT_69540]/American  Heart  Association  for the use of iodinated contrast  in patients  
with CKD,  all patients  in this trial will receive either  iso-osmolal contrast  media  (i.e., iodixanol)  
or non-ionic,  low-osmolal  contrast  media  with a recommendation  to avoid  using  ioxaglate  and 
iohexol.[ADDRESS_75822]  agents  across  study  groups.  
 
We will recommend  to the treating  provider  that selective and non-selective non-steroidal  anti- 
inflammatory  medications  other  than once  daily  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_69442] 4days  following  angiography, as the use of these  medications  is believed  to increase  
the risk for CIAKI.183, 191 We will defer  decisions  on the discontinuation  of angiotensin  converting  
enzyme  inhibitors, angiotensin  receptor  blockers, and diuretics  to the treating  provider(s)  
because  there  are no conclusive  data on the optimal approach  to the management  of these 
medications  in patients  with  CKD undergoing  angiography.

Following  angiography  and prior  to discharge  from  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  study  coordinators  will provide  
the participant  with instructions  on how to take their study  medication  (i.e., NAC  or placebo  
capsules)  while  at home. Participants  will be given  a study  medication  diary  to record  the dates  
and number  of capsules  taken.  Participants  will be instructed  to notify  study  staff and bring 
their study  medication  with them  in the event  they require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Prior  to discharge,  
study coordinators  will also arrange the participant’s  blood  specimen  collection  4 days following 
their angiography.  Options for this blood draw may  include, but not be limited to: 1) returning 
to the study VA; 2) having a mobile phlebotomy service draw the blood; or 3) having the blood 
drawn at  a non- study VA site such as a Community -Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) or another 
VA facility closer to the participant’s home . 
  
G. Study  Outcomes  
1. Conceptual  basis  for study  outcomes  
Nearly  all clinical  trials  of IV fluid  and NAC  for the prevention of CIAKI  utilized  the surrogate  
endpoint  of change  in SCr within  [ADDRESS_75825] the hypothesis  that these  interventions  prevent  serious, adverse downstream  
outcomes. While  there  is a strong  association  between  small  changes  in SCr within  days of 
angiography  and adverse downstream  outcomes, not all epi[INVESTIGATOR_69443]  (Figure  4). For this reason,  the primary  objective  of this trial is to evaluate 
whether  bicarbonate  (as compared  to saline)  and NAC  (as compared  to placebo)  reduce  the 
incidence  of serious, adverse patient -centered  outcomes. We postulate  that the beneficial  effects  
of bicarbonate  and NAC  on adverse  downstream  outcomes  will be mediated  specifically  by 
[CONTACT_15276] a reduction  in the  incidence of  CIAKI.

2. Primary  study  outcome  
The primary  outcome  will be a composite  
of serious,  adverse,  patient -centered  
events,  including  death,  need  for acute 
dialysis,  or persistent  decline  in kidney  
function  within  90 days following  
angiography. These  outcomes, which  we 
refer to as major  adverse kidney  events  and 
death  (MAKE -D) will be defined  as 
follows:  
 Death  based  on medical  record  
and/or  vital status registry  
documentation. 
 Need  for acute dialysis  defined  as 
the initiation  of any modality  of 
renal          replacement          therapy  Figure  4 - Conceptual  basis  for primary  outcomes  
(intermittent hemodialysis,  peritoneal  dialysis,  continuous  renal  replacement  therapy,  or 
sustained  low-efficiency  dialysis) within  90 days of the index  angiographic procedure.  
 Persistent  decline  in kidney  function  defined by [CONTACT_69541] 50% at 90 days following  the index angiographic  procedure.  This 
outcome  will be based  on a comparison  of the pre-angiography  and 90-day SCr values  
analyzed  at the central  laboratory.  
 
3. Justification  for components of  the primary  endpoint  
We selected  the individual  components  of the primary  endpoint  based  on the biologically  and 
clinically  plausible  link between  the development  of CIAKI and these clinically -relevant  
downstream  events. Each  of the components  of the primary  outcome  is a recognized  
complication  of CIAKI  and analyses  of our database  of over 25,000 Veterans  with CKD  who 
underwent  coronary  angiography  demonstrate  that patients  who developed CIAKI following  
angiography  were four times  more  likely than  patients  without  CIAKI  to experience one or more

of the events  that comprise  our primary  endpoint. Prevention of CIAKI will likely  decrease the 
incidence of  each  of these  downstream  outcomes.  
 
a. Justification  for inclusion  of death  in primary endpoint  
Multiple  prior  studies  (vide supra)  have  demonstrated  an association  of CIAKI with death.11, 16, 
19, 21, [ADDRESS_75826]  serious  outcome  and a competing  event,  
and is therefore important to include in our  composite endpoint. 
 
b. Justification  for inclusion  of acute dialysis  in primary endpoint  
The need for dialysis  as a component  of our primary  composite  outcome  refers  to acute dialysis  
that may or may not lead to the chronic  long-term requirement  for renal  replacement  therapy.  
Given  that we are proposing  to enroll  patients  with Stage  3 and Stage  4 CKD  (baseline  eGFR  15- 
60 ml/min/1.73  m2), it would  be unexpected  for these  patients  to progress  to ESRD  and need 
chronic  dialysis  within  the 90-day follow -up period without  an acute  change  in the trajectory  of 
their chronic  kidney  disease.  For patients  who require  acute dialysis  in the setting  of AKI,  failure  
to recover  kidney  function within  90 days is the conventionally  accepted  transition  from  acute  
dialysis  to end-stage  renal  disease  and "chronic"  dialysis.193, [ADDRESS_75827]  administration  as a component  of the primary  outcome  in this study  is, by 
[CONTACT_108],  acute  dialysis.  Patients  who require  acute dialysis  following  an epi[INVESTIGATOR_69445]:  i) experience  a full or partial  recovery  of kidney  function obviating  the need for continued  
dialysis  therapy;  ii) develop  ESRD  necessitating  chronic  renal  replacement  therapy;  or iii) die 
within  [ADDRESS_75828]/chronic dialysis.  While CIAKI  resulting  in 
death  or the need  for chronic  dialysis  (i.e., ESRD)  is relatively  uncommon, the clinical  
significance  of such outcomes  is unequivocal. Less well recognized  are the important  adverse  
short  and long-term implications  of AKI that requires  acute transient  dialysis.  Acute temporary  
dialysis,  either  with intermittent  hemodialysis  or continuous  renal  replacement  therapy,  is 
associated  with important  short -term adverse outcomes, including  bleeding  and blood -borne  
infection  related  to dialysis  catheter  placement,  hemodynamic  instability  due to fluid and solute  
shifts  during  the dialysis  procedure,  and financial  costs  that may exceed  $500 to $1,[ADDRESS_75829]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”

sustained  dialysis -requiring  AKI,  of whom  295 (42%)  died,  65 (9%) remained  chronically  dialysis  
dependent,  and 343 (49%)  recovered  sufficient kidney  function to be able to discontinue  dialysis  
by [CONTACT_69543][INVESTIGATOR_47850].  In multivariate  analyses,  AKI requiring  transient  dialysis  
was associated  with a 28-fold increased  risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_69447],  defined as a decline  
in kidney  function to an eGFR  ≤30 ml/min/1.73m2, and a 2-fold increase  risk of death  
over [ADDRESS_75831]  associations  of CIAKI with persistent  renal  injury  
and with an acceleration  in the long-term rate of decline in kidney  function.24, 30, 197 We propose  
to include persistent renal injury  at 90 days following  angiography,  defined  by [CONTACT_69544] ≥50%, in our primary  composite  endpoint.  In preliminary  analyses,  we found  
that the development  of CIAKI following  angiography  was associated  with a prognostically  
meaningful,  greater  than 2-fold increase in the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a ≥50%  increase in SCr at 90 
days (OR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.9-3.0) confirming  the strong link between  CIAKI  and persistent  renal  
injury    at    90 
days.  
However,  in

confirm  the

significance  of this level  of persistent  decline in kidney  function  at 90 days following  
angiography  and justify  its inclusion  in our primary  endpoint, we performed  more  long-term 
follow -up of over 25,000 Veterans  with CKD  who underwent  coronary  or non-coronary  
angiography  within  the VA Healthcare System.  Using  this VA database, we examined  the 
associations  of variable  threshold increases  in SCr at 90 days with adverse  1-year outcomes  (i.e., 
death,  need for dialysis,  or doubling  in SCr) (Table  7). While  increases  in SCr at 90 days of 25% 
to 50% and >25%  were associated  with increased  risk for each of these adverse 1-year outcomes,  
the risk of these  long- term events  increased  markedly  among  patients  with a >50%  increase in 
SCr at 90 days.  Compared to patients  who did not experience a ≥50%  increase in SCr at 90 days 
following  angiography,  patients  who developed  a ≥50%  increase in SCr at 90 days were nearly 6  
times  more  likely  to die, develop the need for dialysis,  and/or  experience a doubling  in SCr 
within  one year (Table 7). Collectively,  these data confirm  the strong association  between  CIAKI  
and a ≥50%  increase in SCr at [ADDRESS_75833],  this represents  a period of time during  which  adverse  outcomes  are more  likely  than not to 
be associated  with the index  angiographic  procedure.  Second, 90 days is commonly  used in 
clinical  practice and  is proposed by  [CONTACT_69545]:  Improving  Global Outcomes  Foundation  
and the National  Kidney  Foundation to define  the transition  between  acute and chronic  
impairment in kidney  function. Therefore,  persistent  decline in kidney  function measured  at 90- 
days after the  index  angiographic procedure  likely  represents  irreversible renal  damage.  
 
4. Secondary  study  outcomes  
The secondary  outcomes  consist  of: 
 CIAKI defined  by [CONTACT_69516] ≥0.5 mg/dL  and/or  ≥25%  from  the pre-procedure  
value at  4 days  following angiography.  
 Death  within  [ADDRESS_75834]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”   
CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/2019  Page 46   
 
 
 The renal  components  of the primary  endpoint:  
o Need  for acute dialysis  within 90 days  of the index  angiographic procedure  
o Persistent  decline  in kidney  function at 90 days following  the index angiographic  
procedure  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69422], heart  failure,  or cerebrovascular  accident  
within  90 days following  the index  angiographic  procedure. These outcomes  will be 
defined  as a primary  or secondary  discharge diagnosis  of acute coronary  syndrome  (i.e., 
STEMI,  NSTEMI,  unstable  angina), heart  failure,  or cerebrovascular  accident  
documented  in the VA electronic  medical  record  or the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69448]-VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  (This  will include  the occurrence of any of these  
events  during  the index  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
 All-cause re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69449]  90 days of the index  angiographic  procedure  assessed  
as epi[INVESTIGATOR_69450]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (inclusive  of the index 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), and  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69451]  (alive and  not in the  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) through  day 90. 
 
Because AKI can occur  following  angiography  for reasons  unrelated  to the administration  of 
iodinated contrast,  in a sensitivity  analyses,  we will also evaluate the development  of CIAKI  
using  the same threshold change in SCr, but excluding  patients  who experienced  hypotension  
and/or  who underwent  cardiac surgery  or non-cardiac vascular  surgery  within  the 4 days 
following  angiography.  
 
5. Tertiary  (exploratory)  outcomes  
 Development  of end-stage  renal  disease  within  one year following  angiography  defined  
by [CONTACT_69546] ≥3 months  based  on documentation in the 
United  States  Renal  Data System  database.  
 Death  within  one year following  angiography based  on documentation in the VA 
Beneficiary  Identification  and Records  Locator  System,  the National  Center  for Health  
Statistics  National  Death  Index  database,  the Social  Security  Administration’s  Death

Prior to  the initiation  of study  IV fluids,  the subject  will be asked  to provide  a blood sample  
for Scr testing  at the designated  Central  Laboratory.  We will collect  the date of this blood draw  
and whether it was  collected  prior to the  initiation  of study  IV fluids.  
In addition to the blood draw,  subjects  will be asked  to provide  a urine  sample  to measure 
urine  albumin  and creatinine.  In the event the patient cannot provide urine prior to the angiogram, 
they will be asked to provide a urine specimen after the angiogram.  
3. Evaluation  of procedure -related  data 
Subsequent  to the angiogram,  research  personnel  will review  the electronic medical  record  and

 Type of  angiography  
 Indication  for coronary  angiography 
 Type  and total volume  of contrast  administered.  If ioxaglate  (Hexabrix)  or iohexol

to provide  a blood  sample  4 (±1) days following  the angiogram .  Options for this blood draw may  
include, but not be limited to: 1) returning to the study VA; 2) having a mobile phlebotomy 
service draw the blood;  or 3) having the blood drawn at a non- study VA site such as a 
Community -Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) or another VA facility closer to the  participant’s 
home.  
 
We chose  this time frame  to assess  post-procedure  renal  function as almost  all patients  who 
develop  CIAKI have  an elevated  SCr within  [ADDRESS_75843] 4 (±1)  
days following  angiography, a blood sample  will be drawn  at 4 (±1) days post-procedure.  One 
aliquot  of this sample  will be sent to the  central  study  laboratory  for subsequent analysis  for the 
development  of CIAKI,  while  a second  aliquot  will be delivered  to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69464]  a post-procedure rise in SCr. 
 
To ensure  patient  safety  and assist  providers, research  personnel  will notify  the provider  who 
performed  the angiography  that a 4 (±1) days SCr will be processed  in the VA laboratory  as part 
of the study  and will send an encrypted  email  to the patients’  primary  provider  describing  the 
results  of this 4 (±1) days  post-procedure SCr  within  [ADDRESS_75844].  
 
Since this creatinine determination is part  of the secondary  end-point, it is  very important  that the  
blood collection  be done  at 4 (±1) days after angiography. We recognize  that unforeseen  
circumstances  may preclude  collection  within  this window.  Under  such circumstances  the blood  
should be collected  as soon as possible  and most  proximate  to [ADDRESS_75845]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”

 ([ADDRESS_75847] angiography)  
Five days post-angiography, research  personnel  will review  the electronic medical  record  and 
perform  a structured  telephone  interview  with the patient.   For patients  who remain  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69465], research  personnel  will speak  with them  in-person. Beginning  on the  day of the 
patient’s  angiography, the date and number  of NAC/placebo  capsules  taken  will be documented.  
Reasons  for non-compliance will be collected.  Research  personnel  will also review  the EMR  to 
verify  that NAC/placebo  was administered  appropriately  (at least one hour prior  to the procedure  
and then again  at least one hour following  the procedure)  on the day of the angiography  procedure.  
 
During  the EMR  review  and follow -up call (or visit to the patient  in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]), research  
personnel  will inquire  about  any adverse events  the patient  experienced,  including  any 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69466].  To assess  the adequacy  of patient  blinding  to the 
interventions, research  personnel  will also ask participants  to guess  which  IV fluid  arm of the 
study  they were assigned  to and  whether they received  NAC  or placebo  capsules.

Since  this creatinine determination  is part of the primary  end-point, it is very important  that the

This 90-day SCr value  will be used to assess  for evidence  of persistent  decline  in kidney  
function. In subjects  with a ≥50% increase  in SCr between  their baseline  and 90 day 
measurements,  a confirmatory  SCr measurement  will be obtained. Options for this blood draw 
may include, but not be limited to: 1) returning to the study VA; 2) having a mobile phlebotomy 
service draw the blood; or 3) having the blood drawn at a non- study VA site such as a  
Community -Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) or another VA facility closer to the pa rticipant’s 
home .  For purposes  of determining whether  the endpoint  of a ≥50% increase in SCr at 90 days 
(persistent  decline  in kidney  function)  has been  met, both SCr values  will need  to be ≥50% 
higher  than baseline  and mean  of these two SCr will be used. If the 50% increase is confirmed,  
research  personnel  will notify  the patient’s  primary  care provider using an institutionally

CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75861] leading  to serious,  adverse  downstream  
outcomes.  While  we postulate  that CIAKI mediates  serious,  adverse  downstream  events,  we 
recognize  that it is possible  that the small  changes  in kidney  function that define  CIAKI may 
simply  represent  a marker  of underlying  cardiac and/or  vascular  disease  and reflect  pre- 
procedure  risk for morbidity  and mortality.  Thus, it is possible  that the proposed interventions  
may reduce the incidence of CIAKI,  defined  by [CONTACT_69558], but not affect  the incidence  of 
serious,  adverse,  patient -centered  outcomes.  While  this outcome  might  be viewed  as 
disappointing, we believe that such a finding  would be extremely  significant and would  have  a 
substantial impact  on clinical  care and  resource allocation.  
 
Similarly,  we recognize  that post-angiography  AKI has etiologies  other  than iodinated  contrast,  
most  notably  hypotension and atheroembolic  disease.  Our interventions  are unlikely  to impact  
the development  of AKI in such cases.  To address  this possibility,  we will conduct  sensitivity  
analyses  in which  we will evaluate the development  of CIAKI  using the same threshold change  
in SCr, but exclude  patients  who experienced  hypotension, underwent  cardiac or non-cardiac  
vascular  surgery  within  the 4 days following  angiography, and/or  had a documented  cause for 
acute kidney  injury  in the primary  or secondary  discharge diagnoses,  other  than contrast  
associated  AKI.  
 
2. Effectiveness  of Bicarbonate and  NAC  
Our hypotheses  that bicarbonate  (compared  to saline)  and NAC  (compared  to placebo)  will 
decrease the incidence  of serious,  adverse 90-day outcomes  are based  on the purported  
effectiveness  of these interventions  in preventing  the short -term changes  in SCr that define  
CIAKI.  We recognize that if bicarbonate  (compared  to saline)  and NAC  (compared  to placebo)  
are not effective for the prevention of CIAKI,  we are unlikely  to observe  an effect  of these

would result  in the need  to recruit  a considerably  larger  number  of participants  and would likely  
add complexity  to and decrease the feasibility  of the study. We chose  to define  our patient  
population as being  at high-risk based  on the  presence of underlying  chronic  kidney  disease,  with 
diabetes  serving  as an amplifier  of risk in the setting  of impaired  renal  function. We chose  this 
approach because chronic  kidney  disease  is commonly  cited  as the primary  risk factor  for 
CIAKI,   is  easily  assessed,   and  is  present   in  a  large   proportion  of  patients   undergoing 
angiographic  procedures.21, 183  We recognize that other  clinical  conditions  (e.g.,  heart  failure,  
intravascular  volume  depletion)  are also associated  with an increased  risk for CIAKI  and adverse,  
downstream  outcomes  and could  be used to define  a study  population as high-risk. However,  
assessment  of the presence  and severity  of heart  failure  and intravascular  volume  depletion  
is somewhat  subjective and therefore more  difficult to protocolize.  
 
C. Study  interventions  
1. Fluid administration  
There  is no consensus  among  experts  on the optimal  rate and duration of IV fluid  administration  
for the prevention  of CIAKI  or single  protocol  for the administration  of IV fluid  that has been 
shown  to be the most  effective.  Individual  patient  circumstances  and provider  preferences  
commonly  dictate the volume  and duration of IV fluids  administered.  We anticipate  that some  
providers  might  be unwilling  to have  their patients  participate  in this trial if they have  no control  
over the rate or duration of IV fluid  administration  in their patients. For  these reasons,  rather than  
adopting  one of the multitude  of fluid administration  protocols  employed  in prior  clinical  trials  
for the prevention of CIAKI,  the planning  committee  decided  that a more  flexible  approach  that 
specified  a minimum volume  and duration  of administration  of IV fluids  would  be more  
acceptable to providers  without  deviating  from  what  would  be considered appropriate  preventive  
care.  While  we believe that this approach will provide  a volume  of IV fluid  that is comparable to 
that used in most  recent  trials  comparing  bicarbonate  and saline,  it is possible  that this strategy  
could result  in systematic  differences  in the rate and duration  of fluid administration  in patients  
randomized  to bicarbonate  and saline.  While  this is very unlikely  given  the large  trial size and 
blinding  of fluid composition,  we will closely  monitor  duration  and volumes  of fluid 
administration  across  groups.

CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/2019  Page 60   
 
 
2. Complications  of fluid administration 
We anticipate  that some  patients  will develop volume  overload/pulmonary  edema and/or  
elevated  left ventricular  end-diastolic  pressure  during  angiography. In such instances,  providers  
performing  angiography  may discontinue  post-procedure  IV fluids  resulting  in patients  failing  to 
receive  study  IV fluid  following  the angiogram. It is likely  that this event  will occur  in a small  
proportion of patients  and be equally  distributed  across  treatment arms.  While  the volume  of 
study  IV fluid  administered  pre, during  and post-procedure  will be carefully  recorded  for all 
patients,  given  the importance  of patient  safety,  we believe  it would  be inappropriate  to require  
the administration  of post-procedure  study  IV fluid  in such instances.  Since  all analyses  will be 
based  on the  intent -to-treat principle,  these patients will  not be  excluded from  the study  analyses.  
 
3. Route  and dose  of NAC  administration  
There is currently  no universally  accepted  protocol  for the route  of administration  of NAC  for 
the prevention  of CIAKI.  While  most  prior  studies  used oral NAC,  a small  number  of studies  
administered  NAC  intravenously.23, 153, 157, 162, 164, [ADDRESS_75864]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”   
CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75865]  contributes  to, or is a marker  of renal  injury,  the planning  committee  felt that 
extending  the administration  of oral NAC  to 5 days could  be beneficial  with little to no safety  
risk. Unlike  the safety  of longer  duration NAC,  extending  the duration of IV fluids  poses  a risk 
for volume  overload/pulmonary  edema,  would  require  prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  and could  be 
viewed  unfavorably  by [CONTACT_69559]. There was consideration given  to providing  
oral sodium  bicarbonate  and oral sodium  chloride  tablets  for [ADDRESS_75866] to be given daily,  which  would  pose safety  
concerns  regarding exacerbation  of heart  failure  and/or  worsening  of hypertension.  While  lower  
doses  of oral sodium  bicarbonate  and sodium  chloride  could be used,  there  are no preliminary  
clinical  data to support  this approach  for the prevention of CIAKI or serious,  adverse  
downstream  outcomes.  Therefore,  although  we extended  the use of NAC  to 5 days,  our 
bicarbonate/saline  intervention  will be limited  to IV fluid  administration  in the immediate  peri- 
procedural  period.  
 
5. Potential  for interaction  between  bicarbonate and  NAC  
Implicit in our use of a [ADDRESS_75867]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”   
CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/2019  Page 62   
 
 
sodium  bicarbonate  administration  with or without  concomitant  administration  of NAC  (p for 
heterogeneity  = 0.73)  in four studies  which  included data on 983 patients.118 Similarly,  Brown  
and colleagues  found that combination treatment  of NAC  with IV sodium  bicarbonate  reduced  
CIAKI by 35% compared to NAC  with saline  in a meta -analysis  of [ADDRESS_75868]  taken this into consideration in 
our statistical analysis  (vide infra ); as designed,  the study  will retain  greater  than 80% statistical  
power even in the  presence of  a 50%  attenuation in effect  with  combined  therapy.  
 
D. Selection  of the primary  study  outcome  
We recognize that there are potential  pi[INVESTIGATOR_69470],  and drawbacks  to the specific components  of our proposed primary  composite  
outcome.[ADDRESS_75869]  of interventions  to prevent  CIAKI  on one 
component  of this outcome:  persistent  decline in kidney  function. Second, there may be 
disproportionate  event  rates for the individual  components  of the primary  endpoint, although our 
preliminary  analyses  of existing  data suggest  that the incidence  of each of the three  components  
of the primary  composite  outcome  occur  with reasonably  similar  frequency.  Third, we do not 
include  major  adverse cardiovascular  events  (e.g., acute coronary  syndrome, heart  failure,  
cerebrovascular  accident)  in the primary  endpoint.  Although  these  outcomes  are of great  clinical  
importance, they may primarily  occur  independent  of the development  of CIAKI  in our study  
population. Moreover,  we were concerned  that any reduction  in these events  as a result  of our 
study  interventions  would  be masked  by a high rate of these events  that occurred  independent  of 
the interventions. Thus,  we decided  not to include  these  cardiovascular  events  in the primary  
study  endpoint, but will assess them  as a secondary  outcome.

E. Ascertainment of  baseline kidney  function  
In order  to ascertain  a change  in kidney  function, it is critical  to standardize  the definition  of 
baseline  kidney  function.  SCr often  fluctuates  over time because of variations  in volume  status,  
protein  and salt intake,  and drift in the calibration  of laboratory  instruments. The specific  timing  
of the SCr used to screen  patients  is less critical  than the value  used to define  the baseline SCr 
for endpoint  ascertainment.  For practical  purposes, we propose  to screen  patients  based  on a SCr 
obtained as part of routine  clinical  care performed  by [CONTACT_102]’s  provider  within  the 30 days 
prior  to angiography. This will not be the same pre-angiography  study  SCr (reference SCr)  that 
will be used to assess the development  of persistent  decline  in kidney  function (component  of the 
primary  endpoint)  or to assess the development  of CIAKI (a secondary  endpoint). As a result,  
some  patients  who are found to be  eligible  and enrolled  in the  study  based  on the  eGFR  
calculated  from  the SCr performed  as part of routine  clinical care will subsequently  have an 
eGFR  calculated  from  the pre-angiography  study  (reference)  SCr measured  at the central  
laboratory  that is >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (diabetic  patients)  or >45 mL/min/1.73  m2 (non-diabetic 
patients).  While  we do not anticipate  that there will be many  cases  in which  this discrepancy  
occurs,  patients  with such differences  between  the screening  and pre-angiography  study  eGFR  
will not be excluded  as the risk of CIAKI with progressive  CKD  is continuous  and does not 
increase in a step-wise fashion as transitions  between  CKD  stages  occur. For example,  the risk of 
CIAKI  for  a  diabetic  patient   with  an  eGFR   of  61  ml/min/1.73  m2   (i.e.,  stage   2  CKD)   is 
comparable to that of a diabetic  patient  with an eGFR  of 59 ml/min/1.73  m2 (i.e., stage  3 CKD).  
Thus,  we anticipate  that including  the small number  of study  patients  who are deemed  eligible  
based  on their screening  eGFR  but whose  baseline  study  SCr corresponds  to an eGFR  greater  
than the inclusion  criteria  will have  minimal  impact  on our event  rate estimates.  We believe that 
it is critical  to use a central  laboratory  to ascertain  the reference and endpoint  SCr values  to 
minimize  variation  related  to drift in instrument calibration.  Samples  for reference and endpoint  
ascertainment  on a single  patient  will be run sequentially  on the same analyzer  to minimize  
issues  related  to drift  in calibration.  While  this introduces  issues  related  to sample  storage,  SCr is 
known to be  stable over time  in samples  stored  at -[ADDRESS_75870]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”   
CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75871] studies  demonstrate  that some  patients  who develop  
CIAKI  may not be identified  by a single  SCr assessment  at 48 hours.68 The optimal timing  of 
assessment  of SCr following the index  angiogram  to assess  for the development  of CIAKI  in 
our trial was carefully  considered by [CONTACT_69560].  While  it was agreed  that multiple  
SCr assessments (e.g.,  at 2 days and 4 days)  would ensure  the identification  of all patients  
who developed CIAKI,  we ultimately  determined  that a single  assessment  at [ADDRESS_75872] of more than $350,000 for  each  additional  SCr assessment.  
 
1.        Assessment  of cardiovascular outcomes  
We acknowledge the potential limitations  of using administrative  data/medical  records  for the 
assessment  of cardiovascular  outcomes,  including heart  failure,  acute MI and stroke.  We will 
assess these  outcomes  by [CONTACT_69561][INVESTIGATOR_69471].  We considered  the possibility  
of adjudicating  the secondary  outcomes  using  more  comprehensive  medical  record  review.  
However,  we believe that while  this would  be a more  robust  approach, the additional  time,  effort  
and cost required  to adjudicate  these secondary  outcomes  using  a comprehensive  review  of the 
medical  record  was not justified.  
 
G. Inclusion of  a cost -effectiveness  analysis and return  on the investment  to the VA  
While  the inclusion  of an economic  analysis  as part of this trial was strongly  considered,  we 
ultimately  decided  that the addition  of economic  data collection  would  detract  from  the primary  
Weisbord  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”   
CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75873] of tracking  patients’  health resource  utilization both within  and outside  the VA for 
an extended  period  of time (90 days),  it was felt that including an economic  analysis  as part of 
this proposal  was not advisable.  If bicarbonate  and/or  NAC  reduce the incidence  of serious  
downstream  outcomes  following angiography  as we hypothesize,  there will likely  be little reason  
to question their cost-effectiveness  considering  their low cost. That is, the effectiveness  of the 
interventions  will dominate the  associated  costs.  
 
While  the cost of this trial is substantial,  there will be a clear  return  on the investment  to the VA 
whether  the trial results  are positive  or negative.  After  consulting with a series  of pharmacists,  
we conservatively  assume  an incremental  cost of preparing  bicarbonate  and NAC  of $20 
compared  to the use of saline  and non-use of NAC.  Using  conservative  estimates  of the number  
of angiograms  performed  in patients  at high-risk for CIAKI,  published costs  of a single  epi[INVESTIGATOR_69472],  and the incidence of this condition,  demonstrating  an absolute  reduction in the  
incidence  of CIAKI by 3% with bicarbonate  or NAC  will result  in the study  paying  for itself  
within  1.3 years  considering  the costs  to the VA and within  1 month considering  the costs  for all 
US health  care (Table 8).

 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75880],  it will prevent  the widespread  use of ineffective measures  (i.e., bicarbonate  
and NAC)  in perpetuity  without  an evidence  basis  to support  their use. Second,  it will prevent  
needless  delays  in the performance  of angiographic  procedures  in urgent  and emergent  cases  
while  awaiting  bicarbonate  and NAC  preparation  and administration.  It is also important  to note 
that these estimates  of the return  on the investment  do not take into account  the impact  our 
findings  are likely  to have on preventive  care provided to the large  number  of high-risk patients  
undergoing  contrast -enhanced  computed  tomography both within  and outside  the VA Healthcare 
System.  As our findings  are highly  likely  to be translated  to this large  population of patients,  the 
return  on the investment  to the VA and US health  care overall  is surely  to be even  greater  than 
projected  in Table  8. 
 
H. Secular trends  in the prevention  and incidence  of CIAKI  
We acknowledge  that it is possible  that there  will be new knowledge  gained  and changes  in 
practice patterns  related  to the prevention  of CIAKI and serious  adverse outcomes  following  
angiography  during  the conduct  of the proposed trial. A comparison of the incidence of CIAKI  
reported  in studies  conducted  in the 1980s  to the incidence  described  in recent  studies  reveals  a 
trend  toward  fewer  patients  experiencing  this iatrogenic  complication.  However,  much  of this 
trend  is likely  related  to the transition  from  the more  nephrotoxic  high-osmolal contrast  agents  to 
low and iso-osmolal contrast  agents.  Over  the past decade,  there  is no evidence  of a continued 
decline in the incidence  of CKAKI or attenuation  in the relationship  between  CIAKI  and serious, 
adverse outcomes.  This is best illustrated  by a recent  study  of over 1,[ADDRESS_75881] -enhanced  procedures  that demonstrated  that CIAKI developed in over 
40% of patients  and was associated  with a 2-fold increase in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69474] a 10-fold 
increase in mortality.[ADDRESS_75882]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”   
CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75883],  it is widely  viewed  that the primary  intervention with documented 
effectiveness  for the prevention  of CIAKI  is IV administration  of isotonic  crystalloid.  A 
randomized  clinical  trial by [CONTACT_69562]. demonstrated that high-risk patients  who received  IV 
isotonic  saline  at the time of angiography  were at markedly  lower  risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_69475] (RR=0.11, 95% CI: 0.02- 0.8).[ADDRESS_75884]  of care for the prevention of CIAKI  and 
withholding  such treatment  in a clinical  trial is unlikely  to be approved by [CONTACT_69563]  (IRB).  Second,  all but one of the published trials  investigating  NAC  for the 
prevention  of CIAKI were  performed  in conjunction with the administration  of IV fluids.23, 142, 
144, 146-151, 153-158, 160-[ADDRESS_75885]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”   
CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75886],  the proportion of potentially  
eligible  patients  we will need  to recruit  in order  to meet  enrollment  targets  is relatively  small.  
Approximately 47,000 Veterans  who would meet  eligibility  criteria  for our study  undergo  
coronary  or non-coronary  angiography  each year within  the VA Healthcare  System,  of whom  
27,000 (57%)  undergo  these  procedures  at the [ADDRESS_75887]  VA Medical  Centers.  The number  of 
angiographic  procedures  performed  on an annual  basis  in potentially  eligible  patients  at these 33 
centers  ranges  from  a minimum of 519 to a maximum of 1,504. Assuming the need  to enroll  an 
average of 2 patients  per week  (100/year),  successful  recruitment  of 6.7%  of patients  from  the 
busiest  center  and 19% of patients  from  the 33rd  busiest  center  would  ensure  the attainment of 
our target  recruitment  goal. Even  if our estimate  of the number  of potentially  eligible  subjects  
was 25% lower  than projected,  we would  need to recruit  no more  than 26% of subjects  from  the 
33rd busiest  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  In the event  that not all of these  33 centers  were  able to participate  in the 
study  and certain  of the 14 VA Medical  Centers  (sites  34-47) with the next highest  volume  of 
angiographic  procedures  were selected  as sites,  we would  need  to recruit  no more  than 25% of 
potentially  eligible  patients  from  the 47th busiest  VA Medical  Center  to meet  the target  of [ADDRESS_75888], unlike  
trials  that recruit  from  a diverse  array  of patient  settings  (e.g., primary  care offices,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69476],  specialty  clinics),  our trial will recruit  patients  from  just two hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69477]:  cardiac  
catheterization  laboratories  and interventional  radiology  suites.  This greatly  simplifies  the 
process  of identifying  and locating  potentials  participants.  Fourth,  at most  VA Medical  Centers,  
coronary  and non-coronary  angiograms  are performed  by a small  number  of medical  
practitioners.  Unlike  trials  that require  the assistance of many  providers  to identify  potential  
patients,  our study  staff will only need  to engage  a small number  of interventional  cardiologists  
and radiologists  at each study site. Fifth,  many  patients  undergoing angiograms  would  be 
receiving  one or both of our interventions  (IV fluids  and NAC)  independent  of study  
participation. Therefore,  few patients  or providers  are likely  to view  the interventions  as 
experimental  or unsafe. Sixth,  patient  burden in this study  is quite  limited  since  there  is no need

CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8

to return  to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69478].  Follow  up data collection  will be performed  using  
telephone calls, while multiple options are provided for the required blood draws  including use of 
a mobile  phlebotomy  service if the patient  is unable  to return  to the VA or the option of having 
the blood drawn at  non -study VA site such as a Community -Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) or 
another VA facility closer to the participant’s home. Therefore,  patients  are unlikely  to view  
partici pation as unduly  burdensome.  
 
It is also essential  to note that the VA cohort  study  that we conducted  in 2005- [ADDRESS_75889] success  in enrolling  Veterans  undergoing  angiographic  
procedures.  In that prospective  study that required  patients  to return  to the VA following 
angiography  for a follow -up blood  draw,  we successfully recruited  63% of eligible  patients.  This 
recruitment  rate is more  than 3-fold higher  than the most  conservatively  estimated  recruitment  
rate that will be required  for the successful  attainment of the target  population in the proposed 
clinical  trial. We are highly  confident  in our capacity  to successfully  recruit  the number  of 
patients  needed  to meet our  enrollment  targets.

rare. Exemption  requests  will require  the agreement  in writing  of all of the following  
individuals  or groups:  (1) the Site Investigators  of both studies;  (2) the Study  Chair  of 
the involved studies; and (3) the appropriate  CSP Center  Director(s).   Exemptions  sought  
on a per study  basis  are obtained using  a similar  process  with the exception  that letters  
from  individual  SIs would not be required. The Director,  CSR&D  makes  the final 
decision.  Only  after the Director,  CSR&D  has given  final approval, will the participant  
be allowed  to participate  in both studies. Approvals  for exemption  are primarily  based  
on what  is best for the participant  and to protect  the integrity  of the involved studies.  
 
C. Strategies  to address  under -recruitment of  study  subjects  
Given  the large size of our study  and the critical  importance  of adequate  patient  recruitment,  we 
anticipate using  a number  of strategies  to address  under -recruitment  should it occur.  First,  in 
addition  to the [ADDRESS_75891] five additional  VA centers  as alternative  study  sites.  We will closely  monitor  screening  
and enrollment  at each site on an ongoing  basis.  Sites  that fail to meet  pre-specified  milestones  
for recruitment  may be placed  on probationary  status  (See Section  XIV.E.).  If a participating  site 
continues  to fail to meet  enrollment  targets  at pre-specified  time points,  we will exercise  the 
option of replacing  the site with one of the pre-identified  alternative VA centers.  Alternatively, 
we may choose to reduce funding to underenrolling sites (e.g., eliminating payment for 
the Research Associate or reducing funding for the Study Coordinator to less than full -
time status) and utilize those funds to inc rease support to high enrolling sites, or within 
budgetary constraints, to activate one or more additional study sites.   One  advantage of 
the short  follow -up (90 days)  is that it will allow  us to re-allocate  resources  in a relatively  
short  period of time.   
 
Second,  based  on current  eligibility  criteria,  we will exclude  patients  with baseline  eGFR  values  
of 45-60 ml/min/1.[ADDRESS_75892]  diabetes  because they are at slightly  lower  risk for 
CIAKI and serious,  adverse,  downstream  outcomes. However,  if we encounter  difficulty 
meeting  recruitment  targets,  we will reconsider  the option  of broadening  our eligibility  criteria  to 
include  patients  with baseline eGFR  45-60 ml/min/1.[ADDRESS_75893]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”   
CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75894],  which is another  
known  risk factor  for CIAKI.  This approach, which  would  require  us to operationalize  a definition  
of non-decompensated  CHF  (e.g., NY Heart  Association  Functional  class  III-IV and/or  a history  
of pulmonary  edema  due to cardiac disease),  would  only be utilized  if all other  efforts  to boost  
enrollment  were  unsuccessful.203 We believe  that having these  two strategies  to address  potential  
under -enrollment  will help ensure  the attainment of the target  sample  size without  
compromising the scientific integrity  of the study.  
 
D. Inclusion of  non-VA study  sites in Australia , New Zealand, and Malaysia 
As part of the planning  process  for this trial, we engaged  with investigators  from  The George  
Institute  for Global  Health  (TGI)  in Sydney,  Australia.  The George  Institute  has an impressive  
track  record  in the conduct  of large  clinical  trials  and has collaborated  with the Australia/New  
Zealand  Intensive  Care Society  Clinical  Trials  Group  (ANZICS -CTG)  in prior  trials  of acute  
kidney  injury. While  collaboration with The George  Institute  is not necessary to  execute the trial 
based  on our estimates  of the numbers  of procedures  performed  within  the VA, collaboration  
will allow  for the inclusion  of non-VA study  sites,  increase the number  of potential participants,  
and enhance  the generalizability  of the study  to non-Veterans  and women. The investigators  
from  TGI are being  sponsored by [CONTACT_69564] [ADDRESS_75895]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”

informed consent  form and supplementary  material  to read  and review.  
 
The general  purpose  of the study  will be delineated and the treatment comparisons  will be clearly  
described. The process  of randomization  will be discussed  and a clear  explanation  of what  will 
be expected  of the patient  will also be described.  The risks associated  with treatments  and 
procedures  will also be addressed.  The importance  of patient  confidentiality  will be stressed,  
including  a description  of the process  for maintaining  patient  confidentiality. Research  personnel  
will ensure  that the patient  understands  every  aspect  of the trial, including  its risks and benefits,  
prior to signing the informed  consent.  
 
If the patient  agrees,  his/her  consent  to participate in the study  will be documented  on the 
Agreement  to Participate in Research  form  (VA form  10-1086). The original  will be placed  in 
the patient's  medical  record.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_69479],  placed  in 
the patient's  study  file, and faxed  to the MAVERIC  CSPCC at the time of enrollment  in the 
study.  A copy  of the consent will also be posted  in the  patient’s  electronic medical  record.  If the 
site is unable to scan the consent into the patient’s electronic medical record, a CPRS template or 
Word document that contains the currently approved consent language can be included in the 
enrollment note in C PRS. The note should contain information that indicates that the Veteran 
signed a paper copy of the consent and should list the ICF version number and date of signature. The note should also state that the copy is located in the investigators study file.

XIII.  DATA MANAGEMENT  
Source  documents  may include, but are not limited  to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20112],  clinical  and office  charts,  
laboratory  notes,  memoranda,  subjects’  diaries  or evaluation  checklists,  pharmacy  dispensing  
records,  recorded  data from  automated  instruments,  copi[INVESTIGATOR_69480],  microfiches,  photographic  negatives,  microfilm  or 
magnetic media,  x-rays,  subject  files,  and records  kept at the pharmacy,  at the laboratories,  and at 
medico -technical  departments  involved  in the clinical  trial. Paper  source  document  worksheets  
will be provided to study  coordinators  to facilitate  data collection.  If a paper  source  document  
worksheet  is used as a primary  means  of collecting  data (the data elements  are newly  created  and 
not transcribed  from  other  sources)  then it will be considered a source  document  and must  be 
maintained.  The MAVERIC  CSPCC will manage  the trial data using  a web-based  Electronic  
Data Capture  (EDC) system.  The EDC  system  will allow  study  coordinators  to enter  the source  
data into a web-based  study  database and manage  their patients,  handle  data clarifications,  and 
correct  patient  data.  Accordingly,  the electronic system  will be used to create,  modify,  maintain  
and retrieve clinical data for CSP#[ADDRESS_75898] protected  and unique  to the users'  functional  study  group (i.e., those  for a study  
coordinator  would  differ from  those  of the coordinating  center  or site monitors).  Formal  
training  on the use of the EDC  system  for clinical  study  management  will also be provided.  
Systems  training  may also be held at annual  meetings  and on an as-needed  basis  for new 
research  personnel.  
 
The MAVERIC  CSPCC  will utilize  an EDC  tool that is fully compliant  with U.S. Federal  
regulations  regarding  electronic  web-based  data capture  systems  established  by [CONTACT_69568], Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”

21 CFR  11. This system  is designed  to make the process  of patient  data management  easier,  
timelier,  and more  efficient.  Accessing  the system  requires  a VA intranet  connection  and a web- 
browser.  The paper  source  documents  from  which  data will be entered  into the electronic data 
capture tool’s  case report  forms  provide  the official  clinical record  for data collection.  All paper - 
based  study  records  will be kept under  lock and key. The EDC  system  will be validated  by [CONTACT_69569].  
Validation  documentation and all system  dependability  documentation (i.e., software  and 
hardware versions, etc.) will be maintained  as study  documentation, but will not be detailed  in 
this protocol. 
 
For this trial, EDC  designers will create a study -specific database that  includes case report  forms,  
interview  schedules,  and data queries  using  customized  code imbedded  directly  into electronic  
case report  forms.  Data clarifications  forms (DCFs) or data queries  will be managed  in two ways.  
Certain  queries  will be programmed  into the forms  that are designed  to activate  upon data entry.  
Additional  DCFs  will be programmed  using  other  data analysis  tools  such as SQL  and will be 
uploaded into the system  for study  coordinators  to address.  Furthermore, the system  will allow  
manual  DCFs  to be entered  into the EDC  system  by [CONTACT_69570].  Updates  
to the electronic forms  and database  can be generated  during  the study  without  impacting  collected  
data.  Study  reports  can be generated  from  exported  data in order  to track  the study  progress  
and to monitor  adverse  events, in particular  Serious  Adverse  Events. Study  reports  will be 
circulated  to appropriate  members,  including  the site investigators, the study  chairmen,  and the 
Data Monitoring  Committee (DMC).  
 
The servers  housing  the study  databases  will be located  at secure VA facilities  that support  
round- the-clock  web services  and monitoring  within  a secure VA environment  in order   to provide  
an optimal infrastructure  for the protection of sensitive  information. The clinical  database  with 
all research  data will be housed behind  the VA firewall  on VA owned and maintained  
servers.  Accordingly, the information housed  within  the EDC  system  will be afforded  the same  
level  of security  as all forms  of VA protected  and/or  highly  sensitive  information. Additionally,  
the system  will be monitored by [CONTACT_69571].

comprehensive disaster  recovery  plan. The Director  of Information  Technology  will ensure  that 
backup  media  are stored  in compliance  with all federal  and VA regulations  on the storage  of 
potentially  sensitive  information.  The Director  of Information Technology  will also ensure  that 
all backup media  are encrypted  in compliance  with the current  best practices  established  and 
approved  by [CONTACT_69572](s).  Encrypted  backup  media  will be stored  in a physically  
secure location  with access  restricted  to essential  personnel. Access  to back-ups may be at the 
discretion  of the Center  Director(s) and/or the  Director of  Information  Technology. 
 
Access  to the study  data is heavily  restricted  to individuals  with CSP approval. Individuals  must  
be properly  credentialed  research  staff and must  be compliant  with VA security  trainings  (i.e., 
Research  Data Security,  HIPAA  and VA Privacy  Training,  Information  Security  Awareness,  and 
Good Clinical Practices).  In addition, research  data will be stored  on VA secure servers  with 
restricted  permissions  for copying  and exporting  data.  Only  properly  approved Coordinating  
Center  personnel  will have the ability  to copy  and export  data.  These  individuals  have  received  
training  on the local  SOP governing  their permissions  and will not access  or export  data without  
written  approval  from  the MAVERIC  CSPCC  Center  Director.  Furthermore, the permissions  of 
the electronic  systems  are structured  such that individual  sites can only see the data for their 
study  participants.  They  cannot  see or access  the data for another  clinical site or for another  
participant.  
 
Access  to protected  health information  (PHI) will  be restricted  to individuals  approved by [CONTACT_69573].  Once an individual  is no longer  an active member  of the research  team,  
their access  to research  data  will be removed.

At the completion of the study, a data set  from the study will be banked at the MAVERIC CSP 
Coordinating Center in a data repository that will be established for research purposes under the oversight of   the VA [LOCATION_011] Institutional Review Board. The Data Repository will be established 
and used in accordance with the Repository Protocol, relevant Standard Operating Procedures, 
and existing regulations. Data will be made available to appropriately credentialed researchers 
conducting studies related to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_69483]. 
 
 
Regarding  our collaboration with  The George  Institute in Australia,  as described  in Section  X.D.,  
study  data from  the VA and The George  Institute  will be submitted  to MAVERIC  CSPCC and  
analyzed  as one combined dataset.

XIV. QUALITY  CONTROL  PROCEDURES  
A. Standardization/validation  of measurements  
Prior  to the initiation  of the study, all investigators  from  the clinical  sites as well as study  
coordinators  will meet  to review  study  procedures  and receive training  on collecting  data for the 
study.  Much  of this training  will take place during  the study  kickoff  meeting.  The protocol  and 
source  document  worksheets  will be sent to site investigators  and coordinators  to review  prior  to 
the meeting.  During  the meeting,  study  coordinators  will receive training  on obtaining  and 
maintaining  source  documents  and completing study  assessments  and electronic  case report  
forms.  Verbal  feedback  and discussion  will follow  to ensure  that each coordinator  comprehends  
the proper  methodology  for assessment.  The meeting  will also cover  an in-depth review  of the 
study  operations  manual.  Such  a review  will serve to reinforce  the training  described  above  and 
will orient  the research  personnel  to the  reference guides  for the  study.  
 
Prior  to the start  of any study  using  the MAVERIC  CSPCC  electronic  data  capture  tool,  extensive  
study  specific validation  will be performed.  This process  will be documented and placed  on 
file at the MAVERIC  CSPCC.  
 
B. Patient  management  
For CSP 578, the site investigator  at each site will be responsible  for the management  of his/her  
patients.  If the patient  is unable  to return  to the VA facility  at which  their angiogram  was 
performed  for specimen  required  blood  collection  other options for this blood draw may include, 
but not be limited to: 1) having a mobile phlebotomy service draw the blood; or 2) having the 
blood drawn at a non- study VA site such as a Community -Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) or 
another VA facility closer to the participant’s home . Every  effort  will be made to accommodate  
the patient’s  schedule and  safety  concerns.  
 
C. Protocol  deviations  
Documentation  of any protocol  deviations  will be required.  A Protocol  Deviation  form  has been 
created  by [CONTACT_69574].  Protocol  deviations  
will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_69575]’s  office  and the MAVERIC  CSPCC,  and a determination  
made regarding  the validity  of any justification  for the deviation. Any medical  center  or subject   
Weisbord  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”   
CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/2019  Page 84   
 
with repeated  protocol  deviations in the  absence of valid  justification,  and after remedial  protocol  
training,  will be recommended  for termination  to the DMC.  If any member  of the DMC  or the 
monitoring  bodies  for CSP 578 feel that adherence to the protocol  will be detrimental to a 
participant's  health  or well-being, the interest of the participant  will take precedence and the 
subject  will be withdrawn after consultation  with the Executive  Committee.  Protocol  deviations  
will be reported to the  VA Central  IRB as required. 
 
D. Unblinding  the study  treatment  
This CSP clinical  trial is a double -blinded  study  in which  neither  the patient  nor the site 
investigator  knows  to which  of the four study  arms  the patient  has been  assigned.  The 
CSPCRPCC will not provide Emergency Code Envelopes to the sites’ Pharmacy Service. 
Emergency unblindings will be managed through the 24- hour emergency call service (505 -248-
3203). This number is also listed on the patient ID cards given to each patient par ticipating in CSP 
#578. The system managed by [CONTACT_69576]- to-date study drug 
assignment information gathered from the PRESERVE IWRS. 
Under unusual circumstances, chiefly related to participant safety, unblinding may be neces sary. 
This is usually done after consultation with the Study Chair, Steven Weisbord MD, MSc or Study 
Co-Chair, Paul Palevsky MD. If [CONTACT_69625] and [CONTACT_69626] are unavailable, the CSPCRPCC 
Clinical Research Pharmacist (Todd Conner, PharmD) or the Study Director (James Kaufman, MD) should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. Current telephone numbers are listed in the study personnel directory on the 
CSP578 Main SharePoint Site.  
If unblinding is required in an emergency, the Local Site Investigator (LSI) or Study Coordinator 
(SC) must contact [CONTACT_69577] 24 -hour emergency call service to obtain study drug 
assignment information. The CSPCRPCC will notify the Study Chair’s Office and the MAVERIC CSPCC by [CONTACT_69578] .  If the CSPCRPCC 
receives a request for unblinding information from anyone other than the LSI or SC, the CSPCRPCC will refer the requester to the LSI or SC or, in his or her absence, the CSPCRPCC will confer with the parties above.

E. Probation/termination  of participating  centers  
The recruitment  rate and operational  aspects  of this study  will be monitored continuously  by [CONTACT_69579].  Medical  centers  may only continue  participation  if the 
performance  measures  described  below  are met. Termination  of a center  will only be taken  in 
accordance with Cooperative Studies policies and procedures.  
 
The following  performance  measures  will be used to determine  whether  sites are at risk for or 
should be placed  on probation. Other  reasons  for probation  include, but are not limited  to, 
noncompliance with the  protocol, ICH,  or applicable  federal  regulations. 
 
1. Recruitment  rate. Recruitment  rate will be calculated  by [CONTACT_69580].  This measure  will be continuously  monitored and 
sites between  75% and 90%  of expected  recruitment  will be subject  to remediation  such as action  
plans  or mentoring.  Sites  under  75% cumulative  recruitment  after a 3-month ramp -up period may 
be placed  on probation. Assessment  for probation will  occur on a  monthly  basis.  
 
2. Follow -up rate. Follow -up rate will be calculated  by [CONTACT_69581] 
90-day follow -up forms  completed  by [CONTACT_69582] 90-day visits  due. 
Both  the numerator  and denominator  will be subject  to a 4-week  delay  in order  to allow  for 
scheduling  of the 90 day visit and completion  of forms.  Sites  with cumulative  follow -up rates 
below 90%  may be placed on probation. Assessment  for probation will  occur  on a  monthly  basis.  
 
3. Forms  Completion rate. Forms  completion rate will be calculated  by [CONTACT_69583],  where  the number  of expected  will exclude  
forms  marked  not collected.  Forms  completion  rates will be calculated  both by [CONTACT_69584].  Sites  with cumulative  forms  completion  rates under  90% may be placed  on probation.  
Assessment  for probation will  occur on a  monthly  basis.

XV. GOOD CLINICAL  PRACTICES  
1. Role of GCP  
This trial will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations.  The 
intent of these regulations is to safeguard subjects’ welfare and assure the validity of data resulting 
from the clinical research. The V A Cooperative Studies Program will assist Local Site 
Investigators (LSIs) in complying with GCP requirements through its Site Monitoring, Auditing and Resource Team (SMART) based in Albuquerque, NM.  SMART serves as the Quality 
Assurance arm of CSP for GCP  compliance.  Study site personnel will receive a GCP overview at 
the study organizational meeting.  
.SMART will provide training, manuals and materials to assist study personnel in organizing 
study files and will be available throughout the trial to advise  and assist LSIs regarding GCP issues.  
2. Summary of Monitoring and Auditing Plans  
a. Monitoring Visits – 
(1) Initiation visits at each site soon after study start- up 
(2) Subsequent monitoring will be conducted yearly thereafter  
(3) Final monitoring visit to each site during last year of study  
(4) Additional monitoring visits may be conducted as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_69585].  
b. Audits   
(1) Routine audits – independent site visits to one or more sites per year as 
determined by [CONTACT_69586].  
(2) For-Cause audits –independent audi t of a site as requested by [CONTACT_69587].  
(3) Audits may be scheduled or unannounced.

XVI. STUDY MONITORING  AND AUDITING  PLANS  
Protection  of the rights  and welfare of patients  is a primary  concern  of CSP.  In addition to the 
International  Conference  on Harmonisation  (ICH)  Good Clinical Practice  Guidelines, this trial 
will be conducted in compliance  with VA guidelines,  the Declaration  of Helsinki,  and the 
applicable  parts  of the United  States  Code  of Federal  Regulations  or local  laws governing  the 
conduct  of good clinical  studies. 
 
A. Monitoring bodies  
Four  external  bodies  will oversee  the ongoing  scientific  and ethical  conduct  of the study  including  
the Data Monitoring  Committee,  the CSPCC  Human Rights  Committee  (HRC),  the VA Central  
IRB and Clinical Monitors  (SMART).  In addition,  at the mid-point  of the study, the Cooperative 
Studies  Scientific Evaluation  Committee (CSSEC) will  review  the study.  
 
By [CONTACT_69588],  the medical  center  delegates  responsibility  for global  
monitoring  of the ongoing  study  to these four bodies. However,  the Research  and Development  
(R&D)  and the Human  Studies  Committee  of the local  medical  center  may require  the 
investigators  to submit  additional  reports  concerning  the status  of the study.  Internal  operational  
oversight  (described  in Section  XVIII)  will be conducted by [CONTACT_69589],  the 
CSPCRPCC  and the Study  Chairmen’s  Office.  
 
1. Data Monitoring  Committee  
The Data Monitoring  Committee  (DMC)  will review  the progress  of the study  and monitor  
adherence to the protocol, participant  intake,  outcomes, complications,  and other  issues  related  
to participant  safety.  They  will also monitor  the assumptions  underlying sample  size 
calculations  for the study  and alert the investigators  if they see substantial  departures  as the data 
accumulate.  The DMC  will be composed  of experts  in nephrology, cardiology, and clinical  
trials.  The Study  Chairmen  will make nominations  to the Director,  Cooperative  Studies  
Program,  who will make  the final selection  for the Committee.  The DMC  will make  
recommendations  to the Director  of the Cooperative  Studies  Program  as to whether  the study  
should continue  or be terminated.  The DMC  can consider  participant  safety  or other  
circumstances  as grounds  for early  termination,  including either  compelling  internal  or external

evidence of treatment  differences  or feasibility  of addressing  the study  hypotheses  (e.g. poor 
participant  enrollment,  poor adherence).  The DMC  will conduct  an in depth assessment  of 
safety  and efficacy  data every  six months  at which time the study  biostatistician  will provide  the 
DMC  with an interim summary  report  on the study  status  and on safety  data for monitoring  
purposes.  
 
2. Human  Rights Committee  
The Human  Rights  Committee  (HRC)  at the Coordinating  Center  may review  the study  at the 
request  of the Coordinating  Center  Director  in order  to provide  suggestions  regarding  study  
participants'  protection. 
 
3. VA Central  IRB 
The VA Central  IRB provides  expert  ethical  and scientific  review  of multi- site projects  while  
ensuring  local  issues  are addressed.  The VA Central  IRB performs  full, expedited,  exempt,  and 
continuing  review  and provides  waivers  of HIPAA  authorization  as necessary  and appropriate.  
The VA Central  IRB meets  monthly  in person  and/or  by [CONTACT_69590].  The Study  
Chairmen  will initially  submit  a principal  investigator  (PI) application which  will include  model  
documents  such as the informed  consent  form  and any waiver  requests.  Once approved, this 
application  package will be sent to all potential  participating  sites who will be responsible  for 
submitting  their own local  site investigator  (LSI)  applications. Once both the PI [INVESTIGATOR_69484], the study  is reviewed  in accordance with local  R&D  
Committee policies  and the VA Central  IRB is provided a  copy  of the site approval  document for  
the study  to begin  at that site.  Continuing  reviews  are done  annually.  
 
4. CSP Site Monitoring, Auditing and Resource Team (SMART ) 
The CSP Site Monitoring, Auditing and Resource Team (SMART), located in the CSPCRPCC in 
Albuquerque, will monitor the trial for compliance with Good Clinical Practices.  GCP monitors 
from SMART will visit participating sites shortly after enrollment is ini tiated and subsequent 
monitoring will be conducted yearly thereafter to monitor investigator regulatory and protocol compliance and to evaluate research practices.  SMART will provide an orientation to GCP at the 
study kick- off meeting and provide GCP tool s to enhance compliance.  Additionally, SMART will

 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75903] periodic routine audits throughout the course of the study and for -cause audits as requested 
by [CONTACT_69591]  
 
B. Monitoring adverse events  (AEs) and serious  adverse events  (SAEs) 
Timely  and complete  reporting  of safety  information assists  study  management  in identifying  
any untoward medical  occurrence,  thereby  [CONTACT_17155]:  1) protection  of study  patients’  safety;  2) a 
greater  understanding  of the overall  safety  profile  of the study  interventions  and therapeutic  
modalities; 3) appropriate modification of the study  protocol; 4)  improvements  in study  design  or 
procedures;  and 5) compliance with  regulatory  requirements.  
 
The local  Site Investigator  will be responsible  for the AE and SAE  reporting  requirements  as 
described  in this protocol  and outlined  below:  
 Closely  monitoring  research  subjects  during  the study  for the development  of new AEs 
and SAEs.  
 Reviewing  the accuracy  and completeness  of all AEs and SAEs  reported.  
 Reporting  all  SAEs   to the CSPCRPCC  and MAVERIC  CSPCC within  72 hours  of 
becoming  aware of  the event. 
 Complying with VA Central  IRB policies  for reporting  adverse events  
 Implementing  plans  the Study  Group and Executive Committee  may develop  in response  
to safety  concerns.  
 
1. Adverse  events  
Adverse  events  (AEs)  are defined by [CONTACT_69592] 1058.01, paragraph  4 (a) as "An AE is 
any untoward physical  or psychological  occurrence  in a human subject  participating  in research.  
An AE can be an unfavorable  and unintended event,  including  an abnormal  laboratory  finding,  
symptom,  or disease associated  with the research  or the use of a medical  investigational test 
article.  An AE does not necessarily  have to have  a causal  relationship  with the research.  " 
 
For the purpose  of CSP 578, the study  interventions  are study  IV fluids  and oral NAC/placebo.  
Related  events  involve  an assessment  of the degree of causality  (attribution)  between  the study  
interventions  and the event. Site investigators  will be asked  to provide  an assessment  of  
 
Weisbord  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”   
CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/2019  Page 91   
relatedness.  All AEs with a reasonable causal  relationship to the investigative  treatment  will be 
considered "related."  A definite  relationship  does  not need  to be  established.  
 
Local  site investigators,  with assistance  from  their study  coordinator,  are responsible  for 
collecting  AE information  regarding  the subjects  at their sites.  During  the study,  data on adverse  
events  will be collected  spontaneously  through patient  reports, actively  elicited  during  the 
angiography  visit through open- ended  questioning  and examination,  and gathered  at the time of 
telephone  contact  [CONTACT_69593] -up period.  Related  adverse  event  
data will be collected  from  the time of consent  to [ADDRESS_75904] angiography . If a patient  receives  
care at a non-VA facility  for an adverse event  they experience,  research  personnel  will obtain  
the requisite  release of information  form(s)  from  the patient  and once  received,  acquire  the 
pertinent  medical  records from  the facility.  
 
AEs related  to the study  intervention  that are reported  to research  personnel  will be recorded  on 
an adverse event  form  and documented in source  records  (e.g.,  the electronic VA medical  record  
and/or  the subject's  study  record).  In this way,  the site creates  a permanent  record  that provides  
information on the  subject's  clinical  course  while  in the  study.  
 
Adverse  events  which  develop  into Serious  Adverse  Events,  as defined  below,  will be reported  
as such  and followed  to resolution or  stabilization.  
 
2. Serious  adverse events  
Serious  adverse events  (SAEs)  are a subset  of adverse  events  defined in  VHA Handbook 1058.01,  
paragraph 4(r) and 21 CFR 312.32(a), as follows:  
 
Definition  of SAE  from  CFR  312.32 (a): Serious  adverse event.  An adverse event  or suspected  
adverse reaction  is considered  "serious"  if, in the view  of either  the investigator  or sponsor, it 
results  in any of the following  outcomes:  Death,  a life-threatening  adverse  event,  inpatient  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69485], a persistent  or significant  incapacity  or 
substantial disruption  of the ability  to conduct  normal  life functions, or a congenital  
anomaly/birth  defect.  Important  medical  events  that may not result  in death,  be life-threatening,

CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75905]  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition.  
 
Definition  of SAE  according  to VA Handbook  1058.01:  An SAE is an untoward occurrence 
in human research  that results  in death,  a life-threatening  experience,  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity,  congenital  
anomaly,  or birth  defect , or that requires  medical,  surgical,  behavioral,  social,  or other  
intervention  to prevent  such an outcome. 
 
All SAEs,  as defined  in VHA Handbook 1058.01, paragraph 4(r) and 21 CFR 312.32(a), will be 
collected,  regardless  of whether  or not they are considered  related  to the study  interventions.  
SAEs  with a reasonable causal  relationship  to the study interventions  and associated  medications  
will be reported as "related."  A definite  causal  relationship  does not need  to be  established.  
 
Local  site investigators,  with assistance  from  their study  coordinator,  are responsible  for 
collecting  SAE  information regarding the subjects  at their sites.  SAEs  will be collected  from  the 
time of consent  through day 90 following  the patient’s  index  angiography  procedure  or the time 
of patient termination  if before day 90. During  the study, data on SAEs   will  be  collected   
spontaneously  through   patient   reports,   actively  elicited   during  the angiography  visit through 
open- ended  questioning  and examination,  and gathered  at the time of telephone  contact  [CONTACT_69594] -up period. If a patient  receives  care at a non-VA 
facility  for a serious  adverse event  they experience,  research  personnel  will obtain  the requisite  
release of information  form(s) from  the patient  and once  received,  acquire  the pertinent  medical  
records from  the facility.  
 
SAEs  that are reported  to research  personnel  will be documented  in source  records  (e.g., the 
electronic VA medical  record  and/or  the subject's  study  record).  In this way,  the site creates  a 
permanent  record  that provides  information  on the subject's  clinical  course  while  in the study.  
Research  personnel  at the site will ask follow -up questions  to determine the exact  nature  of the 
SAE  and obtain  appropriate  medical  records,  if needed. Each  SAE  will be followed  to resolution  
or stabilization  or until the end of study participation.

XVII.  BIOSTATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
A. Overview  of design  
1. The analytic model  
There are two primary  hypotheses  that will be tested: 1) peri-procedure  infusion of sodium  
bicarbonate  is superior  to infusion of sodium  chloride  for the prevention of serious, adverse  
clinical  events  within  90 day of angiography  and; 2) peri-procedure  administration  of oral N- 
acetylcysteine (NAC) is superior  to placebo  for the prevention of serious, adverse  clinical  events  
within  [ADDRESS_75911]  90 days after the intervention. Within  each site, subjects  will be randomly  assigned  
to one of four combinations  of study  interventions:  1) bicarbonate  and NAC  placebo, 2) saline  
and NAC  placebo,  3) bicarbonate  and NAC  and 4) saline and  NAC . 
 
The study  design  for the primary  hypothesis  is a [ADDRESS_75912] 50% 
from  the baseline SCr. We denote  the 90-day binary  outcome  as ‘MAKE -D’ (major  adverse  
kidney  events  and death).  The binary  predictors  are the interventions  bicarbonate  and NAC . The 
interaction  term,  bicarbonate*NAC, represents  the combination  of these  two interventions. The 
primary  analysis  starts with  a  logistic regression  analysis  with three binary  predictors.  
 
For the  primary  hypothesis, the  model  equation  for the  analysis  is: 
 
 
MAKE -D =  β1* Bicarbonate +  β2* NAC  + β12* Bicarbonate*NAC  Model  Equation 
 
 
where,  β1 , β2, and β12 are the  logistic regression  beta  coefficients.  
 
 
The two  main  questions  of interest  that we will  test for the primary  hypothesis are:  
1) Does  bicarbonate reduce the incidence of  MAKE -D? 
2) Does  NAC  reduce the  incidence of  MAKE -D? 
Weisbord  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”   
CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75913] the significance of the interaction  term, 
bicarbonate*NAC . In the event of a non- significant interaction term at p=0.[ADDRESS_75914] published randomized trials  that investigated  the proposed  interventions  did not report  on 
these outcomes.  However, for those  that did track  these events, acute dialysis was necessary  in 0- 
7%, death  occurred  in 0-6%, and persistent  decline in kidney  function occurred  in up to 19% of 
patients.  Using  the VA Austin  database,  we identified  25,909  Veterans  who recently  underwent  
coronary  or non-coronary  angiography  who met our study  entry  criteria.  Examining  event  rates 
at 90 days following  angiography,  we found that 1% died,  5% initiated  dialysis,  and 4% had a 
persistent  increase in SCr of at least 50% (only about  one-half of the patients  had a measurement  
of SCr at 90 days).  Overall,  8.7%  had at least one of these events  within  90 days.  We therefore  
believe that the baseline incidence  of MAKE -D in this patient  population is 8.7%. Assuming an 
equal  distribution  of use of NAC  versus  no use of NAC  and saline versus  bicarbonate  in this 
population  with an overall  event  rate of 8.7%, a 25% reduction  in the incidence of the composite  
primary  outcome  with bicarbonate  (vs. saline)  and with NAC  (vs. placebo)  would  lead to the 
distribution  of events  with each treatment combination shown  in Model  1. Using  this approach,  
the overall  sample  size estimate,  assuming  a type 1 error  of 0.025,  90% power, and 3% loss to 
follow -up, would  be 6,500 subjects.

Overall  event rate

Our proposed  sample  size of 7,680 patients,  based  on the rates summarized  in Model  2 (see 
below), arises  from  more  conservative  assumptions. The 8.7%  overall  event  rate derived  from  
the VA Austin  database represents  the incidence of this composite  outcome  in a patient  
population  in which  the specific  use of preventive  care for CIAKI  is unknown. Recognizing that 
these  patients  may or may not have  received  the interventions  we propose  to study,  we have  
taken  a more  conservative  approach  to estimating  the necessary  sample  size by [CONTACT_69596] 8.7%  event  rate represents  the rate in each of the control  arms  (i.e., placebo  with saline  or 
bicarbonate  and saline  with or without  NAC)  as shown  in Model  2. In this proposed model,  the 
overall  event  rate in the entire  population is 7.6%, which  is 13% lower  than the event  rate (8.7%)  
which  is suggested  by [CONTACT_69597].  Using  this more  conservative  
estimate  of the overall  event  rate resulted  in our proposed sample  size of 7,680 patients.  We 
believe that  this approach will help ensure  that our  study  is not underpowered and is grounded on 
conservative, yet clinically  reasonable event  rate estimates.

NAC  5.59%  7.46%  6.52%

Most  trials  have reported  effect  sizes  for the outcome  of CIAKI  rather  than for our defined  90 
day primary  composite  outcome. For CIAKI,  a recent  meta -analysis  reported  a pooled  relative  
risk of 0.62 (95%  CI: 0.45- 0.86)  favoring  bicarbonate  when  compared  to saline,  with the 
individual  study  effect  sizes  ranging  from  2% to 92%. There were too few studies  that 
systematically  tracked other  clinical outcomes  to reliably  analyze the risks for dialysis  (RR=0.51,  
95% CI: 0.17- 1.51)  or death  (RR=0.83, 95% CI: 0.32-2.19). Similar  results  have been  reported  
for NAC. The Planning  Committee felt  that a 25% effect  size would  be clinically  meaningful  and 
within  the range  of what  might  be expected  from  previous  studies,  since  the reduction  in 90 day 
clinical  outcomes  is likely  mediated  by a reduction  in CIAKI,  which  available literature  suggests  
is reduced  by [CONTACT_69598] 92%.

Therefore,  considering  Model  2, we postulate that: 
 Under  control  conditions, the 90-day event  rate for our primary  outcome  (MAKE -D) is 
8.7%  
 Each  of the two interventions will  prevent  25%  of these events  
 Under each  intervention  condition, the 90-day event rate is 6.52%  
 The absolute effect  of each  intervention  will be a 2.18%  reduction in 90- day events  
 
 
We have  two primary  hypotheses, one for each main  effect  in the model.  We will therefore  
allocate the type I error of 5% equally  across  the two interventions,  assigning  a type I error of 
2.5%  to each.  Including  a third  test for the interaction  term from  the set of primary  hypotheses  
would slightly  decrease the statistical  power.  We discuss  the potential  impact  of the interaction  
on the power  of the study  later in this section.  One interim analysis  using  an O’Brien -Fleming  
rule will  be carried  out when half the  expected  number  of MAKE -D events have occurred.  
 
B. Primary  end-points  
The two main  interventions  will be analyzed  in the same way.  Hence,  we fully  describe  the 
bicarbonate  versus  saline  intervention and the MAKE -D outcome. The analyses  for the other  
intervention, NAC  versus placebo,  are analogous.  
 
The null hypothesis  is that the two treatment  groups  (bicarbonate  and saline)  do not differ in 
terms  of the proportion of subjects  who experience  MAKE -D events. The alternative  hypothesis  
is that the absolute  difference in the incidence of MAKE -D between  the bicarbonate  intervention  
group and the saline  group  is 2.18%  or more.  
 
Formal  statement of  the null hypothesis  
Under the  null hypothesis:  
 The  proportion  of  90-day  MAKE -D  events   for  patients   administered   bicarbonate   is 
8.70%  
 Under  the alternative  hypothesis, the proportion of 90-day MAKE -D events  for patients  
administered  saline is 8.70%

section A . 
 
C. Secondary  end-points  
Our secondary  objectives,  as previously  outlined, will be tested  using a  logistic  regression 
analysis  similar to the  primary  objective.  These objectives  are: 
1. To assess  the effectiveness  of the interventions  to prevent  CIAKI,  defined  by  [CONTACT_69599] ≥ 0.5 mg/dL  and/or  ≥ 25% at 96 hrs following  angiography compared  to 
baseline values.  
2. To assess  the effectiveness  of the interventions  for the prevention of the following  
outcomes  within  90 days  of coronary  or non- coronary  angiography:  
a) death  
b) major  adverse kidney  endpoints  (MAKE)  including  need  for acute dialysis  or 
persistent  decline  in kidney  function defined by [CONTACT_69600] 
50% at 90 days  
c) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69486], heart  failure,  or cerebrovascular  
accident  defined  by [CONTACT_69601]-9 discharge diagnosis  codes  of 
acute coronary  syndrome  (i.e., STEMI,  NSTEMI,  unstable  angina),  heart  
failure,  or cerebrovascular  accident  and/or  by [CONTACT_69602][INVESTIGATOR_69487].  
d) all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 
 
D. Tertiary  (exploratory)  end-points  
We also wish to explore  whether  the interventions  prevent  adverse  outcomes  occurring  within  
the first year after angiography. To that end, using  logistic  regression  analysis,  we will determine  
whether the  interventions  prevent:

1. Development  of end-stage  renal  disease within  one year following  angiography 
defined  by [CONTACT_69603] ≥ 3 months based  on documentation  in 
the United  States  Renal  Data System  
2. Death  within  one year following  angiography  based  on documentation in the VA 
Beneficiary  Identification  and Records  Locator  System,  the National  Center  for Health  
Statistics  National  Death  Index  database,  or the Social  Security  Administration’s  Death  
Master File  
 
E. Additional  exploratory analyses  
We will explore  several  other hypotheses  related  to the  binary  90 day MAKE -D outcome:  
1. The combination  of bicarbonate  and NAC  (interaction  term)  is more  effective  than 
bicarbonate or  NAC  alone.  
2. (Per Protocol  analysis)  Bicarbonate,  NAC,  and their combination  reduce  the 
incidence  of the primary  outcome,  MAKE -D, among  subjects  who received  the full 
dose of bicarbonate.  
3. (Per Protocol  analysis)  Bicarbonate,  NAC,  and their combination  reduce  the 
incidence  of the primary  outcome,  MAKE -D, among  subjects  who received  the full 
course of  NAC.  
4. Bicarbonate,  NAC,  and their combination  reduce  the incidence  of the individual  
components  of MAKE -D, each treated  as a separate  outcome:  death,  need  for acute  
dialysis,  and persistent  decline in kidney  function.  
5. Bicarbonate,  NAC,  and their combination  reduce the incidence  of each of the 
individual  cardiovascular  components  of the secondary  outcome;  namely  acute  
coronary  syndrome, heart failure,  and cerebrovascular accident.  
6. Bicarbonate,  NAC,  and their combination  result  in a greater  reduction in the 
incidence  of MAKE -D outcomes  in subjects  who develop CIAKI  compared  to those  
who do not develop CIAKI.  
7. Bicarbonate,  NAC,  and their combination  increase the mean  number  of days that 
participants  are alive  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69488] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69451])  in the [ADDRESS_75916]  SD, Palevsky  PM: CSP#578  “Prevention of Serious Adverse Events  Following  Angiography”   
CSP#578  PRESERVE  Protocol v1.8  
 Effective:    05/01/[ADDRESS_75917] entails  a large  number  of analyses.  However,  the sample  size is large  and the 
implicit  hypotheses  are highly  inter -correlated.  Thus, we anticipate that  we can use a significance  
level  of 1% (p = 0.01)  to detect  associations  of potential clinical  importance  in these  exploratory  
analyses.  
 
Analyses  of the association  of CIAKI  with MAKE -D events  
Most  previous  studies  of outcomes  following  procedures  that utilized  iodinated  contrast  have  
focused on acute increases  in SCr within  days of contrast  administration  (CIAKI).  Compared  to 
the events  that comprise  our 90-day primary  outcome  (MAKE -D), CIAKI occurs  more  
frequently. While  some  epi[INVESTIGATOR_69489] -D events,  some  do not. Our 
analysis  of data from  the VA Austin  databases  demonstrated  that compared  to patients  who do 
not develop CIAKI following  angiography, patients  who develop CIAKI  have  a nearly  four-fold 
increased  risk of experiencing  a MAKE -D event.  We propose  to explore  this relationship  by 
[CONTACT_69604]:  those  who do and those  who do not develop  
CIAKI.  We will then run the logistic  regression  model  for each stratum.  This analysis  may reveal  
different  levels  of effectiveness  of the interventions  based  on whether  CIAKI developed. We will 
carry  out a more  global  analysis  using  log-linear  models  to address  the same question by [CONTACT_69605].  We chose  a sensitive  definition  of CIAKI  
based  on an increase in SCr of ≥0.5 mg/dL  and/or  ≥25% . This definition  has been used in most  
prior  trials  and will permit us to compare our findings  with prior  studies  on CIAKI.  Nonetheless,  
we will also examine the incidence  of CIAKI  defined  by [CONTACT_69606]  (AKIN  
definition), evaluate  the effectiveness  of our interventions  on the prevention of larger  changes  in 
SCr, and assess  the association  of CIAKI defined  by [CONTACT_69607] -D 
outcomes.  
 
Our protocol  involves  administering  treatment  before  we assess  the occurrence  of  CIAKI.  Hence,  
the occurrence of CIAKI  cannot  be viewed  as a simple  treatment  confounder.  In fact, we

and equal  allocation  to each  treatment  arm.

them  to be  3%. Accounting for this estimated  loss to follow up rate, our adjusted sample size will 
be 7,680. The study will permit secondary analysis of any SCr values assayed at a local laboratory 
that fit specimen collection timeframes for those blood specimens that were unable to be collected  
for analysis by [CONTACT_2237] . 
 
Impact  of Potential  Interaction  between  Treatments on Sample  Size and  Statistical Power  
The prior  discussion  of samp le size and statistical  power  is predicated  on the assumption  that the 
effects  of bicarbonate  and NAC  are independent.  Stated  in other  terms,  we have  assumed  that the 
relative reduction  in the rate of MAKE -D events  in patients  assigned  to bicarbonate/NAC  
compared  to saline/NAC  will be the same as that in patients  assigned  to bicarbonate/placebo  
compared  to saline/placebo.  Similarly,  we have  assumed  that the relative  reduction in the rate of 
MAKE -D events  in patients  assigned  to bicarbonate/NAC  compared  to bicarbonate/placebo  will 
be the same as that in patients  assigned  to saline/NAC  compared  to saline/placebo.  The event  
rates  under these assumptions are summarized  in the  following  model. 
 
 
Model  2 in the Absence of Interaction  
 Bicarbonate  Saline   
NAC  5.59%  7.46%  6.52%  
Placebo  7.46%  9.95%  8.70%  
 6.52%  8.70%   
 
The rate of 5.59%  for the combination  of bicarbonate and NAC  is lower  than the rate of 7.46%  
for NAC  with saline  because,  some  patients  who do not respond  to NAC  will, at random,  
respond to bicarbonate.  This is what  is meant  by ‘the absence of interaction.’  In contrast,  an 
interaction  between  NAC  and bicarbonate  could result  in an absence of further benefit  from  
combined  treatment  as compared  to treatment  with  either agent  alone.

Placebo  7.45%  9.95%  8.7%  
 7.45%  8.7%   
 
In this scenario,  the overall  effect  at the margins  would  be reduced  from  a 25% reduction  in 
MAKE -D events  with each treatment  to slightly  more  than a 14% relative  reduction in events  as 
demonstrated  in the model  above. This decrease in effect  size would  result  in a reduction  in the 
statistical power  of the study  to 40% with the proposed  sample  size of 7,680  patients;  the total 
sample  size would  need to be increased  to over 18,900 subjects  to restore  statistical power  to 
80% under  these  conditions. Fortunately, such an attenuation of effect  of our interventions  has 
not been  observed  in trials  that have utilized  both agents  for the prevention  of CIAKI.  103, 108, 118, 
[ADDRESS_75922]  of lesser  degrees  of interaction  between  
the two interventions  is illustrated  in Table 11 below. These  calculations  are based  on 
assumptions  of a 25% reduction in MAKE -D events  with bicarbonate  (compared  to saline)  and 
NAC  (compared  to placebo);  a baseline rate of events  in the patients  treated  with both 
bicarbonate  and NAC  of 5.6%  assuming  no interaction/attenuation  of effect;  an overall  sample  
size of 7,680 individuals  equally  allocated  to each treatment  arm; an estimated  loss to follow -up 
rate of  3%; and a type  I error of  2.5%.

Thus,  the study  will retain  nearly  80% statistical power  with the proposed sample  size of 7,680  
patients  even if an interaction  between  bicarbonate  and NAC  leads  to a 30% attenuation  of their 
combined  effect.  
 
G. Interim  analysis  
Using  the O’Brien -Fleming  procedure,  we will carry  out an interim analysis  after half the 
expected  number  of events  (292 events)  has occurred,  roughly  after [ADDRESS_75924]  the null hypothesis  with Type  I error of 2.5%. At the final analysis  a 
z-value of  2.[ADDRESS_75925]  the null hypothesis  with  Type  I error of  2.5%.  
 
H. Data  analysis plan  
The primary  analysis  will be based  on intention  to treat principles.  Since  treatment  is given for a 
very short  duration (five  days),  we expect  very  few drop  outs or  crossovers. 
 
Analytic  reports  
Analytic  reports  will provide  the proportions, the differences  among  proportions, the odds  ratios,  
and the 95% confidence  intervals  for each of the summary  statistics.  This will be followed  by a 
report  of the results  of confirmatory  analyses.  The confirmatory  exploratory  analyses  will add to 
the basic model,  factors  related  to disease severity,  demographic  and anthropomorphic  measures,  
and structural  factors  such as medical  site. The regression  modeling  we shall  employ  will include  
a model  with treatment  by [CONTACT_69608]  (that is, exploration of potential  subgroup  effects).  We will test that results  vary or do not 
vary significantly  by [CONTACT_69609]. Finally  we will  explore  the effect  of including  site as a random  
effect  by [CONTACT_69610] a random  
effect.

Losses to follow up and missing  data

to the participant for the purpose of appointment scheduling/reminders or follow -up contact. If 
such efforts  fail and we have  no information  indicating  the outcome  for these  subjects,  then 
we will exclude them  from  the primary  analysis  and then carry  out a worst  case analysis  to 
confirm  the result  of the primary  analysis.

The Executive Committee  has the authority  to establish  one or more  publication  committees,  
usually  made  up of sub-groups  of participating  investigators  and some  members  of the Executive  
Committee,  for the purpose  of producing  manuscripts  for presentation  and publication. Any 
presentation  or publication, when  formulated  by [CONTACT_69615],  should be circulated  to all investigators  participating  in manuscript  prepa ration for 
their review,  comments,  and suggestions  at least four weeks  prior  to submission of the 
manuscript  to the presenting  or publication  body.  All publications  must  give proper  recognition  
to the study's  funding  source,  including  the Department  of Veterans  Affairs,  and should list all 
investigators  in the study.  If an investigator's  major  salary  support  and/or  commitment  is from  
the VA, it is obligatory  for the investigator  to list the  VA as his/her  primary  institutional  
affiliation.  Submission of manuscripts  or abstracts  must  follow  the current  VA policy.  Since all 
publications  should state that it is a publication from  a VA Cooperative  Study,  ideally,  a sub-title 
is used stating,  "A VA Cooperative  Study."  The DVA contributions  to the research  project

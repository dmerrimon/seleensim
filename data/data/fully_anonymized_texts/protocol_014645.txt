(CGRP) monoclonal antibody
Safety Objective To evaluate the long te rm safety of repeat doses of ALD403 
administered intravenously (IV) in chronic migraine (CM) 
patients.
Immunogenicity and Patient Reported OutcomesTo evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of repeat doses of ALD403 administere d IV to patients with chronic 
migraine.To further evaluate the impact  of ALD403 on various patient 
reported outcomes.
Methodology This is an open label trial in which 120 eligible subjects will 
receive infusions of ALD403.  The trial will include two 
treatment phases.  The primar y treatment phase will include 4
ALD403 infusions 12 weeks apart.  The secondary treatment phase will include 4 additional ALD403 infusions 12 weeks
apart.
In the primary treatment phase, visits will occur on Day 0, Weeks 
2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36 and subjects will receive 4 IV infusions of ALD403 on Days 0, Weeks 12, 24, and 36.
Subjects who receive all 4 infusions of ALD403 in the primary 
treatment phase may enter the secondary treatment phase. In the secondary treatment phase, su bjects will receive up to 4 
additional IV infusions of ALD403 for a total of 8 infusions. 
Visits and ALD403 IV infusions will occur on Weeks 48, 60, 72, 
and 84. Subjects will be followe d for 20 weeks until Week 104 
for a total study duration of approximately 106 weeks, including the screening period.

ALD403 is a humanized anti-(calcitonin gene-r elated peptide) (CGRP) monoclonal antibody 
(anti-CGRP) that is being developed by [CONTACT_313401]. 
5.2. Background
Migraine is a highly prevalent paroxysmal neurological disease characterized by [CONTACT_313402][INVESTIGATOR_313381], gastrointestinal, and sensory function.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_313382] [ADDRESS_385839] prevalent through the

rdand 4thdecades of life with a significant gender bias of 3:[ADDRESS_385840] work time and diminished productivity 
attributable to migraine costs Amer ican employers an estimated $19.[ADDRESS_385841] a sign ificant genetic/epi[INVESTIGATOR_313383], races, and ethnicities.  Generally, mi graine begins as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_162122].  Between epi[INVESTIGATOR_313384] a normal (premorbid) state of function.  However, approx imately 2.5% of people with epi[INVESTIGATOR_313385], mean ing they are experiencing migraine on greater 
than [ADDRESS_385842] 3 consecutive months.
4For those with chronic migraine, the 
headaches are more intense; migraine-associated symptoms, more severe; and the disease-related impact and disability are much greater than observed for epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730].
5In addition, chronic 
migraine is associated with more co-morbid diseases such as anxiety, depression, and non-
headache pain.6
The pathophysiology of migraine is complex and incompletely understood.  Current models of 
migraine are based on a genetically determined hy per-excitable nervous system characterized by 
a lowered threshold to sensory activation and uniqueness in its sensory processing.7Interactions 
between this migraine nervous system and speci fic internal and external stimuli (migraine 
triggers) can result in activation of the trigemin ovascular system (TVS).  Once activated the TVS 
releases various vasoactive pep tides generating peripheral sensitiz ation of trigeminal and upper

Version No. PR-0005.03 CONFIDENTIAL Page 16of 78cervical nociceptors. The ensuing peripheral nociceptive stimuli synapse in the Trigeminal 
Nucleus Caudalis to ultimately create a state of central sensitization.8Clinically, this process is 
observed as a fully develope d attack of migraine.  
Central to this model of migraine is calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) . CGRP is one of the 
most abundant peptides in the human body and is produced in both peripheral and central neurons.  It is abundant in trig eminal neurons and when released  is involved in the vasodilation, 
inflammatory cascade, and pain transmission asso ciated with migraine. In both peripheral and 
central pain pathways CGRP is associated with pain transmission and neuronal sensitization.
9
Intravenous (IV) infusions of CGRP can cau se a migraine-like headache in susceptible 
individuals with migraine.10In addition, many pharmacological agents used as acute or 
prophylactic treatment of migraine are known to inhibit CGRP. Thus, CGRP is an attractive 
target for development of novel migraine pharmacology.
Currently the pharmacological treatment of migraine  can be divided into ac ute treatment, that is, 
medications designed to reverse a migraine after it is initiated and preventive treatment that is 
designed to protect the nervous system from generating migraine. Acute treatments are used 
intermittently only as needed to stop an attack while preventative treatments are used on a sustained basis for periods of months to years.  Acute treatment while generally quite effective 
can worsen the severity and frequency of migrai ne when used too frequently, a condition called 
medication overuse headache (MOH).
4MOH is common in populations with frequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_229175].[ADDRESS_385843] been designed 
specifically for migraine. These commonly include tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, and certain anticonvulsants. It is es timated that 45% of adults with  frequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_313386] 12% of this population are currently using a migraine preventive.
1In large 
measure, this is due to poor tolerability, lack of efficacy, and failure to adhere to treatment.  Clearly there is a medical need to develop effective, well-tolerated and safe preventive 
treatments for migraine.

(rats, rabbits, and monkeys) was c onfirmed in vivo by [CONTACT_313403]403 to inhibit CGRP-mediate d neurogenic dermal vasodilation.
In the single-dose nonclinical toxicology studies , the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) 
for IV administration of ALD403 to rats and cynomolgus monkeys was 100 mg/kg.
Toxicological investigations in rats and monkeys  indicated that repeated -dose IV administration 
of ALD403 at 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg once weekly for four weeks was well to lerated, with no signs 
of adverse effects related to treatment. Under the conditions of these studies, the no-observed-

for four weeks was 100 mg/kg.
A chronic multiple-dose toxicology study in cyno molgus monkeys was conducted to evaluate the 
potential effects by [CONTACT_169032]403 following 6-months administration via slow bolus injection once

by a three month recovery period in select animals. 
Following the sixth dosing occasion on study day 71, one low-dose (20 mg/kg/dose) female 
animal exhibited an anaphylactoid-like reacti on and died within approximately [ADDRESS_385845].Administration of ALD403 via intravenous (s low bolus) injection once every 2 weeks for 
approximately 6-months (for a to tal of 14 doses) did not result in  any treatment-related effects 
upon the parameters evaluated in this study.  The NOAEL for ALD403 following chronic 
administration in monkeys was considered to be 150 mg/kg/dose (Day 183 mean C

19,600/6,160 ȝg/mL; mean AUC (0-2wk) of 1,610,000/904,000 ȝg·h/mL for males/females, 
respectively).
ALD403 is not expected to interact directly with DNA or other chromo somal materials, and 
genotoxicity assessments have not been conducte d. The carcinogenic potential for ALD403 has 
not been thoroughly investigated. The results of toxicological and clinical investigations to date 
with ALD403 have provided no indications of effe cts with the potential to support or induce the 
proliferation of malignant cells.
Definitive embryo-fetal devel opment studies with ALD403 in rats and rabbits have been 
conducted.  The administration of  ALD403 by [CONTACT_33980] (slow bolus) injection to pregnant 
female rats on Days 6, [ADDRESS_385846] coitum, at 75 or 150 mg/k g/dose was well tolerated, and there was no 
evidence of embryo-fetal mortality (embryolethality), alterations in growth (fetotoxicity), or 
structural abnormalities (teratogenicity) in either species.  
The local tolerance of ALD403 was assessed following repeated-(once weekly) dose studies in 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys utilizing ALD 403 administered IV. Following the end-of-
treatment, no gross or microscopi c lesions were observed in the ALD403 injection sites excised

11.1. Adverse Events
11.1.1. Definitions
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occu rrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
participant administered a pharmaceutical prod uct that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE can th erefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), sympto m, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product , whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product. (ICH E6)
11.1.2. Assessment of Adverse Events
The Investigator is required to monitor the o ccurrence of adverse events for each subject from 
the time of informed consent through the course of  the clinical trial.  Adverse events may be 
reported by [CONTACT_423], reported by a caregiver, or reported by [CONTACT_313416]-ended questioning, through physical examination, laboratory 
test, documentation in medical records, or by [CONTACT_11174].  Adverse events include:
xAny new undesirable medical experience or an unfavorable and unintended change of an 
existing condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not considered related 
to the Investigational Product.
xAny abnormal assessment or laboratory findings considered by [CONTACT_313417].  Clinically significant findings include but are not limited to those 
that lead to discontinuation or interrupti on of study treatment, require therapeutic 
intervention, or require a change in subject management.
A new or worsening of a pre-existing or chroni c condition is considered an adverse event and 
must be reported as such.  Medical conditions, which existed prior to the time of informed consent into the clinical tria l, will not be considered an a dverse event unless the condition 
worsens.  Unchanged, chronic, non-worsening or pre-existing conditions from the time of 
informed consent are not adverse events and should not be recorded on the AE eCRF.

16 January 2018
Version No. PR-0005.03 CONFIDENTIAL Page 42of 78Severity
The severity of an AE will be graded as follows:
xGrade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.
xGrade 2 Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL).
xGrade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL.
xGrade 4 Life-threatening consequenc es; urgent intervention indicated.
xGrade 5 Death related to AE.
Relationship to ALD403
The Investigator is required to assess the ca usality/relationship betw een each AE and the 
ALD403 as not related or related and record th e assessment on the source documents and in the 
eCRF AE page. Medical judgment should be used to determine the likely relationship of the AE 
to the ALD403 considering all relevant factors including (but not limited to) relevant history, 
concomitant medical condition, and concomitant medications.  De termination should be based 
on assessment of temporal relationships, biologic pl ausibility, association (or lack of association) 
with underlying disease, and presence (or absence) of a more likely cause.  
Not Related: It is plausible that the AE has an etiology other than the ALD403 (e.g., pre-
existing condition, underlying disease, conc omitant medical condition, or concomitant 
medication).Related: The AE cannot reasonably be explaine d by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state,
concomitant\medical condition or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and a temporal relationship 
exists between the event onset and administration of the ALD403. 
Protocol ALD403-CLIN-[ADDRESS_385867] be reported if the 
Investigator considers there to be a causal relationship with ALD403. 
An SAE Notification Form should be used to repo rt any related SAEs which occur after the end 
of the clinical trial. Adverse events (AEs) should be recorded on the AE eCRF, whether believed by [CONTACT_313419]403. 
AE reporting should contain:
xA brief description of the event
xDate of onset 
xDate of resolution
xSeverity
xActions taken or treatment required 
xRelationship to Inve stigational Product 
xOutcome 
xWhether the event is considered serious
Whenever possible, the Investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a single 
diagnosis into a single event term.  For example, “cough, rhinitis, and sneezing” might be 
grouped together as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092].”
Asymptomatic abnormal findings considered by [CONTACT_3433] e Investigator to be clinically significant 
should be recorded as an AE, unless it is associated with a clinical syndrome that has already 
been reported as an AE.
11.1.4. Reporting Seriou s Adverse Events
All SAEs that occur during the period of obser vation, whether considered  to be related to 
ALD403 or not, must be reported within [ADDRESS_385868] be recorded in the source 
document.  To report the SAE, complete the eCRF AE page and indicate the reason for 
seriousness.  The minimum information required for an initial report is:
xSender of report (name, address of Investigator)
xSubject identification (screening/enrollment number, NOT subject name)
xProtocol number
xDescription of SAE (e.g., event term)
xSeriousness criteria
xRelationship assessment
After receipt of the initial repor t, the Medical Monitor or designee will review the information 
and, if necessary, contact [CONTACT_169049].  Alder, or Alder’s designee will be res ponsible for information processing and reporting in 
accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements. 
Alder will determine if an SAE requires expedited reporting to regulatory agencies.  The clinical 
trial site personnel are responsible  for reporting these events to their EC/IRB according to the 
institution’s EC/IRB reporting requirements a nd in accordance with applicable local and 
regulatory requirements.
Should the EDC System not be available, serious  adverse events must be reported on the paper 
SAE Notification Form. Additiona l details can be found in the Site Manual. This does not 
replace the EDC reporting system; information must be entered in the EDC system once the 
system returns to normal function.
11.1.5. Unexpected and Relate d Serious Adverse Events
Unexpected SAEs are those which:
xAre not previously reported as associat ed with ALD403, as referenced in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.
Protocol ALD403-CLIN-013
Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.
16 January 2018
Version No. PR-0005.03 CONFIDENTIAL Page 45of 78xMay be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an AE listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, but differ from the ev ent due to greater severity, frequency, or 
specificity.
Alder, or Alder’s designee will report, to the appropriate regulatory authorities according to local and regulatory requirements, unexpected SAEs  which are considered related to ALD403 
(suspected unexpected serious a dverse reactions [S[LOCATION_003]Rs]).  The clinical trial site personnel are 
responsible for reporting these events to their EC /IRB in accordance with applicable local and 
regulatory requirements.
11.1.6. Follow-up of Adverse Events
Irrespective of the suspected causality, AEs w ill be monitored until resolution, stabilization in 
the judgment of the Investigator, or the subject is lost to follow up or withdraws from the trial.
11.1.7. Clinical Laboratory TestsSerum chemistry tests include albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP ), alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ur ea nitrogen, calcium, bi carbonate, creatinine, 
globulin, glucose, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, to tal bilirubin, total choles terol, total protein, 
triglycerides, magnesium, and uric acid.
Hematology tests include hemato crit, hemoglobin, platelet count , red blood cell (RBC) count, and 
white blood cell (WBC) count with differen tials (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, 
eosinophils, and basophils).
11.1.8. Pregnancy
In the event that a female subject becomes preg nant following administration of ALD403 or may 
have been pregnant at the time of ALD403 exposure, or the partner of a male subject becomes 
pregnant following ALD403 administration to the male subject, the pregnancy must be reported 
to Alder within five business days of the In vestigator becoming aware of the pregnancy.  
Pregnancy information will be reported to Alder using the Exposure In-Utero Forms in EDC.  An 
Exposure In-Utero Notification Form should be used to report a pregnancy that occurs within [ADDRESS_385869] or congenital anomaly or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313393].  
Every attempt should be made to follow a pregnancy to conclusion.  
Follow-up information is to be collected by [CONTACT_313420]:
xThe course of the pregnancy including perinatal and neonatal outcome, premature
termination of the pregnancy, or miscarriage 
xOffspring information including birth weight and birth defects (if any) 
11.1.9. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior 
Recent meta-analyses, spontaneous reports, a nd published case reports regarding suicidal 
ideation and behavior arising from drugs tested in clinical trials have been noted as an area of 
general concern. Based on this  information, the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) has provided guidance to prospectively assess suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical 
trials to ensure that subjects in clinical trials who are experiencing suicidal ideation and behavior 
are properly recognized and adequately treated and to ensure the collection of more timely and 
more complete data on suicidal ideation and behavior than have  been collected in the past.12The 
C-SSRS (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale) will be used for this purpose.  Any subject who answers “yes” to questions [ADDRESS_385870] who answers “yes” to questions 4 or 5 in the Suicidal Ideation section or answers “yes” 
to any question in the Suicidal Behavior sec tion of the C-SSRS will be discontinued from the 
study treatment as specified in Section 8.4.1, and re ferred by [CONTACT_298909] a mental health 
specialist.  Affirmative answers to questions [ADDRESS_385871] amine, serum tryptase, immunogl obulin E, and complement 
components.
Whether maintained in a “formal crash cart” or separately, the following is a requirement at the 
site:
xCPR certification by [CONTACT_313421] (AED)
xEmergency medications including antihistamines, bronchodilators, IV saline, 
corticosteroids, acetaminophen, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_313394].

Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)
The PGIC includes a single question concerning the subject’s impression of the change in their 
disease status since the start of the study. Se ven responses are possible: Very Much Improved, 
Much Improved, Minimally Improved, No Change, Minimally Worse, Much Worse, Very Much 
Worse.
SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36 v2.0)
The SF-[ADDRESS_385872] 4 weeks.  See Appendix 15.4.  The eight sections measured 
are vitality, physical functioning, bodily pai n, general health perceptions, physical role 
functioning, emotional role f unctioning, social role functi oning, and mental health.  
EQ-5D-5L
The EQ-5D-5L is a descriptive system of health -related quality of life stat es consisting of five 
dimensions/questions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) 
each of which can take one of five responses. The responses record five levels of severity (no 
problems/slight problems/modera te problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a 
particular EQ-5D dimension. The EQ-5D-5L add itionally includes a VAS scale.  Each item will 
be summarized separately.
Headache Impact Test  (HIT-6 v1.0)
The Headache Impact Test (HIT) is a tool used to measure the impact and effect on the ability to 
function normally in daily life when a headache occurs. The HIT is a 6 question, Likert-type, 
self-reporting questionnaire with responses ra nging from “Never” to “Always” with the 
following response scores: Never=6, Rarely= 8, Sometimes=10, Very Of ten=11, Always=13. See 
Appendix 15.3. The total score for the HIT is the sum of each response score and will be treated

Most Bothersome Symptom (MBS)
At screening, subjects will identify migraine related symptom that is most bothersome for them.  
Subjects will be asked to rate the improvement in this symptom from screening on a seven-point 
scale identical to the scale used for the PGIC.
The Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS)
The MIDAS questionnaire measur es the effect headaches have on the subject’s daily 
functioning.  Midas is composed of five questions that ask about  the subject’s performance over 
the past 3 months.  The response to each question is provided in number of days which are 
totaled to determine the level of disability: 0- 5, MIDAS Grade I, Little or no disability; 6-10,
MIDAS Grade II, Mild disability; 11-20, MIDAS Grade III, Moderate disability; 21+, MIDAS 
Grade IV, Severe disability.
12.2. Pharmacokinetics
The concentrations of ALD403 will be measured  in plasma from all treated subjects using a 
validated assay. The PK analysis will include ev aluations of concentrati on-time profiles for free 
ALD403 on Day 0 (pre-dose and immediately post-dos e (within 15 minutes of end of infusion), 
and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 (pre-dose), 24 (pre-dose), 36  (pre-dose), 48 (pre-dose), 72 (pre-dose), and

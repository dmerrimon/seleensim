 4. SYNOPSIS 
Study title A Phase 2, Multicenter Study of Tesevatinib Monotherapy in Pati ents with Recurrent 
Glioblastoma 
Clinical phase Phase 2 
Number of study 
centers Up to 10 US centers 
Study background Tesevatinib (formerly known as KD019) is an orally-administered  tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
that has been documented to inhibit multiple molecular drivers of tumor growth, including 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_226792] (EGFR), human epi[INVESTIGATOR_12587] 2 
(HER2), Src, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). 
Tesevatinib has been evaluated in [ADDRESS_875624] 50 received the recommended dose  of 300 mg daily. The 
safety profile is similar to tha t of other agent s in the class,  with predominantly 
gastrointestinal (GI) and skin a dverse events (AEs). QTc prolon gation has also been 
observed, which appears to be dos e related. Efficacy has been o bserved in non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations. For further  information see the 
Investigator Brochure (Vers ion 7.0 dated 23 July 2015). 
Study rationale Gliomas account fo r 80% of primary malignancies of the central nervous system (CNS).  
Glioblastomas (World Health Organization (WHO) Grade IV astrocy tic tumors) account 
for 60–70% of gliomas and remain the most aggressive subtype. Gliob lastoma occurs 
mostly  in adults (median age of 64 years at diagnosis) with an estimat ed incidence of 2–3 
cases per 100,000 people in Europe and North America. With 1- a nd 5-year overall 
survival (OS) rates  of 29% and 3%, respectively, the prognosis of glioblastoma rema ins 
poor [ Central Brain  Tumor Registry of the [LOCATION_002] 2011 ] and there is a need to 
develop more effective therapeutic  approaches. 
Standard treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is surgical  debulking followed by  
[CONTACT_652400] (TMZ) with additional maintenance  TMZ [ Stupp 2005 ]. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_652352], al most all patients  relapse 
following initial therapy.  
Patients with recurrent glioblastoma have a median progression- free survival (PFS) of 
about [ADDRESS_875625] important 
prognostic factors for benefit from re-intervention  are pre-treatment performance status 
and patient age [ Kappelle 2001 ].  
Active  interventions include repeated surgery, re-irradiation, or syst emic therapy in order 
to improve or preserve neurological  function and prolong PFS and O S. Chemotherapy  
with TMZ demonstrated an increase in survival as second-line th erapy in initial trials. 
However, TMZ is now generally used as a component of first-line  treatment and hence  
there is no established chemotherapy regimen available for recu rrent glioblastoma [ Stupp 
2009 ; Stupp 2010 ]. Nitrosourea-based chemotherapy, either as single agents or i n 
combination regimens such as procarbazine, lomustine, and vincr istine (PCV), have 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-208

 shown some activity in Phase 2 studies of patients who progress ed after prior 
chemotherapy [ Schmidt 2006 ; Fabrini 2009 ]. Systemic treatment with the anti-VEGF 
monoclonal antibody bevacizumab has also shown some activity in  recurrent 
glioblastoma [ Friedman 2009 ]. Bevacizumab is currently approved for use in patients with 
progressive disease following prior therapy in the United State s but not in the European 
Union [ Avastin® USPI 2015 ]. The label specifically men tions that there are no data 
demonstrating an improvement in disease-related symptoms or inc reased survival. 
EGFR gene abnormalities occur commonly in glioblastomas, sugges ting that EGFR 
inhibition could be a useful clinical strategy. Studies indicat e that EGFR gene 
amplification and /or mutation ar e present in approximately 57%  of glioblastomas 
[Brennan 2013 ]. EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII), which leads to constitutive EGF R 
signaling, is seen in approximately 25% of glioblastomas [ van den Bent 2009 ]. Clinical 
trials of EGFR inhibitors in patients with glioblastomas have p roduced disappointing 
results, perhaps because the ava ilable agents have poor blood-b rain barrier (BBB) 
penetration. A Phase 2 trial of erlotinib, for instance, led to  a 6-month PFS rate of 11% 
with erlotinib, compared to 24% with physician’s choice of temo zolomide or carmustine 
[van den Bent 2009 ]. In vitro data suggest that some EGFR abnormalities will corr elate 
with clinical sensitivity to erlotinib [ Sarkaria 2007 ]. In addition to targeting EGFR, 
tesevatinib also has VEGFR2 inhi bitory activity, and there may be advantages to the 
simultaneous inhibition of EGFR and VEGFR2 in glioblastomas. Th us, although the 
determinants of glioblastoma responsiveness to EGFR inhibitors remain poorly defined, 
further research on the role of tesevatinib in glioma could be a productive approach to 
improving glioma treatment.   
Unlike other agents in its class, tesevatinib effectively penet rates into the brain, with 
levels in mice and rats with intact BBBs the same or higher tha n plasma levels [ Tonra 
2015 ].  Tesevatinib has levels in the  choroid plexus and meninges t hat are 10 times the 
plasma levels, suggesting that t esevatinib may penetrate well i nto cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] 
(CSF). There is preliminary evid ence of clinical benefit in pat ients with leptomeningeal 
metastases in NSCLC [Kadmon data on file]. Thus, there is a goo d biologic rationale to 
evaluate tesevatinib in patients with recurrent glioblastoma wh ich has progressed on or 
after prior therapy. Its role in  tumors with and  without the EG FR activating mutations, 
EGFR protein overexpression and gene amplification also needs t o be explored.

Study design This is a multicenter, Phase 2 st udy to assess the activity of tesevatinib in patients with 
recurrent glioblastoma. 
Screening and Study Treatment 
The availability of paraffin-emb edded tumor sample diagnostic o f glioblastoma is 
mandatory for entry into the study and should be provided with a copy of the original 
pathology report for central review. Tumor samples will be eval uated for the EGFRvIII 
mutation and for EGFR gene amplif ication. Tissue from recurrent  surgery is preferred, but 
tissue from initial surgery is sufficient for study entry. Base line magnetic resonance

 imaging (MRI) is mandatory within [ADDRESS_875626] ration. After completion 
of the screening assessments and confirmation of study eligibil ity, tesevatinib will be orally 
administered to all patients at a dose of 300 mg once daily.  
Patients who develop ≥ Grade 3 a dverse event considered by [CONTACT_652402] (with the exception of asymptomatic Grade 3 eleva tions of amylase or lipase, 
Grade 3 elevation of glucose in a patient receiving systemic co rticosteroids, Grade 3 
creatine phosphokinase [CPK] elevat ion in the absence of muscle  symptoms, or Grade 3 
sodium values ≥126 mmol/L in a p atient with diarrhea) will have  study treatment 
interrupted until the ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_875627] re solved to ≤ Grade 1 (refer to 
Section 9.1.3) .  
Once toxicities have resolved to ≤ Grade 1, the patient may res ume study treatment at a 
reduced dose of 250 mg/day. No more than one dose reduction is permitted. Patients who 
require more than one dose reduction will have study drug disco ntinued and enter the 
Follow-up Period. 
Patients for whom toxicity persi sts beyond 21 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_652353].   
If study treatment is withheld, the patient should be instructe d not to make up the withheld 
doses. 
Study treatment will continue until disease progression, unacce ptable toxicity, patient or 
physician decision to discontinue, or death.  Assessments for d isease response will occur at 
week 4 and 8 and then every 8 weeks using the RANO criteria (se e Appendix 2) .  
Upon treatment discontinuation, p atients will be followed every  8 weeks for survival. 
Tumor samples will be used for exploratory biomarker research i ncluding, but not limited 
to, evaluation of EGFRvIII expr ession by [CONTACT_9064] ( IHC) or real-time 
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).  An appropriate histopathologi cal definition and cutoff 
for EGFRvIIIpos tumors will be established, and outcome in this subpopulation will be 
evaluated in addition to the overall study population. 
To characterize the sa fety and tolerability profile of tesevati nib, patients will be monitored 
throughout the study for adverse events (all grades), serious a dverse events, and any 
adverse events requiring drug interruption or discontinuation.  Patients will undergo safety 
evaluations, including physical examination (PE), vital sign me asurements, hematology, 
serum chemistry, urinalysis and electrocardiogram (ECG).   
MRI will be used to evaluate the tumor at baseline (within 7 da ys of study drug 
administration). All MRIs taken on study patients will be submi tted to the sponsor for 
possible retrospective analysis (refer to Section 10.1) .  
Subjects who have completed 24 cy cles of treatment and who cont inue to tolerate treatment 
with KD019 may continue on study with bimonthly visits to clini c for drug dispensing, 
safety and efficacy assessment.

 End of Treatment Visit 
An End-of-Treatment visit is to  be performed as soon as possibl e after the patient’s last 
dose of study drug.  This may occu r at the visit at which disea se progression is diagnosed.  
The patient will continue to be f ollowed in the study for disea se progression and survival. 
Follow-Up Period 
A follow-up visit will occur 30 days (±5 days) after the last d ose of study drug. Patients will 
undergo PEs; vital sign measurements; hematology, serum chemist ry, urinalysis and ECG, 
all performed prior to the start of any new therapy.  This visi t may occur prior to [ADDRESS_875628] dose of stud y drug.  If progressive disease 
has not occurred at the end of the follow-up period MRIs should  be repeated every 8 weeks 
until disease progressi on per RANO criteria. 
Long-Term Follow-Up 
Patients are to be contact[CONTACT_80077] 8 weeks to asse ss progression status if 
not PD when study drug stopped, survival status and any subsequ ent anti-cancer 
treatment. If PD was not observed before the 30-day follow-up p eriod, patients will 
return for follow-up MRI until PD  is demonstrated or they start  a new anti-cancer 
treatment.  
As of Amendment 4, long-term fo llow-up will no longer be requir ed. 
Study 
population/Number 
of patients A total of approximately 40 patients with recurrent glioblastom a will be enrolled at up to 10 
US centers. 
Diagnosis and main 
criteria for inclusion Inclusion criteria :  
Patients will be included if they meet the following criteria: 1) Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent and  to comply with the 
study protocol as judged by [CONTACT_093] 
2) Age ≥ 18 years old  
3) Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥70% (see Appendix 1).
  
4) Stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids within 5 days prio r to study enrollment. 
5) Female subjects of childbearing potential have a negative pregn ancy test at 
screening. Females of childbear ing potential are defined as sex ually mature women 
without prior hysterectomy or who have had any evidence of mens es in the past [ADDRESS_875629] been amenorrheic for 12 or more  months are 
still considered to be of childb earing potential if the amenorr hea is possibly due to 
prior chemotherapy, anti-estrogens, or ovarian suppression. 
 Women of childbearing potential (i.e., menstruating women) must  have a 
negative urine pregnancy test (po sitive urine tests are to be c onfirmed by 
[CONTACT_239168]) documented within the 24-hour period prior to the f irst dose of 
study drug.  
 Sexually active women of childbe aring potential enrolled in the  study must 
agree to use two forms of accepted methods of contraception dur ing the 
course of the study and for [ADDRESS_875630] dose of s tudy drug.  
Effective birth control includes (a) IUD plus one barrier metho d; (b) on 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-[ADDRESS_875631] 3 months (e .g., oral, 
injectable, implant, transdermal) plus one barrier method; (c) 2 barrier 
methods.  Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms,  
diaphragms, and spermicides (cream s or gels that contain a chem ical to 
kill sperm); or (d) a v asectomized partner. 
6) For male patients who are sexually active and who are partners of premenopausal 
women: agreement to use two for ms of contraception as in criter ion [ADDRESS_875632] d ose of study drug. 
7) Histologically confirmed glioblastoma. A local pathology report  constitutes adequate 
documentation of histology for s tudy inclusion.  Patients with an initial diagnosis of 
a lower-grade glioma are eligible if a subsequent biopsy was de termined to be 
glioblastoma. 
8) First recurrence after concurrent  or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy . Imaging 
confirmation of first tumor progression or regrowth as defined by [CONTACT_652403] 
(see Appendix 2 ).  A minimum of [ADDRESS_875633] hav e elapsed from the completion  
of radiotherapy to study entry to minimize the potential for MR I changes related to 
radiation necrosis that might be misdiagnosed as progression of  disease, unless there 
is a new lesion outside the radiation field or unequivocal evid ence of viable tumor on 
histopathological sampling. 
9) Prior treatment with TMZ for low grade glioma or glioblastoma. 
10) No more than one prior line of s ystemic treatment for glioblast oma.  Concurrent and 
adjuvant TMZ-based chemotherapy , including the combination of T MZ with an 
investigational agent, is considered one line of therapy. 
11) Prior therapy with gamma knife or other focal high-dose radioth erapy is allowed, but 
the patient must have subsequent histologic documentation of re currence, unless the 
recurrence is a new lesion out side the irradiated field. 
12) Recovery from the toxic effects of prior therapy, with a minimu m time of: 
a) ≥ 28 days elapsed from the administration of any investigationa l agent 
b) ≥ 28 days elapsed from the administration of any prior cytotoxi c agents, except 
≥ 14 days from vincristine, ≥ 21 days from procarbazine, and ≥ 42 days from 
nitrosureas 
c) ≥ 14 days elapsed from administration of any non-cytotoxic agen t (e.g., 
interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid) 
13) Patients who have undergone recen t surgery for r ecurrent or pro gressive tumor are 
eligible provided that: 
a) Surgery must have conf irmed the recurrence 
b) There must be residual disease m easurable per RANO criteria e.g . 1 cm x 1cm 
c) A minimum of [ADDRESS_875634] 
elapsed prior to study entry

29) Inabilit y to swallow or absorb orall y-administere dmedication. 
Dosage and 
administration Tesevatinib will be administered at the dose of 300 mg once dai ly. Tesevatinib will be 
used in dosage strength of 100-mg, and 150-mg tablets. Patient diaries will be utilized to 
evaluate compliance.  One cycle will be defined as 28 days of t reatment.   
Tesevatinib should be taken in the morning (unless there is a p atient-specific rationale to 
take it regularly at a different time of day) and can be admini stered without regard to 
food intake.   
Duration of 
treatment/ 
Discontinuation Duration of treatment:  Patients will be treated with study dru g until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Discontinuation:  Patients who discontinue tesevatinib treatmen t will be followed for 
disease progression (if ap plicable) and survival.   
Concomitant 
medications  Concomitant treatment and medication information will be collec ted from the time the 
patient signs the informed consent form until [ADDRESS_875640] dose of study drug or 
until the patient starts a new treatment, and is to be reported  on the appropriate case 
report form (CRF). The generic name [CONTACT_18467] (or trade name [CONTACT_178962]) 
must be specified along with the  reason for use, and duration o f treatment. Additionally, 
all diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedures, whether re lating to malignancy or 
not, should be recorded in the CRF  including the date, indicati on, description of the 
procedure(s), and any clinical f inding. Any medication that is considered necessary for 
the patient’s welfare may be give n at the discretion of the inv estigator. Ancillary 
treatments will be given as medi cally indicated. The reason for  administration must be 
recorded on the CRF. Any changes in documented, permitted conco mitant treatment 
already being taken at the beginning of the clinical study must  be recorded in the CRF, 
noting the type of medication, the duration, and indication. 
Administration of acid-reducing medications should be avoided d uring the study as these 
agents may decrease exposure to t esevatinib. If acid-reducing a gents are needed, H-[ADDRESS_875641] no less than 2  hours before or after dosing w ith tesevatinib.

disease 
Safety assessments The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for A dverse Events (NCI 
CTCAE; Version 4.03) will be use d for grading toxicities. Safet y assessments will 
include AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), PEs including full neurologic exam, vital 
sign measurements, clinical safet y laboratory evaluations (hema tology, serum 
chemistry, and urinalysis), KPS, and ECGs.   
The AE reporting period for a pa tient enrolled in the study beg ins when the patient 
provides informed consent and is continued through [ADDRESS_875642] possibly related to 
tesevatinib should be reported to Kadmon. 
Vital sign measurements, including sitting blood pressure, puls e rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
and temperature will be monitored throughout the study. 
Plasma Concentration 
Evaluation of 
Tesevatinib Plasma samples for tesevatinib  concentration analysis will be d rawn predose of 
tesevatinib on Days 15 of Cycle 1; and predose of tesevatinib o n Day 1 of every 
subsequent cycle (up to cycle 6). Data from these samples will contribute to a 
population PK analysis, and will be used to explore exposure-re sponse relationships. 
Pharmacodynamic 
Evaluation Samples will be evaluated for th e EGFRvIII mutation and for EGF R gene amplification.   
Efficacy Disease assessments will be b ased on the RANO criteria [ Wen 2010 ] and will  comprise 
radiological assessments, clini cal assessments, and corticoster oid use 
(see Appendix 2 ). Per the study’s schedule of assessments, full disease  assessments 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-[ADDRESS_875643] stu dy drug administration and 
then every 8 weeks. Disease a ssessments as initially planned ac cording to the schedule 
of assessments  should be maintained regardless of treatment delays. Unschedule d 
disease  assessments may be performed at the discretion of the investiga tor to allow a 
decision  on further study treatment administration for individual patien ts. For patients 
who discontinue treatment for reason s other than progressive diseas e, disease 
assessment in the follow-up period should continue every 8 week s until disease 
progression. 
Radiological Assessment 
Radiological assessments will be p erformed using M RI scans. The  acquisition protocol  
for MRI (provided as a separat e document) will provide further details for scan  
standardization. All efforts sh ould be made to perform MRI scan s according to the  
corresponding specification in o rder to ensure that quality of MRI will be standardized  
among all sites. Consistency of subsequent MRIs should be ensur ed during all  
assessments for each patient, with the same technique being use d for evaluating lesions.  
Patients should be imaged on the same MRI scanner for the durat ion of the study. A 
1.5T or 3T scanner must be used for this study. The use of IV c ontrast should, as long as 
clinically possible, be kept consistent. The following sequence s of the entire brain must 
be acquired: 
 T1 pre-gadolinium 
 T2/FLAIR 
 T1 post-gadolinium 
Target Lesions: Lesions should b e measured on the greatest size  (bi-dimensional 
measurement of the longest cross- sectional diameters) observed either  on axial, coronal, 
or sagittal slices, and the most representative observed chosen  to be  followed for 
response evaluation (i.e., once selected at baseline, the plane  should be  maintained 
across the study, to allow comp arison). If there are multiple c ontrast-  enhancing lesions, 
a minimum of two of the largest lesions, and a maximum of five lesions, should be 
measured, and the sum of the products of the perpendicular  diameters of these lesions 
should be determined . Occasionally, the l argest lesions may  not lend themselves to 
reproducible measurements, and the  next largest lesions that ca n be measured 
reproducibly should be selected. For patients with recurrent di sease who  have multiple 
lesions of which only one or two are increasing in size, the en larging  lesions should be 
considered the target lesions for evaluation of response. 
Nontarget Lesions: All other le sions will be considered nontarg et lesions and should  
also be recorded. Rarely, unequiv ocal progression of a nontarge t lesion requiring 
discontinuation of therapy or development of a new contrast-enh ancing lesion may 
occur,  even in the setting of stable di sease or partial response in th e target lesions. These  
changes would qualif y as progression. 
Tumor measurements should be made by [CONTACT_31722]/radi ologist for  each 
patient during the study to the extent that this is feasible. 
A radiological assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) requires  
confirmatory imaging at least [ADDRESS_875644] suspected. 
Clinical Status 
Clinical deterioration is defined  as a decline in the Karnofsky  performance status from  
100% or 90% to ≤ 70%; a decline of ≥ 20% from 80% or less; or a  decline from any  
baseline value to 50% or less, f or at least 7 days, unless attr ibutable to comorbid events  
(e.g., seizures, medication adve rse effects, complications of t herapy, cerebrovascular  
events, infection, etc.). Clinical  status must be recorded as I mproved, Stable, or  
Worsened. 
Corticosteroid Dose 
At the time of each disease asse ssment, the corticosteroid inta ke will be compared with  
corticosteroid intake at the tim e of the last disease assessmen t. The changes will be  
recorded as Increased, Unchanged,  or Decreased. I ncreases or de creases in  
corticosteroid dose should be clinically justified. 
Note: Increases in corticosteroid  dose for reasons other than d isease control do not  need 
to be taken into consideration when making this comparison. 
Overall Disease Assessment 
Based on radiological assessment s, clinical status, and cortico steroid use, an overall  
evaluation of CR, PR, s table disease (SD), or  progressive disease (PD) should be made 
at each disease assessment after baseline  according to the RANO criteria ( Appendix 2 ). 
Progressive disease is defined as any of the following: 
 ≥ 25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameter s of 
enhancing  lesions (compared with baseline if no decrease or otherwise 
compared with the  smallest recorded sum [nadir] during the study) on stable 
or increasing doses of  corticosteroids 
 Significant increase in T2/FLAIR non-enhancing lesions on stabl e or 
increasing  doses or corticosteroids (compare d with baseline or best respon se 
after initiation of  therapy) 
 Appearance of any new lesions 
 Clear progression of nonmeasurable lesions 
 Definite clinical deterioration not attributable to other cause s apart from the 
tumor,  or to decrease in corticosteroid dose 
 Failure to return for evaluation as a result of d eath or deteri orating condition 
Note: Increase in corticosteroid dose alone, in the absence of persistent clinical  
deterioration related to tumor, will not be used as a determina nt of progression. Patients  
whose corticosteroid dose was in creased for new symptoms and si gns without  
confirmation of disease progression on neuroimaging do not qual ify for disease 
progression and should continue study treatment. If subsequent follow-up  imaging 
shows that this increase in cor ticosteroids was required becaus e of disease  progression, 
the date of progression should be the first timepoint at which the increase in

 corticosteroids was necessary. 
Patient Reported 
Outcomes and Mini-Mental State 
Examination Patient reported outcomes (PROs) of disease- and treatment-rela ted symptom severity 
and symptom interference will be  assessed using the MDASI-BT qu estionnaire. 
The MDASI is a validated and re liable self-report measure that was developed to assess 
symptom severity and interference [ Cleeland 2000 ; Armstrong 2006 ]. 
Thirteen items ask patients to r ate how severe the symptoms wer e when “at their worst” 
in the last [ADDRESS_875645] interfered with six areas of function (g eneral activity, 
walking, work, mood, relations with other people, and enjoyment  of life) in the last 24 
hours. The MDASI-BT (see
 Appendix 3 ) contains an additional nine items that assess 
symptoms and concerns specific to primary brain tumor patients (difficulty 
understanding, difficulty speaking, difficulty concentrating, s eizures, weakness, change 
in appearance, change in vision, change in bowel patterns, irri tability), for a total of 28 
items. 
Subjects completing 24 cycles of tesevatinib will no longer be required to complete 
patient reported outcomes and mini-mental state examinations. 
Statistical methods Analysis populations 
Adult patients with recurrent gli oblastoma, meeting all inclusi on criteria and no 
exclusion criteria, with availab ility of paraffin-embedded tumo r samples diagnostic of 
glioblastoma will be enrolled. 
Two subgroups of patients are defined as having: EGFRvIIIpos and EGFR 
amplificationpos tumors. 
Primary and secondary efficacy a nalyses will include all patien ts who were included in 
the study. The same analysis methods for the primary and second ary analyses will be 
applied to both the ITT po pulation and the EGFRvIIIpos and EGFR gene amplificationpos 
population. 
Safety analyses will include a ll patients who enrolled and rece ived at least one dose of 
study treatment (the safety population). 
All patients who take at least one dose of tesevatinib will be evaluable for safety and 
efficacy assessments. 
Patients who do not complete the study, for whatever reason, wi ll have all available data 
(up until the time of termination related to the reason they we re terminated) included in 
the analysis.   
For statistical purposes, comple tion of the study will be defin ed as six months after the 
last patient starts study treatment.  
The plasma concentration analysis  population will consist of al l patients who receive at 
least one dose of tesevatinib, and who have at least one sample  analyzed for plasma 
concentrations.

Sample Size Justification and power calculations: 
The power calculation is based o n simulations in the Weibull di stribution to describe the 
progression and survival times. The estimation of PFS-6 is done  using the Cox model. 
Based on a one-stage design, with a sample size of 40 patients in the overall population, 
a PFS-6 of 25% and median PFS of 4 .5 months, the t rial has 95% power to demonstrate 
an estimated PFS-6 >15%. Based on a one-sided test on a 5% sign ificance level, the trial 
has 95% power to show a signifi cant difference ab ove the null h ypothesis of 7% and 
80% power to show a significant difference above 10%. The study  is not powered to 
detect differences in th e secondary endpoints. 
 Interim Analysis 
An interim analysis is included with the possibility to stop fo r futility. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_652357]-6 rate of 5% and a desirable PF S-6 rate of 20% or 
more. The trial will continue aft er the interim analysis if mor e than 1 responders are 
seen in 21 patients giving a 72% probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_652358]-6 rate is ≤5%.   
Primary efficacy endpoint: PFS-[ADDRESS_875646]. The PFS-6  is defined as a patient 
being alive and progression fr ee at 6 months (24 weeks). Diseas e progression will be 
determined based on investigator  assessment with use of radiolo gical assessments, 
clinical status, and corticostero id use. Patients without a dat e of disease progression or 
death will be analyzed as censore d observations on the date of the last disease 
assessment; if no post-baseline di sease assessment is available , PFS will be censored at 
the date of 1st dose. 
The analysis of the primary endpoint and the estimation of PFS- [ADDRESS_875647] assumed to follow a gamma distribut ion. Thus, this is a 
shared Cox gamma frailty model. The model is used to estimate P FS-6 with 2-sided 
95% and 90% confid ence intervals. 
Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate median PFS with 
95% CI and the Kaplan-Meier curv e will be constructed to provid e a visual description 
of the PFS over time.  
Descriptive statistics overall an d for each parameter (radiolog ical assessment, clinical 
status and corticosteroid dose) in the disease progression asse ssment are presented for 
the entire assessment period as w ell as for 3-, 6-, and 9- mont h time points. 
The analysis of second ary and exploratory endpoints is describe d in Section 13.4.6  and 
will be further ou tlined in the SAP.

 5. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
5.1. Tesevatinib 
Tesevatinib (formerly known as KD0 19) is an orally administered  tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 
which has been documented to inhibit multiple molecular drivers  of tumor growth, including 
EGFR, HER2, Src, and VEGFR2.   
Tesevatinib is a highl y potent inhibitor of  the EGFR activating  mutations that, when present, 
drive the growth of non-small ce ll lung cancers and potentially  other solid tumors. When 
measured in HCC827 cells, whic h are human lung cancer cells wit h an EGFR exon 19 deletion, 
the IC50 for inhibition of EGFR pho sphorylation for tesevatinib  (0.6 nM) was very similar to 
that for erlotinib (0.8 nM), whic h is registered in this indica tion. The IC50 for inhibition of 
proliferation in the same cell line was 3.[ADDRESS_875668]  a cell line with activating EGFR 
mutations. The potential advantag e of tesevatinib over erlotini b is that tesevatinib is far more 
efficient at crossing the blood-br ain barrier. It is therefore a good candidate for  therapy of brain 
metastases and primary brain cancers which are driven by [CONTACT_281249] m utations. 
5.1.1.  Tesevatinib Nonclinical Toxicology 
Tesevatinib nonclinical toxicol ogy has been characterized in mu ltiple species using a variety of 
dosing regimens. Details are prov ided in the Investigator’s Bro chure. 
5.1.2.  Clinical Experience with Tesevatinib 
To date, the tesevatinib clinical  program consists of eight com pleted trials using the tablet 
formulation (six Phase 1 and tw o Phase 2 studies). One of the P hase 1 trials (KD019-104) in 
healthy volunteers compared the t ablet formulation to the liqui d formulation.  Four additional 
trials of the tablet formulati on are included, of which three a re ongoing; KD019-101 in 
autosomal dominant polycystic  kidney disease (ADPKD), KD019-[ADDRESS_875669] 
cancer, and KD019-206 in patients  with NSCLC; and one (KD019-30 1 in NSCLC) which 
recently closed due to slow enrollment.  
In these studies, over [ADDRESS_875670] received teseva tinib. The MTD in patients with solid tumor malignancies was 
determined to be 300 mg once daily. 
Further details of the clinical s tudies are provided in the Inv estigator’s Brochure. 
5.2. Safety Profile of Tesevatinib 
Tesevatinib has been evaluat ed in [ADDRESS_875671] 
frequently reported AEs associat ed with tesevatinib use are dia rrhea, skin rash, fatigue, nausea, 
cough, dyspnea, dry skin, vomiting, constipation, vomiting, ano rexia and QTc prolongation (see 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-208  
 
    
Kadmon Corporation 
  Page 34 of 113  
Confidential and 
Proprietary  03 Apr 2019
 Investigators Brochure for furthe r detail). The AEs of special interest are as follows (refer to 
Section 9.1.4  for instruction on management of these AEs):  
Diarrhea:   Diarrhea is an expected AE for agents like tesevatinib that h ave significant EGFR 
inhibitor activity. Grade 3 diarrhea was the dose-limiting toxi city. At doses below those that 
cause dose-limiting toxicity, diarr hea has been effectively man aged by [CONTACT_652409] 1. 
QTc Prolongation : In clinical trials of tese vatinib, cases of QTc prolongation have been 
observed.  
In patients with malignancies tr eated in the clin ical program a t ≥ 300 mg daily or 350 mg 
intermittently, the majority of w hom had advanced metastatic NS CLC, approximately 20% were 
found to have QTc prolongation base d on machine read ECGs at so me time during treatment that 
met the CTCAE v3 definition of an AE. The majority of these wer e Grade [ADDRESS_875672] been r eceived for the > 275 patients e xposed to tesevatinib.  
PK data from the clinical program  demonstrated that QTc prolong ation increased with increasing 
tesevatinib plasma c oncentration which cor related with dose adm inistered. 
Patients in this study will be monitored carefully for QTc prol ongation, and a central  laboratory 
will review all ECGs.    
Skin Rash:   Acneiform skin rash is an expected adverse event for agents l ike tesevatinib that 
have significant EGFR inhibitor activity. The ras h characterist ically involves the chest and face.  
Paronychial involvement, although cha racteristic of EGFR inhibi tors, has not been seen in 
tesevatinib studies.   
Clinical Chemistry:   Creatinine elevations hav e been observed up to Grade [ADDRESS_875673] been observed with  tesevatinib treatment. These 
were asymptomatic and reversible.   
Interstitial Lung Disease:  Non-fatal interstitial lung dis ease (ILD) has been reported in  
association with the  use of tesevatini b in one patient with NSC LC out of >275 patients exposed 
to tesevatinib.

 5.3. Rationale 
5.3.1.  Study Rationale 
Gliomas account for 80% of primary malignancies of the CNS.  Glioblastomas (WHO Grade IV 
astrocytic tumors) account for  60–70% of gliomas and remain the  most aggressive subtype. 
Glioblastoma occurs mostly  in adults (median age of 64 y ears at diagnosis) with an estimat ed 
incidence of 2–3 cases per 100,000 people in Europe and North A merica. With 1- and 5-year OS 
rates  of 29% and 3%, respectively, the prognosis of glioblastoma rema ins poor [ Central Brain  
Tumor Registry of the [LOCATION_002] 2011 ] and there is a need to develop more effective 
therapeutic  approaches.  
Standard treatment for newly dia gnosed glioblastoma is surgical  debulking followed by  
[CONTACT_652410] a dditional maintenance TMZ [ Stupp 2005 ]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_652361], almost all patients  relapse following initial therapy.  
Patients with recurrent glioblas toma have a median PFS of about  [ADDRESS_875674] important prognostic factors for benefit from re-inter vention  are pre-treatment 
performance status and patient age [ Kappelle 2001 ].  
Active  interventions include repeated s urgery, re-irradiation, or syst emic therapy in order to  
improve or preserve neurological function and prolong PFS and O S. Chemotherapy  with TMZ 
demonstrated an increase in survival as second-line therapy in initial trials. However, TMZ is now 
generally used as a component of first-line treatment and hence  there is no established 
chemotherapy regimen availabl e for recurrent glioblastoma [ Stupp 2009 ; Stupp 2010 ]. 
Nitrosourea-based chemotherapy, either as single agents or in c ombination regimens such as PCV, 
have shown some activity in Pha se 2 studies of patients who pro gressed after prior chemotherapy 
[Schmidt 2006 ; Fabrini 2009 ]. Systemic treatment with the  anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody 
bevacizumab has also shown some activity in recurrent glioblast oma [ Friedman 2009 ]. 
Bevacizumab is currently approved for use in patients with prog ressive disease following prior 
therapy in the [LOCATION_002] but not in the European Union [ Avastin® USPI 2015 ]. The label 
specifically mentions that ther e are no data demonstrating an i mprovement in disease-related 
symptoms or increased survival. 
EGFR gene abnormalities occur commonly in glioblastomas, sugges ting that EGFR inhibition 
could be a useful clinical strat egy. Studies indicate that EGFR  gene amplification and /or 
mutation are present in approxi mately 57% of glioblastomas [ Brennan 2013 ]. EGFR variant III 
(EGFRvIII), which leads to constitutive EGFR signaling, is seen  in approximately 25% of 
glioblastomas [ van den Bent 2009 ]. Clinical trials of EGFR i nhibitors in patients with 
glioblastomas have produced disa ppointing results, perhaps beca use the available agents have 
poor BBB penetration. A Phase 2 t rial of erlotinib, for instanc e, led to a 6-month PFS rate of 
11% with erlotinib, compared to 24 % with physician’s choice of temozolomide or carmustine 
[van den Bent 2009 ]. In vitro data suggest that some EGFR abnormalities will corr elate with 
clinical sensitivity to erlotinib [ Sarkaria 2007 ]. In addition to inhibiting EGFR, tesevatinib also 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-[ADDRESS_875675] BBBs the same or higher than plasma l evels [ Tonra 2015 ].  Tesevatinib 
has levels in the choroid plexus and meninges that are 10 times  the plasma levels , suggesting that 
tesevatinib may penetrate well in to CSF.  There is preliminary evidence of clinical benefit in 
patients with leptomeningeal met astases in NSCLC [Kadmon data o n file]. Thus, there is a good 
biologic rationale to evaluate t esevatinib in patients with rec urrent glioblastoma which has 
progressed on or after prior the rapy. Its role in tumors with a nd without and EGFR activating 
mutations, EGFR protein overexpression and gene amplification a lso needs to be explored. 
Glioblastomas are inherently inaccessible and challenging to as sess in terms of repeat biopsy for 
evaluation of treatment-relate d biomarkers. Circulating tumor D NA has shown promise as a 
peripherally accessible source of  biomarker information in glio blastoma [Touat 2015, Best 
2015]. 
  
5.3.2.  Rationale for Dosage Selection 
Tesevatinib administered as a single-agent at a dose of 300 mg daily has shown clinically 
significant activity in lung cancer studies i n patients with EG FR mutations.  In one study, the 
confirmed PR rate in patients wi th EGFR mutations was 57% (8/14 ), and an additional 3 patients 
with EGFR mutations h ad unconfirmed PRs. 
Tesevatinib 300 mg daily was selec ted from the regimens tested in the early clinical program 
based on its benefit-risk profile.

This is a multicenter, Phase 2 s tudy to assess th e activity of tesevatinib in patients (n =40) with 
recurrent glioblastoma. This study will be conducted at up to 1 0 sites in the [LOCATION_002]. 
The availability of paraffin-embe dded tumor sample diagnostic o f glioblastoma is mandatory for 
entry into the study. Tumor samples will be evaluated for the E GFRvIII mutation and for EGFR 
gene amplification. Tissue from r ecurrent surgery is preferred,  but tissue from initial surgery is 
sufficient for study entry. Baseline MRI is mandatory.  
After completion of the screening assessments and confirmation of study eligib ility by [CONTACT_652412] a n inclusion package, tesevatini b will be orally administered to 
all patients at a dose of 300 mg on ce daily. A cycle will be co nsidered as 28 days. Patients will 
be evaluated for efficacy acco rding to the RANO criteria. 
Patients who develop ≥ Grade 3 adv erse event(s) considered by t he investigator to be related to 
study drug (with the exceptions noted in Section 9.1.3 ) will have study treatment interrupted 
until the drug-related toxicities have resolved to ≤ Grade 1. O nce toxicities have resolved to ≤ 
Grade 1, the patient may resume study treatment at a reduced do se of 250 mg/day. No more than 
one dose reduction is permitted. Patients who require more than  one dose reduction will have 
study drug discontinued and ent er the Follow-up Period. 
Patients for whom toxicity pe rsists beyond 21 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_652362].   
If study treatment is withheld, t he patient should be instructe d not to make up the withheld doses. 
Section 9.1.3  provides detailed instructions  concerning dose interruptions a nd reductions. 
Study treatment will continue until disease progression, unacce ptable toxicity, patient or 
physician decision to discontinue , or death.  Asse ssments for d isease response will occur at week 
4 and week 8 and then every 8 weeks thereafter using the RANO c riteria ( Appendix 2 ).  
Upon treatment discontinuation, pati ents will be followed every  8 weeks for survival. 
Tumor samples will be used for e xploratory biomarker research i ncluding, but not limited to, 
evaluation of EGFRvIII expression by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC)  or real-time Polymerase 
Chain Reaction (PCR).  An appropria te definition and cutoff for  EGFRvIIIpos tumors will be 
established, and outcome in this subpopulation will be evaluate d in addition to t he overall study 
population.  
To characterize the safety and t olerability profile of tesevati nib, patients will be monitored 
throughout the study for adverse ev ents (all grades), serious a dverse events, and any adverse 
events requiring drug interrupt ion or discontinuation.  Patient s will undergo safety evaluations, 
including PE, KPS, vital sign measurements, hematology, serum c hemistry, urinalysis and ECG.   
MRI will be used to evaluate the tumor at baseline. All MRIs ta ken on study patients will be 
submitted to the sponsor for possible retrospective analysis. 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-[ADDRESS_875676] a rate 
of 25% is appropriate a s a preliminary test of activity in pati ents with glioblastoma, based on 
PFS-6 rates seen in randomize d studies with bevacizumab [ Weathers 2015; Taal 2014; Galanis 
2015 ]. The sample size of this st udy is also designed to permit the  comparison of results with 
EGFR amplified and non-amplified tumors, as well as EGFRvIII mu tated versus wild-type. The 
sample size is adequate to chara cterize the safety profile in p atients with glioblastoma. 
7.3. Conditions for Terminating the Study

 9.1.1.  Randomization and Blinding 
This is an open-label, non-randomized study. 
9.1.2.  Tesevatinib Administration 
Tesevatinib will be administe red at the dose of 300 mg once dai ly. One cycle will be defined as 
28 days of treatment.   
Study drug may be taken with or w ithout food at approximately t he same time every morning 
(unless there is a patient-speci fic rationale to take it regula rly at a different time of day). Patients 
should drink a full glass of wat er (approximately 8 ounces [240  mL]) immediately after study 
drug administration.  Grapefruit and similar (pomelo fruit, Sev ille oranges, etc.) products should 
be avoided for the duration of study treatment. 
Patients must be instructed not to make up missed doses unless the missed dose can be taken 
within [ADDRESS_875692] dose of tesevatinib.   
9.1.3.  Dose Modifications and Delays f or Toxicity Related to Study Dru g 
Patients who develop ≥ Grade 3 adv erse event(s) considered by t he investigator to be related to 
study drug (with the exceptions no ted below) will have study tr eatment interrupt ed until all drug-
related toxicities have resolved t o ≤ Grade 1. Once these toxic ities have resolved to ≤ Grade 1, 
the patient may resume study tr eatment at a reduced dose of 250  mg/day. No more than one dose 
reduction is permitted. Patients who require more than one dose  reduction will have study drug 
discontinued and enter t he Follow-up Period. 
The exceptions are: 
 asymptomatic Grade 3 elevations of amylase or lipase,  
 Grade [ADDRESS_875693] bone 
metastases,  
 Grade 3 elevation of glucose in a  patient receiving systemic co rticosteroids,  
 Grade 3 creatine phosphokinase [CP K] elevation in the absence o f muscle symptoms,  
 Grade 3 sodium values ≥126 mmol/L  in a patient with diarrhea) 
Patients for whom toxicity pe rsists beyond 21 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_652364] a reduced dose of 250 mg/day only with permission from the r esponsible Medical

 [IP_ADDRESS].  Study Drug Discontinuation 
Withdrawal of a patient from study treatment means that no furt her tesevatinib is administered 
but the remaining study visits or  procedures are performed and follow-up data are collected.  
A patient’s study drug may be prem aturely discontinued for any of the following reasons:  
 Progression of disease 
 An AE requires permanent  discontinuation of study drug 
 Voluntary withdrawal by [CONTACT_4676] 
 Protocol deviation 
 Patient lost to follow-up 
 Patient death 
 Termination of study by [CONTACT_652420]: 
 Resolution or stabilizatio n to baseline or Grade 1 
 The patient is lost to follow-up 
 The event is otherwise explained 
9.1.4.  Management of Adverse Events of Special Interest 
AEs of special interest include  the following:  diarrhea, skin rash, QTc(F) prol ongation, elevated 
serum creatinine, elevated serum amylase and ILD.  Unless other wise specified, study drug may 
be held for up to 21 days at the discretion of the investigator .   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Diarrhea 
Diarrhea should be managed with l operamide. On first occurrence  of Grade 1 diarrhea initiate 
loperamide and monitor patient’s  electrolytes and hydration sta tus. Patients with severe diarrhea 
who are unresponsive to loperamide  or other anti-diarrheals or who become dehydrated require 
interruption of study drug until resolution to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_875696] nous fluid administration. In ad dition, renal func tion and serum 
electrolytes, including potassi um and magnesium, should be moni tored in patients at risk of 
dehydration. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Skin Rash  
Skin rash should be managed according to locally accepted clini cal recommendations. Study 
drug may be held up to 21 days for Grade 3 rash.

 Suggestions for Rash Management [ Lacouture 2011 , Kiyohara 2013 , www.psoriasis.org ] 
Papulopustular (acneiform) rash: 
 Most common rash seen with EGFR inhibitors 
 Typi[INVESTIGATOR_652366] 
 Usually peaks at Week 4–6 
 Then will decrease in severity at Week 6–8 
 Post-inflammatory skin changes can last for months, so preventi on and reactive 
treatment are important 
Suggestions for preven tative treatment: 
 Patient education prior to star ting treatment on what to expect  
 Gentle cleansing of skin using mild soap products 
 Use of moisturizer twice dail y making sure to include hands, fe et and nails 
 Avoid sun when possible and use of sunscreen SPF 30 or higher ( preferably titanium 
dioxide or zinc oxide) 
 Hypoallergenic makeup when possible 
Suggestions for treatment once a rash appears (see Appendix 5  for steroid potency chart): 
 Ongoing use of treatments from ‘pr eventative treatments’ above 
 Grade 1 (<10 % BSA involved, with out pruritus or tenderness)

[IP_ADDRESS].  QT Interval Prolongation 
Patients should be carefully monitored for symptoms of arrhythm ia (i.e., dyspnea, chest pain or 
tightness, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dizziness ) and for epi[INVESTIGATOR_589665] . An ECG should be obtained if 
these symptoms occur. In addition, serum potassium and magnesiu m must be maintained within 
the normal range and may require additional monitoring or adjus tment if patients develop 
diarrhea. Medications with poten tial for QTc(F) prolongation sh ould not be used concurrently or 
started within 24 hours of tesevat inib administration (see Appendix 4) . 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Management of QTc(F) Interval Prolongation 
The following guidelines should be u sed in the management of QT c(F) prolongation.  Patients 
will have ECGs performed at tim es designated by [CONTACT_760] (r efer to Table 1 ).     
Grade 2 QTc(F) Prolongation: 
If the QTc(F) interval increas es to an absolute value of  ≥ 60 msec above baseline (predose on 
Day 1) but < 500 msec and the patien t is asymptomatic (does not  have palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dizziness, 
syncope, orthostatic hypotension, o r a significant ventricular arrhythmia on ECG), the following 
actions should be taken:

  Re-check and confirm concomitant medications for any medication s that may be 
contributing to QTc(F) prolongati on.  Consult the Medical Monit or for 
discontinuation of any medication found. 
 Check electrolytes, especially magnesium and potassium; correct  abnormalities as 
clinically indicated. 
Grade 3 QTc(F) Prolongation: 
If the QTc(F) interval increas es to an absolute value of ≥ 500 msec at any evaluation and if the 
patient is asymptomatic (does  not have palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dizziness,  syncope, orthostatic hypotension, 
or a significant ventricular ar rhythmia on ECG), then the follo wing actions should be taken: 
 Consult with Medical Monitor 
 Hold study drug 
 Re-check and confirm concomitant medications for any medication s that may be 
contributing to QTc(F) prolonga tion.  Consult Medical Monitor f or discontinuation of 
any medication found. 
 Check electrolytes, especially magnesium and potassium; correct  abnormalities as 
clinically indicated 
 Contact [CONTACT_652421] 
 QTc(F) :  When QTc(F) is within 30 msec of baseline or ≤ 470 msec (whi chever is 
lower), then study drug may be res tarted with one dose level re duction.   
 Following dose reduction and resum ption of study drug treatment , ECGs must be 
repeated weekly for 2 weeks, t hen on Day 1 of each cycle per pr otocol following 
restart of study drug. 
 Study drug may be restarted at the pre-event dose level if QTc( F) values of ≥ 500 
msec are not confirmed by [CONTACT_652422]-related 
abnormal ECG findings. This may be done as soon as the data are  confirmed. 
Grade 4 QTc(F) Prolongation: 
If the QTc(F) interval increas es to an absolute value of ≥ 500 msec at any evaluation, and if the 
patient is or has recently been s ymptomatic (has palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dizziness, syncope, orthostatic 
hypotension, a significant ventri cular arrhythmia on ECG), then  the following actions should be 
taken: 
 The patient should be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_652367] a thorough cardi ology evaluation 
 Do not dose with study drug again   
 Consult with Medical Monitor  
 Check electrolytes especially m agnesium and potassium; correct abnormalities as 
clinically indicated

Confidential and 
Proprietary  03 Apr 2019
  ECGs should be monitored until the  QTc(F) returns to within 30 msec above the 
average baseline value or ≤ 470 msec 
Study drug should be permanently discontinued if the cardiac/el ectrophysiology evaluation 
confirms that symptoms are the  consequence of a drug-induced QT c(F) interval prolongation.  
However, if the patient has objective tumor response, considera tion will be given to continuing 
treatment with tesev atinib at a reduced dos e after discussion w ith the Medical Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Elevated Serum Creatinine 
Patients with increases in serum c reatinine to > 2 × ULN should  be evaluate d for non-renal 
causes of renal dysfunction, suc h as dehydration due to diarrhe a.  Cystatin C values should also 
be utilized to evaluate renal f unction.  Dose interruptions and  reductions are not necessary in the 
absence of renal dysfunction. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Elevated Serum Amylase 
In the event of asymptomatic increase of serum amylase to > 1.5  × ULN, lipase, fasting 
triglycerides, and amylase iso enzymes should be monitored.  Tre atment should only be 
interrupted if clinical pancre atitis develops, corresponding to  Grade 3 CTCAE per Table 5 .  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Interstitial Lung Disease 
New or worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] s ymptoms suspi[INVESTIGATOR_652368]-reso lution CT of the chest to det ermine whether ILD is present.  
Tesevatinib should be discontinue d if interstitial lung disease  is suspected, and further 
management discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
9.2. Study Drug Accountability and Pa tient Treatment Compliance 
Drug accountability and patient treatment compliance will be as sessed using drug dispensing and 
return records, and the patient’s  study diary. The principal in vestigator is responsible for 
ensuring adequate accountability of all used and unused study d rug. While the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_652369](s) 
(e.g., pharmacist), the ultimate re sponsibility for drug contro l and accountability resides with the 
investigator.  This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study drug (quantity 
and condition) and the maintenan ce of patient dispensing record s and returned study product 
documentation.  Dispensing records will document quantities rec eived from Kadmon and 
quantities dispensed to patient s, including lot number, date di spensed, patient identification 
number, patient initials, and t he initials of the person dispen sing study drug.  Reasons for 
deviation from the expected disp ensing regimen also must be rec orded.  
At study initiation, the study m onitor will evaluate and obtain  a copy of each site’s written 
standard operating procedure fo r study drug disposal/destructio n in order to ensure that it 
complies with the requirements of Kadmon.  
At the end of the study, followi ng final drug inventory reconci liation by [CONTACT_2037], the study 
site will dispose of and/or de stroy any remaining unused study drug supplies, including empty 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-[ADDRESS_875697] use a concom itant medication during the stu dy, it is the responsibility of the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_652370]. 
Patients should avoid ingesti ng grapefruit, pomelo or Seville o range fruits (and juice) with 
tesevatinib or at a ny time during the study.  Patients should n ot take medications that are 
associated with a risk of QTc i nterval prolongation and/or tors ades de pointes. Additionally, 
patients are not permitted to take concomitant medications that  strongly inhibit (e.g., 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, eryth romycin, clarithromycin) or in duce (e.g., phenytoin, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], or phenob arbital) the CYP3A4 isozyme . Steroid medications are 
allowed. 
Administration of acid-reducing m edications should be avoided d uring the study as these agents 
may decrease exposure to teseva tinib. If acid-reducing agents a re needed, H-[ADDRESS_875698] no less than 2 
hours before or after dosi ng with tesevatinib.   
Since tesevatinib is a potent inh ibitor of MATE transporter pro teins, increased levels of 
concomitant medications that ar e secreted by [CONTACT_652405] l tubule cells into the renal 
tubule by [CONTACT_652423]. Thus subjects ta king cephalexin, cimetidine, 
dofetilide, fexofenadine, metformin, procainamide, and pyrimeth amine should be monitored 
carefully (see Appendix 4 ). 
Other prohibited treatments  include the following: 
 Other investigational drugs 
 Concurrent anti-tumor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_19335], gene ther apy, biologics, 
radiation therapy, or ot her immunotherapy 
 Warfarin or other anti-coagulan t drugs (Low dose low molecular weight heparin 
given for deep vein thrombosis ( DVT) prophylaxis is allowed) 
 Medications known to moderately or  severely inhibit the CYP3A4 isozyme or any 
drugs that are moderate or sever e CYP3A4 inducers.  A stable re gimen (≥ 4 weeks) of 
antidepressants of the SSRI cla ss is allowed (common SSRIs incl ude escitalopram 
oxalate, citalopram, fluvoxamine , paroxetine, sertraline, and f luoxetine)

  Drugs associated with torsades  de pointes or known to prolong t he QTc interval, 
including anti-arrhythmic medi cations within [ADDRESS_875699] of drugs that are clin ically relevant inhibitors an d inducers of CYP3A4, 
CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Management of Patients Requiring Concomitant Medications Associ ated with 
QT Interval Prolongation 
Tesevatinib has been associa ted with prolongatio n of the QT int erval. Patients requiring 
treatment with drugs known to be a ssociated with torsades de po intes or significant QT interval 
prolongation may not be enrol led into this study (see Appendix 4 ).  
Drugs associated with QT inte rval prolongation should be avoide d in patients receiving study 
drug unless deemed clinically nece ssary. Should a patient devel op a condition for which a 
medication known to affect QT inte rval is indicated, considerat ion should be given to the 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-208

 additive risk of QT interval  prolongation versus the potential benefit of treatment with the 
required medication and/or st udy drug.  Contact [CONTACT_652424]. 
As of Amendment 4 this will not be applicable—During long-term follow-up, patients who 
require short-term (2 to 3 weeks, not to exceed 21 days) treatm ent with a concomitant medication 
associated with QT interval pr olongation while receiving study drug should have the study drug 
held until the concomitant treat ment course is complete.  The d ecision about whether the patient 
can continue on trial following thi s interruption will be deter mined by [CONTACT_1689]. 
During long-term follow-up, patien ts who require chronic treatm ent with a concomitant 
medication associated with QT in terval prolongation while recei ving study drug should be 
monitored as follows: 
 Three ECGs should be obtained pri or to start of the concomitant  medication. These 
ECGs should be obtained within a t otal span of 30 minutes with an interval of 
approximately 1–2 minutes between recordings. 
 If the average QTc interval fr om these 3 ECGs is > 60 msec abov e the average 
baseline (Day 1 predose) value  or is ≥ 500 msec, study drug may  be discontinued or 
dose reduced after discussion w ith the Medical Monitor. 
 If both of the above criteria are  not met (i.e., the average QT c interval is no more than 
60 msec above baseline and is < 500 msec), ECGs should be obtai ned daily for the 
first 3 days of treatment with t he concomitant medication. 
 Additionally, an ECG should be obt ained weekly for 2 weeks, the n every 2 weeks for 
1 month and monthly thereafter un til the concomitant medication  is no longer 
required or study drug is discontinued. 
QTc interval prolongation should be managed as noted in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .

 10. EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
Disease assessments will be  based on the RANO criteria [ Wen 2010 ] and will  comprise 
radiological assessments (MRI), c linical assessments (KPS), and  corticosteroid use.  Based on 
radiological assessments, clini cal status, and corticosteroid u se, an overall  evaluation of CR, PR, 
SD, or  PD should be made at each disease assessment after baseline  according to the RANO 
criteria ( Appendix 2 ).  
Disease assessment during the s creening period is to be perform ed within [ADDRESS_875700] be us ed as the baseline radiologic al assessment. Per the study’s 
schedule of assessments (see Table 1 ), disease assessment is inte nded to be done prio r to starting 
cycle 2, 3, 5, 7+.  The corticoster oid dose should be kept stab le for [ADDRESS_875701] study treatment and t hen every 8 weeks (at Week 16, 24 , etc.), regardless of treatment 
delays. For patients who discont inue treatment for other reason s than PD, disease assessment in 
the follow-up period should continue every 8 weeks (according t o the original schedule) until 
disease progression. For patients with PD, disease assessment a t the EOS is only required if not 
performed within the previous 8 weeks. 
Disease assessments as initiall y planned according to the sched ule of assessments  should be 
maintained regardless of treat ment delays. Unscheduled disease  assessments may be performed 
at the discretion of the inves tigator to allow a decision  on further study treatment administration 
for individual patients. For patients who  discontinue treatment for reas ons other than progressive 
disease, disease assessment in  the follow-up period should cont inue every 8 weeks (according to 
the original schedule)  until disease progression. 
10.1. Radiological Assessment by [CONTACT_652425] (provided as a separate  document) will provide further details 
for scan  standardization. All efforts s hould be made to perform MRI scan s according to the  
corresponding specification in orde r to ensure that quality of MRI will be standardized  among all 
sites. Consistency of subsequent MRIs should be ensured during all assessments for each patient, 
with the same technique being us ed for evaluating lesions.  Patients should be imaged on the 
same MRI scanner for the duration of the study. A 1.5T or 3T sc anner must be used for this 
study. The use of IV contrast s hould, as long as clinically pos sible, be kept consistent.  
The following sequences of the ent ire brain must be acquired: 
 T1 pre-gadolinium 
 T2/FLAIR 
 T1 post-gadolinium 
Target Lesions: Lesions should be  measured on the greatest size  (bi-dimensional measurement of 
the longest cross-sectional  diameters) observed either  on axial, coronal, or sagittal slices, and the 
most representative observed chosen to be  followed for response evalua tion (i.e., once selected at 
baseline, the plane should be  maintained across the study, to a llow comparison). If there are  
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-[ADDRESS_875702] multiple lesions of which only 
one or two are increasin g in size, the enlarging  lesions should be considere d the target lesions for 
evaluation of response. 
Nontarget Lesions: All other le sions will be c onsidered nontarg et lesions and should  also be 
recorded. Rarely, unequivocal pr ogression of a nontarget lesion  requiring discontinuation of 
therapy or development of a new contrast-enhancing lesion may o ccur,  even in the setting of 
stable disease or partial respons e in the target lesions. These  changes would qualify as 
progression.  
Tumor measurements should be made  by [CONTACT_31722]/radi ologist for  each patient 
during the study to the exten t that this is feasible. 
A radiological assessment of com plete response (CR) or partial response (PR) requires  
confirmatory imaging at least [ADDRESS_875703] format with unique 
descriptive file names (e.g. s tudy number, patient initials and  number, date and image sequence 
number) on to anonymized DVD(s) a nd provide these to the Sponso r upon request. 
10.2. Clinical Status by [CONTACT_652426] a decline in the Karnofsky  performance status ( Appendix 1 ) 
from  100% or 90% to ≤ 70%; a decline of ≥ 20% from 80% or less; or a  decline from any  
baseline value to 50% or less, for at least 7 days, unless attr ibutable to comorbid events  (e.g., 
seizures, medication adverse effects, complications of therapy,  cerebrovascular  events, infection, 
etc.). Clinical status must be recorded as Improved, Stable, or  Worsened. 
10.3. Corticosteroid Dose 
At the time of each disease assessment, the corticosteroid inta ke will be compared with  
corticosteroid intake at the time of the last disease assessmen t. The changes will be  recorded as 
Increased, Unchanged, or Decreased. Increases or decreases in  corticosteroid dose should be 
clinically justified. 
Note: Increases in corticosteroid dose for reasons other than d isease control do not  need to be 
taken into consideration when making this comparison.

CR, PR, SD, or  PD should be made at each diseas e assessment after baseline  according to the 
RANO criteria ( Appendix 2 ).

 11. SAFETY 
11.1. Safety Parameters 
The NCI-CTCAE; Version 4.03 will be  used for grading toxicities  unless otherwis e specified.  
Patients will be monitored throughou t the treatment and follow- up period for occurrence of AEs 
(acute, delayed, and/or cumulative) , as well as for changes in clinical status, vital sign 
measurements, and laboratory data .  Safety parameters to be mea sured/assessed include vital sign 
measurements, physical examinations, concomitant medications, h ematology, serum chemistries, 
urinalysis, pregnancy testing, E CGs, and Karnofsky performance status.  
11.2. Adverse Event Definition 
An adverse event (AE) is defi ned as any untoward medical occurr ence associated with the use of 
a drug in humans, whether or not c onsidered drug related.  AEs include: 
 Suspected adverse drug reactions  (abbreviated as either SADR or  SAR). This may be 
serious or not serious. 
 Reactions from drug overdose, abus e, withdrawal, sensitivity, o r toxicity. 
 Significant changes or abnormalities, when compared to baseline , in structure (sign), 
function (symptom), clinical labor atory results, ECG results, o r physiological testing.  
This includes any worsening of a  pre-existing condition tempora lly associated with 
the use of study drug. 
 Other medical events, regardles s of their relationship to the s tudy drug, such as injury, 
surgery, accidents, extensions of  symptoms, or apparently unrel ated illnesses. 
Findings existing prior to signing informed consent will be rec orded as medical history.  For the 
purpose of data collection, all un toward events that occur afte r informed consent through [ADDRESS_875704] dose of study treat ment are to be recorded on eCRFs by [CONTACT_2727].  This 
requirement includes AEs from uns cheduled as well as scheduled visits.  
An AE does not include:  
 Medical or surgical procedures  (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth  extraction, 
transfusion); when the conditi on that leads to the procedure is  an AE. 
 Pre-existing diseases, or conditions or laboratory abnormalitie s present or detected 
prior to the screening vis it, those do not worsen. 
 Situations where an untoward m edical occurrence has not occurre d (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_652371], social, and/or convenienc e admissions). 
 Overdose of either tesevatini b or a concomitant medication with out any signs or 
symptoms, unless the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913].

 11.3. Evaluating Adverse Events 
The investigator will determin e the seriousness, intensity, and  causality of an AE associated with 
the use of the study drug (i.e., e vents where there is a reason able possibility that the event may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_5257]) based on the definitions th at follow. 
11.3.1.  Serious Adverse Events 
(Notify sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_875705] awareness) The SAE definition and reporting requirements are in accordance  with the ICH Guideline for 
Clinical Safety Data Manageme nt, Definitions, and Standards for  Expedited Reporting, 
Topic E2A, with Title 21 Par t CFR 312.32, and the Guidance for Industry and Investigators 
Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies. 
SAE:  An adverse event is consid ered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death:   This includes any death that occu rs while the patient is “on study” as well as 
any death that occurs within [ADDRESS_875706] dose of study d rug administration.  
Note : Death is an outcome of an AE , and not an AE in itself.  The e vent(s) that 
caused death (e.g., illness, accident) is the SAE.  Death due t o any other 
cause(s) must also be reported as an outcome of the reportable SAE. 
 Life-threatening adverse event:   An AE or suspected adver se reaction is considered 
“life-threatening” if, in the vi ew of either the investigator o r sponsor, its occurrence 
places the patient or patient at immediate risk of death. It do es not include an AE or 
suspected adverse reaction that, ha d it occurred in a more seve re form, might have 
caused death).  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_331325]:  In the 
absence of an AE, the investigat or should not rep ort hospi[INVESTIGATOR_652372].  This is the case in the following situations:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_652373] r a procedure 
required by [CONTACT_760] 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_629196] r outine procedure 
followed by [CONTACT_91294] 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_652374] y visits or annual physicals 
In addition, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_652375] a pre-existing condition 
which has not worsened does not count as an SAE.   
 Persistent or significant incap acity or substant ial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-208  
 
    
Kadmon Corporation 
  Page 64 of 113  
Confidential and 
Proprietary  03 Apr 2019
  Important medical event:  An eve nt that may not result in death , be life 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_652376], based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patien t and may require 
medical or surgical interventi on to prevent one of the outcomes  listed in this 
definition.  
Some serious events will not be  reported as SAEs, including: 
 Disease progression 
 Death due to disease progressi on occurring more than [ADDRESS_875707] dose of 
study drugs 
 Medical or surgical procedures  when the condition that leads to  the procedure is an 
AE 
 Pre-existing diseases, or conditions or laboratory abnormalitie s present or detected 
prior to the screening vi sit, that do not worsen 
 Situations for which an untowar d medical occurrence has not occ urred 
(e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149519] e surgery, social and/or conv enience admissions) 
11.3.2.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
(Notify sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_875708] awareness) 
A suspected unexpected serious  adverse reaction is any adverse drug event, the specificity or 
severity of which is not consiste nt with those noted in the cur rent protocol and/or Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).  This refers to any AE that has not been previou sly observed (e.g., included in the 
IB), rather than from the pers pective of such an event not bein g anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the product.  
11.3.3.  Unexpected Adverse Events 
An AE is considered “unexpected ” if it is not listed in the Inv estigator Brochure (IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or seve rity that has been observed; o r, if an IB is not req uired or available, 
is not consistent with the risk i nformation described in the Ge neral Investigational Plan or 
elsewhere in the current applica tion. Also refers to AEs that a re mentioned in the IB as occurring 
with a class of drugs or as anti cipated from the pharmacologica l properties of the drug, but are 
not specifically mentioned as occu rring with the particular dru g under investigation. 
11.3.4.  Non-Serious Adverse Events 
All other AEs, not fulfilling t he previous definitions, are cla ssified as non-serious. 
11.3.5.  Protocol-Related Adverse Events 
AEs that are not test drug relat ed may nevertheless be consider ed by [CONTACT_652427].  That is, the event may be 
related to the fact t hat a patient is participating in the stud y.  For example, a protocol-related AE 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-208  
 
    
Kadmon Corporation 
  Page 65 of 113  
Confidential and 
Proprietary  03 Apr 2019
 may be an event that occurs duri ng a washout period or that is related to a pro cedure required by 
[CONTACT_760]. 
11.3.6.  Relationships/Causality to Study Drug 
The investigator wi ll attempt to assess t he relationship of the  event to study dr ug using a 5- point 
scale (not related, unlikely-re lated, possibly related, probabl y related, or defin itely related). 
11.3.7.  Recording Adverse Events 
All AEs (including SAEs) are t o be accurately recorded on the A dverse Event page of the 
patient’s eCRF.  The date of onset  as well as the duration of t he event also should be recorded.  
In addition, the method used to t reat the AE and the outcome of  the AE also will be noted.  The 
investigator will assess the relationship of the event to study  drug (not related, unlikely-related, 
possibly related, probably relat ed, or definitely related). 
11.3.8.  Adverse Event Monitoring and Follow-up 
The investigator will follow a ll patients who experience advers e events until there is a return to 
the patient’s baseline cond ition, Grade [ADDRESS_875709] be schedu led and the specific tests 
repeated or performed as necessary.  Where a diagnosis is possi ble, it is preferable to report this 
diagnosis rather than a series of  terms (signs/symptoms) relati ng to the diagnosis.  
11.3.9.  Laboratory and ECG Abnormalities 
For the purposes of grading cre atinine, the uppe r limit of norm al – not the patient’s baseline 
value - will be used to determine grade. 
For the purpose of grading sodium, values of 126–130 mmol/L wil l be considered to be Grade 2 
and values of 120–125 mmol/L will be considered Grade 3.   
For the purposes of this study, ECG abnormalities will be handl ed in the same manner as 
laboratory abnormalities. 
Non-Clinically Significant ( NCS) Laboratory Abnormalities 
All laboratory results must be  filed in the patient’s medical r ecord and be monitored. The 
investigator must review labor atory results in a timely manner demonstrated by [INVESTIGATOR_59844]/date 
and assignment of clinical signi ficance assessment.  Non-clinic ally-significant laboratory 
abnormalities, i.e., minor deviations from the normal range, ar e expected and it is likely that no 
medical intervention will be required.  Such results will not b e considered to be AEs. 
Clinically Significant (CS) Laboratory Abnormalities 
Any laboratory abnormality that is considered to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator will 
be recorded on the AE eCRF.  A clin ically significant abnormal test result will  be considered an 
AE if:  
 It is not associated with an a lready reported AE, diagnosis or pre-existing condition

  There is a change in concomitant  medication or intervention as needed, in direct 
response to the laboratory result 
 The investigator exercises his/ her discretion to make significa nce determinations for 
any patient laboratory result or r esult that requires intervent ion 
All such lab abnormalities will be repeated and assessed by [CONTACT_11168], or licensed (MD), as 
soon as possible for “seriousness” and if they meet the regulat ory definition of “serious”, they 
will be reported as SAEs followi ng regulatory and  protocol requ irements.  Repeat laboratory 
tests may be run in order to monitor the result.  
Serious Laboratory Abnormalities 
Any lab abnormality meeting the regulatory definition of “serio us” must be recorded on both the 
AE eCRF/record and the SAE Form.  If a patient experiences a se rious toxicity or dies, the FDA 
will be notified within [ADDRESS_875710] noti fy the Kadmon Medical Monitor as 
soon as possible. 
If the outcome of the pregnanc y meets any criterion for classif ication as a SAE (including 
stillbirth, neonatal death, spont aneous abortion, or congenital  anomaly – including that in an 
aborted fetus) the investigator m ust follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Any neonatal 
death occurring  30 days after birth will be reported as a SAE. 
11.3.11.  Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Governing Regulatory Requirements 
Compliance with this request for  prompt reportin g is essential in that the sponsor is responsible 
for informing the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well  as all other participating 
investigators of the event.  
Under FDA ruling (US Code of Fed eral Regulations, Title 21 CFR Part 312.32) and the 
Guidance for Industry and Investig ators Safety Reporting Requir ements for INDs and BA/BE 
Studies, the sponsor is required to submit written documentatio n, in the form of an IND safety 
report, detailing: 
 Any event associated with the us e of the drug, that is both ser ious and unexpected, or  
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-208  
 
    
Kadmon Corporation 
  Page 67 of 113  
Confidential and 
Proprietary  03 Apr 2019
  Any findings from clinical, epi[INVESTIGATOR_652377], or pooled analysis  of multiple studies or 
any findings from animal or in v itro testing that suggest a sig nificant risk in humans 
exposed to the drug.  
Written submission must be made by [CONTACT_652428] t he IRBs as soon as possible 
and in no event later than 15 cale ndar days after the sponsor’s  initial notification of the event.  
Any unexpected fatal or life-thre atening suspected adverse reac tion must be reported to FDA no 
later than 7 calendar days after  the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information . The sponsor shall 
also inform all investigators. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Time-Frame for Reporting 
Any death, pregnancy, or SAE expe rienced by a patient from the time of informed consent until 
[ADDRESS_875711] be promptl y reported (within 24 hours of the  investigator becoming aware of 
the event) by [CONTACT_160240]  (or designee). Fax: 646-430-[ADDRESS_875712] the SAE for m via email to 
[EMAIL_6461]. 
The investigator will be able to  contact [CONTACT_652429]: 
Sanjay Aggarwal, MD 
Vice President Clinical Development Kadmon Corporation [ADDRESS_875713] Cambridge, MA [ZIP_CODE] Phone:  [PHONE_6906] 
 E-mail:   [EMAIL_12384] 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Information to be Provided by [CONTACT_652430]. This requirement in cludes all SAEs that occur 
after informed consent and thr ough [ADDRESS_875714] dose of study treat ment. 
The minimum information required for SAE reporting includes ide ntity of investigator, site 
number, patient number, an event  description, SAE term(s), onse t date, the reason why the event 
is considered to be serious (i.e ., the seriousness criteria) an d the investigator’s assessment of the 
relationship of the event to s tudy treatment (not related, unli kely-related, possibly related, 
probably related, or definitely r elated). Additional SAE inform ation including medications or 
other therapeutic measures used t o treat the event, action take n with the study treatment due to 
the event, and the outcome/resolution of the event will be reco rded on the SAE form. Forms for 
reporting SAEs will be provided to the study sites. 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-[ADDRESS_875715] ed by [CONTACT_486524]. 
When reporting SAEs, the followi ng additional points should be noted: 
 When the diagnosis of an SAE is  known or suspected, the investi gator should report 
the diagnosis or syndrome as the  primary SAE term, rather than as signs or 
symptoms.  Signs and symptoms ma y then be described in the even t description.  For 
example, dyspnea should not be used as an SAE term if the diagn osis which caused 
the dyspnea is known to be malignant pleural effusion.  There i s no requirement that 
the chosen SAE term be listed in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Advers e Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03. 
 Death should not be reported as an  SAE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE, unless 
the event preceding the death is unknown.  In the exceptional c ase where the events 
leading to death are  unknown, then death may be used as an even t term.  If an autopsy 
was performed, the autopsy r eport should be provided.  
 While most hospi[INVESTIGATOR_652378], so me hospi[INVESTIGATOR_486503], as follows:  
 Elective or previously schedul ed surgery, e.g. a previously sch eduled ventral 
hernia repair 
 Procedures for pre-existing conditions that have not worsened a fter initiation of 
treatment 
 Pre-specified study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_331359] 
 Events that result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_486505] 24 hours and that do not require 
admission, e.g. an emergency room visit for hematuria that resu lts in a diagnosis 
of cystitis and discharge to home on oral antibiotics 
 SAEs must, however, be reported f or any surgical or procedural complication 
resulting in prolongation  of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
11.3.12.  Regulatory Reporting 
Kadmon Drug Safety (or designee) will process and evaluate all SAEs as soon as the reports are 
received.  For each SAE receive d, Kadmon will make a determinat ion as to whether the criteria 
for expedited reporting have been met. 
Kadmon (or designee) will submit SA Es that meet the criteria fo r expedited reporting to the 
Regulatory Authorities in accord ance with local regulations gov erning safety reporting.  
Reporting of SAEs by [CONTACT_652431] a nd policies of the IRB. Adequate  documentation must be 
maintained showing that the IRB was properly notified.

 11.3.13.  Follow-up Information on a Serious Adverse Event 
Appropriate diagnostic tests shoul d be performed and therapeuti c measures, if indicated, should 
be instituted.  Appropriate cons ultation and follow-up evaluati ons should be carried out until the 
event has returned to baseline or is otherwise explained by [CONTACT_11168].   
Follow-up data concerning the SAE  (e.g., diagnostic test report s, physician's summaries, etc.) 
also must be submitted to Kadmon, as they become available, by [CONTACT_589732], 
until resolution of the SAE. 
11.4. Other Safety Considerations 
11.4.1.  Medication Errors 
Any medication error that results  in an AE, even if it does not  meet the definition of serious, 
requires reporting within 24 hours t o the Medical Monitor.  An overdose of tesevatinib without 
any associated signs or symptom s, unless the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_652379], will not 
constitute an AE but will be reco rded as a protocol deviation.  
11.4.2.  Follow-Up of Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE that led to treatment  discontinuation (including clinic ally significant abnormal 
laboratory values that meet t hese criteria) and is ongoing [ADDRESS_875716] be followed until either resolution of the event  or determination by [CONTACT_652432] s returned to base line/resolved, Grade [ADDRESS_875717] dose of study drug, with subsequent 
study days numbered seque ntially thereafter.  
If significant changes from ba seline are noted during the cours e of the study, additional 
unscheduled clinic visits may be  undertaken by [CONTACT_093] , or requested by [CONTACT_456], in 
order to determine both the relev ance of the finding(s) and the  duration of the event(s). 
12.1. Procedures to be Performed 
12.1.1.  Informed Consent 
All patients must take part in th e informed consent process. Ad equate time must be allowed for 
the patient to ask questions a nd make a voluntary decision. No protocol-specific procedures, 
including screening procedures t hat are not standard of care pr ocedures, are to be performed until 
the patient has signed and da ted an IRB/IEC-approved ICF. 
12.1.2.  Demographics and Medical History 
A complete medical history will be taken.  Medical history incl udes clinically significant 
diseases, surgeries, h istory of glioblastoma  (including date of diagnosis, history of prior low-
grade astrocytoma, location of disease,  prior cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649]), and all 
medications (e.g., prescription drugs,  over-the-counter drugs, herba l/homeopathic remedies, 
nutritional supplements) used by  [CONTACT_25701] 28 days pr ior to randomization. 
Demographic data will include age,  sex, and self-reporte d race/ethnicity. 
12.1.3.  Complete and Abbreviated Physical Examinations 
On days in which a complete physi cal examination is required, t he investigator should perform a 
thorough examination of all body sys tems (exception: genitourin ary and reproductive should be 
symptom-directed). On days in w hich a limited physical examinat ion is required, the investigator 
should inquire about signs/symptom s, general appearance, eyes, heart and pulse, lungs, abdomen 
(liver/spleen), kidneys, and neurol ogical (symptom directed onl y). Interval hi story should be 
recorded at all study visits. 
12.1.4.  Detailed Neurologi cal Examination 
Neurological exam should include f ull cranial nerve central and  peripheral, motor and sensory 
assessments.

 12.1.5.  Vital Sign Measurements 
Vital sign measurements will be col lected after the patient has  been sitting for 5 minutes. Vital 
sign assessments will include measurements of sitting blood pre ssure (mm Hg), heart rate (beats 
per minute), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (b reaths per minute), and tempera ture (Celsius/Fahrenheit).   
Please note that blood pressure m easurements are to be performe d using the appropriate 
technique (per guidelines of the  American Heart Association). S pecifically, patients should be 
seated quietly for at least 5 mi nutes in a chair with their bac ks supported, their fe et flat on floor 
(legs uncrossed), and their arm s bared on a hard surface, with the arm slightly abducted and bent, 
with palm up and the midpoint of upper arm at heart level. Corr ect cuff and bladder size should 
be utilized. Record cuff size , arm used, and patient’s position  (if not seated). 
12.1.6.  Hematology andSerum Chemistries. 
Samples for laboratory assessments (hematology andserum chemist ries) are to be  collected.  A 
Local laboratory will perform he matology andserum chemistry tes ts and results will be provided 
to the investigator.  Blood and ur ine samples for hematology, s erum chemistry will be prepared 
using standard procedures. Labor atory panels are defined as lis ted in

starting on a new therapy.  This may occur prior to [ADDRESS_875720] dose of 
study drug.  Assessments for the 30-day follow up may be done b y telephone. 
gg: For unscheduled visits, study a ssessments are at the investigat or’s discretion. 
  
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-[ADDRESS_875721] saf ety laboratory assessments collected at e ach bi-monthly visit.  The local 
laboratory will perform hematology and serum chemistry tests.  Laboratory panels are defined as 
listed in Table 2b.    
Abnormalities in clinical laborat ory tests that lead to a chang e in patient management (e.g. dose 
delay, requirement for additional medication or monitoring) are  considered clinically significant 
for the purposes of this study, and will be recorded on the AE electronic case report form (eCRF) 
page. If laboratory values consti tute part of an event that mee ts criteria defining it as serious, the 
event (and associated lab values) must be reported as an SAE (s ee Section 11.3 ). 
12.1.7.  Pregnancy Test 
Urine pregnancy tests are to be pe rformed for females of childb earing potential. P ositive urine 
tests are to be confir med by a serum test.  
12.1.8.  Tumor Samples 
The availability of paraffin-embe dded tumor sample diagnostic o f glioblastoma is mandatory for 
entry into the study. Samples from the original tumor  and any subsequent biopsies wil l be 
required. Tissue from recurrent surgery i s preferred, but tissue from ini tial surgery is sufficient 
for study entry.  
Twenty (20) slides cut as recently as possible and sections mus t contain adequate tumor. See the 
study laboratory manual for defi nition of adequate tumor sample .   
If the archival tissue is neither sufficient nor available , the patient may s till be eligible,  upon 
discussion with the Medical Moni tor, with the assumption that t he patient: 
 Can provide sufficient tissue; OR 
 Is willing to consent to and under go a pre-treatment biopsy of the tumor 
A detailed description of tissue  quality requirements and proce dures for collection,  handling, 
preparation and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_151592] s amples to the ce ntral laborato ry will be provided in a  separate 
laboratory manual. 
For enrolled patients, part of the  available tumor tissue from the tissue submitted will be  used to 
assess EGFRvIII mutation and for E GFR gene amplification biomar kers. Other tissue 
assessments may include testing of  protein expression, activation s tatus, somatic mutations, and 
other exploratory markers relat ed to tesevatimib and to gliobla stoma biology.  These assessments 
will be performed by [CONTACT_1034], a t a Sponsor-selected vendor.  The remaining tumor tissue 
block will be returned to the site.

 12.1.9.  12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 12-Lead ECGs will be performed at screening; predose, an d once within 4 – 8 hours 
postdose on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle  1; pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycl es 2 and beyond; and at the 
End of Study Drug Treatment vis it.  ECGs will be read by a cent ral laboratory. 
ECGs are to be performed before any blood sample collection whe n possible. 
ECGs are to be repeated three times consecutively within 30 min utes (must have an interval of at 
least 1–2 minutes between ECGs).   
During the study, all ECGs will be digitally analyzed by a vali dated central ECG laboratory 
vendor. This central vendor will pl ace ECG machines at sites un der contract with Kadmon. 
ECGs will be transmitted electronically to the central vendor f or analysis. Reports, including 
clinical alerts resulting from the analysis of the ECGs, will b e provided back to sites. Sites will 
be trained on the use of the ECG  machines, and instructions for  performing ECG assessments 
will be provided in the ECG manual. Although ECGs will be read by a central laboratory, sites 
should take action if c linically significant abnormalities are detected at time of ECG. 
Subjects who have completed [ADDRESS_875722] demonstrate an average s creening QTc(F ) value of 
≤ 470 msec by [CONTACT_589718]. Immediate clinical mana gement of patients will initially 
be based on results of machine-read  ECGs at the sites. However,  the central digital analysis will 
prevail as it becomes availabl e. In addition, th e central digit al analysis will be used for any AE 
and SAE documentation. 
An increase in QTc(F) interval  (by [CONTACT_589718]) to  a value > 60 msec above baseline 
or to the level of ≥ 500 msec requi res further monitoring. Afte r discussion with the Medical 
Monitor (if ≥ 500 msec) on appropriate management, the patient may be removed from the trial 
(see guidelines in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 ). 
Abnormalities in the ECG that lead to a change in patient manag ement (e.g., requirement for 
additional medication or monitoring ) or result i n clinical sign s and symptoms are considered 
clinically significant for the purposes of this study and will be recorded on the AE eCRF.  If 
ECG abnormalities meet criteria defining them as serious, they must be reported as SAE (see 
Section 11.3 ). 
12.1.10.  Disease and Response Assessments 
Disease assessments will be  based on the RANO criteria [ Wen 2010 ] and will  comprise 
radiological assessments (MRI), c linical assessments (KPS), and  corticosteroid use.  Based on 
radiological assessments, clini cal status, and corticosteroid u se, an overall  evaluation of CR, PR, 
SD, or  PD should be made at each disease assessment (see  Section 10 ) after baseline  according 
to the RANO criteria ( Appendix 2 ).  
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-[ADDRESS_875723] be us ed as the baseline radiologic al assessment. Per the study’s 
schedule of assessments (see Table 1 ), disease assessment is inte nded to be done prio r to starting 
cycle 2, 3, 5, 7+.  The corticoster oid dose should be kept stab le for [ADDRESS_875724] study treatment and t hen every 8 weeks thereafter (at Week 16, 24, etc.), regardless of 
treatment delays. For patients  who discontinue treatment for ot her reasons than PD, disease 
assessment in the follow-up peri od should continue  every 8 week s (according to the original 
schedule) until disease progression. For patients with PD, dise ase assessment at the EOS is only 
required if not performed with in the previous 8 weeks. 
Disease assessments as initiall y planned according to the sched ule of assessments  should be 
maintained regardless of treat ment delays. Unscheduled disease  assessments may be performed 
at the discretion of the inves tigator to allow a decision  on further study treatment administration 
for individual patients. For patients who  discontinue treatment for reas ons other than progressive 
disease, disease assessment in  the follow-up period should cont inue every 8 weeks (according to 
the original schedule)  until disease progression. 
12.1.11.  Tesevatinib Administration 
Tesevatinib will be administe red at the dose of 300 mg once dai ly. Tesevatinib will be used in 
dosage strength of 100-mg, and 150-m g tablets. Patient diaries will be utilized to evaluate 
compliance. One cycle will be defined as 28 days of treatment.   
Tesevatinib should be taken in t he morning (unless there is a p atient-specific rationale to take it 
regularly at a different time of  day) and can be administered w ithout regard to food intake. 
12.1.12.  Patient Reported Outcomes (MDASI-BT) 
PROs of disease- and treatment-re lated symptom severity and sym ptom interference will  be 
assessed using the MDASI-BT questionnaire. 
The MDASI is a validated and relia ble self-report measure that was developed to assess  
symptom severity and interference [ Cleeland 2000 ; Armstrong 2006 ]. 
Thirteen items ask patients to rat e how severe the symptoms wer e when “at their worst” in  the 
last [ADDRESS_875725] interfered 
with six areas of function (gene ral activity, walking, work, mo od, relations  with other people, 
and enjoyment of life) in the l ast 24 hours. The MDASI-BT (see Appendix 3 ) contains an 
additional nine items that assess symptoms and concerns  specific to primary brain tumor patients 
(difficulty understanding, difficulty speaking,  difficulty concentrating, seizures, weakness, 
change in appearance, change in vision,  change in bowel patterns, irr itability), for a total of 28 
items. 
All patients will complete the self-administered questionnaire pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycles 1  and 
2; every 8 weeks after enrollment (i.e., coinciding with the sc hedule of disease  assessments); and 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-208  
 
    
Kadmon Corporation 
  Page 76 of 113

Proprietary  03 Apr 2019
 at the End of Study Drug Treatment visit (EOS). Additionally, p atients who discontinue study 
treatment for  reasons other than disease progression will complete the questi onnaire every 8 
weeks  during follow-up until the time of documented disease progressi on. The questionnaire will  
take patients ~5–[ADDRESS_875726] complete  the questionnaire prior to  any 
other tests or assessments a nd prior to any discussion of the p atient’s progress with  their 
physician or any other healthcar e personnel at the site. 
Subjects who have completed 24 cy cles of treatment without dise ase progression or unacceptable 
toxicity will not be required to c omplete the MDASI-BT question naire at subsequent bi-monthly 
visits. 
12.1.13.  Tesevatinib Plasma Concentrations 
Blood samples will be drawn to evaluate tesevatinib plasma conc entrations. Plasma samples for 
tesevatinib concentration analys is will be drawn predose of tes evatinib on Days 15 of Cycle 1; 
and predose of tesevatinib on Da y 1 of every subsequent cycle ( up to cycle 6). Data from these 
samples will contribute to a popul ation PK analysis, and will b e used to explore exposure-
response relationships.    
12.1.14.  Pharmacodynamics 
The tumor tissues submitted should be a formalin-fixed, paraffi n-embedded tumor specimen that 
enables the definitive diagnosis of glioblastoma and determinat ion of EGFR status, to permit 
stratification for the purposes of the efficacy analyses.           
A tissue block (preferred) or 20 s erial, freshly cut, unstained  slides accompanied by [CONTACT_652433]. T issue quality and  adequate viable 
tumor cell content are specified in the accompanying lab manual . 
Cytological samples are not acceptable. 
For enrolled patients, part of the  available tumor tissue from the tissue submitted will be  used to 
assess exploratory biomarkers. T issue assessments may include t esting of  protein expression, 
activation status, somatic muta tions, and/or gene amplification  of EGFR, and other exploratory 
markers related to tesevatin ib and to glioblastoma biology.  These assessments will be performed 
by [CONTACT_1034], at a central laboratory, or by a  Sponsor-selected vendor. The remaining tumor 
tissue block will be r eturned to the site. 
12.1.15.  Prior and Concomitant Medications 
All concomitant medications will be recorded from the time the patient signs the informed 
consent form through [ADDRESS_875727] dose of study drug.  
12.1.16.  Adverse Event Assessments 
Information regarding the occurrence of AEs and SAEs will be co llected from the time the 
patient signs the informed cons ent form throughout their partic ipation in the study, including a 
period of 30 days after the pati ent’s last dose of study drug, unless a new treatment has been 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-[ADDRESS_875728] event that occurs beyond the AE re porting period that the 
investigator assesses as possibl y related to tesevatinib also s hould be reported to Kadmon. 
Note:    AEs resulting in a patient’s  permanent discontinuation from the study, regardless of 
seriousness or relationship to s tudy drug, MUST be promptly rep orted to the sponsor. 
12.1.17.  Study Diary 
Patients will be required t o keep a study drug diary in which t hey will record the date and time 
that each dose of tesevatinib i s taken as well as any missed do ses.  Diaries will be reviewed at 
each visit during the treatment periods. 
12.2. Schedule of Visits 
12.2.1.  Screening Visit 
At the screening visit (Day - 22 to -1), information will be col lected and patients will have 
clinical evaluations as follows: 
 Informed consent

13.1. General Design 
This is an open-label phase 2, multicenter study of tesevatinib  monotherapy in patients with 
recurrent glioblastoma.  
13.2. Sample Size Justification 
This phase 2 trial is designed prim arily to allow a preliminary  assessment of the efficacy and 
safety of tesevatinib in th e overall population of 40 patients with recurrent glioblastoma as well 
as to permit exploratory comparisons between predefined subgrou ps (by [CONTACT_652434]). The target PFS-6  rate in the overall study 
population is 25%. PFS-6 rates seen  in randomized studies with bevacizumab [ Weathers 2015; 
Taal 2014; Galanis 2015 ] are of the order of 15-18%. Bev acizumab is registered in this  
indication.  
With a sample size of 40 patient s in the overall population, PF S-6 = 25% and median PFS-6 = 
4.5 months, the trial has 95% pow er of having an estimated PFS- 6 >15%. Addressing uncertainty 
by [CONTACT_54446] 90% confidence limit of the estimated PFS-6  – corresponding to a one-sided test on 
5% significance level, the trial  has 95% power to show a signif icant difference above 7% and 
80% power to show a significan t difference above 10%. 
The power calculation is base d on simulations in the Weibull di stribution to describe the 
progression and survival times. T he median PFS and the PFS-6 an d the corresponding shape and 
scale parameters from the Wei bull distribution are shown in Table 6  below.

proportion of 
subjects 
A Patients with an assumed beneficial mutation (EGFR gene 
amplified glioblastoma) 57% 
B Patients with an assumed beneficial mutation (EGFRvIIIpos 
glioblastoma) 27% 
 
The trial is not stratified to i nclude a specific proportion of  patients with the EGFR gene 
mutations and is not powered to sho w significant differences fo r the secondary endpoints that 
estimate differences in PFS-6 for  the two subgroups compared to  patients without the EGFR 
gene mutations.  
13.3. Interim Analysis 
An interim analysis is incl uded with the possibility to stop fo r futility. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_652380]-6 rate of 5%  and a desirable PFS-6 rate of 20% or more. The trial will 
continue after the interim anal ysis if more than 1 responder is  seen in 21 patients giving a 72% 
probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_652381]-6 rate is ≤5%.  
13.4. Statistical Considerations 
For categorical variables, the number and percent of each categ ory within a parameter will be 
calculated for observed data only. F or continuous variables, th e mean, median, and standard 
deviation, as well as the minimum  and maximum values, will be p resented. The summary of 
time-to-event variables will include Kaplan-Meier methods as ap propriate.  
Statistical significan ce will be declared whe n the two-tailed p -value is found to be less than or 
equal to 0.05, unless otherwise  noted. Missing data will not be  imputed unless otherwise stated. 
All clinical data captured will  be provided in da ta listings.  
13.4.1.  Study Populations  
Adult patients with recurrent g lioblastoma with availability of  paraffin-embedded tumor samples 
diagnostic of glioblastoma will be enrolled. 
Two subgroups of patients are defined as having: EGFRvIIIpos and EGFR amplificationpos 
tumors. 
Primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include all patien ts who were included in the study. 
The same analysis methods for the primary and secondary analyse s will be applied to both the 
ITT population and the EGFRvIIIpos and EGFR gene amplificationpos population. 
Safety analyses will include a ll patients who enrolled and rece ived at least one dose of study 
treatment (the safety population). 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-[ADDRESS_875733] all available data (up 
until the time of termination related to the reason they were t erminated) included in the analysis.   
For statistical purposes compl etion of the study will be define d as six months after the last 
patient starts study treatment.  
The plasma concentration analysi s population will consist of al l patients who receive at least one 
dose of tesevatinib, and who have a t least one sample analyzed for plasma concentrations. 
13.4.2.  Patient Accountability, Demographics, and Baseline Characterist ics  
Patient disposition, demographic information and baseline chara cteristics will be tabulated for 
the overall population as well as by [CONTACT_12125]. Minimal data fo r screen failures, pertaining to 
why they failed to qualify to enroll will also be collected and  listed. 
13.4.3.  Tesevatinib Exposure  
The amount of tesevatinib administered by [CONTACT_560225] (to tal dose) will be tabulated and 
presented by [CONTACT_652435].  The distribution of the  number of cycles achieved per 
patient will also be summari zed. In addition, delays and all ot her alterations in tesevatinib 
administration will be presented.  
13.4.4.  Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the current WHO Dru g Dictionary and the data 
will be summarized and presented in tables and listings.  
13.4.5.  Plasma Concentrations 
Plasma samples for tesevatini b concentration analysis will be d rawn predose of tesevatinib on 
Day 15 of Cycle 1; and predose of  tesevatinib on Day 1 of every  subsequent cycle (up to cycle 
6). Due to the sparse number of time points data are summarized  using descriptiv e statistics by 
[CONTACT_150746], systemic steroid treatment and subgroup. 
These data, pooled with data from  other studies, may be analyze d in a population PK analysis 
using nonlinear mixed effects modeling. 
13.4.6.  Efficacy/Activity 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary efficacy endpoint 
Progression-Free Survival at 6 months (PFS-6).  
PFS is defined as the time betwee n date of first dose and the d ate of first documented disease 
progression or death, whichever o ccurs first. The PFS-6 is defi ned as a patient being alive and 
progression free at 6 months (24 w eeks). Disease progression wi ll be determined based on 
investigator assessment with use  of radiological assessments, c linical status, and corticosteroid 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-[ADDRESS_875734] disease assessment; if no post- baseline disease assessment  is available, PFS will be censored 
at the date of 1st dose. 
The analysis of the primary e ndpoint and the estimation of PFS- [ADDRESS_875735] imate PFS-6 with 2-sided 95% and  90% confidence intervals. 
Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate median PFS with 95% CI and 
the Kaplan-Meier curve will be c onstructed to provide a visual description of the  PFS over time.  
Descriptive statistics overall and for each parameter (radiolog ical assessment, clinical status and 
corticosteroid dose) in the dis ease progression assessment are presented for the entire assessment 
period as well as for 3, 6 and 9-month time points. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary efficacy endpoints 
The following subgroup PFS-6 endpoints: 
 Investigator-assessed PFS-6 in t he subgroup of patients with EG FRvIIIpos 
glioblastoma 
 Investigator-assessed PFS-[ADDRESS_875736] in the  model used to analyze the 
primary endpoint. PFS-6 with 95% confidence intervals are estim ated for each subgroup as well 
as for the residual population. 
Comparison of the efficacy betwee n the subgroups and the residu al group is performed by 
[CONTACT_652436] (HR) with 2-sided 95% and 80% confi dence intervals and the p-value 
for the null hypothesis: HR=1. 
Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate median PFS with 95% CI 
using Greenwood’s formula and the Kaplan-Meier curves will be c onstructed to provide a visual 
description of the PFS fo r the subgroups over time.  
Descriptive statistics overall and for each parameter in the di sease progression assessment are 
presented for the entire asse ssment period as well as for 3, 6 and 9-month time points by 
[CONTACT_6496]. 
The secondary endpoint: 
 OS rate at 9 months (OS-9) and O S overall, in all patients and in those with 
EGFRvIIIpos and EGFR gene amplified glioblastoma 
where OS is defined as the time between date of first dose of s tudy drug and the date of death 
due to any cause. OS-[ADDRESS_875737] known to be  alive; if no post- baseline data  are available, OS will be 
censored at the date of first s tudy drug. The analysis methods will be the same as for the PFS. 
The secondary endpoints: 
 ORR per RANO criteria, and DOR i n all patients and in those wit h EGFRvIIIpos and 
EGFR gene amplified tumors 
where ORR is defined as a CR or P R. Patients without a post-bas eline disease assessment will be 
considered as non-responders. T he analysis population for ORR w ill be all enrolled patients with 
measurable disease at baseline. A n estimate of ORR and its 95% CI will be calculated using the 
Blyth-Still-Casella method for each  treatment arm. CIs for the difference in ORRs between the 
subgroups will be determined using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. In 
addition, ORR is analyzed with a ge neralized logistic regressio n analysis. Subgroup is included 
as fixed effect, KPS as a covari ate and study center as random effect. The adjusted odds ratio for 
being a responder is estimate d and the two-sided 95% confidence  interval presented. 
DOR is defined as the time from the initial response to disease  progression or death among 
patients who have experienced a  CR or PR during study. Patients  who have not progressed or 
died at the time of analysis will be censored at the last disea se assessment date. DOR will be 
estimated using Kaplan- Meier m ethodology. Comparisons between subgroups through use of 
the unstratified log-rank test will  be made for descriptive pur poses only. 
 To evaluate the efficacy of tesevatinib as measured by [CONTACT_16625]-6, O S-9, RANO ORR and 
DOR in the subgroups: 
 EGFRvIIIpos vs EGFRvIIIneg 
 EGFR amplificationpos vs EGFR amplificationneg 
The statistics for these subgroup c omparisons are described at each of the endpoints. 
In addition, statistics for the  change and percent change from baseline tumor measurements will 
be presented. These analyses will be done after each two cycles  of therapy. Summary statistics 
will be produced for PFS and OS . The percentage of patients wit hout disease progression after 3 
and 6 months of dosing will also be presented separately by [CONTACT_603624] (investigator) and potentially 
by [CONTACT_652437]. Sites will provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_198303] l MRI image sets for central 
retention in case central radiology review is required. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Sensitivity analysis for prima ry and secondary PFS and OS endpo int analysis 
As a sensitivity analysis for the primary and secondary PFS and  OS analysis the estimation of 
PFS-X, medium PFS, OS-X and median OS is performed with paramet ric survival analysis 
models, the models are compare d to the Cox model based on the A IC-value. For each model the 
PFS-X, medium PFS, OS-X and median OS confidence intervals are estimated. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Exploratory endpoints 
The analysis of the exploratory endpoints will be further detai led in the SAP.

Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-[ADDRESS_875742] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS 
14.1.  Monitoring the Study 
All aspects of the study will  be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_652440] (SOPs) for c ompliance with applicable 
government regulations. 
It is understood that the respons ible Kadmon study monitor (or designee) will contact [CONTACT_652441] 
(eCRFs and other pertinent data)  provided that patient confiden tiality is maintained in 
accordance with local requirements. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_652382]. The invest igator (or designee) must agree to 
cooperate with the monitor to ens ure that any problems detected  during the course of these 
monitoring visits are resolved. 
All data will be entered in a va lidated electronic data capture  system using single data entry. 
Standard procedures (including f ollowing data review guidelines , manual clinical review based 
on patient profiles, computerize d validation to produce queries , and maintenance of an audit file 
which includes all database modi fications) will be followed to ensure accurate data. Clinical 
personnel will review all data l istings for outliers, data inco nsistencies, and spelling errors. 
During the course of the study, a s tudy monitor (CRA) will make  site visits to review protocol 
compliance, compare eCRFs against individual patient’s medical records, assess drug 
accountability, and ensure that t he study is being conducted ac cording to pertinent regulatory 
requirements. In the course of the clinical study, access will be available to K admon or designee 
(e.g., CRO) to view the eCRFs after completion of the individua l sections of the study. 
Electronic CRF entries will be verified with source documentati on. The review of medical 
records will be performed in a man ner to ensure that patient co nfidentiality is maintained.  
Checking the eCRFs for completeness, clarity and cross checking  with source documents is 
required to monitor the progress of the study. 
The monitor will visit the site s at regular intervals throughou t the study according to the 
monitoring plan, to verify the adhe rence to the protocol and th e completeness, consistency, and 
accuracy of the data being entered on them and clarifying any d ata queries. The monitor should 
have access to laboratory test reports and other patient record s needed to verify the entries on the 
eCRF. The completed and correct ed eCRFs/CRFs for completed visi ts will either be collected by 
[CONTACT_652442]. The 
investigator is responsible fo r the timely completion of eCRFs by [CONTACT_210164]. The 
eCRFs should be completed within s even (7) days of the patient’ s visit. A copy of the eCRFs 
will be retained by [CONTACT_652443] a secure  place with other 
study documents, such as the protoc ol, the Investigator’s Broch ure, and any protocol 
amendments. 
Upon completion of the study, the monitor will make a final ass essment of the conduct of the 
study and inventory all clinical s upplies to be returned to Kad mon.

 14.2. Audits and Inspections 
The investigator should understa nd that source documents for th is study should be made 
available to appropriately qualif ied personnel from the Kadmon Quality Assurance Unit (or 
designee), or to health authority i nspectors after appropriate notification.  
Direct access to source data is also required for inspections a nd audits, and will be carried out 
giving due consideration to data p rotection and medical confide ntiality. Each investigator will 
have assured Kadmon of full access to complete source data for study participants and associated 
necessary support at all times. 
In addition to routine monitoring pr ocedures, audits of clinica l research activities in accordance 
with SOPs may be performed to eva luate compliance with the prot ocol, the principles of GCP 
and any applicable regulatory re quirements.  A regulatory autho rity or IRB may also wish to 
conduct an inspection (during the  study or even after its compl etion).  If a regul atory authority or 
IRB requests an inspection, the i nvestigator must immediately i nform Kadmon that this request 
has been made. 
Study conduct may be assessed during the course of the study by  a Clinical Quality Assurance 
representative(s) to ensure th at the study is conducted in comp liance with the protocol.  This 
designee, as well as the CRA, will be permitted to inspect the study documents (study protocol, 
eCRFs, investigational product accountability, original study-r elevant medical records).   
All patient data will be treat ed confidentially.  Furthermore, the study protocol, each step of the 
data-recording procedure and the  handling of the data as well a s the study report may be patient 
to independent review by a Quality Assurance representative.  C linical site and st udy audits will 
be conducted as necessary to assure the validity of the study d ata. 
Initial IRB approval, and all ma terials approved by [CONTACT_652444] e Investigator and made 
available for inspection.

 15. ETHICAL ASPECTS 
15.1. Compliance Statement 
This study will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical P ractice (GCP), including 
International Conference on Harm onization (ICH) Guidelines, and  in general, consistent with the 
most recent version of the Declar ation of Helsinki. The investi gator will ensure that the conduct 
of the study complies with the ba sic principles of GCP as outli ned in the current version of 
21 CFR, subpart D, Part 312, “Res ponsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators”, Part 50, 
“Protection of Human Patients” , and Part 56, “Institutional Rev iew Boards”. In addition, the 
investigator agrees to adhere to  the protocol and to all applic able local laws and regulatory 
requirements relevant to the us e of new therapeutic agents in t he countries involved. 
The appropriate Institutional Re view Boards (IRBs) must approve  the protocol and any 
amendments and the patient informed consent form (ICF) prior to  implementation.  
Voluntary written informed cons ent must be obtained from every patient prior to participation in 
this clinical study. The rights , safety, and well-being of part icipating patients are the most 
important considerations and shoul d prevail over interests of s cience and society. 
Study personnel involved in conducting this study will be quali fied by [CONTACT_8640], training, and 
experience to perform their resp ective task(s). This study will  not use the services of study 
personnel where sanctions have been invoked based upon scientif ic misconduct or fraud (e.g., 
loss of medical licensure, debarment). 
15.2. Good Clinical Practice 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_652383] s of Good Clinical Practice, as 
outlined in 21 CFR 312, subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsor s and Investigat ors,” 21 CFR, 
part 50 (1998) and 21 CFR, part 56, (1998) are followed. Since this is a covered clinical trial, the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12321] 21 CFR, part 54, (1998). A  covered clinical trial is any “study 
of a drug or device in humans sub mitted in a marketing applicat ion or reclassification petition 
patient to this part that the applicant or FDA relies on to est ablish that the product is effective 
(including studies that show equi valence to an effective produc t) or that make a significant 
contribution to the demonstration of safety.”  This requires th at investigators and all sub-
investigators must provide docum entation of their financial int erest or arrangements with 
Kadmon or proprietary interests  in the drug being studied. This  documentation must be provided 
prior to the participation of t he principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_47214] y sub-investigator. The principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9814]-investigat or agree to notify Kadmon of any  change in reportable interests 
during the study and for one year f ollowing completion of the s tudy. Study completion is defined 
as the date that the last patie nt has completed the protocol-de fined activities. 
15.3. Informed Consent 
A properly executed, written info rmed consent document, in comp liance with 21 CFR, Part 50 
and the International Conferen ce on Harmonization (ICH) guideli nes, will be obtained from each 
patient before the patient is en tered into the study and before  any study screening procedure is

 performed that involves risk.  Attention will be directed to th e basic elements required for 
incorporation into the informed c onsent under US Federal Regula tions for Protection of Human 
Patients (21 CFR 50.25[a]) and ( 21 CFR 50.25[b]), as necessary.   Sample ICFs will be supplied 
to each site. Kadmon or its desi gnee must review any proposed d eviations from the sample ICF. 
The final IRB-approved document must be provided to Kadmon for regulatory purposes. 
It is the responsibil ity of the investigat or, or a person desig nated by [CONTACT_31691], to obtain 
written informed consent from each patient (or the patient’s le gally authorized representative) 
participating in this study aft er adequate explanation of the a ims, methods, anticipated benefits, 
and potential hazards of the study. In the case where the patie nt is unable to read, an impartial 
witness should be present during the entire informed consent di scussion. After the patient has 
orally consented to participation i n the trial, the witness’ si gnature on the form will attest that the 
information in the consent form was accurately explained and un derstood. A copy of the ICF 
must be provided to the patient or  to the patient’s legally aut horized representative. If applicable, 
it will be provided in a certifie d translation of the local lan guage.  The site will retain the original 
signed/dated consent form and a ny associated HIPAA authorizatio n for all consented patient 
candidates. 
The eCRF for this study contains  a section for documenting info rmed patient consent, and this 
must be completed appropriatel y. Signed ICFs must remain in eac h patient’s study file and must 
be available for verification by s tudy monitors at any time. If  new safety information results in 
significant changes in the risk/ benefit assessment, the consent  form should be reviewed and 
updated as necessary. All patients (including those already bei ng treated) should be informed of 
the new information, should be given a copy of the revised form , and should give their written 
consent to continue in the study. 
15.4. Institutional Review Board 
This study is being conducted in co mpliance with the protocol, the ICH GCP Guidelines, and the 
applicable regulatory requireme nts under a [LOCATION_002] IND ap plication. This protocol (and 
any modifications) and appropriate  consent procedures must be r eviewed and approved by [CONTACT_113834]. This board must operate in a ccordance with the current fed eral or local regulations. The 
investigator will send a letter or certificate of IRB approval to Kadmon (or designee) before 
patient enrollment and whenever subsequent modifications to the  protocol are made. 
15.5. Future Use of Patient Samples 
Not all of the tissue and bl ood components obtained during this  study may be required for the 
tests that are part of the clin ical trial. Following the conclu sion of the study, the samples may be 
used for additional research. These samples will be held for a maximum of [ADDRESS_875743] patient response to 
treatment. The use of the samples  for internal research will be  done according to the guidelines

 defined by [CONTACT_652445] (issued 25 April  25 2006) and the EMEA 
Reflection Paper on Pharmacogenetic Samples, Testing and Data H andling 
(EMEA/CHMP/PGxWP/201914/2006).  If a patient requests destructi on of their tissue and blood 
samples and the samples have not  yet been de-identified, Kadmon  will destroy the samples as 
described in this FDA guidance. Kadmon will notify the investig ator in writing that the samples 
have been destroyed. 
 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-[ADDRESS_875744] to study patients, or when the change involves  only logistical or administrative 
aspects of the trial (e.g., cha nge in monitor, change of teleph one number) or to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study patients. In these circumstances, imm ediate approval of the chairman 
of the IRB must be sought, and the  investigator should inform K admon, and the full IRB within 
[ADDRESS_875745] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] 
17.1. Investigator’s Files and  Retention of Documents 
The investigator must maintain a dequate and accur ate records to  enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the st udy data to be subsequently ve rified. These documents should 
be classified into two separate categories as follows: (1) inve stigator’s study file  and (2) patient 
clinical source documents. 
The investigator’s study file will contain the protocol and pro tocol amendments, eCRFs, query 
forms, IRB and governmental approva l with correspondence, sampl e informed consent, drug 
records, staff curriculum v itae and authorization forms, and ot her appropriate documents and 
correspondence. 
Patient clinical source document s (usually predefined by [CONTACT_652446]) may include patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records, 
physician’s and nurse’s notes, a ppointment book, original labor atory reports, ECG, X-ray, 
pathology and special assessment reports, signed ICFs, consulta nt letters, email communication 
and patient screening and enrollm ent logs. The investigator mus t keep these two categories of 
documents on file for at least  [ADDRESS_875746] from the  eCRFs. 
These records include detailed notes on: 
 Medical history 
 Date and time of informed consent with HIPAA authorization eith er contained in the 
ICF or presented to the patient candidate as a standalone docum ent 
 Description of the complete consenting process 
 The basic identifying informati on that linked the patient’s med ical record with the 
eCRFs

  The results of all diagnostic t ests performed, diagnoses made, therapy provided, and 
any other data on the condition of the patient 
 The medical condition of the pati ent during their involvement i n the study 
 All AEs 
 The patient’s exposure to the study medication 
 The patient’s exposure to any concomitant therapy 
 All relevant observations a nd data on the condition of the pati ent throughout the trial 
 Justification for all entries in the patient’s eCRF 
 Radiology images (hard copy and dig ital), and reports if requir ed 
 Death information and any available autopsy data 
A patient log of all potentially e ligible patients considered, but not consented, for obvious 
deviations from the entry criter ia, will be kept at each site. The log will contain patients’ initials, 
diagnosis, eligibility, or, if  not eligible, reason for not con senting.  All consented patients will be 
logged, regardless of wheth er they ultimately enroll.  
Upon request, the investigator w ill supply Kadmon with any requ ired background data from the 
study documentation or clinic recor ds. In case of special probl ems or governmental queries or 
requests for audit inspections , it is also necessary to have ac cess to the complete study records, 
provided that patient confidentiality is protected. 
17.3. Electronic Case Report Forms 
Clinical trial data for this st udy will be captured on electron ic case report forms (eCRF) designed 
for computer processing and analy sis. This computerized system will be validated and compliant 
with 21 CFR Part 11. Corrections t o data will be made according  to 21 CFR Part 11, Electronic 
Records; Electronic Signatures. T here will also be an electroni c audit trail. The investigator 
agrees to provide all informati on requested on the eCRF in an a ccurate manner according to 
instructions provided. The inve stigator should ensure the accur acy, completeness, and timeliness 
of the data reported to Kadm on in the eCRF and in all required reports. 
An eCRF is required to be submitte d for every patient who recei ves any amount of study drug.  
This includes submission of ret rievable data on patients who wi thdraw before completion of the 
study.  Prior to submission, eCRFs mu st be reviewed for complet eness and accuracy, and signed 
and dated where indicated by [CONTACT_652447].  If a patient stops treat ment or terminates from the stu dy, the dates and reasons must be 
noted on the eCRF. 
17.4. Confidentiality of Trial Docu ments and Patient Records 
The investigator must ensure that patients’ anonymity will be m aintained and that their identities 
are protected from unauthorize d parties. On eCRFs or other docu ments submitted to Kadmon

 and the IRB, patients should be i dentified by [CONTACT_652448]/or initials and not by 
[CONTACT_2249]. The investigator s hould keep a patient enrollment log showing codes, names, and 
addresses. The investigator s hould maintain documents not for s ubmission to Kadmon 
(e.g. patients’ written consent f orms) in strict confidence. 
Authorized regulatory official s and Kadmon personnel (or their representatives) will be allowed 
full access to inspect and copy the records.  All study drug, p atient bodily fluids and tissue, 
and/or other materials collect ed shall be used solely in accord ance with this protocol, unless 
otherwise agreed to in writing by [CONTACT_486519]. 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_652384] o agrees that all information rec eived from Kadmon, including but 
not limited to the Investigator’s B rochure, this protocol, eCRF s, the investigational new drug, 
and any other study information rem ain the sole and exclusive p roperty of Kadmon during the 
conduct of the study and thereaf ter.  This information is not t o be disclosed to any third party 
(except employees or agents di rectly involved in the conduct of  the study or as required by [CONTACT_2371]) 
without prior written c onsent from the Sponsor. The principal i nvestigator further agrees to take 
all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by [CONTACT_652449]. 
 
Tesevatinib  Protocol Number KD019-[ADDRESS_875747] igator or other representativ es of study site as a named author

 APPENDIX 2.  RANO CRITERIA 
Response Criteria 
Complete 
response 
(CR) Requires all of the following: 
 Complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and nonmeasu rable disease 
sustained for at least 4 weeks 
 No new lesions 
 Stable or improved non-enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions 
 Patients must be off corticosteroids (or on physiological repla cement doses only) 
 Clinical status is stable or improved 
Partial 
response (PR) Requires all of the following: 
 ≥ 50% decrease compared with baseline in the sum of products of  perpendicular 
diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks 
 No progression of nonmeasurable T1enhancing disease 
 No new lesions 
 Stable or improved non-enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on the same  or lower dose of 
corticosteroids compared to baseline 
 Clinical status is stable or improved 
Note: Patients with nonmeasurable disease only cannot have a pa rtial response; the best response 
possible is stable disease 
Stable 
disease (SD) Requires all of the following: 
 Patient does not qualify for complete response, partial respons e, or progression 
 Stable non-enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose o f corticosteroids 
compared to baseline 
 Clinical status is stable or improved 
Note: In the event that the corticosteroid dose was increased f or new symptoms and signs without 
confirmation of disease progression on neuroimaging, and subseq uent follow-up imaging shows 
that this increase in corticoste roids was requir ed because of d isease progression, the last scan 
considered to show stable disease will be the scan obtained whe n the corticosteroid dose was 
equivalent to the baseline dose. 
Progression 
(PD) Defined by [CONTACT_39132]: 
 ≥25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters  of enhancing lesions 
compared with the smallest tumor measurement obtained either at  baseline (of no 
decrease) or best response, on a stable or increasing dose of c orticosteroids 
 Significant increase in T2/FLAIR non-enhancing lesions on stabl e or increasing doses of 
steroids compared with baseline scan or best response after ini tiation of therapy, not caused 
by [CONTACT_186754] (e.g., radiation therapy, demyelination, isc hemic injury, seizures, 
postoperative changes, or other treatment effects) 
 Presence of any new lesions 
 Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes a part from the tumor 
(e.g., seizures, medication advers e effects, complications of t herapy, cerebrovascular 
events, infection, and so on) or decreases in corticosteroid do se 
 Failure to return for evaluatio n due to death or  deteriorating condition 
 Clear progression of nonmeasurable disease

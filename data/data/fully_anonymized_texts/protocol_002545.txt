BACKGROUND/ 
RATIONALE  Zilretta is approved for intra -articular injection into the knee 
joint for treatment of osteoarthritis (1). There are ongoing 
studies for intra -articular injection into the other large joints 
including the shoulder and hip joints (2). To our knowledge, 
there has been no prior study to prove efficacy of injection of 
the extended release steroid into the bursa. The bursae 
surrounding the hip joint including the iliopsoas and the greater 
trochanteric bursa are some of the larger bursae in the body.  
Conventiona l treatment for inflammation of these bursae is 
injection of corticosteroids (3). We believe that a long acting 
corticosteroid, if efficacious, can have a great impact. There is 
a significant population of patients suffering from chronic bursal 
pain, who m ight benefit. At our institute, bursal injection of the 
steroid in the region of hips is one of the most common 
locations, second to joint injections. To our understanding, the 
bursa surrounding the hip are deep enough to avoid side 
effects associated with  subcutaneous injection of steroid.  The 
current proposal is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
STUDY DESIGN  This is a prospective, open -label, pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], to assess the 
safety and efficacy of FX006 (triamcinolone acetonide 
extended release injectable suspension 32 mg) , 
administered to patients with greater trochanteric bursitis.  
PRIMARY 
OBJECTIVE  The primary objective will be to determine the safety and  
efficacy of this drug in bursal injections by [CONTACT_442460], as established using 
the using a Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score at the 
end of 12 weeks.  
SECONDARY 
OBJECTIVES  Secondary objective is to determine any alteration in the  
Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) measure. This 
is used as an indicator to assess the patient’s impression to 
change in treatments, to their chronic pain.  
PRIMARY END POINT  The primary endpoint will be the improvement in the pain 
from baseline, at the end of week 12, as determined by [CONTACT_442461], at the end of week 12.

STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis 
Plan  We plan to enroll 24 patients for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. This sample  
size is determin ed by [CONTACT_442463] (6 months).  
Descriptive statistics will be reported for demographics and all 
clinical variables collected in this study.  
For the efficacy evaluated by [CONTACT_442464], we will use 
appropriate summary statistics (e.g. mean + standard deviation 
for variables with normal distribution or median and interquartile 
range for variables with skewed distribution) to report NPRS 
and PGIC at each time point and analyze their changes ov er 
time.  
For safety evaluated, we will report the frequency and 
percentage of patients who have received any treatment to 
emergent adverse events within 12 weeks.

of age or older  with symptomatic  greater  trochanter ic bursitis.  Each  patient  will be screened  for eligibility 
with an ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis of bursitis, in the absence of prior MRI imaging done in the 
preceding three months. Based on the inclusion/exclusion requirements, they will be offered 
participation in the study to receive an intra -bursal injection of 32 mg FX006. Eligible and participating 
patients will receive treatment under ultrasound image guidance to the greater trochanteric bursa. 
Patients will be followed up by [CONTACT_1555] 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks and mean NPRS pain scores and 
PGIC scores will be recorded. Adverse events, if any, will be reported immediately to the primary 
physician and any subsequent follow -up will be reported. The study will be completed in week 12 and

up telephone call.  
 
8.1.7  Adverse  Events  
Information regarding occurrence  of adverse events will be captured throughout the study. Duration 
(start and stop dates and times), severity/grade, outcome, treatment and relation to the study drug will 
be recorded on the case report form (CRF).  
 
[ADDRESS_562137] the information in the source 
documents. Adverse events will be recorded in the pat ient CRF. Adverse events will be described by 
[CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), outcome, and treatment. The Investigator, or other medical 
trained personnel will also assess the seriousness and severity of the event, and relationship of the 
event to study drug according to the definitions below. If unrelated to study drug, the more likely cause 
of the event will also be assessed and recorded.  
9.2 Definitions  
 
Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a patient 
administered  a pharmaceutical  product  and that does  not necessarily  have  a causal  relationship  with the 
treatment. An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding),  symptom  or disease  temporally  associated  with the administration  of an investigational  product, 
whether  or not related  to that investigational  product.  An unexpected  AE is one 
of a type not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current Investigator’s Brochure or of 
greater severity or frequency than expected based on the information in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An SAE is any untoward  medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death,  
• Is life -threatening, (“Life -threatening” refers to an event in which the patient was  at 
substantial risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might hav e caused death if it were more  severe.)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909],  
• Note:  Adverse  events  requiring  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_442454] 24 hours  in duration 
generally do not meet this criterion. A schedule d hospi[INVESTIGATOR_442455] a pre -existing condition that has not worsened during participation in  the 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-18-0672 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 02/12/2021  15  
 study does not meet this criterion.  
• Results  in permanent  or significant  disability/incapacity;  a substantial  disruption  of the 
patient’s ability to carry out normal life  functions.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
• Is an important  medical  event:  event  that may not be immediately  life-threatening  or result  in 
death  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_442456].  
 
Severity: the intensity of the adverse event. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on 
patient/event  outcome  or action  criteria  usually  associated  with events  that pose  a threat  to a patient’s 
life or functioning.  The severity  of AEs will be assessed  according  to the following  definitions:  
Table 1: AE Severity Grading  
 
Severity  Description  
Mild The AE is noticeable to the patient and/or the Investigator, 
but does not interfere with routine activity.  
Moderate  The AE interferes with routine activity, but responds 
to symptomatic therapy or rest.  
Severe  The AE significantly limits the patient’s ability to 
perform routine activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_442457]: A medically -qualified Investigator must assess the relationship of any AE 
(including SAEs) to the use of the investigational product, as related or not related, based on clinical 
judgment and using all available information. Possible causes of the AE shoul d be considered, 
including the disease under treatment, pre -existing conditions, concomitant use of other drugs, and 
presence of environmental or genetic factors, the temporal association between drug exposure and 
onset of the AE, and whether the manifesta tions of the AE are consistent with known actions or 
toxicity of the investigational product. The causal relationship between the study medication and the 
AE will be assessed using one of the following categories:  
 
Causal 
relationship  Description  
Not Related  An AE is not associated with study medication if:  
 
o Temporal relationship is lacking (e.g., the event did not occur 
within a reasonable time frame following administration of the 
study medication);  or 
o Other causative factors more likely explain the event (e.g., 
a pre -existing condition, other concomitant  treatments).

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 02/12/[ADDRESS_562138] be recorded on the source document and requires expeditious handling 
to comply with regulatory requirements.  
• Reporting to IRB : In accordance with the standard  operating procedures and policies of  the 
local Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), the site 
investigator will report SAEs to the IRB as soon as possible but not later than [ADDRESS_562139] knowledge by  [CONTACT_1697].  
• Repo rting to Flexion:  All serious adverse events in patients treated with Zilretta must be 
reported  to Flexion  within  [ADDRESS_562140] be assessed for 
whether it is expected per the Investigators Brochure. An unexpected event means that it is not 
described within the reference safety information (the Zilretta IB) as associated with Zilretta.  
If an event is assessed as serious, related to Zilretta, and unexpected, it must be reported to the FDA 
according to 21CFR312.32.

evaluated by [CONTACT_308449]/or other medically qualified personnel. The Investigator must 
continue to follow the pregnancy until the completion of the pregnancy, including the outcome and 
the condition of the newborn (if applicable). Additional subsequent follow -up is no t needed when a 
newborn baby [CONTACT_442473]. Information on the pregnancy, including follow up reports, and any data on 
the birth of the newborn should be reported to Flexion within [ADDRESS_562142]’s best interest to continue. The following is 
a list of possible reasons for study  treatment discontinuation:  
Subject withdrawal of consent (or assent) 
Subject is not compliant with study procedures  
Adverse event that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_442458]:  
 
o There is a positive temporal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred wit hin a reasonable time frame 
following administration of study medication);  and 
o The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_442474] (i.e., the AE shows a pattern consistent 
with previous knowledge of the investigational product or the 
class of the investigational  product).  Related

Descriptive statistics will be reported for demographics and all clinical variables collected in this study.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-18-0672 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 02/12/2021  18  
 For the efficacy evaluated by [CONTACT_442464], we will use appropriate summary statistics (e.g. mean  
+ standard deviation for variables with normal distribution or median and interquartile range for 
variables with skewed distribution) to report NPRS and PGIC  at each time point and analyze their 
changes over time. For safety evaluated, we will report the frequency and percentage of patients who 
have received any treatment to emergent adverse events within [ADDRESS_562146] one dose of the study drug 
(the Safety Population) will be included in the safety analysis.  
12.2 Demographic and Baseline  Characteristics

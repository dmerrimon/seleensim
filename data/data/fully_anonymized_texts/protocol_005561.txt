2.1. Overview of disease pathogenesis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_384391] 1.8 m
illion new colorectal cancer (CRC) cases and 881,[ADDRESS_480984] common cancer in terms of incide nce but second in terms of mortality . There is a wide 
geographical variation in incidence across the world; incidence rates vary with [ADDRESS_480985] rates are found in Europe ( e.g., in Hungary, Slovenia, 
Slovakia, the Netherlands, and Norway), in Australia/New Zealand , Northern America, and 
Eastern Asia (Japan and the Republic of Korea, Singapore [in females])  (Globocan, 2018) . 
Approximately 25% of patients present with metastases at initial diagn osis a nd almost 50% of 
patients with CRC will develop metastases, contributing to the high mortality rates reported for 
CRC ( Ayez, 2011) (Van Cutsem, 2010) .  
The overall prognosis of patients with m etastatic CRC  (mCRC)  has improved significantly in 
the past decades , and the average survival is 30 months nowadays (Formica, 2015). Although 
some p
atients with m CRC can be cured through surgical and ablative techniques, the disease 
remains incurable in most cases  and t here is clearly a need for new therapeutic approaches.  
In patients with unresectable disease, chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. Various 
combinat
ions of the drugs may be used for the treatment of these patients at some point during 
the duration of their disease  (Van Cutsem, 2 014) (NCCN, 2019) . The choice of chemotherapy 
is ba
sed upon the consideration of the goals of therapy, the type and timing of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
and the differing toxicity profiles of the constituent drugs. Historically, a combined regimen containing a fluoropyrimidine formed the backbone of chemotherapy for decades . However, 
the introduction of monoclonal antibodies targeting VEGF receptor  and the use  of EGFR  
inhibitors for a subset of mCRC  patients  with RAS  wild-type tumours, have shown  to 
improve clinical  outcomes when  combined  with chemotherapy ( Baldus, 2010).  
An increasing number of patients with mCRC can  receive 3
  or more lines of therapy ( Bekaii -
Saab, 2018)
. Treatments in this setting include regorafenib (a multitargeted tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor
), trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965], antibodies that target EGFR for patients with RAS wild -type 
tumours (if no prior exposure), and, where approved, anti -programmed cell death protein 1 
inhibitors for patients with microsatellite instability -high mCRC ( Van Cutsem, 2014) ( NCCN, 
2019) . Clinical trials of emerging agents, new treatment combinations, and novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_384392]
l needed to continue the efforts to improve outcomes for patients with 
mCRC. VanCutsem2014a

n the Investigator’s Brochure. 
2.2.1. Mechanism of action of trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384395]/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965], also known as S [ZIP_CODE]  or TAS-102 is a  combination of an anti -neoplastic 
thymidine -based nucleoside analogue, trifluridine (FTD), and the thymidine phosphorylase 
inhibitor, tipi[INVESTIGATOR_13071] (TPI), at a molar ratio 1:0.5, formulated as two dosage strengths of 15 mg/6.14 mg and  20 mg/8.19 mg immediate release film coated tablets.  
Following uptake into cancer cells, FTD is phosphorylated by [CONTACT_19098], further 
metabol
ized in cells to a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) substrate, and incorporated directly into 
Trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384363]. CL3- [ZIP_CODE]- 007 – Final version  
© I.R.I.S  / TOI – 30 Dec 2020  - Confidential   23/1 13 DNA, thereby [CONTACT_384508]. When orally 
administered, FTD is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_384396] (TP). 
Co-administration of TPI, an inhibitor of TP, with FTD prevents the rapid degradation of FTD, 
resulting in a significant increase in systemic exposure to FTD.  
The antitumo ur e ffect was highly correlated with the amount of FTD incorporation into tumour 
DNA, and FTD was preferentially incorporated into DNA of tumour tissues as compared to that of normal tissues. FTD was markedly incorporated into DNA compared with 
fluoropyrimidines and other nucleoside analogues. Divided daily dosing enhanced the amounts 
of FTD incorporation into DNA and its antitumour effect.  
This mechanism of action of trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384397], which are uracil -based, and for which the primary mode of action is 
thymidylate synthase inhibition. In nonclinical studies, trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384398] 5- FU sensitive and resistant colorectal cancer cell lines.  
2.2.2. Clinical data  of t rifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384383]  (RECOURSE  study ) 
Trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384399] d as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with 
advanced mCRC based on the results from RECOURSE study.  
In this phase II I, multinational, randomi sed, double -blind study (Mayer, 2015) , the efficacy and 
safety
 of trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965] (35 mg/m² twice daily [BID] on days 1–5 and 8–12 every 28 days ) 
plus best supportive care (BSC) was compared to placebo plus BSC in patients with 
histologically confirmed mCRC, who had received prior treatment fluoropyrimidine -, 
oxaliplatin - and irinotecan -based chemotherapy, an anti -VEGF biological therapy, and an a nti-
EGFR therapy when appropriate. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the supportive secondary endpoint was progression- free survival (PFS).  
A total of 800 patients were randomi sed (2:
 1) to receive trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965] (n=534) or placebo 
(n=266). Patients were stratified by [CONTACT_384509] (wild -type, mutant); time since diagnosis of 
first metastasis (<18  months, ≥18 months); and geographic region (Japan , Western [United 
States, European Union and Australia]). The median OS (mOS) was 7.1 m
 onths for the trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384400] 5.[ADDRESS_480986] ratio (HR) of 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58, 0.81; p<0.0001). Results for PFS supported the OS results with a statistically significant improvement for trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384401] (HR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.57, 
p<0.0001); median PFS (mPFS) was 2.0 months for the trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384400] 1.7 
months for the placebo group. In general, results for OS consistently favoured trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384402] -specified subgroups including age (<65 vs ≥65 years) and Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs 1). Among all randomi sed 
patients, 60.6% had received a fluoropy rimidine -containing regimen as their last regimen prior 
to randomisation, and 93.8% of those patients were refractory to fluoropyrimidine. Among these refractory patients, risk reduction in OS with trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384403] (HR=0.75). Among the population evaluable for tumour response (502, trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965]; 258, placebo) there w
as no difference between the treatment groups with respect to overall response rate 
(ORR) (8  patients with partial response in the trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384404]; 1 patient with

trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384405] (27.7%, 95% CI: [21.5, 34.0]; p<0.0001). In addition, a statistically significant 34% risk reduction in worsening ECOG performance stat
us (time to ECOG performance status ≥2) was observed for trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384406], suggesting that quality of life  (QoL)  was maintained while on  trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384407].  
The most common adverse events (AE) associated with trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384408].  Among the 533 patients who received 
trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965], 38% had neutropenia of gra de ≥3, 4% had febrile neutropenia and 18% 
experienced anaemia of grade ≥ 3. These events were generally manageable with reductions in 
dose, delays in cycle initiation and occasional use of granulocyte colony -stimulating factor 
(G-CSF). Only 3 patients discontinued treatment due to hematologic AEs, and there was one 
treatment -related death due to neutropenia -related infection. Events of nausea, decreased 
appetite, diarrhoea and vomiting related to treatment were common in the trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384409] (20.1% to 39.4%); however, these AEs were rarely grade 3 or 4. The incidence of 
stomatitis among patients receiving trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384410] 7.9%; grade 3  or 4 events of 
stomatitis were rare (0.4%). In addition, hand- foot syndrome was reported in only 2.3% o f 
patients receiving trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965] (all grade 1 or 2), which was the same percentage 
reported in the placebo arm. 
As of the cut -off dat e, the average number of weeks of exposure was 12.7 weeks in 
trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384411] 6.8 weeks in placebo group (median of 6.7 weeks and 5.7 weeks, 
respectively). In the trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384404], 53 (9.9%) patients had a single dose reduction, 
18 (3.4%) patients had 2 reductions, and 2 (0.4%) patients had 3 reductions (up to 3 dose reductions allowed per protocol).

The C -TASK FORCE is an Inve stigator Initiated phase  I/II study of trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384418] c onducted in 
Japanese patients (Kuboki, 2017) . 
Twenty -five patients were enrol led fr om February to July 2014 (phase  I-part, n=6; phase  II-
part, n=19). The recommended phase  II dose was determined to be trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384419]/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384363]. CL3- [ZIP_CODE]- 007 – Final version

days 1 and 15, every 4 weeks.  
The centrally assessed PFS rate at 16 weeks in 21 patients in the primary analysis was 42.9% 
(80% C
I: 27.8, 59.0%). The m PFS centrally assessed in the 21 patients was: 3.7 months (95%  
CI: 2.0, 5.4). For all 25 patients enrol led, the investigator -assessed PFS a t 16 weeks was 60% 
(95% CI : 39, 79) and m PFS by [CONTACT_168864] 5.6 months (95% C I: 3.4, 7.6). The 
mOS (at final cut -off date for analysis) was 11.4 months (95% CI: 7.6, 13.9). 
The most common grade ≥3 AEs above 10% were neutropenia 18 (72%), leukopenia 11 (44%), 
anemia 4  
(16%), febrile neutropenia 4 (16%) and thrombocytopenia 3 (12%). Twenty -two 
patients (88%) required a treatment delay, 6 patients (24%) required at least one dose reduction (primarily due to neutropenia), and there were no treatment -related deaths. In addition, the 
incidence of hand -foot syndrome among patients treated with trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965] (2.3%) is 
lower than that commonly observed with fluoropyrimidines including capecit abine.

 , the Danish trial  
The Danish trial is an Investigator Initiated, open- labe l, randomised, phase II study of 
trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384420]  (Pfeiffer, 2020 ). Patients  were enrol led an d randomly assigned 
(1:1) to receive trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965] (35 mg/m² BID  on days 1–5 and 8–12 every 28 days) alone 
or combined with bevacizumab (5 mg/kg on days 1 and 15) until progression, unaccepta ble 
toxicity, or patient decision to withdraw. Randomisation was stratified by [CONTACT_384510]. The primary endpoint was investigator- evaluated PFS .  
From Aug ust 2017 to O

 plan  
This
 is an international, open- label , controlled two -arm, randomised phase  III study evaluating 
the efficacy and safety of  trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384436]/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384435] . 
The analysis will be done after 331 events  are reported.  In order to observe this number of 
events, 490 patients will be randomised (1:1) to receive trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384437] (experimental arm) or trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384415] (control arm). 
Considering the anticipated rapid enrolment and event accumulation in this population, there is 
no planned i
nterim analysis for efficacy or futility. 
Randomis ation will tak e pl ace once the consented patient has completed all the necessary 
baseline procedures and is deemed eligible for study entry. The stratification factors will be : 
­ geographic region (North America, European Union, Rest of the World),  
­ time since diagnosis of first metastasis (<18 months, ≥18 months) ,  
­ RAS status (wild -type, mutant).

The study will be divided into the following periods for each patient : 
­ Screening visit (up to 28 days prior to randomisation): to obtain informed consent.  
­ Screening period/Inclusion:  to che ck the eligibility of the patient to be included and 
randomised in the study. 
­ Randomisation:  pati ents will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms : 
Trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384384] : trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965] ( starting dose
at 35 mg/m2/dose) will be administered orally BID for 5 days on/[ADDRESS_480991], with bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) administered IV every 2 weeks
(day 1 and day  15).
This treatment cycle will be repeated every 4 weeks.
Trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965]: trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965] (starting dose at 35 mg/m2/dose) will be
administered orally BID for 5 days on/[ADDRESS_480992].
This treatment cycle will be repeated every 4 weeks .
­ Treatment period:  rand omised patients should receive the first dose of study treatment s 
(day 1 of c ycle 1) within  3 days after randomisation.  
Patients will be treated until they meet a discontinuation criterion as described in Section  
5.6.1. Patie nts will be  considered on treatment as long as the patient s continue with 
trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965]. Bevacizumab monotherapy is not allowed. 
­ Withdrawal visit:  wi thin 4 weeks following the date of IMPs  withdrawal and prior to  the 
start of a new anticancer therapy.  
­ Follow- up peri od: after the withdrawal visit, a  follow-up will be done every [ADDRESS_480993] patient  (including a contact [CONTACT_648] ) or 
the date of the last contact [CONTACT_192661] -up.  
If some patient s are still receiving study treatments when  the end of study is met, please see 
Section  6.5 for procedures to be followed. 
Due to the exceptional circumstances in relation to the coronavirus disease pandemic, the 
sponsor, i
n accordance with competent regulatory authority’s guidelines, could decide  to 
implement precautionary measures during the study to ensure patients safety, while maintaining compliance with GCP and study data integrity. These precautionary measures will remain in effect only for the duration of national public health emergency.

2. IWRS : to obtain patient's number at screening, randomisation of patient, allocation and re -allocation of therapeutic units (other visits) and to register the end of treatment for a patient at withdrawal visit.  
3. Tumour mea surements : tumour assessments should be performed according to RECIST version 1.1. The same method of assessment and the same techniqu e must be used for all evaluations. At each time
point, obtain imaging -based evaluation of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at a minimum (other localisations if clinically indicated) and clinical examination.  
a. Baseline: tumour assessment will be done within 28 days prior to randomisation. Images obtained prior to patient signed ICF m ay be used if the date of the images is within 28 days of randomisation 
and if in line with methods and techniques that will be use d during study. 
b. Treatment period: tumour assessments will be done every 2 cycles from C1D1
c. Withdrawal visit: tumour assessments will be performed only if not performed within previous 8 weeks. Every effort should be made to perform the end of treatment t umo ur assessments prior to the 
start of new anticancer therapy. 
d. Follow -up period: unless patient had discontinued study treatments for radiologic disease progression or withdrawal of consent, obtain tumour assessments within [ADDRESS_480997] previous  
tumour assessment and then every 8 weeks until documentation of radiologic disease progression, regardless of initiation of a  new anticancer therapy.  
4. Survival status : obtain survival status (alive/dead) at scheduled 8 -week intervals until patient death or  end of the study. The information can be obtained remotely by [CONTACT_384515], internet and shared electronic medical records . 
5. Pregnancy testing at screening period : with serum βHCG test only. Note: more frequent pregnancy tests should be performed if required by [CONTACT_1769].  
6. Pregnancy testing at withdrawal : only if not performed within the previous 4 weeks (with serum βHCG or highly sensitive urine test).  
7. ECOG Performance Status during the screening period : the patient’s performance status must remain 0 or 1 during the screening period and at the time of randomisation for the pa tient to remain eligible.
8. Laboratory tests (haematology, biochemistry, coagulation) during screening period : an as sessment performed by [CONTACT_3452] ’s certified laboratory as per routine clinical practice, on samples collected before 
ICF signature [CONTACT_384591], only if the assessment is fully satisfying study protocol criteria in te rms of co mpleteness and time schedule.  
9. Study procedures prior to the first study treatments administration : to be done by [CONTACT_3452]’s certified laboratory at C1D1 prior to study treatments administration only if baseline procedures have been done
more than 7 d ays prior to C1D1.  
10. Study procedures at day 1 of subsequent cycles ≥2 : obtain within [ADDRESS_480998] met resumption criteria prior to administering 
study treatments.

The following measures will be taken in order to minimise b ias: 
­ Stratification by [CONTACT_26766] (North America, European Union, Rest of the World), 
the time since diagnosis of first metastasis (<18 months, ≥18 months) and RAS status (wild 
type, mutant) . 
­ Randomisation, allocation, reallocation and dos e ad justment will be centralised by [CONTACT_10966].  
­ The QoL quest ionnaires ( EORTC QLQ -C30 and EQ -5D- 5L) will be completed by [CONTACT_4677], independently of the study personnel, at the beginning of each visit and prior to any 
study procedure. These questionnaires will be completed in the local language using an 
electronic device (e- PRO). In case the patient is not able to use the e- PRO , a caregiver (not 
a medical/investigator staff) will be allowed to read the questions to the patient and to collect the answer without any interpretation of the questions and the answers. The objective is to 
enhance the validity of QoL data by [CONTACT_384516]. Completion of paper versions of the  QoL questionnaires is not allowed by [CONTACT_760]. 
­ Strategic sponsor personnel will not have access to the arm s of
  treatment. This will be

© I.R.I.S  / TOI  – 30 Dec 2020  - Confidential   42/1 13 hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_15559]. A pos tmenopausal state is 
defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. 
Highl
y effective contraception methods for the study 
Highly
 effective methods of birth control refer to those which result in a low failure rate (i.e. 
less tha n 1% pe
r year), when used consistently and correctly, such as combined hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal), 
progestogen- only hormonal contraception when associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, 
injectable, implantable), some intra uterine devices, intrauterine hormone -releasing system, true 
sexual abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient ), 
bilateral tubal occlusion, male sterilization (vasectomy) .  
Women us
ing hormonal contraceptive must also use a barrier method i.e. condom or occlusive 
cap (diaph
ragm or cervical/vault caps)  
5.4. Retest management during screening period  
A patien
t who has a laboratory result(s) that does not satisfy the entrance criteria may have the 
test(s
) repeated providing that the investigator judges it relevant according to the patient 
previous results, or medical history and if s/he considers laboratory abnormalities are likely to be transient. Results of the test(s) repeated s hould be obtained within the allowed screening 
period. In this case the patient will not be required to sign another informed consent, and the original patient number assigned by [CONTACT_64151].

Infor
mation to be collected during the last visit is given in Section  5.6.2. These follow -up 
modali
ties are used to ensure the efficacy and safety evaluation of all patients  who received the 
IMPs . 
Patient will be on treatment as long as the patient continues with triflu ridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965]. 
Bevacizumab monotherapy is not allowed. Pregnancy  (see Secti
 on [IP_ADDRESS]) and End of study (as defined in Section  4.1.1 ). will lead to  
premature study discontinuation. 
The reasons for discontinuation of treatment period  are:  
­ Adverse events  incompatible with continuation of the study treatments  according to the 
judgment of the investigator, including no recovery in safety parameters or according to the 
following predefined criteria: 
A maximum dose delay >28 days from the scheduled start date of the next cycle

reductions allowed as described in Section  8.11.1 )
­ Protocol deviation if it interferes with the study evaluations and/or if it jeopardises pa tient’s 
sa
fety, e.g. any medical event requiring administration of an unauthorised concomitant 
treatment (see Section  6.3) 
­ Radiologic progressive disease  documented b y CT- scan or MRI  
­ Clinical progressive disease manifested by [CONTACT_384527]  
­ Non-medical reason  (to be c arefully described) e.g. consent withdrawal, patient’s removal  
­ Other, physician decision (for medical r easons that cannot be included in any of the criteria 
listed above) 
5.6.2. Procedu
re 
Upon discontinuation of study treatments , the investigator must: 
­ Notify the sponsor monitor immediately ,  
­ Register the end of treatment for the patient in the IWRS , 
­ Complete the e -CRF, spe cifying the reason for the study patient’s withdrawal. If there are 
several reasons, the investigator must indicate the main reason.  The investigator should 
document the discontinuation in the corresponding medic al file.  
A withdrawal visit should take place within 4 weeks after  the date of IMP withdrawal  and prior 
to the start of a new anticancer therapy.  
In the case of discontinuation due to an AE  (event re quiring immediate notification [ERIN] or 
not), the invest igator must make every effort to collect the information relating to the outcome 
of the event. If necessary, the information will be collected afterwards (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
This inform
ation is recorded in that part of the e-CRF  form which concerns adverse events. If 
the investigator cannot collect the information from a visit, s/ he must collect it from the doctor 
ensuring the follow-up of the patie nt. 
In the case of discontinuation due to an ERIN, please refer to Section 8.7. 
Follow- up period : 
After the withdrawal visit, a follow-up will be done every 8 weeks:  
for tumour assessment (unless patient had discontinued study treatments for radiologic
disease
 progression or withdrawal of consent ) until radiologic progression regardless of
initiation of a new anticancer therapy,
for survival status until death or the end of the study  (whiche ver occur first). This follow -
up can be done remotely by [CONTACT_384528], internet and shared electronic medical records.
Patients are at any time fr ee to disco
 ntinue their participation in the study. If patients wish to 
withdraw their consent to treatment period (i.e. both study treatments and study assessments), they will be asked if they are willing to continue with Follow -up period for survival sta tus 
(which can be done by [CONTACT_648]). If patients wish to withdraw their consent to further participation in the study entirely (treatment period and follow -up period), this should be clearly documented 
in the patient notes and in the clinical study database.  
During t
he follow-up period, the patient can  participa te to another clinical study.  43/113

­ Previous inves tigational or anticancer therapy for m CRC within 4 weeks prior to 
randomisation, 
­ Treatment with systemic immuno suppre ssive therapy (except steroids given in prophylactic 
setting or at a chronic low dose [ ≤20 mg/day prednisone equivalent]), 
­ Radiotherapy in the last 4 weeks prior to randomisation ( exc ept if provided as a short course 
for symptoms palliation only). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. During t he study treatment period 
Patients are not permitted to receive:  
­ Any other investigational or any other anticancer therapy,  incl uding chemotherapy, 
immunotherapy, biological response modifiers, or endocrine therapy, 
­ Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive therapy (except steroids given in prophylactic set
ting or at a chronic low dose [ ≤20 mg/day prednisone equivalent ] or short -term 
administration of steroids at daily doses higher than authorized by [CONTACT_384536]).  
For other precautions of use and interactions of concomitant treatment with bevacizumab please refer t
o Product Information ( Appendix 7). 
6.3.2. Authorised treatments  
­ Palliative radiotherapy is permitted. As far as possible, the irradiation of target les ions m ust 
be avoided. Pre -clinical data showed that trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_105894] a radiosensitizer,  but no 
clinical data are available for the concomitant treatment with trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384470],  so caution is required, and close monitoring of patients is needed. 
­ It is strongly recommended that patients treated with anti- vitamin  K treatment will be switch 
to low molecular weight heparin. 
­ Warning for patients receiving trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965] : 
Caution is required when using drugs that are human thymidine kinase substrates, e.g ., 
zidovudine. Such drugs, if used concomitantly with trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965], may compete with the effector, trifluridine, for activation via thymidine kinases. Therefore, when using antiviral drugs th at are human thymidine kinase substrates, monitor for possible decreased 
efficacy of the antiviral agent, and consider switching to an alternative antiviral agent that is not a human thymidine kinase substrate, such as lamivudine, didanosine and abacavir.

ure ment times  
Tumour assessments/imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at a minimum (other 
loca
lisations if clinically indicated) will be obtained at each time point listed below for all 
patients: 
­ Baseline within 28 days prior to randomisation. 
Note : Images obtained prior to patient signed ICF may be used if the date of the images is 
within 28 days of randomisation and if in line with methods and technique s that will be used 
during study 
­ Every 2 cycles from C1D1  until radiologic  progression is documented (including at the 
withdrawal visit if not done in the previous 8 weeks). 
­ For patients who were withdrawn for r easons other than radiologic disease progress ion or 
consent withdrawal , every 8 weeks during the follow up period until the patient experienced 
radiologic progression, regardless of the initiation of a new anticancer therapy.  
Note:  If the i nvestigator determines that a patient develops clinical progression manifested by 
[CONTACT_384538], the patient 
should stop study treatment s. Symptoms of clinical progression must be document ed in the 
patient’s source documents and in AE form . Tumour assessments will continue every 8 weeks 
until a radiologic progression is documented. 
7.2.2. Method of imaging 
­ The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterise each identi 
fied and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging based evaluation 
should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
­ Images must be acquired of the chest, abdomen and pelvis at a minimum (other localisations if clin
ically indicated) at each time point.  
­ Only CT or MRI must be used for tumour measurement (see specific cases below). 
­ Contrast enhanced CT is the preferred method for tumour assessments. If contrast agent is con
traindicated in a patient, obtain at least a non -contrast chest CT and enhanced magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis. 
Specific cases:  
­ If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], a confirmation by [CONTACT_304405]. 
­ Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥ 10mm 
di
ameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_12151] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended. When lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_51752], imaging

end of the study. 
­ In case of PET CT -sca n, the CT portion of the PET –CT can be used for RECIST 
measurements.  
7.2.3. Tumour definitions  
At ba
seline, tumo ur les ions/lymph nodes will be categorised measurable or non- measurable as 
describe in Sections  [IP_ADDRESS], [IP_ADDRESS], and [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Measu rable lesions  
­ Tumo ur lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in 
th
e plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
[ADDRESS_481011] -scan slice thickness no greater than 5  mm (when CT scans
have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion shouldbe twice the slice thickness),
10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accuratelyme
asured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable),
­ To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_481012] -scan (CT -scan slice thickness no greater than 5  mm). At 
baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Non-meas urable lesions  
­ All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes w
ith ≥10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non -measurable lesions.  
­ Lesions considered truly non- measu rable include leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or 
pericardial effusion, inflammatory  breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, 
abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_87415].  
­ All non- measu
 rable lesions can only be selected as non -target lesions.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Special considerations regarding lesion measurability  
­ Bone lesions: Bone scan, PET -sca
 n or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence ordisappearance of bone lesions,
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blas
 tic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components,
that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_384539],
Blastic bone lesions are non- measu
 rable.
­ Cystic lesions: Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not beconsi
dered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are,
by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts,
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurableles
ions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if
Trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384363]. CL3- [ZIP_CODE]- 007 – Final version  
© I.R.I.S  / TOI  – 30 Dec 2020  - Confidential   52/1 13 noncystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions. 
­ Lesions with prior local treatment: tumo ur l esions situated in a previously irradiated area, or 
in an area subjected to other loco -regional therapy, are not considered measurable unless 
there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. 
7.2.4. Documentation of “target” and “non-target” lesions 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Ta
rget lesions  
­ When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum 
of fi
ve lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved 
organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.  
­ Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be re
presentative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves 
to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. 
­ A sum of the diameters (long
 est for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters . If lymph nodes 
are to be included in the sum, then, only the short axis is added into the sum.  
­ The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterise any objective tumour
 regression in the measurable dimension of the disea se. 
Specific situations: 
­ Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of <10  mm.  
­ While on study, all lesions (nodal and non -noda l)
  recorded at baseline should have their 
actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small ( e.g. 
2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT -scan th at the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning 
an exact measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. In this case a value must be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_384473], the measurement should be recorded as 0  mm. If the lesion is 
believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned. 
­ When non- nodal l
 esions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should 
be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.  
­ An option of ‘Not Assessable’ for a lesion will only apply to lesions that that cannot be read due t
o technical reasons, for example:  
CT artefact.
Patient positioning where the lesions are obstructed or cannot be seen.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Non-ta rget lesions 
­ Non-target lesions include all n on-meas urable lesions and measurable lesions that have not 
been selected as target lesions.  
­ Lymph nodes that have a short axis <10 mm are considered non -pathol ogical and should not 
be recorded.  
­ All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological lymph nodes, should be 
ident
ified as non- target lesions and should also be recorded at Baseline. Measurements are 
not required, but their presence, absence, or unequivocal progression should be followed throughout the study. 
For additional guidance refer  to REC
 IST 1.1. (Eisenhauer, 2009)  and RECIST 1.1: Update and 
clarif
ication (Schwartz, 2016) . 
7.2.5. Response criteria  
On-site assessments will include the assessment of: 
­ Target and non-target tumour responses. 
­ New lesions if any  
­ Overall response.  
The
 above assessments will be made as per the time points identified in Section  4.1.2. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Target and Non -tar get Response Assessments  
The definition of responses for Target and Non- targe t lesions is presented in  Table ([IP_ADDRESS]) 1  
and Tab
le ([IP_ADDRESS]) 2 respectively.  
Table  ([IP_ADDRESS] ) 1 – Target lesions response definitions  
TARGET LESIONS  
Lesions Response  Definition  
Complete Response (CR)  The disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have 
reduction in short axis to <10  mm. 
Partial Response (PR)  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of the target lesions, taking as a 
reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of the target lesions, taking as a 
reference the smallest sum on study, including the baseline sum. In addition to the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at 
least 5  mm. Definitive new lesion presence also indicates progression.  
Stable Disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for  
PD, taking as a reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  

Trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384363]. CL3- [ZIP_CODE]- 007 – Final version  
© I.R.I.S  / TOI  – 30 Dec 2020  - Confidential   54/1 13 Table  ([IP_ADDRESS] ) 2 – Non-target lesions response definitions  
NON- TARGET LESIONS  
Lesions Response  Definition  
Complete Response (CR)  The disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalisation of tumour marker 
level . All lymph nodes must be non -pathological morphologically ( i.e., <10  mm in 
short axis in size).  
Non-CR/Non -PD A persistence of ≥1 non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumour marker 
level above the normal limits (not reaching the extent of ‘unequivocal 
progression).  
Progressive Disease (PD)  Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions (see definition below). 
(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).  
When the patient has measurable disease and non- measurable disease, to achieve “unequivocal 
progression” on the basis of the non -target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial 
worsening in non- target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the 
overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest 
‘increase’ in the size of one or more non- target lesions is usuall y not sufficient to quality for 
unequivocal progression status.  
Tumour markers alone cannot be  used to assess objective tumour response. If CEA level is 
initially above the upper normal limit, however, it must normalise for a patient to be considered 
in complete response. 
For additional guidance refer to RECIST 1.1. (Eisenhauer, 2009)  and RECIST 1.1: Update and 
clarif
ication (Schwartz, 2016) . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. New lesions  
­ The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comm
ents on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal: i.e. not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumour (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing  lesions). This is 
particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. 
­ A lesion identified on a follow -up stud
 y in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.  
­ If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and foll
ow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
­ For new lesions discovered by [CONTACT_6789] -PET
  scan please refers to RECIST 1.1 (Eisenhauer, 
2009) .

Any laboratory abnormality that has a clinical impact on the patient, e.g., results in delay of 
study
 medications dosing, study discontinuation, requires treatment due to abnormal values, or 
is considered by [CONTACT_384540], must be reported as an AE, unless it is considered a supporting analysis to a clinical diagnosis that is already reported as an AE.  
All laboratory data will be analysed using NCI -CTCA

8.3. Definition of Adverse events  
An AE  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical 
stud
y, whether or not there is a causal relationship with the study treatments  and/or 
experimental procedures, occurring or detected from the date the patient  signs the  information 
and consent form, irrespective of the period of the study (periods without administration of the study treatments  are also concerned).  
An adverse event can therefore be:  
­ any unfavourable and unintended sign ( incl
 uding an abnormal finding from an additional 
examination such as lab tests, X -rays, ECG, …)  which is deemed clinically relevant by [CONTACT_1275] ,  
­ any symptom or disease,  
­ any worsening during the study of a symptom or a disease already present when the patient  
ente
red the study (increase in frequency and/or intensity), including the studied pathology, 
and detected during a study visit or at an additional examination or occurred since the previous study
 visit (including relevant event reported in patient’s diary or safety evaluation scale).  
Of note: 
­ Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192610] -tumo ural treatment and/or associated 
protocol (during or after the study) or other care measures for cancer (e.g. overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192611] a blood or  platelets transfusion), for social reasons, educational 
purpose  (e.g. learning of diabetes management by [CONTACT_102] ) or routine check- up should 
not be considered as an adverse event and should not be reported in the e- CRF . 
­ The following procedures, whether planned before the study or not, whether leading to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192612], should not be reported in the e- CRF and kept in the source data 
(or patient file):   
therapeutic procedures related to a non -aggravated medical history (e.g. cataract
extraction not due to an aggravation of the cataract during the study, haemodialysissessions related to a renal insufficiency not aggravated during the study),
prophylactic procedures (e.g. sterilisation, wisdom teeth removal),
comfort procedures (e.g. cosmetic surgery),
control procedures of a pre -exi
 sting condition without aggravation (e.g. colonoscopy to
control the remission of colon cancer).

© I.R.I.S  / TOI  – 30 Dec 2020  - Confidential   61/1 13 8.4. Definition of Serious adverse events  
Any adverse event that at, any dose:  
­ results i n deat h, 
­ is life -threatening  (1), 
­ requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
­ is medically significant (2), 
­ results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (3), 
­ is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (4). 
(1)Life-t hreatening in this context refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were
more severe.
(2)Any event that might not be  im mediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], but
might jeopardise the participant or might require intervention to prevent one of these outcomes (forexample: oedema or allergic bronchospasm that required intensive treatment at home, blood dyscrasia,
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], or development of drug dependence or drug abuse). The
investigator should exercise his/her scientific and medical judgement to decide whether or not such an
event requires expedited reporting to sponsor.
(3)Disability/incapacity in this context refers to any event that seriously disrupts the ability of the
p
articipant to lead a normal life, in other words leads to a persistent or permanent significant change,
deterioration, injury or perturbation of the participant's body functions or structure, physical activity
and/or quality of life.
(4)Congenital anomaly or birth defect refers to the exposure to the IMP before conception (in men or
w
omen) or during pregnancy that resulted in an adverse outcome in the child.
8.5. Definition of Overdose 
This refers to any intake of a quantity of IMP or a product other than the IMP taken as part of 
the prot
ocol (NIMP) which is above the maximum dose recommended in the study protocol, 
independently of the occurrence of any adverse event. 
The quantity should be considered per administration or cumulatively regarding the maximum 
dose re
commended in the study protocol. An overdose with trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384475] a dose beyond the recommended dose in one day or beyond the recommended total dose in each cycle (i.e., 35 mg/m²/dose or >160 mg/day for trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965]).  
There is no known antidote available in case of trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384476]
 . Overdose should 
be mana ged aggressively with close monitoring and administration of prophylactic and 
symptomatic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_384477] . 
For bevacizumab: please refer to Product Information (Appendix 7) for overdose ma nagem ent 
information. 
8.6. Definition of Adverse event of special interest  
Not
 applicable.

© I.R.I.S  / TOI  – 30 Dec 2020  - Confidential   62/1 13 8.7. Definition of Events requiring an immediate notification (ERIN)  
An event must be notified immediately  (i.e.  without delay and within [ADDRESS_481018]) to the sponsor if it is:  
­ a serious adverse event,  
­ an overdose of the study treatments even if asymptomatic,  
­ any intake of the study treatments by a person around the patient , 
­ a pregnancy , 
­ an
y event s of COVI D-19. 
8.8. Classification of an adverse event (seriousness, severity, causality, expectedness)  
It i
s important that the investigator gives his/her own opi[INVESTIGATOR_192614] , the 
in
tensity  of the event as well as the cause -effect relationship  between an adverse event and 
the study tre atments. This evaluation must be assessed by [CONTACT_384541]. In addition, the sponsor will be responsible for the evaluation the expectedness  of 
the event (See Section  8.9.3).  
The Seriousness  should be evaluated according to international guidance (see definition 
Section  8.3, in accordance with ICH Topic E2A and DIRECTIVE 2001/20/EC OF THE 
EUROP
EAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 4 April).  
The severity  of all AEs will be graded according to the NCI -CTCAE on a five -point scale 
(Grade 1 to 5):  
­ Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
­ Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or non- inva sive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL1. 
­ Grade 3: Severe or medically sign ificant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -care 
ADL2. 
­ Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
­ Grade 5: Death related to AE.  
The cau sal relationship  to the study treatments , to the experimental procedures or to disease 
progression must  be assessed when reporting the AE in the AE form. Cases ticked “related” by 
[CONTACT_384542] a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the study treatments  (AE linked to the mechanism of action of the study treatments …), will 
be considered as S uspected Adverse Drug Reaction. In general, if a relationship between AE 
and drug is at least reasonably possible (i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled out) it is to be considered as “related”.  
1 Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL) refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_19640], usi ng the telephone, managing money, etc.  
2 Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden”.

8.9.1. Time frame for AE reporting  
Any
 event meeting the above mentioned definitions (see Sections  8.3 to 8.7) must be reported 
to the sponsor on an adverse event form  if it occurred:  
-before the first intake of the IMPs , for event associated with any procedure/condition
required by [CONTACT_4690] : procedure (exercise test, MRI, etc.), change or
withdrawal of previous/concomitant treatment relating to the conditions of the protocol
or a product other than the test drug, taken as part of the protocol (NIMP),
-at any time after the first intake of the IMPs up to the patient’s last IMPs intake for allevent

8.9.3. R
esponsibilities of the sponsor  
In ac
cordance with international guidance, the assessment of the seriousness and the causality 
of adver
se events are usually made by [CONTACT_192693]’s duties, 
who is responsible for ensuring that all suspected unexpected serious adve rse reactions are 
reported to Competent Authorities and Ethics Committees.  
The sponsor will review the seriousness of the adverse events and the causality of (at least) the 
seri
ous adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_192694]. The 
causality and the seriousness may be upgraded (but never downgraded). Anonymized copi[INVESTIGATOR_192620], laboratory tests reports, reports of other examination aiding diagnosis may be asked for the event assessment. If the assessments of the investigator and the sponsor are different, both will be reported in the clinical study report. 
In addition, the spons
 or is responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or 
unexpected . An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the 
event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the IMP. Independently of the regulatory obligations of the investigator, the sponsor must report t he 
phar
macovigilance data and any new safety finding likely to affect the benefit /risk balance of 
the product, required in ICH GCP  guidelines and local regulations, to the appropriate 
Trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384363]. CL3- [ZIP_CODE]- 007 – Final version

termination of the study).  
8.10. Responsibilities of Data Safety Monitoring Committee  
As des
cribed in Section  12.4, the  DSMB is an independent group of experts which provides 
expert
ise and recommendations to the International Coordinator and sponsor.  
In accordance with the charter and the rules for functioning, the DSMB  is  responsible for 
reviewing the safety data on a regular basis and  providing written recommendations to the 
International Coordinator and the sponsor regarding the conduct of the study. 8.11. Management of treatment dose adaptations due to toxicities 
For pa
tients who have experienced a dosing mo dification , reasons for dose modifications or 
delays, the supportive measures taken, and the outcome will be documented in the patient's 
source documents and recorded in the e- CRF.  
General rules:  
­ Before starting a new treatment cycle, toxicity must have resolved as specified in the Sections  8.11.1 and  8.11.2. 
­ Treatment interruptions are regarded as lost treatment days and missed doses should not be repl
aced; the planned treatment schedule should be maintained.

8.12.1. Management of nausea and vomiting 
Trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384488].  
­ A single antiemetic agent, such as dexamethasone, a [ADDRESS_481021], such as metoclopramide may be considered for prophylaxis. 
­ If a patient experiences acute or delayed nausea or vomiting due to trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965], it is 
advi
sed that, at the next cycle, a higher antiemetic regimen may be given.  
­ In case a patient experiences of anticipatory nausea and vomiting, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_384489].  
(Roila, 2016) , (Hesketh, 2016)  
8.12.2. Management of diarrhoea 
Educa
te both patients and patients’ families regarding the potential seriousness of 
chemot
herapy -induced diarrhoea. Instruct patients to immediately contact [CONTACT_384549]. The patient should be instructed to record the number of stools and report symptoms indicating a complicated diarrhoea (see list below).  
Educate the patient regarding the dietary measures to be taken in case of diarrhoea.  
Provide patients with loperamide (or other standard antidiarrheal therapy) and instruct the patie
nt on how to use it at the first sign of diarrhoea. 
Monitor the patient’s fluid and electrolyte balance, with appropriate intervent ion as  clinically 
indicated with fluids and electrolyte replacement (Benson III, 2004) . 
Mild to moderate diarrhoea ( grade [ADDRESS_481022]- CTCAE without complications): 
­ It is recommended to start dietary modifications and standard antidiarrheal therapy  for 
example loperamide at an initial dose of 4 mg followed by 2  mg every 4 hours or after every 
unformed stool (not to exceed 16 mg/day).  
­ If diarrhoea resolves with antidiarrheal therapy, the dietary modifications should be conti
nued (with a gradually addition of solid foods). Antidiarrheal therapy  may be 
discontinued when the patient has been diarrhoea-free for at least 12 hours.  
­ If diarrhoea persists for more than 24 hours, the dose of anti diarrheal therapy  should be 
increased (for loperamide increase to 2 mg every 2 hours), and oral antibiotics may be started as prophylaxis for infection.  
­  If diarrhoea has not resolved after 48 hours on initial treatment, the patient should be started 
on a se
cond- line antidiarrheal agent.  
Complicated diarrhoea: 
­ Any grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea is classified as “complicated”. In addition, grade [ADDRESS_481023] one of the following symptoms are also considered as complicated: fever, sepsis, moderate to severe crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007],
grade 2 nausea/vomiting,
decreased performance status,
neutropenia,
frank bleeding,
dehydration
­ Aggressive management of complicated cases should involve  intravenous (IV) fluids;

severely dehydrated, with dose escalation up to 500 µg until diarrhoea is controlled,
administration of antibiotics (e.g., fluoroquinolone).
­ Stool work- up (evaluation for bl ood, faecal leukocyte s, C difficile, Salmonella, E coli, 
Campylobacter, and infectious colitis), complete blood count, and electrolyte profile should 
be performed.  
­ Continue intervention as described until the patient has been diarrhoea -free for 24 hours . 
8.12.3. Management of mucosal injury  
M
ucositis refers to mucosal damage secondary to cancer therapy occurring in the oral cavity; 
pharyngeal, la
ryngeal, and oesophageal regions; and other areas of the gastrointestinal tract. 
Oral mucositis presents as erythema and/or ulceration  of the oral mucosa. Gastrointestinal 
mucositis presents with debilitating symptoms such as pain, nausea/vomiting, and diarrho ea. 
Prevention and education of the patient: 
­ The patient must be appropriately educated about oral complications before treatment and be advised to have regular dental examinations and inform the health care professional at first signs and symptoms of oral complications. Sources of trauma (e.g. sharp edges and ill -
fitting prostheses) should be eliminated and painful stimuli such as h ot foods and drinks and 
hard, sharp, or spi[INVESTIGATOR_384490]. 
­ Sodium bicarbonate mouthwash can be used to rinse the mouth (4 to 6 times a day) as long as the patient is
 treated by [CONTACT_76395].  
Treatment of mucositis: 
­ 0.5% doxepin mouthwash and transdermal fentanyl may be used to treat pain due to oral mucositis.  
­ For bevacizumab -related stomatitis
 : 
The frequency of use of sodium bicarbonate containing mouthwash can be increased, ifnecessary, up to e
ach hour to treat stomatitis.
Sugarless chewing gum or candy, salivary substitutes or sialagogues should be consideredto treat oral dr
yness.
Adequate pain management, e.g. anaesthetic mouthwashes (viscous lidocaine 2%),coating agents
, or systemic analgesics following the WHO pain management ladder may
be provided.
Coating agents, topi[INVESTIGATOR_384491] -inflammatory  agents, topi[INVESTIGATOR_344545], and
alternative mouthwashes may be considered.

[IP_ADDRESS].1. Prim ary estimand based on the OS  
As explained before, the primary estimand of interest is the effect of the randomized treatments on the sur
vival duration in all subjects regardless of whether or not intercurrent events occur 
(treatment policy strategy). The motivation for this choice is to assess the efficacy of the triflur idine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384498]/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384499] (intercurrent events are considered to be part of the treatments being compared).  
All data collected during the trial regardless of occurrence of an IE  will be u
 sed. This is aligned 
with the treatment policy strategy.

© I.R.I.S  / TOI  – 30 Dec 2020  - Confidential   76/1 13 [IP_ADDRESS].1.1. Primary analysis 
The distribution of OS will be compared between the two treatment groups using a stratified 
log-ra
nk test at one -sided 2.5% level of significance (stratification factors based on IWRS data). 
OS for each arm will be summarized using Kaplan Meier curves and  furt her characterized in 
terms of the median and survival probabilities at 6, 12 and 18 months along with the corresponding 2- sided 95% CI for the estimates.  
The hazard ratio of OS with its 95% confidence interval will be estimated with a stratified Cox proporti
onal hazard model (stratification factors based on IWRS data). 
For
 missing data (not linked to intercurrent events), i.e. patients without documentation of death 
(lost to
 follow -up, withdrawal of consent, administrative end of study), the OS will be censored 
on the last contact [CONTACT_384556] -off date, whichever is 
earlier.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.2. Sens itivity analyses 
As sensitivity analyses, the following analyses will be done: 
­ The proportional hazards assumption will be checked. If relevant, other statistical method 
could be
 used. 
­ The distribution of OS will be compared between the treatment groups using an unstratified log-r 
ank test and the hazard ratio (together with associated 95% CI) resulting from an 
unstratified Cox model will be presented. 
­ OS analysis excluding patients not fulfilling one of the following criteria: 
Has histologically confirmed unresectable adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum
Has received a maximum of [ADDRESS_481024]
regimen
Has measurable or non -measu rable metastatic lesion(s) as defined by [CONTACT_384557] (RECIST) version 1.1
Has an East ern C ooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1
More than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer
Has previously received trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965]
Does not currently received or has not received anticancer th era pi[INVESTIGATOR_6523] 4 weeks prior
to randomisation
Other sensitivity analyses will be defined in the SAP if necessary.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.3. Supplem entary analyses  
Subgroup analyses 
OS subgroup analyses are planned to further explore the homogeneity of the treatment effect 
acros
s patient subsets. Depending on the sample size, the following subgroups will be 
examined: region (North America, European Union, Rest of the World), time sinc e diagnosis 
of 1st metastasis (<18, ≥18 months), RAS (wild, mutant), location of primary disease (right, 
left), ECOG performance status (0, 1), gender (female, male), age (<70, ≥70 years), prior

ratio (NLR<3, NLR≥3),  number of prior regimens, BRAF (wild, mutant) and MSI status 
(MSI -H, MSS/MSI -L), prior bevacizumab (yes, no), subsequent regorafenib (yes, no). 
An unstratified Cox -regre ssion model with treatment arm as predictor variable will be fitted 
separately for each subgroup category. The hazard ratio for treatment along with the associated 
95% confidence interval will be provided. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. A
dditio nal estimand based on OS  
The other estimand based on OS is defined in order to assess the effect of the randomized 
treatmen
ts on the survival time in all subjects before patients  receive further anti -cancer therapy 
(while on treatment strategy). The aim of this estimand is to evaluate the effect of the study treatment without a potential effect of another therapy 
The use of data post intercurrent events will be different accordin g to the 
 IE: 
-For IE “ admini stration of further anti -cancer therapy”  and “treatment switch”:  data
obtained post IE will not be used for the analysis. OS will be censored at the time of
administration of further anti- cancer therapy.
-For IE “ treatme nt discontinuation”: time of death for any cause after treatment
discontinuation will be taken into account.
These strategies are aligned with this estimand.  
The distribution of OS will be compared between the two treatment groups using a stratifie d 
log-rank t
est at one -sided 2.5% level of significance (stratification factors based on IWRS data). 
For missing data (not linked to intercurrent events), i.e. patients without documentation of death (lost to f
ollow -up, withdrawal of consent, administrative end of study), the OS will be censored 
on the last contact [CONTACT_384556] -off date, whichever is 
earlier.  
Other estimands will be defined in the SAP if necessary.

Secondary estimand based on PFS 
Important secondary estimands of interest is the effect of the randomized treatments on 
progres
sion- free survival in all subjects regardless of whether or not intercurrent events occur 
(treatment policy strategy) .  
All d
ata collected during the trial regardless of occurrence of an IE  will be u sed. This is aligned 
with the estimand and the treatment policy strategy.  
The
 following analyses will be done as primary analyses: 
The distribution  of P FS will be compared between the two treatment groups using a
stratified log -rank test at one -sided 2.5% level of significance (stratification factors based
on IWRS data).
PFS for each arm will be summarized using Kaplan Meier curves and furtherchara c 
terized in terms of the median and survival probabilities at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months
along with the corresponding 2- sided 95% CI for the estimates.
The hazard ratio of PFS with its  95% confidence interval will be estimated with a
stratified Cox proportional hazard model (stratification factors based on IWRS data).
PF
S is identified as the key secondary variable. A hierarchical testing strategy, where PFS is to 
be sta
tistically evaluated and interpreted only if the primary efficacy estimand OS is 
significantly different between the 2 treatment groups, will be used to control the overall type- I error rate.  
The
 following analyses will be done as sensitivity  analys es: 
The distribution of PFS will be also compared between the treatment groups using anuns
tratif ied log- rank test and the hazard ratio (together with associated 95% CI) resulting
from an unstratified Cox model will be presented.
An analysis that considers clinical progression and administration of further anti -cance r
therapy as PFS events in addition  to the radiological progression or death.
For
 missing data (not linked to intercurrent events), i.e. patients who were lost to follow -up or 
who have
 withdrawn their consent without radiological progression or reached the time point 
of analysis without a known record of death or radiological progression, the PFS will be 
censored at the date of last evaluable tumour assessment or the cut -off date, whichever is earlier. 
The
 same subgroup analyses as used for the primary estimand will be done for PFS. 
Secondary estimands based on ORR and DCR  
Ot
her secondary estimand of interest are the effect of the randomized treatments on response 
in all su
bjects before modification of randomized treatment. 
Res
ponses recorded after intercurrent event will be excluded. This is aligned with the estimand 
and t he tr
eatment while on treatment strategy.

tment arms using Fisher’s exact test and 2 -sided 95% Clopper -Pearson CIs. A 2 -sided 
95% CI for the difference in ORR between the two treatment arms will also be provided based on the normal approximation. If a stratified analysis is required a Cochran- Mantel -
Haenszel (CMH) test will be used. A 2 -sided 95% CI for the difference in ORR betw een the 
two treatment arms will also be provided based on the normal approximation. 
­ DCR based on the investigator’s tumour assessment will be compared in the FAS between trea
tment arms using Fisher’s exact test and 2 -sided 95% Clopper -Pearson CIs. A 2 -side d 
95% CI for the difference in DCR between the two treatment arms will also be provided based on the normal approximation. If a stratified analysis is required a Cochran- Mantel -
Haenszel (CMH) test will be used. A 2 -sided 95% CI for the difference in DCR be tween the 
two treatment arms will also be provided based on the normal approximation.

The e- CRF will be produced by I.R.I.S. in compliance with its specifications. The investigator 
or a de
signated person from his/her team will be trained for the use of the e -CRF by [CONTACT_384568]’s representatives . 
Data entry  at the investigator’s site will be performed by [CONTACT_384569]/her team after completion of the patient’s  Medical File . 
Upon entry, data will be transmitted via the Internet from the study centre to the study databas e. 
The investigator or the designated person from his/her team agrees to complete the e- CRF, at  
each patient  visit, and all other documents provided by [CONTACT_456] (e.g. documents relating to 
the study treatments  management…).  
Data recorded directly on e-C RF and  considered as source data (see Section  4.5) must be 
collec
ted immediately in the e -CRF. The other e -CRF forms must be completed as soon as 
possible following each visit. 
All corrections of data on the e -CRF mu st be made by [CONTACT_384570]/her team using electronic data clarifications according to the provided 
instructions. All data modification will be recorded using the audit trail feature of  INFORM  
software, including date, reason for modification and identification of the person who has made 
the change.  
In order to ensure confidentiality and security of the data, usernames and passwords will be used to r
estrict system access to authorised personnel only, whether resident within the 
investigator’s sites, the sponsor or third parties. 
Data will be verified in accordance with the monitoring strategy defined for the study. After 
compar
ing these data to the source documents, the monitor will request correction / clarification 
from the investigator using electronic data clarifications that should be answered and closed as quickly as possible. 
Data can be frozen during the study after their validation. However,  the inve
 stigator has the 
possibility to modify a data if deemed via a request to the sponsor. After the last visit of the pati
 ent, the investigator or co- investigator must attest the authenticity 
of the data collected in the e- CRF by [CONTACT_121296]/her user name [CONTACT_2383].  
After the data base lock, the investigator or an authorized member of his/her  team will  have to 
download from the e -CRF an electronic file containing patient  data from his/her centre for 
archiving it in the study file (see S ection  14.3).

Data are collected via an e- CRF an d stored in a secured database.  
For data collected on the e- CRF, t he Clinical Data Management of I.R.I.S. is responsible for 
data processing including data validation performed according to a s pecification manual 
describing the checks to be carried out. As a result of data validation, data may require some 
changes. An electronic data clarification form is sent to the investigator who is required to respond to the query and make any necessary cha nges to the data.  
For data transferred from  e-PRO , t
 he Clinical Data Management of I.R.I.S. is responsible for 
data transfer : e-PRO  provider provides electronic transfer of computerised data to the Clinical 
Data Management of I.R.I.S. Data are transferred according to a transfer protocol issued by [CONTACT_941] I.R.I.S. data manager.
For data transferred from IWRS, the Data & Clinical Logistics of I.R.I.S. is responsible for data 
trans
fer: IWRS provider provides electronic transfer of computerised data to the Data & 
Clinical Logistics of I.R.I.S. Data are transferred according to a transfer protocol issued by [CONTACT_941] I.R.I.S. data manager.
The Medical Data Department of I.R.I.S. is responsible for data coding including: 
­ medical / surgical history, adverse event
 s and procedures using MedDRA, 
­ medications using World Health Organization, Drug Dictionary (WHO- Dru g). 
The coding process is described in a specification manual. 
The investigator ascertains he/she will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. Under 
no circ
umstances should the investigator contact [CONTACT_192741], if any, to request approval of a protocol deviation, as no deviations are permitted. If the investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by [CONTACT_138849]/IEC it cannot be implemented. All important protocol deviations will be recorded and reported in t he clinical study report.  
When data validation is achieved, a review of the da
 ta is performed according to the sponsor 
standard operating procedure. When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked, and the study treatments codes will be unblinded and made available 
for data analysis.  
14.3. Archiving  
The
 investigator will keep all information relevant to the study for at least 25 years  after the 
end of the study, or more if specified by [CONTACT_18600].  
At the end of the study, the investigator or an author ized member of his/her team  will download 
an electronic copy of each participant’s data from the e- CRF and should keep it in a reliable, 
secure and durable location. The file includes all data and comments reported in the e- CRF, the 
history of all queries and signatures and the full audit trail reports.  The file must include appropriate restrictions (password protection) and adequate protection 
from l
oss, physical damage or deterioration for the duration of the archiving p eriod.

WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI 
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by [CONTACT_941]:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_481037], Republic of South Africa, October 1996  
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000  
53th WMA General Assembly, Washington DC, [LOCATION_003], 2002 (Note of Clarification added)  
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, 2004 (Note of Clarification added)  
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 2008  
64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013  
Preamble  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects , including
research on identifiable human material and data.
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs
should be
 applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily tophys 
icians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving
human subjects to adopt these principles
General Principles  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The healthof my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethicsdeclares th at, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical
care.”
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well -being
  and rights
of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physic ian's
knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving
human s
ubjects.
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the
caus
es, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proveninterventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety,effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all
human s
ubjects and protect their health and rights.

In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -trial
provi
sions.
Research Ethics Committees  
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and
approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This
committee must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher,the sponsor and any other undue influence and must be duly qualified. It must take into

© I.R.I.S  / TOI  – 30 Dec 2020  - Confidential   101/[ADDRESS_481040] submit a final report to the committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions. 
Privacy and Confidentiality 
24. Every precautio n must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the
confidentiality of their personal information.
Informed Consent  
25. Participation by [CONTACT_384582]. Although it may be appropriate to consult family membersor community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolledin a research study unless he or she freely agrees.
26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving inform ed co
 nsent, each
potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding,any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipatedbenefits and potential risks of the study and the dis comfort it may entail, post- study
provisions and any other relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must beinformed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to withdraw consent to
participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be given to the specific
information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver
the information.
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or
another
 appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely -
given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed inwriting, the non-written consent must be formally documented and witnessed.
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the
gene
ral outcome and results of the study.
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician must
be p
articularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dep endent relationship with the
physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be
sought by [CONTACT_384583].

© I.R.I.S  / TOI  – 30 Dec 2020  - Confidential   102/[ADDRESS_481041]’s dissent should be respected.
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent,for e
xample, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition
that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary charact eristic of the research group.
In such circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from the legallyauthorised representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannotbe delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specificreasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informedconsent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by [CONTACT_384584]. Consent to remain in the research must be obtained as soon aspossible from the subject or a legally authorised representative.
31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to theresea
rch. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to
withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient- physician relationship.
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research onmater 
ial or data contained in bi obanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek
informed consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptionalsituations where consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for suchresearch. In such situations the resea rch may be done only after consideration and
approval of a research ethics committee.
Use of Placebo  
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested againstthose of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances:
Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable;
or
Wher
e for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any
inter
vention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention
is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention
and the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one,
place
bo, or no intervention will not be subject to additiona l risks of serious or irreversible
harm as a result of not receiving the best proven intervention.

alleviating suffering. This intervention should subsequently be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, 
where appropriate, made publicly available.

fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or dyspnea (shortness of breath).  
Class II (Mild)  Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity 
results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or dyspnea.  
Class III (Moderate)  Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary 
activity causes fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or dyspnea.  
Class IV (Severe)  Unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac 
insufficiency at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

Page 5 of 321. Objectives
1.1 The objective of this research is to perform a non-masked, randomized clinical 
trial to assess pain levels and function and level of care required by [CONTACT_630903]/painful bladder syndrome (IC/BPS) randomized to treatment   
with mindfulness and yoga + standard of care compared to standard care alone. 
Standard of care for IC/BPS is defined as treatments recommended in the 
American Association of Urology (AUA) guidelines (see Table 1). The target 
population is patients who have IC/BPS and are willing to be randomized to 
mindfulness/yoga therapy or standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_630888] 1: AUA Treatment Guidelines for IC/PBS 
First Line General relaxation/ Stress management, pain management, patient 
education, self-care, behavioral modification
Second Line Appropriate manual physical therapy techniques, oral agents 
including: amitriptiline, cimetidine, hydroxyzine, PPS, intravesical 
instillation of DMSO, heparin, lidocaine.
Third Line Cystoscopy under anesthesia with hydrodistension, treatment of 
Hunner’s lesions if found.
Fourth LineIntradetrusor Botulinum Toxin A, Neuromodulation. 
Fifth Line Cyclosporine A
Sixth LineDiversion with or without cystectomy, substitution cystoplasty
1.2 Our central hypothesis is that IC/BPS participants treated with yoga and 
mindfulness will have greater improvement in their symptoms than those treated 
with standard of care alone. Specifically:
1.3 Outcomes & Hypotheses:  
i) IC/BPS participants treated with mindfulness and yoga will assess their 
response to treatment based on the Graded Response Assessment (GRA) scale 
(described below) at [ADDRESS_841823] care participants. 
Hypothesis: IC/BPS participants treated with mindfulness & yoga + Standard of 
care will have superior scores on the GRA scale compared to those treated with 
Standard of Care alone.
PROTOCOL TITLE: MYPAICE: Mindfulness and Yoga for Pain with Interstitial 
Cystitis Evaluation
Page 6 of 32ii) Participants will start with 1st  and 2nd Line therapy as recommended by [CONTACT_630904] (AUA guidelines categorize treatments as 1st through 6th Lines of 
care) and we will record the numbers of participants that accelerate to higher lines 
of therapy. Hypothesis: IC/BPS participants treated with mindfulness & yoga + 
Standard of care will have fewer participants who accelerate to higher Lines of 
care compared to those treated with Standard of care alone.  
iii) Participants will record pain, function and other IC/BPS symptoms using 
validated questionnaires at baseline and at follow-up (approximately at 6 and 12 
weeks of treatment). Hypothesis: IC/BPS participants treated with mindfulness & 
yoga + Standard of care will have greater improvement in pain, function and 
other IC/BPS symptoms compared to participants treated with Standard of care 
alone, based on validated questionnaires. 
iv) Cost-analysis will be performed comparing treatment groups. Hypothesis: 
Cost analysis will find that those treated with mindfulness & yoga + Standard of 
care will incur less cost than Standard of care alone.
v) Qualitative outcomes will be obtained  with an optional response during the 
weekly interviews to see how participant’s feel their treatment is going. At a later 
time we may go back and enter quotes into qualitative software for analysis of 
themes. Hypothesis: Patients in the mindfulness& yoga + Standard of care may 
feel more empowered about their health. 
2. Background
IC/PBS is a chronic urologic pain disorder associated with significant 
morbidity. It is defined by [CONTACT_630905] 
(AUA) as “a complex sensation (pain, pressure, or discomfort) perceived to be 
related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of 
more than 6 weeks duration, in the absence of infection or any other 
identifiable causei.”  A 2015 survey of 1,982 patients with IC/BPS noted that, 
of the 180 treatment modalities, none were truly effective.  In the survey, 
patients were surveyed about their usage of complementary and alternative 
medicine (CAM). Of those who responded, 84.2% had tried CAM and 55% 
had been recommended CAM by [CONTACT_630906].   There are many reasons 
as to why patients turn to CAM, including side effects experienced from 
traditional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], lack of efficacy and frustration with providersiii. 
Some of the more widespread CAM modalities recommended in medicine 
include yoga and mindfulness, as these have gained popularity for chronic 
pain disorders. Yoga has been shown to improve outcomes in such pain 
disorders as low back pain, primary dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, and 
fibromyalgiaiv. This is likely secondary to the physical components of holding 
poses and mindfulness of breath.  However, no studies have been performed 
to evaluate the impact of yoga on patient’s perception of pain with IC/BPS.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: MYPAICE: Mindfulness and Yoga for Pain with Interstitial 
Cystitis Evaluation
Page [ADDRESS_841824] musculoskeletal pain. Patients’ overall perception of pain may 
be increased with chronic stress, anxiety and allodyniav.  However newer apps 
such as Headspace and Calm have proven beneficial for improvements in the 
affect, stress and irritability associated with chronic pain in as little as 8 
weeksvi. One systematic review even noted that an 8 week mindfulness course 
induced brain changes similar to traditional long term meditation practice on 
functional MRIvii. 
Mind/body interventions have successfully treated chronic pain conditions 
such as low back painviii, irritable bowel syndromeix and fibromyalgiax. 
Reports regarding treatment response using mind/body therapi[INVESTIGATOR_630889]/BPS are fewer, thus our aim was to assess the impact of yoga and 
mindfulness practice+ Standard of care compared to Standard Care alone. 
Standard of care treatments for IC/BPS have been well defined by [CONTACT_630907] (see Table 1). Our hypothesis is that patients 
who undergo mindfulness & yoga therapy + Standard of Care compared to 
Standard of care alone, will have improved response to treatment. We also 
hypothesize that they will have greater improvement in their pain, activities 
and require fewer treatment interventions. If funding allows, we will also 
compare cost of treatment between groups. 
3. Study Design
We will perform an unmasked, randomized controlled trial comparing yoga and 
mindfulness impact on 1) treatment response 2) level of treatment required 3) pain, 
activity and quality of life for patients with IC/BPS compared to standard care alone 
as recommended by [CONTACT_551289] (Table 1). The target population will be those patients 
with IC/BPS who are cared for by [CONTACT_630908], gynecology and urology 
specialties. After obtaining informed consent, women will be randomized to either 
yoga & meditation + Standard of care compared to Standard of care alone. Masking is 
not possible with this study design, as participants randomized to the 
yoga/mindfulness versus standard of care will clearly know their treatment arm. 
4. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
4.1 We will recruit patients who present with IC/BPS per the AUA definition. To 
confirm the diagnosis of IC/PBS,.We will also administer the O’Leary-Sant 
Interstitial cystitis Symptom Index and Problem Index to determine if patients are 
candidates for the study. We will also require that they have a physical exam 
performed in the past 2 years.  As documented by [CONTACT_2312], a domain score of >6 will 
indicate applicability for enrollment in either symptom or problem domainxi. 
Additional inclusion criterion include: evidence of an absent UTI (e.g. negative urine 
PROTOCOL TITLE: MYPAICE: Mindfulness and Yoga for Pain with Interstitial 
Cystitis Evaluation
Page 8 of 32dipstick, a negative urinalysis or urine culture) within [ADDRESS_841825]: 
unevaluated hematuria, 
a history of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), as defined by [CONTACT_630909] 
>[ADDRESS_841826] 5 years,
 urinary retention, defined  as a post-void residual (PVR) of >150 mL confirmed 
by [CONTACT_630910], 
a history of augmentation cystoplasty or urinary diversion, 
a history of cyclosporine A use
a history of pelvic radiation or chemotherapy in the past 2 years 
history of radiation induced cystitis
if patients are currently pregnant or lactating or planning on becoming pregnant in 
the next 3-4 months
have demonstrated Hunner’s ulcers on cystoscopy, treated or untreated by 
[CONTACT_630911], within the last 6 months
As our intervention requires Smartphone utilization and video usage, we will be 
excluding patients whose hearing or vision would interfere with ability to use the 
yoga video or meditation app.  
Neurogenic bladder (e.g. secondary to CVA with residual deficits, Multiple 
Sclerosis, Parkinsonism)
Severe mobility impairment or physical conditions that would interfere with their 
ability to perform yoga as they would be unable to perform certain Yoga postures. 
Inability to speak/understand English or Spanish
Inability to perform study follow up
4.2 Main inclusion criteria is as follows: 
Female subjects≥18 years old
PROTOCOL TITLE: MYPAICE: Mindfulness and Yoga for Pain with Interstitial 
Cystitis Evaluation
Page 9 of 32IC/BPS clinical diagnosis, which requires >6 weeks of symptoms 
consistent with IC/BPS and lack of other bladder pathology (such 
as radiation exposure, active urinary tract infection, pelvic trauma, 
etc.) that would explain symptoms 
English or Spanish reading/writing
Own a Smartphone to be able to watch an online video or use 
Smartphone meditation app. 
Ability/willingness to participate in follow up questionnaires
O’Leary-Sant ICSI/ICPI >6 
4.3   As noted above: Adults unable to consent, pregnant women, and prisoners 
will not be included in this study. 
4.4  As noted above: We will include English and Spanish speaking populations 
only.  We are excluding men as we are a Urogynecology practice and therefore do 
not have access to that population, and the vast majority of sufferers from IC/BPS 
are womenxii.  Unfortunately, we do not have the ability to recruit in other 
languages beyond English and Spanish, as our primary outcome measures have 
not been validated in other languages.
5. Number of Subjects
5.1 This is a single-center study at University of New Mexico, so the total number of 
subjects at the University of New Mexico is the total number of subjects for the study.
5.2 The total number of subjects to be recruited at this site is 60-120 patients.
5.3 Sample size calculation: The primary outcome for this study is a linear mixed 
model of GRA variation over time.  Weekly GRA and O’Leary-Sant values will be 
obtained on all participants. We will then further characterize patients as either 
treatment responder or non-responders, with treatment response defined as “moderate 
(+2)” or The primary outcome for this study is a linear mixed model of GRA 
variation over time.  Weekly GRA and O’Leary-Sant values will be obtained on all 
participants. We will then further characterize patients as either treatment responder 
or non-responders, with treatment response defined as “moderate (+2)” or “marked 
(+3)” improvement on the GRA. We used previously reported outcomes from an 
RCT regarding impact of medication on ICBPS symptoms. 
Given that we will be performing a linear mixed model, we powered our study to 
detect a 30% change in treatment response between groups on the GRA, with baseline 
response rate of 26%.  We require 41 participants/group (total N=82) to obtain 80% 
power (α=0.05), assuming an effect size of 0.85. Allowing for a dropout rate of 15%, 
we aim to randomize 94 women (47/group).  We will be able to recruit the required 
number of participants. We see 12-15 new patients with ICBPS per month and should 
PROTOCOL TITLE: MYPAICE: Mindfulness and Yoga for Pain with Interstitial 
Cystitis Evaluation
Page 10 of 32be able to adequately recruit 6-7 patients/month, allowing us to meet the necessary 
sample of patients within 14 months of study initiation.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_630890]-19, we still 
continue to care for this number of patients. The study has maximized digital & 
phone contact [CONTACT_630912]-person contact. We foresee that we should meet our 
recruitment aims despi[INVESTIGATOR_630891]’s restrictions.
6. Study Timelines
6.1 Based on current clinic volume in the UNM division of the Urogynecology, from 
which we are recruiting, we estimate that recruitment of 60-120 patients will be 
feasible over approximately 2-3 years. Per chart review, the urogynecology division 
sees patients who meet criteria for this study at the rate of 10-20 per month. 
Assuming that approximately 25% of patients will agree to study participation (due to 
issues of time commitment and eligibility criteria), we believe that we will be able to 
recruit an appropriate number of patients in approximately 2-3 years. We believe that 
an additional 3 months will be needed for follow up data. We anticipate that data 
analysis and manuscript writing will take an additional 6-9 months.
7. Study Endpoints
7.1 The primary endpoint of our study is to determine the 3 month Global Response 
Assessment (GRA) in patients who perform yoga & mindfulness + Standard of care 
compared to patients who undergo Standard of Care alone,  as well as a linear mixed 
model analysis of the GRA over time. Our secondary endpoints include: (i) 
proportion of patients in each group using accelerated lines of treatment (2-6) based 
on the AUA guidelines (i) the following validated questionnaires:) ), O’Leary-Sant 
Symptom and Problem Index (OSPI/OSCI), patient self-efficacy questionnaire 
(PSEQ-2), the PROMIS- Pain Interference Short Form 6b (PROMIS-PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a visual 
analog scale,  and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56105] (HADS-A/D) (iii) Cost 
analysis potentially using, for example, the QALY scale if funds are found to support 
this.
7.[ADDRESS_841827] any primary or secondary safety endpoints for which the study 
will be powered, as the interventions are extremely low risk (mindfulness and yoga).
7.[ADDRESS_841828] any safety endpoints.
8. Research Setting
8.1 The study will be performed at the University of New Mexico (UNM) 
Eubank Women’s Primary Care Clinic and Sandoval Regional Medical 
Center (SRMC) Urogynecology clinics. These Urogynecology clinics are 
dedicated to care of women with pelvic floor disorders such as interstitial 
cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), the target population for this 
study.
PROTOCOL TITLE: MYPAICE: Mindfulness and Yoga for Pain with Interstitial 
Cystitis Evaluation
Page 11 of 328.2 Potential subjects will be recruited in the UNM Eubank and SRMC 
clinics when they present for care for IC/BPS, either in person or virtually 
via telephone or Zoom care visits. All patients will have a history and 
physical taken to determine their study eligibility, as well as a baseline 
BPIC-SS. Recruitment will take place either in private exam rooms at 
these clinics or over HIPAA-compliant telephone or Zoom conversation, 
and informed consent conversations regarding these clinics will take place 
via the same means.
8.3 There are no other laboratory tests in this trial other than would be 
routinely collected in the work up of IC/BPS.
8.[ADDRESS_841829].  
8.5 There will not be any research conducted outside of the UNM HSC 
and its affiliates. 
9. Resources Available

familiar with ethical and compliance practices. She is also a Howard 
Friedman endowed professor in OB/GYN. [CONTACT_536016] M. Jansen, a co-
investigator on this project, is the fellow who has a total of [ADDRESS_841830] the research:  The University of New 
Mexico (UNM) Urogynecology division operates at two main locations. 
UNM Eubank Urogynecology Clinic located in Northeast Albuquerque 
provides a full range of services for women with pelvic floor disorders. 
The Eubank clinic consists of 8 examination rooms, 2 treatment rooms, 
and 2 physical therapy rooms. Our second location is at Sandoval 
PROTOCOL TITLE: MYPAICE: Mindfulness and Yoga for Pain with Interstitial 
Cystitis Evaluation
Page 12 of 32Regional Medical Center (SRMC), a community-based facility located in 
Rio Rancho, New Mexico, a large suburb located outside of Albuquerque.  
Research Staff: The Urogynecology Division employs a clinical research 
specialist as well as research coordinators. Our research staff has 
extensive experience conducting multi-center investigations and 
recruiting patients to clinical studies, with special expertise in 
community-based research and quality of life studies.
Research Experience: The Urogynecology Division at UNM has a 
strong history of conducting high quality research and collaboration with 
other investigators in the US and abroad, and has consistently met or 
exceeded recruitment goals on time. We have been members of the 
NICHD-sponsored Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN), and have 
met recruitment goals with high rates of follow-up and accurate data 
collection. In addition to PFDN research, [CONTACT_45260] has 
mentored and has been the PI [INVESTIGATOR_630895]-reviewed journals. Her Curriculum Vitae is

Our group is well versed in the importance of adherence to protocols, 
timely completion of regulatory requirements, effective recruitment 
strategies, and the importance of the inclusion of minority subjects. 
Research is integral to all aspects of Divisional work; importantly, all 
members of the clinical team participate in research efforts.  There are 
weekly research meetings to discuss the progress of the ongoing studies 
within the department, and it is an excellent forum to ensure that all 
involved are adequately informed of their duties, of the protocol, and of 
the procedures. 
We do not anticipate that emergency care will be needed for this study; the 
urogynecology physicians are available on a [ADDRESS_841831] with 
extensive background in making online yoga tutorials. She is designing this yoga 
sequence for our study (see supplemental materials). This study was presented to 
[CONTACT_630930] for approval, and the signed Departmental Review Form can be 
found in the “Supporting Documents” Section.  
This study does not include ionizing radiation, biological specimens, or drugs. 
11.Multi-Site Research
 This is not a multi-site research study. 
PROTOCOL TITLE: MYPAICE: Mindfulness and Yoga for Pain with Interstitial 
Cystitis Evaluation
Page 13 of 3212.Study Procedures 
This non-blinded randomized control trial will be conducted at the UNM Eubank 
clinic and SRMC Urogynecology clinic. We will recruit participants and plan 
to randomize approximately 60-120 participants from these sites. 
Collaborating investigators will be members of the urogynecology division at 
UNM HSC. 
Our primary aim is to determine whether the participants assess themselves as 
improving following the interventions based on the GRA at 3 months. The 
target population will be patients with IC/BPS who are seeking care. The 
current recommendation is to advise patients to undergo conservative 
management with self-care, behavioral modification techniques.  If a patient is 
interested in this and fulfills study inclusion criteria then we will offer her the 
choice of volunteering for the study. All women will give consent prior to 
their enrollment, after they have had time to carefully consider whether they 
want to participate in the study. Research staff and clinicians will obtain 
consent either in clinic or via zoom. After enrollment, participants will fill out 
baseline surveys including: )the O’Leary-Sant Symptom and Problem Index 
(OSPI/OSCI)Patient Self Efficacy Questionnaire-2 (PSEQ-2), Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70505] (HADS-A/D), PROMIS- Pain Interference 
Short Form 6B ( PROMIS-PI), and a visual analog scale
In addition to the above outcomes, we will collect patient demographics, 
medical/surgical history and information regarding their IC/BPS (e.g. time 
since IC/BPS diagnosis, previous treatments for IC/BPS tried) and patient 
contact [CONTACT_3031]. Once this information is collected, patients will also fill 
out an attestation of use, which they will sign/e-sign in REDCap, an affidavit 
that if they are randomized to mind/body they will use these daily to the best 
of their ability. 
Randomization: Randomization assignment will be generated by [CONTACT_630913] a 
statistician.  Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio by a computer 
generated sequence at enrollment. Randomization assignments will be 
completed via REDCAP.   Randomization will only occur after consent has 
been obtained and all baseline data has been obtained.
Interventions:
Yoga & mindfulness meditation + Standard of care: Women will be asked to 
perform mindfulness meditation via a commercially available smartphone app 
and yoga through an online video tutorial (designed by a Physical Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_630896]/BPS care and designed specifically for IC/BPS patients). Our 
online tutorial is currently in the process of being formatted however see 
supplemental materials for yoga flow.  Patients will be instructed to perform 
PROTOCOL TITLE: MYPAICE: Mindfulness and Yoga for Pain with Interstitial 
Cystitis Evaluation
Page 14 of 32approximately 10 minutes of meditation daily via a commercially available 
app (either Calm App or Headspace App, both of which are commercially 
readily available) and approximately 15 minutes of yoga via the online 
tutorial. Yoga & use of the meditation app is estimated to take approximately 
[ADDRESS_841832] Line AUA 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_630897] (Table 1). Patients will 
be called weekly to ascertain treatment compliance and monitor their 
progress. If symptoms are not improving there will be the option to discuss 
other treatment options (e.g. accelerate to higher lines of therapy based on 
AUA guidelines) at [ADDRESS_841833] Line 
and 2nd Line treatments (excluding use of the online yoga and meditation app). 
Patients will also be called weekly to monitor progress and to ensure no 
treatment effect secondary to phone calls. If symptoms are not improving 
there will be the option to discuss other treatment options (e.g. accelerate to 
higher lines of therapy based on AUA guidelines) at [ADDRESS_841834] of care group will receive 3 
months of Calm App. 
At the 6 week follow-up phone call patients will be given the option for escalation 
of therapy. Patients will be given the opportunity to escalate their treatment 
for IC/PBS to higher lines of treatments: use of intravesical Botox or use of 
sacral neuromodulation. We will record any accelerated therapy used by [CONTACT_630914]. 
For participants who have completed the study but treatment escalation data was 
not properly captured in RedCap surveys, These participants will be notified 
via email through RedCap to complete this additional survey.
Outcome measures: 
GRA: The Global Response Assessment is a validated tool to assess response to 
treatment. It is comprised of a single question and has been utilized widely in 
IC/BPSxiii. This will be collected weekly. However, the primary outcome is 
the 12 week (3 month) result. 
THERAPY ESCALATION:  We will record when and what women use that is 
greater than 1st line and 2nd line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_630898]. They will discuss escalation of therapy with their provider and study 
personnel will record the additional therapy as an outcome measure. This will 
be utilized to perform cost utility analysis to determine if the intervention is 
cost-effective. 
PSEQ-2:  The Patient Self-Efficacy Questionnaire Short Form is a 2 question 
questionnaire that has been used in multiple chronic pain conditions to 
PROTOCOL TITLE: MYPAICE: Mindfulness and Yoga for Pain with Interstitial 
Cystitis Evaluation
Page 15 of 32document feelings of self-efficacy. The Short form is validated in chronic 
pelvic painxiv.  This will be collected at baseline and at 12 weeks. 
PROMIS-PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_630899]-Pain interference short form 6B is an NIH PROMIS 
measure that measures the extent that pain interferes with daily activities. It is 
comprised of 6 questionsxv.  This measure will be collected weekly. 
HADS: This is formally called Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198442]/Depression Scale.  This is a 7 
item inventory that assesses generalized anxiety including: tension, worry, 
fear, difficulty relaxing and restlessnessxvi. This measure will be collected at 
baseline and at 12 weeks. 
Euroqol-5d. (EQ-5d) This is a validated measure utilized to measure health statesxvii. 
O’Leary-Sant Interstitial Cystitis Symptom and Problem Index: 
This validated survey assesses severity of symptoms and bother in IC/BPS 
and is commonly used for IC/BPS trials. Symptom index, which has been 
explicitly analyzed in a prospective trial to detect change, and problem 
index are to be separately analyzedxviii
Data Analysis
Data Analysis: Between and within group differences will be evaluated using 
chi-square analysis as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_630915] (e.g. Fisher’s Exact test for non-normal distributions of categorical 
variables and T-test for continuous variables). Differences between groups will be 
evaluated using Chi-square analyses for categorical variables as deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_630916] (e.g. Fisher’s Exact test 
for non-normal distributions). T-tests will be utilized for continuous variables, 
with comparison by [CONTACT_32026] U for non-normal distributions. Within-group 
differences over time will be analyzed using the McNemar’s test.  If any baseline 
differences exist between the groups, a regression or multivariable analysis will 
determine the contribution of these differences to observed differences between 
groups. As the GRA and O’Leary-Sant will be collected more frequently, we plan 
to analyze these results with linear mixed models analysis.  
Power Analysis: Power analysis was performed based on previously reported 
means and standard deviation from treatment effect based on GRA  We assumed 
that 41 patients in each arm (total 82) would be required to find a difference of 
30% between group’s pain scores (the primary outcome) with 80% power and 
alpha of 0.05. In order to achieve power we will need a total of 82 patients. 
Assuming an approximate 20-25% dropout or loss to follow-up rate, we will plan 
to randomize approximately 60-120 patients.

treatments. Theoretically, there could be increased muscle soreness noted 
in patients in yoga treatment arm. There are no documented adverse events 
with mindfulness practice.
We will track adverse events when patients bring up these events during 
the course of the study with their providers or study coordinators. Because 
neither of the studied treatments are experimental or associated with above 
average risk, we do not anticipate any serious adverse events; nonetheless, 
these will be tracked. Participants will have access to a 24/[ADDRESS_841836] is not following the study protocol. If a woman is 
withdrawn from the study either at her own discretion or that of the research staff, 
she may continue with conservative or surgical management of her IC/BPS in the 
usual fashion. We will collect a withdrawal Global Response Assessment to use 
for her progress and will utilize her data up until the time point that she is 
withdrawn from the study. 
To minimize withdrawal from the study, patients will be randomized after they 
have had what they feel to have been adequate time to consider whether or not 
they would like to participate in the study and they provide consent. We will 
document reasons for withdrawal from the study if the participant willingly 
provides this information. We will report eligibility criteria not met or reasons for 
declining participation in the study if the participant willingly provides this 
information. The withdrawal procedure is clearly documented in the study 
consent.
15.Data Management/Confidentiality

Page [ADDRESS_841837] protected, and stored on the secure UNM OBGYN department server. 
This server’s electronic security is monitored / maintained by [CONTACT_630917] (HSLIC). A REDCAP database will be created to 
collect, store and manage the data. REDCAP databases are reposed securely and 
all data entered is de-identified. The REDCAP database is only accessible using 
an individual unique login and password and access is only provided to co-
investigators.  Access is restricted to co-investigators and research staff and will 
be protected using the unique REDCAP login and password provided to each co-
investigator.
Access to the files and REDCAP will be restricted to research personnel and 
Investigators and will be locked or protected using the unique REDCAP login and 
password provided to each co-investigator. The data will be stored for [ADDRESS_841838]’s name 
[CONTACT_630928] a password protected computer on a secure UNM OBGYN 
department server. In order to further ensure patient confidentiality, the 
identifying information will be kept separately from the numbered study files in a 
locked cabinet. The data will be maintained for 5 years after completion of the 
study and then destroyed.

Page [ADDRESS_841839] (yoga and 
mindfulness).  Yoga therapy is associated with low risks, such as muscle 
discomfort or strain though this is rare.  Emotional discomfort due to the 
reflective nature of this therapy is also possible. Both treatment randomizations in 
this study are well established as options for IC/BPS with an excellent safety 
profile.
Pregnant women will not be included in the study, so there is no risk to 
embryos/fetuses. Participants will need to have a negative urine pregnancy test in 
the last [ADDRESS_841840] line treatment of their IC/PBS and 
potential use of over the counter medications. Participation in this study may help to 
improve an individual participant’s condition, but it is also possible that the condition 
may not improve. There is no guarantee that any individual will personally benefit by 
[CONTACT_422221]. Women assigned to the yoga and meditation group 
will also receive 1) a video that will instruct them on use of yoga that may help with 
IC/BPS symptoms (designed by a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_630900]/BPS 
patients) and 2) a meditation app. that will be provided to the patient for approximately 3 
months (the study will pay for it for that length of time). Participation in this study may 
provide information that may help other people who have a similar medical problem in 
the future. The literature supports improvement of QOL in similar conditions such as 
endometriosis or primary dysmenorrhea. 
19.Recruitment Methods
The Urogynecology clinics at UNM Eubank, and SRMC have a large referral 
population of patients with pelvic floor conditions such as IC/BPS. Subjects will 
be identified in the clinics at UNM Eubank clinic and SRMC by [CONTACT_630918]: MYPAICE: Mindfulness and Yoga for Pain with Interstitial 
Cystitis Evaluation
Page 19 of 32when thy present either in person or virtually (telephone or Zoom visits) for visits 
for IC/BPS care. The patients will be counseled about possible treatment options 
for IC/BPS and they will be introduced to the study and provided with written 
information that may help them decide if participation in the study is right for 
them. Subjects are encouraged to consult with family, friends, and primary health 
care providers, as well as communicate any questions they may have before 
beginning the written consent process. We will request a waiver of HIPAA 
authorization for recruitment purposes.  
If a woman declines to participate or is withdrawn from the study either by [CONTACT_630919], she will be offered the same treatment options. 
Her follow up appointments will be the same regardless of participation in the 
study.
Potential participants may also self-identify through a recruitment material flyer that will 
be placed in Eubank clinic restrooms, waiting area and in the OB/GYN department at 
UNM. The proposed recruitment flyer is uploaded in the supplemental materials section. 
We will also plan to recruit using social media and at IC/BPS support groups, and over 
the radio. The proposed wording is included in the website advertisement in the 
supplemental materials section. 
20.Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects
Privacy concerns are taken into account with every patient seen at the UNM and 
SRMC clinics. Participants approached and/or interviewed in the clinic setting 
will be in either private offices or examination rooms in the clinics, personal 
Zoom or on telephone calls that are HIPAA compliant. All staff, including 
research staff, are well-versed in sensitive health care discussions and procedures. 
Telephone interviews for recruitment and study data gathering are conducted in 
the research staff area or private physician offices, where all staff have received 
CITI Training.  The office area designated for the entire Urogynecology research 
staff is isolated from the clinical administrative staff area, providing protection for 
participants and potential participants during screening, recruitment, study-
designated calls, and data entry. All study sheets used to collect patient 
information will be de-identified. 
At all times throughout the clinical investigation, confidentiality will be observed by [CONTACT_630920]. All data will be secured against unauthorized access. Privacy and 
confidentiality of information about each subject will be preserved in study reports and in 
any publication. Each subject participating in this study will be assigned a unique 
identifier. An IRB-approved HIPAA authorization within the consent is required to be 
given to the patient. All documents containing personal health information (screening 
logs, consent documents, data forms) are maintained in locked cabinets with access 
available only to research staff and investigators. Data is entered into a password 
protected system. No individual identifiers are entered into the system. The sole link with 
personal information is maintained by [CONTACT_32089] a password protected 
computer on a secure UNM OBGYN department server with access limited to authorized 
research staff and investigators. This information is only to be used at the study center.

The patient will receive the following compensation: For completion of the study, each 
patient will be compensated with a merchant card worth $60 total. They will receive a 
$[ADDRESS_841843] at their initial study visit (enrollment) and $[ADDRESS_841844] at 
their 3-month follow-up visit. This payment is reasonable compensation for the 
inconvenience of participating in a research study due to the additional time the study 
questionnaires will require from the participant. Participants will receive access to the 
meditation app and yoga video (if in the mindfulness/intervention arm) and both groups 
will receive close follow-up and attention from the research staff.  At the end of the study 
women in the standard care group will receive a 3 month subscription to the Calm App. 
23.Compensation for Research-Related Injury
If participants are injured or become sick as a result of this study, which is extremely 
unlikely given the nature of the interventions, UNMHSC will provide emergency 
treatment at the study participant’s cost. No commitment is made by [CONTACT_630921]. Reimbursement for treatment for all related costs of care will be 
sought from the participant insurer, managed care plan, or other benefits program. The 
participant will be responsible for any associated co-payments or deductibles required by 
[CONTACT_60737]. Participants will be encouraged to report any illness or injury they believe 
to be related to the study to the investigator or research staff. Participants will be given

document, and reviewed during the informed consent process.
24. Consent Process
Patients will be approached about the research study at the Urogynecology clinic or 
via virtual consultation at UNM Eubank or SRMC during a discussion for the 
management of IC/PBS. Each patient undergoes counseling in a private room with a 
closed door to ensure privacy. The physicians in the Urogynecology division and 
research staff will be able to given consent letter to patients to allow for inclusion. 
Our division routinely treats this condition and are highly qualified to counsel 
patients regarding the risks, benefits, alternatives for the treatment. Care will not be 
withheld if they decide not to participate. If the patient prefers, she may also be 
counseled about study participation via ZOOM or phone following her clinic 
appointment by [CONTACT_630923]. 
The patients who would like to participate in the study will be given the consent 
letter. Given low risk intervention nature of this trial and the often virtual nature due 
to the pandemic a consent letter will be utilized instead of a consent form requiring 
participant’s signature. By [CONTACT_630924]. 
Participants will have these multiple opportunities to ask any questions and they 
will also be provided with the clinic’s contact [CONTACT_630925]. 
Subjects will be reassured that participation is completely voluntary and does not 
affect their treatment, their relationship with their providers, or the university to 
minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.  The patients will be asked 
that they understand the opportunity to participate and their complete freedom to 
decline.  This will also be asked if they understand and if they have any questions.  
There is no minimum time period needed between informing the patient of the 
study and time of consent.  Subjects will be encouraged to take as much time as 
they need. 
This study will obtain HIPAA authorization prior to enrollment. HIPAA 
authorization will be reviewed with all participants by [CONTACT_630926]. Specific information that will be obtained includes prior 
medical history, surgical history, reproductive health history including child 
bearing, drug allergies, age, and ethnicity. This information will obtained by [CONTACT_516097], not research coordinators, as deemed necessary for a more complete 
and accurate medical history of the patient.
Subjects not fluent in English:
PROTOCOL TITLE: MYPAICE: Mindfulness and Yoga for Pain with Interstitial 
Cystitis Evaluation
Page 22 of 32Patients will be consented with a certified translator if Spanish speaking. Spanish-
speaking patients will be offered information about risks, benefits, and 
alternatives to study participation in a private setting and given adequate time to 
consider the risks and benefits of the study prior to offering consent or declining 
to participate.  Yoga tutorial and Calm App is available in Spanish for patients.  
The Spanish consent will be translated from the English consent once the English 
consent is approved, and we will submit a modification in Huron IRB to update 
the study with Spanish materials in the future.

We do not intend to share study test or procedure results with study participants, but as 
all of their data collected is subjective and directly from them, they will be aware of all 
the data/information in the study regarding them. Additionally, we do not anticipate that 
the research being conducted will result in incidental findings. Every patient will receive 
the practice’s standard of care regarding workup of IC/PBS, which may include different 
laboratory tests, urine culture, cystoscopy or urodynamic testing if unclear cause of pain, 
or imaging studies, as determined by [CONTACT_94037]. These results are 
not directly a part of the research being conducted and will hence be disclosed to the

35.Partial Waiver of Consent for Screening/Recruitment
Complete this checklist if you are requesting a partial waiver of consent so that you can review 
private information to identify potential subjects and/or determine eligibility prior to 
approaching potential subjects for consent or parental permission.
We are requesting a partial waiver of consent for screening and recruitment purposes.
A. Describe the data source that you need to review (e.g., medical records):
We would review medical records to ensure that patients have a diagnosis of 
IC/BPS and not an alternative diagnosis (such as recurrent UTI) that would 
make them ineligible for the study.
B. Describe the purpose for the review (e.g., screening):
We would need to review records for screening purposes to ensure that the 
patients meet eligibility criteria.
C. Describe who will conducting the reviews (e.g., investigators, research staff):
The reviews of the medical records will be by [CONTACT_630927]’ clinical visits, so that recruitment can be optimized.
D. Do all persons who will be conducting the reviews already have permitted access to the 
data source?
       Yes
             No. Explain:      
i.Verify that each of the following are true or provide an alternate 
justification for the underlined regulatory criteria:
1.The activity involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects 
because the records review itself is non-invasive and the results of the 
records review will not be used for any purposes other than those 
described above.
 True
 Other justification:      
2. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and 
welfare of the subjects because eligible subjects will be approached for 
consent to participate in the research and are free to decline.  Further, 
the information accessed during the records review will not be 
PROTOCOL TITLE: MYPAICE: Mindfulness and Yoga for Pain with Interstitial Cystitis

Page 26 of 32disclosed to anyone without a legitimate purpose (e.g., verification of 
eligibility).
 True
 Other justification:      
3. The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or 
alteration because there is no other reasonably efficient and effective 
way to identify who to approach for possible participation in the 
research.  
 True
 Other justification:      
4. Whenever appropriate, potentially eligible subjects will be presented 
with information about the research and asked to consider 
participation.  (Regulatory criteria: Whenever appropriate, the 
subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after 
participation.)
 True
 Other justification:      
36.Partial Waiver of HIPAA Authorization for Screening/Recruitment
Complete the following additional questions/attestations if the records you will review to identify 
potential subjects and/or determine eligibility include Protected Health Information (PHI).
We are requesting a partial waiver of HIPAA authorization for screening/recruitment. We will 
review medical records of participants to ensure that they are eligible for the study, in particular 
to review if they have a clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS, and to ensure they don’t have an alternative 
diagnosis that would make them ineligible.
37.Waiver of Documentation of Consent
Complete this checklist if you intend to obtain consent verbally but will not be obtaining 
signatures from subjects on a consent form to document consent.  Waivers of documentation of 
consent are commonly requested when using scripts, information sheets, or email or survey 
introductions to present the elements of consent instead of using a traditional consent form.
A. Are you requesting a waiver of documentation of consent for some or all 
subjects?
X All. Explain: When patients are unable to present in person to the clinic due 
to COVID restrictions, and are having all virtual visits such as HIPAA-
compliant Zoom visits or telephone visits, they will be unable to provide 
written, documented consent.  Therefore, we request the ability to email or 
mail them a consent letter to all patients with virtual visits or hand out a 
consent letter to those in person that allows us to explain the risks and benefits 
PROTOCOL TITLE: MYPAICE: Mindfulness and Yoga for Pain with Interstitial Cystitis 
Evaluation
Page [ADDRESS_841849] 
would constitute consent.
B. Provide justification for one of the following:
i. That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the 
consent document and the principal risk would be potential harm 
resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject will be asked 
whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the 
research, and the subject's wishes will govern.
     
ii. That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to 
subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is 
normally required outside of the research context.
The minimal risk of mindfulness practice and yoga or usual care is 
such that normally, if performing these practices in everyday life, no 
informed consent would be required for these procedures.

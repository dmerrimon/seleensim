2. STUDY OBJECTIVES, ENDPOINTS AND HYPOTHESES
2.1. Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
This study is being conducted to evaluate the clinical perform ance of a marketed product. 
2.2. Endpoints 
Primary Endpoints : 
xCLUE overall comfort 
xCLUE overall vision 
Subjective overall comfort and vision will be assessed using Contact [CONTACT_169754] (CLUE) questionnaire at the two-week follo w-up. CLUE is a validated patient-reported 
outcomes questionnaire to  assess patient-experience attributes  of soft, disposable contact 
[CONTACT_13276] (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal 
distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more 
favorable/positive response. A 5-point increase in an average CLUE score translates into 10% shift in the distribution of scores for populati on of soft disposable contact [CONTACT_19554].
5
Other Exploratory Endpoint(s):Subjective responses concentrat ed on other aspects of vision, comfort, and/or handling. 
2.3. Hypotheses
No statistical hypotheses will be  tested. All study endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_84814].   
3. TARGETED STUDY POPULATION

5. TEST ARTICLE ALLOCATION AND MASKING
5.1. Test Article Allocation 
Use of the study article will be non-randomized.  All subjects will  receive the same study lens 
on both eyes. 
The following must have occurred prior to lens fitting: 
ͻInformed consent must have been obtained. 
ͻThe subject must have met all eligibility criteria.
ͻThe subject’s screening and baseline info rmation must have been collected.
When dispensing test articles, the following steps should be followed: 
1. Investigator or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) will consult the lens 
fitting schedule to obtain the test article assignment for that subject prior to dispensing. 
2. Investigator or designee will record the subject’s number on the appropriate line of the 
lens fitting schedule. 
3. Investigator or designee will pull the appr opriate test articles from the study supply. 
All test articles that are opened, whether dispensed (placed/fit on eye or dispensed 
outside the clinical site) or not, must be recorded on the Test Article Accountability 
Log in the “Dispensed” section. 
5.2. Masking
This is a single-masked trial. All subjects will be assigned to the same study lenses in this single arm study. Subjects will be unaware of the identity of the study lenses.  Investigators 
and clinical site personnel invol ved in the data collection will not be masked as to the identity 
of the study lenses.  
5.3. Procedures for Maintainin g and Breaking the Masking
The identity of the study lenses will be masked to the subjects by [CONTACT_703881]. The label will contain the study  number, lot number, sphere power, expi[INVESTIGATOR_703860].  
Under normal circumstances, the mask should not be broken until all subj ects have completed 
the study and the database is finalized. Otherwise, the mask s hould be broken only if specific 
emergency treatment/course of ac tion would be dictated by [CONTACT_35496]. In such cases, the investigator may, in  an emergency, contact [CONTACT_7195]. In 
the event the mask is broken, the sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, time, 
and reason for the unmasking must be documented in the subject record. 
Subjects who have had their tr eatment assignment unmasked are expected to return for all 
remaining scheduled evaluations. Subjects who are discontinued will be replaced.

6.3. Administration of Test Articles
Study articles will be disp ensed to subjects meeting all eligibility requirements, including any 
dispensing requirements set forth in this clinical protocol. Subjects will be dispensed an 
adequate supply of test  articles to complete the study.  Lost or damaged test articles may be
replaced at the discretion of the investigator and/or the sponsor.   
6.4. Packaging and Labeling
The study articles will be packaged in blisters as the primary packaging. The study article will 
be over-labeled to mask the identity of the lens .  The study articles will be in plastic bags as 
the secondary packaging form.  The sample study label is shown below. The information 
represented on the label below is sample information only and is not representative of the actual study lens information. 
Primary Packaging Secondary Packaging
6.5. Storage Conditions 
Test articles will be maintained at ambient temperatures at the clinical site. Test articles must be kept under secure conditions. 
6.6. Collection and St orage of Samples 
No samples will be collected as  part of the study procedures. 
When possible, any lens or test article associated with an Adverse Event and/or a Product Quality Complaint must be retained and stored in a glass vial with moderate solution pending directions from the sponsor for potential return to JJVC. 
6.7. Accountability of Test Articles
JJVC will provide the Investigator with suffici ent quantities of study ar ticles and supplies to 
complete the investigation. The I nvestigator is asked to retain all lens shipment documentation 
for the test article accountability records. 
CR-6483, v 3.0  
Page 22 of 129JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
Test articles must be ke pt in a locked storage cabinet, accessible only to those assigned by [CONTACT_35500]. The Investigator may delegate this activity to  authorized study site 
personnel listed on the Site Dele gation Log. All test articles mu st be accounted. This includes:
1. What was dispensed for the subject for trial fitting, to wear out of the office, or issued 
for the subject to replace appropriately between visits.  
2. What was returned to the Investigator  unused, including expi[INVESTIGATOR_93785].
3. The number and reason for unplanned replacements. 
The Investigator will collect all unused test article s from the subjects at the end of the subject’s 
participation. Subject returned unused test articles must be se parated from the clinical study 
inventory of un-dispensed test articles and must be labeled with the subject number and date 
of return. Following final reconciliation of test articles by [CONTACT_2037], the Investigator or 
monitor will return all unus ed test articles to JJVC .
If there is a discrepancy between the shipment  documents and the contents, contact [CONTACT_35501] .

JJVC reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason. Additionally, the 
IEC/IRB reserves the right to terminate the study if an unreasonable risk is determined. The 
study can be terminated by [CONTACT_35511], if in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a discussion with JJVC, it is determined 
that it would be unwise to continue at the clinical site.
JJVC (and the IEC/IRB and DMC, if applicable) will evaluate all adverse events. If it is 
determined that an adverse event presents an unr easonable risk, the investigation, or that part 
of the investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated as soon as possible. 
Should the study be terminated (either prematurely or as scheduled), the Investigator will notify the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority as  required by [CONTACT_35512]. 
12. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) refers to any written, electronic, or oral communication 
that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety,effectiveness or performance of test articles after they have been released for clinical trial use.  
Potential complaints may come from a variety of sources including but not limited to subjects, 
clinical research associates (CRA), clinical  operations managers (COM), medical monitors, 
and site personnel, etc. The following are not considered product quality complaints: 
xSubject satisfaction inquiries reported vi a “Subjective Questionna ires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO).” 
xClinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged after receipt at the investigational site.
xLens replacements that occur due to drops/fall-outs. 
xDamage deemed by [CONTACT_35513], 
and not indicative of a quality deficiency (i.e. tears, rips, etc.), only in situations where there is no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_423]. 
Within [ADDRESS_986998] be 
recorded in the EDC system, which will trigger an automatic email notification to the appropriate COM/CRA and Clinical QA representative. In cases where the EDC system in use is not configured to send automatic notificati ons or when an EDC system is not used, the 
COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery that a PQC has occurred.   
Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/ CRA will contact [CONTACT_19568]: 
xDate the complaint was received/recorde d in the EDC System (Date of Sponsor 
Awareness). 
xWho received the complaint. 
CR-6483, v 3.0  
Page 39 of 129JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xStudy number. 
xClinical site information (contact [CONTACT_2300], site ID, telephone number). 
xLot number(s). 
xUnique Subject Identifier(s). 
xIndication of who first observed co mplaint (site personnel or subject). 
xOD/OS indication, along with whet her the lens was inserted. 
xAny related AE number if applicable. 
xDetailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled visit, wear time, symptoms, 
resolution of symptoms, etc.). 
xEye Care Provider objective (slit lamp) findings if applicable. 
xConfirmation of product availa bility for return (and tracking information, if available), 
or rationale if product is not available for return (R efer to Form Control No. 
for test article return instructions).
Once a complaint is received, it will be assessed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA, or trained site personnel to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Seri ous Adverse Event (AE/SAE). If the complaint 
results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or traine d site personnel will follo w Section 13 of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was potentially the result of a product quality related deficiency, these procedures also applies and will be executed in parallel.  
In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514]. In this event, the 
PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Bla nk” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must be 
documented. 
13. ADVERSE EVENTS
13.1. Definitions and Classifications 
Adverse Event (AE) – An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users 
or other persons, whether or not related to the investig ational medical device.”  
Note : This definition includes events related to  the investigational medical device or the 
comparator, and to the procedures involved. Fo r users or other persons, this definition is 
restricted to events related to investigational medical devices.1
An AE includes any condition (including a pre-existing condition) that: 
1. Was not present prior to the study, but app eared or reappeared following initiation of 
the study. 
2. Was present prior to the study but worsen ed during the study. This would include any 
condition resulting from concomita nt illnesses, reactions to  concomitant medications, 
or progression of disease states.

investigational medical device.” 
Note 1: This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, deployment, implantati on, installation, or opera tion, or any malfunction 
of the investigational medical device.
Note 2: This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse 
of the investigational medical device.[ADDRESS_987000] (UADE) – A UADE is any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the test 
article, if that effect, problem,  or death was not previously id entified in nature , severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan, Investigator’s Brochure or protocol, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with the test article that relates to the rights, safety and welfare of subjects.
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Investigator will evaluate adverse events to ensure the events are categorized correctly. Elements of categorization will include: 
CR-6483, v 3.0  
Page 42 of 129JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xSeriousness/Classifications (s ee definition in Section 13.1). 
xCausality or Relatedness – i.e., the relationship between the test article, study treatment 
or study procedures and the adverse event (not related, unlikely related, possibly 
related, or related - see definition in Section 13.2.1). 
xAdverse Event Severity – Adverse event severity is used to assess the degree of intensity of the adverse event (mild, moderate, or severe - see definition in Section13.2.2). 
xOutcome – not recovered or not resolved , recovering or resolving, recovered or 
resolved with sequelae, recovered or resolved, death related to adverse event, orunknown. 
xActions Taken – none, temporar ily discontinued, permanently  discontinued, or other. 
13.2.1. Causality Assessment
Causality Assessment – A determination of the relationship between an adverse event and the 
test article. The test article relationship for each adverse event should be determined by [CONTACT_19575]: 
xNot Related- An adverse event that is not re lated to the use of the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures. 
xUnlikely Related – An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatme nt, concomitant disease(s), or the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal relationship is not likely. 
xPossibly Related – An adverse event that might be  due to the use of the test article, or 
to the study treatment or study procedures. An alternative explanation, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable. Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded. 
xRelated – An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (device) or adverse reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably e xplained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g. 
concomitant treatment of concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very suggestive, e.g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]-challenge and re-challenge. 
13.2.2. Severity Assessment
Severity Assessment – A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adverse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of  test article, study tr eatment or study procedure relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be eval uated according to the following scale: 
xMild – Event is noticeable to the subject but is easily tolerated and does not interfere with the subject’s daily activities.
xModerate – Event is bothersome, possibl e requiring additiona l therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.
xSevere – Event is intolerable, necessitates additional ther apy or alterati on of therapy 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.

[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
13.3. Documentation and Follow-Up of Adverse Events
The recording and documenting of adverse even ts (ocular and non-ocular) begin when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study treatment or study proce dure. Adverse events 
reported before the use of test  article, start of st udy treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the c ondition deteriorates at any time during the study 
it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medical events reported after the subject’s 
exit from the study will be recorded as adverse ev ents at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal In vestigator will document the condition in the 
subject record and in the eCRFs and complete the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Complete descriptions of all adverse events must be available in the subject record. All 
Adverse Events including local and systemic re actions not meeting the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the appropriate case report form or electronic data system. All adverse events occurring while the subject  is enrolled in the study must be documented 
appropriately regardle ss of relationship.   
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain documentation of each reported adverse event. All adverse events will be followed in accordance with applicable licensing requirements. Such 
documentation will include the following: 
xAdverse event (diagnosis not symptom). 
xDrawings or photographs (where appropri ate) that detail the finding (e.g., size,
location, and depth, etc.). 
xDate the clinical site was notified.
xDate and time of onset.
xDate and time of resolution.
xAdverse event classification, se verity, and relationship to te st articles, as applicable. 
xTreatment regimen instituted (where appropriate), including concomitant medications prescribed, in accordance with applicable licensing requirements. 
xAny referral to another hea lth care provider if needed. 
xOutcome, ocular damage (if any). 
xLikely etiology. 
xBest corrected visual acuity at the discovery of the ev ent and upon conclusion of the 
event, if the AE is related to the visual system.
Upon discovery of an AE that is deemed ‘possibly related’ or ‘related’ to the test article or 
study procedures (whether related to the visual  system or not), an AE review form ( ) 
must be completed. Additiona l dated and initialed entries should be made at follow-up 
evaluations. Separate forms must be completed for each eye if the AE is bilateral. 
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she  will complete the Corn eal Infiltrate Assessment 
eCRF. Where necessary, a culture of the corneal lesion will be collected to determine if the 
CR-6483, v 3.0

Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
infection is microbial in nature. If cultures are collected, the date of culture collection and 
laboratory utilized will be recorded.  
Changes in the severity of an AE shall be documented to allo w an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the assessment of relationship to the Test Ar ticle shall also be clearly documented.
Subjects who present with an adverse event sh all be followed by [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have retu rned to pre-treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved. If further treatme nt beyond licensure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provider. The Investigator will use his/her clinical judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an adverse event will continue in the study. If a subject is discontinued from the study, it will be  the responsibility of the Investigator to 
record the reason for discontinuation. The Inves tigator will also document the adverse event 
appropriately and complete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjects with ongoing adverse events related to the test artic le, study treatment or study procedur es, as of the final study visit 
date, should be followed to resolution of the adve rse event or until referral to an appropriate 
health care provider, as recommended by [CONTACT_737]. Non-ocular adverse events that are not related to the test artic le, study treatment, or study proc edures may be recorded as 
“ongoing” without further follow-up. 
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events 
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by e-mail, facsimile, or telephone 
as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery for any serious /significant 
adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non-significant adverse event. In addition, a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_35451]/IRB according to their requirements (Section 13.4.2) . The report will comment whether the adverse event was 
considered to be related to the test article, study tr eatment or study procedures. 
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor 
Serious/Significant Adverse Events
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of a ll serious/significant adve rse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possible by e- mail or telephone, but no  later than [ADDRESS_987001] igator is obligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_35519]. All 
subjects experiencing a serious/s ignificant adverse event must be  followed up and all outcomes 
must be reported. 
When medically necessary, the Investigator ma y break the randomizati on code to determine 
the identity of the treatment that the subject received. The Sponsor and study monitor should 
be notified prior to unmas king the test articles. 
In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Investigator must: 
CR-6483, v 3.0  
Page 45 of 129JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xNotify the Sponsor immediately.
xObtain and maintain in the subject’s records all pertinent medical information and 
medical judgment for colleague s who assisted in the treatment and follow-up of the 
subject.
xProvide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes a statement as to 
whether the event was or was not related to the use of the test article. 
xNotify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_35520] C/IRB reporting procedure according to 
national regulations. 
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE), the Investigatorwill submit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no later 
than [ADDRESS_987002] report the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participati ng Investigators within [ADDRESS_987003]. 
Non-Serious Adverse EventsAll non-serious adverse events, including non-seri ous adverse device effects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_35521] 2 days from discovery. 
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Resp onsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site wi ll refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19582]. 
The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events to the local health authorities according the 
written guidelines, including reporting timelines.  
13.5. Event of Special Interest
None 
13.6. Reporting of Pregnancy
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270]-report) during the study will be discontinued after the event is recorded as an Adverse Event. Once  discontinued, pregnant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitored for study related purposes. Pregnant participants are not 
discontinued from contact [CONTACT_19583], but due to 
general concerns relating to pre gnancy and contact [CONTACT_19584]. Sp ecifically, pregnant women are 
discontinued due to fluctuations in refractive error and/or visual  acuity that occur secondary to 
systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unforeseen health risks to the mother or fetus.

14. STATISTICAL METHODS
14.1. General Considerations
Statistical analysis will be undertaken by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor or under the authority of the sponsor. A 
general description of the statistical methods to be  implemented in this c linical trial is outlined 
below.
All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed using the SAS software Version
9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).6Throughout the analysis of data, the results for each 
subject/eye will be used when available for summarization and statistical analysis. Unscheduled visits will be  summarized separately.
Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for all baseline variables, efficacy variables and safety variable s as appropriate. Continuous variables will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum). Frequency count and percentage of subjects or eyes within each category will 
be provided for categorical data.
14.2. Sample Size Justification
The target is to enroll approximately 80 eligible subjects with 70 subjects to complete the study. There is no statistical hypothesis to be te sted. Targeting 70 subjects to complete the 
study will be sufficient to evaluate descriptiv e summaries of the primary endpoints and other 
observations. The data collected from this clinical trial will be utilized for sample size calculations for future clinical trials.
14.3. Analysis Populations 
Safety Population: All subjects who are administered any test ar ticle excluding subjects who drop out prior to 
administering any test article. At least one observation should be recorded. 
Per-Protocol Population:  
All subjects who successfully complete all visits and do not substantially deviate from the protocol as determined by [CONTACT_3433] e trial cohort review committee pr ior to database hard lock. 
Justification for the exclusion of subjects with protocol de viations from the per-protocol 
population set will be documen ted in a memo to file. 
14.4. Level of Statis tical Significance
Not applicable. No statistical testing will be performed.
14.5. Primary Analyses
Descriptive summary statistics (e .g., mean, median, and standard de viation) will be calculated 
for each primary endpoint by [CONTACT_11191] (baseline and follow-up). No sta tistical hypothesis will 
be tested on the primary endpoints.

Not applicable 
14.7. Other Exploratory Analysis  
All other observations will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_11191].
14.8. Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis will be performed after approximately 90% of the subjects (about 63 
subjects) complete the study. The interim an alysis will consist of subject accountability, 
demographics, and descriptive summaries for questionnaire data. The results will be reviewed 
to gain insights of the DT1 lens performance before the competitive claim study is initiated. 
The results will be communicated to the project team.
14.9. Procedure for Handling Mi ssing Data and Drop-Outs
Missing or spurious values will not be imputed. The count of mi ssing values will be included 
in the summary tables and listings. 
14.10. Procedure for Reporting Deviations from Statistical Plan 
The analysis will be conducted according to that specified in above sections. There are no known reasons for which it is planned to deviate fr om these analysis methods. If for any reason 
a change is made, the change will be documented in the study re port along with a justification 
for the change.
15. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]/ARCHIVING
15.1. Electronic Case Report Form/Data Collection
The data for this study will be captured on electronic case report forms (eCRFs) using the 
BioClinica EDC system. An authorized data orig inator will enter study data into the eCRFs 
using the EDC system. Data collected on equipm ent that is not captured in EDC will be 
formatted to the specification of the JJVC databa se manager and sent to JJVC for analysis.  
External data sources for this study include:  Not Applicable .
The clinical data will be recorded on dedicated eCRFs specifically designed to match the study procedures for each visit. Only specifically delegated staff can enter data on a CRF.  Once 
completed, the eCRFs will be reviewed for accuracy and completeness and signed by [CONTACT_737]. The sponsor or sponsor’s representa tives will be authorized to gain access to the 
subject recordation for the purposes of  monitoring and auditing the study.  
Edit checks, electronic queries, and audit trails are built into the system to ensure accurate and complete data collection. Data w ill be transmitted from the clini cal site to a secure central

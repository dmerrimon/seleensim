 4 Summary  Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can be associated with a large amount of postoperative pain.  This pain can oftentimes be severe enough to limit participation in physical therapy and ultimately delay discharge resulting in increased cost.  Several strategies have been developed in an effort to decrease postoperative pain following TKA while maintaining lower extremity strength and maximizing participation in physical therapy.  Recently, adductor canal blockade has gained popularity as it is reported to provide analgesia to the anterior knee without resulting in significant quadriceps muscle weakness.  However, few studies have carefully evaluated the impact of volume of injection of local anesthetic into the adductor canal on motor weakness or pain control.  The ability to achieve similar pain control with decreased volumes of local anesthetic would allow the surgery team to apply more local anesthetic to posterior knee structures.  Decreased volumes of local anesthetic may also be associated with a decreased risk of local anesthetic toxicity.  This study aims to carefully evaluate this relationship using a physical therapy evaluation method that relies on both motor strength and pain control.  In addition, we hope to carefully evaluate motor strength using a novel method of strength measurement in an effort to further evaluate the impact of volume of injection of local anesthetic into the adductor canal on motor strength.

 8 1. Introduction 1.1 Background Postoperative analgesia for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is incredibly important as it allows for effective physical therapy and ultimately ensures proper function of the implanted joint hardware.  Unfortunately, TKA is oftentimes associated with pain severe enough to limit participation in physical therapy which can ultimately result in prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_344292].  A number of strategies have been reported to decrease the pain associated with TKA.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_344293] a number of potential side effects including nausea, itching, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], tolerance and the potential for abuse.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_344294] (potential source of increased incidence of urinary tract infections), causes significant vasodilation with resulting hypotension and can cause bilateral lower extremity weakness that can undermine efforts at early physical therapy and rehabilitation.  Femoral nerve blockade and femoral nerve catheters have the potential to decrease pain in the anterior knee but use of this technique is limited by [CONTACT_344313].  Some groups have advocated for the substitution or addition of sciatic or obturator nerve blocks to femoral nerve blockade but this is at the expense of increased lower extremity weakness and little potential clinical benefit.1-[ADDRESS_427281] begun to evaluate the adductor canal block.  The adductor canal is located in the middle 1/[ADDRESS_427282], effort, resource utilization and potentially increased risk of infection.    The safety of CACNB technique was highlighted by a study by [CONTACT_344314] a series of 97 patients.10  Andersen et al compared a CACNB vs control in 40 patients and found that the intervention group reported decreased pain and sleep disturbances while retaining the ability to ambulate soon after surgery.11   Mudumbai et al evaluated 180 patients undergoing TKA and discovered that continuous adductor canal nerve blockade (CACNB) relative to continuous femoral nerve blockade (CFNB) resulted in greater ability to ambulate (37 m vs 6 m) on POD [ADDRESS_427283], previous research has demonstrated that 15 ml 0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_344295]

Study design This study is a prospective, single-center, randomized trial in which 60 subjects will be enrolled at the University of Wisconsin Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84059] (UWHC). These subjects must meet study eligibility criteria and be scheduled to undergo an elective total knee arthroplasty.  These subjects must also agree to undergo neuraxial anesthesia as the primary anesthetic for their surgical procedure and agree to an adductor canal block for postoperative analgesia.  Patients will be randomized to receive 5, 10 or 20 mL of 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_344296].  Strength following the block and recovery characteristics following TKA will then be evaluated including pain, strength and ability to participate in physical therapy.    4. Study population 4.[ADDRESS_427287] meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study.  1) The subject is scheduled for elective unilateral TKA 2) The subject is ≥ 18 years and ≤ 80 years; 3) The subject’s weight is between 70-120 kg; and 4) The subject’s primary anesthesia care team has planned for a neuraxial anesthetic (i.e. spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], epi[INVESTIGATOR_344297]-spi[INVESTIGATOR_196613]). 5) The patient agrees to receive an adductor canal block. 6) American Society of Anesthesiologists class 1-3   4.2 Exclusion criteria  Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the study. 1) Subject is < 18 years of age or >80 years of age; 2) Subject is non-English speaking; 3) Subject is known or believed to be pregnant; 4) Subject is a prisoner; 5) Subject has impaired decision-making capacity; per discretion of the Investigator 6) Symptomatic untreated gastroesophageal reflux or otherwise at risk for perioperative aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]; 7) Any condition for which the primary anesthesia care team deems neuraxial anesthesia inappropriate; 8) Significant pre-existing neuropathy on the operative limb; 
 11 9) Significant renal, cardiac or hepatic disease per discretion of the investigator. 10) American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4-5 11) Known hypersensitivity and/or allergies to local anesthetics 12) Chronic Opi[INVESTIGATOR_5536] (daily or almost daily use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_4976] > 3 months)  4.[ADDRESS_427288] will be returned to the clinical mode used prior to the intervention period or, if desired, a ventilator mode requested by [CONTACT_192942].  Pregnancy Patients who are known to be pregnant will be excluded from participation.   5. Trial interventions The intervention portion of this study is the randomized assignment (1:1:1) to receive 5, 10 or 20 ml of 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], incrementally injected. All studied volumes are well within the acceptable range for SSACNB. Randomization will be accomplished using an online service (www.randomizer.org) and prefilling sealed envelopes determining each subject’s intervention group.  In all other aspects, the subject will receive the standard of anesthesia care appropriate for their surgery or procedure as determined by [CONTACT_192945].  5.1 Allocation to intervention Randomization of the volume of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_344298] a sequential, pre-sealed envelope with the group assignment designated within.  Randomization will be accomplished using an online service (www.randomizer.org).  Each study subject and the anesthesia team caring for the patient in the operating room will be blinded to the study volume the patient received; however, the anesthesia provider performing the block (separate from the provider caring for the patient in the operating room) will not be blinded to the study volume injected and will have access to all monitors deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_192945].  PACU/floor nursing and physical therapy staff will be blinded to volume of injection.  The surgery team and study member responsible for pre/postoperative data collection will also be blinded to study drug volume.  
 [ADDRESS_427289] is interested in participation, they will be instructed to arrive 1 hour earlier than their scheduled surgery arrival time so that there is time for consenting, considering participation, and confirming eligibility of those who agree to participate. Patients scheduled for an arrival time at or before 8:[ADDRESS_427290] in order to confirm that they are a candidate for both spi[INVESTIGATOR_344299] (this conversation is standard care),  a research team member will conduct the consent process in the surgery or procedure holding area.  In order to ensure the candidate’s privacy and confidentiality, the cubicle’s curtain or room door will be closed.  In a tone of voice insufficient for others to overhear the conversation and in the presence of only those immediately accompanying the patient and those who are directly involved with the patient’s care, the study purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, and alternatives will then be discussed.  The written information about the study provided to the candidate at the time of their check-in will be reviewed and they will be instructed to take as much time as needed to consider participation. While any study staff member may conduct the informed consent discussion and obtain informed consent, a study physician will be available at all times for any consent-related questions. Any questions that the candidate may have will be answered.  Undue coercion will be prevented by [CONTACT_344316]. If the candidate has no further questions and would like to participate, they will be asked to sign the written informed consent document.    7. Activities and measurements  Prior to the procedure: The subject will be met in the preoperative area by a staff anesthesiologist, who interviews and examines the subject.  A full explanation of the neuraxial anesthetic and adductor canal block, including risks, benefits and alternatives, will be given and informed consent for anesthetic services obtained.  Quadriceps motor strength and adductor strength will be assessed prior to any nerve blockade.  Muscle strength will be assessed with the kiio Sensor (Kiio Inc., Madison, WI [LOCATION_003]).  The kiio sensor is a force monitoring device that provides objective measurements of patient strength (traditional measurements or Manual Muscle Testing typi[INVESTIGATOR_344300]).  To assess the subject’s quadriceps and adductor strength, the kiio sensor will be attached to the subject’s ankle or upper leg and subject will be asked to forcefully extend the leg at the knee or adduct their leg.  The kiio Sensor is not currently commercially available and is currently in the development stage (see attached Phase I progress report – APPENDIX D).  A sensory exam of the leg (temperature and pi[INVESTIGATOR_29107]) will also 
 [ADDRESS_427291]’s medical record the SF12 mental component and physical component, WOMAC and Knee Society Score, UCLA activity score, preoperative range of motion and degree of varus/valgus deformity will be collected.  These scores and procedures are standard of care for all patients undergoing a TKA.  Adductor Canal Block Procedure:  An intravenous catheter will be placed, the subject will be transported to the block room or another room appropriate for provision of regional anesthesia and the subject will be pre-medicated with midazolam and/or fentanyl as needed at the discretion of the staff anesthesiologist.    Adductor canal blockade will be performed with the assistance of ultrasound guidance following sedation with midazolam and fentanyl as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_344317].  The adductor canal will be located in a mid-thigh position.  A Stimuplex needle (B. Braun Medical Inc., Melsungen, [LOCATION_013]) will be inserted in-plane to the ultrasound probe until the tip of the needle is appropriately positioned.    Study Randomization:  Following negative aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], SSACNB volume will be randomized and subjects will receive 5, 10 or 20 ml of 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_344301]. Randomization of the volume of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_344298] a sequential, pre-sealed envelope with the group assignment designated within. All studied volumes are well within the acceptable range for SSACNB.  [ADDRESS_427292]-block placement: A sensory examination will be done 15 minutes following adductor canal block with pin prick (sharp end of tongue depressor broken in two) and alcohol swab in distribution of femoral, obturator and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.  Motor examination of quadriceps and adductor strength will also be tested 15 minutes following adductor canal blockade.     During the Surgical Procedure: Neuraxial anesthesia will be performed as normally accomplished prior to initiation of the surgical procedure.  Generally, this involves the administration of a combined-spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]-epi[INVESTIGATOR_344302] 2.5 – 3 ml 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_344303].     In the operating room and procedural suite, monitors will be applied to the subject per established American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) guidelines.  At a minimum, these include non-invasive monitoring of blood pressure by [CONTACT_344318], oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry, heart rate and rhythm by 3-lead continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) tracing, core body temperature and expi[INVESTIGATOR_344304].  Additional monitoring may be applied on a case-by-case basis as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_24694].  Ongoing sedation with midazolam, fentanyl and propofol will be provided as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_344317].   The surgical team will inject 50 ml 0.125% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 30 mg ketorolac (when deemed to be clinically appropriate) into the joint and posterior knee at the conclusion of the surgical procedure.  
 [ADDRESS_427293]-Procedure:  The patient will be visited in the PACU to assess pain, opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], nausea, duration of PACU stay, satisfaction with regional anesthesia technique and location of most severe pain. This information will be ascertained by [CONTACT_344319]’s medical record.  Many of these assessments are routinely done as standard of care at the current time. Postoperative analgesia will generally consist of scheduled toradol, scheduled Tylenol, MS Contin or Oxycontin, oxycodone PRN, and celebrex 100-[ADDRESS_427294]-operative Follow-up: The patient will be assessed on the floor for pain at rest, pain with activity, opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], nausea, pain disturbing sleep, location of most severe pain and satisfaction with regional anesthesia technique will be ascertained at [ADDRESS_427295].  Pain with be assessed using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (0-10) where [ADDRESS_427296] consultation or surgical intervention. Subjects without complaints will be given appropriate information for contact[CONTACT_344320].  Physical therapy will determine pain with physical therapy, quadriceps strength, passive flexion/extension range of motion, postoperative quadriceps strength, postoperative adductor strength, and [ADDRESS_427297] (gait velocity) at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively.  All measurements of strength will be done using the Kiio Sensor. Based on physical therapy team experience, patients are currently able to ambulate 10 meters in approximately 45 seconds on postoperative day one with 20 ml of local anesthetic injected into the adductor canal.  The physical therapy team feels that ambulation velocity is generally limited by [CONTACT_344321].  However, we do not currently know if decreasing the dose of local anesthetic injected into the adductor canal will result in improved ambulation resulting from increased strength or worsened ambulation performance secondary to increased pain.   Concomitant Medications:  Analgesic and anti-emetic requirements for block placement, intraoperatively, in PACU, at 24 hours, 48 hours and during course of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_344305]’s electronic medical record.  7.[ADDRESS_427298]’s medical records includes date of service, subject name, date of birth, medical record number, age, gender, height, weight, data pertaining to the subject’s pain, opi[INVESTIGATOR_344306].  In addition, SF12 mental component and physical component, WOMAC and Knee Society Score, UCLA activity score, preoperative range of motion and degree of varus/valgus deformity will be collected from the medical record.  
 15 All study data will be collected by a study team member on a standardized case report form (CRF) (see Appendix B) and transferred to an electronic Microsoft Excel spreadsheet suitable for export in coded format to a statistical analysis program.  Data entry into electronic format will take place on a private computer away from potential viewing by [CONTACT_105]-study personnel.  The paper and electronic data will be kept in the primary investigator’s locked office in the Department of Anesthesiology.  The computer will be pass-coded and linked to a secure Anesthesia Department server to allow access only to approved study personnel.  At the end of seven years, all identifiable data will be destroyed as required by [CONTACT_344322].  7.[ADDRESS_427299]’s clinical care team or a study physician may decide the subject should be withdrawn from the study. If a subject is withdrawn from the study for any reason the subject will then be followed according to the standard of care follow-up plan.  Study intervention will immediately stop and subject’s clinical care team and a study physician will be immediately notified if one of the following occurs: 1) The subject suffers a severe adverse perioperative outcome that precludes participation in physical therapy or measurements of motor strength or sensory examination   In the event the study method is terminated, the reason for termination will be documented on a case report form.     8. Data analysis and statistical considerations  All data will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median, inter-quartile range, and confidence intervals, as appropriate.  The data will be presented graphically (where possible) using scatter plots, profile plots, or histograms.  Data analyses will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC; version 8.2 or greater) or Minitab (Quality Plaza, State College, PA; version 13.0 or greater).  The primary analyses will consist of comparing the three study volumes of injection for superiority.  For all tests, statistical significance will be defined as a p-value less than 0.05.  ANOVA and two-sample t-test will be used to compare the data between the three groups or between any two individual groups.  Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to analyze multiple follow-up data points.  Patients with missing longitudinal data will be handled by [CONTACT_344323].  Bonferroni correction will be utilized to counteract the problem of multiple comparisons and control the familywise error rate.  
 16 8.1 Sample size determination This study is a randomized, three group (5, 10, 20 ml bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]), mixed study using the primary endpoint of ambulation or gait velocity over 10 meters ([ADDRESS_427300]) on POD 1.  The data from this preliminary study will be used to generate hypotheses for future trials.  We performed an effect size calculation based on the ratio of the hypothesized differences and the standard deviation based on our current experience.   Based on physical therapy team experience, patients are currently able to ambulate 10 meters in approximately 45 seconds on postoperative day one with 20 ml of local anesthetic injected into the adductor canal.  The physical therapy team feels that ambulation velocity is generally limited by [CONTACT_344321].  However, previous retrospective research done at our own institution demonstrated that adductor canal block patients were able to ambulate more effectively than those patients receiving a femoral nerve catheter (i.e. those with a more profound motor blockade).  We therefore hypothesize that decreasing the dose of local anesthetic delivered into the adductor canal will decrease the amount of time required to ambulate [ADDRESS_427301]'s health, welfare, or decision to be in this study.   9.[ADDRESS_427302] the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_344307].  10. Adverse events and unanticipated problems  10.1 Adverse event definitions  Adverse event (AE) An adverse event is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the SSACNB or study procedure that appears or worsens during the study or study follow-up period.  AEs may be anticipated (e.g., redness/soreness at injection site) or unanticipated (e.g., bleeding/infection/nerve damage).  Adverse event information will be collected throughout the study from informed consent through resolution of the AE and documented on the case report form or the standard follow-up questionnaire.    All AEs (anticipated and unanticipated) will be recorded on one of the study data sheets (case report form or standard questionnaire) by a study investigator or study staff.  In the event of an unanticipated AE, the primary anesthesia team caring for the subject will intervene as deemed appropriate.  These are the same provisions that would be made for any non-study case and represents standard practice.  Serious adverse event (SAE) A serious adverse event is defined as any adverse event that meets one of the following criteria: • Results in death; OR • Is life-threatening; OR • Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010]; OR • Results in significant or persistent disability or incapacity; OR • Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  Given the minimal risk associated with the use of SSACB and the study procedures, no serious adverse events (SAEs) are anticipated. If a SAE occurs, the study primary and co-primary investigators will be immediately notified and further enrollment in the study will be halted until a full explanation of the cause of the event and its relationship to the SSACB and/or study procedure is understood.  The IRB will be notified and re-initiation of study enrollment will not occur until approved by [CONTACT_1201].  Unanticipated problem (UP) An unanticipated problem is defined as an event that meets all of the following criteria: 1) Unexpected in severity, nature, or frequency given the research procedures and the characteristics of the subject population (i.e., problems that are not described in this protocol or other study documents); AND 2) Related or possible related to participation in the research; AND 3) Suggests that research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm related to the research than was previously known or recognized.  
 18  10.2 Severity assessment The severity of all adverse events will be assessed according to the following scale: • Mild = not requiring treatment or intervention • Moderate = resolved with treatment/intervention • Severe = inability to carry on normal activities and required professional medical attention  10.3 Causality assessment The Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_344308]: • Definite = AE is clearly related to the study procedures • Probable = AE is likely related to the study procedures • Possible = AE is possibly related to the study procedures • Unlikely = AE is doubtfully related to the study procedures • Unrelated = AE is clearly not related to the study procedures  Additionally, AEs will be considered “probably related” to study procedures if one of the following happens: • Fall; OR • Local anesthetic toxicity or allergy  10.1. Procedures for recording and reporting adverse events All serious adverse events that occur from the time the subject provides informed consent through and including [ADDRESS_427303]’s identifiable information to study staff who were not specified to receive such information in the protocol or IRB application.  Treat as major deviation (below) Protocol deviation A deviation is an incident involving a departure from the IRB-approved protocol in the actual conduct of the study. Deviations may result from the action of the participant, investigator, or staff. See below 
 19 Event Definition Reporting  Major deviations Deviations are considered major when the unapproved change(s) in previously approved research activities, implemented without IRB approval, may potentially adversely affect subjects’ rights, safety, welfare, or willingness to continue participation, or affect the scientific design of the study and/or the integrity of the resultant data. Treat as an Unanticipated Problem (above) Minor deviations  Deviations are considered minor when the unapproved change(s) in previously approved research activities, implemented without IRB approval, do not adversely affect subjects or the integrity of the study data. Sites are to report cumulative events to AE Coordinator at time of continuing review.  Protocol violation An incident involving an intentional deviation from the IRB-approved protocol that was not implemented in response to an emergency situation and that may impact a subject’s rights, safety, and/or welfare, makes a substantial alteration to risks to subjects, or affects the scientific design of the study and/or the integrity of the resultant data. Violations may also be repeated deviations (major or minor) of the same nature. Violations can represent serious or continuing non-compliance with the federal regulations and guidelines for ethical conduct of human subject research. Treat as an Unanticipated Problem (above) 
Protocol Exceptions A protocol exception is an IRB-approved deviation for a single subject or a small group of subjects, but is not a permanent revision to the research protocol. Protocol exceptions must be approved by [CONTACT_344324].  11. Trial safety monitoring   11.[ADDRESS_427304].  In the unlikely event that there is a safety concern, study recruitment will be halted and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), consisting of a minimum of three qualified practitioners, will be convened to evaluate the safety concern and make recommendations regarding changes to the study methods or termination of the study.

 23 Appendix D – Kiio Information Sheet  Kiio Inc. began the Phase I “WiFi-enabled hand-portable real-time force sensor to objectively assess strength” project on March 1, 2013, and concluded the project August 1, 2013. (Expenditures prior to March 1, 2013 were borne by [CONTACT_344325].) This is the final summary report for the Phase I project. Kiio successfully completed all Phase I Aims. No changes were made to the project’s goals and aims as outlined in the original Phase I Research Strategy. The overall project goal of Phase I was to refine, miniaturize, and test a clinically relevant prototype device (the kiio™) that would be able to accurately and consistently measure force over time so as to provide kinetic measurement of muscle strength, continuously tracking variability in strength over the entire range of movement to enable a complex analysis of muscle performance. Our goals for the kiio were that it should (1) provide wireless data output via proprietary software to PCs in real-time, allowing a clinician to track and interpret data as the patient generates it; (2) offer high inter-rater reliability for consistency between clinicians; (3) interface with commonly used rehabilitative equipment such as resistance cables; (4) be hand-portable, not requiring dedicated clinic space; (5) be cost effective in terms of initial investment and clinician training; and (6) be rugged enough to withstand the rigors of daily use while maintaining accuracy. Its clinical significance would be to provide a fast, objectively valid, reliable, portable and cost-effective method of strength assessment, thus eliminating a significant barrier to the implementation of evidence-based evaluation and outcome measurement in prescriptive rehabilitative exercise.  Aim 1: Develop and prototype a functional, integrated kiio to measure continuous muscle force output and translate this information to a real-time digital data stream. Kiio began with a high-level, logical engineering model of the device in block diagrams depi[INVESTIGATOR_155772] a device able to generate force readings using off-the-shelf components and proprietary software. We developed an electrical and logical design for a printed circuit board (PCB) using Computer assisted engineering software (CAE). We created protocols to test the PCB design and identify and remove errors, while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_344309]. Successive iterations eliminated design errors and added functionality, leading to a stable design. We wrote firmware (hard-coded proprietary programming) to control the microprocessor, and synchronized the WiFi transceiver and a wireless router to ensure the proper communication between the kiio and a PC, necessary to display data in real-time.

 25 Aim 2: The kiio prototype will be iteratively calibrated to ensure that it properly reads known force and can be set to ignore a tare weight. The kiio requires calibration for precision and consistency; without it, accuracy and test-retest reliability would be jeopardized. Kiio used a six step process (Figure 3) to facilitate this Aim. Ensuing successful completion of the setup steps, we tested 10 devices by [CONTACT_344326] 20 plates (one at a time) on each device. With each additional plate the weight was allowed to settle and kiio reported a static force reading to the PC where it was recorded. Cumulative readings of these weights were also taken using a commercially available load cell for comparison.  Summary of Test Results: All ten devices were initially calibrated and had tare weights set. Nine out of ten devices were accurate to within 2% (1.0 lb) on the first pass (i.e., without the need for a re-calibration or re-tare). Their average deviation from the load cell ranged from 0.11 lbs. to 0.83 lbs. with no readings deviating from expected results by [CONTACT_726] 1.0 lb. Only one device (#7E) exceeded our target tolerance, with an average under-weight of 1.18 lbs. per reading. The readings from device #7E were consistently low. Consequently, the device was re-calibrated, re-tared, and the tests were rerun and kiio #7E yielded an average deviation of 0.14 lbs. from the expected results (see Table 3). The initial readings of device #7E suggests that our technician did not properly do a full tare (step #6 above) prior to conducting tests. Table 4 – Phase I, Aim 2 outcomes Task Objective outcomes/Milestones Result 2.1 kiio will correctly measure force and transmit accurate data within the larger of either 2% absolute error or [ADDRESS_427309] attempt, and 100% of the force readings were within acceptable tolerance. 2.2 Redefine of zero point: kiio prototype will be able to accept a constant offset and thereby [CONTACT_344327], or a given tare weight. Success. A connector was hung from the device and an offset was sent from the PC to the kiio to tare the weight back to 0.0 lbs. 100% of devices were successful. This process was repeated with various connectors, ranging in weight from 0.2 lbs. to 5.1 lbs. Again, 100% of devices were successful in the tare process. 2.3 Maximum static weight: kiio device will be able to accurately register static weights from 0.0 to 100.0 lbs.  Success. The commercial load cell registered a total of 103.1 lbs (99.7% accurate, with possible variability derived from cumulative rounding error over 20 plates). [ADDRESS_427310] attempt (i.e., without a need for re-calibration). 100% of kiios met specification after recalibrating and re-taring one device (#7E).

 26 Aim 3: Verify the prototype measurements are valid and reliable over high use and extended sessions. The kiio device must be used rigorously over a high number of repetitions to ensure it maintains accuracy and reliability in order to provide valid and consistent measurements through expected durations of use. The aim contained two stages: (1) Compare the kiio to a calibrated strain gauge for consecutive cycles to analyze statistical variances; and (2) examine accuracy after [ADDRESS_427311] fixture (Figure 4) to exercise [ADDRESS_427312] was to run each device through a series of ~[ADDRESS_427313] the peak values from the load cell. 100% of the kiios were within this Aim’s accuracy threshold for 100% of these cycles. Additional analysis of the full 33,000+ samples per device (beyond the scope of the original Aim), demonstrated that the device not only reports peak forces accurately during dynamic use, but tracks well throughout the entire force curve. Figure 5 is a close-up of data from a kiio device (shown in green) plotted against the load cell (in red). The graph shows that as forces range from 8-36 lbs., the kiio tracks the commercial load cell with amazing accuracy. Figure 6 shows, for each device, the # of cycles tested and the linear regression analysis R2 and ICC statistics. A typi[INVESTIGATOR_344310]. Kiio also conducted multiple tests to determine if readings drift over time. In addition to the specified 20 days of dynamic load testing for durations ranging from 10 minutes to 1 hour, we also performed static weights tests 3 months after the device’s original calibration. Our conclusion: there’s no discernible drift after 3 months of use. Figure 7 is a summary of statistics for the 20-day testing on 4 kiio devices:

 27  Table 5 – Phase I, Aim 3 outcomes Task Objective outcomes/Milestones Result 3.1 Measurement validity: kiio prototype will accurately measure forces over time as compared to industry calibrated strain gauge (with no more than 2% absolute error, and R²≥0.98) over the course of [ADDRESS_427314] with 100% of samples taken within this specified tolerance (2998 peak readings from the kiio devices were within 1.0 lb. of the load cell value). The R2 and ICC numbers also verify the accuracy of the kiio device. 3.2 Reliability: kiio prototype will demonstrate high intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC≥0.99) comparing baseline to tests that recur over time, throughout extended testing periods (10 min. - 1 hr. continuous use) Success. The results of dynamic testing produced the same consistency that static testing exhibited: All readings were within the tolerance of this Aim; kiio is ready to be ruggedized and enter the next phase of testing. Kiio has shown prototype kiio devices provide accurate measurements for thousands of use cycles over the course of weeks of continuous use, and that the kiio is capable of use with similar frequency to manual muscle testing in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_344311] a month with no loss of accuracy. Successful Completion: By [CONTACT_344330] I, Kiio has demonstrated the feasibility of a hand-portable wireless kiio device prototype. kiio provides objectively valid, reliable measurements of force over time, and accurately transmits this data wirelessly to a PC. This is a major step in Kiio’s overall vision of developi[INVESTIGATOR_344312]: combining the kiio device and kiio FLEX software for Physical and Occupational Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (PT/OT’s). In Phase II Kiio proposes to further refine and ruggedize the kiio for clinical use, to develop kiio FLEX, create an integrated animated exercise library, and to test the system in clinical settings. Concurrently, we will be completing 510k premarket notification on the kiio FLEX System. The fully developed kiio FLEX System will be positioned to provide PT/OT’s a fast, objectively valid, reliable, portable and cost-effective method of strength assessment. This will enable PT/OT’s to integrate evidence-based assessments into their practices which could significantly reduce the disability burden on the U.S. population (both individual and societal costs) by [CONTACT_344331].

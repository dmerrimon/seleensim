S
CREENING VISIT  
Potential eligible subjects, based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria, will present for a screening visit at the 
Nursing Building or Sleep and Performance Research Center on the Spokane campus. Informed consent will be 
obtained after full explanation of the study protocol. Consented subjects will undergo the following:  
• A medical history and physical exam  
• CBC with differential, electrolytes, liver function tests, serum creatinine 
• Routine urine analysis  
• Urine toxicology screen for multiple common drugs of abuse, including several opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]  
• Urine pregnancy test for female subjects of child -bearing potential (prior to enrollment in the study and 
prior to each phase of the study using in- home urinalysis pregnancy screens)  
• Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_373800]2D6  single nucleotide polymorphisms to determine CYP2D6 metabolizer 
status ( i.e., poor or extensive metabolizers)  
  
 
 
 
STUDY DESIGN  
 
 
 
 
 
 
FIGURE  3. Detailed timelines of the sequential arms. 
3.1. Arm [ADDRESS_468084] of two study arms ( FIGURES 2 and 3). Arm 1 will include one 14 -hour inpatient visit, followed 
by 6 outpatient visits. Arms 2a and 2b will include one 14 -hour inpatient visit each; Arm 2b will include one 
additional outpatient v isit. If a subject elects to participate in Arm 2, he/she will undergo a washout period of at 
least [ADDRESS_468085] 7 days will separate Arms 2a and 2b. Subjects will be administered the following:  
Arm 1 : Kratom (2 g
 ) by [CONTACT_181632] a tea.  
 Arm 2a : Two liquid -fi
 lled capsules of dextromethorphan (15 mg each, 30 mg total) by [CONTACT_1966] + midazolam 
syrup (2.5 mg) by [CONTACT_1966].  
 Arm 2b : Kratom (2 g) by [CONTACT_1966] (as a tea) + two liquid- fi
 lled capsules of dextromethorphan (30 mg) by 
[CONTACT_1966] + midazolam (2.5 mg) syrup by [CONTACT_1966].  
 
Study days
. Subjects will be asked to present to the Clinical Research Unit in the Nursing Building or the Sleep 
and Performance Research Center on the morning of each 14 -hour inpatient visit. Vital signs will be checked 
and recorded on case forms. Subjects will be asked of any change to their health status; responses will be recorded on case forms. An intravenous line will be placed in one arm, and two blood samples (5 mL and 3 mL)  
will be drawn through the intravenous line, after which subjects will receive kratom tea alone (Arm 1 ) and/or  drug 
cocktail alone ( Arm 2a ) and drug cocktail + kratom  tea (Arm 2b ). Blood will be drawn from the intravenous  line 
0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, [ADDRESS_468086]-kratom tea and/or post-drug cocktail administration. Urine will 
be collected into multiple jugs from 0 -120 hours  (Arm 1 ) and/or from  0-24 hours (Arms 2a and 2b ). After the 12-
hour blood draw, subjects will be allowed to leave the C linical Research Unit once deemed  safe by [CONTACT_20234] .  FIGURE 2. Overview of study design.  
Screening ≥1 week  
washout   Arm 1  ≥1 week  
washout  Arm 2a  ≥1 week 
washout  Arm 2b   

Subjects will be asked to return to the Clinical Research Unit  for outpatient blood draws ( 5 mL) via venipuncture 
at 24, 48, 72, 96, and [ADDRESS_468087] kratom and/or study 
drug administration. Subjects will be asked to return to the Clinical Research Unit for one additional outpatient 
blood draw (5 mL) via venipuncture up to [ADDRESS_468088] 7 days, as the half -life of mitragynine is ~24 hours. 
Subjects will be asked to refrain from consuming any dietary/herbal supplements or citrus juices for at least [ADDRESS_468089]. John White, a longstanding collaborator/co- investigator 
and registered pharmacist in WA, will oversee the acquisition and storage of oral midazolam and 
dextromethorphan.  
Pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis.  Blood and urine samples for  analysis of midazolam, midazolam 
metabolites, dextromethorphan, dextromethorphan metabolites, and kratom constituent concentrations will be collected. The pharmacokinetics of midazolam, midazolam metabolites, dextromethorphan, dextromethorphan 
metabolites , and kratom constituents will be determined using traditional noncompartmental analysis methods 
and the pharmacokinetics analysis software, Phoenix WinNonlin (v7.0, Certara, Princeton, NJ). A two one- sided 
testing procedure will be used for the primary endpoint analysis as recommended by [CONTACT_373802] -drug 
interactions studies.
2 Specifically, if the treatment/baseline ratio of log- transformed midazolam AUC lay between 
the predefined no- effect range (0.75 -1.33), a kratom -midazolam interaction will not be  evident. Secondary 
endpoints ( e.g., treatment/baseline ratio of  C max, t 1/2, t max, and oral clearance for midazolam and  
treatment/baseline ratio of AUC, C max, t1/2, tmax, and oral clearance for midazolam metabolites, dextromethorphan, 
and dextromethorphan metabolites) will be evaluated using a paired Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon signed- rank 
test as appropriate; a p -value <0.[ADDRESS_468090] to participate in Arm 2, are deemed sufficient for definitive characterization of the half -life of the kratom constituents. For study Arm 2, a  sample size of 12 evaluable subjects will provide 
80% power to detect a 25% change in the primary endpoint ( midazolam AUC) with a Type I error of 0.05, 
assuming 20% intra- individual variability in midazolam AUC.

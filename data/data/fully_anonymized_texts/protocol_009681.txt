The proposed research plan has three specific aims:  
(1) Identify factors associated with degree of fidelity in a previously developed and 
tested basic implementation strategy of WISE;  
(2) Develop an enhanced implementation strategy  to support uptake of the WISE 
intervention using stakeholder input; and  
(3) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_759467].  
To execute these aims, we will use innovative methodologies including an explanatory 
mixed methods approach (Aim 1), a stakeholder -driven Evidence -Based Quality 
Improvement (EBQI) process (Aim 2), and a Hybrid Type 3 implementation design using 
formative evaluation (Aim 3).  We expect that implementation strategies developed with 
stakeholders will lead to improved implementation fidelity.  We will te st the hypothesis 
that improved WISE fidelity is positively related to child outcomes (e.g., child fruit and 
vegetable intake, BMI).  This research will provide critical knowledge on the value of 
investments in implementation support strategies to existing  obesity prevention 
interventions.  
Background and Rationale  
Overweight and obese children are at 5 -times greater risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_759468] 3-times greater risk for hypertension and high triglycerides in adulthood.4  Concurrent 
health issues include asthma, metabolic risks, depression, and attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder.5,6  In spi[INVESTIGATOR_759469], the prevalence of childhood 
obesity is still alarming, particularly for children of lower socioeconomic status.7  For 
example, 14.2% of 2 to 4 year olds in low -income families in Arkansas (AR) are obese 
which is higher than the national average for this age range.[ADDRESS_1040004] adult obesity rate in the nation (35.9%).9  Prevention 
efforts in this high -risk area are clea rly warranted.  
Given that families impacted by [CONTACT_759482], childcare 
provides a critical setting to address socioeconomic disparities in obesity.  Children may 
eat over half of their dietary intake in this setting, up to 540 meals and snacks per 
school year.10  This is notable because young children’s eating habits are more 
attributable to environmental factors than genetics.11  The overarching goal of this study  
is to apply principles of Implementation Science (e.g., formative evaluation, enhanced 
facilitation) to support the upta ke and sustainability of an evidence -based interventions 
(EBIs) for obesity prevention and nutrition promotion in childcare.

children’s diets and prevent obesity.  A re cent study by [CONTACT_759483] -Investigators found that 
regular exposure to fruits and vegetables during school snacks was associated with a 
3% reduction in obesity among children in low -income school districts.[ADDRESS_1040006] across the lifespan.14 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_759470] -risk children in childcare, current practices are not 
consistent  with evidence -based obesity prevention. 15  A review of 18 studies in 
childcare settings found that Early Childhood Educators (ECEs) often do not follow 
evidence -based practices, including signaling hunger cues, avoiding the use of foods for 
celebration/r eward, and allowing children to decide how much to each without 
pressure.15  Personal characteristics of ECEs may be associated with negative 
practices. For example, education level and/o r race/ethnicity have been associated with 
pressuring children to finish their food before leaving the table,21 eating less with 
children, and restrictive feeding practices (e.g., offer food for good b ehavior).[ADDRESS_1040007] been linked with 
improved outcomes.30-32 
However, Implementation Science around obesity prevention in childcare is limited.  A 
2010  systematic review identified no trials investigating implementation strategies’ 
impact on the uptake of evidence -based obesity prevention in childcare.33  A recent 
review identified one Australian trial which found implementation strategies (i.e., 
incentives, training, monitoring and feedback) to positively impact organization -level 
measures of dietary best practices, e.g., increasing offerings of water and

nutrition policies.[ADDRESS_1040009] (e.g., schools and other contexts where 
“paraprofessionals” provide health -related services); however, we don’t know whether 
lessons learned apply to childcare.  Ultimately, improvements in e vidence -based obesity 
prevention in childcare have the ability to impact [ADDRESS_1040010] strategies to 
maximize implementat ion and sus tainability of these practices.  
Objectives  
This proposal proposes the following aims:  
Specific Aim 1.  Identify factors associated with degree of fidelity in a previously 
developed and tested basic implementation strategy of WISE.  An explanatory 
mixed methods approach will use secondary data to identify positive deviance and 
implementation failures among ECEs in a previous WISE implementation study that 
observed notable variability in fidelity to best practices for obesity preventi on.  ECEs 
from the prior study will be identified from quantitative fidelity observations and invited to 
participate in qualitative interviews to determine contextual and individual barriers and 
facilitators to effective implementation.  
Specific Aim 2. Dev elop an enhanced implementation strategy  to support uptake 
of the WISE intervention using stakeholder input.  Based on results from Aim 1 , an 
Evidence -Based Quality Improvement (EBQI) process18 will be used to engage 
stakeholders to develop implementation support strategies consistent with an 
implementation framework (i -PARiHS) and matched to identified barriers/ facilitators.  
Specific Aim 3.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_759471].  We will determine whether the enhanced strategy is feasible, acceptable, 
and demonstrates improved implementation, fidelity, and sustainability using a  Hybrid 
Type [ADDRESS_1040011] the hypothesis that better WISE 
fidelity is positively related to child outcomes (e.g., child fr uit and vegetabl e intake, BMI).

Date:  03/19/2019 Page  6 Study Design  and Procedures  
Aim 1 .  We will use an explanatory sequential mixed methods design to understand 
barriers and facilitators specific to WISE implementation (quant→QUAL).  Quantitative 
data gathered from monthly fidelity observations in previous implementations of WISE 
(i.e., quant)  will be used to identify positive deviants and implementation failures for 
semi -structured interviews (i.e. QUAL).  Concepts from the i -PARiHS framework will 
inform the interview guide.  For example, we will ask educators about perceptions  of the 
evidence -based practices that comprise WISE that impede or promote use of the 
innovation.  We will also ask about contextual elements (e.g., values, organizational 
culture) that made the implementation of WISE easier or more difficult. Previous WISE 
educators (N =  44) with complete observational data will constitute the sample pool for 
semi -structured interviews.  We will also interview directors from each of the 7 sites in 
previous WISE implementation to provide a multi -stakeholder perspective and expose 
potential  organizational barriers and facilitators.  
Aim 2.   We will use EBQI to (1) match barriers and facilitators to WISE implementation 
with potential strategies, (2) tailor strategies to the early childhood context, and (3) 
finalize the enhanced implementation strategy for WISE.  The EBQI Panel will include 
teachers and directors from representative sites that will implement the enhanced 
strategy in Aim 3.  We will include at least one teacher from previous WISE 
implementation to have an expert advisor role, pro viding feedback on feasibility and 
acceptability of potential enhanced implementation interventions based on prior 
experiences.  We will also recruit parents to inform (a) potential improvements to 
enhance the link between the classroom and home and (b) st rategies to improve 
assessment of impacts on WISE for future studies (e.g., parent recruitment strategies, 
collection of genetic/ biological data for possible future moderator/mediator analyses). 
We expect to recruit an EBQI panel of [ADDRESS_1040012] a mutually 
agreed -upon, locally -adapted (if necessary) WISE interventi on and a set of 
implementation interventions/tools (our “enhanced” implementation strategy) with 
accompanying steps on how to deploy them.   
We will employ strategies to provide structure to the EBQI process.  For example, a 
concept mappi[INVESTIGATOR_759472] a Likert scale (1=not important/feasible, 5 = 
extremely important/feasible).  This approach provides quantifiable information, 
promotes efficient collection of inpu t, and provides a basis from which to probe the 
EBQI panel.  Meetings are anticipated to last [ADDRESS_1040013] the

implementation strategy (i.e., facilitation) on uptake while also assessing impacts of the 
intervention on child outcomes.  We expect that the effectiveness of WISE on child 
outcomes will vary by [CONTACT_759484], and a Hybrid 3 design allows 
for us to explore this hypothesis (in a preliminary fashion in the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], but 
in a definitive fashion in the subsequent R01).  
RE-AIM provides an 
evaluation framework to 
assess key aspects of 
intervention programs 
implemented in real -word 
settings.  See Table 1 for a 
summary of outcome 
measures that align with RE -
AIM.  Reach  will be reflected 
by [CONTACT_759485] (target 
= 4 opportunities per child per 
month).  Adoption will be 
measured using teacher reports of the number of WISE handouts distributed (target = 2 
per child per month ), teacher report of the number of WISE lessons and activities 
presented each month, and assessment of food purchase records to assess frequency 
of purchase of WISE foods.  Further, we will modify and use The Organizational 
Readiness to Change Assessment ( ORCA)85 as developed for use with the i -PARiHS 
framework to assesses change commitment (e.g., We value this change) and change 
efficacy (e.g., We can keep the momentum going) both prior to and during 
implementation.  For Implementation , our WISE fidelity measure will be used across the 
school year. The WISE fidelity instrument  (See WISE fidelity)  is rated on a [ADDRESS_1040015] adequate fidelity on a 
component. Additionally, overall scores on the fidelity form are created by [CONTACT_759486] (range = 0 – 32). Inter -rater reliability of 85% will be ensured.  
Finally, acceptability and feasibility26 will be assessed through semi -structured Table 1. Outcome Measures f or Hybrid Trial

fidelity assessment s. We will also conduct interviews with champi[INVESTIGATOR_759473]. These interviews will focus on 
identifying remaining barriers and facilitators to WISE uptake as well as assessing 
feasibility and accep tability of the implementation strategy (See Director and Champi[INVESTIGATOR_759474]).   Maintenance will be assessed by [CONTACT_759487] (Fall) acro ss the school year (Winter and Spring).  
In addition to these measures collected through the K01 study, the COBRE  
project will support the addition of ECE Feeding Assessments at mealtimes  and a 
baseline assessment of center climate and context . The K01 prot ocol only included 
support to assess fidelity to this core component at WISE lessons, not mealtimes. 
However, it is possible that ECEs’ adoption (or lack thereof) of positive feeding practices 
at mealtimes may impact the overall effect of WISE on child out comes. We will add two 
assessments of ECE Feeding Practices: Table Talk79 and the Food Intake module of the 
Building Mealtime Environments and Relationships (BMER)[ADDRESS_1040016] actual ECE behavior. T able Talk quantifies 
ECEs’ feeding communications and captures the full range of practices (i.e., not prone 
to ceiling effects). It captures feeding communications that are detrimental (e.g., 
comments that pressure children to eat more, hurry children to f inish, coerce children to 
eat certain foods) and those that are evidence -based (e.g., direct to internal cues, 
support food exploration). The Food Intake module of BMER captures adult interactions 
that support or undermine self -regulation at meals (e.g., “ Adults do not praise children 
for cleaning their plates.”).These baseline measures will be collected in the Spring of 
2018 across 4 months (Feb - May)  (See Combined Mealtime Observation Forms) . We 
will collect three assessments in each classroom to best acc ount for potential variability 
due to time of year or the menu served. Prior to classroom observations, each teacher 
will be invited to complete a one page (front and back) survey about characteristics of 
her center (See Pre -WISE Context Measure). This inf ormation will be used to inform 
stratified randomization to treatment conditions (basic or enhanced).   
Secondary outcomes will include those related to impacts of the program on children 
(i.e., Effectiveness ).  All families complete a Family Map Inventory  (FMI)[ADDRESS_1040017] Resonance 
Raman Spectroscopy (RRS) scans from children with equipment leased from NuSkin.

their contacts with sites (See Facilitation Log). We will also request tracking of efforts by 
[CONTACT_759489][INVESTIGATOR_5458]. (See Champi[INVESTIGATOR_759475]). Finally, we will ask all teachers to report monthly 
on their use of lesson and enhanced support materials (See Teacher Material Report). 
Data will  be collected either through a secure RedCap Server or using paper and pencil.  
Our par tnering Head Start agency has 12 sites with 38 classrooms.  Classrooms will be 
randomized to participate in either the basic (i.e., control) or enhanced implementation 
of WISE.  Sites are all within Pulaski County and have a similar demographic make -up 
of ECEs and families.  All families served meet the federal guideline for poverty (e.g., an 
annual income of $24,250 for a family of 4). All ECEs will receive basic implemen tation 
supports (6 -hour training at beginning of school year and monthly newsletter).  Those 
randomized to the enhanced condition will receive the additional package of 
implementation support strategies developed in Aim 2 on a schedule agreed upon by 
[CONTACT_941] E BQI panel (e.g., monthly).  These will be delivered by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_534892].  For both groups, we will collect child data before and after implementation.

Building on the Team Nutrition evaluation, w e will also conduct surveys of teachers at

survey. The surveys are estimated to take 30  to 45  minutes. Given limited success with 
web-based surveys in this group, we will gather these surveys using paper and pencil.  
We will complete fidelity observations three times p er year: Fall (Sept – Oct), Winter 
(Jan – Feb), and Spring (March - April).  See WISE Fidelity Form.   We will train contract 
staff to conduct fidelity assessments using videos of previous WISE lessons and ensure 
85% reliability is achieved.  After the Fall a nd Winter assessments, we will determine 
which teachers are achieving fidelity.  We will randomly select [ADDRESS_1040021] our interviews to ECEs that are not achieving fidelity 
if 5 are in that category. After analysis of these interviews at each of the two iteration 
points, we will hold EBQI meetings to review the themes that emerged and the 
observed fidelity in the classrooms u p to that point.  With feedback from the EBQI panel, 
we will use this information to determine shifts needed to improve the enhanced 
strategy for the remainder of the school year.  
Study Population , Inclusion, and Exclusion  
Aim 1.   37 Head Start educators a nd directors will complete one -on-one, open -ended 
interviews.  The educators will be selected based on secondary data from WISE fidelity 
observations collected in a previous study.  These data were collected with consent of 
the educators.  Based on total f idelity scores, the top and bottom 15 educators will be 
invited to provide input on the barriers and facilitators to their success.  Directors from 
participating agency will be invited to provide their input on the same topic.  Once 
selected, educators wil l be contact[CONTACT_759490]’s phone number and invited to

will have the opportunity to schedule an interview.  Teachers will be provided an 
incentive of $25 for part icipation in the interviews.  
Aim 2.   In Aim 2, we will engage key community stakeholders to serve on our Evidence -
Based Quality Improvement (EBQI) panel and provide input on development of an 
enhanced implementation strategy for WISE.  This process will re view the existing 
scientific evidence and data from Aim [ADDRESS_1040022] to support WISE implementation. We will recruit stakeholders from:

Data Analysis  
Aim 1.   We will create a total fidelity score for teachers who participated in WISE 
development.  This  score will be a sum of the number of WISE components where 
fidelity was observed across observations (Possible range = 0 – 32; 4 components * 8 
observations).  These scores will be used to inform purposive sampling for semi -
structured interviews.  ECEs wi th the highest fidelity and lowest fidelity scores will be 
interviewed.  We expect to interview 7 directors and 15 ECEs from each group (N=37).

Figure [ADDRESS_1040028] will streamline the process and prevent long gaps (1 -2 months) between 
when the EBQI panel provides the ratings and when they next discuss those rated most

After each EBQI meeting, the research team will work to assimilate the input fro m the 
EBQI panel, translate it to actionable plans, and develop the next iteration of materials 
for which we seek to receive panel input.  For the qualitative information collected from 
notes and audio recordings, we will employ rapid qualitative coding rel ative to the main 
goals of this EBQI process (e.g., matching barriers/facilitators with implementation 
strategies, tailoring strategies to ECE context). We will write memos for each EBQI 
meeting to inform the development of the enhanced strategy.  
Aim 3.   We will complete rapid coding of the semi -structured interviews with the 
selected ECEs at each iteration.  This coding will focus on identifying aspects of the 
implementation feasibility and acceptability.  Two coders will complete initial content 
analysis  independently and come together to resolve any differences.  These data will 
be combined with the fidelity data collected and presented to the EBQI panel.  Changes 
or improvements to the enhanced strategy will be driven be these findings and th e 
feedback from the EBQI panel.

teachers in the same classroom as well as children nested within classrooms. MLM 
refers to a class of statistical techniques developed to analyze multi -level data 
structures and appropriately model clustered designs. The models will includ e a fixed 
term for intervention (basic versus enhanced) and time. Random effects will be included 
for the correlation of children within classrooms and the correlation of observations 
within teacher. This analysis will allow for estimation of variance in c hild outcomes 
accounted for by [CONTACT_759493] (i.e., level 2) effects.   
Ethical Considerations  
This study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable government regulations 
and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences research policies and 
procedures.   This protocol and any amendments will be submitted and approved by [CONTACT_759494] (IRB) to conduct the study.  
Waivers of informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 
1996 (HIPAA) authorizatio n were approved  for Aims [ADDRESS_1040029]  as this 
research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; waivers will not adversely 
affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; and the research could not practicably be 
carried out with the wa iver. For these aims, the only record linking the subject and the 
study would be the consent document making the principal risk a breach of 
confidentiality.   
Since the initial IRB submission, WISE has expanded from being a curriculum offered in 
some UAMS Head Start sites to being required by [CONTACT_759495]. As such, WISE is now a part of standard educational activities. Due to this 
shift, we are requesting a waiver of consent for teachers in Aim [ADDRESS_1040030]. As in 
Aims 1 and 2 , this research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; and 
waivers will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects.

his/her child to participate. We are therefore requesting a waiver of documentation of 
consent (e .g., "passive consent")for the child participant in Aim 3. The study is minimal 
risk, and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside 
the research context.  
Dissemination of Data  
I will employ a multi -pronged strategy to e nsure that findings from this research are 
disseminated to scientists and community stakeholders.  These efforts will not contain 
any identifiable information that could be linked to a participant.  
Scientists.   I will disseminate these findings to scientist s with interests in early childhood 
development and education as well as nutrition and obesity prevention. I will attend the 
premier conference in nutrition, child development, and implementation science. I will 
also submit findings for publication to lead ing journals in the field such as Early 
Childhood Research Quarterly, Child Development, Appetite, and  Journal of Nutrition 
Education and Behavior .  I will also share abstracts and publications with academic 
listservs and professional social networking sit es on which I am a member.  
Community Stakeholders.   Early educators are a primary stakeholder in the findings of 
this research as well as directors and principals at agencies and schools.  I will share 
back findings of all stages of the project to particip ants and partnering agencies.  I will 
also reach stakeholders through presentation at local conferences with an early 
education focus.  In addition to presentation at in -person sessions, I will prepare Fact 
Sheets highlighting key findings to distribute fr om the booth that our department hosts at 
this conference each year.  This will increase the reach of the dissemination beyond 
those that attend a presentation session.  I will also send a thank you letter to teachers 
involved in both the secondary data an d primary data portions of this project which will 
summarize our findings and next steps.

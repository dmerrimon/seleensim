 Brief Summary It is estimated  that 30 -70% of very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants will be diagnosed  
with swallowing dysfunction (dysphagia), which often leads to airway compromise in the form of laryngeal penetration and/or tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97768]. Chronic airway 
compromise results in a persistent inflammatory state, with disease progression that can be 
devastating for already fragile and developmentally immature lungs in preterm infants.  At this 
time, there are limited therapeutic options for dysphagia in VLBW infants during oral feeding. 
In a recent publication, our research group was the first to demonstrate that short -duration of 
oral feeding with cold liquid reduces dysphagia occurrence from 71% to 26%. However, these data must be further validated for the effectiveness and safety of a full duration feeding before 
being recommended for routine clinical practice.  
 
The objective  is to identify preliminary evidence for the efficacy and safety of feeding full oral 
cold milk for dysphagia management in preterm infants. We hypothesize that oral feeding of 
cold milk in preterm infants with dysphagia will improve  suck/swallow/breathe c oordination and 
decrease penetration/ aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97769]. We further hypothesize that cold milk 
intervention will have no adverse effects on intestinal blood flow, as assessed by [CONTACT_97818].  This is significant because there is a critical need to identify effective and safe 
evidence -based treatment options for dysphagia management in preterm infants.  
 
This prospective study will seek to enroll S ubjects who mee t the fo llowing inclusion criteria: 1) 
preterm infants  less than [ADDRESS_107818] ation), 2) admi tted t o NYU - Langone Long Island 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97770], 3) Post-menstrual age ( PMA) > 35 weeks at the tim e of the stu dy, 4) receiving 
no or minim um respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] (<2 lit/mi n low-fl ow nasal ca nnula), 5) tol erating at lea st 
50% of th eir enteral feedi ng orally , 6) hav ing sym ptoms of swa llowing dysfuncti on during or al 
feeding (c linical dysphagia) and 7) referred by [CONTACT_97819] (VFSS) and/or fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES).   
 
T
o assess the efficacy of cold milk in treating dysphagia, study subjects will first have an oral 
motor feeding assessment using an FDA approved device called the nFant® Feeding 
Solution (510k cleared, #  K143507), used routinely in many NICUs as well as VFSS and/or 
FEES. To assess the safety of using cold milk, subjects will receive a doppler ultrasound 
before and after the ingestion of cold liquid feeding to assess the mesenteric blood flow.  
 
Objectives  Evaluate the effectiveness of cold milk to improve penetration/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97771], as well as to evaluate the safety of oral feeding of cold milk in preterm 
infants

 Endpoint 1. Evaluate the effectiveness of cold milk to improve penetration/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97772].  
The prim ary outc ome will be t he per centage of swa llows with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97773] d/or 
pene tration for cold milk compared with room temp milk (a t otal of 15 swa llows will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_97820] ). Based on our preliminary results, we expect to find a 
significant decrease in penetration and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97774] (5 
swallows). We expect this improvement to be sustained  on the subsequent cold swallows 
(10 swallows) following the 15-minute cold liquid feeding. A decrease of 30% in penetration 
and/or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97775]. Similarly , a 30% improvement 
of feeding coordination as assessed by [CONTACT_97821].  
 
2. Evaluate the safety of feeding cold milk in preterm infants.  
We will evaluate whether cold milk will cause hypothermia (assessed by [CONTACT_97822]), change in vital signs  (respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, and oxygen saturation) as 
well as change in mesenteric blood flow indices (assessed by [CONTACT_97823]).  . 
These changes with cold milk feeding will be expressed as % change compared to base line 
(room temp milk).

1. Introduction, Background Information and Scientific Rationale  
Approximately half a million preterm infants are born every year in the [LOCATION_003].1,2 It is estimated  that 30- 70% of very 
low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants will be diagnosed with swallowing dysfunction (dysphagia), with an inverse 
relationship between the severity of dysphagia and gestational age (GA).3-[ADDRESS_107819] compromise in the form of laryngeal penetration 
and/or tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97778].7,[ADDRESS_107820] compromise results in a persistent inflammatory state, 
with disease progression to chronic lung injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) that can be devastating for 
already fragile and developmentally immature lungs in preterm infants.4,[ADDRESS_107821] compromise in adults with 
dysphagia.17,23,24 However, for preterm infants, the use of cold feeds has  not been well investigated, leaving 
Study #:  i20-[ZIP_CODE]  
  Page 4 of 16 
Version Date: 6/13/[ADDRESS_107822] to demonstrate that short -duration of oral feedings with cold 
liquid (5 swallow s) reduces dysphagia occurrence from 71% to 26%  as assessed by [CONTACT_97824] .
25 Our preliminary data 
furthe r confirms that oral cold milk feeding significantly improves suck/swallow/breathe coordination as evident by 
[CONTACT_97825]. However, these data must be further validated for the effectiveness and safety of a full duration feeding before being recommended for routine clinical practice.  
 The objective  of this application is to identify evidence for the efficacy and safety of feeding full oral cold milk for 
dysphagia management in preterm infants. We hypothesize that oral feeding of col d milk in preterm infants with 
dysphagia will improve  suck/swallow/breathe coordination and decrease penetration/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97769]. We 
further hypothesize that cold milk intervention will have no adverse effects.  
 
2. Potential Risks & Benefits 
For the study purpose, the FEES will be used to assess swallowing coordination with cold milk for a total of [ADDRESS_107823] safety in case of any adverse events. The FEES will be ordered by [CONTACT_97826] (the clinician can do the FEES for the entire feeding or portion of the feeding).  
 
Development of cold stress in response to cold liquids-  I
 t is possible that infants feeding cold li quids will develop 
cold stress. Several studies have assessed the effects of cold feeds in healthy term and healthy preterm infants but 
not in the context of dysphagia. These studies revealed no significant adverse effects including no difference in sleep pattern, vocalizations, motility, intake, feeding behavior, weight gain, temperature or regurgitation.
26 
Blumenthal and colleagues27 reported that cold feeds were well tolerated and produced no obvious clinical effects. 
Other studies found no significant differences in gastric residuals in preterm infants (28 -30 weeks gestation age) 
fed cold (0- 4°C) versus  room temperature (25°C) milk,[ADDRESS_107824] regarding gastric emptying time.27,29 
Based on the current literature in preterm infants, the 15-minute exposure to cold liquid is expected to result in little risk.
30 
 
Cold Stress Prevention - As part of our study design, we are employing frequent axillary and gastric content 
temperature checks to ensure participant safety. Furthermore, infants’ vital signs (blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
heart rate, and oxygen saturation), and evidence of any respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798], will be monitored and recorded.  
 
Radiation Exposure -  For this study, we aim to visualize 15 swallows, which will take approximately 18 seconds. Compared 
to the typi[INVESTIGATOR_97779] 90-180 seconds in routine VFSS. The radiation exposure related to this research equals 
10-20% of what an infant would be exposed to during a typi[INVESTIGATOR_97780].  
Radiation Exposure Prevention – O ur study design will include various radiation sparing techniques: 1) 
Commination, which restricts the x -rays to a smaller area on the subject; 2) Pulsed fluoroscopy, which takes 30 
frames/second, instead of the continuous fluoroscopy of 60 frames/second; 3) The radiologist will utilize intermittent fluoroscopy to turn the radiation on only at the time of swallowing; 4) A lead shield will be placed on the subjects’ 
lap to protect reproductive organs from radiation scatter.  
 
Known Potential Benefits  
The subjects may or may not personally benefit from being in this study. The results of this research (the safety and 
effectiveness of cold milk for each subject) will be disclosed to the medical team for further consideration. If the 
Study #:  i20-[ZIP_CODE]  
  Page 5 of 16 
Version Date: 6/13/2022 
 
 
 results confirm safet y and efficacy for that infant, the medical team can consider using cold milk to treat the infant’s 
dysphagia which can be a significant benefit to the subject.   
 
3. Objectives  
The first objective is to identify preliminary evidence for the efficacy of feeding full oral cold milk for dysphagia 
management in preterm infants. We hypothesize that oral feeding of cold milk in preterm infants with dysphagia will improve  suck/swallow/breathe coordination and decrease penetration/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97769]. Our second 
objective is to confirm the safety of this practice. We hypothesize that cold milk intervention will have no adverse effects on intestinal blood flow as assessed by [CONTACT_97818].  These objectives are significant because there 
is a critical need to identify effective and safe evidence -based treatment options for dysphagia management in 
preterm infants.  
 
4. Study Design  
This will be a prospective study, with each infant serving as their own control. All study subjects will meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria listed in Section [ADDRESS_107825] will be considered for the study if the medical team diagnosed the infant with clinical dysphagia and decided to obtain  
Video Fluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS), or Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing [FEES) or both to 
help manage the dysphagia (such as delay oral feeding till the child is more mature or use feeds thickeners). The 
VFSS and FEES are not a requirement for step 1 however abnormal VFSS and FEES are requirement for step 2.  
 The following study procedures will be done before the routine VFSS/FEES testing ordered by [CONTACT_40730]:  
 
  
  
o St
ep 1  (bedside procedures) :  
 
• We will evaluate the infant’s sucking, swallowing, and breathing patterns using a non -invasive FDA 
approved equipment ( nFant ® Feeding Solution).  This device is in clinical use for several years and routinely 
used in several NICUs.  The nFant has a wireless sensor within the nipple to assess sucking and swallowing 
coordination during feeding. This machine is not routinely used in NYU - Langone Long I sland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97781]. The nfant assessments 
will be performed by [CONTACT_97827], standard room temperature (RTS) and cold temperature (CS, at 4- 9°C) of milk/formula for an entire feeding (15 -20 minutes). The two 
feedings will be done on the same day but may not necessarily  be two consecutive feedings (depending 
on the baby’s eagerness to feed orally). The order of each condition will be randomized to control for fatigue. Inter- and intra- rater reliability measures will be calculated. The nfant assessments will include the following 
measurements:  
 peak amplitude - the displacement of the nipple during compression phase normalized from a calibrated 
0% to 100%;  
 duration - how long or drawn out sucking events are from onset to end in seconds;  

Study #:  i20-[ZIP_CODE]  
  Page 6 of 16 
Version Date: 6/13/2022 
 
 
  frequency - the rate at which consecutive suck events are occurring in Hertz;  
 suck bursts - number of sucks per burst, duration and number of bursts, and active time spent sucking;  
 suck smoothness - the number of velocity changes in a nipple amplitude trace during a suck.  
 
• The axillary  temperature will be measured immediately prior to and after each feeding condition.  It will also 
be measured at 10, and 30 minutes after the CS feed, at the same time the gastric content temperatures are 
taken. Infants’ vital signs will be recorded (blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, and oxygen 
saturation), as well as evidence of bronchospasm, lethargy, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], apnea, tachypnea, 
cyanosis, bradycardia, or tachycardia.  
 
• Doppler ultrasound (Sonosite Edge Ultrasound system, Sonosite, Inc, WA) will be used to measure 
intestinal blood flow indices  including the superior mesenteric artery flow (SMA), peak systolic velocity, 
SMA mean velocity, SMA end- diastolic velocity, resistive index, pulsatil ity index, portal vein volumetric 
blood flow, as well as heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure.  Intestinal blood flow monitoring via 
Doppler ultrasound will be performed 6 times for each participant, performed one hour before and at 30 and 60 minutes  after both bedside feeding conditions (RTS and CS). Measurements will be taken at the bedside  
in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  
 
o S
tep 2 (done 24- 48 hours after step 1):  
• Infants will be transported to the radiology suite and undergo VFSS and or FEES, as ordered by [CONTACT_97828] (Figure1: the blue boxes indicate procedures done for research purpose only. None of the 
research procedures are experimental and are approved tests for neonates including VFSS, FEES, nfant 
test and abdominal ultrasound).  
• Routi ne procedure f or VFS S or FEES will be fo llowed as ordered by [CONTACT_40730]. T his procedure is 
part of the routine clinical care and not considered part of the research study.  
 
• If no dysfunction is noted, the procedure will end, and the child will no longer be eligible for further participation in this research study. If dysfunction (penetration/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) either on the VFSS or FEES study 
is noted, the child will be eligible to participate in the next phase of the study.  
 
• Imme diately follo wing the initial VFSS- FEES assessment , the infa nts will remain in t he same  seated 
positi on with the FEES scope in pl ace. While keepi[INVESTIGATOR_97782] -FEES the 
same, the infant will be fed cold barium (4- 9°C) using the same nip ple. A total of 5 swallows will be 
visualized using VFSS and FEES, labeled “Cold Swallows -1 (CS1).” These 5 swallows assessment are 
done for the research purpose only.  
 
• If the dysphagia didn’t improve, the study would end, and the child will no longer be eligible for participation further in this research study.  
 
• If the dysphagia improves with cold liquid,  VFSS will then be turned off and the infants will then be fed their 
regular feeds (formula or expressed breast milk as indicated by [CONTACT_40730]) chilled to an approximate 
temperature of 4- 9°C for a total of 15 minutes, or until the infant shows signs of feeding completion. The 
cold feeding will be replaced every 5 minutes to make sure that the temperature is maintained at 4- 9°C to 
minimize habitu ation effect.
30  
 
• After the 15 minute period, the infant will be re- assessed by [CONTACT_97824] -FEES using cold barium from the same 
bottle (10 swallows, labeled “Cold Swallows -2” [CS2]). This desi gn evaluates  whethe r a full feeding of cold 
liquid will result in decreased penetration or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97783]. These 10 swallows 
assessment are done for the research purpose only).  
 
 
• The axillary  temperature will be monitored every 10 minutes. Infants’ vital signs (blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], heart rate, and oxygen saturation), as well as evidence of any respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798], will be 
recorded. A neonatologist will be next to the baby [CONTACT_97829]. The baby [CONTACT_97830], including the neonatologist.

  Depending on the scheduling of the VFSS/FEES testing by [CONTACT_58076]’s medical team, the research team might need 
to do Step [ADDRESS_107826] number will reside on REDCap.  
 
Chart Review – For this study patient data will be collected including date of birth, gestational age at birth, birth 
weight, gender, and ethnicity. Furthermore, patient charts will be reviewed to track infants’ clinical courses and 
diagnoses (such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], BPD, NEC, incidence of infections, retinopathy of prematurity, and 
intraventricular hemorrhage, etc.). All patient records will be assigned unique numerical codes and study records 
will be kept in a secure database. Coded sheets linking a subject’s name [CONTACT_1639] a subject’s identification number will be 
stored separately in a password protected document only accessible to research personnel.  
Data Sources and Case Ascertainment:  
Cases will be obtained through a search for inclusion crit eria using EPIC.  
 Statistical Considerations - 
 
Statistical Analysis and Estimated Sample Size:   T
 o evaluate whether cold liquid will improve aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97784], event rates during CS compared to RTS, as well as corresponding 95% confidence intervals, will be 
computed.  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97785] -Smirnov (K -S) test. Wilcoxon Signed- Rank test will be used to evaluate the specific aim 1, i.e., compare 
changes  in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97786].  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97787] (FEES and VFSS).  Power and Sample Size:  Our preliminary data showed a mean change of 
44 and 36% in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97788], respectively. For power computation, we conservatively assumed an average change of 30% and a common standard deviation of [ADDRESS_107827] (the non -parametric equivalent of the paired t -test) with 
alpha=0.[ADDRESS_107828] correlation of 0.20, which revealed that a sample size of N=25 subjects  
would provide us more than 95% power to detect a large effect size both in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97788]. These 
simulation r esults are based on [ZIP_CODE] Monte Carlo samples. A ssuming a cons ervative estimate that 60% of infa nts 
with clinical dysphagia will have a positive VFSS or FEES t est, we expe ct that we will need to enroll [ADDRESS_107829]. NYU - Langone Long Island Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97789] a Re gional 
Perinatal Cent er (one of [ADDRESS_107830] ate). The average number of VLBW i nfants admitt ed is 90- 100/year and at least 40-
45 infants/year w ill ha ve clinical dysphagia referred f or VFSS-FEES testi ng (3-4 patients /month). Ther efore, we 
are confide nt that we w ill ha ve sufficient sample size over the 2-year grant peri od to conduct the propos ed aim s.

 2: Evaluate the safety of feeding cold milk in preterm infants.  
Axillary temperatures, as well as mesenteric blood flow indices, will be compared between the CS and RTS feeds. 
A Two One -Sided Test (TOST) will be used to evaluate whether the body temperature and blood flow indices are 
equivalent before and after the cold liquid swallow. Equivalence will be determined if the 90% confidence interval 
of pre- post change is contained within the predefined margin of ±0.5. Power and sample size:  The study subjects 
are the same subjects enrolled in Aim 1 (n=42). We have simulate d data assuming a margin of equivalence from -
0.5° C to 0.5° C, significance level 0.05, TOST and [ZIP_CODE] Monte Carlo samples. With the planned sample size for 
aim 1 (N=42), we will have sufficient power (>80%) to detect equivalence when the margin of equivalence is from -
0.5° C to 0.5° C and the actual mean difference is zero.  
5. Study Enrollment

symptoms of swa llowing dysfuncti on during or al feeding (c linical dysphagia). 7) referred by [CONTACT_97831]/or FEES assessments.  
 
Exclusion Criteria  
Exclusion criteria include children  with othe r comorbidities, such as IUGR, upp er airway anomalies, brain injury, 
neuromuscular disease, or life-threate ning congenital disease. 
 
Total Number of Participants and Sites  
We will need [ADDRESS_107832]. 
Although previous studies as well as our preliminary study didn’t show any evidence of cold stress in response to 
cold milk feeding, it is a potential risk. In addition there will be minor increase in radiation exposure as desc ribed 
previously.  Currently there is no effective treatment for dysphagia in preterm infants. The results of this research 
(the safety and effectiveness of cold milk for each subject) will be disclo sed to the medical team. If the results 
confirm safety and efficacy for that infant, the medical team can consider using cold milk to treat the infant’s 
dysphagia which can be a significant benefit to the subject.  
 
Subjects Identification, Recruitment and Consent Process  
 
• Patients would already be admitted to NYU - Langone Long Island Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97791]. 
Physicians will refer patients for a feeding/swallowing consult with the clinical SLP when identified as having 
symptoms of swa llowing dysfuncti on during or al feeding (c linical dysphagia) . The research team will identify  
possible subject’s eligibility through EPIC query .  
 
• Our recruitment plan: All subjects will be infants admitted to the NYU - Langone Long Island Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97792]. Subjects will be identified based on referral for feeding/swallowing consult, followed by [CONTACT_97832]/exclusion criteria by [CONTACT_97833] . 
There will be no restrictions regarding sex, race, or ethnic origin.  After the consent is obtained,  all study 
participants will be deemed medically stable to tolerate the study protocol by [CONTACT_97834].  
 
•  This study will use a NYU Data Core generated list of patients meeting the inclusion criteria who have 
agreed to be approached for clinical research.  
 
Study #:  i20-[ZIP_CODE]  
  Page 9 of 16 
Version Date: 6/13/2022 
 
 
 • Once potential subjects have been identified, the study team will notify the subject’s treating physician (TP) that they have patients eligible to participate using the following method: The treating physici an will 
be contact[CONTACT_97835], by [CONTACT_648], or in person and asked to permit study team to directly contact [CONTACT_52893]. The treating physician may also contact [CONTACT_97836]. Once contact [CONTACT_58661], patients will be told the reason they are being contact[CONTACT_97837]. Should the potential subjects agree, the 
study team will provide the subjects with information regarding the next steps for participation.  
 
• The research team will approach the parents to discuss this research project during their visit to their infant 
in the NICU. Alternatively, the research team will call the parents on the phone to set a meeting time during 
their next visit to the NICU. The parents will be asked to meet in a private room in the NICU to explain all the details regarding the research and consent process and answer all their questions. The parents will be 
provided a copy of the consent form and will be given a chance to read the consent form privately (for at 
least a couple of hours or till next day if they wish). The research team will meet with the parents again in 
a private room to further answer any questions before signing the consent form if they agreed to participate 
in the study.  
•  
• Information contained within the consent will be written at an eighth-grade level to help ensure universal comprehension. All members of this research team have been trained in human subject research and will 
review the consent form in detail with the potential subject’s representatives. The subject’s representatives 
will be provided the opportunity to have all questions answered. Comprehension will be judged by [CONTACT_97838]. If English 
is not a primary language, a translator will be provided via telephone (Cyracom) to obtain consent in the 
subject’s representative’s primary language. The translator’s identification number will be recorded. A copy 
of the consent will be given to the patient, with the original maintained in a locked file cabinet. Coercion to 
obtain consent within this timeframe will not occur. Please see further details regarding informed consent process, in the section below titled: “ Ethics/Protection of Human Subjects”.  
 
6. Sample Size Determination  
Our preliminary data (REF) showed a mean change of 44 and 36% in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97788], respectively. For power computation, we conservatively assumed an average change of 30% and a common standard deviation of [ADDRESS_107833] (the non -
parametric equivalent of the paired t -test) with alpha=0.[ADDRESS_107834] correlation of 0.20, 
which revealed that a sample size of N=25 subjects  would  provide us more than 95% power to detect a large effect 
size both in aspi[INVESTIGATOR_97788]. These simulation results are based on [ZIP_CODE] Monte Carlo samples. 
Assumi ng a cons ervative estimate that 60% of infa nts with clinical dysphagia will have a positive VFSS or FEES 
test, we expe ct that we will need to enroll [ADDRESS_107835]. 
 
Informed Consent Process  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and 
continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of participation will be provided to the infants’ parents. Consent forms will be IRB -approved and the parents (defined 
as either the mom or dad if they are legally married) will be asked to read and review the document. The study investigators will explain the research study to the parents and answer any questions that may arise. All participants 
will receive a verbal explanation in terms  suited to their comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential 
risks of the study and of their rights as research participants. Parents will have the opportunity to carefully review 
the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The parents should have the opportunity to discuss the 
study with their surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The parents will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study. The parents may withdraw consent at any 
time throughout the course of the study. A copy of the signed informed consent document will be given to the 
parents for their records. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_97839].

transmitted to and stored at the NYU - Langone Long Island Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97793]. This will not include the participant’s 
contact [CONTACT_1290]. Rather, individual participants and their research data will be identified by a unique 
study identification number. The study data entry and study management systems by [CONTACT_77967]. At the end of the study, all study databases will be de- identified and archived at NYU - 
Langone Long Island Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97794].  
 
Safety Monitoring Plan  
As requested by [CONTACT_4289], Safety Monitoring Plan is established as detailed below:  
 
This Safety Monitoring Plan is intended to describe processes in place for tracking and reporting Serious Adverse 
Events (SAE) and Adverse Events (AE), in compliance with NYU Institutional Review Board (IRB) and NICHD policy 
as well as ensuring the validity and integrity of the data obtained from this study.  
 
This trial will be submitted for approval to the NYU IRB. The research will not occur without NYU IRB prior approval. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_97795], including immediate IRB notifications of serious adverse events, protocol deviation/violations and annual continuing review. This trial will be registered at 
clinicaltrials.gov.  
 All participant information will be secured in a database with password protection. The research nurse will receive 
only coded information that is entered into the database under those identification numbers. Electronic  
communication with outside collaborators will involve only unidentifiable information.  
 Roles and Responsibilities  
 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_97796] (PI) is responsible for study oversight, including ensuring human subjects’ research 
protections (HSP), by [CONTACT_9939], trained research staff, and medical clinicians to assess, 
report, and monitor Adverse Events (AEs). The PI, Sub-investigators, and study team members, will have current 
HSP certi fication and participate in research educational sessions, based on the current NIH and IRB guidelines.  
 
Drs. Hanna (PI), Dumpa and Kamity (Sub- Investigators) will have primary responsibility for monitoring participants’ 
well-being and ensuring that the information collected in this study remains confidential. Participants will be deemed 
Study #:  i20-[ZIP_CODE]  
  Page 11 of 16 
Version Date: 6/13/[ADDRESS_107838]. The procedures (VFSS, FEES, nfant and IDFS) will  be conducted in the presence of [CONTACT_97848] 
and/or [CONTACT_97849] and/or [CONTACT_97850] (all staff neonatologists in addition to being study investigators) to ensure airway safety in case of any adverse events.  
 
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) Responsibilities  
• A Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMB) will be created in accordance with established NIH policies. 
The members will be experts in neonatology (Teofilita Isaacson, MD, chair of the DSMB), pediatric pulmonary 
medicine (Melodi Pi[INVESTIGATOR_97797], MD), pediatric nephrology (Manju Chandra, MD), pediatric gastroenterology and clinical trial design and ethics (Tuvia Marciano, DO) and biostatistics (Meredith Akerman, MS), who are not 
investigators  in the trial.  
 
• The DSMB will meet regularly to review the protocols with respect to maintaining human subject protection, ethical and safety standards, monitor the safety of ongoing clinical trials, and advise the research team on this 
conduct. It will report to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_97798]. All data and deliberations of the DSMB will be strictly confidential. Decisions to alter or halt studies are the responsibility of the DSMB chair. The DSMB 
may recommend protocol modifications based on concerns for patient welfare or scientific integrity. The 
committee wil l be privy to statistical data and case report forms that it may require for its deliberations. It will 
review interim reports of patient accrual and outcome measures provided by [CONTACT_978]. Each report analyses will 
include treatment group and present all patients exits, mortality, and other major clinical events. After reviewing 
each such report, the DSMB will assess the need to perform further in- depth evaluation of the benefits and risks 
of continuing the study. If it is determined that the study objectives  have not been satisfied based on data 
accrued to date, if patient safety would be compromised by [CONTACT_97840], or if there are severe unanticipated problems with study conduct, the DSMB may recommend to the NICHD that the trial be terminated.   
 
• The DSM fB will meet quarterly as well as after each enrollment of 10 patients (a n Interim Analysis of the results 
as well as all AEs will be presented). Emergency meetings will be scheduled immediately (maximum within 48 
hours) following any reported SAEs. Any death will requir es expedited reporting by [CONTACT_2020] ( within 24 
hours of study’s knowledge of death). 
 
• DSMB report will be submitted to NIH within one week after each quarterly scheduled meeting. However, any 
action by [CONTACT_97841] a temporary or permanent suspension of the clinical study will be reported to 
the NIH Program Official responsible for the grant within 48 hours. Any death will requir es expedited reporting 
to NIH program officer within 24 hours of study’s knowledge of death. 
 Reportable Adverse Events, including Serious Events  
 
Definitions Adverse Event (AE), also referred to as an adverse experience, is any untoward medical occurrence in humans, 
whether or not considered intervention related, which occurs during the conduct of a clinical trial. Any change in 
clinical status, routine labs, x -rays, physical examinations, etc., that is  considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_97842]. Adverse events will include: hypothermia (defined as temp less than 35.5 degree 
C) , abnormal changes in vital signs including  respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (apnic epi[INVESTIGATOR_97799] 70/min) 
, heart rate (less than 70/min or more than 220/min) , and oxygen saturation (less than 85% ), . The staff nurses 
normally records any abnormal vital signs findings as part of their routine NICU care for all babies. These data will continuously be recorded during the cold feeding (usually around 15 minutes). Changes in vital signs can be a 
routine and frequent occurrences in preterm babies as part of their pathophysiology, The following AEs if occurred during the cold feeding will result in study termination for that baby [CONTACT_97843]:  
1- Any incidence of hypothermia 
2- More than 2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_97800]  
3- Tachypnea defined as increase respi[INVESTIGATOR_97801] 70/min for more than 2 minutes  
4- More than 2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_1418] (defined as HR less than 70 for more than 10 seconds).  
5- Tachycardia (defined as HR more than 220) for more than one minute 
Study #:  i20-[ZIP_CODE]  
  Page 12 of 16 
Version Date: 6/13/2022 
 
 
 6- More than 2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_97802] (defined as O2 saturation less than 85%) for more than 30 seconds  
 Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs), as determined by [CONTACT_978], are any event that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening SAE (life- threatening means that the study participant was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred)  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
4. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life function. 
5. Important medical event that may not result in one of the above outcomes, but may jeopardize the health of the study participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition of SAE.  
 
Participants in these studies will likely have pre-existing  medical conditions, those pre -existing conditions will not 
be reported as adverse events. New events or the worsening through frequency or intensity of pre- existing 
conditions will be reported as adverse events within the context of the study.  
 
Elicitatio n of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
AEs and SAEs may be discovered through any of these methods:  
• Observing the participant by [CONTACT_5051]  
• Observing the participant by [CONTACT_97844] (which will be done in an objective 
manner)  
• Questioning the participant’s parent or legal guardian (which will be done in an objective manner)  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the NICU medical team and/or participant’s parent or legal 
guardian  
• Reviewing of medical records/source docume nts 
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_97803]. It is anticipated that data verification will be performed by [CONTACT_97845], or by [CONTACT_65752]- data entry. A statement reflecting the results of the ongoing 
data review will be incorporated into the Annual Report for the Independent Monitor  
 Reportable AEs and SAEs will be documented on the Adverse Event Form first and will be recorded within the 
participant’s records. Source documents, including copi[INVESTIGATOR_97804]. Only the participant’s study ID will be provided on source documentation, all other protected 
health information (PHI) must be redacted prior to report submission.  
 
Assessment of Severity:  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_97805] (AE or SAE), severity (e.g. Grade 1- 3) and causality during 
review of medical records, and will consult with other research personnel as needed. The investigator will document (signature/date) an assignment of severity (e.g., Grade 1 -3) and make the initial determination of the causality of 
the event to the study intervention/procedures. The investigator may not delegate someone other than a clinician licensed to make diagnoses to this responsibility.  The results will be submitted to the DSMB for review, verification 
and taking appropriate action as needed.  
 Guidelines for Assessing Severity of an Adverse Event  
The PI /DSMBwill use the following definitions when assessing severity of an Adverse Event:  
• Grade- 1/ MILD: Participant has minor findings, but tolerates them well and no or minimal intervention 
is required  
• Grade- 2 / MODERATE: Participant exp eriences enough symptoms or findings to require intervention  
• Grade- 3 / SEVERE: Participant experiences symptoms or findings that require significant intervention  
 Guidelines for Determining Causality of an Adverse Event  
Study #:  i20-[ZIP_CODE]  
  Page 13 of 16 
Version Date: 6/13/2022 
 
 
 The PI /DSMB will use the following q uestion when assessing causality of an adverse event to the study 
product/intervention: Is there a reasonable possibility that the study product/intervention caused the event? 
“Reasonable possibility” means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study 
intervention/procedures and the adverse event. An affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected adverse reaction.  
  
SAE Reporting and Management Procedures  
• Study staff will be trained to extract, evaluate, and report adverse events according to the protocol requirements 
and under the direct supervision of the PI. Unexpected, serious, and intervention -related serious adverse events 
(SAEs) will be reported to the DSMB, NYU IRB, and NIH immediately. Any adverse events, breaks of 
confidentiality, or any other data or safety issues that arise will be immediately brought to the attention of the 
NYU - IRB. All events will be reported within [ADDRESS_107839]. 
Dumpa will be responsible for completing an Adverse Events Form should an event occur.  
 
• The following information will be reported for each event and must be reviewed by [CONTACT_1719]: 1) description  of the event, 2) start date, 3) stop date, 4) severity of the event, 5) causal relationship to study 
product/intervention, 6) seriousness, 7) outcome of the event, and 8) if action with study product/intervention was required.  
 
• Drs. Hanna, Dumpa and Kamity will collaboratively gather any information needed to investigate the event and 
to determine subsequent action. Any subsequent action will be documented and reported to the NYU IRB and 
the Program Officer at NICHD. Adverse event reports will be reported in the annual continuing review report to the NYU IRB to ensure participant safety. Procedures to protect patient confidentiality and systems to ensure 
secure file transfer of sensitive data will be in place.  
 
Study Halting/Termination:  
 
The study will stop immediately if any of the following is to occur:  
1- Any Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), as detailed in the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, will result in the 
immediate stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_68660]. The SAE will be reported immediately ( within 48 h ours) to the Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) and the NIH program officer responsible for the study. Any death will requir es 
expedited reporting (within 24 hours of study ’s knowledge of death). N o further enrollment will be allowed 
until the DSMB determines that this event was unrelated to the study procedures.  
2- Frequent AEs  as a result of cold milk feeding that deemed to be excessive by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_97806].  No further enrollment will be allowed until the DSMB determines that these  event s were  
unrelated to the study procedures.  
3-  The decision by [CONTACT_97846]. Any action resulting in a 
temporary or permanent suspension of the clinical study will be reported to the NIH Program Official responsible for the grant. During the funding of this study, any action by [CONTACT_1622] (if applicable), NYU IRB 
or one of the study investigators that results in a temporary or permanent suspension of the study will be 
reported to the NIH Program Official immediately.

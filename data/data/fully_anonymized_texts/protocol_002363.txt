LY2951742Summary of Study Design :  
A multi site, randomized, double -blind, parallel, placebo -controlled trial with 4 study periods in patients who meet 
International Classification of Headache Disorders (I CHD )criteria for a diagnosis of migraine as confirmed during a 
prospective baseline period thatdemonstrate sepi[INVESTIGATOR_635318] (4to 14 migraine headache days per month) .
Treatment Arms and Duration:   
Three treatment arms: LY2951742 ( 120mg/month with a [ADDRESS_848800] injection [administered as 
2 injections of 120 mg at Visit 3] ), LY2951742 (240 mg /month, administered as 2 injections of 120 mg ),and 
placebo.  Following a prospective baseline (30 -40 days) period, eligible patients will be randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio 
to receive placebo, 120 mg/month of LY2951742 , or 240 mg/month of LY2951742, respectivel y, and will begin a 6-
month treatment phase .  This phase will be followed by a [ADDRESS_848801] -
treatment phase during which patients will 
no lo nger receiv eany study  medication .
Number of Patients :
The study  will screen an estimated 1557 potential study participants to ensure randomization of approximately 825
patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730]. 
Statistical Analysis:
Unless otherwise specified , analy ses will be conducted on an intent -to-treat (ITT) population, which include all 
patients who are randomized and receive at least one dose of investigational product . Patients in the ITT population 
will be analyzed according to the treatment group to which they are randomized. When mean change from baseline 
is assessed, the patient will be included in the analysis only if the patient has a baseline and postbaseline 
measurement.
The primary analysis will evaluate the efficacy of two doses of LY2951742 compared with placebo on the overall 
mean change from baseline in the number of monthly migr aine headache days during the 6- month double -blind 
treatment phase. Migraine headache day will be defined to include both migraine and probable migraine days. The 
primary  analy sis will be performed using a restricted maximum likelihood based mixed models repeated measures 
(MMRM) technique.  The analysis will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment, regio n, month, and 
treatment -by-month interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline number of migraine headache 
days and baseli ne number of migraine headache days -by-visit interaction.

LY29517422.Introduction
2.1. Background
Migraine is a chronic, debilitat ing condit ion found to be one of the top 10causes of disabilit y 
expressed as years lived with disabilit y globally (Vos et al . 2012).  However , one study  estimates 
that only a small fract ion of patients receive prevent ive treatment, although more than 25% of 
migraineurs are in need of prevent ive therapy (Rizzoli 2014).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_96631] y of 
prevent ive medicat ions for migraine, sign ificant needs remain for new treatm ent opti ons wi th 
improved efficacy and tolerabilit y.
Calcitonin gene -related pepti de(CGRP), a 37 -amino acid neuropeptide , is widely expressed 
throughout the central and peripheral nervous sy stem and acts as a local facil itator of 
inflammatory  processes .  CGRP is implicated in the pathophysio logy of migraine and is 
hypothesized to be invo lved in the release o f inflammatory mediators and the transmissio n of
nociceptive (pain) informat ion from intracranial  blood vessels to t he nervous system (Villal ón
and Olesen 2009). In migraineurs, serum concentrations o f CGRP are significant ly elevated 
during migraine attacks (Goadsby [CONTACT_2297]. 1990; Goadsby [CONTACT_529987] 1993) ,and infusio n of 
CGRP to individuals wit h a history  of migraine can trigger migraine attacks (Lassen et al. 1998, 
Lassen et al. 2002). The n eutraliz ation of CGRP with antibodi es has been shown to modulate 
neurogenic inflammat ion; thus, these ant ibodies may represent a promising pharmaco logic
approach for the prevent ion of  migraine (Investi gator’s Brochure [IB], Section 3.1) .
LY2951742 is a humanized monoclonal ant ibody  that potently  and selectively binds t o CGRP, 
prevent ing CGRP -mediated bio logical effects (IB, Section 3.1).  To date, m ore than [ADDRESS_848802] been exposed to LY2951742 at single doses ranging fro m 1 to 600 mg and 
multiple doses up to 300 mg in 5 clinical trials of LY2951742.  In studies of pat ients with 
migraine ( Studi es I5Q -MC-ART1 [ART -01] and I5Q -MC-CGAB [CGAB]), efficacy data have 
demonstrated that LY2951742 had significant ly greater mean reduction s than placebo in 
migraine headache days and other efficacy  parameters.  Across clinical studies of LY2951742, 
assessment of adverse events (AEs) indica tes that LY2951742 has been well tolerated in both 
healt hy subjects and in pat ients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_39751] c migraine.  The AEs generally  have been mild to 
moderate in severit y. In two studies of pat ients with migraine, the most frequent ly reported AEs 
included inje ction
-site pain, upper respi [INVESTIGATOR_39738], abdo minal pain, dizziness, 
inject ion-site ery thema, rash, hypertensio n, and nasopharyngit is.  Analyses of laboratory  values 
and cardio vascular mo nitoring of the clinical studies have shown no other clinic ally important 
changes in tested parameters.
2.2. Study Rationale
Study  I5Q-MC-CGAG (EVOLVE -1) will enable a more com prehensive clinical assessment of 
LY2951742 in a patient populat ion for whi ch the drug al ready has shown preliminary evide nce

epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730], is intended to provide pi[INVESTIGATOR_635319] a registration program 
in patients with migraines.  EVOLVE -1will include [ADDRESS_848803] 1 dose of 
LY2951742 (120 or 240 mg/month) is superior to 
placebo in the prevention of migraine headache in 
patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_635320].The overall m ean change from baseline in the number of 
monthly migraine headache days during the 6-mo nth 
double -blind treatment phase.

LY29517424.Study  Design
4.1. Overview of Study Design
Study  CGAG (EVOLVE -1) is a Phase 3, mult isite, double -blind, rando mized, pla cebo -
controlled, study  ofLY2951742 in pat ients suffering fro m epi[INVESTIGATOR_39751] c migraine. The study  has4 
periods, including a prospective baseline phase to determine patient eligibilit y.  
Figure CGAG. 1illustrates the study design.
Figure CGA G.1. Illustration of study design for Clinical Protocol I5Q-MC-CGAG .
Study Period I: The study and potential risks will be explained to the patientat Visit 1.  The 
inform ed consent form (ICF) must be signed before any study  procedures are perform ed.  
Patients are requi red to di scont inue all excluded medicat ions or migraine prevention treatments 
at least [ADDRESS_848805] 4 months prior to Visit 2.
The screening visit (Visit 1) will consist of a full clinical assessment, including a comprehensive 
medical evaluat ion docum enting medical history , and a physical and neuro logical examination
(Appendix 2 ).  Visit [ADDRESS_848806] scheduled procedure of the screening 
assessment i s completed.  

I5Q-MC-CGAG Clinical Protocol Page 20
LY2951742Study Period II : Qualified pat ients will enter Study  Period II ( prospective baseline ) to 
determine their eligibilit y for the study  and to establish baseline data for comparison of endpo ints 
during the treatment period.   Beginning at Visit 2, pati ents will  log in daily to the electronic 
patient-reported outcomes ( ePRO) system  to answer que stions about the occurrence of 
headaches, headache duration, headache features , severit y of headache, and use of headache 
medicat ion.  At the end of the prospective baseline period, siteswill be notified whether their 
patients m et criteria a nd are eligibl e to be randomized at Visit 3.  
To avoid biased reporting, patients must not be told the number of migraine headache days 
on which study qualification is based.
Study Period III :At the start of the 6 -month,double -blind treatment p hase ( Visit 3),patients 
meet ing all eligibilit y requi rements will be randomized to 1 of 3treatm ent groups in a 2:1:1 ratio 
to receive placebo, 120 mg/mo nth LY2951742 , 
or 240 m g/month LY2951742, respect ively.   
Patients randomized to the 120 mg dose of LY2951742 will re ceive an init ial loading dose of 
240 m g ([ADDRESS_848807] ions of 120 m g each at Vi sit 3 only ).To preserve blinding throughout the study, 
patients in all treatm ent groups will receive [ADDRESS_848808] during office visits (Figure CGAG. 1).  
For all treatment groups, subcutaneous inject ionswill be administered once monthly at the 
dosing visits.   
At Visi t 3(first dose) , pati ents will be requi red to rem ain in the office for 
observat ionfor [ADDRESS_848809] ion.  Patients will cont inue to log in and com plete the 
ePRO diary each day .  Pati ents m ay cont inue to take thei r allowed acute migraine headache 
medicat ion(with som e limi tations;see concomitant medicat ionsstudy  tool)during the treatment 
phase.   
Patients who com plete th is phase or discont inue for any  reason during Study  Period III will be 
expected to enter post -treatm ent follow-up (Study  Peri od IV).  
Study Period IV : During this 4 -monthphase, s ites and patients wi ll remain blinded to patients’ 
treatm ent assi gnments.  Pati ents will  follow all study  procedures during S tudy Period IV but will 
not receive LY2951742 or placebo. One month after Visit 12, if clinically warranted due to a 
worsenin g of symptom s, patients m ay start mi graine preventi on medicat ions at the discretion of 
the invest igator.  The list of allowed prevent ive medications is provided in theconcomitant 
medicat ions study  tool.  At Vi sit 14 (Month 10), pati ents will return to the si te for thei r last stud y 
visit and discharge fro m the study .

Activities(Appendix 2 )for the last patient.
4.3. Scientific Rationale for Study Design
The l ength of the rando mized treatment phase is considered suffic ientto assess the safet y and 
efficacy  of a migraine prevent ion medicat ionand is consistent with regulatory  feedback .A 4-
month post -treatm ent follow-up phase is included to evaluate patient safety  during wash -out of 
LY2951742. This allows for a total of [ADDRESS_848811] -treatment observat ion peri od all ows f or a wash -out of 
approximately  5 eliminat ion half-lives of LY2951742 and should decrease LY2951742 serum 
concentrations by [CONTACT_3450] 97% during this time. 
4.4. Justification for Dose
Doses of120and240 m
g administered once monthly were selected primarily on the basis of 
clinical efficacy  and pharmacokinet ic/pharmacodynamic data fro m the Phase [ADDRESS_848812] anned doses of 120 m g and 
240mg LY2951742 for Study  CGAG also are being evaluat ed in two other pi[INVESTIGATOR_635321]2951742; one of these studies is in patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730], and one is in 
patients wi th chroni c migraine.
4.5. Benefit/Risk Assessment
More i nform ation about the known and expected benefits, risks, serious adverse events (SAEs) 
and reasonably ant icipated adverse events (AEs) of LY2951742 are to be found in th e 
Invest igator’s Brochure (IB).
I5Q-MC-CGAG Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_848813] ion criteria.  Eligibilit y of patients for study  
enrollment will be based on the results of a screening medical history, physical examinat ion, 
neuro logical examinati on, clinical laboratory  tests, electrocardi ograms ( ECG s), and migraine 
history  during screening and aprospective baseline period, as described in the Inclusio n and 
Exclusio n Cri teria sect ions.  The nature of any comorbid condit ions present at the time of the 
physical examinat ion and any  pre-exist ing condit ions must be documented.   Individuals who do 
not m eet the cri teria for parti cipat ion in this study  (screen failure) for specific reasons as outlined 
may be considered for rescreen ingonce, wi th approval  from Eli Lilly and Co mpany ( Lilly )
Medical (Sect ion 5.3).
Study  parti cipants shoul d be instructed not to donate blood or blood products during the study or 
for [ADDRESS_848814] .
Prospective approval o f protocol  deviati ons to recrui tment and enro llment criteria, also known as 
protocol  waivers or exempt ions, are not permitted.

LY29517426.Treatment
6.1. Treatments Administered
This study  involves a comparison of LY2951742 ( 120and 240 mg) administered once monthly
with placebo.   Sites will  administer inject ionsof investi gational product (LY2951742 and/or 
placebo) at6 office visits during the treatment p hase (Appendix 2 ). 
Possible inject ion sites include the abdo men, thi gh, and upper arm .  Buttocks may  also be used, 
if needed . 
The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for the fo llowing:
maintaini ng accurate records of investigational product dispensing
at the end of the study  returning all unused medication to Lilly ,or its desi gnee ,
unless the sponsor and sites have agreed all unused medicat ion is to be destroyed 
by [CONTACT_779], as allowed by [CONTACT_1769].
6.1.1. Medical Devices
The m anufactured medical devices provided for use in the study  areprefilled syringes.
6.2. Method of Treatment Assignment
Patients who m eet all cri teria for enrollment will be randomized to double -blind treatment at
Visit 3.  Assignment to treatm ent groups w ill be determined by a computer -generated random 
sequence using an interactive web -response system (IWRS).   The IWRS will be used to assi gn
doubl e
-blind investigat ional product to each patient. Site personnel will confirm that they  have
located the correct lyassigned package by [CONTACT_635331].
To achieve between -group com parabilit y, the randomizat ion will be stratified by  [CONTACT_635332] (<8 migraine headache day s versus ≥8 migraine headache days). To 
ensure an appropriate balance o f low-and high -frequency migraine headache day patients, the
sponsor willstop enrollment oflow-frequency patients ifthenumber exceeds anestimated 578.
6.2.1. Selection and Timing of Doses
This is a fixed- dose study .  The actual time of all dose administrations will be recorded in the 
patient’s electroni c case report form ( eCRF).
6.3. Blinding
This is a double -blind study .
To preserve the blinding of the study , a minimum number of Lilly  personnel  will see the 
rando mizat ion table and treatment assignments before the study  is complete.
I5Q-MC-CGAG Clinical Protocol Page 29 
LY2951742 Emergency unblinding for AEs may be performed through the IWRS.  This option may be used 
ONLY if the patient’s well-being requires knowledge of the patient’s trea tment assignment.  All 
unblinding events are recorded and reported by [CONTACT_10966]. 
If an investigator, site personnel performing a ssessments, or patient is unblinded, the patient 
must be discontinued from the study.  In cases wh ere there are ethical reas ons to have the patient 
remain in the study, the investigator must obtain specific approval from a Lilly clinical research 
physician (CRP) or clinical res earch scientist (CRS) for the pa tient to continue in the study. 
In case of an emergency, the inve stigator has the sole  responsibility for de termining if unblinding 
of a patient’s treatment assignm ent is warranted.  Patient safe ty must always be the first 
consideration in making such a determination.  If the investigator de cides that unblinding is 
warranted, the investigator should make every e ffort to contact [CONTACT_941] L illy CRP/CRS prior to 
unblinding a patient’s treatment a ssignment.  If a patient’s trea tment assignment is unblinded, 
Lilly must be notified immediately. 
6.4. Packaging and Labelling 
LY2951742 and matching placebo (excipi[INVESTIGATOR_190852]) will be supplied as an injectable solution in 
1-mL, single-dose, prefilled, disposable manual syri nges with study specific labels.  Each syringe 
of LY2951742 is designed to deliver LY 2951742 120 mg.  The syringes (and contents) 
containing either LY2951742 or placebo will be  visibly indistinguishable from each 
other.  Syringes will be supplied in cartons, with  the appropriate quantity of syringes specific to 
the planned dispensing schedule of investigational product. 
Clinical trial materials will be labeled according to the country’s regulatory requirements.  
6.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage 
Investigational product will be shipped (as prefilled syringes)  to sites using cold chain 
transportation.  Investigati onal product must be stable and stored  in a refrigerator at 2ºC to 8ºC 
(35.6ºF to 46.4ºF).  Approximately [ADDRESS_848824] exposure to bri ght light (such as sunlight) and hot  surfaces until administration. 
6.6. Dose Modification 
Dose modifications are not permitted in this study.  
6.6.1. Special Treatment Considerations 
During the post-treatment follow-up period, pa tients will not receive LY2951742 or placebo.  
One month after Visit 12, if clin ically warranted due to a worsening of symptoms, patients may 
start migraine prevention medications at the disc retion of the investigator.  The list of allowed 
preventive medications is provided separately. 
I5Q-MC-CGAG Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_848825] ivities
(Appendix 2 ).  If the invest igator is unable to administer the investigational product in the 
allowed window, the situation shoul dbe discussed with Lilly to determine if the patient may  
continue .
6.8. Concomitant Therapy
The list of medicat ions allowed or not allowed for the acute treatment of migraine, as well as 
those prohibited for the prevent ion of migraine, is provided inthe concomitant m edicat ion list in 
the concomitant medications study  tool, along wi th all  concomi tant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_635324] .Note that there are some limitat ions regarding conco mitant 
medicat ions for the acute treatment of mig raines during the study .  Any changes in the list of 
allowed/not allowed medications will be communicated to invest igators and will not constitute a 
protocol  amendment.
6.9. Treatment after Study Completion
6.9.1. Study Extensions
Not applicable.
6.9.2. Continued Access
Invest igational product will not be m ade available to patients after concl usion of the study .
I5Q-MC-CGAG Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_848826] during the doubl e-blind treatment 
phase ( Study  Period III )will proceed immediately to Study  Period IV.
7.1. Discontinuation from Study Treatment
7.1.1. Permanent Discontinuation from Study Treatment
Discontinuati on of  the invest igational product for abnormal liver tests should be considered by 
[CONTACT_47548] a pat ient meets one of the fo llowing condi tions af ter consul tation wi th the 
Lilly designated medical mo nitor:
ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >8X ULN
ALT or AST >5X ULN for more than 2 weeks
ALT or AST >3X ULN and TBL >2X ULN or prothrombin t ime >1.5X ULN

upper -quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%)
ALP >3X ULN
ALP >2.5X ULN and TBL >2X ULN
ALP >2.5XULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vo miting, r ight quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%)
Patients who discont inue the invest igational product early  will have end -of-therapy  (early 
termination) procedures performed as shown in the Schedule of Activit ies(Appendix 2 )and are 
requested to proceed into the post -treatm ent phase .
7.1.2. Temporary Discontinuation from Study Treatment
Not applicable.
7.1.3. Discontinuation of Inadvertently Enrolled Patients
If the sponsor or invest igator ident ify a pat ient who did not meet enrollment criteria and was 
inadvertent ly enro lled, a discussio n must occur between thesponsor CRP /CRS and the 
investigator to determine if the pat ient may continue in the study .  If both agree i t is medically  
appropriate to continue, the invest igator must obtain documented approval fro m the sponsor 
CRP /CRS to allow the inadvertent ly enro lled patient to continue in the study  with or wi thout 
treatm ent wi th invest igational product.
7.1.4. Permanent Discontinuation from the Study
Some possible reasons that may  lead to perm anent di scontinuat ion include:
I5Q-MC-CGAG Clinical Protocol Page 32
LY2951742Enrollment in any other clinical trial invo lving an investigational product or enrollment in 
any other ty pe of medical research j udged not to be sci entifically or medically co mpat ible 
with this study
Parti cipation in the study  needs to be stopped for medical, safet y, regul atory , or other 
reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and good clinical pract ice (GCP)
Invest igator Decisio n
othe invest igator decides that the patient should be discontinued from the study
oif the pat ient, for any  reason, requi res treatm ent with another therapeutic agent that 
has been demonstrated to be effect ive for the study indication (preventi on of  
migraine) during Study  Period III ,discontinuat ion from the study  occurs pri or to 
introducti on of  the new agent
Subject Decisio n
othe patient asks to be wi thdrawn from  the study
Patients who discont inue the study early will have end -of-study  (early  terminati on) procedures 
perform ed as shown in the Schedule of Act ivities(Appendix 2 )and are requested to proceed into 
the post -treatment p hase.
7.1.5. Patients Lost to Follow -Up
A pat ient willbe considered lost to fo llow-up if he or she repeatedly  fails to return for scheduled

8.1. Efficacy Assessments
8.1.1. Prima ry Efficacy Assessments 
ePRO Di ary:  Pati ents will be asked to use an ePRO device (starting at Visit 2) to record 
headache symptom s, durati on, and severit y.  The device also will be used to collect the name [CONTACT_635343] m edicat ions used for the acute treatment of migraine, and the use of other 
pain medicat ions.
8.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient Global Impression of Severity
The Pati ent Gl obal Impressi on of Severi ty (PGI -S) scale ( Guy 1976) is a pati ent-rated instrument 
that measures baseli ne illness severit y.  The PGI -S includes a range of possible responses, fro m 1 
(“normal, not at all ill”) to 7 (“extremely ill”).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient Global Impression of Improvement
The Pati ent Gl obal Impressi on of Improvement (PGI -I) scale ( Guy 1976) i s a patient -rated
instrum ent that m easures improvement of the patient’s symptoms.  It is a 7- point scale in which a 
score of 1 i ndicates the patient is “very  muchbetter ,” a score of 4 indicates the patient has 
experienced “no change,” and a score of 7 indicat es the pati ent is “very  much worse.”
8.1.3. Appropriateness of Assessments
All efficacy and safet y assessments have been well documented and are generally  regarded as
reliable, accurate, and relevant in this pat ient population .  This includes health outcom es 
meas ures considered to be appropriate for evaluat ing changes in qualit y of life, global 
funct ioning, and disabilit y(Secti on 8.9).
I5Q-MC-CGAG Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_848829] via eCRF the occurrence and nature of 
each patient’s pre-exist ing condit ion(s), including clinically significant signs and sympto ms of 
the disease under treatment in the study .  In addit ion, site personnel will record via eCRF any 
change in the condit ion(s) and any new condit ion(s)asAEs. Invest igators should record their 
assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to proto col procedure orinvest igational 
product via eCRF .
The invest igator will decide whether he or she interprets the observed AEs as reasonably 
possibly  related to migraine headache , to the investigat ional product, study  device, study  
procedure, or other concomitant treatment or pathologies.
The invest igator will answer y es/no when making this assessment.
Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the 
underlying medical condit ion has wor sened during the course of the study.
If a patient’s investigational product is discontinued as a result of an AE, study  site personnel  
must report this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF , clarifying if possible, the circumstances 
leading to discontinuations of treatment. 
8.2.1. Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  AE from this study  that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcom es:
death
initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]
a life- threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
I5Q-MC-CGAG Clinical Protocol Page 35
LY2951742congenital ano maly/birth defect
considered significant by  [CONTACT_92355]:  important medical 
events that may  not resul t in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_298945], based upon appropriate medical judgment.
when a condit ion related to the invest igational device ( for example, prefilled 
syringe) necessi tates m edical or surgi cal intervent ion to preclu de ei ther permanent 
impairment of a body  function or permanent damage to a body  structure, the 
serious outcom e of “requi red intervent ion” will be assigned.
Although all AEs after signing the ICF are recorded in the eCRF, SAE reporti ng begins after the 
patient has signed the ICF and has received investigational product.  However, if an SAE occurs 
after si gning the ICF, but prior to receiving investigational product, it needs to be reported 
ONLY if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study  procedu re.
Study  site personnel  must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of  any SAE within [ADDRESS_848830] igator 
awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method.  If alerts are issued via telephone, they 
are to be immediately fo llowed wi th official  notificati on on study -specific SAE forms.  This 24 -
hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE informat ion and all fo llow-up SAE 
inform ation.
Pregnancy ( during maternal or paternal exposure to invest igational product) does not meet the 
definit ion of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements ,any pregnancy that occurs 
during the study , including those in which conceptio n occurred within [ADDRESS_848831] 
discontinued and/or completed the study  (the patientsummary eCRF has been com pleted).  
However, if the invest igator lea rns of any  SAE, incl uding a death, at any  time after a patienthas 
been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably  possibly  related to the 
study  treatm ent or study  parti cipat ion, the invest igator m ust prom ptly notify Lilly .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Suspec ted Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as related to investigational product or procedure.  
[LOCATION_002] [ADDRESS_848832] ive 2001/20/EC and the 
associ ated detailed guidance or nati onal regulatory requi rements in parti cipat ing countries 
requi re the reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs . Lilly has procedures that will be fo llowed for the recording 
and expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent with glo bal regulat ions and the associated 
detailed guidance .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event Monitoring with a Systematic Questionnaire
Suicidali ty will be assessed as requi red by [CONTACT_635333] D rug Administration’s Divisio n of 
Neurol ogy for use in clinical trials invo lving all drugs for neurological indicat ions. Before 
administering the C-SSRS (Posner et al. 2011 ), study  site personnel  will quest ion the patient 
I5Q-MC-CGAG Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_848833] ing condit ion(s) and the occurrence and nature of any AEs.  
Nonserious AEs obtained through the questionnaire are recorded and analyzed separately. Only 
serious AEs and AEs leading to discont inuat ion elici ted through the C -SSRS are to be recorded 
as AEs vi a eCRF. Serious adverse events must be reported to Lilly  or its designee wi thin 
24hours as SAEs.   Any suicidal behavior, or suicidal ideat ion per items 4 or 5 (active suicidal 
ideat ion with som e intent to act, ei ther wi thout specific pl an or wi th specifi c plan and intent) 
woul d prom pt ref erral of the pati ent to a m ental  health prof essional.
8.2.2. Complaint Handling
Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in 
clinical studies in order to ensure the safet y of study  parti cipants, m onitor quali ty, and to 
facilitate process and product improvements.
Patients will  be instructed to contact [CONTACT_81129] a 
complaint or probl em wi th the invest igational product (or drug delivery  system such as a 
prefilled syringe ) so that the situation can be assessed.
8.3. Treatment of Overdose
No data are available at this stage of development.
8.4. Safety Assessments
8.4.1. Electrocardiograms
For each patient, a single, 12-lead digital ECG will be collected at the visits shown in the 
Schedule of Activities (Appendix 2 ). Electrocardi ogram s will have a central overread and 
shoul d be recorded according to th e study -specific recommendat ionsincluded in theECG
manual.   
Any clinically  significant findings from ECGs that result in a diagnosis should be reported to 
Lilly or i ts desi gnee as an AE viaeCRF.
8.4.2. Vital Signs
Vital signs will  include body  temperature, blood pressure, and pulse.  Blood pressure and pulse 
will be measured in triplicate in the sitt ing posit ion prior to bl ood draws and study drug 
administration (see Study  Schedule 
[Appendix 2]).
Any clinically  significant findings from vital signs measurement that result in a diagnosis should 
be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE viaeCRF .
8.4.3. Laboratory Tests
For each patient, laboratory testsdetailed in Appendix 3 shoul d be conducted accordi ng to the 
Schedule of Activities (Appendix 2 )
. 
Any clinically  significant findings from laboratory tests that resul t in a di agnosis shoul d be 
reported to Lilly  or its designee as an AE via eCRF .
I5Q-MC-CGAG Clinical Protocol Page 37
LY2951742In addit ion, an immunogenicit y plasma sample will be collected, when possible, for any  patient 
who experiences a potential systemic allergic/hypersensit ivity react ion during the study  as 
judged by  [CONTACT_3170]. This immunogenicit y plasma sample shoul d be co llected 
immediately  or as soon as possible, taking into consideration the availabilit y and wellbeing o f 
the pati ent. Exact date and time of the sample should be recorded on the laboratory requisit ion 
form.
8.4.4. Other Tests
Not applicable.
8.4.5. Safety Monitoring
Invest igators are responsible for monitoring in dividual  patient safety  throughout the tri al.If a 
study  patient/subject experiences elevated ALT ≥3X ULN, ALP ≥2X ULN, or elevated TBL 
≥2X ULN, clinical and laboratory  monitoring should be init iated by  [CONTACT_3170]. Details for 
hepat ic monitoring de pend upon the severit y and persistence of observed laboratory  test 
abnorm alities.To ensure patient/subject safet y and com ply wit h regulatory  guidance, the 
investigator is to consult with the Lilly CRP/CRS regarding collect ion of specific reco mmended 
clinical informat ion and fo llow-up laboratory  tests. See Appendix 4 .
Lilly will periodically  review evolving aggregate safet y data wi thin the study  by [CONTACT_529996]. In addit ion, safet y data for the trial will also be reviewed periodically by  [CONTACT_635334] (DMC; an advisory  group for thi s study  formed to 
protect the integrit y of data; refer to Interim Analyses sec tion[Secti on 9.8]). In the event that 
safet y monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by [CONTACT_602707], 
members of the DMC can request additional analyses of the safet y data.
8.5. Pharmacokinetics
At the visit s and t imes specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Appendix 2 ), venous blood
samples of approximately 2.[ADDRESS_848834] dose administration prior to blood 
sampling should be recorded .  The actual date and time (24-hour clock time )of each sampling 
will be recorded.   LY2951742 concentration informat ion that may/woul dunblind the study  will 
not be reported to invest igative sites or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded .  
Bioanaly tical samples collected to m easure invest igational product concentration will be retained 
for a maximum of [ADDRESS_848835] acebo should not be 
analyzed for determinat ion of serum concentrations of LY 2951742.

Samples will  be used for research on the drug target, disease process, pathways associated with 
migraine headache and/or other pain condit ions, mechanism  of action of LY2951 742, and/or 
research method or in validat ing diagnost ic tools or assay(s) related to migraine headache and/or 
other pain condit ions.
All biomarker samples will be coded with the patient number.  These samples and any  data 
generated can be linked back to th e patientonly by [CONTACT_10991].  Samples will 
be destroy ed according to a process consistent with local regulat ions.
Samples will  be retained for a m aximum  [ADDRESS_848837] LY2951742 as specified in the Schedule of 
Activities (Appendix 2 )
.Immunogenicit y will be assessed by a validated assay designed to 
detect anti -drug ant ibodies in the presence o f the investigational product.  Ant ibodies may be 
further characterized and/or evaluated for their abilit y to neutralize the activit y of LY2951742 .
Samples will  be retained for a m aximum  of [ADDRESS_848838] patient visit for the study , or 
for a shorter peri od if regulat ions and ERBs impose shorter time limits, at a facilit y selected by  
[CONTACT_456].  The duration allows the sponsor to respond to future re gulatory  requests rela ted to 
LY2951742.
8.9. Health Economics
Health economic , disabili ty and qualit yof life assessments of LY2951742 in patients with 
migraine will be based on the fo llowing scales:
Migraine Disability Assessment test (M IDAS ): The MIDAS was designed to quantify 
headache-related di sabili ty over a [ADDRESS_848839] the number of days reported as missing, or with reduced productivit y at work or hom e and 
social events ; a higher value is indicat ive of more disabilit y (Stewart 1999 ;Stewart 2001).  This 
instrum ent is considered highly  reliable and valid; and is correlated with clinical judgment 
regarding the need for medical care (Stewart 1999 ;Stewart 2001) . 
Migraine Specific Quality of Life questionnaire (MSQ v2.1): The MSQ v2.1 i s a self-
administered healt h status instrument, and was developed to address physical and emotional 
limitations of specific concern to individuals suffering fro m migraine headaches. The instrument 
consists of 14items that address 3 dom ains: (1) Role Functi on-Restrictive ;(2) Rol eFuncti on-
I5Q-MC-CGAG Clinical Protocol Page 40
LY2951742Preventive; and, (3) Em otional Function (Jhingran 1998). The instrument was designed with a 4-
week recall period, and is considered reliable, valid and sensit ive to change in migraine ( Jhingran 
1998; Rend as-Baum 2013). Clinically meaningful differences for each domain have been 
established and are widely used in the literature.
I5Q-MC-CGAG Clinical Protocol Page 41
LY29517429.Statistical Considerations and Data A nalysis
9.1. Determination of Sample Size
The study  will enroll approximately 825patients. Eligible pat ients will be randomized in 
blinded fashio nin a 2:1:1 ratio to placebo (target of 413 pat ients), LY2951742 120mg/month 
(target of 206 patients) , or 240mg/month (target of 206 pat ients).With the assumpt ion of a 26% 
discontinuat ion rate and an effect size o f 0.33, it is estimated that thissample size will provi de 
approximately  95% power that at l east 1 dose of LY2951742 will separate from placebo at a 
two-sided significance level of 0.05 based on simulat ions using Dunnett (Dunnett 1955) test.
Assumpt ions in the simulat ions werebased on data from two double -blind ,placebo -controlled ,
Phase [ADDRESS_848840] ical analysis plan (SAP) document.
Unless otherwise specified, analyses will be conducted on an intent -to-treat (ITT) populat ion, 
which will include all pat ients who are random ized and receive at least one dose of 
investigat ional product .  Patients in the ITT population will be analyzed according to the 
treatm ent group to whi ch they  are randomized. When change fro m baseline is assessed, the 
patient will be included in the analy sis only  if he/she has a baseline and a postbaseline 
measurement.
The primary  analys is will be performed using a restri cted m aximumlikelihood -based mixed 
models repeated m easures (MMRM) technique (Secti on 9.4.1 ).   
Visitwise binary efficacy  variables will be analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model 
(GLIMMIX) as pseudo -likelihood -based mixed effects repeated measures analysis .
In addit ion to the MMRM approach, analysis o f covariance (ANCOVA) model or analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) with the l ast observat ion carried forward (LOCF) will also be implemented. 
When an ANCOVA model is used to analyze a cont inuous variable, the model will contain the 
main effects of treatment and region, as well as the conti nuous fixed covariates of baseline.   The 
ANOVA model will use the same terms except the continuous fixed covariate of baseline.  
TypeIII sum -of-squares for the l east-squares means will be used for th e stati stical co mpar isons.
Continuous efficacy and health outcome endpo ints will be analyzed using MMRM methods, as 
well as an ANCOVA model wit h LOCF imputation if deemed appropriate. 
Categorical co mpar isons between treatment groups will be performed usin g Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel (CMH) controlling for region orusing the Fisher ’sexact test, where appropriate.
I5Q-MC-CGAG Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_848841] ification for making the change, will be described 
in the clinical study  report.  Changes may only be made in the SAP prior to unblinding. 
Addit ional exploratory  analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate.
9.3. Treatment Group Comparability
9.3.1. Patient Disposition
The number and percentage of ITT patients who complete the study or discontinue early will be 
summariz ed for all  treatm ent groups for Study  Period III (double -blind treatment) and Study  
Period IV (post -treatm ent follow-up) both overall and by [CONTACT_765]. 
Patient allocation by  [CONTACT_635335]. 
Patient allocation by  [CONTACT_635336].
9.3.2. Patient Characteristics
The fo llowing pati ent characteri stics at baseline will be summarized by  [CONTACT_355709] :
Dem ographic (age, gender, ethnic origin, height, weight, body mass index )
Migraine headache, headache ,variation of migraine/headache measures per 30 -
day baseline period.
Alcoho l
,tobacco , caffeine and nicotine consumption
Medical history  and pre-exist ing condit ion
Medical history and pre -exist ing condit ions will be summarized by [CONTACT_635337] (SOC) . 
9.3.3. Concomitant Therapy
The proporti on of  patients who received conco mitant medicat ion (as recorded viaeCRF )as well 
as abortive medicat ions (recorded through ePRO )will be summarized for all ITT patients for 
Study  Period III and Stud y Period IV separately.
9.3.4. Treatment Compliance
Not applicable.
I5Q-MC-CGAG Clinical Protocol Page 43
LY29517429.3.5. Electronic Patient -reported Outcome Diary Compliance
ePRO di ary com pliance at each period (including baseline, Month 1, 2, 3, … till Month 10) will 
be calculated.  Diary  com pliance at each period is calculated as:
Actual  number  of diary  days  in the  period
Expected  number  of diary  days  in the  period∗100
Actu al number of di ary days is calculated as the total number of days wit h non -missing answers. 
9.4. Primary  and Secondar y Anal yses
9.4.1. Primary Analyses
The primary  efficacy  measure is the overall mean change from the baseline period in the number 
of monthly migraine headache day sduring the 6-month double -blind treatm ent phase , and t he 
primary  analysis will evaluate the efficacy of LY2951742 (120 or 240 mg/month)compared wi th 
placebo . 
The primary  analys iswill be performed using a restricted maximum likelihood -based mixed 
models repeated m easures technique.  The analysis will include the fixed categorical effects of 
treatm ent, region , month, and treatm ent-by-month interact ion, as well as the continuous fix ed 
covari ates of baseline number of migraine headache day s and baseline number of migraine 
headache days -by-monthinteracti on.  
An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model wit hin-patient errors. The Kenward -
Roger (Kenward and Roger 1997) a pproximat ion will be used to estimate deno minator degrees 
of freedo m. If the model does not converge with both the Hessian and the G matrix being 
positive definite under the default fitting algorithm used by [CONTACT_390523], the Fisher scoring 
algorithm will be implemented by  [CONTACT_355715]. If the model st ill 
fails to converge, the model will be fit using covariance matrices o f the following order specified 
by a decreasing number of covariance parameters unt il convergence is met: 
Hetero geneous Toeplitz 
Heterogeneous First -order autoregressive 
Toeplitz 
First-order autoregressive 
When the unstructured covariance matrix is not utilized, the sandwich estimator (Diggle and 
Kenward 1994) will be used to estimate the standard errors of the fixed effects parameters.  The 
sandwich est imator is implemented by [CONTACT_140829][INVESTIGATOR_355682]®.  When the 
sandwich est imator is utilized, the Kenward -Roger approximat ion for denominator degrees of 
freedo m cannot be used.  Instead, the deno mina tor degrees of freedom will be partit ioned into 
between -subject and within -subject portions by  [CONTACT_355716]=BETWITHIN option in SAS®.  
SAS®PROC MIXED will be used to perform the analysis.
I5Q-MC-CGAG Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_848842] ives (see Table CGAG. 1) will be tested using a nappropri ate m ultiple 
testing approach providing strong control of the familywise error rate (for the primary and key 
secondary  tests) at a one -sided 0.025 alpha level (or, equivalent ly, two -sided 0.05 alpha level).  
Details o f the specific testing methodology  (including testing order, relationship and t ype I error 
allocat ionand propagati on)will be specified in the SAP.  
The key  secondary  measures will be analyzed for the double- blind treatment ( Study Period 
III).
For the conti nuous key secondary  measures, the change fro m baseline during the 6 -month
doubl e-blind treatment phase will be analyzed from repeated measur es analyses .For the analysis 
of 50% , 75%, and 100% response, the percentage of patients meet ing response criteria during the 
6-month double -blind treatment phase will be est imated for each treatment fro m a categori cal, 
pseudo -likelihood -based repeated measures analysis of lo ngitudinal binary  outcom es indicating 
whether patients meet response criteria. This analysis will be implemented using the GLIMMIX 
procedure in SAS .
9.4.3. Other Secondary and Tertiary Efficacy Analyses
Theother secondary  and exploratory  efficacy analyses will be conducted for the doubl e
-blind 
treatm ent phase, and for the double -blind treatment and post -treatm ent follow-up phases ( Study 
Period III and Study Period IV )combined.   Further details regarding other secondary  and terti ary 
effica cy analyses are summarized in the SAP.
9.5. Safety Analyses
The safet y analys es will  be conducted for the double- blind treatment and post -treatm ent follow-
up phases, as well as the two peri odscombined.  For the two phases combined, only repeated 
measures and t ime-to-event analys es will  be conducted.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Categorical Safety Variables
Unless specified otherwise, the categorical safet y analyses will include both schedule and 
unscheduled visits.
Com parisons between treatment groups for all categorical safet y measures will be made using 
the Fisher ’sexact test for S tudy Period III (double -blind treatment) withtheITT populat ion.  
Descript ive statistics only will be presented for the treatment groups in the post -treatm ent 
follow-up phase ( Study Period IV )with the post-treatment popul ation.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events
Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as the reported AEs that first occurred or 
worsened during the postbaseline phase co mpared with baseline phase.  For each TEAE, the 
severit y level o f the event (mild, moderate, o r severe) will be determined by [CONTACT_229509][INVESTIGATOR_3078] n.  The Medi cal Dict ionary for Regul atory  Activities(MedDRA ) Lowest Level Term will 
be used in the treatment -emergent computation.  For each Lowest Level Term , the m aximum  
severit y at baseline wil l be used as the baseline severit y.  If the maximum severit y during 
postbaseline is greater than the maximum baseline severit y, the event is considered to be 
treatm ent-emergent for the specific postbaseline period.  For each patient and TEAE, the 
maximum s everi ty for the MedDRA l evel being displayed (Preferred Term, High Level Term, or

non-fatal suicide attem pt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory  acts or behavior, 
active suicida l ideat ion with specific plan and intent, active suicidal ideat ion with som e intent to 
act wi thout specific plan, active suicidal ideat ion with any methods (not pl an) wi thout intent to 
act, non -specific act ive suicidal thoughts, wish to be dead, and non -suicidal self -injuri ous 
behavior.   
In addition, the number and percentage of patients w ho experienced at least one of the
composite measures during Study  Period III and Study  Period IV separately will be presented

10.2.1. Data Capture System
An electronic data capture sy stem  will be used in this study .  The si te maintains a separate source 
for the data ente red by  [CONTACT_92363] -provided electronic data capture system.
Some or all  of a patient’s data will be direct ly entered into the eCRF at the time the i nformation 
is obtained. In instances where direct data ent ry is not used, the site will main tain source 
docum entati on in the tri al files ,and the patient’s data will  be transcribed into the eCRF. Any 
data for whi ch the eCRF will serve as the source document, or any  other data not entered direct ly 
into the eCRF, will be identified and documented by [CONTACT_635341] ’s trial  file. For data 
handled by  a data m anagement TPO, eCRF data and some or all data that are related will be 
managed and stored electronically in the TPO system. Subsequent to the final database lock, 
validated data will be tra nsferred to the sponsor. For data handled internally, eCRF data and 
some or all data that are related will be managed by [CONTACT_635342] ’s system .
In thi s study , pati ent migraine headache data will be collected directl y via an ePRO diary as part 
of an ePRO/Clinical Outcome Assessment (COA) system. Patient -rated scales/quest ionnaires 
will be co llected direct ly via an ePRO tablet device at each visit. Data entered into the 
ePRO/COA system will serve as the source data.
If ePRO/COA records are stored at a third -party  site, investigator sites will have continuous 
access to the source documents during the study  and will receive an archival copy  at the end of 
the study  for retenti on.
Any data for which the ePRO/COA instrumen t record will serve to collect source data will be 
ident ified and documented by [CONTACT_140842]’s study file.
Case report form data will be encoded and stored in a clinical trial database.   
Data m anaged by  a central  vendor, such as laboratory  test data or ECG data, will be stored 
electroni cally in the central vendor’s database syst em.  Data will subsequent ly be transferred 
from the central  vendor to the Lilly data warehouse . Data from complaint forms submitted to 
Lilly will be encoded and stored i n the gl obal product com plaint m anagement system .

Term Definition
AE adverse event:  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal 
relatio nship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or 
not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.
complaint A complaint is any written, ele ctronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies 
related to the identity, quality, purity, durability, reliability, safety or effectiveness, or 
performance of a drug or drug delivery system.
CRP/CRS Lilly  Clinical Research Physician/Clinical Research Scientist
enroll The act of assigning a patient to a treatment.  Patients who are enrolled in the trial are 
those who have been assigned to a treatment.
enter Patients entered into a trial are those who sign the informed consent form directly or
through their legally acceptable representatives .
ePRO electronic patient -reported outcomes
interim analysis An interim analysis is an analysis of clinical study data, separated into treatment groups, 
that is conducted before the final reporting database is created/locked.
investigational 
productApharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a 
reference in a clinical trial , incl uding products already on the market when used or 
assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the authorized form, or 
marketed products used for an unauthorized indication, or marketed products used to 
gain further information about the auth orized form.
ITT intent to treat : The principle that asserts that the effect of a treatment policy can be best 
assessed by [CONTACT_56620] o n the basis of the intention to treat a patient (that is, the planned 
treatment regimen) rather than the actual treatme nt given.  It has the consequence that 
patients allocated to a treatment group should be followed up, assessed ,and analyzed as 
members of that group irrespective of their compliance to the planned course of 
treatment.
IWRS interactive web-response sy stem
SAE serious adverse event
TEAE treatment -emergent adverse event : Any untoward medical occurrence that either occurs 
or worsens at any time after treatment baseline and thatdoes not necessarily have to 
have a causal relationship with this treatment .

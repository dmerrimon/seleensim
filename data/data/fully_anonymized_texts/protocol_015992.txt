Protocol Version Date: 14Apr2020  1.[ADDRESS_491982] cancers (BTCs) include malignant intrahepatic and extrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinomas, gallbladder and ampullary cancers. It is estimated that 12,190 
patients will be diagnosed with BTCs in 2018 in United Sta tes. (Siegel et al. 2018) Most 
patients with BTCs present with unresectable or metastatic disease. Even in patients with 
resectable disease, the recurrences are frequent. The median survival of patients with 
advanced BTCs is less than 4.5  months. (Glimelius et al. 1996; Sharma et al. 2010) 
Combination gemcitabine and cisplatin has been established as first line standard of care treatment based on the Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer -02 (ABC-02) phase III trial.  
(Valle et al. 2010) Unfortunately, the median overall survival (OS) was less than a year in 
this trial. There is no FDA-approved second line option for patients with advanced BTCs. 
There is a huge unmet need to develop novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_391822]. 
1.2 Trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384380]/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_105894] a novel oral nucleoside consisting of α, α, α -trifluorothymidine 
(trifluridine) and 5 -chloro-6- (2-iminopyrrolidin-1- yl) methyl -2,4 (1H,3H)-
pyrimidinedione hydrochloride (tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965]). The active antitumor component is trifluridine which inhibits thymidylate synthase and is incorporated into DNA in tumor cells. 
Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_105894] a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor which prevents trifluridine from 
degradation. Theref ore, trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391823] 5 -
fluorouracil (5 -FU). 
The clinical safety and efficacy of trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391824] ( mCRC). 
(Mayer et al. 2015)  A total of 800 patients were randomized to receive 
trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391825] (BSC) or placebo plus BSC. Patients 
received 35 mg/m
2 trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391826] D ays [ADDRESS_491983] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The median OS was 7.1 months with 
trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391827] 5.3 months in the placebo group (haza rd ratio: 0.68; 
95% CI: 0.56-0.78). Median PFS was 2 months in trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_384411] 1.7 
months in placebo group (hazard ratio: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.41-0.57). Common adverse 
events included fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia and cytopenias. In addition, 
trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391828] 
[ADDRESS_491984] two prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. (Shitara et al. 2018) 
The clinical activity of trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391829]. A phase I trial of trifluridin e/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391830] 17 patients with mCRC did not observe dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) with 23.5% Grade 3/4 neutropenia, 5.9% Grade 3/4, and 5.9% peripheral sensory 
neuropathy. These results were comparable to historical control. The recommended dose 
for phase II study was trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965] 35 mg/m
2 BID (Days 1 -5 every 2 weeks) with 
oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 (Day 1). Eight (47%) patients had stable disease. One (2.1%) 
MC1941 6  MCCC Amendment 1  
Protocol Version Date: 14Apr2020  patient had a partial response. (Hollebecque et al. 2018) The combination of 
trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391831] 26 patients with advanced 
gastrointestinal tumors. The majority of patients had CRC (81%) whose disease 
progressed after at least one previous line of therapy. The study declared the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) as trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965] 25 mg/m2 on Days 1-5 and irinotecan 
180 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 14- day cycle based on two observed DLTs (Grade 3 fatigue 
and Grade 2 neutropenia) in the trifl uridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965] 30 mg/m2 and irinotecan 180 mg/m2 
cohort. In the subsequent dose expansion cohort of 24 patients with refractory mCRC 
treated with trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965], irinotecan, and bevacizumab, 10 (42%) patients had 
Grade 3/4 neutropenia, 3 (12.5%) patients had Grade 3/4 diarrhea. Three (12.5%) patients 
had a partial response and the disease control rate was 83% with median PFS of 7.9 months. (Varghese et al. 2018a; Varghese et al. 2018b) 
1.[ADDRESS_491985] that they are not FDA approved. (Huggett et al. 2014; Rogers et al. 2014) In retrospective studies, fluoropyri midine based treatments have been 
shown to be associated with improved survival. (Huggett et al. 2014)  However, there are 
only limited small prospective studies reported utilizing fluoropyrimidines. Single agent 5-FU in early trials has yielded response rates of 10% with median OS of approximately 
[ADDRESS_491986] lin e treatment. (Choi et al. 2000) S- 1, a combination of tegafur (that is 
converted to 5-FU in the liver), 5-chloro-2,4- dihydroxypyridine (inhibitor of 
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase) and potassium oxonate has also shown modest activity in advanced BTCs as a single agent. (Ueno et al. 2004) The same applies to 
single agent irinotecan as demonstrated in a small pha se 2 trial where the response rate of 
advanced BTCs was 8%. (Sanz -Altamira et al. 2001)  
Combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3066] 5- FU or capecitabine plus irinotecan as 2
nd-line therapy 
for advanced BCTs are associated with better response rates at the expense of increased toxicities. The combination of 5- FU and  irinotecan in an early trial demonstrated a 
response rate of 10% in 17 patients. (Feisthammel et al. 2007) A more recent randomized 
phase 2 trial compared capecitabine plus irinotecan with irinotecan alone as 2
nd-line 
therapy in 60 patients with advanced BTCs. The authors found that the capecitabine plus irinotecan arms showed a significantly higher response rate of 13.3% vs 6.7% and disease 
control rate of 63% vs 50% with a similar toxicity profile , other than hand- foot syndrome 
which is unique to capecitabine. (Zheng et al. 2018) Addition of other agents to this 
combination in the [ADDRESS_491987] non- superior activity but 
significantly increased to xicities. (Larsen et al. 2018; Guion- Dusserre et al. 2015)  These 
studies suggest that there may be a role for fluoropyrimidines in combination with 
irinotecan in advanced BTCs.  
The mechanism of trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391832], which provided 
several advantages over 5 -FU. Clinically with a twice daily dosing schedule of 
trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965], incorporation into DNA is the primary mechanism of action for antitumor effects instead of thymidine synthase inhibition when it was given with 
continuous infusion as 5-FU. Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_105894] a potent inhibitor of thymidine phosphorylase, 
which is the enzyme that degrades trifluridine and helps maintain adequate plasma 
concentration needed for its activity. Thereby, the antitumor activity of trifluridine is more sustained compared to 5-FU, whose inhibition of thymidylate synthase rapi[INVESTIGATOR_391833]. (Lenz et al. 2015; Tanaka et al. 2014) 
Trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391834]1941 7  MCCC Amendment 1  
Protocol Version Date: 14Apr2020  tumors. (Emura et al. 2004a; Emura et al. 2004b) The primary mechanism of resistance to 
5-FU seems to be the decrease in activity of orotate phosphoribosyl transferase resulting 
in decrease in cellular uptake of 5 -FU in the RNA fraction. (Murakami et al. 2000) There 
is no change in thymidylate synthase level. Trifluridine has demonstrated activity in 5- FU 
resistant colorectal and gastric cancer cell lines, as activity of trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391835]. (Lenz et al. 2015) Autophagy has also shown to play a role in resistance to 5 -FU but not to trifluridine. (Bijnsdorp et al. 2010)  
The potential superiority of tr ifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391836] 5 -FU has also be implicated in a 
randomized phase 2 trial of trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391837] -line therapy in patients with metastatic CRC who were not 
eligible for intensive ther apy. The trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391838] 18.0 months versus 16.1 months in the capecitabine plus bevacizumab arm 
with HR 0.56 (95% CI: 0.32-0.98). (Lesniewski -Kmak et al. 2018)  
Our group (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_391839]) has recently completed accrual of [ADDRESS_491988] 2018 to a phase 2 trial evaluating the si ngle-agent activity of 
trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391840] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Eligible patients had at least one gemcitabine- based chemotherapy and were treated with trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391841] 35 mg/m
2 bid, D ays 1 -5 and 8-12 of a 28– day cycle. All patients received at 
least one ( 1) cycle of trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965]. Median number of cycles received was 3 
(range 1 -8). The most common G rade 3 or worse adverse events were neutrophil count 
decreased (44.4%), anemia (22.2%), alkaline phosph atase increased (22.2%), blood 
bilirubin increased (18.5%), and white blood cell decreased (18.5%), without any 
unexpected safety signals. Among [ADDRESS_491989] response 
was stable disease in 13 (48%) patients. PFS rate at 16 w eeks was 9/27 [33.3%; 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 16.5-54.0%]. Median PFS and OS were 3.9 (2.0-6.7) and 6.8 (5.8-12.3) months, respectively.

1.4 Study Design  
This is a single -arm, phase 2 trial to assess the efficacy of trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391845], refractory BTCs. The primary endpoint of this study is 16- week 
PFS rate . If 30% of patients remain progression- free at 16-weeks, this trial will be 
considered a success warranting bigger trials. A two -stage phase II design will be 
utilized. In the first stage, 15 patients will be enrolled. If 2 or more patients are progression-free and alive at 16 weeks, additional 10 patients will be enrolled. If 5 or fewer patients out of 25 evaluable patients remain progression -free at 16 weeks then the 
regimen  will be considered ineffective. The total sample size of this study is 28 to 
account for 3 possible non- evaluable subjects.  Patient will receive trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391841] 25 mg/m
2 on Days 1-5 and irinotecan 180 mg/m2 on D ay 1of each 14- day 
cycle. Patient will receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. 
Patients will undergo restaging scans ev ery [ADDRESS_491990] blood samples for determination of cell- free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating 
tumor cells (CTCs) at baseline, after [ADDRESS_491991] tumor 
biopsy specimens before treatment initiation to develop patient-derived tumor organoid.

a. Identify the grade and severity of the event using the CTCAE version 5.0. 
b. Det
ermine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2). 
c. Determine if the adverse event is related to the study intervention (agent, treatment or procedure) (see Section 10.3). 
d. Determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report. If yes, determi ne the timeframe/mechanism (see Section 10.4).  
e. Determine if other reporting is required (see Section 10.5).  
f. Note: All AEs reported via expedited mechanisms must also be reported via the routine data reporting mechanisms defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10.6 and 
18.0). 
NOTE: A severe AE is NOT the same as a serious AE, which is defined in Section 10.4.  
10.2 Expected vs. Unexpected Events  
Expected events - are those described within the Section 15.0 of the protocol, the study 
specific consent form, pac kage insert (if applicable), and/or the investigator brochure, (if 
an investigator brochure is not required, otherwise described in the general investigational plan).  
Unexpected adverse events or suspected adverse reactions are those not listed in Section  
15.0 of the protocol, the study specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), or in 
the investigator brochure (or are not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed); if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with

administration site conditions . Evidence that the death was a manifestation 
of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth 
or progression: clini cal deterioration associated with a disease process) 
should be submitted. 
10.53 Secondary Malignancy  
• A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation 
or che motherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of 
the initial neoplasm.  
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under 
an IND will be reported. Three options are available to describe the event:  
o Neoplasms b enign, malignant and unspecified, (incl cysts and polyps) 
Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute Myeloctyic Leukemia [AML])  
o Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified, (incl cysts and polyps) 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
o Neoplasms beni gn, malignant and unspecified, (incl cysts and polyps) 
Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
• Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) 
should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each 
protocol.  
10.54 Second Malignancy  
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY 
routine reporting unless otherwise specified.

immediately. The patient should have appropriate follow- up as deemed necessary 
by [CONTACT_140711]. If the baby [CONTACT_170727] a birth defect or anomaly, a second 
expedited report is required. 
Prior to obtaining private information about a p regnant woman and her infant, the 
investigator must obtain consent from the pregnant woman and the newborn 
infant’s parent or legal guardian before any data collection can occur. A consent form will need to be submitted to the IRB for these subjects if a pregnancy 
occurs. If informed consent is not obtained, no information may be collected. 
In cases of fetal death, miscarriage or abortion, the mother is the patient. In cases 
where the child/fetus experiences a serious adverse event other than fetal death, 
the child/fetus is the patient.

1. Death due to disease progression:  
Disease progression (radiologic or clinical) with the outcome of death will not be 
reported as an SAE. However, relevant signs, symptoms and complications of disease progression (radiologic or clinical) must be reported as an AE or SAE if 
it meets the serious criteria. It should be indicated that the signs, symptoms and 
complications are relat ed to disease progression. 
2. Death due to other causes: 
Deaths due to reasons other than disease progression must be reported as an SAE. 
Death is not an acceptable AE/SAE term. Death is an outcome of an SAE.  
When reporting a death, the investigator will be required to identify which of the 
following best describes the category of death: 
• Toxicity for study drugs  
• Radiologic disease progression  
• Clinical disease progression  
• Other causes  
10.82 Disease Progression  
How to report events related to non- fatal disease progression: 
a. Disease progression is not an acceptable AE term. In cases of non -fatal disease 
progression, the relevant signs, symptoms and complications should be reported 
as an AE unless they meet the serious criteria. If any of the signs, symptoms and 
complications meets any of the serious criteria, they should be reported as an 
SAE. In both cases it should be indicated whether the signs, symptoms and 
complications are related to disease progression.  
b. Radiologic disease progression without relevan t signs, symptoms and 
complications will not  be reported as an AE or SAE.

medicati on, nature of the medication, route of administration, dosage or 
frequency of the treatment as specified in this protocol (including omission of 
one or more administrations). 
• Medication errors with study drugs and concomitant medication 
treatment will not be reported unless they result in an AE. 
• Medication errors with study drugs that result in an overdose will be reported as an AE.  
• Medication errors with study drugs that do not result in an AE should be handled as follows: 
− If it results in the omission o f an administration, an incorrect dose 
(relative to that specified in this protocol), or the administration of more than the prescribed dose (but does not meet the overdose criteria), it will 
be identified through the recording of study drug accountability data in 
the CRF and does not need to be reported as an AE. 
− If it results in an overdose, incorrect route of administration, or 
administration of an incorrect study drug, it will be reported as an AE.

An overdose with trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391868]:  
• Taking a dose beyond the recommended dose in 1 day or beyond the 
recommended total dose in each cycle.

Protocol Version Date: 14Apr2020  11.0 Treatment Evaluation /Measurement of Effect   
NOTE: This study uses protocol RECIST v1.1 template dated 2/16/2011. See the footnote for the  
table regarding measurable disease in Section 11.44, as it pertains to data collection and analysis.  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guidelines 
(version 1.1) (Eisenhauer et al)13. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) 
of the tumor lesions and the short axis measurements in the case of lymph nodes are used i n the 
RECIST guideline. 
11.[ADDRESS_492015] diameter can 
be accurately measured as ≥2.[ADDRESS_492016] x- ray, or as ≥1.[ADDRESS_492017] component of a PET/CT, or MRI.  
11.[ADDRESS_492018] diameter is 
≥1.0 cm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules) or 
imaging. In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended. 
11.213 A malignant lymph node is considered measurable if its short axis is 
>1.[ADDRESS_492019] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). 
NOTE: Tu mor lesions in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable 
disease under the following conditions: 
a) New lesion that has developed after radiation is completed b) Definite increase in the size of the previously irradiated lesion.  
11.22  Non-Measurable Disease  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) are considered non- measurable disease, 
including pathological nodes (those with a short axis ≥1.0 to <1.5 cm). Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/ pericardial effusions, lymphangit is cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses 
(not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non- measurable as well.  
Note: ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. 
However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions. In addition, lymph nodes that have a short axis <1.0 cm are considered non- pathological (i.e., normal) and should not be 
recorded or followed.

MC1941 35  MCCC Amendment 1  
Protocol Version Date: 14Apr2020  11.3  Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
11.31  Measurement Methods:  
• All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (i.e., decimal 
fractions of centimeters) using a ruler or calipers.  
• The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. For patients having only lesions measuring at least [ADDRESS_492021]-treatment tumor 
assessments.  
• Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_391905] a treatment.  
11.32  Acceptable Modalities for Measurable Disease:  
Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_492022] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
• As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type 
and site of disease. The lesions should be measured on the same pulse sequence. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. 
Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if 
possible. 
• PET-CT: If the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET- CT 
is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral 
contrast), then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for RECIST 
measurements and can be used interchangeably w ith conventional CT in 
accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  
• Chest X -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT scans are preferable.  
• Physical Examinat ion: For superficial non-nodal lesions, physical 
examination is acceptable, but imaging is preferable, if both can be done. In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
• FDG -PET: FDG -PET scanning is allowed to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progressive disease [PD] and particularly possible 'new' disease. A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scanned lesion is defined as one which is 
FDG avid with an update greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image; otherwise, an FDG- PET scanned lesion is 
considered ‘negative.’ New lesions on the basis of FDG- PET imaging can be 
identified according to the following algorithm: 
a. Negative FDG -PET at base line with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a 
sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:

Protocol Version Date: 14Apr2020  i. If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  
ii. If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT at the same evaluation, additional follow- up CT scans 
(i.e., additional follow -up scans at least 4 weeks later) are needed to 
determine if there is truly progression occurri ng at that site. In this 
situation, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal PDG-
PET scan.  
iii. If the positive FDG -PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing. 
11.33  Measurement at Follow -up Evaluation: 
A subsequent scan must be obtained 8 weeks following initial documentation of an objective status of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).  
In the case of stable disease (SD), follow -up measurements must have met the 
SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 8 weeks (see 
Section 11.44). 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears 
or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or 
stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive 
disease.  
• Cytologic and histologic techniques can be used to differentiate between PR 
and CR in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain.) 
11.[ADDRESS_492023]  
11.41  Target Lesions & Target Lymph Nodes 
• Measurable lesions (as defined in Section 11.21) up to a maximum of 5 
lesions representative of all involved organs, should be identified as “Target Lesions” and recorded and measured at baseline. These lesions can be non -
nodal or nodal (as defined in 11.21), where no more than 2 lesions are from 
the same organ and no more than 2 malignant nodal lesions are selected. 
Note:  If fewer than 5 target lesions and target lymph nodes are identified (as 
there often will be), there is no reason to perform additional studies beyond those specified in the protocol to discover new lesions. 
• Target lesions and target lymph nodes should be selected on the basis of their size, be representative of all involved sites of disease, but in addition should 
be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may 
be the case t hat, on occasion, the largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurements in which circumstance the next largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected. 
• Baseline Sum of Dimensions (BSD): A sum of the longest diameter for all 
target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of dimensions (BSD). The 
MC1941 37  MCCC Amendment 1  
Protocol Version Date: 14Apr2020  BSD will be used as reference to further charac terize any objective tumor 
response in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
• Post-Baseline Sum of the Dimensions (PBSD): A sum of the longest 
diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target 
lymph nodes will be calculated and reported as the post -baseline sum of 
dimensions (PBSD). If the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure for the target lesion (or target lymph node), that should be recorded, even if it is below 0.5 cm. If the target lesion (or target lymph node) is believed to be 
present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 0.[ADDRESS_492024] that the target lesion 
or target lymph node has likely disappeared, the measurement should be 
recorded as 0 cm.  
• The minimum sum of the dimensions (MSD) is the minimum of the BSD and 
the PBSD.  
11.42  Non-Target Lesions & Non -Target Lymph Nodes 
Non-measurable sites of disease (Section 11.22) are classified as non - target 
lesions or non- target lymph n odes and should also be recorded at baseline. These 
lesions and lymph nodes should be followed in accord with 11.433. 
11.[ADDRESS_492025]/MRI/PET-CT/Chest X -ray/physical exami nation must be measured on re-
evaluation at evaluation times specified in Section 11.1. Specifically, a change in objective status to either a PR or CR cannot be done without 
re-measuring target lesions and target lymph nodes. 
Note:  Non -target lesions and non-target lymph nodes should be 
evaluated at each assessment, especially in the case of first response or confirmation of response. In selected circumstances, certain non- target 
organs may be evaluated less frequently. For example, bone scans may need to be repeated only when complete response is identified in target 
disease or when progression in bone is suspected. 
11.432 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR): All of the following must be true:  
a. Disappearance of all target lesions.  
b. Each target lymph node must have reduction in short axis to 
<1.0 cm. 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of the 
longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short 
axis of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as 
reference the BSD (see Section 11.41).  
Progression (PD) : At least one of the following must be true: 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any 
lymph node that was normal at baseline (<1.0 cm short axis) 
and increased to ≥1.0 c m short axis during follow-up. 
MC1941 38  MCCC Amendment 1  
Protocol Version Date: 14Apr2020  b. At least a 20% increase in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter 
for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the 
target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference the 
MSD (Section 11.41). In addition, the PBSD must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 0.5 cm from the 
MSD.  
c. See Section 11.32 for details in regards to the requirements for 
PD via FDG -PET imaging.  
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, 
nor su fficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the 
MSD.  
11.433 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions & Non -target Lymph Nodes 
Complete Response (CR): All of the following must be true:  
a. Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
b. Each non- target lymp h node must have a reduction in short 
axis to <1.0 cm. 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target lesions or 
non-target lymph nodes. 
Progression (PD) : At least one of the following must be true: 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any 
lymph node that was normal at baseline (<1.0 cm short axis) 
and increased to ≥1.0 cm short axis during follow -up. 
b. Unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions and 
non-target lymph nodes. (NOTE: Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion and target lymph node 
status. It must be representative of overall disease status 
change.) 
c. See Section 11.32 for details in regards to the requirements for 
PD via FDG -PET imaging.  
11.44  Overall Objective Status

11.45  Symptomatic Deterioration  
Patients with global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time, and  not 
either related to study treatment or other medical conditions, should be reported as PD due to “symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment due to 
symptomatic de terioration. A patient is classified as having PD due to 
“symptomatic deterioration” if any of the following occur that are not either related to study treatment or other medical conditions: 
• Weight loss >10% of body weight. 
• Worsening of tumor- related symptoms. 
• Decline in performance status of >1 level on ECOG scale.

Protocol Version Date: 14Apr2020  14.5 Background and Methodology 
14.51 ctDNA 
Detection of cancer specific mutations from the peripheral blood is an area of 
active investigation in many different type s of cancers. An accumulating body of 
literature confirms an excellent correlation between mutations found in cancer tissues and mutations detected in cfDNA from the same patients.  (Kim et al. 
2015) Changes in cfDNA also correlate well with tumor marker dynamics in 
serial sampling, suggesting that cfDNA mutant allele fraction changes reflect 
changes in disease burden over time and treatment. Plasma based DNA mutation 
detection should therefore provide longitudinal changes in the representative 
genomic landscape of the malignancy in a non -invasive manner, overcoming the 
two major limitations of tissue based DNA mutation analysis (invasiveness and 
limited sampling from a genetically heterogeneous tumor). (Diehl et al. 2005; 
Diehl et al. 2008; Dawson et al. 2013)  
[ADDRESS_492030] cancer.  (Liu et 
al. 2009; Liu 2014) Bey ond simple enumeration, molecular profiling of these 
cells may provide clinically relevant predictive information to guide the selection of therapy. Deriving detailed molecular signatures for isolated CTCs may also 
facilitate drug discovery by [CONTACT_391909], such 
that relapsing patients may be treated for their current molecular disease.  
The RareCyte CTC technology is a comprehensive, reproducible and highly 
sensitive dual -platform for collecting, identifying and analyzing CTCs that does 
not rely on EpCAM expression for enrichment.6 The front end AccuCyte system is based fundamentally on the density of CTCs, which is within the range of the 
buffy coat; a unique separation tube and collector device allow for virtually 
complete harvesting of the buffy coat into a small volume for application to a microscopic slide without cell lysis or wash steps, a potential source of CTC loss. 
The follow-up CyteFinder system is an automated scanning digital microscope 
and image analysis system that presents high -resolution images of candidate cells 
stained with well- characterized markers before definitive classification as a CTC. 
Importantly, CyteFinder includes an integrated device (CytePi[INVESTIGATOR_188817]™) for CTC 
retrieval that is mechanically precise, enabling the isolation of DNA derived from 
single or pooled CTCs advanced genomic analyses including the detection of specific mutations and targeted NGS. The Mayo group has established

Protocol Version Date: 14Apr2020  experience detecting and isolated purified CTCs from breast cancer patients, as 
well as the capability to design 4 - or 6- marker panels to capture specific 
phenotypic populations of CTCs. 
10 mL whole blood samples will be collected in AccuCyte Blood Collection 
Tubes, which contain the proprietary RareCyte cell preservative. These samples 
will be shipped immediately at ambient temperature to Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster and then processed through the RareCyte system within 3 days of collection. 
CTCs will be captured onto glass slides (8 slides per blood sample) for 
subsequent immunofluor escent staining, selection, and single cell iso lation. The 
markers used for CTC identification will include DAPI [INVESTIGATOR_391872], cytokeratin, and EpCAM at a minimum. CD45 will be used to distinguish WBCs (CD45 positive) from CTCs (CD45 negative). Pure populations of CTCs will 
then be isolated and stored for subsequent molecular analyses, as yet to be 
determined.

15.16 Potential drug interactions  
Caution is required when using drugs that are human thymidine kinase substrates, e.g., zidovudine. Such drugs, if used concomitantly with FTD/TPI , may 
theoretically compete with the effector of FTD/TPI , i.e., FTD , for activation via 
thymidine kinases. Therefore, when using antiviral drugs that are human 
thymidine kinase substrates, monitor for possible decreased efficacy of the 
antiviral agent, and consider switching to an alternative antiviral agent that is not a human thymidine kinase substrate such as: lamivudine, zalcitabine, didanosine, 
abacavir, etc.

15.25 Pharmacokinetic information  
Distribution: V d: 33-150 L/m2 
Protein binding, plasma : Predominantly albumin; Parent drug: 30% to 68%, SN-
38 (active metabolite): ~95% 
Metabolism: Primarily hepatic to SN -38 (active metabolite) by [CONTACT_391912]; SN -38 undergoes conjugation by [CONTACT_31672]- glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 
(UGT1A1) to form a glucuronide metabolite. Conversion of Irinotecan to SN-38 
is decreased and glucoronidation of SN-38 is increased in patients who smoke 
cigarettes, resulting in  lower levels of the metabolite and overall decreased 
systemic exposure. SN -38 is increased by [CONTACT_15924]1A1*28 polymorphism (10% of 
North Americans are homozygous for UGT1A1*28 allele). Patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele are at increased risk of neutropenia; initial one -level 
dose reduction should be considered for both single-agent and combination regimens. The lactones of both Irinotecan and SN-38 undergo hydrolysis to 
inactive hydroxyl acid forms. 
Half-life elimination: SN -38: mean terminal 10-20 hou rs 
Time to peak : SN-38: Following 90-minute infusion ~1 hour 
Excretion: Within 24 hours: urine: Irinotecan (11% to 20%), metabolites (SN-38 
<1%, SN-38 glucuronide, 3%) 
15.[ADDRESS_492036]: Substrate  (major) of CYP2B6, 3A4, P-
glycoprotein, SLCO1B1 and UGT1A1 
Increased Effect/Toxicity: CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors may 
increase the levels/effects of irinotecan. Bevacizumab may increase the 
adverse effects of Irinotecan (e.g., diarrhea, neutropenia). Ketoconazole 
increases the levels/effects of irinotecan and active metabolite; discontinu e 
ketoconazole 1 week prior to i rinotecan therapy; concurrent use is 
contraindicated. Decreased Effect: CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 inducers may decrease the 
levels/effects of irin otecan.  
Ethanol/Nutrition/Herb Interactions Herb/Nutraceutical:  St John’s wort 
decreases therapeutic effect of irinotecan; discontinue ≥ 2weeks prior to

Protocol Version Date: 14Apr2020  16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
16.1 Overview  
This protocol will assess the efficacy of trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391883] a two stage phase II study design. This single 
arm Phase II trial will assess the 16 -week progression -free survival rate (by [CONTACT_393] 
v1.1) associated with trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391884]. We will adopt a PFS rate of 10% as the null hypothesis and PFS 
rate of 30% as the alternative hypothesis. In addition to response, this s tudy will also 
evaluate the overall response rate (ORR), progression -free survival (PFS), overall 
survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events.  
16.11  Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint for this study is 16- week progression -free survival 
associated with trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391884]. 
16.[ADDRESS_492040] success proportion where the proposed treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this population is 10%, and the smallest success proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in 
this patient population is 30%. The following two stage design (Simon) uses [ADDRESS_492041] 10%. 
NOTE: We consider a success to be alive and progression -free by [ADDRESS_492042]-
registration (i.e. stable disease, partial response, or complete response).  
16.211 STAGE 1: Enter [ADDRESS_492043] 2, we will proceed to Stage 2.  
16.212 STAGE 2: Enter an additional [ADDRESS_492044] 25 evaluable patients, we may recommend further testing of this regimen in subsequent studies in this 
population. 
16.213 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_391885]- making process. Analyses involving over accrued 
patients are discussed in Section 16.34. 
16.214 NOTE: We will not suspend accrual between stages to allow the first 15 patients to become evaluable, unless undue toxicit y is observed.  
MC1941 52  MCCC Amendment 1  
Protocol Version Date: 14Apr2020  16.[ADDRESS_492045] patient has been observed for 4 months.  
16.24 Power and Significance Level 
Assuming that the number of successes is binomially distributed, the significance 
level is 0.05 and the probability of declaring that this regimen warrants further 
studies (i.e. statistical power) under various success proportions and the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_391886] a function 
of the true success proportion as shown in the following table. 
If the true success proportion is . . .  0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 
then the probability of declaring that the 
regimen warrants further studies is . .  0.03 0.16 0.38 0.61 0.80 
and the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_270478] 1 is . . .  0.56 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.04 
16.25 Other Considerations 
Adverse events, quality/duration of response, and patterns of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific discoveries or changes in standard 
care will be taken into account in any decision to terminate the study. 
16.3 Analysis Plan  
The analysis for this trial will commence at planned time points (see 16.2) and at the time 
the patients have become evaluable for the primary endpoint. Such a decision will be made by [CONTACT_31957], in accord with CCS Standard Operating 
Procedures, availability of data for secondary endpoints (eg, laboratory correlates), and 
the level of data maturity. It is anticipated that the earliest date in which the results will 
be made available via manuscript, abstract, or presentation format is when patients have 
been on study for 16 weeks (i.e. received second scan). 
16.31  Primary Endpoint 
16.311 Definition  
The primary endpoint of this trial is the progression- free survival rate. 
This is defined as the proportion of evaluable patients who are 
progression- free (stable disease, partial response, complete response) at 
[ADDRESS_492046] signed a consent form ,  begun treatment, and undergone restaging scans 
(unless deemed to have clinica l progression by [CONTACT_1697]) will be 
considered evaluable for the primary endpoint. 
MC1941 53  MCCC Amendment 1  
Protocol Version Date: 14Apr2020  16.312 Estimation  
The proportion of successes will be estimated by [CONTACT_258793]. 
Confidence intervals for the  true success proportion will be calculated 
according to the approach of Clopper and Pearson. 
16.313 Over Accrual  
If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the additional 
patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_391887] -making processes; however, they will be included in final 
point estimates and confidence intervals as though they were accrued in the final stage.  
16.32  Secondary Endpoints 
The following endpoints will be evaluated: overall response rate, progres sion-
free survival, overall survival, and adverse events.  For efficacy outcomes, the 
same population defined in S ection 16.311 will be used as the evaluable 
population. For adverse event  outcomes, all consented patients eligible to begin 
treatment will be evaluated.  
16.321 Overall Response Rate (ORR):  
Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of patients who 
experience either a partial response or complete response as their best 
response. ORR will be reported descriptively and a 95% confidence 
interval will be reported.  
16.322 Disease Control Rate (DCR):  
Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of patients who experience a partial response, complete response, or have stable 
disease as their best response. DCR will be reported descriptivel y and a 
95% confidence interval will be reported. 
16.322 Progression- Free Survival  (PFS) : 
Progression- free survival is defined as the time from study entry to the 
first of either disease progression or death from any cause, where disease progression will b e determined based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. 
PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method. The median 
PFS and 95% confidence interval will be reported. Patients will be censored at the last disease assessment date.  
16.323 Overall Survival (OS) : 
Overall survival is defined as the time from study entry to death from 
any cause. OS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method. The 
median OS and 95% confidence interval will be reported. Patients will 
be censored at the date patient was last known to be alive.  
16.324 Adverse events  
The maximum grade for each type of adverse event by [CONTACT_391914] 5.0. We will also closely monitor adverse events throughout 
the study.

16.34 Exploratory Analysis 
To explore the population of patients that received prior treatment with 5- FU, 
patients within this cohort will be evaluated for endpoints that may include, but 
not be limited to: PFS, safety and tolerability, ORR, DCR, and OS. 
16.4  Data & Safety Monitoring  
16.41  Review  
The study chair(s) and the study statistician will review the study at least twice a 
year to i dentify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems that might be 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial

the conduct of the trial and in consideration of newly acquired information 
regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation. The 
study team may choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse event 
profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below.  
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe events considered at least possibly related to study treatment (i.e. an adverse event with attribute specified as “possible”, “probable”, or “definite”) that satisfy 
either of the following:

17.3 Background and Methodology 
17.31 Patient -derived tumor organoid  
Preclinical tumor models are important tools to study cancer biology, develop 
novel therapeutics, and provide information for treatment decisions. However 
currently available tumor models such as cell lines, transgenic mice and patient -
derived xenograft (PDX) model have inherent limitations th at can adversely 
affect the translation of preclinical findings to the clinic. Patient-derived tumor organoid is a 3- D cell culture which enables the establishment of ex vivo  tumor 
model from scant core- needle biopsy specimen in a timely manner. These tumo r 
organoids recapi[INVESTIGATOR_391892]. 
(Vlachogiannis et al. 2018) The laboratory of  at 
our institution has successfully established such tumor organoids from core-
biopsy tumor specimens donated by [CONTACT_391915]. 
The established tumor organoids were ready for drug screening and related molecular studies within 4 -6 weeks of the biopsy. Though the concordance 

MC1941 60  MCCC Amendment 1  
Protocol Version Date: 14Apr2020  between treatment effect in tumor organoids and the clinical benefit observed in 
the donor patients have  been reported, the role of tumor organoids has not been 
prospectively evaluated in clinical trials of patients with advanced BTCs. Here, we aim to 1) determine if drug response from a parallel ex vivo  trial using 
patient -derived tumor organoid correlates with clinical response to 
trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391893] 2) to evaluate the role of thymidine 
kinase 1 in predicting the clinical response to trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_391894] 
(Edahiro et al. 2018; Yoshino et al. 2018) and discover potential mechanisms of resistance and sensitivity.

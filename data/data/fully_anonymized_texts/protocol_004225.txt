I. Overview and Specific Aims:
The goal of this research is to change the paradigm of addiction treatment by [CONTACT_103588][INVESTIGATOR_2428] (OUD) treatment in community settings frequented by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_45155], instead of relying 
on referral to treatment facilities. In 2014, of the 2.[ADDRESS_114602] people who use drugs in traditional medical settings.3-8 Buprenorphine 
maintenance treatment (BMT) may be offered in diverse settings addressing some structural 
barriers; however, after buprenorphine became available in the US, up to 80% of those with 
OUD remained out-of-treatment.[ADDRESS_114603] the effectiveness and safety of initiating buprenorphine 
treatment onsite at syringe exchange programs. In 2013, there were 204 syringe exchange 
programs (SEPs) in the [LOCATION_002] and Puerto Rico, distributing [ADDRESS_114604] 80% of SEP participants report use heroin or other illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].[ADDRESS_114605] SEP participants reported that they 
would prefer to receive BMT onsite at SEPs instead of referral to addiction treatment facilities or 
medical clinics.15 Thus, based on formative data and experience, we propose to initiate BMT 
onsite at SEPs before transferring care to a community health center (CHC) for maintenance 
treatment.
In a [ADDRESS_114606] based in a large urban area with high rates of OUD and HIV, we will recruit 
250 out-of-treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_103534] 1:[ADDRESS_114607] review. We will study rates of BMT engagement (defined as receiving BMT at 
30 days following randomization), treatment outcomes (opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], HIV risk behaviors), and 
programmatic service utilization and costs to establish effectiveness and economic viability. We 
will assess buprenorphine diversion by [CONTACT_103589], testing urine samples for buprenorphine, and through sequential surveys regarding 
buying or selling illicit buprenorphine. We will also explore changes in self-efficacy and quality of 
life in both study arms. Our specific aims are:

Hypothesis 1: More participants randomized to O-BMT (vs. referral) will be engaged in BMT at 
30 days.
Hypothesis 2: Reductions in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (on self-report and weekly urine drug testing) will be 
greater among participants randomized to O-BMT (vs. referral) over 24 weeks of follow-up.

II. Background
Most Americans with OUD remain out-of-treatment. Rates of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], disorder, and 
overdose have skyrocketed over the past decade. In 2014, of the 2.5 million Americans in need 
of treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD), fewer than 490,000 were admitted to addiction 
treatment facilities, leaving a large treatment gap.1,2 Buprenorphine maintenance treatment 
(BMT) was approved in the [LOCATION_002] in 2002 with the goal of improving access to 
treatment. BMT may be offered in diverse medical settings, addressing the stigma of attending 
addiction treatment programs and increasing the number of locations where opi[INVESTIGATOR_103535];16-20 however, despi[INVESTIGATOR_103536], 80% of those with OUD remained 
out of treatment in the [LOCATION_002] through 2013.9 Therefore, there is a large and increasing 
population of out-of-treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155] (approximately 1.9 million), but with thirty-eight 
states having more than ¾ of their opi[INVESTIGATOR_103537] 80% capacity, 
new treatment venues will be necessary.21,22  
Efforts needed to engage out-of-treatment individuals. After buprenorphine became 
available, between 2003 and 2013, OUD treatment utilization remained low (<20%) with minimal 
change.[ADDRESS_114610] medications (i.e, buprenorphine and methadone) did not change.[ADDRESS_114611] people who use drugs.3-7,27 Thus, structural interventions 
are needed to improve engagement. 
Syringe exchange programs (SEPs) reach a high-risk, out-of-treatment population. 
Emergency departments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], and correctional facilities have been targeted as novel sites 
for BMT initiation because they frequently encounter out-of-treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_103538].28-[ADDRESS_114612] 80% of 
SEP participants report using heroin or other illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].32-[ADDRESS_114613] changed laws to allow SEPs, and programs in high-risk areas

adjustments, referred for psychosocial support, and continued to see the patient every 1-2 
weeks. Treatment retention was 68% at 3 months and 42% at 12 months, but self-reported drug 
use, urine drug testing, and diversion of medication was not reported.42 In Los Angeles, heroin-
using SEP participants were offered a 15-day onsite buprenorphine treatment protocol where 
medication was dispensed twice weekly. Participants were also provided with psychosocial 
counseling and support. Of 9 participants in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], 7 completed the protocol, and 3 (33%)

outcomes, including minority race/ethnicity, criminal behavior, substance use,and mental illness. 
Enabling factors are resources that facilitate OUD treatment, including insurance, transportation, 
ability to negotiate complex systems, and access to BMT providers. Need factors are 
determined by [CONTACT_8335]’ perceived and evaluated health care needs. In an environment with 
adequate insurance (i.e., Medicaid), transportation (i.e., public transportation), and access to 
BMT providers (see section D.3), our structural intervention of onsite treatment, is predicted to 
increase BMT initiation and engagment. The enabling factor of onsite treatment will allow 
participants to initiate BMT when they are ready, instead of finding a provider, scheduling and 
waiting for an appointment, completing paperwork, and then waiting for assessment – 
potentially while in withdrawal. Of previously described barriers to BMT, health system 
fragmentation, waiting times, and fear of discrimination in medical settings can addressed

Version 6-25-20 through onsite treatment.45 This enabling factor will help participants meet their perceived health 
needs (i.e., need for OUD treatment), which will have a positive effect on health outcomes.         
Concerns about buprenorphine diversion are common, but data are lacking. Diversion, 
meaning that patients who are prescribed buprenorphine (including buprenorphine-naloxone) 
give or sell the medication to others who are not engaged in treatment is a major concern for 
prescribers and policy makers.47-50 Those taking diverted medication may be “self-treating” 
withdrawal symptoms, which is common among PWID, or seeking euphoric effects.48,51-[ADDRESS_114619]; however, they could divert 
medication to others posing a public health risk.48,51,59 Making BMT available at SEPs, where 
there is active drug use, could increase risk of diversion; however, it could also address an 
unmet need for treatment. In 2013, we found that among [ADDRESS_114620] found inadequate BMT access as a risk factor 
for using diverted buprenorphine.51,60 Therefore, onsite BMT at SEPs could also paradoxically 
reduce diversion. There are also other important areas that require inquiry. Though 35-100% of 
BMT patients initiating treatment have reported taking diverted buprenorphine, estimates of how 
many BMT patients divert their own medication to illicit markets are limited.56,59,61,62 Among 
inmates enrolled in trials of BMT initiation prior to jail or prison release, 10-20% were removed 
from the trials for attempting to divert their medication;28,29 however, data relevent to community 
BMT patients are needed to inform clinical practice and policies regarding buprenorphine 
prescribing (e.g., establishing monitoring guidelines).        
Measuring diversion. There are no standard measures to assess buprenorphine diversion, but 
we will draw upon a robust adherence literature related to HIV and other chronic conditions. 
Electronic monitors measure adherence most accurately.[ADDRESS_114621] mostly relied on self-report of diversion, while one study attempted to quantify diversion by 
[CONTACT_103592]’ urine samples for buprenorphine.[ADDRESS_114622] buprenorphine diversion could also improve the safety of office-based BMT.Predisposing Enabling

Version 6-25-[ADDRESS_114623] based in a large urban area with high rates of 
OUD and HIV, we will recruit 250 out-of-treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_103539] 1:1 to 
onsite BMT initiation (O-BMT) or enhanced referral. Over two weeks, participants in the O-BMT 
arm will see a buprenorphine provider twice, receive prescriptions of medication, and then their 
care will be transferred to a community health center (CHC) for maintenance BMT. In the control 
arm, participants will receive enhanced referral to a CHC for initiation and maintenance BMT. 
We will assess participants with urine drug tests, questionnaires, and medical record review 
studying treatment engagement, treatment outcomes (opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], HIV risk behaviors) and 
programmatic service utilization in order to establish effectiveness and costs. We will also 
assess buprenorphine diversion using electronic monitors, urine drug testing, and sequential 
surveys.
Setting. A. [LOCATION_001] Harm Reduction Educators (NYRHE) is the largest harm reduction 
agency in [LOCATION_001] City with over [ADDRESS_114624]-side locations, NYHRE provides participants with 
syringe exchange; referral for medical, dental and addiction treatment; and other supportive 
services. The majority of NYHRE’s clients are Hispanic or black, male, 40-49 years old, and 
PWID. Diverse staff members (case managers, outreach workers, and syringe exchange staff) 
have received training on BMT. O-BMT will be offered at community-based offices only.
B. Washington Heights CORNER Project (WHCP) is another harm reduction agency 
situated in an area highly affected by [CONTACT_103593]. At its community-based office, WHCP 
provides clients with syringe exchange; referrals for medical, dental, or addiction treatment; and 
other supportive services. WHCP serves over [ADDRESS_114625] received training on BMT.
C. BOOM!Health Is a harm reduction agency located in the South Bronx that now 
delivers a full range of prevention, syringe access, health coordination, behavioral health, 
housing, legal, advocacy and wellness services to over 8,[ADDRESS_114626] to reach 
communities in the Bronx, [LOCATION_001]. BOOM!Health strengthens efforts to remove barriers to 
accessing medical care, with particular emphasis on HIV and viral hepatitis prevention and care 
services. BOOM!Health has private space for medical assessment and staff have experience 
with referrals to buprenorphine treatment.
Montefiore’s Community Health Center (CHC) will serve as a referral source for the 
study. The CHC offers primary and specialty care to over 15,[ADDRESS_114627] coordinator who receives referrals. The CHC has assisted in

Participants. Eligibility criteria: 1) age ≥ 18 years; 2) opi[INVESTIGATOR_103540]-V criteria; 3) 
interest in BMT; 4) motivation for OUD treatment; and 5) willingness to accept CHC referral. 
Exclusions: 1) receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_103541] 30 days (confirmed by [CONTACT_103595]); 2.) inability to provide informed consent; 3) unstable 
mental illness (e.g., suicidality, psychosis, etc.); 4) severe alcohol use disorder or

elevation (5X upper limit of normal) limited buprenorphine treatment in <1% of patients, 
therefore we will not draw blood to assess liver function prior to study enrollment. 
Recruitment. Staff members at the SEPs will receive training on BMT (buprenorphine 
education and referral to the CHC).14 Active recruitment will occur by [CONTACT_103596] a research assistant (RA). Passive recruitment will occur 
by [CONTACT_103597]. 
Screening procedures: The RAs will screen all participants for exclusion and inclusion criteria. 
A diagnosis of opi[INVESTIGATOR_103543] (unstable mental illness, alcohol use disorder, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_103544]) will be established by [CONTACT_103598] (MINI), a widely used psychiatric structured diagnostic interview 
instrument for unstable mental illness and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and the DSM-V 
checklist for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], alcohol and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_103544].  For this assessment (for both 
alcohol and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]), there are [ADDRESS_114628].
Randomization: An RA will meet with eligible participants at the SEPs to describe the 
study. At enrollment, written informed consent including a consent quiz to monitor 
comprehension will be obtained, including a release for medical records. Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_3725] (A, B or C, occur in blocks of 4-8, with 1:1 allocation of O-BMT vs. referral.

half-day sessions weekly. Participants will be 
registered as CHC patients to ensure continuity of 
care. For example, the provider will document 
encounters in the CHC’s electronic health record 
via a web-based portal and patients will be able to 
access medical advice during off-hours through the 
CHC (see Human Subjects). Participants will be 
prescribed BMT from the SEP and then staff 
members will facilitate transfer a CHC for 
maintenance treatment. Details are presented 
below and in Table 1.
Initiation. Over two weeks, participants will see the study provider twice onsite at the SEP. The first visit will 
include: assessment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], contraindicactions to BMT, and co-morbidities; instructions for 
initiating treatment; prescription for one week of medication (buprenorphine-naloxone provided by [CONTACT_103599] a Wisepi[INVESTIGATOR_103546]); and planning for one 
week follow-up. Participants will start taking medication at home, which is safe, effective, and a standard 
practice.75-[ADDRESS_114631] algorithm. After one week, the study provider will make dose adjustments, 
provide another prescription for one week of medication (second prescription), and arrange for linkage to the 
CHC for maintenance BMT. The SEP staff will provide psychosocial support between visits and facilitate 
transfer of care to a CHC as specified in pre-intervention training.. Participants who do not pi[INVESTIGATOR_103547] 14 days will not be eligible to repeat O-BMT procedures, but they still may be referred to the 
CHC for maintenance BMT.
Maintenance. After two onsite visits with the study provider, BMT will be transferred to a CHC via enhanced 
referral. The CHC will guarantee access to a BMT provider within one week (see Letters of Support) and 
research staff will assist with scheduling appointments. Physicians at the CHC are experienced treating OUD 
and will provide standard BMT (weekly visits at initiation, change to monthly visits with clinical stability, urine 
drug testing, psychosocial counseling) according to a written protocol (see appendix 1.). Participants will 
receive reminder calls the day before their appointment.
     Risk mitigation strategy for participants who take sedatives: Clinical decisions regarding BMT dosing, 
treatment continuation, and referral for additional psychosocial treatments will be based on the clinical 
judgement of BMT providers (i.e., buprenorphine-waivered physicians). Consistent with FDA-guidance,

Version 6-25-20 physicians will provide the following aspects of care to participants who are taking benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_103548] (including alcohol):    
• Education about the serious risks of combined use, including overdose and death, that can occur with CNS 
depressants even when used as prescribed, as well as when used illicitly. 
• Developi[INVESTIGATOR_103549]. 
• Tapering the benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_103550]. 
• Verifying the diagnosis if a patient is receiving prescribed benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_103551], and considering other treatment options for these conditions. 
• Recognizing that patients may require BMT indefinitely and their use should continue for as long as patients 
are benefiting and their use contributes to the intended treatment goals. 
• Coordinating care to ensure other prescribers are aware of the patient’s buprenorphine treatment. 
• Monitoring for illicit drug use, including urine screening  
If the risks of BMT outweigh the clinical benefits, participants will be referred to an opi[INVESTIGATOR_103552].[ADDRESS_114632] week of 
treatment, but SEP staff will be available for psychosocial support throughout this time.75,79 Starting treatment 
at home does not increase dropout from treatment.67,77 After BMT initiation, linkage from community-based 
settings to primary care is feasible.80 We considered continuing BMT onsite for longer than two weeks to 
accommodate participants who are comfortable with SEP staff but uncomfortable in traditional medical 
settings;3,4 however, there are potential benefits to transfering care. Maintance BMT at SEPs could expose 
participants to cues of drug use, which may trigger opi[INVESTIGATOR_2506];81 transfer to a CHC may improve access to 
medical services (mental health counseling, HIV treatment, etc.);82 and segregating care of PWID outside of 
the traditional health care system risks entrenching “separate and unequal” care.[ADDRESS_114633] an entire pack. We will ask participants directly about selling their 
buprenorphine through sequential surveys. Audio computer-assisted self-interview technology through 
REDcap (see below) may reduce social desirability bias in reporting stigmatized behaviors, and prior studies of 
medical marijuana diversion have detected high rates of diversion through self-report.83-[ADDRESS_114634] urine samples tested to confirm presence of prescribed buprenorphine. 
Control: Enhanced referral to BMT. The control condition will be enhanced referral to a CHC for initiation of 
BMT and maintenance treatment. Similar to O-BMT, the research staff will facilitate linkage to care. 
Participants will receive an expedited appointment within [ADDRESS_114635] occurs within two weeks of study enrollment (in parallel with 
the timing of O-BMT). We will assess fidelity to these referral procedures (see below). Buprenorphine providers 
at the CHC will follow the same procedures for BMT initiation as provided in O-BMT: assessment for OUD and 
co-morbidities, instruction on starting treatment at home, weekly electronic medical adherence monitors for two 
weeks with 4-16 mg of buprenorphine, dose adjustment after one week, and then monthly visits. Providers at 
the CHC will receive instruction on study procedures before commencing the trial, and procedures will be 
reviewed at monthly buprenorphine provider meetings at the CHC (see Letters of Support).    
Training the SEP staff. Referral to addiction treatment and psychosocial support are standard services 
provided by [CONTACT_103600]. Prior to enrolling participants, we will enhance services by [CONTACT_1541] 3 hours of training

Version 6-25-[ADDRESS_114636] provided these 
trainings to SEP staff and peer mentors with good acceptability and fidelity to procedures.14 
Methods common to all aims. We will assess for BMT engagement (at 30 days), treatment outcomes (illicit 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_103553]), HIV risk behaviors, buprenorphine diversion, programmatic costs and 
service utilization, and participant attitudes over the study period. 
Research Visits: An RA will meet with all participants at enrollment and after 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and [ADDRESS_114637] elapsed. Research visits will occur in private at the SEP office or CHC and participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_114638] payment (weeks 1, 6) or a $[ADDRESS_114639] payment (weeks 0, 2, 4,  8, 12, 24) compensation. Interviews 
and urine samples will be collected at each study visit. Medical records will be extracted at the completion of 
the study.
Data sources and measures: A complete list of measures is presented in Table 2. 
Medical Records: We will extract medical record data from the CHC, including prescription and visit 
information to assess treatment engagement and retention in care. Prescription data will include information 
both from the electronic medical record (prescriptions) and the NY Prescription Drug Monitoring Program 
(medications dispensed). As mandated by [CONTACT_2371], the later source includes all controlled substances dispensed 
by [CONTACT_103601]. Prescription data will include medication name, strength, directions, 
number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], number of refills, date of prescription, prescriber, and date medication was filled. Visit data will 
include date of visit, and provider. If participants request referral to a different site for BMT or are transferred to 
an alternative form of OUD treatment (e.g., methadone maintenance), we will request medical records using 
the signed, HIPAA-compliant release for medical records.
Urine Drug Testing: All research visits will include  urine collection, which will be tested for buprenorphine, 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], oxycodone, methadone, cocaine, methamphetamine and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].

Version 6-25-[ADDRESS_114640] Review
Treatment engagement - 30 days
Retention in care - 3 month, 6 month
RBS = HIV Risk Behavior Survey; CES-D = Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328]; 
DTCQ-8 = Drug-Taking Confidence Questionnaire, 8 item version; EQ-5D = EuroQol 5D-5L; 
PCBSS = Primary Care Buprenorphine Satisfaction Scale; SOCRATES = The Stages of Change 
Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale
Questionnaires: Using the survey feature on REDcap which plays an audio recording of questions as it 
displays the question on a computer screen, will be used by [CONTACT_103602]. Interviews 
will assess for sociodemographic information, motivation for treatment, HIV risk behaviors, buprenorphine 
diversion, and other variables (see below). Interviews will last 45-60 minutes.
Electronic medication adherence monitors: Wisepi[INVESTIGATOR_103555]. Participants will receive a prescription for buprenorphine. After receiving the 
prescription, research staff will supervise the patient as they place their medication into the Wisepi[INVESTIGATOR_103556].  Each time the device is opened it sends a signal to a password protected database. 
Fidelity of referral: The SEP staff will follow identical procedures for referral or transfer of care to a CHC. 
We will not be able to blind participants or staff to study allocation. Therefore, we will record the number of 
appointments and reminder phone calls performed in each arm to ensure that SEP staff members are not 
providing differential effort in facilitating referral to a CHC.
Main outcome variables: Aim 1: Primary outcome (efficacy): we will use a dichotomous measure (yes/no) 
of BMT engagement defined as having an active buprenorphine prescription at 30 days after randomization.30 
Secondary outcome measures assessed at 24 weeks will include: proportion who filled a prescription for BMT, 
total weeks prescribed BMT, and time to BMT initiation (all continuous measures).
Aim 1: Secondary outcomes (efficacy): a.) Illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]: We will check urine drug testing at each 
research visit and use the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) to assess self-reported substance use.[ADDRESS_114641] 
adapted the ASI to also assess use of illicit buprenorphine.13 We will report the following continuous measures 
in each study arm: the percentage of urine drug tests that are positive for illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], oxycodone, 
methadone, illicit buprenorphine), self-reported days of illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and percent of participants achieving 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_9757], defined as no illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_103557]-report and urine drug testing.

Version 6-25-20 b.) Retention in treatment: For participants initiating BMT, we will determine whether they are retained in 
treatment at three and six months following initiation (dichotomous measure). We will define retention as 
having a medical visit and active buprenorphine prescription each month after BMT initiation. We will also 
determine the proportion of days following BMT initiation that participants had an active prescription in order to 
detect lapses in treatment (continuous measure).   
c.) HIV risk behaviors: We will determine changes in drug-related HIV risks using the HIV Risk Behavior 
Survey – a validated, well-studied instrument that documents injection and sexual behaviors over the previous 
30 days. This instrument has been studied among out-of-treatment PWID and BMT patients.86,93  As previously 
reported, we will create a dichotomous measure (yes/no) of injecting risk based on self-report of at least one 
risk behavior (sharing syringes, not using bleach to clean syringes, sharing cookers, or front/back loading of 
syringes).93 Individual risk behaviors will be explored individually.
Aim 2: Primary outcome (safety): We will use a dichotomous measure (yes/no) of buprenorphine 
diversion for all participants to determine how many sell or give away prescribed medication. We will define 
diversion as having at least one problem behavior over the 24 weeks: non-adherence to prescribed medication 
on electronic monitoring, self-reported diversion, or a urine sample consistent with diversion. Adherence will be 
determined weekly with Wisepi[INVESTIGATOR_103558] X/7Y, where X = number of openings in one 
week and Y = number of doses prescribed per day. For the composite measure, non-adherence will be 
considered < 90% adherence. We will adapt the MGH Medication Questionnaire, which assesses misuse of 
prescribed medications, including selling medication, letting others take prescribed medication, or taking 
medication to get “high”. For the composite measure, self-reported diversion will be defined as an affirmative 
response to the question, “In the past [ADDRESS_114642] you sold your buprenorphine to others?” We will also test 
each urine sample for buprenorphine, and if absent among participants prescribed BMT, the urine sample will 
be considered consistent with diversion. Each behavior will also be explored individually.
Aim 2: Secondary outcomes (safety): We will also report illicit buprenorphine use (i.e., buprenorphine 
detected in urine samples of participants who are not prescribed BMT), and determine changes in illicit 
buprenorphine use from baseline to study completion among participants in each study arm. 
Aim 3: Primary outcome (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, ICER): The ICER will be calculated by 
[CONTACT_103603] O-BMT arm relative to the control arm by [CONTACT_103604] O-BMT arm relative to the control arm (instruments used to measure costs and 
effectiveness are described in detail below). The primary economic effectiveness outcome will be the quality-
adjusted life-year (QALY), a measure that incorporates both duration and health-related quality-of-life and is 
recommended as the primary economic effectiveness measure.[ADDRESS_114643] 
been established for QALYs, but not for clinical measures.95 
Aim 3: Secondary outcomes (ICER, clinical) We will also calculate ICERs using the clinically meaningful 
effectiveness measure of duration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9757], which will be operationalized as the proportion of the 
year the participant was abstinent from opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (the abstinent year). The calculation of cost-per abstinent-year 
enables comparisons with existing economic evaluations that have utilized similar effectiveness measures.96 
Health-related quality of life: will be measured using the EuroQol 5D-5L (EQ-5D).90,[ADDRESS_114644]-effectiveness analyses.98
Criminal and legal activities: will be self-reported using Timeline Followback, and measured using  the 
Criminal and Legal Activities Form. The following measures will be obtained: days involved in criminal activity; 
average number of crimes/day on days when illegal activity occurred; days incarcerated in any facility; specific 
crimes committed, and charges and convictions for those crimes; visits to parole/probation officer; and 
parole/probation violations.
Non-study resources: Non-study medical resources (e.g., medications, and use of inpatient, outpatient and 
emergency services) will be self-reported using Timeline Followback and collected using the Non-Study 
Resources Form. Use of non-medical resources (e.g., travel time to medical care) will also be self-reported and 
collected by [CONTACT_103605]-Study Resources Form.
Intervention Resource Utilization and Costs: The resource utilization and resulting cost of implementing 
and administering the O-BMT intervention will be estimated using a tailored version of the Drug Abuse

Version 6-25-[ADDRESS_114645] Analysis Program (DATCAP) instrument.99,100 The DATCAP is a standardized, customizable 
tool used to estimate costs of addiction treatment programs in diverse settings. 
Other covariates: We will measure factors that may be associated with BMT outcomes, including 
sociodemographic characteristics, insurance status, depressive symptoms, motivation for treatment, and prior 
buprenorphine exposure. We will also measure other outcomes that are important for clinical care, including 
self-efficacy,  perceived discrimination in medical care, and treatment satisfaction.
Data management. Urine drug tests will be conducted at the syringe exchange program or CHC and will be 
entered onto a paper Case Report Form and then entered into a password protected database. The entry will 
be verified by [CONTACT_103606]. Interviews using REDcap surveys allow for direct data entry by [CONTACT_103607]. To ensure confidentiality, participant identifiers will not be recorded on interviews or other data 
forms. Instead, participants will be assigned a unique study ID that will be used on all data documents and in 
databases. Participant’s names and consent forms will be stored separately from research data in locked file 
cabinets. Electronic data will be stored in a password-protected server, which will be back up daily and can 
only be accessed by [CONTACT_5051]. Because we will be collecting data on buprenorphine diversion, we 
also received a Certificate of Confidentiality from NIDA to provide additional protection of confidentiality (see 
Human Subjects for details).
Analysis: All primary analyses will be intention to treat, including participants who are lost to follow-up. In 
secondary analyses, we will conduct per-protocol analyses to ascertain outcomes among participants who 
actually initiate BMT at the SEP or CHC. We will conduct additional exploratory analyses on a per-protocol 
basis to further assess outcomes (e.g., satisfaction with buprenorphine treatment) 
Preliminary analyses. We will first review and summarize data using descriptive summaries and graphical 
analyses to ensure that reported values are within appropriate ranges, to check for the presence of outliers and 
abnormal values, and to verify that the distributions of measures meet the assumptions of the statistical tests 
that are planned as described below. 
Missing data. For missing categorical data, we will use multivariate multiple imputation using the fully 
conditional specification method.[ADDRESS_114646] of missing data on our study findings, as well as our 
interpretation of overall results.
Aim 1: To test the effectiveness of O-BMT. H1: more participants randomized to O-BMT (vs. control) will be 
engaged in BMT at [ADDRESS_114647] of the intervention (O-BMT). We will 
use a chi square test comparing the proportion of participants in each study arm who have an active 
buprenorphine prescription [ADDRESS_114648] a multivariable logistic regression 
adjusting for mental illness, polysubstance use, and addiction severity.  
H2: Reductions in opi[INVESTIGATOR_103559] O-BMT (vs. control) over 24 
weeks. We will use generalized estimating equations to compare changes in opi[INVESTIGATOR_103560] 24 week study period. One model will use results from urine drug tests at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 
weeks. A second model will compare the mean number of days (of the prior 30 days) with self-reported opi[INVESTIGATOR_103561] 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. 
H3: Reductions in HIV risk behaviors will be greater among participants randomized to O-BMT (vs. referral) 
over 24 weeks of follow-up. We will use generalized estimating equations to compare changes in injecting risk 
at 2, 12, and 24 weeks. 
Aim 2: To test the safety of onsite buprenorphine treatment at syringe exchange programs.  
H4: Diversion of buprenorphine will not be significantly greater among participants randomized to O-BMT (vs. 
control). By [CONTACT_108], participants who are not prescribed buprenorphine will not have an opportunity to divert 
their medication, but we will use an intention to treat approach to maintain randomization. The risk difference

Version 6-25-20 threshold margin for non-inferiority will be 5%. We will construct Wald 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for a 
difference in diversion rates between the two arms and examine if the lower bound of the 95% CI is greater 
than the threshold margin. If potential confounding factors are unbalanced and require adjustment, we will 
apply logistic regression and estimate the Odds Ratio (OR) and its CI, examining if the lower bound of the OR 
is greater than the OR converted from the risk difference. 
Aim 3: To determine the cost effectiveness of O-BMT by [CONTACT_103608]. H5: We hypothesize that O-BMT will be cost-effective according to commonly accepted 
thresholds. Our comprehensive economic evaluation will follow well-established guidelines and, in accordance 
with recently revised guidelines, be conducted from both the perspective of the healthcare system and the 
broader societal perspective.94,102,[ADDRESS_114649] that SEP participants will be publically 
insured or uninsured.13 The healthcare system perspective will include costs associated with OUD treatment 
and other healthcare services received by [CONTACT_103609]. The societal perspective includes additional non-
healthcare system costs (e.g., criminal justice resources) attributed to participants regardless of who shares 
the burden of these costs (e.g., healthcare system costs, time costs to the patient, criminal justice costs, and 
productivity costs). Effective OUD treatment can lead to savings in non-healthcare system costs, so ignoring 
these costs would underestimate the intervention’s true benefit to society.
First, we will estimate the service utilization and resulting costs associated with implementing and 
sustaining the O-BMT intervention in the SEPs. Second, we will estimate the relative economic value of the 
intervention, including extrapolating the downstream savings resulting from reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_103562] (e.g., reduced utilization of high-cost healthcare 
services and criminal-justice resources). The outcome of the cost-effectiveness analysis will be the ICER. We 
will also calculate “net monetary benefit,” a measure of cost-benefit, by [CONTACT_2931] a generally accepted 
willingness-to-pay threshold range of $100,000/QALY - $200,000/QALY.94,95
Next, we will estimate participant-level costs using the resource costing method, in which we determine a 
price weight for each resource unit consumed and multiplying price weights by [CONTACT_103610].94,102,103 
Unit costs will be derived from various sources reflecting “real-world” costs faced by [CONTACT_103611] (i.e., the healthcare system and society). All values will be adjusted for inflation. Since no 
follow-up measurements will be obtained beyond [ADDRESS_114650] 12-weeks of intervention. 
Given the differences in mechanisms to generate data, separate multivariable generalized-linear models 
(GLMs) will be estimated to predict the mean cost associated with each resource category at each time point. 
GLMs permit us to choose the most appropriate mean and variance functions according to the fit of the data.[ADDRESS_114651] size for the O-BMT intervention, we drew from prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_103563]. Stancliff et al.42 offered BMT to SEP participants (N = 100) and 68% were engaged in BMT at 
3 months (30 day engagement was not reported). Tringale et al.43 offered BMT to SEP participants (N=9) over 
15 days and then transferred care to treatment program. Following onsite initiation, 33% ultimately engaged in 
BMT. Daniels et al.80 offered BMT at a community-based recovery center (N = 78) and 49% were transitioned 
to primary care site to continue treatment. For enhanced referral, we estimated rates of engagement in BMT

Version 6-25-20 
from our own pi[INVESTIGATOR_103564]. Engagement after passive referral may be 
as low as 0%,14 while referral to MMT has resulted in 9-16% of 
SEP participants engaging in treatment.37-39 Therefore, we will 
recruit a sample of 250, which allowing for up to 20% attrition 
(n=200), giving us at least 80% power for the primary outcome 
(BMT engagement) in all proposed scenario.
For Aim 2, we chose the intention to treat analysis as the 
primary outcome. With a sample size of [ADDRESS_114652] rate 
of diversion of 10-25%, we will only have 80% power to declare 
that diversion rate in the O-BMT arm is non-inferior to the 
referral arm if the inferiority margin of the risk difference is 10-
14%. Though this is larger than  tolerable margins for non-inferiority, we will have good estimates of the 
frequency of diversion in the O-BMT arm, which will provide important safety data for onsite treatment.  
For Aim 3, assumptions are based on differences in cost and effect, standard deviations of cost and effect, 
the correlation of the difference in cost and effect, desired confidence and power levels, and the maximum 
willingness-to-pay value.106,107 We estimated the power for the primary outcomes of our economic analysis 
(cost-per QALY and cost-per abstinent year) using the target sample size of 250 (125 per group), and a range 
of values for the aforementioned assumptions, based on prior economic evaluations of substance use disorder 
interventions. We estimate at least 90% power to be 95% confident that an intervention is acceptable at the 
commonly cited willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY.95 
PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS
Human subjects involvement and characteristics: We will enroll 250 participants from syringe exchange 
programs (SEPs) with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) who are interested in buprenorphine maintenance treatment 
(BMT) and are motivated for treatment. 
 Eligibility criteria include:
1) age ≥ 18 years 
2) opi[INVESTIGATOR_103540]-V criteria 
3) interest in BMT
4) motivation for OUD treatment, based on SOCRATES 
5) willingness to accept CHC referral
Exclusion criteria include: 
1) receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_103541] 30 days (confirmed by [CONTACT_103612]); 
2) inability to provide informed consent
3) unstable mental illness (e.g., suicidality, psychosis, etc.) 
4) severe alcohol use disorder or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_103542]-V criteria 
5) hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone.
6) pregnancy (confirmed via urine testing)
Rationale for inclusion/exclusion criteria: Study participants will include out-of-treatment SEP participants 
with OUD. We will only include participants who are interested in BMT, motivated for OUD treatment, and 
willing to accept referral to a CHC for treatment, because our goal is to increase engagement in 
comprehensive BMT. Providing BMT onsite at SEPs could attract participants who are unready to stop illicit 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_103565]. There may be benefits to this type of symptom treatment, but our 
study is not designed to evaluate these benefits. We will exclude those with clinical contraindications to BMT,

Version 6-25-20 such as severe alcohol or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_103566], in order to ensure participant safety. In our treatment 
program, transaminase elevation (5X upper limit of normal) limited buprenorphine treatment in <1% of patients, 
therefore, we will not assess liver function prior to study enrollment, but all participants who continue BMT at 
the community health center will have liver function tests monitored as clinically warranted. We will exclude 
adolescents < 18 years old, because the CHC where we will be referring participants only offers BMT to adults. 
We will exclude pregnant women because initiation of BMT would require them to experience opi[INVESTIGATOR_48530], and our practice is to refer pregnant women to initiate methadone maintenance treatment, which 
does not require a period of withdrawal.
Recruitment: Staff members at the SEPs will receive training on BMT (buprenorphine education and 
referral to a CHC). Active recruitment will occur by [CONTACT_103613] a research assistant (RA). Passive recruitment will occur by [CONTACT_103614].
Participant tracking: We will use tracking procedures that we developed to retain drug users in previous 
research studies where there has been 84% retention rate. On locator forms, we will record information about: 
1) participants’ address and phone number; 2) contact [CONTACT_62944]’ family members, friends, 
case manager, physician, and pharmacy; and 3) locations where participants hang out.
Characteristics of participants: The SEPs are located in neighborhoods made up of mostly racial/ethnic 
minority groups; therefore, we expect to have no trouble recruiting minority groups. In prior studies at the two 
SEPs proposed as study sites, participants with OUD had the following characteristics: 70% were male, 60% 
were Hispanic, 21% were non-Hispanic black, and 16% were non-Hispanic white. We will attempt to limit the 
ratio of male to female participants to 2:1. Specifically, we anticipate the following characteristics of the 250 
participants we will enroll: 83 women and 167 men; 150 Hispanics, 53 non-Hispanic blacks, 40 non-Hispanic 
whites, and 7 participants with another race/ethnicity. 
Participant compensation: Brief visits (weeks 1, 6) where only urine is collected will include a $[ADDRESS_114653] 
payment. Longer visits (weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24) where urine and interviews will be collected will include a $[ADDRESS_114654] payment. We will compensate a $[ADDRESS_114655] 
electronic medical records. 
Urine Drug Testing: All research visits will include urine collection, which will be tested for buprenorphine, 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], oxycodone, methadone, cocaine, methamphetamine and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]. Results will be recorded 
on paper forms and entered into a web-based data base. Forms will contain only participant study ID (no 
identifying information).
Computerized interviews: At enrollment, the RA will administer interviews using REDcap survey (which is a 
self interview) technology where the participant is given headphones and the survey question is read aloud by 
[CONTACT_6449], the participant will then select the answer  to collect descriptive data and baseline measures. 
Interview data will be directly entered on a lap top computer or tablet, which will be password protected, and 
will contain only participant study ID (no identifying information). 
Medical record data: will be electronically extracting from Montefiore’s centralized clinical database, and 
will include data on buprenorphine prescriptions and clinical visits. The electronic file will be created by

(medications dispensed). As mandated by [CONTACT_2371], the later source includes all controlled substances dispensed 
by [CONTACT_103601]. Prescription data will include medication name, strength, directions, 
number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], number of refills, date of prescription, prescriber, and date medication was filled.  For those 
participants who receive community treatment not at a Montefiore site, a medical records release form will be

Electronic adherence data:  Wisepi[INVESTIGATOR_103567]. Electronic signal is sent to a password protected database when the device is 
opened and this data will be used to calculate adherence (or non-adherence) to prescribed medication. 
Adherence data will be downloaded and saved on a password protected computer.
Vulnerable population. SEP participants with OUD could be vulnerable to undue influence, because of 
physical dependence to opi[INVESTIGATOR_103568]. We will also be collecting sensitive 
information on diversion of buprenorphine, which is a controlled substance. In the following sections, we 
discuss the risks of enrolling SEP participants and procedures to minimize these risks. 
Potential risks. The primary risks of this study are: (1) breach of confidentiality leading to embarrassment, 
dismissal from SEP, or legal consequences; (2) inconvenience and discomfort associated with interviews; (3) 
fear that refusal to participate will affect care at the SEP; (4) diversion of prescribed BMT; (5) induced 
withdrawal after initiating BMT; (6) polysubstance use
Confidentiality issues: We will collect personal information from participants to facilitate tracking, and we 
will be asking personal questions including substance use and HIV risk behaviors.  We have outlined our 
procedures to maintain confidentiality below. 
Inconvenience and discomfort associated with interviews: Participants will be asked about substance use 
and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2571].  It is possible that such questions could produce anxiety in participants.  
Participants will be instructed that they may withdraw from the study if this occurs. [CONTACT_48376] (a board-certified 
general internist) will be involved with all study activities and will assess for severe discomfort or other severe 
community health center or emergency department. 
Fear that refusal to participate will affect care or services: Participants may use services at the SEP, such 
as housing assistance or mental health counseling. In the informed consent process, they will be clearly 
instructed that refusal to participate will in no way affect their care at the affiliated SEP. 
     Diversion of prescribed BMT: For the first two weeks after initiating treatment, prescribed buprenorphine will 
be provided in electronic adherence monitors to monitor adherence. This should dissuade diversion of 
buprenorphine. However, if participants do sell or give away their medication, there could be legal 
consequences or disciplinary action at the SEP. After initiating BMT, participants will be asked about whether 
they divert their medication, and we will also check urine drug tests with the expectation that participants who 
are prescribed buprenorphine will have detectable buprenorphine in their urine.
     Induced withdrawal after initiating BMT: Participants will start taking their medication at home, so they are 
subject to induced withdrawal if they take the buprenorphine before fully experiencing opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351]. This 
could include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, sweating, and anxiety. Standard protocols for 
home inductions will be followed with similar procedures in the O-BMT and enhanced referral arms. The risk of 
induced withdrawal will not be increased from routine clinical practice.

Version 6-25-20 Polysubstance use: Though buprenorphine has pharmacologic properties that make it safer than other 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_74453] (e.g., ceiling effect, partial agonist, co-formulation with naloxone), it does lead to some 
sedation, and overdoses are possible if taken with other sedating substances. If SEP participants are using 
multiple illicit substances, initiating BMT could add to their risk of overdose. 
Adequacy of protection against risks
Recruitment and informed consent: We will obtain informed consent for all participants of the RCT prior to 
collecting any information with personal identifiers (e.g. locator form or medical record release forms), 
administering the baseline REDcap interview, and randomization to an intervention arm. Informed consent will 
be obtained by [CONTACT_21118].
Protection against risk:  We will institute the following processes to ensure confidentiality is maintained: 
1. We will create a system that prevents linking sensitive material to participants’ personal identifiers.  We will 
have a “name-based” system and “ID-based” system that will remain separate.  In the name-based system, 
all documents that have patient identifiers will be filed together.  Some of these documents will have 
participants’ signatures (e.g. consent forms) and others will have personal information (e.g. locator forms).  
In the ID-based system, all documents that do not include identifying information or signatures will use 
participants’ IDs (rather than names), and will be filed together. All forms will contain either participants’ 
names or their study IDs, but not both. We will maintain one electronic document that links participants’ 
names and study IDs, which will be stored on a password-protected file located on Montefiore Box.   
2. We obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality to protect participants’ sensitive information. 
3. Letters and/or phone messages that are left for participants (to schedule research visits or referrals to the 
CHC) will not include any personal identifying information, and will not mention buprenorphine treatment.
4. Study records will be kept in locked files and/or within limited access, password-protected computer files, 
available only to the investigators and study personnel.  
5. Publication or presentation of study results will not identify subjects by [CONTACT_2300].  
Inconvenience, discomfort, and distress: [CONTACT_48376] will be contact[CONTACT_103616]. Participants may be referred for individual medical or psychiatric attention at 
Montefiore’s community health center or the emergency department (depending on severity). 
Diversion of prescribed BMT: Risks to the public and risks to study participants from diversion are different. 
Risks to the public from diversion will be managed by [CONTACT_103617]. During the trial, 
we will have monthly meetings with SEP staff to discuss whether they are noticing buprenorphine diversion 
onsite. If the SEP staff reports concerns about increased buprenorphine diversion onsite after implementation 
of O-BMT, we will take measures to increase monitoring of prescribed medication (e.g., more frequent visits). 
Use of electronic adherence monitoring may reduce the risk of buprenorphine diversion. We will also perform 
interim analyses to detect diversion in aggregate, and if we detect higher levels of diversion than have 
previously been reported (> 30%), we will stop the trial and implement measures to reduce diversion with 
assistance from the SEP staff. Importantly, if there is diversion, there are also risks to study participants in self-
reporting illegal activity or if diversion is detected from electronic monitoring or urine tests. We will keep this 
data confidential during the study. Urine results will not be reported in the electronic medical record, so it will 
not be available to treatment providers. Interim analyses to detect diversion will only be performed in 
aggregate. We obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from NIDA to reduce the chances of this data being 
obtained without participant consent.

Version 6-25-20 Induced withdrawal after initiating BMT: We have produced patient-centered home induction materials that 
instruct the reader on estimating severity of withdrawal by [CONTACT_103618] (e.g., 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2657], yawning, rhinorrhea, etc.). Our research group and others have published clinical data 
demonstrating that home inductions are safe and induced withdrawal is rare. Also, study clinicians will be 
available by [CONTACT_103619]. 
Even though O-BMT participants will see the study clinicians at the SEP, they will be registered as patients of 
the CHC, so additional medical advice is available [ADDRESS_114657].
Polysubstance use: All BMT providers will follow national guidelines for patient selection and clinical 
monitoring. Participants will be screened for alcohol or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_103569]. A buprenorphine-waivered clinician will assess all study participants for 
other clinical contraindications before they are prescribed buprenorphine. Participants will only be prescribed a 
small supply of medication when they initiate BMT. The study clinicians will use clinical judgment about 
discontinuing BMT at the second onsite clinical visit, if they have concerns about polysubstance use. According 
to a safety announcement released by [CONTACT_103620] 20, 2017, “Based on our additional review, the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is advising that the opi[INVESTIGATOR_103570] (CNS). The combined use of these drugs increases the risk of serious side effects; 
however, the harm caused by [CONTACT_103621][INVESTIGATOR_103571].” [ADDRESS_114658] public health benefit by [CONTACT_103622][INVESTIGATOR_46211].
Risk/benefit ratio. The O-BMT intervention has the potential to improve engagement in BMT among out-of-
treatment opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155], but it will require testing for safety and effectiveness. Given the steps that we will take 
to ensure that participants meet clinical criteria for BMT, minimize the chances of breach of confidentiality, and 
monitor for BMT diversion, study participation presents risks that are commensurate to risks of standard office-
based buprenorphine treatment and the risk/benefit ratio is favorable.
Importance of study findings. Our intervention will encourage OUD treatment in a high-risk out-of-treatment 
group of opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155]. The [LOCATION_002] is in the midst of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_103572], yet 80% of opi[INVESTIGATOR_103573]-of-treatment. Effective interventions are needed to encourage treatment engagement.

CHCC BUPRENORPHINE MAINTENANCE TREATMENT (BMT) PROTOCOL
1.Intake
a. On the first visit, gather the H&P w attention to the substance use history, set expectations, 
check LFTs and utox 
b. Use smart phrase to gather complete substance use history
c. Use smart phrase to generate BMT Patient Agreement
2. Induction
a. Second visit, the patient will receive Bupe induction instructions and COW scale. 
i. Tips: Start with 8 mg tabs/films and ask patient to break in 1/2 or even 1/4. Also 
prescribe clonidine, loperamide, and ibuprofen for withdrawal symptoms. 
ii. Induction can be done at home or in the office
1. Home induction has been tolerated and successful at CHCC
3. Induction and Stabilization
a. See the patient for follow-up in 1 week, then again 1-2 weeks later until the patient is on a stable 
dose
b. Doses can be adjusted based on symptoms of withdrawal and cravings. Sometimes this can be 
challenging as anxiety can mimic withdrawal symptoms.
c. Total daily dose: The usual dose is 16 mg total daily (the vast majority range between 8-24mg 
daily) and doses can be increased by 4 mg/day. 
d. Frequency: Can be dosed daily or bid, adjust according to symptoms, often pts like to split their 
doses, which is fine
4. Maintenance
a. Once dose is stable, can space out visits to monthly 
b. Check urine drug testing at every follow-up visit
c.  Assess for use of other substances (cocaine, alcohol, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], etc.) at each follow-up 
visit
d. Adopt an uniform approach about cocaine, alcohol, or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_2597]
i. Refer to social worker for psychosocial counseling
ii. Counsel all patients to minimize use of alcohol, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and other sedatives
iii. Refer to an opi[INVESTIGATOR_103586] 
5. Discharge from Treatment
a. If patients are hostile to staff or adulterate urine they will be given an administrative warning. 
These expectations should be made clear from day 1.
b. Repeat offenders should be discharged from the practice and referred to an opi[INVESTIGATOR_103587] 
6. Lost to Follow Up:
a. Track patients who have ever been evaluated for Bupe at your clinic, and periodically review 
with program coordinator and community outreach worker about outreach/retention efforts for 
loss to follow up patients.

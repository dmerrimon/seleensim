be studied.  
 
Each cohort will be enrolled and analyzed independently :   
• Cohort 1: Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU)  
• Cohort 2:  Chronic Idiopathic Pruritus (CIP)  
• Cohort 3: Lichen Planus (LP)  
• Cohort 4: Lichen Simplex Chronicus (LSC)  
• Cohort 5: Plaque Psoriasis (PPs)  
 
Each cohort will enroll approximately 26 subjects and contain three periods:  
• Screening Perio d (Day -28 to Day -1, minimum 14 days and maximum 28 days)  
• Treatment Period (Day 1 [Baseline] to Week 8)  
• Follow -up Period (After week 8 to Week 18)  
 
Allowable window for Week 1 is ±1 day and from Week 2 to Week 18 visits is ± [ADDRESS_1093687] -716 at 720 mg SC (or matching placebo)  will be followed 
by [CONTACT_102052] 360  mg SC  (or matching placebo)  administered every week for [ADDRESS_1093688] -716 on urticaria in CIU (Cohor t 1) will be investigated .   
Each cohort will utilize a washout design in which concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_793202] a designated timepoint prior to dosing through the En d of Study (EOS) Visit, 
thus removing the confounding effect of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_793203] -716 efficacy. 
Subjects who use a moisturizer cream/emollient will be instructed to use th e same moisturizer 
cream/emollient at the same frequency throughout the study.  Only subjects with CIU (Cohort 1) 
will be allowed to use H1 antihistamines at approved stable doses from 14 da ys prior to dosing to 
EOS Visit.  The permitted H1 antihistamines for CIU will be outlined in the  Pharmacy Manual .  
Should subjects in any cohort experience an exacerbation of symptoms that is significant enough to 
warrant intervention, they will be provided with H1 antihistamine s and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930] 
(TCS) as rescue medication.  The permitted rescue medication s for each cohort will be outlined in 
the Pharmacy Manual .   
Accountability for rescue medications will be maintained by [CONTACT_779] s. The date, time, and the 
number of antihistamine tablets will  be recorded and the weight of TCS tubes will be measured at 
dispensation, at every visit, an d upon return.  
Screening Period:  
After the Informed Consent Form (ICF) is signed, subjects will enter the Screening Period for 
assessment of eligibility.   
During the Screening Visit, subject’s medical and surgical history wi ll be reviewed including 
allergic history.  Review of medical history will include the s pecific cohort disease history and 
history of co -morbidities.  Prior and concomitant  medications, t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_793204] . Subjects will be instructed on the required washout for specific excl uded medications.

To be eligible for study participation, subjects must have moderate to se vere pruritus, defined as 
WI-NRS ≥  7 at the Screening Visit and a mean w eekly WI -NRS ≥  5 for each of the 2 consecutive 
weeks immediately prior to randomization.  A minimum of 85% complia nce with daily WI -NRS 
recording during the last 14 days of Screening Period prior to randomizatio n is required for 
eligibility unless approved  by [CONTACT_1034].   
At the Screening Visit , subjects will be asked to rate their pruritus severity (WI -NRS) in the 
previous [ADDRESS_1093690] their daily 
rating of WI -NRS and two sleep paramete rs, difficulty falling asleep NRS and sleep quality NRS, 
from the beginning of screening to Day 1.  The daily recordings (WI -NRS, difficulty falling asleep 
NRS, and sleep quality NRS) will continue throughout the study for eligib le subjects that proceed 
to dosing.   
Furthermore, s ubjects with CIU will  be instructed to also complete  on a daily basis the UAS7 
questionnaire (on itch and hives severity) from the beginning of scre ening to Day 1.  Daily 
completion of the UAS7 questionnaire will continue throughout the study for eligible CIU subjects 
that proceed to dosing.  
Additional assessments at the Screening Visit include those related  to pruritus (Pruritus VAS, and 
5-D Pruritus), sleep ( Sleep  Loss VAS)  and quality of life (DLQI and ItchyQoL ).    
Collection of adverse events and concomitant medications will begin aft er signing the ICF and will 
continue until the EOS Visit.  For a Schedule of Activities,  please see Appendix 1 .

All clinical study data will be presented in subject data listings.  Descr iptive statistics will be 
presented for all endpoints and will include number of subjects (n),  mean, standard deviation (SD), 
first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), minimu m and maximum for continuous variables, 
and frequency and percentage for categorical and ordinal variables.  
Statistical analyses of efficacy endpoints will be conducted separately for each cohort.   
 
Determination of Sample Size : 
This is a double -blind st udy.  Each cohort will be independently analyzed.  A total of 
approximately [ADDRESS_1093705] -716 and the placebo arms in a 3:[ADDRESS_1093706] s will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_1093707] -716 arm and 1.5 for the placebo arm, a 
total sample size of 26 subjects per cohort will provide about 80% power to dete ct a 2.[ADDRESS_1093708] deviation of 2.8, given a two -sided alpha of 0.2.   Given the 
exploratory nature of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the precision attained with the  above cohort samples size is

1.1 Background 
Chronic pruritus, defined as pruritus lasting for more than 6 weeks, is  a common and often 
debilitating condition associated with a wide range of diagnoses.1   In chronic idiopathic 
urticaria (CIU), also called chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic prurit us occurs in the 
context of recurrent hives that have no identifiable triggers.2  Chronic pruritus is the defining 
feature of chro nic idiopathic pruritus (CIP), which disproportionately aff ects the elderly .3  
Patients with lichen planus (LP) experience chronic pruritus along w ith polygonal, flat -
topped, violaceous papules and plaques .4   Lichenified plaques develop on accessible body 
areas in response to constant rubbing from intense chronic pruritus in lichen simplex 
chronicus (LSC).5  Chronic pruritus affects up to 60 -90% of patients with plaque psoriasis 
(PPs) who present with symmetrical, erythematous, silvery and scaly  plaques commonly 
located on scalp, trunk, and extremities.6, 7    
Chronic pruritus is estimated to occur in approximately 20% (lifetim e prevalence) of the 
population.[ADDRESS_1093718]  a 
large number of patients.  The prevalence of CIU is estimated at up to 1%8, LP at 0.22 to 
5%9, LSC up to 12%10 and psoriasis up to 4% in Western Countries11. CIP is estimated t o 
occur in 11.5 to 41% in the elderly.[ADDRESS_1093719] cells (also increased in 
non-lesional skin), and activated macrophages.13  In patients with CIP, lymphocytic infiltrates 
are seen in the absence of inflammatory skin lesio ns.3   LP lesional biopsies show lysis of 
basal keratinocytes by [CONTACT_398]8+ lymphocytes and IL -[ADDRESS_1093720] severe patients with CIU ( omalizumab ) and psoriasis ( adalimumab , 
etanercept , and inflixima b,).7, 20   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_249669] a large range of medications with 
variety of mechanisms of action, chronic pruritus remains a signif icant unmet  medical need  
due to poor respon se to treatment or unacceptable side effects.  Many patients with CIU, fo r 
example, remain symptomatic or are unwilling to tolerate or risk t he adverse effects of 
cyclosporine (renal toxicity) and omalizumab (black box warning for  omalizumab: 
anaphylaxis).

properties and biologic activity.  For details on the in vitro profil es, refer to the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).  
1.2.[ADDRESS_1093722]-716 was well tolerated in multi -dose 7 -week and 26 -week primate toxicity studies.  In 
the 7 -week toxicity study, cynomolgus monkeys were dosed once every oth er week with 
either an intravenous (IV) bolus injection of up to 500 mg/kg KPL -716 or a subcutaneous 
(SC) injection of 300 mg/kg KPL -716, for a total of  [ADDRESS_1093723] levels (NOAELs) for systemic toxicity  were 500  mg/kg for IV 
administration and 300  mg/kg for SC admini stration.  For further details, refer to the IB.   
In the chronic toxicology study, weekly administration of KPL -716 by [CONTACT_793235] 200 mg/kg IV/SC for 26 weeks (27 total doses) was well tolera ted in 
cynomolgus monkeys.  Based on these results under the conditions and du ration of the study 
provided in the final report, the NOAEL was considered to be 200 mg/kg IV/SC, the highest 
dose tested.  A low level of anti -drug antibody (ADA) response was noted in the toxicity 
study, which w as not unexpected because KPL -[ADDRESS_1093724] Oncosta tin M Receptor 
beta (OSMRβ).  OSMRβ is a cell surface receptor that heterodimer izes with IL -31 receptor 
alpha (IL -31Rα) to mediate signaling of IL -31.  It also heterodimerizes with gp130 to mediate 
signaling of oncostatin (OSM).  By [CONTACT_24096] a single epit ope , KPL -716 
simultaneously inhibits signaling of IL -31 and OSM, two (2) cytokine pathways important in 
pruritus, inflammation, hyperkeratosis and fibrosis.  KPL -716 does not inhibit signaling of 
OSM down the Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor ( LIFR) pathway, a pathway implicated 
in hematopoiesis and platelet synthesis.[ADDRESS_1093725] on pruritus intensi ty is anticipated at therapeutic 
doses based on the Phase 1b study results (Protocol KPL -716- C001).  The targeted nature of 
the KPL -[ADDRESS_1093726] -716- C202  CONFIDENTIAL   
28 January 2019 (Version 1.0)  Page [ADDRESS_1093727] -716, has been shown to play a role in 
inflammation, epi[INVESTIGATOR_793209], three  (3) pathways important in many pruritic 
dermatologic disorders.  OSM increases the produc tion of IL -4Rα and IL -13Rα.  27,  28, 29, 30, 31, 
32 OSM also increases IL -4 production and synergizes with IL -4 and IL -13 to upregulate 
downstream signaling events such as eotaxin production.27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33  Similarly, OSM 
synergizes with IL -17 and increases CCL2 and IL -6 production.32  OSM impacts epi[INVESTIGATOR_793210].27, 28  Finally, OSM levels a re increased in fibrotic diseases and OSM over 
expression in animal models has been shown to result in fibrotic c hanges.30, 34 
In a Phase 1b study  (KPL-716-C001) , KPL -[ADDRESS_1093728] -716 is therefore being investigated in this Phase 2 study for its effica cy in 
reducing pruritus in patients with a variety of chronic pruritic condit ions (primary endpoint).  
The reduction in pruritus is anticipated to improve sleep and quali ty of life.  Therefore, this 
study will investigate the impact of KPL -716 on sleep and quality of life (secondary 
endpoints).

After the informed consent form ( ICF) is signed, subjects will enter the Screening Period for 
assessment of eligibility.   
During the Screening Visit, subject’s medical and surgical histor y will be reviewed including 
allergic history.  Re view of medical history will include the specific cohort disease his tory and 
history of co -morbidities.  Prior and concomitant  medications, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_793213] .  Subjects will be instructed on the required washout for specific exc luded 
medications.  
Vital signs  and body weight  will be measured, and subjects will undergo a full physical 
examination.  Clinical laboratory tests and an ECG will be performed.   Urine drug screen and 
pregnancy test (if applicable) will also be performed.   
To be eligible for study participation, subjects must have moderate t o severe pruritus, defined 
as WI -NRS ≥  7 at the Screening Visit and a mean weekly WI -NRS ≥  5 for each of the two 
consecutive weeks immediately prior to randomization.  A minimum of 85 % co mpliance with 
daily WI -NRS recording during the last 14 days of Screening Period prior to randomiz ation is 
required for eligibility unless approved by [CONTACT_1034].   
At the Screening Visit, subjects will be asked to rate their pruritus  severity (WI -NRS) in  the 
previous [ADDRESS_1093734] their 
daily rating of WI -NRS and two sleep parameters, difficulty falling asleep NRS and sleep 
quality NRS, from the beginning of screening to Day 1.  The daily  recordings (WI -NRS, 
difficulty falling asleep NRS, and sleep quality NRS) will continue  throughout the study for 
eligible subjects that proceed to dosing.   
Furthermore, s ubjects with CIU will also be instructed to complete  on a daily basis the UAS7 
quest ionnaire (on itch and hives severity) from the beginning of screeni ng to Day 1.  Daily 
completion of the UAS7 questionnaire will continue throughout the s tudy for eligible CIU 
subjects that proceed to dosing.  
Additional assessments at the Screening Visit i nclude those related to pruritus (Pruritus VAS, 
and 5 -D Pruritus), sleep (Sleep Loss VAS),  dermatology life quality index (DLQI)  and Itchy 
quality of life ( ItchyQoL).

A loading dose of KPL -716 720 mg (2x mainte nance dose) or matching placebo will be 
administered via two (2)  SC injections within [ADDRESS_1093737] -716 (360 mg maintenance dose) or matching placebo will be 
administered by [CONTACT_793236] s via a single SC 
injection.   
All procedures assigned to dosing days are performed prior to study drug admi nistration.  The 
following activities will take place prior to each maintenance dose:  
• Review of concomitant medications, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649]  
• Review of adverse events  
• Review of subject compliance  
• Vital signs (performed before and after dosing on each dosing day)  
• Completion of Pruritus VAS, Sleep Loss VAS  
• Blood collection fo r PK 
 
The following activities will take place prior to maintenance dos ing at designated study visits 
as outlined in Appendix 1 : 
• Physical examination  
• Collection of safety blood and urine samples

28 January 2019 (Version 1.0)  Page [ADDRESS_1093738] -716 at 360 mg administered to healthy volunteers 
demonstrated that peak blood concentrations of 31 µg/mL were achieved slowly in 125 hours 
and declined with a half -life of 168 hours (7 days).  Comparison of PK parameters  across 
dose levels and routes of administration in healthy volunteers and  subjects with atopic 
dermatitis showed that exposures were similar in the two study populations. In both 
populations, as dose increased, half -life also increased consistent with a T MDD proﬁle.  
Furthermore, bioavailability between healthy volunteers and atopic dermatitis subjects at the 
evaluated dose levels was generally comparable (42% vs. 65%); the numb er of subjects in 
these analyses were small. Based on the similarities in PK parameters betw een healthy 
volunteers and atopic dermatitis subjects despi[INVESTIGATOR_793214], it is likely that PK parameters in other chronic pruritic conditions  (such as CI U, CIP, 
LP, LSC and PPs)  will also follow the sa me patterns.   
The weekly SC dosing regimen is proposed to ensure subsequent doses ar e administered 
before a significant decline in blood concentrations has occurred s o as to reach  initial KPL -
716 exposure levels similar to those achieved with 7.5 mg/kg IV  as a single dose. A loading 
dose of 720 mg is administered in this Phase 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_793215] a chieve blood 
concentrations that are likely to provide clinical benefit sooner  in particular given the short 
treatment duration of this exploratory study.  720 mg was chosen for the loading dose since 
the peak concentration levels from  this dose are anticipated to be less than those achieved by 
7.5 mg/kg IV, which showed acceptable safety and tolerability in the si ngle dose study. A 
loading dose that is twic e maintenance is typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], in particular to minimize risk of dosing 
errors.  Based on PK modeling, the expected C max and C trough from a loading dose of [ADDRESS_1093739] administered dose (500 mg/kg IV) was ide ntified as the 
NOAEL. In a chronic toxicology study, weekly administration of KPL -716 by [CONTACT_793237] 200 mg/kg for 26 weeks (27 total doses) was wel l tolerated in 
cynomolgus monkeys. Based on these results under the conditions and d uration of the study 
provided in the study report, the NOAEL was considered to be 200 mg/kg IV /SC, the highest 
dose tested. The number of doses (total of 8) and the dose level s (720 mg loading dose and 
360 mg maintenance  dose or 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg in a 72 kg adult, respectively) in this 
Phase 2a study fall well under the number of doses (total of  27) and the NOAEL (200 mg/kg) 
in the chronic toxicology study.   
The available safety data support the selection of above dose levels. I n the first -in-human 
study (KPL -716- C001), 50 healthy volunteers (Part 3) and 32 subjects with atopic dermatiti s

that follow -up is no longer necessary, or the subject withdraws consent from the study o r is 
lost to follow up.  
The causal relationship between an AE and the study drug will be defined a s below:  
• Not Related: when the AE is definitely caused  by [CONTACT_423]’s underlying clinical 
state, or the study procedure/conditions  
• Unlikely Related: when the temporal association between the AE and the d rug is 
such that the drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with t he AE  
 
Protocol KPL -716- C202  CONFIDENTIAL   
28 January 2019 (Version 1.0)  Page 54 of 78 • Possibly Related: when the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the 
time of drug administration but could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical 
state or the study procedures/conditions  
• Related: when the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
adminis tration of the drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a  
known or hypothesized cause -effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears 
when the drug is reintroduced   
The severity of an AE will be recorded as one of the following:  
• Mild:  easily tolerated, does not interfere with normal daily activities, does n ot 
require intervention  
• Moderate:  causes some interference with daily activities; minimal, local or 
noninvasive intervention indicated  
• Severe:  medically significant event; daily activities limited or completely  halted;

Adverse Drug Reactions  
All noxious and unintended responses to an investigational medicina l product (IMP; i.e., 
where a causal relationship between an IMP and an AE is at least a reasonable p ossibility) 
related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions.   
Serious A dverse Events  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death, includes all deaths, even those that appear to be comp letely 
unrelated to study drug (e.g., car accident where subject is a passenger)  
• is life -threatenin g.  An AE is life -threatening if the subject was at immediate risk 
of death from the event as it occurred (i.e., does not include a reaction that  might 
have caused death if it had occurred in a more serious form).  For instance, dr ug-
induced hepatitis that  resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be 
considered life -threatening even though drug -induced hepatitis can be fatal  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10240]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_793223] t has been admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_793224] -
stay-type unit, or an emergency room stay for longer than 24 hours for obs ervation 
and/or treatment at a level of care which would not have been appropriate a t the 
study site s.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_275547] a pre -existing non -worsening

substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  An 
AE is incapacitating or disabling if it results in a substantial  and/or permanent 
disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life funct ions 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is an i mportant medical event  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based upon appropriat e medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or s urgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
All SAEs will be followed until resolution , until the Investigator and the Sponsor agree that 
follow -up is no longer necessary, or the subject  withdraws consent from the study o r is lost to 
follow  up.   
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Investigator Reporting Responsibilities to the Sponsor  
SAEs due to any cause, whether or not related to the study drug, must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of occurrence or w hen the Investigator becomes aware

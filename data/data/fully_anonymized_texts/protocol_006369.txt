light (c -TLT), then a session with sham (s -TLT) and one session with 
pulse light (p -TLT). Before and after e ach session, subjects will 
undergo  DCS, which will allow measuring the impact of the 
interv ention on cerebral blood flow. We expect that out of 30 subjects 
enrolled 10 subjects will be eligible to complete the study.  The study 
will be conducted in single b lind.

 3. Introduction   
Transcranial Light Therapy (TLT) with near -infrared light has recently emerged as a 
potential new antidepressant treatment in both animal models  1 and human studies 2–4. TLT 
consists of delivering invisible near -infrared radiation (NIR) , or red light  to the scalp of the 
subject , which penetrates the skull and modulates function of the adjacent cortical areas of 
the brain. Red and/or near -infrared light appear s to increase cellular brain metabolism and 
neuroplasticity, and to modulate endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], while decreasing inflammation and 
oxidative stre ss 5–7. TLT has been shown to penetrate deeply into the cerebral cortex 8–10, to 
modulate cortical excitability [ADDRESS_141575] suggested that it can significantly improve cognition in healthy subjects 13–15, 
and in subjects with traumatic brain injury  16–18. The safety of TLT has been studied in a 
sample of  1,[ADDRESS_141576] s, with no significant differences in rates of adverse 
events between TLT an d sham exposure 19–21.  Converging evidence from uncontrolled 
studies suggests both an antidepressant and anxiolytic effect of TLT in subjects suffering 
from Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) 2–4. It is critically important to understand the 
biological targets of TLT and w e hypothesize that the improvement in cerebral brain flow 
is one of the underlying mechanism for the boost in bioenergetic metabolism leading to 
therapeutic effects, such as enhancement of cognitive functioning.   
3.1 Summary of Prior Clinical Experience  
 
We conducted two studies on the safety an d efficacy of TLT  delivered to the forehead 
(prefrontal cortex) twice a week in subjects with MDD.  
 
ELATED -1 was  a proof of concept study of 3 weeks of TLT (Neurothera - class IV 
laser, wavelength 808 nm; irradiance 700 mW/cm2; fluence of 84 J/cm2; total energy 
2.4 kJ per session for 6 sessions) ( 6). All subjects (n=4) were treated with TLT. 
Baseline mean Hamilton Depression rating scale ( HAM -D-17) scores for depression 
decreased from 19.8±4.4 (SD) to 13±5.35 (SD) aft er treatment (p=0.004).   
 
ELATED -2 was a double -blind, randomized, controlled study of 8 weeks of TLT 
(Omnilux New U - LED, 830 nm; 36.2 mW/cm2; up to 65.2 J/cm2; vs. sham for 16 
sessions). At endpoint, the mean HAMD -17 for depression decreased of 11.7±7.5 
points ( TLT, n=9) vs. 5.3±7.0 points (sham, n=9) (p=0.04); the differences were even 
more pronounced in the completers sample as HAMD -17 decreased of 15.7±4.4 ( TLT, 
n=6) points vs. 6.1±7.9 points (sham, n=7) (p=0.01).  
 
These findings suggest that  TLT could be a novel intervention for subject s with MDD.  
Both the Laser  study (ELATED -1) and the LED  study (ELATED -2) were conducted by 
[CONTACT_126004][INVESTIGATOR_307] ( MGH ).  
 
NIR-flow (the present submission) will test for the first time  the biological 
underpi[INVESTIGATOR_125983] , by [CONTACT_126005] .

.    
 The LiteCure® The PhotoBioModulation -1000 (TPBM -1000)  device to be used in this 
study does not require  Food and Drug Administration  (FDA ) approval. In fact, the 
TPBM -1000 device used in this study is considered a non -significant risk device 
because:  
 TPBM -1000 dose does not exceed the Maximum Permissible Exposure 
(MPE) for skin – Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH),  
21CFR1040.10 and 21CFR1040.11;  
 TPBM-1000  is substantially equivalent to the OmniLux New U device (used 
in ELATED -2 at MGH), which the FDA has already categorized as a non -
significant risk device;    
 TPBM -1000  differs from the OmniLux  New U  only in that it provides an 
additional site of irradiation – treatment is delivered to EEG sites FP1 and 
FP2 in addition to F3 and F4 on the forehead;  
 currently FDA -cleared LED devices are typi[INVESTIGATOR_125984] -the-counter 
and are considered saf e to use without professional supervision.  
3.2 Overview of LiteCure  Light Emitting Diode ( LED ) System  
LiteCure® TPBM -1000  is a new device with the flexibility to safely deliver either 
continuous light (c -TLT), pulsed light (p-TLT), or sham.   The TPBM -1000  device  is 
configured for in-office use. 
 
TPBM -1000  deliver s NIR light output at 830 +/ - 30 nm.  The NIR output is invisible to 
the naked eye, thus, the  device includes visual  and/or audible  indicators of light 
emission , and is designed to deliver light to  EEG sites: Fp1, Fp2, F3 and F4, covering a 
total surface active t reatment area, of  35.8 cm2[(11.52 cm2x2) + (6.38 cm2x2)]  with an 
average irradiance of 54.8 mW/cm2 and an average fluence of 65.8 J/cm2.  While the 
average fluence (energy density) is comparable to the Omnilux New U , the treatment 
area is significantly less  for the TPBM -1000  (Omnilux New 28.7 cm2 x2, which results 
in less total energy delivered per session of 2.3 kJ (compared to up to 3.7 kJ for the 
Omnilux New U) .   
 
TPBM -1000  devices  will be fabricated  to deliver either c -TLT, p -TLT, or Sham  (s-
TLT) . In simple terms, in either TLT mode the TPBM -1000  device delivers therapeutic 
NIR energy; in sham the device will not deliver any light energy. The apparent 
behavior (i.e. the performance/output of all visible and audible indicators) of the  device 
in any of the three programmed treatment modalities will be identical , ensuring the 
study is blinded to the operator.  In addition, because of the low average irradiances 
delivered in e ither c -TLT and p -TLT modes the subject s will not experience any 
heating sensation ensuring the study is single -blind. The device will shut off 
automatically if skin temperature above 41C were detected . 
 
The TPBM -1000  devices  consists of a source of light,  mounted on a cap, attached to a 
console that controls the  light delivery modality: c -TLT, p -TLT, or Sham .

.    
 3.3 Overview of the DCS Device  
Separate  hybrid FDNIRS -DCS instrument s are  described in detailed in the relative 
medical device brochure.    FDNIRS -DCS d evices are approximately 23” (l) x 18” (w) 
x 9” (h). Technical specs are provided at:  
 iss.com/biomedical/instruments/metaox.html . The devices are limited by [CONTACT_4496] (or 
[LOCATION_002]) l aw to investigational use. The devices contain no conductive patient 
leads and no user serviceable parts. They have a highest rated current of 3 Amp and 
are designed for safety compliance with UL/IEC [ADDRESS_141577] Edition as a Class I, 
Type B device. Prior t o investigational use, devices are tested for conformance with 
ground bond, earth leakage, and enclosure leakage requirements. The devices are not 
yet under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational device exemption 
(IDE) regulations, and are cons idered non -significant risk. During the conduct of 
human studies the investigators should follow good clinical practice requirements and 
21 CFR 812 investigational device exemption regulations.  
 
The FDNIRS portion of the instrument consists of 8 radio - frequency (110 MHz) 
modulated laser diodes operating at 8 different wavelengths ranging from 670 -830 
nm and 2 to 4 photomultiplier tube (PMT) detectors for heterodyne detection (similar 
to the Imagent from ISS, Inc).  
The DCS component of the instrument consi sts of a long -coherence length [ADDRESS_141578] fiber optics. Each probe consists of 1 source and 
up to 8 detector fiber bundles terminated with 90 deg prisms providing mu ltiple 
source -detector separations (ranging from 0.3 to up to 5 cm).    
The optical parameters for the FNIRS - DCS device s can be summarized as follows, 
irradiance 250 -400 mW /cm2; area: 0.0962 cm2 and 10 min exposure (twice 10 min, 
before and after the session with TPBM -1000); fluence: 150 -240 J/cm2. Total energy 
delivered in 10 min by [CONTACT_126006] -DCS device s: 14.43 – 23.08 J (this energy will be 
delivered twice before and after  each TPBM -1000 sessions). The incremental 
exposure to NIR resulting from the FNIRS -DCS device s are minimal: in fact the NIR 
light is shed to a tiny area 1/350 of the area irradiated by [CONTACT_126007] -1000 and the energy 
shed in 10 min by [CONTACT_126006] -DCS are  inferior to the total energy shed by [CONTACT_126008] -
1000 by [CONTACT_726] 2 orders of magnitude.   
 
3.1 Overview of the EEG  Device  
 
The StatX24 (Advance Brain Monitoring)  is an internally battery powered Type BF 
device intended for continuous use (16 -17 hours). The StatX24 provides an integrated 
approach for wireless acquisition and recording of electroencephalographic (EEG), 
electrooculographic (EOG), and electrocardiographic (ECG) signals. The system 
 
  
                           Page [ADDRESS_141579] channel, are differential channels.  The 22nd -24th 
channels are referential channels. The StatX24 consists of: (1) StatX24 Headset with 
a Bluetooth (BT) Receiving Unit for bi -directional transmission of digitized 
physiological signals, (2) a Neoprene Strap, and (3) a Strip with EEG sensors s ites in 
the standard 10 -20 format + POz (Fz, Cz, Pz, F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, O2, T5, T3, 
F7, Fp1, Fp2, F8, T4, and T6 with Linked Mastoids).  
The Sensor Headset collects signals from the sensors placed on the patient and 
performs analog -to-digital conve rsion, encoding, formatting, and transmitting of all 
signals. The signals communicate using a 2.[ADDRESS_141580] of TLT (NIR) on 
brain metabolism is the primary putative mechanism for its therapeutic effects.  In 
experimental and animal models NIR (and red) light delivered noninvasively is 
absorbed by [CONTACT_9058] c oxidase, and by [CONTACT_126009][INVESTIGATOR_125985], leads to increased adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) production  22. In a study on 
healthy subjects, TLT (NIR) improved cerebral oxygenation, supposedly through a 
mechanism of neurovascular coupling, which entails an increase in cerebral blood 
flow coupled with increased oxygen demands 12.  Similarly, a study in MDD subjects 
found that a single session of t -PBM led to a nearly significant increase in regional 
cerebral blood flow 2 ─ both studies relied on functional NIR spectroscopy (fNIRs) to 
assess, respectively, oxygenation and blood flow.   In a case report of moderate, 
chronic TBI, the improvement in brain perfusion subsequent to TLT was imaged with 
single positron emission computerized tomography (SPECT) 23. 
 
Cognitive Tasks  
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are 
uniquely situated to play a critical role in learning , executive functions, attention and 
inhibition . Studies have shown that DLPFC exhibits significant plasticity  during the 
learning process, in which neuronal activity changes to dynamically encode and 
recode procedural memories once a sensory motor association has been made. The 
purpose of this study is to determine whether TLT can be used to change the speed at 
which subjects learn and perform in cognitive tasks .  TLT applied to prefrontal

.    
 regions of the brain implicated in visual -motor learning processes can enhance neural 
plasticity and improve behavioral performance.  
 
Electroencephalogram  
EEG recorded at the sc alp offers the opportunity to access the synchronization of 
oscillatory frequencies (1Hz to 100Hz) from within and between cortical regions, 
revealing network changes that reflect abnormal connectivity. Synchronization within 
and between cortical regions i s of interest in the field of TLT. In animal models of 
depression, TLT was found to regulate  the EEG  tracing  in all wave frequency bands 
except for theta . Similar effects have been documented in dementia subjects who 
experienced normalization of delta and alpha waves power during the course of a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_125986] (Berman M & Hamblin M unpublished data).

4.2 Study De sign 
This study is a single -blind, sham -controlled, study on the use of Transcranial  
continuous  light therapy (c-TLT)  and pulse  light therapy  (p-TLT) as an enhancer of 
cerebral blood flow in healthy subjects .    
 
We expect that out of 30 subjects enrolled 10 subjects will be eligible to complete a 
sequence of three sessions of  Transcranial  Light  Treatment  (TLT ) and sham.   
 
 
  
                           Page 13 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 All eligible subjects  will receive two  TLT sessions and one of s ham (s-TLT)  within 
the course of 5 weeks . While the sequence  (c-TLT, s -TLT, p -TLT)  will be the same 
for all subjects, the subject s will be blind to the specific mode of function used in 
each session.  
 
The study site (MGH ) will have one Litecure device , which will recognize the 
subjects’  codes generated by [CONTACT_4305]. Only  subjects will be blind to the 
treatment group assignment. The Sham treatment consists of applying all the 
procedures for the delivery of the TLT, while actually delivering no light. The 
blinding of the sham will be effective b ecause the radiation is not visible and because 
the active therapy (continuous or pulsed) will not produce any subject -discernable 
difference from sham, e.g., skin warming. T he sham treatment will mimic the TLT 
procedure. The tr eatment will be bilateral and applied to the frontal areas with two 
application site s on the left side and two on the right side [left and right forehead 
centered on EEG sites on F3 , F4, Fp1, Fp2 ]. Energy is administered with a radiation 
wavelength of 830 nm. The duration of irradiation is 20 minutes at each application 
site (the 4 sites are irradiated at the same time which is equivalent to 20 minutes of 
total time ). The entire sessions is estimated to last about 1.[ADDRESS_141581] the necessary protections (e.g. goggles), to inspect the 
subject’s skin, to complete DCS before and after TLT, to set the TLT devices , and to 
give the subje ct time to rest after the irradiation. TLT treatment will only be 
administered by [CONTACT_126011] (i.e. MDs) who are on study staff. All staff who 
deliver treatment must pass training that is approved by [CONTACT_126012]. The treatment wi ll follow these specifications: wavelength 830  nm; 
average irradiance 54.8 mW/cm2; average fluence of 65.8 J/cm2 (consistently with  
energy density used in the ELATED -2 study at MGH with the device  Omnilux  New 
U).

 4.7 Study Visits  
Study visits occur a t MGH Center for Anxiety and Traumatic Stress Disorder 
(CATSD ) in [LOCATION_011] .  
 
The study involves screening,  3 TLT session paired with Diffuse Correlation 
Spectroscopy (DCS), and one  follow -up visit.  
 
Screening Visit (Week 1)  
The screening visit is expected to take about 2 hours. The Principal Investigator (PI) 
at the site or a Sub -investigator will assess subjects  against the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.  If a subject  appears to qualify and agrees to participat e in the 
study, then the subject  will undergo the informed consent process prior to initiation of 
any study -specific activities. Screening Case Report Forms (CRFs) will be completed 
and subjects who qualify to pa rticipate in the study will proceed to the first Treatment 
Visit 1. If the subject does not meet entry criteria, the Investigator will document the 
subject’s ineligibility for study participation and complete the appropriate CRFs.   
 
TLT-DCS  Visits – Visit s 2-4 (Weeks 2-4)  
There is  one TLT session per week for [ADDRESS_141589] of 
all subjects receiving  TLT, with DCS before and after TLT.  Two groups of 
assessments will be conducted: 1. Before the TLT session  to reflect the symptoms 
endorsed in the past week : Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire  (ASQ ), Symptoms of 
Depression Questionnaire  SDQ , Quality of Life in N eurological Disorders ( Neuro -
QoL), Sexual Functioning Inventory ( SFI), Systemic Assessment for Treatment 
Emergent Events ( SAFTEE) , and 2. After the TLT session  to reflect the immediate 
changes associated with the session : Positive and Negative Symptoms Questionnaire 
(PANAS ), TLT Self -Report Questionnaire ( TSRQ ), Perceptions of Blinding 
Questionnaire ( PBQ). C ognitive tasks  will occur right after the TLT session .  A 
detailed description of the study visits can be found below.  EEG recording will 
immediately precede and follow the DCS -TLT-DCS triad and will in part overlap 
with the cognitive task.  
 
Follow -Up Visit  – Visit 5 
All subjects will undergo  assessments including ASQ, SDQ, Neuro -QoL, SFI, 
SAFTEE, PANAS  and cognitive tasks at the follow -up visit (Week 5).  
 
4.8 Detailed Study Visits  
4.8.1 Screening Visit – Visits 1 (Week 1) 
Purpose  
The purpose of the Screening Visit will be to determine the eligibility of subject s 
for participation in the NIR-flow  study.  
 
 
 
  
                           Page 16 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 Procedures  
The screening visit will occur at the MGH Center for Anxiety and Traumatic Stress 
Disorders (CATSD) in [LOCATION_011]. At this visit subjects will be consented for the study, 
will receive a psychiatric evaluation, and will be screened for presence of 
psychiatric disorders using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic 
Statistical Manual -IV (SCID -IV).  The SDQ, ASQ and PANAS will be used to 
assess for subthreshold sympto ms. The SFI and NEURO -QoL will be used to assess 
sexual and cognitive functioning.  
 
Routine laboratory tests (Urine Tox Screen and Urine Pregnancy Test) and 
complete physical exam including vitals and weight will be performed at screen; the 
tests will be processed by a laboratory at MGH.  
 
Once all tests and procedures become available for review, the Investigator will 
then proceed to closely re -evaluate the subject for all the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.  
4.8.2 TLT -DCS Visits – Visits 2 -4 (Weeks 2-4)                                                                                                                                      
The TLT s essions will occur once  weekly for three weeks at  the MGH Martinos 
Center for Biomedical Imaging in Charlestown . Subjects missing one session will 
be allowed to still receive their TLT session, by [CONTACT_126016]. The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_125988]. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_125989]. The device  TPBM -[ADDRESS_141590] about 50 min – [ADDRESS_141591] will comfortably lie down on a n exam bed  or sit 
on a recliner . The sites of application of TLT (left and right forehead) will be 
inspected for any possible skin lesi ons (e.g. laceration or signs of inflammation) 
which would contraindicate the treatment. The study staff administering the TPBM 
device at the TLT -DCS sessions will appropriately remove any reflective objects to 
fall into or obstruct the path of the light e nergy produced by [CONTACT_126017]. Both the 
subject receiving the  TLT and the study staff will wear protective eyewear in the 
form of goggles .  During treatment sessions the office will be kept completely dark 
and a warning sign will hang  at the office door.  The staff will be provided training 
on basic safety procedures relative to the use of the device.  
 
 
  
                           Page [ADDRESS_141592]  safety goggles will be selected ba sed on the TLT 
biophysical properties, in accordance to the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) guidelines. The delivery of the TLT is expected to last 20 
min total (simultaneous application on the left and right forehead). The subject wil l 
be asked to rest for five minutes after the delivery of TLT. The skin at the sites of 
the application will be inspected again prior to dismissing the subject. A log with 
the dates of treatment delivery per each study subject will be kept at MGH CATSD  
([LOCATION_011]) .  
 
During TLT-DCS  Visit 2-4, subjects will receive  TLT-c (Visit 2), TLT -s (Visit 3) 
and TLT -p (Visit 4) .

4.8.4 Termination  
We will encourage  subjects to complete the follow -up visit  in the study regardless of 
discontinuation of the TLT  sessions .   
4.9 Scales & Forms  
We will offer clinical interviews and study forms in English. All scales will explore 
the past 7 days except for SCID (lifetime), PANAS (past 5 min), TSRQ and PBQ 
(both past session). Below are brief descriptions of the forms that will be utilized in 
this study.  
 Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -IV (SCID -I/P) – The SCID -I/P, 
administered by [CONTACT_15370], proceeds by [CONTACT_126018]. Questions here are asked exactly as written, and each is 
based on the individual  criteria from DSM -IV. Answers are generally rated on a 
scale of 1 -3 (1 = doubtful, 2 = probable, 3 = definite), and based on the number of 
positive answers, a diagnosis is determined. The entire SCID -I/P is administered 
at screening as per Table 1.   
 Symp toms of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ) – This is a comprehensive 
measure of depression that includes the assessment of symptoms in the anxiety –
depression spectrum. It assesses irritability, anger attacks, and anxiety symptoms 
together with the commonly con sidered symptoms of depression. Analysis of the 
factor structure of the SDQ identified 5 subscales, including one in the anxiety –
depression spectrum, with adequate internal consistency and concurrent validity.  
 Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (ASQ) – This, is a 17 -item self -report 
questionnaire measuring the frequency and intensity of 17 symptoms of anxiety, 
including nervousness, worrying, irritability, trouble relaxing, insomnia, lack of 
energy, difficulty concentrating, somatic symptoms, and impairment in  
functioning due to anxiety.  
 Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE -SI) – The 
SAFTEE is a commonly used instrument originally developed by [CONTACT_126019] a self -report instrument. The version of the scale that we plan to use 
 
  
                           Page 19 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 is the same used by [CONTACT_15747] -center, NIMH -sponsored CO -MED trial, and it 
examines in a systematic fashion all possible treatment -emergent side effects and 
probes specific adverse symptoms, including suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and 
self-injurious behavi or.  
 Positive and Negative Symptoms Questionnaire (PANAS) – The [ADDRESS_141593]. Each item is rated on a 5 -point scale ranging from 1 = 
very slightly or not at all to 5 = extremely to indicate the extent to which the 
respondent has felt this way in the indicated time frame. The authors have used 
the scale to measure affect at this moment, today, the past few days, the past 
week, the past few weeks, the past year,  and generally (on average).  
 Adverse Events Form - the Adverse Events Form captures any adverse event 
(serious or otherwise) specifically related to the application of the TLT. This 
form will help to determine if the side effects of the TLT are too great fo r a 
participant to continue in the study.  
 Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro -QoL Item Bank v2.0 – 
cognition function – short form) - The cognitive section of the Neuro -QoL is an 
8 item self -rated measure of both executive function and general concerns. It 
measures perceived difficulties in cognitive abilities (e.g., memory, attention, and 
decision making) or in the application of such abilities to everyday tasks (e.g., 
planning, organizing, calculating, remembering and learning).  
 [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125991] (MGH -SFI) -
This is a subject -rated self -report outcome measure that quantifies sexual 
dysfunction into 5 functional domains (“interest in sex,” “sexual arousal,” “ability 
to achieve orgasm,” “ability to maintai n erection” [males only], and “sexual 
satisfaction”).  
  The TLT Self -Report Questionnaire (TSRQ)  – An open -ended questionnaire 
focusing on potential inconveniences and discomforts from the TLT.  
 Concomitant medications form – This form will be completed at  every TLT 
study visit, including the screening visit, as a safety -monitoring tool.  
 The Perceptions of Blinding Questionnaire (PBQ): the PBQ is a self -report 
questionnaire to determine the degree to which the participant believes s/he is 
receiving the treatment or the sham.  
4.10 Cognitive tests  
n-Back Task : The subject is presented with a sequence of stimuli, and the task consists 
of indicating when the current stimulus matches the one from  n steps earlier in the 
sequence. The load factor  n can be adjusted to make the task more or less difficult.  
The n-back task captures the active part of working memory. When  n equals 2 or more, 
it is not enough to simply keep a representation of recently presented items in mind; the 
working memory buffer also needs to be updated continuously to keep track of what the 
current stimulus must be compared to . To accomplish this task, the subject needs to b oth 
maintain and manipulate information in working memory .  
 
  
                           Page 20 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 4.11 EEG recording  
The participant will be fitted with an EEG sensor headset and ECG leads  to start their 
resting state data acquisition. For resting state acquisition with eyes open, the participant 
will be asked to relax, sit still and focus on a cross on the computer for 5 minutes while 
EEG data is acquired. The participant will be instructed to try to limit blinking and any face 
movement including clenching their jaw. Several acquisitions and/or lon ger acquisitions 
may be necessary if the participant is particularly restless. The participant will then be 
asked to relax and close their eyes for 5 minutes during the eyes closed resting state 
acquisition. Multiple and/or longer eyes closed acquisitions may be necessary if the 
participant has difficulty or is unable to sit still for 5 minutes. Any issues, including 
inability to remain still for the acquisition, should be noted in the participant's file.  
 
 Data Collection Forms  
All study subjects will be blind to  TLT assignment  (single -blind) . A number of 
procedures are in place to assure data integrity and protocol adherence. We will use 
Research Electronic Data Capture to support direct data entry by [CONTACT_1130] s and study staff. 
REDCap is a free, secure, HI PAA compliant web -based application hosted by [CONTACT_126020], Enterprise Research Infrastructure & Services (ERIS) 
group. Web -based surveys rely on a study -specific data dictionary defined by [CONTACT_126021]/The Harvard Clinical and 
Translational Science Center EDC Support Staff. These support staff will then oversee the 
automated export of study data from REDCap to a relational study database in Microsoft 
Access 2000, a llowing for systematic data querying and checking.  
Self-report measures will be completed by [CONTACT_112503] a computer, directly into 
REDCap, thus minimizing errors due to data entry.  For clinician -administered measures, 
all clinicians and independent e valuators (IEs) will enter responses directly in REDCap.  
 
To minimize missing data for self -report forms, we will program missed question 
warnings in REDCap that will alert participants in real -time if they inadvertently skip a 
question.  Participants may  then go back and answer any missed questions, or, if they 
intentionally skipped questions, they may ignore the warning message and continue answer 
the remaining questions.  We will also program real -time range checks in REDCap that 
generate error messages  if a value outside the acceptable range is entered for a given field.  
To ensure confidentiality, data will be identified in the database only by [CONTACT_18022], 
visit number, and date of visit. By [CONTACT_46773], the information 
can be considered ‘de -identified’ and therefore compliant with the Standards for Privacy of 
Individually Identifiable Health Information (“Privacy Rule”) of the Health Insurance 
Portability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Any data that is transmitted electronically w ill be fully 
encrypted and password protected. Subjects’ names will not be entered into the database; 
each will be uniquely identified only by [CONTACT_31258]. Consent forms, any hard copy PHI, 
and any study measures that are completed on paper will be kept a nd filed in locked office 
cabinets.  
 
  
                           Page [ADDRESS_141594]  rated assessments (see assessments), screening data, fidelity data, visit 
adherence data  and rater reliability data and safety reporting , including  DCS and cognitive 
data. Weekly reports  from REDCap  will monitor subject enrollment, completion, attrition, 
and individual subject progress as well as the completion of critical assessments. 
Additional reports will be done as needed to monitor baseline cha racteristics, protocol 
adherence, and other issues of interest.  
 
All measures that are completed on paper will be entered by [CONTACT_126022] , and 
a two pass verification system will be used to minimize any data entry errors. All records in 
REDCap have a form completion status that may be Incomplete (appears as a red circle in 
Record Status Dashboard), Unverified (yellow circle), or Verified. The RA initially 
entering data will save each record entered as Unverified (at which point it will appear as a 
yellow circle in the Record Status Dashboard). A second RA at each site will then go into 
each unverified record, compare each entered value against the paper source document, 
make any corrections, and then re -save the record as Verified (at which point it w ill appear 
as a green circle in the Record Status Dashboard). The color coding system built into 
REDCap readily allows for identification of unverified records.  
 
Coded data may be sent to collaborators within and outside of Partners for research 
purposes. Coded sample/data may be shared with for profit companies that are working 
with Partners researchers, such as Litecure, LLC or Advanced Brain Monitoring, Inc (the 
manufacturer of the EEG device used this in study). Samples/data will not be sold to 
anyone f or profit.  Data may also be shared with other Partners IRB approved protocols 
supervised by [CONTACT_126023].  
 
4.[ADDRESS_141595]. The two 
means of assuring that the treatment modalities will not be disclosed to subjects  include  
detectors sen sitive to heating of the skin  (which will switch off the device to prevent 
overheating)  and the introduction of a rating scale for subjects to assess their best guess on 
treatment assignment.  
 
 
  
                           Page 22 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 The performance/output of all visible and audible indicators is  identical for all three 
treatment modalities, (i.e. other than  the emission of invisible light radiation, the behavior 
of the system is identical for all).  
4.15      Compensation  
 Subjects will be compensated $50 per screen (only if deemed eligible) and $100 per 
TLT-DCS visit, and $50 per follow -up visit; for a total of $400, if all five visits are 
completed. Compensation will be provided after Weeks 2 ($150), 3 ($100), 4 ($100), an d 5 
($50), with the correspondent amount subtracted for each visit missed. Any research

 Anticipated Adverse Device Effect is defined as any adverse effect related  to 
the device or procedure, which is identified in the protocol . 
 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects is defined as any serious adverse 
effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, 
or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary pla n or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.

Recording of physiological data with the EEG system poses no known 
health risk. Participants may experience mild discomfort due to the pressur e exerted 
by [CONTACT_126025] r headset; to minimize this risk, caps are adjustable and sensor strips are 
available in a variety of sizes.  Discomfort may also arise from a mild allergic 
response to extended exposure to the conductive gel used in the EEG sensors; to 
mitigate this risk, alcohol wipes will be available to remove the gel immediately to 
reduce any allergic reactions.

The s ite Principal Investigator (Dr . Cassano) will have monthly  conference 
calls or meetings  (which will include study RAs); during these conference calls he 
will discuss all Adverse Event reports to identify any safety concern, based on such 
concerns he will be able to decide temporary discontinuation of study enrollment, 
modifications of the study protocol, or to terminate the study .   
 
Research assistants responsible for data collection and storage will be aware 
of and comply with all regulatory requirements related to adverse events.  In the 
event that a subject  becomes ill or is injured as a direct result of study participation, 
medica l care will be made available.  All adverse events (and device events) will be 
followed to resolution and reported to the MGH IRB as serious in the ev ent that 1. 
they are unanticipated and possibly related to the study (same reporting as SAE) or 
2. if they  meet any one of the following criteria: Any fatal event, immediately life -
threatening event, permanently or substantially disabling event, event requiring or 
prolonging inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any congenital anomaly. This also includes 
any event tha t a study investigator judges to impose a significant hazard, 
contraindication, side effect, or precaution.   
 
Expedited review will occur for all events meeting the FDA definition of 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) – i.e., any fatal event, immediately life -threatening 
event, permanently or substantially disabling event, event requiring or prolonging 
inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any congenital anomaly. This also includes any event 
that a study investigator judges to impose a significant hazard, contraindicat ion, 
side effect, or precaution.  Notification by e -mail of all related study forms shall be 
made to the  IRB within 2 days of the occurrence of any SAE.  Information will be 
reviewed and a determination made of whether there was any possible relevance to 
the study TLT exposure.  Additional reporting to l ocal IRBs will be done within 5 
business days/[ADDRESS_141600]’s source  document and on the appropriate CRF pages.  
The following attributes must be assigned:  
 
1. Description of event  
2. Date of onset  
3. Date of resolution (if applicable)  
4. Seriousness  
5. Relationship to the study device and/or procedure(s)

.    
 8. Outcome(s)  
 
Intensity is defined as a measure of the severity of a reac tion, effect or experience. 
The measurement(s) are described as mild, moderate or severe. The event itself, 
however, may be of relative minor medical significance.  
 
The intensity of Adverse Events is assessed as mild, moderate or severe according 
to the following index scale:  
 
Mild  
The Adverse Event is transient, requires no treatment, and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activity.  
Moderate  
The Adverse Event introduces a low level of inconvenience or concern to 
the subject and may interfere with daily activities, but is usually ameliorated 
by [CONTACT_14212].  
Severe  
The Adverse Event interrupts the subject’s usual daily activity and requires 
systematic therapy or other treatment.  
 
If the Adverse Event is of such intensity in the Investigator’s judgment that it 
warrants withdrawal from the study, the subject should be withdrawn from 
treatment. The subject should be given appropriate care under medical supervision  
until symptoms resolve.   
 
The relationship of an Adverse Event to the study device or procedure will be 
graded as follows:  
 
None  
The Adverse Event is not associated with the study device use.  
Remote  
The temporal association is such that the study device is not likely to have 
had an association with the observed Adverse Event.  
Possible  
This causal relationship is assigned when the Adverse Event:  
a) Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from device use, but  
b) Could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical  state or other modes 
of therapy administered to the subject.  
Probable  
This causal relationship is assigned when the Adverse Event:  
a) Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from device use;  
b) Abates upon discontinuation of the treatment;  
c) Cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_126026]’s clinical state.  
Definite  
This causal relationship is assigned when the Adverse Event:

 a) Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from device use;  
b) Abates upon discontinuation of the tre atment; and  
c) Is confirmed by [CONTACT_126027].  
 
*For purposes of reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events, “None” and “Remote” 
will be considered as having no association with the device or treatment procedure.  
 4.17.[ADDRESS_141601] (IRB), FDA, and Litecure Inc as required.  
 
If the Investigator s are notified by [CONTACT_126028], the 
Investigator s must notify his/her own IRB/EC as required.  
 4.17.[ADDRESS_141602]’s withdrawal from the study must be 
reported immediately by [CONTACT_126029] . 
  
The Investigator may be asked to provide detailed follow -up information.  The 
Investigator will determine the reportability of the event on a case -by-case basis, 
and will report to the appropriate regulatory authorities evaluating the study device 
as neces sary.   
4.[ADDRESS_141603]’s Safety  
The Investigator will be responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects who enter 
this study and for alerting Litecure Inc of any study -related  event that seems unusual and/or 
unanticipated for his/her si te.  
 
The Investigator will be responsible for the appropriate medical care of the subjects 
during the study in connection with protocol procedures for his/her site.  
 
The Investigator will remain responsible for providing any appropriate health care 
option s after a subject’s completion or discontinuation from the study due to adverse events.  
 
  
                           Page [ADDRESS_141604]’s participation in the clinical investigation.   
 
Possible reasons for withdrawal or removal from the study may include:  
 
1. The subject voluntarily withdraws consent.  
2. The subject was not eligible based on the study inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.  
3. The subject develops an Adverse Event that would not allow continuation in 
the study.  
4. The subject has an Adverse Event which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_125993] l from the study. Litecure Inc must be notified within 
two business days.  
5. A decision is made by [CONTACT_3184]/or Investigator that the subject should 
be withdrawn from the study.  
6. Subject death  
7. Positive pregnancy test during the eligibility procedures  
 
Treatment will end for participants who experience temporary pain or discomfort 
during a treatment session. A research assistant or the study doctor will follow -up 
within a [ADDRESS_141605] withdraws or is removed from the study, t he following will be 
performed, if feasible , at the study termination (exit) visit : 
 
 Concomitant medications form  
 ADVERSE EVENTS FORM  
 ASQ (self -rated)  
 SDQ (self -rated)  
 NEURO -QoL (self -rated)  
 SFI (self -rated)  
 SAFTEE (self -rated)  
 PANAS (self -rated)  
 Cognitive  tests 
 
For all subjects who withdraw from the study prematurely, the date, and reason for 
withdrawal will be documented.

three documen ted phone calls should be made. T he site’s unsuccessful attempts to 
contact [CONTACT_126030]’s failure to contact [CONTACT_126031].  The subject will be considered Lost to 
Follow -up.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_141607] may include but are not limited to the following:  
The TPBM -1000  emits light with a longer wavelength than the human eye can see. 
The TPBM -1000  output is less than the maximum permissibl e exposure (MPE).  
The staff will be provided training on basic safety procedures relative to the use of 
the device. The staff administering the TLT will be careful not to operate the 
TPBM -[ADDRESS_141608]’s skin. Both  the 
subject receiving the TLT  and the study clinician present in the TLT delivery room  
will wear protective eyewear in the form of goggles or eye pads.   The goggles 
provided with the TPBM -[ADDRESS_141609]’s eye.  Since they are reusable they should not be shared between subjects.  
The eye pads are disposable and should be discarded after use.  The eye pads use an 
adhesive to adhere to the subject’ s eyelids so there is potential for an allergic 
reaction.  
 
Failure of the TPBM -1000 , resulting in the cessation of investigative therapy can 
cause:  
1. No adverse event to our knowledge  
2. Unforeseeable adverse events  
 
Delivery of the infrared energy to an inappr opriate site, such as directly over the 
open eye, is not recommended and could pose a risk to the subject.  
 
Application of the TPBM -1000 may result in mild thermal sensation of 
warmth  during the use.  The temperature of the skin is well below the level for 
thermal damage.  
 
Based on human clinical trial experience to date, each adverse event listed 
below has been reported with TLT : 
1. Application Site Erythema  
2. Application Site Pain  
3. Applica tion Site Discomfort  
4. Application Site Warmth  
5. Application Site Reaction  
6. Headache

.    
  
Additional potential side effects of TLT, documented at MGH in prior trials, 
include:  
 
- Seeing vivid colors, having abnormal taste  
- Feeling “out -of-body” experiences  
- Insomnia, restless sleep, erratic sleep, early morning awakenings  
- Vivid dreams  
- Irritability  
- Word finding difficulties  
- Abdominal bloating  
 
Other potential risks are described below:  
 
Risk of Worsening of lingering Depression  of Anxiety and  Manic Switch :   
We will min imize this risk by [CONTACT_126032].  We will also 
discontinue any subject who develops active suicidal ideation during the course of 
the study ; we will then  arrange for appropriate levels of care and standard 
antidepressant treatment ( see 4 .8.4 Termination ).  Manic switches are possible 
adverse events and will be closely monitored during treatment as well.  Subjects 
who develop mania or hypomania will be discontinued and provided appropriate 
level of care.  
 
Answering detailed questionnaires  may create a mild degree of inconvenience 
for the subjects.  
 
Length of testing for cognitive circuitry : 
The total length of this task takes a total of 45-[ADDRESS_141610] s beyond 
the ~45-[ADDRESS_141611] s with TLT for a total 
study duration of 5 weeks.  
5.2  Specific Primary Aim 
To assess the change in cerebral blood flow induced by [CONTACT_125999] -Infrared Light Therapy in healthy subjects  
 
Hypothesis 1: We anticipate that p-TLT will trigger a significantly greater increase in 
CBF as compared to c -TLT, and c -TLT will trigger a significantly greater effect than 
sham (s -TLT). We expect that we will be also able to  estimate the effect size  of each 
type of TLT in terms of increase of CBF .  
5.[ADDRESS_141612] deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum for continuous parameters, frequencies and percentages for 
categorical parameters.  
5.5  Efficacy Analyses for Primary Aims  
 
For the primary analysis,  delta CBF (measured with DCS -spectroscopy pre - and post - 
TLT) will be compared in all ten subject s by [CONTACT_54959] t -test. The primary comparisons 
will include: a) delta CBF for p -TLT and delta CBF for c -TLT subject s (n=[ADDRESS_141613] comparison ) and b) delta CBF for c -TLT and delta CBF for s -TLT (n=[ADDRESS_141614] comparison ).

Confidential  Page 9 of 81 General Statistical Methods and Types of Analyses  
Hypotheses and Sample Size : 
The primary endpoints will be tested in a hierarchical fixed sequence in the following order.  
The statistical hypotheses for the primary endpoint of change from baseline corneal fluorescein 
staining (NEI scale) total score at Day 29 are as follows:  
 H01: The difference, between study eyes treated with CyclASol and study eyes treated with vehicle, in the mean change from baseline corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score at Day 29 = 0.  
 H
A1:  The difference, between study eyes treated with CyclASol and study eyes treated 
with vehicle, in the mean change from baseline corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score at Day 29 ≠ 0, with superiority claimed if the difference is less than 0 (CyclASol minus vehicle).  
The statistical hypotheses for the primary endpoint of the change from baseline total OSDI score 
at Day 29 are as follows:  
 H
02:  The difference, between subjects treated with CyclASol and subjects treated with vehicle, in the mean change from baseline total OSDI score at Day 29 = 0.  
 H
A2:  The difference, between subjects treated with CyclASol and subjects treated with vehicle, in the mean change from baseline total OSDI score at Day 29 ≠ 0, with superiority claimed if the difference is less than 0 (CyclASo l minus vehicle)  
One-hundred forty -two (142) intent to treat ( ITT) subjects (study eyes) per treatment group 
yields 90% power to reject H
01 in favor of H A1 and conclude superiority of CyclASol over 
vehicle in the mean change from baseline corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score at Day 29 assuming a true difference (CyclASol minus vehicle) of -0.85, a common standard 
deviation of 2.2, and a two- sided alpha = 0.05. Additionally, 142 ITT subjects per treatment 
group yields 82% power to reject H
02 in favor of H A2 and conclude superiority of CyclASol over 
vehicle in the mean change from baseline total OSDI score at Day 29 assuming a true difference (CyclASol minus vehicle) of -  5.0, a common standard deviation of 14.5, and a two- sided alpha 
= 0.05. A ccounting for subject discontinuations , 316 total subjects will be enrolled assuming a 
dropout rate of 10%.  
Hierarchical f ixed sequence testing will be employed to maintain the type I error rate. The 
primary analyses will first test the difference in the mean change from baseline corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score between treatments at Day 29. If the test of the 
difference is statistically significant at the two -sided alpha = 0.05 level in favor of CyclASol , 
then the study will be conside red a success; CyclASol will be declared to be superior to vehicle 
in the mean change from baseline corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score at Day 29; and the difference in the mean change from baseline total OSDI score between treatments at D ay

Confidential  Page 10 of 81 29 will be tested at the two -sided alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_78146] of the difference in the mean change from baseline 
corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score at Day [ADDRESS_78147] of the difference in the mean change from baseline total OSDI score at Day 29 is also statistically significant in favor of CyclASol, then CyclASol will be declared to be superior to vehicle in both the mean change from baseline corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score and the mean change from baseline total OSDI score at Day 29.  
Primary Efficacy Analyses : 
The primary comparisons in this study will be between CyclASol versus vehicle at Day 29. The primary efficacy endpoints (e.g. change from baseline in corneal fluorescein staining [total NEI] and OSDI) will be analyzed separately using an ANCOVA model with terms for baseline value, treatment, and the interaction of treatment by [CONTACT_72062] (the interaction term will be maintained in the mo del only if the p- value for the term is <0.10 ). 
Least squares mean for each treatment group and for  the difference between treatment groups 
will be presented from the model together with two -sided p-values and 95% confidence intervals. 
In the event that the interaction of treatment by [CONTACT_72063], estimate and contrast statements will be used to determine the treatment group means and differences at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile of the baseline score over treatment groups. 
Two-sample  t-tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests and mixed -effect repeated measures analysis 
comparing treatment groups will be performed  as sensitivity analyses.    
The primary analysis will use the Full Analysis Set (FAS) with available data per subject. 
Additional robustness analyses will include repeating the primary analysis on the per protocol set (PPS); the FAS imputing missing data using last observation carried forward (LOCF); the FAS imputing missing data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation methodology under different assumptions of missingness (at random and not at random); and an analysis of trimmed means (Permutt et al., 2017).

Safety Variables  
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies and percentages 
of subjects with treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious TEAEs, and TEAEs 
causing premature discontinuation will be provided by [CONTACT_1570]. An AE is treatment 
emergent if it occurs or worsens after the first dose of study treatment. Furthermore, frequencies 
will be given of subjects with TEAEs by [CONTACT_72064], by [CONTACT_72065], by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and maximal severity, by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and strongest relationship, and by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, maximal severity, and stron gest relationship.  Separate summaries will be performed  for ocular and non-
ocular AEs. Other safety endpoints including visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, dilated fundoscopy, and intraocular pressure will be summarized by [CONTACT_72066]. Changes or shifts from baseline will also be summarized where appropriate. For assessments performed by [CONTACT_72067], study eye and fellow  eye will be summarized  separately. In 
addition, shifts from baseline to worst on- treatment value for ocular safety assessments will be 
summarized .

1.1 Dry Eye Disease (DED) 
Dry Eye Disease (DED) is defined by [CONTACT_72068] (DEWS) as a  
multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the tear 
film, and ac companied by [CONTACT_72069], in which tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, 
ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnor malities play etiological roles  
(DEWS II Definition and Classification 2017).  As many as 5 - 35% of patients vis iting 
ophthalmic clinics report dry eye symptoms, making it one of the most common conditions seen by [CONTACT_72070] ( McCarty CA, et al. 1998; Lin PY, et al. 2003).  Estimates range from 
20 million people in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) being affected wit h mild to moderate dry eye, to a 
high of as many as one out of every five Americans. Prevalence is greater in females and the 
elderly. Schaumberg et al . reported prevalence rates ranging from 3.9% in men aged 50–54 years 
to 7.7% in those 80 years or older, while an increased rate from 5.7% in women younger than 50 
years to 9.8% in women >75 years was observed (Schaumberg DA, et al . 2003). Pre valence is 
affected by [CONTACT_72071].  Dry eye can 
be related to external factors, such as the low humidity of air conditioned offices, winter heating, a dusty or windy outdoor environment, prolonged computer use, or wearing contact [CONTACT_13276], as well as to internal factors, such as hormonal imbalance, autoimmune diseas e, the presence of 
many widely prescribed systemic medications, anatomical changes or trauma, and aging. Symptoms result in mildly decreased quality of life at a minimum, and with increasing severity, loss of function and productivity, pain, light sensitivity, and the misery that accompanies significantly impaired vision and decreased quality of life. With the aging population in the 
[LOCATION_002] and other countries of the developed world, and with increasing computer use, DED is expected to continue to become more prevalent and finding a treatment is becoming more important (Schaumberg  DA,  et al. 2009).  
1.[ADDRESS_78157] Rational 
Cyclosporine A  (CsA), a potent and selective immunosuppressive drug, acts as a regulator of T -
cells via inhibition of calcineurin. Due to  this mode of action it has been widely studied as 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_72049] T -cell mediated disease of the ocular surface such as DED. In the US, Cs A 
eye drops formulated as an emulsion are approved and marketed as Restasis  0.05%  for this 
indication  since 2002. In Europe - Ikervis®, a 0.1% Cs A emulsion formulation, received a  
marketing authori zation by [CONTACT_72072] 2015. 
CyclASol is a clear ophthalmic solution of Cs A developed with the goal of avoiding the  use of 
oils, surfactants and preservatives. Potential benefits from the CyclASol formulation include improved tolerability and efficacy, early onset of efficacy and decreased visual disturbances associated with oily eye drops, emulsions or ointments. More over, the multiple dose containers 
allow for a convenient handling. 
For the solubilization of CsA in CyclASol the semifluorinated alkane (SFA) 
 F4H5  
is used as the 
vehicle.  F4H5 is

refractory index as water. F4H5’s physical properties make it an optimal vehicle for topi[INVESTIGATOR_72050]. As a result of its high vapor pressure ( Krafft MP 2009) , F4H5 dissipates quickly from 
the ocular surface and consequently does not interact physically with the tear film, as shown in rabbits, where F4H5 had no effect on tear film break -up time ( TFBUT ). Due to the low surface 
tensio n of F4H5, CyclASol eye drops are of small size,  
 potentially reducing pre -corneal clearance. Importantly, the low surface tension of 
the CyclASol formulation facilitates dissemination of the applied eye drop on th e conjunctiva. 
These dissemination and spreading properties are further thought to improve the local bioavailability.  
 
1.3 Trial Rational 
The preclinical profile of CyclASol and of F4H5, the new excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], has been well characterized. 
The chronic toxicity studies  with F4H5 in rats (oral route) and rabbits (ocular route) estimated 
NOAELs of 1000 mg/kg/day and 342 mg/kg/day, respectively. These values were [ADDRESS_78158] that the CyclASol formulation may deliver Cs A more 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_72051] . In a murine dry eye model  CsA in F4H5 and Restasis 
were equally effective in reducing corneal staining  and, F4H5/ CsA was associated with a more 
rapid therapeutic response and the only treatment that maintained conjunctival goblet cells  
(Gehlsen 2015).  
 After successful completion of a Phase 1 safety, tolerability and PK study, a second, multicenter, 
randomized, double -masked (with an open label comparator  - Restasis ) phase 2 study 
investigating the efficacy and safety of CyclASol Ophthalmic Solution (0.05% and 0.1%) in 
comparison to vehicle in patients with DED was conducted. This was an exploratory P hase 2 
study without formal power calculations and no adjustments for multiple comparisons. In this 
study b oth CyclASol groups showed consistent improvements in corneal and conjunctival 
staining compared to the vehicle over the 4 -month treatment period. These improvements were 
already visible after 2 weeks of treatment (Visit 2) and became statistically significant over 
Restasis at Visit 3 (1 month), which indicate s an earlier onset of effect compared to Restasis.  The 
most pronounced effect was seen in the central and inferior area of the cornea, which is particularly important from a patient perspective as it positively influences proper visual function in dry eye patients.    All treatment groups demonstrated improvement in symptoms. In the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSD I), the vision- related subscale (questions 6 through 9), particularly the question 
regarding impact on reading, demonstrated a numerically more pronounced effect in CyclASol groups when compared to vehicle.  The CyclASol effect became statistically significant over vehicle (total corneal staining p<0.1, central corneal staining p<0.001, conjunctival staining p <0.01) when using a model -based 

CyclASol® 0.1% Ophthalmic Solution  Novaliq GmbH  
Clinical Trial Protocol: CYS- 003 / 17- 110-[ADDRESS_78159] for OSDI as  a symptom 
parameter  (p <0.01). 
 
 
 
 
Moreover, both CyclASol concentrations showed excellent safety, tolerability, and comfort 
profiles.  Due to the comparable safety profile but slightly better efficacy of CyclASol 0.1% over 
CyclASol 0.05%, the higher concentration (CyclASol 0.1%) wa s chosen for the present study.  
 Based on these encouraging results the present P hase 2b/[ADDRESS_78160]  (IP) CyclASol 0.1% Ophthalmic Solution contains Cs A as active 
ingredient and its vehicle, which consists of F4H5. Cs A is a potent and selective 
immunosuppressive drug, used routinely for decades as an oral immun omodulator in various 
indications. Cs A containing eye drops have been proven safe over the last [ADDRESS_78161] frequently reported treatment- emergent 
adverse event TEAE was headache ([ADDRESS_78162] [5.6%] after CyclASol and 3 subjects [16.7%] after placebo) and in the Phase [ADDRESS_78163] frequently reported ocular TEAE (11 subjects [5.3%]) was visual acuity (VA) reduced. 
All TEAEs were of mild to moderate intensity. In Phase [ADDRESS_78164] discontinued the study due 
to AEs and in Phase 2 three (3) subjects (1.4%) withdrew from study treatment due to an ocular TEAE, two of which were considered at least possibly related to study drug. No deaths were observed in either  study . Three (3) treatment -emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) were 
reported during the Phase 2 study. All SAEs were non -ocular, were considered not -related to 
study treatment, and had recovered by [CONTACT_2054]. 
Adverse effects result ing from  systemic absorption of CsA appear unlikely, because no systemic 
exposure of CsA could be detected after application of 1 or 2 drops of CyclASol twice daily in  
neither of the two clinical CyclASol trials , since all plasma concentrations were below the 
quantification  limit (BLQ) (i.e. <0.100 ng/mL).  
Adverse effects due to systemic absorption of F4H5 appear very unlikely, as this excipi[INVESTIGATOR_72052].  In the two 

CyclASol® 0.1% Ophthalmic Solution  Novaliq GmbH  
Clinical Trial Protocol: CYS -003 / 17- 110-[ADDRESS_78165] ophthalmological safety assessments will be performed during the entire treatment  period. The efficacy demonstrated to date supports that  
CyclASol improve s signs and symptoms of  DED. I n particular  corneal and conjunctival staining 
signs were reduced and symptoms related to visual function showed improve ment . CyclASol  
therefore provides a favorable risk -benefit treatment profile to patients with DED and the CYS -
003 study plans to further assess this positive profile.  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety , and tolerability of Cy clASol in 
comparison to  the vehicle for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of (DED).  
3 CLINICAL HYPOTHESES  
The clinical hypotheses for this study are that CyclASol is superior to vehicle in improving  the 
primary sign and symptom endpoints of DED, as fol lows:  
• Corneal fluorescein staining (NEI Scale) total score at day 29 is  more reduced compared 
to baseline in patients receiving  CyclASol than  in patients  receiving vehicle ; 
• OSDI total score at day 29 is more reduced compared to baseline in patients receiving  
CyclASol than in patients receiving vehicle.  
 
4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Overall Study Design 
This is a P hase 2b/3 m ulticenter , randomized, double -masked, and vehicle- controlled clinical 
study  to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of  CyclASol 0.1% Op hthalmic  Solution in 
subjects with DED. Approximately [ADDRESS_78166] ory of dry eye in both eyes  and meet ing all other study 
eligibility  criteria will be randomized at approximately  10 sites in the US to receive treatment 
with CyclASol or vehicle in a 1:1 ratio ( approx. 158 subjects per treatment arm). This study is 
composed of two distinct parts: a 14- day run -in period and an 85- day treatment period.  During 
the run- in period, subjects will dose Systane Balance bilaterally BID  for approximately two 
weeks . Eligible patients will thereafter dose the study treatment (CyclASol or vehicle) bilaterally 
BID for approximately 3 month. A chart illustrating the study’s structure  is below.

Confidential  Page 23 of 81 4.4 Justification of Study Design  
Based on CYS -002 results Novaliq plans a confirmatory study in DED patients having  
 (NEI grading) at baseline. This popula tion responded best in signs and 
symptoms.  
The study will be a randomized, double-masked, vehicle controlled study to demonstrate efficacy 
and safety of CyclASol after 1-month treatment duration. Vehicle controlled studies are currently the standard for DED studies. Randomization and double masking are state of the art measures to reduce bias. Fast onset of efficacy is important for patients and their compliance to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
thus early demonstration of efficacy (e.g. at 1 month) is desired and highly clini cally relevant. 
Moreover, DED is a fluctuating condition with phase -like recurring dry eye complaints that may 
be linked to seasonal and / or environmental changes (van Setten, et al. 2016), thus a primary 
endpoint assessment at a shorter  treatment duration is considered clinically relevant and has a 
greater potential to capture the true drug effect.  
Total corneal fluorescein staining (NEI grading) and total OSDI have been selected as the primary sign endpoint and primary symptom endpoint, respectively. The two primary endpoints 
will be tested in a sequential order with total corneal fluorescein staining being tested first.  Both 
primary endpoints are well accepted by [CONTACT_72073] . The hierarchical testing has 
been selected t o protect the α – error. Corneal staining is being tested first as the CYS -[ADDRESS_78168] ronger. 
4.5 Justification for Dose 
The dose for this trial ha s been selected based on the previous CYS -002 study, which 
investigated two concentrations of CyclASol (0.05% and 0.1%). Neither the statistical analysis on the total population nor the modelling & simulation analysis identified a clear dose -response 
for sign or symptoms between the two CyclASol groups.  H owever, there were some trends 
favoring C yclASol 0.1% over CyclASol 0.05% in symptoms in all subjects and in the target 
population for the current  study (patients having total corneal staining of ≥10 at baseline). 
Moreover, the CsA amount applied with  the CyclASol 0.1% is still lower than that of  Restasis 
  
 Novaliq intends to pursue the 
concentration of CyclASol 0.1% for the current  pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397] C YS-003.

The study may be stopped at any time by [CONTACT_093], the sponsor, and/or  
with appropriate notification. 
The whole trial may be discontinued prematurely in the event of any of new 
information leading to unfavorable risk-benefit judgment of the IP, e.g. due to: 
• Occurrence of significant previously unknown adverse reactions or unexpectedly 
high intensity or incidence of known adverse reactions, or 
• Other unfavorable safety findings. 
• Sponsor’s deci sion that continuation of the trial is unjustifiable for medical or 
ethical reasons.  
• Poor enrollment of subjects making completion of the trial within an acceptable time frame unlikely.  
• Discontinuation of development of the sponsor’s IP. 
• Health Authorities  and IECs/  IRBs will be informed about the discontinuation of 
the trial in accordance with applicable regulations.  
The whole trial may be terminated or suspended upon request of Health Authorities.

8.9 Monitoring and Quality Assurance 
During the course of the study a monitor, or designee, will make routine site visits to 
review protocol compliance, assess study drug /device accountability , and ensure the 
study is being conducted according to the pertinent regulatory requirements.  The review of the subjects’ medical records will be performed in a manner that  adequately 
maintains  subject confidentiality.  Further details of the study monitor ing will be 
outlined in a monitoring plan.  
Regulatory authorities of domestic and foreign agencies, sponsor quality assurance 
and or its designees may carry out on- site inspections and/or audits which may 
include source data checks.  Therefore , direct access to the original source data will 
be required for inspections and/or audits.  All inspections and audits will be carried out giving consideration to data protection as well as subject confidentiality to the extent that local, state, and federal laws appl y.

9.1 Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated 
with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not the event is considered drug -related. 
An AE  can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease occurring after the subject started dosing with the study drug or the run -in medication , without any judgment about causality. 
If there is a worsening of a medical condition that was present prior to the administration of the study drug, this should also be considered a new AE  and 
reported. Any medical condition present prior to the administration of the study drug that remains unchanged or improved should not be recorded as an AE at subsequent 
visits. 
Worsening of DED will be considered an AE  only if the dry eye status of the subject 
exceeds their previous experiences with the condition. This will be determined by [CONTACT_24484].  
A clinically significant visual acuity decrease  
 from baseline (Visit 0) will be considered an AE . 
Study drug includes the investigational drug under evaluation and any comparator 
drug, vehicle, or  any other medications required by [CONTACT_72077].  
Documentation regarding the AE  should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end 
date, severity, relationship to study drug, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of  
any sign or symptom observed by [CONTACT_72078].  
9.1.1 Severity  
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of 
intensity of an AE  as determined by [CONTACT_72079] /her by 
[CONTACT_102]/subject.  The assessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship to investigational product  or seriousness of the event and s hould 
be evaluated according to the following scale:  
• Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does 
not interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate :  Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and 
may interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Severe:  Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration 
of therapy , and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  

CyclASol® 0.1% Ophthalmic Solution  Novaliq GmbH  
Clinical Trial Protocol: CYS -003 / 17- 110-[ADDRESS_78189] should be 
determined by [CONTACT_32981]:  
• Suspected :  A reasonable possibility exists that the investigational product 
caused the AE . 
• Not Suspected: A reasonable possibility does not exist that the 
investigational product caused the AE . 
 
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE  for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the investigational product caused the AE .  “Reasonable 
possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE .  Types of evidence that 
would suggest a causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE  include :  a single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and 
known to be strongly associated with IP exposure ( e.g., angioedema, 
hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome); one or more occurrences of 
an event that is not commonly associated with IP exposure, but is 
otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the IP (e.g., tendon 
rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the IP-treatment group than in a concurrent or 
historical control group.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_78190] been listed in the investigator’s brochure . Therefore , 
the following definition will be used:  
• Unexpected : An AE  that is not listed in the investigator’s brochure  (IB) in 
the Adverse Reaction Section at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
• Expected : An AE  that is listed in the investigator’s brochure (IB) in the 
Adverse Reaction Section at the specificity and severity that has been observed.  
• Not Appl icable : Any AE  that is unrelated to the study drug.  
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE , but the 
final classification is subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination.

Confidential  Page 42 of 81 9.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE  is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death;  
• A life -threatening AE ; 
o Note:  An AE  is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it s occurrence places the patient or subject at 
immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
o Note:  T he term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission 
(even if less than 24 hours).  For chronic or long -term inpatients, inpatient 
admission includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care 
inpatient unit.  Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72056]:  emergency room 
visits; o utpatient/ same- day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay 
units; rehabilitation facilities; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 units. 
o Note:  T he term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any 
extension of an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72057].  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
o Note:  A  serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat 
would be interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s 
eyes (e.g.,  hemorrhage, retina l detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to 
the optic nerve). 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

9.4 Procedures for Unmasking (if applicable) 
All subjects, investigators, and study personnel involved with the conduct of the study 
will be masked with regard to treatment assignments. When medically necessary, the investigator may need to determine what treatment arm has been assigned to a subject. When possible (i.e., in non- emergent situations),  and/or the study 
sponsor should be notified before unmasking study drug.  and/or the study sponsor must be informed immediately about any unmasking event. 
If an investigator identifies a medical need for unmasking the treatment assignment of 
a subject, he/she should contact  [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the medical monitor prior to unmasking 
the identity of the IP , if possible.  will ask the site to complete and send them the 
Unmasking Request Form.  will notify Novaliq and jointly will determine if the 
unmasking request should be granted. They may consult the medical monitor as needed. The result of the request will be documented on the Unmasking Request Form. If approval is granted to unmask a subject, written permission via the Unmasking Request  Form will be provided to the investigator. The investigator  will 
unmask the subject using IWRS. The investigator will complete the Unmasking 
Memo form and include it in the subject’s study file and provide a copy for the Trial Master File ( TMF ). For each unmasked request, the reason, date, signature, and name 
[CONTACT_72088], must be noted in the subject’s study file.  
Unmasked subjects will be discontinued from the study.

Report Form must be completed and faxed to  within  24 hours of the site’s 
awareness of the new information. The original SAE form is not to be altered. The 
report should describe whether the event has resolved or  continues and how the event 
was treated.

10.1 Analysis Populations 
The following analysis population will be considered:  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS)  – The FAS includes all randomized subjects  who received at 
least one dose of investigation product . The primary analysis will be performed on the 
FAS. Subjects in the FAS will be analyzed as randomized.  
 
• Per Protocol Set (PPS)  – The PPS includes subjects in the FAS who do not have 
significant protocol deviations and who complete the study. Protocol deviations will 
be assessed prior to database lock an d unmasking. The PPS will be analyzed using 
observed data only for efficacy variables. Subjects in the PPS will be analyzed as treated.  
 
• Safety Set (SAF) – The SAF includes all randomized subjects who have received at 
least one dose of the investigational product. The SAF will be analyzed for all safety assessments. Subjects in the SAF will be analyzed as treated.  
 
The statistical analysis of safety data will be performed for the SAF.  The analysis of baseline 
and efficacy data will be performed for the FAS.  The primary efficacy analyses will also be performed on the PPS as sensitivity analyses.  
 
10.2 Statistical Hypotheses  
The primary endpoints will be tested in a hierarchical fixed sequence  in the following order .  
The statistical hypotheses for the primary  endpoint of change from baseline corneal 
fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score at Day 29 are as follows:  
 H01: The difference, between study eyes treated with CyclASol and study eyes treated 
with vehicle, in the mean change from baseline corneal fl uorescein staining (NEI scale) 
total score at Day 29 = 0.  
 HA1:  The difference, between study eyes treated with CyclASol and study eyes treated 
with vehicle, in the mean change from baseline corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score at Day 29 ≠ 0, with superiority claimed if the difference is less than 0 
(CyclASol minus vehicle).  
The statistical hypotheses for the primary endpoint of the change from baseline total OSDI score at Day 29 are as follows:  
 H
02:  The difference, between subjects treated with CyclASol and subjects treated with 
vehicle, in the mean change from baseline total OSDI score at Day 29 = 0.

superiority claimed if the difference is less than 0 (CyclASol minus vehicle).  
Hierarchical fixed sequence testing will be employed to maintain the type I error rate. The 
primary analyses will first test the difference in the mean change from baseline corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score between treatments at Day 29. If the test of the 
difference is statistically significant at the two -sided alpha = 0.05 level in favor of CyclASol, 
then the study will be consider ed a success; CyclASol will be declared to be superior to 
vehicle in the mean change from baseline corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score at Day 29; and the difference in the mean change from baseline total OSDI score between treatments at Day 29 will be tested at the two -sided alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_78194] of the difference in the mean change from baseline corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score at Day [ADDRESS_78195] of the difference in the mean change from baseline total OSDI score at Day 29 is also statistically significant in favor of CyclASol, then CyclASol  will be declared to be superior to vehicle in both the mean change from baseline corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score and the mean change from baseline total OSDI score at Day 29.  
10.3 Sample Size  
One-hundred forty -two (142) ITT subjects (study eyes) per treatment group yields 90% 
power to reject H 01 in favor of H A1 and conclude superiority of CyclASol over vehicle in the 
mean change from baseline corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score at Day 29 assuming a true difference (CyclASol minus vehicle) of - 0.85, a common standard deviation 
of 2.2, and a two- sided alpha = 0.05.  Additionally, 142 ITT subjects per treatment group 
yields 82% power to reject H
02 in favor of H A2 and conclude superiority of CyclASol over 
vehicle in the mean change from baseline total OSDI score at Day 29 assuming a true difference (CyclASol minus vehicle) of -5.0, a common standard deviation of 14.5, and a 
two-sided alpha = 0.05.  Accounting for subject discontinuations, 316 total subjects will be 
enrolled . 
For justification of clinical relevance of selected differences see Section 6.1.4.  
10.4 Statistical Analysis  
10.4.1 General Considerations 
The quantitative variables will be summarized using number of subjects (n), mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. The qualitative variables will be summarized using counts and percentages.  
All summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  Summaries will be provided 
for demographics, baseline medical history, concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and subject disposition.

Confidential  Page 48 of 81 10.4.5 Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The primary comparisons in this study will be between CyclASol versus vehicle 
at Day 29. The primary efficacy endpoints (e.g. change from baseline in corneal fluorescein staining [total NEI] and OSDI) will be analyzed separately using an ANCOVA model with terms for baseline value, treatment, and the interaction of treatment by [CONTACT_72062] (the interaction term will be maintained in the model only if the p-value for the term is <0.10). 
Least squares mean for each treatment  group and for the difference between 
treatment groups will be presented from the model together with two -sided p-
values and 95% confidence intervals. In the event that the interaction of treatment 
by [CONTACT_72063], estimate and contrast statements will be used to determine the treatment group means and differences at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile of the baseline score over treatment groups. 
Two-sample t -tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests comparing treatment groups will 
be performed as sensitivity analyses.  A mixed -effect repeated measures model 
will also be used as an additional sensitivity analysis of mean scores and mean 
changes from baseline at each visit.  This model will include treatment, visit, and the interaction between treatme nt and visit as fixed effects, and subject as a 
random effect.  An unstructured covariance matrix will initially be used to model the covariance among repeated measures; however, if the model fails to converge using this covariance structure, either hetero geneous TOEPLITZ, homogeneous 
TOEPLITZ, or CS (compound symmetry) will be implemented according to the Akaike information criterion with a correction for finite sample sizes (AICc).  As an additional sensitivity analysis, a mixed -effect repeated measures m odel will be 
used with the covariance matrix selected from unstructured, heterogeneous TOEPLITZ, homogeneous TOEPLITZ and CS according to AICc.

Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies 
and percentages of subjects with TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing 
premature discontinuation will be provided by [CONTACT_1570]. An AE is

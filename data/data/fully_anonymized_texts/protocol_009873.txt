Page 4 of 19Version Date: 06/18/[ZIP_CODE]. Objectives
Primary Objective
The primary objective of this study is to:
Assess the safety and tolerability of Isoxsuprine (ISX) in combination with 
high dose corticosteroids in subjects experiencing acute relapses due to 
multiple sclerosis.
The safety analysis population will include all randomized subjects who 
receive at least one dose of study drug.  Safety endpoints will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_1570] (ISX or placebo) from the time of the first does and 
include all available safety data.  No formal statistical testing will be done.
All adverse event data will be listed and will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490].  Quantitative safety variables (vital signs) will be summarized at each 
visit by [CONTACT_775193].
Secondary Objective
The secondary objective of this study is to:
Evaluate the potential efficacy of Isoxuprine as add-on treatment for 
improving neurological deficits in walking ability, visual acuity, and other 
associated symptoms of MS, including fatigue and cognitive dysfunction in 
this MS population experiencing a relapse.
The efficacy analyses will include all randomized and dosed subjects who 
provide Week [ADDRESS_1064794] relevant to the relapse 
associated disability (e.g. pyramidal, visual, cerebellar).  Also walking speed 
and z-score from the Multiple Sclerosis Functional composite score (MSFC) 
from Baseline to Week 12 in the ISX group compared to the placebo group.
2. Background
Overview
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS) 
characterized by [CONTACT_775194], demyelination, axonal injury and brain 
atrophy secondary to neurodegenerative changes. The prevalence of MS in the US is 
estimated to be 1,000,000 in the US with approximately 2,000 new cases diagnosed 
annually. MS occurs more often in women than men (2:1 ratio) with a mean age of 
onset in the US of approximately [ADDRESS_1064795] common pattern of MS is 
termed relapsing MS (RMS) where patients experience acute exacerbations or 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_775182]. Relapses of MS can be associated with transient or permanent disability. 
For this reason, it is common to treat significant relapse symptoms with short pulses 
of high dose corticosteroids. Severe relapses involving vision loss, impaired 
ambulation or other disabling symptoms may recover more quickly with high dose 
corticosteroids given daily for 3 to 5 days. Evidence from preclinical stroke models

and tolerability of isoxsuprine HCL combined with high dose steroid treatment of 
multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse
Page 5 of 19Version Date: 06/18/2020and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis suggest that isoxsuprine hydrochloride 
may have neuroprotective activity and reduce disability in animal models. 
Isoxsuprine belongs to the group beta-agonists that cause vasodilation and has been 
used to treat problems resulting from poor blood circulation and, in certain women, to 
stop premature labor. Given its potential neuroprotective effects in CNS injury 
models, we propose to test it as a safe, tolerable add on treatment for acute relapses in 
patients with relapsing forms of MS. 
3. Study Design
Description
This is a proof of concept, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, 
parallel group study of Isoxsuprine in MS subjects experiencing a typi[INVESTIGATOR_775183].
All subjects will have a documented diagnosis of relapsing MS or a clinically isolated 
syndrome by [CONTACT_775195].  The relapse will be of sufficient severity that their 
physician recommends treatment with a high dose corticosteroid pulse.  All subjects 
will have a physical examination and history with questions on drug sensitivities.  
Subjects experiencing the onset of objective neurological deficits consistent with 
relapse within [ADDRESS_1064796] 3 to 5 day pulse of high dose 
corticosteroids, will be randomized with equal probability to 1 of 2 treatment groups:  
placebo capsule or active Isoxsuprine (ISX).  
The Screening Visit will take place within 7 days of relapse onset and within 48 hours 
of initiating high dose steroids. Subjects may start corticosteroids anytime during this 
7 day window. During the screening period, subjects will be assessed with the 
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite 
(MSFC), and cognitive testing prior to treatment with ISX or placebo (1:1 ratio). 
Safety Assessments during screening will include a physical exam, 
electrocardiogram, vital signs, weight and a urine pregnancy test for females of child 
bearing potential.  At 7 (± 1) days following the completion of the 5-day ISX dosing, 
subjects will be re-assessed with the EDSS.
Subjects will be evaluated for treatment response using the EDSS and other standard 
measures described below at visits 1, 4 and 12 weeks.
Study drug will be administered as one (1) 10 mg capsule, 3 times daily for 5 days in 
conjunction with concomitant dosing with high dose corticosteroids. This can be any 
accepted regimen, including daily iv methylprednisolone 1000 mg/day or 600mg oral

12. Data Management/Confidentiality
Qualified Clinical Trial personnel will be the only ones that will carry out study 
procedures. MS Clinical Trial personnel will have access to study records. HIPPA 
Regulations will be strictly followed.
It is required that subjects be explicitly identified by a study number. This number is 
assigned at screening. A study number link is necessary in case of follow-up for 
accuracy and/or quality control. The link will be kept at least the duration of the 
study. 
All study data will be entered into a RedCAP data which maintained locally. Only the 
study id number is used in the database to identify study subjects. 
A subject identification log will be kept on-site, however, no copi[INVESTIGATOR_775186].
All records will be kept in a locked office at [ADDRESS_1064809] NE.  Once the study has 
been closed the data will be stored for up to 3 years per regulations

multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse
Page 13 of 19Version Date: 06/18/202014.Risks to Subjects
Along with its needed effects, isoxsuprine may cause some unwanted effects. Although 
not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.
Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur 
while taking isoxsuprine:
Rare
Chest pain
dizziness or faintness (more common for injection)
fast heartbeat (more common for injection)
shortness of breath
skin rash
Some side effects of isoxsuprine may occur that usually do not need medical attention. 
These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. 
Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or 
reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the 
following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about 
them:
Less Common
Nausea or vomiting (more common for injection)
Risks to patient confidentiality will be mitigated by [CONTACT_775200]. Part of this study is a standard of care treatment for MS 
relapse and only the addition of isoxsuprine or placebo is the subject of the research.
      All patients will be screened and excluded for pregnancy
      Careful examination and history will be taken to ascertain key inclusion and    
      exclusion criteria in order to minimize the probability and magnitude of risks.
15.Potential Benefits to Subjects
This is not an efficacy study.  The goal here is to study a reasonable number of MS 
patients in acute relapse who are receiving standard high dose steroid therapy. We 
will randomize [ADDRESS_1064810] is verified, a copy of the approved IRB consent is sent or given to the 
patient for their review.

and tolerability of isoxsuprine HCL combined with high dose steroid treatment of 
multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse
Page 14 of 19Version Date: 06/18/2020The coordinator will ask the patient to sign a release to obtain copi[INVESTIGATOR_775187]. The coordinator will review the medical record prior 
to scheduling a screening visit. This is done so that if there is anything in the 
medical records which will exclude the potential research patient, this will be 
found prior to a screening scheduled visit. This preliminary review of the patient 
allows them to be deemed eligible to screen for the study. 
Subjects must be consented before any study screening tests or assessments are 
performed. At the time of consent, the subject will be enrolled into the study. 
The coordinator and/or study staff will document all screened candidates initially 
considered for inclusion in this study. If a subject is excluded from the study, the 
reasons for exclusion will be documented in the subject’s source documents and 
on the study screening log.
17.Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects
Protections for Subjects
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or MS Clinical Trial personnel will approach the 
subject with specific details after they are referred to the clinic or are seen in the MS 
clinic. Only those study personnel will interact with the patient throughout the study.
All information is gathered and stored at [ADDRESS_1064811]. Hainline’s 
review, in case there are any safety issues that need to be addressed. 
From the beginning at the ICF process, all study activities are explained in terms the 
subject can understand and an opportunity is given for the subject to ask questions. 
This is continued throughout the study. At each visit a lot of time is given to the 
patient so that they understand the various procedures being done as a safety 
precaution. 
There is a lot of communication and the patient is always encouraged to ask questions 
either in clinic, at the research facility or via telephone. All of their questions will be 
answered with a level of compassion, as we understand this is for research.
18.Economic Burden to Subjects
Study Costs
This study will supply the study drug needed for treating the subject’s MS relapse 
while they participate, at no cost to the subject.  All of the required study 
procedures and activities that are above the standard of care will be covered by

blind was broken and provide the date, time, and reason for breaking the blind.
Dosing Procedures
The medication should be kept at room temperature and will be labeled according to all 
applicable national and local regulations.
The following treatments will be administered:
•Treatment A: Isoxsuprine HCL 1 Capsule 3 times daily for 5 consecutive days, 
OR
•Treatment B: Placebo [ADDRESS_1064813]’s caregiver at home.
Subject Unblinding
The identity of the treatment assigned to individual subjects can be revealed in an 
emergency only. A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when 
knowledge of the treatment is essential for the safety of the subject
Storage of Clinical Supplies
Isoxsuprine HCL and placebo will be maintained in a temperature controlled, secure 
locked area with restricted access at the study site pharmacy.
Drug Accountability
Subjects will be asked to return all empty study medication containers at study visit week 
1 (Visit 2).  They will be asked if all study medication was taken as directed.
Safety Assessments and Procedures
The following safety assessments will be evaluated (see section 10): AEs, physical 
examinations, ECGs, vitals, weight, urine pregnancy tests and Concomitant Medications.

They will have no connection to the study. On a quarterly basis, study progress and data 
will be submitted for review. Adverse events will be reported to the DSMB and IRB 
within [ADDRESS_1064814] of the study, such as suspension of the study or advise 
on any potential protocol revisions.
IND Waiver Justification
This study proposes to use isoxsuprine HCl (ISX) in standard 10 mg tablets in subjects 
experiencing an acute relapse of multiple sclerosis. The rationale comes from strong 
preclinical observations that ISX had significant and novel neuroprotective action in 
ischemic stroke using a cell-based high-throughput screening (PLOS ONE, 1 May 2014,  
Volume 9 (5) e9676.). Isoxsuprine was identified as a top neuroprotectant among 1,[ADDRESS_1064815] significant other health issues. We do not anticipate adverse reactions to 
concomitant use of ISX and steroids. While ISX tends to lower blood pressure modestly, 
steroids tend to increase, essentially in offsetting directions. Subjects will be randomized 
to ISX 10mg tid x 5 days or matching placebo. They will initiate the ISX within 48 hours 
of starting steroids.

year in the absence of clinically detectable MS relapses or attacks (Thompson et al., 2018). Pathologically, it is characterized  by [CONTACT_614425].  
Patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_614383], bowel and sexual dysfunction. 
 
Like MS, there is no cure for traumatic injury of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_614384], sensory, and motor functions in regions of the body that are distal to the damaged areas of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. In response to the complete lack of available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614385] -controlled lower extremity motor function, we recently 
conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]- phase clinical trial of epi[INVESTIGATOR_614386] (ES) in  
combination with task -specific training; ES consists of an imp lanted stimulator and electrode 
array placed over the dura mater on the dorsal aspect of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. ES with task -specific 
training resulted in unprecedented outcomes, such as restoration of standing and walking in humans previously diagnosed with complete paralysis of their lower extremities due to a traumatic  spi[INVESTIGATOR_108408] (SCI)  that occurred  several  years  prior (M. Gill et  al., 2020; M.  
L. Gill et al., 2018; Grahn et al., 2017). Likewise, other research teams have shown remarkable improvements  in spi[INVESTIGATOR_503439] -enabled  motor functions that are retained  
after study participation in individuals with incomplete paralysis (Wagner et al., 2018). Herein, we propose leveraging the knowledge and expertise gained during our previous, and active, clinical trials of ES in participants with paralysis to determine the translational potential of epi[INVESTIGATOR_614386] (ES) for improvement of motor function and  
spasticity in patients with myelopathy due to progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). The following are key  aspects  of the proposed work: 
 
• The proposed research is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_614387]  
(ES) in combination with task -specific training to improve lower limb function in 10  
participants  with Progressive  MS. 
• We will temporarily implant percutaneous ES leads through the skin overlying the  
lumbosacral enlargement  and remove the  leads following  the 4-week  study.  
• Participants will serve as their own control via a comparison of pre- and post- 
stimulation  outcomes  and outcome metrics  captured  during  ES and when  ES is off. 
• Safety will be continuously  evaluated  during  the 4-week  stimulation  and task specific 
training  period, and during  a post lead  removal neurologist visit.  
• The percutaneous leads are currently used clinically and are approved for patients  
with low back  pain;  use in participants  with MS will be possible  under  an FDA  IDE.  
 
1.1 Background 
Clinical Presentation  of Progressive Multiple  Sclerosis  
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by [CONTACT_614426]. Clinical attacks typi[INVESTIGATOR_614388], sensory or motor myelopathy, which worsen over days to weeks and 
resolve over weeks to months. Most patients recover a significant degree of function following a clinical attack. Although clinical recovery occurs, persistent demyelination or partial remyelination of the lesion is present. The partially denuded axons redistribute sodium-potassium ATPase channels along the axon to compensate for the myelin loss. This results in increased energy expenditure, and loss of signal coherence in the remaining axons. 
  ES in MS   Version 2.2 
  Revised 06/23/[ADDRESS_814704] lesions or lesions in the brainstem involving the motor tracts (Kassa et al., 2021; Keegan et al., 2018; Sechi et al., 2019). This can occur even in the presence of a single cord lesion, and in the absence of brain disease. This provides a good rationale for targeting spi[INVESTIGATOR_614389] a therapeutic target in patients with progressive MS. Crucially, although progressive MS is characterized by [CONTACT_614427], complete loss of axons in any particular tract is unusual, meaning that if conduction block and slowing can be overcome, there is potential to facilitate  volitional motor  function. 
 
Stimulation  in MS and SCI 
Other research groups have shown benefit of transcutaneous (through the skin) lumbar stimulation in improving spasticity (Keegan et al., 2018), gait dysfunction (Keegan et al., 2018), postural instability (Roberts et al., 2021), and bladder dysfunction (Kreydin et al., 2020) in participants with MS. However continuous use of transcutaneous stimulation is impractical due to the delivery through the skin using an external device, and the results are likely to be short lived in the absence of continued stimulation. By [CONTACT_22242], permanently implanted  epi[INVESTIGATOR_614390]. These allow for continuous stimulation which can easily be manipulated to  
optimize response through means of a remote-control device. Significant progress has been made in the research use of these permanent leads for spi[INVESTIGATOR_614391], to enable motor functions previously thought to be permanently lost after SCI. Specifically,  Harkema and  colleagues  reported  that,  after  months of rehabilitation  with  
permanently implanted spi[INVESTIGATOR_614392], volitional control of joint- specific muscles  
and independent standing were achieved by [CONTACT_614428] (Angeli et al., 2014; S. Harkema et al., 2011). Recently, our team reported that the same intervention enabled control of steppi[INVESTIGATOR_503447], which over the course of rehabilitation,  translated to  independent standing and steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (M. L. Gill et al., 2018; Grahn  
et al., 2017). 
 
Our initial case report described that our study goals were achieved within the first few sessions of permanent ES. To summarize, in the first study participant we enrolled, ES

intentional control of step-like movements while side lying with legs suspended in a gravity 
neutral  position, and  4) intentional control of bilateral  leg flexion and extension  while  upright 
with body weight supported by a harness. More recently, we reported that the same participant achieved independent standing, steppi[INVESTIGATOR_54139] a treadmill while using arm support bars to maintain  balance,  and posture and over ground walking with  minimal  assistance (M. 
L. Gill et  al., 2018). To date,  the second participant demonstrated  similar  ES-enabled  motor 
achievements. In addition to reports of ES enabling lower extremity motor functions, improvements in upper extremity(Lu et al., 2016), cardiovascular (Aslan et al., 2018; S. J. Harkema, Legg Ditterline, et al., 2018; S. J. Harkema, Wang, et al., 2018; Herrity et al., 2018; West et al., 2018), and urologic functions (Herrity et al., 2018) have been reported in participants  with SCI.  
 
Prior to proposing a trial to assess the use of permanently implanted epi[INVESTIGATOR_614393], it is pertinent to assess whether these  
individuals are responsive to stimulation using a temporary percutaneous lead used 
commonly in clinical practice for low back pain and in research for participants with spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828].

(Harkema et al. 2011). The same research group successfully replicated their results in three additional subjects (Rejc et al. 2015; Rejc et al. 2017; Angeli et al. 2014). Based on these results, we initiated a clinical trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and in 2017, we reported successful replication of Harkema et al., along with additional outcomes (Grahn et al. 2017). Based on observations made during [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], we have designed this protocol to gain additional scientific knowledge with respect to how ES may enable functions in humans with multiple sclerosis.  
 
1.4 Study  Rationale and Risk  Analysis (Risks  to Benefits  Ratio) 
 
1.4.[ADDRESS_814706]. In response to the 
complete lack of available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614385] -controlled lower extremity motor  
function, we recently conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]- phase clinical trial of epi[INVESTIGATOR_614397] (ES) in combination with task -specific training for individuals with complete  
SCI. Likewise, other research teams have shown remarkable improvements in spi[INVESTIGATOR_503439] -enabled motor functions that are retained after study participation in individuals 
with incomplete paralysis (Wagner et al., 2018). Herein, we propose leveraging the knowledge and expertise ga ined during our previous, and active, clinical trials of ES in 
participants with paralysis to determine the translational potential of ES for improvement of  
motor function and  spasticity  in patients with  myelopathy due to progressive MS.  
Completion  of the proposed experiments  in this protocol will provide data that  can be used to 
improve the scientific understanding of how ES  may enable  functional improvement after  
MS onset. This knowledge will be used to help determine if ES is a viable and useful tool in determining  which  subjects  may  be best suited  for permanently implanted ES  in the future.  
 
1.4.2 Anticipated  Risks  
Risks  associated with  task-specific training: 
In combination with ES, the rehabilitation techniques used during this study will focus on maximizing independence, load bearing, body position, and kinematics during motor tasks while providing the minimum amount of trainer assistance and body weight support necessary to safely perform tasks. Risks associated with daily training include skin irritation  
and minor bruising from  pressure  applied  during trainer assistance and body weight support, 
musculoskeletal  discomfort, fatigue,  and bladder or  bowel incontinence due to exertion  and 
abdominal pressure from support harness. There is a slight risk of fracture in the lower 
extremities. Orthostatic hypotension is a risk associated with abrupt position changes against 
gravity, specifically transitioning from sit to stand  quickly. 
 
Risks  associated with  weight -bearing  tasks:  
Risks include muscle  soreness,  fatigue,  skin irritation,  fracture,  changes  in blood pressure,  
and potential for a fall.

ES electrodes will be implanted via commonly used percutaneous implantation techniques 
for FDA -approved treatment of medically refractory pain conditions. Therefore, the risks 
associated with percutaneous implantation of the ES system for this study match the risks associated  with  ES system  implantation for  treatment  of FDA -approved conditions. 
• Undesirable changes in stimulation may occur over time. These changes in stimulation  are possibly related  to cellular  changes  in tissue  around the electrodes,  
changes  in the electrode position, loose electrical connections  and/or lead failure.  
• Placement  of a lead in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_503463] a surgical  procedure that may  expose the 
patient to risks of epi[INVESTIGATOR_307865], hematoma, infection, spi[INVESTIGATOR_6710], and/or paralysis. 
• Radicular  chest  wall  stimulation.  
• Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872]  (CSF)  leakage.  
• Persistent  pain at the electrode site or receiver  site. 
• Seroma at the incision  site.  
• Implant migration.  
• Allergic  or rejection  response to implant materials.  
• Lead  migration  and/or local  skin erosion. 
• Paralysis,  weakness,  clumsiness,  numbness, or pain below the level of  implantation.  
 
Risks  associated with  ES following  implantation: 
Hardware malfunction,  discomfort or abdominal tightness during ES,  increased  or decreased  
spasticity, bowel or bladder incontinence, shortness of breath, muscle soreness, or fatigue 
may occur  during ES. Autonomic dysreflexia is a possible risk factor  for subjects  as well.  
 
Risks  associated with  MRI  
Dislodgement of some metal implants and claustrophobia may occur during MRI. Subjects will be rigorously screened  in the same fashion as  clinical  patient  by [CONTACT_614430]. Earplugs will also be provided to keep MRI noise within a safe audible range. Due to the potential for tissue heating, image artifacts, induced voltages in the neurostimulator or leads, and lead dislodgement, MRIs will not be obtained after epi[INVESTIGATOR_614398].  
 
Ri
sks associated with  electromyography  
Risks involved with EMG  include skin irritation  or allergic  reaction  from  the adhesive used to 
apply sensors.  
 Steps  taken  to minimize  the occurrence and severity  of associated risks:  
Trained study staff and medical technicians will directly oversee all tasks. Body weight support, a safety gait belt,  and other safety measures as necessary  will be  utilized  to lessen  
the risks involved with rehabilitation and weight-bearing tasks. To mitigate risks in general, the protocol will be conducted as stated, medical professionals will be consulted, and care will be provided to address  any study- related  concerns  that arise.  All members  of the 
research team will be trained to identify the occurrence of risks related to this study. If risk occurrence is  observed, study- related  activities will be halted  until appropriate medical  care

Factors  that may lead to withdrawal:  
• Study subject  health  concerns 
• Protocol violation  (e.g., non- compliance)  
• Study- related  serious adverse events  
• Study subject’s decision to pursue activities outside of the study protocol, that in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_17439], may  compromise  data collected  within the  study protocol 
• The emergence of other problems, events,  or information, that  may  adversely  affect  
the rights, safety, or welfare of the study subject, or may substantially compromise data collected within the  study protocol 
If a serious adverse event occurs during an activity described in this protocol, a consensual decision will be made between the study subject and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_614402]. 
In the event of study withdrawal, the ES electrodes will be explanted. If explanation surgery 
is urgent due to concern for the subject’s health, the cost of the explanation procedure will be covered by [CONTACT_67300]. Aside from standard recovery, no adverse effects are anticipated  from the  removal  of percutaneous electrical  stimulator.  
If a subject fails to attend protocol activities and fails to respond for follow-up, a communication  attempt will be made to determine  if non- compliance is related  to an adverse  
event.

(Model  3086, Abbott  Neuromodulation; Nomad,  Ripple  Neuro)  
The ES electrode lead is an implantable neurostimulation device that is FDA -approved for 
treatment of neuropathic pain disorders. Up to two ES electrode leads will be implanted temporarily along the dorsal epi[INVESTIGATOR_503476] (i.e., L2- S1 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_158435]). The externalized ends of the ES electrode leads will be connected to the Nomad  neurostimulation  system  to deliver  electrical  pulse waveforms  to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_503477].

Kristin D. Zhao, Ph.D.                                                                                                                                                       CONFIDENTIAL   electrode array connected to an implanted pulse generator, along with a detailed description 
of the electrophysiological approach  used  to guide electrode positioning over  the lumbosacral 
enlargement in humans with SCI (Calvert, 2018). The same approach will be used during this study to guide electrode placement via electrophysiological monitoring of spi[INVESTIGATOR_503480].  
 
The procedures for percutaneously implanting Abbott ES electrodes are performed daily at 
Mayo  Clinic  to treat patients  suffering  from  neuropathic pain. Prior to implantation,  subjects  
will undergo a pre-operative evaluation  to minimize  the risk  of unexpected complications.  
Pre-operative assessments may be performed  to check  for any  signs of infection. 
 
To implant the temporary spi[INVESTIGATOR_503481], under fluoroscopy an electrode insertion 
needle will be  placed into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_503482] a paramedian approach and  loss of 
resistance technique to advance through the ligamentum flavum, followed by [CONTACT_503584]’s position. Once positioning is confirmed, the needle stylet will 
be removed, and  the needle will be advanced   into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814].  
 
 
Then, the leads are advanced in an anterograde fashion to the level of the lumbosacral enlargement  utilizing  fluoroscopic guidance. Following electrophysiologic confirmation of 
electrode positioning, the needle and stylet will be removed, the implantation site will be  
dressed, and the leads will be secured to the skin via an adhesive bandage. The implantation site will be  monitored for signs of infection, tissue erosion, or dislodged lead wires.  One day 
post implantation, the first follow up will take place to evaluate for adverse events. Trained

Procedure to explant ES 
 electrode leads  
After completing task -specific training with ES, the adhesive bandage covering the 
implantation site will be removed, the incision site will be opened, and the leads will be  
carefully  retracted.  Finally, the incision site  will be  cleaned and  dressed.  
 
If complications associated with temporary lead implantation (e.g., infection, severe lead migration, device malfunction, etc.) are observed, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_614403]-specific training. Participants 
will be followed up within [ADDRESS_814719]’s prior therapy regimen will not impact the PI’s decision regarding enrollment into 
the study. If the subject fits the inclusion criteria and does not demonstrate any exclusion criteria  characteristics,  prior exercise  or therapy  programs will not exclude their participation  
in the study. While enrolled in the study, subjects will be asked to follow the instructions from the study staff regarding concurrent activities. For example, if the study subject performed locomotor training at a local gym prior to the study, they would be asked to  
continue that activity while  participating in the trial.  
 
5.6 Packaging and Labeling  
The packaging of the devices  will be from  the manufacturer’s  clinical  supply. The  following 
will be added to the devices used within this investigation: “CAUTION – Investigational Device. Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (or [LOCATION_002]) law to  
investigational use” 
 
5.7 Masking/Blinding  of Study  
This is an unblinded study. The  PIs, co-investigators, and  subjects  will not be blinded, and  
all participants  will receive  the same treatment.  
 
5.8 Receiving,  Storage,  Distribution  and Return  
 
5.8.1 Receipt  of Investigational Devices  
The percutaneously-delivered ES electrode leads will be acquired either through purchase or donation from  Abbott. A representative from  Abbott will  ship the devices  to Mayo  Clinic  and

Study engineers, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and research technicians perform the device 
p
rogramming and determine maximum stimulation parameters in real time. Device operators 
have been trained by [CONTACT_614434] ( i.e., Abbott) on device manipulation during previous 
studies utilizing the same technology in SCI patients.  
 
T
he surface area of each OCTRODE electrode is 0.1319 cm^2 based on manufacturer’s 
specifications.  
Based on literature, we conclude that stimulation that results in a charge density per pulse of 
no more than 30 µC/cm^2, poses no safety concerns. 
The charge density per pulse is defined by [CONTACT_614435].  
The lower limit for current amplitude per electrode that will be applied in this study is 0.1 mA; The lower limit for the pulse width that will be applied in this study is 250 µs . 
Therefore, if we applied the lower limit stimulation amplitude of 0.1 mA, the upper limit of pulse width that could be selected to stay below the current density per pulse threshold per pulse is [ZIP_CODE] µs; since the manufacturing limit of the device is 1000 µs, 1000 µs will be selected as the pulse width upper limit for this study.   Similarly, if a stimulation pulse width 
of the stated minimum of 250 µs was selected, up to 15.8 mA could be applied to stay below the charge density per pulse threshold; therefore, 15.[ADDRESS_814722] the charge density per pulse over 30 µC/cm^2 (S.F Cogan et al., 2016; Mccreery et al., 1990). 
 ES task -specific daily training will consist of lower extremity stretching, supi[INVESTIGATOR_614405], seated trunk strengthening and balance activities, and locomotor training 
including task-specific stand and step training on a treadmill and over ground. Standing and steppi[INVESTIGATOR_614406].  
 
Training sessions will begin upon completion  of baseline testing.  Subjects  will participate  in 
[ADDRESS_814723]  12 sessions.  
Activities include tasks specific to supi[INVESTIGATOR_503489], balance  
training, stand and step (reciprocal flexion/extension) training. Heart rate will be recorded prior to, and after, each session, and at any time the intervention is paused due to a concern. Environments include the body weight support treadmill (BWST) system to allow trainer-assisted stand and step  activities as needed, custom standing frame, and a hi/lo mat for 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_503495].  As the subjects progress their intentional motor ability with 
standing and steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], BWS will be removed, and assist will continue to be provided on an as 
needed basis. Any visit to the laboratory when ES is enabled will be considered a training session. Activities chosen for each  session will be  based on the subject’s progression. At or 
near the conclusion of the training regimen, a Neurologist with a specialty in MS will conduct a clinical examination with stimulation turned on.  
Over the course of rehabilitation sessions with ES, one additional x-ray may be performed to 
  ES in MS   Version 2.2 
  Revised 06/23/[ADDRESS_814724]’s written consent. 
 
 
 
Aim [ADDRESS_814725] of ES and task -specific training on lower extremity motor 
function in individuals with severe lower extremity motor disability due to progressive MS using the primary outcomes of kinematics (movement), kinetics (forces), and electromyography (muscle activity, EMG) collected during gait, standing, and side lying motor tasks. Data will be reduced and summarized using standard biomechanical approaches, to quantify gait rhythm, lower extremity joint and body center of mass ranges of motion (during gait, standing, and side lying), and timing of muscle activations and ground reaction force peaks. Secondary outcomes include functional mobility assessments utilizing motion capture data, as well as the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Safety  and tolerability will be 
assessed while monitoring vital signs and stimulation responsiveness during daily sessions and testing dates. 
 
Aim [ADDRESS_814726] (Smith et al.,

via pulses of 1 ms duration at intensities of up to 100 mA using biphasic, charge balanced 
stimulation (DS8R, Digitimer Ltd., [LOCATION_006]). Stimulation  will be delivered to the skin over the 
intra-spi[INVESTIGATOR_614408] T10, T11, T12, L1, L2vertebrae,  
with subjects in  a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. Evoked 
potentials will be recorded via surface EMG electrodes placed bilaterally over the rectus  
femoris,  vastus lateralis,  medial  hamstring, tibialis  anterior,  medial  gastrocnemius,  and soleus 
muscles. We will record evoked potentials while relaxed using stimulus intensities from 1 - 
100 mA at increments of 10 mA for each stimulus locationT10 -L2. Stimulus intensities that 
are at the threshold for evoking motor potentials will be delivered during the following actions: while attempting prolonged maximal contractions of all muscles; during attempts to  
contract  the left leg; and  during attempts to contract the right leg. 
 
Gait analysis: Full body kinematic parameters will be acquired with a computerized video motion analysis system. A surface electromyography (EMG) system will be used for data collection.  Muscle activity will be collected from all or a subset of the following lower  
extremity and trunk muscles: soleus, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, hamstrings, quadriceps, hip adductors, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, abdominals and spi[INVESTIGATOR_608583]. Ground reaction force data will be acquired from force plates or pressure mat  
technology located in the floor or as in-shoe sensors. EMG and ground reaction force data will be time-synchronized with the motion cameras.  
 
Voluntary movement in side -lying and supi[INVESTIGATOR_313698]: Voluntary movement data will be 
acquired during a variety of volitional tasks including standing, and supi[INVESTIGATOR_614409]-lying steppi[INVESTIGATOR_454009]. Kinematics and EMG measurements will be obtained from a motion  
analysis system and surface EMG system.  All or a subset of the following muscles or 
muscle groups will be tested: soleus, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, hamstrings,  
quadriceps, hip adductors, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, abdominals and spi[INVESTIGATOR_608583]. 
 
Spasticity: One or both of the following will be used to measure lower extremity spasticity: the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) (Bohannon et al., 1987) where the subject will be 
placed in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_614410]; and the pendulum test  which is a biomechanical method of evaluating 
muscle tone using surface- based kinematic assessments that uses gravity to provoke muscle 
stretch reflexes during passive swinging of the lower  limb.  
 
Functional mobility test: The following test will be performed: Timed Up and Go (TUG) (
Podsiadlo et al., 1991) . The TUG test is  used to assess a person's mobility and requires 
both static and dynamic balance. 
 
MS QOL  Inventory (MSQLI): Multiple  Sclerosis  Quality  of Life Inventory (Fischer  et al., 
1999), a comprehensive outcomes assessment battery will be administered to assess many facets of the participants’ quality of life. Several scores, are captured, including Overall Health Status, Modified Fatigue Scale, Sexual Satisfaction Scale, Bladder Control Scale,  
Bowel  Control Scale,  Perceived  Deficits  Questionnaire and Mental  Health  Inventory.

7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample  Size Determination  
Due to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_236986], no formal power calculations were performed for this 
proposal. The number of subjects was selected based on budgetary, space, and personnel time constraints. Ten participants (five males; five female) will be enrolled to complete this study,  
depending on need for contingency subjects. Participants will receive 4 weeks of ES and serve as their  own control. 
 
7.2 Statistical  Methods  
Statistical Methods: Continuous data will be summarized as median (inner quartile range). Categorical data will be presented as frequency (percentage). Graphical presentations of 
subject -level data will be used for all endpoints. Individual data points will be plotted over 
time,  from pre  to post stimulation and training. 
 
Modeling: Statistical models will be used both to estimate the ES effect on endpoints, as well as to provide estimates  of variability to  enable sample  size estimation for  future  studies. 
Models for post- ES treatment  will be fit using linear  regression  using the baseline measure as 
a covariate. Both the ES treatment effect and the residual variance estimate will be reported.  
Standard deviations of the differences in pre- and post -ES measurements will also be  
reported. Furthermore, correlations between pre- and post- ES assessments, as well as post  
task specific training stim-off and stim-on assessments will be calculated to aid future study design. Transformations of endpoints to achieve symmetry in the distribution (normality will be difficult to assess  with  this sample  size)  will be used as necessary.  
 
Handling of Missing Data: Due to the small sample size, sophisticated missing data  
techniques like imputation are likely to be unreliable. For all analyses, only subjects with complete data for the necessary analysis will be included. We will attempt to limit missing  
data by [CONTACT_614436]. Only prospective enrollees who have been fully optimized from a rehabilitation point of view will be offered enrollment in the study. To minimize the financial burden on study participants and their families, they will be offered money to offset the cost of travel and accommodation during the study. If a study participant ends the study early, a similar replacement participant will be sought. Missing data in survey instruments will be minimized  
by [CONTACT_614437], and inspection for completion by [CONTACT_614438]. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_814729]  Population(s) for Analysis 
All-completed  population: Only  subjects  who completed  all study related procedures  and 
follow-up will be included; however, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_503516] a subject who completed  most of the study visits and procedures. 
 
  
  ES in MS   Version 2.2 
  Revised 06/23/[ADDRESS_814730]  (UADE)  will be recorded  on the appropriate case 
report  form.  Records  of these events  will be maintained  and reports  submitted  to the FDA  
and IRB according to the regulatory requirements. Expected clinical adverse events and  
nonsignificant (not serious) clinical  adverse events will not be reported. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_814731]  (UADE)  
A UADE is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or 
death caused by, or associated with, a device if that effect, problem or death was not previously identified  in nature,  severity,  or degree of  incidence in the investigational plan  or IDE application 
(including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of  subjects. 
 Adverse Effect  (Event)  
Any untoward medical  occurrence in a subject  involved in clinical  study of an investigational 
device; regardless of the causal relationship of the problem with the device or, if applicable, other study related treatment(s).  
 Associated with the investigational device:  There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse 
effect may  have been caused  by [CONTACT_14882]. 
 Life-threatening  adverse effect:  Any adverse effect  that places  the subject,  in the view  of either 
the investigator or the sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the effect as it  occurred . It does 
not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Serious adverse effect:  An adverse effect is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death  
• a life-threatening AE 
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707]  
• a persistent  or significant disability/incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 U
nanticipated adverse effect:  Any adverse effect, the nature, specificity, severity, or frequency 
of which is not consistent with the risk information in the clinical study protocol or elsewhere in 
the current  IDE application. 
 General  Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition. At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet 
the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614411] 2.2 
  Revised 06/23/[ADDRESS_814732] unless specifically  instructed 
otherwise in this protocol. Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as  an 
adverse  event  if the condition meets  the criteria  for an  adverse event.  
 
 
Neither the  condition,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery  are reported as  
an adverse event in the  following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition. Surgery will not be reported as an outcome of an 
AE if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful
 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614412]-study  Adverse Event 
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained. At the  last 
scheduled visit, the local investigator should instruct each subject to report, to the local investigator, any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study. The local investigator should notify the study regulatory sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time  after a 
subject  has discontinued or terminated  study participation  that may reasonably be related to this 
study. The sponsor should also be notified if the local investigator should become aware of the 
development of problems, cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived

A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risk  to Subjects  or Others  (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
Any unanticipated  problem or adverse event  that meets  all of the following three criteria:  
Serious: Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be physical, 
psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the subject  or others 
(including individuals who  are not research  subjects). These include:  
(1) death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or 
prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth  defect/anomaly; (6) 
breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14846], safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromise the research  data,  AND  
Unanticipated: (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already  d
 escribed  as 
potential risks  in the protocol, consent document, not listed  in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not 
part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an

8.[ADDRESS_814733] seek  information  on adverse events  by 
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Study subjects will be routinely 
questioned about adverse effects at study visits. Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event section of the case report  form  (CRF)  or in  a separate AE worksheet. All  clearly  related  
signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic, laboratory or procedure results should be recorded  in the source document. 
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded. All observed or volunteered adverse effects (serious or non-serious) and abnormal test findings, regardless of the treatment group if applicable or suspected causal relationship to the investigational device or if applicable  other study treatment  or diagnostic product(s) will be recorded  in the 
subjects’ case history.  For all adverse effects sufficient information will be pursued and or 
obtained as to permit; an adequate determination of the outcome, an assessment of the casual  
relationship between the adverse effect and the investigational device or, if applicable other  
study treatment or diagnostic product. The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study  
treatment or participation is not the probable cause. Serious adverse events that are still  
ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up, to determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be at least possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
 
Causality  and severity  assessment  
The sponsor-investigator will promptly review  documented adverse effects  and abnormal test 
findings to  determine  1) if the abnormal test  finding should be classified as  an adverse  effect;  
2) if there is a reasonable  possibility  that the adverse effect  was caused  by [CONTACT_614439]; and 3) if the adverse effect meets the criteria for a serious  
adverse effect.  
 
If the sponsor-investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship to the investigational device or other study treatments,” the adverse effect will be  
classified  as associated  with  the use of the investigational device or other  study treatments  for 
reporting purposes. If the sponsor-investigator’s final determination  of causality  is 
“unknown but not related to the investigational device or other study treatments,” this determination and the rationale for the determination will be documented in the respective subject’s  case history.

assumptions was conducted after [ADDRESS_708151] deviation for the change in HAMD -17 total 
score from Baseline to Week 8 is 6.0 points , 34 evaluable subjects will 
provide 80% power to detect a minimum mean reduction of [ADDRESS_708152].

approximately [ADDRESS_708153] one 
dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256]. The Safety Analysis Set will be used for the 
analysis of all safety endpoints.  
The Full Analysis Set  (FAS)  include s all subjects who received at least 
one dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_542653] a Baseline value and at 
least one  post-Baseline value for the HAMD -[ADDRESS_708154] deviation, minimum, and maximum. For each categorical 
outcome, the number and percentage of subjects will be repor ted. 
Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_542697]. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from 
Baseline to Week 8 in depression as measured by [CONTACT_542698] -17 total 
score.  
The HAMD -17 total score w ill be analyzed using mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM). The model will include effects for visit, 
Baseline HAMD -[ADDRESS_708155] will also be estimated at each of the other time points 
(Weeks 2, 4, and 6) using the same MMRM model described above , 
and will be considered secondary  analyses.  
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints (CGI -I, CGI -S, SCOPA,  and 
EQ-5D-5L) will be analyzed using similar MMRM models  as for the 
primary efficacy endpoint , except that the Baseline value of the 
endpoint being analyzed will be included in the model as a covariate 
instead of th e Baseline HAMD -17 total score. For CGI -I the response 
is the CGI -I score (as opposed to the change from Baseline), and the 
Baseline CGI -S score will be used as the covariate.  
For each of the continuous efficacy endpoints, in addition to MMRM, a 
paired t -test using a last observation carried forward imputation method 
will be performed at each visit.  
For the HAMD -17 responder endpoint s (≥50% reduction from

be summarized by [CONTACT_765], including 95% confidence intervals.  
Observed cases (subjects with missing values at a given visit are 
excluded) as well as missing values im puted as non -responders will 
be presented.  
Safety Analyses  
Safety endpoints  will be summarized using descriptive statistics. 
UPDRS Part III and MMSE will be analyzed using similar MMRM 
models as for the primary efficacy endpoint, except that the Baseline 
value of the endpoint being analyzed (either UPDRS Part III or 
MMSE) will be included as a covariate, and in the Baseline scor e-by-
visit interaction term, instead of the HAMD -[ADDRESS_708156] terminology using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs), TEAEs leading to disco ntinuation, 
TEAEs related to study drug, TEAEs by [CONTACT_764], serious 
adverse events (SAEs), and SAEs related to study drug will be 
summarized.  
Descriptive statistics for ECG, vital signs and weight, C-SSRS, 
MMSE , UPDRS Part III, and clinical laboratory parameters, including 
changes from Baseline, will be tabulated by [CONTACT_7206]. Additionally, 
categorical analyses will be conducted on the incidence of subjects 
with prolonged QTc intervals and changes in QTc intervals in 
accordance with Internat ional Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidelines.

This document is a research protocol and the described study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol  and the International Council for Harmoni sation (ICH)  Good 
Clinical Practice  Guideline (GCP) . All key personnel (all individuals responsible for the 
design and conduct of this study) have c ompleted or will complete human  subject s protection 
training.  
1.1 Background Information  
Parkinson ’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily 
by [CONTACT_542699] ; however , there are also associated behavioral symptoms that are fr equent, 
severe , and disabling . Mood disorders and , in particular , depression occur in approximately 
50% of patients  with PD, can occur at any stage , and increase in duration and severity as the 
disease progresses (Marsh 2013 ). Symptoms of depression in Parkinson ’s disease (DPD ) are 
associated with increased morbidity a nd diminished quality of life. Conversely, improved 
depression is associated with reduced physical disability and imp roved quality of life 
(Menza  et al. 2009 ). The pathophysiology and underlying  mechan isms of DPD  are unknow n. 
Psych ological factors related to the progressive disability in this incurable disease are likel y 
to contribute significantly. In addition, involvement of widespread neurodegeneration and 
dysregulation , particularly in the mesolimbic system, can  also contri bute to depression. 
Regardless o f the cause, the presence of DPD  is a significant concern that requires treatment 
to improve the patient ’s quality of life.  
It is important to note that, in the diagnosis of depression , consideration should be given to 
motor defi cits associated with PD, particularly decreased activity, cognitive dysfunction , and 
somatic complaints , which can complic ate the diagnosis using standard  Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -Fifth Edition ( DSM -5) criteria  (Goodarzi et al. 2016 ). 
To address the unique ch allenges in the diagnosis of DPD , a National Institute of 
Neurological Disorders and Stroke/  National Institute of Mental Health ( NINDS/NIMH ) Task 
Force has developed recommendations for the diagnosis of DPD  (Marsh et al. 2006 ). 
Recommendations for an appropriate diagnosis of DPD , which will be applied in this study, 
include: (1) an inclusive approach to symptom assessm ent to enhance reliability of ratings in 
PD and avoid the need to attribute symptoms to a particular cause; (2)  the inclusion of 
subsyndromal depression in clinical research studies of depression of PD; (3) the 
specification of timing of assessments for PD  patients with motor fluctuations; and (4) the 
use of informants for cognitively impaired patients (Marsh et al. 2006).   
After a diagnosis of DPD  has been made , treatment  options are to be considered. Behavioral 
interventions appear to have some benefit ; however, behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_542655]: ACP -103-048 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: [ADDRESS_708167] benefit with a large degree of variability ( Xie et al. 2015 ). In general, traditional 
antidepressants have been found to be safe  and well tolerated and  have efficacy in DPD , 
although th e time course and magnitude of response can differ ( Liu et al. 2013 ; 
Moonen  et al. 2014 ; Rocha et al. 2013 ). As in the general population, despi[INVESTIGATOR_542656], residual depressive 
symptoms are often evident despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a significant response to an antidepressant medication or 
other intervention ( Marsh 2013 ; Rush et al. 2006 ). Patients with PD may benefit less from 
antidepressant treatment, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, than do elderly 
patients without PD ( Weintraub et al. 2005 ). Thus, there is a clear need for efficacious and 
well-tolerated agents to treat patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and current research continues to investigate novel molecular and cellular 
mechanisms of augmentation of antidepressant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

The scope of the development program for pi[INVESTIGATOR_387343]. At the time of approval, 616 mos tly older, late -stage PDP subjects had been evaluated in 
16 countries over a span of >10 years. Clinically meaningful efficacy was established in 
Study ACP -103-020, a 6 -week, placebo -controlled Phase 3 study. This efficacy was 
supported by [CONTACT_542700] -term Phase 2b/[ADDRESS_708170] frequently reported treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
were in the central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal, and psychiatric systems. Most 
events were mild to moderate in intensity. T he most common CNS TEAEs included dizziness 
(including postural), headache, and somnolence (drowsiness). Common gastrointestinal 
disturbances included dyspepsia, nausea, constipation, and vomiting. Severe nausea and 
vomiting were dose limiting in a few cas es. Reported psychiatric conditions included 
agitation, insomnia, and confusional state . Refer  to the current IB for the most up -to-date

1.3.2 Alzheimer’s Disease Psychosis  
Evidence from the recently completed Phase 2 study (ACP -103-019) suggests that

Study ACP -103-[ADDRESS_708171] a score of 4 or 
greater on either the hallucinations or delusions scale of the Neuropsychiatri c Inventory -
Nursing Home Version (NPI -NH) or a combined hallucinations and delusions score of 6 or 
greater. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from Baseline to Day 43 in the NPI -NH 
psychosis score (delusions+hallucinations domains).  
A total of 181 su bjects were randomized (n=90 pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34  mg and n=91 placebo) with 
178 subjects included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS ) (n=87 pi[INVESTIGATOR_387349] n=91 placebo). 
The mean (standard error [SE]) age of subjects was 85.9 (0.4 8) years. The mean (SE) 
Baseline NPI-NH psychosis score for all FAS subjects was 9.8 (0.39) with comparable mean 
scores in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] (9.5) and placebo (10.0) groups. The mean (SE) Mini -mental State 
Examination (MMSE) score for all FAS subjects was 10.1  (0.40).  
Efficacy results for the primary endpoint (NPI -NH psychosis score after 6  weeks of treatment 
[Day 43 ] demonstrated a significant (p=0.0451 ; effect size [Cohen ’s d]= -0.320 ) treatment 
effect for pi[INVESTIGATOR_387350]. Prespecified subgroup analyses supported a 
clinically relevant treatment effect in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_387351], as a larger effect size was 
generally observed in subjects with more severe psychosis. Similarly, the proportion of 
responders (subjects with 30% and 50% reductions from Baseline) was statisticall y 
significantly greater in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_387352] ( Table  1-1). On the 
endpoint of mean change in NPI -NH psychosis score at Week  12, pi[INVESTIGATOR_387353] 12 but the difference from placebo was not maintained due to an

With respect to safety, pi[INVESTIGATOR_542668] -tolerated with no new safety 
observations in this elderly and frail patient population compared to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_542669].  An equal number of post -randomization deaths were reported: 4 deaths in the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_387357] 4 in the placebo group.  
There were mor e serious adverse events ( SAEs ) reported in pi[INVESTIGATOR_387351] (16.7%) than 
in the placebo group (11.0%).  A review of the reported SAEs, both in the placebo and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_387358], did not reveal the presence of any common, underlying 
pathophysiologic mec hanism or cause.  However, there were fewer discontinuations due to 
treatment emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_387351] (8.9%) compared 
with the placebo group (12.1%).

1.4 Study Rationale  
The rationale for the use of pi[INVESTIGATOR_542672]:  
5-HT 2A serotonin receptors represent important targ ets for depression. A variety of studies 
have shown antidepressant activity from compounds with potent antagonist or inverse agonist 
activity at 5 -HT 2A receptors, and to varying degrees 5 -HT 2C receptors, but low affinity to 
serotonin, norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and d opamine transporters , either alone or when co -administered 
with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; see  Table  1-2). These compounds include 
volinanserin, pruvanserin, ketanserin, ritanserin, mirtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], mianserin , and trazodone (see  
Table  1-2). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256], with its potent activity as a [ADDRESS_708174]/inverse agonist and 
lesser activity as a [ADDRESS_708175]/inverse agonist, has a similar receptor profile to many 
compounds with antidepressant activity. Therefore, although there are no pre clinical data on 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_542673], it would also be expected to have 
antidepressant activity.

Subjects may be discontinued or withdrawn from the study for a number of reasons, 
including, but not limited to, those listed below:  
 Lack of efficacy  
 Adverse event  
 Death  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Non-compliance with study drug  
 Use of prohibited medications  
 Physician decision  
 Pregnancy  
 Protocol  deviation  
 Study terminated by [CONTACT_2728]  
 Subject withdraws consent  
 Lack of a reliable caregiver/informant  
 Other  
If at any time the C -SSRS results  for a given subject reveal potential suicidality, then the 
Investigator should assess the clinical significance of such results. If a clinically significant 
risk of suicidality is identified for a subject, then the Investigator should discontinue the 
subject and implement appropriate treatment ( Section  6.3.6 ). 
Every reasonable effort should be made to complete the Visit 6 / end of treatment  (EOT) and 
the safety follow -up period if a subject discontinues from the study for any reason.  
If a subject is lost to follow -up, every reasonable effort should be made to phone the subject

including the evaluations specified at the E OT visit outlined in  Table  S–1. Unless t he subject 
has withdrawn consent to be contact[CONTACT_387415], every reasonable effort will be made to 
complete the 2-week safety follow -up telephone call for all subjects who withdraw 
prematurely. All information will be reported on the applicable pages  of the electronic case 
report form (eCRF).  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for any reason. Such 
reasons may include , but not be limited to, the following:  
 Occurrence of AEs unknown to date in respect of their nature, se verity, and duration or 
the unexpected incidence of known AEs  
 Medical or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the study  
Regulatory Authorities also have the right to terminate the conduct of the study in their 
region for any reason.  
4.5 Prior  and Concomitant Therapy  
Lifetime antidepressant use and response is to be recorded. All other medications used within  
24 weeks prior to Visit 2 through Visit 7 (telephone visit) or E OT are to be recorded.  
In order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therapy is administered, it is essential that 
subjects be instructed not to take any medication without prior consultation with the 
Investigator (unless the subject is receiving treatment for a medical emergency).  
4.5.1 Permitted, Restricted, and Prohibited Medi cations  
Prohibitions and restrictions for concomitant medications, as specified in Appendix A and 
Appendix B, should be followed between Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 6/E OT. Medications 
that can p rolong QT interval are prohibited (or restricted if approved by [CONTACT_542703]) as specified in Appendix A. These appendices do not constitute an 
exhaustive list and any questions regarding prohibited and restricted medications  or the use 
of medications that could interfere with study conduct should be discussed with the Medical 
Monitor or appropriate designee.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: [ADDRESS_708188] is on a restricted or prohibited medication at Screening, the medication should be 
adjusted or discontinue d only if it is determined by [CONTACT_542704] (e.g., if the subject's symptoms are not well -controlled or if the subject cannot 
tolerate the current medication).  
The Investigator may prescribe, adjust, or discontinue appropria te medication to treat or 
manage AEs. If a prohibited medication is prescribed to treat an AE, the subject may remain 
in the study if the Sponsor and Investigator (or designee) determine s that it is appropriate for 
the subject to remain in the study.  
All o ther subjects who take a prohibited medication during the study will be discontinued, 
unless the discontinuation presents an unacceptable medical risk. The justification to allow a 
subject to continue in the study will be made by [CONTACT_1034], with medical input from the 
Investigator, and will be documented. If a subject is allowed to remain in the study on 
prohibited medication that is not prescribed to treat an AE, this will be reported as a major 
protocol deviation and not a waiver.  
[ADDRESS_708189] will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34  mg (provided as two 17 mg NUPLAZID

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 38 of 68 6.1 Screening Assessments  
6.1.1 Mini -Mental State Examination  
The MMSE is  a brief 30 -point questionnaire that is used to quantitatively assess cognition 
(Folstein et al. 1975 ). The MMSE includes simple questions and problems in a number of 
areas: the time and place of testing, repeating lists of word s, arithmetic, language use and 
comprehension, and copying a drawing. The MMSE is being used in this study to screen for 
cognitive impairment  and it will also be used for safety assessment at other time points . 
6.1.[ADDRESS_708194] ’s PD and DPD diagnose s and treatment s (including approximate dates of onset) . 
Subjects may be asked to provide pharmacy or medical records to substantiate the med ication 
history ( Section  4.5). 
Demographic information, including date of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity will be recorded as 
well. Any new medical condition reported after the ICF has been signed will be captured as 
an AE. 
6.1.3 [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_542681] ( Fava and Davidson 1996 ; Fava 2003 ) is a clinician -assisted questionnaire 
that is to be completed only for s ubjects who are currently taking an antidepressant  at 
Screening.  The MGH ATRQ examines a patient ’s antidepressant treatment history using  
specific anchor points to define the adequacy of both the dose and duration of each 
antidepressant course, as well as the degree of symptomatic improvement obtained with each 
course. This validated questionnaire allows for the determination of inadequate response  to 
antidepressant therapy Chandler et al. 2010 ). If taking an approved SSRI/SNRI, subjects  
should be exposed to an antidepressant  for at least 4 weeks at a dose appropriate for this 
population.   
6.2 Efficacy Assessments  
6.2.1 Hamilton Depression Scale –17 item  
The Hamilton Depression Scale –17 items ( HAM D-17), is a multiple item questionnaire used 
to provide an indication of  depression,  and as a guide to evaluate recovery ( Hamilton  1960). 
The quest ionnaire is designed for adults to rate the severity of depression by [CONTACT_542705],  
feelings of guilt, suicide ideation,  insom nia, agitation or retardation,  anxiety,  weight loss,  and 
somatic symptoms. Each item on the questionnaire is scored on a 3  or 5 point scale, 
depending on the item, and the total score is compared to the corresponding descriptor. A

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 39 of 68 score of 0 -7 is considere d to be normal. Scores of 14 or higher indicate moderate, severe, or 
very severe depression. Assessment ti me is estimated at 20  minutes.  
6.2.2 Clinical Global Impression –Severity and Improvement Scales  
The CGI -S scale is a clinician -rated, [ADDRESS_708195] ’s depression  at the time of assessment using the Investigator ’s judgment and past 
experience with subjects who have the same disorder ( i.e., depression  in Parkinson ’s disease ) 
(Guy 1976 ). 
The CGI -I is a clinician -rated, [ADDRESS_708196]’s depression  at the time of assessment, relat ive to the symptoms at Baseline .  
6.2.3 Scale of Outcomes in Parkinson’s Disease - Sleep Scale  
The SCOPA Sleep Scale was developed for research in Parkinson disease to evaluate 
nighttime sleep and daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] ( Marinus et al. 2003 ). This scale has high internal 
consistency for the nighttime sleep and daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_542682] (0.88 and 0.91, 
respectively), and test -retest reliabilities (0.94 and 0.89, respectively). Scores on the SCOPA 
Sleep Scale show high correlations between the nighttime sleep scale and the Pi [INVESTIGATOR_22336] (0.83), and between the daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_542683] (0.81). The coefficient of variation of both the nighttime sleep and the 
daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_542684], indicating a better ability to detect differences between 
individuals.  
6.2.4 EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument used as a measure of health outcome 
(Kind  1996 ). It measures 5 di mensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
anxiety/depression) , each of which has [ADDRESS_708197] 5 levels of 
severity (no problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme 
problems) withi n a particular EQ -5D dimension. The EQ -5D-5L Proxy Version 1 will be 
used. For this version, a study partner/caregiver (the proxy) is asked to rate subject's 
health -related quality of life in their (the proxy ’s) opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  
6.3 Safety Assessments  
6.3.1 Physical Examina tions  
A general physical examination will be conducted. The physical exam procedures will 
include the following organ systems:  
 Head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat  
 Skin

has been sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] ≥3 minutes.  
6.3.4 Height , Weight, and Body Mass Index  
Height will be measured in centimeters.  
Weight will be measured in kilograms.  
Body mass index  (BMI) will be calculat ed using the following formula:  
Weight (kg) / [height (m)][ADDRESS_708199] in a 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_387382]. ECG tracings (paper or electronic) will be 
reviewed and interpreted by a qualified clinician. ECG tracings and results (ventricular rate, 
PR, QRS, QT, QTcF , and QTcB intervals) will be included and summarized in the subject's 
study records. The ECG will be completed in triplicat e at Visit 1 (Screening) within 
3 minutes, and as a single tracing at all other visits.  
6.3.6 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS monitors changes in suicidal thinking and behavior over time, in order to 
determine risk ( Posner et al. 2011 ). The following 4 constructs are measured: the severity of 
ideation, the intensity of ideation, behavior, and lethality.  
The C -SSRS will be used to assess s uicidal ideations and behaviors. T he Baseline/Screening 
version will be administere d at Visit 1 ( Screening), and the Since Last Visit version will be

(Section  4.4). 
6.3.7 Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale  
The UPDRS is a comprehensive battery of motor and behavioral indices derived from the 
Columbia Sca le (Goetz et al.  2007 ), providing explicit rating criteria that have undergone 
testing for reliability. Only Part III (motor examination) will be administered.  
The UPDRS assessments should be conducted in the “on” state. This will ensure that noise 
associated with a subject ’s “on/off ” status does not confound interpretation of the motor 
function data.  
6.3.8 Laboratory Evaluations  
The laboratory evaluations will include, but are not be limited to, the following:  
Clinical chemistry tests  
o Sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), carbon

documented.  
Urine toxicity screen  
o Subjects who test positive for amphetamines may be retested if they agree to 
abstain from the medication for the length of their participation in the study and if 
abstinen ce from medication usage is achieved at least 7 days prior to Visit 2 
(Baseline). The repeat test, and any other tests, must be negative for them to 
participate in the study.

Subjects who discontinue  early  or complete the study should return to standard of care. The 
Sponsor will provide investigative sites with [ADDRESS_708203] of care therapy after their participation in the study.  
6.4 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits may occur as determined by [CONTACT_737]. The following safety 
assessments generally should be recorded at each unscheduled visit: assessment of AEs, 
assessment of concomitant medications/treatments, and measurement of vital signs. The 
Investigator may perform any additional safety evaluations deemed by [CONTACT_542706] d. 
7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
7.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related ” (US FDA  2012 ).  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgment a bout causality or seriousness. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -
Study: ACP -103-048 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 44 of 68 label use, use in combination  with another drug) and from any route of administration, 
formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE.  
AEs do not include the following:  
 Stable or intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglasses) that are 
present prior to Baseline and do not worsen during the study  
 Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, t ooth extraction, 
transfusion). The condition that lead s to the procedure is an AE if not present at 
Baseline  
 Overdose of concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms unless the subject 
is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913]  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120004] (situation where an 
untow ard medical occurrence has not occurred)  
 Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, but if it occurs, it will be reported on a 
pregnancy form  
Adverse events will be recorded from the time informed consent is obtained through the 
duration of the study.  All AEs  must be either resolved or stable at end of study. If ongoing at 
the end of the study the subject should be referred for appropriate treatment.  
7.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
In addition to the severity rating, each AE will be classified by [CONTACT_542707] “serious ” 
or “not serious. ” The seriousness of an event will be defined according to the applicable 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event. An SAE is one that meets one or 
more of the following:  
 Is fatal  
 Is immediately life threatening  
 Results in disability or permanent damage  
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Prolongs existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in an offspring)  
 Is medically significant  
Study: ACP -103-048 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: [ADDRESS_708204] caused death.  
Definition of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_542686] a full a dmission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431800]. This includes prolongation of an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Examples of visits to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149691]:  
 Emergency room visits ( that do not result in a full hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063])  
 Outpatient surgery  
 Preplanned or elective procedures  
 Protocol procedures  
 Social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], defined as admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1315] a result of inadequate 
family support or care at the subject ’s primary  residence  
Definition of Disability or Permanent Damage  
Disability is defined as a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions.  
Definition of Medically Significant  
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149693], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or 
surgical in tervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_542687].  
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator or Medical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution.

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 46 of 68 7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event  
7.2.1 Severity of Event  
The severity of each AE will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported in detail as indicated 
on the eCRF:  
Mild:  awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal 
discomfort, and not interfering with normal everyday activities  
Moderate:  sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
Severe:  incapacitating and/or preventing n ormal everyday activities  
7.2.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by [CONTACT_5256] “related ” or 
“not related. ” An event is considered related if there is a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have b een caused by [CONTACT_542708] (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or 
arguments to suggest possible causation).  
Consider the following when assessing causality:  
 Temporal associations between the agent and the event  
 Response to cessation (de -challenge) or re -challenge  
 Compatibility with known class effect  
 Known effects of concomitant medications  
 Pre-existing risk factors  
 A plausible mechanism  
 Concurrent illnesses  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Duration  
The start and stop dates for AEs will be recorded using the following c riteria:  
 Start:  Date of the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_149688]  
 Stop:  Date when AE either ceased permanently or changed in severity  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Frequency  
The frequency of the AE should be indicated according to the following definitions:  
 Single:  Experienced once, without recurrence

last report or visit.  
Note that any use of medicatio n (and specifically any newly prescribed medication) during 
the course of a study may indicate the occurrence of an AE that may need to be recorded on 
both the AE and the concomitant medication page.  
All AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_542709].  
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE eCRF page using appropriate 
medical terminology. Severity and relationship to study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_3786] . 
When possible, clinical AEs should be described by [CONTACT_542710] 
(e.g.,  “cold” or “seasonal allergies ” instead of “runny nose ”). 
All AEs, whether or not related to the study drug , must be fully and completely documented 
on the AE eCRF and in the subject ’s notes.  
7.4.[ADDRESS_708207] be reported within 24 hours of discov ery to the Sponsor  or its designee ; use 
the appropriate form for  initial and/or follow -up reporting.  
At a minimum, events identified by [CONTACT_542711], 
unexpected, and related to study drug must be brought to the attention of th e responsible 
Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee ( IRB/EC ). These wil l be provided by [CONTACT_542712]. For European Union member states, the Sponsor  or its 
designee will provide reports of suspected unexpected serious adverse rea ctions directly to 
the ECs, as required by [CONTACT_19666]. In all other countries, it is the Investigator ’s 
responsibility to provide these expedited reports to the responsible IRB/EC. It is also the 
Investigator ’s responsibility to notify the responsib le IRB/EC regarding any new and 
significant safety information.  
For this study, sites will complete the paper SAE, Pregnancy (Section  7.4.3 ) and/or  Overdose  
(Section  7.4.4 ) form (for initial and/or follow -up information) including available supporting 
documentation relevant to the event and fax or email (within 24 hours of discovery) to the 
contact [CONTACT_542713], Pregnancy, and Overdose forms.

information or until such events have resolved or the Investigator, in conjunction with the 
Sponsor , deems the m to be chronic or stable.  
In the event of any SAE (other than death), the study subject will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_3786] (or designee) using the telephone number provided in the ICF. All subjects 
experiencing an SAE will be seen by [CONTACT_542714].  
Serious AEs occurring after the study Follow -up Period should be reported if in the judgment 
of the Investigator there is “a reasonable possibility ” that the event may have been ca used by 
[CONTACT_77425].  
SAEs should also be reported to the IRB/EC according to local regulations.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 52 of 68 9.8.1 Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from Baseline to Week 8 in the HAMD -17 total 
score. The primary analysis will be based on the F AS. 
The null and alternative hypotheses for the primary endpoint are as follows:  
 The null hypothesis  is that the mean change from Baseline to Week 8 in HAMD -17 
total score  is equal to 0 .  
 The alternative hypothesis  is that the mean change from Baseline to Week 8 in 
HAMD -17 total score  is not equal to 0 .  
The HAMD -17 total score will be analyzed using the mixed model repeated measures 
(MMRM). The dependent variable will be the change from Baseline in the HAMD -17 total 
score, and the independent variables wil l include the following: Baseline HAMD -17 total 
score, visit (Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8), and Baseline HAMD -[ADDRESS_708214] will also be estimated at each of the other time points (Weeks 2, 
4, and 6 ) using the same MMRM, and will be considered secondary endpoints.  
In addition, a paired t -test using a last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation 
method will b e performed at each post -baseline visit.  
9.8.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will include the following:  
 CGI-Improvement (CGI -I) 
 Change from Baseline in CGI -Severity (CGI -S) 
 Change from Baseline in Scale of Outcomes in PD -Sleep Scale ( SCOPA) night time 
sleep score  
 Change from Baseline in SCOPA day time sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_521579]  
 Proportion of responders (defined  as ≥50% reduction from Baseline in HAMD -17 total 
score)  
 Change from Baseline in EuroQOL -5 dimensions -5 levels (EQ -5D-5L) 
All continuous secondary efficacy endpoints (CGI -I, CGI -S, SCOPA, and E Q-5D-5L) will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_2712]. Continuous secondary efficacy

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 Date: 8 January  2019 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 53 of 68 endpoints will be analyzed using similar MMRM models as for the primary efficacy 
endpoint, except that the Baseline value of the endpoint being analyzed will be included as a 
covariate, and in the Baseline score -by-visit interaction term, instead of the HAMD -17 total 
score.  
In the case of CGI -I, it will be analyzed using an MMRM model with CGI -I score  (rather 
than the change from Baseline) as the dependent variable, and with independent variables of 
Baseline CGI -S score, visit, and Baseline CGI -S score -by-visit interaction.  
For the HAMD -17 responder endpoint  (≥50% reduction from Baseline in HAMD -17 tot al 
score), the proportion of responders will be summarized by [CONTACT_765], including 95% confidence 
intervals . Observed cases (subjects with missing values at a given visit are excluded) as well 
as missing values imputed as non -responders will be presented.  
For the EQ -5D-5L endpoint, the dependent variable will be the score from the EQ visual 
analogue scale.  Additionally, for each EQ -5D dimension, the number and percentage of 
patients reporting no, slight, moderate, severe, or extreme problems will be summarized at 
each timepoint.  
In addition, for each of the continuous secondary efficacy endpoints, a paired t -test using a 
last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation method will be performed at each post -
baseline visit.  
9.9 Safety Analyses  
All safety endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics. UPDRS Part III and 
MMSE will be analyzed using similar MMRM models as for the primary efficacy endpoint, 
except that the Baseline value of the endpoint being analyzed (either UPDRS Part III or 
MMSE) will be included as a covariate, and in the Baseline score -by-visit interaction term, 
instead of the HAMD -[ADDRESS_708215]-treatment medications will be summarized separately. 
Medications will be coded using the World Health Organization ( WHO ) Drug Dictionary 
(2016 March or newer version). The number and percentage of subjects taking each drug

the SAP.  
9.9.4 Vital Signs and Body Weight  
Vital signs and body weight (including BMI) will be su mmarized at Baseline and each post -
Baseline visit (weight and BMI are only collected at Screening, Baseline, and Week 8/ EOT; 
height is collected only at Baseline). Change from Baseline will also be summarized. The 
number and percentage of subjects with cha nge from Baseline in body weight of 7% or more 
(both increases and decreases) will be presented.  
9.9.5 Electrocardiogram  
ECG parameters at Baseline and at Weeks 2 and 8 will be summarized by [CONTACT_7206]; change 
from Baseline will also be summarized. Additionally,  categorical analyses will be conducted 
on the incidence of subjects with prolonged QTc intervals and changes in QTc intervals in 
accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines and based on the 
FDA E14 Guidance Document. Details w ill be provided in the SAP.  
9.9.6 Physical Examination  
The results of the physical examinations at each visit (Screening and Week 8/EO T) will be 
tabulated.  
9.9.[ADDRESS_708217]-Baseline, including answer of “yes” 
to C-SSRS  questions 4 or 5 , will be tabulated.  
9.9.8 Mini Mental State Examination  
The MMSE total score will be summarized by [CONTACT_7206] (Baseline, Weeks 4 , and 8) using 
descriptive statistics and will be analyzed using similar MMRM models as for the primary 
efficacy endpoint, except that the Baseline value will be included as a covariate, and in the 
Baseline score -by-visit interaction term, instead of the H AMD -17 total score.

10.6 Protocol Exceptions and Deviations  
No prospective entry criteria protocol deviations are allowed; all subjects must meet all 
eligibility criteria in order to participate in the study.  
Protocol waivers for eligibility and use of prohibited medica tion during the study 
(Section  4.5.1 ) will not be granted by [CONTACT_387435]. If, during the 
course of a subject ’s participation in the trial it  is discovered that the subject did not meet all 
eligibility criteria, he or she will be discontinued, unless the discontinuation presents an 
unacceptable medical risk. The justification to allow the subject to continue in the trial will 
be made by [CONTACT_37925], with medical input from the Investigator, and will be documented. If 
allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as a major protocol deviation and not a 
waiver. All follow -up safety assessments must be completed and documented as outline d in 
the protocol (Section  6.3.9 ). The  Investigator must report any protocol deviation to the 
Sponsor and, if required, to the IRB/EC in accordance with local regulations, within 
reasonable time.  
10.7 Protocol Amendments  
Changes to the protocol may be made only by [CONTACT_1034] (with or without consultation with 
the Investigator). All protocol modifications must be submitted to the site IRB/EC in

subject confidentiality is respected.  
The Sponsor ’s or designee ’s monitor is responsible for inspecting the eCRFs at regular 
intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, 
and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical 
research. The monitor should have acc ess to subject medical records and other study -related 
records needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in 
the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  
In accordance with ICH Guidance on GCP and the Sponsor ’s audit plans, a certain 
percentage of sites participating in this study will be audited. These audits may include a 
review of site facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, and laboratories) and rev iew of 
study -related records may occur in order to evaluate the trial conduct and compliance with 
the protocol, ICH Guidance on GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.  
The Sponsor ’s or designee ’s representatives, Regulatory Agency inspectors, and IRB/ EC 
representatives who obtain direct access to source documents should also respect subject 
confidentiality, taking all reasonable precautions in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements to maintain the confidentiality of subjects ’ identities.

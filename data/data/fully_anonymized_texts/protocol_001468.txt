1 Introduction  
1.1 Overview of Neuroendocrine Tumors   
Neur oendocr ine tumors are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms which include carcinoid 
tumors and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.  The majority are characterized by a relatively 
indolent rate of growth and a propensity to produce and secrete a vari ety of hormo nes and  
other vasoactive substances, giving rise to diverse clinical syndromes.  Histologically, 
carcinoid tumors arise from the endocrine (enterochromaffin) cells of the gastrointestinal tract 
and airways.  Carcinoid tumors have distinct featu res dependin g on th eir site of origin.  In the 
1960s, Williams et al classified carcinoid tumors based on embryologic derivation, 
distinguishing between foregut (bronchial, stomach, duodenal), midgut (jejunal, ileal, cecal, 
appendiceal) and hindgut (distal  colon and r ectal) tumors.[ADDRESS_837529] 
metastasized.  
 
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors arise from the islets of Langerhans.  These heterogeneous 
neoplasms can secrete a variety of peptide hormones, including insulin, gastrin, glucagon, and 
vasoactive inte stinal peptide (VIP).[ADDRESS_837530] pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumors are unassociated with a hormonal syndrome, and are termed 
“nonfunctioning.”   
 
Treatment options for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors have evolved in recent years.  
Somatostatin analogs such as octreot ide were ini tially developed to palliate hormonal 
symptoms such as the flushing and diarrhea caused by [CONTACT_628492].[ADDRESS_837531] year , 
results of  a phase III, randomized, placebo -controlled trial were publi shed, demons trating  that 
long-acting octreotide (Sandostatin LAR 30 mg ) significantly prolong ed time to tumor 
progression among patients with metastatic midgut carinoid tumors.[ADDRESS_837532] of care.  Sunitinib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor, has recently 
been demonstrated to prolong progression -free survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic 
neuroen docrine tumo rs. Eve rolimus, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
has shown promise in several phase II studies.6  Results of randomized, placebo -controlled 
phase III studies are pending.  Bevacizumab,  an inhibito r of circulating vascular -endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) is also being tested in phase III studies based on encouraging phase II

evidence.  Cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to produce high response rates in metastatic 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors7; however responses in carcinoid tumors have been 
discouraging.  
 
Among the various emerging treatments, somatostatin analogs appear to be associated with 
the most favorable side effect profile and ease of ad ministration .  Their convenient mode of 
administration and tolerability are particularly important in patients with metastatic 
neuroendocrine tumors who often remain on treatment for many years.   
 
1.2 Somatostatin analogs in the treatment of patients with 
Neuroendocrine Carcinomas 
 
The human hormone somatostatin was initially identified as a hypothalamic inhibitor of 
growth hormone.8 It was subse quently  discovered to be a universal endocrine “off switch” due 
to its exocrine, endocrine, paracrine and autocrine inhibitory effects.[ADDRESS_837533], it 
reduces secretion and motility, decreases portal blood flow, and reduces the secretio n of other 
gastrointestinal hormones.  The effects of somatostatin are mediated through interaction with 
five somatostatin receptors (sst 1-5), belonging to a family of G -protein coupled receptors with 
seven transmembrane domains.10   
 
The clinical use of native human somatostatin is limited by [CONTACT_628493]. In order to improve the pharmacokinetic profile, synthetic somatostatin analogs 
(SSAs) have been developed by [CONTACT_628494] w hile retaining binding 
affinity to somatostatin receptors.11  The two commercially available analogs, octreotide and 
lanreotide, are octapept ides that bi nd with high affinity to somatostatin receptor 2 (sst 2) and 
with moderate affinity to sst 5.  
 
Octreotide has been used in clincial practice since the 1980s when it was shown to effectively 
palliate the carcinoid syndrome, as well as other syndr omes caused by [CONTACT_628495].  Octreotide was initially 
available in an immediate -release subcutaenous formulation.  During the past decade, a long -
acting repeatable (LAR) depot formulation of octreotid e (Sandostat in LAR)  has been 
available allowing for monthly intramuscular dosing.[ADDRESS_837534] year, results of a phase III 
randomized, placebo -controlled study, the PROMID trial, were pu blished.  In  this trial, 85 
patients with well -differentiated carcinoid tumors originating in the distal intestine and 
proximal colon (midgut) were randomized to receive either octreotide LAR 30 mg or placebo.  
Median progression -free survival was 14.3 mon ths in the o ctreotide LAR group versus 6.0 
months in the placebo group (p=0.000072), confirming the antiproliferative effect of 
octreotide in this patient population.5

Pasireotide (SOM230) is a novel somatostati n analog wit h a sim ilar binding affinity to 
somatostatin sst 2 and substantially stronger binding affinities to ssts 1, 3 and 5  (see section 
1.3).[ADDRESS_837535] 
and induction of apoptosis.14  Thus, we hypothesize that pasireotide LAR may prove to be a 
more potent inhibitor of neuroendocrine tumor proliferation than octreotide LAR.  
 
1.3 Pasireotide (SOM230 ) 
 
Pasireotide is an injectable somatostatin analogue. It is a novel cyclohexapeptide with the 
following c hemical name: (2 -Aminoethyl)carbamic acid (2R,5S,8S,11S,14R,17S,19aS) -11-
(4-aminobutyl) -5-benzyl -8-(4-benzyloxybenzyl) -14-(1H-indol -3-ylmethyl) -4,7,10 ,13,16,19 -
hexaoxo -17-phenyloctadecahydro -3a,6,9,12,15,18 -hexaazacyclopentacyclooctadecen -2-yl 
ester, di[(S) -2-aminosuccinic acid] salt.   
Like natural somatostatin and other somatostatin analogues (SSAs), pasireotide exerts its 
pharmacol ogical activ ity via  binding to somatostatin receptors (ssts). There are five known 
somatostatin receptors: ssts 1-5. Somatostatin receptors are expressed in different tissues under 
normal physiological conditions. Somatostatin analogues activate these recep tors with 
different  potencies15 and this activation results in a reduced cellular activity and inhibition of 
hormone secretion. Somatostatin receptors are strongly expressed in many  solid tumor s, 
especially in neuroendocrine tumors. The SSAs currently approved for use in the clinic 
(octreotide and lanreotide) have a high affinity to the sst2, with moderate or no affinity to the 
remaining subtypes. Pasireotide is a novel cyclohexapept ide somatost atin an alogue that 
exhibits a unique binding profile, binding with high affinity to four of the five known human 
somatostatin receptors. (Table 1.1). Compared to Sandostatin® (octreotide acetate), 
pasireotide exhibits a binding affinity which i s 30-[ADDRESS_837536] 2. A detailed summary of 
available preclinical data is provided in the Investigators' Brochure.

1.4 Clinical experience with pasireotide  
Pasireotide is available as a short -acting subcutaneous  (s.c) formu lation and a long acting 
release (LAR) intramuscular (IM) formulation.   
1.4.1  Pasireotide s.c. 
Pasireotide when given subcutaneously (s.c.) was well -tolerated at doses up to 600 µg b.i.d., 
900 µg b.i.d. and 1200 µg b.i.d by [CONTACT_628496], Cushing’s di sease and ca rcinoid  tumor 
patients, respectively. In addition, healthy volunteers have received pasireotide s.c. as a 
continuous infusion for seven days with total daily doses of up to [ADDRESS_837539] frequently r eported adve rse eve nts were gastrointestinal, 
predominantly diarrhea, nausea and abdominal pain. Generally these events were mild, 
transient and only occasionally caused patients to discontinue treatment.  
Hyperglycemia was also observed for patients in all  three indic ations.  In general HbA1c was 
observed to increase by [CONTACT_3450] 1%, corresponding to a blood glucose increase of 
approximately 30 mg/dL. Blood glucose increases tended to occur with increasing dose, and 
appeared to be more notable in patient s who had a history  of hyperglycemia or diabetes 
mellitus prior to receiving pasireotide. However hyperglycemia in these patients was 
responsive to appropriate diabetic management such as adjustments in oral antidiabetic 
treatment, or in some cases the add ition of ins ulin. 
Occasionally laboratory abnormalities in liver function tests and pancreatic enzymes have 
been observed at higher doses of pasireotide. These events however have been transient.  
Further details on pasireotide s.c. can be found in the Inve stigator Bro chure. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase II studies of pasireotide s.c. in neuroendocrine tumors  
Preliminary safety data are available from a Phase II study [CSOM230B2202] in [ADDRESS_837540] after 
approximately 6 months. There was no apparent relationship between the weight loss and 
pasireotide dose.  
Preliminary efficacy data from this study also support that pasireotide is active in patients 
refractory/resistan t to Sandost atin LA R, as partial or complete symptom control was observed 
in 12 of 44 patients (27%). Complete symptomatic response was achieved in two patients at 
the pasireotide 600 µg s.c. b.i.d. dose and one at the 900 µg s.c. b.i.d. dose. Nine patient s 
achieved p artial symptomatic response to treatment, three at each of the following doses: 600, 
750, 900 µg s.c. b.i.d.

1.4.[ADDRESS_837541] of the experience with pasireotide comes from healthy volunteer and patient studies 
evaluating the subcutaneous f ormulation o f pasir eotide.  Pasireotide LAR is being evaluated 
in two studies, one healthy volunteer study and one study involving patients with acromegaly 
and carcinoid disease.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pasireotide LAR in healthy volunteers  
Preliminary data from the healthy volun teer study f ound si ngle IM doses of pasireotide LAR, 
at doses of up to [ADDRESS_837542] of the subjects and 
was sometimes associated  with abdomi nal pain, flatulence, and/or nausea.  The 
gastrointestinal events were mild or moderate in severity.  About 38% of subjects reported 
mild injection site pain and about 15% reported headaches.  
Transient elevations in liver function tests and/or pancreatic e nzymes were observed in two 
subjects, both of which resolved and were not accompanied by [CONTACT_628497].  Mild 
increases in fasting blood glucose were observed in some subjects during the pasireotide LAR 
treatment period.  All elevations  were asympt omatic, considered not clinically significant and 
generally returned to normal within 3 to 4 weeks after the pasireotide LAR IM injection.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pasireotide LAR in acromegalic patients  
Preliminary safety data are available from 18 acromegalic patien ts treated w ith pas ireotide 
LAR in an ongoing study [CSOM230C2110]. These patients had received pasireotide LAR at 
doses of 20 (n=5), 40 (n=6) or 60 mg (n=7) for about six weeks at the time of the summary.  
Pasireotide LAR was well -tolerated by [CONTACT_628498]. The most common 
drug-related adverse events were gastrointestinal, predominantly diarrhea. Mild erythema 
reported as drug -related was experienced by [CONTACT_628499]. Two patients on the 60 mg dose 
were reported to experience drug -related increa ses in blood glucose: mild diabetes mellitus 
was reported for one patient and mild hyperglycemia was reported for the other patient who 
also had a history of diabetes mellitus at baseline. A further patient who received the 20 mg 
dose experienc ed hyperglyc emia, however this event was considered to be unrelated to study 
drug by [CONTACT_093]. All three patients were given oral hypoglycemic agents and all 
continued in the trial.  
Following 2 -3 injections of pasireotide LAR in acromegaly patient s [CSOM230C2 110], 
steady -state concentrations of pasireotide were achieved.  The trough plasma concentrations 
of pasireotide at steady state (C min.ss) on day 84 were 3.8 ± 2.1, 5.6 ± 2.4, and 13.8 ± 10.2 
ng/mL for 20 mg (N=9), 40 mg (N=9), and 60 mg (N=11)  LAR, respec tively,  indicating an   
approximate dose proportionality.  
   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pasireotide LAR in carcinoid patients  
Preliminary safety data are available from nine carcinoid patients treated with pasireotide 
LAR in an ongoing study [CSOM230C2110]. These patient s had receiv ed pasireotide LAR at 
 Confidential  Page 11 
Oncology C linical Trial Protocol (Version No. 13)  Protocol No. CSOM23DCUS23T  
 
doses of 20 (n=1), 40 (n=4) or 60 mg (n=4) for about six weeks at the time of the summary. 
Pasireotide LAR was well -tolerated by [CONTACT_628500]. Six out of nine treated patients 
reported at least one AE and the most co mmonly repor ted AEs  were gastrointestinal.  
However, most of these events were considered unrelated to study drug.  Two patients 
reported hyperglycemia judged as related to study drug, one was mild and one moderate.  The 
patient who experienced moderate hy perglycemia had a p ast history of diabetes mellitus at 
entry to the study and died due to carcinoid tumor progression.  
Although pasireotide exposures appear to be higher in patients than in healthy volunteers, the 
data from studies assessing the subcutaneo us formulati on of pasireotide support that 
pasireotide LAR at doses of 60 mg and below are expected to be well -tolerated by [CONTACT_1962].  A 
healthy volunteer study of pasireotide s.c. by [CONTACT_628501] 2,025 
mcg per day [SOM230B2108 ].  The dose  of 2,025 mcg by s.c. infusion per day was well -
tolerated and is equivalent to a dose of 56.7 mg from a single 28 day IM depot injection of 
pasireotide LAR.  Data resulting from studies [SOM230B2108] and [SOM230B2202] are 
described fully in the  Pasireotide  s.c Investigator’s Brochure.  
The effects of high doses of pasireotide on cardiac repolarization in healthy volunteers was 
tested in study CSOM230B2113.  The dose of s.c pasireotide selected was 1950mcg bid. This 
dose was compared to moxifloxac in and place bo.  The results of the study suggested the 
presence of an effect of pasireotide on QTcF intervals due to the fact that the upper bound of 
the 95% one -side CI for the difference from placebo was greater than 10ms at [ADDRESS_837543] profile of pasireotide LAR, its enhanced affinity for 
somatostatin receptors compared to octreotide LAR, and its putative antiproliferative effects 
in patients with neuroendocrine tumors, we propose a phase II study investigat ing pasireot ide 
LAR  in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.  Unlike prior studies focusing on 
palliation of hormonal symptoms, the primary goal of this study is to assess radiologic 
progression -free survival (PFS).  
 
2 Study objectives  
The primary purpose of t he study is to investigate the progression -free survival associated 
with pasireotide LAR in treatment -naïve patients with metastatic carcinoid and pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumors.  
Secondary objectives are to assess the overall survival (OS) as sociated wit h pasir eotide LAR, 
overall radiographic response rate (ORR), adverse events (AEs), changes in tumor markers 
and changes in quality of life (QOL).  
2.[ADDRESS_837544] profile of pasireotide LAR at doses of 60mg every 4 week s 
(see section [IP_ADDRESS]) and pharmacokinetic data demonstrating ther apeutic drug levels at that 
level , the dose of pasireotide in this study will be 60mg IM every 4 weeks.  No doses of 
pasireotide LAR exceeding 60mg will be tested in this trial.   If tolerab ility issues occur, the 
treatment dose may be reduced to 40mg.

This is a multi -institutional, prosp ective phase I I open -label  trial.  
4.1 Treatment  
The investigational drug used in this study is pasireotide LAR 60mg.  Pasireotide will be 
administered as an intramuscular injection at the beginning of every cycle which is defined as 
28 days (+/ - 3 days).  Study treatment s hould begin within 14 days following enroll ment into 
the study and continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdraw al of 
consent.   Safety and efficacy will be assessed throughout the treatment period.    
 
4.1.1  Rescue treatment for diarrhea and other breakthro ugh hormonal 
symptoms  
 
Patients with hormonal symptoms caused by [CONTACT_152420] (such as the carcinoid 
syndrome) may experience symptom flares requiring short -acting rescue medications.  For 
these patients, short -acting pasireotid e sc may be prescri bed at the discretion of the 
investigator at a dose of 600 mcg bid prn.  Patients who continue to experience 
breakthrough diarrhea due to carcinoid syndrome or other hormonal syndromes may use 
antidiarrheal medications such as loperamide  or diphenox ylate and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  SOM230 may

6.3.1  Management Guidelines for Hyperglycemia  
 
During the stu dy, all patients with HbA1c ≥ 7 % and or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > 130 
mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L), should be considered for the following:  
 
• Provided information and receive teaching on diabetes disease management  
• Initiation of drug therapy with anti -hyperglyc emic medications  
• Refer ral to a diabetes specialist for evaluation and appropriate management  
• Monitoring of blood glucose by [CONTACT_569226] (fasting morning blood glucose 
and [ADDRESS_837559] -meal) if not already done. Patients, who monitor blood glucos e should 
keep a diary of their glucose values and present the collected data to their physician/ 
diabetes specialist for evaluation and appropriate management.  
 
6.3.2  Management Guidelines for QTc prolongation on ECG  
 
Table 6 -3-2 provides guidelines for manageme nt of prolonged QTc in terval. 
 
Table 6 -3-2 Guidelines for Management of QTc Prolongation  
 
QTc CTC grade 1 ( ≤ 480 msec)  No study drug adjustments  
QTc CTC grade 2 (> 4 80 or ≤ 500 msec) 
either drug related or drug unrelated  Patient is to be referred to a car diologist for evaluati on and 
appropriate management, and the patient can remain in the study  
Patient’s study drug dose will be reduced to 40 mg.  
QTc CTC grade ≥ 3 (> 500 msec) , or 
increase in QTcF ≥60ms over baseline  Discontinue study drug

  6.3.3    Management Guidelines for Abnormal Liver Function  
 
Table 6-3-3: SOM230 Abnormal liver function management  
Perform within 72 hours of awareness of abnormal LFTs:  
 Perform liver -directed medical history and physical examination (i .e. assess occupationa l hazards, concomitant 
medications including OTC meds, intercurrent illness, etc)  
 Liver chemistry tests: ALT, AST, total bilirubin, (fractionate to direct/indirect bilirubin if total bilirubin is > 2.0x ULN) , Alb, 
PT (INR), ALP, an d GGT  
 Perform hepat itis screen: anti -HAV, IgM (to confirm acute hepatitis A), HbsAg, Anti -HBc, anti -HCV (if positive PCR viral 
load should be assessed), Anti -HEV, ANA antibodies, anti -smooth muscle anti -bodies, CMV, EBV  
 Perform abdominal ultrasound ( liver and biliary tree )  
 Collect PK sample and record the dose level and the dosing time for the last dose the patient has taken prior to PK 
sampling.  
 
 Confidential  Page 18 
Oncology C linical Trial Protocol (Version No. 13)  Protocol No. CSOM23DCUS23T  
 
Liver chemistry tests should be monitored every [ADDRESS_837560] > 5x ULN and ≤ 8x ULN:  
o Study medication should be temporarily interrupted and liver chemistry tests monitored every [ADDRESS_837561] anytime after stu dy drug is resumed, th en study drug should be discontinued 
immediately.  
 
 
Table 6-3-3-1: SOM230 Abnormal liver function discontinuation criteria 
Hepatic -related discontinuation criteria for all ongoing studies  
Study medication should be discontinued imm ediately if any of the  discontinuation criteria below are 
met:  
 ALT or AST > 3x ULN and Total Bilirubin > 2x ULN and ALP < 2x ULN  
 ALT or AST > 5x ULN and ≤ 8x ULN persistent for more than [ADDRESS_837562] > 8x ULN  
 
Re-challenge of study medicati on is prohibited once discontinuation criteria are met.  
 
 
6.3.4    Concomitant therapy  
Patients will be instructed not to take any additional medications (including over -the-counter 
products) during the course of the study without prior consultation wit h the investigator. At  
each visit, the investigator will ask the patient about any new medications he/she is or has 
taken after the start of the study drug.  
All Concomitant medications/Significant non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_32546] ≤ 30 days prior to start and 
after start of study drug, in cluding physical therapy and blood transfusions, should be 
recorded.  
The use of concomitant medications that might lead to QT prolongation (appendix A) is 
prohibited and requires the discontinuation  of the patient prior to starting the respective QT 
prolonging medication.  
Pasireotide is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 and 2D6.  Substrat es of CYP2C9 and 2D6 
(appendix D ) with a narrow therapeutic index should be used with caution.  Patients on 
Warfarin should have their INR monitored more closely while receiving SOM230.  
 
     6.3.5    Study drug discontinuation  
Patients experiencing unacceptable toxicity (AE grade 3 or higher) that the investigator 
considers directly attributable to the study drug should  have their dose adjusted as per dose 
modification guidelines in  Table 6 -2. If a patient has already decreased 1 dose level, no 
further dose reduction is permitted, and the patient will be permanently discontinued from 
treatment.  For QTc related protocol discontinuation, please see section 6.3.2.   For LFT 
related protocol discontinuation, see section 6.3.3.

questionnair es); scans will occur  once ever y [ADDRESS_837571] documented disease progression (by [CONTACT_102675] ) or death due to any cause.  If a patien t has not progressed or died  at the date of the 
analysis cut -off or when he/she receives any further anti -cancer therapy, PFS is censored at 
the time of the last tumor assessment before the cut -off or the anti -cance r therapy date.  
  
8.[ADDRESS_837572] Criteria for res ponse  
The Response Evaluatio n Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST  1.0) guidelines will be employed 
in this study.  For the purposes of this study, target lesions are defined as metastatic lesions 
that are bidirectional ly measurable with one diameter measuring  at least 2 cm (or [ADDRESS_837573] scan).  All lesions up to a maximum of 10 lesions representative of all involved 
organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the b asis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) 
and their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (either by [CONTACT_15078]).  A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesi ons will be calculated and 
reported as th e baseline sum LD.  The base line sum LD will be used as reference to further 
characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Measurable disease:  lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longe st 
diameter to be recorded) as > 2 cm with conventional techniques or as > [ADDRESS_837574] 
scan.  
 
Non-measurable disease:  all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 2 cm 
with conventional tec hniques or < [ADDRESS_837575] scan).  
 
 Confidential  Page 24 
Oncology C linical Trial Protocol (Version No. 13)  Protocol No. CSOM23DCUS23T  
 
Complete response (CR):  comp lete disappearance of all target lesions, confirmed by [CONTACT_89422] [ADDRESS_837576] met.  
 
Partial response (PR):  at least a 30% dec rease in the sum of the longest diameter of target 
lesions, taking as  reference the baseline sum longest diameter. This must be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_89423] [ADDRESS_837577] met.  
 
Progressive disease (PD) : at least a 20% increase in the sum of th e longest diameter of target  
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment 
started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : neither sufficient  decrease to qualify for partial response  nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest 
diameter since the treatment started.  
 
Non-target Lesions : all other lesions (or sites of disease) not includ ed in the “target disease” 
definition sho uld be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as “present” or “absent”.  
 
Complete Response :  Disappearance of al l non-target lesions.  
 
Non-complete respo nse/Non -progression :  Persis tence of one or more non -target lesions.  
 
Progression :  Appearance of one or more new lesions.  Unequivocal progression of existing 
non-target lesions.  
 
Cytology and Histology : if the mea surable disease is restricted to a solita ry lesion, its 
neoplastic na ture should ideally be confirmed by [CONTACT_89424].  These techniques can 
be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases.  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or wo rsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response, stable disease, and progressive disease  
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Re sponse: the best overall response recorde d from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  In general, the patient’s best 
response assignment will depend on the achi evement of both measurement and confirmation 
criteria.

Note:   
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be  reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration”.   Every effort should be mad e to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
 
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When the e valuation of complete response depends up on this determination, it is  
recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before 
confirming the complete response status.  
 
8.2 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
Clini cal Lesions :  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable whe n they are 
superficial (e.g. skin nodules, palpable lymph nodes).  For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is  
recommended.  
 
CT scan :  Conventional CT scan should be performed wit h cuts of 10mm or less in slice 
thickness contiguously.  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_628486] a 5mm contiguous 
reconstruction algorithm.   
 
8.3 Confirmation Measurement/Duration of Respon se 
 
Confirmation : To be assigned a status  of PR or CR, changes in tum or measurements must be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_89425] [ADDRESS_837579] o nce after study entry at a m inimum interval of 6 weeks.  
 
 Confidential  Page 26 
Oncology C linical Trial Protocol (Version No. 13)  Protocol No. CSOM23DCUS23T  
 
Duration of Overall Response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded)  until the first date that 
recurrent or p rogressive disease is object ively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall complete response is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first m et for CR until the first da te that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
 
Duration of Stable Disease : Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, ta king as reference the smallest measuremen ts recorded since 
the treatm ent started.  
 
Progression Free Survival (PFS) : PFS is defined as the time from the date of first study 
treatment to the date of the first documented disease progression or death due to an y cause.  If 
a patient has not progressed  or died at the date of the analysis cut -off or when he/she receives 
any further anti -cancer therapy, PFS is censored at the time of the last tumor assessment 
before the cut -off or the anti -cancer therapy date.

adverse events, the regular monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry parameters and 
regular physical examinations.  Adverse event s will be evaluated continuously througho ut the

An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or 
medical condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to 
be related to study drug. Medical conditi ons/diseases present before starting study drug are 
only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study drug. Abnormal laboratory

values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce c linical signs or symptoms, 
are considered  clinically significant, or require therapy.  
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by [CONTACT_105] -directive questioning of the patient 
at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when the y are volunteered 
by [CONTACT_286585] o r between visits or through physical examination, laboratory test, or 
other assessments. As far as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine:  
1. the severity grade (mild, moderate, severe) or (grade  1-4) 
2. its relationship to the study drug( s) (suspected/not suspected)  
3. its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam)  
4. action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study 
drug permanently discontinued d ue to this adverse event; concomitant med ication taken; 
non-drug ther apy given; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  
5. whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE)  
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include c hanges in 
study drug treatment including possible interruption or dis continuation, starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_89392], changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
any other medically required intervention. Once an advers e event is detected, it should be 
followe d until its resolution, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, 
if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the 
interventions required to treat it , and the outcome.  
Information about comm on side effects already know n about the investigational drug can be 
found in the Investigators’ Brochure  or will be communicated between IB updates in the form 
of Investigator Notifications. This information will be  included in the patient informed 
consent  and should be discussed wit h the patient during the study as needed.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_837583] also be reported to Recordati Inc.  within 24 hours of 
learning of its occurrence. A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical 
condition which:  
• is fatal or life -threatening  
• results in persistent or significant disa bility/inc apaci ty 
• constitutes a congenital anomaly/birt h defect

adverse events  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16884] t he obligation to r eport all s erious adverse events to the FDA, 
IRB, a nd Recordati Inc.  Pharmaceuticals Integrated Medical Safety (IMS).  
All events reported to the FDA by [CONTACT_109] 
3500A (MedWatch Form).   
All events must be repor ted, by [CONTACT_46465] (888 -299-4565), to Recordati Inc.  Pharmaceuticals I MS 
Department within 24 hour s of learning of its occurrence. This includes serious, related, 
labeled (expected) and serious, related, unlabeled (unexpected) a dverse experiences, all deaths 
during treatment or within [ADDRESS_837584] medical treat ment given to a 
patient (e.g. treatment withdrawal during washout period, change in treatment to a fixed dose 
of concomitant medic ation).  
Serious adverse events occu rring more than 4 weeks  after study discontinuation need only b e 
reported if a relationship  to the Recordati Inc.  study drug (or therapy) is suspected.  
For Comparator Drugs/Secondary Suspects (Concomitant Medica tions), all serious adverse 
experiences will  be forwarded to the product manufacturer by [CONTACT_093].  
9.1.[ADDRESS_837585]  
The particip ating investigator will report all adver se events and serious advers e events to the

Investigators must ente r the information required by [CONTACT_628504].  
[ADDRESS_837587] a single-arm phase II trial, with the 12 -month progression -free survival  
rate as the primary endpoint, and us ing a one -sided alpha level of 10%.   
 
The null hypothesis is t hat PFS rate at 12 months will be 19%. With n= 30 (plus up to 3 
additional patients (10%)  to account for early dropouts) , we will  have 90% power to reject th e 
null, if the true 1 -year PFS rate from this treatment regimen is 40% (these PFS rates 
correspond t o null and alternative hypothesis median PFS of 5 and 9 months, respectively).   
The samp le size calculations were conducted usin g nQuery Advisor 6.01.  
 
The sample size was derived for the estimation of PFS at [ADDRESS_837588] for the  exponentiality of the survi val distribution using the 
Hollander=Proschan17 test.  If the p -value for this preliminary test is g reater than 0.20, we will 
provide the 90% lower confi dence bound assuming an exponential  distribution.  
 
11.3 Subset analyses  
 
Neuroen docrine tumors are character ized by a heterogeneous rate of growth. Tumors 
originating in the distal small intestine and proxima l colon (midgut carcinoid tumors) are 
characterized b y a slower rate of metastatic growt h than neuroendocrine tumors of other si tes, 
including the lungs, st omach, pancreas and rectum.  Therefore, a post -study subset analysis 
will evaluate PFS data based on  site of primary tumor, distinguishing between two su bsets:  
 
Subset 1: Patients with neu roendocrine tumors of the distal small i ntestine and cecum (midgut 
carcinoids).  Patients with mesenteric masses whose primary tumors are unidentified will be 
considere d to have midgut carcinoid tumors.  
 
Subset 2: Patient s with advanced (metastatic or unre sectable) neuroendocrine tumors of other  
primary sites (lung, stomac h, duodenum, distal colon, rectum, pancreas) or unknown primary 
site. 
 
 Confidential  Page 31 
Oncology C linical Trial Protocol (Version No. 13)  Protocol No. CSOM23DCUS23T  
 
Other subset analyses will di stinguish patients with low -grade (grade 1) tumors ve rsus 
intermediate grade (grade 2) t umors, and patients with low hepatic tum or burden (<10%) 
versus high  hepatic tumor burden (>10%).  
12 Exploratory Analysis  
 
If available, archival tissue containing a tumor  block (preferred) or 10 unstained slides ( 3-5 
micron  thick ) representing biopsies from patient’s primary or metastatic neuroend ocrine 
tumor should be sent to Moffitt Cancer Center for correlative immunohistochemical studies.  
Specimens should be placed in  a secure, airtight container, labeled with th e patie nt name [CONTACT_628512].

Immunohistochemistry  (IHC) will be used to evaluate the expression of somat ostatin 
receptors (SSTs 1-5).   Sections of 3 -4 microns in thickness will be cut from the selected 
formalin -fixed paraffin embed ded tissue and subjected to IHC staining protocol usi ng the 
Dakocytomation Autostainer ( DakoCytomation, Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_461999], Calif).  Mi crowave antigen 
retrieval wi th IHC Select EDTA buffer, pH 7.5, will be utilized.  Rabbitt polyclonal primary 
antibodies against SST 1-[ADDRESS_837590] subtypes will be scored as either 0 (negative ), 1+ 
(mild positive staining), 2+ (moderate positive ) and 3+ (strong positive staining) .  The 
correlation between SST staining patterns and clinical outcom es (PFS) will be analyzed in a 
descriptive fashion.  
 
We will also explore the correlation between ea rly biochemical response and PFS.  Early 
biochemical responders will be defined as patie nts with elevated chromogranin A (CgA) w ho 
experience a major reduct ion (>50%) or normalization of their CgA between their baseline 
(pretreatment) measurement and their  follow -up assessment 3 months later.   
13 Quality of Li fe Assessment  
 
 
Patient quality of life will be measured using the EORTC QL Q-C30 (version 3) and the 
EORTC QLQ GI.NET21 questionnaires (appendices  B and C ).  The  EORTC QLQ -C30 
questionnaire  is designed t o assess the health -related quality of life of cancer  patients 
participating in clinical  trials.  It is composed of 5 functional  scales, three symptom scale s, a 
global health status scale, and six single items.  The EORTC QLQ GI.NET21 questionnaire is 
 Confidential  Page 32 
Oncology C linical Trial Protocol (Version No. 13)  Protocol No. CSOM23DCUS23T  
 
designed to assess physical and psychological symptoms re lated to neuroendocrine tumors of 
the gastrointestinal tract.  
Both question naire s will be scored and ha ndled as recommended in the user manual.  Missing 
items will be imputed with the mean of the non -missing items scored at that assessment time 
point.  Amb iguous items will be considered as missing items.  At each assessment time point, 
summary statistics of  the raw score and linear transformation score (on a 0 -100 scale) will be 
provided.

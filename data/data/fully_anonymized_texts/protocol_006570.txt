 6 STUDY SYNOPSIS  
 
Title:  
Diarrhea prevention and prophylaxis with crofelemer in HER2 positive breast cancer patients 
receiving trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel or paclitaxel with or without carboplatin: 
HALT -D 
 
Investigat ors:  
Sponsor: Sandra M. Swain, MD, FACP, FASCO  
 
Study Center(s):   
This study will be open at multiple sites in the [LOCATION_002].  
 
Concept and Rationale:   
Chemotherapy induced diarrhea (CID) occurs in 40 -80% of breast cancer patients who receive 
HER2 di rected therapy with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and a taxane, with most patients 
experiencing grade 1 -2 diarrhea. In the CLEOPATRA trial, in which patients received a median 
of 8 cycles of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel, 67% had all grade diarrhea and  8% 
experienced grade 3 diarrhea. Patients on the TRYPHAENA trial received 6 cycles of 
neoadjuvant trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel, with 72.4% of patients experiencing all 
grade diarrhea and 11.8% experiencing grade 3 diarrhea; the results were simi lar in the patients 
who also received carboplatin.  In a phase 2 trial of trastuzumab and pertuzumab with weekly 
paclitaxel, in which patients received a median of 10 cycles of treatment, 81% of patients had all 
grade and 3% had grade [ADDRESS_995447] a patient’s quality of life. Various anti -diarrheal agents, 
including loperamide, codeine, octreotide, non -absorbed steroids, atropi [INVESTIGATOR_050], antibiotics, opi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], 
bismuth, probiotics, and bile acid sequestrants, are available for symptom management.  Of 
these, loperamide is most commonly used and recommended as a first line agent in the 
treatment setting.  Octreotide is generally reserved for  refractory diarrhea due to its cost and 
requirement for subcutaneous dosing. However, none of these target the underlying mechanism 
of CID.   
 
Chloride ions and channels play a large role in the underlying mechanism of secretory diarrhea. 
In the luminal s ide of the colon, chloride efflux is mediated via api[INVESTIGATOR_728915], of which 
there are three types: 1) cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), a cyclic AMP 
stimulated chloride channel; 2) calcium activated chloride channel (CaCC); and 3) ch loride 
channel type 2 (ClC2).  Various studies have looked at the role of epi[INVESTIGATOR_242873] (EGFR) targets and the mechanism of diarrhea. These studies have suggested that 
blocking EGFR can cause excess chloride secretion, resulting in impai red gut absorption and a 
resulting secretory diarrhea.  
 
Crofelemer is an extract from the blood red bark of Croton lechleri that inhibits luminal chloride 
efflux by [CONTACT_728964], the calcium activated 
chloride channel (CaCC) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). Due to its 
size and polarity, it acts only luminally and is not systemically absorbed.   
 
In a phase 3 randomized controlled double blinded trial, investigators looked at 376 HIV  patients 
with diarrhea for > [ADDRESS_995448] part of the study established the optimal dose of 
crofelemer at 125 mg twice a day, which resulted in a 21% reduction in stool frequency. The

 7 second part of the study compared crofelemer to placebo with a pr imary endpoint of ≤ 2 watery 
stools per week. They noted a statistically significant higher response rate of 1 8% for patients 
on crofelemer versus 8% for those on placebo. When patients initially on placebo crossed over 
to the crofelemer arm, 36% met the c riterion of response. Possible s ide effects included 
dyspepsia, flatulence, constipation, nausea, and increased alanine transferase .  Based on this 
study, crofelemer was approved by [CONTACT_34033] 2012 for secretory diarrhea in patients with 
HIV/AIDS receiving  anti-retroviral therapy.  
We propose a trial of crofelemer versus standard of care (no anti -diarrheal prophylaxis) for 
prevention of CID in HER2 positive breast cancer patients on trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and 
docetaxel or paclitaxel with or without carbop latin.  We hypothesize that crofelemer, which 
targets two of the chloride channels responsible for secretory diarrhea, will be an effective and 
targeted approach to reducing the incidence of CID in this patient population.  
 
Primary Objective(s):   
To deter mine the efficacy of crofelemer in preventing chemotherapy induced diarrhea (CID) in 
patients with HER2 positive breast cancer receiving chemotherapy with trastuzumab, 
pertuzumab, and docetaxel or paclitaxel (THP) or trastuzumab, pertuzumab, carboplatin, a nd 
docetaxel (TCHP).

 10 Study Design:   
This is a randomized, 1:1, stratified, open -label phase II study in patients with HER2 positive 
breast ca ncer receiving THP or TCHP in any setting.    Randomization will be stratified 
according to TCHP with docetaxel vs. THP with paclitaxel vs. THP with docetaxel.  
 
Patients randomized to the treatment group will receive oral crofelemer 125 mg twice daily 
during cycles 1 -2 of THP or TCHP chemotherapy.  The primary endpoint is the total number of 
patients with all grade diarrhea  for two or more consecutive days that is definitely, probably, or 
possibly due to THP or TCHP  during cycles 1 and 2.  All patients will  keep a daily diary of bowel 
movement number and consistency.   
 
Statistical Methods:  
Definition of primary endpoint:  
The primary endpoint is incidence of diarrhea of any grade  for two or more consecutive days  felt 
to be definitely, probably, or possibl y due to THP or TCHP , as assessed by [CONTACT_4652] v4.0, 
during cycle 1 and cycle 2 of chemotherapy. The CTCAE v4.0 coding for diarrhea is 10012727.  
 
Definition of secondary endpoints:  
If possible, the secondary endpoints will be:  
 
 Incidence of diarrhea of an y grade, as measured by [CONTACT_3989] v4.0, by [CONTACT_728971];  
 Incidence of diarrhea of grade 3 -4, as measured by [CONTACT_3989] v4.0, by [CONTACT_728971];  
 Time to onset of first epi[INVESTIGATOR_728918], defined as the number of days from 
day one of THP or TCHP until the day in which the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_728919] [ADDRESS_995452] treatment cycle for patients 
who do not experience diarrhea, overall and by [CONTACT_64264];  
 Duration (days) of any grade  diarrhea, by [CONTACT_728965][INVESTIGATOR_728920];  
 Duration (days) of grade 3 -4 diarrhea , by [CONTACT_728965][INVESTIGATOR_728920];  
 Use of anti -diarrheal medications (other than study drug), by [CONTACT_728972];  
 Quantitative FACIT -D total score, collected day 1 of each cycle and at the time of study 
completion (defined as cycle 4 day 1 , but patients may complete this final FACIT -D 
questionnaire within 5 days of  cycle 4 day 1 ), by [CONTACT_728971];  
 Quantitative FACIT -D diarrhea s ubset (DS) score, collected day 1 of each cycle and at the 
time of study completion (defined as cycle 4 day 1 , but patients may complete this final 
FACIT -D questionnaire within 5 days of  cycle 4 day 1 ), by [CONTACT_728971];  
 Frequency table of stool con sistency, as measured by [CONTACT_728973], by [CONTACT_728974].  
 
Analytic plan for primary objective:   
The number and percent of patients who experience diarrhea of any grade  for two or more 
consecutive days  (felt to be defini tely, probably, or possibly due to THP or TCHP) during cycle 1 
and 2 will be summarized with two -sided 90% confidence interval overall and by [CONTACT_11512], and compared between treatment arms using a Fisher’s exact test.  The analysis 
population is  defined as all randomized patients who complete 2 cycles of THP or TCHP 
chemotherapy.  
 
Analytic plan for secondary objectives:  
We plan on using the following analytic plan for secondary objectives and endpoints, if possible.  
 
According to treatment grou p, for each of the cycles and stratum, we will summarize: 1) the 
MHRI GU IRB# 20 15-0547: HALT -D PROTOCOL                   
June 7 , 2021  
 11 number and percent of patients (and 95% CI) who experience diarrhea of any grade; 2) the 
number and percent of patients (and 95% CI) who experience diarrhea of grade 3 -4; 3) the 
median, range , and interquartile range of the duration of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]; and 4) the number (%) of 
patients requiring anti -diarrheal rescue medication.  
 
The time to onset of first epi[INVESTIGATOR_728921] -Meier 
method, and compared between treatment groups and stratum using log -rank test.  
 
The FACIT -D and FACIT -D DS scores will be summarized descriptively and graphically by 
[CONTACT_5265], treatment assignment, and stratum. The change in FACIT -D and FACIT -D DS scores 
between day 1 of cycles 1 -3 and e nd of study (within 5 days of  cycle 4 day 1 ) will be compared 
at each time point between treatment groups using a Wilcoxon rank sum -test. 
 
The stool consistency, as measured by [CONTACT_728973], will be summarized in frequency 
tables by [CONTACT_728975] a Wilcoxon rank 
sum-test. 
 
Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_24975], grade, and stratum, according to treatment arm.  
 
Sample size justification:   
With a sample size of 46 patients (23 per treatment group) , the study has 81% power to detect a 
40% absolute decrease (from 60% to 20%) in incidence of all grade diarrhea  for two or more 
consecutive days  that is definitely, probably, or possibly due to THP or TCHP during cycles 1 
and 2 of chemotherapy, with a two  sided significance level of 0.10 based on Fisher’s exact test.

 15 2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Normal Intestinal Function   
Approximately 9000 cc of fluid passes through  the human small intestine on a daily basis, a 
combination of ingested fluid (~ 2000 cc), saliva (~ 1500 cc), gastric secretions (~ 2000 cc), 
pancreatic secretions (~ 1500 cc), bile (~ 500 cc), and intestinal secretions (~ 1500 cc).  The 
small intestine re absorbs approximately 90% of this fluid, passing about 1000 cc into the large 
intestine.  The large intestine reabsorbs an additional 90% of fluid, ultimately leaving only 
approximately 100 cc of fluid to be excreted in feces.  A decrease in 1 -2% of intest inal water 
absorption, as little as 50 cc, will increase stool weight to more than 200 g per 24 hours (the 
upper limit of normal) and result in diarrhea.  [1] 
 
2.[ADDRESS_995459] more than 1 month, then 
the diarrhea is considered chronic.  [1-3] 
 
There are many different mechanisms of diarrhea.  Secretory diarrhea is due to decre ased 
reabsorption or increased secretion of fluid and electrolytes within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  
Osmotic diarrhea occurs when osmotically active, poorly absorbed solutes inhibit the 
reabsorption of fluid and electrolytes.  Various forms of colit is, including microscopic, ischemic, 
and autoimmune, can also cause diarrhea due to inflammation and mucosal damage.  If the 
cause of diarrhea is a direct consequence of chemotherapy, then the diarrhea is called 
chemot herapy induced diarrhea (CID). [1-3] 
 
2.3 Diarrhea Grading  
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
Version 4.0 assigns grades to CID depending on the amount of stool produced.  Grade 1 
diarrhea is defined by [CONTACT_728976] 4 stools per day over baseline.  Grade 2 diarrhea 
is an increase of 4 -6 stools per day over baseline, but not interfering with activities of daily living 
(ADLs).  Grade [ADDRESS_995460] ools per day over 
baseline, the presence of incontinence, symptoms that limit self care ADLs, or requirement for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Finally, grade 4 diarrhea is defined as diarrhea that can cause life -threatening 
consequences, warranting urgent medical inte rvention.   
 
2.4 Assessing Quality of Life with Diarrhea  
The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness (FACIT) is a health related quality of life 
questionnaire that focuses on four primary quality of life domains: physical, social/family, 
emotional, and funct ional well -being. FACIT has been validated in all cancers.  A FACIT 
questionnaire for diarrhea (FACIT -D) incorporates the original four quality of life domains and 
includes additional questions addressing how diarrhea affects quality of life.   
 
2.5 Chemothera py Induced Diarrhea: Breast Cancer  
While chemotherapy and targeted therapy can be highly effective in breast cancer, the side 
effects of each can cause significant problems resulting in loss of quality of life, dose reductions, 
and dose delays.  Diarrhea in particular can be seen in 40 - 80% of patients who are on breast 
cancer therapy.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_728925]2 positive breast cancer patients and their diarrhea 
incidences will be discussed below.  
 
2.5.[ADDRESS_995461] Cancer: EGFR Targets  
Human epi[INVESTIGATOR_728926] r receptor 2 (HER2) is a member of the EGFR family.  
Chemotherapy induced diarrhea (CID) occurs in 40 -80% of breast cancer patients who receive 
MHRI GU IRB# 20 15-0547: HALT -D PROTOCOL                   
June [ADDRESS_995462] looked at the  role of EGFR targets and the mechanism of diarrhea.  In the luminal side of 
the colon, chloride efflux is mediated via api[INVESTIGATOR_728915], of which there are three 
types: 1) cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), a cyclic AMP stimulated chl oride 
channel; 2) calcium activated chloride channel (CaCC); and 3) chloride channel type 2 (ClC2).  
These prior studies have suggested that blocking EGFR can cause excess chloride secretion, 
resulting in impaired gut absorption and producing secretory dia rrhea. [4-6] 
 
2.5.[ADDRESS_995463] Cancer: Docetaxel and Paclitaxel  
Docetaxel and paclitaxel are chemotherapy agents in the class of taxanes.  Taxanes stabilize 
tubulin in the microtubules, thus preventing mitosis and halting c ell division.  Both docetaxel and 
paclitaxel are used in the treatment of breast cancer either in combination chemotherapy, as a 
single agent, or with monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab.  Sparano et 
al. showed that docetaxel given eve ry [ADDRESS_995464] disease 
free survival in the adjuvant setting when used with combination chemotherapy.  Diarrhea was 
more frequent in the docetaxel arm, as well as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and infections; 
neuropa thy was higher in the paclitaxel arm.  Thus while both docetaxel and paclitaxel are in the 
same class of medications, their side effect profiles do differ.  [7]     
 
Hainsworth et al. conducted a phase [ADDRESS_995465] cancer patients.  The dose limiting toxicity was 
found to be fatigue and asthenia, particularly at the higher dose levels of 43 mg/m2/wk and 52 
mg/m2/wk.  Other toxi cities noted at these dose levels included skin and nail changes and 
diarrhea.  In a phase [ADDRESS_995466] cancer, Valero et al. reported 31 patients developed neutropenia, with 18 experien cing 
febrile neutropenia and one patient dying of resulting sepsis.  Other common side effects 
included stomatitis, myalgia, and fluid retention.  [8, 9]    
 
More serious complications in docetaxel include colitis an d typhlitis.  Ibrahim et al. reported [ADDRESS_995467] shown docetaxel induced cecal perforation in a patient being 
treated for gastro -esophageal junctional adenocarcinoma and a patient who died of Clostridium 
perfrigens septic shock, with a source hypothesized to be due to typhlitis . [10]   
 
Phase [ADDRESS_995468] and ovarian cancer showed 
neutropenia, diarrhea, mucosi tis, neuropathy, and myalgia was seen at various doses, with 
neutropenia predominant at higher doses of 90 -100 mg/m2.  These results have been 
corroborated by [CONTACT_728977] [ADDRESS_995469] cancer patients.  Seidman et al. 
looked a paclitaxel  in 49 patients.  Of the grade 3 -4 events, 36% had neutropenia, 16% had 
arthralgia/myalgia, 8% had neuropathy, and 4% had mucositis.  Reichman et al. looked at 
paclitaxel in 28 patients; 20 patients developed neutropenia, of which 6 had febrile neutropenia , 
and 24 had grade 1 -2 neuropathy.  Diarrhea was seen in 14, mucositis in 20, nausea in 16, and 
arthralgia/myalgia in 27 p atients. [11, 12]  
 
As in docetaxel, typhlitis is also seen in patients receiving paclitaxel.   In a phase 2 trial of 63 
patients with small cell lung cancer on paclitaxel, topotecan, and etoposide, one patient died of 
febrile neutropenia and one of febrile neutropenia and typhlitis.  In a phase 1/[ADDRESS_995470] dose of a 72 hour infusional regimen of paclitaxel and doxorubicin 
MHRI GU IRB# 20 15-0547: HALT -D PROTOCOL                   
June [ADDRESS_995471] also been case reports of patients experiencing acute transient encephalopathy 
while receiving paclitaxel; this has not been reported with docetaxel . [13]   
 
While typhlitis, colitis, and acute transient encephalopathy are rarer  side effects of docetaxel 
and paclitaxel, neutropenia (i ncluding febrile neutropenia), neuropathy, and gastrointestinal 
symptoms are well established and in some studies, diarrhea is ev en the dose limiting toxicity. 
[7-10, 13 -18] 
 
2.5.[ADDRESS_995472] Cancer: Trastuzumab and Pertuzum ab  
Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular segment of the HER2 
receptor, causing cell cycle arrest and antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).  
Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular dimerization domain of 
HER2, thus inhibiting HER signaling pathways and ultimately also resulting in ADCC.   
 
The BCIRG [ADDRESS_995473] cancer.  Patients 
were randomized to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide  followed by [CONTACT_222892] 3 weeks 
(AC-T), AC -T with 52 weeks of trastuzumab (AC -T plus trastuzumab), or docetaxel and 
carboplatin plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab (TCH).  Overall, grade 3 or 4 diarrhea was seen in 
3.0% (32/1050) of patients who received AC -T, 5.6% (60/1068) of patients who received AC -T 
plus trastuzumab, and 5.4% (57/1056) of patients who received TCH. [19]   
 
The CLEOPATRA study launched the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel  
(THP) into the forefront of treatment for advanced or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer.  
Patients on this regimen saw a benefit not only in progression free survival (PFS), but also 
overall survival (OS).  However, 66.8% (272/407) of patients experience d all grade diarrhea, 
and 7.9% (32/407) had grade 3 -4.  In subsequent trials using this three drug regimen, authors 
report a similar incidence of diarrhea.  In the TRYPHAENA study, patients who received six 
cycles of THP experienced 72.4% (55/76) all grade  diarrhea and 11.8% (9/76) grade 3 -4 
diarrhea.  Similarly, in the NEOSPHERE study, patients  who received THP  experienced 46% 
(49/107) all grade diarrhea and 6% (6/107) grade 3 -4 diarrhea.  Patients who received 
trastuzumab and docetaxel experienced 34% (36 /107) all grade and 4% (4/107) grade 3 or 
higher diarrhea.  Patients who received pertuzumab plus trastuzumab experienced 28% 
(30/108) all grade diarrhea and no patients had grade 3 or higher diarrhea.  Finally, patients 
who received pertuzumab plus doceta xel experienced 54% (51/94) all grade and 4% (4/94) 
grade 3 or higher diarrhea.  In a recent publication looking at paclitaxel with trastuzumab and 
pertuzumab, Dang et al. reported 81% (56/69) all grade diarrhea and 3% (2/69) grade [ADDRESS_995474] similar incidences of diarrhea when 
combined with trastuzumab and pertuzumab.  [20-23]    
 
Prior studies of pertuzumab and trastuzumab suggest that while pertuzumab can cause  a high 
incidence of diarrhea, trastuzumab usually does not.  A phase 1 study of pertuzumab of 21 
patients showed 43% (9/21) experienced all grade diarrhea and 5% (1/21) had grade 3 -4.  In a 
phase 2 study of trastuzumab monotherapy, only two grade 2 diarrh ea events occurred out of 
768 administrations of trastuzumab in 46 patients, and no grade 3 events occurred.  Finally, a 
study of pertuzumab with or without trastuzumab in patients who had previously progressed on 
trastuzumab showed that in the pertuzumab monotherapy arm, 48.3% (14/29) had all grade 
diarrhea and 3% (1/29) had grade 3 -4.  Interestingly in the two drug pertuzumab -trastuzumab 
arm, 29% (5/17) had all grade diarrhea and 6% (1/17) had grade 3 -4. [20, 22 -27] 
 
MHRI GU IRB# 20 15-0547: HALT -D PROTOCOL                   
June [ADDRESS_995475] Cancer: Carboplatin  
Carboplat in is a platinum -based antineoplastic agent that interferes with DNA repair.  It is 
related to cisplatin, although carboplatin has less nephrotoxicity.  Cisplatin is currently not 
routinely used in the treatment of b reast cancer.   
 
Isakoff et al. conducted a phase [ADDRESS_995476] cancer.  Both groups of patients 
experienced fatigue, nausea, electrolyte abnormali ties, and hematologic toxicities.  Patients in 
the carboplatin arm had more thrombocytopenia, while patients on the cisplatin arm had more 
anemia, neutropenia, hypomagnesemia, tinnitus, and anorexia. [28] 
 
Von Minc kwitz et al. looked at patients with untreated, non -metastatic triple negative and HER2 
positive breast cancer who received paclitaxel and non -pegylated liposomal doxorubicin as their 
chemotherapy backbone, with or without carboplatin in the neoadjuvant se tting.  Triple negative 
cancer patients also received bevacizumab and HER2 positive cancer patients also received 
trastuzumab and lapatinib.  Patients who received carboplatin had a statistically higher 
incidence of anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, n ausea, anorexia, hand -foot syndrome, 
nail changes, and pneumonitis. [29]  
 
The BCIRG 007 Study was a phase 3 randomized trial comparing TH (docetaxel and 
trastuzumab) versus TCH (docetaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin ) as first line treatment for 
patients with HER2 posi tive metastatic breast cancer.  Patients who received carboplatin had 
increased thrombocytopenia, motor neuropathy, myalgia, rash, nail changes, nausea, and 
vomiting compared to the patients who did not receive carboplatin.   All grade diarrhea was seen 
in 51.1%  (67/131)  of patients on the TH arm and 56.5%  (74/131)  in the patients on TCH.  Grade 
3 or 4 diarrhea was seen in 2.3%  (3/131)  of the patients who received TH and 9.9%  (13/131)  of 
the patients who r eceived TCH.  The difference in diarrhea was not statistically significant.  [9] 
 
2.5.[ADDRESS_995477] Cancer: Neratinib and Lapatinib  
Neratinib and lapatinib are oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors of HER2 and EGFR; neratinib is an  
irreversible inhibitor that targets cysteine in the ATP -binding pocket of the receptors and 
lapatinib is a reversible inhibitor that blocks the phosphorylation of the receptors.  Lapatinib has 
also been shown to inhibit cyclin D in human tumor cell lines in vitro.     
 
Burstein et al. looked at neratinib monotherapy in patients with advanced HER2 positive breast 
cancer both with and without previous trastuzumab therapy.  All grade diarrhea was seen in 
93% (126/136) of patients and grade 3 -4 diarrhea in 21%  (29/136).  At the American Society of 
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in 2015, the results of the ExteNET study looking at with 
localized HER2 positive cancer treated with neratinib versus placebo for one year showed 
patients had 95.4% (1343/1408) all gr ade diarrhea and 39.9% (562/1408) grade 3 -4 diarrhea on 
the neratinib arm.  In comparison, 35.4% (499/1408) had all grade diarrhea and 1.6% (23/1408) 
had grade [ADDRESS_995478] ic anti -diarrheal agents and diarrhea resulted in dose reduction in 26.4% and drug 
discontinuation in 16.8% of patients.  In the NEfERT -T trial, patients received either 
neratinib+paclitaxel or trastuzumab+paclitaxel.  In the neratinib+paclitaxel arm, 92.5 % (222/240) 
had all grade diarrhea, and 30.4% (73/240) had grade 3 -4; patients on the 
trastuzumab+paclitaxel arm had 33.3% (78/234) all grade diarrhea and 3.8% (9/234) grade 3 -4. 
[30-32]   
 
Lapatinib has a similar diarrhea side effect profile as compared to neratinib.  In a phase [ADDRESS_995479] cancer patients, 80% (32/40) had all grade diarrhea and 20% 
(8/40) had grade 3 -4.  In the NeoALTTO study, a phase 3 trial looking at lapatinib, t rastuzumab, 
or lapatinib plus trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting, the incidence of diarrhea was much 
MHRI GU IRB# 20 15-0547: HALT -D PROTOCOL                   
June 7 , 2021  
 19 higher in the arms that contained lapatinib.  In the lapatinib with or without trastuzumab arm, 
approximately 85% experienced all grade diarrhea and 25 % had grade 3 -4 diarrhea.  In 
comparison, the trastuzumab monotherapy arm had 35% all grade diarrhea and 3% grade 3 -4. 
[30-34] 
 
2.5.[ADDRESS_995480] Cancer: Immunotherapy  
Immunotherapy agents such as ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], nivolumab, and pembrolizumab have been 
approved in melanoma and lung cancer; studies into these agents as well as other checkpoint 
inhibitors are underway in the field of breast cancer.   
 
PD-[ADDRESS_995481] a high 
incidence of diarrhea, ranging from 11 -37% in nivolumab, 13-16% in pembrolizumab, and up to 
45% in combination therapy with nivolumab and pembrolizumab. In a phase [ADDRESS_995482] been no reports of pe mbrolizumab 
associated colitis.  [6, 35 -44] 
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] a monoclonal antibody targeting CTLA -4, a protein receptor on the surface of T 
cells that downregulates the immune system;  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_728927].  
Pooled analyses in melanoma patients have shown that the toxicities are primarily due to 
activation of the immune system.  Twenty -seven to thirty -one percent of patients on ipi[INVESTIGATOR_728928], with  5% of cases at grade 3 -4; treatment is primarily with steroids, with one 
case report of a patient who required infliximab to stop the diarrhea.  Other serious side effects 
of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_728929], necrotic and hemorrhagic colitis, hypohy sitis, and 
uveitis.  In a recent publication looking at nivolumab, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], or nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_728930], diarrhea and colitis were seen much more frequently in the combination arm.  All 
grade diarrhea was reported in 19.2% of patients on ni volumab, 33.1% on ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and 
44.1% on nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  All grade colitis was seen in 1.3% on nivolumab, 11.6% 
on ipi[INVESTIGATOR_728931], and 11.8 % on nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  [6, 35 -44] 
 
Anti-PDL1 agents are a lso currently being studied.  Brahmer et al. conducted a study looking at 
the safety and activity of the anti -PDL1 agent BMS -[ADDRESS_995483] were an infusion reaction 
(seen in 10% of patients), diarrhea (seen in 9% of patients), and pruritus (seen in 6% of 
patients). [6, 35 -44] 
 
2.6 Chemotherapy Induced Diarrhea: Guidelines and Management  
Currently, there are no guidelines for prop hylactically treating CID in patients on regimens 
known to have high incidences of diarrhea.  Guidelines do exist for treating diarrhea once it 
occurs.  
 
Loperamide is an opi[INVESTIGATOR_728932] -diarrheal 
medication in the fr ont line setting.  It decreases both colonic mass movements and activity of 
the myenteric plexus, thereby [CONTACT_728978].  For grade 1 -2 
diarrhea, the guidelines recommend a 4 mg loading dose and then 2 mg either on a schedu led 
basis or after every loose stool with a maximum of 16 mg daily.  Once the diarrhea reaches 
grade 3 -4, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_728933].  
Loperamide can be continued and adding other agents, such as octreo tide, fluoroquinolone 
antibiotics, or other anti -diarrheal agents should be considered.  Stool studies and imaging 
should also be considered if there is an indication.  [4, 5, 45]  
 
MHRI GU IRB# 20 15-0547: HALT -D PROTOCOL                   
June [ADDRESS_995484] been very few studies looking at loperamide in the prophylactic setting.  A 
case report published in Korea documents the use of loperamide in a 72-year-old gentleman on 
treatment with cisplatin and docetaxel for stage 4 non -small cell lung cancer.  The patient 
developed grade 3 docetaxel induced diarrhea during cycle 2 on days 4 -10.  With prophylactic 
loperamide 2 mg every 8 hours and fasting during  cycle 3, the patient experienced no diarrhea . 
[46, 47]  
 
Jankowitz et al. looked at neratinib and trastuzumab with paclitaxel in a phase [ADDRESS_995485] epi[INVESTIGATOR_728934] 2 mg after each loose stool; however, the authors 
found that patients still consistently had diarrhea during the first week of therapy.  Therefore,  the 
authors amended the proto col to include prophylactic loperamide for all patients.  During cycle 
1, patients received [ADDRESS_995486] dose of neratinib, followed by 2 mg every 4 
hours for 3 days.  During the remaining 3 weeks of cycle 1, patients received 2 mg of 
loperamide every 6 -8 hours.  In total, 90% patients had all grade diarrhea and 38% had grade 3.  
The authors did not state how many patients who received anti-diarrhea prophylaxis 
experienced diarrhea.  [46, 47]  
 
Currently, there is a phase [ADDRESS_995487] looking at the incidence and severity of diarrhea in 
patients receiving neratinib and prophylactic high dose loperamide ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). [48]   
 
2.7.2  Octreotide  
Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that works by [CONTACT_728979] (such as gastrin, glucagon, growth hormone, etc.), reducing fluid secretion in the 
intestines, and reducing gastrointestinal motility.  It is administered subcutaneously (SQ) under 
the skin with a starting dose of [ADDRESS_995488] rointestinal cancers.  Patients were randomized to octreotide 100 mcg SQ 
twice a day for 3 days (n=21) or loperamide with a 4 mg loading dose and then 2 mg every 6 
hours for 3 days (n=20).  Seventeen patients on the octreotide arm had diarrhea resolution 
compared with only three patients on the loperamide arm, suggesting a superior efficacy for 
octreotide.  In the STOP trial, 147 patients on 5 -fluorouracil or irinotecan based regimens were 
randomized to receive long acting octreotide LAR intramuscularly (IM ) at either [ADDRESS_995489]

differences were not statistically significant.  Finally,  in the phase 3 LARCID trial, patients 
receiving 5 -fluorouracil, capecitabine, or irinotecan containing regimens were randomized to 
receive either oc treotide LAR 30 mg IM every 4 weeks or physician’s choice, which was 
primarily loperamide.  The incidence of diarrhea was equal in the two groups, with a 76% 
incidence of diarrhea in the octreotide LAR and 79% incidence in the physician’s choice group, 
with no difference noted in quality of life as assessed based on the FACIT -D score between the

at 150 patients with colorectal cancer who were receiving adjuvant 5-fluorouracil based therapy.  
Patients were randomized to lactobacillus capsules twice a day (total of 1 -2x1010 daily) plus 
fiber (11 grams guar gum daily) on days 7 -14 of each cycle of treatment versus no treatment.  
Those who received lactobacillus and fiber had statistically significant lower incidence of grade

Crofelemer  (Fulyzaq®)  (Mytesi®) is an FDA -approved anti -diarrheal agent that is derived from 
the red sap of the Croton lechleri plant in South America.  It acts luminally in the intestine and is 
not systemically absorbed due to its size and po larity.  In the large intestine, it is a dual inhibitor 
of the calcium activated chloride channel (CaCC) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
regulator (CFTR), two of the three channels that control chloride efflux.

4. Paclitaxel: administ ered IV at 80 mg/m2 every week  
5. Carboplatin: administered IV with AUC 6  every 3 weeks  
 
7 EXPECTED TOXICITIES AND DOSING DELAYS AND MODIFICATIONS  
7.1 Chemotherapy Dose Modifications and Delays  
In the event of a chemotherapy dosing delay or reduction, crofelemer is to be continued at  125 
mg twice a day without dose interruptions or adjustments.  
 
7.2 Crofelemer Side Effects  
Crofelemer is generally well tolerated with the FDA medical review reporting no adverse events 
(AEs) of special interest identified from clinical trials.  
 
Possible side  effects of crofelemer include  dyspepsia, flatulence, constipation, nausea, or 
increased alanine aminotransferase  (ALT).  All ALT elevations in the phase 3 trial of crofelemer 
in HIV/AIDS patients were grade 1 and felt to be due to the underlying patient p opulation due to 
high prevalence of hepatitis B and C infection, alcohol and/or drug abuse, or anti -retroviral 
medication -related hepatotoxicity.  
 
While there have been no studies looking at crofelemer concurrently with chemotherapy, studies 
have shown th at crofelemer is not systemically absorbed due to its size and polarity.  This is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_728989]: [59] 
a. At therapeutic dose level, its systemic absorption is minimal. Thus, 
pharmacodynamics studies are not applicable  
b. The absorption of Crofelemer (ent eric-coated tablets or beads) was minimal following 
oral dosing in healthy adults or in human immunodeficiency virus - positive (HIV+) 
subjects, in either the fasted or fed state. Across all the PK studies, less than 5% of 
healthy and HIV -associated diarrhe a subjects had detectable plasma concentrations 
of Crofelemer following oral dosing. Crofelemer was detected in plasma samples in 3 
of the 6 trials; however, the plasma Crofelemer concentrations were low, sporadic, 
discontinuous, and not sufficient for cal culation of pharmacokinetic parameters. The 
high degree of human plasma protein binding (approximately 97%) further limits 
MHRI GU IRB# 20 15-0547: HALT -D PROTOCOL                   
June 7 , 2021  
 28 systemic exposure to Crofelemer. At the therapeutic Crofelemer dose of 125 mg 
twice daily in ADVENT, less than 1% of plasma samples h ad Crofelemer 
concentrations above the limit of quantification (LOQ).  
c. In vitro data indicate, at clinical concentrations, no cytochrome P450 (CYP) -mediated 
metabolism or gastrointestinal (GI) absorption -based interactions with other drugs.  
Given this info rmation from the FDA, we have low concern for systemic absorption of crofelemer 
and believe it will not interfere with chemotherapy and therefore a phase 1 study of safety is not 
needed.  
 
7.3 Crofelemer Dose Modifications  
There are no dose modifications for c rofelemer, given there were very few anticipated side 
effects based on th e FDA review and phase 3 study.  [56] 
 
If a patient develops a CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_995510] cancer (if present), the treating physician 
has the option to hold crofelemer one time for up to 3 consecutive days (6 consecutive doses) 
and must document the reason for holding and how many doses crofelemer was held for.  The 
treating physician must also document if any diarrhea develops during this period of time off 
crofelemer  
 
If a patient develops a CTCAE grade ≥[ADDRESS_995511] cancer (if presen t), they will be withdrawn 
from the study.  
 
8 TREATMENT PLAN  
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  No investigational or commercial agents 
or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_728944]’s 
breast  cancer.    
 
The average baseline number of stools  must be collected at baseline and detailed in the 
Bowel Movement Endpoint Form (Appendix M)  by [CONTACT_5051], preferably the 
study coordinator .  During each cycle and at the end of treatment, detailed d iarrhea 
information, including but not limited to duration, onset, grading, FACIT score, rescue 
medication usage etc., must be collected for ALL patients and documented in the Bowel 
Movement Endpoint Form (Appendix M).   Appendix M must be fully completed  by [CONTACT_5055], preferably the study coordinator,  for each patient at each cycle and end 
of treatment visit and scanned into the patient’s electronic medical record.    
 
8.1 Crofelemer Arm  
Patients on the treatment arm will take one tablet of crofelemer tw ice a day (each tablet is 125 
mg), to be swallowed whole without chewing or crushing, during cycles 1 -2 of chemotherapy 
with THP or TCHP.  Each chemotherapy cycle is 21 days (3 weeks).  If, for any reason, 
chemotherapy is delayed, the patient should contin ue to take crofelemer daily without dose 
interruptions until the end of cycle 2 of chemotherapy.  There are no dosage adjustments for 
crofelemer, even if there is a chemotherapy dose reduction.       
 
Patients on the treatment arm will be on study for a to tal of 3 full cycles of THP or TCHP.  
Crofelemer will be dispensed in 30 day commercially available containers.  Patients will be 
instructed to take one tablet twice a day, to not take any additional tablets, and to bring the pi[INVESTIGATOR_728945].  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_728946].  On cycle 2 day 
MHRI GU IRB# 20 15-0547: HALT -D PROTOCOL                   
June [ADDRESS_995512] .  All remaining pi[INVESTIGATOR_728947], where unused pi[INVESTIGATOR_728948] , or be destroyed at the local pharmacy site per  SOP.  
 
On day 1 of cycle 1, the morning dose of crofelemer should be administered prior to initiating 
chemotherapy , ideally 30 -60 minutes prior .  The date and time (hour and minute) of this dose 
should be documented in Appendix H Crofelemer Flowsheet for C 1D1.  Thereafter patients 
should take crofelemer twice a day with no dose interruptions or delays until the end of cycle 2.   
The Crofelemer Flowsheet for C1D1 should be filled out by [CONTACT_728990]’s EMR.  The original form 
should be placed in the HALT -D Study Binder.  
 
Should a patient develop diarrhea while on crofelem er, rescue medications, including but not 
limited to loperamide, octreotide , and opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] , should be administered as per the current 
standard of care for chemotherapy induced diarrhea (see Section 8.4 General Concomitant 
Medication and Sup portive Care Guidelines below).   Patients s hould record each instance they 
use the rescue medication in the Rescue Med ication Diary and bring this diary with them to 
each office visit.   
 
If a patient who is taking crofelemer experiences severe persistent diarrhea that does not 
respond to standard of care anti -diarrhea treatment, patients will be evaluated for an infectio us 
diarrhea etiology with tests such as stool ova and parasites, stool culture , and Clostridium 
difficile .  The patient should stop crofelemer and NOT resume crofelemer.  They should still be 
followed until cycle 4 day 1.  
 
If a patient comes off study prio r to cycle 4 day 1 for toxicity not related to crofelemer 
(such as but not limited to infusion reaction to monoclonal antibodies), that patient will 
be replaced.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_995513] of care for chemotherapy induced diarrhea (see Section 8.4 General Concomitant 
Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines below).   Patients should record each instance they 
use the rescue medication in the Rescue Medication Diary and bring this diary with them to 
each office visit.   
 
If a patient experiences severe persistent diarrhea that does not respond to standard of care 
anti-diarrhea treatment, patients will be evaluated for an infectious diarrhea etiology with tests 
such as  stool ova and parasites, stool culture , and Clostridium difficile.  
8.3 Diarrhea Grading  
All patients will maintain a daily bowel diary which will be reviewed by [CONTACT_728991].  Grading of diarrhea will be acc ording to NCI CTCAE V4.0 
and is defined as follows:  
 Grade 1: increase of < 4 stools per day over baseline;  
 Grade 2: increase of 4 -6 stools per day over baseline;  
MHRI GU IRB# 20 15-0547: HALT -D PROTOCOL                   
June 7 , 2021  
 30  Grade 3: increase of ≥ 7 stools per day over baseline, incontinence, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_373] , limiting self care activities of daily living (ADLs);  
 Grade 4: life threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated.  
 
A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.can cer.gov ). 
 
8.[ADDRESS_995514] of the study medication.  Administration of rescue 
medication should follow the current treatment guidelines for CID, which in cludes, but is not 
limited to the following:  
 Loperamide at a 4 mg by [CONTACT_728992] 2 mg every 4 hours or after 
every unformed stool, up to 16 mg daily  
 Lomotil 5 mg 3 -4 times a day until control of diarrhea is achieved (maximum 20 mg/day) 
may be used at the discretion of the treating physician if deemed medically appropriate.  
Maintenance doses may be as low as 25% of the initial daily dose required to control the 
diarrhea.  Dose reductions are also at the discretion of the treating physicia n. 
 
In case of need, add:  
 Tincture of opi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 6 mg PO 4 times a day may be used at the discretion of the treating 
physician, if deemed medically appropriate.  
 
For all patients with diarrhea:  
 Any patient with diarrhea should be reminded to increase non -alcoho lic PO fluid intake  
 Any patient who needs intravenous fluids on a regular basis due to side effects of 
diarrhea may need to be evaluated for an infectious cause of diarrhea, with stool studies 
that may include stool ova and parasites, stool culture, and Cl ostridium difficile.  
 
For severe diarrhea (grade 3 -4 diarrhea):  
 Octreotide at a dose of [ADDRESS_995515] line therapy

11 QUALITY OF LIFE ASSESSMENT  
The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) is a health -related  quality of life 
questionnaire started in 1987 that looks at four primary quality of life domains: physical, soci al, 
emotional, and functional well-being .  FACIT has been validated in all cancers and there is a 
specific FACIT that focuses on diarrhea symptoms, called FACIT -D.   
 
For each quality of life domain, there are [ADDRESS_995521] 
how the patients are doing in that domain.  Results are scored from 0 -4, with 0 reflecting “Not at 
all” and 4 reflecting “Very much”.  There are an additional 11 questions asking patients about 
their bowel function and how diarrhea impacts their qua lity of life, also scored from 0 -4.   
 
FACIT -D scoring will be performed according to FACIT -D Scoring Guidelines (Version 4).  
Comparisons will be made between the treatment and control groups of the total FACIT -D 
score, as well as the diarrhea subscale (D S) score alone.   
 
All patients will be asked to complete the FACIT -D on day 1 of cycles 1 -3 and within 5 days of 
cycle 4 day 1  (depending on when their clinic visi t is scheduled) of THP or TCHP.  
 
The FACIT questionnaire and scoring guidelines are found in  Appendix A.  
 
12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a randomized, 1:1, stratified, open -label phase II study in patients with HER2 positive 
breast cancer receiving THP or TCHP in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or metastatic setting.  
Randomization will be stratif ied according to docetaxel versus paclitaxel.  
 
Patients randomized to the treatment group will receive oral crofelemer 125 mg twice daily 
during cycles 1 -2 of THP or TCHP chemotherapy.  The primary endpoint is number of patients 
with all grade diarrhea  felt to be definitely, probably, or possibly due to THP or TCHP  during 
cycles 1 and 2.  All patients will keep a daily diary of bowel movement number and consistency 
based on the Bristol Stool Scale.   
 
MHRI GU IRB# 20 15-0547: HALT -D PROTOCOL                   
June [ADDRESS_995522] 2 cycles of THP or TCHP.  Patients who 
completed fewer than 2 cycles  of THP or TCHP  will not be included in the analysis population.  
 
12.1 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
With a samp le size of 46 patients (23 per treatment group), the study has 81% power to detect a 
40% absolute decrease (from 60% to 20%) in incidence of all grade diarrhea  for two or more 
consecutive days that is definitely, probably, or possibly due to THP or TCHP  during cycles 1 
and 2 of chemotherapy, with a two sided significance level of 0.10 based on Fisher’s exact test.  
Anticipating a 10% withdrawal rate, we will accrue 52 patients.   
12.2 Futility  
The futility monitoring of the trial is based on a stochastic curtail ing approach based on the trial 
design described above [60]. The statistician will start to calculate information time as soon as 
[ADDRESS_995523] completed two cycles of chemotherapy. Once the information time reaches 
50%, a planned interim analysis for futility will be performed. The test statistic at this time point 
is the proportion of patients with no diarrhea from the treatment group minus the proportion of 
patients with no diarrhea from the control group divided by [CONTACT_148046]. It will be 
converted to Brownian motion scale for trial moni toring accounting for unequal incidences of 
diarrhea from the two groups. We will examine conditional powers relative to several expected 
rates of diarrhea and also discordance probabilities of a trend reversal  based on the primary 
endpoint (all grade diar rhea) and the main secondary endpoint (high grade diarrhea) .  If 
predictive power s over uniform prior are all less than 20%, the trial may be considered futile . 
The overall clinical benefit based on both endpoints will be examined in the report to the 
Meds tar-Georgetown LCCC DSMC. The protocol may be amended based on the 
recommendation s of t his DSMC.  
12.3 Randomization and Stratification Factors  
Stratified randomization will be used to assign patients into the two arms. There will be three 
strata: THP with docet axel, THP with paclitaxel , and TCHP  with docetaxel . Within each stratum, 
blocked randomization with randomly selected block sizes will be used. The stratified 
randomization procedure will be carried out by [CONTACT_46134](s) at the LCCC Biostatistics 
and Bioinformatics Shared Resource. They will implement the randomization, such as generate 
the randomization table and hold the randomization key.  
12.4 Patient Accrual  
We anticipate recruiting 2 -3 patients per month across the study sites combined, for an accr ual 
duration of approximately 17 -26 months.  Currently at each of the study sites, about 5 patients 
are newly treated with THP or TCHP each month.    
 
12.5 Analytic Plan for Primary Objective  
The number and percent of patients who experience diarrhea of any gra de during cycle 1 or 2 
for two or more consecutive days and that is felt to be definitely, probably, or possibly due to 
THP or TCHP will be summarized with two -sided 90% confidence interval overall and by 
[CONTACT_15500], and compared between treatmen t arms using a Fisher’s exact test.  The 
analysis population is defined as all randomized patients who complete 2 cycles of THP or 
TCHP chemotherapy.  
 
12.6 Analytic Plan for Secondary Objectives  
We plan on using the following analytic plans for the secondary o bjectives, if possible.  
 
According to treatment group, for each of the cycles  and stratum , we will summarize: 1) the 
number and percent of patients (and 95% CI) who experience diarrhea of any grade; 2) the 
MHRI GU IRB# 20 15-0547: HALT -D PROTOCOL                   
June 7 , 2021  
 34 number and percent of patients (and 95% CI) who ex perience diarrhea of grade 3 -4; 3) the 
median, range, and interquartile range of the duration of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]; and 4) the number (%) of 
patients requiring anti -diarrheal rescue medication.  
 
The time to onset of first epi[INVESTIGATOR_728921] -Meier 
method, and compared between treatment groups  and stratum  using log -rank test.  
 
The FACIT -D and FACIT -D DS scores will be summarized descrip tively and graphically by 
[CONTACT_5265], treatment assignment , and stratum . The change in FACIT -D and  FACIT -D DS scores 
between day 1 of cycles 1 -3 and end of study ( within 5 days of c ycle 4 day 1 ) will be compared 
at each time point between treatment groups using a Wilcoxon rank sum -test. 
 
The stool consistency, as measured by [CONTACT_728973], wi ll be summarized in frequency 
tables by [CONTACT_728993] a Wilcoxon rank 
sum-test. 
 
Adverse ev ents will be summarized by [CONTACT_24975], grade , and stratum , according to treatment arm.  
 
If the primary endpoint is not met statistically, the previously stated secondary endpoints and 
overall incidence of all grade diarrhea in both arms will still be evaluated for clinical benefit.  
 
[ADDRESS_995524] of monitoring and recording adverse events (AEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs) during cycles 1 -3 of treatment with THP or TCHP.  The Sponsors or 
their designee are responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to the FDA, DSMC , Genentech , and 
Napo .   
 
Please refer to the FDA -approved p ackage insert for a comprehensive listing of adverse events 
related to crofelemer.  The FDA medical review reported no adverse events (AEs) of special 
interest identified from clinical trials.

adverse events (SAEs) per protocol.  This includes all events of death, and any study specific 
issue of concern.  
 
13.1.[ADDRESS_995526] (IMP) or other protocol -imposed intervention, 
regardless of attribution.  
 
This includes the following:  
 AEs not previously observed in the subjects that em erge during the protocol -specified 
AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with [insert condition being 
studied] that were not present prior to the AE reporting period.  
 Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated intervent ions (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as cardiac catheterizations).  
 If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment associated with 
medication washout, no treatment run -in, or other protocol -mandated intervention.

June 7 , 2021  
 35  Preexisting medical co nditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_51754] -specified AE reporting period.  
 
13.1.3  Serious Adverse Events  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if the following criteria are met:  
 It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death).  
 It is life threatening (i.e.,  the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, h ad it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.).  
 It requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the subject’s ability to co nduct normal life functions).  
 It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother 
exposed to the IMP.  
 It is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_188212] (e.g., may jeopardize the subj ect or may require medical/surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above).  
 
 
13.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing AND Recording Safety variables  
The Sponsor is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observ ed or reported 
during the study  are collected and reported to the FDA, appropriate IRB(s), Napo, and 
Genentech, Inc. in accordance with CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports).  
 
13.2.[ADDRESS_995527] 
administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier. After 
this period, investigators should only report SAEs t hat are attributed to prior study treatment.  
 
13.2.[ADDRESS_995528], or other means will  be 
reported appropriately. Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e.,  start and 
end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to crofelemer, 
trastuzumab, and pertuzumab and actions taken.   
 
To ensu re consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guideline s: 
 
Yes 
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of 
crofelemer, trastuzumab, or pertuzumab and th e AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_1560]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE follows a 
known pattern of response to crofelemer , trastuzumab, and pertuzumab ; and/or the AE abates 
or resolves upon discontinu ation of crofelemer , trastuzumab, or pertuzumab  or dose reduction 
and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge.  
 
No 
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than crofelemer , trastuzumab, or pertuzumab  
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, under lying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
MHRI GU IRB# 20 15-0547: HALT -D PROTOCOL                   
June 7 , 2021  
 36 medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to crofelemer , trastuzumab, or 
pertuzumab administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_995529] dose of study drug).  
 
Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed or characterized in the 
Package Insert (P.I. ) or Investigational Brochure (I.B.)  
 
Unexpected adverse events are those not listed in the P.I. , or I.B.,  or not identified. This 
includes adverse events for which  the specificity or severity is not consistent with the description 
in the P.I.  or I.B.   For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the 
P.I. or I.B.  only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  
 
Please refer to S ection 7.[ADDRESS_995530] of expected  side effects associated 
with crofelemer.  
 
13.3 Procedures for Eliciting, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events  
Adverse events can be “Expected” or “Unexpected”.  Expected adverse events are those that 
have been previously identified as resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes 
of this study, an adverse event is considered expected when it appears in the current adverse 
event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or is included in the informed consent 
document as a potential risk.  For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered 
unexpected when it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the 
current adverse event list, the Inve stigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is not 
included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.  
 
When faxing reports to Genentech, please use the cover sheet found in Appendix G.  
 
13.3.[ADDRESS_995531] evaluation time points should be 
adopted. Examples of non -directive questions include:  
 “How have you felt since your last clinical visit?”  
 “Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?”  
 
13.3.[ADDRESS_995532] medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or SAEs. 
Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms  
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosi s should be reported rather than individual signs and 
symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated 
transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically 
characterize d as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is acceptable to 
report the information that is currently available. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it 
should be reported as follow -up information . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period, regardless of attribution, 
will be reported to the appropriate parties. When recording a death, the event or condition that 
caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as the single medic al concept. If 
the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, report 
“Unexplained Death”.  
 
MHRI GU IRB# 20 15-0547: HALT -D PROTOCOL                   
June 7 , 2021  
 37 [IP_ADDRESS]  Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study. Such conditions 
should be reported as medical and surgical history. A preexisting medical condition should be 
re-assessed throughout the trial and reported as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or 
character of  the condition worsens during the study. When reporti ng such events, it is important 
to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_13665] (e.g.,  “more frequent headaches”).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_728950]. If a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical or surgical procedure as a 
result of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be 
reporte d as the SAE. For example, if a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13587], record the heart condition that necessitated the by[CONTACT_13664].  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15429]:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_728951]  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_728952]  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_728953].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy  
If a female subject becomes pregnant while receiving the study drug or within [ADDRESS_995533] dose of crofelemer , trastuzumab, or pertuzumab  a report should be completed and 
expeditiously submitted  to Genentech  and Napo . Follow -up to obtain the outcome of the 
pregnancy should also occur. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should 
always be classified as serious, and expeditiously reported as an SAE. Similarly, any congenital 
anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject exposed to crofelemer , trastuzumab, or 
pertuzumab  should be reported as an SAE.  
 
Additional information on any crofelemer , trastuzumab, or pertuzumab -
exposed  pregnancy  and infant will be requested by  [CONTACT_728994] (i.e. after having received the initial report, at the end of the second 
trimester, 2 weeks after the expected date of delivery, and at 3, 6, and 12 months of 
the infant’s life).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Post-Study Adverse Events  
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a subject has completed or 
discontinued study partic ipation if attributed to prior crofelemer , trastuzumab, or pertuzumab  
exposure. If the investigator should become aware of the development  of cancer or a congenital 
anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female subject who participated in the 
study, this should be reported as an SAE.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reconciliation  
The Sponsor agrees to conduct reconciliation for the product. Genentech and the Sponsor will 
agree to the reconciliation periodicity and format, but agree at minimum to exchange quarterly 
line listings of cases received by [CONTACT_15481].  
 
If discrepancies are identified, the Sponsor and Genentech will cooperate in resolving the 
discrepancies. The responsible individuals for each party shall handle the matter on a case -by-

14 DATA SAFETY MONITORING COM MITTEE  
The Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center will be responsib le for the data and 
safety monitoring of this trial.   This study is an investigator initiated study utilizing a FDA 
approved drug for the same indication as the FDA approval (diarrhea), though in a different 
patient population  (chemotherapy induced as oppo sed to anti -retroviral therapy induced) .  The 
Sponsor  has applied fo r an IND exemption with the FDA.  This drug is not systemically 
absorbed and this is therefore a low risk study, requiring reviews by [CONTACT_728999] (DSMC) e very six months.   
 
The Sponsor  or their designee  will review the data inclu ding safety monitoring at institution 
based disease group meeting and on any meetings with participating sites. All Severe Adverse

 43 Events (SAEs) are required to be reported to the IRB.  Based on SAEs, the IRB retains the 
authority to suspend further accrual pending more detailed reporting and/or modifications to 
further reduce risk and maximize the safety of participating patients.  
 
Progress on the trial and the toxicities experienc ed will be reviewed by [CONTACT_729000]. Results of the DSMC meetings 
will be forwarded to the IRB with recommendations regarding need for study closure.  
 
DSMC recommendations should be  based not only on results for the trial being monitored as 
well as on data available to the DSMC from other studies.   It is the responsibility of the Sponsor  
to ensure that the DSMC is kept apprised of non -confidential results from related studies that 
become available.   It is the responsibility of the DSMC to determine the extent to which this 
information is relevant to its decisions related to the specific trial being monitored.  
 
A written copy of the DSMC recommendat ions will be given to the Sponsor and the IRB.   If the 
DSMC recommends a study change for patient safety or efficacy reasons the Sponsor  must act 
to implement the change  as expeditiously as possible.  If a recommendation is made to change 
a trial for reasons other than patient safety or effic acy the DSMC will provide an adequate 
rationale for its decision. If the DSMC recommends that the trial be closed for any reason, the 
recommendation will be reviewed by [CONTACT_729001].   
Authority to close a trial for s afety reasons lies with the IRB, with the above described input from 
DSMC and the LCCC Associate Director for Clinical Research .

 In this study your treatment is described in “cycles”.  A cycle for this study is a “21 day” length of  time. 
The days of the cycle are numbered 1 through 21; therefore, “Day 1” is the first day of the 21 -day cycle. 
The cycle may start on any calendar date, thus a cycle Day does not usually match the calendar date.  
 Take one tablet of crofelemer 125 mg by m outh with water every 12 hours ±2 hours at approximately 
the same time each day, with or without food.  
 Take crofelemer tablets whole – do not chew or crush.   
 If you miss a dose or vomit after dosing, do not retake this medication. Document it in this medic ation 
diary and r eport it to your health care provider at your next visit.  
 On Day 1 of every cycle, you should  take the a.m. dose of crofelemer before you start chemotherapy , 
ideally 30 -60 minutes prior .  
 Write the date and time when you took your medicati on at home in the tables below for all days through 
the last day of every cycle.  
 Keep crofelemer tablets out of reach of children.  
 The crofelemer tablets need to be stored in the original package.  Please see product label for 
appropriate s torage conditi ons.  
 You will receive a new Crofelemer  Diary and crofelemer supply at the first day of each cycle.  
 If, for any reason, you run out of crofelemer tablets, or anticipate running out before your next 
clinic appointment, please contact [CONTACT_729010] [PHONE_15142]  IMMEDIATELY.   
 While you are taking  crofelemer, always bring your medication bottle(s) even if empty and/or

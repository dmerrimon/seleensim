 1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA 
 
Surgery of limited pulmonary metastases from colorectal canc er appe ars to confer a survival 
benefit.  However, many patients with metastatic disease may have multiple co-morbidities 
and limited lung function, restricting their ability to unde rgo therapeutic surgical procedu res. 
Irreversible electroporation (IRE) offers a promising alternative to traditional surgical and 
thermal ab lation proced ures. Focal  thermal ab lation has been  observed to be a safe and 
effective alternative. However the use of thermal ab lation in the lung is restricted by 
[CONTACT_166978], to ensu re 
adequate tissue destruction. Therefore, an  ablation techn ique that does  not rely on increased 
tissue  temperature changes for tumor destruction may provide an alternative therapeu tic 
modality for ca re of patients who are non-surgical cand idates. 
 
IRE is a new form of tissue ablation that uses  strong pulsed electric fields to create persisting 
pores in the cell membrane, leading to cell death. This modality for induc ing cell death does 
not rely on sustained changes in tissue temperature and therefore, IRE may be considered a 
non-thermal ab lative tool that can be potentially applied in locations where thermal ab lation 
techn iques have limited effectiveness. Target locations can include tumors adjacent to large 
blood vessels or airways that can dissipate heat and limiting temperature changes needed  to 
ensu re cell death. This protocol seeks to explore the application of IRE for local treatment of 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to the lung in a treat and resect trial, with safety of 
this technique as the primary end point. 
 
The NanoKnife System, manufactured and marketed by [CONTACT_166979] (510(k) Number: K080376 ). While it can  be 
used  in multiple locations in the body, it has  not received clearance for the therapy or 
treatment of any specific disease  or cond ition. The proposed  safety study is not intended  to 
suppo rt a future marketing application. 
 
This clinical study is a safety study of open  surgical IRE ablation of lung metastases from 
colorectal cancer.  Approximately (and consistently) 50 colorectal canc er metastasectomies 
performed each  year by  [CONTACT_166980]. Our plan is to enroll 10 patients in an “ablate 
and resect” study to assess the safety of IRE ablation. Just prior to resection of their 
metastatic disease, the target lesions will be ablated using IRE. Safety data from this study 
will be assessed  for any  device related complications and will be used  to suppo rt a future 
feasibility study of percutaneous  IRE. 
 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS 
 
The purpose  of this study is to determine whether IRE using the NanoKnife system is safe for 
use within the lung when treating colorectal canc er metastases, and  to document the severity 
and incidence  of any adverse effects (AE) or severe adverse effects (SAE) that may arise 
during or immediately following completion of treatment. As a relatively new clinical tool, 
there are limited data on  the safety and best use practices for using IRE to treat lung 
metastases.  We hypothesize that IRE can be a useful alternative to radiofrequency  ablation 
(RFA) for ablation of colorectal metastases in the lung, and may provide benefit to patients 
whose  tumor locations contraindicate the use of RFA for treatment.

 The scientific aims of this study are to: 
 
 
1.  Assess  complications experienced  after us ing IRE for pe rforming ablations in the lung 
using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). 
2.  Measu re safety by [CONTACT_166981]. 
3.  Evaluate resected tissue for assessment of the ablation zone and comparison with 
expected zone based  on choice of treatment parameters. 
4.  Perform CT imaging to demonstrate the ability to ablate the tumor without caus ing major 
complications to surrounding critical structures. Specific imaging methods can be found 
in the Imaging section of this protocol. 
5.  Perform histopathologic assess ments on the surgically resec ted tissue. Specific 
histopathologic assessments can be found  in the histopathology section of this protocol. 
6.  Assess  safety through a complete physical examination and standard safety laboratory 
tests for each patient per the Schedu le of Events (Section 10). 
Evaluate Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Device 
Effects (ADEs), Serious Adverse Device Effects (SADE s), and Unanticipated Adverse 
Device Effects (UADE s) and generate a safety profile. 
 
 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE 
 
IRE ablation using the Nanoknife system is cleared for ablation of soft tissue without specific 
indications and is currently clinically used  at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
(MSKCC) and other ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_166968].  The current study is focused  on a specific soft tissue ablation, that is colorectal 
lung metastases, and  seeks to evaluate peri-procedural safety of this technique. 
 
Surgical Metastatectomy for Colorectal Metastases  in the Lung  
Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death for both men and women. 
(1) The lungs  are the most common extra-abdominal site of metastases in patients affected 
by [CONTACT_166982] r, and approximately 10% of patients with colorectal cancer  will develop 
lung metastases.(2) Since the first successful report of pulmonary metastatectomy for 
colorectal carcinoma in 1944,  several studies, including the International Registry of Lung 
Metastases,  have reported improved survival rates in selected patients unde rgoing lung 
resec tion for colorectal metastases  (3-5) A recent  meta-analysis reported for selected 
patients undergoing pulmonary metastatectomy for colorectal cancer an overall 5-year 
actuarial survival rate ranging between 38.3% and 63.7% (median 52.5%).(6) With this 
founda tion of data, the National Comprehensive Cancer  Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice 
Guidelines in Oncology recommends ridding isolated lung metastases from colorectal canc er 
(7)` 
 
Although surgical metastatectomy is the gold standard for treatment of these metastases  in 
the lung, patients could benefit from a less invasive approach through faster recoveries and 
fewer complications.  Percutaneous  ablation offers a minimally invasive lung preserving 
techn ique suitable for patients with co-morbidities. 
 
Image-Guided Lung  Radiofrequency  Ablation for Colorec tal Metastases 
A number of groups  have reported on the safety and  efficacy of lung radiofrequency  ablation 
for colorectal metastases.  These reports have demonstrated a preservation of lung function 
after the procedu re with no significant change in pulmonary function tests.(8,9) Similarly they 
have shown no deleterious effect in quality of life.  Efficacy of local tumor control, however, 
has been  variable.  A multicenter Japan ese study reported an 11% local tumor progression

IRB PROTOCOL

Amended :08-JUL-2016  
Page  7 of 25  
 rate in patients with small (< 3 cm) tumors that rose to 50%  progression with large tumors 
(3.1-6 cm).(10) However, in contrast, Hiraki et al (11) have reported only a 31% single 
session local control rate.   In the multi-national Lancet  Oncology study there were no 
procedu re related dea ths.  There were 26% patients requiring chest tube p lacement.  Minor 
complications were pneu mothorax, pleural effusion, and self-limiting hemorrhage.  This study 
also looked at quality of life using the Short Form (SF)-12) and the Functional Assess ment in 
Cancer  Therapy---Lung (FACT-L) questionna ires.  These de monstrated no deterioration from 
the ablation.(12) 
 
Limitations of Radiofrequen cy Ablation in the Lung  
Some of the efficacy limitations of radiofrequency ab lation in the lung described above 
conce rn its unpredictable zone of ablation.  In our own work we have seen  these limitations 
appear  most strikingly for tumors greater than 3 cm in size.   Ablations for lung cance rs 
treated with RFA had a 65% local progression-free rate at 12 months if they were smaller 
than 3 cm, but had only a 12% local progression-free rate for tumors greater than 3 cm 
(unpub lished).  Some of the factors that weigh in on the ab lation zone are physiological and 
others  are  electrical.    The  physiologic  limitation  of  radiofrequency  ab lation  in  the  lung 
conce rns the “heat sink” effect in which flowing blood cools the area that is trying to be 
heated.  This has been  demonstrated in many studies.(13-15) Electrical conduc tivity is also 
an important issue in the ablation effectiveness.  Computer modeling has demonstrated a 
strong correlation between tissue electrical conductivity and RF heating.    Inferior heating 
and distribution of heating effects occ urs with tissue  like lung that has poor thermal 
conduc tivity(16-17) 
 
Multi-tined applicators that increase the electrode surface a rea, ionic fluid infusion, and 
protocol op timization have been  attempts to lower the electrical impeda nce in lung tissue to 
permit current flow.   However, fluid infusion is unpredictable and may increase  complications 
while multi-tined electrodes may increase  the pneu mothorax and  pose  additional injury 
through errant need les.18-[ADDRESS_194069] the structural integrity of 
non-targeted critical structures such as ne arby [CONTACT_166983]. The intense 
heating used  during RFA can coagulate the collagen in the extracellular matrix of these 
luminal structure, leading to tissue break down and complications such as bronchop leural 
fistula and absces s.20 
 
Irreversible Electroporation Tumor  Ablation: A Non-Thermal  Techn ique 
Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is an FDA approved, non-thermal ablative tool that creates 
pores in cell membranes  through the application of pulsed direct cu rrent. While “reversible 
electroporation” that allow cell membrane pores to heal has  been used  in medicine for 
transmembrane drug delivery for many decades, the application of high voltages that create 
irreversible electroporation is relatively new. Its application to destroy cells has been 
demonstrated in small animal tumor models, and large animal tissues.(21-23) Most recently 
clinical app lications have been  reported. (24)At MSKCC nea rly [ADDRESS_194070] been 
performed clinically. (25) Retrospe ctive reports on some of these  patient s tudies have been 
published.  In the Kingham et al. (25)  study it was shown in 65 tumors that IRE was safe and 
feasible adjacent to vessels.  In the Silk et al. (27) s tudy it was similarly found safe for use 
adjacent to biliary structures. 
 
IRE’s  ablative  effect  has  been  shown  not  to  rely  on  sustained  increases  in  tissue 
temperature, and therefore is cons idered non-thermal.(26) This raises the possibility of an 
ablative tool that is not affected by [CONTACT_941] “heat sink” effect seen with thermal ablation.    IRE 
appea rs to effect cells while sparing the scaffold of tissues such as collagen and fibrous

 tissue.  This has been  demonstrated by  [CONTACT_166984] (28), rectal wall (29) and bile 
ducts (30) in animal models. Preservation of bronchi  in the lung may avoid the thermal 
ablation complication of bronchop leural fistula (31). Treatment parameters and ensu ing size 
and shape  of the ablation zone can be roughly determined using numerical models of the 
distribution  of  electrical  energy  within  the  target  tissue  (32).  This  allows  for  a  more 
predictable ablation zone based  on the placement of the electrodes.  This is not eas ily 
achieved using currently available thermal ablation devices 
 
Therefore, this study is intended  to assess the safety of surgical and eventually 
percutaneous  ablation using the Nanoknife system for the ablation of lung metastases. 
 
Animal Studies 
We performed a non-GLP, acad emic study of IRE of the lung in 11 pi[INVESTIGATOR_166969]- 
term observation of the animals (0, 1, 4 and 21 days) to assess  safety, feasibility and 
morbidity following ablation (31).  Ablations were deliberately performed close to critical 
structures (broncho vascular structures and <2cm from the heart). A total of [ADDRESS_194071] imaging and compared with 
histological ana lysis. Ablations were performed using a single set of treatment pa rameters (9 
Trains of 10 70 μsecond pulses with applied voltage of 1700 -2500V  between the need le 
electrodes). The treatments were performed with ECG synchronization. Acute analysis 
(<4days) of ablation specimens indicated necrotic cell dea th of ablated tissue with necrosis of 
bronch ial and  vascular epi[INVESTIGATOR_166970]. 
Chronic ablations showed bronch iolitis obliterans and alveolar interstitial fibrosis. No 
significant c ardiac arrhythmias were noted during or following the proced ures.  Additionally, 
any thermal injury to tissue was found  restricted to a small region (<0.5mm) in proximity to 
the electrodes. Numerical modeling was used  to plan ablations of size 2.0-2.5cm in length 
and 2.7-3.0cm in depth. CT measurement at immediate post treatment, at [ADDRESS_194072] of the applied voltage can also 
be influenced  by [CONTACT_166985], or the bronchus (33). For this 
clinical application, it is well known that lung tumors and metastatic tumors in the lung have 
electrical condu ctivity 2-3 times that of surround ing lung parench yma (34-36). Numerical 
modeling and simulation is well resea rched for its use in determining optimal treatment 
parameters when applying DC cu rrent to biological tissue (37-38). Therefore we performed 
numerical modeling specific to IRE ablation of tumors in lung tissue using actual tissue 
impedance  data found  in literature (39). Based  on our o wn results, we have found  that an 
adequate electric field with sufficient ho mogeneity can be developed  by [CONTACT_166986].  
 
The lung has higher electrical impedance  than other organs (for example, the liver) and also 
has poorer thermal con ductivity (40-41). The electrical and  thermal property of the lung has 
made it a difficult target to plan and deliver RF current driven thermal ab lation. The primary 
ablation mechan ism of IRE is different from c linically used  thermal techn iques.  IRE does  not 
rely on sustained changes in tissue temperature for ablation of the target region. While there 
exist transient temperature increase during application of IRE pulses, the kill mechan ism is 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER CENTER

largely independent  of any rise in tissue temperature. Based  on our large animal model 
studies, and  results from nu merical simulations, we assert that IRE ablation can be 
performed using pulse parameters currently approved and clinically used for soft tissue 
ablation. Adjustments to ablation probe geometry and placements, and  minor changes to 
applied voltage will be sufficient to achieve complete ablation in our se lected targets. 
 
The parameters proposed for ablation in patients is also supp orted by a pre-clinical large 
animal model study reported by [CONTACT_160607](42). Goldberg et al. reports a comprehens ive 
study of varying key IRE parameters (pulse width, number of pulses, distance between 
probes  and applied voltage) with the size, and the quality of ablations created in swine liver. 
They report that ablation size plateaued  beyond a pulse width of 50 microseconds,  applied 
50 times; increasing these parameter values did not show  any significant change in ablation 
size. They also reported a direct correlation between applied voltage and ablation size, with 
the maximum applied voltage caus ing a large ablation of uniform quality. Additionally, they 
reported that 2 .0 cm was the maximum effective spacing between the electrodes  for creating 
large, complete ablations. Even with additional increase  in applied voltage, further increase 
in electrode spacing caused hourglass shaped  ablations.

Based on the experimental da ta and c linical expe rience it is hoped that this would allow 
operators to comfortably treat tumors up to 3.0 cm diameter. Also, using our  experience with 
prior animal studies, a protocol was developed  to use EKG gated synchronized IRE ablations 
to minimize poss ibility of cardiac arrhythmia. (43) Electrical pulses from IRE have been 
known to cause  muscle stimulation. 
 
Complications following IRE will be assessed  using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE). In addition to the complications observed with other lung 
ablation procedu res, such as bleeding, and infection, IRE-spec ific complications such as 
cardiac arrhythmias will be particularly note and graded  with the CTCAE. 
 
 
Alterna tive Practices or Procedures  
Surgical resection of colon metastases to lung is the mainstay of treatment.  However, 
resec tion can be costly in terms of recovery time and loss of lung function.  Additionally, 
many patients have medical co -morbidities that make them unfit for surgery.  Lastly, patients 
with lung metastases often develop additional lung metastases making repeated surgeries 
difficult.  An alternative approach  to treating lung metastases has been  thermal ab lation.

 This, ho wever, has had limitations due to thermal conduc tivity of lung and “heat sink” 
limitations of vessel and  bronchus  diffusion of heat. In effect, this reduces  patients who can 
benefit from ablation therapy and also in some patients this also leads  to incomplete ablation 
which results in local d isease  progression. If suc cessful, IRE ablation would potentially 
benefit Medicare patients by [CONTACT_166987] a  less invasive and more lung preserving

with the FDA-cleared Instructions for Use (IFU).  The IRE will be performed in an open 
fashion with palpi[INVESTIGATOR_166971]. Image guidance  will not be

For the purposes  of this study, a set target volume will be ablated using 2 probes  spaced 
approximately 1.0 cm to 1.5 cm apart and  at 2.0 cm electrode exposu re.  To study safety, 
this study will include only a 2 probe ablation.  Commercially available Nanoknife spacers will 
be utilized to ensure proper probe placement. We are not limiting the upper limit of size. 
 
The treatment pa rameters will be a minimum app lication of 1,600 V/cm be tween electrodes

after the patient’s R wave with this cardiac synchronization facilitated by [CONTACT_166989]. Conductivity and impedance  measu rements will 
be taken using the need le electrodes used  to deliver treatment. 
 
Ablation of the target volume will be followed by a resection of the tumor tissue and tumor 
margin as per standa rd surgical proced ures for a pu lmonary metastasectomy.  Surgical 
resec tion and de-vascularization (i.e. cu tting off the blood supp ly) of the tumor will be 
completed after a minimum of 15 minutes has elapsed  following completion of the ablation 
procedu re. 
 
We will allow multiple lesions from the same patient to be treated. While each lesion will be 
analyzed separately we will keep the enrollment target at 10  patients and as a result the 
number of lesions treated on the study may exceed  10. 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/D IAGNOSTIC AGENTS 
 
The NanoKnife device is used  to perform Irreversible electroporation (IRE) and has received 
FDA clearance  for ab lation of soft tissue [510(k) Number: K080376 ]. The NanoKnife System 
is produced  manufactured by [CONTACT_166990], Queensbu ry, [LOCATION_001]. The NanoKnife® 
System transmits non-thermal en ergy from the NanoKnife Generator to electrodes  placed  in 
a target area. The electrodes  work in a two-pole operating mode, and  up to six electrodes 
can be placed at a fixed distance  apart in soft tissue to create several two-pole electrode 
configurations. The NanoKnife System with six outputs is indicated for surgical ab lation of 
soft tissue.  IRE ablation is believed to work by [CONTACT_166991].

IRB#: 15-001A(5) 
Amended :08-JUL-[ADDRESS_194082] of care for a thoracotomy (pulmonary metastasectomy). The NanoKnife proced ure 
will be performed in accordance  with the FDA-cleared Instructions for Use (IFU). 
 
For the purposes of this study, a set target volume will be ablated using 2 probes  spaced 
approximately 1.0 cm to 1.5 cm apart and  at 2.0 cm exposu re. 
 
Commercially available Nanoknife spacers will be utilized to ensure proper probe placement 
as necess ary. 
 
The treatment pa rameters will be 1,600 V/cm and [ADDRESS_194083] each  IRE pulse 70 
milliseconds  after the patient’s R wave with this cardiac synchronization facilitated by [CONTACT_166993]. Conduc tivity and impedance  measurements will be made from the 
electrodes. 
 
Ablation of the target volume will be followed by a resection of the tumor tissue and tumor 
margin as per standa rd surgical proced ures for a pu lmonary metastasectomy.  Surgical 
resec tion and de-vascularization (i.e. cu tting off the blood supp ly) of the tumor will be 
completed after a minimum of 15 minutes has elapsed  from the time of ablation. 
 
Upon resection, the investigating surgeon will mark the electrode entry sites and orientation, 
as well as mark the approximate center of the ablation zone. The tissue specimen may be 
marked using either of the following methods:  
 
• Using appropriate markers, e.g., 2 or 3 inch angio-catheter type IV introducers 
 
• Using the electrodes  from the study procedure as markers, i.e., the electrodes  can be 
cut off and  left placed  in the tumor following the ablation and resection 
 
Any other marking or inking of the tumor to facilitate routine pathology of the resected 
spec imen may be performed as neede d. The marked tumor will then be placed  in an 
appropriate specimen container and se nt for pa thology examination. 
 
Once the study procedure has been  completed, the probes  will be removed and discarded 
appropriately.  Upon completion of the surgery patients will be obse rved in the PACU and 
then observed on the surgical floor. 
 
 
 
Subjects will receive treatment on one lung at a time. If both lungs have suitable resectable 
metastases, the subject may return at a later date to have the other lung treated. The 
subject will not receive a new subject ID#, but will have all app licable data collected on 
additional case  report forms.

 evaluate the zone of irreversible electroporation (IRE). Routine histology with hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E) may be used  to characterize acute tissue changes in the ablation and 
border regions.  Mitochond rial stains for viability will also be applied. Mason Trichome (MT) 
stains will be applied to assess  the morphological status of collagen  within the treatment 
region. Pathological Analysis will be used  to construct nu merical models that will try to 
assimilate the distribution of electric fields during treatment delivery.

the study procedure, it is unlikely that the tissue specimens examined in this study will exhibit 
definitive necrosis in the target ablation volume. However, early morphologic cellular 
chan ges may be observed in the ablation zone. 
 
Changes in the tissue specimen that may be expected to be observed following the study 
procedu re may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
• Edema (swelling) 
 
• Capi[INVESTIGATOR_166973] 
 
• Cellular shrinkage 
 
• Pyknosis (nuclear shrinkage) 
 
• Karyorrhexis (nuclear or chromatin fragmentation) 
 
• Reduced  hematoxylin intensity (if H&E staining is performed) 
 
Any histologic observations of the ablation zone will include delineation of the zones  where 
acute tissue changes are present and will be recorded.

11.0 TOXICITI ES/SIDE EFFECTS 
 
Irreversible electroporation (IRE) uses need le electrodes  to deliver a current that generates 
an electro-magnetic field across cell membranes  causing formation of expand ing pores 
resulting in localized necrosis - cell death – of the targeted tissue. Complications related to 
the device and surgical IRE procedu re are rare. In [ADDRESS_194087] of the AEs will likely be related to surgery. AEs that a re believed to be 
directly from the IRE will be noted. If there are 3 or more grade 3 or higher device related 
AEs, then we will stop the study. 
 
Complications related to surgical resection (which is the standa rd of care for colorectal 
metastases to the lung) are well established.  Potential de vice complications include: 
 
Due to Electric Current 
 
• Risk of cardiac arrhythmia.  Synchronizing the pulse delivery with the EKG so that 
pulses are given during the refractory period of the cycle should minimize this risk. 
• Involuntary muscle contraction at the time of the electric pulse, which stops at the end 
of the pulse. This is managed by [CONTACT_91959] a paralytic agent p rior to the electrical pu lse 
delivery. 
• Neuropathic Pain 
 
Due to Electrode  Placement  
 
• Risk of infection for the patient 
• Risk of bleeding

record. 
 
16.1 Quality Assurance  
 
Quarterly registration reports will be generated to monitor pa tient accruals and completeness 
of registration data. Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess missing data 
and incons istencies. Accrual rates and extent and  accuracy of evaluations and follow-up will 
be monitored periodically throughout the study period and potential problems will be brought 
to the attention of the study team for discuss ion and action Random-sample data quality and 
protocol compliance  audits will be conduc ted by [CONTACT_3476], at a minimum of two times 
per year, more frequently if indicated. 
 
16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
were approved by [CONTACT_30589] 2001.  The plans address the 
new policies set forth by [CONTACT_30590] “Policy of the National Cancer 
Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can be found

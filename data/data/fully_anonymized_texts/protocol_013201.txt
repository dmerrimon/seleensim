Title: Testing  a medication risk communication and surveillance strategy: The EMC2 Trial
Investigator: Michael  Wolf, PhD, MPH
Supported by: [CONTACT_108928] (NIDDK)
Introduction: My  name [CONTACT_832] _______________. I am a research assistant working on behalf of 
_________________ (site) and Northwestern University, inviting you to participate in a research study.
This is  why the research is being done
We are  doing a research study to evaluate different ways to give patients information on medications 
that might have important safety messages. We are also testing different ways to follow up with patients 
to see how they are doing once they have been taking the medicine for a while. 
Here is why  you are being asked to take part in this research study
We are  inviting you to participate because you were recently prescribed one or more of the medicines 
that we are studying. 
If you  say that “Yes, you want to be in this research,” here is what will happen
If you  choose to participate, you will be assigned to one of two groups, based on the clinic you visited 
to get your prescription. If you are in the usual care group, you will receive the current standard of care. 
If you are in the intervention group, you will receive text or phone prompts to call into an automated 
phone system, which will ask questions about how your medicine is working for you. That call will take 
about [ADDRESS_120855]. . 
This is  what you should know about being in a research study 
Whether  or not you choose to take part is up to you. 
If  you decide not to participate, it will not be held against you or affect your right to any present or 
future medical treatment. You will not be penalized or lose any benefits to which you are entitled. 
If  you do choose to participate, it’s ok to change your mind later. You are free to leave the study at 
any time, for any reason. We will keep all data collected until the time you change your mind.
You  can ask all the questions you want before you decide.
Here is how being  in this research could be bad for you
Your participation  in this study does not involve any physical or emotional risk to you beyond that of 
everyday life. You may skip any questions that make you feel uncomfortable.  
This is  what will happen to the information collected for this research
Efforts will  be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information. We cannot promise

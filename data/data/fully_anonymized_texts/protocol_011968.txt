 BACKGROUND 
 Therapy Approaches for NSCLC  
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer -related deaths in both men and women in the US. 
(https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/lungb.html). The majority of NSCLC patients present with 
advanced  or metastatic disease, which is not amenable to surgical resection.  
Immunotherapy has attracted much attention in recent years, since (i) identification of molecularly-defined tumor antigens (TA) [ 1, 20] has provided well defined moieties to be used as immunogens 
and as markers to monitor the immune response; (ii) characterization of the molecular steps leading to an immune response [ 5, 6] has facilitated the development of effective immunization strategies; 
and (iii) availability of cytokines has provided reagents to modulate the immune response. Because of the general belief that T cells play a major role in the control of tumor growth [ 15, 16], the 
application of T cell -based immunotherapy has been emphasized.  
 Immune -Checkpoint Blockade Immunotherapy Approaches  
Immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_256533], more recently, non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Immune checkpoints are crucial for the 
maintenance of self -tolerance and it is known that some tumors use checkpoint systems to evade 
antitumor immune response. The treatment of advanced  NSCLC by [CONTACT_179475], such as 
immune -checkpoint blockade targeting the programmed cell  death protein- 1 (PD1/PDL1) , has led 
to significant clinical benefit either as monotherapy or in combination  therapy [ 4]. 
 Need f or Tumor Response Assessment  
The landscape of novel cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_256534], with great promise in the immunotherapy trials as illustrated by [CONTACT_6581] (FDA) approval of multiple checkpoint inhibitors for various cancer i ndications, a monoclonal 
antibody (mAb), ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], for treatment of metastatic melanoma [ 12] and a vaccine for prostate 
cancers as the first vaccine against non -viral cancers [ 13]. There is a pressing need for accurate, 
timely assessment of immunotherapy treatment response in cancer patients to improve clinical management and facilitate drug development. A standard for response assessment is measuring 
tumor size with CT or MR and t hen classifying tumor size reduction according to RECIST [ 8]. 
RECIST and other standard response measures are ill suited to monitor response to 
immunotherapy, largely due to “pseudoprogression” caused by [CONTACT_256547]. However, molecular imaging can measure important biologic responses 
that precede tumor size reduction , such as cellular metabolism, proliferation, and vascularity. 
 A Specific T -Cell Activation Imaging Agent for Tumor Response Assessment  
Early preclinical and clinical studies have shown promise for immunotherapy treatments for 
several malignancies [ 22]. Immunotherapy is expected to grow in importance; however, it presents 
[18F]F-ARAG /NSCLC   Clinical Study Protocol: CST -FARAG -203 
  Version 1.4: 04.23.202 4 
Department of Radiology   
Confidential   Page 11 of 43 difficult challenges for response assessment. For instance, successfully treated tumors may 
actually increase in size after therapy due to inflammation and only later shrink [ 25]. RECIST 
criteria [8] designed to detect early effects of cytotoxic agents by [CONTACT_256548], or the more 
recently proposed immune -related response criteria (irRC) [ 19] do not allow an early assessment 
of immunotherapeutic response since both depend on tumor size change. Furthermore, FDG PET is confounded by [CONTACT_256549] [ 2, 11] . Thus, it is imperative to 
develop new imaging and analysis protocols to evaluate immune -checkpoint blockade approaches.  
A method that evaluates T cell activation would permit an assessment of a basic first step in the process of assessing immunotherapy efficacy.  
 Investigational Agent: [18F]F-AraG  
CellSight Technologies  (CST), Inc. is a company that is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a suite of PET tracers targeted 
at visualizing immune response early in a patient's immunotherapy regimen.  Their lead PET imaging tracer targeted at imaging activated T -cells is a fluorine -18-labeled analog of an 
FDA -approved drug Nelarabine [
18F]F-AraG, trade name [CONTACT_256580].  VisAcT is independent of the 
type of immunotherapy regimen being administered -  adoptive cell therapy, checkpoint inhibitors, 
cancer vaccines or a combination of immunotherapy and conventional medicines.  VisAcT is relatively specific to activated T -cells that are critical to any immune modulated therapy.  In vivo, 
real time imaging of activated T -cells in solid tumors before and at a timepoint during and after  
checkpoint inhibitor therapy (CkIT therapy)  can help understand the effects of check point 
blockade therapy.  Additionally, in vivo whole -body imaging of activated T -cells can provide 
critical information about the effect of immunomodulation in autoimmune diseases, as well as help their prediction as adverse events.   
1.5.1 Preclinical Characterization  
Molecular imaging of immune activation by [CONTACT_28124] (PET) is a potential noninvasive strategy to monitor immune activation after treatment with immunotherapy.  Increased activity of nucleoside salvage pathways has been associated with th e proliferation of 
adaptive and innate immune cells [ 10, 24].  In preclinical models of cancer and autoimmunity, the 
PET probe [
18F]–2-fluoro -d-(arabino -furanosyl)cytosine ([18F]-FAC), which targets the 
deoxycytidine salvage pathway, was shown to localize to sites of immune activation [ 21] and is 
predominantly accumulated in proliferative CD8+ T -cells [ 17]. 
Recently, a radiofluorinated AraG imaging agent,  [18F]F-AraG(2′ -deoxy- 2′-fluoro- 9-β-D-arabino -
furanosylguanine;   trade name [CONTACT_256580]) was synthesized [ 18] with a goal of development for 
human use.  F -AraG is a fluorinated purine derivative with selective T -cell toxicity.  A 
water -soluble AraG prodrug, Nelarabine, is FDA approved for the treatment of relapsed T -cell 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia and T -cell lymphoblastic lymphomas [ 7]. [18F]F-AraG 
preferentially accumulates in murine and human activated T -cells than in naive T -cells ( Figure 1).

lymph nodes of mice.  Untreated cells as well as CD3/CD28 activated T -cells (48 hours) were incubated with 
[18F]F-AraG before subcutaneous implantation into the shoulders before PET/CT imaging.  
The accumulation of [18F]F-AraG in human activated T -cells is also significantly higher than other 
immune cells, including B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells [14] .  Furthermore, 
endogenously induced anti -tumor immune response in a viral induced rhabdomyosarcoma (MSV) 
mouse model was correlated with enhanced [18F]F-AraG uptake within the tumors ( Figure 2A ).  
Analysis of isolated tumors showed that tracer preferentially accumulated in activated CD8+ 
T-cells ( Figure 2B ).

and P815 mastocytoma (control) was implanted in the right shoulder.  PET/CT was performed on Day 14 during the 
peak anti -tumor immune response in the rhabdomyosarcoma model.  B ) CD8+, CD4+ and C19+ cells were isolated 
from rhabdomyosarcoma tumor one hour after probe injection for radioactivity assay.  Lymphocytes take up more than 
80% of tumor associated [18F]F-AraG, with CD8+ and CD4+ cells acquiring the largest portion of the tracer (72%). 
The low uptake in B cells (CD19) is only observed in mice. Human B cells do not accumulate the tracer.  C) FACS 
analyses of the isolated lymphocytes showed an activated phenotype (CD44+ CD62L -) in majority of CD8+ 
(79.9±11.5) and CD4+ cells (88.3±11.7). Error bars represent standard deviation.  
1.5.[ADDRESS_311918] -in-human study of [18F]F-AraG was performed at UCSF in 2015 ( abstract of meeting 
presentation available here:

[18F]F-AraG was administered at a subpharmacologic, tracer microdose consistent with imaging 
practices in six healthy volunteers (3 males and 3 females).  The distribution of the tracer was 
evaluated over the first 4 hours after injection.  A representative whole  body PET/MR image in a 
healthy volunteer is shown in Figure 3 ([23]; [18F]F-AraG Investigator’s Brochure) .  The tracer 
was well tolerated by [CONTACT_256550] > Grade 1 adverse events  (AE).  The only AE 
that occurred in more than 1 volunteer was positive white blood cell  (WBC ) esterase in the 
urinalysis without urinary symptoms.  Normal uptake was seen in the clearance organs: liver, 
kidneys and bladder.  There appeared to be uptake in the thyroid and parotid glands, as well as

 [18F]F-AraG is currently being tested in several  Phase I /II clinical trials.  The clinical trials aim to 
evaluate the use of [18F]F-AraG in cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy. Cancer types 
include solid tumors of all types including, among others, lung cancer, melanoma, breast cancer 
and head & neck cancer.  Non-oncology focused trials include an HIV trial at UCSF to help see 
differences in repositories of T cells in HIV patients and a trial at Stanford is determining if [
18F]F-AraG will be useful as an early predictor of Graft vs Host Disease .  
Investigators from Stanford have reported early clinical evidence that [18F]F-AraG PET scans 
demonstrate imaging of activated T -cells in vivo.  In a study that aims to evaluate immunological 
response to Anti -PD-1 treatment in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN),

of both CD8+ cells and higher expression of CD38 activation marker after one treatment.  In Patient B,  there was not 
a significant increase in total SUV in VOI and correspondingly there was not an increase in the  CD8+ cells as analyzed 
by [CONTACT_7811].  Bar graphs show proportion of cells e xpressing CD8 and CD38 markers in tissue samples pre and post Ab

 STUDY RATIONALE  
Given that immunotherapeutic strategies, in particular immune checkpoint antibodies, focus on the 
generation of T -cell-based antitumor immunity, uptake of [18F]F-AraG within the tumor is 
hypothesized to correlate with T -cell mediated immune response seen in the biopsy samples of 
cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade.  Correlation of pre - and post-treatment 
intratumoral immune in filtration by [CONTACT_256551]

Department of Radiology   
Confidential   Page 16 of 43 clinical trials investigating the role of [18F]F-AraG in the monitoring of anti -tumor immune 
responses . Therefore, proper quantification of [18F]F-AraG  uptake in tumor lesions, and 
understanding its relation with physiologic uptake in background tissues is important. Note: 
checkpoint therapy in this study is standard- of-care and is not under investigation.  
The distribution of radiotracer activity depends on post -injection imaging time for both anatomical 
structures and pathologic processes. Anatomic structures with physiologic uptake and pathologic 
abnormalities are likely to be characterized by [CONTACT_256552] -activity curves  [3]. Therefore, the 
pharmacokinetic relationship between tumor activity and a variety of tissue background activity is 
important, which is best understood from dynamic images. Dynamic imaging of cancer subjects 
pre- and post -treatment  is expected to provide data to establish this relationship  between tumor 
and background, as well as the effect of treatment on the relationship .  
While u nderstanding t umor vs background activity in cancer patients  is important, such subjects 
are likely to have  prior or ongoing treatment , which may affect accurate baselining . Therefore, 
understanding normal tissue activity  in healthy volunteers in whom radiotracer distribution  is 
likely unencumbered by [CONTACT_256553] . In addition, healthy volunteers are likely to tolerate the long dynamic scan 
better than cancer subjects, improving the chances of obtaining standard baseline data.      
Available PET/CT scanners can obtain dynamic images only on a portion of the body as large as 
their axial field of view, generally anywhere between 15 -30 cm. The 194 cm long uEXPLORER 
total- body PET scanner is the world’s first device to offer the ability to tomographically image all 
parts of the body simultaneously. Thus, the uEXPLORER PET/CT (now commercially available 
and with FDA 510(k) clearance) is the only scanner in the world capable of acquiring total -body 
dynamic images.  
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 2-4 healthy volunteers will undergo [18F]F-AraG dynamic imaging on the 
uEXPLORER total body PET/CT scanner to obtain preliminary data regarding pharmacokinetics 
and early biodistribution images. In addition, 2- [ADDRESS_311922]-
of-care PD-1/PD -L1 immunotherapy will undergo [18F]F-AraG dynamic imaging similarly on the 
uEXPLORER total body PET/CT scanner to obtain data regarding pharmacokinetics of the tracer 
in tumor lesions in the context of normal tissue uptake. An optional second similar scan will be performed 7-[ADDRESS_311923] dose of immunotherapy to e xplore and document any treatment 
related changes in [
18F]F-AraG  uptake and kinetics. 
The study and data collected will be important to recommend an ideal time to acquire a whole body static scan using conventional and widely available PET/CT scanners for adequate tumor to background contrast and quantification, which in turn, will be essential for further clinical development of [
18F]F-AraG to aid  the monitoring of anti -tumor immune responses .

 STUDY DESIGN  
Protocol CST -FARAG- 203 is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_256537] u EXPLORER total -body PET/CT system to 
acquire dynamic [18F]F-AraG scan data in healthy individuals and patients with NSCLC.  
Screening will consist of eligibility confirmation, the patient signing the consent form, and any 
assessments outlined in the study calendars below.  This will also include a query about status and 
date of COVID -19 vaccination.   
Eligible healthy subjects will undergo a single dynamic [18F]F-AraG PET/CT scan  (of duration up 
to 90- minutes) on the uEXPLORER PET/CT scanner  within [ADDRESS_311929] .  There will be a follow -up visit or call 7 days 
after the scan to assess any AEs that could be attributed to either the scan or the administration of [
18F]F-AraG . 
Eligible subjects with NSCLC who are planned to receive PD -1/PD -L1 immunotherapy will 
undergo a pre -therapy dynamic [18F]F-AraG PET/CT scan , and an optional post -therapy (first dose 
only) dynamic [18F]F-AraG PET/CT scan  on the uEXPLORER total -body scanner .  
For each enrolled patient, [18F]F-AraG will be administered by a licensed Nuclear Medicine 
technologist under the supervision of a board -certified Nuclear Medicine physician (ABNM or 
ABR certified) on an outpatient basis.  It will be administered as a single bolus injection of 5 mCi +/-20% IV into a vein. Vital signs will be assessed just prior to and after completion of dynamic 
[
18F]F-AraG PET scan.   
[18F]F-ARAG/NSCLC   Clinical Study Protocol: CST -FARAG -203

 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 Study DRUG: [18F]F-AraG 
6.1.1 Manufacture  
[18F]fluoride (n.c.a.) in [18O]water is passed through a PS -HCO [ADDRESS_311935] solution containing Kryptofix222 (15 mg) and K 2CO 3 3.5 mg) in 10:1 
acetonitrile/water.  The K222/K[18F]F complex is heated and dried under Helium at 65 °C for 
3 minutes, followed by [CONTACT_223431] 95 ºC for 1  minute.  After cooling to ~50 ºC, a solution 
containing [18F]F-AraG trifylate precursor (6  mg in 1 mL DMSO) is added to the reactor and the 
solution heated to 115 °C for 45 minutes.  After cooling down to ~40 °C, to the reaction mixture 
was added so dium methoxide, and heated at 100 ºC for 10 minutes.  Reaction i s cooled to 40 ºC 
and after addition of 0.5 mL of 1  N HCl stirred at 95  ºC for 10 minutes.  The reaction mixture i s 
then cooled to 30 ºC and diluted with a solution of 0.5 mL of 1N NaHCO 3 in 9.5 mL of water 
(SV3). The solution in the reactor i s transferred through 4 ×  C-18 cartridges via a V31 valve and 
collected in a waste container.  The cartridges are  backwash ed to the reactor with 2  mL of methanol 
in the pre -HPLC tube.  Methanol i s removed under vacuum with the flow of helium at 90 ºC for 
13 minutes.  After cooling the reactor to 30 ºC water i s added and the solution transferred through 
a 0.45 µm filter into a pre -HPLC container.  
Crude  [18F]F-AraG is injected on to a HPLC Luna C18 semi -preparative reversed -phase column 
(5 µm, 10 ×  250 mm).  The desired product fraction (Rt ~ 16 minutes) is collected into  the round 
bottom flask pre -filled with 30  mL of water.  The diluted fraction is passed through the C18 plus 
cartridges and rinsed with water (10 mL), then the trapped product is  eluted by [CONTACT_96158] (1 mL) into 
a collection vial for subsequent dilution with saline (9 mL).  [18F]F-AraG for Injection is prepared 
by [CONTACT_256554] a  0.22 µm Millex GV sterile filter to a pre -assembled septum -sealed sterile 
collection vial (30  mL) for filtration and sterilization.  The final sterile empty vial, product needle, 
vent needle, 4 mm GV filter for vent and sterile GV filter (33  mm) are assembled in a sterile LFH 
(laminar flow hood).  The final product is released compliant to release specifications as submitted 
to the FDA . No further testing is required at the research site prior to injection. 
[18F]F-AraG  will be supplied by [CONTACT_256555].  
6.1.2 Availability  
The [18F]F-AraG will be synthesized, on a per scan basis, under cGMP at one of CellSight’s 
identified qualified production site s.  All qualified production sites are  FDA -approved clinical 
manufacturer s of the tracer. Cellsight carries the IND.  Cellsight submitted all the manufacturing 
CMCs to the FDA for all  approved site s.  As needed, the facility staff will be trained by [CONTACT_256556]. Please refer to CellSight Pharmacy Manual.

 uEXPLORER PET/CT Scan  
For the purpose of this study, [18F]F-AraG  PET/CT scan images must only be acquired on the 
uEXPLORER scanner and that scanner must undergo regular Quality Control (QC) checks. 
Documentation of such QC activities must be available upon request or audit. Image acquisition will be obtained in l ist mode and the raw data saved to allow for virtual radioactive dose 
reconstruction at a later date.  
 
 RISKS TO SUBJECTS  
7.1.1 Risks from [18F]F-AraG  PET/CT scan  
In this study, 2-4 healthy subjects and 2- 4 NSCLC  patients will undergo research PET/CT imaging 
with [18F]F-AraG as specified in the experimental imaging section.  [18F]F-AraG PET imaging has 
been performed on 6 healthy volunteers in a separate study with no drug- related side effects.   In 
addition, [18F]F-AraG has been administered to [ADDRESS_311937] few , if any, adverse effects  from  
[18F]F-AraG  administration in this study . Presently there are no standard surrogate biomarkers  or 
imaging modalities that can substitute for these procedures.  The alternative will be for the patient to withdraw from the imaging study.   
The safety monitoring practices employed by [CONTACT_256563]’ 
safety and should detect all Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs). An indirect health 
benefit to the subjects enrolled in this trial is the free medical te sts received at screening and during 
the study. 
Due to the (up to) 90- minute long scan time through which the participants are expected to remain 
still, the patients may feel discomfort and/or fatigue from laying on the scanner table. In addition, 
they may experience claustrophobia from being inside the  scanner bore, which is a partially 
enclosed space.  
Another risk is possible bruising and/or infection at the IV site .

Department of Radiology   
Confidential   Page 25 of 43 Reproductive Risks are associated with PET: (PET) radiotracers studies on the fetus (unborn child) 
have not been done. To avoid risk to the fetus, it is important that female participants not become pregnant while they are participating in this research st udy. Avoiding sexual activity is the only 
certain method to prevent pregnancy. However, if they choose to be sexually active, they should use an appropriate “double barrier” method of birth control (such as female use of a diaphragm, intrauterine device (I UD), or contraceptive sponge, in addition to male use of a condom) or the 
female should be using prescribed “birth control” pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, or implants. Such birth control methods should be used for as specified by [CONTACT_256564]. If they choose to be sexually active during this study, even with the use of these birth control measures pregnancy could still result . The risks of participation in the research PET studies while 
pregnant include potential loss of pregnancy or possible birth defects. If participant is a woman 18-
[ADDRESS_311938] immediately the study doctor . 
It is possible that uEXPLORER PET/CT scans may detect false positive findings that may 
require further follow -up (clinical, imaging  or surgical) with all the risks associated with these 
follow -up procedures.  The PET/CT images created for this study are for research and are not 
meant to evaluate subject health, as they would be if they were part of a clinical (non- research) 
visit to the doctor or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The images will not receive any routine clinical review  by 
[CONTACT_115310]/CT scans. This means that some findings may be overlooked or 
misinterpreted.  However, if the PET/CT technologists do notice findings that caus e concern, 
they will notify the Study Radiologist.   Additionally, if a member of the research team notices 
any findings that cause concern while conducting image review for study purposes, they will notify the Study Radiologist. The Study Radiologist will  conduct a brief review of part of the 
study images for quality purposes.   If the Study Radiologist thinks a clinical problem is present, one of the IRB -approved study physicians will discuss these possible problems with the subject 
within 8 weeks or imme diately upon recognition of any critical finding that requires immediate 
and/or urgent intervention as described in the Department of Radiology Critical Findings policy (full dataset of images are sometimes not available for review in less than 3 days).  U pon written 
request, we will provide the subject with a copy of a subset of their CT images to take to the 
physician of their choosing. A subset of PET images may also be shared with the subject unless 
the images from the study are clinically uninterpretab le. In addition, the sponsor may restrict 
sharing of PET images due to the nature of the research protocol or to protect intellectual property (e.g. proprietary radiotracers). We will send a standard letter to the designated licensed medical provider ident ified by [CONTACT_423], unless one of the study physicians is part of the 
subject’s care.  The standard letter will state that (i) the subject’s images were acquired exclusively for a research study and incidental findings that may be related to a medical condition were observed by a UC Davis radiologist; (ii) the images did not receive any dedicated 
[18F]F-ARAG /NSCLC   Clinical Study Protocol: CST -FARAG -203

subject’s physician can contact [CONTACT_45101]’s findings.  
7.1.2 Radiation Risk  
Each patient will receive up to two 5 mCi +/- 20% doses of [
18F]F-AraG.   Dosimetry assessment 
estimated an effective dose of 0.58 and 0.62 mSv/mCi for males and females, respectively.  Risks 
from the PET/CT itself include additional radiation exposure from the CT attenuation correction scan ( estimated to be [ADDRESS_311940]

 OUTCOME MEASURES AND ANALYSIS  
 Physiological Time -Activity Curves of [18F]F-AraG Uptake within Healthy Tissues  
One of the primary objectives of the study is to obtain baseline pharmacokinetic information in 
the form of [18F]F‑AraG uptake in healthy tissues as a function of time. To achieve this outcome, 
data on [18F]F‑AraG uptake in several tissue types will be collected from healthy subjects. This 
data will be presented in the form of time -activity curves (TAC) generated for each tissue type.   
 Time -Activity Curves of [18F]F-AraG Uptake within Tumors and Background 
Tissues  
Another  objective  of the study is to obtain pharmacokinetic information in cancer subjects  in the 
form of relative [18F]F-AraG uptake in tumor lesions and background tissues as a function of time. 
To achieve this outcome, data on [18F]F-AraG uptake in tumor lesions and background activity in 
[18F]F-ARAG /NSCLC   Clinical Study Protocol: CST -FARAG -203 
  Version 1.4: 04.23.202 4 
Department of Radiology   
Confidential   Page 28 of 43 the same  tissue s as in Section 10.1 will be collected . This data will be similarly presented in the 
form of time -activity curves (TAC) generated for each tissue type as in Section  10.1, as well as for 
tumor lesions against their background tissues . 
 Recommended time post [18F]F-AraG infusion to acquire a single static PET/CT 
scan  
The TAC analysis of [18F]F-AraG uptake will provide insight into the earliest time to achieve 
adequate tumor versus non- malignant background tissue activity, as well as time to reach and 
remain in steady state up to 90 minutes. Such information can guide a recommendation for the  
ideal time window for a static [18F]F-AraG PET scan for future trials and potential clinical use.  
 Change in PET signal pre - and post - first dose of PD -1/PD -L1 immunotherapy  
For NSCLC subjects who undergo two [18F]F-AraG PET/CT scans, the signal at a static time point 
post [18F]F-AraG infusion (obtained from the result of one of the outcome measures; Section 10.3) 
from both scans will be observed for trends.  
 Safety Outcome Measures  
• Incidence of Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (AEs).  
• Incidence of withdrawals due to AEs. 
• Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
Analyses of safety outcomes will be conducted using the safety population. Adverse events will 
be coded using MedDRA. Treatment Emergent AE’s (TEAE) are defined as events with an onset on or after the first treatment. TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_256566], System Organ Class, and preferred term. The following TEAE summaries will be provided:  
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_86953]  
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_78487]. 
In addition, separate summaries of serious adverse events, and adverse events resulting in discontinuation of study treatment will be presented. 
 Efficacy Outcome Analysis  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the characteristics of study participants, including their age, gender, primary tumor sites and clinical stages, concomitant medications, etc.  Frequency tables will be used to summarize categorical variables.  Median and inter -quartile ranges wi ll be 
used to describe no- normally distributed continuous variables.  Mean and standard deviation will 
be used to summarize normally distributed continuous variables.  
Feasibility will be assessed per patient basis.  The percentage of patients who can be successfully evaluated by [
18F]F-AraG PET imaging will be computed and summarized.

 SAFETY REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 Assessment of Safety  
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE, as provided in this protocol.  During the study when there is a 
safety evaluation, the Investigator or site staff will be res ponsible for detecting, documenting and 
reporting AEs and SAEs as detailed in this Section of the protocol.  
 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or disease that 
occurs or is reported by [CONTACT_11563], or a worsening of a pre -existing condition.  
An adverse event may or may not be related to the study tre atment.  
AEs will be elicited through direct questioning and subject reports. Any abnormality in physical 
examination findings or laboratory results that the investigator believes is clinically significant to 
the research subject and that occurred after initiation of the first study treatment will be reported 
as AEs. Abnormal findings that are NOT clinically significant should not be recorded as an AE.

  Version 1.4: 04.23.202 4 
Department of Radiology   
Confidential   Page 31 of 43 
 Reporting of Adverse Events  
Report initiation for all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) will begin immediately after the 
first infusion of [18F]F-AraG (Visit 2) and continue until the Day 7 follow up. The Day 7 adverse 
event assessment may be telephonic and does not require an office visit. All events will be followed to resolution or until they are considered to be not clinically significant according to the investigator’s judgment.   
All AEs must be recorded in the subject’s medical records and on the CRF. AEs will be reported 
using customary medical terminology along with the following information:  the onset and end dates, whether the event is at the site of [
18F]F-AraG administration, whether the event is 
considered to be a SAE, the impact the event had on study treatment, the CTCAE grade (intensity) 
of the event, the causality of the event, whether treatment was given as a result of the event, and 
the outcome of the event.  
Serious Adverse Events 
An AE should be classified as an SAE if any of the following criteria are met: 
• It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death).  
• It is life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.). 
• It requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
• It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother 
exposed to the investigational treatment. 
• It is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_13656] (e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above).  
 Methods and Timing for Assessing and Recording Safety Variables  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or reported 
during the study are collected and reported to the FDA in accordance with CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports).  
 Assessment of Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_15480], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other means will be reported appropriately. Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and

Confidential   Page 32 of 43 end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the 
investigational treatment (see following guidance), and actions taken. 
The guidelines outlined in CTCAE v5.0 will be used for assessing the intensity of the event. The 
general guidelines for assessing the AE grade appear below.  Full guidelines may be obtained at https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_Reference_5x7.pdf  
 
Table 3: CTCAE v5.0 General Guidelines  
Grade  Description  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)*.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self care ADL†.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE.‡  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
†Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.  
‡Unlike the AE outcome assessment (see Section Error! Reference source not found.), a subject may have more than one 
Grade 5 event.  
 
-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), v5.0: November 27, 2017 
 
 Causality 
Adverse events will be assigned a relationship (causality) to the study treatment.  The Investigator 
will be responsible for determining the relationship between an AE and the study treatment.  The 
type of event, organ system affected, and timing of onset of the event will be factors in assessing 
the likelihood that an AE is r elated to the study treatment.  Relationship of AEs to study treatment 
will be classified as follows: 
 Not Related :  No relationship exists between the AE and the treatment.  The event is 
attributed to a pre -existing medical condition or an intercurrent event unrelated to the 
study product. 
 P ossibly Related :  Follows the treatment but may have developed as a result of an 
underlying clinical condition or treatments/interventions unrelated to the study product. 
 P robably Related :  Follows the treatment but is unlikely to have developed as a result 
[18F]F-ARAG/NSCLC   Clinical Study Protocol: CST -FARAG -203 
  Version 1.4: 04.23.[ADDRESS_311948]’s underlying clinical condition or other treatment or other interventions. 
 Definitely Related :  Follows the treatment and physical evidence shows a convincing 
relationship to the treatment.  
 
 Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
The Investigator is required to report all SAEs.  Once the Investigator becomes aware of an SAE, 
he/she must report the SAE to CellSight within 24 hours at: 
Phone: [PHONE_5342] Email: [EMAIL_4949]  
 
The CellSight Medical Monitor may request additional supporting documentation as it becomes 
available, such as lab reports, ECG reports, discharge summary, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11533], etc.  
The Investigator is also responsible for reporting all SAEs to the appropriate Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) in accordance with local laws and regulations. The Investigator is responsible for 
maintaining documentation in the study file that indicates the IRB has been properly notified. Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), the sponsor is required to notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report (i.e., 7- or 15- day expedited report) of potentially serious risks from clinical 
trials or any other source as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days after the spons or 
receives the safety information and determines that the information qualifies for reporting. Participating investigators include all investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under any of its INDs or under any investigator’s IND (21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)).  
 
 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 Monitoring Requirements  
In an effort to fulfill the obligations outlined in 21 CFR Part 312 and ICH guidelines which require 
the Sponsor to maintain current personal knowledge of the progress of a study, the Sponsor's designated monitor will visit the center(s) during the study a s well as maintain frequent telephone 
and written communication. The Investigator will permit the Sponsor to monitor the study as frequently as is deemed necessary and provide access to medical records to ensure that data are being recorded adequately, tha t data are verifiable and that protocol adherence is satisfactory.  
The Investigator will permit representatives of the Sponsor and/or designated CRO to inspect all CRFs and corresponding study subject original medical records (source documents) at regular intervals throughout the study. Subject original medical records and other relevant data must be 
available to support all data recorded in the CRF. In addition to the original medical records, these 
data may include but are not limited to, study, laboratory and diagnostic reports, wound images and tracings, etc.  
[18F]F-ARAG /NSCLC   Clinical Study Protocol: CST -FARAG -203 
  Version 1.4: 04.23.[ADDRESS_311949]'s visit. Corrections to data on the 
CRFs will be made according to standard data correction procedures. The Investigator will review 
CRFs to indicate that, to his/her knowledge, they are complete and accurate. CRFs may be reviewed by [CONTACT_1034]’s or designated CRO’s monitor, who will make a decision as to their acceptability.   
 Modification of Protocol  
The Investigator will not modify or alter this protocol without first obtaining the concurrence of the Sponsor. Approval by [CONTACT_737]’s IRB must also be obtained prior to implementation of the change, with two exceptions:  
1. When necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to the subject; or  
2. When the modification does not involve the subject’s participation in the trial. 
An amendment may also require modification of the ICF. The Investigator will provide an approval letter for the amendment and revised ICF, if applicable, to the Sponsor. An amendment must be in writing and dated by [CONTACT_12573]. If necessary, the Sponsor will submit protocol amendments to FDA and other appr opriate regulatory authorities. 
 Reporting Protocol Deviations  
The Investigator is obligated to follow the protocol without departure from the requirements written in the protocol. If the Investigator deems a deviation from the protocol requirements is necessary for a particular subject, the Sponsor will be notified a nd consulted prior to the subject’s 
continuation in the study. The Sponsor also has the right to discontinue the subject for protocol violations. The IRB may also have to be contact[CONTACT_256569]. All protocol deviations must be documented in the CRFs. 
 Subject Premature Withdrawal from Study  
A subject who is enrolled into the study but does not complete the study will be considered prematurely discontinued.  
[18F]F-ARAG /NSCLC   Clinical Study Protocol: CST -FARAG -203 
  Version 1.4: 04.23.[ADDRESS_311950], study treatment or observations were discontinued, the reason(s) w ill be recorded and the Sponsor should 
be notified promptly. All efforts must be made to collect data and report records and test results as completely as possible. Reasons for subject withdrawal/discontinuation may constitute one of the following:  
 
• Subject withdrew consent  
• Subject chooses to withdraw from study 
• Subject is withdrawn due to an AE  
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow -up  
• The Investigator determines that it is in the subject’s best interest 
• Excessive protocol deviations, as determined by [CONTACT_737]  
• Discontinuation of study by [CONTACT_256570]:  
1. Subjects may drop out or be withdrawn at their own request. Although subjects do not need 
to give a reason for requesting withdrawal from the trial, the Investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject's rights. 
2. Any subjects reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that have not resolved by [CONTACT_256571] [ADDRESS_311951] follow -up information. The reason for withdrawal 
from the study (if known) will be recorded in the source documents and on the appropriate page 
of the CRF.  
4. Before a subject is identified as lost -to-follow -up, the site should make all reasonable 
efforts to contact [CONTACT_423]. These attempts must be documented and should include at a minimum one phone call and one follow -up certified letter.  
 
 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING COMMITTEE  
In addition to the requirements for adverse event reporting as outlined in Section 11.0, this protocol is also subject to the UC Davis Cancer Center’s (UCDCC) Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. The UCDCC is committed to pursuing high- quality patient -oriented clinical research and has 
established mechanisms to ensure both scientific rigor and patient safety in the conduct of clinical 
research studies. The UCDCC relies on a multi -tiered committee system that reviews and monitors 
all cancer clinical trials and e nsures the safety of its participants, in compliance with institutional 
[18F]F-ARAG /NSCLC   Clinical Study Protocol: CST -FARAG -203 
  Version 1.4: 04.23.202 4 
Department of Radiology   
Confidential   Page 36 of 43 and federal requirements on adverse event (AE) reporting, verification of data accuracy, and 
adherence to protocol eligibility requirements, treatment guidelines, and related matters. The Scientific Review Committee (SRC) assumes overall oversight of cancer studies, with assistance and input from two independent, but interacting, committees: the Quality Assurance Committee and the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee. A multi -level review system strengthens the 
ability of the UCDCC to fulfill its mission in  conducting high quality clinical cancer research.  
According to the UCDCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, any new serious adverse events related to the drugs being used on this trial are reviewed monthly by [CONTACT_256572], if 
necessary.  
The UCDCC SRC determines if a UCDCC Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is 
required.  If required, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will appoint a DSMB. The 
DSMB is responsible for reviewing study accrual logs, adverse event information and dos e 
escalation meeting minutes (where applicable) to ensure subject safety and compliance with protocol defined guidelines. 
Results of the DSMC audit will be communicated to CellSight, IRB and the appropriate regulatory 
authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as needed.

Confidential   Page 43 of 43 Appendix 2: Study Registration and Participant visits  
A. The subject will sign and date the Informed Consent Form (ICF), and Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization (according to site’s practices) prior 
to any study- related procedures with the exception of the standard- of-care ( SOC) 
diagnostic/tumor staging CT or MRI that would be accepted for imaging review to assess 
eligibility of NSCLC subjects, if done within 45 days prior to Visit 2.  
B. Once signed, informed consent has been obtained; patients will be entered on study.  To 
register a patient, the study coordinator must complete the Eligibility Checklist.  The study 
coordinator will register the patient onto the study and assign a unique a n Enrollment ID before 
initiation of the study drug administration.   
C. Pre-study laboratory tests must be completed prior to registration within the time frame 
specified in the protocol.   
D. A subject failing to meet all protocol requirements may not be registered.  If you have any 
questions regarding eligibility, please contact [CONTACT_256578] [INVESTIGATOR_216700]  
E. Unscheduled visits may be required in addition to the scheduled visits per the Investigator’s 
discretion. The details of these unscheduled visits with subjects will be recorded in the medical 
records and on the Case Report Form (CRF).  
F. If a subject misses a visit, the site is to make every effort to have the subject return as soon as possible to make up the visit. Once the subject is seen, he/she is to return to his/her original 
visit schedule. 
G. A subject who has signed the consent form but does not receive any [
18F]F-AraG infusion is 
classified as a screen failure. Subject number, demographic information, and reason for screen 
failure will be collected.  
H. A subject who is classified as a screen failure will be replaced. A subject who does not receive 
at least one infusion of [18F]F-AraG  and the associated PET/CT scans will also be replaced.

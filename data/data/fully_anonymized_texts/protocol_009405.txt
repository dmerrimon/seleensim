Rationale  Administrative change s to clearly document new version.  
 
Section / Page  Section in Protocol Synopsis: Study duration  
Rationale  The initial anticipated “Completion of the data analysis ” date of October 2019 has been 
exceeded  due to a handful of patients who still benefit from the study drug. P rotocol Version 
5.0 provides a new expected date . 
  
Section / Page  Section 3.2: Study duration  
Rationale  Update to reduce the study procedures.  
Since the  Development International Birth Date  of 13 January 2015,  until the cutoff date 12 
January 2022,  a total of 363 cancer patients had been treated with MCLA -128 in 2 Clinical 
Trials.  So far, the safety profile  including identified  (IRRs)  and potential risks  (Diarrhea and 
decreased cardiac ejection fraction)  associated with MCLA -[ADDRESS_490827] 24 months in this study , to reduce the study procedures in order to  
decrease the ir burden , but to offer the opportunity to continually  derive  benefit from the  
Study drug . The Sponsor will continue to   monitor   Safety and efficacy , either via an 
alternative “post -study  or Expanded access ” program or via the implementation of Protocol 
Version 5.0. This will allow an expedited analysis of study results, while  maintaining an 
appropriate level of safety surveillance.  
 
Section / Page  Summary of study procedures  
Rationale  The replacement of c olumn s Study treatment period, End of Treatment  
Visit and Follow -Up period, to reduce t he study procedure s for the patients remaining on the 
study.   
Patients transferring into the alternative program will follow a similar treatment plan.

STUDY DESIGN  
A phase [ADDRESS_490834] cancer (MBC) populations, HER2 -positive/amplified 
(Cohort 1) and ER -positive/low HER2 expression (Cohort 2).  Three combination treatment s will be 
evaluated , two in Cohort 1 an d one in Cohort 2 , in 20-30 sites in 7  countries in Europe and the [LOCATION_003] . 
Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, 11 April 2022  
 
 
 
PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 127 Cohort 1:  Patients with HER2 -positive/amplified MBC, having confirmed HER2 overexpression by 
[CONTACT_9064] (IHC) 3+ or IHC 2+ combined  with positive fluorescence in situ  hybridization (FISH), 
who have been treated  with  up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_490835] prior line of therapy should be made available  when possible . 
Initially MCLA -128 will be administered with t rastuzumab (doublet combination). Safety will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_223233] (IDMC). After the safety of the doublet has been assessed, 
MCLA -128 + trastuzumab + vinorelbine (triplet combination) will be evaluated in parallel with t he doublet 
combination (see figure below).  
The doublet and triplet Cohort 1 combinations will both be evaluated in two steps with an initial safety run -
in in 4 to 6 patients  who will be  review ed by [CONTACT_31849] , followed by a cohort efficacy expansion, as 
described below. The triplet combination go/no -go decision will be made by [CONTACT_391158] -in patients . If the triplet combination is considered safe, t he expansion of the 
doublet and triplet  combinations will be performed  in parallel . Patients with be included with a 3:1 ratio for 
triplet or doublet respectively , favoring the triplet combination  and taking into account previous exposur e 
to vinorelbine . 
Study design for Cohort 1 combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (doublet and triplet)  
 
Safety run -in: After [ADDRESS_490836] 2 complete cycles (6 weeks) of MCLA -128 + 
trastuzumab, a safety review will be performed  by [CONTACT_31849] . If the doublet combination is considered safe, 
the safety run -in for the triplet combination will be initiated  in the next [ADDRESS_490837] 2 complete 
cycles (6 weeks) of MCLA -128 + tra stuzumab + vinorelbine.  
Based on the observed safety in the first 4 -6 patients (adverse events [AEs], serious adverse events [SAEs], 
relationship to study drug, and other clinically relevant parameters [e.g. laboratory parameters], available 
PK, immunogeni city, and cytokine data) the  IDMC,  investigators and Sponsor will decide on a potential 
additional run -in period for each combination (i.e. doublet and triplet).  
Expansion:  After the safety run -in, each Cohort 1 combination therapy considered tolerable by [CONTACT_391159] a total of up to 40 patients evaluable  for efficacy.  
If the doublet combination regimen is not tolerated, Cohort 1 will be closed. If the triplet combination is not 
well tolerated but the doublet is acceptable, the doublet expansion will be continued.  
Cohort 2:  Patients with ER -positive and low HER2 expression MBC (IHC 1+, or IHC 2+ combined with 
negative FISH) who have radiologic or  photographic evidence of  disease progression  on the last line of prior 
endocrine therapy (a dministered for at least 12 weeks) that included an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant. 
Patients who have received up to [ADDRESS_490838] progressed 
on a cyclin -dependent kinase inhibitor (in any line) are elig ible. For enrollment, HER2 and HR status and  
radiologic /photographic  documentation of prior progression will be based on medical records. Eligibility will 
be confirmed as soon as possible for HER2/HR status by [CONTACT_391160]. Patients found to be ineligible retrospectively will not be evaluable for the 
primary objective and may be replaced.

progressiv e disease is radiologically /photographically  documented. A total of up to 4 0 patients evaluable for 
efficacy will be included.  
 
Study design for Cohort 2 combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_391125] (IDMC) , composed of at least 2  physicians  expert  in the 
domain of early clinical development in MBC , will review safety and efficacy throughout the study and 
decide on the addition of extra patients in the expansion parts, opening of the triple combination cohorts, 
and any ad hoc  safet y decisions. The principal investigators, the Sponsor’s medical expert(s) and other 
representatives may be called upon to assist as observers .

evaluation of the study drug , including s upportive treatment of symptoms and AEs or standard 
treatment of concomitant conditions  may be given at the investigator’s discretion.  
• Goserelin in p re/peri -menopausal women who started an LHRH agonist >4 weeks prior to study entry . 
Prohibited  
• Concomitant c hronic oral corticosteroids  (>10 mg/day prednisone equivalent) , TNF -alpha inhibitors, 
anti-T-cell antibodies (du e to risk of immunosuppression).  
• Any investigational drugs during the study or [ADDRESS_490855] dose of study treatment . 
• Systemic anticancer therapy (other than the last endocrine therapy in Cohort 2)  or yellow fever vaccine 
(Cohort 1) during the study or  within [ADDRESS_490856] dose of study treatment . 
SAFETY / TOLERABILITY ASSESSMENTS  
• AEs (CTCAE version 4.03), SAEs  
• Lab parameters: hematology, biochemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, cytokines  
• ECG, MUGA/ECHO  
• Medical history, vital signs, performance status and physical exam  
• Concomitant medications  
• Dose modifications (reductions, interruptions, delays), discontinuation due to toxicity  
EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
Tumor assessment will be based on CT/MRI with contras t per RECIST 1.1, every [ADDRESS_490857](s) will be performed for all patients  (screening and on -study) .  
 
Enough independent central analysis of patient imaging has been completed and additional assessment of 
imaging for those patients  currently on treatment for at least [ADDRESS_490858](s) for all patients on -study  is no longer applicable 
as of Protocol Version 5.0. 
 
Bone scans will be performed as clinically indicated  for patients with bone metastases at baseline  or 
suspected lesions on study.  
Tumor markers ( CA15 -3, CEA, CA27 -29) will be assessed on Day 1 every cycle.  
BIOMARKERS  
Candidate exploratory biomarkers will be evaluated in tumor tissue (screening, optional after 12 weeks  and 
End of Treatment  [EOT] ) and blood (pre-dose on Day 1 every 4 cycles and EOT). 
Enough biomarker data has been a ccumulated from all patients  treated  on the tri al. Therefore the 
additional data from the few patients who have been on treatment for 24 months is not needed  as per 
Protocol Version 5.0. 
 
Tumor:  HER2, HER3, HER2:HER3 dimerization, downstream signaling proteins (eg PIK3CA), heregulin, 
phosphoryl ation of HER2, HER3 and proteins in the MAPK and AKT signaling pathway, expression of 
inhibitors such as PTEN, mutations in cancer -related genes including HER2 and HER3 signaling, heregulin -
gene fusions.  
Blood:  Fc receptor polymorphism, plasma circulating  tumor DNA mutations, exploratory serum biomarkers 
(e.g. soluble HER2, heregulin).  
PHARMACOKINETICS  
PK sampling is no longer applicable as of Protocol Version 4.0. 
For Protocol Versions 1 .0, 2.0 and 3.0 , blood samples will be collected t o measure serum MCLA -128 and 
trastuzumab exposure. No PK sampling will be performed for vinorelbine, fulvestrant or aromatase 
inhibitors.  
PK sampling will be performed at the following time points:  
Cohort 1 doublet and triplet combinations: MCLA -128 
• Cycle  1: Day 1, pre -dose, EOI, and at 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_490859] EOI, then at any time on Day 8 ( or Day 9

Anti-MCLA -128 antibody sampling is no longer applicable as of Protocol Version 4.0. 
For Protocol Versions 1 .0, 2.0 and 3.0 , blood samples (5 mL) will be collected in all patients to assess serum 
titers of anti -MCLA -128 antibodies pre -dose on Day 1 pre -dose for Cycles 1, 3, 5, every 4 cycles thereafter, 
and EOT. 
CYTOKINES  
Blood samples  will be collected to analyze a serum cytoki ne panel (TNFα, IFNγ, IL -1β, IL -6, IL-8, IL-10) in the 
safety run -in patients of Cohort 1 only as follows  (no cytokine ev aluation is planned in Cohort 2) : 
Cohort 1 doublet combination (run -in only):  
• Cycle 1: Day 1, pre -dose, 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_490862] end of infusion (EOI) of MCLA -128 
• Cycle 1: Day 2, pre -dose, [ADDRESS_490863] -EOI of trastuzumab  
• Cycle 2: Day 1, pre -dose, 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_490864] -EOI of MCLA -128 
Cohort 1 triplet combination (run -in only):  
• Cycles 1 and 2: Day 1, pre -dose, 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_490865] -EOI of MCLA -128 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Sample size  
Cohort 1 safety run -in: [ADDRESS_490866] an AE with a 
true incidence of 33% is 80 to 90%.  
Cohort 1 efficacy expansion:  [ADDRESS_490867] adequate 
precision to exclude 30% (lower limit of 90% CI > 30%). The threshold for the CBR rate at 24 weeks is 
defined based on the assumption that PFS follows an exponential distribution  with a median of 5 months 
(clinically relevant) and 3.5 months (not clinically relevant) .  
Cohort 2:  [ADDRESS_490868] 45% will provide enough precision to exclude 
30% (lower limit of 90% CI>30%). The threshold for CBR at  24 weeks is defined based on the assumption 
that PFS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 5 months (clinically relevant) and 3.5 months 
(not clinically relevant).  
The final number of patients will depend on the safety and eff icacy outcomes  during the study. U p to ~130 
patients are anticipated, allowing for  a total of 40 patients in each of the three planned combination 
regimens and a  ~10% rate of non -evaluable patients.  
Definitions  
All efficacy endpoints will be defined and analyzed based o n tumor assessment by [CONTACT_393] 1.1.  
CBR: the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR or SD ≥ 24 weeks.  
ORR: the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR or PR.   
PFS: the time from treatment start until radiologic progress ion or death due to any cause.  
PFS ratio: the ratio  of PFS with the previous regimen to PFS on study treatment.  
DoR: the time from response (CR or PR) until progression or death due to underlying cancer.  
OS: the time from treatment start until death due to  any cause.  
Endpoints  
Primary  
Cohort s 1 and 2 : CBR per investigator radiologic review at 24 weeks  
Key secondary  
Cohort 1:  CBR at 24 weeks per central review, and ORR, PFS, and DoR per investigator and central review  
Cohort 2: CBR at 24 weeks per central  review, and PFS  per investigator and central review  
Other secondary (both cohorts):  
Safety:  Incidence, severity and relationship of AEs, laboratory abnormalities, SAEs, ECG and LV EF 
measurements and vital signs

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 127 Tolerability: discontinuations due to AEs, dose modifications due to AEs, immunogen icity, and cytokine 
assessments  
Other efficacy:  DoR (Cohort 2), PFS ratio (Cohort 2), ORR (Cohort 2),  and OS (Cohorts 1 and 2)  
Pharmacokinetics: Cmax, C0h, AUC, CL, V ss, tmax and t 1/2 for MCLA -128, and  CEOI and C 0h for trastuzumab.  
Analysis populations  
Treated population: patients who receive at least one dose of MCLA -128.  
Evaluable for efficacy: patients who receive at least 2 complete cycles (6 weeks) of treatment and have 
undergone baseline assessment and one on-study tumor assessment, or who discontinue early due to 
disease progression.  
Analyses  
Patient disposition and demographics will be analyzed in the treated population, efficacy will be analyzed in 
the evaluable for efficacy population, and safety will be  analyzed in the treated population.  
Quantitative variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables will be 
presented as N, mean and/or median, standard deviation, range. Categorical variables will be presented 
using frequenci es and percentage.  
Criteria for success primary endpoint for Cohorts 1 and 2:  A median PFS of  5 months  is assumed as relevant, 
with the activity threshold for CBR at 24 weeks set to 45%.  
CBR and ORR will be summarized with accompanying 90% exac t binomial C I.  
For PFS, OS and DoR the survival function will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier product limit method; 
probability estimates and 90% CI will be provided at specified time points; median duration and 90% CI will 
also be provided. DoR will be estimated  for responders only.  The number and proportion of any patients 
with a PFS ratio ≥ 1.3 will be tabulated for Cohort 2 with 90% exact C I. 
AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_67503] (MedDRA®) preferred term and by 
[CONTACT_2021] a ccording to incidence and severity. Severity of AEs will be based on CTCAE 4.03.  
PK, immunogenicity, cytokines and biomarkers will be analyzed centrally and reported  separately .

S[LOCATION_003]R  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
t1/[ADDRESS_490894] cancer is a global disease, with a yearly incidence of over 1.67 million patients worldwide  
reported in 2012, accounting  for over 25% of all cancers in women and ranking  as the fifth  cause of 
cancer death in women (522,000 deaths) (IARC/WHO) . In the [LOCATION_002], over 25 0,000 women are 
expected t o develop the disease  in 2017, with  over 40, 010 deaths  (Siegel et al., 2017) .  
Approximately 5 -10% of breast cancer patien ts are diagnosed with metastasis at initial presentation, 
and overall 20% will eventually develop metastasis (Chang et al., 2003) . The development of 
metastases dramatically worsens the prognosis. About 9 0% of breast cancer mortality is due to 
metastases that are resistant to adjuvant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Gonzalez -Angulo et al., 2007) . Metastatic breast 
cancers  (MBC)  represent a heterogeneous population with a diverse clinical course. Median survival 
ranges from [ADDRESS_490895] cancer despi[INVESTIGATOR_391130] (Andre et al., 2004; Giordano et al., 2004; Dawood et 
al., 2008) , and overall survival (OS) rates v ary significantly. This highly unpredictable clinical behavior 
reflects the biologic heterogeneity of the disease, which is cl assified based on the presence or the 
absence  of hormone receptors for estrogen and/or progesterone, and the expression/amplificat ion 
status of the human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2) protein/oncogene  (Hammond et al., 
2010; Wolff et al., 2013) .  
The primary goa ls of systemic treatment for MBC are prolongation of survival, alleviation of 
symptoms, and maintenance or improvement in quality of life, despi[INVESTIGATOR_391131] (Osoba, 1995; Geels et al., 2000; Stockler et al., 2000) . Systemic treatments for MBC incl ude 
chemotherapy, endocrine therapy (ET), biological targeted therapy, and supportive therapy. For 
patients with advanced MBC, the choice of therapy is based on considerations related to patient 
characteristics and comorbidities, disease status, prior trea tments, and biological characteristics of 
the tumor (NCCN, 2017.; Bernard -Marty et al., 2004) .  
1.1.[ADDRESS_490896] Cancer  
Approximately 15% to 20% of breas t cancer tumors overexpress HER 2 (Slamon et al., 1987; Witton et 
al., 2003) , a member of the HER superfamily  composed of tyrosine kinase receptors regulati ng 
proliferation and survival of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]. The family includes four receptors: HER1 (ep idermal 
growth factor receptor [ EGFR ]), HER2 [neu, C -erbB2] , HER3 and HER4. HER2 is considered an orphan 
receptor as it has no known ligand , while  the three other HER receptors have known ligand s and form 
either homodimers or heterodimers upon ligand binding. HER2 can heterodimerize with any of the 
other receptors and is considered the preferred dimerization partner. Dimerization results in 
autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the rece ptor cytoplasmic domain and initiates signal 
transduction via the PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK pathways (Browne et al., 2009; Castaneda et al., 2010) .  
HER2  overexpression/amplification in breast cancers is associated with a more aggressive clinical 
phenotype and historically portends poor prognosis (Slamon et al., 1987) . Although HER2 -
overexpression identifies p atients who are likely to respond to therapy with trastuzumab, not all these 
patients retain benefit from treatment. Approximately 15% of patients relapse after therapy, 
indicating the presence of de novo  or acquired resistance (Nahta and Esteva, 2006) . Several resistance 
mechanisms have been proposed including (1) altered receptor -antibody  interaction, (2) activati on of 
downstream pathways via increased signaling from other HER family members or other receptors, or 
(3) constitutive activation of downstream elements.

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 127 [IP_ADDRESS]  Anti -HER2 A ntibodies  in HER2 -Positive MBC  
The humanized anti -HER2 antibody  trastuzumab (Herceptin ®) impro ves response  rate, PFS and OS 
when added to chemotherapy for advanced HER2 -positive breast cancers (Slamon et al., 2001) . In 
early stage HER2 -positive breast cancer, several pi[INVESTIGATOR_391132] s in disease -
free survival  and OS, and trastuzumab/chemotherapy combination  has now become standard therapy 
for most such cases (O’Sullivan et al., 2015) . Nonetheless  approximately 30 –50% of patients with naïve 
HER2 -positive  MBC do not achieve an objective response in the first -line setting indicating de novo  
resistance to trastuzumab, with both time to progression  (TTP)  and OS being short (7 –17 months and 
22–38 months, respectively) (Slamon et al., 2001; Baselga et al., 2012b; Nielsen et al., 2013; Swain et 
al., 2013) . This has motivated the development of alternat ive approaches to block HER2 signaling.  
Multiple lines of research have highlighted a central role for HER3 signaling as a key mechanism for de 
novo  and acquired resistance to HER2 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_391133]2:HER3 heterodimerization, the mechanism by 
[CONTACT_391163]3 elicits signaling (Jiang et al., 2012) . 
Pertuzumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to a different epi[INVESTIGATOR_391134]2 
extracellular domain (subdomain II) than trastuzumab (subdomai n IV), presumably preventing HER2 
from dimerizing with other HER family members (EGFR, HER3 and HER4), notably HER3. In 2012, 
results from the phase 3  CLEOPATRA study (Clinical Evaluation of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab) led 
to FDA approval for pertuzumab in  combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the treatment of 
patients with HER2 -positive  MBC who have not received prior anti -HER2 or chemotherapy for 
metastatic disease. The primary endpoint of centrally confirmed PFS was significantly longer with the  
addition of pertuzumab, improved  by 6.3 months from a median of 12.4 to 18.5 months ( hazard ratio 
[HR] of 0.62 for progression or death, 95% CI 0.51 –0.75 , p <0.001) (Baselga et al., 2012b) . OS was also 
markedly prolonged with the addition of pertuzumab, with 1 5.7-month increase from 40.8 to 56.5 
months (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 –0.84 , p <0.001) (Swain et al., 2015) , confirming that this  triple drug 
combination  is a promising approach . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  T-DM1 in HER2 -Positive MBC  
Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T -DM1) is a novel antibody drug conjugate composed of trastuzumab 
linked to emtansine (DM1; a derivative of maytansine), a highly potent anti -microtubule cytotoxic 
agent. T -DM1 was granted FDA approval in 2013 for HER2 -positive  MBC progressing  after trastuzumab 
and taxane therapy in the metastatic setting , or following early relap se on adjuvant trastuzumab -
based therapy. Approval was based on the EMILIA trial, a randomized, ope n-label, international phase 
3 trial comparing T -DM1 with lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2 -positive  MBC 
previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane (Verma et al., 2012) . Median PFS was significantly 
prolonged with T -DM1 compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine (9.6 versus 6.4 months; HR for 
progression or death from any cause 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 –0.75 , p <0.001). Median OS was also 
significantly improved with T -DM1 (30.9 versus 25.1 months; HR for death from any cause 0.68, 95% 
CI 0.55 –0.85, p  <0.001) and ORR was higher with T -DM1 (43.6% versus 30.8%, p  <0.001). Based on 
this, T-DM1 is now the standard of care as s econd -line therapy for HER2 -positive  MBC. A second 
randomized, o pen-label, international phase 3  trial (TH3RESA) provided supportive data (Krop et al., 
2017) . For patients progressing  on trastuzumab -based therapy and T -DM1, treatment options inc lude 
trastuzumab with another chemotherapy agent, or with combined capecitabine and lapatinib.  
Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, [ADDRESS_490897] Cancer   
Approximately 75% of breast cancers are considered estrogen and/or progesterone  receptor positive 
(Nadji et al., 2005; Rugo, 2008) . Such tumors are associated with better survival than those with low 
or no estrogen receptor expression (Yu et al., 2012) . The hormone estrogen (17ß -estradiol E2) 
represents the primary stimulant in the growth and development of these tumors (Johnston and 
Dowsett, 2003) . Thus, deprivation of estrogen signaling via ET has become the mainstay of treatment 
for early and metastatic estroge n receptor positive  (ER+)  disease in the absence of visceral crisis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Endocrine Therapy  
A variety of ET options are available, including oophorectomy, gonadotropin -releasing hormone 
analogs, selective estrogen receptor modulators  (SERMs ; tamoxi fen), select ive estrogen receptor 
degraders  (SERDs ; fulvestrant ) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs; letrozole, anastrozole and exemestane) 
(Buzdar and Hortobagyi, 1998; Lumachi et al., 2015) . AIs block estrogen production by [CONTACT_391164], and are only effective for postmenopausal 
women in whom the ma jor source of estrogen comes from the conversion of androgens to estrogens 
via aromatase enzyme activity in peripheral tissues such as adipose tissue and the breast.  Tamoxifen 
was the first selective estrogen receptor modulator used clinically and is still  widely prescribed in pre -
menopausal women.  
The use of hormone therapi[INVESTIGATOR_391135] a mainstay 
of treatment for patients with ER+ breast cancers , and has substantially reduced the relapse rate for 
early -stage breast cancer (Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Coll aborative Group (EBCTCG), 2005) . However 
about one -third of all hormone receptor -positive/HER2 -negative patients diagnosed with early stage 
disease, experience disease recurrence (Baselga et al., 2012b) , and in this setting single -agent AIs or 
tamoxifen show  limited clinical benefit (Klijn et al., 2000; Baselga  et al., 2012a) . Resistance manifests 
as either relapse after treatment of primary hormone receptor -positive breast cancer or as disease 
progression in the metastatic setting (Larionov and Miller, 2009; Dalmau et al., 2014) .  
ET resistance is complex and heterogeneous and may differ from pati ent to patient, between primary 
and acquired resistance and even between ET types. A wide range of distinct mechanisms implica ted 
in ET resistance in breast cancer have been described including 1) ER mutations in the ligand -binding 
domain (Li et al., 2013; Merenbakh -Lamin e t al., 2013; Segal and Dowsett, 2014) , epi[INVESTIGATOR_14364] 
(Parl, 2003; Fan et al., 2006)  or reduced expression (Martínez -Galán et al., 2014) , 2) crosstalk between 
the ER and EGFR/HER2 involving the PI3K -Akt-mTOR and MAPK pathways, with  HER2 overexpression 
confer ring ET resistance , even in t he presence of hormone receptors  (Lupi[INVESTIGATOR_391136]., 2010)  with 
crosstalk resulting  in estrogen recepto r phosphorylation and activation (Campbell et al., 2001; Yam nik 
et al., 2009) , 3) NFKB signaling and inflammation including overexpression in ET -resistant breast 
tumors (Gu et al., 2002; deGraffenried et al., 2004a; Zhu et al., 2006; Morrison et al., 2014) , 4) c ancer 
stem cell development may be resistant to ET due to low estrogen receptor expression , 5) p rolonged 
estrogen deprivation can lead to estrogen hypersensitivity (Herynk et al., 2010) , 6) epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] -
mesenchymal transition with loss of estrogen receptor expression, and 7) i nhibition of phagocytosis 
can re -sensitize resistant cells to tamoxifen (Clarke, 2011) . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CDK4/6  Therapy  
A more recent  strategy in treating ER+ breast cancer is to target cyclin -dependent kinases 4 and 6 
(CDK4/6), a key pathway involved in regulation of the G1/S transition of the cell c ycle. Preclinical 
Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, [ADDRESS_490898] a particular role for CDK4/6 inhibition in ER+ breast cancer cells, including estrogen -
sensitive and estrogen -resistant models. Cyclin D1 amplification is a common event in ER+ breast 
cancer, identifi ed in 58% of hormone re ceptor -positive /HER2 -negative breast cancer  (Cancer Genome 
Atlas Network, 2012) . Antiestrogen -induced growth arrest in ER+ breast cancer  cells is accompanied 
by [CONTACT_345897] D1 expression, whereas the emergence of ET resistance is associated with 
persistent cyclin D1 exp ression and retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation (Watts et al., 1995; 
Thangavel et al., 2011) . Evidence of a continued role for CDK4/6 inhibition in ET-resistant ER+ cells 
comes from in vitro  evaluation of the CDK4/[ADDRESS_490899] activity in ER+ cancers including 
those with conditioned estrogen resistance (Finn et al., 2009) .  
Anti-CDK4/6 agents inhibit the phosphorylation of the Rb tumor suppressor, which promotes Rb -E2F 
binding and prevents E2F -mediated oncogenic transcription. Compelling pr eclinical data indicate  the 
efficacy of palbocic lib in ER+ breast cancer cell lines (Fry et al., 2004; Toogood et al., 2005; Dean et al., 
2010) . The phase 3  PALOMA -2 trial confirmed 10-month improved PFS in women  with ER+ MBC 
treated with first -line letrozole plus palbociclib versus letrozole alone (24.8 vs 14.5 months, HR, 0.58; 
P <.000001)  (Finn et al., 2016) , i.e., in  women who  had not received ET for m etastatic disease. The 
phase 3  PALOMA -3 trial demonstrated  5-month improved PFS in women with ER+ MBC who had 
progressed despi[INVESTIGATOR_391137], treated with palbociclib plus fulvestrant, versus 
fulvestrant alone (9.5 v s 4.6 months; HR, 0.46; P <.0001)  (Cristofanilli et al., 2016) . Thus palbociclib 
plus letrozole is the preferred first -line therapy in women with ER+ MBC, and pal bociclib plus 
fulvestrant i s effective therapy in patients with ER+ MBC not previously treated with palbociclib who 
have p rogressed on a nonsteroidal AI.  
The success of palbociclib spurred the development of other CDK4/6 inhibitors including ribociclib  
(Hortobagyi et al., 2016) , which is now FDA approved in combination with fulvestrant, and 
abemaciclib, which has been granted an FDA breakthrough therapy designation , while FDA approval 
will be requested for abemaciclib in combination with fulvestrant , based  on the MONARCH -2 study 
(Sledge et al., 2017) . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  mTOR I nhibition  
The PI3K -Akt-mTOR pathway is a key intracellular signaling pathway playing a significant role in cell 
growth and proliferation, and is implicated in resistance to ET , HER2 -directed therapy, and cytotoxic 
chemother apy. Furthermore, mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus synergized with letrozole in 
preclinical models (Mayer, 20 13) and mTOR was described as a mechanism facilitating escape of long -
term estrogen deprivation (deGraffenried et al., 2004b) . The addition of mTOR inhibitors to ET h as 
been investigated in phase 2 and 3  trials, including patients with ER+/HER2 -negative MBC.  
The phase 3  trial BOLERO -2 enrolled 724 patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer  with  recurrence 
during or within 12 months after adjuvant non -steroidal AI s or progression during or within 1 month 
after AI treatment (Baselga et al., 2012a) . Patie nts were randomized to receive everolimus combined 
with exemestane versus exemestane plus placebo. The pre-planned interim analysis  showed that  
median PFS was significantly better for everolimus plus exemestane compared to the control arm, for 
both investi gator analyses (6.9 months versus 2.8 months; HR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.35 -0.54, p  <0.001 ) and 
central analyses ( 10.6 versus 4.1 months, HR  = 0.36, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.47, p <0.001). A fter a median 18-
month follow -up, the addition of everolimus to exemestane was co nfirmed to significantly improve 
patient outcome over exemestane alone (median PFS 7.8 versus 3.2 months, HR  = 0.45, 95% CI 0.38

1.2 Development of MCLA -128 
1.2.1 Description of  MCLA -128  
MCLA -128 is a bispecific humanized full length IgG1 antibody with enhanced antibody -dependent cell -
mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) activity  targeting the receptor tyrosine kinases HER2 and HER3 . It is 
produced by [CONTACT_391166], CHO -DG44.   
Molecular formula : C6479H9997N1725O2024S45 
Molecular mass : 145.9 kDa  
Chemical name : [CONTACT_391232]:  Not yet issued  
MCLA -[ADDRESS_490900] been 
engineered in a complementary manner  using CH3 engineering, to ensure efficient 
heterodimerization and bispecific antibody  formation  and to enhance ADCC activity following a 
reduction of fucosylation . MCLA -128 has a 1331 amino acid sequence containing four disulfide bonds 
and a  molecular weight of 145.9 kDa.  
MCLA -128 acts via two independent mechanisms of action: 1) inhibition of HER3 pathway signaling by 
[CONTACT_391167]2:HER3 heterodimerization  and 2) elimination o f tumor cells via enhanced ADCC, 
and employs a ‘dock and block’ mechanism. Based on X -ray crystal struc ture, MCLA -128 docks to the 
HER2 domain I which orientates the HER3 binding arm to block the HER3 domain III (putative HRG 
domain), thus blocking oncogenic signaling via the HER2:HER3 heterodimer  (Maussang -Detaille et al.) . 
MCLA -128 does not compete with trastuzumab for binding to HER2 since it is binding to a different 
domain.  
MCLA -128 is formulated as a clear liquid solution for infusion at a target concentration of 20 mg/mL 
in 25 mM histidine, 220 mM trehalose and 0.16 mM polysorbate 20  at pH 6.0 in clear type I glass vials 
with an extractable volume of 5 mL  or 18.8 mL . 
1.2.2 Preclinical Studies   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacology  
In vitro  pharmacodynamic studies showed the mean K D values for MCLA -128 of 3.2 and 2.0 nM in BT -
474 and SK -BR-3 cells  (HER2 -amplified breast cancer cell lines also expressing HER3), respectively, and 
which  were in the same range as for trastuzumab (3.7 and 1.3 nM respectively). Although K D values of 
the individual HER2 and HER3 Fabs of MCLA -[ADDRESS_490901] to the HER2 Fab and correlates with the 
overexpression of HER2 in the cell lines . MCLA -128 potently inhibited  heregulin (H RG)-induced  
proliferation and morphologic changes of HER2 -overexpressing breast cancer cell lines SK -BR-[ADDRESS_490902] and gastric cell 
lines, at a notably lower half-maximal inhibitory concentration  (IC 50=35 pM) than combined

with a higher potency than the anti -HER2 pertuzumab plus trastuzumab antibody combination. HRG 
binds to HER3, resulting in its dimerization with HER2 and subsequent inducti on of intracellular 
signaling (Peess et al., 2015) . MCLA -128 selectively inhibits the formation of HRG -induced HER2:HER3 
dimers . 
In vivo , MCLA -[ADDRESS_490903] cancer cell line JIMT -1 
leading to tumor volume reduction after 29 days with 60% survival (with four weekly doses of 25 or 
2.5 mg/kg MCLA -128), while no animals treated with trastuzumab and pertuzumab experienced a 
decrease in tumor  volume  and none survived. Both HER2: HER3 heterodimerization and HER3:PI3K 
formation was significantly inhibited in MCLA -128-treated tumor tissue.  
Breast cancer brain metastases are known to use an HRG -dependent survival mechanism (Momeny 
et al., 2015) . In an orthotopic ST1360B murine brain metastatic breast cancer model, all mice treated 
with MCLA -128 (25 mg/kg twice weekly) survived for 21 days, co mpared to all vehicle animals which 
were  sacrificed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics  
The cynomolgus monkey was selected as the non -clinical toxicology species due to cross reactivity of 
the two Fab fragments in MCLA -128 towards both human and monkey HER2 and HER3, and la ck of 
cross -reactivity of the HER2 binding arm to rodent HER2.  
Following a single intravenous dose of MCLA -128 in cynomolgus monkeys, systemic exposure was 
dose proportional across the range 10 -100 mg/kg, with terminal elimination half -lives in the range 7 3-
210 hours. Half -life tended to increase with increasing dosage, suggesting a possible contribution from 
target -mediated clearance at lower dosages, with endogenous IgG clearance mechanisms being more 
predominant at higher dosages. The calculated volumes of distribution were in the range 68.3 -121 
mL/kg, slightly higher  than the plasma volume in monkeys, suggesting limited distribution outside the 
plasma compartment.  
Exposure following the first dose in the repeated dose toxicity study (five doses of MCLA -128, once  
weekly  for 5 weeks ) was dose -proportional and there was no sex difference in PK parameters. Most 
animals were continuously exposed to MCLA -128 during the treatment period, with a 3-fold 
accumulation (based on AUC) observed in females at 10 m g/kg/week, no accumulation at 30 
mg/kg/week, an d only slight accumulation (1.4 -1.7 fold) in low -dose males (10 mg/kg/week) and 
animals at 100 mg/kg/week . Few animals showed evidence of loss of exposure towards the end of the 
treatment period, which correla ted with the presence of ADA.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Toxicology  
MCLA -128 was well tolerated following single and repeated dose (up to five weekly doses) intravenous 
administration in cynomolgus monkeys, with no treatment -related clinical, laboratory or pathological 
findings up to the highest dose tested (100 mg/kg).  
There was no evidence of cardiotoxicity or effects on thyroid function. The 1 -month repeated dose 
toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, at IV dos es up to 100 mg/kg, showed that MCLA -[ADDRESS_490904] compromised the safety evaluation. There were no treatment -related changes to 
hematologic, chemistry or urinalysis paramet ers. Overall, all changes observed were procedural in 
origin, or related to an immune response to MCLA -128 in individual monkeys in the treatment groups. 
There was no evidence of target organ toxicity in the clinical pathology investigations or terminal 
pathology data.  
MCLA -128 formulations showed good local tolerability, with no evidence of local irritation at injection 
sites in the cynomolgus monkey toxicity studies, and no hemolytic potential or plasma incompatibility 
in an in vitro  hemocompatibility study conducted in human blood. A tissue cross -reactivity study 
conducted with human tissues showed no evidence of any non -specific or ‘off -target’ binding that was 
likely to be of clinical concern, most non -epi[INVESTIGATOR_391138], and thus 
unlikely to be relevant to the in vivo  administration.  
There was no evidence of cytokine release after infusion of MCLA -128 in cynomolgus monkeys at 
doses up to 100 mg/kg. Since monkeys are known to be poor predictors of cytokin e release in humans, 
in vitro  cytokine release studies were performed. In vitro  cytokine release studies conducted using 
whole human blood from healthy donors showed a very low potential for MCLA -128 to induce 
cytokine release, compared to reference antibo dies such as Campath ®. In this test system, both MCLA -
128 and trastuzumab showed little or no cytokine release  However, since trastuzumab is known to 
induce a certain incidence of infusion reactions in clinical use, and there are likely to be low levels of  
HER2/HER3 expression in healthy donor blood (as used in the in vitro  cytokine release assays), further 
cytokine release testing was performed as part of the ADCC effector function assays conducted with 
HER2 and HER3 expressing cell lines. In these studies , cytokines were determined in supernatants 
collected following co -incubation of human effector cells (PBMCs) with the HER2 and HER3 expressing 
SK-BR-3 cell line, with or without addition of MCLA -128 (and also trastuzumab as a comparator 
antibody). Based o n the EC 20 and EC 50 values for the four cytokines that were significantly released 
upon incubation with the therapeutic antibodies (i.e. IFNγ, IL -6, IL -8 and TNFα), it can be concluded 
that MCLA -[ADDRESS_490905]-in-human  phase

The Data Review Committee selected  750 mg q3w as the RP2D  as a 120 -minute IV infusion  based on 
the cumulative safety profile, available P K data and a PK simulation study.   
At the initiation of the current MCLA -128-CL02 study, safety, tolerability and efficacy were under 
evaluation at the RP2D in the phase  2 part in selected solid tumor expansion cohorts with advanced 
or metastatic relapsed or refractory epi[INVESTIGATOR_391140]2 -expre ssing tumors ; to date, cohorts have been 
opened for  metastatic  breast, gastric/gastroesophageal, ovarian, colorectal  (cohort closed  
prematurely ), non-small cell lung cancer  and endometrial cancer s. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient s and Treatment  
As of 15 February 2017, a total of 47 patients were enrolled in the study, 28 in the phase  1 part and 
19 in the phase  2 part.  
In the phase  1 part, median age was 60 years (range 25 -83), 61% of patients were male, and ECOG PS 
was 0/1 in 43%/57% of patients. The main tumor types were colorectal  (8 patients), 
gastric/gastroesophageal (6 patients), and breast (3 patients). Patients had a median of 2 metastatic 
sites (0 -14) and had received a median of 3 lines of prior metastatic therapy (range 1 -7). 
Among  the 19 patients enrolled in the phase  2 part  (3 not yet treated at the data cut -off), ten had 
breast cancer, 6 gastric/gastroesophageal, 2 ovarian, and 1 colorectal cancer. M edian age was 54 years 
(range 33 -74), 32% of patients were male, and ECOG PS was 0/1 in 17%/83% of patients. Patie nts had 
a median of 2.5  metastatic  sites (range 1 -4) and had received a median of 5.5 prior lines of metastatic 
therapy (2 -18). All [ADDRESS_490907] cancer patients had received 3 -4 prior lines of anti -HER2 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
A median of 2 cycles (range 1 -28) we re administered to the phase  1 patients and as of 15 Feb 2017, 
of the 19 enrolled phase  2 patients, 16 had been treated, receiving a median of 3 cycles (range 1 -12), 
while the 9 treated MBC patients receiving a median of 5 cycles (range 2 -12). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety   
In the phase  [ADDRESS_490908] frequent related  adverse events  (AEs) were infusion -related reactions 
(IRRs ; 10 patients, 36%), and gastrointestinal toxicity, notably nausea (8 patients, 29%), vomiting (7 
patients, 25%), diarrhea (5 patients, 18%), and stomatitis (4 patients, 14%). Asthenia/fatigue were 
reported in 4/2 patients (14%/7%) and skin disorders (rash/dermatitis/fissures/nail disorder) in 6 
patients (21%).  All related AEs were grade 1 -2 other than one grade 3 event (suspected related IRR).  
In the phase  [ADDRESS_490909] frequent AE s were IRRs (4 patients, 25%), diarrhea (3 patients, 19%), and 
fatigue (2 patients, 13%). All but one were grade 1 -2, with 1 patient experiencing  a grade 4 suspected 
related hypersensitivity reaction (allergy)  which had  a fatal outcome . This 71-year -old gastric 
carcinoma patient experienced a grade 4 hypersensitivity reaction (life -threatening). At baseline she 
had 56% LVEF and severe aortic valve and mitral valve stenosis with no clinical manifestations. On the 
first da y of treatment she was premedicated with dexamethasone (5 mg), polaramine (5 mg) and 
paracetamol (1 g). After administration of 60 mL of MCLA -128 (out of 250 mL total) she presented 
with a grade [ADDRESS_490910],  and died 9 hours after 
treatment initiation. The investigator reported that the allergic reaction was definitely related to the 
study drug. The patient had no history of hypersensitivity, allergic or anaphylactic reactions. As per

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 127 the investigator, the al lergic reaction was the driver of the causality of the death however the patient’s 
comorbidities, notably severe aortic stenosis likely played a major contributing role.  
Key aspects of the MCLA -128 safety profile are : 
• IRRs, which w ere analyzed according t o all preferred terms considered  by [CONTACT_391169] 24 hours of the MCLA -128 infusion (including notably  IRR, 
hypersensitivity, nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, etc .) were reported in  14 phase  1 patients (50 %) and 
5 phase  2 patients (31%) . All but 2 IRRs were grade 1 -2 and resolved complete ly with symptomatic 
treatment.  
• No suspected cardiac clinical AEs or clinically significant LVEF declines occurred; overall 5/27 
(19%) evaluable patients had grade 2 LVEF decreases, none symptomatic or clinically significant 
(defined as LVEF decline >  10% from baseline and to a value of <  50%).  
• No severe (grade 3 -4) diarrhea or diarrhea requiring treatment discontinuation was observed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetic s, Cytokines and Immunogenicity  
In the 28 phase  1 patients C max and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) increased 
with increasing dose. Terminal half -life (t ½) increased with increasing dose up to 360 mg, as is typi[INVESTIGATOR_391141] -mediated clearance, after which it did not increase 
significantly , giving  an approximately dose -proportional increase of MCLA -128 exposure from 480 mg. 
Among the 16 patients treated at the RP2D of 750 mg q3w (6 phase  1, 10 phase  2), mean C max was 194 
µg/mL, and AUC 0-∞ was [ZIP_CODE] µg·h/mL, V ss was 4.5 L  (indicating that distribution is confined to the 
blood and interstitial fluids, typi[INVESTIGATOR_391142]) , CL was 37 mL/h, and t ½ was 101 h. After 21 days, 
median trough levels were 2.6 µg/mL, well a bove the MCLA -128 concentration that results in 50% 
receptor occupancy in vitro (K D) (Alsina et al., 2017) . 
An interim population PK analysis on PK samples of [ADDRESS_490911] described by a two -compartment model with parallel linear and 
concentration -dependent (nonlinear) clearance from the central compartment. The nonlinear 
clearance reflects elimination processes of MCLA -128 afte r its saturating binding to the targets. The 
linear clearance represents the elimination of unbound MCLA -128. Estimated parameters were in 
accordance with parameters calculated by [CONTACT_11339] -compartmental analysis and with PK 
characteristics of therapeutic an tibodies in general. The K m value that determines the serum 
concentration at which a half maximal elimination rate is achieved was estimated at 0.290 µg/mL 
which is in the same range as the KD obtained for MCLA -128 on HER2 -amplified BC cell lines . 
Only 1 p atient (160 mg MCLA -128) of 34 evaluable  (from both phase  1 and 2 patients) had a positive 
anti-drug -antibody (ADA) titer at Day 36, with no apparent effect on PK. All other patients were ADA -
negative throughout treatment.  
At the RP2D, modest and transient  cytokine elevations from baseline were observed 2 hours after the 
end of the infusion, mainly in IFNγ (0.4 -3.4 fold), IL -8 (0.7 -8.4 fold) and TNFα (0.8 -11.6 fold)  (Alsina et 
al., 2017) . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Activity  Including MBC  Patients  
Among the 28 evaluable  phase  1 patients, 1 non-small cell lung cancer patient had a confirmed PR 
(360 mg, 18.0 months) an d 3 patients had SD >3 months (breast, 3.6 months; colorectal, 7.3 months;

Sixteen phase  2 patients were evaluable , 9 MBC and 7 with other tumors. Antitumor activity was seen 
in 6 MBC patients (1 PR and 5 SD), and 2 other tumor types (2 SD including a gastric patient with 7+ 
cycles).  
Evaluation of efficacy in the  overall MBC cohort  at potentially active MCLA -128 doses  (9 phase  2 
treated at 750 mg, 2 phase  2 treated at 480 mg  [1 phase  1 patient treated at 40 mg was not included 
for efficacy evaluat ion]), 1 patient had PR and 7 had SD (4 lasting ≥ 5 months) , giving a clinical benefit 
rate (CBR) in MBC patients of 64% (7/11 patients) . All these pa tients were heavily pretreated, all with

cancer treatments to overcome resistance for different patient populations.  
1.3.1 Preclinical Studies  for MCLA -128 + Trastuzumab in HER2 -Positive MBC  
There is a strong rational e to combine trastuzumab with MCLA -128 for the treatment of MBC. 
Trastuzumab is effective in blocking constitutive ligand -independent signaling through the HER2:HER3 
heterodimer in the context of HER2 overexpression. However, it has very poor growth inhibi tion 
activity in tumors and cell lines where HER2:HER3 signaling is driven by [CONTACT_94970]3 ligand dependency 
(Wehrman et al., 2006; Junttila et al., 2009) . Preclinical and clinical evidence points to increased HER3 
expression and/or HER3 ligand upregulation as the main drivers leading to trastuzumab resistance 
(Sergi na et al., 2007; Ocana et al., 2013) . The bispecific antibody MCLA -128 docks HER2 present on the 
cancer cells to subsequently lock HER3 in an inactive confirmation. This results in potent inhibition of 
the HRG ligand -induced HER2:HER3 dimer formation an d may overcome the resistance mechanism 
observed with trastuzumab.  
Preclinical studies showed that the combination of MCLA -[ADDRESS_490913] that administra tion of MCLA -128 and trastuzumab in HER2 -positive patients has the potential 
for additive or synergistic activity in this setting.  
1.3.2 Preclinical Studies  for MCLA -128 + Endocrine Therapy in Hormone Receptor -
Positive/HER2 -Negative MBC  
Bidirectional crosstalk between ER and HER2/3 has been hypothesized to underlie ET resistance via 
their activation (Houston et al.,  1999; Thrane et al., 2013) . The HER2:HER3 heterodimer activates 
PI3K/AKT and MAPK downstream signaling cascades but can also induce ER phosphorylation 
independent of estrogen (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_94900]., 1995; Curley et al., 2015)  which may reduce the effec tiveness 
of endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Arpi[INVESTIGATOR_105406]., 2008) . On the other hand, HER2 may be preferentially 
upregulated by [CONTACT_191064], while tamoxif en induces expression of EGFR and HER2 (García -
Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, 11 April 2022  
 
 
 
PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 127 Becerra et al., 2012) . The nature of  the HER2/ERα cross -talk seems to be conditioned by [CONTACT_391170]; in a series of paired biopsies from patients relapsing on tamoxifen evaluated 
in an in vivo  model, conversion from HER2 -negative to HER2 -positive was rare, however  <20% of 
tamoxifen -resistant patients relapsed with adaptive upregulation in HER2 and either suppressed or 
enhanced ERα expression and signaling (Gutierrez et al., 2005) .  
Taken together, these data support a combined ER/HER2 -targeted approach in patients with acquired 
ET resistance in ERα -positive/HER2 -negative breast cancer. The EGF30008 trial comparing letrozole 
alone v ersus in combination with lapatinib in hormone receptor -positive MBC suggests this may be 
translated into the clinic, as although the addition of lapatinib did not confer benefit in the overall 
hormone receptor -positive/HER2 -negative group, there was a tre nd toward a benefit in the 
endocrine -resistant hormone receptor -positive/HER2 -negative subset (Johnston et al., 2009) . 
A recent precli nical study took this concept a step further, demonstrating direct cross -talk between 
HER2/HER3 and ER with phosphorylation of ER only observed in cells expressing both HER2 and ER  
or HER3 and ER  (Collins et al., 2017) . The authors use d an in vivo  mouse model of ER+/HER2 -low 
(HER2 IHC 1+ or 2+ without gene amplification) human breast cancer to evaluate a triple therapy 
targeting HER2 (pertuzumab), HER3 (lumretuzumab) and the ER (fulvestrant), resulting in long -lasting 
tumor regression.  
Preclinical studies support  that adding MCLA -128 to hormonal treatment could delay or reverse 
resistance to therapy in ER+ HER2 - (HER2  IHC 1+ or 2+ by [CONTACT_152051]™) breast cancer. MCLA -128 with 
anti-ER drugs (tamoxifen and fulvestrant) combined with the AI letrozole was evaluated in tw o in vivo  
xenograft models of ER+ HER2 -low breast cancer. All hormon e therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76311], while 
MCLA -128 single agent had no efficacy. However, when MCLA -128 was added to the hormon e therapy 
regimen, it led to a further decrease d in  tumor growth. Mechanistically, HER2 expression was 
increased with fulvestrant and tamoxifen, which is supported by [CONTACT_391171] (Osipo et al., 2007; 
García -Becerra et al., 2012) . When MCLA -[ADDRESS_490914] importantly, a proximity ligation assay showed that fulvestrant treatment 
upregulated the formation of HER2:HER3 d imers and enhanced activati on of the Akt signaling 
pathway, which could be inhibited by [CONTACT_391172] -128. Together, these data show that the efficacy 
of hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_391143]2/HER3 signaling axis, which could 
be reve rsed by [CONTACT_391173] -128.  
While the in vivo  tumor models tested responded to hormonal therapy, there is also evidence that in 
the context of ET -resistant tumors , the inhibition of HER3 by [CONTACT_391173] -128 could be therapeutically 
beneficial , as suggested by [CONTACT_391174].  (2017) . The MCF -7 cell line  engineered to respond to AIs w as 
initially sensitive to letrozole, but tumors subsequently became resistant (Curley et al., 2015) . The 
addition of an anti -HER3 antibody at the start of treatment was more effective than hormone therapy  
alone, as observed for MCLA -128. Importantly, the combination of the anti -HER3 with hormone 
therapy  after resistance restore d antitumor activity. This was not the case when the anti -HER3 was 
given as single agent, demonstrating that hormone receptor and HER3 inhibition  work in synergy 
before and after the occurrence of HT resistance.  
In patients with ER -positive/low HER2 expression MBC, based on this strong preclinical evidence, a 
rescue approach will be used to evaluate the effect of the addition of MCLA -[ADDRESS_490915] patient populations, HER2 -positive/ amplified MBC who 
will be treated with MCLA -128 and trastuzumab ± chemotherapy (Cohort 1), evaluated as doublet and 
triplet combinations, and ER -positive/low HER2 expression MBC patients who will be treat ed with 
MCLA -128 combined with the same ET that each patient progressed on immediately prior to study 
entry (Cohort 2).  
The RP2D of 750 mg MCLA -128 IV, over 2 hours, q3w , was established in the phase  1/2 dose escalation 
study, a dose  shown to be well toler ated.  Mandatory p remedication with all MCLA -128 infusions has 
been implemented to mitigate IRRs , and  the infusion duration can be extended from 2 to 4 hours to  
further  improve infusion tolerance. MCLA -128 is very well tolerated with few and mainly mild to 
moderate tox icities and p otential toxicity associated with  the proposed combination agents is 
expected to be manageable ; the IRRs reported with MCLA -[ADDRESS_490916] all grade 1 or 
2 and were managed with medication, while the introduction of mandatory premedication improved 
management of this toxicity . Clinical cardiac toxicity has not been reported, and gastroi ntestinal 
toxicity is grade 1 or 2.  
The study design allows for cautious verification of the safety of combin ing two anti -HER2 monoclonal 
antibodies  in Cohort 1, at multiple levels. The  initial administration of the doublet agents, MCLA -128 
and trastuzumab  will be on  consecutive days. Consecutive administration but on the same day is 
anticipated for subsequent cycles if the combination is considered well tolerated . Su bsequent 
evaluation of administration of the two antibodies from treatment initiation will be investigated in 
patients enrolled later,  to support a practical administration regimen in the long -term . The same 
principle will be  applied for assessment of the triplet combination , with the antibody doublet 
administration initially, followed by [CONTACT_391175] . In addition , the doublet and triplet 
combinations themselves will be evaluated sequentially to ensure safety. The implementation of a 
safety run -in evaluation in a small group of patients  for each combination will provide safety data 
before committing to continuing full recruitment.

evaluated initially, followed  by [CONTACT_391182] -128 + trastuzumab + vinorelbine (triplet combination) 
after safety of the doublet has been established  and which will be evaluated in parallel with the 
doublet . 
• Cohort 2 hormone receptor -positive /low HER2 expression : MCLA -128 + endocrine therap y 
combination . 
For all combinations, a  treat ment cycle is 21 days (3 weeks) , including Cohort 2 which may include 
q4w fulvestrant dosing. Day 1 of t he subsequent cycle will be on D ay 22 or after recovery from any 
AEs asso ciated with the previous cycle.  
A 6-hour observation period  will be implemented following infusion start for the initial  MCLA -128 
and/or trastuzumab  administration , and 2  hours for all subsequent administrations  (i.e. when a single 
antibody  - MCLA -128 or trastuzumab  - is administered on a  given day, or after trastuzumab when they 
are administered on the same day ).

5.3.3 Dose Adaptation  
[IP_ADDRESS]  MCLA -128 and Trastuzumab  
Action s to take in the event of toxicity related to MCLA -128 and/or trastuzumab are summarized 
below. See Section 8.[ADDRESS_490953] (IRRs, cardiotoxicity and 
diarrhea).  
Interruptions:  MCLA -[ADDRESS_490954]  be interrupted  in the event of an IRR. IRRs 
inclu de the preferred term (PT) “IRR” and any other PTs occur ring within 24 hours of the MCLA -128 
or trastuzumab infusion that the investigator judges as a sign or symptom of an IRR (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, hypotension, pyrexia, tremor , and hypersensitivity).  
The infusion should be stopped immediately, and the patient should receive symptomatic treatment 
according to  the investigator’s or treating physician’s judgment .  
For non -severe IRRs, the  MCLA -128 or trastuzumab  infusion can be  re-started upon clinical 
improvement  of symptoms , at 50% of the infusion rate prior to the reaction  and the infusion duration 
can be increased to 4 hours , to adm inister the totality of the dose .  
For severe IRRs (CTCAE grade 4, life -threatening), MCLA -128 or trastuzumab  infusion  should be 
stopped immediately and all study treatment discontinued definitively .  
For IRRs considered to be due to an IgE -mediated anaphylactic reaction, the MCLA -128 or trastuzumab 
infusion should be interrupted and not resumed, i rrespective of the severity of the reaction, and is 
contraindicated for subsequent cycles.  
Delays:  Planned MCLA -128 and trastuzumab administration can be delayed for up to 1 cycle (i.e., a 
maximum 6 -week interval between infusions), in the event of the following : 
• Cardiotoxicity : In the event of LVEF <  50% with a decline of ≥ 10 ejection fraction points or LVEF 
≤ 44%, antibody administration will be delayed for 3 weeks and another LVEF evaluation 
performed. In the absence of improvement or if the patient has a confirmed documented LVEF 

Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, 11 April 2022  
 
 
 
PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 of 127 decrease to a value ≤ 44% or clinical signs and symptoms suggesting congestive heart failure, both 
antibodies will be withdrawn . See Appendix 19.3  for the algorithm for treatment management in 
the event of cardi otoxicity . 
• Diarrhea : In the event of persistent grade 2 (>  48 hours) or grade 3 -4 diarrhea, administration of 
MCLA -128 and trastuzumab  should be delayed  (for a maximum of 6 weeks between i nfusions) .  
Reductions:  Dose reductions are not permitted  for MCLA -128 or trastuzumab . 
Incomplete trastuzumab loading dose:  
• If the patient receives < 50% of the Cycle [ADDRESS_490955] interrupted dose, as scheduled ; e.g., if a patient received 
up to 50% of the scheduled  loading dose, the remaining dose  should b e administered , preferably 
in the first week, then  regular maintenanc e doses (6 mg/kg of trastuzumab ) from  Day 22, as 
scheduled.  
• If the patient receives between 50 -75% of the Cycle [ADDRESS_490956] 2 weeks of Cycle 1; e.g. , if ~60% of the 
scheduled loading dose  is administered , the remaining 40% should be administered preferably 
within 2 weeks , then regular maintenance doses (6 mg/kg of trastuzumab) from Day 22, as 
scheduled . 
• If the patient receives ≥  75% of the Cycle 1 loading dose, additional loading is probably not  
necessary , however, the remainder of the loading dose may be given at the investigator's  
discretion. In this case, the remainder may be given at any time before the next  scheduled dose 
or the patient may be given an additional loading dose on Day 22.  
If, after receiving an incomplete loading dose on Day 1, the patient cannot attend the site  until Day 
22, a seco nd loading dose  should be given on Day 22. However,  every effort should be made to give 
the remainder of the dose prior to Day 22 . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vinorelbine  
Dose reductions and delays are required in the event of toxicity as  follows:  
Hematologic Toxicity:   
Hold or decrease the vinorelbine dose in patients with decreased neutrophil counts using the following 
schema.  
Neutrophils on Day of Treatment (cells/mm3)  Percentage of Starting Dose  
≥ 1,500 (≥ grade 1)  100%  
< 1,500 (grade 2) Do not administer. Repeat neutrophil count in 1 week. If  
treatment is delayed due to  neutrophil count < 1, 500 
cells/mm3 for ≥3 consecutive weeks , discontinue 
vinorelbine  
Note : For patients who experience fever and/or sepsis while neutrophil count is < 1,500 or had 2 
consecutive weekly doses held due to neutropenia, subsequent doses should be:  
> 1,500 (≥ grade 1)  75%  
< 1,500 (grade 2) Do not administer.  
Repeat neutrophil count in 1 week.

Delays:  In cases of fulvestrant -related toxicity  as per investigator’s judgement , the injection can be 
delayed for up to 7 days, after which the planned monthly injection should be skipped.  Fulvestrant 
should not be administered if the platele t count is <  50,000/mm3. 
Reductions:  Dose reductions are not permitted.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Supportive Care Guidelines for Study Treatment Toxicity  
Toxicity will be managed by [CONTACT_391183]. Supportive 
treatment must be reported in the concomitant medication section of the eCRF.  
5.4 Treatment Withdrawal  
Study treatment  will be administered until any of the following occurs, at which point it will be 
definitively discontinued, except in cases of perceived benefit and in agreement with the  Sponsor:  
• Confirmed progressive disease (as per RECIST)  
• Unacceptable toxicity (including a confirmed documented LVEF decrease to a value <40% or 
clinical signs and symptoms suggesting congestive heart failure)  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Patient non -compliance  
• Investigator decision (e.g. clinical deterioration ; in the rare event that  a patient discontinues due 
to global deterioration of health status considered related to the underlying disease but without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time, it should be reported as “symptomatic 
deterioration” – all efforts should be made to document objective progression ) 
• Treatment interruption > 6 consecutive weeks  
• Withdrawal of any of the study drugs  (MCLA -128, trastuzumab, vinorelbine or endocrine

In all cases, the reason for and date of study treatment discontinuation must be recorded in the eCRF 
and documented in the patient's medical records. As far as possible, there should be only one reason 
for treatment discontinuation. If several reasons  apply (e.g. concomitant progressive disease and 
toxicity) the primary reason must be reported.  
As far as possible, all examinations scheduled for the final study day must be performed for all patients 
who receive any study medication  but who do not compl ete the study according to protocol.  
The investigator must make every effort to contact [CONTACT_391184] -up, especially when a 
patient is treated in another non -study center.

Each candidate patient will be examined before starting the study to determine eligibility for 
participation  (as per Table 7-1, Table 7-2 and Error! Reference source not found. ). This must be done 
within [ADDRESS_490985] provide written informed consent prior to any specific study procedure s being 
performe d. 
A centralized patient enrolment  process will be used to track patient screening and planned timing of 
Cycle 1, Day 1. The investigator (or designee) must verify that the patient meets eligibility criteria and 
has signed the Informed Consent Form, then request patient inclusion by [CONTACT_29658]/e -mailing the Patient 
Enrolment Request Form  (provided separately)  to the Sponsor ’s Medical expert  (or designee)  as 
specified on the form.   
Patient s must be approved for enrolment by [CONTACT_391193] . For Cohort 1, e ligible 
patients will be allocated centrally by [CONTACT_391194]  (when both 
expansion phases are running in parallel)  as follows. After completion of the evaluation of the doublet 
safety run -in patients, if the doublet combination is considered toxic, all inclusions in Cohort 1 will be 
stopped . If the doublet is considered safe, the next 4 to 6 eligible successive patients will be treated 
with  the triplet combination. If the triplet combination is considered toxic  in these patients, further 
exploration of the triplet combination will be stopped, and only the doublet combination will be 
evaluated  for efficacy . If both the doublet and triplet combinations are considered safe, they will be 
expanded for efficacy evalua tion in parallel. E ligible patients will  be allocated centrally by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor 
to one of the two cohorts using a 3:1 ratio for the  triplet or doublet respectively and taking into 
account previous exposur e to vinorelbine . For Cohort 2, no treatment assignme nt is required.  
After validation of eligibility (as per Request Form , the enrolment form signed by [CONTACT_1034]’s 
Medical Monitor or designee will be returned to the investigator  within 24 hours (on working days) , 
with or without inclusion agreement. For pa tients not included, the reason for inclusion refusal will be 
specified.  
Patients who signed an Informed Consent Form but who failed to start treatment will be considered 
a screen failure and  reported on the screening log in the Investigator Site File.  Screen failures will not 
be reported in the eCRF.  If the patient is screened and not enrolled, only SAEs suspected to be caused 
by [CONTACT_391195].    
Patients who are enrolled but are not treated will be reported in the eCRF. eCRF page s for 
demographic information, informed consent, inclusion/exclusion and the “leading question” on the 
AE (to confirm if any AEs occurred during screening) must also be completed for screen failure 
patients. No other data will be entered into the clinical database for these patients unless they 
experience d an SAE during the screening phase.  
For included patients, the patient cohort and combination therapy arm allocated will be specified on 
the form, along with a unique patient number. Included patients will  only receive a unique patient

8.3 Definitions (21 CFR§312.32)  
• Adverse event (AE)  means any untoward medical occurrence associated with use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. The term treatment emergent  adverse event  
[TEAE] covers any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness that develops  
or worsens during the period of observation  after the first treatment administration  in the clinical 
study. Surgical or other procedures themselves are not TEAEs. The condition for which the 
surgery/other procedure is required, is a TEAE, if it occurs or is detected during the study period. 
Planned surgical or other procedures planned/permitted by [CONTACT_391201](s) leading to these measures are not TEAEs, if the condition(s) was (were) known before 
the start of study treatment. In the  latter case the condition should be reported as medical history . 
• Adverse drug reaction (ADR)  is an AE caused by [CONTACT_33641].  
Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, 11 April 2022  
 
 
 
PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72 of 127 • Suspected adverse reaction (SAR)  is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. A “reasonable pos sibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the AE. SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than an ADR, and include:  
-  A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with 
drug exposure;  
- One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, 
but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture);  
- An aggregate analysis of specific events obse rved in a clinical trial (such as known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that 
commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those 
events occur more frequently in th e drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical 
control group.   
• Serious adverse event (SAE)  or serious suspected adverse reaction (SSAR) is an event that, in the 
view of either the investigator or Sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes : 
- Death occurring on study or within [ADDRESS_490995] administration of study drug 
(regardless of relationship to study treatment) or within any interval if related to the study 
drug. Although death may occur as a result of the disease, all deaths oc curring within [ADDRESS_490996] be managed as SAEs and reported as such;  
- A life -threatening AE;  
- Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
- A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions;  
- A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
In addition, medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting i s appropriate in situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred. Important 
medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_391147]’s safety or may require intervention to  prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in the definition above should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include:  
- Overd ose, even without complications  (see Section  8.11 ) 
- An AE requiring intensive treatment  without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
- A diagnosis of a new cancer type during the course of a treatment  
- A pregnancy diagnosed in a female patient treat ed with the stud y medication  must be 
reported to the Sponsor immediately.  
See Section 8.10  for SAE reporting for pregnancies. Only  pregnancies with an outcome meeting any of 
the serious criteria defined above  (i.e., congenital anomaly, stillbirth, neonatal death)  should be 
reported as an SAE . For any pregnancy without an adverse outcome, the Investigator should complete 
the appropriate section of the SAE report form and state clearly that no AE was observed . 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_286742]:  
- Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition  
- Elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent

condition  
- Treatment on an emergenc y outpatient basis that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_391148] a n SAE given above.   
Reporting disease progression as an SAE:  Progression of the underlying malignancy is not reported as 
an AE if it is clearly consistent with suspected progression of the underlying cancer as defined by 
[CONTACT_393], or other criteria as determined by [CONTACT_760]. Clinical symptoms of progression should be 
reported as AEs/SAEs if there is any uncertainty that they are du e only to the progression of the 
underlying malignancy or they do not fit the expected pattern of progression for the disease under 
study . The PT “disease progression” should not be used.  
In rare cases, progression may be evident in the patient’s clinical  symptoms but is not supported by 
[CONTACT_217976], or disease progression is so evident that the investigator elects not to 
perform further disease assessments. Every effort should be made to document the radiologic 
objective progression of the unde rlying malignancy.  
• Life-threatening AE or life -threatening SAR is an AE that, in the view of either the investigator or 
Sponsor, places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had 
it occurred in a more severe form, m ight have caused death.  
• Unexpected AE or unexpected SAR is an AE or SAR that is not listed in the investigator brochure 
or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. For example, under this 
definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the investigator 
brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral 
thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if 
the invest igator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected”, as used in this 
definition, also refers to AEs or SARs that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring 
with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacologic proper ties of the drug, but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
8.[ADDRESS_490997] be individually recorded in the eCRF, including the nature of the 
event, date and time of onset (where appropriate), duration of effect, action taken, seriousness, 
severity, and relationship to study medication. Any consequent change to the dosage sc hedule or 
corrective therapy should be recorded.  
Every attempt should be made to describe the TEAE in terms of a diagnosis. If a clear diagnosis has 
been made, individual signs and symptoms will not be recorded. If a clear diagnosis cannot be 
established,  each sign and symptom must be recorded individually.  
All patients who experience a TEAE, regardless of the relationship to study treatment, must be 
monitored to determine the outcome. The clinical course of the AE will be followed up even after the 
end of  the period of observation for related TEAEs, until a satisfactory explanation is found or the 
investigator considers it medically justifiable to terminate follow -up. Should the AE result in death, a 
post -mortem examination should be considered as far as p ossible.  
Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, [ADDRESS_490998] 30 days  to document 
any late side effects and until resolution in cases of TEAEs for which a relationship to the study drugs  
cannot definitely be excluded.  Patients will be followed up until resolution or attribution of sequelae 
for any treatment -related AEs.  
AEs already recorded and designated as “continuing” should be reviewed at each subsequent 
assessment. If resolved, details are to be recorded in the eCRF. If an AE worsens in frequency of 
attacks/symptoms or in severity, a new record of the event must be started (i.e., distinct AE reports 
are required for differing frequencies and/or severity of the same event to enable comprehensive 
safety reports and later analy sis).  
Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, must be reported 
under “concomitant procedures” in the eCRF and not as an AE. The medical condition for which the 
procedure was performed must be reported.  
8.[ADDRESS_490999] be graded using the NCI 
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03, which can be found at: 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010 -06-14_Qui ckReference_8.5x11.pdf. The worst 
grade is to be documented.  
AE grades usually reflect their severity, with grade 1 meaning “mild”, grade 2 meaning “moderate”, 
grade 3 meaning “severe”, grade 4 meaning “life -threatening” and grade 5 meaning “fatal”.  
The te rm “severity” is used to describe the intensity of an AE; the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor clinical significance (e.g., ‘severe’ headache). This is not the same as “serious”. 
Seriousness of AEs is based on the outcome/action of an AE a nd associated with events that pose a 
threat to a patient’s life or functioning  (see definition in Section 8.3 above) . 
Intensity of the AE will be evaluated using t he following criteria:  
● Mild:  The patient is aware of the sign or symptom, but finds it easily tolerated. The event is of 
little concern to the patient and of little clinical significance. The event is not expected to have any 
effects on the patient’s ove rall health or wellbeing.  
● Moderate:  The patient has discomfort enough to cause interference with or change in usual 
activities. The event is of some concern to the patient’s health or wellbeing and may require 
medical intervention and/or close follow -up. 
● Severe:  The AE interferes considerably with the patient’s usual activities. The event is of definite 
concern to the patient and/or poses substantial risk to the patient’s health or wellbeing. The event 
is likely to require medical intervention and/or cl ose follow -up and may be incapacitating or life -
threatening. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_391149].

therefore be collected. However, the investigator often has arguments to think that a TEAE is or is not 
related to the study treatment. Albeit subjective, and susceptible to be challen ged, the assessment of 
relationship to study treatment is an important role of the investigator. Thus, the investigators should

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 75 of 127 decide, based on their knowledge and medical expert[INVESTIGATOR_18700], whether, in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], an AE is 
“reasonably related” or “unlikely re lated” to the study treatment (or to study specific procedures).  
8.7 SAE Reporting Requirements  
SAEs and other AEs that fulfill a reason for expedited reporting to Pharmacovigilance (overdose and 
pregnancy) must be documented on the SAE Report Form at the time the SAE is detected. This form 
must be completed by [CONTACT_43087] 24  hours to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
representative as per the contact [CONTACT_391202].  
The SAE report form and guidelines for completing it are provided in the Investigator Study File. The 
Sponsor is responsible for ensuring that all legal reporting requirements are met.  
The initial report must be as complete as possible, including details of the current illness and AE(s), 
and an assessment of the causal relationship between the event(s) and the study medication . 
Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an AE end date or laboratory values 
received after the report) must be documented on a follow -up SA E report form.  
The IDMC will be provided with monthly listings of suspected SAEs. Investigators will be informed of 
serious unexpected suspected AEs as per the standard reporting requirements .  
The Sponsor must immediate ly declar e all S[LOCATION_003]Rs result ing in death or endanger ing the life of a 
patient, and a follow -up report  must be provided  within the following [ADDRESS_491001]  
8.8.1 Infusion-related reactions  
Patients will be monitored closely during the MCLA -128 infusion period  for signs of IRRs. IRRs include 
the preferred term (PT) “IRR” and any other PTs occu rring within 24 hours of the MCLA -128 or 
trastuzumab infusion that the investigator judges as a sign or symptom of an IRR (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, hypotension, pyrexia, tremor, and hypersensitivity).  
All p atients must be pre -medicated with antihistamines, paracetamol /acetaminophen  and 
cortico steroids before each MCLA -128 infusion. If an IRR develops during administration of MCLA -128, 
the infusion should be stopped immediately , receive symptomatic treatment according to  the 
investigator’ s or treating physician’s judgment (e.g. antipyretics, bronchodilators, oxygen, 
corticosteroids, and vasopressors, anti -IL-6 compounds), and the patient should be monitored until 
resolution of the symptoms and signs.   
Upon complete resolution of non -severe  IRRs, the infusion may be resumed at 50% of the infusion 
rate prior to the reaction  and the infusion duration can be increased to 4 hours, to admi nister the 
totality of the dose . For severe IRRs (CTCAE grade 4, life -threatening), study treatment  should be  
discontinued definitively . 
For IRRs considered to be due to an IgE -mediated anaphylactic reaction, the MCLA -128 infusion should 
not be resumed, irrespective of the severity of the reaction , and is contraindicated for subsequent 
cycles.  
Local irritation a t the injection site should  be treated according to routine  treatment guidelines.

made preferably by [CONTACT_6751] (ECHO), although a multi ple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan may 
be used if this method is standard practice at the investigational site. One method of evaluation is 
adequate and the same method should be used for each assessment for an individual patient.

follow -up until resolution , stability (i .e. sequelae),  change of causality from related to non -related , or 
initiation of further antitumor therapy.  
If the investigator detects an SAE after  the end of the period of observation, and considers the event 
possibly related to prior study treatment, he/she should contact [CONTACT_391204].  
All new related cardiac events  and new suspected related SAEs  will be followed up until resolution or 
stability or for 35 ± [ADDRESS_491006] . 
In addition, all patients will be followed up for up to 35 ± [ADDRESS_491007],  for disease status (patients 
who have not progressed at end of treatment) and survival status .

Female patients must not become pre gnant or start breast -feeding during the study, and women of 
childbearing potential  (i.e. without proven menopause ) must use medically effective contraception 
during the study and for [ADDRESS_491009] MCLA -128/trastuzumab intake . 
In the event of a pregnancy during the course of this study, the Sponsor must be notified immediately 
and the patient should be immediately withdrawn from study. The investigator should counsel the 
patient, and discuss the risks of continuing with the preg nancy and the possible effects on the fetus. 
The pregnant patient should be followed during the entire course of the pregnancy and postpartum 
period.  
Parental and neonatal outcomes must be recorded even if they are completely normal and without 
AEs. Offspr ing should be followed up for at least 8 weeks after delivery. Longer observation periods 
may be determined by [CONTACT_391206].  
Pregnancies occurring during the study up to 7 months after  the final dose of MCLA-128/trastuzumab 
must also be reported to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance representative  on the appropriate section 
of the SAE report form, according to SAE reporting requirements (see Section 8.7). Note that a  
pregnancy is only considered an SAE if the outcome meets any of the serious criteria defined in Section 
8.3 (i.e., congenital anomaly, stillbirth, neonatal death). For any pregnancy without an adverse 
outcome, the Investigator should complete the appropriate section of the SAE report form and state 
clearly that no AE was observed.  
The following non -hormonal methods of contraception are  acceptable:  
• True abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of  the patient. [Periodic 
abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal  post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are 
not acceptable methods of  contraception].  
• Patients with a sole partner  who is vasectomized (with appropriate post -vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate)  
Or two of the following effective forms of contraception:   
• Placement of intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).  Consideration shou ld be given 
to the type of device being used, as there are  higher failure rates quoted for certain types, e.g. 
steel or copper wire. The  risks (in terms of potential stimulation of hormone -responsive breast 
cancer  by [CONTACT_391207]) and ben efits (effective contraception) of  hormone -
releasing IUDs/IUSs should also be carefully considered for  individual patients.  
• Condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository  
• Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal  foam , gel, film, cream or 
suppository.   
The use of barrier contraceptives should always be supplemented with the use of  a spermicide. The 
following should be noted:

PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 78 of 127 • Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are  not highly effective 
forms  of contraception. Therefore the use of additional  spermicides does confer additional 
theoretical contraceptive protection.   
• However, spermicides alone are ineffective at preventing pregnancy when  the whole ejaculate is 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_54073]. Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier  method of contraception and should not be used 
alone.  
It should be noted that two forms of effective contraception are required. A  double barrier method is

To ensure comparability, the baseline and subsequent tumor measurements to assess response 
should be performed using identical imaging techniques (i.e., preferably the same machine, contrast 
agent and standard volume of contrast agent, etc.).

Table 9-2: Evaluation of response in target lesions  
Complete Response 
(CR) Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm . 
Partial Response 
(PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progression (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is 
the smallest on study).  
In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)  
Stable Disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR  nor sufficient increase to qualify 
for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.

relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best response 
would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes CR may be claimed when subsequent 
scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point. Under 
these circumstances, t he original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.

to the underlying malignant disease which requires discontinuation of treatment but without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time, they should be reported as “symptomatic 
deterioration” as the cause of treatment discontinuation. Every effort should be made to document 
the objective progression even after discontinuation o f treatment .  
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g. very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes or 
necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment. If at the 
next scheduled assessment, progression is  confirmed, the date of progression should be the earlier 
date when progression was suspected.  
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the 
evaluation of complete response depends upon this determin ation, it is recommended that the 
residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before confirming the complete response

with a true incidence of 33% is 80 to 90%.  
Cohort 1 efficacy expansion:  40 evaluable patients with observed CBR of > 45% will provide adequate  
precision to exclude 30% (lower limit of 90% CI  > 30%). The threshold for the CBR rate at 24 weeks is 
defined based on the assumption that PFS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 5 
months (clinically relevant) and 3.5 months (not clinically relevant).  
Cohort 2 : [ADDRESS_491024] 45% will provide enough precision to 
exclude 30% (lower limit of 90% CI  > 30%). The threshold for CBR at 24 weeks is defined based on the 
assumption that PFS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 5 months (clinically relevant) 
and 3.5 months (not clinically relevant).   
The final nu mber of patients will depend on the safety and eff icacy outcomes during the study. U p to 
~130 patients are anticipated, allowing for  a total of 40 patients in each of the three planned 
combination regimens and a ~10% rate of non -evaluable patients.

due to disease progression.  
Note : For both cohorts, patients will be enrolled based on  their HER2 status, HR status  (Cohort 2 only) , 
and disease progression on the prior line of therapy , as reported in their medical records. Evaluability 
for the primary endpoint  will be confirmed by [CONTACT_391179] . Any patient found to 
be ineligible retrospectively will not be evaluable for the primary objective  and may  be replaced . Non -
eligible patients are : 
• Cohort 1: patient is not HER2 -positive/amplified  (by [CONTACT_35970]) , and/or disease progression 
under the last line of therapy by [CONTACT_391214] (by [CONTACT_370381]) .

analyzed in the eval uable for efficacy population, and safety will be analyzed in the treated population.  
Quantitative variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables will be 
presented as N, mean and/or median, standard deviation, range. Catego rical variables will be

2014 ) in which  patients had a median of 4 previous regimens for advanced disease including both 
trastuzumab -containing and lapatinib -containing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In this trial the T-DM1 arm  showed a 
median PFS of 6.2 months (95% CI , 5.59  - 6.87) while in the control arm (investigator choice, primarily 
trastuzumab -based regimen) PFS was 3.3 months ( 95% CI, 2.89  - 4.14). It is assumed here that a 
clinically relevant median PFS is 5 months, therefore the activity threshold for CBR at 24 weeks is set 
to 45%.  
Cohor t 2: Eligible patients must have progressed on a maximum of 3 lines of endocrine therapy  in the 
metastatic setting and on a CDK4/6 inhibitor. There are no well -established data that can serve as a 
reference for this population. Our assumptions are based on  the phase  3 BELLE -3 study in patients 
who had progressed on an aromatase inhibitor and everolimus which demonstrated median PFS of 
3.9-4.3 months in the overall and PIK3CA -mutated populations treated with buparlisib (a PI3K 
inhibitor) and fulvestrant, and  1.8 months in the fulvestrant -only arm (Angelo et al., 2016) . It is 
assumed here that a clinically relevant median PFS is 5 months, therefore the activity threshold for 
CBR at 24 weeks is set to 45% . 
Observed CBR in both cohorts will be presented with accompanying 90% exact binomial confidence 
interval.  
Patients with only non -measurable disease at baseline will be analyzed for  best overall response and 
CBR, and will be considered as a SD if their response is a ‘Non -CR/Non -PD’. 
 
14.4.2  Analysis o f Other Efficacy Endpoints  
Observed ORR in both cohorts will be presented with accompanying 90% exact binomial confidence 
interval.  Only patients with measurable disease will be included in analyses.   
For PFS, OS and DoR the survival function will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier product limit 
method; probability estimates and 90% CI will be provided at specified time points; median duration 
and 90% CI will also be provided. DoR will be estimated for  responders only.  
For patients in Cohort 2, the number and proportion of any patients with a PFS ratio ≥ 1.3 (Von Hoff 
et al., 2010)  will be tabulated together with 90% exact CI, along with descripti ve data of the PFS ratio 
for each of these patients . 
For patients with elevated tumor markers (CA15 -3, CEA, and CA27 -29) at baseline, evolution o ver time  
will be evaluated . 
14.4.3  Analysis of the Safety Endpoints  
The safety of MCLA -128 in combination with trastuz umab ± vinorelbine (C ohort 1) or with ET (C ohort 
2) will be assessed by [CONTACT_2695], ECG and LVEF measurements, laboratory test results, and vital signs . 
Adverse events : AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_67503] (MedDRA®) 
preferred term (PT) and by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) according to incidence and severity  (based on 
Protocol  MCLA -128-CL02  Version 5.0, 11 April 2022  
 
 
 
PROPERTY OF MERUS N.V.   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 91 of 127 NCI-CTCAE v. 4.03 ). For each patient, the maximum severity of a given AE recorded will be used. AEs 
of special interest (including IRRs) will be tabulated. In addition, AEs leading to discontinuation of study 
treatment and SAEs will be summarized . 
Cardiac safety : The number and percentage of patients with congestive heart failu re (NCI -CTCAE  
v.4.0 3 grades 3, 4, and 5) and asymptomatic LVEF events (NCI -CTCAE grades 1 and 2, as per MUGA or 
ECHO) at any time during the study will be summarized.  
The baseline LVEF value and the maximum absolute decrease (or minimum absolute increase if 
patients’ post -baseline LVEF measures are all above  the baseline value) in LVEF measures from 
baseline will be summarized. LVEF measurements and change in LVEF from baseline will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_391215].  
For eac h ECHO/MUGA evaluation following the initiation of study drug, the number and percentage 
of patients with  dose delay and/or infusion interruption  and ECHO/MUGA repeated will be 
summarized. The change in LVEF at that time point will be summarized using desc riptive statistics.  
Laboratory data : Laboratory toxicities will be defined based on local laboratory normal ranges and 
CTCAE version 4.03. For parameters without CTCAE grade the tables will be based on normal ranges.  
Toxicities for select laboratory abnorm alities will be tabulated according to incidence and severity, 
and shift tables for the worst post -baseline value will be presented. For each patient, the maximum 
severity of a given laboratory toxicity will be used.  
Vital signs:  Maximal changes in vital signs will be summarized in tabular form.   
14.4.4  Analyses of PK, Immunogenicity , Cytokines  and Biomarkers  
PK, immunogenicity, cytokines and biomarkers will be analyzed centrally and results for each will be 
presented separately . 
For pharmacokinetics, s erum conce ntrations of MCLA -128 and trastuzumab will be measured using 
validated bioanalytical methods  at all time points . Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PK 
parameters. Mean values for C max, C0h, AUC, CL, V ss, tmax and t 1/[ADDRESS_491026]

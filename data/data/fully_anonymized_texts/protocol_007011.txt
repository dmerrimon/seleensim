We quantified hypoxemia on the surgical wards using blinded continuous 
saturation monitoring (n=833). Postoperative hypoxemia was common, serious, and 
prolonged ( Fig. 1). For example, 20% of patients demonstrated an average of 10  minutes 
of saturation <90% per hour over their entire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (Fig. 2). And soberingly, 90% 
of serious hypoxemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (saturation <90% for ≥1 full hour) were completely missed 
by [CONTACT_425917] -hour intervals.5

surgery. The figure on the left shows that by [CONTACT_425918], more than 10% of all 
saturation measurements were <905. The figure on the right shows that desaturation was commo n, 
profound, and prolonged. For example, 10% of patients had a continuous hour of saturation ≤85%. 
Nursing vital sign monitoring at 4 -hour intervals missed more than 90% of these epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].5

misses  >90% epi[INVESTIGATOR_425886].[ADDRESS_538050] respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343].8  
Pulse oximetry alone can lead to inaccurate assessment of patients’ condition, 
especially when supplemental oxygen is needed: the Anesthesia Patient Safety 
Foundation recommended the use of continuous electronic monitoring of oxygenation and 
ventilation  for all patients given postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].[ADDRESS_538051] saturation monitoring with 
pager notification to nurses. They report ed that continuous monitoring reduced emergent 
rescue events (median [95% CI]) from 3.4  [2, 5] to 1.2 [0, 5] per 1,000 patients and 
reduced ICU transfers from 5 [4, 7] to 3 [1, 4] per 1,[ADDRESS_538052] saturation monitoring (n=1,219), but did not find that monitoring resulted 
in a reduction in ICU transfers (6.7% monitoring versus 8.5% control).[ADDRESS_538053] that continuous saturation 
monitoring may be helpful.  
Beyond “failure to rescue”  
Ward monitoring has hardly changed over last half -century, although there have 
been major changes in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295900]. Substantive changes include: 1)  ambulatory 
surgery is routine for relatively healthy patients, with 60% of all surgery in the United 
States now done on an out -patient basis; 2)  it is now common to perform large operations 
in elderly and frail patients; and, 3)  even when patients are admitted after surgery, the 
duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_425887]. Ward patients are therefore muc h sicker now 
than previously.  
In a series of studies, we have shown that conventional intermittent ward vital sign 
monitoring misses most hypoxemia, hypotension, and hypertension. Furthermore, we 
cannot reliably predict which patients will develop respi[INVESTIGATOR_425888]. Continuous ward monitoring is therefore the only approach likely to identify 
instability before it becomes critical or even irreversible.  
Cardiopulmonary events do not occur in isolation. Tachycardia and hypoxemia 
commonly co -exist and often culminate in hypotension which is strongly associated with 
myocardial injury and death.24,25 As might thus be expected, it is well established that vital 
signs deteriorate 6 –12 hours before cardiac and respi[INVESTIGATOR_425889]26-28 — which is 
the basis for having hospi[INVESTIGATOR_425890] -response teams which undoubtedly save lives.29 The 
difficulty is that rapid response teams largely prevent further damage after patients 
experience critical events; patients would be better served if we could detect deterioration 
early and therefore prevent  critical epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
Life-threatening ward complications including cardiocirculatory and respi[INVESTIGATOR_425891].30,[ADDRESS_538054] systems that continuously 
monitor a combination of physiologic variables, such as blood pressure, 
electrocardiogram, heart rate, oxygen saturation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], body position, activity, 
and location.32,33 New biosensor material and digital developments will allow further 
miniaturization of measurement systems, and non -invasive continuous measurement of 
other physiological variables.34 Continuous monitoring is likely to facilitate rapid detection 
of abnormalities and trigger clinical interventions.29  
Silber and colleagues reported in 1992 that critical events occurred at comparable 
rates in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_425892],35 an observation that has subsequently 
been confirmed.36 This led to the concept of “failure to rescue,” the theory being that the 
best hospi[INVESTIGATOR_425893], thus improving 
outcomes.  
The difficulty, of course, is that “failure to rescue” applies after patients experience 
a critical event. Far better would be to prevent  critical events. Or to put this another way, 
we need to move beyond failure to rescue, and instead intervene before  critical events – 
rather than trying to pi[INVESTIGATOR_425894]. Continuous ward monitoring and the 
associated data handling systems may well allow clinicians to intervene before critical 
events — thereby [CONTACT_425920].37-40  
We plan a pi[INVESTIGATOR_425895], along with appropriate alert thresholds, and clinical utility . The 
system is a novel battery -powered untethered monitor for continuous monitoring of 
oxygen saturation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and pulse  rate that is designed for use by [CONTACT_425921]. The initial phase will evaluate patient tolerance, with clinicians and 
patients blinded to monitor data. Results will be used to evaluate the frequency of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_425896]. These data will be used to design clinical 
alert settings , based on various durations at various thresholds (e.g.,  saturation <85% for 
>1 minute). Our main goal will be to identify clinically meaningful vital sign abnormalities 
with a minimum of false alerts. Secondarily, we will evaluate the frequency and duration 
of abnormalities, and the fraction that are detected clinically.   
In the second phase of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], clinicians will be unblinded to the GE Portrait 
monitors, and alerts provided based on the durations and threshold identified in the initial 
part of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. The primary outcomes will be clinician tolerance and the extent to which 
clinicians believe that vital sign trending and  alerts provided useful information rather than 
distraction. Specifically, we will assess the fraction of alerts that clinicians deemed 
meaningful, and the fraction that resulted in clinical interventions. In the third phase of the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], the durations and thresholds for saturation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and pulse rate that 
trigger alerts will be adjusted based on results from the second phase.  
Data obtained in the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_425897] a future robust  
randomized trial comparing clinical interventions and serious complications with blinded 
versus unblinded continuous ward monitoring.   
 
 [ADDRESS_538055] initial data to evaluate the 
frequency and nature of vital sign abnormalities, individually and as a composite, while 
also socializing the Portrait monitor with clinicians. Blinded data collected in thi s phase 
will be recorded for subsequent  analysis and used to design alarm thresholds that will 
identify clinically meaningful events with few "false alarms." The tentative goal will be an 
average of  several alerts per day per monitored patient. Clinicians will be completely 
blinded during this phase.  
Primary Aim.  Collect  blinded data to e valuate the frequency and duration of vital sign 
abnormalities detected by [CONTACT_425922], and the fraction that are detected 
clinically  and the extent to which they overlap .  
Secondary Aim 1.  Design clinically meaningful alerts based on the data collected and 
abnormalities detected while avoiding false alerts. 
Secondary Aim  2. Determine the frequency of the alerts , using criteria  determined in 
Aim 1.  
Secondary  Aim 3. Determine the fraction of potentially serious vital sign abnormalities 
detected by [CONTACT_425923]-hour monitoring  and vice versa .  
  
Second phase  
In the second phase, patients will be randomized to blinded or unblinded GE Portrait 
monitoring. We will determine whether unblinded monitoring reduces the cumulative 
duration of vital sign abnormalities. We will also assess the extent to which clinicians find 
alerts to be useful versus distracting.  
Primary Aim.  Determine whether  patients with  unblinded continuous ward monitoring 
with the GE Portrait Mobile Monitoring Solution experience less time with vital sign 
abnormalities as defined in the initial phase of the study. Specifically, we will test the 
primary hypothesis that the cumulative duration of vital sign abnormalities (using criteria 
determined in Phase  1) is shorte r with unblinded than blinded GE Portrait monitoring  in 
patients recovering from major noncardiac surgery .  
Secondary Aim.  Evaluate the extent to which clinicians believe that alerts from the GE 
Portrait monitor are clinically meaningful.  
 
Third phase  
In this phase, we will refine the alert thresholds developed Phase  1 if necessary. Again, 
we will estimate the extent to which  unblinded monitoring reduces the cumulative duration 
 8 of vital sign abnormalities. And on an exploratory basis, we will determine whether 
unblinded monitoring reduces a composite of interventions for vital sign abnormalities. 
These results will provide guidance for a future full trial with "hard" outcomes.   
Primary Aim. Determine whether unblinded continuous ward monitoring with the GE 
Portrait Mobile Monitoring Solution reduces  vital sign abnormalities. Specifically, we will 
test the primary hypothesis that the cumulative duration of vital sign abnormalities (using 
criteria refined in Phase  2) is shorter with unblinded than blinded GE Portrait monitoring 
in patients recovering f rom major noncardiac surgery.   
Exploratory Aim 1. Determine  whether  continuous ward  saturation, ventilation, and 
pulse rate  monitoring reduces  a collapsed  composite of  substantive  respi[INVESTIGATOR_425898] . Components of the composite will be:  
o Naloxone administration;  
o Insertion of oral or nasal airways;  
o Non-invasive ventilatory support including for bag and mask 
ventilation;  
o Rapid Response Team activation;  
o Unplanned ICU transfer;  
o Unplanned intubation;  
o CPR ; 
o Death . 
 
 
Methods  
We anticipate enrolling patients  cared for  in 2-[ADDRESS_538056] assignments are largely 
determined by [CONTACT_425924]. 
Consent will therefor e be obtained shortly after patients are admitted to one of the 
participating wards.  A screening log will be maintained.  
There will be no restriction on sex, race, or ethnicity; all qualifying patients will be 
asked to consider the study . Our prospective cohort study  will be conducted with all 
necessary regulatory approvals and will be registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. A full 
statistical analysis plan will be developed before any data are evaluated. Reporting will 
be consistent with the CONSORT guidelines. The project will be managed by a Steering  
Committee consisting of study leaders who are not involved in day -to-day enrollment and 
data acquisition.  
We plan to enroll between [ADDRESS_538057] selection  
Consenting patients will be eligible  if they:  
1. Are admitted to one of the wards equipped with the GE Portrait Mobile Monitoring 
Solution ; 
2. Are ≥18 years old;  
3. Are designated American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 -4; 
4. Had major noncardiac surgery lasting at least 1.5  hours;  
5. Are e xpected to remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_425899] s; 
6. Had general anesthesia with or without  neuraxial anesthesia . 
Patients will be ineligible  if they:  
1. Have language, vision, or hearing impairments that may compromise continuous 
monitoring;  
2. Are designated Do Not Resuscitate, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125], or receiving end of life care; 
3. Have previously participated in the study . 
4. Patients who have “ Implantable Minute Ventilation Rate Responsive 
Pacemakers ” 
 
Protocol  
In all cases, good judgement will predominate. Clinicians should always act in their 
patients’ best interests, irrespective of th is protocol.   
Patients will be enrolled postoperatively after admission to a surgical ward. 
Consequently, anesthetic management will not be controlled. Postoperative analgesia will 
be entirely at clinical discretion and can include field, plane, and nerve blocks. No asp ect 
of clinical care is prescribed  by [CONTACT_3181].  
All patients will have normal vital sign assessments by [CONTACT_425925] [ADDRESS_538058] monitoring solution (Fig . 5, 
Appendix  1). Clinicians will be carefully trained not to rely on measurements from the GE 
Portrait, and to always confirm concerning values with conventional monitors and physical 
assessment. Details of network communication are provided in Appendix [ADDRESS_538059] 24 
hours. Investigators will swap depleted batteries for fully charged ones daily. Data from 
the patient module will be transmitted to a small hub in each patient’s room using  MBAN 
(similar to Bluetooth) proprietary secure communication. The hub normally rests in a 
charging dock, and can be taken with patients if they care to leave their rooms. The hub 
retransmits monitor data in real time via the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s secure “internal” W i-Fi system to 
display screens in clinical areas and to the Department of Outcomes Research, which is 
a double -locked card -key controlled location restricted to Departmental investigators.  
During the initial phase of the study, all monitoring will be clinician -blinded.  That is, 
recorded for post hoc analysis. During the subsequent phases of the study, patients will 
be randomly assigned to unblinded versus blinded monitoring. In both cases, information 
from the GE Portrait Monitor will be recorded, but will be available to clinicians only when 
patient s are assigned to unblinded monitoring. Randomization will be based on computer -
generated codes, in random blocks of 4 -8 patients, without strati fication. A web -based 
system will be accessed by [CONTACT_425926]. Allocation will 
therefore be concealed as long as practical.    
Measurements  
Baseline demographic and morphometric characteristics will be recorded, 
including height, weight, and sex. Elements of the STOP -BANG  sleep apnea  
questionnaire will be recorded.7,41,42 Cardiopulmonary risks will be recorded, including 
hypertension requiring treatment, diabetes requiring oral medications or insulin, history of 
previous myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, current smoking  status, and pack -years of smoking history. Cardiovascular and 
pulmonary medications will be similarly recorded by [CONTACT_17203], including beta blockers, 

 11 angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel 
blockers, statins, bronchodilators, and inhaled steroids.  
Baseline laboratory values (within 30 days before surgery) will be recorded on an 
as-available basis, including albumin, BNP, NT -ProBNP,  troponin,  and FEV1. Results of 
sleep studies will be recorded.  
Anesthesia will be characterized as general, neuraxial, or combined. Use of 
peripheral  plane and  nerve blocks will also be recorded. Routine anesthetic variables will 
be recorded including  time-weighted average  volatile anesthetic partial pressure, fluid 
type and volume, estimated blood loss, and transfusions.  Postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_425900] (Appendix  3).[ADDRESS_538060] hemoglobin and troponin concentrations obtained during the initial four 
postoperative days.  
Outcome definitions  
Initial phase  
Primary Aim . As in previous studies,5,44 we will present vital sign abnormalities  as 
continuous functions of duration and severity of vital sign abnormalities. An advantage of 
this approach is that we do not need to pre -define thresholds and will instead present 
various  combinations of durations and thresholds for bradycardia, tachycardia, saturation, 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. See Figure  2 as an example for saturation.  
However, to evaluate clinical detection of vital sign abnormalities we need to define 
thresholds. We will consider the following thresholds and continuous durations to be 
clinically meaningful: A) saturation <90% for 30  minutes; B) heart  rate >110 beats/min  for 
30 minutes;  C heart rate  <40 beats/min  for 15  minutes;  D) respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] < 6/minute for 
30 minutes or <3/minute for 10 minutes; and, E) respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] >20 for 30  minutes. 
Because physiological signals are inherently noisy, all values will be electronically 
smoothed to some degree, but raw data summaries will be used as a cross -check (see 
Data Analysis for details).   
Secondary Aim [ADDRESS_538061] while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. Components of the 
composite wil l be: A)  saturation  <85% for ≥60  seconds,5 B) pulse  rate >130 beats/min  for 
30 secs ,45 C) pulse rate  <40 beats/min  for 30 secs,46 D) low respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] <4/minute for 
30 secs E) high respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] >25 for 120 secs, and, F) apnea >120 secs . 
Phases 2 and 3  
An investigator will ask the relevant clinician (usually a nurse) to rate each alert as 
clinically meaningful or not.  Specifically, clinicians will be asked to rate alerts as “critical,” 
“important,” “informative,” or “false or distracting.”  The terms  will intentionally not be 
further defined,  thereby  [CONTACT_425927] s to determine  themselves  the extent to which  
 12 a given  alert was helpful or not. Caregivers will be queried in person shortly after each 
alert, typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 15 minutes.  The thresholds, determined in the initial phase, will be 
set to generate an average of  about  2 alerts per patient per day — and therefore will not 
be onerous for clinicians.    
We will also evaluate the  following i nterventions in our composite:  1) drugs that 
slow or speed heart rate ; 2) administration of bronchodilators ; 3) initiating or increasing 
oxygen administration  (increment in oxygen concentration, flow rate, or administration 
mode); 4)  mask, CPAP or high -flow oxygen (e.g.,  60 L/min) respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] ; 
5) nursing requests for physician evaluation; 6)  activation of a Rapid Response Team; 
7) intubation; 8)  cardiopulmonary arrest; and, 8)  transfer to a monitored ward or crit ical 
care unit . Investigators, in consultation with clinicians, will determine which interventions 
were made, and whether they were prompted by [CONTACT_425928].  
Data management  
Study  data will be entered into a custom secure Redcap database that will be 
maintained on secure Cleveland Clinic servers and backed up to remote sites nightly. The 
system will record who accessed the randomization system and when it was accessed. 
The database  will include appropriate logic and range checks, and track all changes.  
Most data will be obtained directly from the GE Portrait monitor and electronic 
records. Other values will be entered manually directly entered into Redcap from source 
documents or initially recorded on case report forms for subsequent transfer to Redcap.  
Data analysis  
Pulse oximetry data are difficult to analyze due to the high degree of variability in 
saturation that occurs within each patient. We will thus use an approach similar to our 
previous analysis.5 On one hand, patients might experience frequent, short epi[INVESTIGATOR_425901], while on the other hand, average SpO 2 may linger within slightly 
abnormal or dangerous territory for hours. The latter is difficult to ascertain from the raw 
SpO 2 data. We will therefore consider both raw and smoothed (or filtered) SpO [ADDRESS_538062] two analyses: First,  to assess the overall 
exposure to hypoxemia for each patient, we will summarize the distribution of number of 
hypoxic minutes per hour of monitoring using incidence curves. Various thresholds 
defining hypoxemia will be used to generate the incidence curve s. Second,  we will use 
quantile regression47 to characterize the median, quartiles, 10th and 90th percentiles, and 
5th and 95th percentiles of the distribution of SpO 2 across patients as a function of 
postoperative time. Nonlinearities in these quantile curves will be taken into account by 
[CONTACT_425929].  
For the analyses of filtered SpO 2 data, we will smooth each individual patient’s 
SpO 2-versus -time profile using a Gaussian kernel smoother (i.e., the smoothed estimate 
of SpO 2 for a specific time point will be a weighted average of the surrounding SpO 2 
 13 values, where the weights will be determined according to a Gaussian distribution 
centered at that time point with an inter -quartile range of 3 hours). Using the smoothed 
profiles, we will then estimate the incidence of hypoxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_425902] 
a range of SpO [ADDRESS_538063] blinded data to evaluate the frequency and duration of vital sign 
abnormalities detected by [CONTACT_425922], the fraction that are detected clinically, 
and the overlap between them. We will use descriptive statistics such as median 
[quarti les] and mean (SD) to summarize clinical detection of vital sign abnormalities using 
the definitions given in Outcome Definitions using both the raw data and also using the 
data smoothing techniques described above.  Raw data summaries will be h elpful so that 
truly extreme values are not routinely “smoothed away” in the algorithms described in 
Data Analysis.  
Secondary Aim 1.  We will design clinically meaningful alerts based on the data collected 
and abnormalities detected, while avoiding false alerts. This will involve estimating 
sensitivity and specificity for detecting true abnormalit ies across the range of possible 
alert cut -points and choosing cut -points which maximize both sensitivity and specificity.  
Accuracy , along with  positive and negative predictive value s, will be reported.  All 
estimates will be reported with confidence intervals.   
Secondary Aim  2. We will determine the optimal frequency of the alerts, using criteria 
determined in Secondary Aim  1. This will be largely  descriptive, but will involve a tradeoff 
between increasing the frequency of alerts and the corresponding loss to sensitivity and 
specificity.  
Secondary  Aim 3. We will estimate the proportion and corresponding confidence interval 
of potentially serious vital sign abnormalities detected by [CONTACT_425930] -hour monitoring, and vice versa.  
Phase II  
Primary Aim. We will assess the treatment effect of unblinded continuous ward 
monitoring versus blinded monitoring on the cumulative duration of the various vital sign 
abnormalities using parametric (e.g., s -sample t -test) or non -parametric (e.g., Wilcoxon -
Mann -Whitney  test), as appropriate.  
Secondary Aim.  In the unblinded group we will evaluate the fraction of  alerts from the 
GE Portrait monitor that clinicians designate dichotomously as  clinically meaningful . 
Results will be presented as a percentage with 95% confidence intervals.  
 
Phase III  
Primary Aim.  We will test whether and estimate the extent to which unblinded continuous 
ward monitoring with the GE Portrait Mobile Monitoring Solution reduces the time with 
 [ADDRESS_538064] effects generalized 
estimating equation (GEE) model which estimates a separate treatment ef fect for each 
component and then averages them (average relative effect method, ARE).[ADDRESS_538065] (or “global”) treatment effect across the components 
in a GE model estimating a sin gle effect.   
 
Sample Size Considerations  
We plan for [ADDRESS_538066] 90% power at the 0.[ADDRESS_538067] 90% power at the 0.[ADDRESS_538068] in their 
patients’ best interests, irrespective of th is protocol.   
The study will be conducted with IRB approval and written patient consent. The 
study will be restricted to designated wards because active nursing engagement and 
training will be required.  Furthermore, the GE monitoring system will only be available in 
selected wards.     
The study  will be guided by a  Steering  Committee that will review enrollment, 
protocol compliance, data quality,  and adverse events. Safety will be evaluated  after each 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731] , and more often if deemed necessary.  
Patients will be paid $1/hour of successful monitoring time, to a maximum of [ADDRESS_538069] is:  
1) The device itself is battery powered, external, and presumably inherently risk -
free. Detailed documentation of  design and process control, and electrical 
safety is provided in Appendix 1; 
2) Clinical staff will never make clinical decision based on values from the GE 
Portrait monitor. Any potential abnormalities will be confirmed with convention 
monitors and clinical examinations. To the extent that alerts are unfounded, 
they will disrupt nurses but not harm patients. Based on the initial blinded 
portion of the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], alert thresholds will be designed to occur no more 
often than an average of twice per day per patient.  
3) True alerts (confirmed with conventional monitors) will potentially improve care

4) Continuous monitoring data will be transmitted with a secure proprietary 
communication algorithm (similar to Bluetooth) to a hub in patient rooms, and 
from there to the Clinic’s internal secure Wi -Fi system. Connections to the 
Clinic’s data system will be made with full approval from the responsible HIPAA 
data security team. Ward monitoring data will thus be as secure as other clinical 
data.  
The major risk to patients will be discomfort from wearing the GE Portrait Mobile 
Monitoring Solution . However, the level of discomfort will be slight since the system 
consists of a small light -weight battery powered unit and several “stick -on” pads. Of 
 [ADDRESS_538070] the prerogative to remove the system themselves 
should it become burdensome.  
Nurses will be key participants  in the study, and their responses to alerts are 
important outcomes.  (We consider them  to be  co-investigators.)  Specifically, they will 
have the option to respond to alerts from the GE Portrait system, and their responses will 
be recorded. We will also ask them to rate the utility of the alerts. Specific alerts thresholds 
will be based on the results of the initial phase of the study and will be designed to not 
exceed an average of 2 alerts per patient per day. Use of the moni tors will thus minimally 
disturb nurses even if all  alerts are considered distractions — which seems highly unlikely . 
No record of nurse  identification  will be kept. That is, nurse  responses will be completely 
unlinked to individuals.   
Data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_425932]. De -identified data will be shared 
with GE  at the end of study for future research, product development , and marketing 
purposes .

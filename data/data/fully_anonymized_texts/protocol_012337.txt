Protocol Title:   High-Resolution Assessment of Coronary Plaques in 
a Global  Evolocumab Randomized Study (HUYGENS) 
Short Protocol Title:   Imaging of Coronary Plaques in Subjects Treated With 
Evolocumab 
Study Phase:   3 
Indication:   Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) 
Rationale 
Plaque morphology plays pi[INVESTIGATOR_54480] 
(ACS).  Lipid-lowering therapy with statins has proven to have beneficial effects on 
plaque morphology in patients suffering from coronary artery disease (CAD) .  Treatment 
with evolocumab in addition to optimal statin therapy has been shown to result in a 
regression of atherosclerotic plaque burden.  While treatment with evolocumab is 
associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events, it is uncertain whether additional 
effects on plaque, beyond regression, may contribute to this benefit.  The developmen t 
of advanced imaging techniques permits evaluation of the effect of treatment on plaque 
phenotype features consistent with plaque  instability .  This study seeks to identify 
morphologic changes, such as increase in fibrous cap thickness (FCT), in atherosclerotic 
plaques associated with treatment with evolocumab and maximally tolerated statin 
therapy with or without additional lipid-modifying medication in patients presenting with 
non-ST -segment elevation (NSTE)-ACS using optical coherence tomography (OCT; 
primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS; 
exploratory endpoints only - see Section 4.1 of the protocol ).

Objective(s)/Endpoint(s) 
 
Objectives  Endpoints  
Primary  
 To evaluate the effect of evolocumab 
on fibrous cap thickness (FCT) in 
subjects with non -ST-elevation acute 
coronary syndrome (NSTE -ACS) who 
are taking maximally tolerated statin 
therapy.   Absolute  change in minimum FCT in a 
matched segment of artery as 
determined by [CONTACT_15503] (OCT) from baseline to 
week 50.  
Secondary  
 To evaluate the effects of evolocumab 
on coronary plaque morphology in 
subjects with NSTE -ACS who are 
taking max imally tolerated statin 
therapy.   Coronary artery segment -based:  
 Percent change in minimum FCT 
in a matched segment of artery as 
determined by [CONTACT_54506] 50.  
 Absolute change in mean 
minimum FCT for all images 
assessed in an individual subject  
as determined by [CONTACT_54507] 50.  
 Absolute change in the maximum 
lipid arc in a matched segment of 
artery as determined by [CONTACT_54507] 50.  
 Plaque -based:  
 Absolute change in minimum FCT, 
maximum lipid arc, and lipid core 
length in  lipid rich plaques defined 
as minimum FCT <  120 μm and 
lipid arc > 90 ° in at least 
[ADDRESS_58555] from baseline 
to week 50.  
Safety  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability 
of evolocumab treatment in subjects 
with NSTE -ACS who are taking 
maximally tolerated statin therapy.   Subject incidence of 
treatment -emergent adverse events 
and serious adverse events.  
 
Hypotheses 
The primary hypothesis  is that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering with 
evolocumab 420 mg monthly (QM) will result in a  greater increase from baseline in 
Approved

Protocol Number:  20160184 
Date:  [ADDRESS_58556] at 
baseline and at week 50 in subjects with an NSTE-ACS.  The trial duration of 1 year was 
chosen based on the results of several historical trials.   Subjects will be randomized 
1:1 into 2 treatment groups no more than 7 days after the signing of the informed 
consent:  evolocumab 420 mg subcutaneously (SC) QM or placebo SC QM.  The 
randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_54508] (> 4 weeks or ≤ 4 weeks duration) at 
screening.  Investigators will up-titrate statin therapy to the maximally tolerated dose, in 
accordance with local guidelines, for subjects prior to randomization.

For a full list of eligibility criteria, please refer to Section 6.1 to Section 6.2. 
Treatments 
Evolocumab QM will be administered on day 1 through week 48 with a personal injector 
or prefilled autoinjector/pens (AI/Pens ). 
Subcutaneous evolocumab and placebo will be administered at the study site or in an 
appropriate non-clinic setting (eg, at home).  Observed, in-clinic dosing must occur at 
day [ADDRESS_58560] at 
home may return to the clinic for injection. 
Evolocumab or matching placebo will be administered in accordance with instructions in 
the IPIM and the Information for Use (IFU).  The subject (or designee) must have 
demonstrated competency, as per site judgment, at administration of SC injections 
before self-administration is permitted.  The first self-administered dose by [CONTACT_423] 
(or designee) must be administered at the site under the supervision of a healthcare 
provider.   
It is suggested that the evolocumab administration is done by [CONTACT_54514] (except day 1) to reinforce proper use of 
the injection device.  If evolocumab or matching placebo is to be administered during the 
study visit, administration must occur after all other procedures have been completed. 
Procedures 
Written informed consent must be obtained from all subjects or legally acceptable 
representatives before any study-specific procedures are performed.  Subjects will be 
assessed for eligibility and medical as well as medication history will be obtained.  
Subjects will undergo clinically-indicated coronary angiography for further clinical 
evaluation.  Subjects who require a PCI  because of qualifying angiography will have

LDL-C results are available.  If angiographic criteria are met, the subject will have 
baseline OCT and IVUS completed .  Subjects should undergo all  labs and receive a 
3.5 mL placebo injection by [CONTACT_54515] , at 
screening. 
At randomization, an Interactive Voice Response System/Interactive Web Response 
System (IVRS/IWRS) will allocate subjects to receive either evolocumab SC QM or 
placebo SC QM.  Day 1 of the treatment period (ie, first dose of investigational product) 
must happen within [ADDRESS_58562] will be administered monthly (every 4 weeks ± 3 days).  Final administration of 
evolocumab or placebo will occur at week 48. 
Subjects must fast overnight when fasting lipid samples are to be obtained  (ie, 
day 1, week 24, and week 50).  If the subject is not fasting for the day [ADDRESS_58563] administration.  
During the week 4, 12, 24, 36, and 50 visits, adverse events, serious adverse events , 
and concomitant medications will be recorded .  Physical exams, laboratory tests and 
other procedures will be performed at the time points indicated in the Schedule of 
Activities (Table 2-1 ).   
Final follow-up OCT and IVUS should take place at 50 ± 2 weeks (ie, 48 to 52 weeks) 
after initial baseline image acquisition.  In any case, it is critical that the follow-up OCT 
and IVUS be obtained for all subjects, regardless of whether they discontinued study 
drug prematurely or are outside the 50 ± 2 weeks window. 
End of study (EOS) for all subjects is by [CONTACT_54516] (eg, phone call) from the site at

Date:  [ADDRESS_58567] of study procedures , including the timing of each procedure, please refer to 
Section  9.2 and the Schedule of Activities in Table  2-1. 
Statistical Considerations  
The planned total sample size is 150 subjects (75 randomized to evolocumab 
420 mg SC QM and 75 randomized to placebo SC QM).  This sample size will provide 
sufficient power (90%) to determine whether there is a treatment effect of evolocumab 
relative to placebo in the primary endpoint.   The primary endpoint for the study is the 
absolute change in minimum fibrous cap thickness (FCT) from baseline to week 50 in a 
matched segment of artery as determined by [CONTACT_7349] (OCT).   
Hypothesis testing of the primary endpoint will be the primary objective of the final 
analysis.  There will be no interim analysis for this study.  The final analysis will be 
conducted after all subjects have either completed all the scheduled study visits or have 
early terminated from the study.  At that time, the database will be cleaned and locked 
follow ed by  [CONTACT_54517] .

3. Introduction 
3.1 Study Rationale 
Plaque morphology plays pi[INVESTIGATOR_54480] 
(ACS) (Toutouzas et al, 2011 ; Ino et al, 2011 ).  Lipid-lowering therapy with statins has 
proven to have beneficial effects on plaque morphology in patients suffering from 
coronary artery disease (CAD) ( Takarada et al, 2009).   Treatment with evolocumab in 
addition to optimal statin therapy has been shown to result in a regression of 
atherosclerotic plaque burden ( Nicholls et al, 2016).  While treatment with evolocumab is 
associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events (Sabatine et al, 2017 ), it is 
uncertain whether additional effects on plaque, beyond regression, may contribute to this 
benefit.  The development of advanced imaging techniques permits evaluation of the 
effect of treatment on plaque phenotype features consistent with plaque instability.  This 
study seeks to identify morphologic changes, such as increase in fibrous cap thickness 
(FCT), in atherosclerotic plaques associated with treatment with evolocumab and 
maximally tolerated statin therapy with or without additional lipid-modifying medication in 
patients presenting with non -ST-segment elevation (NSTE)-ACS using opt ical 
coherence tomography (OCT; primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints) and 
intravascular ultrasound (IVUS; exploratory endpoints only - see Section 4.1). 
3.2 Background 
3.2.1  Cardiovascular Disease 
According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause 
of death and disability, accounting for approximately 31% of all deaths and 46% of 
deaths from noncommunicable diseases worldwide ( World Health Organization, 2014 ).  
Of deaths related to cardiovascular disease, approximately 80% are from myocardial 
infarction or stroke ( World Health Organization, 2014 ).  The morbidity associated with 
myocardial infarction and stroke continues to be serious and multifaceted, the reduction 
of which is an important treatment goal.  Each year, it is estimated that 
[ADDRESS_58575] a new stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), and 
[ADDRESS_58576] a recurrent stroke ( Mozaffarian et al, 2016 ). 
Elevated cholesterol, in particular low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), is a 
modifiable in dependent cardiovascular risk factor (Silverman et al, 2016 ).  The effects  of 
LDL-C on cardiovascular risk likely begin at the level of the arterial wall since low-density 
lipoprotein particles drive atheroma formation and progression

(Moore and Tabas, 2011 ).  The formation of flow obstructing lesions and/or acute plaque 
rupture with subsequent thrombogenesis result in clinical sequelae including coronary 
heart, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial diseases.  Results from imaging studies 
demonstrated that reductions in LDL -C can slow or halt coronary atheroma progression 
or even reduce their volume ( Räber et al, 2015 ; Nicholls et al, 2016 ; Nicholls et al, 
2011; Nissen et al, 2006 ; Nissen et al, 2004 ).  These data illustrate important biologic 
effects of LDL-C reduction and support a potential mechanism by [CONTACT_54518]-C 
reduces risk of cardiovascular events. 
Many interventional studies evaluated the impact of therapeutic reductions in LDL-C on 
cardiovascular outcomes ( Silverman et al, 2016 ; Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' [CTT]  
Collaboration et al, 2010 ).  A meta-analysis ( Silverman et al, 2016 ) included 
[ADDRESS_58577] primarily via low-density lipoprotein receptor 
(LDLR) upregulation.  Results from these studies show a strong relationship between 
LDL-C lowering and cardiovascular event reduction for drugs such as statins 
(Can non et al, 2004; Sacks et al, 1996 ; Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study 
Group, 1994) and ezetimibe ( Cannon et al, 2015). 
3.2.[ADDRESS_58578] are well-established imaging modalities 
frequently used in clinical practice (Matthews and Frishman, 2017 ). 
Intravascular ultrasound uses an ultrasound transducer mounted on a coronary catheter.  
It provides cross-sectional, grey-scale images and can cover the entire circumference of 
the coronary artery wall from the inner border to the outer layer, thereby [CONTACT_54519] n.  With IVUS, large coronary segments can be 
visualized in a standardized and reproducible manner using automated pullback of the 
ultrasound probe (Nair et al, 2002 ; Nissen et al, 1991 ).  In addition, IVUS has proven to 
be a valuable tool in clinical trials ( Nicholls et al, 2016 ); however, IVUS image acquisition 
can be limited or impaired due to transducer rotation, guide wires and other mechanical 
hindrances, as well as anatomical and physiological aspects such as the heartbeat,

tortuous arteries, and bifurcations of side branches (ten  Hoff et al, 1989 ).  While IVUS  is 
reproducible for quantitative serial plaque volume measurements, it cannot elucidate all 
features of plaque morphology due to insufficient spatial resolution .  Virtual histology 
data acquired using specialized IVUS catheters may have the ability to provide 
additional information on plaque composition (eg, visualizing calcifications and 
quantification of the necrotic core).  However, IVUS -virtual histology has limited ability to 
assess incremental changes in FCT over time ( Puri et al, 2014 ). 
Optical coherence tomography is based on coherent light; hence, it does not penetrate 
as deeply into the tissue and may therefore not always be able to visualize the entire 
arterial wall, but it provides a higher spatial resolution compared to IVUS.  In addition, 
OCT is not limited by [CONTACT_27227]-field artifacts, a feature commonly seen with 
ultrasound-based imaging techniques.  The practical approach to OCT shares many 
similarities with IVUS, including some of the mechanical challenges regarding image 
acquisition.  Similar to IVUS, coronary catheters carrying the imaging probe are used to 
acquire cross-sectional images, which are usually color-coded in sepia.  These catheters 
can be operated manually or via automat ed pullback (Bezerra et al, 2009 ; 
Kume et al, 2005) allowing for a high degree of standardization and reliable 
reproducibility even when imaging large coronary segments (Kini et al, 2017 ; 
Jamil et al, 2013; Gonzalo et al, 2010 ).  Optical coherence tomography’s high -resolution 
images enable clear delineation and exact measurements of individual layers of the 
vessel wall, including the thin intima.  Thus, a strength of OCT lies in its ability to assess 
intimal disease (Kubo et al, 2 007; Yabushita et al, 2002 ). 
All imaging techniques have their respective characteristics; they complement each 
other and provide interventional cardiologists with a solid armamentarium to assess 
coronary artery disease.  Thus, it is possible to reveal morphologic differences of culprit 
lesion in STEMI and NSTEMI patients, such as the incidence of plaque rupture as well 
as the length, size, and location of the aperture in those ruptured plaques 
(Ino et al, 2011;  Toutouzas et al, 2011 ).  It is likely that such refined diagnostic tools will 
help physicians select the most appropriate treatment for patients (Bezerra et al, 2013 ).  
Moreover, the individual cardiovascular risk can be assessed in more detail and 
addressed accordingly ( Tanaka et al, 2008 ).  
In recent years, different features of plaque morphology  such as FCT, calcifications , and 
size of necrotic core have been recognized as determining factors for the risk of acute 
coronary syndromes, with FCT being the most important predicting factor

(Stone et al, 2011;  Virmani et al, 2006 ).  Some publications suggest that FCT < 65 μm is 
associated with a high risk for future cardiovascular events (Stefanadis et al, 2017 ; 
Burke et al, 1997). 
3.2.[ADDRESS_58579] Background:  Evolocumab 
Recycling of the hepatic cell surface LDLR plays a critical role in regulating serum LDL-C 
levels.  Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9 ) binds to the LDLR and 
downregulates hepatic cell surface LDLR, which, in turn, leads to increased levels of 
circulating LDL-C.  Humans with PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations have cholesterol 
levels lower than normal and reduced incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) 
(Abifadel et al, 2009 ).  Evolocumab (formerly referred to as AMG 145) is a fully human 
monoclonal immunoglobulin G2, developed at [COMPANY_010] Inc., that specifically binds to 
PCSK9, preventing its interaction with the LDLR.  The inhibition of PCSK9 by

3.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment 
The following benefit risk assessment supports the conduct of this clinical trial.  
Reference should be made to the Evolocum ab (AMG 145) Investigator’s Brochure  for 
further data on evolocumab . 
3.3.1  Benefits of Evolocumab 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reduction in Low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)  
In the original marketing application, placebo -adjusted reductions in LDL-C of 
approximately 55% to 75% were consistently observed with evolocumab in subjects with 
primary hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (familial or non-familial) or mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].  Evolocumab was 
also superior to ezetimibe in these subjects, comparatively reducing LDL-C by 
[CONTACT_3450] 35% to 45%.  LDL-C reductions with evolocumab treatment occurred 
regardless of cardiovascular risk level, statin use (none, low, moderate, or high intensity) 
or baseline LDL-C.  The approved evolocumab dosing regimens of 140 mg every 
2 weeks (Q2W) and [ADDRESS_58580]; to date, 
results from long-term studies show LDL-C reductions of approximately 60% maintained 
over [ADDRESS_58581]:   Evolocumab 
Protocol Number:  20160184 
Date:  19 April 2018  Page 21 of 94  
CONFIDENTIAL   
Data on reduction in LDL-C from both Study 20120153 (a 78-week, phase 3 study in 
subjects with clinical signs or symptoms of coronary artery disease [n = 968]) and 
Study 20110118 (a phase 3 study in subjects with or at risk for atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease [n = 27  564]), were consistent with that reported in the original 
evolocumab marketing application in subjects with hypercholesterolemia.  In 
Study 20120153, mean reductions from bas eline in LDL-C were approximately 60% in 
the evolocumab group and were maintained through end of study (week 78).  In 
Study 20110118, median reductions in LDL-C of 64% to 70% were observed during 
evolocumab treatment and these reductions were maintained over the duration of the 
study (> 36 months) without attenuation of effect.  Of note, Study [ADDRESS_58582] on-treatment LDL-C concentrations achieved to date in any cardiovascular 
outcomes study involving a lipid lowering agent, with 25% of subjects achieving 
LDL-C concentrations < 20 mg/dL.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Regression of Coronary Atherosclerosis 
In Study 20120153, statistically significant regression in coronary atherosclerosis was 
observed at week 78 in comparison with placebo.  Evolocumab, when added to statin 
therapy, reduced percent atheroma volume (PAV) by -1.01% ( -1.38%, -0.64%), 
compared with placebo at week 78 (p < 0.0001).  Evolocumab also reduced total 
atheroma volume (TAV) by -4.89% ( -7.25%, -2.53%), compared with placebo, at 
week 78 (p < 0.0001).   Evolocumab resulted in more regression in coronary 
atherosclerosis at week 78, compared with placebo, as measured by [CONTACT_54521]; 
atherosclerosis regression was achieved by 17.0% (95% CI:  10.3, 23.5 [p < 0.0001]) 
and 12.5% (95% CI:  5.8, 19.1 [p = 0.000 2]) more subjects, respectively, in the 
evolocumab group compared with the placebo group.  In subjects with baseline 
LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL, a total of 61.0% (95% CI:  55.9, 66.1) of evolocumab-treated 
subjects experienced atherosclerosis regression, as measured by [CONTACT_54522], 
compared with 47.1% (95% CI:  41.9, 52.4) in the placebo group.  Reducing LDL-C had 
favorable effects on coronary atherosclerosis even at very low concentrations of LDL-C.  
Adding evolocumab to statin therapy reduced LDL-C from baseline by 60% (at the end 
of the dosing interval) to 68% ([ADDRESS_58583]-dose), and LDL C reductions were 
maintained through end of study at week 78.  Subjects with baseline LDL-C levels below 
the lowest global targets in use at the time of the study also experienced plaque 
regression while receiving evolocumab.  In addition, post-hoc analysis suggested a 
continuous relationship between achieved LDL-C and reductions in PAV, with evidence 
of regression in PAV extending to on-treatment LDL C levels as low as 7 mg/d L.  In

statins alone. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reduction in the Risk of Cardiovascular Events 
In Study 20110118, treatment with evolocumab statistically significantly reduced the risk 
of cardiovascular events.  With a median follow-up period of [ADDRESS_58585] (primary 
composite endpoint) by 15%, compared with placebo with a hazard ratio (HR) of 
0.85 (95% CI:  0.79, 0.92; p < 0.0001).  Evolocumab reduced the risk of cardiovascular 
death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, whichever occurred first (key secondary 
composite endpoint) by 20%, compared with placebo with a HR of 0.80 (95% CI:  
0.73,  0.88; p  < 0.0001).  The treatment effect was driven by [CONTACT_54523], stroke, and coronary revascularization (primary composite endpoint); and by 
[CONTACT_54524] (secondary composite endpoint), without a 
detectable effect on cardiovascular death.  The primary and key secondary treatment 
effects were directionally consistent across subgroups.  There was a clear relationship 
between reductions in LDL-C and lower rates of cardiovascular events.  This relationship 
was observed across the spectrum of post baseline LDL-C levels, and no lower LDL-C 
threshold for this relationship was identified for post-baseline LDL-C levels (mean of 
lowest decile, 16.2 mg/dL [0.42 mmol/L]).  Overall, results from this study provide 
compelling evidence that evolocumab, through effects on lowering LDL-C, reduces the 
risk for cardiovascular events in patients with or at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease who cannot achieve LDL-C control with statins alone. 
3.3.2  Risks of Evolocumab 
The safety profile provided in the original evolocumab application includes more than 
6800 subjects in > [ADDRESS_58586] infection, arthralgia, back pain, rash, and urticaria.  There were no important 
identified risks.  Hypersensitivity was determined to be an important potential risk based 
on the adverse events of rash and urticaria; most events were mild to moderate and 
non-serious.  Evolocumab had a very low rate of immunogenicity (0.1%) which did not 
affect pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, or safety.

Date:  [ADDRESS_58587] were balanced between treatment groups, with the 
exception of injection site reactions and hypersensitivity events (rash and urticaria), 
which are known adverse drug reactions with evolocumab.  These events occurred in a 
slightly higher percentage of evolocumab subjects than placebo subjects, were generally 
mild to moderate, nonserious , and did not lead to treatment discontinuation.  The 
development of anti-evolocumab antibodies post-baseline was infrequent (0.3%) .  
Anti-evolocumab antibodies were non-neutralizing and not associated with loss of 
efficacy or any safety concerns.  In addition, there were no trends indicative of clinically 
important treatment-related laboratory abnormalities.  No safety risk of very low LDL-C 
during treatment with evolocumab was identified.  Among the evolocumab-treated 
subjects with post-baseline LDL-C measurements during evolocumab treatment and 
within [ADDRESS_58588] dose, who achieved a minimum LDL-C < 40 mg/dL 
(88.4%) and a minimum LDL-C < 25 mg/dL (69.9%), overall incidences of adverse 
events were similar between the evolocumab and placebo groups regardless of 
achieved LDL-C concentrations.  In subjects not known to have pre-existing diabetes 
mellitus at baseline, a comparable proportion in each treatment group 
(8.1% evolocumab, 7.7% placebo) developed positively adjudicated new onset diabetes 
mellitus.  No evidence of neurocognitive safety risk was observed based on review of 
adverse events from Study 20110118 and objective data from its neurocognitive 
sub-study (Study 20130385).  Study 20130385  used a validated, objective assessment 
of higher -level executive function (Cambridge Neuropsychological Text Automated 
Battery [CANTAB]) and demonstrated non-inferiority of evolocumab compared with 
placebo.  Neither analysis showed evidence for concern in subjects who achieved 
LDL-C levels < 40 mg/dL and < 25 mg/dL at least once. 
Study 20120153 included a total of 968 subjects (484 evolocumab, 484 placebo) in the 
safety analysis set.  The overall adverse event incidences were similar to those reported 
in the original evolocumab application and no new safety risks were identified.  The 
incidence, type and severity of events were comparable between the evolocumab and 
placebo groups. 
In the integrated safety set (which included Study  20110118 and Study  20120153), a 
slightly higher incidence of potential events of hypersensitivity were observed in the 
evolocumab group compared to the control group.  Most of the adverse events were 
non-serious, reported as grade [ADDRESS_58589]:   Evolocumab 
Protocol Number:  20160184 
Date:  [ADDRESS_58590] one LDL-C value < 40 mg/dL.  Adding evolocumab to high- to 
moderate-intensity statin therapy significantly reduced cardiovascular events.  
Evolocumab provided robust, consistent, and predictable LDL-C reduction across all 
populations and patient subgroups studied, regardless of cardiovascular risk, statin use 
(none, low, moderate, or high intensity), or baseline LDL-C.  In addition, these analyses 
suggest a consistent relationship between lower achieved LDL-C and lower 
cardiovascular event rates to LDL-C levels as low as 16.2 mg/dL (mean LDL-C in lowest 
decile). 
The safety data for evolocumab to date indicated no important identified risks.  
Hypersensitivity is an important potential risk; the incidence of hypersensitivity events is 
low and adverse events are mild to moderate in severity. 
Based on the above evidenc e, the benefit -risk profile of evolocumab is favorable for 
use in: 
 adults with hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], as an adjunct to diet to reduce LDL-C.  
 adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over with HoFH to reduce LDL-C, TC, 
ApoB, and non-HDL -C in combination with other lipid-lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, statins, 
low-density lipoprotein [LDL] apheresis). 
 adults with coronary artery disease for regression of coronary atherosclerosis. 
 patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular events.

6.[ADDRESS_58607] Enrollment 
Before subjects begin participat ion in any study -specific activities/procedures, [COMPANY_010] 
requires a copy of the site’s written institutional review board/independent ethics 
committee (IRB/IEC)  approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and all other 
subject information and/or recruit ment material, if applicable (see  Appendix 3 ). 
All subject s must personally sign and date the IRB/IEC and [COMPANY_010] approved informed 
consent before commencement of study -specific procedures.  
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met 
all eligibility criteria.  The investigator is to document this decision and date, in the 
subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment case report form (CRF).  
Each subject who enters into the screening period for the study ( defined as when the 
subject signs the IRB/IEC approved informed consent form ) receives a unique subject 
identification number before any study -related activities/procedures are performed.  The 
subject identification number will be assigned by [CONTACT_54531]/IWR S.  This number will be 
used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study 
documen tation related to that subject.

7.2 Method of Treatment Assignment 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1  allocation ratio, evolocumab to placebo, 
respectively, in a d ouble -blind  manner.  
The randomization will be performed by [CONTACT_54537]/IWRS. 
The randomization number will be provided once eligibility into the study has been 
confirmed.  A site representative will make the randomization call to the IVRS/IWRS to 
assign a randomization number to the subject.  The randomization call to the IVRS is 
accomplished by [CONTACT_54538]/IWRS user 
manual.  A confirmation fax /electronic-mail (e-mail) will be sent to the site to verify that 
the correct information has been entered and confirm the randomization number 
assigned. 
The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_54508] (> 4 weeks or ≤ 4 weeks) at 
screening.  
The randomization date is to be documented in the subject’s medical record and on the 
enrollment CRF. 
7.[ADDRESS_58618]’s treatment assignment is to only be unblinded when knowledge of the 
treatment is essential for further clinical management of the subject on this study.  
Unblinding at the study site for any other reason will b e considered a protocol deviation.  
The [COMPANY_010]  Trial Manager must be notified before the blind is broken unless 
identification of the study treatment is required for a medical emergency in which the 
knowledge of the specific blinded study treatment will affect the immediate management

immediately upon  occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject is to continue or 
discontinue study treatment.  
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule 
of Activities  (Table 2-1 ), is essential and required for study conduct. 
9.1 General Study Periods 
This will be a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.  The study 
consists of: 
 Screening 
 Double-blind treatment period 
 EOS visit 
Written informed consent must be obtained and will be implemented before 
protocol-specific procedures are carried out.  The risks and benefits of participating in 
the study will be verbally explained to each potential subject prior to entering the study.  
The procedures to be performed during the study are described below and are 
summarized in the Schedule of Activities (Table 2-1 ). 
9.1.1  Screening, Enrollment and/or Randomization 
Informed consent must be obtained before completing any screening procedure or 
discontinuation of standard therapy for any disallowed therapy.  After the subject has 
signed the informed consent form, the site will register the subject in the IVRS/IWRS and 
screen the subject in order to assess eligibility for participation.  The screening window is 
up to [ADDRESS_58632]:   Evolocumab 
Protocol Number:  20160184 
Date:  [ADDRESS_58633] will 
be registered as a screen fail IVRS/IWRS.  Subjects cannot undergo rescreening during 
the same admission, (ie, index date [ admission]).  Rescreening is only permitted if a 
subject is re-admitted for new occurrence of NSTE-ACS that is not related to the 
NSTE-ACS at index admission.  Screen fail subjects may be eligible for rescreening 
[ADDRESS_58634] be registered as 
rescreens in IVRS/IWRS.  Once the subject is registered as rescreened, a new 7-day 
screening window will begin.  With the exception of the screening placebo injection, 
rescreened subjects will repeat all screening procedures.  Rescreened subjects will 
maintain the originally assigned subject identification number. 
For procedures regarding LDL-C assessments during screening, these should occur 
between admission for NSTE-ACS and the coronary angiogram.  Subject eligibility 
(Section 6.1; inclusion criterion 104) based on subjects’ statin dose at the time of LDL-C 
blood sample measurement is as follows: 
No statin use 
 LDL-C:  ≥ 130 mg/dL 
Low- or Moderate-intensity statin dose (see Table 7-1 ) 
 LDL-C:  ≥ 80 mg/dL  
High-intensity statin dose (see Table 7-1 ) 
 LDL-C:   ≥ 60 mg/dL  
Day 1 of the treatment period (ie, first dose of investigational product) must happen 
within 7 days of the signing of the informed consent. 
9.1.2  Treatment Period 
Visits will occur per the Schedule of Activities ( Table 2-1 ).  On-study visits may be 
completed within [ADDRESS_58635] occur within ± 7 days of their specified date (with 
the exception of the week [ADDRESS_58636] and IVUS).  The date of the first dose of 
investigational product is defined as day 1.  All subsequent doses and study visits will be 
scheduled based on the day [ADDRESS_58637]:   Evolocumab 
Protocol Number:  20160184 
Date:  [ADDRESS_58638] 50 ± 2 weeks (ie, 48 to 52 weeks) after 
initial baseline image acquisition.  It is critical that the follow-up OCT and IVUS be 
obtained for all subjects, regardless of whether they discontinued study drug prematurely 
or are outside the 50 ± 2 weeks window.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Intracoronary Imaging (OCT and IVUS) 
In order to minimi ze the chances of performi ng unneces sary invasive procedures, 
investigators should ensure that subj ects’ initial screeni ng LDL-C resu lts are ava ilable 
prior to performing the ba seline OCT and IVUS examina tion.  Therea fter, subj ects will 
undergo c linically-indicat ed cor onary angiogr aphy fo r further c linical eval uation following 
their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54494]-ACS .  If angiogr aphic criteria are met , the subjec t will hav e 
base line OCT and I VUS complete d.  Subjects who require a PCI deemed necessary by 
[CONTACT_54543] w ill have baseli ne OCT and IVUS imaging performed 
imme diately fo llowing the  PCI.  OCT and IVUS must not be performed in vessels that 
underwent an intervention.   
The accura cy and reprod ucibility of the imaging endpoints o f the st udy are d ependent  
upon Investigator ’s commitment to rigor ous image ac quisiti on techniq ues.  The central 
imaging core l aboratory will pro vide a separate imaging guidance docum ent to all 
partici pating sites.  A dherence to these gui delines will ensure l ow inter- and 
intra-observ er variability and high image quality. 
For ea ch patient, all imaging conditi ons at base line must be duplica ted at fo llow-up 
utilizing the same imaging system.  The OCT and IVUS systems must not be changed 
betw een the base line and fo llow-up examinations .  All base line st udies (angiography, 
OCT, IVUS) must be forwar ded to t he imaging cor e laboratory for information al review .  
OCT imag es must be review ed and approv ed by [CONTACT_54544] l aboratory before 
subjects return for r andomizati on visit.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  LDL-C 
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_54545] .  The results will have to be recorded in CRF.  
Treatment period LDL-C analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_2237].  The blood 
samples will be drawn at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Activities 
(Table 2-1 ).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Time Peri od and Frequency for Collecting  and Reporting Safety 
Event Information 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.1  Adverse Events 
The adverse event grading scale to be used for this study will be the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) or the [COMPANY_010] Adverse Event Grading 
Scale  and is described in Appendix  4. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by [CONTACT_54546].  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.[ADDRESS_58642] or EOS  (whichever is later ) 
are reported using the Event CRF.  
All serious adverse events will be collected, recorded,  and reported to the sponsor or 
designee within 24  hours, as indicated in Appendix  4.  The investigator will submit any 
updated serious adverse event data to the sponsor within 24  hours of it being available.  
The criteria for grade 4 in the CTCAE grading scale differs from the  regulatory criteria for 
serious adverse events.  It is left to the investigator’s judgment to report these grade 4 
abnormalities as serious adverse events.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.3  Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol-required Reporting 
Period 
There is no requirement to moni tor study subjects for serious adverse events following 
the protocol -required reporting period or after EOS .  However, these serious adverse 
events can be reported to [COMPANY_010].  Per local requirements i n some countries, 
investigators are required to report se rious adverse events that they become aware of 
after EOS .  If serious adverse events are reported, the investigator is to report them to 
[COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  
Serious adverse events reported outside of t he protocol -required reporting period will be 
captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases and handled accordingly based 
on relationship to investigational product .

[IP_ADDRESS].2  Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious 
adverse events.  Op en-ended and non- leading verbal questioning of the subject is the 
preferred method to inquire about adverse event  occurrence.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
After the initial adverse event/serious adverse event report, the investiga tor is required to 
proactively follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts.  All adverse events and 
serious adverse events will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3).  
Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix  4. 
All new informati on for previously reported serious adverse events must be sent to 
[COMPANY_010] within [ADDRESS_58643] be consistent with that 
recorded on the Event CRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_58644] be submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_54547] a study treatment under clinical investigation are met.  
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety o f a study treatment under clinical 
investigation.  The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB s/IECs , and investigators.  
Individual  safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary.

An investigator who receives an individual safety report describing a serious adverse 
event or  other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of serious adverse 
events) from the sponsor will file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify 
the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
To comply with worldwide  reporting regulations for serious adverse events, the treatment 
assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events 
may be unblinded by [CONTACT_21960].  Aggregate 
analyses may also be unbli nded by [CONTACT_54548] (SAT) as appropriate.  
Investigators will receive notification of related serious adverse events reports sent to 
regulatory authorities in acco rdance with local requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS].5  Pregnancy and Lactation 
Details of all pregnan cies and/or lactation in female subjects and, if indicated, female 
partners of male subjects  will be collected after the start of study treatment and until 
[ADDRESS_58645] . 
If a pregnancy is reported, the investigato r is to inform [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours of learning 
of the pregnancy and/or lactation and is to follow the procedures outlined in Appendix  5.  
[COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety will follow -up with the investigator regarding additional 
information that may be requested.  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered serious adverse events.  
Further details regarding pregnancy and lactation are provided in Appendix  5.

Protocol Number:  20160184 
Date:  [ADDRESS_58647] s can be found in Appendix  4. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs 
The following measurements must be performed:  systolic/diastolic blood pressure and 
heart rate.  Subject must be in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_33197] a rested and calm state for at least 
[ADDRESS_58648] all measurements on the vital signs 
CRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Status 
Vital status must be obtained for all subjects within the limits of local law.  This includes 
subjects who may have discontinued study visits with or without withdrawing consent 
and should include interrogation of public databases, if necessary.  If deceased, the date 
and reported cause of death should be obtained. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_58649] of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the 
Schedule of Activities  (Table 2-1 ) for the timing and frequency.  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and recording any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the Event CRF.  The investigator 
must determine whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a 
clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal 
laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) 
are not to be recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that 
require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  
Where applicable, clinical sequelae (no t the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded 
as the adverse event.  
All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix  2, must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the Schedule of Activities  
(Table 2-1 ).  
Laboratory/analyte results that could unblind the study should not be performed during 
the subject’s participation in the study.   Central laboratory results of the lipid testing will 
be blinded post-treatment until unblinding of the clinical database and will not be

from obtaining lipid panels between randomization and at least [ADDRESS_58651] ends the study (to avoid potential unblinding).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy Testing 
A high sensitive (urine or serum) pregnancy test should be completed at screening and 
within [ADDRESS_58652] for females of childbearing potential.   
Note:  Females who have undergone a bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion should have 
pregnancy testing per protocol requirements.  (If a female subject, or the partn er of a 
male subject, becomes pregnant it must be reported on the Pregnancy Notification 
Worksheet, see  Figure  12-2).  Refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_58653] should be performed also at week 24 and week 50. 
Additional on -treatment pregnancy testing may be performed at the investigator’s 
discretion or as required per local laws and regulations . 
9.2.5  Biomarker Development 
Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biologic 
processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic 
intervention. 
Biomarker development can be useful in developi[INVESTIGATOR_54495], guide therapy, and/or predict disease severity. 
[COMPANY_010] may attempt to develop test(s) designed to identify subjects most likely to 
respond positively or negatively to evolocumab to investigate and further understand 
cardiovascular disease. 
Blood samples are to be collected for biomarker development at the time points 
specified in the Schedule of Activities ( Table 2-1 ).  
10. Statistical Considerations 
10.1 Sample Size Determination 
The planned total sample size is 150 subjects (75 randomized to evolocumab 
420 mg SC QM and 75 randomized to placebo SC QM ).  This sample size will provide 
sufficient power (90%) to determine whether there is a treatment effect of evolocumab 
relative to placebo in the primary endpoint.

Protocol Number:  20160184

CONFIDENTIAL   
The assumptions in the sample size calculation are based on a linear regression 
meta-analysis of 7 historical trials ( Dai et al, 2017 ; Hou et al, 2016 ; Kataoka et al, 2014 ; 
Komukai et al, 2014 ; Nishio et al, 2014 ; Hattori et al, 2012 ; Takarada et al, 2009 ) 
weighted by [CONTACT_54549]. 
The analysis result indicates that every 1  mg/dL reduction in LDL-C is estimated to be 
associated with 1.[ADDRESS_58654] in 12-month follow-up.  Assuming a 
50 mg/dL reduction in LDL -C, the p redicted mean increase (95% CI) in FCT from the 
meta -analysis was 73.92 (50.97, 96.88) µm.  For this study, the assumed treatment 
effect is at least  50.[ADDRESS_58655], which is approximated from the lower bound 
95% CI  of the expected change in FCT f rom the regression model, based on a 
conservative assumption of  50 mg/dL reduction in LDL -C from baseline to week [ADDRESS_58656] measurement at baseline or at the end of various length of follow-up was 
reported in a wide range (10.6 to 124 µm) based on [ADDRESS_58657] 
assessments, and therefore be excluded in the primary analysis, the sample size of 
150 subjects will provide approximately 125 subjects in the primary analysis to ensure 
90% power to test the study hypothesis. 
The sample size calculation was performed using a 2-sided t-test with a 
0.[ADDRESS_58658]® software 
(version 6.4). 
10.2 Analysis Sets, Subgroups, and Covariates 
10.2.1  Analysis Sets 
Full Analysis Set :  The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who 
received at least [ADDRESS_58659].

 Age (< median, ≥ median; < 65 years of age, ≥ 65 years of age) 
 Sex 
 Baseline LDL-C (< median, ≥ median) 
10.2.[ADDRESS_58660]'s early withdrawal from study, a missed visit, or 
non-evaluability of a data point or endpoint at a particular time.  The frequency and 
pattern of missing data for efficacy endpoints will be assessed through descriptive 
summaries of the measurements over time.  The reason of missing the final OCT 
measurement will be tabulated.   For subjects with missing post-baseline FCT, the 
missing primary endpoint will be imputed using multiple imputation 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
10.3 Statistical Analyses 
The statistical analysis plan will be developed and finalized before database lock.  Below 
is a summary of the timing and methods for the planned statistical analyses.   To 
preserve study integrity, the final analysis will be conducted and reported following the 
EOS, as defined in Secti on 5.3.1 . 
10.3.1  Planned Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Final Analysis 
There will be no interim analysis for this study.  The final analysis will be conducted after 
all subjects have either completed all the scheduled study visits or have early terminated 
from the study.  At that time, the database will be cleaned, processed, locked, and a 
snapshot will be taken; the study will also be unblinded.  Based on the snapshot, efficacy 
and safety analyses will be performed. 
10.3.2  Methods of Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS]  General Considerations 
Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the number of subjects, mean, 
median, SD or standard error, minimum, and maximum.  For categorical variables, the 
frequency and percentage will be given.  
Statistical inferences will be provided for analyses of primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints.  Unless specified otherwise, all statistical tests are [ADDRESS_58661]:   Evolocumab

level of 0.05; no statistical inference and imputation will be conducted for analyses of 
safety of exploratory endpoints. 
Multiplicity Adjustment Method 
In order to preserve the family wise type [ADDRESS_58662] from the primary analysis of the primary endpoint is significant at a 
significance level of 0.05, the secondary endpoints will be tested with significance level 
of 0.05 using the Hochberg method 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy Analyses 
 
Endpoint  Statistical Analysis Methods  
Primary  The primary analysis method of the primary endpoint is to use the 
analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) model, including terms for treatment 
group, stratification factor ( current statin use  [> 4 weeks or ≤ 4 weeks] 
at randomization ), and baseline FCT as covariates.  Least square 
means and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be calculated 
for each treatment group and for the difference between the treatment 
groups.  For subj ects with missing post -baseline FCT, the missing 
primary endpoint will be imputed using multiple imputation (details 
provided in SAP).  FAS will be used.  
A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted using 
nonparametric method and FAS. 
Secondary  ANCOVA model including terms for treatment group, stratification 
factor (current statin use [> 4 weeks or ≤ 4 weeks] at randomization),  
and respective baseline value as covariates.

Informed Consent Process 
An initial sample informed consent form is provided for the investigator to prepare the 
informed consent document to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the sample 
informed consent form are to be communicated formally in writing from the [COMPANY_010]  Trial 
Manager to the investigator.  The written informed consent form is to be prepared in the 
language(s) of the potential patient population.  
The investigator or his/her delegated representative will explain to the subject, or his/her 
legally authorized represen tative, the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential 
hazards of the study before any protocol -specific screening procedures or any 
investigational product(s) is/are administered, and answer all questions regarding the 
study.   
Subjects must be in formed that their participation is voluntary.  Subjects or their legally 
authorized representative defined as an individual or other body authorized under 
applicable law to consent, on behalf of a prospective subject, to the subject’s 
participation in the clinical study  will then be required to sign a statement of informed 
consent that meets the requirements of [ADDRESS_58681] (HIPAA) requirements, where 
applicable, and the IRB/IEC  or study site.  
The medical record must include a statement that written informed consent was obtained 
before the subject was enrolled in the study and the date the written consent was 
obtained.  The authorized person obtaining the informed consent m ust also sign the 
informed consent form.  
The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if the subject has a primary 
care physician and if the subject agrees to have his/her pr imary care physician informed 
of the subject’s participation in the clinical study  unless it is a local requirement.  The 
investigator shall then inform the primary care physician .  If the subject agrees to such 
notification, the investigator is to inform the subject’s primary care physician of the 
subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the  subject does not have a primary care 
physician and the investigator will be acting in that capacity, the investigator is to 
document such i n the subject’s medical record.  
The acquisition of informed consent and the subject’s agreement or refusal of his/her 
notification of the primary care physician  is to be documented in the subject’s medical 
records, and the informed consent form is to be signed and persona lly dated by [CONTACT_54556]:   Evolocumab 
Protocol Number:  20160184 
Date:  [ADDRESS_58682] withdrawal of consent or discontinuation from 
study treatment and/or procedures must also be documented in the subject ’s medical 
records; refer to Section 8. 
Subjects must be re -consented to the most current version of the informed consent 
form(s) during their participation in the study.  
The original signed informed consent form is to be retained in accordance with 
institutional policy, and a copy of the infor med consent form(s) must be provided to the 
subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative.  
If a potential subject is illiterate or visually impaired and does not have a legally 
acceptable representative, the investigator must provide an impartial witness to read the 
informed consent form to the subject and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the 
subject and the witness must sign the informed consent form to attest that informed 
consent was freely given and understood.  (Refer to ICH GCP guideline, Section 4.8.9) . 
Subjects who are rescreened are required to sign a new informed consent form. 
The informed consent form will contain a separate section that addresses the use of 
remaining mandatory samples for optional exploratory research.  The investigator or 
authorized designee will explain to each subject the objectives of the exploratory 
research.  Subjects will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may 
withdraw their specimens at any time and for any reason during the storage period.  A 
separate signature [CONTACT_22862] a subject’s agreement to allow any 
remaining specimens to be used for exploratory research.  Subjects who decline to 
participate will not provide this separate signature. 
Data Protection/Subject Confidentiality 
The investigator must ensure that the subject’s confidentiality is maintained for 
documents submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
Subject will be assigned a unique identifier by [CONTACT_456].  Any subject records or 
datasets that are transferred to the sp onsor will contain the identifier only; subject names 
or any information which would make the subject identifiable will not be transferred.

12.4 Appendix 4.  Safety Events:  Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow-up and Reporting 
Definition of Adverse Event 
Adverse Event Definition  
 An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject 
irrespective of a causal relationship with th e study treatment.   
 Note:  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or 
exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a treatment, combination 
product, medical device or procedure.  
Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
 Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) 
or other safety assessments (eg, electrocardiogram [ ECG ], radiological scans, vital 
signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, that are 
considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the 
investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease).  
 Exacer bation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may have been present before th e start of the study.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication.  Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
adverse event/serious adverse event unless it is an intentional overdose taken with 
possible suicidal/self -harming intent.  Such overdoses are to be reported 
regardless of sequelae.  
 “Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event.  Such instances will be 
captured in the efficacy assessments.  However, the signs, symptoms, and/or 
clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as adve rse event or 
serious adverse event if they fulfill the definition of an adverse event or serious 
adverse event.  
Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
 Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy):  the condition that 
leads to the  procedure is the adverse event.  
 Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
 Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the  start of the study that do not worsen.

Protocol Number:  20160184 
Date:  [ADDRESS_58686] 1 of the following serious criteria : 
Results in death (fatal)  
Immediately  life-threatening  
The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were mor e severe.  
Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12993], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1083]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting.  Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54497].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54498], the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether 
“hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the adverse event is to be considered 
serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
from baselin e is not considered an adverse event.  
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
This definition is not intended to include experien ces of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or 
prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial d isruption.  
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other me dically important serious event  
Medical or scientific judgment is to be exercised in deciding whether serious 
adverse event reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important 
medical eve nts that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or

The detection and documentation procedures  for adverse device effects  described in 
this protocol apply to all [COMPANY_010]  medical dev ices provided for use in the study (see 
Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_58689] of [COMPANY_010]  medical devices).  
Adverse Device Effect Definition  
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a combination 
product or medical device.  Adverse  device effects include adverse events resulting 
from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any 
malfunction of the device, or adverse events resulting from use error or from 
intentional misuse of the device.  
Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Adverse E vent and Serious Adverse Event Recording  
 When an adverse event, or serious adverse event occurs, it is the responsibility of 
the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], 
laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to the event.  
 The investigator will then record all relevant adverse event/serious adverse event 
information in the Event CRF.  
o Additionally, the investigator is required to report a fatal disease -related event 
on the Event CRF.  
 The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
o Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or 
symptoms);  
o Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved);

CONFIDENTIAL   
Adverse E vent and Serious Adverse Event Recording  
o Severity (or toxicity defined belo w); 
o Assessment of relatedness to evolocumab/placebo , or devices ; and 
o Action taken.  
 If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Event CRF . 
 It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical 
records to [COMPANY_010]  in lieu of completion of the Event CRF page.  
 If specifically requested, the investigator may need  to provide additional follow -up 
information, such as discharge summaries, medical records, or extracts from the 
medical records.  In this case, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the 
subject number, will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_54500] . 
 The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as th e adverse event/serious 
adverse event.  
Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will make an assessment of severity  for each adverse event and 
serious adverse event reported during the study.  The assessment of  severity  will be 
based on : 
The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) , version 4.0 
which is available at the following location:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.  
When an adverse event cannot be graded by [CONTACT_30828] 4.0, the following 
severity grade may be used:  
The [COMPANY_010] Standard Grading Scale as show below:  
Grade  Definition  
MILD  Aware of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  
MODERATE  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity  
SEVEREa Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity

Protocol Number:  20160184 
Date:  19 April 2018  Page 78 of 94  
CONFIDENTIAL   
Assessment of Causality  
 The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational 
product , protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  device (s), and/or  study -mandated procedure  
and each occurrence of each adverse event/serious adverse event.  
 Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to support a relationship 
between investigational product and the event . 
 The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
 Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment 
administration will be considered and investigated.  
 The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her a ssessment.  
 For each adverse event/serious adverse event, the investigato r must document in 
the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the adverse event/serious adverse 
event and has provided an assessment of causality.  
 There may be situations in which a se rious adverse event has occurred and the 
investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report.  However, it is 
very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for 
every event before the initial transmission of t he serious adverse event data.  
 The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send a serious adverse event follow -up report with the updated 
causality assessment.  
 The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria  used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
 
Follow -up of Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event  
 The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by 
[CONTACT_54558]/or causality of the adverse event or serious 
adverse event as fully as possible.  This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health 
care profession als. 
 If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21889] 
a serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
 If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -
up period,  the investigator will provide [COMPANY_010]  with a copy of any post -mortem 
findings including histopathology . 
 New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed Event 
CRF.  
 The investigator will submit any updated serious adverse event data to  [COMPANY_010]  
within [ADDRESS_58691]:   Evolocumab 
Protocol Number:  20160184 
Date:  19 April 2018  Page 79 of 94  
CONFIDENTIAL   
Reporting of Serious Adverse Event 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting via Electronic Data Collection Tool  
 The primary mechanism for reporting serious adverse event will be the electronic 
data capture ( EDC ) system via the Safety Report Form.  
 If the EDC system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will report 
the information to [COMPANY_010] using an E lectronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency 
Form ( paper form; see Figure  12-1) within 24 hours of the investi gator’s knowledge 
of the event . 
 The site will enter the serious adverse event data into the electronic sys tem as 
soon as it becomes available.  
 After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC system will be taken off -line to 
prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
 If a site receives a report of a new serious adverse event from a study s ubject or 
receives updated data on a previously reported serious adverse event after the 
EDC has been taken off -line, then the site can repo rt this information on an 
Electronic Serious Adverse E vent Contingency Form ( paper form; 
see Figure  12-1). 
Adverse Device Effects:  Recording, Evaluating and Reporting 
 Any adverse event resulting from an adverse device effect that occur  during the 
study will be documented in the subject’s medical records, in accordance with the 
investigator’s normal clinical practice, and on the Event CRF page.  
 It is very important that the investigator provides his/her assessment of causality 
(relations hip to the medical device provided by [CONTACT_11337] ) at the time of the initial 
report and describes any corrective or remedial actions taken to prevent recurrence 
of the incident.

Contraception Methods for Female Subjects 
Acceptable Methods of Effe ctive Contraception  
 Combined (estrogen and progestogen  containing ) or progestogen -only hormonal 
methods given via oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable, or implantable route  
 Intrauterine device (IUD)  
 Intrauterine hormonal -releasing system (IUS)  
 Bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion  
 Vasectomized partner (p rovided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the 
female subject of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has 
received medical assessment of the surgical success)  
 Sexual abstinence (d efined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during 
the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments ; the reliability of 
sexual abstinence must be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial and 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject ) 
 Male or female condom with or without spermicide  
 Cap, diaphragm,  or sponge with spermicide  
 Double barrier method:  the male uses a condom and the female may choose 
either a cap, diaphra gm, or sponge with spermicide (a  female co ndom is not an 
option due to the risk of tearing when both partners use a condom)  
Unacceptable Methods of Birth Control for Female Subjects 
Birth control methods that are considered unacceptab le in clinical trials include:  
 Periodic abstinence (calendar, sy mptothermal, post -ovulation methods)  
 Withdrawal (coitus interruptus)  
 Spermicides only  
 Lactational amenorrhea  method  
Collection of Pregnancy Information 
Female Subjects Who Become Pregnant  
 Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female subject who becomes 
pregnant while taking protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817] 15 weeks after the end of 
treatment with evolocumab . 
 Information will be recorded on the Pregnancy N otification Work sheet 
(see Figure  12-2).  The worksheet must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient 
Safety w ithin [ADDRESS_58695]’s pregnancy.  (Note:  Sites are not 
required to provide any information on the Pregnancy Notification Worksheet that 
violates the country or regions local privacy laws.)  
 After obtaining the female subject’s signed authorizati on for release of pregnancy 
and infant health information, the investigator will collect pregnancy and infant 
health information and complete the pregnancy questionnaire for any female subject 
who becomes pregnant while taking protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] t hrough [ADDRESS_58696]:   Evolocumab 
Protocol Number:  20160184 
Date:  [ADDRESS_58697] dose  of the study drug.  This information will be forwarded to [COMPANY_010] 
Global Patient Safety.  Generally, infant follow -up will be conducted up to 12  months 
after the birth of the child (if applicable).  
 Any termination of pregn ancy will be reported to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety, 
regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for 
procedure.  
 While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an adverse event or serious adverse 
event, any pregnancy compli cation or report of a congenital anomaly or 
developmental delay, fetal death, or suspected adverse reactions in the neonate will 
be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event.  Note that an elective 
termination with no information on a fetal con genital malformation or maternal 
complication is generally not considered a n adverse event , but still must be reported 
to [COMPANY_010] as a pregnancy exposure case . 
 If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a 
serious advers e event (eg, female subject experiences a spontaneous abortion, 
stillbirth, or neonatal death or there is a fetal or neonatal congenital anomaly) the 
investigator will report the event as a serious adverse event.  
 Any serious adverse event occurring as a re sult of a post -study pregnancy which is 
considered reasonably related to the study treatment by [CONTACT_093], will be 
reported to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety as described in Appendix  4.  While the 
investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study 
subjects, he or she may learn of a serious adverse event through spontaneous 
reporting.  
 Any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating will discontinue study 
treatment  (see Section 8.1 for details).  
Male Subjects With Partners Who Become Pregnant  or Were Pregnant at the Time of 
Enrollment  
 In the event a male subject fathers a child during treatment, and for an additional 
15 weeks  after discontinuing protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the information will be 
recorded on the Pregnancy Notification  Worksheet.  The worksheet  
(see Figure  12-2) must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety within 
24 hours of the site’s awareness of the pregnancy.  (Note:  Sites are not required to 
provide any information on the Pregnancy Notification Worksheet that violates the 
country or regions local privacy laws.)  
 The investigator will attempt to obtain a signed au thorization for release of 
pregnancy and infant health information directly from the pregnant female partner to 
obtain additional pregnancy information.  
 After obtaining the female partner’s signed authorization for release of pregnancy 
and infant health in formation, the investigator will collect pregnancy outcome and 
infant health information on the pregnant partner and her baby [CONTACT_54560].  This information will be forwarded to [COMPANY_010] Global

12.6 Appendix 6.  Sample Storage and Destruction 
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Activities ( Table  2-1) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure analytical methods 
produce rel iable and valid data throughout the course of the study.  This can also 
include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample 
reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results  will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for 
analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to 
the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ensure 
confidentiality.  
If informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_423], [COMPANY_010] can do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand the 
cardiovascular disease, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_54501] , the dose 
response and/or pred iction of response to evolocumab , and characterize aspects of the 
molecule (eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are 
to be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  
Samples can be retained for up to [ADDRESS_58700]’s m edical record and are not to be 
made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other 
third parties, except as specified in the informed consent.  
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroye d by 
[CONTACT_21947].  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining 
sample types (eg, blood, tumor)  and any other components from the cells c an be located 
and destroyed.  Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are 
completed.  However, information collected from samples prior to the request for 
destruction, will be retained by [CONTACT_11337].  
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the 
request of the subject through the investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as

12.7 Appendix 7.  Hepatotoxicity Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:  Suggested Actions and 
Follow-up Assessments 
Subjects with abnormal hepatic laboratory values (ie,  alkaline phosphatase [ALP], 
aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], total bilirubin [TBL]) 
and/or international normalized ratio (INR) and/or signs/symptoms of hepatitis (as 
described below) may meet the criteria for withholding or permanent discontinuation of 
[COMPANY_010] investigational product or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], as specified in the 
Guidance for Industry Drug -Induced Liver Injury:  Premarketing Clinical Evaluation, 
July 2009.  
Criteria for Withholding and/or Permanent Discontinuation of [COMPANY_010] 
Investigational Product and Other Protocol -required Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_54502]/or withholding rules apply to subjects for whom another 
cause of their changes in liver biomarkers (TBL, INR , and transaminases) has not been 
identified.  
Important alternative causes for elevated AST/ALT and/or TBL values include, but are 
not limited to:  
 Hepatobiliary tract disease  
 Viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein -Barr Virus, cytomegalovirus, 
herpes simplex virus, varicella, toxoplasmosis, and parvovirus)  
 Right sided heart failure, hypotension,  or any cause of hypoxia to the liver 
causing ischemia  
 Exposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or hepatotoxins, including herbal and 
dietary supplements, plants, and mushrooms  
 Heritable disorders causing impaired glucuronidation (eg, Gilbert’s syndrome, 
Crigler -Najjar syndrome) and drugs that inhibit bilirubin  (BIL)  glucuronidation 
(eg, indinavir, atazanavir)  
 Alpha -one antitrypsin deficiency  
 Alcoholic hepatitis  
 Autoimmune hepatitis  
 Wilson’s disease and hemochromatosis  
 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease including steatohepatitis (NASH)  
 Non-hepatic causes (eg, rhabdomyolysis , hemolysis) 
If investigational product(s) is/are withheld, the subject is to be followed for possible 
drug-induced liver injury ( DILI) according to recommendations in the last section of this 
appendix.

Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for impaire d liver tests (ALT, 
AST, ALP) and/or elevated TBL, is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve 
to normal or baseline (see next section in this appendix).

and TBL and/or INR elevation, according to the criteria specified in the above, require 
the following:  
 The event is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] as a serious adverse event within 24  hours 
of discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic 
investigations have been concluded)  
 The appropriate CRF (eg, Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evalua tion of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities is to  be 
completed and sent to [COMPANY_010]   
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Appendix [ADDRESS_58714](s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217]/are 
withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in 
Table  12-[ADDRESS_58715] or ALT elevations >  3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) 
or 2-fold increases above baseline values for subjects with elevated values before drug 
are to undergo a period of “close observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to 
the subject’s baseline levels.   
Assessments that are to be performed during this p eriod include:  
 Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, BIL (total and direct), and INR within 24 hours  
 In cases of TBL > [ADDRESS_58716] or INR > 1.5, retesting of liver tests, BIL (total and 
direct), and INR is to be performed every [ADDRESS_58717](s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33218]/have been 
discontinued AND the subject is asymptomatic.  
Initiate investigation of alternative  causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or elevated TBL.  
The following are to be considered depending on the clinical situation:  
 Complete blood count (CBC) with differential to assess for eosinophilia  
 Serum total immunoglobulin  G, anti -nuclear antibody (ANA),  anti-smooth muscle 
antibody, and liver kidney microsomal antibody -1 (LKM1) to assess for 
autoimmune hepatitis  
 Serum acetaminophen (paracetamol) levels

The Effects of Mixed Working Memory Training  on Subsequent Training Gains among Older Adults [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] May 26, 2023 (Rev. February 2, 2024)  Study Protocol   Objectives. While an intellectually active and socially integrated lifestyle shows promise for promoting cognitive resilience with aging, the mechanisms underlying any such effects are not well understood (Stine-Morrow et al., 2014, 2021; Stine-Morrow & Manavbasi, 2022). The aim of the current project was to test the implications of the “Mutualism” hypothesis (Savi et al., 2019; van der Maas et al., 2006; van der Maas et al., 2017), which suggests that intellectual function emerges out of the reciprocal influence of growth in abilities as they are exercised in the ecology of everyday life. Such a view stands in contrast to the Principle of Direct Transfer (Thorndike, 1906) in suggesting that improvement in one component will enhance the modifiability of a related component. In other words, while conventional conceptualizations of transfer imply immediate generalization, mutualism assumes that practice in the novel skill is required for benefits to be manifest. An additional aim was to test the idea that mutualistic effects will be enhanced by [CONTACT_480068], relative to single-component training (Brown et al., 2014; Schmidt & Bjork, 1992).  To this end, participants engaged in two phases of training. The target task in Phase 2 was the complex reading span, which has been found to be predictive of standardized tests of verbal ability and measures of language comprehension (Baddeley, 2012; Daneman & Carpenter, 1980; Daneman & Merikle, 1996; Payne & Stine-Morrow, 2017; Peng et al., 2022; Stine & Wingfield, 1987). As a WM task, the reading span requires the concurrent management of sentence processing and a memory load. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups that varied in the type of training in Phase 1. In the Different Mixed (DM) condition, participants practiced lexical decision span and category span tasks, two different tasks similar to the reading span in requiring the individual to manage a memory load while processing verbal material but with different sorts of processing components. In the Different Single (DS) condition, participants practiced only the lexical decision span, which provided less diverse experience with tasks that depend on WM. These were contrasted with two controls, a Same Task (ST) condition in which participants practiced the reading span, exactly the same as the target task, and a Placebo Control (PC) condition, in which participants made speeded judgments to the same verbal stimuli as in the lexical decision task but with no memory component, and hence, no demand to simultaneously manage processing and memory (i.e., WM). We measured both how quickly the target task in Phase [ADDRESS_616779] group — who exclusively practiced the reading span (RS) task in both phases of training would be expected to show the greatest 
pre- to posttest improvement in RS, but the least improvement in all other span tasks. The DS group (who practiced the lexical decision span (LDS) in Phase 1 and RS in Phase 2) and the DM group (who practiced the category span (CatS) and LDS) in Phase 1 and RS in Phase 2), however, would be expected to show some improvement in the trained tasks according to their collective exposure across the two phases (i.e., DS=DM on RS; DS>DM on LDS; DM>DS on CatS), and less improvement in the untrained tasks, and even less in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_161134] (which would represent far transfer). According to the principle of Mutualism, performance is most likely to be enhanced when elements of the task are acquired and then the target task containing those elements is practiced. This situation is embodied in the DM condition in which the individual acquires multiple elements of the WM task that are then practiced in the context of a new task. Thus, the Principle of Mutualism predicts the largest gains from pre- to posttest for the DM group, and to a lesser extent for the DS group, who had less diverse exposure to elements of the WM task relative to the DM group. Because there was no opportunity to practice the untrained WM tasks or epi[INVESTIGATOR_161134], the Principle of Mutualism does not predict improvement in these areas.  Collectively then, Principles of Direct Transfer and of Mutualism make quite different predictions for performance in the successive enrichment paradigm and in pre- to posttest change. Most importantly, the former predicts the reading span in Phase [ADDRESS_616780] gains by [CONTACT_480069] (to a lesser extent) the DS group.  Design. The experimental design involved two phases of working memory training, with 10 days of activities in each phase. Each day, participants engaged in 4 8-min blocks of training activities (so a total of 32 minutes per day). Participants were encouraged to complete the 10 days of activities across a 2-week period. During Phase 2 all participants engaged in the same training with a reading span task. The training in Phase 1 was manipulated so that participants in the Placebo Control (PC) group practiced a speeded lexical decision task with no decision component, the Same Task (ST) group practiced with the same reading span task as in Phase 2, the Different Single (DS) group practiced a lexical decision span task, and the Different Mixed (DM) group practiced both the lexical decision span task and a category span task. Thus, the critical tests are whether the four groups differ in (a) pre- to posttest gains on the span tasks, and in (b) training gains in the reading span task in Phase 2 training.  Methods. All tasks in both phases were adaptive, starting at level one (one decision with one item to be remembered, or in the PC condition, simply one decision), and then increased or decreased depending on decision and memory accuracy combined. Set size was increased by [CONTACT_480070] 90%, decreased by [CONTACT_480071] 70%, and otherwise, stayed the same.  In the reading span, participants read a series of either semantically congruent sentences or syntactic prose sentences (e.g., As the ship gets better, your child needs to develop this oven) for which they make sentence acceptability judgments on each sentence. Participants make an acceptability judgment by [CONTACT_7326] a Yes button or No button at the bottom of the screen. Once participants make a decision, the sentence disappears, and participants are presented with accuracy feedback. At the end of the set, participants are cued to recall the last word of each sentence in the order in which they were presented. The cued recall screen consisted of a set of empty text boxes that participants can press and then type their responses via an on-screen keyboard, with no time limit. Acceptable sentences are adapted from two sources. The Nelson and Narens (1980) general information question norms provided 244 sentences. The other source was the Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) of the Open American National Corpus (Ide et al., 2013), which provided 301 sentences that ranged widely in topic, length, and syntactic structure. In addition, 346 unacceptable sentences were adapted from the syntactic prose conditions in earlier studies by [CONTACT_480072] (2011) and Payne et al. (2015). Unacceptable sentences have syntactically well- formed sentence frames, but contain no coherent message-level semantics. All sentences ranged between 60 and 90 characters, and all sentence final words were between 4 and 9 characters.  In the lexical decision span task, participants are presented with a set of letter strings constituting words (e.g., seek) or non-words (e.g., ceek) and are cued to decide whether or not each string formed a word or not. The letter strings are presented for [ADDRESS_616781] database (Balota et al., 2007). Word/non- word strings ranged in length between 4 and 9 characters (for word stimuli: log word frequency range: 5 to 13.67).  In the category span, participants are presented with a semantic category at the top of the screen (e.g., weather) along with a set of single words for which they made validity judgments (e.g., humidity - Yes; chocolate - No). Each trial consisted of the category and target word presented for [ADDRESS_616782] disappears and s/he presented with accuracy feedback. The program would then progress to the next trial within the set. At the end of each set, participants are cued to recall each of the words in the order in which they were presented. The cued recall screen consists of a set of empty text boxes that participants can press and then type their responses via an on-screen keyboard. Participants have no time limit to enter their recall responses at the prompt. Categories and exemplars were drawn from the Van Overschelde et al. (2004) category norms. The final stimulus set contains a total of [ADDRESS_616783] once before a particular category could be repeated again. In the placebo control, participants engaged with a speeded lexical decision task. This was an active control matched to the other conditions in materials and engagement (speed increased and decreased adaptively to performance) but without the memory component.  Electronic tablets were delivered to the participants’ homes along with detailed instructions and a log book, using contact-free delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants kept an iPad for each phase of training for about two weeks and could complete their 10 sessions of training on any days during the two weeks.  The pre- (administered Prior to Phase 1) and posttest (administered after Phase 2) batteries were programmed in Qualtrics and administered online. The testing session began with the experimenter on the phone to consent the participant and provide guidance in initiating the protocol. The experimenter was available by [CONTACT_480073]. The testing session generally required 1.5-[ADDRESS_616784] interval was held constant (M = 34.5 days, SD = 7.0). There were no differences among the groups, F<1.  Outcome measures included rate of learning during Phase [ADDRESS_616785].   Statistical Analysis Plan  The primary outcomes were (a) standard unit change in cognitive measures from pre- to posttest (i.e.,	posttest	score	-	pretest	score)	/	standard	deviation	at	pretest) for reading span and a composite of work  and (b) daily mean reading span score achieved across the 10 days of training in Phase 2. For the latter variable, calculations were based on scores from Trial 2 to the end of the training block (we discarded Trial 1 because this trial only included one element to remember and thus, elicited uniform performance across participants). Pre- to posttest change was analyzed using one-way ANOVA to test differences among the four groups with post hoc Bonferroni comparisons to correct for the number of 
comparisons. Acquisition of the reading span in Phase 2 (change across the 10 days of practice) was analyzed with mixed-effects linear regression using the lme4 and lmerTest packages for R version 4.2.2 (R Core Team, 2022). The PC Group was set as reference in comparisons with other groups in an analysis with Training Day and Phase [ADDRESS_616786] random intercept, using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method of estimation. The design was powered at .[ADDRESS_616787] size of .14 for group differences in change across 10 days (Faul et al., 2007), though of course, there estimates of power for linear mixed-effects models are controversial. There was no correction for the number of tests in this latter analysis.   Informed Consent Form (approved April 12, 2022)  Welcome to The Adult Learning Lab!  This letter describes the research project in which you have been asked to participate. It is being conducted by [CONTACT_480074]-Morrow (Educational Psychology), Aron Barbey (Psychology), Brad Sutton (Electrical Engineering), and Dan Morrow, all faculty at the Beckman Institute. The purpose of this project is to better understand how to maintain cognitive resilience through participation in mentally stimulating activities. Specifically, we are testing the benefits of engaging attention and memory by [CONTACT_480075].  For this study, we will be mailing an iPad to your home, along with instructions about how to use it to play the games. At any point if you require further information, you can email the lab member you have been in contact [CONTACT_480076] [EMAIL_9242], and we can arrange a phone call or video meeting with you. You will be randomly assigned to engage in a particular schedule of mental games. We ask that you do your best to play these games in a focused way for about [ADDRESS_616788] point of your training (after two weeks), you will mail the iPad to us in a prepaid addressed envelope that we will send you with the iPad. We will update your training program and send it back to you, along with a new set of training instructions, so that you can complete the next two weeks of training. Again, we will include a prepaid addressed envelope in which you can return the iPad.   Prior to starting the training, you will be asked to provide some information about your background and to participate in a variety of tasks that deal with memory, attention, language understanding, and problem solving. For example, you will be asked to recall short lists of words, to describe the meanings of words, and make quick decisions about whether two patterns are the same or different. You will be able to participate in these activities on your home computer by [CONTACT_116828] a link that we send you. After you are finished with the iPad activities, you will do a similar set of activities on your home computer. Each time, these activities will take about [ADDRESS_616789] pool, you will receive one credit per hour of participation in the 
tasks before and after training. If you start a session but do not complete it, you will receive partial payment (1 credit per hour) for the time you participated for.  If you are a paid subject, you will receive an electronic gift card to make purchases on Amazon. You will receive $20 for each testing session before and after the iPad training. If you start a session but do not complete it, you will still receive partial payment for that session ($5 per half-hour). There will be no payments for the time you spend playing the mental games on the tablet. However, if you complete all the iPad training (a total of 20 days of training), you will receive an additional $[ADDRESS_616790] code, after completion of all the sessions (pre-test, [ADDRESS_616791] session). If you choose to withdraw sooner, you will be sent the code at the time you let us know of your withdrawal. Please allow for a week after completing post-test and mailing us the iPad, for the e-code to be emailed to you. We believe that this research will be beneficial in clarifying the nature of adult learning and the conditions that help us to maintain our cognitive vitality as we grow older, and we deeply appreciate your participation!  The results of your participation are kept strictly confidential. Neither your name [CONTACT_480078].

CSP Version 2.0 (18-August -2023)
This m odificat ion is considered to be non- substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 
10(a) of Direct ive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council o f the European 
Unio n and in the EU Clinical Trial Regulat ion Article 2, 2 (13) as it neither significant ly impacts 
the safet y or phy sical/mental  integrity of patients nor the scient ific value of the study. 
Overall Rationale for the Modification
This CSP was amended to clarify init ial intent to allow continuation of the treatment with 
durvalumab for patients who may  benefi t from it, based on Invest igator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n, after the 
individual pat ient reached end of scheduled visits, but before the study  reached last pati ent last 
visit/final data cut off date and to update language related to sample size, data analysis, and 
follow-up of  patients after discont inuat ion of study treatment for clarificat ion.Text was also 
updated to comply with regulatory  requi rements.
The updates are summarized below. Other minor editorial updates were m ade throughout. 
Administrative changes, such as formatting, updates to abbreviations, and punctuation

1.1 Schedule of activities
The procedures for the sc reening and treatment periods in this study  are presented in Table 1, 
and the procedures for the fo llow-up peri od are presented in Table 2.
Whenever vital signs and blood draws are scheduled for the same no minal time, the assessments 
shoul d occur in the following order: vital signs and then blood draws. The timing of the vital 
signs assessments shoul d be such that i t allows the bl ood draw to occur at the timepoints 
indicated in the schedule of activit ies (SoA; Table 1and Table 2). Whenever electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), vi tal signs, and bl ood draws are scheduled for the same nom inal t ime, the assessments 
shoul d occur in the following order: ECG, vital signs, and then blood draws. The timing of the 
first 2 assessments should be such that it allows the blood draw to occur at the timepo ints 
indicated in the SoAs ( Table 1and
 Table 2).
Patients m ay delay  dosing under certain c ircumstances.
Dosing may be delayed per the Dosing Modificat ion and Toxicit y Management 
Guidelines (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
, due to either immune -mediated adverse events 
(imAE s) or non -imAEs .
If dosing must be delayed for reasons other than treatment -related toxi city, dosing will 
resum e as soon as feasible.
Dosing intervals of subsequent cy cles may  be shortened as clinically  feasible in order to 
gradually  align treatm ent cy cles wi th the schedule of tum or efficacy  (Response 
Evaluat ion Cri teria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]) and patient -reported outcomes (PRO) 
assessments . Subsequent time between 2 consecutive doses cannot be less than 22 days, 
based on the half -life o f durvalumab (see the current Investigator’s Brochure [IB] for 
durvalumab).
One cycle of treatment with durvalumab is equal to [ADDRESS_1191293] dose.
PRO and tu mor efficacy (RECIST) assessment dates are not affected by  [CONTACT_855185], as they  are based on the date of the first dose (not the date of therapy ).
All other scheduled assessments must be performed relat ive to the start of the dosing cycle such 
that all laboratory  procedures, etc, required for dosing should be performed within 3 calendar 
days pri or to dosing.

Protocol title:
A Phase II, Open -label, Mult icenter, International Study  of Durvalumab Following Radiat ion 
Therapy  in Pat ients with Stage III, Unresectable Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Are 
Ineligible for Chemotherapy (DUART)
Rationale:
Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a human mo noclonal ant ibody  (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G 
(IgG) 1 kappa subclass that blocks the interaction of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) 
(but not programmed cell death ligand -2) wi th programmed cell death rece ptor (PD -1) on T cells 
and cluster of different iation (CD)80 (B7.1) on immune cells. It is being developed by 
[CONTACT_38227]/MedImmune for use in the treatment of cancer. Results of early studies with 
durvalumab in advanced cancers are consistent with a class effect of early and sustained tumor 
control  that has been observed previously  with other inhibitors of the immune -checkpo int 
pathway . As radi ation therapy  is known to upregulate PD -L1, using durvalumab subsequent to 
radiation therapy  coul d potenti ally provide better clinical outcomes in this population. Result s 
from the PACIFIC Study  in pat ients with Stage III unresectable non -small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) following concurrent chemoradiat ion therapy  (cCRT) dem onstrated a si gnificant 
increase in median pro gression -free survival (PFS) and a significant increase in overall survival 
(OS) am ong pati ents who received durvalumab compared with placebo. Safet y resul ts from this 
study  dem onstrated that durvalumab monotherapy  was well tol erated and had a manageable 
safety profile in this pat ient populat ion. However, many pat ients with Stage III unresectable 
NSCLC are unable to undergo chemotherapy; these patients are therefore faced wit h fewer 
treatm ent opti ons. The main goal of this study  is to evaluate the safety  and tolerabilit y of 
maintenance treatment with durvalumab fo llowing radiat ion therapy  in this popul ation.

durvalumab administration. The last dose of radiat ion therapy is defined as the day of the last 
radiation treatment sessio n.
Approximately  148 pati ents are screened to achieve 102 patients treated withdurvalumab and 
60evaluable patients.
Note : "Screened" means a patient’s or their legally acceptable representative’s, agreement to 
participate in a clinical study  following com pletion of the informed consent process. Potential 
patients who are screened f or the purpose of determining eligibilit y for the study , but are not 
rando mized/assigned in the study, are considered “screen failures”, unless otherwise specified by 
[CONTACT_760]. 
Treatments and treatment duration
All patients will receive 1500 mg durval umab via intravenous (IV) infusio n every  4 weeks (q4w) 
for 12months (13 doses/cy cles). The l ast administrati on of  durvalumab will be on week 48 
unless there is clinical progressio n, confirmed radiological progression, unacceptable toxicit y, 
withdrawal  of consent, or another discont inuat ion criterion is met. (Pl ease note: If a pati ent’s 
weight falls to 30 kg or below, the patient should receive weight -based dosing equivalent to 
20mg/kg of durvalumab q4w after consultation between Invest igator and Study  Physician, unt il 
the wei ght improves to > 30 kg, at which point the patient should resume the fixed -dosing o f 
durvalumab 1500 mg q4w).
Progression during treatment
During the treatment period, patients who are clinically stable at an init ial RECIST 1.1-defined 
progressive disease (PD) may  cont inue to receive study treatment at the discret ion of the 
Invest igator and patient. A fo llow-up scan is to be collected after the init ial RECIST 1.1 -defined 
PD, preferably at the next (and no later than the next) scheduled imaging visit, and no less than 
4weeks after the prior assessment of PD; this fo llow-up scan is evaluated using the 
Confirmation o f Radiological Progressi on cri teria. Pati ents wi th confirmed PD who continue to 
receive durvalumab at the discreti on of  the Invest igator and patient (fo llowing consultation wit h 
[COMPANY_008]) can receive treatment for the remainder of the 12- month treatment period, and 
tumor assessments should cont inue on their regular imaging schedule for the duration of 
treatm ent.
Follow-up of patients after discontinuation of study drug
Patients who have discont inued study  treatm ent due to toxicit y or symptom atic deterioration, 
clinical progression, or who have co mmenced subsequent ant icancer therapy , will be foll owed up 
for adverse events (AEs) and wit h PRO -questionnaires for [ADDRESS_1191299]

Steering Committee
If required, a Steering Committee (SC) will be assembled by  [CONTACT_855187] n of the study . The SC will consist of oncology  experts and a statist ician 
who serve their role through reg ular scheduled meetings or teleconferences and, if necessary, 
additional ad hoc m eetings. Details of the SC remit , procedures, processes, and meet ing 
frequency  will be outlined in an SC Charter.
Interim analysis
No formal interim analyses are pl anned for t his study.
Statistical methods
The primary  object ive of this study  is to assess the safet y and tolerabilit y of durvalumab which is 
defined as Grade 3 and Grade 4 possibly related adverse events (PRAEs), as assessed by [CONTACT_24338], observed wit hin [ADDRESS_1191300] Radiotherapy  (60 Gy  ± 10% or hypofractionated BED) and patients who 
received palli ative radiotherapy (40 to < 54 Gy or hypo fractionated BED).
Safety data will be summarized descript ively overall, by [CONTACT_12917], by [CONTACT_20084] y and by  
[CONTACT_855188] (NCI) Commo n Termino logy Criteria f or Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Grade. The exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the incidence of Grade 3 and 
Grade 4 PRAEs will be reported for patients overall and separately  for each cohort.
The m edian PFS, m edian OS, and median time to NSCLC -related death, together with their 
correspondin g 95% CIs, will be calculated using Kaplan -Meier product limit methods. The 
proporti on of  patients who are progression -free at [ADDRESS_1191301] ive response rate (ORR), 
based on Invest igator assessments, together with the corresponding 95% CIs will be reported.
A total o f approximately  102 pati ents are treated wit h the study  drug in 2 cohorts: approximately  
59patients in the Standard Radiotherapy  Cohort and a pproximately 43 patients in the Palliat ive 
Radiotherapy  Cohort. It is estimated that a sample size of a minimum 60 patients would be 
requi red to provi de an adequate level o f confidence in the estimated incidence of Grade 3 and 4

incidence rate of 12% would be 5% to 23%. If the underlying/true incidence rate was 12% as 
reported in PACIFIC, on repeated implementations of thi s study , observing an incidence rate less 
than 5% or greater than 18.3% would be approximately 5% for each region/tail. Furthermore, if 
there are 30 patients in each cohort (Standard Radiotherapy and Palliat ive Radiotherapy) and the 
true incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 PRAEs occurring wit hin 6 months after init iation of

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 26 (149 )(GLOBOCAN 2012). NSCLC represents approximately 80% to 85% of all lung cancers and 
30% of patients present with Stage III disease. Standard treatment for patients with a good 
perform ance status (PS) and unresectable Stage III NSC LC had been plat inum -based doublet 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy  administered concurrently wit h cCRT. A meta -analysis of 
concurrent versus sequent ial CRT demonstrated better outcomes with concurrent therapy , but 
even wit h cCRT, 5- year OS ranges between 15% and32% ( Antonia et al  2017 , 
Aupérin et al 2010).
More recent ly, the PACIFIC Study (D4191C00001) demonstrated that the addit ion of 
durvalumab as sequent ial therapy  to pl atinum -based CRT si gnificant ly improves PFS (median 
PFS 17.[ADDRESS_1191304] ratio [HR] of 
0.51) and OS (HR of 0.68) ( Antonia et a l 2018 ). Given the potential for further cl inical benefit, 
the Sponsor is current ly evaluat ing the efficacy and safet y of durvalumab given concurrent ly 
with platinum -based CRT in patients with locally- advanced, unresectable NSCLC (Stage III) in 
PACIFIC2 (D933KC00001).
However, a significant proport ion of patients with Stage III unresectable NSCLC are ineligible 
for chemotherapy  for a number of reasons, including comorbidit ies, poor PS, or elderly age; 
these patients are therefore faced with fewer treatment options. A commo n regimen for these 
patients is radi otherapy  alone; however, it is associated with disappo inting results in terms of OS 
(Driessen et al  2016 ; Miller et al  2018 ). Using durvalumab subsequent to radiation therapy could 
potenti ally provide better clinical outcomes in this populat ion.
2.[ADDRESS_1191305] . A consistent observation across these studies is the long durabilit y 
of benefits wit h immune -checkpo int inhibitors. However, not all pat ients benefit from immune -
checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy . Hence, studies that fo llow established treatments (such as 
radiation therapy ) with immune -checkpoint inhibitors are needed in order to expand the patient 
popul ation who might benefit fro m immune -checkpoint inhibitors.
Radiation has been shown to induce immunogenic cell death. Cell death enhances the abilit y of 
the immune system to reco gnize and respond to the tumor through enhanced ant igen release and 
presentation (tumor specific T -cell activation; Forment i and Dem aria 2013 , Weichselbaum 
et al 2017). In addit ion, ionizing radi ation causes upregulat ion of various proinflammatory

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 27 (149 )signals and cy tokines, which pl ay a key  role in immune regulatory  pathway , leading to improved 
antitumor immuni ty. Twyman -Saint Vi ctor et al  also showed that radiation enhanced the 
diversit y of the T -cell receptor repertoire of intratumora l T cells ( Twyman -Saint Victor et al 
2015). Addi tionally, radi otherapy  has been shown to upregulate the expressio n of PD -L1 (Butts 
et al 2014 , Deng et al 2014, Zhang et al 2008b ), and therefore may confer greater sensit ivity to 
PD-L1-directed therapy .
2.2 Background
A detailed description o f the chemistry , pharmaco logy, efficacy , and safet y of durvalumab i s 
provi ded in the IB.
2.2.1 Immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_584154] , and under some 
circumstances, the immune system may  control  or even eliminate tumors ( Dunn etal2004).
PD-L1 is part of a complex system of receptors and ligands that are invo lved in controlling 
T-cell act ivation. The PD -1 receptor (CD279) is expressed on the surface of act ivated T cells
(Jansse n et al  2008a , Janssen et al 2008b , Keir et al 2008)
. It has 2 known ligands: PD -L1 
(B7-H1; CD274) and PD -L2 (B7- DC; CD273) ( Okazaki and Honjo 2007
). PD -1 and 
PD-L1/PD -L2 belo ng to a family o f immune -checkpoint proteins that act as co- inhibitory 
factors, which can halt or limit the development of T -cell response. When PD -L1 binds to PD -1, 
an inhibitory  signal  is transmi tted into the T cell, which reduces cytokine production and 
suppresses T -cell pro liferat ion. Tumor cells explo it this immune checkpo int pathway  as a 
mechanism to evade detection and inhibit immune response.
PD-L1 is const itutively expressed by B -cells, dendri tic cells, and macrophages ( Qin et al 2016
). 
Importantly, PD -L1 is co mmo nly over -expressed on tumor cells or on non -transformed cells in 
the tumor microenvironment 
(Pazdur 2008, Pardoll 2012 ). PD -L1 expressed on the tumor cells 
binds to PD -[ADDRESS_1191306] ivated T cells remain inhibited in the tumor m icroenvironment. The PD -1/PD -L1 
pathway  represents an adapt ive immune resistance mechanism that is exerted by [CONTACT_855189] y.
The inhibitory  mechanism  described above is co -opted by  [CONTACT_178530] -L1 as a w ay of 
evading immune detection and eliminat ion. The binding of an ant i-PD-L1 agent to the PD -L1 
receptor inhibits the interaction of PD -L1 wi th the PD -[ADDRESS_1191307] agoni sm of  a stimulatory  receptor such as CD28.

2.2.2 Durvalumab
Durvalumab is a human mAb o f the IgG1 kappa subclass that blocks the interaction of PD -L1 
(but not programmed cell death ligand -2) wi th PD-1 on T cells and CD80 (B7.1) on immune 
cells. It i s being developed by  [CONTACT_38227]/MedImmune for use in the treatment of cancer. 
(MedImmune is a who lly owned subsidiary o f [COMPANY_008]; [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune will be 
referred to as [COMPANY_008] throughout this document.) The proposed mechanism of act ion 
(MOA) for durvalumab is interference in the interaction of PD -L1 wi th PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). 
Blockade of PD- L1/PD -1 and PD- L1/CD80 interactions releases the inhibit ion of immune 
responses, including those that may result in tumor eliminat ion. In vitro studies demo nstrate that 
durvalumab antagonizes the inhibitory  effect of PD -L1 on primary  human T cells result ing in the 
restored proliferation o f interferon gamma (IFN -γ) (Sprangers and Aaronson 1992 , Stewart et al 
2015). In vivo studies have shown that durvalumab inhibits tumor growth in xenograft models 
via a T -cell-dependent m echanism  (Sprangers and Aaronson 1992 , Stewart et al 2015 ). Based on 
these data, durvalumab is expected to stimulate the patient’s ant itumor immune response by  
[CONTACT_28738] -L1 and shift ing the balance toward an ant itumor response. Durvalumab has bee n 
engineered to reduce antibody -dependent cellular cy totoxi city and com plement -dependent 
cytotoxi city.

2.3 Benefit/risk assessment
Themajo rity of the safet y and efficacy data currently  available for durval umab are based on the 
first-in-human, single -agent study  (Study CD-ON-MEDI4736- 1108; hereafter referred to as 
Study  1108) in pat ients with advanced so lid tumors, the study of durvaluma b monotherapy  in 
NSCLC (ATLANTIC Study  [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]), the study  of durvalumab mo notherapy  in NSCLC 
following co mpletion of platinum -based chemotherapy  concurrent wi th radiation therapy  
(PACIFIC Study  [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]), and the study  of durvalumab with or wit hout tremelimumab 
as first line treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC (MYSTIC Study  
[[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]). Data from these studies have demo nstrated clinical activit y of durvalumab 
therapy  in pat ients with NSCLC. Details pertaining these studie

definit ive radiat ion within 42 days pri or to init iation of the study  drug and had a World Healt h 
Organizat ion (WHO) PS0 or 1 ( Antonia et al 2017 , Ant onia et a l 2018 ). A total  of 713 patients 
were randomized 2:1 to receive durvalumab 10 mg/kg or pl acebo intravenously  every [ADDRESS_1191312] 1.1 -defined progression. 
The prespecified interim PFS analysis based on 81% of total planned events demonstrated a 
statist ically significant improvement in PFS of 16.8 months (95% CI: 13.0, 18.1) with 
durvalumab versus 5.6 months (95% CI: 4.6, 7.8 ) with placebo (stratified HR: 0.52; 
95% CI: 0.42, 0.65; p < 0.001). The PFS benefit in favor of durvalumab was observed 
irrespect ive of PD -L1 expressio n before CRT (PD -L1 expressio n < 25%, HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 
0.43, 0.82; PD -L1 expressio n ≥ 25%, HR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.65). The response rate was 
higher with durvalumab than with placebo (28.4% versus 16.0%; p < 0.001), and the median 
durati on of  response (DoR) was longer (72.8% versus 46.8% of the patients had an ongoing 
response at 18 months).
As of the tim e of the PACIFIC OS analysis, the median t ime to death or distant metastasis was 
28.3 m onths in the durvalumab group and 16.2 months in the placebo group (stratified HR, 0.53;

70.4) in the durvalumab group, as compared with 55.6% (95% CI, 48.9 to 61.8) in the placebo 
group (two- sided P 0.005). As of 31 January 2019 (third data cutoff [DCO]), 3 -year data 
demonstrated a durvalumab survival benefit over placebo that was consistent with the OS 
primary  analysis, wit h a 31% reduction in the risk of death (HR: 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.86). The 
Kaplan -Meier estimate of the m edian OS was 29.1 months in the placebo group, while it was not 
yet reached in the durvalumab group. The 12-, 24- , and 36 -month OS rates with durvalumab and 
placebo were 83.1% versus 74.6%, 66.3% versus 55.3%, and 57.0% versus 43.5%, respectively 
(Gray  et al  2019 ).
2.3.[ADDRESS_1191313] adverse drug reactions seen wit h the immune -checkpo int inhibitor class o f agents are

2.3.3 Overall benefit/risk
The clinical act ivity associated wi th potentiating the proinflammatory  effects of radiation therapy  
suggests that giving durvalumab fo llowing radiat ion therapy  may have clinical benefits, 
including incre asing the response rate to radiat ion therapy .
The safet y of durvalumab fo llowing radiation therapy  is further supported by  [CONTACT_855190] , which showed that durvalumab administered within 42 days of completion of 
CRT had a well tolerated an d manageable safet y profile that was consistent with the established 
safet y profile to date. It is therefore reasonable to assume that immunotherapy  administered 
within 42 days of complet ion of radiat ion therapy  will also be well tolerated.
Therefore, the overall benefit -risk assessment supports the proposed study  to eval uate the 
efficacy  and safety  of administrati on of  durvalumab fo llowing radiation therapy .

expand the safet y database fro m the ongoing Phase III PACIFIC Study  and PACIFIC -5 Study  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and the ongoing Phase II PACIFIC -6 Stu dy ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Given the 
potenti al for radi otherapy  to increase the likelihood of ant i-PD-L1–mediated pneumo nitis, a need 
for addi tional safety  data on the use of durvalumab under this context exists, including in the 
sub-popul ation of WHO/ECOG PS [ADDRESS_1191317]

as defined by  [CONTACT_27891] 3 and Grade 4 PRAEs, including the evaluation of the nature of toxicit ies 
(SAEs, AEs, Adverse Events of Special Interest [AESIs], imAEs), intervent ions and treatm ent, 
and outcom e of treatm ent.
4.2.2 Rationale for efficacy endpoints
The secondary  aim of this s tudy is to determine the efficacy o f durvalumab 1500 mg q4w in 
terms of ORR, PFS, and OS. PFS has been found to be correlated with OS in previous CRT 
studi es (Mauguen et al 2013)
. Although the OS benefit has exceeded the PFS benefit in other 
studi es of  immune -checkpoint inhibitors in advanced -stage NSCLC ( Borghaei et al 2015 ), there 
are certain settings in which the utilit y of survival as an endpo int may potenti ally be confounded 
by [CONTACT_70124][INVESTIGATOR_014]. Specifically, there are current ly a number of mo lecules targeting the 
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 35 (149 )PD-1/PD -L1 pathway in late -stage development for the treatment of first -, second -, and/or 
third-line metastatic NSCLC. It is ant icipated that these agents may  be approved or becom e 
available for use through expanded -access programs or addit ional clinical studies while this 
study  is ongoi ng. This poses challenges in being able to fully characterize effects on OS if 
patients subsequent ly receive these immunotherapeutic agents.
Antitumor activit y will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1 guidelines, with the understanding 
that in the context of postradi ation changes, tum or assessment m ay be difficul t and m ay need to 
be repeated over time to reach a clear determinat ion regarding responses and PD (see 
Secti on8.1). The tum or-based efficacy analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_855191] 1.[ADDRESS_1191319] igators’ tumor data from all scans based upon R ECIST 1.1.
4.2.[ADDRESS_1191320] igator determinat ion that the patient is no longer benefit ing fro m treatm ent wi th IP, or until 
another discont inuat ion criterion is met (see Section 7.1). This guidance is supported by  [CONTACT_855192] , in which pati ents were treated f or up to 12 m onths wi th durvalumab, 
and no new safet y signals were observed after 6 months of treatment ( Antonia et al  2017 )
. The 
median duration of tre atment in the PACIFIC Study  was 40.1 weeks (range, 1 to 54) in the 
durvalumab group, suggesting that durvalubab treatment was tolerable in this pat ient popul ation 
(Antoni a et a l 2018 ). Num erous Phase III studies are currently  evaluati ng durvalumab treatment 
until PD for patients with a variet y of malignancies. Although the results of these studies are not 
yet available, no new safet y signals have been i dentified as a result of the longer duration. In 
order to balance the patient burden associated with monthly visits until disease progression with 
the potenti al for addi tional clinical benefi t with prolonged treatm ent durati on, durval umab will 
be administered for 12 m onths in this study .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 36 (149 )4.2.5 Timing of treatment with durvalumab relative to prior radiation therapy
Nonclinical data show that ionizing radiat ion up-regul ates PD -L1 expression ( Deng et al  2014 , 
Zhang et al 2008b ). In addi tion, radi otherapy  releases new antigens leaving the cancer to act as 
an in situ va ccine that can elicit tumor -specific T cells. Thus, starting durvalumab as close as 
possible to the complet ion of radiat ion therapy , when ant igen release and PD -L1 expressio n are 
most likely to be at thei r maximum , will hopefully result in the most optimal benefit. The timing 
for durvalumab treatment init iation will be aligned with what has been tested in the PACIFIC 
Study  (ie, 42 days after the end of cCRT).
4.3 Justification for dose
This study  will use a fixed dose for durvalumab treatment (1500 mg q4w IV). Based on an 
average body  weight of 75 kg, a fixed dose of 1500 mg o f durvalumab q4w is equivalent to a 
weight-based dose of 20 mg/kg q4w.
4.3.1 Durvalumab monotherapy dose rationale
A durvalumab dose of 20 mg/kg q4w is supported by [CONTACT_255702], nonclinical act ivity, clinical  
PK/pharmacodynamics, bio markers, and activit y data f rom Study 1108) in pati ents wi th 
advanced so lid tumors and from a phase I study performed in Japanese patients with advanced 
solid tumor (D4190C00002).
PK/Pharmacodynamic data
Based on ava ilable PK/pharmacodynamic data from ongo ing Study 1108 with doses ranging 
from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (q2w) or 15 mg/kg every  3 weeks (q3w), durvalumab 
exhibited nonlinear (dose- dependent) PK consistent with target -mediated drug disposit ion. The 
PK approached linearit y at ≥ 3 mg/kg q2w, suggesting near complete target saturation 
(membrane -bound and sPD -L1), and further shows that the durvalumab dosing frequency can be 
adapted to a particular regimen given the linearit y seen at doses higher than 3 mg/kg. The 
expected half -life with doses ≥ 3mg/kg q2w is approximately [ADDRESS_1191321] experienced immune -complex disease fo llowing exposure to durvalumab. (For 
further informat ion on immunogenicit y, please see the current durvalumab IB).
A population PK model was developed using the data from Study 1108 (dos es= 0.1 to 10 mg/kg 
q2w or 15 mg/kg q3w; EuroQoL 2013 , Fairman et al 2014
). Mul tiple simulat ions indicate that a 
similar overall exposure is expected fo llowing both 10 mg/kg q2w and 20 mg/kg q4w regimens, 
as represented by [CONTACT_855193] n versus time curve at steady  state 
(4weeks) . Median peak drug concentration at steady  state i s expected to be higher with 
20mg/kg q4w (~1.5 fold) and median trough drug concentration at steady state is expected to be 
higher with 10 mg/kg q2w (~1.25 fold). Clinical activit y with the 20 mg/kg q4w do sing regimen 
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 37 (149 )is ant icipated to be consistent with 10 mg/kg q2w with the proposed similar dose of 20 mg/kg 
q4w expected to (a) achieve complete target saturation in majorit y of patients; (b) account for 
anticipated variabilit y in PK, pharmacodynamics, and c linical activit y in diverse cancer 
popul ations; (c) maintain sufficient PK exposure in case of ant idrug ant ibody  impact; and 
(d)achieve PK exposure that yielded maximal ant itumor activit y in animal models.
Given the similar area under the serum drug conce ntration-time curve (AUC) and modest 
differences in median peak and trough levels at steady  state, the observat ion that both regimens 
maintain complete sPD -L1 suppressio n at trough, and the available clinical data, the 20 mg/kg 
q4w and 10 mg/kg q2w regimens are expected to have similar efficacy and safet y profiles, 
supporting further development with a dose of 20 mg/kg q4w.
Clinical data
Refer to the current durvalumab IB for a com plete summary of clinical information including 
safet y, efficacy, and PK at t he 20 mg/kg q4w regimen.
4.3.2 Rationale for fixed -dosing
A population PK model was developed for durvalumab using monotherapy data Study 1108 
(N=292; doses = 0.1 to 10 mg/kg q2w or 15 mg/kg q3w; solid tumors). Populat ion PK analysis 
indicated only  minor impac t of body  weight on the PK of durvalumab (coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The 
impact of body  weight -based (10 mg/kg q2w) and fixed- dosing (750 mg q2w) of durvalumab 
was evaluated by  [CONTACT_855194] (5th, median, and 95th 
percent iles) using the populat ion PK model. A fixed dose of 750 mg was selected to approximate 
10mg/kg (based on median body  weight of ~75 kg). A total of [ADDRESS_1191322] been reported by  [CONTACT_2312] ( Litwin et al  1998 , Mauguen et al 2013, Narwal et 
al 2013 , Ng et al 2006, Wang et al2009, Zhang et al2012)
. Wang and co lleagues invest igated 
12monoclonal antibodies and found that fixed and body size -based dosing perform similarly , 
with fixed-dosing being better for 7 of 12 antibodies ( Wang et al2009). In addi tion, they  
investigated 18 therapeutic proteins and peptides and showed that fixed -dosing performed better 
for 12 of 18 in terms o f reducing the between -patient vari ability in PK/pharm acodynamic 
param eters ( Zhang et al2012).
A fixed -dosing approach is preferred by  [CONTACT_72959] y due to ease of use and 
reduced dosing errors. Given expectation of similar PK exposure and variabilit y,[COMPANY_008] 
considered it feasible to switch to fixed -dosing regimens. Based on average body  weight of 
75kg, a fixed dose of 1500 mg q4w durvalumab (equivalent to 20 mg/kg q4w) is included in the 
current study .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 38 (149 )4.4 End of study definition
For the purpose of Clinical Trial Transparency the definit ion of the end of the study  differs under 
Food and Drug Administration and European regulatory  requi rements:
European Unio n requirements define study  com pletion as the l ast vi sit of the l ast subject for 
any protocol related activit y.
Food and Drug Administration requirements defines two complet ion dates:
Primary Co mpletion Date –the date that the final patientis examined or receives an 
intervent ion for the purposes of final co llection of data for t he primary outcome 
measure, whether the clinical study  concl uded according to the pre -specified protocol or 
was terminated. In the case of clinical studies with more than one primary  outcom e 
measure with different complet ion dates, this term refers to the date on which data 
collect ion is co mpleted for all o f the primary  outcomes.
Study  Com pletion Date –the date the final patientis examined or receives an 
intervent ion for purposes of final collection o f data for the primary and secondary 
outcom e measures a nd AEs ( eg, last patient ’s last visit), whether the clinical study  
concl udes according to the pre -specified protocol or is terminated.
A patientis considered to have completed the study if they have co mpleted all phases o f the 
study  including the l ast vi sit or the l ast scheduled procedure shown in the SoA.
Patients m ay be wi thdrawn from  the study  if the study  itself is stopped. The study  may be 
stopped if, in the judgment of [COMPANY_008], study  patients are placed at undue risk because of 
clinically signif icant findings.
In the event that a rollover or safet y extensio n study  is available at the time of the final DCO and 
database closure, patients currently receiving treatment with durvalumab may be transit ioned to 
such a study , and the current study  woul d reach i ts end. The rollo ver or safet y extensio n study  
woul d ensure treatm ent continuat ion with visit assessments per i ts protocol . Any  patient who 
woul d be proposed to move to such a study  woul d be given a new ICF.
See Appendix A 6for guidelines for the dissemination of study  resul ts.
At the DCO, the clinical study  database will close to new data. However, patients will be 
permitted to continue to rec eive durvalumab beyo nd the closure of the database for the remainder 
of the [ADDRESS_1191323] igator, they are cont inuing to

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 51 (149 )All patients will receive efficacy scans and fo llow-up care in accordance wit h standard local 
clinical practice. Data should be recorded on patient charts but will not otherwise be reporte d for 
the purposes of this study .
For pati ents who are continuing to receive treatment with durvalumab fo llowing the final DCO 
and database closure, it is reco mmended that the patients continue the scheduled site visits and 
Invest igators monitor the patien ts’ safet y laboratory results prior to and periodically during 
treatm ent wi th durvalumab in order to manage AEs in accordance with the durvalumab Dosing 
Modificat ion and Toxi city Management Gui delines (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Following the DCO, SAE reporting applies only  to pati ents who are active on IP and within 
90days after the l ast dose; in all other cases, only  a Statem ent of Death notificat ion is to be sent 
to [COMPANY_008]. No OS data will be recorded in the study  database after DCO for the study . 
Invest igators will report SAEs to [COMPANY_008] Patient Safet y via paper case report forms (CRFs) 
until [ADDRESS_1191350] ice and in alignment with the Dosing Modification and Toxicit y 
Management Guidelines (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), unless the event is considered by [CONTACT_855199], or the pati ent is l ost to foll ow-up. Data will not be captured for the 
purposes of this study  outsi de of being r ecorded in the patients’ source documents.
Different drug supply options will be available depending on the country, and these will be 
proposed to the patient when the most appropriate alternat ives for continued treatment have been 
agreed between AZ and th e Invest igator. Options may include the participation in a new rollo ver 
study  or, if the study  drug has been l ocally approved for use in this disease indicat ion, pati ents 
may be discont inued and switched to the marketed product, in accordance wit h local laws. In the 
event that a rollover or safet y extensio n study  is available at the time of the final DCO and 
database closure, patients currently receiving treatment with durvalumab may be transit ioned to 
such a study , and the current study  woul d reach i ts end . The roll over or safet y extensio n study  
woul d ensure treatm ent continuat ion with visit assessments per i ts protocol . Any  patient who 
woul d be proposed to move to such a study  woul d be given a new ICF.

appropriate sections of the CRF.
6.4.2 Durvalumab drug- drug interactions
There i s no information to date on drug- drug interactions wit h durvalumab eit her nonclinically or 
in patients. As durvalu mab is a monoclonal ant ibody  and therefore a protein, it will be degraded 
to sm all pept ides and amino acids and will be eliminated by [CONTACT_855201]. It i s therefore not expected that durvalumab will induce or inhibit the major dru g 
metabo lizing cytochrome P450 pathways. As a result, there are no expected pharmacokinet ic 
drug-drug interactions. The MOA of durvalumab invo lves binding to PD -L1, and therefore 
significant pharm acodynamic drug interactions with the commo nly administered concomitant 
medicat ions are not expected. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], appropriate clinical mo nitoring in all o f the planned 
clinical studies will be conducted to evaluate any  potenti al drug -drug interacti ons.

As a result of imAEs that could potentially be experi enced by  [CONTACT_584228], steroids, 
and other immunosuppressant rescue medicat ion has to be made available to this pat ient 
popul ation. The 2 products that fall into the category  of immunosuppressants are infliximab 
(eg,for colit is) and my copheno late (eg, for hepatit is). [COMPANY_008] supply chain will be 
responsible for sourcing these 2 rescue medicat ions to the sites if countries cannot source rescue 
medicat ions locally or if local regulat ions prevent the use of infliximab and mycopheno latein

7 DISCONTINUATION OF T REATMENT AND PATIENT
WITHDRAWAL
7.1 Discontinuation of study tr eatment
An individual pat ient will not receive any further treatment (durvalumab) if any of the fo llowing 
occur i n the patient in quest ion:
Withdrawal o f consent fro m further treatment with IP. The patient is, at any  time, free to 
discontinue treatm ent, wi thout prej udice to further treatment. A patient who discont inues 
treatm ent is norm ally expected to continue to participate in the study  (eg, for safet y and 
survival fo llow-up) unless they  specifically wit hdraw their consent to all further 
participat ion in any study  procedures and assessments (see Section 7.3).
An AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] o f the Invest igator or [COMPANY_008], contraindicates further dosi ng
Any AE that meets criteria for discontinuation as defined in the Dosing Modification and 
Toxicit y Management Guidelines (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
Pregnancy or intent to beco me pregnant
Noncom pliance wi th the study  protocol  that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the Invest igator or 
[COMPANY_008], warrants withdrawal fro m treatm ent wi th IP (eg, refusal to adhere to scheduled

Subsequent anticancer therapy  (including radiat ion therapy ) will be assessed and recorded from 
the end of treatment with study  treatm ent through the safet y and survival fo llow-up peri od or 
until death for patients who have discontinu ed study treatment, including at PD.
7.1.2 Follow
-up for survival
Patients will  be followed up for survival status as indicated in the SoA ( Table 2) until death, 
withdrawal  of consent, or the end of the study . Survival information may be obtained via 
telephone contact [CONTACT_855204]’s family , or by  [CONTACT_584231]’s current 
physician. Addit ional assessments, including subsequent ant icancer therapy, are to be recorded at 
the time o f survival fo llow-up and are detailed in the SoA 
(Table 2).
7.1.[ADDRESS_1191357] the patient’s participation in 
the study . A patient who decides to discont inue IP will always be asked abou t the reason(s) for 
discontinuat ion and the presence of any  AE. The pati ent shoul d continue attending subsequent 
study  visits, and data collect ion shoul d continue according to the study  protocol . If the pati ent 
does not agree to continue in -person study  visits, a m odified foll ow-up m ust be arranged to 
ensure the collect ion of endpo ints and safet y informat ion. This fo llow-up coul d be a tel ephone 
contact [CONTACT_493212], a contact [CONTACT_4490] a relat ive or treating physician, or informat ion from 
medical records. Th e approach taken should be recorded in the medical records. A patient that 
agrees to m odified fo llow-up is not consi dered to have wit hdrawn consent or to have wit hdrawn 
from the study .
Patients who are perm anent ly discont inued from further receipt of IP, r egardless of the reason, 
will be ident ified as having permanent ly discontinued treatment. Patients who are permanent ly 
discontinued will enter fo llow

7.[ADDRESS_1191361] has been established by [CONTACT_855206] (see Secti on4.4)
, such that there is insufficient information to determine 
the pati ent’s status at that time. Patients who refuse to co ntinue participation in the study, 
including telephone contact, should be documented as “wit hdrawal o f consent” rather than “lost 
to fo llow-up.” Invest igators should document attempts to re- establish contact [CONTACT_855207]. If contact [CONTACT_4490] a missing patient is re
-established, the 
patient shoul d not be consi dered l ost to f ollow -up and evaluat ions should resume according to 
the protocol.
In order to support key  end points of PFS and OS analyses, the survival status of all pa tients in 
the full analysis and the safet y analysis sets should be re -checked, this includes those patients 
who wi thdrew consent or are classified as “lo st to follow -up.”
Lost to Follow -up – site personnel should check hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], the patients’ curre nt 
physician, and a publicly  available death regi stry (if available) to obtain a current survival 
status. (The applicable CRF modules will be updated.)
In the event that the patient has actively wit hdrawn consent to the processing o f their 
personal data, t he survival status of the patient can be obtained by [CONTACT_588068] m 
publicly  available death registries (if available) where it is possible to do so under applicable 
local laws to obtain a current survival status. (The applicable CRF modules will be u pdated.)
7.3 Withdrawal from the study
Patients are free to withdraw from the study  at any time (treatment and assessments) without 
prejudice to further treatment.
Patients who wi thdraw consent for further participation in the study  will not receive any  further 
durvalumab or further study  observat ion, wi th the excepti on of  follow-up for survival , which will  
continue until the end of the study  unless the pati ent has expressly wit hdrawn their consent to

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 59 (149 )survival fo llow-up. Note that the patient may be offered ad ditional tests or tapering of treatment 
to wi thdraw safely.
A pat ient who wi thdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) for withdrawal and 
the presence o f any AE. The Invest igator will fo llow-up AEs outside of the clinical study .
If a patient withdraws consent, they  will be specifically asked if they are withdrawing consent to:
All further parti cipat ion in the study including any further fo llow-up (eg, survival contact 
[CONTACT_21646])
Withdrawal to the use of any samples (see Sect ion 8.8.6 )
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA ( Table 1and Table 2).
The Investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRFs. The Web Bas ed Data Capture 
system  will be used for data collect ion and query  handling.
The Investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, legibilit y, and timeliness of the data 
recorded and of the provisio n of answers to data queries according to the clinical study
agreem ent. The Investigator will sign the completed eCRFs. A copy  of the com pleted eCRFs will 
be archived at the study  site.
Immediate safet y concerns should be discussed wit h the Sponsor immediately upon occurrence 
or awareness to determine if the patien t shoul d continue or di scont inue study  treatm ent.
Adherence to the study  design requi rements, including those specified in the SoA (Table 1and 
Table 2), is essent ial and requi red for study conduct.
All screening evaluat ions must be com pleted and reviewed to confirm that potential pat ients 
meet all eligibilit y criteria. The Invest igator will maintain a screening log to record details o f all 
patients screened and to confirm eligibilit y or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the patient’s routine clinical management (eg, blood coun t and 
imaging assessments) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or 
baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were 
perform ed wi thin the time frame defin ed in the SoA (Table 1and Table 2).
8.1 Efficac y assessments
The key  efficacy  endpoints are: m edian PFS; proporti on of  patients progressi on-free at 6 and 
12months (PFS6 and PFS12, respectively); median OS; proportion of patients alive at 
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 60 (149 )12months (OS12); and median time to NSCLC -related death, from first IP dose administration; 
ORR and DoR. Efficacy  assessments of PFS, ORR, and DoR will be derived (by  [CONTACT_38227]) 
using Invest igator assessments according to RECIST 1.1.
Tumor assessments utilize images from CT (preferred) or MRI, each preferably with IV contrast, 
of the chest and abdo men (including the ent ire liver and both adrenal glands) co llected during 
screening/baseline and at regular (fo llow-up) intervals during study  treatm ent. Any  other areas of 
disease involvement should be addit ionally  imaged based on the signs and symptoms o f 
individual pat ients. It i s important to follow the tumor assessment schedule as closely  as possible 
(refer to Table 1and Table 2). If  an unscheduled assessment is performed and the patient has not 
progr essed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at the next 
scheduled visit. Treatment con tinues for 12 months or until disease progression (clinical 
progression/deterioration ± radio logical progressio n by [CONTACT_393] 1.1), and scanning/tum or 
assessments continue throughout treatment. An addit ional follow-up scan is requested fo llowing 
progression if clinically  feasible.
The RECIST 1.1 guidelines ( Appendix F) provi de a m ethod of assessment of change in tumor 
burden in response to treatment. Screening/baseline imaging should be performed no more than 
[ADDRESS_1191362] 1.1 assessments of baseline images 
ident ify TLs (defined as measurable) and nontarget lesio ns (NTLs). On- study  images are 
evaluated for TLs and NTLs chosen at baseline, and for new lesions when they  appear. This 
allows determinat ion of fo llow
-up TL response, NTL lesio n response, the presence of 
unequivocal new lesio ns, and overall t imepo int responses (CR, PR, SD, PD, or Not Evaluable 
[NE]).
For all patients who are treated through progressi on, a fo llow-up scan is to be collected after the 
initial RECIST 1.1 -defined PD, 4 -8weeks after the prior assessment of PD; this fo llow-up scan 
is evaluated using the post
-progression criteria outlined in Appendix F. If the subsequent scan 
confirms the immediate prior radio logical PD, no addit ional scans are required unless the patient 
is allowed to continue study  treatm ent; however, if the subsequen t scan does not confirm the 
immediate prior radio logical PD, scanning shoul d continue until the next RECIST 1.1-defined 
PD which in turn will require a subsequent scan evaluated using the post -progression criteria 
outlined in Appendix F.

8.2.2 Physical examinations
Physical examinat ions will be performed according to the assessment schedules (see the SoAs). 
Full physical examinat ions will include assessments of the head, ey es, ears, nose, and throat and 
the respi [INVESTIGATOR_696] , cardi ovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, m uscul oskeletal , neurol ogical, 
derm atological, hematol ogic/lymphat ic, and endocrine systems. Height will be measured at

Subsequent infusions
BP, pul se, and other vital signs should be measured, collected/recorded in eCRF prior to the start 
of the infusio n. Patients should be carefully m onitored and BP and other vital signs should be 
measured during and postinfusio n as per inst itution standard and as clinically indicated. Any  
clinically significant changes in vital signs should be entered onto an unscheduled vital signs 
CRF page.
Situations in which vital signs results should be reported as AEs are described in Sect ion8.3.[ADDRESS_1191367] ions, the vital signs values shoul d be entered into the CRF.
8.2.4 Electrocardiograms
Resting 12 -lead ECGs will be recorded at screening and as clinically indicated throughout the 
study  (see the SoAs). ECGs should be obtained after the patient has been in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_85951] 
5minutes and recorded while the patient remains in that posit ion.
In case of clinically  significant ECG abnorm alities, including a QTcF (QT interval corrected for 
heart rate using Fridericia’s formula) value > 470 ms, 2 additional 12-lead ECGs should be 
obtained over a brief peri od (eg, 30 minutes) to confirm the finding.

Any significant change from baseline or screening must be reported as an AE.
8.2.7 Other safety assessments
If new or worsening pulmo nary symptom s (eg, dyspnea) or radio logical abnorm ality suggest ive 
of pneumo nitis/ILD is observed, toxicit y management as described i n detail in the Dosing 
Modificat ion and Toxi city Management Gui delines (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) will be applied. The 
resul ts of the full diagnostic worku p (including high -resolution computed tomography  [HRCT], 
blood and sputum culture, hematological parameters, etc) will be captured in the eCRF. It is 
strongly  recommended to perform a full diagnostic workup, to exclude alternative causes such as 
lymphangit ic carcino matosis, infect ion, allergy , cardi ogenic edema, or pulmo nary hemorrhage. 
In the presence of confirmatory  HRCT scans where other causes of respi[INVESTIGATOR_855181], a diagnosis of pneumo nitis (ILD) should be considered and the Dosin g 
Modificat ion and Toxi city Management Gui delines shoul d be f ollowed.
Pneumonitis (interstitial lung disease) investigation

The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, document ing, and recording 
events that meet the definit ion of an AE or SAE. For informat ion on how to fo llow/up AEs see 
Secti on8.3.3 .
8.3.1 Method of detecting AEs and SAEs
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal quest ioning of the patient is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurrences.

he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study  treatm ent or study  parti cipat ion, 
the Invest igator should notify the Sponsor.
The m ethod of recording, evaluat ing, and assessing causalit y of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for complet ing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix B.
8.3.3 Follow- up of AEs and SAEs
After the init ial AE/SAE report, the Invest igator is required to proactively fo llow each pat ient at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs, SAEs, and AESIs (as defined in Sect ion 8.3.12 )
 will be 
followed unt il reso lution, stabilizat ion, the event is otherwise explained, or the patient is lost to 
follow-up.
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’ s last AE assessment in the study  are f ollowed up by  
[CONTACT_325391] (this may be beyo nd the [ADDRESS_1191371]

request addit ional information for any  patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , 
if judged necessary .
8.3.4 Adverse event data collection
The fo llowing variables will be collected for each AE:
AE (verbat im)
The date when the AE started and stopped
The m aximum  CTCAE grade reported
Changes in CTCAE Grade (report only the maximum CTCAE Grade for a calendar day)
Whether the AE is serious or not
Invest igator causalit y rating against the IPs (yes or no)
Action taken with regard to IPs
Administrati on of  treatm ent for the AE
Outcom e
In addit ion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for SAEs:
Date the AE met criteria for SAE
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durv alumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 70 (149 )Date the Invest igator became aware of the SAE
Seriousness criteria
Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
Date of discharge
Probable cause of death
Date of death
Whether an autopsy  was perform ed
Causalit y assessment in relat ion to study  procedure(s)
Causalit y assessment in relat ion to other medicat ion, as explained in Section 8.3.5
Descript ion of the SAE
The grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE versio n 5.0will be ut ilized for all events 
with an assigned CTCAE grading. For those events without assigned CTCAE grades, the 
recommendat ion in the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, moderate, and severe events into 
CTCAE grades should be used. A copy  of the CTCAE versio n 5.0can be downloaded fro m the 
Cancer Therapy  Evaluat ion Program website ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ).
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs. Severit y is a measure of intensit y, 
whereas seriousness is defined by  [CONTACT_244986] B 2. An AE of severe intensit y need 
not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria s hown in Appendix B 2. On 
the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disabilit y may be considered a 
mild stroke, but it would be an SAE if it sat isfies the criteria shown in Appendix
 B 2.
8.3.5 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal relat ionship between IP and each AE, and answer “yes” or 
“no” to the question “Do y ou consider that there is a reasonable possibilit y that the event m ay 
have been caused by [CONTACT_33249]?”
For SAEs, causal relat ionship will also be assessed for other medicat ion and study  procedures. 
Note th at for SAEs that could be associated with any study  procedure the causal relationship is 
implied as “yes.”
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix Bto the Clinical 
Study  Protocol  (CSP).
8.3.6 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_855214] m 
the study  site staff: “Have you had any healt h problems since the previous visit/y ou were last 
asked?” , or revealed by [CONTACT_493221]. When collect ing 
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 71 (149 )AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and 
symptoms. Ho wever, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not 
generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded 
separately .
8.3.7 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from the Clini cal Study  Protocol -mandated l aboratory  tests and vi tal signs will be 
summarized in the clinical study  report (CSR). Deterioration as co mpared to baseline in 
protocol -mandated l aboratory  tests and vital signs should therefore only  be reported as AEs if 
theyfulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discont inuat ion of treatment with the IP.
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associa ted laboratory  resul t/vital sign will  
be considered as addit ional information. Wherever possible, the reporting Invest igator uses the 
clinical rather than the laboratory  term  (eg, anemia versus low hemoglo bin value). In the absence 
of clinical signs or sym ptoms, clinically  relevant deteri orations in nonmandated parameters 
shoul d be reported as AE(s).
Deteri oration of  a laboratory  value that i s unequivocally due to disease progression should not be 
reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically rele vant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion as 
compared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally  related to 
the disease under study (see Sect ion 8.3.9 ).
8.3.8 Hy’s Law
Cases where a patient shows elevat ions in liver bio chemistry  may require further evaluat ion and 
occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3×ULN together with TBL ≥ 2×ULN may  need to be reported as 
SAEs. Pl ease r efer to Appendix Efor further instruction on cases o f increases in liver 
biochemistry  and eval uation of  Hy’s Law.
8.3.9 Disease progression
Disease progressi on can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condit ion attributable to the 
disease for which the IP is being studied. It may  be an increase in the severit y of the di sease 
under study  and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. T he development of new or 
progression of exist ing metastasis to the primary cancer under study shoul d be considered as 
disease progressi on and not an AE. Events which are unequivocally  due to di sease progressi on 
shoul d not be reported as an AE during the st udy.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 72 (149 )8.3.10 New malignancies
AEs for malignant tumors reported during a study  shoul d generally  be assessed as seri ous AEs. If 
no other seriousness criteria apply, the “important medical event” criterion should be used. In 
certain situat ions, however, medical judg ment on an individual event basis should be applied to 
clarify that the m alignant tum or event shoul d be assessed and reported as a nonserious AE. For 
example, if the tumor is included as medical history and progression occurs during the study , but 
the prog ression does not change treatment and/or prognosis o f the malignant tum or, the AE m ay 
not fulfill the attributes for being assessed as serious, although reporting of the progression of the 
malignant tumor as an AE is valid and should occur. Also, some ty pes of m alignant tum ors, 
which do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], may 
be assessed as nonserious; examples include Stage [ADDRESS_1191372] ion is a new 
malignant tumor (ie, it is not the tumor for which entry  into the study  is a cri terion and that is 
being treated by  [CONTACT_855215]). Malignant tumors that –as part of normal, if rare, 
progression –undergo transformat ion (eg, Richter's transformat ion of B cell chronic lymphocy tic 
leukemia into diffuse large B cell lympho ma) shou ld not be considered a new malignant tumor.
8.3.[ADDRESS_1191373] be reported as follows:
Death cl early  resul ting fro m disease progression should be reported to the Study  
Moni tor/Phy sician at the next monitoring visit and should be documented in the eCRF in the 
Statem ent of Death page. It should not be reported as an SAE.
Where death is not due (or not clear ly due) to progressio n of the disease under study , the AE 
causing the death must be reported to the Study  Moni tor/Physician as an SAE within 24 
hours. It should also be documented in the Statement of Death page in the eCRF. The report 
shoul d contain a comm ent regarding the coinvo lvement of PD, if appropriate, and should 
assign main and contributory  causes of death.
Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE. It should also be 
docum ented in the Statem ent of Death page in the eCRF. A pos tmortem  may be helpful  in 
the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed, a copy  of the post -mortem resul ts 
shoul d be f orwarded to [COMPANY_008] Pat ient Safet y or its representative within the usual 
timeframes.
Deaths occurring after the protocol -defined safet y follow-up period after the administration of

requi re close m onitoring . An AESI m ay be seri ous or nonseri ous. The rapi d reporting of AESIs 
allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them in 
associ ation with the use of thi s IP.
AESIs for durvalumab include but are not limited to events with a potenti al inflammatory  or 
immune -mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent monitoring and/or 
intervent ions such as steroids, immunosuppressants, and/or hormone replacement therapy . These 
AESIs are being closely  monitored in clinical  studies with durvalumab mo notherapy  and 
combinat ion therapy . An imAE is defined as an AESI that is associated with drug exposure and 
is consistent with an immune -mediated MOA and where there is no clear alternate etiology. 
Serol ogic, immuno logic, and histol ogic (biopsy ) data, as appropri ate, shoul d be used to support 
an imAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplast ic, infect ious, 
metabo lic, toxin, or other etio logic causes of the imAE.
If the Investigator has any quest ions in regards to an event being an imAE, the Invest igator 
shoul d prom ptly contact [CONTACT_33139].
AESI/imAEs observed with ant i-PD-L/PD -1 agents such as durvalumab include pneumo nitis, 
hepat itis, diarrhea/co litis, intestinal perforation, endocrinopathies (hypo -and hyper -thyroidism, 
adrenal insufficiency , hypophysi tis/hypopi [INVESTIGATOR_855182] 1 di abetes m ellitus), nephri tis, 
rash/dermat itis, myocardi tis, my ositis/polymyo sitis, pancreat itis and rare/less frequent imAEs 
including neuromuscular toxicit ies such as myas thenia gravis and Guillain- Barre syndrome.
Other inflammatory  responses that are rare/less frequent with a potential immune- mediated 
etiology include, but are not limited to, pericardit is, sarcoidosis, uveit is, and other events 
involving the ey e and skin, hematol ogical, and rheum atological events, vasculit is, noninfect ious 
meningit is, and noninfectious encephalit is. It is possible that events with an inflammatory  or 
immune -related m echanism  coul d occur in nearly  all organs.
In addit ion, infusio n-related rea ctions and hypersensit ivity/anaphylact ic react ions wit h a different 
underlying pharmaco logical et iology are al so considered AESIs.
Further informat ion on these risks (eg, present ing symptoms) can be found in the current version 
of the durvalumab IB. More s pecific guidelines for their evaluat ion and treatment are described 
in detail in the Dose Modificat ion and Toxi city Management Gui delines (see Sect ion [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
These guidelines have been prepared by [CONTACT_855216] -2.0 [COMPANY_008]

8.3.13 Safety data to be collected following the final DCO of the study
For pati ents continuing to receive durvalumab treatment after final DCO and database closure, it 
is reco mmended that the patients continue the scheduled site visi ts and Investi gators m onitor the 
patient’s safet y laboratory  resul ts pri or to and periodi cally during treatment with durvalumab in 
order to manage AEs in accordance with the durvalumab Dose Modificat ion and Toxicit y 
Management Guidelines (see Sec tion [IP_ADDRESS] ). All data after the final DCO and database closure 
will be recorded in the patient notes but, with the except ion of SAEs, will not otherwise be 
reported for the purposes of this study .
All SA Es that occur in patients still receiving durvalumab treatment (or within the [ADDRESS_1191375] dose of durvalumab treatment) after the final DCO and database closure must 
be reported as detailed in Sect ion 8.4.[ADDRESS_1191376] igation.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 78 (149 )[IP_ADDRESS] Drug Misuse
Drug misuse is the intentional and inappropriate use (by a study patient) of IP or [COMPANY_008] 
NIP for m edicinal purposes outside of the authori sed product informat ion, or for unauthorised 
IPs or [COMPANY_008] NIPs, outside the intended use as specified in the protocol and includes 
deliberate administration o f the product by  [CONTACT_244972].
The full definit ion and examples o f drug misuse can be found in Appendix B 8.
8.4.5 Management of IP-related toxicities
The fo llowing general guidance should be fo llowed for m anagement of toxi cities.
Treat each of the toxicit ies with maximum supportive care (including ho lding the agent 
suspected of causing the toxicit y if required).
If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, considerat ion should be given to 
continuing the same dose of the assig ned IP al ong wi th appropri ate conti nuing supportive 
care. If medically appropriate, dose modificat ions are permitted.
All dose modificat ions should be documented with clear reasoning and documentation of the 
approach taken.
All toxicit ies will be graded a ccording to NCI CTCAE, Version 5.0.
[IP_ADDRESS] Specific toxicity management and dose modification information –durvalumab
Com prehensive toxi city management guidelines (TMGs) have been developed to assist 
Invest igators with the recognition and management of toxicit ies associated with use of the 
immune -checkpo int inhibitor, durvalumab (PD -L1 inhibitor). Given the similar underlying 
mechanisms of toxicit ies observed with these [ADDRESS_1191382] ug as monotherapy  or in combinat ion. Addit ionally , 
these guidelines are applicable when durvalumab is used alone or in combinat ion and is 
administered concurrently or sequent ially with other anti cancer drugs (ie, antineoplast ic 
chemotherapy, targeted agent s) as part of a protocol -specific treatment regimen. The TMGs 
provi de inform ation for the m anagement of immune -mediated reactions, infusio n-related 
reacti ons, and nonimmune -mediated reactions that may be observed with checkpo int inhibitor 
monotherapy  or in combinat ion checkpo int inhibit or regimens, with specific instructions for 
checkpoint inhibitor -specific dose modificat ions (including discont inuat ion) and treatment 
intervent ions. Invest igators are advised, however, to use local practice guidelines and co nsult 
local references for the management of toxicit ies observed wit h other anticancer treatment.
The m ost current version of the TMGs entit led, “Dosing Modificat ion and Toxicit y Management 
Guidelines for Immune -Mediated, Infusio n-Related, and Non -Immune -Mediated React ions 
(MEDI4736 Monotherapy  or Combinat ion Therapy with Tremelimumab or Tremelimumab 
Monotherapy ),” and is provi ded to the invest igative site as an Annex document and is 
maintained within the Site Master File. In addit ion, a current version o f TMGs i s available

Patients shoul d be thoroughly  eval uated and appropri ate efforts should be made to rule out 
neopl astic, infecti ous, m etabo lic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the imAE. Serologic, 
immuno logic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to support an imAE 
diagnosis. In the absence of a clear alternative etio logy, events s hould be considered potentially  
immune -related. In addi tion, there are certain circumstances in which durvalumab should be 
perm anent ly discont inued (see Section 7.1of this protocol  and the TMGs). Following the first 
dose of IP, subsequent administration of durvalumab can be modified based on toxicit ies 
observed as described in the Dosing Modificat ion and TMGs. These guidelines have been 
prepared by  [CONTACT_637756]/her clinical judgment in 
treating these ty pes of  toxici ties. These guidelines apply to AEs considered causally related to 
durvalumab monotherapy  by [CONTACT_72943].

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 104 (149 )A “serious breach” means a breach likely to affect to a significant degree the safet y and 
rights of a patientor the reliabilit y and robustness of the data generated in the clinical trial.
[COMPANY_008] will comply wit h country -specific regulatory  requi rements rel ating to serious 
breach reporting to the regulatory  authori ty , IRB/IEC, and Invest igators.
Where the EU Clinical Trials Regulat ion 536/[ADDRESS_1191409] 
processes to enter details o f seriousbreaches into the European Medicines Agency  Clinical 
TrialInformati on System  (CTIS ). It is important to note that redacted versions of serious 
breach reports will be available to the public via CTIS.
If any (potential) serious breach occurs in the cours e of the study , Invest igators or other site 
personnel will inform the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives immediately.
In certain regions/countries, [COMPANY_008] has a legal responsibilit y to notify both the local 
regul atory  authori ty and other regul atory agencies about such breaches.
The invest igator should have a process in place to ensure that:
The site staff or service providers delegated by [CONTACT_093]/inst itution are able to 
ident ify the occurrence of a (potential) serious breach .
A (potential ) seri ous breach i s prom ptly reported to [COMPANY_008] or delegated party , through 
the contacts (email address or telephone number) provided by [CONTACT_38227].

the pati ent was enrolled in the study  and the date the written consent was obtained. The 
authori zed person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF.
Patients m ust be re -consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their participat ion 
in the study .
A copy  of the ICF(s) m ust be provi ded to the pati ent or the pati ent’s legally  authori zed 
representative.
If a patient declines to participate in any vo luntary exploratory  genet ic research co mponent of the 
study , there will  be no penal ty or loss of benefit to the patient and he/she will not be excluded 
from other aspects of the study .
If a patient’s partner becomes pregnant during or within [ADDRESS_1191412] dose of 
durvalumab, the partner is asked to sign the "Adult  Study  Informed Consent Form for Pregnant 
Partners of Study  Patients" and provide informat ion about the pregnancy  accordingly.
The ICF will contain a separate section that addresses the use of remaining mandatory  samples 
for opti onal expl oratory  research. The Invest igator or authorized designee will explain to each 
patient the obj ectives of the exploratory research. Patients will be told that they are free to refuse 
toparticipate and may wit hdraw their consent at any t ime and for any reason during the storage 
period. The pati ent will give a separate agreement to allow any remaining specimens to be used 
for expl oratory  research. Pati ents who decline to participate in th is optional research will indicate 
this in the ICF. If a patient withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the 
samples will be disposed of/destroy ed, and the action documented. If samples already have been 
analyzed at the time of the requ est,[COMPANY_008] will not be obliged to destroy the results of this 
research.
A 4 Data protection
Patients will be assigned a unique ident ifier by [CONTACT_38227]. Any patientrecords or datasets that 
are transferred to [COMPANY_008] will contain the ident ifier only; patientnames or any  informat ion 
which woul d make the patient ident ifiable will not be transferred.
The patientmust be informed that their personal study- related da ta will be used by  
[CONTACT_271123] h local data protection law. The level of disclo sure and use of 
their data m ust al so be explained to the patient in the informed consent. 
The patientmust be informed that their medical records may be examin ed by  [CONTACT_73005] y Assurance auditors or other authorised personnel appo inted by  [CONTACT_38227], by  
[CONTACT_6667]/IEC members, and by [CONTACT_32857].
The patientmust be informed that data will be collected only for the business needs. We will 
only collect and use the minimum amount of personal data to support our business activit ies 
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 106 (149 )and will not make personal data available to any one (including internal staff) who is not 
authori sed or does not have a business need to know the inf ormation. 
The patientmust be informed that in so me cases their data may be pseudonymised. The 
General data Protection Regultaio n defines pseudonymisat ion as the processing of personal 
data in such a way  that the personal  data can no l onger be attributed to a specific individual 
without the use of addit ional informat ion, provided that such addit ional informat ion is kept 
separately  and protected by  [CONTACT_855221].
Personal Data Br eaches
A ‘personal data breach’ means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful 
destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, 
stored or oth erwise processed.
In com pliance wi th applicable l aws, the Data Controller1for the processing act ivity where 
the personal data breach occurred ([COMPANY_008] or respectively the site), will notify the data 
protecti on authori ties wi thout undue del ay within the legal  term s provi ded f or such 
notification and wit hin the prescribed form and content.
Whilst [COMPANY_008] has processes in place to deal with personal data breaches it is important 
that invest igators that work with [COMPANY_008] have controls in place to p rotect patient data 
privacy .
The Investigator should have a process in place to ensure that:
Allow site staff or service providers delegated by  [CONTACT_3170]/inst itution to i dentify the 
occurrence of a (potential) personal data breaches.
Any (potential ) personal  data breach is prom ptly reported to [COMPANY_008] or delegated party, 
through the contacts (e -mail address or telephone number) provided by [CONTACT_38227].
[COMPANY_008] and the site must demonstrate that they:
Have taken all necessary  steps to avoi d personal data breaches and 
Have undertaken measures to prevent such breaches from occurring in the first place and to 
mitigate the impact of occurred data breaches (eg, applying encrypt ion, maintaining and

Where possible, have developed an internal data breach reporting and invest igation process 
and internal protocol s with guidance on how to respond swift ly and diligent ly to the 
occurrence of a personal data breach.
Where it has not been possible to develop an internal data breach reporting and invest igation 
process, the site fo llows [COMPANY_008]’s instructions.
Notificat ion of personal Data Breach to patient s:
Notificat ion to patients is done by [CONTACT_855223], the notificat ion is 
done in collaboration with the site and is performed by  [CONTACT_855224]/or Principal Invest igator, 
acting on behalf of [COMPANY_008], so that [COMPANY_008] has no access to the identifying 
personal informat ion of the patients. The site and/or Principal Invest igator shall conduct the 
notification by [CONTACT_855225].
If a personal data breach occurs in a processor’s systems, engaged by [CONTACT_38227], the 
processor under con tractual obligat ions wit h [COMPANY_008] prompt ly and in due course after 
discovering the breach notifies [COMPANY_008] and provides full cooperation with the 
investigat ion. In these cases, to the extent [COMPANY_008] is the Data Controller for the 
processing activi ty where the breach occurred, it will be responsible for the notificat ion to 
data protecti on authori ties and, if applicable, to patient s. If the personal data breach needs to 
be notified to the patients, the notificat ion to patient s is done in co llaboratio n with the si te 
and is performed by [CONTACT_5753]/or Principal Investigator, acting on behalf o f the Sponsor, 
so that [COMPANY_008] has no access to the ident ifying personal information o f the patients.
If a personal data breach invo lving an [COMPANY_008]'s rep resentative device (ie ,Study  
Moni tor laptop), [COMPANY_008] representative will provide will provide [COMPANY_008] wit h all 
of the inform ation needed for notificat ion of the breach, without disclo sing data that allows 
[COMPANY_008] direct ly or indirect ly to ide ntify the patients. The notificat ion will be done by 
[CONTACT_855226] h the informat ion provi ded by  [CONTACT_855227] i nformat ion that could entail a risk of re -ident ificat ion of the patients. If the data 
breach must be notified to the data subjects, the notification will be done directly by [CONTACT_855228]/or Principal Invest igator, acting on behalf 
of the Sponsor, so that [COMPANY_008] has no access to the ident ifying personal informat ion of 
the patients. The contract between [COMPANY_008] and the Study  Moni tor shall expressly 
specify these condit ions.
The contract between the site and [COMPANY_008] for performing the clinical research includes 
the provisions and rules regarding who is resp onsible for coordinat ing and direct ing the 
actions in rel ation to the breaches and performing the mandatory  notificati ons to authori ties 
and patients, where applicable.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 110 (149 )Appendix BAdverse event definitions and additional safety information
B 1 Definition of adverse events
An adverse event (AE) is the development of any untoward medical occurrence (other than 
progression of the malignancy  under evaluat ion) in a patient or clinical study  patient 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with 
this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and u nintended sign (eg, an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a m edicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The term  AE is used to include both seri ous and nonseri ous AEs and can include a deterioration 
of a pre -exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may  occur at any  time, including run -in or washout 
periods, even if no study  treatm ent has been administered.
B 2 Definitions of serious adverse events
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE occurring during any study  phase (ie, run -in, treatment, 
washout, follow -up), that fulfills one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res in -patient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_24508]
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty
Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect
Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical 
treatm ent to prevent o ne of the outcomes listed above
AEs for malignant tumors reported during a study  shoul d generally  be assessed as seri ous. If no 
other seriousness criteria apply , the ‘important m edical event’ cri terion shoul d be used. In certain 
situations, however, m edical judgment on an individual event basis should be applied to clarify  
that the m alignant tum or event shoul d be assessed and reported as a nonserious AE. For 
example, if the tumor is included as medical history and progression occurs during the study , but 
the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis o f the malignant tum or, the AE m ay 
not fulfill the attributes for being assessed as serious, although reporting of the progression of the 
malignant tumor as an AE is valid and should occur. Also, so me types of malignant tumors, 
which do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], may 
be assessed as nonserious; examples include Stage [ADDRESS_1191415] ion is a new 
malignant tumor (ie, it is not the tumor for which entry  into the study  is a cri terion and that is 
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 111 (149 )being treated by  [CONTACT_855230]). Malignant tumors that –as part of normal, if rare, 
progression –undergo transformat ion (eg, Richter's transformat ion of B cell chronic lymphocy tic 
leukemia into diffuse large B cell lympho ma) should not be considered a new malignant tumor.
B 3 Life-threatening
“Life -threatening” means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the patient’ s 
death. “Life -threatening” does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might 
have caused death (eg, hepatit is that resolved without hepat ic failure).
B 4 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33093], alt hough the reasons for it 
may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33094]/or surgical operations 
planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the pati ent was enrolled in the study , prov ided that it di d not deteriorate in an unexpected way  
during the study .
B [ADDRESS_1191416] drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgment must be used.
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring IV hydrocortisone 
treatm ent
Hepatotoxicit y caused by [CONTACT_499501] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dy scrasias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusio n, etc) or convulsio ns 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 112 (149 )B [ADDRESS_1191417] itute CTCAE versio n 5.0 will be 
utilized for all events with an assigned CTCAE grading. For those events without assi gned 
CTCAE grades, the criteria recommended in the CTCAE manual that converts severit y levels 
into CTCAE grades should be used. A copy  of the CTCAE can be downloaded fro m the Cancer 
Therapy  Evaluat ion Program website (http://ctep.cancer.gov). T he applicable versio n of CTCAE 
shoul d be described clearly .
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs. Severit y is a measure of intensit y 
whereas seriousness is defined by  [CONTACT_244986] B 2. An AE of severe intensit y need 
not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but not an SAE unless it me ets the cri teria shown in Appendix
 B 2. On 
the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disabilit y may be considered a 
mild str oke but would be an SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix
 B 2.
B 7 A guide to interpreting the causality question
When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the foll owing f actors when deciding if there is 
a “reasonable possibilit y”that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the patient actually received the suspect dru g? 
Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of the suspect 
drug?
Consistency wit h known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge 
of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the sa me pharmaco logical 
class? Or coul d the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical properti es?
De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_688249]?
No al ternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably exp lained by [CONTACT_33154], other drugs, other host, or environmental factors.
Re-challenge experi ence. Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally reco mmend or support a re-
challenge .
Laboratory  tests. A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Is this a recogni zedfeature of overdose of the drug?
Is there a known mechanism?

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 113 (149 )Causalit y of “related” is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
“reasonable possibilit y” of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expressio n 
“reasonable possibilit y” of a causal relati onship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough information 
to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient informat ion in the case, it is likely 
that the event(s) will be assessed as “not related.”
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of effect 
shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.
B 8 Medication error , Drug Abuse, and Drug Misuse
Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an IP or [COMPANY_008] NIP that either causes harm to the patient or ha s 
the potenti al to cause harm  to the pati ent.
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy o f the drug, but rather a human or process -related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staff or pati ent.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error:
Occurred
Was identified and intercepted before the patient received the drug
Did not occur, but circumstances were recognized that could have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name [CONTACT_33165] n
Dispensing error , eg, medicat ion prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to the 
patient
Drug not administered as indicated, eg, wrong route or wrong site of administration
Drug not taken as indicated, eg, tablet disso lved in water when it shoul d be taken as a solid 
tablet
Drug not stored as instructed ,eg, kept in the refrigerator when it shoul d be at room  
temperature
Wrong patient received the medication (excluding IRT/RTSM errors)
Wrong drug administered to patient (excluding IRT/RTSM errors)
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 114 (149 )Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
Errors related to or resulting fro m IRT/RTSM -including those which lead to one of the 
above listed events that would otherwise have been a medicatio n error
Patient acci dentally  missed drug dose(s) , eg, forgot to take medicat ion
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
Patient failed to return unused medicat ion or em pty packaging
Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may  occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error.
Drug Abuse
For the purpose of this study , drug abuse is defined as the persistent or sporadic intent ional, 
non-therapeut ic excessive use of IP or [COMPANY_008] NIP for a perceived reward or desired 
non-therapeut ic effect.
Any events of drug abuse, with or without associated AEs, are to be captured and forwarded to 
the data entry site using the Drug Abuse Report Form. This form should be used both if the drug 
abuse happened in a study  patient or if the drug abuse inv olves a person not enrolled in the study  
(such as a relative o f the study  patient ).
Examples of drug abuse include but are not limited to:
The drug is used with the intent of getting a perceived reward (by [CONTACT_588106] a 
person not enrolled in the study )
The drug in the form o f a tabl et is crushed and injected or snorted with the intent of getting 
high
Drug Misuse
Drug misuse is the intent ional and inappropriate use (by  a study  patient) of IP or [COMPANY_008] 
NIP for m edicinal purposes outside of th e authori sed product informat ion, or for unauthorised 
IPs or [COMPANY_008] NIPs, outside the intended use as specified in the protocol and includes 
deliberate administration o f the product by  [CONTACT_244972].
Events of drug misuse, with or without associated AEs, are to be captured and forwarded to the 
data entry  siteusing the Drug Mi suse Report Form. This form should be used both if the drug 
misuse happened in a study  patientor if the drug misuse regards a person not enrolled in the 
study  (such as a rel ative of the study  patient ).
Examples of drug misuse include but are not limited to:
The drug is used with the intent ion to cause an effect in another person

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 115 (149 )The drug is so ld to other people for recreational pu rposes 
The drug is used to facilitate assault in another person
The drug is deliberately administered by [CONTACT_244972]
The drug is split in half because it is easier to swallow, when it is stated in the protocol that 
it must be swallowed whole
Only half the dose is taken because the study  patientfeels that he/she is feeling better when 
not taking the whole dose
Someone who i s not enrolled in the study  intentionally  takes the drug

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 123 (149 )Appendix EActions required in cases of increases in liver biochemistry and 
evaluation of Hy’s Law
E 1 Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately report 
Potenti al Hy’s Law (PHL) cases and Hy’s Law (HL) cases. It is not intended to be a 
comprehensive gui de to the m anagement of el evated liver biochemistries. Specific guidance on 
managing liver abnormalit ies can be found in the Dosing Modificat ion and Toxi city 
Management Guidelines (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
During the course of the study  the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry . The Investi gator i s responsible for determining whether a patient meets PHL 
criteria at any  point during the study .
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL and HL events; this 
includes samples taken at scheduled study  visit s and other visits including cent ral and all l ocal 
laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study  visits; for exam ple, PHL cri teria 
could be m et by  [CONTACT_96724]  a central  laboratory  and/or elevated TBL from  a local 
laboratory .
The Investigator will also review AE da ta (for example, for AEs that may  indicate el evati ons in 
liver biochemistry ) for possible PHL events.
The Investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing PHL criteria to agree whether HL criteria are met. HL 
criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanation for the elevat ions in liver biochemistry  other 
than drug induced liver injury (DILI) caused by [CONTACT_33249].
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting 
AEs and SAEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line wit h standard 
safet y reporting processes.
E 2 Definitions
Potential Hy’s law
AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 × ULN at any po int during the stu dy following 
the start of study  medicat ionirrespect ive of an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP).
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 124 (149 )Hy’s Law
AST or ALT ≥ 3× ULN together with TBL ≥ 2× ULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IP, can be found to explain the co mbinat ion of increases, eg, el evated ALP indicat ing cho lestasis, 
viral hepat itis, another drug.
For PHL and HL,the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specified time frame wit hin which the ele vations 
in transaminases and TBL must occur.
E 3 Identification of potential Hy’s law cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory  
data for any  patient who meets any  of the f ollowing identificat ion criteria in iso lation or in 
combinat ion:
ALT ≥ 3×ULN
AST ≥ 3×ULN
TBL ≥ 2×ULN
The Investigator will wit hout delay review each new laboratory  report and if the ident ificat ion 
criteria are met will :
Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative
Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Appendix E 2for definit ion) by 
[CONTACT_33156]
Prom ptlyenter the laboratory  data into the l aboratory  CRF
E
4 Follow -up
E4.1 Potential Hy’s law criteria not met
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
Inform  the [COMPANY_008] representative that the subject has not met PHL criteria
Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance provided in 
the Clinical Study  Protocol  (CSP).
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvaluma b, D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 125 (149 )E4.2 Potential Hy’s law criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any study  visit prior to starting study  treatm ent 
(see Appendix E 6).
Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study  Team
Within [ADDRESS_1191418] igator will report the case as an SAE of 
PHL (meet ing serious criteria for “important medical event”) with causalit y assessment 
“yes/related” according to CSP process for SAE reporting
For pati ents that m et PHL cri teria prior to starting study  treatm ent, the Invest igator is not 
requi red to submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change# in the patient’s condit ion
The Study  Physician will contact [CONTACT_855231], discuss, and agre e on 
an approach for the study  patients’ follow-up (including any  further laboratory  testing) and 
the continuous review o f data
Subsequent to this contact [CONTACT_73016]:
Moni tor the pati ent until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinic al 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated
Com plete the follow -
up SAE Form as required
Invest igate the etio logy of the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as discussed 
with the Study  Physician
Com plete the 3 Liver eCRF Modules as informat ion beco mes available
#A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condit ion refers to a clinically  relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry  parameters (ALT, AST, or TBL) in isolat ion or in 
combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms. The determinat ion of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discret ion of the Invest igator, this 
may be in consultat ion with the Study  Physician if there is any uncert ainty.
E 5 Review and assessment of potential Hy’s law cases
The instructions in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all  cases where PHL cri teria are m et.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y is initially detected, the Study  Physician
will contact [CONTACT_855232], 
and to ensure timely  analysis and reporting to health authorit ies within [ADDRESS_1191419] matter experts as 
appropriate.
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 126 (149 )According to the outcome of the r eview and assessment, the Invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a 
determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an SAE: update the previously  submi tted PHL SAE eCRF 
accordingly with the new informat ion (reassessing event term; causalit y and seri ousness 
criteria) fo llowing the AZ standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the study  treatm ent:
Send updat ed SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AZ standard processes.
The “important medical event” serious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria apply.
As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘relate d’ should be assigned.
If, there i s an unavo idable delay of over [ADDRESS_1191420] igator will fo llow the instructi ons bel ow:
Provi de any further update to the previously  submitted SAE of PHL (report term now ‘Hy’s 
Law case’), ensuring causalit y assessment i s related to stud y treatm ent and seri ousness 
criteria i s medically  important, according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary  supplementary  
inform ation is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to d etermine whether HL criteria 
are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report fo llowing CSP process for 
SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review and amending the reported term if an 
alternat ive explanat ion for the liver biochemist ry elevat ions is determined .
E 6 Actions required when potential Hy’s law criteria are met before 
and after starting study treatment
This sect ion is applicable to patients with liver metastases who meet PHL criteria on -study  
treatm ent having previously  met PH L cri teria at a study  visit prior to starti ng study  treatm ent.

Durvalumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 127 (149 )At the first on -study  treatm ent occurrence of PHL cri teria being met, the Invest igator will 
determine if there has been a significant change in the patient’s condit ion#compared wi th the 
last v isit where PHL cri teria were m et#.
If there is no significant change, no action is required
If there is a significant change, notify the [COMPANY_008] representative, who will inform the 
central  Study  Team , then foll ow the subsequent process described in Appendix E4.2.
#A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condit ion refers to a clinically  relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry  parameters (ALT, AST or TBL) in iso lation or in 
combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms. The determinat ion of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discret ion of the Invest igator, this 
may be in consultat ion with the Study  Physician if there is any uncertaint y.
E 7 Actions required for repeat epi[INVESTIGATOR_72921]’s law
This sect ion is applicable when a patient meets PHL criteria on- study  treatm ent, and has al ready 
met PHL criteria at a previous on-study  treatm ent visit.
The requi rement to conduct fo llow-up, revi ew, and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of PHL 
is based on the nature of the alternat ive cause identified for the previous occurrence.
The Investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being 
met and answer the fo llowing quest ion:
Was the alternat ive cause for the previous occurrence o f PHL cri teria being met found to be the 
disease under study  (eg, chroni c or progressing malignant disease, severe i nfect ion or liver 
disease), or di d the pati ent m eet PHL cri teria prior to starti ng study  treatment and at first 
on-study  treatm ent visi t, as described in Appendix E 6?
If No: Follow the process described in Appendix E4.2for reporting PHL as an SAE.
If Yes: Determine if there has been a signif icant change in the pat ient’s condit ion#compared 
with when PHL cri teria were previously  met.
If there is no significant change, no action is required
If there is a significant change, fo llow the process described in Appendix E4.2for reporting 
PHL as an SAE.
#A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condit ion refers to a clinically  relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry  parameters (ALT, AST or TBL) in iso lation or in 
combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms. The determinat ion of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discret ion of the Invest igator, this 
may be in consultat ionwith the Study  Physician if there is any uncertaint y.

assessment of tumor burden incl uding protocol -specific requirements for this study . Addi tional 
special guidance is provided for determinat ion of Confirmation o f Radiological Progressi on.
Definitions of measurable, nonmeasurable, target, and nontarget lesions
Measurable:
A lesio n that ca n be accurately measured at baseline as ≥ [ADDRESS_1191421] diameter (except 
lymph nodes which must have a short axis2diameter of ≥ 15 mm) wit h CT or MRI and which is 
suitable for accurate repeated measurements.
Nonmeasurable:
All other lesio ns, includi ng small lesio ns (lo ngest di ameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph 
nodes with ≥ 10 mm to < 15 mm short axis diameter at baseline3)
Truly nonmeasurable lesio ns include the fo llowing: bone l esions, l eptom eningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural/pericardial effusio n,inflammatory breast disease, lymphangit ic involvement 
of skin or l ung, and abdominal masses/ abdo minal organom egaly  identified by  [CONTACT_855233] (manual  palpat ion) that i s not m easurable by  [CONTACT_462]
Brain metastasis
Special cases:
Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic–blast ic lesio ns, with ident ifiable so ft tissue com ponents, 
can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the definit ion of 
measurabilit y. Blast ic lesio ns are considered nonmeasurable.
                                               
2The short axis is defined as the longest axis perpendicular to long axis
3Lymph n odes with < 10 mm short axis diameter are considered nonpathological and should not be recorded or 
followed as NTLs.
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 129 (149 )Cystic met astases can be consid ered m easurable l esions if they meet the criteria for 
measurabilit y from a radi ological  point of view, but if noncyst ic lesio ns are present in the 
same patient, these should be selected over cy stic lesions as TLs.
Target lesions:
A maximum of 5 measurable lesio ns (with a maximum o f 2 lesions per organ), representative of 
all lesions invo lved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be ident ified as TLs at 
baseline. Lymph nodes, in any location (local/regional and distant), are collect ively consid ered 
as a single organ, with a maximum of 2 lymph nodes as TLs. A bilateral organ (eg, adrenal 
glands), a segmented organ (eg, liver), or a mult ilobed organ (eg, lung) is each considered as a 
single organ.
A previously  irradiated l esion may be selected as a TL provi ded i t fulfills the criteria for 
reproducible measurabilit y and is the only  lesion available.
Tumor lesi ons selected for fresh screening biopsy should not be selected as TLs, unless imaging 
occurred at least ~2 weeks after biopsy , allowing time f or healing.
Nontarget lesions (NTLs):
Addit ional measurable lesio ns not recorded as TLs and nonmeasurable lesions (or sites of 
disease) shoul d be i dentified as NTLs at baseline.

Durvalumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 130 (149 )CT and MRI
CT and MRI, each preferably with IV contrast, are generally considered to generate the best 
currently available and reproducible anatomical images for measurement of TL, assessment of 
NTL, and i dentification o f any new lesio ns.
It is recommended that IV contrast -enhanced CT examinat ions of the chest and abdo men 
(including the ent ire liver and both adrenal glands) will be used to assess tumor burden at 
baseline and fo llow-up visi ts. Any other areas of disease invo lvement (eg, pelvis, brain) should 
be addit ionally imaged based on the signs and symptom s of individual pat ients. In pati ents who 
are sensit ive to intravenous CT contrast, a noncontrast CT examinat ion of the chest and an MRI 
with intravenous MRI contrast of the abdo men is appropriate. In patients with severely 
compromised renal funct ion, a noncontrast CT examinat ion of the chest and abdo men is 
appropriate. For brain lesio n assessment, MRI with IV contrast is the preferred method over IV 
contrast -enhanced CT. It is strongly reco mmended to maintain use of the same imaging modalit y 
(CT or MRI), acquisit ion protocol, facilit y, and scanner across all imaging time po ints per 
patient.
Clinical examination
Clinical examinat ion of skin/surface lesio ns (by  [CONTACT_73018]) will not 
be used for RECIST assessments. Tumors iden tified by [CONTACT_855234].
Chest X -ray
Chest X -ray assessment will not be used for assessment of TL. Chest X -ray can, however, be 
used to assess NTL and to ident ify the presence o f new lesio ns.
Plain X- ray
Plain X- ray may be used as a method of assessment for bone NTL and to identify the presence of 
new bone lesio ns.
Ultrasound
Ultrasound examinat ion will not be used for RECIST assessment of tumors as it is not a 
reproducible acquisit ion method (operator dependent), is subject ive in int erpretati on and m ay not 
provi de an accurate assessment of true tumor size. Tumors identified by [CONTACT_855235].
Endoscopy and laparoscopy
Endos copy  and l aparoscopy  will not be used for tumor assessments as they  are not validated in 
the context of tumor assessment.
Tumor markers
Tumor markers on cy tological  or histol ogical (biopsy ) samples will not be used for tumor 
response assessments as per REC IST 1.1.
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 131 (149 )Histology and cytology
Histology on tum or biopsy  samples will not be used as part of the tumor response assessment as 
per RECIST 1.1.
Results of cyto logical examinat ion for the neoplastic origin o f any effusi on (eg, asci tes, 
pericardial  effusi on, pleural  effusi on) that appears or worsens during the study  will not be used 
as part of the tumor response assessment in this study . An effusi on that appears or significant ly 
worsens (from trace to large) radio logically by  [CONTACT_4654]/MRI anatomical scans will be co nsidered to 
be disease progression due to new lesio ns or progressio n of NTLs, respect ively.
Isotopic bone scan
Bone l esions i dentified on an isotopic bone scan at baseline and confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], MRI, or X -ray 
at baseline should be recorded as NTL and fo llowed by [CONTACT_73020].
Isotopi c bone scans m ay be used as a method of assessment to ident ify the presence of new bone 
lesions at f ollow -up visi ts. New l esions may  be recorded in case posi tive hot -spots appear on a 
bone scan that w ere not present on a previous bone scan; however, a newly observed equivocal 
hot-spot on a bone scan which cannot be verified with correlat ive imaging (CT, MRI, X -ray) of 
the sam e anatomical region shall not be the only trigger for a PD assessment at that timepo int.
FDG -PET/CT
18F-Fluoro -deoxyglucose positron emissio n tom ography/CT (FDG -PET/CT) scans may be used 
as a m ethod for i dentifying new lesio ns, according to the following algorithm: New lesio ns will 
be recorded where there is posit ive FDG uptake4notpresent on baseline or prior FDG -PET scan 
or in a location corresponding to a new lesio n on CT/MRI at the same fo llow-up visi t. If there i s 
no baseline or prior FDG -PET scan available, and no evidence of new lesio ns on CT/MRI scans 
then follow-up CT/MRI a ssessments should be cont inued, scheduled as per protocol or clinical 
indicated, in order to verify new lesio ns.
At present, low dose or attenuation correction CT portions of a combined FDG -PET/CT scan are 
of limited use in anatomically- based efficacy asse ssments, and it is therefore suggested that they  
shoul d not subst itute for dedicated diagnostic contrast -enhanced CT scans for tumor 
                                               
4A positive FDG -PET scan lesion should be reported only when an uptake (eg, SUV) greater than twice that of the 
surrounding tissue or liver is observed.

perform ed, as part of a PET/CT ex aminat ion, is of ident ical diagnostic qualit y (with intravenous 
contrast) to a dedicated diagnostic CT scan, then the CT portion of the PET/CT can be used for 
RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1191423] introduces addit ional (PET) data that may bias an Invest igator if it is not routinely or 
serially perform ed.
Tumor response evaluation
Schedule of evaluation
The m ethods of assessment of tumor burden used at baseline CT/MRI scans of the chest and 
abdo men (including the ent ire liver and both adrenal glands) must be used at each subsequent 
follow-up assessment. Addit ional imaging may  be perform ed based on the signs and symptoms 
of the pati ent, eg, new l esions at f ollow -up.
Baseline assessments should be p erformed no m ore than [ADDRESS_1191424] 1.1 for all 
patients will  be assessed according to the schedules of activit ies. If an unscheduled assessment is 
perform ed, and the patient has not progressed, every  attem pt shoul d be made to perform  the 
subsequent assessments at their scheduled imaging visits.
Target lesions
Documentation of TLs
A maximum of 5 measurable lesio ns, with a maximum o f 2 lesions per orga n (including lymph 
nodes collect ively considered as a single organ), representative of all lesio ns involved should be 
ident ified as TL at baseline. Target lesio ns should be selected on the basis of their size (longest 
diameter for non -nodal  lesions or shor t axis diameter for nodal lesio ns), but i n addit ion shoul d be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on 
occasi on, the largest lesio n does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which 
circumstance the next largest lesio n that can be measured reproducibly should be selected.
The site and locat ion of each TL should be documented as well as the longest diameter for 
non-nodal  lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes). All measurements should be recorded i n 
millimeters. At baseline the sum o f the diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum o f diameters. At follow -up visits the sum of diameters for all TL will be calculated 
and reported as the fo llow-up sum  of diameters.
Special cases:
For TL measurable in [ADDRESS_1191425] diameter. For 
pathol ogical lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the short axis 
diameter.

Durvalumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 133 (149 )If the CT/MRI slice thickness used is > 5 mm, the minimum size of measurable disease at 
baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan.
If a lesio n has co mpletely disappeared, the diameter should be recorded as 0 mm. If a lesio n 
appears in the same location on a subsequent scan, it will be recorded as a New Lesion.
If a TL split s into [ADDRESS_1191426] the sum of the diameters of those parts.
If 2 or more TLs merge then the sum o f the diameters of the combined lesio n should be 
recorded for one of the lesio ns and 0 mm recorded for the other le sion(s).
If a TL i s believed to be present and is faint ly seen but too sm all to measure, a default value 
of 5 mm  shoul d be assi gned. If an accurate measure can be given, this should be recorded, 
even if it is below 5 mm.
If a TL cannot be measured accurate ly due to it being too large, provide an est imate of the 
size of the lesio n.
When a TL has had any intervent ion eg, definit ive radi otherapy , embo lization, surgery , etc 
during the study , the si ze of the TL should st ill be provi ded where possible and the 
intervent ion recorded in the RECIST case report form. If a TL has been co mpletely remo ved 
(surgery ), the l ongest di ameter should be recorded as 0 mm.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 134 (149 )Evaluation of target lesions
This sect ion provi des the definit ions of the criteria used to determine object ive tumor visit 
response for TL (see Table 15).
Table 15 Evaluation of target lesions
Complete response (CR) Disappearance of all TLs since baseline. Any pathological lymph 
nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis diameter 
to < 10 mm.
Partial response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of TL, taking 
as reference the baseline sum of diameter s.
Stable disease (SD) Neither sufficient decrease in sum of diameters to qualify for PR 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.
Progression of disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as 
reference the smallest previous sum of diameters (nadir) –this 
includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on -study. In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm from nadir.
Not evaluable (NE) Only relev ant if any of the TLs at follow -up were not assessed or 
not evaluable (eg missing anatomy) or had a lesion intervention at 
this visit. Note: if the sum of diameters meets the progressive 
disease criteria, progressive disease overrides not evaluable as a TL
response.
CR = Complete response; NE = Not Evaluable; PR = Partial response; PD = Progression of disease; SD = Stable 
disease; TL = Target lesion.
Nontarget lesions
Evaluation of NTLs
All other lesio ns (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should be ident ified as NTL at baseline. 
Measurements are not required for these lesions, but their status should be fo llowed at 
subsequent visits. At each visit an overall assessment of the NTL re sponse should be recorded by 
[CONTACT_24342]. This section provides the definit ions of the criteria used to determine and record 
overall response for NTL at the invest igational site at each visit (see Table 16).
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 135 (149 )Table 16 Evaluation of nontarget lesions
Complete response (CR) Disappearance of all NTLs since baseline. All lymph nodes must 
be nonpathological in size ( < 10 mm shor t axis).
NonCR/nonPD Persistence of one or more NTL.
Progression of disease (PD) Unequivocal progression of existing NTLs. Unequivocal 
progr ession may be due to an important progression in one lesion 
only or in several lesions. In all cases the progression MUST be 
clinically significant for the physician to consider changing (or 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) therapy.
Not evaluable (NE) Only relevant when one or some of the NTLs were not assessed 
and, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], they are not able to provide an 
evaluable overall NTL assessment at this visit.
Note: for patients without TLs at baseline, this is relevant if any of 
the NTLs were not assessed at this visit and the progression 
criteria have not been met.
CR = Complete response; NE = Not Evaluable; NTL = Nontarget lesion; PR = Partial response; PD = Progression of 
disease; TL = Target lesion.
To achieve “unequivocal progression” on the basis of NTLs, there must be an overall level of 
substant ial worsening in nontarget disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in TLs, the 
overall tumor burden has increased sufficient ly to merit discontinuat ion of therapy . A modest 
increase in the size of one or more NTLs is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal 
progression status.
New lesions
Details o f any new lesio ns will also be recorded with the date of assessment. The presence of one 
or more new l esions is assessed as progression. The finding of a new lesio n should be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in im aging 
modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor. If a new lesio n is 
equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumor assessments should be 
continued until the previously new lesio n has been assessed as u nequivocal and then the 
progression date should be declared using the date of the init ial scan when the new lesio n first 
appeared.
A lesio n identified at a follow -up assessment in an anatomical locat ion that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesio n and will indicate disease progression.
Symptomatic deterioration
Symptom atic (clinical) deterioration is not a descriptor of an object ive response: it is a reason for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_45806] .

disease.
Confirmation of Radiological Progression
A follow-up scan is collected after the init ial RECIST 1.1 -defined PD, preferably at the next (and 
no later than the next) scheduled imaging visit, and no less than [ADDRESS_1191427] igator and patient 
(following consultat ion with [COMPANY_008]) can receive treatment until no longer having clin ical 
benefit, and will cont inue to have tumor assessments on their regular imaging schedule for the 
durati on of  treatm ent.
Confirmation o f Radiological Progressi on gui delines are set for the following reasons:
For pati ent management and treatment decisio ns
In the absence of significant clinical deterioration, to promote the collect ion of addit ional 
scans after the first radio logic RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1191428] inguish

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 137 (149 )Confirmation of Radiolo gical Progression criteria:
An immediate prior RECIST 1.1 -defined radio logic PD would be considered confirmed if any o f 
the following cri teria are m et in the subsequent follow -up scan (acquired preferably at the next 
regul arly scheduled imaging visit but n o sooner than [ADDRESS_1191429] 1.1 -defined PD 
scan):
 ≥ 20% i ncrease in the sum diameters of TLs co mpared wi th the nadir at [ADDRESS_1191430] 5 mm in sum of diameters compared to nadir (as 
per RECIST 1 .1 definit ion)
and/or significant progressi on (worsening) of NTLs at the fo llow-up scan timepo int 
compared wi th the immediate pri or timepoint (as per RECIST 1.1 definit ion)
and/or significant progressi on (worsening) of pre -exist ing new lesio ns at the fo llow-up scan 
timepo int compared wit h the immediate prior timepoint (unique definit ion)
and/or additional (brand) new unequivocal lesio ns at the fo llow-up scan timepo int (as per 
RECIST 1.1 definit ion)
NOTE: In order to have confirmed radio logical  progressi on,there should be 2 consecut ive 
assessments meet ing the PD definit ion: the first PD by  [CONTACT_393] 1.1 and the second PD using the 
Confirmation o f Radiological Progressi on cri teria (above). If the first assessment fulfilling the 
PD definit ion by [CONTACT_393] 1.[ADDRESS_1191431] PD (by [CONTACT_393] 1.1) is not confirmed by [CONTACT_855236], then the Investigator should not change the PD assessment of the first scan.
Specifications for anatomical imaging
These notes are recommendations for use in clinical studies. The use of standardized protocols 
for CT and MRI allows co mparabilit y both within and between different studies, irrespect ive of 
where the examinat ion has been undertaken.
CT scan
CT scans of the chest and abdo men (and pelvis when indicated) should be cont iguous throughout 
all the anatomic region o f interest.
The m ost cri tical CT image acquisit ion parameters for optimal tumor evaluat ion using 
RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1191432] administration, slice thickness, and reconstruction 
interval.
a.Anatomic coverage: Optimal anatomic coverage for most solid tumors is the chest, abdomen, 
and pelvis. Coverage should enco mpass all areas of known predilection for metastases in the 
disease under evaluation and should addit ionally investigate areas that may  be inv olved based on 
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab , D4194C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 138 (149 )signs and symptoms of individual patients. Because a lesio n later identified in a body part not 
scanned at baseline would be considered as a new lesio n represent ing disease progression, 
careful considerat ion should be given to the extent of imaging coverage at baseline and at 
subsequent fo llow-up time points. This will enable better consistency not only  of tumor 
measurements but also ident ification o f new disease.
b.IV contrast administration : Optimal visualizatio n and m easurement of m etasta ses in so lid 
tumors requi res consistent administration (dose and rate) of IV contrast as well as timing of 
scanning. Ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_897], m ost abdominal imaging is performed during the portal venous phase and 
(optimally) about the sam e time frame after inject ion on each examinat ion. An adequate vo lume 
of a sui table contrast agent should be given so that the metastases are demonstrated to best effect 
and a consistent method is used on subsequent examinat ions for any  given pat ient. It is very  
important that the same te chnique be used at baseline and on follow -up examinat ions for a given 
patient. For pati ents who develop contraindicat ions to con trast after baseline contrast CT is done, 
the deci sion as to whether noncontrast CT or MRI (enhanced or nonenhanced) should be 
perform ed shoul d also be based on the tumor ty pe, anatomic location of the disease and should 
be optimized to allow for comparison to the prior studies if possible. Each case should be 
discussed wi th the radi ologist to determine if substitut ion of these oth er approaches is possible 
and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable fro m that point forward. Care must be 
taken in measurement of TLs on a different modality  and interpretation of nontarget disease or 
new lesio ns, since the same lesio n may appear to have a different size using a new modalit y. 
Oral contrast i s recommended to help visualize and differentiate structures in the abdo men.
If iodine contrast m edia is medically  contraindicated at baseline or at any  time during the course 
of the st udy then the recommended methods are: CT thoracic (chest) examinat ion without 
contrast and abdominal (and pelvis) MRI with contrast. If MRI cannot be performed then CT 
without IV contrast is an option for the thorax and abdo men (and pelvis) examinat ion.For brain 
imaging, MRI with IV con trast i s the preferred method.
c. Slice thickness and reconstruction interval: It is recommended that CT scans be performed 
at 5mm conti guous slice thi ckness and this guideline presumes a maximum [ADDRESS_1191433] itutions may  
perform  medically  acceptable scans at slice thicknesses greater than 5 mm. If this occurs, the 
minimum size of measurable lesio ns at baseline should be twice the slice thic kness of the 
baseline scans.
All window settings should be included in the assessment, particularly in the thorax where lung 
and so ft tissue windows should be considered. When measuring lesio ns, the TL should be 
measured on the same window setting for repe ated examinat ions throughout the study . All 
images from each examinat ion shoul d be included in the assessment and not “selected” images 
of the apparent lesio n.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 139 (149 )MRI scan
MRI has excellent contrast, spatial and temporal resolut ion; however, there are many  image 
acquisit ion variables invo lved in MRI, which greatly impact image qualit y, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_72922] y 
and measurement. Furthermore, the availabilit y of MRI i s variable gl obally. The m odali ty used 
at follow -up shoul d be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions shoul d be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. Generally, axial imaging of the abdo men and 
pelvis (and other anatomies [eg, neck]) with T1 and T2 weighted imaging alo ng with 
gadolinium -enhanced imaging can be performed. The field of view, matrix, number of 
excitat ions, phase encoding steps, use of fat suppressio n and fast sequences should be optimized 
for the specific body  part being imaged as well as the scanner utilized. CT of the chest is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_710414] (heart, m ajor blood vessels, 
breathing) associated with MRI. It is beyo nd the scope of this appendix to prescribe specific MRI 
pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body  parts, and di seases. Ideally, the same ty pe of 
scanner should be used and the image acquisit ion protocol  shoul d be f ollowed as closely  as 
possible to prior scans. Body  scans shoul d be perform ed wi th breath -hold scanning techniques if 
possible.
For these reasons, CT is the imaging modalit y of choi ce.

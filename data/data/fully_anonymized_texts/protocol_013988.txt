Chad Porter, PhD, MPH; Milton Maciel, PhD ; Paige Waterman,  MD; Alison Lane, MD , MS ; 
Mark Riddle, MD, DrPH ; Melinda Hamer, MD , MPH   
Study Duration (per group ): 
Screening (up to 90 days); Vaccination to final blood 
draw (70 days); long term follow -up (12 months);  
immunology analysis (12 weeks); data analysis and 
report writing (2 months).    Phase of development: 1 
 
Trial Objectives:  
Primary Objective:  
 Evaluate the safety of CssBA ± dmLT given by [CONTACT_782965]:  
 Evaluate immune responses following IM vaccination with CssBA ±  dmLT   
 Identify a safe and immunogenic dose and route of a CssBA -based vaccine to be used 
in a subsequent vaccin ation/challenge trial  
Study Design and Methodology:  
This is an open -label, Phase 1 clinical trial in which a total of 50 subjects will receive three 
injections of either CssBA alone, dmLT alone  or CssBA + dmLT. The vaccine will be 
administered via IM injection to alternating deltoid regions on days 1, [ADDRESS_1076661]  vaccination of the previous group .  
 
Study Design for a Phase 1 clinical trial of intramuscularly administered CssBA 
with/without dmLT  (N=50)

*Plan to proceed with 500ng dose; however, if there is an aberrant safety signal in Group  C, 
will proceed with the 100  ng dose (presuming no prior signal in Group  B) 
Blood, saliva, and stool specimens will be collected at prescribed intervals to examine 
systemic and mucosal immune responses. Vaccine safety will be actively monitored during 
vaccination and for [ADDRESS_1076662] vaccination. All safety data will be summarized and reviewed by 
[CONTACT_7244] ( SRC ) prior to dose -escalation.  
Estimat ed Numb er of Subjects Screened:  
Based on prior studies with similar study designs, sample collections and inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, we anticipate screening approximately [ADDRESS_1076663] that is 
enrolled in the study.  Therefore we anticipate approximately 250 individuals will be 
screened.  
Maximum Number of Subjects Enrolled:  
A maximum of [ADDRESS_1076664].

CssBA Phase 1 Protocol    
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  8 The investigational products are CssBA  and dmLT.  The initial group  will assess the safety 
of the products independently with CssBA and dmLT alone.  
Following the initial group , escalating doses of CssBA (5µg, 15 µg, 45 µg) will be given 
with escalating  doses of dmLT ( 100 ng  or 500ng ). All subjects will receive [ADDRESS_1076669] 3 weeks apart (study days 1, 22, and 4 3). The dose of dmLT  in 
Group s D and E will be determined from the s afety data from  previous group s. 
Duration of Treatment:  
Subjects will receive 3 vaccine doses, each 3 weeks apart (study days 1, 22, and 4 3). In 
person follow up will continue for [ADDRESS_1076670] vaccine dose.  
Immunology : 
Primary Immunogenicity:  
 Serum samples will be assayed for anti body titers against LT and CS6.  
 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) will also be collected to determine 
Antibodies from Lymphocyte Supernatant (ALS) responses to CS6 and LT.  
Exploratory Immunogenicity:  
 Saliva and stool samples will also be collected to assess for secretory IgA responses  
to CS6 and LT.  
 Samples will be collected as outlined in the time and events schedule. In order to support 
additional future exploratory evaluations in systems biology, cells and serum samples 
will be collected for use in a variety of transcriptomic, proteomic, flow cytometry, 
memory B cells, and cytokine analysis. Any testing of samples for these exploratory 
outcomes will be performed unde r a modification to this protocol to further detail the 
assay(s) or performed under a separate research protocol.  
Statistical methods:  
With the early stage of the product concept/testing, t he sample size for this study is designed 
to evaluate preliminary safety data but not designed to show statistically significant 
differences between groups.  Initially, a small number of subjects (n=5) will receive CssBA 
and dmLT independently at the lowest tested dose s.  The small number of subjects in each of 
these gro ups is designed to minimize the risk of acute toxicity in this first -in-human study.  
Subsequent groups are planned with larger sizes ( 10 per group) for the purpose of safety and 
immunogenicity evaluation.   
 
Rates of all adverse events will be analyzed by  [CONTACT_141612]’s Chi -square test (or Fisher’s exact 
test if assumptions are not met for Pearson’s Chi -square) to compare dose levels. Summary 
tables will be created which will indicate the number of subjects who experienced events. 
Vaccine -related events will be  tabulated by [CONTACT_2060]. In addition, tables will be prepared 
to list each adverse event, the number of subjects in each treatment group who experienced 
an event at least once, and the rate of subjects with adverse event(s). Adverse events will be 
divide d into defined severity grades (mild, moderate, and severe). The tables will also divide 
the adverse events by [CONTACT_782967]. All immunized 
subjects will be included in the safety analysis.  
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol    
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  9 For immune responses, b oth qualitative and quantitative (log10 transformed values  for non -
normally distributed samples ) results will be analyzed. Geometric mean titers may be 
calculated along with their 95% confidence intervals. An immunological responder will be 
defined as those subjects with a ≥4 fold rise in reciprocal baseline titer . Between groups 
comparisons may be examined with nonparametric tests (Kruskal -Wallis for continuous data 
and Fisher’s exact test for categorical data) unless assumptions are fulfilled for Stud ent’s t or 
χ2.  
Additional comparisons may include  repeated measures analysis of variance with study 
group as the between subject factor and sample collection time -points as the repeated factor. 
Only subjects who receive at least 2 vaccine doses will be in cluded in the immunology 
analysis. All statistical tests will be interpreted in a two -tailed fashion using an alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_1076671] OF ABBREVIATION S AND DEFINITIONS OF  TERMS ............................. 15

Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  18 5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background  
5.1.1.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_782926], diarrhea causes approximately 1.7 billion cases annually [1]. In developi[INVESTIGATOR_18504], there is recognition of the disease burden and in many cases , significant effor ts have 
been made to improve sanitation, nutrition, and treatment management. However, diarrhea 
related complications still result in approximately 760,[ADDRESS_1076679] numbers in those younger than two years of life  [1, 2] .  The recognized need for more 
early effective countermeasures has driven a number of  research agendas, including the 
development of enteric vaccines.  
ETEC, one of several pathotypes of diarrheagenic E. coli , causes a secretory diarrhea that can 
range in presentation from mild discomfort to cholera -like purging. It is the most prevalent 
bacterial cause of childhood diarrhea in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696], and while the estimated number of 
ETEC epi[INVESTIGATOR_782927] , in one estimate, ETEC was thought to cause 210 
million cases of diarrhea and 380,000 deaths annually among infants a nd young children  [3-7]. 
ETEC illness in the young has also been associated with growth faltering [8], and the re peated 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_782928] [9], which in turn are considered to h ave attendant macroeconomic consequences in 
countries and regions most heavily afflicted [10]. It is also the leading cause of travelers' 
diarrhea, etiologically implicated in 30 -50% or more of cases [11-14], and this may be markedly 
underestimated due to the insensitivity of testing methods [15]. Its dual importance in global 
public health and military/travel medicine has galvanized policy makers in both sectors to 
develop a safe, effective ETEC vaccine, though such efforts remain under -resourced.  
5.1.2.  CS6 Study Rational e 
ETEC express adhesive fimbriae [also known as colonization factors (CFs) ], surface -exposed 
polymeric protein appendages that plays a vital role in the initial step of ETEC pathogenesis. CFs 
mediate initial ETEC adherence to, and colonization of, the small intestine, after which ETEC 
secrete one or both of two enterotoxins that induce fluid and electrolyte secretion resulting in 
watery diarrhea. The two enterotoxins produced by [CONTACT_615743] -stable enterotoxin (ST) and 
heat-labile enterotoxin (LT). CFs have long been a prime target for va ccine research and 
development. Their role as protective antigens has been substantiated by a number of studies in 
populations naturally exposed to ETEC diarrhea as well as volunteer studies of experimentally 
induced diarrhea, as has the role of LT enterot oxin [16-20]. Evidence for the preventive role of 
anti-CF immunity also derives from studies showing that bovine milk antibody product with high 
antibody tit ers against ETEC, and more specifically, purified colonization factor antigens, 
provided protection to humans in challenge studies  [21, 22] . To date, more than twenty -two 
serologically distinct CFs have been i dentified.  
CS6 is an atypi[INVESTIGATOR_782929] g ETEC disease isolates from 
various geographic regions  [20, 23, 24] .  It is a heteropolymer composed of two structural 
subunits, CssA and CssB, in a ca. 1:1 ratio that has been confirmed with pub lication of the CssA 
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol    
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  19 and CssB crystal structures  [25]. Recent reports provide e vidence that CS6 binds to the human 
intestinal cell lines Caco -2 and INT407 [26, 27] , consistent with the adhesive role that CS6 is 
presumed to play in ETEC disease pathogenesis. Jansson et al. reported that purified CS6 and 
recombinant CssB fused to glutathione -S-transferase (GST) were both shown to bind to  intestinal 
glycosphingolipid sulfatide by [CONTACT_782968] [28]. 
Given the  relatively high global prevalence of CS6 -ETEC, we view the development of a 
protective, recombinant derivative of CS6 as critical to our overall strategy to develop a broadly 
protective multivalent ETEC adhesin  subunit vaccine. As such, with the current data known, 
development of the prototype CS6 adhesin -based vaccine began with the development and 
characterization of in cis  donor strand complemented variants of CssA (dsc16CssA[His]6, 
referred to as dscCssA) an d CssB (dsc16CssB[His]6, referred to as dscCssB).  Based on multiple 
lines of evidence, ntd14dsc16BCssBA (a variant of the original dscCssBA in which the N -
terminal [ADDRESS_1076680] been removed and a heterologous CssB -derived donor strand is 
used to complement the C -terminal CssA) , here after termed CssBA , was selected as the lead 
vaccine prototype. This product was assessed serially in a mouse immunogenicity model and an 
A. nancymaae  NHP vaccination -challenge model.  We then scaled up fermentation and 
purification processes, in preparation for bioproduction under cGMP conditions.  Subsequent 
mouse immunogenicity studies of the cGMP CssBA lot demonstrated similar anti -CS6 IgG 
response to that of the research grade lot.

5.2.1.  Mouse Study 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Immunogenicity of CssBA in Mice  
In Balb/C mice, CssBA (research grade) elicited strong IgG and IgA anti -CS6 serum titers after 
intradermal (ID) vaccination (admixed with mLT adjuvant), at levels that were similar or greater 
in magnitude compared to any of the other heterodimers. Three IN immunizations with 125 or 25 
µg of CssBA elicited levels of serum anti -CS6 Abs at day 42 comparable to the ID immunization 
with the same protein at 10 µg (see Table 3). A dose dependent drop in the levels of serum anti -
CS6 IgG and IgA Abs was observed when IN immunizations were performed with 2.5 and 0.25 
µg of CssBA. Similar patt erns were observed with sera collected on day 28, after two 
immunizations (data not shown).

Following the mouse study , the vaccine  (research grade)  was tested in owl monkeys ( A.

plus dmLT or dmLT alone, while negative control monkeys  were inoculated with P BS on days 0, 
14, 28, and 84 . There were eight monkeys per group. The products were dosed: CssBA 100µg, 
dmLT 100ng, and CS6 100µg.   Animals vaccinated with CssBA or CS6 dem onstrated high 
serum anti -CS6 IgA and IgG titers following the second vaccination, which remained high 
following the third and fourth vaccinations.  All animals that received dmLT demonstrated high 
serum anti-dmLT IgA and IgG titers following the second va ccination.  Following vaccination, 
the monkeys were challenged on study day 98 (two weeks after last vaccination dose) with a CS6 
expressing, LT+ ETEC strain (B7A) . Monkeys vaccinated with CssBA and dmLT demonstrated 
100% protective efficacy, whereas vacci nation with CS6 and dmLT provided 80% protective 
efficacy. Monkeys vaccinated with dmLT alone demonstrated a 40% protective efficacy , 
although this result was not statistically significant  (see Table 4).

[IP_ADDRESS].  Brief Summary  
A repeat dose GLP -compliant  toxicology study was performed in Sprague -Dawley rats  to assess  
the toxicity and local site reactogenicity of subunit ETEC vaccine candidates, CssBA and dmLT 
by [CONTACT_52596] . The study also included investigation of the ID route of administration and with 
addition of SLA -SE via IM injection, although the ID route and SLA -SE will not be evaluated in 
this protocol. This study was conducted in compliance with GLP at Sinclair Research in 
Auxvasse, Missouri.

a Saline Control Group  
Animals were immunized a total of four times, by [CONTACT_782969] 5, with 
each dose administered three weeks apart on Study  Days 1, 22, 43, and 64. Animals assigned to 
the main study cohort were sacrificed on Study Day 66, two days after the fourth and final 
vaccination. A second cohort of animals, designated as recovery, went through a [ADDRESS_1076682] -dose, ophthalmology, detailed physicals, and daily clinical 
observations. Injection sites were evalu ated and scored, according to a modified Draize (1965) 
method, daily at 24, 48, and 72 hours for all animals following each dose. If a positive score 
(> 0) was observed for an individual animal at [ADDRESS_1076683] dose, that animal’s dose site was 
evaluated d aily until a score of zero for both erythema and edema was achieved. Injection sites 
were also evaluated daily as part of the clinical observations and included an evaluation of 
apparent pain and other signs of local tolerance or toxicity issues such as pr esence of a 
hematoma, ulceration, vesiculation, or eschar.  
To avoid sampling effects on hematology parameters, animals were assigned for evaluation of 
hematology, coagulation, or clinical chemistry during the in -life phase on Study Day 3 (all 
parameters) and Study Day 7 (coagulation and chemistry only). All parameters were evaluated 
on all animals at baseline and at sacrifice. Immunology was conducted to evaluate anti -CS6 and 
anti-LT serum IgG at baseline and at sacrifice.  
At each sacrifice the assigned a nimals underwent a full gross necropsy, including organ weights, 
and tissues were collected. Microscopic examination of all tissues was conducted on animals 
sacrificed on Study Day 66. Only injection sites and gross lesions (none present) were evaluated 
from animals sacrificed on Study Day 92.  
 
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol    
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  22 [IP_ADDRESS].  Results  
There were no significant effects on ophthalmology, body weight gains, food consumption, or 
body temperatures. Test article related changes in hematology, coagulation parameters, and 
clinical chemistry were observed, including increases in platelet count, fibrinogen, and increases 
of the globulin fraction of serum total protein. These findings were consistent with an acute 
inflammatory or immune -stimulatory effect of vaccination, short -lived, and non -adverse. 
Systemically, vaccination with CssBA and dmLT wa s well -tolerated and immunogenic. Test 
article related clinical findings were limited to the injection site.  
IM co -administration of [ADDRESS_1076684] injection. At 
subsequent doses the severity of this finding was substantially reduced. Erythema was minimal 
to moderate at the injection site. The incidence and severity of dose -site in -life findings in 
animals treated with saline (Group  4) or 45 µg CssBA and 0.5 µg dmLT (Group 5) is 
summarized in Table 6.

No manifestations of gross toxicity at the injection site such as hematoma, vesiculation, or ulcers 
were observed at this dose and route.  
At necropsy on Day 66, there were no gross observations noted for this treatment group nor 
differences in organ weights, either absolute or relative to body or brain weight. Microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 
hyperplasia of the inguinal lymph node was observed in some anima ls, consistent with a post -
vaccination response. Injection site observations included minimal to mild inflammation of 
skeletal muscle and subcutis at all four injection sites, although at a higher incidence in the left 
biceps femoris (second dose; Day 22) and left gluteus (fourth dose, Day 64).  Following a [ADDRESS_1076685] dose. Changes in clinical pathology parameters associ ated with inflammation 
such as fibrinogen, platelet increases, changes in clotting time, and increase in the globulin 
fraction were higher in this group, consistent with the dose site clinical findings. As a result, the 
clinical trial design was modified t o escalate to the 0.5 µg dmLT dose level and not exceed that 
dose.  
Addition of SLA -SE, regardless of the dose of dmLT (0.5 or 1 µg), via IM injection led to severe 
edema and limb swelling in 100% of vaccinated animals after the first dose. Animals in thes e 
groups (Groups 6 and 8) also exhibited apparent pain upon palpation of the dose site following 
the first dose; six animals were observed limpi[INVESTIGATOR_782930] . Pain was also obser ved following the fourth dose. The 
incidence and severity overall decreased for these groups over the course of the study, but some 
severe edema and limb swelling was still observed after the fourth dose. Microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 
minimal to marked inflammation of the skeletal muscle, subcutis, and/or dermis was observed at 
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol    
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  24 the injection sites as well as hematoma, fibrin exudation, and subcutaneous edema. Severity and 
incidence was higher at dose sites 2 (left biceps femoris) and 4 (left gluteus), suggesting that th e 
inflammatory response is more regional and related to the local draining lymph node. These 
findings are consistent with vascular damage related to reactogenicity . Due to the severity of 
local effects and microscopic findings, the clinical trial design wa s modified to not include SLA -
SE adjuvant.  
By [CONTACT_782970], 45 µg CssBA was well -tolerated. Local site observations were similar to that 
seen in the saline ID route control animals (Group 1). Mild and transient changes in hematology, 
coagulation, and clini cal chemistry were observed, consistent with an immune -stimulatory effect 
of vaccination. There were few test -article related findings microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897], with just minimal 
residual inflammation observed at the injection site. Serum IgG anti -CS6 responses wer e low, 
even after four doses. All females, but not all males, seroconverted by [CONTACT_995] 92.  
When [ADDRESS_1076686] 
was observed. As the study progressed, dose site reactogenicity, specifical ly erythema, was 
substantially increased in all animals assigned to this treatment group. By [CONTACT_782971] 25 of 30 animals were observed with an eschar at the injection site and were determined to 
exhibit apparent pain upon palpation of the in jection site. Hematoma was also observed in 21 of 
30 animals and ulcers were observed in 7 of 30 animals. Microscopic evaluation revealed 
hematoma, inflammation of the dermis, subcutis, and underlying muscle, and fibrin exudation. 
These findings were espec ially pronounced at dose sites 2 (left biceps femoris) and 4 (left 
gluteus). These responses are consistent with reactogenicity . The clinical trial design was 
therefore modified to remove the ID route of administration.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Conclusions  
In Sprague -Dawley rats,  45 µg CssBA and 0.5 µg dmLT by [CONTACT_782972] -tolerated and 
immunogenic. M ostly m ild to moderate , short -lived edema and erythema as well as systemic 
inflammatory effects were observed, but non -adverse. This study supports the revised design of 
the P hase 1 study.  
A higher dose of dmLT (1 µg) with 45 µg CssBA IM is associated with increased inflammatory 
responses in rats, thus is not supported by [CONTACT_782973]. Addition of 5 µg SLA -SE to 45 
µg CssBA and either 0.5 or 1 µg dmLT IM led to advers e effects such as limpi[INVESTIGATOR_782931]. Thus, a higher dose of dmLT and inclusion of SLA -SE are 
not supported by [CONTACT_782974].  
ID administration of 45 µg CssBA was well -tolerated, but poorly immunogenic. A ddition of 
1 µg of dmLT to 45 µg CssBA by [CONTACT_782975]. This study supports the safe dosing of 45 µg 
CssBA by [CONTACT_782970], but the inclusion of dmLT at any dose level i s not supported.  
5.3. dmLT  
5.3.1.  dmLT Clinical Experience  
Given the likely importance of anti -LT responses in any successful ETEC vaccine , CssBA will 
be co -administered with dmLT. To that end, a series of phase 1 trials with the CFA/I adhesin 
prototype candidate hav e recently been completed (Riddle and Gutierrez et al, unpublished data , 
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol    
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  25 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) in which the prototype vaccine was co -administered 
transcutaneously and intradermally with LTR192G , or mLT, a n Escherichia coli mutant heat 
labile toxin with  a mutation at amino acid 192 . While 50 μg of LTR192G  administered 
transcutaneously was safe and induced serum IgG and IgA responses in 75 -100% of subjects, the 
magnitude of the responses w as relatively low across all immune parameters. In contrast, anti -LT 
responses in subjects administered [ADDRESS_1076687] similar local reactogenicity results to the 
mLT plus CFA/I adhesin prototype va ccine combination. Given the tolerable safety profile and 
immunogenicity results, the intradermal vaccine was moved into a Phase 2/2b challenge study in 
which a total of 56 subjects underwent vaccination and similar to the phase 1 trial there were no 
vacci ne-attributable systemic adverse events while vaccine site reactions (rash) and pruritus were 
common. There is no previous human experience of dmLT given by [CONTACT_782976]; however, a first in man Phase [ADDRESS_1076688] at 
CCHMC (DMID Protocol 13 -0013; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and oral dmLT administered alone in a dose 
of up to 100 µg and together with an inactivated ETEC vaccine an d live attenuated ETEC 
vaccine in a dose of up to 25 µg were all safe in their respective Phase 1 studies.  Finally, 
comparative preclinical data in mice indicate that dmLT may be less reactogenic at the injection 
site than mLT.  
5.4. Vaccine Administration  
The investigational products will be administered intramuscularly.  Ease and experience with IM 
vaccinations , without need for costly devices or additional training, would allow for more 
optimal transition to use in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696]. Neither of these v accine antigens has been 
administered intramuscularly so the anticipated immune response profile is uncertain.  
The purpose of the study is to determine if immunization with CssBA with dmLT is safe and 
immunogenic. If the vaccines are safe and induce robus t humoral and mucosal immune 
responses, a vaccination/ challenge study  may occur  to assess efficacy in a robust experimental 
ETEC challenge model.  
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol    
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  26 6. TRIAL OBJECTIVES  
6.1. Primary Objective  
 Evaluate the safety of CssBA ± dmLT given by [CONTACT_52596]

a subsequent vaccine and experimental challenge trial  
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol    
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  27 7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Study Design  
This is an open -label Phase 1 clinical trial of CssBA ±dmLT in which a total of 50 subjects will 
receive three vaccinations via IM injection on days 1, 22, and 4 3 (See Table 7). Dose escalation 
of CssBA from 5µg to 15µg to 45µg , and dmLT from [ADDRESS_1076689] vaccination, prior to the enrollment of subjects in Group B.  Following Groups A, B, C, and 
D, a safety analysis will be completed and reviewed by [CONTACT_3433] e Safety Review Committee  (SRC ). 
Progression to subsequent group s will be dependent on safety measured in the first [ADDRESS_1076690] vaccination of the previous group .

7.2. Number of Subjects  
Based on prior studies with similar study designs, sample collections and inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, we anticipate screening approximately [ADDRESS_1076691] prior to conducting any study procedure. 
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol    
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  28 Two consent forms will be signed; a consent form fo r study participation and a separate consent  
form for HIV testing. To assess understanding, a comprehension assessment will be administered  
after the subjects sign the study participation written consent. The following 
evaluations/  procedures will be carri ed out:  
 Oral and/or video presentation of clinical trial design, risks and study schedule  
 Review of informed consent document  
 One-on-one discussions with principal investigator (PI) or sub investigator  
 Signature [CONTACT_701124]  
 Comprehension t est (minimum of 70% accuracy required for participation)  
 Medical history – between Days - 90 to -2 
 Physical examination – between Days -90 to -2 
 Vital Signs – between Days -90 to -2 
 Screening laboratory analysis (allowable time period for accepting test):  
− Compl ete blood count (between Days -90 to -2) 
− Serum transaminases (ALT/AST) (between Days -90 to -2) 
− Na, K+, CL-, HCO3, glucose, BUN and creatinine  (between Days -90 to -2) 
− Pregnancy test (urine -hCG) for wom en, as well as 0-24 hou rs before 
each vaccination 
− Total serum IgA (between Days -90 to -2) 
Additionally, approximately 7 days prior to vaccination (allowable range: Days -14 to -2), 
subjects will have a follow -up medical history and brief physical exam to ensure ongoing 
eligibility. A verbal educational brief will also be provided to the subjects at this visit. The 
following screening laboratory analyses will be carried out:  
 Serum HIV 1/2 antibo dy (between Days -14 to -2) 
 Hepatitis B  surface antigen (HBsAg) (between Days -14 to -2) 
 Hepatitis C  virus (anti-HCV antibo dy) (between Days -14 to -2) 
If initial screening is wi thin the  -14-day window,  it can count as both the  initial screening and 
pre-vaccination visit.  
A screening test for any of the above  assessments may be repeated (total screening blood 
volume not to exceed 30 mL) in the event of a laboratory error (i.e., hemolyzed sample) or in 
the event the  screening physician believes: 1) the laboratory test has identified a normal variant 
of a healthy state and 2)  the variant is no mo re than a G rade 1 abnormality.  This repeat 
screening applies to the  initial screening tests [(executed between -90 to  -2 days) and the  repeat 
screening labs if executed (between days -14 to -2)].  
The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Clinical Trials Center (WRAIR CTC)  may use a 
screening protocol in recruiting subject s for this stu dy. All s creening procedures outlined in this 
section m ay be compl eted und er this s creening protocol. 
During this s creening process, the  laboratory assays will be  reviewed to determine  if any 
clinical laboratory abnormalities exist th at would p reclude study participation. Subjects who 
have only 1 mild (grade 1) abnormality may be included if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_782932] [ADDRESS_1076692]. Subjects with 2 or  more mild 
abnormalities may be included in the  study only with the  consensus of  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_782933] r. Subjects with clinical laboratory abnormalities of greater than mild s everity will not 
be eligible for  this clinical trial. 
The clinical toxicity grading scale that will be used as a g uideline is based on guidance from the 
Center for Biologi cs Evaluation and Research (Guidance for Ind ustry: Toxicity Grading Scale 
for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials) . 
Final grading determination will be made by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_782934]. If any additional safety labs are performed, the FDA 
Guidance for Industry will be utilized. 
7.4. Vaccination  
After initial screening, eligible subjects  will be vaccinated , dependent upon vaccine group 
assignment,  with CssBA with or without dmLT  via IM route to upper arms . The vaccine will be 
administered on days 1, 22, and 4 3 in accordance with formulation and vaccination procedure s. 
IM injection of the vaccine will be given using a 1inch needle  in the deltoid region (study 
clinician may choose another location on a case -by-case basis) by a study clinician.  
7.4.1.  Prior to Injection  
Provisionally qualified subjects  are scheduled to arrive at study site on the morning of Day 1 and 
will undergo the following procedures:  
 Interval medical history is obtained, including medic ations.  
 Vital sig ns are measured prior to dosing.  
 A dire cted phys ical exam is performed.  
 For female subjects , a urine pregnancy test performed.  
 Blood samples are obt ained for immunological testing.  
 Pregnancy (if female of childbearing potential) test results from this visit and all other 
qualification -related laboratory  test results from the screening vis it(s) are reported and 
reviewed.  
 New health information is reviewed to determi ne qualification for enrollment.  
 Inclusion/Exclusion criteria are reviewed to assess continued eligibility.  
 The prospective injection site is examined visually and by [CONTACT_23302] . 
7.4.2.  Vaccine Administration  
Approximately 50 qualified subjects  will be enrolled for vaccination; if an in sufficient number of 
qualified subject s is available to complete enrollment of the group , partial enrollment may occur,  
with the balance of enrollment to occur on later date(s). The injection site will be observed prior 
to dose administration (as above).  If a qualified subject  selected for enrollment is disqualified 
prior to enrollment/randomization and dose administration  (e.g., withdraws consent or the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_782935] a documen ted reason), another qualified subject  will be selected 
for enrollment in place of the disqualified subject .  
CssBA Phase [ADDRESS_1076693] telephone 
numbers for study staff; subjects will be instructed on the use of the materials.  
After at least 30 minut es, the following procedures will be done : 
 Vital signs will be  measured. 
 The injection site will be assessed and any findings will be recorded. Any complaints or 
reactogenicity signs or symptoms will be assessed and documented.  
 The PI (or designee ) may determine  that a subject  requires further on-site observation; 
additional site or clinical assessments may be completed as needed.  
When all stu dy-related procedures are compl ete and the  PI (or designee) determines that a 
subject ’s condition is acceptable, the subject  will be discharged from study site.  
Subsequent immuni zations will be  performed on the alternate upper arm from the  previous 
vaccination. An  exception m ay be needed if there is pain/tenderness, erythema, edema, pruritus, 
induration, or  rash at the planned site  of vaccination. In this case, the investigator may exercise 
the discretion to administ er the vaccination on the  same arm as the previous  vaccination. The  site 
of vaccine administ ration will be  recorded in the  source documents. 
7.5. Post-Vaccination Follow -up 
Subjects will return for follow -up approximately [ADDRESS_1076694] vaccinations. A symptom memory 
aid will be used by [CONTACT_782977] -up visits.  
Blood, saliva , and stool  collections for safety and immunogenicity measures will be collected 
throughout the vaccination phase (See Stu dy and Events Schedule;  Table 8). For female subjects, 
a pregnancy test will be performed prior to each vaccination and on their last study visit.  
Study clinicians will review the memory aid with each subject and use the memory aid to 
complete visit source documents (clinical encounter forms, AE forms) and pro gress notes. The 
clinician will review entries with subject and any changes made to entries will be initialed and 
dated by [CONTACT_423].  
Approximately [ADDRESS_1076695] vaccination , all subjects will be contact[CONTACT_782978] a final safety assessment. In addition to soliciting history of any 
persistence of skin findings associated with vaccine sites, subjects will be asked about the 
diagnosis of any of the conditions  included  in the Medically Attended Adverse Events (MAAEs)

CssBA Phase 1 Protocol    
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  31 Three attempts will be made and documented;  after 3 unsuccessful attempts a certified letter 
and/or email will be used to request th e subject  to contact [CONTACT_3476].  
7.6. Dose Escalation  and Down -Selection  
The decision to advance to the next group  will be based solely on the safety assessment. A dose 
level with no occurrence of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_782937] l. All 
safety data will be summarized and reviewed with the  SRC prior to advancing to dose escalation.  
Approximately one week after the first group ( Group  A) receives the third vaccination dose 
(Day  50), an interim Safety Report will be prepared by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_782938] . The content of the report will be agreed upon by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_782939], but not be limited to, all adverse events (solicited, unsolicited, expected and unexpected) 
as well as relevant safety endp oints. Advancement to Group B will be based entirely on this  
safety assessment. The SRC ’s concurrence to advance to the next  group will be made and 
provided in written format. This process will be repeated after group s B, C, and D before 
enrollment for the  next group . 
dmLT will be administered at the 500  ng dose in group s D and E if no significant reactogenicity 
is observed in Group  C. 
7.7. Study Endpoints  
 Safety : Safety monitoring will be undertaken using in -person symptom surveillance, 
symptom  memory aids, and  targeted physical exams. AE monitoring will survey and 
specifically inquire about fever (oral temperature > 100.4oF), malaise, headache, r ash, 
pain, and extremity pain,  swelling , or local reactions (fur ther addressed in 
section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Clinical definitions will be used to grade the severity of symptoms in 
accordance to the following severity scale:  
Mild  Grade 1  Does not interfere with routine activities  
Minima l level of discomfort  
Moderate  Grade 2  Interferes with routine activities  
Moderate level of discomfort  
Severe  Grade 3  Unable to perform routine activities  
Significant level of discomfort  
Potentially life -threatening  Grade 4  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_181224] f or potentially  
life-threatening event  
 
 Immunology: Seroconversion to LT and CS6 will be defined as a ≥ four-fold increase in  
endpoint titer between pre -and post -vaccination samples. Mucosal responses will be 
assessed similarly after adjusting for total Ig A. A positive ALS response will require a 
four-fold rise in antibody titers between pre and post vaccination  samples.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Virus Serology  
Serologic evidence of chronic HIV -1/2, HCV and HBV infections will be obtained during the 
screening process no earlier than [ADDRESS_1076713] ineligible. Additional testing will not be performed as part of this study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy Screen  
A urine sample for pregnancy testing will be collected at the screening visit  for female subjects ; 
Pregnancy tests will also be obtained on each day of vaccination, and at the final study visit. A 
positive pregnancy test prior to vaccination will result in no additional study vaccinations be ing 
provided.  
Any subjects who become pregnant during the stu dy will have follow -up safety labs (as 
appropriate) prior to being removed from the study. The subject will then be removed from the 
study and followed until the end of their pregnancy. Procedures to be followed in the event a 
study participant becomes pregnant during the study period are outlined below in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] . 
11.2.5.  Local Reactions  
Symptoms and signs will be specifically surveyed for at each visit as well as by [CONTACT_18654] -
report using a symptom memory aid tool. Specifically, the following symptoms wil l be solicited: 
local pain, pruritus, induration, erythema and other rash/skin lesions as well as any systemic 
signs and symptoms. Local reactions will be coded for severity based on the severity scale 
outlined in Section 12.4.3 .  
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol  
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  43 Photograph and Measuring Tool:  A baseline photograph of the vaccination site may be 
obtained prior to vaccination, one day post -vaccination and, in the event of a skin rash, every [ADDRESS_1076714] -vaccination serum samples will be assayed concurrently .  The 
antibody titer assigned to each sample will represent the geometric mean of duplicate tests 
performed on two different days.  Reciprocal endpoint titers < 5 will be assigned a value of 2.5 
for computational purposes.  Seroconversion will be defined as a  ≥ 4-fold increase in endpoint 
titer between pre -and post -vaccination samples AND a post -vaccination reciprocal titer >10.  
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) will be collected to determine a ntibody 
responses from Lymphocyte S upernatant against CS6 and LT. Antibo dy in Lymphocyte 
Supernatant (ALS ) is an indirect quantification of antibody secreting cells (ASC) activated in 
the mucosa that circulate in the peripheral blood about seven days post -mucosal  
immunization /infection. This  method h as been shown  to be a r eplacement for ELISPOT 
methodolo gy.  PBMC s are incu bated with out stimulation and the supe rnatant is later assayed for 
antigen-specific IgG and IgA Abs by [CONTACT_6428]. A positive ALS response  will require  a four-fold 
rise in antibody titers between pre and post vaccination  samples. For each antigen, pre-and post-
challenge s amples will  be tested concurrently . 
11.3.2.  Exploratory Immunology  
Stool and saliva samples will be collected to explore the antigen -specific IgA response at the 
mucosal level  by [CONTACT_782985]6 and LT.  Immunologic respon ders 
will be defined as subjects with  a > two-fold increase in reciprocal endpoint  titer. 
 
Samples will be collected as outlined in the time and events schedule. In order  to support additional 
future exploratory  evaluations in systems biology, c ells and serum samples will be collected for use 
in a variety of transcriptomic, proteomic, flow cytometry, memory B cells, and cytokine analysis. 
Any testing of samples for these e xploratory outcomes will be performed under a modification to this 
protocol to further detail the assay(s) or performed under a separate research protocol.  
 
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol  
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  44 12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Safety monitoring will be conducted throughout the study; therefore , safety concerns will be 
identified by [CONTACT_218909], clinic staff, clinical  monitor, Research 
Monitor , and SRC . 
The SRC will be comprised of one I ndependent Safety Monitor  (ISM) and a committee of 
outside members with expertise i n early phase 1 clinical trials. The SRC will be established 
under  a charter and function to offer their expertise, complete expedited review of safety reports,  
review safety data prior to dose escalation, make recommendations about as to the study 
continuation , and advise the study sponsor regarding trial safety .  
Study Safety Management:  The IRB s, Research Monitor , SRC, and PI [INVESTIGATOR_782947].  
Research Monitor:  The Research Monitor will function as an independent safety advocate for  
subjects per AR [ADDRESS_1076715] 
deaths associated with the protocol and provide an unbiased written  report of the event. At a 
minimum , the Research Monitor should comment on the outcomes of the event or problem and, 
in the case of a SAE or death, comment on the relationship to participation in the study. The 
Research Monitor should also indicate whether  he/she concurs with the details of the report 
provided by [CONTACT_1704]. Reports for events determined by [CONTACT_782986] s hould be promptly forwarded to the IRB and the Sponsor.  
12.1. Safety Parameters  
12.1.1.  Safety Criteria for Dose Escalation  or Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_782948] a dose  -escalation design to evaluate increasing doses of CssBA in 
combination with increasing doses of dmLT.  
The PI, along with the Research M onitor  and SRC , may determine a subject’s local site 
reactions warrant discontinuation of receiving subsequent vaccinations. If any of the following 
events occurs, administration of investigational product will be disconti nued until a thorough 
review of the events is undertaken by [CONTACT_782987]:  
 The occurrence of one or more serious adverse events determined to be related to the 
investigational vaccine (definitely, probably or possibly) within the [ADDRESS_1076716] -
vaccination.  
 Severe diarrhea, defined as six or more liquid stools within 24 hours of vaccination.  
 A severe local rash, defined as one that makes the subject unable to perform normal daily 
activities and which is not attributable to another caus e. 
 Systemic rash, including but not limited to generalized urticaria, generalized petechiae, 
or erythema multiforme, occurring in two or more subjects in a group will result in 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_782949].  
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol  
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  45  One vaccine -related serious or  unexpected AE evaluated by  [CONTACT_978] , Research Monitor, 
and sponsor’s representative and determined to be an unacceptable risk to the health and 
safety of other investigational product recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
Further vaccination, in accordance with the protocol, may be resumed with the concurrence of 
the SRC, sponsor, PI, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
If it is determined that a subject will not continue with future vaccine doses, they will remain 
enrolled in the study for follow -up. 
An interim safety ana lysis for Group A will be prepared and reviewed to include all safety dat a 
through [ADDRESS_1076717]  
vaccination dose. This report will be provided to the SRC after  Day 50 for their review to 
determine whether the study can continue to enroll for the next, dose -escalating group  or 
whether the study should be stopped. In addition to the interim safety analyses, the PI, along 
with the SRC  will stop the study until furt her review by [CONTACT_782988]:  
 One or more grade 3 laboratory abnormalities . 
 Two or more grade 2 laboratory abnormalities.  
 Any serious adverse event (SAE) occurring at any time during the study duration and 
assessed as at least possibly related to study vaccination.  
 Any non -serious unexpected AE related to study vaccination and determined to be an 
unacceptable risk to the hea lth and safety of other investigational product recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
 The same or similar severe (grade 3 or higher) solicited or unsolicited AEs assessed as at 
least possibly related to study vaccination reported by 10% or more subjects in the 7 
days following vacc ination.  
If the study were to be stopped, subjects would be followed for the safety assessments but no 
additional vaccinations would be given (unless otherwise specified by [CONTACT_12217] ). 
12.1.2.  Criteria for Study Termination  
The PI , the Research Monitor, the SRC, IRB, sponsor, or the FDA  may stop or suspend the use 
of the product s at any time.  
12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE, as defined by [CONTACT_284367], is:  
“Adverse event  means any untoward  medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol  
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  46 Suspected adverse reaction  means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes  of IND safety reporting,"  reasonable 
possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug."  
An AE is considered to be any adverse change or exacerbation from a baseline condition which 
occurs following the initial administration of an investigational product whether or not the event 
is considered to be r elated to the investigational product. Examples of this include but are not 
limited to the following:  
 Adverse changes including new signs and symptoms, intercurrent  illness modifying 
the clinical course, or the worsening of a baseline condition including the increased 
frequency of an event or an inc reased intensity of a condition.  
 Concomitant disease with onset or increased severity after the start of study product 
administration . 
 A new pattern in a pre -existing condition, occurring after the receipt of 
investigational product that may signal a clinically meaningful change . 
 Clinically significant changes in laboratory values . 
Medically a ttended adverse event s (MAAE s) are adverse event s that include potential 
immune -mediated medical conditions  as listed in the MAAE s Addendum.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Solicited Adverse Events  
A solicited AE is a predetermined event, identified in the Investigator’s Brochure, which may 
reflect safety concerns rel ated to the investigational product. The solici ted AEs for this study 
include:  
1. Vaccine Site Pain  
2. Vaccine Site Pruritus  
3. Vaccine Site R ash/eruption  
4. Vaccine Site Swelling (As reported by [CONTACT_1130])  
5. Vaccine Site Tenderness  
6. Fever (subjective or objective)  
7. Headache  
8. Loose Stools  
9. Arthralgia  
10. Myalgia  
11. Malaise  
12. Nausea  
13. Vomiting  
Cutaneous evidence of systemic allergic reactions such as urticaria  or angioedema will be also 
documented. Subjects will also be evaluated for development of regional lymphadenopathy. A 
photograph may be taken of local vaccine site reactions for internal use. Systemic signs and 
symptoms will also be documented in detail a nd evaluated as clinically appropriate.  
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol  
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  47 Abnormalities will be described in detail in order to monitor progress.  This will include the 
nature of the adverse event, the date and time of onset and offset (duration), severity, and PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_782950].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in  any of the fo llowing outcomes:  
 Death . 
 Life-threatening adverse event . 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . 
 Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions . 
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adv erse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon  appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive trea tment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is consider ed “unexpected” if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, 
if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended. 
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_106117]) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic en zymes or hepatitis. 
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_131210]) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. 
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refe rs to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned 
as occurring with t he particular drug under investigation.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious and Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  
 
CssBA Phase [ADDRESS_1076718] possibly 
related to the investigational agent(s) or procedures may be of  particular importance for 
reporting.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Other Adverse Event (OAE)  
Other adverse events will be identified by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_615711]. Significant 
adverse events of particular clinical importance, other than SAEs and those AEs leading to 
discontinuation of the subject from the study, will be classified as other adverse events. For each, 
a narrative may be written and included in the clinical study report.  
12.3. Relationship to Investigational Products  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_457442] a relationship of each AE to the receipt of the investigational product.  The 
investigator will use clinical judgment in conjunction with the assessment of a plausible biologic 
mechanism, a temporal relationship between the onset of the event in relation to receipt of the 
investiga tional product, and identification of possible alternate etiologies including underlying 
disease, concurrent illness or concomitant medications.  The following guidelines will be used by 
[CONTACT_782989].  
 Not related: No relationship to investigational product. Applies to those  events for which 
evidence exists that there is an alternate etiology.  
 Unlikely related: Likely unrelated to the investigational product. Likely to  be related to 
factors other than investigational product, but cannot be ruled out with certainty.  
 Possibly related:  An association between the event and the administration of  
investigational product cannot be ruled out. There is a reasonable temporal  associati on, 
but there may also be an alternative etiology such as the  subject's clinical status or 
underlying factors including other therapy . 
 Probably related:  There is a high degree of certainty that a relationship to the 
investigational product exists. There is  a reasonable temporal association, and the event 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_782990]'s clinical state or factors 
including other therapy.  
 Definitely related:  An association exists between the receipt of investigational  product 
and the e vent. An association to other factors has been ruled out.  
12.4. Recording Adverse Events  
12.4.1.  Methods/Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Endpoints  
AEs, solicited AEs,  and SAEs  will be assessed at all study visits, documented in the source 
records, and recorded on the eCRFs using accepted medical terms and/or the diagnoses that 
accurately characterize the event. When a diagnosis is known, the AE term recorded on the 
eCRF will be the diagnosis rather than a constellation of symptoms. The investig ator will assess 
all AEs for seriousness, relationship to investigational product, severity, and other possible 
etiologies. When an event has not resolved by [CONTACT_782991], it will be 
documented on the AE eCRF as “ unknown ”. 
CssBA Phase [ADDRESS_1076719] been diagnosed with any of the medical conditions  listed in the MAAEs  Addendum.  
12.4.2.  Duration of Follow -Up of Subjects after Adverse Events  
Investigators are required to follow AEs and SAEs to resolution, even if this extends beyond the 
prescribed reporting period. Resolution is the return to baseline status or stabilization of the 
condition with the probability that it will become chronic. The SAE outcomes will be reported to 
the sponsor’s representative (see below)  using the Supplemental SAE  Report Forms.

Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAEs in former subjects; however, if a SAE, 
considered to be related to the investigational product s is brought to the attention of the 
investigator at any time following completion of the study, the event will be reported to the 
sponsor’s representative a s defined in section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
12.4.3.  Severity Assessment  
All AEs will be assessed for severity by [CONTACT_093]. Inherent in this assessment is the 
medical and clinic al consideration of all information surrounding the event including any 
medical intervention required. Each event will be assigned one of the following categories: mild, 
moderate, severe, or life -threatening. See section 11.2.2  for vital signs and section 11.2.4  for 
Laboratory values for further guidance in the assignment of  severity.  The criteria below may be 
used for any symptom not included in the grading scale. Any grade 4 (life -threatening) AE must 
be reported as an SAE. The eCRF for AEs will reflect only the highest severity for continuous 
days an event occurred.  
Mild  Grade 1  Does not interfere with routine activities  
Minimal level of discomfort  
Moderate  Grade 2  Interferes with routine activities  
Moderate level of discomfort  
Severe  Grade 3  Unable to perform routine activities  
Significant level of discomfort  
Potential ly life -threatening  Grade 4  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_782951]-threatening event  
 
FDA guidelines for toxicity will be followed; however, if a subject is evaluated in an emergency 
room for nonlife threatening illness or symptoms (i .e., visits  emergency department on weekend 
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol  
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  50 for mild problems because the physician’s office is closed), the information from that visit will 
be reviewed and severity of the adverse event will be assessed according to the subject’s clinical 
signs and symptoms.  
As def ined by [CONTACT_284367], the term “severe” is often used to describe intensity 
(severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event 
itself however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such  as severe headache). This 
is not the same as “serious”, which is based on subject/event outcome  or action criteria usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not 
severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
12.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_454642]’s representative and the local IRB in the appropriate 
safety, annual, and/or final reports. The investigators will prepare annual and final report s to the 
FDA in consultation with the sponsor’s representative.

FDA within [ADDRESS_1076725] submit additional information as soon as it is 
available. The sponsor’s representative  will report unexpected SAEs as sociated with the use of 
the drug to the FDA as specified at 21 CFR 312.32 (c).  
Investigators must follow all relevant regulatory requirements as well as specific policy at each 
institution regarding the timely reporting of SAEs to the local IRB, Research Mon itor, and other 
applicable regulatory agencies . 
Reporting to the sponsor’s representative  does not fulfill the investigator’s duty to report all 
unanticipated problems involving risk to human subjects or others to the IRB. The P I will notify 
the local I RB, the Research Monitor , and other applicable groups, if necessary . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reporting to the IRB  
It is NMRC's policy to report to the IRB within [ADDRESS_1076726] be reported to the  
NMRC  IRB:  
 Single occurrence of a serious, unexpected, and uncommon event that is strongly 
associated with investigational products exposure . 
 A single or small number of a serious,  unexpected event that is not commonly associated 
with investigational products exposure but is uncommon in the study population . 
 Multiple occurrences of an AE that, based on aggregate analysis, is determined to be an 
unanticipated problem. There should be  a determination that the series of AEs represents 
a signal that the AEs were not just isolated occurrences and  involve risk to human 
subjects.  
 An AE that is described in the investigator’s brochure, protocol, or informed consent 
documents, but occurs at a  specificity or severity that is inconsistent with prior 
observations . 
 A serious AE that is described in the investigator’s brochure, protocol, or informed 
consent documents, but for which there is a clinically significant increase in the expected 
rate of occurrence .

13.1.1.  Risks/Discomforts to Subjects and Precautions to Minimize Risk  
Outlined as follows are anticipated and unexpected adverse reactions and a brief description of 
procedures to ameliorate risks and symptoms. All known risks and precautions described here 
are explained in detail in the informed consent. In general, dose escalation is being perfor med to 
ensure an acceptable safety record for IM administration of vaccine products in this study. Prior 
to proceeding with the next dose in the next cohort  of subjects, all safety data will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_12217] , and a determination will be made as to wh ether the study can continue to enroll (at 
the dose escalation planned) based on the observed safety record from the preceding dose level. 
In addition to this overall safeguard, individual risks will be closely monitored and any AEs will 
be quickly identif ied and managed.

in general, has been shown to be a safe and effective route of administration. There may be some 
mild discomfort and irritation  from the initial injection. These are typi[INVESTIGATOR_782954]. In addition, there is the possibility of local erythema, pruritus, swelling, and/or induration 
that appears over time. In addition, subjects may develop temporary swelling in th e lymph nodes 
under the arm where vaccination occurred.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Systemic Reactions  
Any vaccine may be associated with a wide range of systemic reactions, such as fevers,  
constitutional symptoms (fatigue, malaise, appetite change), and gastrointestinal symptoms  
(diarrhea, abdominal pain) as well as others. The frequency and type of systemic symptoms will  
be assessed and analyzed with respect to study products.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy  
During initial screening and prior to each vaccination, a urine pregnancy test will be performed.  
Subjects with a positive test will be excluded from the study. A fin al urine pregnancy test will be 
conducted during the last clinic visit. While female subjects w ill not be required to disclose their 
method of birth control, they will be counseled during  the initial screening on acceptable forms 
of birth control required for study enrollment. At each visit, female subjects will be reminded 
that they must agree to use effective contraception to remain in the study. Female subjects should 
not become pregnan t during the study and for at least [ADDRESS_1076728] vaccine dose.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Lactation  
Risks to nursing infants are unknown at this time; breastfeeding females will be excluded from 
this study. Lactating females must agree not to breastfeed during the study a nd for [ADDRESS_1076729] dose of study vaccination/dose of investigational product.  
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol  
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  56 [IP_ADDRESS].  Venipuncture  
Blood sampling carries a minimal risk of minor discomfort and the possibility of minor bruising  
at the site of the needle puncture and, rarely, the possibility of infection at the needle puncture  
site. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Allergic Reaction  
As with any Investigational New Drug (IND) product administration and no matter what  
precautions are taken, there is always the risk of a serious, or even life -threatening, allergic  
reaction. Although anaphylactic reactions are not anticipated, as with any vaccination, the rare 
possibility exists. For this reason, all subjects will be observed at the study site  WRAIR CTC  or a 
minimum of 30 minutes following vaccine dosing. Appropriate e mergency equipment (e .g., 
automated external defibrillator, air -shields manual breathing unit bag) and medication [e .g., 
antihistamines and adrenaline (epi[INVESTIGATOR_238])] for initial treatment of an allergic reaction will be 
available at the WRAIR CTC whenever immunizations are given. This equipment is available to 
handle  emergencies such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm.  
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol  
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  57 14. STATISTICS  
Detailed statistical procedures, listings, table shells and figures will be provided in a separate 
statistical analysis plan (SAP) . The following key statistical components will be considered and a 
detailed description will be documented in the SAP:  
 Primary and secondary endpoints and how they will be measured,  
 Statistical methods and tests that will b e used to analyze the endpoints,  
 Strategy that will be used if the statistical test assumptions are not satisfied,  
 Indication of whether the comparisons will be one -tailed or two -tailed (with 
justification of the choice) and the level of significance to be used,  
 Identification of whether any adjustments to the significance level or the overall 
p value will be made to account for any planned or unplanned subgroup analyses or 
multiple testing,  
 Specification of potential adjusted analyses and a statement w ith which covariates or 
factors will be included,  
 Planned exploratory analyses and justification of their importance, and  
 Any subgroup effects with biological justification and support from within and 
outside the study.  
14.1. Data Analysis  
The primary study ob jective is  safety.  All subjects who receive vaccination will be included in 
the safety analysis.  Adverse event data will be listed individually and summarized by [CONTACT_782997] a body system for each treatment group. Serious and/o r 
unexpected AEs will also be discussed on a case -by-case basis. For the tabulation of the AEs by 
[CONTACT_6764], a subject will be counted only once in a given body system. For example, a subject 
reporting nausea and diarrhea will be reported as one subject,  but the symptoms will be listed as 
two separate AEs within the class. Therefore , the total number of AEs reported within a body 
system may exceed the number of subjects within the body system reporting AEs.  
Rates of all adverse events will be analyzed by [CONTACT_141612]’s Chi -square test (or Fisher’s exact test if 
assumptions are not met for Pearson’s Chi -square) to compare dose levels. Summary tables will 
be created which will indicate the number of subjects who experienced events. Vaccine -related 
events (probabl y or possibly related) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_2060].  In addition, tables will be 
prepared to list each adverse event, the number of subjects in each treatment group who 
experienced an event at least once, and the rate of subjects with adverse event(s) . Adverse events 
will be divided into defined severity grades (mild, moderate, severe). The tables will also divide 
the adverse events by [CONTACT_782967].  All immunized 
subjects will be included in the safety analy sis. 
Rates of all MAAEs  identified during the long term telephone follow -up calls will be analyzed 
by [CONTACT_141612]'s Chi -square test (or Fisher's exact test if assumptions are not met for Pearson's Chi -
square) to compare dose levels.  MAAEs  data will be listed individually and summarized by [CONTACT_782998]. Summary tables will be prepared to list each MAAE , the number of subjects in each 
treatment group who experienced an event, and the rate of subjects with MAAE (s).  All 
immunized subjects  who complete the long term follow up will be included in the analysis.  
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol  
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  58 For immunology responses, both qualitative (responder rates) and quantitative (log 10 transformed 
values) results will be analyzed.  Geometric mean titers will be calculated along with their 95% 
confidence intervals.  Between groups comparisons will be examined with nonparametric tests 
(Kruskal -Wallis for continuous data and Fisher’s exact test for categorical data) unless 
assumptions are fulfilled for Student’s t or 2. 
Additional compa risons may be made using repeated measures analysis of variance with study 
group as the between subject factor and sample collection time -points as the repeated factor.  
Only subjects who receive at least 2 vaccine doses will be included in the immunology analysis.  
All statistical tests will be interpreted in a two -tailed fashion using P < .[ADDRESS_1076730] concept/testing and is 
designed to evaluate preliminary safety data but not designed to show statistically significant 
differences between groups.  Given the small number of subjec ts per group, the precision of our 
estimate for adverse events is limited.  For example, using binomial probability formulae for no 
observed adverse events within the 8 subjects  yields a 95% exact confidence interval of 0 -31%.  
Follow -on studies evaluating  seemingly safe and immunogenic doses will be required with larger 
numbers of subject s in order to better define the safety profile.  
14.3. Level of Significance to be Used  
All statistical analysis will be made using a two -tailed alpha=0.05.  
14.4. Accounting for Missin g, Unused, and Spurious Data  
Non-analyzable data will be documented in the deviations.  
14.5. Procedures for Reporting Deviations from the Original Statistical Plan  
Any deviation(s) from the original statistical plan as indicated in the protocol will be described in 
an amendment to the protocol and the SAP. Deviations from the SAP will be documented in 
accordance with NMRC SOPs.  
14.6. Selection of Subjects to be Included i n Analyses  
All subjects who receive one or more doses of the investigational product(s) will be included in 
the safety analyses. Subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_1076731] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/ DOCUMENTS  
The investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit trial -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and 
regulatory inspection(s) by [CONTACT_20618]/documents.  
Subjects will be identified on eCRFs by a unique su bject identification number and on source 
documents by [CONTACT_11572]. No personal identifier will be used in any publication or 
communication used to support this research study. The subject identification number will be 
used if it becomes necessa ry to identify data specific to a single subject. Representatives of 
PATH, the sponsor’s representative, the local IRB, and the FDA are eligible to review medical 
and research records related to this study as a part of their responsibility to protect human  
subjects in clinical research. Personal identifiers will be removed from photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_782955].  
15.1. Study Monitoring  
Study monitoring will be the responsibility of The EMMES Corporation . Upon successful 
approval of the protocol and establis hment of the regulatory file, the clinical monitor will 
establish a clinical monitoring plan. To ensure that the investigator and the study staff understand 
and accept their defined responsibilities, the clinical monitor will maintain regular 
correspondenc e with the site and may be present during the course of the study to verify the 
acceptability of the facilities, compliance with the investigational plan and relevant regulations, 
and the m aintenance of complete records.  
Monitoring visits by a sponsor’s representative -designated clinical monitor will be scheduled to 
take place at the initiation of the study, during the study at appropriate intervals, and after the last 
subject has completed the study. A report of monitoring observations will be provided t o the PI 
(for corrective actions), PATH, and the product manager.  
15.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of the sponsor, the FDA, or Institutional Review Board may visit the 
site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verificati on. The purpose of the audit 
or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analyzed, and accurately reported according t o the protocol, ICH GCP, and any appl icable 
regulatory requirements.  
The investigator should contact [CONTACT_782999]’s representative immediately if 
contact[CONTACT_426] a regulatory agency about an inspection.

17.2.1.  Confiden tiality  
In this research, the subject’s health information will be collected and used to conduct the study; 
to monitor the subject’s health status; to measure effects of the study product; to determine 
research results, and possibly to develop new tests, p rocedures, and commercial products. Health 
information is used to report results of research to the sponsor’s representative and Federal 
regulators and may be reviewed during study audits for compliance with study plans, regulations, 
and research policies.  After the study ends, each subject has the right to see and receive a copy of 
his/her information.  
No personal identifier will be used in any publication or communication used to support this 
research study. The subject’s identification number will be use d in the event it becomes 
necessary to identify data specific to a single subject.  
17.2.2.  Compensation for Participation  
All study -related medical care will be provided to subjects without cost.  Should a subject be 
injured as a direct result of participating in this research project, s/he will be provided medical 
care by [CONTACT_615808] (or other Army -affiliated 
medical center), at no cost to the subjects, for that injury.  The subjects will not receive any 
injury com pensation, only medical care.  The subjects will not be compensated for care if s/he 
chooses to seek care from his/her own physician.  Compensation will occur at the time of each 
designated visit (see Time and Event Schedule). Compensation will be provided  only for 
completed study procedures designated for compensatory payment. Subjects will only be eligible 
for compensation outlined in the Informed Consent Document at the time their consent is 
obtained. If a subject is eligible to participate in the invest igational protocol after screening, s/he 
will receive the following compensation:  
Civilian/off -duty milita ry compensation :

referred person who then attends a screening session and meets all  inclusion and none of the 
exclusion criteria.  Compensation will be  independent of the referred person's decision to enroll. 
Referral  compensation for active duty personnel and federal employees is subject to  the same 
restrictions described earlier. Final authority over dispensation  of referral compen sation will lie 
with the CTC director.  Subjects asked to come to the clinic as an alternate on the first 
vaccination day of a cohort may be compensated $ [ADDRESS_1076737] is injured because of participation in this research and is a DoD healthcare 
beneficiary (e.g., active duty in the military, military spouse or dependent), the subject is entitled 
to medical care for that injury within the DoD healthcare syste m, as long as the subject remains a 
DoD healthcare beneficiary. This care includes, but is not limited to, free medical care at Army 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_50276].  
If a subject is injured because of participation in this research and is not a DoD  healthcare 
beneficiary, the subject is entitled to free medical care for that injury at an Army hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59840]. It cannot be determined in advance which Army hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284313]. If the 
subject receives care for research -related injur ies outside of an Army hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7708], the 
subject or the subject’s medical insurance will be responsible for medical expenses.  
For all subjects: Transportation to and from Army hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52584]. No 
reimbursement is available i f the subject incurs medical expenses to treat research -related 
injuries. No compensation is available for research -related injuries. The subject is not waiving 
any legal rights. The subject should contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_782960] 
a research -related injury. The subject should contact [CONTACT_978] [CONTACT_172236].  
Requests for other benefits, such as compensation for lost time from work, are processed 
independently of this protocol. Military members retain the right to pursue milita ry disability 
benefits, and Federal civilian employees retain the right to pursue relief through established 
workers compensation processes, but neither military disability benefits nor workers 
compensation benefits are guaranteed. The right of other parti es to seek redress against the 
[LOCATION_002] Government is limited to that set forth by [CONTACT_783002]. The subject should understand that this does not constitute a waiver or 
release of legal rights. This issue  is addressed in the informed consent and will be discussed with 
the subject by [CONTACT_783003].  
17.3. Written Informed Consent  
The informed consent process and document will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_454709]’s representative prior to initiation of the study. The consent document contains a full 
explanation of the possible risks, advantages, and alternate treatment options, and availability of 
treatment in the cas e of injury, in accordance with [ADDRESS_1076738], or where appropriate, legal guardian, permits access to relevant 
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol  
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  66 medical records by [CONTACT_456]’s representative and by [CONTACT_284384]. Th e 
sponsor’s representative will submit a copy of the initial IRB - and sponsor’s representative -
approved consent form to the FDA and will maintain copi[INVESTIGATOR_782961]/ethics committee.  
A writte n informed consent document, in compliance with [ADDRESS_1076739] to make a personal risk versus benefit decision and understand 
the following:  
 Participation is entirely voluntary,  
 Subjects may withdraw from participation at any time,  
 Refusal to participate i nvolves no penalty, and  
 The individual is free to ask any questions that will allow him/her to understand 
the nature of the protocol.  
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.Clinic alTrials.gov , as required 
by [CONTACT_20008].  
Should the protocol be modified, the subject consent document must be revised to reflect the 
changes to the protocol. If a previously enrolled subject is directly affected by [CONTACT_134404], the 
subject will receive a copy of the revised informed consent document. The approved revision 
will be read, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_423].  
Military personnel will be recruited by [CONTACT_783004]. No recruitment of military personnel will 
occur in the presence of his/her supervisor.  T here is no benefit to military personnel for 
participating in this study.  There will be no coercion or disciplinary actions for not participating 
or withdrawing if enrolled.  
CssBA Phase [ADDRESS_1076740]'s record. If separate research 
records are maintained by [CONTACT_093](s), the medical record and the research records will be 
considered the source documents for the purposes of auditing the study. The source documents 
will be retained at  the site.  
For this study, an EDC database system will be used for the collection of the study data in an 
electronic format. The EDC database system will be designed based on the protocol 
requirements, the approved eCRF layouts and specifications, and in a ccordance with 21 CRF 
Part 11. The eCRF layouts and specifications define and identify the applicable source data that 
will be collected and captured into the EDC database system. The applicable source data will be 
electronically transcribed by [CONTACT_783005] (data entry screens) in the EDC 
database system. The investigator is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the data 
transcribed on the eCRF. Data monitoring and management will be performed in the EDC 
database system by [CONTACT_615803].  
A detailed data management plan will be written and approved by [CONTACT_454720] [INVESTIGATOR_454650]. All updates to the data management plan must be approved before study close -out 
and database l ock. 
18.1. Inspection of Records  
The sponsor’s representative or designee will be allowed to conduct site visits to the 
investigation facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The investigator 
agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, investigational product stocks, drug 
accountability records, subject charts, study source documents, and other records relative to 
study conduct.  
Subjects’ health information is used to report results of research to the sponsor’s represe ntative 
and Federal regulators and may be reviewed during study audits for compliance with study plans, 
regulations, and research policies. The consent document indicates that by [INVESTIGATOR_59844], the subject 
permits access to relevant medical records by [CONTACT_78269]’s representative and  by [CONTACT_566130].  
Upon a subject’s termination from the trial, completed eCRFs will be ready and available for on -
site review by [CONTACT_456]’s representative or the designated representative within [ADDRESS_1076741] for investigation. The records will be kept in a 
secure area with access by [CONTACT_182201]. If it becomes necessary for the sponsor’s 
representative or designee or the FDA to review any documentation relating to the study, the 
investigator must permit access to such records.  
CssBA Phase 1 Protocol  
Version 7.0- 31 AUG 2018  68 Completed, monitored eCRFs will be stored in a secure location by [CONTACT_456]’s representative 
or designee. A copy of each completed eCRF will b e retained by [CONTACT_093].  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_284318], i .e., name, 
address, telephone number, and subject identifier in the study, so that the sponsor’s

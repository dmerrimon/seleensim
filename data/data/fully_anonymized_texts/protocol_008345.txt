 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:  Combined Letrozole and Clomid in Polycystic Ovary 
Syndrome: A randomized control trial of combination of 
letrozole and clomiphene citrate or letrozole alone for the 
treatment of infertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome  
 
Précis:  This will be a single center, randomized controlled  open  trial of 
letrozole versus letrozole and clomiphene citrate (CC) for one 
cycle.  Women will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
letrozole 2.5 mg or combination of letrozole 2.5 mg and 
clomiphene 50 mg for 5 days on days 3 -7 of menstrual cycle.  
We will stratify the randomization by [CONTACT_654] (< 35 versus >35) and 
BMI (<30, > 30) to try to ensure equal groups to study. The 
women and their partners will be instructed to have regular 
intercourse with the intent to conceive during the cycle.  
Patients will have an ultrasound on between cycle day 12 -14 
and will evaluate number of foll icles (>15 mm), follicle size, 
endometrial thickness and pattern. Patients will have mid - 
luteal phase progesterone level drawn. The primary analysis 
will use an intent -to-treat approach to evaluate differences in 
ovulatory rate in the two treatment arms.  
 
Objectives:  Primary :  Cumulative ovulation rate determined by a mid -luteal 
(day 21) phase progesterone level. Progesterone level > 3 
ng/mL will indicate ovulation.   
 Secondary :  Size and number of developi[INVESTIGATOR_100869], 
endometrial thickness and patter n all determined by a mid -
cycle ultrasound. Positive pregnancy test, clinical pregnancy 
and ongoing pregnancy.  We will also report live birth rate , 
miscarriage rate, ectopic pregnancy rate and multiple 
pregnancy rate . We will also monitor complication rat e and 
side effect profile of both treatment arms.    
Population:  70 women with a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome and 
infertility desiring to conceive. Participants will be 18 -40 years 
of age.

 2 INTRODUCTION: BACKGR OUND INFORMATION AND  SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
2.1 Background Information  
 Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in 
reproductive age women and constitutes the most common cause of anovulatory infertility.[ADDRESS_111350] been used and all with varying success in regards to both ovulation and 
pregnancy rates.   
 Clomiphen e citrate (CC) is a commonly used pharmacologic agent to induce ovulation in 
women with PCOS. It works as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) by 
[CONTACT_100873]. As the negative feedback of estrogen is 
lower ed it in turn activates increased secretion of gonadotropin hormones which subsequently 
causes ovarian follicular growth.  CC also has an antiestrogenic effect on endometrial 
development and cervical mucus production.  This has been implicated to contribut e to the low 
pregnancy rate despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a relatively high ovulation rate.  2, 3 
Letrozole has a different mechanism of action and works as a high ly selective aromatase 
inhibitor thus preventing androgen -to-estrogen conversion.  The negative feedback in the 
hypothalamus is decreased by [CONTACT_100874] ( FSH).  An additional mechanism of 
aromatase inhibitors may result from increase follicular sensitivity to FSH resulting from 
temporary increased intraovarian androgens.[ADDRESS_111351]. Recently,  a randomized control trial comparing letrozole to clomiphene 
demonstrated that letrozole was associated with higher live -birth rate (27.5% vs 19.1%, 
P=0.007, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.87) and cumulative ovulation rate (61.7% vs. 48.3%, P<0.001) 
among women with po lycystic ovary syndrome.[ADDRESS_111352] and improve the ovulatory rate.  
One study has prospectively reviewed treatment outcomes using a combination of letrozole and 
clomiphene who had previously fa iled CC for 6 cycles and letrozole for 4 cycles.  This study 
enrolled 100 patients and showed an ovulatory rate based on development of dominant follicle 
of 82.9% of cycles (213/257) with the combination treatment.10  However, this study was not 
randomized and used a limited popu lation of women with PCOS that were resistant to both 
clomiphene and letrozole alone. Additionally, patients received Gonal -f on day 11 if a dominant 
follicle was present and then received hCG trigger when the follicle was >18 mm in size

and superior method to letrozole alone to achieve ovulation in wo men with PCOS.  
 
2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
2.3.1  Potential Discomforts & Risks  
Both letrozole and CC have are used for the treatment of infertility.  Below is a table 
listing all tests or procedures involved in this research study and their related 
discomfort s and risks.

Letrozole  Fatigue, dizziness, nausea, hot  flashes, discomfort in 
your joints, back pain, increased cholesterol levels, 
formation of ovarian cysts, multiple preg nancies  
* Table is modified from PPCOS II trial  
It is expected that patients will not experience all of these side effects. Side effects 
associated with medications are temporary and manageable.   
Although the goal of treatment is to achieve pregnancy, there is no guarantee that 
treatment will result in pregnancy or a live birth.  CC has been associated with a 5 -8% 
multiple pregnancy rate and Letrozole is associated with a 3.4% multiple pregnancy ra te 
in women with PCOS.  The multiple pregnancy rate of the combination of these 
treatments is unknown. Multiple gestations are associated with preterm labor and 
delivery as well as most pregnancy complications including diabetes and high blood 
pressure.  
If pregnancy occurs it is possible that the pregnancy results in a non -viable pregnancy 
or tubal (ectopic) pregnancy.  In either of these cases occur, further medial or surgical 
treatment may be necessary.   
The incidence of congenital anomalies in the gene ral population is 3% to 5%. In the 
PPCOS II trial comparing letrozole and CC there were a total of 5 congenital anomalies 
(1/66 in CC group – 1.5%, 4/102 in letrozole group 3.9%).9  
2.3.2  Potential Benefits  
Possible b enefits to participants : The potential benefit to the participants is that they 
will receive a treatment (letrozole) that is known to improve ovulatory and pregnancy 
rates in women with infertility and PCOS compared to no treatment at all or CC alone.  
The participant may receiv e a treatment (letrozole + CC) that may prove to be more 
effective than letrozole alone. Treatments may result in pregnancy although this cannot 
be guaranteed.  
With the mid -cycle ultrasound and hormone testing the participant may receive 
additional inform ation and understanding related to their cause of infertility.

 3 OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Primary research hypotheses  
Treatment with the combination of letrozole and clomiphene is mor e likely to result in 
ovulation (increased ovulation rate) compared to treatment with letrozole alone in 
women with infertility and PCOS.   
3.1.1  Primary  Outcome measures  
The primary outcome measure is the occurrence of ovulation defined as a mid -luteal 
progester one level > 3 ng/mL. This will be tested [ADDRESS_111355] prof ile of both treatment arms.  
We will evaluate pregnancy outcomes and report any fetal anomalies.

 4 STUDY DESIGN  
Treatment Design : This will be a single center, open trial of oral letrozole vs. 
combination of oral letrozole and clomiphene citrate in the tre atment of infertility in 
patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.  Patients will be randomized to receive either a  
dose of 2.5 mg of letrozole or 2.5mg of letrozole and 50 mg of CC for 5 days on cycle 
days 3 through 7 of the menstrual cycle.  Patients will  be monitored during the cycle 
with a mid -cycle ultrasound (cycle days 12 -14) and a mid -luteal progesterone level 
(cycle day 21).  
The study will last for -1 cycles or approximately -5 weeks.  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (< 35 versus > 35) and BMI (< 30 and > 30) to 
ensure equal groups to study.  Randomization will be via a computer based central 
randomization to ensure adequate allocation concealment.  
Enrollment will take approximately 18 months if ~ 3.89subjects are enrolled per month. 
Active  subject participation will be through completion of -1 cycle .  We will follow up with 
patient regarding pregnancy , delivery outcomes , and if information is not available via 
chart abstraction .

population of healthy women with PCOS and infertility not specified by [CONTACT_5748]. 
Infertility will be determined by [CONTACT_100875]. PCOS will be determined by [CONTACT_100876]: oligo - or anovulation, hyperandrogenism or 
polycystic ovaries on ultrasound.

Protocol <>  
IRB# 201606806  4/24/[ADDRESS_111358] meet all following 
criteria:  
1. Provide signed and dated informed consent.  
2. Willing to comply with all study procedure and be available for the duration of the 
study.   Ability to have regular intercourse during the ovulation inductio n phase of the 
study.  
3. Diagnosis of infertility : Inability of couple to achieve successful pregnancy after 12 
months of regular timed unprotected intercourse in women less than 35 years of age; 
and after 6 months of regular intercourse without use of con traception in women 35 
years and older.11 If in the clinical case of anovulation, 12 month period of time 
“infertility” is not necessary.   
4. Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome : based on Revised Rotterdam criteria which 
includes two of  the three following findings12 and the definitions and criteria are modified 
from the PPCOS II trial9: 
 1. Oligomenorrhea or chronic anovulation : spontaneous intermenstrual periods of 
> 45 days or a to tal of < 8 menses per year. In women with more regular bleeding 
patterns but suspected anovulatory bleeding, a mid -luteal serum progesterone level < 3 
ng/mL is consistent with chronic anovulation. For women with a history of < [ADDRESS_111359] year prior to the study would qualify as 
evidence of oligomenorrhea.   
 2. Hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical) : clinical hyperandrogenism 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_100878]. Hyperandrogenemia defined as an elevated total testosterone 
based on the laboratory criteria. Labs could be local or from UIHC.  
 3. Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound : defined as either an ovary that contains 12 or 
more follicles measuring 2 -9 mm in diameter, or an increased ovarian volume (>10 cm3) 
on one ovary.   
  
5. Normal sperm concentration of 15 million/mL and with normal motility of > 40% 
according to World Health Organization cutoff points, in at least one ejaculate during the 
previous year.[ADDRESS_111360] eligibility. If male partner has fathered 
a child, SFA is not necessary.  
CLC PCOS Protocol  Version 2.0 
Protocol <>  
IRB# 201606806  4/24/[ADDRESS_111361] prior to starting 
treatment medication.  
 2. Patients currently taking hormonal contraception.  A 1 month washout for any 
type of combined co ntraceptive or oral progestins will be required.  If use of hormonal 
implants or depo progestins a longer washout of 3 months will be required.   
 3. Patients with other known cause of infertility: endometriosis, tubal factor, 
uterine abnormalities.  
 4. Patients with uncorrected thyroid disease defined based on their local lab or at 
UIHC ( 0.27 to 4.20 µIU/mL ). Once corrected and within this range, they may be enrolled 
if the other inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.  A normal lab within the last year  is 
adequate for entry.  
 5. Patients with untreated hyperprolactinemia.  A normal prolactin within the past 
year at local lab or at UIHC ( 4.8 to 23.3 ng/mL)  is adequate for entry.  
 6. Medical conditions in which we recommend avoiding pregnancy until under  
improved control:  
 -Patients with poorly controlled Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes (defined as a 
hemoglobin A1c > 6.5%)  
 - Patients with poorly controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure 
> 160 mm Hg or diastolic > [ADDRESS_111362] 60 minutes apart)   
 7. Patients with contraindications to clomiphene citrate: hypersensitivity to CC or 
any of its components, history of liver disease or known liver disease (LFT’s are not 
necessary prior CC use and enrollment into the study), unkn own cause of abnormal 
uterine bleeding, intracranial lesion.  
 8. Patients with contraindications to letrozole: hypersensitivity to letrozole or any 
of its components.   
 9. Patients taking medications known to affect reproductive function or 
metabolism or  that are an absolute contraindication during pregnancy.   
 10. If patients are suspected based on clinical findings for other etiologies that 
mimic PCOS, work up must be completed to exclude other etiologies prior to enrollment 
(i.e. Cushing’s syndrome, an drogen -secreting tumor).

6.1.1  Prior Studies  
The primary outcome is ovulation, defined by a mid -luteal progesterone level > 3 ng/mL. 
There is data demonstrating the cumulative live birth rate with clomiph ene and letrozole 
from the PPCOS II trial. This trial compared letrozole to clomiphene demonstrated that 
letrozole was associated with a higher cumulative ovulation rate (61.7% vs. 48.3%, 
P<0.001) among women with polycystic ovary syndrome  and the rate of ovulation after 
one treatment cycle with letrozole 2.5 mg was 50% .9   Unfortunately, there is no 
comparative quality data from randomized trial s of the combination of letrozole and CC.  
There is one study that prospectively reviewed treatment outcomes using a combination 
of letrozole and clomiphene who had previously failed CC for 6 cycles and letrozole for 
4 cycles.  This study enrolled 100 pati ents and showed an ovulatory rate (defined by 
[CONTACT_100879]) of 82.9% of cycles (213/257) with the combination 
treatment.10  However, this study was not randomized and used a limited population of 
women with PCOS that were resistant to both clomiphene and letro zole alone. 
Additionally, patients received Gonal -f on day 11 if a dominant follicle was present and 
then received hCG trigger when the follicle was >[ADDRESS_111364] set a benchmark of 30% difference 
between groups as a clinically meaningful.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_111365] for other factors such as the 
randomization stratification of age and BMI and prior exposure to study medications.   A 
per protocol analysis will also be performed.  
6.1.4  Sample Size calculations  
A sample size of 31 subjects in each arm of the ran domization yields 80% statistical 
power to prospectively demonstrate a 0. 30 absolute difference in ovulation rate between 
treatment arms (0. 50 for Letrozole and 0.8 3 for combined letrozole and CC) using the 
Pearson’s chi -square test having a two -sided sign ificance level of 0.05. The sample size 
has been inflated to 35/arm to allow for a dropout rate of 10%. Dropout rate in the 
PPCOS II trial was 19.5% in the letrozole group however this was a longer study in

Since there are fewer visits, fewer surveys and shorter enrollment period we anticipate 
a lower dropout rate in this trial.

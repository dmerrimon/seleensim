INTRODUCTION: 
 
A.  Overview 
Immunosuppression therapy has significantly improved the success rate of liver transplantation.  
Tacrolimus (TAC) is the most widely used calcineurin inhibitor in liver transplantation. TAC 
suppresses the immune responses by [CONTACT_663408].  However, calcineurin 
inhibitors are associated with the long-term side effect of nephrotoxicity, which is a leading cause 
of 
the morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation ( C hinnakotla et al., 2003; Donovan et al., 
2003).  The late withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitors may not improve renal function, as early 
da
mage is irreversible after several months.  A delayed introduction of calcineurin inhibitors has 
been proposed as an alternative strategy to reduce the rate of renal dysfunction immediately 
following liver transplantation.  Alternative immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as interleukin 2 
(IL2) inhibitors and agents that block the  proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes have shown 
limited success, but they are all associated with increased graft rejection, failure, and eventually 
increased mortality.5, [ADDRESS_895598] early renal function via induction 
immunosuppression with Thymoglobulin® may avoid these risks associated with alternative 
maintenance or induction immunosuppression strategies.  (anti-thymocyte globulin [rabbit] ; 
[COMPANY_011]; Cambridge, MA) is a polyclonal gamma immunoglobulin, obtained by [CONTACT_663409] ( Thymoglobulin ® Prescribing Information).   
 
Th
ymoglobulin® mediates T-cell suppressive effects via inhibition of proliferative responses to 
se
veral mitogens, with post-transcription blockade of interferon gamma and CD25 synthesis.7-10  
Possible mechanisms by [CONTACT_663410]® induces immunosuppression in vivo include T-
c
ell clearance from the circulation and modulation of T-cell activation, homing and cytotoxic 
activities.11  T-lymphocyte depletion is observed in transplant patients shortly after administration 
of Thymoglobulin®.12  This may result from the complement-dependent lysis in the intravascular 
spa
ce or the opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by [CONTACT_663411]-coated T-cells 
(Bonnefoy et al., op cit ).  T-lymphocyte depletion in peripheral blood persists for several days to 
several months following cessation of Thymoglobulin® therapy, without associated morbidity.13   
 
Th
ymoglobulin® is currently indicated for the treatment of acute renal transplant rejection in the 
United 
States (US).  Thymoglobulin® has been widely prescribed in Europe since 1985, and is 
re
gistered in [ADDRESS_895599] demonstrated that 
Thymoglobulin® has been used successfully in various immunosuppressive regimens to prevent 
or 
treat acute graft rejection following kidney, heart, liver, and pancreas transplantation.  The 
reported rates of acute rejection reversal ranged from 78% to 100% for all types of acute rejection, 
a
nd from 74% to 94% for corticosteroid-resistant renal rejections.14-20  When used as an induction 
(prophylactic) agent, Thymoglobulin® was reported equivalent to, or better than, other 
im
munosuppressive regimens, such as triple therapy or quadruple therapy using Atgam® 
(lymphocyte immune globulin, anti-thymocyte globulin [equine] sterile solution), OKT3 
(O
rthoclone OKT®3 [muromonab-CD3]), or IL2 inhibitors for the prevention of graft rejection in 
va
rious types of solid organ transplantations.  Thymoglobulin® demonstrated a consistent adverse 
e
vent (AE) profile across published controlled clinical studies ( Thymoglobulin ® Investigator 
Brochure ).

B.  Kidney Dysfunction in Liver Transplantation 
Acute Kidney Injury (AKI):   Rapid decline in renal function with or without the need for renal 
replacement therapy is common in the period immediately before and after liver 
transplantation.1-4, 21- 24  In a series of 105 OLT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], McCauley et al showed that 94.3% of 
re
cipi[INVESTIGATOR_663373] a 50% increase from the baseline preoperative serum 
creatinine.4  In addition, 10% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_663374] (RRT) in the form of CVVHD or intermittent hemodialysis.4  In a Spanish 
series, Gainza et al found acute renal failure,  (serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL or need for RRT), in 
46%
 of OLT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_663375].23  Series from Mount Sinai Medical Center, 
[LOCATION_001] and Baylor College of Medicine, Dallas found a postoperative RRT rate of 22% and 
12% respectively in relatively large cohorts, (n = 1602 and 724), of OLT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].22, [ADDRESS_895600] definition of acute renal failure of which there was none until 2004.25, 26   
 
O’Riordan employed the RIFLE criteria25 for the definition of acute renal failure in a study of 
359 O
LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_663376], and found an 11.1% postoperative incidence of 2-fold increase in 
se
rum creatinine and a 25.7% incidence of 3-fold postoperative increase in serum creatinine, or 
the
 need for RRT.[ADDRESS_895601] transplant outcomes, including mortality.1-4, 21- 24   
 
Mc
Cauley reported an association between postoperative peak serum creatinine and mortality.4  
Mortality was  6.7%, 33.3%, 40% and 67% for peak serum creatinine of 1.7-3.0mg/dL, 3.1-
4.3mg/dL, 4.4-5.6mg/dL and 7.7-8 .9mg/dL, respectively.4  In the study by O’Riordan, 30-day 
survival was 95.7%, 91.2% and 76.3% for OLT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_663377], 2-fold increase in serum creatinine and 3-fold increase in serum creatinine or need for 
RRT, respectively (P<0.001 normal renal function vs. 3-fold increase in serum creatinine or 
RRT).2  The study also found a 1-year survival of 47.5% in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_89278] 3-fold increase in 
se
rum creatinine or RRT compared to 78.4% in those with normal postoperative renal function 
(p<0.001).2  Postoperative acute renal failure that was severe enough to warrant RRT was 
a
ssociated with a 2-fold increase in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (39 days vs. 73 days)2 and a five-fold increase 
in t
he duration of postoperative intensive care unit stay (2 days vs. 10.5 days).[ADDRESS_895602]
operative acute renal failure is a potent risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the 
late post-transplant period.27-29   
 
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):  Chronic kidney disease of varying severity is even more 
common than postoperative acute renal failure in OLT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].22, 28- 33  McCauley found CKD, 
(defined as serum creatinine ≥1.7mg/dL), in 77.3% of OLT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].[ADDRESS_895603], when CKD 
was defined as serum creatinine >2.8mg/dL, Fisher et al found CKD in only 4% of 883 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_663378].  Gonwa et al found CKD, (defined as serum creatinine >2.5mg/dL), in 
4.9%
 and end stage renal disease (ESRD) in 5.4% among [ADDRESS_895604] of 23% at a median time of 46 months 
after liver transplantation.22  Out of 1173 OLT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_663379], CKD, 
(
defined as serum creatinine ≥1.8mg/dL for ≥2 weeks ), was observed in 11.7% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].30  I n 
a French series of 204 OLT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], Neau-Cransac et al reported a CKD incidence of 10.7%,

                                                                                                                                                                13 (CKD was defined as serum creatinine >2.3 mg/dL).31  The wide range in reported incidence is 
part due to the different thresholds used to define CKD.   
In a registry study of 36,849 OLT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_663380]34 was applied, investigators found a 5-year CKD stage IV-V, (stage IV CKD = eGFR 15-
29mi
n/min/1.73m2; stage V CKD = ESRD), incident rate of 18.1%.33  Registry data in the U.S. 
indi
cate that 3-6% of deceased donor kidney transplantations that are currently performed in the 
U.S. go to previous recipi[INVESTIGATOR_663381] (OLT) which further worsens the 
critical shortage of transplantable organs for the overall ESRD population.[ADDRESS_895605]-transplant period in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_663382].   
 
Serum creatinine (sCr) has been included in the new Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)-
based organ allocation system employed in the US by [CONTACT_663412] 
(UNOS, 2003 ). 
 
The MELD calculation is: MELD Score = 0.957 × Loge (creatinine mg/dL) + 0.378 × Loge 
(bilirubin mg/dL) + 1.120 ×Loge (International Normalized Ratio [INR]) + 0.643

                                                                                                                                                                [ADDRESS_895606] transplant death, 
and of the MELD factors or albumin, only sCr predicted late mortality (all p <0.001) ( Wolfe, et 
al., 2003 ).  For long-term liver graft survivors, renal failure is the leading cause of death after10 
years (Chinnakotla, et al., op cit. ).  Renal dysfunction also contributes independently to 
neurological complication after liver transplantation ( Donovan, et al., op cit ).   
 
C.  Thymoglobulin ® in Liver Transplantation  
P
reliminary data from a single-center experience, using Thymoglobulin® induction in liver 
tra
nsplantation, to delay calcineurin inhibitor use and spare renal function suggests that such a 
stra
tegy is worth further evaluation in a prospectively designed clinical trial.  This retrospective 
analysis of 298 consecutive adult primary liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (66.8% male, mean age 54.8 
± 11.7 years), transplanted between 1991and 2002 has recently been presented.  A pre-transplant 
baseline sCr of 132 mmol/L, (1.5 mg/dL), was arbitrarily set as abnormal renal function (ARF). 
F
ifty-nine patients (Group 1) had ARF, and 239 (Group 2) had normal renal function.  In 215 
pa
tients, Thymoglobulin® induction was initiated on the day of surgery, at 1.5 mg/kg, for a median 
of 
5.4 doses over the initial 2 weeks.  In the other 83 patients, no induction with Thymoglobulin® 
or 
other antibodies was used.  All patients received cyclosporine or tacrolimus (TAC) and 
corticosteroid maintenance immunosuppression.  Also, 77% of the patients received either 
m
ycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine (Imuran).  Indications for orthotopic liver 
transplantation and demographics were similar between the two groups.   
 
F
reedom from rejection was statistically significantly higher in the Thymoglobulin® group at one 
y
ear post-transplant, (72% vs 50%; p = 0.001).  Group 1 (ARF) had lower patient and graft survival 
at 1, 6, and 12 months compared to Group 2 (normal RF); [(81, 73, 61% vs. 96, 91, 87%) for 
pa
tient survival, and (78, 66, 54% vs. 93, 84, 79%) for graft survival, ( p < 0.001)].  In Group 1, the 
use of Thymoglobulin® improved early patient survival, (85% vs. 67%; p =  0.078) and early 
rejection- free graft survival, (75% vs. 42%; p = 0.018).   
 
I
nitiation of calcineurin inhibitor therapy was significantly delayed in the Thymoglobulin® group, 
(median Day 6 vs. Day 1; p = 0.0074).  The sCr recovered significantly for those in Group 1 who 
re
ceived Thymoglobulin® induction, by [CONTACT_127805]-transplant.  The authors concluded that 
Th
ymoglobulin® induction provided an event-free early post-liver transplant course resulting in 
be
tter early patient and graft survival, as well as a better rejection free primary graft survival.41   
 
D.  Study Rationale 
Functional recovery of renal function from acute renal failure occurs in 75% of patients at 
approximately 14 days after onset of the disease (Schrier, Diseases of the Kidney).  In liver 
transplantation, intraoperative hemodynamic insults typi[INVESTIGATOR_663383].  In practice, 
patients who demonstrate early evidence of acute renal failure often have their CNI therapy 
delayed for 4-[ADDRESS_895607] on the

Thymoglobulin® ([COMPANY_011], Cambridge, MA) is a polyclonal immunosuppressive agent that is 
de
rived from rabbits immunized with pediatric thymocytes.  It contains antibodies to a wide variety 
of T-cell antigens and MHC antigens and is approved for the treatment of kidney rejection by [CONTACT_941] 
F
ood and Drug Administration (FDA) in the [LOCATION_002].  Thymoglobulin® has been shown to 
be
 a safe and efficacious induction therapy that permits delayed exposure to CNI therapy while 
preventing the occurrence of acute rejection in kidney transplantation.42, [ADDRESS_895608] on renal function late after liver transplantation. 
 
INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT – [ANTI-THYMOCYTE GLOBULIN (RABBIT)] – r-ATG 
T
HYMOGLOBULIN ®: 
 
A. Chemistry 
Thymoglobulin® (anti-thymocyte globulin [rabbit]) is a purified, pasteurized, gamma 
im
munoglobulin, obtained by [CONTACT_389668] ( Thymoglobulin ® 
Prescribing Information ). This immunosuppressive product, a polyclonal antibody, contains 
cytotoxic antibodies of defined specificity against functional molecules on T-lymphocytes.  
Thymoglobulin®  is supplied as a sterile, freeze-dried product for intravenous administration after 
reconstitution with a diluent, (Sterile Water for Injection, [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia [USP]). 
 
R
econstituted preparation contains approximately 5 mg/mL of Thymoglobulin®, of which >90% 
is 
gamma immunoglobulin.  The reconstituted solution has a hydrogen ion concentration (pH) of 
7.0 ± 0.4.  To minimize the risk of transmission of infective agents, viral testing is performed 
during production, and a viral inactivation step, (pasteurization, [i.e. heat treatment of the active 
ing
redient at 60°C for 10 hours]) is an integral part of the Thymoglobulin® manufacturing process.  
The
 potency of the product is determined by [CONTACT_663413].  Each lot is analyzed and 
determined to meet quality standards before release. 
 
B.  Immunopharmacology 
The in vitro mechanism of action by [CONTACT_663414]-lymphocyte preparations suppress 
immune responses is not fully understood.  Thymoglobulin® includes antibodies against T-cell 
mar
kers such as CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11a, CD18, CD25, CD44, CD45, HLA-DR, HLA Class 
I heavy chains, and β2 microglobulin ( Bonnefoy et al., op cit),44 as well as dendritic cells45 and 
adhesion molecules.46, 47  Thymoglobulin® (>0.1 mg/mL) mediates T-cell suppressive effects via

bition of proliferative responses to several mitogens with post-transcription blockade of 
interferon gamma and CD25 synthesis ( Bonnefoy et al., op cit ).  The in vivo mechanism of action 
of Thymoglobulin® is also not fully understood.  Possible mechanisms by [CONTACT_663410]® 
ma
y induce immunosuppression in vivo include T-cell clearance from the circulation and 
modul
ation of T-cell activation, homing and cytotoxic activities ( Clark et al., opcit ). T-lymphocyte 
depletion is promptly observed in transplant patients following administration of Thymoglobulin®

                                                                                                                                                                16 (Guttmann et al., op cit ).  This may result from the complement-dependent lysis in the intravascular 
space or the opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by [CONTACT_663411]-coated T cell s 
(Bonnefoy et al., op cit ).  T-lymphocyte depletion in peripheral blood persists for several days to 
several months following cessation of Thymoglobulin® therapy ( Gabe r et al., op cit ).   
 
Th
ymoglobulin® is a potent immunosuppressive agent that demonstrates a rapid and profound 
e
ffect in lowering white blood cells (WBC), primarily by [CONTACT_663415] T-cell counts.  The 
magnitude and duration of lymphopenia have been studied.  Reductions of circulating lymphocytes 
by 83% to 92% from pretreatment values were seen after a single dose of Thymoglobulin®, and 
we
re sustained throughout the daily dosing period in 4 clinical pharmacology studies ( data on file, 
[COMPANY_011] ).  The recovery from Thymoglobulin®-induced lymphocyte depletion was gradual, 
beginning soon after cessation of therapy, with most recovered by 3 months.  Recovery may take 
longer than 3 months, but persistent lymphocyte depletion has not resulted in any morbidity.  T-
cell subsets determined by [CONTACT_663416].  In a Phase 
III randomized trial of 26 patients, T-cell depletion was greater in the Thymoglobulin®-treated 
pa
tients as compared with the Atgam® (Pharmacia-Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI)-treated patients.  T-
c
ell depletion lasted for at least 90 days after the cessation of therapy.  At that time, T-cell counts 
remained 40% lower in Thymoglobulin®-treated patients than in Atgam®-treated patients ( Gabe r 
et al., op cit ).   
 
After intravenous (IV) infusion of Thymoglobulin®, (1.25 to 1.5 mg/kg/day, each infusion 
a
dministered over 4 hours for 7-11 days), Thymoglobulin® levels were on average 21.5 μg/mL 
(r
ange 10-40 μg/mL), 4-[ADDRESS_895609] dose, and 
87 μ
g/mL (range 23-170 μg/mL), with a half-life of 1-[ADDRESS_895610] dose ( Bourdage  and 
Hamlin, op cit ).  During a Thymoglobulin® Phase III randomized trial, of the 108 patients 
e
valuated, anti-rabbit antibodies developed in 68% of the Thymoglobulin®-treated patients, and 
a
nti-horse antibodies developed in 78% of the Atgam-treated patients.  These antibodies appear to 
be non- blocking, anti-isotypic antibodies.48,49   
 
C.  Overview of Clinical Efficacy and Safety 
Treatment of Acute Rejection 
A controlled, double-blind, multi-center, randomized clinical trial comparing Thymoglobulin® 
a
nd Atgam for the reversal of acute renal allograft rejection was conducted in 163 renal transplant 
patients with biopsy-confirmed Banff Grade II (moderate), Grade III (severe), or corticosteroid-
resistant Grade I (mild) acute rejection, while receiving maintenance immunosuppressive  therapy 
(Gabe
r et al., op cit ).  Patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive 7-14 days of 
Thymoglobulin® 1.5 mg/kg/day, or Atgam 15 mg/kg/day.  Thymoglobulin® was better than or at 
lea
st as successful as Atgam in reversing acute rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].   
 
B
ased on intent- to-treat analysis, 72 of 82 Thymoglobulin®-treated patients (87.8%) and 61 of 80 
Atg
am-treated patients (76.3%) had a successful response to study treatment.  Ten 
Thymoglobulin®-treated patients and 21 Atgam-treated patients failed the original therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The
y were all rescued with subsequent center-specific treatments.  One year after treatment, 83% 
of Thymoglobulin® -treated patients compared with 75% Atgam-treated patients still had a 
functioning allograft ( p = 0.194). The 1-year patient survival rate was 93% for Thymoglobulin®-
tre
ated patients and 96% for Atgam-treated patients ( p = 0.26).

Efficacy of Thymoglobulin ® in Liver Transplantation 
I
n previous eras of transplant immunosuppression, induction with anti-lymphocyte antibodies has 
been used to reduce acute rejection. With the advent of calcineurin inhibitor-based 
im
munosuppression, particularly TAC, antibody has been used less frequently in liver 
tra
nsplantation.  However, a number of transplant centers have reported single-center experiences 
with the use of Thymoglobulin® for prophylaxis of rejection in liver transplantation.  
 
The
 University of Indiana studied 109 adult liver transplant patients over 15 months.  Six patients 
who 
died in the perioperative period, prior to receiving Thymoglobulin®, were excluded. All 
pa
tients had at least two months post-transplant follow-up.  Postoperatively, patients received 3 
dose
s of Thymoglobulin®, (2 mg/kg/dose), administered every other day, steroids tapered to 20 
mg
/day by [CONTACT_663417] 7, and TAC initiated on postoperative Day 3-4, (trough levels 10-
12). 
 Elevations in liver function test numbers (LFTs) in the first 4 weeks were investigated with 
doppler ultrasound, followed by [CONTACT_663418] (ERCP).  If 
these
 tests were non-diagnostic, biopsy was performed to evaluate rejection.  The report noted 96% 
of patients were alive.  No graft was lost due to rejection.  Ten percent of patients had epi[INVESTIGATOR_663384], and a cumulative total of 6%, 8% and 10% of patients had biopsy proven rejection at 4, 
8 and >8 weeks, respectively.  All rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_663385] a steroid pulse, and no 
patient had steroid resistant rejection.  No patient had more than 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_86560].  Three of 
the 10 patients with rejection had autoimmune hepatitis and were placed on mycophenolic acid 
(Myfortic) in addition to TAC and steroids.  Two patients experienced vascular complications, 
[(i.e. hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT)].  Thymoglobulin®-related AEs were limited to fever, 
c
hills, tachycardia, and worsening oxygen saturation.  No patient required reintubation as a result 
of Thymoglobulin®.  No patients had post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD).   
 
I
n a subset analysis, 42% of patients had hepatitis C Virus (HCV).  Rejection occurred in 12% of 
HCV patients and 9% of non-HCV patients, (not statistically significant).  At [ADDRESS_895611]-
tra
nsplant, 31% of HCV patients had biopsy-proven hepatitis.  The authors concluded that 
Thymoglobulin® induction therapy increased patient and graft survival, lowered incidence of 
re
jection, and was associated with minimal detrimental side effects ( M angus et al. 2003 ).   
 
In an earlier published retrospective review of 63 liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_663386] 73 OLT 
procedures, the use of Thymoglobulin® compared with a group not using Thymoglobulin® as part 
of 
induction therapy was evaluated.[ADDRESS_895612] rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], hematological parameters, and infectious complications.  Fifty-
seven OLT procedures were induced with Thymoglobulin® plus triple therapy and [ADDRESS_895613]
e therapy alone.  All retransplants were performed under Thymoglobulin®  induction.  Three 
to 6 vials (25 mg/vial) of Thymoglobulin® were administered via IV infusion each day. Dose 
a
djustments were based on WBC and platelet counts.  Doses were held when platelets were below 
30,000 X 106/mL, and/or WBC count was below 2500 x 103/m L.  Fever (61%), thrombocytopenia, 
anemia, and leucopenia were the most common AEs reported with Thymoglobulin® induction 
therapy.  These AEs were managed by [CONTACT_663419].  
Infectious complications were similar in both groups.  Rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_663387]® group (n = 33, 58%) when compared with the triple therapy control group 
  
Version 17 (3/27/2017)                          
                                                                                                                                                                18 (n = 12, 75%).  Rejection in the Thymoglobulin® group occurred later after transplantation, at a 
median of 51 days, compared to 11.5 days in the control group (p <0.05).  Occurrence of rejection 
while patients were on Thymoglobulin® was low, (7%), compared with the control group, (50%).  
How
ever, patient and allograft survival at one year was slightly lower in the Thymoglobulin® 
group, (84% and 68%, respectively), compared with the control group, (94% and 81%, 
re
spectively).  Although, in general, patients who ultimately received Thymoglobulin® were more 
ill prior to transplant, based on their need for ventilator support (21% vs. 0%), ICU status (37% 
vs. 12%), and renal dysfunction (11.8% vs. 8.1%), prior to transplantation.  This retrospective 
stud
y demonstrated that Thymoglobulin® as part of induction therapy resulted in a lowe r incidence 
of graft rejection during the first [ADDRESS_895614] rejection.  In addition, Thymoglobulin® allowed for the delay of initiation of cyclosporine 
ther
apy for up to [ADDRESS_895615]-transplant, without an increase in infectious complications. 
 
Experience with the elimination of steroid use in OLT through induction with Thymoglobulin® 
wa
s recently reported.51, 52 In an initial prospective, randomized study, 36 patients received 
Thymoglobulin® 1.5 mg/kg via IV infusion during the anhepatic phase of liver transplantation, 
followe
d by a second dose on postoperative Day 1, compared with [ADDRESS_895616] LT.  
Patient survival was 91% in both groups.  Graft survival rate was 89% in both groups.  Biopsy-
proven acute rejection rate was 20.5% (n = 7/33) in the Thymoglobulin® group, all responsive to 
incr
eased doses of TAC, compared with 32% (n = 11/33, not statistically significant) in the group 
receiving corticosteroids, of whom 7 patients required additional corticosteroids, and only 4 were 
responsive to increased doses of TAC.  The incidence rate of hepatitis C was 50% in the 
Thymoglobulin® group, and 71% in the corticosteroid group, (not statistically significant).  
I
nfectious complications were less in the Thymoglobulin® group, primarily due to higher 
c
ytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in the corticosteroid group.  In summary, the authors concluded 
that Thymoglobulin® induction accompanied by [CONTACT_663420] 
e
liminating the need for concomitant corticosteroid therapy. 
 
Eason has reported follow-up on 140 OLT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_663388]-free protocol, using two doses of Thymoglobulin®, 1.5 mg/kg/dose 
(Eason 
2002, op cit ).  Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of TAC and MMF, with TAC 
monot
herapy at 2 weeks in the Thymoglobulin®  induction, steroid-free group, and at 3 months in 
the ste
roid group. Patients receiving Thymoglobulin® induction had a lower incidence of steroid-
re
quiring rejection, (3% vs. 62%, p =  0.01).  The incidence of post-transplant diabetes was 5% in 
the Thymoglobulin® induction group, compared with 16% in steroid-treated patients ( p <0.05).  
The incidence of CMV infection was lower in the Thymoglobulin® induction patients, (9%), 
c
ompared with steroid-treated patients, (19%).  The incidence of recurrent hepatitis C was 58% in 
Th
ymoglobulin® induction patients, compared with 72% in steroid-treated patients, with more 
ster
oid-treated patients progressing to fibrosis.  The authors concluded that steroid-free 
immunosuppression using Thymoglobulin® and TAC monotherapy, “is effective in preventing 
re
jection and minimizing severity of rejection with a decreased incidence of immunosuppression-
related adverse effects.”

                                                                                                                                                                19 Another recent preliminary report of a retrospective study compared two immunosuppressive 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_663389] (LDLT) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_663390] (ACR), TAC dose and toxicities, and graft and patient survival.  Between 
May, [ADDRESS_895617] 17 patients, (Group 1), were 
tre
ated with TAC and steroids.  The additional 12 patients, (Group 2), were treated with a steroid-
spa
ring protocol using low dose TAC and Thymoglobulin® administered as a 5 mg/kg dose via 
c
ontinuous infusion, over 4 hours, prior to surgery.  Clinical records were reviewed to assess the 
following
 variables: mean daily TAC dose at 2 months after transplant, Thymoglobulin® and 
c
alcineurin inhibitor side effects, ACR, infections, and graft and patient survival.  There was no 
notable difference in demographics between the 2 groups, (age, sex, diagnosis, and UNOS status).  
The
 mean follow-up was 7 months.  There were no reported complications from the 
Thymoglobulin® infusion.  Five of the 17 patients (30%) in Group 1 experienced early, (<30 days), 
biops
y-proven rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]; two of the 12 patients (17%) in Group 2, experienced early 
re
jection.   All the rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_663391] [ADDRESS_895618] to rejection.  Mean daily TAC dose at 2 months was 5.2 mg/day in Group 
1, and 2.1 mg/day in Group 2 ( p < 0.05).  The number of viral infectious epi[INVESTIGATOR_663392].  No TAC-related neurotoxicity was seen in Group 2, while two patients in Group 1 
we
re switched to sirolimus monotherapy due to TAC neurotoxicity.  No change from TAC to 
another drug was made in any patient in Group 2.  Patient survival was as follows: three patients 
in Group 1 died, all from sepsis.  All 12 patients in Group 2 were alive and well.  The authors 
concluded that these very preliminary results of Thymoglobulin® induction, followed by 
[CONTACT_663421]-free low dose TAC in the controlled setting of LDLT, showed that 
Thymoglobulin® induction was safe and provided adequate immunosuppression, with minimal 
risk 
of rejection, less risk of CNI toxicities, and improved graft and patient survival, when 
c
ompared to historic controls with standard TAC and steroid immunosuppression ( Masetti et al., 
2003).   
 
I
n summary, induction with Thymoglobulin® has been reported to lower acute rejection rates.  It 
ha
s been used in protocols to spare the use of steroids and calcineurin inhibitors.  The rate of 
recurrence of hepatitis C infection in some series was  lower, but was not statistically significant.   
 
Ov
erview of Thymoglobulin ® Safety 
Tota
l patient exposure to Thymoglobulin® worldwide, since 1984, when Thymoglobulin® was 
fir
st licensed in [LOCATION_009], is approximately 2.1 million vials, equivalent to over 54,000 courses.  
Thymoglobulin® induces T-cell depletion and modulation.  The lymphocyte count is reduced by 
>
85% after the first dose, with reductions sustained throughout a course of treatment.  T-cell 
depletion in peripheral blood persists for several days to several months following cessation of 
treatment.  Approximately 60% of patients are expected to experience AEs with the use of 
Thymoglobulin® .  Thymoglobulin®  presents a consistent AE profile, with AEs that are generally 
manageable or reversible ( Granjard et al., 1989 ).  AEs with Thymoglobulin® occur with similar 
or 
less frequency than those reported with other polyclonal, anti-T-cell agents.  The most 
frequently reported AEs include fever, chills, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, headache, diarrhea, 
and abdominal pain.  These usually occur after the first infusion.  The cause of some of these AEs 
is probably related to cytokine release.  Premedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines, and 
a
 decrease in the infusion rate may reduce the incidence and severity of certain AEs.  While

                                                                                                                                                                [ADDRESS_895619] been reported.   
 
In a US Phase III controlled clinical trial (N = 163), comparing the efficacy and safety of 
Thymoglobulin® and Atgam for the treatment of acute renal allograft rejection, the AEs were 
sim
ilar in both treatment groups and were generally manageable or reversible ( Gaber et al, op cit ).  
Infection and PTLD are associated with use of immunosuppressive agents, including 
Thymoglobulin®.  Some transient abnormalities of liver function tests have been described in 
pa
tients with aplastic anemia, treated with Thymoglobulin® or other anti-thymocyte globulins.  It 
is 
not clear whether these rarely reported abnormalities are related to the disease and pre-existing 
liver dysfunction, or to the treatment.53   
 
In a more recent retrospective, single center,  comparative study (Bajjoka et al)  118 patients 
received Thymoglobulin® with delayed initiation of CNI at 4.6 + 2.3 days, compared to 80 patients 
treated with early initiation of CNI at 1.9 + 2.5 days after liver transplantation.  The 
Thymoglobulin®  group had a significantly higher baseline serum creatinine (2.8 vs. 2.2, P=0.005) 
a
nd lower baseline eGFR (30.4 vs. 37.4, P<0.001).  At one year post transplant the 
thymoglobulin® group had a sig nificantly lower serum creatinine (1.4 vs. 1.7, P<0.001), and 
higher eGFR (57.3 vs. 43.7, P<0.001).  A significantly lower number of patients in the 
thymoglobulin® group stayed on dialysis at one year (0.8% vs. 13%, P<0.001).  Graft and patient 
surviva
l at one year were the same, and there was less incidence of rejection in the 
Th
ymoglobulin® group54.  
 
In a recent phase I/II randomized, controlled trial of 2 different doses of Thymoglobulin® and 
e
xtended delay of CNI initiation,  compared to early CNI therapy after liver transplantation, serum 
c
reatinine and eGFR in patients induced with Thymoglobulin® was significantly better at one 
y
ear, (1.0 vs. 1.1 vs. 1.5mg/dL), and (87.8 vs. 72.0 vs. 51.0 mL/min) respectively.  Th e  study was 
designed in three groups, 10 patients per group.  In one group the Thymoglobulin® dose was 3 
mg
/Kg (2 doses of 1.5 mg/Kg); in the second group the Thymoglobulin® dose was 4.5 mg/Kg (3 
dose
s of 1.5 mg/Kg).  Patients in these two groups received CNI by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_895620] group received early CNI, within two days after liver transplantation. Rejection rate was 
higher in the low-dose Thymoglobulin® group, but there was no difference in patient and graft 
surviva
l at one year. 55 
 
An overview of the safety profile of Thymoglobulin® is presented.  The most common systemic 
AE
s during and after Thymoglobulin® infusion are: fever (63%), chills (57%), pain (46%), 
he
adache (40%), abdominal pain (38%), diarrhea (37%), hypertension (37%), nausea (37%), 
peripheral edema (34%), dyspnea (28%), asthenia (27%), hyperkalemia (27%), and tachycardia 
(27%), ( T hymoglobulin ® Prescribing Information ).  Hypotension, vomiting, and malaise have 
also been commonly reported.  The likely mechanism of action for these events is the release of 
cytokines during the first dose administration, particularly if appropriate premedications were not 
administered.  Localized AEs, such as pain at the infusion site and peripheral thrombophlebitis, 
ha
ve also been reported.  Rare delayed allergic reactions such as serum sickness, (fever, pruritus, 
a
nd rash associated with joint and muscle pain), may occur [ADDRESS_895621]-treatment initiation. 
I
mmediate serious allergic reactions and/or anaphylaxis are very rare.

                                                                                                                                                                21 AEs associated with the presence of antibodies inducing cross-reactions such as leucopenia (57%) 
and thrombocytopenia (37%) have been reported during and after treatment with 
Thymoglobulin®, ( T hymoglobulin ® Prescribing Information ).  The se reactions may emerge 
during the first 2 days of treatment or after treatment. The mechanism of action likely causing 
these effects involves the presence of antibodies cross-reacting with shared antigens of 
lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets, or additive effects from concomitant medication.  
Moni
toring of the WBC and platelet counts enables the severity and frequency of such reactions 
to be reduced. 
 
AEs associated with over-immunosuppression, including infectious complications (bacterial, 
fungal, 
viral, and/or protozoal), and malignancies, (particularly lymphoproliferative syndrome), 
ha
ve been reported.  It is important to note that concomitant or previous immunosuppressive 
treatments may contribute to over-immunosuppression.  Appropriate anti-infective prophylaxis 
will significantly reduce the incidence of infections and possibly the incidence of viral-associated 
malignancies.

B.  Patient Population 
S
tudy participants will be recruited from the Liver Transplant Programs at Cleveland Clinic, 
Cleveland, Ohio; University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio; Medical College of Wisconsin Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin, and Cleveland Clinic Weston, [LOCATION_012]  
C.  Number of Patients :  One hundred and ten (110) liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_663394], approximately  40-50 patients at Cleveland Clinic, (the lead center), and 15-25 
patients at each of the three additional participating centers (number of enrollment may vary at 
diff
erent centers).   
Sample size estimates for study of liver dysfunction 
 
Sample sizes were computed on the bases of using Welch’s two-sample t-tests to compare 
changes in creatinine between the control and the thymo 4.[ADDRESS_895635] 
deviation.  The former would tend to yield smaller sample sizes, while the latter larger.  
Assuming that 10% of the patients that are initially enrolled will drop-out before 12 months 
values are measured, the sample sizes indicated should be increased by 10% to account for this 
drop-out. 
 
These calculations were done using SAS software (version 9.3, Cary, NC).  A significance level 
of 5% and two-tailed tests were assumed for all testing. 
 
  
Version 17 (3/27/2017)                          
                                                                                                                                                                [ADDRESS_895636] deviation—0.12, 0.32, 
a
nd 0.51.  Based on these calculations, enrolling enough patients to meet the sample size 
re
quirements for detecting differences in delta creatinine (within 2 SD, 0.32) will mean having 
a
mple sample size for detecting differences in month 12 GFR. Accordingly, we noticed that a 
sa
mple size of 110 (55 in each group) would give us 90% power with the safest margin for 10% 
dropo
uts throughout the study.

Version 17 (3/27/2017)                          
                                                                                                                                                                25  Use  of a calcineurin inhibitors continuously, for more than [ADDRESS_895637] 6

during the duration of the study. 
E.  Patient Numbering 
Enrollment will take place after completion of OLT, (within [ADDRESS_895638] completion of liver 
transplantation ).  At the time of enrollment, each subject will be assigned a unique subject 
identifie
r, beginning with the Site Specific Acronym, [Cleveland Clinic = CC; University of 
Cincinnati = UC ; Medical College of Wisconsin = MW, and Cleveland Clinic Weston = WE].  The 
Site Acronym will be followed by [CONTACT_4856] [-], and a sequential three digit subject number, [i.e. 
001, 002, 003, etc.], for identification.  Assigned, (three digit), subject numbers will be sequential, 
and represent a subject within each clinical site.     
 
Once the subject is enrolled into the study, he/she will be assigned the lowest available subject 
number at that Study Site.  If the subject fails to be randomized, for whatever reason, the subject’s 
number and reason for not progressing into the trial will be entered on the Study Enrollment Log.  
Once assigned to a subject, a subject number will not be reused.  All subjects who fulfill all the 
inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria will be assigned a Randomization 
Number, at the time of Randomization.  This number will be used to link the subject to his/her 
respective treatment group.  
F.  Treatment Group Assignment 
A 
randomization schedule will be generated and kept by [CONTACT_663422], after approval of 
the protocol by [CONTACT_663423], and each participating center’s respective IRB, and prior 
to Study Start-up.  Randomization numbers will be assigned in the order in which subjects qualif y 
for treatment, not in the order of study subject enrollment.  
 
Subject randomization will be performed provided the patient has signed the Informed Consent 
AND met all Study Entry Criteria, (Inclusion and Exclusion), AND is “Enrolled” into the Study.   
Randomization will be performed  within 6 hours of the patient’s arrival to the Intensive 
Care Unit, (ICU),  after the transplant procedure.  Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to 
re
ceive delayed CNI with 4.5 mg/Kg Thymoglobulin® [Group 1], or early CNI therapy [Group 
2]
.  All subjects will receive maintenance therapy with MMF and corticosteroids.   
G.  Early Patient Withdrawal/Study Treatment Discontinuation 
S
ubjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study or be withdrawn from the study, at the 
dis
cretion of the investigator, at any time.  A patient should be withdrawn from the study if the 
investi
gator believes that continuation would be detrimental to the patient’s well-being.  Reasons 
for Study Treatment Discontinuation / Early Patient Withdrawal  are: 
 De ath after consent,  but prior to randomization.  
 Gr aft loss and/or re-transplantation. 
 P regnancy. 
 Withdrawal of informed consent, (subject’s decision to withdraw for any reason). 
  
Version 17 (3/27/2017)                          
                                                                                                                                                                26  An y clinically significant AE/SAE(s), laboratory abnormality, and/or incurrent illness 
whic
h, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], indicates that continued treatment with study 
therapy and/or further participation in the study, (including obtaining vital status of the 
subj
ect and allograft), is not in the best interest of the subject. 
 Unsa tisfactory therapeutic effect (e.g. repeated acute rejection). 
 Te rmination of the study by [CONTACT_663424]. 
 S ignificant protocol violation. 
 P rotocol deviation resulting in significant patient safety risk. 
 S ubjects who for any reason cannot be followed and/or are unable to meet the 
requirements of the protocol.  
 
If Early Patient Withdrawal occurs, or if the subject fails to return for scheduled study visits, 
the inve
stigator must determine and document which of the above reasons led to the patient’s 
premature withdrawal.  For subjects who are lost to follow-up, the investigator should show 
"due diligence" by [CONTACT_268295], 
[e.g. date(s) along with  documentation of telephone calls, registered letter(s), etc].  Subjects 
who a
re prematurely withdrawn from study medication or from the study will not be 
replaced.  Withdrawal of a subject from study treatment does not imply that the subject is 
withdrawn from the study.  
H.  Discontinued Subjects 
The investigator should accept only those subjects who give a reasonable indication that they will 
complete the study and comply with study procedures.  An evaluation that reflects the status of the 
subject at premature termination, with a final assessment and reason(s) for termination, must be 
documented .  No replacements will be allowed for treated subjects who do not complete the study. 
 
STUDY TREATMENTS: 
A.  Investigational and Control Drugs 
 
The
 administration of Thymoglobulin®, to allow for delayed initiation of CNI, is the 
I
nvestigational Treatment of the study.  It will be administered only to those subjects randomized 
to Group 1/Arm 1, the delay ed CNI group/arm.  Subjects randomized to Group 2, the early CNI 
tre
atment group/arm will not receive any placebo therapy.   The dosing of Thymoglobulin® will 
be
 a total of 4.5 mg/Kg, administered as 1.5 mg/Kg/dose, in  3 divided doses.   
 
All 
Thymoglobulin® infusions will be administered through a central IV line, via a volumetric 
infusion pump, through a 0.[ADDRESS_895639] dose of Thymoglobulin® will be infused 
ove
r 6-12 hours, on Day 0, after liver transplantation , (withi n 12 h ours after arrival to the 
Intensive Care Unit).  The subsequent two (2) additional doses of Thymoglobulin® will be 
infuse
d over 4-6 hours (each dose), on Day [ADDRESS_895640] LT.   
 
S
ubjects are to receive pre-medications, (according to the antibody infusion protocols of each 
investi
gative center), [e.g. corticosteroids, anti-histamine, and acetaminophen ], to minimize 
infusion related events.

B.  Dose Adjustments / Dose Holds / Discontinuation:  
T
hymoglobulin® dose adjustments should be based on AEs / SAEs. 
 
The Following will Necessitate a Dose Reduction, and/or Discontinuation of Thymoglobulin ® 
In
fusion [Dose 2 and/or Dose 3]: 
 M ajor/Severe Allergic Reaction or Anaphylactic Reaction  – all further 
Thymoglobulin® Infusions are to be DISCO NTINUED  – patient will be taken 
“O
ff Study”.  
 AN C less than 1200 cells/µL  - Reduce dose by 50% 
 ANC less than 800 cells/µL  -  Hold dose and re-evaluate the following day 
 P latelet count: <[ZIP_CODE]  give half of the dose or delay the dose for 24h and re-
check. Infuse platelets if platelet count is still <[ZIP_CODE] after 24h of delay before 
Thymo infusion. Do not infuse if platelet count is <[ZIP_CODE].  
 
 
 
INF
USION REACTION: 
 All patients are to be pre-medicated with [corticosteroids, antihistamine, 
acetaminophen (per institutional standard)], prior to each Thymoglobulin ® Infusion, 
(in order to minimize the incidence of “infusion reaction”). 
 
 In  the event of Thymoglobulin ® Infusion Reaction [fatigue, headache, nausea, 
vom
iting, abdominal pain, fever, chills, pruritus, urticaria] –  INTERRUPT THE 
INFUSION AND INFORM THE PHYSICIAN BEFORE RESUMING THE 
INFUSION.   
 
 
 T he infusion may be resumed at a 50% decreased flow rate (with a maximum length 
of infusion of 8 hours):

OTHER MEDICATIONS/THERAPI[INVESTIGATOR_663371]: 
A.  CNI Treatment:   
Tacrolimus will be the only CNI used in this study,  [with the exception of change over to 
c
yclosporine in the event of neurotoxicity due to tacrolimus].   
 
Ta
crolimus will be administered to all subjects according to the protocol-specified dosing 
reg
imen, [t o maintain Ta crolimus Blood Trough (C-0h) Levels/Concentrations] shown in  
Table 4. Tacrolimus to be administered by [CONTACT_663427] [suspension] if not 
a
ble to take by [CONTACT_1966]. In rare cases, better if not, could be administered as sublingual. We should 
try not to use tacrolimus as intravenous unless absolutely necessary.

In the event of CNI intolerance, (e.g. nephrotoxicity) , dose reduction of tacrolimus may be 
necessary.   The tacrolimus dose may be adjusted as needed by [CONTACT_10670].  All dose 
adjustments/modifications will be recorded on the appropriate CRF page, at each Study Visit.   
 
I
n the event of neurotoxicity, due to tacrolimus, the patient will be switched over to c yclosporine 
as the CNI alternative.  In this event the patient will not need to be removed from the study.  This 
change in CNI, (from tacrolimus to cyclosporine), will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.      
 
 
 
Cyclosporine (CsA)  will be administered to maintain Cyclosporine Blood Trough (C-0h) 
Levels/Concentrations shown in Table 5.

doses may be administered IV or NG if patient is unable to take PO/orally. 
C.  Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) Therapy: 
All subjects in the study will be treated with MMF for a minimum of 6 months.  The initial dosing 
of MMF is to be 2 Grams daily, (1 Gram twice daily – every 12 Hours).  The dose can be 
subseque
ntly adjusted at the Investigator’s discretion, based on subject tolerance and AEs.   
Mycophenolate Mofetil should be administered orally, (PO/NG).  However, intravenous (IV) 
dosing is permitted, if needed, due to intercurrent illness, postoperative ileus, or other causes, at 
the 
Investigator’s discretion.  Initial dose of MMF to be administered IV or NG on Day 0, after 
OLT . 
 Subsequent doses should be administered PO or NG, as soon as the subject is able to tolerate 
medic
ations by [CONTACT_1966].  The dose and schedule may be adjusted on the basis of laboratory values, 
(e.g. decreased WBCs), and subject tolerability, (as stated below).  For full prescribing 
information, see the package insert.

E.  Liver Biopsies   
There are no “protocol-driven”  Liver Biopsies in the Study.  However, a Liver Biopsy will be 
necessary in the following instances for confirmatory diagnosis: 
 F or “suspected” Acute Cellular Rejection (ACR) 
 F or Hepatitis C (HCV) recurrence (for HCV positive patients), or as per institutional 
standa
rd for HCV-positive patients.  
 F .  Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute Rejection Epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]: 
In the event of suspected acute liver allograft rejection, an allograft biopsy MUST be performed 
PRIOR to the initiation of anti-rejection therapy.   Whenever possible, anti-rejection therapy 
should be postponed until a histological diagnosis of rejection is confirmed.   These biopsies will 
be
 read locally at each clinical center and the histological lesions will be graded according to the 
Grading of Acute Liver Allograft Rejection, (Banff).   Biopsy results from the local pathologist 
are to be recorded on the Liver Allograft Biopsy CRF.  Patients experiencing a Biopsy Proven 
Acute Rejection (BPAR) epi[INVESTIGATOR_663396].  Treatment is to be consistent for all subjects at each respective Study Site.  Details of 
treatment of rejection will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.  A biopsy for suspected rejection 
will be performed based on clinical/biochemical information and judgment of the Investigator(s).  
G
.  Diagnosis and Treatment of HCV: 
F
or suspected HCV infection, an allograft biopsy will be performed prior to initiation of any anti-
HCV viral therapy.  The biopsy will be read locally, at each Study Site, and the histological 
lesion(s) will be graded.  The biopsy results, as reported by [CONTACT_663428], will 
be
 recorded on the Liver Allograft Biopsy CRF.  Patients experiencing a biopsy proven recurrence 
of HCV infection are to be managed following the local standard practice in a consistent manner 
within the center for all subjects.  Details of treatment of HCV will be recorded on the appropriate 
CRF.  
H.  Study Drug (Thymoglobulin ®) Discontinuation 
In the absence of medical contraindication or significant protocol violation, every effort will be 
made to continue Thymoglobulin® dosing.  Reasons for Thymoglobulin® (Study Drug) 
disconti
nuation will be recorded on the  appropriate CRF .  Reasons for Thymoglobulin® (Study 
Drug) discontinuation are: 
 De ath 
 Graft Loss 
 Withdrawal of Informed Consent 
 Clinically significant AEs/SAEs 
 Unsatisfactory therapeutic effect 
 S ignificant protocol violation 
 Protocol deviation resulting in significant patient safety risk 
 
All subjects discontinuing Thymoglobulin®  prior to completing the target total dose will continue 
to be followed in order to obtain follow-up information, and should not be considered withdrawn 
  
Version 17 (3/27/2017)                          
                                                                                                                                                                33 from the study.  Information will be collected on serum creatinine levels, urea, eGFR, rejection 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], graft loss/re-transplant, malignancies, opportunistic infections, patient survival and 
immunosuppressive therapy.   
 
Subjects who did not complete the planned Thymoglobulin® course will be followed for any 
S
AE(s) occurring within [ADDRESS_895647] dose of Thymoglobulin®.  T hese SAE(s) will 
be reported on the (MedWatch SAE Form) and UPLOADED to the [COMPANY_011] PV Portal, and 
faxed to Cleveland Clinic PI – “Attention: Bijan Eghtesad, MD” at ([PHONE_13719], within 24 
h
ours of Study Site discovery/notification.   Since subjects will be followed even after 
discontinuation of the Study Drug, the Study Completion CRF  should only be completed at [ADDRESS_895648] can no longer be followed. The following reasons are 
potential causes for premature discontinuation of study: graft loss, death, lost to follow-up and 
withdrawal of consent.   
I.  Emergency Un-Blinding of Treatment Assignment 
This is an open-label study. 
J.  Study Completion and Post-Study Treatment 
A 
Study Completion CRF should be completed at Month 12.  The Investigator also must provide 
follow-up medical care for all patients who are prematurely withdrawn from the study, or must 
refer them for appropriate ongoing care. In addition, investigators will be asked to provide, for 
each randomized patient, a one-year follow-up data to describe patient survival, graft survival, 
a
cute rejection, current immunosuppressive regimen, recurrence of hepatitis C and renal function.  
 
 
EFFICACY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENTS: 
A.  Renal function 
Renal function will be assessed by [CONTACT_663429] (eGFR ), using the MDRD 
4-variable equation.  Serum creatinine will also be used as a parameter for determination of renal 
func
tion at each Study Visit.  Subjects will be classified for each occurrence of AKI according to 
the criteria in Table [ADDRESS_895649]-
tr
ansplant. 
B.  Acute Cellular Rejection 
Acute cellular rejection (ACR) will be assessed using the B anff Criteria  for rejection.  All acute 
rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_663397].  Acute rejection will be defined as any 
biops
y-proven Grade 1 (mild) or higher rejection using the Banff Criteria.   Biopsy results, 
(a
s graded by [CONTACT_663430]), will be recorded on the Liver 
Allog
raft Biopsy CRF using a standard liver biopsy grading procedure,  for both Acute and 
Chronic Rejection.  In addition, all epi[INVESTIGATOR_663398] a n Adverse  Event, 
(AE), and an AE (MedWatch) Form must be completed.     
Therapy for biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) will be administered according to Study Site 
I
nstitutional Standards.

ADVERSE EVENT AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (AE/SAE) REPORTING: 
 
A.  Adverse Events (AEs): 
An Adverse Event is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence, including any abnormal 
sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom(s) or disease, (even 
if the event is not considered to be related to the study intervention).  Adverse Events encompass 
both physical and psychological harms.  For this study, the study intervention consists of the 
a
dministration of low dose Thymoglobulin® Infusion/Induction, (on Day 0, Day [ADDRESS_895653]
 LT), along with a delayed initiation of CNI, (tacrolimus), on Day [ADDRESS_895654] LT.   
 
Medical conditions/diseases present before study participation will be considered Adverse 
Events (AEs), only if they worsen after randomization,  or any procedures or treatments specified 
in t
he protocol.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results will constitute an AE only if they 
induce
 clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy.

I
nformation regarding all Adverse Events, [whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by 
[CONTACT_663431], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other means] , 
will be collected and recorded on the AE CRF, and followed as is appropriate.  Adverse Events 
will be described as follows: 
 
 Duration (with start and end dates) 
 S everity Grade (mild, moderate, severe) 
 R elationship to the study drug/intervention (suspected / not suspected) 
[Related/Possibly Related or Not Related] 
 Ac tion(s) taken  
 Outc ome 
 
B.  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs): 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse experience that results in any of the following: 
 De ath 
 A life-threatening experience 
 An inpa tient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] 
 A p ersistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 A c ongenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or 
surg
ical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
 
Life-threatening experience:   Any AE that places the patient, in the view of the Investigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred.  Does not include an AE that had it occurred 
in a mor
e severe form, might have caused death. 
Persistent or significant disability/incapacity:   A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
Important medical even ts:  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding 
whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events 
which may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but might 
jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent any of the other outcomes listed in 
the definition of a Serious Adverse Event.  These should also be considered Serious Adverse 
Eve
nts. 
In addition, all biopsy confirmed reports of acute cellular rejection (ACR) will be submitted to 
S
anofi PV as an SAE whether or not the event has met the SAE criteria.  Since acute cellular 
rejec
tion (ACR) is a secondary endpoint of the study, all BPAR epi[INVESTIGATOR_663399], for consistency and accuracy in event reporting and data

TUDY ASSESSMENTS: 
A.  Visit Schedule and Assessments 
Study subjects will be seen and evaluated according to the Study Visit/Assessment Schedule, 
[Appendix A].   A V isit Window of [± 3 days]  should be maintained for [Visits 11 and 12 (Months 
1 and 3)] .  A Visit Window of [± 7 days]  should be maintained for [Visits 13-15 (Months 6, 9, 
and 12)] .  Whenever possible, effort should be made to ensure that all Study Visits are timed to 
coincide with regularly scheduled post-transplant follow-up visits.  Additional clinic visits may be 
made
 according to the subject’s status and the routine practice at the Investigative Study Site.   
 
B
.  Physical Examination: 
A limited physical examination/assessment will be performed at all study visits.  Information about 
the physical examination must be present in the source documentation at the study site. Significant 
findings that are present prior to the start of study drug are to be recorded as part of the patient’s 
Relevant Medical History/Current Medical Conditions, and recorded on the appropriate CRF.  
Significant findings made after randomization, which meet the definition of an Adverse Event, are 
to be recorded as an AE or SAE, and recorded on the appropriate CRF.   
 
 
 
C.  Vital S
igns: 
Vital signs include measurements of Height (only at baseline); Body Weight; Pulse (while sitting 
or lying); and Systolic /Diastolic Blood Pressure(s ).  The results will be recorded on the

DATA COLLECTION, QUALITY ASSURANCE, AND MANAGEMENT 
A.  
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB): 
A DSMB will assess the incidence of AKI, death, graft loss, acute cellular rejection (ACR), and 
SAEs in this study.  In addition, other predefined safety variables, (to be defined in the DSMB 
c
harter), will be monitored, in order to minimize potential risks to study participants.  The DSMB 
will
 monitor emerging efficacy and overall safety data to ensure that the benefits and risks of study 
participation remain acceptable.  The DSMB will have access to fully un-blinded data for primary 
and secondary efficacy variables, all SAEs, and other selected AEs of special interest.  The DSMB 
will have the authority to recommend, (to [COMPANY_011] and/or the Cleveland Clinic [the Lead Study 
Site],  the alteration and/or termination of the trial or a treatment group, or cessation of further 
enrollment into one of the treatment groups.

transplantation and/or nephrology, and one independent statistician.  A physician is not allowed to 
participate in this clinical trial while serving on the Board.  Selected efficacy and safety variables 
collected in the study, and detailed in a separate charter will be reviewed on a monthly basis by 
[CONTACT_4318].  The collection and summary of these data points will be prepared in a semi-blinded 
fashion (using dummy treatment codes) by [CONTACT_46134].  The final run of the analysis 
programs will be run by [CONTACT_663433].  The results of the 
analyses will be delivered by [CONTACT_663434].  The members of the study 
team will be blinded from the results.  The members of the Board will be primarily responsible for 
the clinical interpretation of the results.  
 
The board members will also be responsible for advising the investigative team as to whether or 
not any changes need to be made to the conduct of the study.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_663400] 
a separate DSMB charter.  Decisions,  based on the recommendations of the Board,  will take into 
account the potential risks and benefits associated with continuing enrolment of patients in to the 
study.  Such information and recommendations will be used in the best interest of the patients 
already enrolled in the trial.  The final decision, with respect to modification of any protocol, will 
be
 made by [CONTACT_663435].  In the event of 
stud
y termination, all health authorities and investigators will be notified of the termination, within 
tw
o (2) business days.  
B
.  Data Entry and Review  
During the study, a representative from the primary Study S ite will visit each site regularly to 
monitor the progress of enrollment or through monthly conference calls.  The Investigator at each 
S
tudy Site must maintain a Study Binder/File for each patient enrolled in the study.  The “original” 
signed Informed Consent Form (ICF) will be kept in each subject’s Study Binder/File.  In addition, 
source documents, consisting of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_663401], (containing demographic and 
medical information, laboratory data, biopsy reports, visit reports, and other procedure and test 
results and assessments), will be kept in each subject’s Study Binder/File.  All information 
c
ollected on the Case Report Forms (CRFs) must be traceable to the source documents.  Data not 
requiring a written or electronic record will be defined before study start and will be recorded 
directly on the CRFs, which will be documented as being the source data.  Data will be monitored 
centrally, as entered into the study database.  If it is deemed necessary, a monitor from the primary 
site may visit individual sites for on-site monitoring.  Each Study Site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_663402], to confirm their consistency 
with t
he CRF entries.   
 
C.  Data Collection and Quality Control  
Desig
nated Study Personnel,  (at each Study Site), must enter the information required by [CONTACT_663436] (CRFs).  The information from the paper CRFs will 
then be entered directly into the electronic Database, REDCAP, by [CONTACT_663437] 
e
ach Study Site.  Edit checks and double data entry with verification upon second entry are built 
  
Version 17 (3/27/2017)                          
                                                                                                                                                                41 into specific data items.  Text items (e.g. comments) are entered once.  Queries are sent to the 
investigational site using an electronic data query.  Designated investigational Study Site staff will 
be required to respond to all queries and make any necessary changes to the data.  Other errors or 
omissions are entered on Data Query Forms, which are made accessible to the investigational site 
for resolution.   
 
Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug Referenc e 
List which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system.  Coexistent 
diseases and Adverse Events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical dictionary for regulatory 
activities (MedDRA) terminology.   
 
D.  Handling of Missing Values/Censoring/Discontinuations 
Since the study subjects will be followed for renal function, graft loss, or survival status, the 
subj
ects with missing measurements at [ADDRESS_895659] (LOCF) approach.  
Missing baseline serum creatinine values will be replaced with the most recent available value 
fr
om the pre-transplant period.

Version 17 (3/27/2017)                          
                                                                                                                                                                42  P atient survival at [ADDRESS_895665]-transplant 
 Gr aft survival at [ADDRESS_895666]-transplant 
 B iopsy-proven acute allograft rejection rates at [ADDRESS_895667]-transplant. 
 AK I (Stage 3 rates) at [ADDRESS_895668]-transplant 
 R enal f unction measured by [CONTACT_663438] [ADDRESS_895669]-transplant  
 Micr obiologically-proven systemic infection rates at [ADDRESS_895670]-
tra
nsplant 
 He patitis C viral loads (in HCV positive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) at [ADDRESS_895671]-transplant 
 I ncidence of biopsy proven recurrence of HCV infection at [ADDRESS_895672]-transplan t  
 I ncidence of AEs and SAEs at [ADDRESS_895673]-transplant 
 
For each efficacy event, simple event rate estimates (proportion of events) at 12 months will be 
obtained, and event rates between the two treatment groups will be compared using Z-statistic 
based, two-sided, 95% confidence interval for RC – RE, where RC and RE are the event rates for 
the 
Early CNI treated Control Group and the Late CNI Initiated/Thymoglobulin® Study Group, 
re
spectively.  In addition, for the composite efficacy endpoint and its components, individually, 
Ka
plan-Meier survival methods will be used to estimate probabilities of efficacy events by [CONTACT_765].  
Greenwood’s formula will be used to estimate standard errors and to derive the two-sided, 95% 
c
onfidence interval of RC – RE, by [CONTACT_233184].  HCV replication in HCV positive patients will 
be compared with summary statistics.   
 
Due to the short duration of study involvement, we expect very few patients to be lost to follow-
up, or to withdraw consent.  Therefore, for the composite efficacy endpoint, patients who are 
disconti
nued from the study for these two reasons, (prior to the incidence of death, graft loss, or 
biops
y-proven acute cellular rejection ), will not be considered as efficacy failures.  If there are an  
a
dequate number of subjects from each clinical center, a formal test of center by [CONTACT_663439].   
Adverse Events (AEs) / Infections:  
Ge
nerally, infections are analyzed together with Adverse Event data.  In addition, infections will 
be analyzed separately.  Infections will be documented on both, the Infection CRF and the 
AE CRF.  The data collected on both CRFs will be coded with the MedDRA dictionary which 
gives preferred term and body system information.   
 
Adverse Event and Infection data are to be analyzed as a whole under the heading of “Adverse 
Events” for each treatment group.  The incidence of Adverse Events will be summarized by [CONTACT_366848] 
s
ystem, severity, and  causal relationship to Study Drug.  All information pertaining to Adverse 
Events,  noted during the study, will be listed by [CONTACT_4676].  Verbatim details, provided by [CONTACT_663440], are to include: 
 T he preferred term  
 T he body system  
 S tart Dates / End Dates 
 S everity  
 Relationship to Study Drug

Initial Dose of Study Drug, for those subjects randomized to Group 1/Arm 1  of the Study. 
Infection data will be further coded with SNOMED for micro-organism cultured and type of 
infection, (viral, bacterial, fungal, etc. ).  The incidence rate of infection ( by [CONTACT_663441]-
organism) will also be tabulated for each treatment group. 
 
L
aboratory Data:   
Abnormal laboratory values, according to notable criteria, will be identified.  A by-pa tient listing 
of laboratory data, for patient/lab abnormalities, will be generated.  Laboratory values, outside the 
c
linical ly notable and expanded limits, will be flagged.  Appropriate incidence rates of clinically 
notable
 abnormalities will be provided by [CONTACT_3148].  Further, for each laboratory parameter, a 
table summarizing the by [CONTACT_663442], (MDRD eGFR and serum creatinine),  will be 
provided.

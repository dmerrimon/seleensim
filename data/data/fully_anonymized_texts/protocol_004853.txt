This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to US 
and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference 
on Harmonization guidelines), applicable governm ent regulations and Institutional research policies and 
procedures.  
1.1 Background  
As life expectancy improves in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), CF -related co -morbidities are receiving 
increasing attention —they not only impose additional medical burd en but may also compromise 
pulmonary health.  CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is one such co -morbidity:  a n estimated 26 % of 10 -20 
year olds and 40-50% of adults with CF have CFRD (1,2).  Risk factors include female sex, pancreatic 
insufficiency and F508 -homozygous genotype (3-5). 
CFRD is associated with up to a 6 -fold greater mortality  (6).  In the 1980’s, <25% of CFRD patients 
survived to age 30 years compared to  60% of non -diabetic CF subjects (7).  CFRD is also associated with 
worse clinical status as indicated by [CONTACT_504551], increased acute pulmonary exacerbation 
rates, greater prevalence of important sputum pathogens, and poorer nutritional status (4).  Gradual BMI 
and lung function decreases may occur up to [ADDRESS_649675] diagnosis (8). 
The mechanisms linking CFRD with worse outcomes are not fully delineated, but likely involve direct  
damaging effects of h yperglycemia as well as catabolism promoted by [CONTACT_504552].  T he negative 
impact of CFRD on nutrition is underscored by [CONTACT_504553] 5 -year survival in the general CF population 
with ideal body weight <85% versus those with ideal body weight >85 %(9).  Moreover, the rate of 
pulmo nary deterioration over a 4 -year period correlates with the degree of insulin deficiency at 
baseline (10).  These findings reinforce the link between loss of insulin’s potent anabolic effects and 
clinical deterioration (11). 
Importantly, insulin therapy improves nutritional status and pulmonary function in people with CFRD and 
perhaps even in those with less severe defects in glucose regulation.  Small studies suggest insulin 
therapy improves or stabilizes pulmonary function and augments nutritional status in CFRD (12,13)  and in 
CF patients with deteriorating clinical status but ele vated casual blood glucose despi[INVESTIGATOR_504526] (OGTT) (14).  A randomized trial found insulin therapy was associated with 
sustained BMI increases in subjects with CFRD without fasting hyperglycemia (15)—suggesting earlier 
CFRD intervention may have long -term benefit.  
While the insulin deficiency that underlies development of CFRD has traditionally been considered a 
product of “collateral damage” (pancreatic exocrine damage extending to pancreatic islets), new evidence 
points to similarities between CFRD and the insulin secretion defects of T2D:  
 Retrospective immunohistochemical studies of islets from patients with CF suggest reductions in -cell 
mass are variable and do not correlate with the diagnosis of CFRD  (16-18). 
 Reductions in β -cell mass are found in obese and lean adults with T2D (19). 
 Deposition of islet amyloid, a β -cell apoptosis mediator and endoplasmic reticulum stress marker, is 
found in CFRD, CF -related impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (20), and T2D but in neither T1D nor 
diabetes of chronic pancreatitis (21). 
 Twin studies suggest genetic modifiers play a substantial role in CFRD (22), most obviously by a 
variant in the gene harboring transcription factor 7 –like 2 (TCF7L2) (23).  These variations within 
TCF7L2 (24-26) are also  the strongest genetic associations w ith T2D reported to date, and furthermore 
are robustly associated with T2D in all major racial groups (27-42) 
 Decreased sec retion of incretins (43), hormones secreted by [CONTACT_504554], and impaired incretin -augmented insulin secretion (44) are found in T2D and 
potentially in CF(45). 
 Decreas ed incretin -stimulated insulin secretion (via direct effect  (46,47)  or at the receptor level (48,49) ) 
and impaired conversion of pro -insulin to insulin (50) may underlie the link between TCF7L2 variants  
and T2D.  
[Effect of chronic incretin -based therapy in CF]   Page 3 
Version:  5.[ADDRESS_649676] 
as in T2D, the present study will determine whether early intervention with incretin -based therapy using 
the DPP -4 inhibitor sitagliptin  (Januvia® ) to raise endogenous levels of the incretin hormones glucagon -
like peptide -1 (GLP -1) and glucose -dependent insulinotrophic polypeptide (GIP) for a [ADDRESS_649677].  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Sitagliptin  (Januvia®)  is an oral DPP -4 inhibitor approved in 2006 for treatment of Type 2 Diabetes.  Daily 
dosing of 100 mg sustains ≥ 80% inhibition of DPP4 and results in ≥ 2 -fold increases in levels of active 
GLP-17-36 amide  and GIP following meal ingestion  (51,52) .  These actions are associated with enhanced 
glucose -dependent insulin secretion and glucagon inhibition as seen with GLP -1 administration, but 
without marked effects on satiety or gastric emptying.   Thus, DPP -4 inhibition provides similar glucose 
lowering, and is better tolerated than presently available GLP -1 analogs without affecting  body weight  
(53,54) . 
1.3 Clinical Data to Date  
Please refer to appendix  1 for sitagliptin (Januvia ®) labeling.    
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
The dose  of sitagliptin  (Januvia®)  will be 100 mg orally each morning.  Hypoglycemia is not expected with 
the use of sitagliptin alone because its effects on insulin secretion are glucose dependent; nonetheless, 
incidence of hypoglycemia will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_504555] 
a study gluco meter provided to the subjects.  Subjects with CFRD who may be receiving oral 
hypoglycemic agents or insulin therapy and performing more frequent glucose monitoring will have their 
oral agent or insulin doses assessed throughout their participation and adj usted as needed to avoid 
hypoglycemia.  A rare association between sitagliptin use and pancreatitis has been reported by [CONTACT_504556] -marketing surveillance .  However, the documented rate of pancreatitis occurring among 
patients treated with sitagliptin is 0.1 0%, which is comparable to control cohorts (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.5 -2.0), 
making the likelihood of such an event extremely unlikely in this trial  (55).  Nevertheless, subjects will be 
instructed to immediately stop the study medication and contact [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_504527] y abdominal pain.   Rare post -marketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions have also 
been reported with sitagliptin use.  Subjects will receive their first dose under observation in the Clinical & 
Translational Research Center, and be instructed to immed iately stop their study medication and contact 
[CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_504528].      
[ADDRESS_649678].  
 
Primary Hypothesis: Exposure to the dipeptidyl  peptidase -4 (DPP -4) inhibitor, sitagliptin, which inhibits 
enzymatic cleavage of incretin hormones and raises levels of endogenous GLP -[ADDRESS_649679] will be evaluated using a 
randomized, placebo -controlled, doub le-blind clinical trial of 6 months duration.  The role of incretins in 
insulin secretion defects in CF is poorly defined.  To capture early insulin secretion defects, subjects with 
indeterminate glucose tolerance (Ind -GT) and impaired glucose tolerance (I GT) will be studied in addition 
to those with early CFRD defined by [CONTACT_504557] (FH).  The glucose -potentiated 
arginine (GPA) test will be used as the “gold -standard” assessment of β -cell secretory capacity and 
[Effect of chronic incretin -based therapy in CF]   Page 4 
Version:  5.[ADDRESS_649680] (MMTT) will 
be used to assess incretin secretion since fat is an important secretagogue for GLP -1 and gastric 
inhibitory polypeptide GIP and, in the setting of pancreatic insufficienc y, incretin secretion may be 
compromised even with appropriate pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.   
 
Exploratory Objective  
To compare β -cell secretory capacity and incretin secretion in non -diabetic CF subjects homozygotes for 
either the TCF7L2 T2D -conferring T allele  or the wild -type C allele of SNP rs7903146 . 
 
Exploratory Hypothesis: Nondiabetic CF subjects homozygous for the TCF7L2 T2D -conferring T allele  
have reduced β -cell secretory capacity and decreased incretin secretion compared to non -diabetic  
subjects homozygous for the wild -type C allele.  
 
Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_504529]7L2  and the approximately top ten other T2D GWAS -implicated genes  is being 
performed in individuals from the Adult and Pediatric CF Centers, and the association of these genotypes 
with measures of insulin and incretin secretion derived from the current study will be examined.  We will 
also extend our understanding of th e TCF7L2  locus  in CFRD by [CONTACT_504558] a function of TCF7L2  genotype.  These studies in a CF population whose 
metabolic phenotype is carefully delineated will provide additional insights into CFRD risk and potential 
mechanisms.  
 
[ADDRESS_649681] using the two hour OGTT, and 
four glucose tolerance groups can be  defined (normal, Indeterminate: 1 -hr OGTT plasma glucose ≥ 155 
mg/d L and 2 -hr OGTT plasma glucose < 140 mg/dL, impaired glucose tolerance: 2 -hr OGTT plasma 
glucose 140 -199 mg/dL, CFRD 2hr OGTT plasma glucose ≥ 200mg/dL).  As pi[INVESTIGATOR_280915], p ancreatic 
insufficient CF  subjects (n=36) will be recruited: [ADDRESS_649682] without fasting hyperglycemia  (FH).  All subjects will  be randomized 
to two groups of 18 ( 6 months of sitagliptin 100 mg daily or placebo  therapy ).  Glucose -potentiated 
arginine test  and a mixed meal tolerance test will be obtained at baseline and following [ADDRESS_649683] as a measure of  β-cell sensitivity to glucose .

5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
Sitagliptin  (Januvia®)  is an oral DPP -4 inhibitor approve d in 2006 for type 2 diabetes to improve glycemic 
control.   
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
Subjects will be randomized to daily dosing of 100 mg tablets of sitagliptin for 6 months or a matching 
placebo.   
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomized equall y to two groups of 18 (Sitagliptin 100 mg daily vs. placebo).  Sitagliptin 
and placebo will be prepared by [CONTACT_504565] (IDS) .  
Randomization will be performed centrally by [CONTACT_504566].   Balance between treatment arms  will be maintained 
by [CONTACT_504567] (Ind -GT, IGT, CFRD w/o FH).    
5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
[COMPANY_006] Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of [COMPANY_006] & CO., INC.,  will prepare sitagliptin 100mg tablets 
and matching placebo tabletes.  Drug and placebo will be distributed by [CONTACT_18103].   Patients will be randomized 
to receive sitagliptin (Januvia®) or placebo, which will be self -administered by [CONTACT_504568].

of observation or unless a clinical emergency or adverse event requires unblinding of treatment 
assignment . 
5.9 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return  
5.9.1  Receipt of Drug Supplies  
Upon receipt of the of the study treatment supplies, an inventory will be performed and a drug receipt log 
filled out and signed by [CONTACT_17247].  It is important tha t the designated study staff 
counts and verifies that the shipment contains all the items noted in the shipment inventory.  Any 
damaged or unusable study drug in a given shipment (active drug or comparator) will be documented in 
the study files.  The inves tigator will notify [COMPANY_006]  of any damaged or unusable study treatment  supplies . 
5.9.2  Storage  
All medications will be stored by [CONTACT_504570] a 
secure location.  Sitagliptin and placebo will be at room temperature, light protected, and in a tightly 
closed container.  A member of the Investigational Drug Service staff will monitor the study medication 
storage area for temperature consistency.  Documentation of temperature monitoring will be maintained.  
5.9.3  Dispensing of Study Drug  
Regular study drug reconciliation will be performed to document drug assigned, drug consumed, and drug 
remaining.  This reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, and signed and dated by [CONTACT_58860].  All subje cts will receive a patient medication information sheets upon randomization.   
5.9.4  Return or Destruction of Study Drug  
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of drug shipped, drug consumed, and 
drug remaining.  This reconciliation  will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed and dated.  Any 
discrepancies noted will be investigated, resolved, and documented prior to return or destruction of 
unused study drug.  Drug destroyed on site will be documented in the study files.

7 Statis tical Plan  
7.1 Database Design, Data Collection and Management:  
We will design and maintain a single data collection and management database using REDCap  
(Research Electronic Data Capture), a secure web -based clinical and research database. The database 
will incorporate range checks and between -variables consistency checks to ensure that errors are 
captured and corrected in real time.  The database will be  password -protected, stored, and backed up 
daily.  REDCap allows for automated export procedures, including download to commonly used statistical 
packages (SAS, Stata, R).  After export, all data will be rechecked by [CONTACT_504577].  
7.[ADDRESS_649711] design using  both the function “sampsi” in Stata v 12.0 and the 
PASS 2011 software (Hintze, J.  PASS 11. NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, UT, www.ncss.com ; 2011).  Assuming 
a strong, but not unreasonable, intra -class correlations of 0.[ADDRESS_649712] a one -SD difference in the second -phase insulin response.  Previous work from our group 
suggests that among normal subjects, one SD in this response equates to 0.06 (muU/ml)/(mg/dl) (58), and 
in unpublished data we have documented two -SD differences between grou ps of islet transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
7.[ADDRESS_649713] descriptive summaries (e.g. 
means and standard deviations for continuous variables such as age and percentages for categorical 
variables such as gender).  For the various study measures, means, standard deviations, 95% confidence 
intervals, medians, and minimum and maximum values (depending upon normality) will be tabulated and 
reported for all continuous outcome variables by [CONTACT_2060].  Outliers will be sought using graphical 
inspection.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of th e University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_504578]: Baseline, peak and nadir glucose, insulin, GIP, GLP -1, and glucagon will be determined for each 
subject; a number of change scores (e.g., change from baseline to peak) and AUC wi ll be calculated.  
 
GPA Test: The acute insulin response to arginine (AIR arg), a measure of first -phase insulin release, is 
calculated as the mean of 2, 3, 4, and 5 -minute insulin levels minus the mean of -5 and -1 minute insulin 
levels.  The response during the 230 mg/dl glucose clamp enables determination of glucose potentiation  
of arginine -induced insulin release (AIR pot) and is maximal during the 340 mg/dl glucose clamp (AIR max); 
providing a measure  of -cell secretory capacity that estimate s functional -cell mass.  Between 60 -
250mg/dl  the magnitude of AIR arg is a linear funct ion of plasma glucose .  The glucose -potentiation slope 
(GPS) is calculated as the difference in acute insulin responses at fasted and 230 mg/dl glucose levels 
divided by [CONTACT_504579]: (AIR pot - AIR arg )/ΔPG.  As a measure of second -phas e 
insulin response and β -cell sensitivity to glucose , the difference between insulin levels during the 230 
mg/dl glucose clamp and fasting will be divided by [CONTACT_504580].  β -cell 
sensitivity to glucose will be further ass essed as the PG 50, the PG level at which half -maximal insulin 
secretion is achieved, using the y -intercept (b) of the GPS to solve the equation ½(AIR max) = (GPS ∙ PG 50) 
+ b.   
 
The primary outcome measure  will be the change in second -phase insulin response  derived from the 
GPA test.  This change represents the slope over time in two -dimensions of insulin (y) and glucose (x).  
Treatment effectiveness, the relative influence of sitagliptin on levels and slope of insulin to glucose, will 
be assessed using “as randomized” (intention -to-treat) analysis, in which the key contrast will be a 
nonparametric comparison of changes in slope over time.  Differences in slopes over time will be 
estimated using two -group Mann -Whitney methods.  To take advantage of improved e fficiency in a 
statistical model that adjusts for subject -level covariates and to benefit from the strong correlation of slope 
within a subject over time, an alternative analysis will use linear regression models with the slope as the 
outcome, time (baseli ne and after intervention) and treatment as main effects, and time -by-treatment 
interaction as the estimate of interest.  This model will use generalized estimating equation methods to 
obtain robust variance estimates that will account for possible non -normality of slope measures. 
Secondary analysis will adjust for non adherence to sitagliptin therapy.  Using methods outlined by 
[CONTACT_504581] (59) and extended to longitudinal settings by [CONTACT_84089] (60), we will estimate the impact of 
sitagliptin among those who adhered to therapy, without the bias inherent in as treated or per -protocol 
analyses.  Adherence -adjusted methods will not likely change statistical significance of c ontrasts with 
placebo, but these methods will estimate the expected impact of therapy under ideal conditions.  
7.[ADDRESS_649714] Population(s) for Analysis  
Recruitment of 1 2 subjects per glucose intolerance group (Ind -GT, IGT and CFRD without FH) is planned.   
 
Any s ubject who was randomized and received the protocol required study drug exposure and required 
protocol processing will be subjected to the study analysis – both for the primary analysis and any 
applicable secondary analyses.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused b y the 
procedures involved in the research)

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of th e University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_30292]   Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be  adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by [CONTACT_417563] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or significant disability or  incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require  intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result 
in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined a s the period from 
the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study 
treatment follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_649715] administration of study treatment.   
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during 
the study period.  
 
General Physical Examin ation Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the 
end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an 
adverse event must also be rec orded and documented as an adverse event.   
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the 
subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The 
investigator should notif y the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a 
subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  
The sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of 
[Effect of chronic incretin -based therapy in CF]   Page 16 
Version:  5.[ADDRESS_649716] that has participated 
in this study.  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the following  
conditions is met:   
 The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
 The abnormality suggests a disease an d/or organ toxicity  
 The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, 
etc. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504538] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any 
condition responsible for surgery should be  documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the 
criteria for and adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse 
event in the following circumstances:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a 
preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842].  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it 
is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] a dmissions as judged by [CONTACT_106335].  
8.[ADDRESS_649717] seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all advers e events should be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report 
form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should 
recorded in the source d ocument, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the s tudy treatment or 
participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period 
must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
study period and is conside red to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should 
be recorded and reported immediately  
8.3 Investigator reporting: notifying the Penn IRB  
All adverse events that are not serious will be summarized and reported to the DSMB and the UPenn IRB 
annually at the time of the continuing review.  
Reports of the following problems adverse events will be made to the DSMB and UPenn IRB within 10 
working days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event:  
 Any a dverse event (regardles s of whether the event is serious or non -serious, on -site or off -site) 
that occurs any time which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_58812]:  
Unexpected  (An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately reflected 
in the pr otocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any applicable 
investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent document and other 
relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts.)

opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was more likely than not to be caused by 
[CONTACT_28821].)  
 
Reporting Process  
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported to the UPenn 
IRB using the form: “Unanticipated Problems Posing Risks to Subjects or Others Including Reportable 
Adverse Events” or as a written report of the event ( including a description of the event with information 
regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, follow -up/resolution and need for revision to consent form 
and/or other study documentation).  
 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_504539] n and receipt will be kept in the Clinical 
Investigator’s study file.  
 
Other Reportable events:  
For clinical drug trials, the following events are also reportable to the UPenn IRB:  
 Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a s erious unexpected 
adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as agranulocytosis, hepatic 
necrosis, Stevens -Johnson syndrome).  
 Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the inv estigators brochure, protocol or  
informed co nsent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_65804].  
 Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms of 
severity or frequency. For example:  
– An interim analysis indicat es that participants have a lower rate of response to treatment than 
initially expected.  
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than 
initially expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research study is of no 
therapeutic value.  
 Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or biologic used in 
a research protocol.  
 Breach of confidentiality  
 Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a 
research participant.  
 Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C 
and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the s tudy.  
 Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot 
be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
 Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved 
protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the investigator placed one or more participants at increased risk, or 
affects the rights or welfare of subjects.  
 
8.4 Unblinding Procedures  
This is a double blind  study .  Should an unexpected serious adverse event occur, that can be attributed to 
the dru g, e.g.—pancreatitis , a report will be sent to the DSMB and they will determine if un blinding  is 
necessary.

Drs. Rickels and Kelly  will oversee the safety of this protocol.  This safety monitoring will include careful 
assessment and ap propriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the implementation 
of the data & safety monitoring plan below.  A separate data & safety monitoring board  will include a 
regular assessment of the number and type s of serious adverse events.  
 
8.5.[ADDRESS_649718] (DSMB) —Interim monitoring and analysis  
A data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be established: (1) to protect study patients, (2) to safeguard 
their interests, (3) to monitor  the overall conduct of the trial, (4) to help protect the integrity of the trial and 
the data, and (5) to supervise the conduct of any interim analyses.  Specific rules and protocols for all 
reviews will be established in a formal protocol, and approved b y the DSMB in its charter, prior to the first 
DSMB meeting.  The DSMB will work jointly with the trial statisticians and clinical investigators to 
establish specific criteria to accomplish its tasks.  The DSMB  will consist of at least three  members 
includi ng an endocrinologist, a pulmonologist with expertise in CF, and a senior faculty member with 
exper tise in clinical research  who will serve as  chair.   
 
In accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards, the Project investigators will establish 
procedures for identifying classes of AEs, documenting them on an Adverse Experience Report (AER) 
form, and then reporting them regularly to DSMB.   
 
The DSMB will meet annually to review efficacy issues and adverse events, and will have additional 
conference  calls as needed.  Annual reports will be prepared for them by [CONTACT_504583].  The DSMB will report to the trial investigators within one month of the start of the DSMB meeting, 
or earlier if patient safety becomes an issue.  Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_504540]; owing to the small sample size, there will be no formal early 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_504541].   
 
DSMB reporting: Independence of DSMB and study trial leadership  
 
All data  and the interim analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_504584], 
independently from the trial leadership and staff.  The DSMB report will consist of the following elements:

9.1 Data Collection and Management  
All information that is collected for this research protocol will be kept confidential .  All subjects will be 
assigned a unique study identification number (Study ID)  at the start of the protocol.  This study ID will be 
used on all study related paperwork.  Any data that is entered into an electronic format will only use the 
study ID.  In addition, all files will be kept on a secure server or in a locked cabinet access ible only to 
approved study team members.  A master subject list will be maintained by [CONTACT_3476], in a separate 
[Effect of chronic incretin -based therapy in CF]   Page 19 
Version:  5.[ADDRESS_649720] of 
1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the 
following:  
 
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and wh y 
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.   
The Investigator and study team will not use such data and records for any purpose other than 
conducting the study.  
9.3 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evalua tion of the trial.  Source data are contained in 
source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharm acy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_19093], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm 
or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kep t at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at 
medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
9.4 Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data 
requested on the CRF must be r ecorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is 
left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is 
not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be pri nted legibly in black ink.  If any 
entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry 
and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR 
WHITE OUT E RRORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the 
item, then initial and date it.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of th e University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_30292]  9.6.1  Potential risks associated with sitagliptin use  
Potential risks associated with sitagliptin use  are all considered rare and  include hypoglycemia, 
hypersensitivity reactions, and pancreatitis.   
Hypoglycemia is not expected with the use of sitagliptin alone because its effects on insulin secretion are 
glucose dependent; nonetheless, incidence of hypo glycemia will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_504586] a study glucometer provided to the subjects.  Subjects with CFRD who 
may be receiving oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin therapy and performing more frequent glucose 
monitoring will have their oral agent or insulin doses assessed throughout their participation and adjusted 
as needed to avoid hypoglycemia .   
Cases of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin have been reported in post -
marketin g surveillance .  These reactions have included anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin 
conditions , and subjects with a history of experiencing any of these reactions will be excluded from 
participating in this study.  Additional information from Merc k that is provided in Appendix [ADDRESS_649722] dose, which in this study will be 
administered  under medical supervision in the Clinical & Translational Research Center.  The majority of 
reports characterized as angioedema or skin rash were considered to be mild and non -serious.  Subjects 
will be instructed to immediately stop their study medication and contact [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_504543] .  
Cases of acute pancreatitis have also been reported with sitagliptin use  in post -marketing surveillance .  
Pancreatitis is not anticipated in the pancreatic insufficient CF population targeted in this study as acinar  
tissue is necessary for the occurrence of pancreatitis.  Pancreatitis in CF begins in utero and destruction 
of pancreatic parenchyma is a rapid and painless process that is generally complete by [CONTACT_504587]  (61,62) . This process is in contrast to the pancreatitis that may occur in patients with pancreatic 
sufficient CF, which generally  occurs in patients with milder mutations (63), or in subjects with chronic 
pancreatitis who are heterozygote or homozygote for CFTR mutations but lack sinopulmonary and other 
features of CF (64,65) .  All of the subjects participating in the present study will have classic CF with 
sinopu lmonary disease and pancreatic insufficiency where we estimate the risk of pancreatitis to be 0.  
This population of CF comprises ~ 80% of both our pediatric and adult clinical practices where no cases 
of pancreatitis have been observed.  In the remaining ~ 20% of CF patients with pancreatic sufficiency, 
and so excluded by [CONTACT_504588], there are ~ 2 patients out of 100 experiencing an epi[INVESTIGATOR_504544].  In addition to excluding from participation those CF patients with any risk f or 
pancreatitis, subjects will also be screened and monitored for signs/symptoms and biochemical evidence 
of pancreatitis.  The study team will review side effects after the first week and then monthly with 
participants.  Subjects who develop abdominal pai n will be instructed to stop their study medication and 
contact [CONTACT_504589].  As specified above, serum amylase and lipase will be 
obtained at baseline, [ADDRESS_649723] of 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a new Warning and Precaution 
about the risk of joint pain that can be severe and disabling to the labels of all me dicine in the drug class 
called dipeptidyl peptidase -4 (DPP -4) inhibitors.  Twenty -eight  cases have been reported  since [ADDRESS_649724] is used to annually screen for diabetes and impairments in glucose 
regulation in children and adults in routine clinical practice.  The MMTT is a similar study but instead of 
administering pure glucose , a physiologic meal consisting of carbohydrates, fat and protein is consumed.  
Additional intermediate blood draws will be performed for glucose, insulin, GLP -1, GIP, C -peptide and 
glucagon.  Because of these intermediate time  points for blood collection, an intravenous line will be

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of th e University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_504590], which can be associated with discomfort and a small risk of infection.  The use of EMLA cream is 
optional to minimize discomfort to the study participant.  Experienced research nurses will p erform the 
MMTT in the outpatient CTRC facilities; MMTT are routinely performed in this setting.  Eleven blood 
samples are required and the volumes of blood will be minimized to reduce the risk of anemia.  
 
The major risk of the mixed meal tolerance test is hypoglycemia.  Hypoglycemia is reported in 20 -25% of 
otherwise healthy individuals who undergo oral glucose tolerance testing, the screening test 
recommended by [CONTACT_405814].  Because fat and protein are ingested with the carbohydrate load 
during the MMTT, hypoglycemia is not anticipated.  However, given the potential of abnormal incretin 
secretion in CF (a phenomenon observed in children with late dumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007] -related hypoglycemia due to 
fundoplication), t racking spontaneous hypoglycemia development will be important.  Moreover, reactive 
hypoglycemia during OGTT and spontaneous hypoglycemia are reported in CF and may be related to 
dysregulated insulin secretion; thus tracking development of hypoglycemia in the setting of the early 
insulin secretory abnormalities may provide further insight into this ‘spontaneous’ hypoglycemia.  Subjects 
will be closely monito red during studies by [CONTACT_504591].   Bedside glucose meters will be used to allow rapid detection and prompt treatment 
of hypoglycemia.  Plasma or blood glucose levels will be measured (from blood drawing IV or by 
[CONTACT_171254]) at any time during the study if symptoms of hypoglycemia occur ( such as tremors, sweating, 
or irritability).  Subjects will be treated with o ral glucose supplementation (e.g . orange juice) if 
symptomatic.   
 
9.6.[ADDRESS_649725] can produce reactive hypoglycemia fo llowing termination of the 
glucose infusion.  This  is unlikely in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, and the risk is further 
minimized by [CONTACT_504592] 230 mg/dl glucose clamp, and ingestion of lunch 
together with periodic glucose monitoring after the 340 mg/dl glucose clamp.  Hypoglycemia can thus be 
easily averted by [CONTACT_504593].  If plasma glucose levels decrease to ≤ 65 mg/dL, the 
glucose  infusion will be resumed to prevent any further decrease and the  development of any symptoms.  
All subjects will be closely monitored until blood glucose levels are stable within normal limits before 
discharge from the CTRC.   
 
Intravenously administered arginine may cause a transient metallic taste in the mouth, and l ess often a 
transient sensation of warmth; allergy is rare . 
9.6.4  Potential risks associated with multiple blood sampling  
Blood sampling during the MMTT (65 mL), GPA test (90 mL * 2), genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], safety assessments and 
HbA1c will involve approximately 245 mL for  this protocol , which is <450 ml per 6 week period 
recommended by [CONTACT_18121].  Subjects with moderate anemia (hemoglobin concentration < 10 g/dl) will be 
excluded from participation . 
9.6.[ADDRESS_649726] eadily increases such that by [CONTACT_654] 30 y, 40 -50% of adults with CF have CFRD.  CFRD is 
associated with typi[INVESTIGATOR_504545], 
worse pulmonary function, and increased mortality.  Thus, enrollment  in this study is likely to improve our 
understanding of the mechanisms underlying insulin deficiency in CF and the role of incretin -based 
therapy in improving β -cell function. Participants may also enjoy meaningful indirect benefit by

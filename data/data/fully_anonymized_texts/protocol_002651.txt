Protocol Version 8   Background and Significance:  
  One in five adolescents in the U.S. is obese3.  It has been theorized that overeating may have addictive 
qualities4, 5, and there is a growing body of literature which demonstrates that craving for drugs and drive for 
food share similar hypothalamic pathways as seen on functional MRI (fMRI) studies1, 2. A recent study by 
[CONTACT_164211]. reported the prevalence of adole scents meeting the criteria for food addiction as 30.7%, well 
above the 15% –19% range observed in adults seeking obesity treatment6. Intere stingly, few weight 
management interventions have tested therapeutic techniques founded in addiction medicine princip les to 
date7.    
  The general consensus  is that clinical interventions for adolescent obesity require intensive 
management with multidisciplinary teams, frequent visits, and many contact [CONTACT_164212] 3. These programs often 
address nutritional, physical activity , and behavioral topi[INVESTIGATOR_164179] a handful of behaviors (e.g., selfmonitoring 
of weight, consistent physical activity, regular eating patterns). However, the high prevalence of pediatric, as 
well as adult, obesity precludes this as a practical strategy to combat obesity8. Advances in mobile heal th 
technologies (mHealth) offer an opportunity to monitor various behaviors, such as food consumption, and to 
deliver interventions in the adolescent’s natural environment9-12.Thus, mHealth platforms may be a cost sa ving 
alternative to an in -clinic intervention for pediatric weight management9, 13.   
  Pretlow et al. reported an intervention which applied conventional addiction intervention methods to 
obesity in adolescents and was embodied as an iPhone® app7. To date , this addiction based mHealth program 
has been tested in two pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602]. The first was performed in a self -selected cohort of 47 obese young 
people between 12 -21 years of age and demonstrated that a food withdrawal approach was feasible to 
implement in  a community based population without undue risk to participants and was useful in pro moting 
weight loss7, 14. The results from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_164180] a 7% decrease in the percent over the 50th 
percentile of BMI upon completion of the intervention7.   
  
  The second pi[INVESTIGATOR_164181] a tertiary care 
weight management clinic. A total of 50 adolescents were recruited; 18 youth self -selected to participate in the 
app intervention, the 32 youth that de clined to participate functioned as contemporary controls who received 
intensive weight management intervention via a multi -disciplinary in -clinic intervention. Mean age of 
participants was 14.4 years (range, 12.3 -17.9).  The female to male ratio, racial/e thnic  distribution and zBMI at 
baseline were comparable between groups; app participants had a significant decrease in zBMI at 3 and 6 
months, compared to control. There was a statistically significant difference in zBMI between the app and 
control upon co mpletion of the intervention (p=0.03). App participants had higher retention (100% vs. 37%) and 
lower total cost per patient ($760.00 vs. $1,428.00) than the control. An addiction medicine -based mHealth 
intervention, embodied as a smartphone app with telep hone coaching, targeted for adolescents, reduced zBMI 
better than in -clinic controls and appears to be a cost -effective, timely and labor -saving method for adolescent 
weight management.   
  
  Although these results are encouraging, they arise from relative ly small, time limited studies, which 
lacked a ‘routine care’ group and incorporated potential biases in selecting the control population. In addition, 
the effect of coaching on weight loss in adolescents, independent of the app intervention itself, was un able to 
be elucidated. There is a growing body of literature to suggest that incentivized coaching alone may be an 
effective technique for weight loss in this population15, 16. Health coachi ng is a personalized approach that is 
being widely used to improve  health behaviors in patients with obesity. In adolescents, health coaching is a 
promising strategy that promotes healthy behaviors, goal setting and increased self -efficacy17, 18.  Although 
data from randomized clinical trials in adolescents are limited a  health coaching behavior modification program 
alone may be an effective, low -cost, personalized and flexible program that can be implemented through 
clinical settings.   
  
[ADDRESS_190530] of an addiction -based weight loss mHealth intervention with 
personalized coaching.  Specifically, the proposed multi -site randomized controlled trial (RCT) tests will test the 
efficacy of an  interactive addiction model based mobile health (mHealth) weight -loss intervention with 
personalized phone -coaching (AppCoach) compared to 1) interactive addiction model ba sed mHealth 
weightloss intervention alone (App) or 2) Multidisciplinary in -clinic w eight management program (Clinic).   
  
  The RCT will include youth regardless of their underlying co -morbidities because the targeted 
behaviors and weight management strategies are relevant and beneficial for all overweight and obese 
adolescents. Not only  does this delivery modality remove many barriers (e.g., transportation, missed school 
days) that impact access and attrition in conventional, outpatient obesity interventions, but it strategically 
addresses underlying addictive eating behaviors to better support habit -formation in youth in the ir day -to-day 
environment. Assessment of the intervention’s effect on zBMI, %BMI p95, fasting metabolic parameters, 
addictive eating habits, executive function, and motivation for change will be obtained at enrollment,  3, 6, 12 
and 18 months ([ADDRESS_190531] intervention follow up).  Another key aim of the study is to conduct a real -life 
economic analysis (costs, cost -savings and non -monetary benefits) of delivering the app with personalized 
phone - coaching compared to mult idisciplinary weight -management. We wil l further explore whether primary 
and secondary outcomes differ by [CONTACT_164213].    
  
   This study is both cl inically and theoretically innovative as the notion of overeating as an addictive 
process in adolescents is still controversial. To our knowledge, this study is the first RCT to explore the efficacy 
of a weight -loss intervention premised on addiction princ iples delivered via mobile health. This study will 
contribute to the development of effective mobile health weight management interventions for use in 
adolescents with obesity. This extended intervention and follow -up (i.e., six mon ths of intervention + on e year 
of follow -up), will provide important information about the maintenance of this intervention. Second, it will aim 
to evaluate the use of mobile health interventions for adolescent obesity with coaching compared to mHealth 
intervention alone. Given t he dearth of intervention options for obese children, the high likelihood that obese 
children will grow into obese adults, and our lack of understanding as to how best to personalize obesity 
interventions to optimize outcomes, this intervention may shift t he approach of management of youth with 
obesity.

Post Study Follow -up Options:   
1. After completion of the 6 -month interventions participants will be offered the following choices for continued 
care:  
a. Participants in groups [ADDRESS_190540] acces s to use the mobile app without coaching upon 
9  
  
Protocol Version 8   completion of the study (post 18 month). Participants will have to own an iPhone in order to use the 
mobile app as it is an IOS App only.   
     
2. All participants will receive a call from a study team member mon thly for the 18 -month study period.  
a. They will discuss weight trends since the intervention completion and any interim health encounters 
(ED visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], PMD visits, changes to medical history).  
b. They will also discuss if any interim weight ma nagement strategies have been utilized or started.  
  
3. All Participants will have an in person/virtual follow up [ADDRESS_190541] consent (baseline) 
where a repeat weigh in and survey completion will occur. All participants will also have a fast ing research 
blood draw at 6 and 18 months.  
  
  
  
Enrollment and Retention:  
  Up to 404 adolescents (plus 1 parent/youth enrolled) will be recruited for the i ntervention arms and 
randomized 1:1:1 via stratified block randomization into one of the followi ng groups: AppCoach, App or Clinic.  
Demographic information will be collected from all participants. During the intervention period the participants 
will not attend an inter -disciplinary in -clinic weight management intervention or any other medically supe rvised 
weight loss programs. If the participants have underlying comorbidities, they will continue to follow with routine 
subspecialty providers for standard of care of each underlying condition. Each participant’s primary care 
provider, regardless of the method in which they were recruited ( including those recruited from the greater LA 
county) upon request from participant, will receive a letter from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_164185] d study period. Parental involvement is not required 
for those participants randomized to the AppCoach or App group; these participants will complete the 
intervention independently with the assistance of the coach (if applicable). Parental involvement is r equired for 
those participants random ized into the In -Clinic group. Upon completion of the intervention, if the participant 
was initially referred to a weight management clinic by [CONTACT_29383], they will be offered 
continued enrollment in th e inter -disciplinary weight management clinic for which they were initially referred. In 
order to further remove barriers to participation, all families who do not have a car will be offered free 
ridesharing transportation (UBER or Lyft) to - and from CHLA.  Additionally, parking validation wil l be offered for 
families to park onsite at CHLA for research and/or intervention visits. To increase retention, participants are 
contact[CONTACT_164218]. Research staff will provide families wit h dates of their 
scheduled assessments/visits. Participants are also given reminder phone calls the day before their 
assessment/visit.  
  
Trial sites:  
A participating trial site must fulfill the following eligibility criteria:  
1) Have an independent weight management clinic that cares for adolescents.   
2) The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_164186]/staff at the site have been trained on, and 
understand, the study protocol.  
3) The site is within mobile phone range on the other hand, a tr ial site will be ineligible if it satisfies one      or 
more of the following conditions:  
1) The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_164187].  
2) The steering committee of the present trial judges the site to be inappropriate to recr uit participants.  
  
Initial trial sites include: CHLA, Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor -UCLA (LA Biomed), 
UCLA, and Cedars Sinai.

be calculated as kilograms per square meter and BMI Z -score (zBMI) and perce nt over the 95th percentile 
(%BMI p95) will be determined utilizing the CDC growth charts.   
  
Physical Activity  
 To evaluate the effect of the intervention arms  on amount of physical activity performed by [CONTACT_146175], each 
youth will complete the physical activity questionnaire and recall their activity level over the last 7 days at each 
study visit.   
  
Measurements (~ 1.5 hour to complete)  
1. Yale Food Addiction Sc ale (YFAS -c, 25 questions, ~7 minutes) : The YFAS -c is a validated measure 
of addictive -like eating behavior based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder V 
diagnostic criteria for substance dependence19, 25, 26. Intervention participant s will complete the YFAS -c at 
consent and at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months.  
2. The Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_141965] (10 questions, ~5 minutes) : The CES -D 
is a short self -report measure used to measure depressive symptoms in the general population20. The scale 
demonstrates strong internal consistency (Cronbach’s α > 0.85), moderate test -retest reliability (>0.50), and 
moderate validity (r > 0.50)20. This will be completed at all in person / WebEx study visits 0,3,6,12, and 18.   
3. The Perceived Stress Scale (14 questions, 10 minutes):  The PSS measures subjective perceptions 
of distress in one’s own life situations. Based on Lazarus’ transactional model of stress and copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the PSS 
assesses how well a person feels they can cope with stressors, rather th an measuring the nature of the 
stressors themselves. The measure has demonstrated strong reliability (r > 0.80) and validity in social and 
health science studies21. This will be completed at all in person/ WebEx study visits 0,3,6,12, and 18.   
4. Health Enco unters (6 questions, 5 minutes):  This brief questionnaire will assess how often the 
participant has utilize health services in the preceding time period.  An official Health Care Encounters 
questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_164217] -person/WebEx study visits at 0,[ADDRESS_190543] consent. Additionally, all participants will receive a call from a study team member monthly during the 
study period. In these calls the study team member will assess weight outcomes, barriers and as k if any 
interim health encounters (physician visits, diagnosis, medication prescribed etc.) have occurred in the 
previous 4 weeks). 5. Intervention Satisfaction Survey (12 questions, ~6 minutes): Both the study 
participant and a family member will complete an interv ention satisfaction survey to be completed at the 6 and 
18 month follow up visits to assess the level of satisfaction with the intervention period and the satisfaction with 
the coaching.   a. Participant Satisfaction  
b. Coach Satisfaction  
c. Parent Satisfactio n  
6. Demographic Questionnaire (15 questions, 6 minutes) :   
a. Age of consenting parent/guardian  
b. Ethnicity  
c. Highest education obtained of consenting parent/guardian  
d. Household Composition  
e. Parent employment status  
f. Fast Food Consumptions Question:  How often di d you eat outside the house in the last [ADDRESS_190544] -food restaurant.  Response options range from  “none” to “[ADDRESS_190545] -food consumption. Guardians 
will also be asked to report the location (e.g., McDonald close to school) and the social context 
in which eating occur (e.g., with school friends).   
7. The  Adolescent Self -Regula tory Inventory (ASRI, 36 questions, ~15 minutes)23: This is a 36 item 
measure that evaluates the degree to which adolescents are able to activate, monitor, maintain, inhibit, and 
13  
  
Protocol Version 8   adapt their emotions, thoughts, attention, and behavior. This will be complet ed at all in person/ WebEx study 
visits 0,3,6,12, and 18.   
8.Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive function 2 (55 questions, 15 minutes)22: The Behavior Rating 
Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF2) provides theoretically and empi[INVESTIGATOR_164193]. The clinical scales form broad indices of behavior and cognition and an 
overall score, the global executive composite (GEC)22. This will be completed at baseline only.   
9. Food Cravings Questionnaire (FCQ , 15 questions, ~5 minutes)24: Scores on the FCQ -T have been 
found to be positively associated with eating pathology, body mass index (BMI), low dieting success and 
increases in state food craving during cognitive tasks involving appealing food stimuli. Th is will be completed at 
all in person/ WebEx study visits 0,3,6,12, and 18.   
10. Binge Eating Disorder Screener (BEDS -7, 7 questions, 4 minutes):  This questionnaire is utilized to 
screen for binge eating disorders. This will be completed at in person/ WebEx s tudy visits 0,6,12, and 18.  
11. Physical Activity Score (PAQ, 12 questions, 4 minutes): This instrument was developed to assess 
general levels of physical activity for adolescents 14 -19 years of age.27 This will be completed at all in person/ 
WebEx study visi ts 0,3,6,12, and 18.   
12. SF-12 Health Survey (12 questions, 3 minutes):  The SF -12 is a practical, reliable and valid measure 
of physical and mental health. It is particularly useful in large population health surveys or for applications that 
combine a generi c and disease -specific health survey. This will be completed at all in person/ WebEx study 
visits 0,3,6,12, and 18.   
13. EQ5D (15 questions, 4 minutes):  EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health 
status. It has been widely used in populat ion health surveys, clinical studies, and economic evaluation and in 
routine outcome measurement in the delivery of operational healthcare. This will be completed at all in 
person/WebEx study visits 0,3,6,12, and 18.    
14. S-Weight (5 item questionnaire, 3 mi nutes): S-Weight is a tool used to determine the individual's stage of 
change. This allows the research team to assess and monitor motivation and readiness for change to determine if baseline leve ls 
promote success in the intervention.   
  
Adherence and Ret ention  
  Data relating to participant interaction with the app and the coach and attendance with scheduled 
research visits will be tracked remotely and stored on HIPAA -compliant central servers. Data will be reported 
on three key components specific to th e underlying addiction model implemented in the intervention: (1) 
‘‘problem foods’’ withdrawal; (2) snacking elimination; and (3) food amount reductions at meals12. We will also 
use strategies (implemented with participants in the intervention arms) that w e have f ound effective for 
retention: (1) providing incentive for participation and adherence; (2) ensuring frequent contacts with all 
participants to maintain engagement and foster open communication; (3) sending email and text reminders 
about face -to-face/WebEx visits; (4) seeking contact [CONTACT_164220]; and (5) Study participants will be invited to participate in two optional audio recorded focus groups 
to: 1) collect information on their experience w ith the study and 2) their understanding of displacement theory 
and their input on the development of a new app based intervention that targets the displacement theory. The 
focus group sessions will last 60 minutes each. As we are recording the sessions, i f a patient’s real name [CONTACT_164236], it will be erased from the transcript and if possible, from the audio -recording. Participants will 
have the option of participating in both or just one of the focus groups in no particular order so long as they  
have co mpleted their 6 -month follow up visit or none. This will help us identify adherence outcomes.   
  
Intervention Groups:  
  
App Intervention Groups (AppCoach and App groups)  
  The specific details of the App intervention have been described by [CONTACT_164221]7. Briefly, the 
intervention will be implemented through an iPhone® app, which will be securely integrated with a 
networkserver for real -time data access and storage7. Problem foods will be defined as specific foods for which 
participants felt they  have cravings, cannot resist when immediately available, and cannot stop eating when 
[ADDRESS_190546], participants will eliminate snacking by 
[CONTACT_164222] (i.e. morning, afternoon, or evening). Once the participant has 
abstained from snacking during their chosen time interval for [ADDRESS_190547] stage, excessive food amounts at  meals will be targeted. Participants wi ll weigh all food 
items served at meals, and an algorithm in the app will gradually reduce each participant’s food amounts to 
result in [ADDRESS_190548] access to the app home 
page, which includes various addiction model strategies, including: motivation, distraction ideas, displacement 
methods and copi[INVESTIGATOR_164194]7.   
  Participants in the AppCoach and App group will be asked to weigh themselves and food daily. All 
participations (AppCoach, App and Clinic) will receive monthly phone calls from the research team to speak 
with either the subje ct or the parent to review any barriers to adherence or technological problems that may 
have occurred with any of the study equipment. All phone conversations will be recorded.   
  
Coaching (AppCoach group)  
  Interactions between coach and participants ar e of three types: face -to-face/WebEx visits, phone calls 
and text messages. Each participant will interact with the coach for 6 months via text messages, 5 days per 
week, weekly phone calls (15 -minute duration) and four one -hour face -to-face visits (at 3, 6, [ADDRESS_190549] baseline visit). Participants will keep track of their progress through the mobile app, throughout the 
intervention; this log will be reviewed with the coach weekly. The face -to-face vi sits (1 baseline consent visit 
and 4 follow up  visits) will be qualitative interviews (of approximately 60 minutes duration), which will occur at 
Visit 2 (month 3), 3 (month 6), 4 (month 12) and 5 (month 18). The semi -structured interviews will include 
questions designed to elicit both positive and ne gative impacts on weight management and identify barriers 
such as emotional eating, displacement behaviors, poor copi[INVESTIGATOR_164195]. 
The interviews will be broadly structured around key domains of life before the interven tion, life during the 
intervention, and anticipated future life. Upon completion of the intervention the participants will be interviewed 
on their own sense of what was important about the intervention in terms of what did/didn’t impact them and 
their thou ghts on how the intervention could be improved.   
  Most of the participant -coach interactions take place through phone calls. Each coach will have a cell 
phone used solely for this study, so that participants may directly contact [CONTACT_164223]. Phone calls and text messages will be utilized for 
appointment reminders, scheduling weekly phone meetings, providing emotional support, following up on items 
discussed in a prior visit or pho ne call30. All interactions are documented in a da tabase created for the study, 
including date, time, type, and duration of contact, topi[INVESTIGATOR_139431], and any relevant notes. The coach will 
utilize a motivational interviewing paradigm to interact with the participants, and an electronic system within the 
app database to document each encounter. All phone conversations, for those in the AppCoach group, will be 
audio recorded. In addition, AV will attend 1 coaching session per month for intervention fidelity assessment in 
real time with the coaches.  
  
Addiction Model Based Coaching Curriculum:  
  The curriculum is founded on three principles of addiction medicine:1) Divide -and-conquer approach; 2)  
Staged withdrawal / abstinence; and 3) Behavioral addiction ( BFRB intervention methods (See Manual of 
Procedure entitled: Addiction Model Intervention for Obesity in Young People for additional detail). Specifically, 
the intervention targets three features of addictive behavior: 1) Staged withdrawal from participant  identified 
problem foods; 2) Staged withdrawal from daytime snacking between meals; and 3) Withdrawal from excessive 
amounts of food consumed at meals. The curriculum also addresses self -monitor ing of weight and targeted 
15  
  
Protocol Version 8   behaviors to support habit -formati on of eating behaviors. Regular self - weighing and completion of the records 
are associated with program adherence and successful weight management.   
    
  The divide -and-conquer approach breaks down the addictive behavior and the withdrawal process into 
components, which are attacked one at a time in discrete, small increments. It is productive to divide 
intervention into problem foods, snacking, and excessive amounts at meals, and each involves treating both 
the sensory and motor addiction components.  
1) Withdrawal from problem foods : Problem foods are specific foods for which the child  or teen has  
 cravings, seeks out or purchases, cannot resist when immediately available, and cannot stop eating  
 when started. The child or teen identifies and lists all his/her problem foods and then abstains from  
 each food, one -at-a-time, for nominally [ADDRESS_190550] resolved (designated as “in -control” for that food). Then the child/teen progresses to the nex t  
 problem food on his/her list. Two problem foods may be withdrawn from concurrently, but it is  
 recommended that no more than two problem foods be withdrawn from at a time.   
2) Withdrawal from snacking/grazing : This is accomplished by [CONTACT_164224], such as morning, afternoon, evening or nighttime, nominally for 10 days each time period  
 and until difficulty resisting snacking during that time period has resolved (designated as in -control  
 for that time period ). Then the child/teen progresses to the next time period, with the goal of zero  
 snacking during the entire day. Snacking may be withdrawn from in more than one time period  
 concurrently.  
3) Withdrawal from excessive food amounts : This may be accomplished  in two ways:  
a) Cutting in half method . Cut everything in half eaten at meals, put half back,     
 and eat only half. Sharing with a friend or boxing up half when eating out is useful.   
b) Measuring/weighing method . Measure or weigh typi[INVESTIGATOR_164196], staged       
 percentages from starting amounts. Weighing foods is much easier to       
 implement that the cutting in half method, as it turns the quantity of food served into a 
number. Thus,   there is no “decision” and minimal stress.  
4) Behavioral addiction methods are used in parallel for each withdrawal process.  
  
Coach Training Procedures:  
  The coaches delivering the curriculum will receive [ADDRESS_190551]. 
Vidmar. The training covers: 1) the importance, rational and education about the theory of food addiction and 
the proposed intervention, 2) the concept of behavior change, patient centered approach and 
motivationalinterviewing techniques, and 3) practical advice specific to each stage of the intervention and ways 
to assist the youth with common barriers and triggers. The coaches will also tailor the deliv ery of information 
and the setting of goals to the participant's readiness for change. Coachin g curriculum will cover active 
listening, nonjudgmental communications, motivational interviewing techniques, and creating self -management 
goals. In addition, the two coaches will be required to demonstrate mastery of coaching skills through 
simulated role plays and observations of coaching sessions. Coaches will have ongoing support from the study 
PI (AV) via bimonthly meetings at which they may present participant  cases and request guidance with specific 
issues and may consult with the study investigators as needed.   
  Once the coaches complete the training and demonstrate mastery of the skills, they will be assigned 
participants in the AppCoach group.  The AppCoach group will be the only arm with a personalized coach. 
Each coach makes initial contact (via HIPAA secure video conferencing) with the participant at the time of 
enrollment to describe his or her role and to discuss participant identified goals.   
  Coaches will have undergraduate training and be highly knowledgeable about motivational interviewin g 
clinical practice guidelines regarding strategies for obesity management in youth. Coaches will be taught to 
table unfamiliar clinical and counseling questions, which may arise during coaching. They will then discuss 
these questions with Alaina Vidmar (A V) at bi -monthly team meetings, who will provide direction about 
management on future calls. Coaches will record all calls, and AV and SS will review a sub set of these 
16  
  
Protocol Version 8   recordings. Coaches will receive monthly feedback regarding implementation of directive and nondirective 
coaching modes.  
Clinic: Multi -Disciplinary In -Clinic Monthly Intervention (In -Clinic Group)  
  The team consists of a coordinator/health educator, physicians (MD), registered dietitian (RD), physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (PT) and psychologist, who w ill assess participants in a clinic setting/virtually, with monthly visits with 
one or more providers (averaging 100 minutes at the initial visit and 80 minutes per follow up visit, ~[ADDRESS_190552] 
hours per participant per 6 -month intervention period). Core pr incipals of the clinic include motivational 
interviewing (MI) and family -centered care.  Patients and their par ent/guardian are expected to attend monthly 
clinic visits for at least six visits (6 months). The study team member will obtain height and weight  at the 
beginning of each visit.   
  The coordinator/health educator will evaluate the patient and families overall emotional health and 
address anxiety, psychosocial stressors, and emotional eating. Healthy eating goals focus on hunger 
management, portion  control, decreasing sugar -based beverage intake, increasing fruit and vegetable intake, 
and modifying eating behaviors.  Changes in behavior for the entire family are strongly encouraged.    The 
multi -disciplinary team utilizes treatment strategies that i nclude MI, nutritional education, a nd behavioral 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_164197], emotional health, sleep quality and quantity, diet, and physical 
activity. Each team member documents the patient’s goals identified at each visit and distribu tes a summary 
check -out document to the team and the family. Goals for healthy eating, increased physical activity, better 
sleep habits, emotional well -being, and family support are then followed up at subsequent monthly visits.   
  
The Clinic Intervention  will utilize the Kids N Fitness Curriculum and will address the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_164198] 6 -
month intervention:  
Session 1: Nutrition and Food Groups   
Session 2: Portion Power  
Session 3: Real Foods, Fat and Fiber  
Session 4: Sugar Savvy  
Sessions 5: Hea lthy Shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], Healthy Eating  
Sessions 6: Special Occasions and Moving Forward  
  
Those youth randomized to the in -clinic control arm will complete the intervention at CHLA or virtually via 
WebEx. The participant and their parent/guardian will meet with e ach team member for 20 -30 minutes to 
discuss the topic of the session. The youth will participate in some mild physical activity exercises, such as 
stretching. Treatment fidelity strategies will be utilized for all three intervention arms to ensure the acc urate and 
precise delivery of each arm as intended. (See Treatment Fidelity Below).

Intervention Delivery:  
  The proposed model of delivery makes it possible to: 1) Intervene with the adolescent and provide 
autonomy, 2) deliver t he material over an extended period of time in a more convenient platform for the youth 
and families, 3) reduce many access barriers (transportation, missed days of school and work) common to 
conventional outpatient obesity interventions, and 4) help youth  learn skills to help them overcome their 
addictive eating traits.   
  
Intervention Fidelity:  
18  
  
Protocol Version 8   AppCoach and App Groups  
  Intervention fidelity encompasses integrity (interventions are implemented according to established 
procedures) and differentiation (i nterventions are distinct from one another). Our formative work suggests that 
the following strategies and safeguards are effective in preserving integrity and differentiation: (1)  
Comprehensive assessment of the curriculum. (2) As described above coaches  will receive extensive training 
to master the curriculum’s psychosocial and educational curriculum (supported by [CONTACT_164225]) and they 
receive weekly supervision. The training, scripted manuals and supervision prevent drifting (i.e., avoid covering 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]/areas not included in the curriculum). (3) Coaches will receive an initial training period and refresher 
courses throughout the study period. Implementation quality is further supported by [CONTACT_164226] , dosage and timing of delivery, and to provide the opportunity to resolve 
problems or issues encountered. (4) Coaching is delivered via phone with audio recording of each sessions. 
Coaches will be provided with session outlines as a material guide and fol lowing the sessions, Drs. Salvy and 
Vidmar will review the sessions utilizing a session checklist to ensure treatment fidelity. The recorded sessions 
will be monitored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Salvy p eriodically over the course of the study to ensure compliance with coachin g 
instructions and prevent any drifting.  
  
In-Clinic Arm:  
  A similar treatment fidelity schema will be implemented for the in -clinic intervention. The curriculum will 
be adapted to target youth ages [ADDRESS_190555]. Salvy will 
evaluate the implementation and ensure session objective and checklists were correctly incorporated and 
prevent any drif ting over time.  
  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_164199]:    
  Twelve participants (and one of their parent/guardian) will be recruited from CHLA to complete a pi[INVESTIGATOR_164200] 2 months before the initial open recruitment commences. The youth participants will be 
randomized to one of the three arms and complete that intervention accordingly. The team members will 
continue to be monitored as they implement the intervention and barriers to execution will be evaluated. Those 
12 participates will complete the full study pe riod. If not protocol amendments are m ade they will be included in 
the final analysis, if protocol amendments are made they will be excluded.   
  
Intervention Compensation:   
  
  Traditional payment: Payments will be provided at the end of study visits at months 3, 6, 12, and 18 as 
shown in the table below. Monthly payment: The participant may elect to receive compensation at monthly 
intervals for the first [ADDRESS_190556] will be emailed to them monthly based upon how much of the 
intervention they participate in or they can opt for the study team to email them im ages of the gift cards.  
Each youth participant, regardless of which group they  are assigned to, will receive compensation in the 
form of gift cards. Each youth participant has the opportunity to earn up to a total of $[ADDRESS_190557] ten -dollar increment, by [CONTACT_164227].    
  
Parents/guardians will not be paid for their participation in this study.  
  
For Group 1 (AppCoach) and 2 (App):    
The app will automatically accrue points as the partic ipant interacts with the app components. They will receive 
a pre -determined amount of points each time they open the app, each time they weigh in, each time they log a 
problem food, etc. The participants will be able to enter the motivation section of the app as desired to evaluate 
[ADDRESS_190558] accrued. In addition, lack of participation with the app results in loss of points which 
will result in decreased financial gain. This balance is als o available to the participants in real time. Points w ill 
be associated with financial quantity (1 point = 5 cents) and the youth participants will earn compensation as 
they complete the intervention as directed.  
  
The youth participants will be able to e arn up to $50 for participation in the 3 and 6 -month i ntervention and $50 
for completion of visits 4 and 5. Payment will be provided at the end of the study visits at 3 months (visit 2), 6 
months (visit 3), 12 months (visit 4), and 18 months (visit 5).

Outcomes  
  The primary outcome will be  change in zBMI  and excess BMI percent over the 95th percentile 
(%BMI p95) compared to baseline, assessed at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months, both within the groups and compared 
between groups and in clinic group.  For analysis over time, the Δ%BMI p95 (BMI percentile – 95th percentile), 
which is the distance (in kg/m2) from the 95th percentile, will be utilized31.   
  
  Secondary outcomes will include: compliance with App intervention, retention rates with scheduled 
phone calls and clinic visits, ASRI, BRIEF, Satisfaction survey, YFAS -c, fasting lab testing compared pre and 
post interven tion. Collected lab studies will include:  HbA1c, Lipid Panel, AST/ALT. Each of these lab tests are 
currently recommended for routine clinical care screening every [ADDRESS_190561] per patient to implement the 6 
month AppCoach intervention, App alone intervention and multi -disciplinary in -clinic intervention (Clinic)32. Cost 
Analysis to include: time or expenses saved compared to in -clinic (travel, missed work or scho ol); efficiency of 
clinic and staffing needs, including appointment duration and physical space requirements, and health care 
utilization rates and costs of care33, 34.

Protocol Version 8   Analytic Plan:  
Power and Sample Size Estimates:    
The power analysis is prepar ed for comparing (1) the difference in the mean change of zBMI and 
%BMIp95 between baseline, 6 months, and 18 months across App+Coach, App, and Clinic, (2) the difference 
in zBMI and %BMIp95 mean change between App+Coach and Clinic, and (3) the difference in zBMI and 
%BMIp95 mean change between App+Coach and App.  Review of the literature revealed that the majority of 
studies utilize the change in zBMI to evaluate the effectiveness of weight management interventions in 
adolescent s. However, Freedman et al. and the CDC have proposed utilizing alternative metrics for weight 
change such as %BMI95 which may be more strongly associated with change in body size in adolescents. 
Therefore, both metrics were considered in the power calculation to further explore thei r use as outcome 
measures in youth with obesity and severe obesity.  
This study will enroll [ADDRESS_190562] 
measurements within each group, based on Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with two -sided Type I error of 5%. 
For the first study aim, the difference in the mean change of zBMI and %BMIp95 between baseline, 6 months, 
and 18 months across App+Coach, App, and Clinic, this study has at least 83% power to detect the effect size 
of 0.[ADDRESS_190563] 89% power 
to detect the effect size of 0.263 with the variance o f the group means of 2.903 for the mean change of  
%BMIp95.  For the second study aim, the difference in zBMI and %BMIp95 mean change between  
App+Coach and Clinic, based on two sample t -test with two -sided Type I error of 5%, this study has 88% to 
detect an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_190564] deviation between the two groups and a 92% power to detect an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_190565] change i n %BMIp95 at least 4.[ADDRESS_190566] study aim, the difference in zBMI and %BMIp95 mean change between App+C oach and 
App, based on two sample t -test with two -sided Type I error of 5%, this study has 71% power to detect an  
effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_190567] 
deviation between the two groups and a 68% power to detect an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_190568] change in %BMIp95 at least 2.80 percent between the two comparison groups.   
Assuming 20% dropout rate, this study will achieve the desired study power of 80% for study aim 1 and 2.  
(nQuery + nTerim 4.0 and Stata/SE 15.1).   
Statistical Analysis  
    
Statistical an alysis: All statistical analyses were conducted in accordance with the planned study protocol.19 
We estimated that 180 participants (60 in each group) would provide 89% power (α = 0.05, 2 sided), to detect an 
effect size of 0.29 which corresponds to a diffe rence of 4 .0% %BMIp95 between the three groups. Analyses 
followed principles of intention -to-treat (ITT) and were performed in nQuery + nTerim 4.0 and Stata/SE 17 
(StataCorp, College Station, TX). A two -sided significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_190569], and multiple imputation based on logistic regression model (for 
BEDS -7 scores only) were utilized  to account for missing data. Results from the ITT analysis using imputation 
were compared as per protocol analysis with completed data. For all outcomes a per -protocol analysis was 
conducted for: full -program (completed full 24 -week intervention period), pre-COVID (completed 24 -week 
intervention prior to 3/15/2020), and during COVID (completed 24 -week intervention after 3/16/2020). In addition, 
to account for impacts of the intervention dosage received on each primary outcome measure we conducted an 
analys is of participants who were adherent to at least 80% of the prescribed intervention modalities versus those 
who were nonadherence. Participants' demographic characteristics and baseline anthropometric measurements 
were reported as appropriately, mean and s tandard deviation or median and interquartile range for continuous 
variables, and frequency and percentages for categorical variables. The change in %BMI95 between week 24 
and baseline was assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for all participants vi a ITT, per -protocol, 
PreCOVID and during COVID. First, the %BMIp95 was analysed in log scale mixed -effects linear regression 
model to assess the association between change in %BMIp95 and demographic characteristics (sex, ethnicity, 
22  
  
Protocol Version 8   obesity related co -morbi dities), CED -SC, PSS, BRIEF -2, YFAS -c, and BEDS -[ADDRESS_190570] of the possible factors on change in %BMI p95 accounting for recruitment site, demographic 
and other measured characteristics. The results are expressed in percent change with its associated 95th% 
confidence interval and p -value.   
  
Data management and quality assurance  
  Principles underlying ou r approach to quality control includes: (1) standardization of measurements; (2) 
use of clear and specific protocols for all study activities including training for data collection and processing; 
(3) validation and verification of data management procedur es by [CONTACT_164228]-of-range values and other sources of outliers; (4) implementation of a data cleaning protocol; and (5) 
periodic meetings and progress reports to provide specific, well -documented  feedback to the investiga tors 
concerning potential difficulties as well as sufficient follow -up to ensure that problems are resolved in a timely 
fashion. Confidentiality will be strictly maintained during all data management. Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164203], Saban Research Institute, will follow aforementioned schemes to collect and 
manage with maintaining consistent quality and security of the study observations.  
  
Data Collection Management Plan AppCoach:  
  The iPhone app will be securely integrated with a  network server for real -time data access and storage. 
All participant app data will be periodically backed up to a secure server to preserve data in the event the 
participant loses or damages his/her iPhone. Artificial intelligence in the app will supplem ent coach functions. 
The investigators will have ongoing access to this data in order to monitor proper use of the app and participant 
weight loss. The developer of the app will have access to coded data i ncluding weight trends, app usage, 
problem foods id entified, aversion techniques identified and food weights measured by [CONTACT_164229]. The app will utilize a code name [CONTACT_164237] [CONTACT_164230]. No medical a dvice will be given.  Investigators will provide 
support and prompt participant to enter data as necessary. All phone conversations will be recorded. Phone 
meetings will be documented by [CONTACT_164231] a se cure electronic form system incorporated in the app  
database.  
    
Coaching:   
  Trained clinical research coordinators will conduct semi -structured, in -person/WebEx interviews with 
each participant and all present family members using coaching session outlines developed by [CONTACT_17881]. Interviews wi ll begin with open -ended questions to prevent biased answers. Open -ended questions will 
include current health concerns and desired elements of health coaching to address these concerns during the 
intervention period. Parent/Guardian of all subjects will r eceive monthly calls to allo w for technical difficulties to 
be remedied and to assist with improved adherence and retention. All interviews will be audio recorded  
verbatim for period evaluation of intervention fidelity. The weekly telephone call documenta tion will be reviewed 
monthly as well to ensure validity and identify discussion topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], themes and barriers.  
  
All survey responses that are completed will be stored in a REDCap database.  
  
Feasibility:   
CHLA: The EMPOWER Clinic at CHLA cares for obese  patients one half -day each week, seeing approximately 
8 patients per week. Approximately 25% of these participants are 14 -18 years of age, and ~70% of these 
should be eligible based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, yielding ~[ADDRESS_190571] 
to recruit 292 participants over a 36 -month period.      
          
Randomization and Blinding:   
23  
  
Protocol Version 8     Blocked randomization will be utilized, to ensure the groups are balanced in terms of number of 
subjects and the distribution of potential co nfounding variables. Blocked randomization will be used to ensure 
the number of eligible subjects assigned to each group is equally distributed. Block size will be blinded from the 
primary investigator performing the study.   
  
  
Potential Risks/Adverse Ev ents and Procedures Used to Minimize the Risks  
For purposes of monitoring and reporting adverse events, the following definitions will be used:   
  Adverse event (AE):  any untoward medical occurrence that may present itself during treatment or 
administrat ion of an intervention, and which may or may not have a causal relationship with the treatment. 
Adverse events could arise from the study (e.g., breach of confidentiality) or could arise because of the 
population under study (e.g., a mother reports extensi ve use of drugs).  
  Serious adverse event (SAE):  Any medical occurrence that results in death; is life -threatening; requires  
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97889]; creates persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Such an event could include suicidal ideation or 
attempted drug overdose or withdrawal, etc.  
  Adverse events monitoring : Each participant will be evaluated for any adverse events. All events will be 
graded by [CONTACT_2030] a ttribution (unrelated to protocol; or possibly, probably, or definitely related to protocol). Any 
event reported to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_164204]. Events will be carefully documented in  a report submitted to the IRBs. The report will include a 
description of the event; when and how it was reported; any official char ts, records, or documentation to 
corroborate the event or the reporting of the event; and an action plan to prevent future o ccurrences. All 
adverse events will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe. Any severe and/or unanticipated adverse event 
will be immediately reported to the IRBs (within 48 hours of occurrence or recognition). All adverse events will 
be summarized annuall y and submitted to the IRBs. Any action resulting in a temporary or permanent 
suspension of this study (e.g., IRB actions) will be r eported to the funding source.   
  Physical risks:  Symptoms of fasting blood draw usually are not serious and generally reso lve within a 
few minutes without treatment, by [CONTACT_164232].   
  Psychological risks : It is possible that a participant may become upset thinking about some of the 
questions or topi[INVESTIGATOR_164205]. Trained research staff will be conductin g the assessment sessions to address 
any potential incident. All participants will be informed that they are free to refuse to answer any particular 
questions or questionnaires. They will also be informed that they can withdraw from the study at any time 
without penalty. Staff will immediately report any AEs connected to the data coll ection to [CONTACT_164238] who will 
keep a log of AEs and SAEs. [CONTACT_164238] will file a written report within [ADDRESS_190572]. 
Vidmar will monitor outcomes for AEs, and outcome information will be entered into a log for inclusion in 
reports to the IRB and NIH.   
  Social risks : There are no added social risks from participating in this study.  
  Legal/other risks : There are no legal risks added from participating in this study.  
  Bullying or violence : If we suspect that participan ts are victims of bullying or violence at home or in their 
neighborhood, either through completion of the questionnaires or through adolescents’ report to research staff, 
we will implement the following procedures: (1) we will make adolescents aware of res ources available to them 
in their communities; (2) we will work with the youths to develop a safety plan for addressing bullying or 
violence; (3) we will ascertain risk to the adolescent. If we suspect t hat an adolescent has been abused or 
witnessed domest ic violence, we will make a report to child protective services. Children/adolescents who are 
victims of bullying or domestic violence will not be dropped from the study, unless they ask to drop out.  
Suicidal Behavior. If we suspect that participants are suicidal, we will follow the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration SAFE -T: Suicide Assessment Five -Step Evaluation and Triage approach to 
[ADDRESS_190573] Suicide Inquiry, Determine Risk Level/Intervention, and Document (which includes intervention and 
follow -up).  As per Practice Guidelines, we will estimate suicide risk as Low, Moderate, or High. All potentially 
suicidal students will be provided an emergency plan with numbers to call, including local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164206], suicide hotlines, and research and school staff contacts. Each plan will be individually tailored to the 
need s and resources of the adolescent. Family members wil l be incorporated into the plan. We will be available 
to parents to work with them as to how to proceed if their child present with suicidal behavior. Adolescents who 
experience psychiatric emergencies such as suicidal behavior will not be dropped from the  study, unless they 
request to terminate their participation.   
  
Protection Against Risk:  
  Safety reviews:  The Principal Investigator ([CONTACT_164238]) and the IRB will review this protocol on a 
continuing basis for subject safety and include results of the review in the annual progress reports submitted to 
the funding source. The annual reports will include a list of adverse events and address: 1) whether adverse 
event rates are consistent with pre -study assumptions; 2) reasons for dropouts from the study; 3 ) whether all 
participants met entry criteria; and 4) whether continuation of the study is j ustified on the basis that additional 
data are needed to accomplish the stated aims of the study.   
  
Monitoring plan: The study’s data safety and monitoring plan w ill entail several components, overseen by [CONTACT_1268] ([CONTACT_164238]):   
  1.All Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164207]. Any actions taken by [CONTACT_3433] e IRB as part of its continuing review  
 will be immediately reported to the funding source.    
2. The PIs will implement and monitor procedures to ensure that the participants provide informed  
 consent, that parents provide consent and permission and that a ll data remains confidential. This will  
 also include a rigorous data management protocol to optimize data entry, accuracy/checking, and  
 retrieval. Data will be stored in password -protected files accessible only to the investigators and staff  
 under th eir supervision. In the database, only an ID code number will identify subjects. A list linking  
 names and other identifiers with their ID codes will be stored in a separate file with a separate  
 password. All original paper surveys will be stored in loc ked file cabinets. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_164208]. In the case of  
 a breach of confidentiality or other adverse event, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_164209] t o the  
 IRB, and appropriate procedural changes will be implemented to prevent future breaches o r adverse  
 events.   
3. Internal committee. The Principal Investigator ([CONTACT_164238]) and the Co -Investigators will meet  
 quarterly to assess participant recruitme nt, accrual, and retention; data quality and timeliness;  
 participant risk versus benefit; and the development of external conditions that could potentially affect  
 the study.  Significant problems or adverse events will be reported immediately to the CH LA IRB (if  
 relevant).    
4. As part of their training for the study, all study personnel who will interact with subjects will receive  
 instruction in the completion of an adverse event reporting form. In response to any adverse event,  
 these forms will be  completed promptly and returned to the corresponding study team supervisor, who  
 in turn will report the information to the Principal Investigator.    
Potential benefits of the proposed research to human subjects and others : This study will help research ers and 
professionals understand how mobile health interventions help adolescents with weight management. Thus , 
the benefits of this project to the individual and society greatly outweigh the risks.  
Importance of the knowledge to be gained : The proposed s tudy tests whether mHealth interventions founded in 
addictive theory may be a cost effective and beneficial weight loss intervention for youth with obesity. This is 
important to bridge the gaps in our understanding of how to best treat obesity in this popu lation. Our goal is to 
refine our understanding of mHealth interventions and the use of evaluating obesity through an addictive 
paradigm.    
[ADDRESS_190574] of adverse events. Therefore, the potential gains of this study, which include informing 
policies and interventions addressing disease prevention and health promotion in adolescents, outweigh the 
risk of conducting this research.   
  
ClinicalTrials.gov Requirements : Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]  
The project will be registered in ClinicalTrials.gov no later than [ADDRESS_190575] is enrolled. 
Reporting of summary results information (including adverse events) will be reported no later than 1 year after 
the completion date. The ClinicalTrials.gov registry number (also known as NCT number), brief lay public title, 
and a certification that all required submissions to ClinicalTrials.gov were completed will be provi ded in 
progress reports.  The PI ([CONTACT_164238]) will assume responsibility for  these aspects of the trial.

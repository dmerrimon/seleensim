 1 INTRODU CTION 
 
Inadequate management of preoperative mental health disorders often contributes to poor 
postoperative outcomes  [1], including increased rates of readmission, delirium, falls, and 
mortality  [2-5]. However, very little work has been done to improve perioperative mental health. 
In particular, there have not been any systematic efforts to identify evidence -based behavioral 
interventions that were originally developed for depression and anxiety in other wise medically 
well psychiatric patients, adapt them for use in surgical populations, test their effectiveness in 
these patient populations, and study implementation strategies.  
 
The proposed study will focus on comparing a perioperative mental health intervention of 
behavioral therapy focused on Behavioral Activation (BA), plus  Medication Optimization (MO) ,  
compared to enhanced usual care , among older adults undergoing cardiac, orthopedic or 
oncologic procedures with anesthesia  (N=300; n=100 each surgical type) . We chose to use 
enhanced usual care to provide some harmonization between the participants in the usual care arm. Providing resources to participants in both arms increases the possibility of benefit for all participants, which may potentially improve recr uitment and retention.  
 
We hypothesize that t he mental health intervention can mitigate anxiety and depression 
symptoms during the perioperative period [6]. Towards this end, we propose to test the 
effectiveness as well as the implementation potential of the intervention in a Hybrid Type [ADDRESS_1034137] Design.  
 This study includes  adults aged 6 0 and older with current depression/anxiety symptoms  (PHQ -
ADS ≥10)  and that are undergoing major orthopedic , cardiac or oncologic  procedures . Each 
patient is randomized to the perioperative mental health intervention vs enhanced usual care.

 2     ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES  
 
Aim 1 .  Examine the effects of a perioperative mental health intervention, composed of a 
wellness program and medication optimization,  on depression/anxiety symptoms compared to 
enhanced usual care in patients undergoing a scheduled cardiac, orthopedic or oncologic 
surgical procedure.  
 H1: A greater  decrease in depression/anxiety symptoms will occur in patients randomized to 
the perioperative mental health intervention compared to patients randomized to enhanced 
usual care.   
  
 
3 ANALYSIS SETS/ POPULATIONS/SUBGROUPS 
 
We will randomiz e older adults age d ≥60 to either the perioperative mental health intervention 
or enhanced usual care . The modified intent -to-treat analyses will include all patients  that 
underwent a  orthopedic, cardiac or oncologic  surgical procedure . The goal target in the mITT 
group  is 300 patients , with approximately 100 patients  in each surgical cohort .  Patients  can 
choose to refuse any component of this study.

5 RANDOMIZATION  
 All eligible and consented participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the perioperative mental health intervention or enhanced usual care. The study biostatistician generates the randomization table using a variable block sequence. The assignment of the treatment condition for each individual participant will be done by [CONTACT_755486]® randomization module  [15,16] after confirming trial eligibility. For participants assigned to the intervention, a 
randomization table will be generated using a similar block sequence design, and the data manager will manually select the individual intervention team member according t o the 
randomization table and record that information in REDCap®. This process will trigger an automatic notification via REDCap® to the assigned interventionists .   
  6 BLINDING  
 
Research coordinators responsible for collecting outcome data throughout the study will be 
blinded until data collection is complete. At the end of the 3 -month follow -up, the research 
coordinators will complete a blinding question to guess the arm to which each participant was 
allocated. This will allow the team to determine the effectiveness of the blinding procedures  
[17]. Upon completing this form, it will be locked by [CONTACT_58047], and the participant’s 
assignment will be revealed to the research coordinators to conduct the end- of-study 
interviews with the participants in the intervention arm.  
 
[ADDRESS_1034138] C are will not be affected for 
any of the patients  due to study participation. Completion of the outcomes will be entirely 
patient -reported, to minimize the assessor’s bias in interpreting patient responses.  
  8 END POINTS AND COVARIATES  
 Primary outcome  
The primary outcome of the study is the change in PHQ -ADS from baseline to 3 -month visit. All 
models will be adjusted for covariates which strongly associate with the outcome  and which 
may differ across patient sub- populations .

 9 HAN DLING OF MISSING V ALUES AND OTHER DATA CONVE NTIONS 
 The data is regularly reviewed to identify missing data.  All models will be fit with SAS or R  
using a maximum likelihood criteria  which utilizes all available information yielding optimal 
solutions in the face of missing data as long as it is missing at random .  Multiple  imputation 
will be used where the sta tistical model does not already provide  appropriate protection 
for data missing at random.   
 
• For the clinical assessments, if the scale consist ed of 6-10 items and a participant is 
missing one item, then the average of the other items will be used to fill in the missing item. If more than 1 item is missing, then that participant’s data will not be used for that scale. For a 1 -5 item scale, any missing data will exclude that 
participant’s data for that scale. For scales with greater than 10 items, a 10%  cutoff 
rule will be employed for  missing data.    
  [ADDRESS_1034139] despi[INVESTIGATOR_755484]. The population used for the primary analysis is a modified Intent to Treat (mITT) group consisting of those randomized participants who actually undergo the surgery  
(ie, for randomized participants in whom the surgery is cancelled or indefinitely delayed, they are not part of the analysis sample) . Participants will still be included in the analysis if 
they died post -operatively  or were lost to followup , prior to the end of the trial.  Statistical 
significance will be set at 0.05 and relevant changes in PHQ -ADS will be estimated along 
with 95% confidence intervals.  Any data available  at baseline, [ADDRESS_1034140] adequate power to examine intervention effects within each of the  individual surgical subgroups (n=100 each), as well as  the planned meta -
analysis (N=300). To estimate the power, we examined the manuscript that provided the original validity and reliability studies for the PHQ -ADS [49] and one of the trials that  provided 
data for that study (Stepped Care to Optimize Pain care Effectiveness (SCOPE))  [84,85].  The 
PHQ -ADS authors estimate the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) from the 
standard error of measure as 3 -4 points  [49].  Since the SCOPE trial was a pain relief study 
without a requirement for anxiety or depression, we conducted a blinded sample size reassessment after  [ADDRESS_1034141] deviation of 8.8  (d= 0.76) . These 
125 subjects were from 135 in the mITT  group, or 7% dropout. With the chosen sample size of 
[ADDRESS_1034142] between the two 
groups of size 46, a 2- tailed significance level of 0.05, and a difference between the two groups 
of >[ADDRESS_1034143] and we will be using a repeated measures ANOVA for the 
actual analysis.    
   Figure 1 : Power calculation curve suggest ing a power of at least 55% for  
             groups of size 46 , calculated from a mITT sample size of 50 in each group with  a 7%  
             dropout, and a difference between groups >4 points.

11 QUALITY CONTROL PLANS  
 Data quality will be assessed using REDCap validation methods  and ongoing review of data 
(e.g., identification of missing data, outliers, etc. ). Range and consistency checks  will also be 
employed . 
  12 PROGRAMMING PLANS 
 Statistical software (SAS and R ) will be used to produce results and raw data will be available  for 
accompanying  papers to be submitted for publication (following approval by [CONTACT_755487]) .

Study Site(s):  This study will be conducted at approximately 3 sites in the [LOCATION_002]  
Number of Patients:  Approximately 12  Phase of Development:  [ADDRESS_940093] been clinically controlled, including 
minimal signs and symptoms of EPI,  on a stable dose of commercial pancreatic enzyme 
replacement therapy (PERT) for at least one month. Patients on cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapi[INVESTIGATOR_693216] a stable dose for at least [ADDRESS_940094] udy entry 
and no dose changes will be made during the study.  
Upon obtaining an informed consent, potentially eligible patients will receive dietary counselling  
during the week prior to the scheduled date of confinement for collecting stool samples for 
calculation of baseline coefficient of fat absorption (CFA). This counselling  will emphasize the 
importance of dietary stability during the study. Patients found to have a CFA of 80% or greater 
while receiving their commercial PERT and meeting the other eligibility criteria will be enrolled 
into the study. 
The study will enroll  patients into either  Part 1 (under protocol version 1.0) or Part 2  (under 
protocol version 2.0) .  Under Part 1, patients will undergo a dose optimization phase  during the 
three week treatment period where the adrulipase dose could be titrated from the low dose 
(1.2 g/day) up to medium (1.95 g/day) or high (2.4 g/day) doses.  Under Part 2, all patients will 
receive 3.3 g/day of adrulipase and there will be no dose optimization, thus the tr eatment window 
will be two weeks.  I

CONFIDENTIAL  Upon study enrolment, the patient will be switched from their commercial PERT to receive 
adrulipase. T he patient will remain on study for approximately three weeks (for Part 1 patients) or 
two weeks (for Part 2 patients) , after which a repeat CFA will be obtained.  
For Part 1, a dose titration scheme will be used for determining whether a low, medium, or high 
dose of adrulipase may succeed in controlling signs and symptoms of exocrine pancreatic 
insufficiency (EPI) and provide a CFA of 80% or greater. Patients will initially receive a low dose 
of adrulipase . Upon the appearance of EPI [CONTACT_23805], lasting at least three days, and upon 
discussion with the investigator, the patient will be switched to the medium dose of adrulipase. If 
signs and symptoms of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_693217] , the patient will be switched to the high 
dose of adrulipase. After patients complete three weeks of study  treatment  and their end of study 
CFA, they will be returned to  their pre-study commercial PERT. An end of study safety visit will 
be scheduled for one week  after finishing adrulipase therapy.  
For Part 2, a dose of 3.3 g/day adrulipase will be used for all patients.  After patients complete two 
weeks of study  treatmen t and their end of study CFA, they will be returned to their pre -study 
commercial PERT. An end of study safety visit will be scheduled to occur  one week after finishing 
adrulipase therapy.  
Safety assessments will be made by [CONTACT_178431], safety lab assessments, and 
immunologic assays to assess drug induced immune responses.

Adrulipase is supplied as size 00 immediate release capsules containing ~ [ADDRESS_940101] to the high dose. All 
patients in Part 2 will receive a 3.3 g/day dose of adrulipase for the entirety of the study.  
 For Part 1, d osages will typi[INVESTIGATOR_405787]: 1/4 of the daily dose at each of 3 main 
meals, and 1/8 at each of the 2 snacks. The patients will be instructed to consume ~25 g of  fat with 
every main meal and 12.5 g of fat with each of the 2 snacks to approximate a high fat meal of 100 
g of fat/day. The 1.2 g/day dose will be fractionated as follows: 2  capsules with the morning, 
noontime, and evening meals, plus 1 capsule with the morning and evening snacks. The 1.95 g/day 
dose will be fractionated as follows: 3 capsules with each of the three main meals, and 2 capsules with each of the two snacks. The 2.4 g/day dose will be fractionated as follows: 4 capsules with 
each of the three main meals, and 2 capsules with each of the two snacks.  
For Part 2, The 3.3 g/day dose will be fractionated as follows: [ADDRESS_940102] up to 6 weeks for screening, followed by [CONTACT_3450] 14 or 21 days study  
treatment, for Part 2 or Part 1, respectively, plus a follow up visit  within 7 days for a total estimated 
study duration of 35 to 70 days per patient.  
Criteria for Evaluation  
Safety endpoints:  AEs, SAEs, discontinuations due to adverse events, and lab oratory values, including assays for 
drug induced antibodies.  
Efficacy Endpoints:  
Primary  Endpoints :  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the CFA that will be assessed at the end of  the 3-week treatment 
period for Part 1 and at the end of the 2- week treatment period for Part 2 .

CONFIDENTIAL  Statistical Methods  
Statistical methods will be further detailed in the Statistical Analysis plan (SAP).  
Sample size:  Based upon CFA data obtained in the recently completed Phase 2  studies (OPTION, 
OPTION 2 ), 12 patients  using a dose titration scheme  should provide sufficient point estimates of 
CFA and all other secondary efficacy endpoints . Given the acceptable safety profile obtained in 
the previous Phase 2 OPTION studies, a sample of 12 patients should be adequate for observation 
of safety .  
Analysis Sets:  
Safety Set: Patients receiving at least one dose of study  treatment.  
Efficacy Sets  
• Modified Intent -to-Treat Set (mITT): All enrolled  patients  receiving at least one 
dose of treatment and having  a valid  stool collection and CFA post baseline while 
receiving their study drug. The primary analysis will be performed in the mITT set. 
• Per Protocol Set : mITT patients completing  the entire study  period  without any major 
protocol deviation. A sensitivity analysis will be performed in the Per Protocol Set. 
Handling Missing Data:  
Missing data will not be replaced . 
Safety Analysis:   
Safety (AEs, SA Es, discontinuations due to adverse events , and safety laboratory values) will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_339818].  Assays for anti -drug antibodies will be conducted.  
Efficacy Analysis:   
The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the CFA assessed at the end of the treatment period .  
CFA will be calculated as follows:  
CFA (%) = 100 ((fat intake (g) − fat excretion (g))/ fat intake (g))  
Primary Analysis:  
The analysis of the primary endpoint will be  done using descriptive methods. Secondary Efficacy 
Endpoints : 
Coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA) will be calculated and analyzed in the same manner as 
CFA.  
Stool weights, signs and symptoms of malabsorption, body weight , and  BMI, will be analyzed 
using descriptive methods.

(EPI) is defined as a deficiency of exocrine pancreatic enzymes which results in the inability 
to maintain normal digestion. The symptomatology of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_693221] . Pancreatic lipase is  an enzyme that hydrolyz es triglycerides into monoglycerides 
and free fatty acids.  
Lipid maldigestion due to lipase deficiency can lead to weight loss , steatorrhea (excess fat in 
the feces), fat -soluble vitamin deficiencies ( e.g., vitamins A, D, E, and K), and can  event ually 
lead to vitamin B12 deficiency and a potential decrease in quality of life (King et al, 1979). In 
EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405768] (CF) or chronic pancreatitis, there is also a decrease in bicarbonate 
output, causing a lower intesti nal pH , which leads to precipi[INVESTIGATOR_693222]. Fat maldigestion is further exacerbated by [CONTACT_693250] (Struyvenberg et al, 2017) .  
6.2 Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency due to Cystic Fibrosis 
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive chronic progressive disorder with high morbidity and a shortened life expectancy. CF affects more than 70,000 people worldwide ( Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation) . In most Caucasian populations, CF prevalence is 7 -8 cases per 
100,000 inhabitants but is less frequent in other populations (Farrell, 2008 ; Banks et al, 2010; 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry 2010) . In the [LOCATION_002] , there are 
approximately 30,000 affected individuals (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient 
Registry,  2016) . The disease occurs as a consequence of mutation s in the gene encoding for 
the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a plasma membrane ion channel 
that mediates transport of chloride, bicarbon ate, and other anions. Dysfunction of the CFTR 
gene leads to a decrease in luminal fluid volume and decreased pH, resulting in protein precipi[INVESTIGATOR_405770]. Mutation of both 
First Wave BioPharma Inc.,   May 12, [ADDRESS_940119]. 
Cystic fibrosis is frequently associated with EPI [INVESTIGATOR_693223]. A neonatal screening study found that 63% of infants with 
CF were exocrine insufficient , and approximately 30% of the exocrine sufficient group would 
progressively become insufficient over the next 36 months (Waters et al, 1990) . Even 
individuals with less severe CFTR mutations (Class IV, V, or VI) were more likely to develop 
EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405772] (Ledder et al, 2014 ; Bodewes et al, 2015) . 
6.[ADDRESS_940120]  of Care for the Compensation of Exocrine Pancreatic 
Insufficiency 
Porcine pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy  (PERT)  is the standard of care to prevent 
maldigestion, malnutrition, and excessive weight loss (Greenberger and Toskes 2008, 
Dhanasekaran and Toskes 2010, Greenberger and Toskes 2013) . This therapy uses animal 
pancreatic extracts, which have been marketed since 1938. Porcine pancreatic extracts ( porcine 
PERT) consist of an enzymatic mixture from pig pancreas, namely amylase, protease, and lipase, which digest starch, protein, and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], respectively. Therapy with porcine PERTs has demonstrated efficacy on the maldigestion symptoms due to EPI. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_405773] -term use, major concerns have been raised by [CONTACT_405814], the CF 
community, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because of  the animal ingredients 
used for porcine PERTs and the risk of transmission of conventional and nonconventional 
infectious agents. Furthermore , therapy with porcine PERTs has clear limitations: 
• The protease enzymatic constituents of porcine PERTs are suspected to cause 
fibrosing colonopathy ( Kimura et al, 1998; Kimura et al. 1999 ), a severe adverse 
event (AE) observed at high doses in young patients with CF.  
• To prevent this risk of fibrosing colonopathy, the CF Foundation recommended  that 
dosages should be limited to 500-2500 lipase units/kg/ meal, ≤10,000 lipase 
units/kg/day, or ≤4000 lipase units/g of dietary fat/day (Stallings et al, 2008) . 
Noticeably, porcine PERTs have only mild or null effects on creatorrhea 
(Van Hoozen et al, 1997 , Airinei et al, 2011 ). 
• Incomplete correction of the lipid malabsorption, which can only be reached by [CONTACT_405815] 50% of patients with EPI [INVESTIGATOR_693224]/or pancreat ectomy [Dominguez-Munoz et al, 2006; Safdi et 
al, 2006] . An internal survey based on all publicly available individual data show that 
only 25% of patients affected by [CONTACT_405816] [INVESTIGATOR_693225] (CFA) (i.e., CFA higher than 93%) on porcine PERT substitution therapy. The incomplete enzymatic activity of porcine PERTs in the physiochemical 
environment of the upper digestive tract may explain their reduced efficacy. A 
number of factors are involved, including the gastric acid pH in the range of 1 to 4; the intestinal pH ranging from 4 to 6 (porcine PERTs are active at pH >  6.5 in 
presence of biliary salts) ; and the protease content of the upper digestive tract (i .e., 
First Wave BioPharma Inc.,   May 12, 2023  
FWB-CF-2.03   Protocol Version  2.0  Page 23 of 65 
CONFIDENTIAL  gastric pepsin). Due to the acid lability of pig pancreatic lipase, commercial enzymes 
are formulated as enterically coated beads.  
• The hazard of zoonotic pathogen transmission to humans remains possible with porcine PERTs because of  their animal origins. For example, the porcine parvovirus 
may be present in these extracts, with (minimal) risk that it can cross species and transmit diseases to humans (Cherney, 2008) .  
• Some additional concerns identified with porcine PERTs include irritation of oral mucosa if chewed/retained  and hyperuricemia because of the presence of purines in 
porcine pancreatic extracts [Package insert Creon, Pancreaz e, Zenpep, Pertzye]. In 
addition, patients with an allergy to proteins of porcine origin may have severe 
allergic reactions . 
• As all of the currently marketed PERTs are porcine derived , there is a supply risk 
(both quality and quantity) that is dependent on the availability of pig herds.   
Because of  the risks and limitations of porcine PERT, new drugs are demanded by 
[CONTACT_405817].  
A fundam ental question is the value and usefulness of a lipase- only enzyme replacement 
therapy, such as adrulipase for patients with EPI.  For decades, the only available enzyme 
supplements to treat EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405776] -derived pancreatic enzymes containing a mix ture 
of lipase, protease, and amylase.  While the importance of the individual components in 
treating maldigestion has not been prospectively assessed, it is widely agreed that the earliest 
and sometimes only sign of malabsorption is steatorrhea (DiMagno et al, 1993; Ferrone et 
al, 2007).  Extra pancreatic sources of protease and amylase exist (Dominguez- Munoz, 2007; 
Hammer et al, 2010) , whereas little lipase is available other than that secreted by [CONTACT_152413].  
Furthermore, some have suggested that protease deficiency can be treated in part with essential amino -acid mixtures  (Engelen et al, 2014) .  Most agree th at amylase is the least important of 
the 3 supplemental pancreatic enzymes (Ladas et al, 1993)  perhaps because of high amylase 
content in salivary gland secretions.  In summary, the future value of a lipase -only supplement, 
either as a lipase- only replacement therapy in patients with mild to moderate EPI, or as an 
augmenting lipase for hyporesponsive patients reaching maximal doses of porcine enzyme 
treatment, remains to be seen.  
6.[ADDRESS_940121] ( Adrulipase)  
Adrulipase alfa (adrulipase), formerly referred to as MS1819, is a preparation of a recombinant 
yeast lipase, designated LIP2, which is a secreted enzyme, isolated from the strictly aerobic Yarrowia lipolytica that is found in various foods such as cheese and olive oil. This 
nonpathogen micro -organism is widely used as a biocatalyst ( e.g., erythritol production, a 
polyol used as a food additive) and is generally recognized as safe by [CONTACT_405818]. The genetically engineered strain of Yarrowia lipolytica  contains 5 
additional copi[INVESTIGATOR_405777]2 gene integrated into its genome (total of 6 including the endogenous native LIP2 gene). The genetic stability of the strain has been assessed for [ADDRESS_940122] BioPharma Inc.,   May 12, 2023  
FWB-CF-2.03   Protocol Version  2.0  Page 24 of 65 
CONFIDENTIAL  approximately 30 generations. Both current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) -compliant 
Master Cell Bank and Working Cell Bank have been manufactured. 
The LIP2 gene product is a [ADDRESS_940123] the proteolysis by [CONTACT_405819] 
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_405778], 2000) . At l east [ADDRESS_940124] been 
characterized (Aloulou et al, 2007 ). 
Until 2009, the active ingredient for adrulipase (recombinant yeast lipase, designated LIP2) 
was freeze- dried (FD) to obtain a final drug substance, MS1819- FD. From 2010 onwards , the 
process was changed  for large scale production  and the active ingredient for adrulipase was 
mixed with maltodextrin and then spray dried (SD) to obtain a final drug substance. In 2022, 
the SD process was further optimized and incorporated an enteric polymer to generic enteric 
microgranule s.  
In is this clinical study, adrulipase is supplied as size double zero capsules each  containing 
~150 mg lipase . 
6.5 Preclinical Studies with Adrulipase  
6.5.1 In Vitro Studies 
The enzymatic activity of LIP2 has been extensively investigated in vitro  and has an 
appropriate profile to compensate the EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405779]. For ex ample, the optimal activity of LIP2 occurs at pH 6, and works well in a range from pH  4 
to 7 which is usually found in the duodenum of CF patients with decreased pancreas derived bicarbonate. In addition, LIP2 enzymatic activity is not inactivated by [CONTACT_405820]. Furthermore, LIP2 is active on triglycerides with a wide range of fatty -acid lengths, including long- chain 
triglycerides, which are the predominant forms of triglycerides in the human diet. Compared with the porcine pancreatic lipase, LIP2 is more active than the porcine pancreatic lipase with all triglycerides tested at pH ranging from 4 to 6.  
6.5.2 In Vivo Studies  
The efficacy of MS1819- FD has been investigated in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] ; in which experimental 
pancreatitis and EPI [INVESTIGATOR_693226]. Daily doses of MS1819- FD 
10.5 mg or greater  administered once a day nearly completely corrected the CFA of 
approximately 20 kg minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] ( Aloulou 2015).  
The safety of adrulipase has been investigated in 2 nonclinical regul atory trials whereby 
[INVESTIGATOR_46427]1819 was well tolerated  at dosages up to 4700  mg/kg in rat s and 1175 mg/kg in minipig s 
for up to 13 weeks, equivalent to 1000mg/kg and 250mg/kg of lipase respectively.  
In summary, adrulipase was effective in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_405782] a maximum feasible dose over 3 months’ administration.  
First Wave BioPharma Inc.,   May 12, [ADDRESS_940125] -in-man study, 
FLIP110. This exploratory clinical trial without pre defined statistical analysis objectives, was 
a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel study. 
Patients  affected with chronic pancreatitis or pancreatectomy and severe EPI, were randomly 
assigned to 2 phases with an allocation ratio of 2:1 to receive MS1819- FD 20  mg 3  times a day 
or a ‘dummy’ placebo treatment identical in aspect and taste. Each treatment was given for a 
phase of 1 week after  a 1-week wash out phase.  
Twelve patients  were randomly included: 8 in MS1819- FD phase and 4 in the placebo phase. 
Three patients  in the MS1819- FD phase were excluded from the per protocol (PP) analysis 
because of  severe protocol deviations ( i.e., steatorrhea <  7 g/day in the baseline phase 
demonstrating the lack of significant EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405783] ). 
The primary endpoint of the study was defined as the relative change in steatorrhea compared 
with baseline. A nonstatistically significant difference of the primary e ndpoint was found 
between the 2 phases both in intent- to-treat (ITT : -14.6 % ± 26.6 in the MS1819- FD phase vs 
+16.9 % ± 40 in the placebo phase; not significant) and PP analysis (- 15.8 % ± 20.6 in the 
MS1819-FD phase vs +16.9 % ± 40 in the placebo phase; not significant), respectively.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints also support the efficacy of MS1819- FD compared with placebo 
in both ITT and PP  populations, including the absolute change in CFA ( ITT: +6.1 ± 13.4 vs -
6.7% ± 11.0), number of daily evacuations over 7 days (ITT: -19.2% ± 22.8 vs +4.1% ± 11.7; 
p =.09), the weight of stools ( ITT: -10.6% ± 27.4 vs +25.5% ± 48.2; not significant), and Bristol 
scale, which is a classification of the form of human feces to evaluate the effectiveness of 
treatments for dis eases of the bowel ( ITT: -5.13% ± 15.5 vs +2.46% ± 16.6; p<.0001). 
MS1819- FD was well  tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs). Only 2 AEs were 
observed: constipation (2 patients in the MS1819 group) and hypoglycemia (2 patients  in the 
MS1819 group and 1 patient in the placebo group). 
In summary, the FLIP110 study support ed the continued clinical investigations of the efficacy 
of higher doses of MS1819 using established surrogate biomarkers for EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405784]. 
6.6.2 MS1819/16/01 Phase 2a Study with MS1819 in patients with EPI [INVESTIGATOR_693227]-l abel, dose escalation Phase 2a study (MS1819/16/01) was conducted to investigate 
the safety of escalating doses of MS1819 in 11  patients with EPI [INVESTIGATOR_693228]. 
The primary objective of this study was to investigate the safety of escalating doses of MS1819 
(280 mg/day, 560 mg/day, 1120 mg/day, and 2240 mg/day).   Each dose was given over a two-

CONFIDENTIAL  week period. A CFA was obtained at baseline after washout, and after each escalating dose 
period.  Safety assessments include d immun oallergic side effects, digestive symptoms , and 
clinical laboratory tests. The secondary objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of MS1819 by [CONTACT_405821].  
Eleven patients were enrolled into the study, and ten completed all doses.  One patient withdrew during the 1120 mg/day dose level due to severe diarrhea.  This was not assessed as related to study drug. 
In the Intent -to-Treat population, mean CFA rose from a baseline of 46.1% to 62.4% at the 
highest dose (p = 0.001).  A number of symptoms improved comparing the highest dose to 
baseline, including stool consistency (p < 0.001), number of bowel movements (p = 0.006), steatorrhea (p = 0.008), and abdominal pain (p = 0.148).  The treatment was well tolerated, with only two SAEs reported.  Only one SAE was considered by [CONTACT_559861], which was a patient with mild, transient elevations of liver enzymes.  The elevations were between 2 and 3 X upper limit of normal (ULN), and lasted for about two 
week s, a period of time that the patient was no longer receiving study drug. The patient had no 
symptoms of liver disease.  
6.6.[ADDRESS_940126] experience with MS1819 in patients 
with cystic fibrosis.  The study began in February of 2019, and all patients completed the trial 
by [CONTACT_61763] 2019.  The study was conducted in 14 sites, with 11 in the U.S. and 3 in Poland.  All 
sites participated in enrollment.  The primary objectives of the study were to ascertain safety 
of 2240 mg/day dose of MS1819 in patients with cystic fibrosis and to compare t he efficacy 
of MS1819 to commercial PERT in digestion of fat.  The study was not powered for inferential statistics. A total of at least [ADDRESS_940127] 30 days. The dose of MS1819 
employed was 2240 mg/day.  This dose, used previously in a Phase [ADDRESS_940128] BioPharma Inc.,   May 12, 2023  
FWB-CF-2.03   Protocol Version  2.0  Page 27 of 65 
CONFIDENTIAL  patients discontinued during treatment with PERT and five patients discontinued during 
treatment with MS1819. The with drawals of patients who discontinued during treatment with 
MS1819 were primarily attributed to increased symptoms of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.  
The mean CFA for the MS1819 group was 56% (range 7% to 92%), and the mean CFA for the PERT group was 86%  (range 57% to 97%). This mean CFA of 56% on a dose of 2240 mg/day 
MS1819 was similar to the mean CFA of 62% in the chronic pancreatitis study at the same dose. The mean coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA) for the MS1819 group was 93% and 
the mean CNA  for the PERT group was 97%.  Symptoms of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency 
were more prominent in the MS1819 group. 
MS1819 was well -tolerated, with no remarkable adverse events. Three SAEs occurred during 
the screening period, but none during the study  itself. Each of these SAEs was due to 
pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. Laboratory values were unremarkable during the 
study.

Study to assess the Safety and Efficacy of MS1819 in Enteric 
Capsules in Patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency due to Cystic Fibrosis; with an Extension Phase Evaluation of Immediate-Release MS1819 Capsules 
This study, referred to as the OPTION [ADDRESS_940129] of 2020, and all patients completed 
the study by [CONTACT_11712] 2021.  The study was conducted in 9 sites, with 5 in the U.S. and 4 in 
Poland.  All sites participated in enrollment.   
 
The primary objectives of the study were to assess the safety and efficacy of MS1819 in 
enteric capsules vs porcine pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in patients with 
exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) due to cystic fibrosis (CF). The safety and tolerability of MS1819 treatment (2240 and 4480 mg/day; enteric capsules) were assessed during the crossover phase, as was efficacy by [CONTACT_693251] (CFA) percentages across the MS1819 (2240 and 4480 mg/day) versus porcine P ERT treatment 
groups. The exploratory objective during the dose extension phase was to identify immediate -release MS1819 (4.4 or 6.7 g/day) doses that were safe and resulted in CFA 
percentages residing within the current PERT therapeutic range.  The study was not powered 
for inferential statistics. A total of at least [ADDRESS_940130] treatment group and 1 in the PERT 
treatment group. One additional patient in the extension  MS1819 IR 4480 mg/day treatment 
group discontinued the study due to mild TEAEs, which resolved.

Mean CFA percentages were lower in the crossover groups ( MS1819 DR 2240 and 4480 
mg/day) and in dose extensions (MS1819 IR 4.4 g/day, 6.7 g/day), ranging from 50.6 to 
66.0% versus 83.3 to 89.3% for the corresponding PERT groups. 
 MS1819 was we ll-tolerated, with no remarkable adverse events and l aboratory values were 
unremarkable during the study. 
6.6.5 MS1819/18/02: A Multicentre, Open- Label Phase [ADDRESS_940131] was excluded from t he efficacy analysis 
due to a major protocol deviation (stool samples not collected properly).   For the primary endpoint, in the FAS population, mean CFA significantly increased by 5.67 
(p-value = 0.0323) from baseline to Visit 4 (end of the 2- week cycle on MS1819- SD 700 
mg/day); increased by 4.85 (p-value = 0.122) from baseline to Visit 5 (end of the 2- week 
cycle on MS1819-SD 1120 mg/day); and increased by 3.57 (p-value = 0.3653) from baseline to Visit 6 (end of the 2 -week cycle on MS1819-SD 2240 mg/day) . In the PP population, 
mean CFA significantly increased by 5.99 (p- value = 0.0316) from baseline to Visit 4; 
increased by 5.89 (p- value = 0.0513) from baseline to Visit 5; and increased by 5.66 (p-value 
= 0.1147) from baseline to Visit [ADDRESS_940132] BioPharma Inc.,   May 12, 2023  
FWB-CF-2.03   Protocol Version  2.0  Page 29 of 65 
CONFIDENTIAL  In the full analysis set (N=20) the mean %CFA at baseline was 67.3 and mean increase in 
%CFA at Visit 4, visit 5 and visit 6 were 5.7, 6.6 and 5.0 respectively. The average improvement in CFA over baseline was 5.7 percentage points. These results were supported by [CONTACT_693252], body weight and BMI. A mean increase in body weight of 1.7kg (~4 lbs) over [ADDRESS_940133] shown adrulipase to be relatively acid stable when compared to 
porcine derived lipases (see Investigator Brochure). However, it is also evident that below pH 
4.0, there is increasing inactivation of adrulipase as the pH drops. Work by [CONTACT_405823], e t al 
(2013) , has shown that in CF patients, the pH in the upper duodenum may be as low as 3.[ADDRESS_940134] been exposed to low pH in patients with or without gastric acid 
suppression. Given that in the OPTION study, mean CFA with a dose of 2240 mg/day was 56%, a level below our target of 80%, it was deemed import ant to provide more protection of 
adrulipase against acid inactivation in the stomach and upper duodenum to provide adequate 
adrulipase dose and optimal lipolytic activity in the duodenum. AZ-CF2002 evaluated 
adrulipase in an enteric capsule, but the resul ts were still below our target of 80%. This was 
likely due to the inconsistent gastric emptying of the size [ADDRESS_940135] degradation in the gastric environment but also 
allows for mixing with the fo od in the stomach and emptying along with the food in the 
duodenum. The dissolution characteristics of the adrulipase enteric microgranule s show 
lipase availability at pH 5.5 and above, and <15%  lipase release below pH [ADDRESS_940136]. 
The use of mass (g) for dose expression, rather than USP lipase units is the result of the 
biochemical difference between porcine pancreatic-derived lipase and the microbial-derived 
lipase from the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica (Aloulou et al, 2015 ).  Porcine lipase is active at pH 
>7, while peak yeast- derived lipase activity occurs at pH [ADDRESS_940137] BioPharma Inc.,   May 12, 2023  
FWB-CF-2.03   Protocol Version  2.0  Page 30 of 65 
CONFIDENTIAL  is difficult to assess the true lipolytic activity of adrulipase using olive oil as a substrate given 
the high pKa of oleic acid (the main fatty acid component of olive oil), it is not possible to 
monitor the lipolysis directly as fatty acid will remain in a protonated form and the assay  
requires the acid form. No validated conversion factor is available for conversion of USP 
lipase units to tributyrin units. It has been suggested by [CONTACT_405824]-derived lipase products that mass rather than units be used for dose expression ( Heubi et al, 2016).  
In all previous adrulipase studies the mass referred to the mass of the lipase:maltodextrin spray dried complex. Moving forward we will be referring to the actual mass of lipase in the capsule to directly communicate the mass of adrulipase (g) in the capsule. For reference to 
past studies, the low dose in Part 1 of the present study (1.2 g adrulipase/day) corresponds to 
the 2 g lipase:maltodextrin /day dose. The medium dose (1.95 g adrulipase/day) corresponds 
to the 6 g lipase:maltodextrin /day. The high dose (2.4 g adrulipase/day) corresponds to an 8 
g lipase:maltodextrin /day. There were no safety concerns with the 1.2 g or 1.95 g 
adrulipase/day doses used in prior studies.  While the 2.4 g adrulipase/day dose was no t used 
in prior studies, it is expected to be well tolerated.  
The highest dose possible in Part 1 of this study is 2.4 g adrulipase/day  (equivalent to 8 g 
lipase:maltodextrin  complex/day).  As of the authoring of protocol version 2.0, six  patients 
are enrolled in FWB -CF-2.[ADDRESS_940138] been 
dosed at 2.4 g adrulipase/day, and there have been no AEs reported.  Therefore, it is anticipated that th e 2.4 g/day dosing will continue to be well- tolerated.  
In Part 2, in  keepi[INVESTIGATOR_693229], a dose of 3.3 g adrulipase/day  
(equivalent to 10 g lipase:maltodextrin/day) is used . While the 3.3 g adrulipase/day dose has 
not been use d in prior studies, it is expected to be well tolerated  based on adrulipase’s safety 
profile in the current study (FWB -CF-2.03) and prior clinical studies to date (discussed in 
Section 6.6 ). This higher dose requires two more capsules per meal, but the sam e number of 
capsules per snack.

CONFIDENTIAL  8 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
This is a Phase 2, single arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_693230]. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis who 
are [ADDRESS_940141] been clinically controlled , including minimal signs and symptoms of EPI, on a stable dose of commercia l 
pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) for at least one month.  
Patients on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapi[INVESTIGATOR_693216] a stable dose for at least [ADDRESS_940142] one month prior to study entry and no dose changes will be made during the study. 
Upon obtaining an informed consent, potentially eligible patients will receive dietary 
counseling during the week prior to confinement for collecting stool samples for calculation 
of baseline coefficient of fat absorption (CFA). This counseling will emphasize the importance of dietary stability during the  study. Patients found to have a CFA of 80% or greater while 
receiving their commercial PERT and meeting the other eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study. 
The study will enroll patients into either Part 1 (under protocol version 1.0) or Part 2 (under 
protocol version 2.0).  Upon study enrol lment, the patient will be switched from their 
commercial PERT to receive adrulipase. The patient will remain on study for  approximately 
three weeks  for Part [ADDRESS_940143] BioPharma , the end of study supervised confinement may be done prior to the two 
or three weeks on adrulipase.  
For Part 1, a  dose titration scheme will be used for determining whether a low, medium, or 
high dose of adrulipase can succeed in controlling signs and symptoms of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) and provide a CFA of 80% or greater. Patients will initially receive a low 
dose of adrulipase. Upon the appearance of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_693231], and upon 
discussion with the investigator, the patient will be switched to the medium dose of adrulipase. If signs and symptoms of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_693232], the patient will be switched to the 
high dose of adrulipase. After patients reach three  weeks of study and complete their end of 
study CFA, they will be returned to their pre-study commercial PERT preparation therapy.  
For Part 2, a dose of 3.3 g/day adrulipase will be used for all patients.  After patients reach two 
weeks of study treatment and complete their end of study CFA, they will be returned to their 
pre-study commercial PERT. An end of study safety visit will be scheduled to occur  one week 
after finishing adrulipase therapy. 
An end of study safety visit will be scheduled for approximately one week after finishing 
adrulipase therapy.

CONFIDENTIAL  Safety assessments will be made by [CONTACT_178431], safety lab assessments, and 
immunologic assays to assess drug induced immune responses.   
For Part 1, dosages will ideally  be fractionated as follows: 1/4 of the daily dose at each  of 
3 main meals, and 1/8 at each of the 2 snacks. The patients will be instructed to consume ~25 
g of fat with every main meal and 12.5 g of fat with each of the 2 snacks to approximate a high fat meal of 100 g of fat/day. The 1.2 g/day dose will be fractionated as follows: 2 capsules of 
150 mg with the morning, noontime , and evening meals , plus 1 capsule of 150 mg with the 
morning and evening snacks. The 1.95 g/day dose will be fractionated as follows: 3 capsules 
with each of the three main meals, and 2 capsules with each of the two snacks. The 2.4 g/day 
dose will be fractionated as follows: 4 capsules with each of the three main meals and 2 
capsules with each  of the two snacks.  
For Part 2, The 3.3 g/day dose will be fractionated as follows: [ADDRESS_940144] discussed the variation with the ir PI [INVESTIGATOR_693233].   
This study is divided into 3 main periods.  
• Screening Period including supervised confine ment (up to 14 days) 
• Adrulipase Treatment Period including supervised confinement (approximately  
21 days for Part 1 patients or 14 days for Part 2 patien ts)  
• End-of-Study/Early Withdrawal (approximately  7 days) 
Refer  to Section 3 for the Schedule of Assessments.  
8.1.1 Amended Study Design 
For analysis purposes, this amended portion of the study will be referred to as Part 2.  Refer 
to Section 3 for the amended SoA for Part 2.  
Patients who begin on Part 2 of the protocol will receive a higher dose (
 3.3 g/day) for 
treatment.  Patient safety data for adrulipase at lower doses ( ranging from 1.2  g/day to 
1.95 g/day) supports it as safe and well -tolerated  (Section  6.7).  Therefore, patients will not 
undergo titration in Part [ADDRESS_940145] BioPharma Inc.,   May 12, 2023

8.3.4 Removal of Patients from the Study   
A patient may be withdrawn from the study at any time for any of the following reason s: 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Voluntary w ithdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_102] , for any reason, at any time 
• Major protocol deviations that could compromise the interpretation of the study 
results  
• Occurrence of an immunoallergic reaction  
• Occurrence of an adverse reaction ( i.e., an SAE related to IMP) that justif ies the 
discontinuation of the IMP 
• Pregnancy 
The date of withdrawal and the reason for withdrawal must be fully documented in the case report form (CRF) and a short narrative description should be added in the patient’s medical records.  
If at the time of withdrawal, the patient has received the investigational study product (partially 
or totally), study staff should encourage the patient to complete  the E arly Termination  Visit 
(Visit  7) for follow -up safety investigations. These patients will be included in the mITT 
efficacy and safety analyse s. 
If the reason for discontinuation is due to an AE, then the I nvestigator will seek to obtain 
follow -up information and to document the event until its resolution or stabilization. In any 
case, the Investigator will take all necessary measures to ensure the patient's safety and ensure 
the patient is treated in accordance with local standard of care.  
If a patient is lost to follow -up, then the I nvestigator should make every effort to obtain 
maximum in formation on the reasons for the nonattendance to the visit and on the patient’s 
state of health. All attempts will be documented in the patient’s medical records.  
Pregnancy  
Patients  will be instructed that known or suspected pregnancy occurring during the  study, in 
patients  or female partners of male patients , should be confirmed and immediately reported to

Dosing must have occurred for at least 16 days (Part 1) or 10 days (Part 2) prior to the 
supervised confinements. Beginning at breakfast (the first meal) on Day 1 of the supervised 
confinement, patients will be placed on a 72- hour controlled diet, with  ~25 g fat/meal and 
12.5 g fat/snack for a total of 100 g fat/day (3 meals and 2 snacks per day) and a minimum of 
1.[ADDRESS_940160] the patient consume 
exactly 100 g of fat per day, the fat excretion assay remains valid with a fat intake range within 15% of the goal ( i.e., 85 to 115 g of fat per day). The nutritional planning and calculation of 
dietary fat and nitrogen (protein) intake will be conducted by a qualified dietician at each site. The actual fat and nitrogen (protein) intake will be calculated from the recorded type and amount of food consumed. A central laboratory will calculate CFA, CNA based on dietary 
intake and the fat and nitrogen excreted in stool. Stool weight values will also be recorded.  
An indicator marker (500 mg of Food, Drug, and Cosmetics [FD&C] Blue #2) will be provided 
as two 250- mg capsules. The first marker (consisting of two 250 -mg capsules) will be given at 
the beginning of breakfast or first meal on Day 1 of the supervised conf inement to mark the 
start of the controlled diet. The second marker (two 250 -mg capsules) will be given at the 
beginning of breakfast or first meal on Day [ADDRESS_940161] marker has passed (the first stool containing the first marker is discarded) and is completed when the second marker has passed (the first stool containing the second marker is collected). Patients must continue the supervised confinement until the second stool marker is passed. The controlled diet will be maintained until the patient takes the second marker. Although it is not part of the controlled diet, the breakfast or first meal consumed on Day 4 of the supervised confinement 
should mimic (as closely as possible) the breakfast or first meal consumed on Day [ADDRESS_940162] dye 
marker capsules, or within 2 days after ing esting the second dye marker capsules, then 5-10 mg 
of oral bisacodyl may be given. Bisacodyl is the only laxative that may be given during the 
marker- to-marker stool collection period. Note: Patients  on a stable chronic osmotic laxative 
may continue this therapy during the marker- to-marker stool collection.  
The supervised confinement may take place within an inpatient facility or within an alternative confinement setting. This will be discussed and approved on an individual case basis by [CONTACT_693259].  The alternative confinement setting will require the supervision of trained 
study site staff to oversee the study procedures. 
[ADDRESS_940163] medical occurrence experienced by a patient  in a clinical investigation; 
it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this study drug. An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom , or disease temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Active or worsening of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405795].  Worsening 
of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_693240].   
Adverse event s may also include post dose  complications that occur as a result of 
protocol- mandated procedures ( e.g., invasive procedures such as venipuncture, biopsy, etc.).  
Preexisting  events that increase in severity or change in nature during, or as a consequence of,  
use of a medicinal product in a human clinical study will also be considered AEs.  Any preexisting  medical condition or diagnosis associated with a clinically significant laboratory 
abnormality should be documented on the CRF or eCRF.  The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and other clinical information. In such cases, the unifying diagnosis should be documented as the AE, rather than the individual signs and symptoms ( e.g., runny nose, scratch throat, cough, and low grade fever should be 
recorded as an  upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_693241]). 
An AE does NOT include the following: 
• Medical or surgical procedures ( e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion); the condition that necessitates the procedure is an AE 
• Any pre existing  disease or condition or laboratory abnormality present or detected 
before the start of administration of study medication that does not worsen  
• Laboratory abnormalities without clinical manifestations, which do not require 
medical intervention, or that do not result in termination or delay of study medication  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred ( e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63805], social, or convenience admissions)  
• Overdose of any study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms, unless the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913] 
• Worsening and/or flares of EPI [CONTACT_259118]. This should be recorded in the 
appropriate E PI [CONTACT_87479].  However, if disease worsening meets any of the criteria for 
an SAE , it must be recorded on the SAE form and reported to First Wave 
BioPharma  or designee within [ADDRESS_940164] BioPharma Inc.,   May 12, 2023  
FWB-CF-2.03   Protocol Version  2.0  Page 48 of 65 
CONFIDENTIAL  10.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any adverse experience occurring at any dose of study medication that 
occurs between the time the patient signs the informed consent form through the end -of-study 
that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening situation (patient is at im mediate risk of death)  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] a clinically 
relevant reason (note that this excludes “social” hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693242] ) 
• Persistent or sig nificant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a patient who received study 
drug 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or patient may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition .  
Examples may include, but are not limited to: 
o Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm 
o Blood dyscrasias that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
o Seizures t hat do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37349] “serious” is any in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256170] a minimum of an overnight stay in a health care facility.   
Worsening and/or flares of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_693243] .  
However, if disease worsening meets any of the criteria for a n SAE , then it must be recorded 
on the SAE form and reported to First Wave BioPharma  or designee within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the eve nt. 
10.1.3 “Serious” vs “Severe” Adverse Event  
To avoid confusion or misunderstanding over the difference between the terms “serious” and “severe,” which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is provided (excerpted from International Council for Harmonisation [ICH] E2A):  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such a s severe headache).  This is not the same as “serious,” which 
is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a 
First Wave BioPharma Inc.,   May 12, 2023  
FWB-CF-2.03   Protocol Version  2.0  Page 49 of 65 
CONFIDENTIAL  threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defin ing 
regulatory reporting obligations.  
10.1.4 SAE Definition Clarifications 
• Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AE in itself.  
• All deaths during study through the end-of-study, regardless of cause or 
relationship, must be reported . 
• “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the patient  is actively receiving study 
drug at the time of the event. 
• “Life -threatening” means that the patient  was at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death, had it occurred with greater severity.  
• Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98176].  If an AE prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is an SAE.  
• “In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28689]” means the patient has been formally admitted to a 
hospit al for medical reasons, for any length of time,  excepting situations where an 
untoward medical occurrence has not occurred ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_90676], social, or convenience admissions). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693244].  It does not include presentation and care within an emergency department (although an emergency department visit may define a medically important event, which is also considered an SAE).   
• If any AE worsens during the study and eventually meets the criteria for an SAE the AE should be recorded as a new SAE. 
 
10.2 Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events 
AEs will be recorded in the CRF for all patients from the time the patient signs the informed 
consent form through the end of the study or patient  withdrawal.  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs (as defined in  Section  10.1 and as 
further specified below) observed by [CONTACT_693260] ’ medical records, in the CRF, and as an SAE in the electronic data 
capture system.  These AEs will include th e following:  
1. All SAEs (as defined in  Section  10.1.2) that occur.  
1. All nonserious AEs (as defined in  Section  10.1.1 ) that occur. 
The following AE attributes must be assigned by [CONTACT_737]:   
• AE diagnosis or syndrome(s) (if known, signs or symptoms if not known);  
• event description (with detail appropriate to the event);  
First Wave BioPharma Inc.,   May 12, 2023  
FWB-CF-2.03   Protocol Version  2.0  Page 50 of 65 
CONFIDENTIAL  • dates of onset and resolution; severity; assessment of relatedness to study drug ; and 
• action taken with study medication.   
The Investigator may be asked to provide follow -up informati on, discharge summaries, and 
extracts from medical records or CRFs.  
It will be left to the Investigator’s clinical judgment to determine whether the relatedness of an  
AE, and of sufficient severity to require the patient’s removal from treatment or from th e study. 
A patient may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment because of  what he or she perceives 
as an intolerable AE. If either of these situations arises, the patient should be strongly 
encouraged to complete the End-of- Therapy assessments and be under medical supervision 
until symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable.  
10.3 Grading of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will be asked to provide an assessment of the severity of the AE using the 
categories noted below.  This assessment is subjective, and the Investigator should use medical 
judgment to compare the reported AE to similar events observed in clinical practice.  It is important to recognize that severity is not equivalent to event seriousness. 
Grade 1 (Mild) :  usually 
 transient; requires no speci al treatment and does not generally 
interfere with the patient ’s daily activities.  
Grade 2 (Moderate):  produces a mild to mode rate level of inconvenience to the patient  and 
may interfere with daily activities.  These events are usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_693261].  
Grade 3 (Severe) :  significantl y interrupts daily activity and requires systemic drug therapy 
or other medical treatment.  
10.[ADDRESS_940165] make an assessment of  the relationship of the 
event to the study drug using the following scale: 
Unrelated :  The event is definitely not or unlikely associated with study drug administration 
and is judged because of  causes other than the study drug. 
Related :  Events considered to be related are those that follow a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the study drug, that are not easily explained by [CONTACT_405834]’s cli nical state or other treatment or 
confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_405801] (de-challenge), if applicable.

FWB-CF-2.03   Protocol Version  2.0  Page 51 of 65 
CONFIDENTIAL  10.5 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Procedures  
Serious adverse events will be recorded from the time the patient  signs the informed consent 
form through the end of study.  AEs will be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes, or 
until the end of study for that patient. 
If the AE is an SAE and is assessed as “related to study drug”, it must be follow ed until either 
the event is considered stable or resolved.  
Any SAE assessed as “unrelated to study drug” will be followed as clinically indicated until 
its resolution or, if not resolving, until considered stable or until the final study visit for that patient whichever comes first.  
All SAEs that occur must be reported within [ADDRESS_940166] as well as 
the End-of-Therapy CRF.  
The Investigator should notify the appropriate IEC/IRB of SAEs occurring at the site and other 
SAE reports received from First Wave BioPharma, in accordance with local procedures and 
statutes.  
First Wave BioPharma  will ensure that applicable regulatory authorities receive all relevant 
information on an SAE, in accordance with regulatory requirements.  Results of First Wave 
BioPharma’s  investigation of other safety information shall be submitted, as required.  
10.[ADDRESS_940167] during 
the study.  The following actions should be taken in the event of a confirmed pregnancy: 
1. For female patients , study drug should be discontinued immediately. 
2. The pregnancy should be reported to the Safety Group  within 24 hours of 
notification using the applicable Pregnancy Report Form. 
3. The Investigator should counsel the patient  regarding t he possible effects of 
previous study drug exposure on the fetus and the need to inform the study site of 
the outcome of the pregnancy. 
4. The patient or the patient ’s pregnant partner must be monitored until the immedia te 
postnatal period or until terminatio n of the pregnancy.  The outcome should be 
reported to the Medical Monitor using the Pregnancy Outcome Form. 
First Wave BioPharma Inc.,   May 12, 2023  
FWB-CF-2.03   Protocol Version  2.0  Page 52 of 65 
CONFIDENTIAL  Pregnancy is not an AE in and of itself. However, any pregnancy complications or elective 
termination s of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE.  A 
spontaneous abortion is always considered an SAE and will be reported as described in the AE 
and SAE sections  (Section 10.2 and Section 10.5) .  Furthermore, any SAE occurring as an 
adverse pregnancy outcome post study  must be reported to the Medical Monitor.  
10.7 Hepatic Monitoring  
The following guidelines are provided for the management of serum transaminase elevations in patients  with new, clinically meaningful increases in liver function tests occurring during 
the study. All cases of new (i.e., since screening) elevations in ALT or AST ε [ADDRESS_940168] or 
any questions concerning the management of a patient with elevated serum transaminases 
should be discussed with the study Medical Monitor.  
Patients  who experienc e a new ( i.e., since screening) elevation in ALT or AST level to 
≥3 × ULN OR total bilirubin ≥1.5 × ULN will have hepatic monitoring (ALT, AST, Bilirubin) 
until one of the following occurs:  
• Withdrawal from study if elevation in ALT or AST level to ≥3 × ULN is associated 
with a rise in total serum bilirubin to ≥2 × ULN (without laboratory findings of 
cholestasis [elevated serum alkaline phosphatase ≥2 × ULN])  
• Withdrawal from study if elevation in ALT or AST level to ≥5 × ULN is associated 
with new or exacerbated gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms ( i.e., nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain, and/or jaundice) and other causes are not evident 
• Withdrawal from th e study if elevation in ALT or AST is ≥10 × ULN regardless of 
serum bilirubin level  
 Causes of acute elevation of transaminases should be considered and ruled out (e.g., viral 
hepatitis, concomitant medications).  
Patients  discontinued from study drug administration should resume porcine PERT therapy 
according to physician prescription.   
10.8 Appropriateness of Measurements 
The efficacy and safety assessments planned for this study are widely used and generally 
recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant to the assessment of biological products 
administered to patients with CF.  
11 STATISTICAL METHODS  
11.1 General Considerations  
The statistical methods will be further detailed in the Statistical Analys is Plan (SAP).  
First Wave BioPharma Inc.,   May 12, 2023  
FWB-CF-2.03   Protocol Version  2.0  Page 53 of 65 
CONFIDENTIAL  Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
only if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and the description for makin g the change, will be d escribed 
in the SAP and in the clinical study report. Additional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate.  
Statistical methodology and analyses will be in accordance with the principles outlined by [CONTACT_693262] (ICH) E9 guidelines.   
Tables, listings, and figures will be produced in accordance with the principles outlined by [CONTACT_165954] E3 guidelines.   
Summaries will consist of descriptive statistics including the non missing  counts, mean, 
standard  deviation, median, Inter quartiles (IQ) , minimum and maximum values for continuous 
variables, and number and percentage of patients  in each defined category for categorical 
variables.  
The primary efficacy endpoint analysis aims to compare the mean CFA after receiving 
adrulipase vs porcine PERT.  With the sample size to be employed, primary efficacy analysis 
will be descriptive rather than inferential.  
As a general rule, missing data will not be replaced.  
11.2 Sample Size Determination 
Based upon CFA data obtained in previous studies with adrulipase, 12 patients per adrulipase 
dose should provide sufficient point estimates of CFA in each group. Given the acceptable 
safety profile obtained in the previous study, a sample of 1 2 patients sh ould be adequate for 
observation of safety per dose of adrulipase . This study will use descriptive analyses for both 
safety and efficacy analyses.  
11.3 Analysis Sets 
• Safety Set: patients re
 ceiving at least one dose of treatment. Patients will be 
analyzed accord ing to the treatment actually received. The Safety Set will be used 
for all analyses of safety endpoints unless specified otherwise and for the 
summaries  of patients in listings related to dosing of study drug. 
• Efficacy sets: 
o mITT S et: All
 randomized patients receiving at least one dose of treatment  
and have at least one valid stool collection and CFA post baseline while receiving their assigned study drug. The mITT set is considered as the 
primary set for the efficacy analysis. The mITT set will be used for all 
analyses of efficacy endpoints. 
o Per Protocol S et: Subset of the mITT set comprising all patients who do not 
violate the terms of the protocol in a way that would affect the study outcome significantly, as determined by [CONTACT_1003]. Protocol

11.4 Handling Missing Data  
Missing data will not be replaced.    
11.5 Demographic, Other Baseline Characteristics and Medication 
Demographics, other baseline characteristics, and medications will be summarized for the 
Safety Set unles s specified otherwise.  
11.5.1 Patient Disposition and Withdrawals 
The following will be summarized:  
• Number of screen failures  
• Number of patients included in the ITT , and PP sets  
• Number of patients who completed the study  
• Number of patients who discontinued the study early with reasons  
The patient disposition, and protocol deviations will be listed.  
11.5.2 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summarized in the Safety Set:  
• For each dose (i.e., 1.2 g/day, 1.95 g/day, 2.4 g/day , or 3.3 g/day) 
• for all patients  
11.6 Safety Analysis   
Safety ( AEs, SAEs, discontinuations due to adverse events , and safety laboratory  values) will

CONFIDENTIAL  11.7  Efficacy Analysis   
11.7.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the CFA assessed at the  end of the approximately 
21-day treatment period  (Part 1) or 14 -day treatment period (Part 2). CFA will be calculated 
as follows:  
CFA (%) = 100 ((fat intake (g) − fat excretion (g))/ fat intake (g))  
Primary Analysis:   
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be a comparison of the mean CFAs from the 
adrulipase treatment vs the PERT treatment (screening) , using descriptive statistics.  Data will 
be analyzed according to the protocol version under which patients  enroll  (ie, Part 1 [protocol 
version 1.0] or Part 2 [protocol version 2.0]) according to the SAP.  
11.7.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Coefficie nt of nitrogen absorption (CNA)  will be calculated and analyzed in the same manner 
as CFA.  
Stool weights, signs and symptoms for malabsorption, body weight, and will be analyzed using 
descriptive methods.

13 ETHICS  
13.1 Ethics and Regulatory Considerations 
The current study is to be conducted in accordance with globally accepted standards of GCP 
(ICH -E6), the Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC , the GCP Directive 2005/28/EC , the revised 
version of the Declaration of Helsinki set out in the European Directive, and with applicable 
local requirements.  
The protocol will be submitted to the Health Authorities and a pro perly constituted IEC or IRB 
for formal approval of the study conduct in accordance with local regulations. 
The study may not begin until the protocol has received appropriate approval from the Health 
Authorities in accordance with local requirements.  
In accordance with specific local requirements, the Investigator may be responsible for submitting the protocol and any amendments to the local IEC/IRB. A copy of the decision letter, a list and versions of documents submitted, and a  list of IEC/IRB members and their 
affiliation should be provided by [CONTACT_693266] . 
During the study, First Wave BioPharma  should promptly notify the Investigators and Health 
Authorities of any relevant information that could affect the safety of patients or effect  on the 
conduct of the study. The regulatory authorities will be notified that the study has ended on 
completion of the study. 
13.[ADDRESS_940173] of the Study 
The Investigator(s) and all parties involved in this study should conduct the study in adherence 
to the ethical principles based on the Declaration of Helsinki, GCP, ICH guidelines, and 
applicable national laws, local laws, and regulatory requirements. 
13.3 Informed Consent  
An IRB/ IEC approved telephone informed consent to ensure that subjects come into clinic only 
if interested in proceeding with screening procedures is encouraged.  
Before a patient ’s participation in this clinical study, the Investigator is responsible for 
obtaining written informed consent from the patient or legally acceptable representative after 
adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the 
study and before  any protocol -specific screening procedure s or any investigational products

under applicable law to consent, on behalf of a prospective patient, to the patient ’s participation 
in the clinical study.  The Investigator is also responsible for asking the patient if th e patient 
agrees to have his/her primary care physician informed of the patient’s participation in the clinical study.  If the patient agrees to such notification, the Investigator shall inform the patient’s primary care physician of the patient’s participation in the clinical study . 
The acquisition of informed consent and the patient ’s agreement or refusal of his/her 
notification of the primary care physician should be documented in the patien t’s medical 
records, and the informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_405843] a legally acceptable representative and by [CONTACT_28490] (not necessarily an Investigator).  The original signed informed consent form should be retained in accordance with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form should be provided to the patient or legally acceptable representative.  
If a potential patient is illiterate or visually impaired  and does not have a legally acceptable 
representative, then the Investigator must provide an impartial witness to read the informed 
consent form to the patient and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the patient  and the 
witness must sign the informed consent form to attest that informed consent was freely given and understood.

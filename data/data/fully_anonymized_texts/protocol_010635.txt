Summary of Changes from Previous Version: 10012020 v 2.001  
Affected Section(s)  Summary of Revisions Made  Rationale  
1.1 Study duration increased to 36 
months. The duration of the study will continue 
for 36 months, in part due to COVID-19 
pandemic-related delays.  
5.1, 6.5 Changed inclusion criteria, added 
4. to indicated need for ‘stable 
medical therapy for cardiac 
sarcoidosis for at least 30 days’. This is to clarify that it is important to 
avoid changes in background therapi[INVESTIGATOR_319093]. 
5.2, 6.5, 8.2.2 Changed exclusion criteria, added 
8. to include only Tumor Necrosis 
Factor- blockers as contra-
indicated medications. This is also 
clarified in Concomitant 
Medications and Risks Reduction 
Strategies for Anakinra treatment.  This is consistent with the Food & Drug 
Administration Prescribing Information 
for Anakinra (Kineret®) that allows the 
drug to be prescribed with other 
immunomodulating medications other 
than Tumor Necrosis Factor-  blockers.  
This will reduce the number of screen 
failures among the patients being 
considered.   
8.1.1 Changes to biomarkers, added the 
use of additional exploratory 
cytokine bioassays available 
through LabCorp. We deleted the 
plan for storage of samples at VCU 
as part of this study. The additional cytokine bioassays may 
provide insight into the pathobiology of 
the disease.

in patients with heart disease, showing a low rate of predictable complications, making it the preferred 
anti-inflammatory agent to be studied in cardiac sarcoidosis.  
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
2.3.[ADDRESS_392969]-segment elevation acute 
myocardial infarction, and chronic systolic heart failure. The use of anakinra as an anti-inflammatory 
treatment for cardiac sarcoidosis is justified by [CONTACT_319112]’s relatively low risk/benefit ratio. Anakinra has 
been used in more than 150,000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis with a favorable risk profile.1 
Interleukin-1 blockade in cardiac sarcoidosis Version 3.001
Protocol MAGiC ART 31 AUG 2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017-04-07 13  
Anakinra is given as a subcutaneous injection of 100 mg (0.67 mL) daily or every other day in patients with 
severe impairment in renal function. There is no loading dose and no dose-adjustments needed with age, 
weight, or liver failure. Drug-to-drug interactions have not been reported. There are no known toxic 
effects of anakinra in pregnancy (category B), however pregnant women will be excluded from this 
research study. In a study following patients with rheumatoid arthritis for up to [ADDRESS_392970] likely side effects associated with the use of anakinra include: 
 Injection site reaction (>10%, up to 50%, but infrequently leading to interruption of treatment <5%) 
 Serious Infection (1.8% in anakinra vs 0.6% in placebo in clinical trial of rheumatoid arthritis); 
 Headache, generally mild and self-limiting (1-10%); 
 Diarrhea, generally mild and self-limiting (1-10%); 
 Nausea, generally mild and self-limiting (1-10%); 
 Hypersensitivity reaction (rash, anaphylaxis, arthritis)(rare, 1-2%). 
 Neutropenia (rare, <1%, reversible). 
  
The injection site reactions are by [CONTACT_319113].2 The reactions present as 
painful irritation/redness at the site of injection usually occurring 1-2 weeks after start of treatment. They 
are responsive to topi[INVESTIGATOR_109948]/or antihistamine therapy. The reactions are common (up to 50%) 
but rarely cause of discontinuation of therapy (<5%). 
  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_319097], such events are rather rare (<2% during 
chronic treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis already on other immunomodulating drugs 
[observational data]). Anakinra is indeed not associated with an increase in infection-related mortality, 
nor associated with opportunistic infection. In clinical trials with anakinra, the infection rates did not differ 
between active treatment and placebo. Anakinra may, however, mask some of the signs of infection such 
as fever and leukocytosis, and therefore education on the need to be aware of risk of infection is 
warranted. Nevertheless, when given to patients with sepsis in the setting of a clinical trial, anakinra had 
no negative effect on survival. While anakinra is postulated to prevent inflammatory-based 
hypercoagulability, anakinra has not been associated with any appreciable bleeding risk in pre-clinical, 
clinical, or post-marketing surveillance (including animal studies at >100X the clinically relevant dose). 
  
2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS 
  
Interleukin-1 blockade in cardiac sarcoidosis Version 3.001
Protocol MAGiC ART 31 AUG 2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_392971]. Abbate [VCU], treatment with anakinra was 
shown to be safe and associated with reduced incidence of heart failure in patients with ST-segment 
elevation MI (STEMI)3and with improved cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_319098].4, 5In the large CANTOS trial of 10,061 patients with previous myocardial infarction 
and elevated CRP (≥2 mg/L), canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody blocking interleukin- 1beta, led to a 
15% significantly lower rate of atherothrombotic events6, a 36% reduction in need for coronary 
revascularization6 and a dose-dependent reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19934].[ADDRESS_392972]. Abbate’s team, patients with systolic heart failure treated with 
canakinumab experienced a significant improvement in cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863] (peak VO2) and cardiac 
function (LVEF).8 In all instances, the clinical improvement correlated with reduction of the systemic 
inflammatory biomarkers, namely CRP, showing a dose-response relationship between CRP reduction and 
benefits observed. 
  
The hypothesis being tested is that Anakinra (Kineret) will inhibit the systemic inflammatory response in 
patients with cardiac sarcoidosis. As with all clinical trials, there is no guarantee that there is a benefit 
with anakinra. If anakinra treatment reduces inflammatory biomarkers, this could have a substantial 
potential benefit on the disease severity. 
2.3.[ADDRESS_392973] been tested in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis. The 
unanswered question remains whether IL-1 is a key mediator (versus a manifestation) of systemic and 
cardiac inflammation in cardiac sarcoidosis. This proposal will investigate whether IL-1 blockade can 
reduce systemic inflammatory biomarkers. The findings will then form the basis for the subsequent design 
of a phase II-III clinical trials. 
  
Risks reduction strategies for Anakinra treatment  
The risks associated with Anakinra appear to be mostly related to risk of infection (1.8% vs 0.6% of serious 
infections in a rheumatoid arthritis study), and injection site reactions. To better estimate the risk, one 
needs to place the estimates in context: the estimated 2% risk of serious infection with anakinra quoted 
in the FDA approved package insert refers to the use of anakinra/Kineret as second line agent for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, in which anakinra was used in addition to corticosteroids or other 
disease-modifying agents further increasing infectious risk. The risk of infection of anakinra monotherapy 
is not known, but it does not appear to be high. In a study cohort of patients with Neonatal Onset 
Multisystem Inflammatory Disease, another autoinflammatory condition for which anakinra is indicated, 
no dose limiting toxicities were reported for anakinra over the 148.1 patient-year study period: there were 
only 3 serious infections reported (2 wound infections and 1 gastroenteritis) and in all 3 cases, treatment 
Interleukin-1 blockade in cardiac sarcoidosis Version 3.001
Protocol MAGiC ART 31 AUG 2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017-04-07 15with anakinra was considered possibly related to the event, however treatment was not discontinued and 
patients improved with antibiotics. Moreover, if one considers the ‘excess risk’ of serious infection with 
anakinra to evenly distributed through the year, a treatment of 1 month, would lead to an excess risk that 
is less than then 1.2% difference reported in the prescribing information. Nevertheless, the inherent anti-
inflammatory activity of anakinra may potentially mask some of the signs of infection such as fever and 
leukocytosis. In the CANTOS trial, canakinumab, another IL-1 blocker was associated with a 0.1% excess 
risk of life-threatening infection per year compared with placebo – canakinumab, at difference with 
anakinra, is long-acting and it cannot be stopped in case of infection, and therefore one would consider 
the risk of life-threatening infections with anakinra given for 1 month to be 10-fold lower than 
canakinumab for 1 year. 
  
To reduce the risk of infections with anakinra we plan to follow the following strategies: 
 Exclude patients with acute or chronic infections at time of screening; 
 Exclude patients with concomitant biologic immunomodulating medications, such as TNF-a blockers; 
 Exclude patients who are neutropenic; 
 Educate patients on the possibility that symptoms or signs of infections may be less evident with taking 
the investigational drug; 
 Provide patient with 24/7 phone access to investigators to discuss potential symptoms or signs of 
infection; 
With this plan in place we have not seen any issues with severe infections since our first clinical trial with 
anakinra in acute STEMI in 2008 including now over 200 patients.

4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DOSE 
Anakinra is available for use with a label indication for rheumatoid arthritis and cryopyrin-associated 
periodic syndromes9 and it has a very favorable safety profile.10 The 100 mg daily subcutaneously is the 
currently approved dose on the FDA label, that has been shown to be efficacious across a wide range of 
clinical conditions, including heart failure,11,12 and also meets conditions for an IND exemption according 
to the criteria listed in § 312.2(b) of the federal regulation (see letter from FDA official). Treatment for 2-
4 weeks has been shown to be efficacious in reducing inflammatory plasma biomarkers and improving 
exercise capacity in patients with systolic heart failure with [LOCATION_001] Heart Association class II-IV 
symptoms.4,5,13,14,15 We also recently completed a phase IB/II study in patients with pulmonary arterial 
hypertension and right ventricular failure treated with anakinra showing a significant reduction in 
inflammatory biomarkers after 2 weeks.8 Anakinra 100 mg daily for 14 days was also as effective as 100

5.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA 
Patients with sarcoidosis will be screened according to the following criteria (all 3 criteria need to be met): 
 
Clinical diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis  according to either the  
Heart Rhythm Society  Diagnostic Criteria  based on one of the 2 diagnosis pathways (see below):

caseating granuloma on histologic examination of myocardial tissue with no alternative cause identified 
(including negative stain for microorganisms – as applicable); 
2. Clinical diagnosis from invasive and/or non-invasive studies – it is probable that there is cardiac 
sarcoidosis if there is (a) histological diagnosis of extracardiac sarcoidosis and (b) one or more of the 
following: steroid +/- immunosuppressant responsive cardiomyopathy or heart block; unexplained 
reduction in LVEF (<40%); unexplained sustained (spontaneous or induced) ventricular tachycardia; 
Mobitz type II 2nd degree or 3rd degree AV block; patchy uptake on dedicated cardiac PET (in a pattern 
consistent with cardiac sarcoidosis); late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance (in a 
pattern consistent with cardiac sarcoidosis); positive gallium uptake (in a pattern consistent with cardiac 
sarcoidosis) and (c) other causes for the cardiac manifestation(s) have been reasonable excluded.

In the cases labelled by * treatment may be restarted by [CONTACT_319118]. 
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY 
Patient withdrawal  
Patients may withdraw from the study at any time. The investigators can withdraw any patient at any time 
from the study if medically necessary. Missing data will not be inputted. The decision regarding 
continuation or termination of the study will be solely based on safety data. Interim analyses will be 
performed by [CONTACT_319119]. 
  
It will be documented whether or not each patient completed the study. If for any reason the study 
treatment or observations were discontinued, the reasons will be recorded and the IRB will be informed. 
  
Reasons for early termination of the study  
The decision regarding continuation or termination of the study will be solely based on safety data, and 
will be made by [CONTACT_4318]. Interim analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_4318]. 
  
Halting rules  
The study will be temporarily suspended if any of the following conditions are met: 
 Any serious adverse event that probably or definitely related to the investigational product ; 
Interleukin-1 blockade in cardiac sarcoidosis Version 3.001
Protocol MAGiC ART 31 AUG 2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017-04-07 27 The number of subjects experiencing a serious adverse event considered unrelated or only possibly related  
to the investigational product exceeds 50% (after the first 3 or more subjects are enrolled); 
 The number of subjects experiencing either a serious adverse event considered unrelated or only possibly 
related to the investigational product or a non-serious adverse event of at least moderate intensity that is 
probably or definitely related  to the investigational product exceeds 75%. 
If any of these conditions are met, the enrollment is halted until the DSMB is given the opportunity to 
review the data. After the assessment of the DSMB, a discussion with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_75534] (NCATS) 
should be held prior to the final decision to resume or permanently stop the study. 
  
Example of data provided to the DSMB:

7.[ADDRESS_392988] TO FOLLOW-UP 
  
The investigational treatment will be given for 28 days.  Participants will be followed for 180 days.  The 
patients are regularly followed in clinic and will be chosen for their compliance. The proposed study is also 
designed to be short, only 4 weeks. All study participants will receive cards with 24-hour/7-day contact 
[CONTACT_319115]. This approach has been sufficient to achieve a 90% retention on average 
in prior studies of IL-1 blockade in HF at VCU. 
  
We will also implement a patient reimbursement of $100 for each of 3 compled study visits 
(Randomization Visit, 28-day Visit, and 60-day Visit) up to a total of $300 for completion of these study 
visits. 
  
We believe this may overcome some financial barriers that our patients at VCU Health and Michigan 
Medicine (formerly University of Michigan Health System) may experience related to the time and cost of 
travel. We will collect data on enrollment and retention barriers to help enhance the success of a future 
phase 3 trial. The power analysis has also taken into account a potential loss of data at follow up to 
20%.  Missing data will not be inputted.

8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
8.1.1     Biomarkers  
  
Blood samples will be taken from a peripheral vein at time of screening, randomization visit and the 28-
day visit, and used for analysis of inflammatory markers - high-sensitivity C reactive protein (CRP) and 
Interleukin-6 (IL-6). 
  
Samples will be processed by [CONTACT_319120], as standard of care tests are 
processed. 
  
We will compare interval changes in CRP and IL-6 between the 2 groups using an analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) for repeated measures and assessing for time_x_group interaction. 
 
Additional exploratory analyses will be conducted on cytokines from sera of patients with bioassays 
available through LabCorp.  
  
8.1.2      Quality of life questionnaires  
  
Quality of life (QoL) scores will be measured at randomization and 28-day visit with the disease-specific 
Sarcoidosis Assessment Tool (SAT), which has been shown to be reliable and consistent in sarcoidosis-
specific patient reported outcomes at baseline and at [ADDRESS_392990]. Marc Judson at University 
of Albany.  
  
We will compare interval changes in SAT QoL scores between the 2 groups using an analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) for repeated measures and assessing for time_x_group interaction. 
  
The following assessments of efficacy will be performed at VCU only as part of an imaging substudy.  
  
 
 8.1.[ADDRESS_392991] abnormal ECG Holter 
recordings. A 24-hour ECG Holter will be performed within 30 day of randomization and 28 14 days 
follow-up to quantitate arrhythmias.  Arrhythmia data collected will include: (1) number, duration, and 
rate of sustained ventricular tachycardias;  (2) number, duration, and rate of non-sustained ventricular

type of AV blocks; (5) number and duration of sinus pauses; and (6) occurrence of atrial 
arrhythmias.  Cardiac devices including defibrillators and pacemakers will be interrogated at baseline and 
at [ADDRESS_392992] atrial and ventricular arrhythmia burdens, percentage of atrial and 
ventricular pacing, and any device malfunction. Operators blinded to treatment assignment will interpret 
the ECG Holter. 
 
8.1.4      [Cardiac Magnetic Resonance – part of Imaging Substudy @VCU]  
  
[Cardiac magnetic resonance will be performed within 30 days of randomization and after 28 14 days of 
randomization visit. Cardiac function (left ventricular volumes, mass, and strain) will be assessed with a 
steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine stack in the short axis plane covering the heart from base to apex. 
Orthogonal long axis SSFP cines will be acquired to quantify long axis strain and 3D circumferential strain 
obtained with the short axis images. Tissue characterization of scar and inflammation will also be included 
in the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging protocol. Prior to contrast, short axis slices of the left ventricle 
(basal, mid-cavity, api[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) will be acquired to produce native T1 and T2 maps. Following gadolinium 
contrast administration, post-contrast T1 maps will be repeated and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) 
images will be acquired in short axis slices covering the heart. When necessary, a wideband LGE acquisition 
will be used to improve image quality and reduce artifacts associated with implanted cardiac devices. All 
images will be acquired on a 1.5T Siemens Aera scanner and images will be post-processed using Circle CVI 
[ADDRESS_392993] radiograph may be necessary to determine the presence of 
fractured or retained device leads. Operators blinded to treatment assignment will interpret the ECG

8.[ADDRESS_392994] clinical care. The risk reduction strategies are presented herein. The 
risk/benefit ratio is discussed considering the potential beneficial effects of IL-[ADDRESS_392995]-segment elevation acute 
myocardial infarction, and chronic systolic heart failure. The use of anakinra as an anti-inflammatory 
Interleukin-1 blockade in cardiac sarcoidosis Version 3.001
Protocol MAGiC ART 31 AUG 2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017-04-07 31treatment for cardiac sarcoidosis is justified by [CONTACT_319112]’s relatively low risk/benefit ratio. Anakinra has 
been used in more than 150,000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis with a favorable risk profile.16 
  
Anakinra is given as a subcutaneous injection of 100 mg (0.67 mL) daily or every other day in patients with 
severe impairment in renal function. There is no loading dose and no dose-adjustments needed with age, 
weight, or liver failure. Drug-to-drug interactions have not been reported. There are no known toxic 
effects of anakinra in pregnancy (category B), however pregnant women will be excluded from this 
research study. In a study following patients with rheumatoid arthritis for up to [ADDRESS_392996] likely side effects associated with the use of anakinra include: 
 Injection site reaction (>10%, up to 50%, but infrequently leading to interruption of treatment <5%) 
 Serious Infection (1.8% in anakinra vs 0.6% in placebo in clinical trial of rheumatoid arthritis); 
 Headache, generally mild and self-limiting (1-10%); 
 Diarrhea, generally mild and self-limiting (1-10%); 
 Nausea, generally mild and self-limiting (1-10%); 
 Hypersensitivity reaction (rash, anaphylaxis, arthritis)(rare, 1-2%). 
 Neutropenia (rare, <1%, reversible). 
  
The injection site reactions are by [CONTACT_319113].17 The reactions present as 
painful irritation/redness at the site of injection usually occurring 1-2 weeks after start of treatment. They 
are responsive to topi[INVESTIGATOR_109948]/or antihistamine therapy. The reactions are common (up to 50%) 
but rarely cause of discontinuation of therapy (<5%). 
  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_319097], such events are rather rare (<2% during 
chronic treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis already on other immunomodulating drugs 
[observational data]). Anakinra is indeed not associated with an increase in infection-related mortality, 
nor associated with opportunistic infection. In clinical trials with anakinra, the infection rates did not differ 
between active treatment and placebo. Anakinra may, however, mask some of the signs of infection such 
as fever and leukocytosis, and therefore education on the need to be aware of risk of infection is 
warranted. Nevertheless, when given to patients with sepsis in the setting of a clinical trial, anakinra had 
no negative effect on survival. While anakinra is postulated to prevent inflammatory-based 
hypercoagulability, anakinra has not been associated with any appreciable bleeding risk in pre-clinical, 
clinical, or post-marketing surveillance (including animal studies at >100X the clinically relevant dose). 
  
  
8.2.2       Risks reduction strategies for Anakinra treatment  
Interleukin-1 blockade in cardiac sarcoidosis Version 3.001
Protocol MAGiC ART 31 AUG 2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017-04-07 32  
The risks associated with anakinra appear to be mostly related to risk of infection (1.8% vs 0.6% of serious 
infections in a rheumatoid arthritis study18), and injection site reactions. To better estimate the risk, one 
needs to place the estimates in context: the estimated 2% risk of serious infection with anakinra quoted 
in the FDA approved package insert refers to the use of anakinra/Kineret as second line agent for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, in which anakinra was used in addition to corticosteroids or other 
disease-modifying agents further increasing infectious risk. The risk of infection of anakinra monotherapy 
is not known, but it does not appear to be high. In a study cohort of patients with Neonatal Onset 
Multisystem Inflammatory Disease, another autoinflammatory condition for which anakinra is indicated, 
no dose limiting toxicities were reported for anakinra over the 148.1 patient-year study period: there were 
only 3 serious infections reported (2 wound infections and 1 gastroenteritis) and in all 3 cases, treatment 
with anakinra was considered possibly related to the event, however treatment was not discontinued and 
patients improved with antibiotics. Moreover, if one considers the ‘excess risk’ of serious infection with 
anakinra to evenly distributed through the year, a treatment of 1 month, would lead to an excess risk that 
is less than then 1.2% difference reported in the prescribing information. Nevertheless, the inherent anti-
inflammatory activity of anakinra may potentially mask some of the signs of infection such as fever and 
leukocytosis. In the CANTOS trial, canakinumab, another IL-1 blocker was associated with a 0.1% excess 
risk of life-threatening infection per year compared with placebo – canakinumab, at difference with 
anakinra, is long-acting and it cannot be stopped in case of infection, and therefore one would consider 
the risk of life-threatening infections with anakinra given for 1 month to be 10-fold lower than 
canakinumab for 1 year. 
  
To reduce the risk of infections with anakinra we plan to follow the following strategies: 
 Exclude patients with acute or chronic infections at time of screening; 
 Exclude patients on TNF-alpha blockers; 
 Exclude patients who are neutropenic; 
 Educate patients on the possibility that symptoms or signs of infections may be less evident with taking the 
investigational drug; 
 Provide patient with 24/[ADDRESS_392997] clinical trial with 
anakinra in acute STEMI in 2008 including now over 200 patients. 
  
8.2.3      Testing Risks and Risk Reduction Strategies  
  
There is a social/psychological risk in this study of breaching confidentiality and having a patient’s 
diagnosis discovered. The likelihood of this occurring, however, is very low, and will be further lowered 
by [CONTACT_40397] a secure database that does not link patient identity with clinical data. Loss of confidentiality 
is also a potential risk. However, except when required by [CONTACT_2371], patients will not be identified by [CONTACT_2300], 
Interleukin-1 blockade in cardiac sarcoidosis Version 3.001
Protocol MAGiC ART 31 AUG 2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_392998] some aspects of the patients’ social lives. 
  
All study procedures will be performed in standard clinical settings with established protections for 
patient privacy. To protect patient confidentiality, all records will be stored in a locked office and/or 
password protected encrypted files. All patient identifiers will be removed in any presentations or 
publications. 
  
Vulnerable populations (i.e. prisoners, children) will not be eligible for participation. We will not include 
pregnant women. 
Considering the small size and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_31093], the uncertainties of the benefit, and the 
potential challenges of communication regarding side effects, we plan to exclude subjects with limited 
English proficiency. 
  
The following risks pertain to the different tests that are being used for monitoring the treatment 
responses: 
  
 Blood draw: minor bleeding (rare) and infection (extremely rare) at puncture site. 
 Clinical assessment: no greater than minimal risk.  
 Quality of life assessment: no greater than minimal risk. 
 Adverse event assessment: no greater than minimal risk 
  
While the results of the FDG-PET are used to determine inclusion criteria, FDG-PET is considered standard 
of care and only one test will be necessary for the study and not be performed for study purposes alone. 
 
The ECG Holter monitoring has very little risk. The use of electrodes on the skin placed for 24 –or [ADDRESS_392999].   
 
The risks described below apply to the imaging substudy being completed at VCU alone:  
The risks associated with undergoing cardiac magnetic resonance include:  
During the CMR, the patient may feel mild vibrations throughout the body. The machine will produce a 
loud knocking noise.  The participant will be given earplugs to protect the ears. Some people, especially 
those who tend to feel uncomfortable in small or closed spaced, may feel “closed in” and become anxious 
Interleukin-1 blockade in cardiac sarcoidosis Version 3.001
Protocol MAGiC ART 31 AUG 2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017-04-07 34while in the scanner. The CMR will require a catheter to be inserted into one of the participant's veins in 
order to inject the CMR contrast agent. This may cause skin irritation, bleeding, and/or infection. The 
participant may have an allergic reaction to the contrast agent.  
 
Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a 
progressive fibrosis disease of the skin and internal organs, among patients with impaired elimination of 
the drugs. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease 
(GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) as well as patients with acute kidney injury – patients with chronic moderate-
to-severe kidney disease or acute kidney injury will be excluded from this study.  
 
The magnetic field used in CMR scanning may harm people who have metal in their bodies 
(neurostimulators, certain clips, or staples from surgery). Gadolinium based contrast agents may remain 
in patients’ bodies, including the brain, for months to years after receiving these drugs. Gadolinium 
retention has not been directly linked to adverse health effects in patients with normal kidney function.  
The participant's defibrillator will be FDA approved to undergo CMR and the defibrillator will be turned to 
CMR mode for the CMR. The risks are rare (<1% chance that this will happen) and include:  
 Abnormal fast or slow heart beats caused by [CONTACT_319121].  
 Discomfort due to slight movement or heating of the defibrillator.  
 Fainting or passing out, worsening of heart failure.  
 Mechanical damage to the defibrillator or leads caused by [CONTACT_319121].  
 Irregular defibrillator function caused by [CONTACT_319121].  
 Interruption of normal pacing or pacing too fast caused by [CONTACT_319121].  
 Device pacing irregularly or not continuously.  
 Device not able to shock the heart.  
 Increased pacing electricity needed to make the heart beat.  
 Movement of the defibrillator or leads.  
 Difficulty with the defibrillator being able to see your normal heart beat.  
 Symptoms from the defibrillator making your heart beat at a slightly faster and fixed rate on purpose during 
the CMR.  
 Death. 
 For some devices, coming into contact [CONTACT_319122] a CMR scanner will likely damage 
the Beeper function on the defibrillator such that it may no longer be heard (Likely, > 50% chance that this 
will happen).  
Interleukin-1 blockade in cardiac sarcoidosis Version 3.001
Protocol MAGiC ART 31 AUG 2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017-04-07 35 The heart doctor can explain the potential risks of loss of beeper function. For example: The device will no 
longer beep when the battery is low and it is time to replace. However, the heart doctor will be able to check 
the battery status with a programmer at every clinic visit to make sure the device is replaced before the 
battery runs out - or - The device will no longer beep for certain patient conditions or device malfunctions. 
However, the physician can use a programmer to identify and react to these situations. Home monitoring 
systems will also identify such conditions and alert the heart doctor.  
 There is a risk that the CMR will detect an unrelated health problem that may need to be evaluated and 
treated. 
In selected patients, there may be a need for a chest radiograph to exclude the presence of retained or 
fractured device leads.  A chest radiograph exposes the patient to a very low dose of radiation, a negligible 
increased risk to health.  
 
8.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
8.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE) 
  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention-related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)). 
8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) 
  
An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
  
8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT 
[IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT 
  
For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will 
be used to describe severity. 
  
Interleukin-1 blockade in cardiac sarcoidosis Version 3.001
Protocol MAGiC ART 31 AUG 2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017-04-07 36Grading: 
 Mild: events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the daily activities . 
 Moderate:  events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning and may require local or systemic drug 
therapy. 
 Severe: events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and will likely require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment. Severe events are often incapacitating . 
 Serious or life threatening:  any adverse drug experience that places the patient or subject, in the view of 
the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred (it does not include a reaction 
that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death), or results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or 
prolongation of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), disability or permanent damage, need of a surgical intervention or 
device implantation to prevent disability, or death. 
[IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION 
  
All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_21217]/her clinical judgment. The 
degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study 
product must always be suspect. 
  
Definitely related:  The event is temporally related to the administration of the study intervention and, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], no other etiology explains the event. 
  
Probably related:  The event is temporally related to the administration of the study intervention and 
represents, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the most plausible explanation of the event. 
  
Possibly related:  The event is temporally related to the administration of the study intervention but, in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], it does not represent the most likely explanation of the event. 
  
Definitely Unrelated:  The event is temporally independent of study intervention and/or the event 
appears, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], to be explained by [CONTACT_11693]. 
  
[IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS 
  
[CONTACT_319130] and/or [CONTACT_319131] will be responsible for the initial determination whether an 
adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, 
severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the 
study intervention. 
Interleukin-1 blockade in cardiac sarcoidosis Version 3.001
Protocol MAGiC ART 31 AUG 2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017-04-07 378.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP 
  
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor. 
  
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, 
clinician's assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_10263] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring 
while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to 
adequate resolution. 
  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant's condition deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. 
  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
  
[CONTACT_319130] and/or [CONTACT_319131] will record all reportable events with start dates occurring 
any time after informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the 
last day of study participation.  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of 
AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or 
stabilization. 
8.3.[ADDRESS_393000] their severity and relationship to study intervention assessed as soon as 
possible (possibly within 24 hours and always within 7 days). 
  
All AE reporting not meeting requirements for required immediate SAE reporting, as described below, will 
be reported in aggregate  to the DSMB and NCATS every 6 months and to the IRB every 12 months. 
  
8.3.6 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
  
The MAGiC ART is an investigator-initiated study in which, for the purpose of the FDA, the investigator is 
also the sponsor. 
The study is conducted under 21 CFR 312.2(b) regulation for IND exemption (as indicated by [CONTACT_094]-IND 
inquiry [ADDRESS_393001]. Abbate) 
Interleukin-1 blockade in cardiac sarcoidosis Version 3.001
Protocol MAGiC ART 31 AUG 2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017-04-07 38  
All co-investigators will be instructed to immediately report to the PI (functioning as PI/Sponsor) of any 
serious adverse event , whether or not considered study intervention related, including those listed in the 
protocol or investigator brochure and must include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study intervention caused the event. 
  
The PI/Sponsor is responsible to determine if the criteria for reporting to the DSMB/NCATS/FDA are met. 
The PI/Sponsor is also responsible for following all serious adverse events (SAEs) until satisfactory 
resolution or until the site investigator deems the event to be chronic or the participant is stable.  
  
The PI/Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the DSMB, NCATS, IRB and the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction  as soon as 
possible, but  in no case later than 7 calendar days . 
  
The PI/Sponsor must report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected.  
The sponsor must report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event, examples are: (A) A single 
occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., 
angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); (B) One or more occurrences of an event that is 
not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to 
the drug (e.g., tendon rupture); (C) An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such 
as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that 
commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur 
more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group.”

8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS 
8.4.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks  to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria: 
  
 Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described 
in the protocol-related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved research protocol 
and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied; 
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_226592]); and 
 Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. 
8.4.2  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING 
  
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing IRB and the DSMB. 
  
The UP report will include the following information: 
 A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome; 
 An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an 
UP; 
 A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are 
proposed in response to the UP. 
  
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:  
  
 UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the DSMB within 5 days of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event. 
 Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the DMSB  within 5 days of the investigator becoming aware 
of the problem.

9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES 
 Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s): 
Interval change in CRP levels from baseline to [ADDRESS_393003] values in the normal range (<2 mg/l). 
Hs-CRP will be measured at randomization visit and again at 28±[ADDRESS_393004] of care only group. 
  
 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s): 
Interval change in IL-6 levels from baseline to 28 days  
  
We hypothesize that anakinra will reduce systemic inflammation as shown by [CONTACT_8668]-6 levels. IL-6 will be 
measured with a widely available ELISA assay . IL-6 will be measured at randomization visit and again at 
28±3 days. We will use ANOVA for repeated measures and assess time_x_group interaction to determine 
differences between changes in anakinra group versus control group. 
  
Interval change in QoL scores at SAT  
  
We hypothesize that anakinra will improve QoL scores on SAT questionnaires. QoL SAT will be measured 
at enrollment and again at 28±3 days. We will use ANOVA for repeated measures and assess time_x_group 
interaction to determine differences between changes in anakinra group versus control group

9.[ADDRESS_393005] year: we identified 30 subjects with sarcoidosis who had CRP 3-20 
mg/L (we excluded patients with CRP>20 mg/L as they may have had concomitant bacterial infection, and 
therefore could be excluded upon screening). The mean age was 55 years (range 37-82), 55% were men, 
and 77% were African American. The CRP was 7.64 ±3.74 mg/L (mean±standard deviation). We predict a 
reduction of CRP by >60% in the anakinra group and no change in standard of care only group. The Table 
below shows estimated power for CRP reduction between 50% and 75% in the active treatment group (on 
top of standard of care changes, which are expected to be close to 0), and we evaluated [ADDRESS_393006] deviation (SD) values starting with 3.74 mg/l which was obtained from our VCU cohort and 
exploring 0.9x and 1.1x SD. 
 
 
 
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES 
We plan to compare the 2 groups (anakinra and control) in an intention-to-treat analysis by [CONTACT_319124] (1) met all inclusion/exclusion criteria and (2) were randomly assigned to one of the 2 groups 
were considered as ‘treated’ independent of whether the patients assigned to anakinra received all or 
some or any of the investigational treatment after randomization has been completed and treatment 
assigned. For exploratory purposes we will also perform a per-protocol analysis in which the individual 
subjects not only will need to meet conditions (1) and (2) but also (3) need to have reported compliance 
with >75% of investigational drug prescribed.

Protocol MAGiC ART 31 AUG 2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017-04-07 439.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
9.4.1 GENERAL APPROACH 
  
We will compare the change using an ANOVA for repeated measures in which we assess for the 
significance of the interaction of treatment allocation and time interval (time_x_group interaction) using 
SPSS 25.0 (Chicago, IL).  Additional exploratory endpoints will include absolute CRP values at 28 days, and 
the percentage of patients with CRP <2 mg/L at each time point. The interval change in CRP levels from 
baseline to 28 days will be expressed as median and interquartile range. All reporting will be in conjunction 
with the CONSORT statement.19  
9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S) 
  
We therefore hypothesize that anakinra will reduce systemic inflammation as shown by [CONTACT_319125]. CRP will be 
measured with a widely available high-sensitivity assay able to detect values in the normal range (<2 mg/l). 
CRP will be measured at enrollment and again at 28±3 days. 
  
Interval change in CRP levels from baseline to 28 days will represent the primary endpoint . 
9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S) 
  
We will measure changes in IL-6, an additional inflammatory biomarker as a secondary endpoint. Changes 
in QoL scores will also be considered a secondary endpoint. 
  
Additional secondary endpoints to be completed as part of the imaging substudy at VCU includes 
assessment of myocardial edema with T2 mappi[INVESTIGATOR_319107], and myocardial inflammation with cardiac 
FDG-PET. 
9.4.4 SAFETY ANALYSES 
  
The DSMB will monitor the progress of the present trial. The DSMB will meet regularly to review safety 
data every 6 months or sooner in case of a serious unexpected adverse event that is considered to be 
possibly, probably or definitely related to the research. All meetings, and specifically any action taken by 
[CONTACT_319126], will be recorded. These documents will include any data 
summaries or analyses provided to the DSMB and will remain confidential until the study is concluded. 
No interim efficacy analyses are planned. 
  
Interim safety analyses will, however, be performed at each meeting. The DSMB will be provided with 
data related to adverse events. The DSMB may choose to stop enrollment on the basis of safety data 
observed. If safety concerns are found, further enrollment will not be allowed until issues are resolved. If 
no safety concerns are found, enrollment will continue until the target sample size is reached. The 
following pre-specified halting rules are provided to the DSMB as guidance.

10.1 REGULATORY, ETHICAL, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS 
10.1.1 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS 
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS 
Informed Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks are 
given to the participant and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting 
intervention/administering study intervention.  The IRB-approved informed consent form is attached to 
this protocol as Appendix. 
  
Potential participants will be approached by [CONTACT_319127]-of-care visits in the 
VCUHealth or UMich Sarcoidosis Clinic in private patient rooms. The investigator will review the consent 
form with the patients and invite them ask any questions about the study. All potential participants will 
be allowed to take the consent form home to review with friends/family or other health care providers. 
Once the potential participants have had all of their questions answered, they will be invited to sign the 
consent form. 
  
Participants will not be coerced into participation. They will be advised that their refusal to participate 
will not affect their standard of care. All potential participants will be allowed to take the consent form 
home to review with friends/family or other health care providers. Participants will have as much time 
as needed to decide to participate or not. These are existing sarcoidosis patients that are regularly seen 
in the VCUHealth or UMich Sarcoidosis clinic. 
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual's agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout the individual's study participation. Consent forms will be Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)-approved and the participant will be asked to read and review the document. The 
investigator will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. 
A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the participant's comprehension of the 
purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research 
participants.  Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask 
questions prior to signing. The participants should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their 
family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participant will sign the 
informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study. Participants 
must be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any 
time, without prejudice. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the participants for 
their records. The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in the source document 
(including the date), and the form signed, before the participant undergoes any study-specific

10.1.2 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE 
 
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable 
cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be 
provided by [CONTACT_21224], investigators, and funding

10.1.7 CLINICAL MONITORING 
  
  
The DSMB will monitor the progress of the present trial. The DSMB will meet regularly to review safety 
data every 6 months or sooner in case of a serious unexpected adverse event that is considered to be 
possibly, probably or definitely related to the research. 
  
All meetings, and specifically any action taken by [CONTACT_319126], will be 
recorded. These documents will include any data summaries or analyses provided to the DSMB and will 
remain confidential until the study is concluded. No interim efficacy analyses are planned. 
  
Interim safety analyses will, however, be performed at each meeting. The DSMB will be provided with 
data related to adverse events. The DSMB may choose to stop enrollment on the basis of safety data 
observed. If safety concerns are found, further enrollment will not be allowed until issues are resolved. 
Interleukin-1 blockade in cardiac sarcoidosis Version 3.001
Protocol MAGiC ART 31 AUG 2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017-04-07 50If no safety concerns are found, enrollment will continue until the target sample size is reached. The 
following pre-specified halting rules are provided to the DSMB as guidance. 
  
Halting rules  
  
The study will be temporarily suspended if any of the following conditions are met: 
 Any serious adverse event that probably or definitely related to the investigational product ; 
 The number of subjects experiencing a serious adverse event considered unrelated or only possibly related  
to the investigational product exceeds 50% (after the first 3 or more subjects are enrolled); 
 The number of subjects experiencing either a serious adverse event considered unrelated or only possibly 
related to the investigational product or a non-serious adverse event of at least moderate intensity that is 
probably or definitely related  to the investigational product exceeds 75%. 
  
If any of these conditions are met, the enrollment is halted until the DSMB is given the opportunity to 
review the data and consider the request for unblinding. After the assessment of the DSMB, a discussion 
with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_75534] (NCATS) should be held prior to the final decision to resume or permanently 
stop the study. 
  
Example of data provided to the DSMB: 
 [____] of subjects with serious AE considered probably or definitely related à if >0 --> halting rule 
 [____] of subjects with serious AE considered unrelated or only possibly related à if >50% --> halting rule 
 [____] of subjects with serious AE unrelated or only possibly related + [_____] number of subjects with 
non-serious AE of at least moderate intensity probably or definitely related à if >75% --> halting rule

[IP_ADDRESS] DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES 
  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site 
investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of the data reported. 
  
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation 
of data.  
  
Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_21193].  Data recorded in the electronic case report 
form (eCRF) derived from source documents should be consistent with the data recorded on the source 
documents. 
  
Clinical data (including AEs, concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data) and clinical 
laboratory data will be entered into OnCore, a 21 CFR Part 11-compliant data capture system provided 
by [CONTACT_941] [specify DCC]. The data system includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as 
automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical 
data will be entered directly from the source documents. 
[IP_ADDRESS] STUDY RECORDS RETENTION 
  
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_393015] approval of a marketing 
application in an International Conference on Harminosation (ICH) region and until there are no pending 
or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least [ADDRESS_393016] elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study intervention. These documents should be 
retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_427]. No records will be destroyed 
without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform 
the investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
10.1.10 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS 
  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), or MOP requirements. The noncompliance may be either 
on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective 
actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483]. 
  
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP: 
 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 
Interleukin-1 blockade in cardiac sarcoidosis Version 3.001

 5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2. 
  
It is the responsibility of the site investigator to use continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations 
within [specify number] working days of identification of the protocol deviation, or within [specify 
number] working days of the scheduled protocol-required activity.  All deviations must be addressed in 
study source documents, reported to NCATS Program Official and Virginia Commonwealth 
University.  Protocol deviations must be sent to the reviewing IRB per their policies. The site investigator 
is responsible for knowing and adhering to the reviewing IRB requirements. Further details about the 
handling of protocol deviations will be included in the MOP.

1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Title:  A Phase 1 Dose Escalation Trial Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetic 
Profile of BIO 300 Oral Powder in Healthy Volunteers   
Study Description : Single Ascending Dose:  
Open -label, single -dose escalation in healthy volunteers.  Each cohort will 
enroll 8 subjects of which 2 will be  backups  (1M/1F) , so that  at least 6 
subjects (3M/3F) complet e the protocol procedures. The pertinent safety 
data will be reviewed for each cohort before the next dose level cohort is started.  Subjects will follow a diet low in soy isoflavones for [ADDRESS_793269] ein. Subsequent doses will be 2x 
the previous cohort. The fourth, and final cohort, dose level will be TBD 
based on the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) results from the previous 3 cohorts.  Subjects will remain in the clinic 12 h ours  after dosing for 
observatio ns and blood sample collection for clinical lab assessment, PK, 
and pharmacodynamics (PD).  Subjects will remain fasted for [ADDRESS_793270] article administration. Subjects will be provided a standardized low soy meal after the 4 -hour blood draw and  after the 8- hour blood 
draw.  Subjects will return to the clinic on day 2, 3 and 8 after dosing for 
blood sampling and/or observations as detailed in the schedule of events. 
Subjects may not miss any clinic visits. At the conclusion of the study, data 
will be analyzed from all cohorts to determine safety and PK.  PD samples will be stored until the completion of all p hase 1 studies, and then sent for 
RNA sequencing and data analysis.

(ERβ ). ERβ activation promotes DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and importantly, anti- inflammatory 
effects. This pleiotropic mechanism can partly be explain ed by [CONTACT_89482]β’s ability to repress expression  and 
activation  of nuclear factor kappa light -chain -enhancer of activated B cells (NF -κB), which is a master 
regulator that controls transcription of genes involv ed in the immune response and cell survival 1-3. NF-
κB is activated in response to radiation, infection or other immune stimuli, and in turn promotes 
expr ession of pro -inflammatory cytokines [reviewed in  4]. 
Humanetics is developi[INVESTIGATOR_599345] 300 for multiple clinical indication s related to DNA damage and 
inflammation.  The primary indication for BIO 300 Oral Powder is as a prophylactic medical 
countermeasure to increase survival in individuals exposed to myelosuppressive doses of ionizing radiation.  
BIO 300 has been studied in a previous clinical trial (NCT 02567799 ) as an aqueous oral nanosuspension  
(BIO 300 Oral Suspension) .  BIO 300 Oral Powder has been developed to facilitate a solid dosage form of 
BIO 300.  The pharmacokinetics of  BIO 300 Oral Powder are not fully known in humans, and the safety 
and maximum tolerated d ose of this formulation is unk nown .  This phase 1 study is intended to 
methodically explore both safety and PK of this formulation in healthy human volunteers.  In addition, 
blood -based  biomarkers will be examined as part of an effort to develop a human do se conversion 
strategy under the FDA Animal Rule. 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for more detail.

7.2 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
Discontinuation from BIO 300 Oral Powder  does not mean discontinuation from the study, and the 
remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].  If a clinically 
significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline) after en rollment, the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_599350]. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an adverse event (AE).  
7.3 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE S TUD Y 
Subjects  are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_599351] a subject from  the study for the following reasons : 
•Pregnancy  (see Section 8.4.8 ). Women of childbearing potential must perform a pregnancy test
in case of delayed menstruation and stop treatment immediately in case of positive result.
•Significant study intervention non -compliance .
•Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness that, in the
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1237], indicates that  continued participation in the study is  not in
the best interest of the participant .
•If the participant  meets  an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously
recognized) that precludes further study participation .
•If the participant w ithdraw s their  informed consent .
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be r ecorded on the Case 
Report Form ( CRF). Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive 
the study intervention may be replaced.   
7.[ADDRESS_793307] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
•The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_599366]/or should continue in the
study.
•If the missed visit consists of timed blood draws for PK  and PD , that subject will be immediately
cons idered lost to follow up and may be replaced.
•Should the subject  be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn from the
study with a primary reason o f lost to follow -up.
Phase [ADDRESS_793308] 6 (3M/3F) subjects/cohort will 
complete all aspects of the study.  For the Multiple Single Dose study at least 8 (4M/4F) subjects will 
complete all as pects of the study.  
7.5 DOSE ESCALATION CRITERIA  
A Safety M o
nitoring Committee (SMC) consisting of a Humanetics representative, the Medical Monitor 
and Principal Investigator, or their recognized delegates will review all available data. The determination 
for escalation to the next Cohort will require, at a minimum, a review of all safety data of [ADDRESS_793309] Day 3.   Decisions to proceed with dose escalations, adding 
additional subjects to the current Cohort, and possible dose adjustments will be made following this review with the Medical Monitor and Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_599352].  Whether 
additional information such as PK or PD data may be needed before a decision to escalate can also be determined by [CONTACT_4484]. The primary responsibility of the SMC is to regularly monitor the overall safety 
of patients enrolled in the study, while protecting the scientific integrity of the study data.  Dose 
escalation  criteria will be the following:
 
•Dose esc
alation may occur if no more than [ADDRESS_793310] cohort experiences a dose -limiting
toxicity (DLT, as defined below).
•If 3 DLTs occur (3/ 6 subjects), an additional 2 subjects will be treated with the same dose.
•If no additional DLTs occur (3/ 8 subjects), dose escalation may proceed.
•The study sponsor will temporarily cease enrollment for evaluation if in any given cohort 4/ 8 subjects
exper ience DLTs attributable to BIO 300 Oral Powder as the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) will have
been exceeded and no further dose escalation will occur.
DLT is any grade 3 or grade 4 adverse event listed in the draft FDA document entitled “ Toxicity Grading 
Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials .” 
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
8.1 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION  
Safety:  
The safety profile of BIO 300 Oral Powder will be based on the results of CBC with differential, coagulation 
parameters, serum chemistries, urinalysis, ECGs, and vital signs the reporting of adverse events.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood samples will be collected at multiple timepoints after BIO 300 Oral Powder administration and processed for serum isolation. Serum concentrations of genistein aglycone will be measured from PK parameters (C
max, T max, clearance, AUC (0-24;0- 48;0- INF), volume of distribution, T 1/2 and drug accumulation 
index) which will be calculated using standard procedures and statistical analyses.  
Pharmacodynamics:  
Blood samples will be collected at multiple timepoints in PAXgene tubes after BIO [ADDRESS_793311] ed to RNA sequencing to explore biomarkers which may be predictive of 
BIO 300 Oral Powder effectiveness.

21 Physical Exam  – Exam ination of  the participant’s  cardiovascular, HEENT, lymphatic , pulmonary , 
gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal,  and neurological systems.  
Vital Signs  – Vital signs will record the patient’s height, weight and BMI. They will also measure heart 
rate, blood pressure  (systolic and diastolic), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and  body temperature . 
Electrocardiogram  – ECGs occur  during the screening visit , on visit 2 (1 hr before, 1hr after, 2 hrs after 
and 4 hrs after BIO 300 Oral Powder dose), and visits 3 -5 for the SAD phase . ECGs will occur during the 
screening visit, visit 2 (1 hr before, 1hr after, 2 hrs after and 4 hrs after BIO 300 Oral Powder dose) , visits 
3-4, visit [ADDRESS_793312]
has an abnormal reading.
QTc Interval Prolongation  – Fridericia- corrected QTc (QT cF) interval from all subject s in both the SAD 
and the multiple single dose studies  will be used to evaluate QTc F interval prolongation. QTcF 
prolongation will be determined by [CONTACT_599367] (pre -dose) and at multiple time points 
around the predicted C max of BIO 300 Oral Powder ( ECG timepoints listed above ). QTcF intervals will be 
reported for each dosing cohort as a mean and standard deviation. The upper limit for QTc F interval 
prolongation will be >480 ms or absolute QTc F change from baseline of >30 ms with a 95% confidence 
interval. The relationship between drug exposure and mean QTc F interval change will be evaluated in 
the SAD study using both C max and AUC. Any adverse events that may signal a potential proarrhythmic 
effect will be carefully monitored (e.g., Torsade de pointes, sudden death, ventricular tachycardia, 
seizures, etc.). 
Complete Blood Count  – Blood sampling for the laboratory parameters will be performed during the 
screening and BIO 300 Oral Powder treatment period according to the study schedule ( Section 1.3). A 
complete blood count with differential will evaluate  hemoglobin, hematocrit, re d blood cells (RBCs), 
white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and platelet 
count . 
Serum Chemistry  and Fasting Lipid Panel  – Blood serum will be used to evaluate the blood chemistry 
parameters . Serum chemistries to include total protein, albumin, sodium, potassium, chloride, 
bicarbonate, glucose, BUN, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, uric acid, LDH, total and direct 
bilirubin, phosphorous, calcium, magnesium, amylase, lipase, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL. Subjects will fast at least 8 h prior to blood collection for serum chemistries . 
PTT/INR  – Prothrombin Time (PTT)  is a test that evaluates a subject’s  ability to appropriately form blood 
clots.  The International Normalized Ratio (INR) is a calculation based on results of the PTT that is used to 
monitor individuals who are being treated with the blood -thinning medication . 
Pregnancy Test  – Tests will occur at screening, day 1 and during the final visit  (SAD, day 8, visit 5; 
Multiple Single Dose, day 13, visit 10) . Tests will use urine or serum for determination of β-HCG.  
Viral Testing  – Test will occur at screening for both studies. Tests will utilize blood  for analysis of the 
Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody , and HIV1 and HIV2 antibody.  
Urinalysis  – To include pH, specific gravity, dipstick determinations of protein, glucose, ketones and 
bilirubin , blood  and reflex microscopic exam (reflex only if any qualitative measurements or appearance  
return abnormal)  
Concomitant Medications  – A record of c oncomitant medications will be collected for all subjects from 
the screening visit through BIO 300  Oral Powder treatment and the one-week follow-up phase.

146.3 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related. Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product (attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite) (ICH, E2A, 
E6). 
18.4.2 DEFINITION OF SER1ous ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) 
SAEs that fit any one of the criteria in the SAE definition below must be reported to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of awareness of the event. 
An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_27362], it results in any of the following outcomes: 
•Death;
•A life-threatening adverse event;
•Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
•A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal
life functions;
•A congenita l anomaly/birth defect.
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopard ize the 
participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. 
18.4.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT 
[IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT 
For adverse events (AEs), guidelines based on the FDA Guidance for Industry Toxicity Grading Scale for 
Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials will be used to 
describe severity. The guidance provides a toxicity grading scale (grade 1, mild; grade 2, moderate; 
grade 3, severe; grade 4, potentially life threatening) for clinical and laboratory abnormalities. For AE 
25 
Phase 1 BIO 300 Oral Powder  Version 3.0 
Protocol CL0106-01 07 June 2021  
26 terminology, the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be used , 
and AE system organ classification will follow the Medical Dictatory for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_237357]/her clinical judgment.  
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. 
•Definite  – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test
result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention  administration and cannot be
explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The event must bepharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive.
•Probabl e – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors
is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within areasonable time after  administration of the study intervention , is unlikely to be attributed to
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and f ollows a clinically reasonable response on
withdrawal.
•Possibl e – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred
within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention ). However, other factors
may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant ’s clinical conditi on, other concomitant
events). Although an AE  may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be
flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitelyrelated”, as appropriate.
•Unlikely – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal
relationship to study intervention  administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g.,
the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention )
and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations(e.g., the participant ’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).
•Unrelated  – The AE is completely independent of study  intervention  administratio n, and/or
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology.
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_21190] ( AE) is expected 
or unexpected.  An AE  will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is 
not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention .  The final 
determination of expectedness will be determined by [CONTACT_137984] r in consultation with the 
Principal Investigator. 
8.4.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE ) or serious adverse event (SAE ) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and inte rviews of a study participant  presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAE s will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_599368] 1 BIO 300 Oral Powder  Version 3.0 
Protocol CL0106-01 07 June 2021  
27 training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant  is screened , or after they are  
screened, but before they are administered the first dose of study drug,  will be considered as baseline 
and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition  deteriorates at any time during 
the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Chan ges in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity  to be performed. A Es characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
Delegated study personnel  will record AE s with start dates occurring any time after the first dose of 
study intervention  is administered  through the end of the study . SAEs will be recorded with start dates 
occurring any time after informed consent is obtained through the end of the study. At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed 
for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  Documentation of the serious event will be 
reported  on the Serious Adverse Event CRF and submitted to the Sponsor  within 24 hours of awareness.  
8.4.5  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
The notification process to the study Sponsor  of all safety data begins with the completion and 
submission of the appropriate CRFs or in the case of an  initial serious event reporting, by [CONTACT_648]. 
Investigators are required to report promptly to the Sponsor  any adverse events that may reasonably be 
regarded as caused by, or probably caused by, the drug. If the Adverse Event (AE) meets the Serious 
Adverse Event (SAE) criteria, the investigator is required to report the event to the Sponsor  within 24 
hours of awareness.    
8.4.6  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
The Sponsor  will notify the FDA , all participating investigators in a written IND safety report of any 
adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected and any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. The Sponsor  
will submit an IND safety report to the FDA and all participating investigators no later than 15 c alendar 
days after the Sponsor  determines that the suspected adverse reaction or other information qualifies for 
reporting.  Unexpected fatal or life- threatening suspected adverse reactions will be reported to the FDA 
no later than 7 calendar days after the  Sponsor ’s initial receipt of the information. If the FDA requests 
any additional data or information, the Sponsor  will submit it to FDA as soon as  possible, but no  later 
than [ADDRESS_793321] and 
pregnancy will be followed to term.

28 8.5 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
8.5.1  DEFINIT ION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participant s or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  the 
following criteria:  
• U nexpec
ted in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are
described in the protocol -related documents, s uch as the IRB -approved research protocol and
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant  population being
studied;
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a
reasonable p ossibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_572781]); and
• S uggests that the research places participant s or others at a greater risk of harm (including
physical, psychological, economic, or s ocial harm) than was previously known or recognized.
8.5.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_199779] ( UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review 
Board ( IRB) and t o the Sponsor . The UP report will include the following information:  
•Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project
number;
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;
• A n explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome
represents an UP ;
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or
are proposed in response to the UP .
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UP s will be reported using the following timeline:  
• UP s that are serious adverse events ( SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the study Sponso r
in accordance with the sites policies and procedure s and within 24 hours  of the investigator
becoming aware of the event.
•Any other UP  will be reported to the IRB  and to the study Sponsor  within one week  of the
investigator becoming aware of the problem.
All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s
written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for
Human Resear ch Protections ( OHRP ) within 7 business days  of the IRB’s receipt of the report of
the problem from the investigator.
Phase 1 BIO 300 Oral Powder  Version 3.0 
Protocol CL0106-01 07 June 2021  
29 9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
Data analysis of the primary  endpoints will be based on measurements  of genistein aglycone (free 
genistein) serum concentrations (0 -48 h) . They will also be based on safety assessments  which include 
blood counts, serum chemistries, urinalysis, ECGs, vital signs, and PTT/INR at the timepoints listed in the 
SoA, Section 1.3 .  “Baseline” will refer to measurements taken during the screening visit.  If no “baseline” 
data exists from a parameter, then changes in the parameter time regression will be compared.  
As this i s a single dose  escalation  and multiple single dose  trial evaluating the safety and  pharmacokinetic 
profile of BIO [ADDRESS_793322] 4 females 
and 4 males . This is a sufficient number of subjects in each study to characterize the PK and PD of BIO 
300 Oral Powder and  to identify DLTs.   
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR A NALYSES  
All participants will be analyzed. The ITT dataset is the primary dataset for analysis. As a guide, analyses 
may include, but are  not limited to, any or all of the following:  
•Intention -to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Dataset: all participants
•Safety Analysis Dataset : participants who took at least one dose of BIO [ADDRESS_793323] statistical techniques will determine statistically significant 
differences in the trial measurement data . Statistical significance will be set at the nominal level of 
p<0.05. Plasma concentrations (genistein aglycone; free genistein) will be measured (AUC, C max, Tmax, 
T1/2) and plasma kinetic rate will be calculated using standard procedures and statistical analyses (e.g., 
AUC using the linear trapezoidal formula and T 1/2 using linear regression). Data will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_9086] (mean/medians and standard errors/confidence intervals for continuous response variables and distribution tables or histograms for discrete response variables).  
Baseline ch
aracteristics will be compared using matched -pair t -tests. The computed change from 
baseline will be calculated for all measured variables and expressed as the mean change from base line 
Phase [ADDRESS_793324] deviation (SD) of the change from baseline. Repeated measures ANOVA 
tests will be used to compare changes in scores for each variable between each treatment group. Matched pair t -tests will be  used to compare the change scores within each treatment group. All data 
analyses will be conducted on the subjects who completed the study treatment periods and statistical 
significance will be set at p<0.05.  
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
Blood counts, serum chemistry , urinalysis , ECGs, vital signs,  and PTT/INR  for the study cohorts will be 
reported as a mean ± SD at each of the timepoints listed in the SoA, Section 1.3 . An analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) to compare the cohorts  after adjusting for "baseline" (the adjustment covariate) 
will be completed.  Analysis will be performed  in individual  subjects  to identity changes in safety 
measurements relative to baseline, and between cohorts at the timepoints listed in the SoA, Secti on 1.3  
to identify any potential dose -response relationships.   
9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
For the secondary endpoint of RNA sequencing, statistical analysis will be used to detect differential expressed gene s (DEGs) . Analysis will be performed  in individual  subjects  to identity DEGs  relative to 
baseline, and between cohorts at the timepoints listed in the SoA, Section 1.3  to identify dose -response 
relationships.  
RNA samples will be sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq approach that will produce 20 -30 million paired 
end reads per sample. Raw reads will be mapped to the human  genome. Reads will be normalized as 
fragments per kilobase million (FPKM) and used to identify DEGs for biomarker evaluation . 
9.4.4  SAFETY ANALYSES  
All adverse ev ents  (AEs), including clinically  significant laboratory abnormalities , will be collected in the 
site’s source document,  and reported on the AE case report form (CRF). Documentation of the serious 
event will be reported on the Serious Adverse Event (SAE) CRF and submitted to the Sponsor  within 24 
hours of awareness.  
AEs will be identified using the  FDA Guidance for Industry Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and 
Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials. The following information regarding each adverse event will be recorded:  
•Assessment period
•Severity Grade (0 -4)
•Attribution to study agent (relatedness)
•Date AE occurred
•Date AE resolved
•Whether or not the event was reported as an SAE
•Whether or not the participant dropped due to the event
•Action taken with study agent
•Outcome of the event
•Additional investigator c omments
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_599369] . Tables will include summaries of all AEs, 
all SAEs, all BIO [ADDRESS_793325]  age, vital signs, laboratory results, and BMI  will be compared 
between the dosing cohorts  using descriptive statistics. ANOVA analysis will be used to compare each 
parameter between the study  cohorts  at baseline.  
9.4.6  PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES  
Following the 2000 mg single ascending dose cohort, safety and PK analysis will be completed to 
determine the dose for the final cohort of the single ascending dose study.  
9.4.7  SUB -GROUP ANALYSES  
No sub -group analysis is planned.  
9.4.8  TABULATION OF INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT  DATA 
All individual participant data will be listed by [CONTACT_429238] . 
9.4.9  EXPLORATORY ANALYSES  
There are no exploratory analyses planned for this study.  
10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
10.1 REGULATORY, ETHICAL , AND S TUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1.1 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS 
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention , study procedures, and risks are given to the 
participant  and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting 
intervention/administering study intervention.   The informed  consent form (ICF) is  submitted with this 
protocol .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSEN T PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
The environment where the process of consent is conducted will be private, confidential, and safe in order to facilitate a constructive dialogue between the prospective subject and the person(s) involved in obtaining consent.  All prospective subjects must have the cognitive ability to provide legally effective 
informed consent. Individuals who do not have such ability (i.e., decisionally impaired persons) can only 
be enrolled in research through consent of their legally authorized representative (LAR). If there is any 
concern about an individual’s cognitive ability an appropriate assessment should be performed by a qualified individual.  
The informed consent will be presented and discussed with the prospective subject in a seque ntial 
manner utilizing the approved ICF as a guide. The presentation should be structured to facilitate a dialogue with reinforcement and elaboration of important information (e.g., the risks of the research). The person(s) involved in obtaining the subjec t’s consent will constantly evaluate whether the process is 
Phase [ADDRESS_793326]’s signature.  
The informed consent document must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_941] I RB, any changes to the 
informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for approval prior to initiation.   
10.1.2 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause.  Written n otification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be 
provided by [CONTACT_206092],  or terminating party to study participants, Principal I nvestigator, funding 
agency, the Investigational New Drug ( IND) Sponsor  and regulatory authorities.  If the study is 
prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal I nvestigator (PI ) will promptly inform study 
participants, the Instituti onal Review Board ( IRB), and Sponsor  and will provide the reason(s) for the 
termination  or suspension.  Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of 
changes to study visit schedule.  
 Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
•Determination of unexpected, significant, o r unacceptable risk to participants
•Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]
•Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements
•Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable
•Determination that  the primary endpoint has been met
•Dete rmination of futility
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed, 
and satisfy the Sponsor , IRB and/or Food and Drug Administration ( FDA).

 2 1. Introduction 
Protocol Title:  A Phase 1 Dose Escalation Trial Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetic Profile of BIO 
300 Oral Powder in Healthy Volunteers  
Protocol  Number:  CL010 6-01 
 
Investigational  Agent:  BIO 300 Oral Powder  
Phase of Development:  Phase 1 
Sponsor:  Humanetics Corporation  
Design:  Open label, single site phase 1 study in healthy volunteers who are equally distributed by [CONTACT_4321]. The 
study will include a single ascending dose (SAD) study in four cohorts and will be followed by a six -day 
multiple single dose (MSD) study at either the highest dose or the maximum tolerated dose. There are no 
planned stratifications or sub -studies. 
This Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) details the planned methods for summarizing data collected in the 
clinical study conducted under  Humanetics Corporation  protocol CL0106-01. The current study protocol 
is identified as  version 1.0 dated 16-Nov -2020. 
Future protocol amendments (if any) will be reviewed to assess whether the changes necessitate 
modification of this SAP.  
Since the study protocol is a companion document to this SAP, aspects in the protocol unrelated to 
statistical issues (e.g., patient eligibility criteria  and detailed BIO 300 Oral Powder information) are not 
repeated here . 
2. Study Objectives  
2.1. Primary Objectives 
• Determine the overall adverse event and pharmacokinetic ( PK) profiles of single ascending 
doses of BIO 300 Oral Powder in healthy volunteers  
• Determine the overall adverse event and PK profile of multiple doses of BIO 300 Oral Powder in 
healthy volunteers  
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
• Determine the effects of single and multiple doses of BIO 300 Oral Powder on blood -based 
biomarkers  
• Use a combination of the PK and pharmacodynamic ( PD) profiles from the single and multiple 
doses of BIO 300 Oral powder to identify the putative BIO 300 Oral Powder human efficacious 
dose  
3. Study Endpoints  
3.1. Primary Endpoint  
• Evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of BIO 300 Oral Powder in Healthy Volunteers  

CL0106-01  Statistical Analysis Plan  December 28 , 2020 
 
 3 3.2. Secondary Endpoint  
• Characterize the expression of blood-based biomarkers  
4. Sample Size 
• 6 subjects/cohort (3M/3F) will be recruited for the single ascending dose study, and at least 6 
(3M/3F) subjects/cohort will complete all aspects of the study.  2 additio nal subjects (1M/1F), will 
be screened, consented and available as backups for each cohort.  
• 10 (5M/5F) subjects will be recruited for the multiple single dose study, and at least 8 (4M/4F) 
subjects will complete all aspects of the study. 4 additional subjects (2M/2F) will be screened, 
consented and available as backups.  
• In total, at least [ADDRESS_793342] 4 females and 4 males. This is a sufficient 
number of subjects in each study to characterize the PK and PD of BIO 300 Oral Powder and to identify dose limiting toxicities (DLTs ).   
5. Analysis  Populations  
5.1. Intention- to-Treat Analys is Dataset  
The Intention -to-Treat ( ITT) analysis dataset will include all study participants  
5.2. Safety  Analysis Dataset  
All study participants  who receive at least one dose of BIO 300 Oral Powder . This analysis set will be used 
to summarize all safety endpoin ts. 
5.3. Pharmacokinetic (PK) Population 
The PK Population will include all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_793343] 1 of the days of sampling. PK 
summaries will be based on the PK population.  
5.4. Pharmacodynamics (PD) Population  
The PD Population will include all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_793344] 1 of the days of sampling. PD 
summaries will be based on the PD population.  
6. Safety Monitoring Committee  
A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will review safety and PK data  (when available)  during the conduct 
of the study. After each cohort in the SAD study, the SMC will make decisions on  proceeding with dose 
escalation, adding additional subjects to the current c ohort , and  possible dose adjustments . The SMC  may  
also recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098], suspending enrollment or significant changes to the dosing regimen  
and/or enr ollment if warranted by [CONTACT_372004] . The SMC will immediately communicate this 
recommendation to Humanetics for review and determination of a final decision. SMC  data reviews are

 4 not considered interim analyses and do not necessitate adjusting of the alpha  level for multiple statistical 
hypothesis tests. 
7. Statistical Methods  
Unless stated otherwise, the term “descriptive statistics” refers to the number of subjects (n), mean, 
median, standard deviation (STD), minimum (min), and maximum (max) and standard errors/confidence 
intervals for continuous response variables and distribution tables or histograms for discrete response 
variables. Min and max values will be rounded to the precision of the original value, means and medians 
will be rounded to [ADDRESS_793345] whole number (zeros are not displayed) with values of “< 1%” and “ > 99%” shown as 
necessary for values falling near the boundaries.  
The computed change from baseline will be calculated for all measured variables and expressed as the mean change from baseline + STD of the change from baseline. Analysis of covariance will be used to 
compare dosage groups on “change from baseline” measures (with baseline measurement considered as 
an adjustment covariate).   
Unless otherwise note, all data collected during the study will be included in data listings and will be sorted 
by [CONTACT_599375] , subject number and then by [CONTACT_599376].  
7.1. Definitions  
• Baseline is synonymous with screening, and the baseline value  (or baseline result) is that 
measured  during the screening visit prior to the first administration of BIO 300 Oral Powder. 
• Day [ADDRESS_793346] day of dosing with BIO 300 Oral Powder. 
• Estimand is the estimated value for a parameter or, alternatively, a formula and/or description for how a parameter is estimated.  
• Proportional months, defined for durations of time reported  in months, are given by [CONTACT_599377] =12
365.25×days  
• Shift table is a two -way frequency table pairing baseline value with the most extreme post -
baseline result.  
7.2. Missing Values 
Given the small sample size, descriptive statistics and other analyses will be completed without replacing 
or imputing missing values. 
7.3. Visit Windows  
The study protocol defines a visit schedule based on the number of days since the first dose of  BIO 300 
Oral Powder  (Day 1 ). All study participants will be instructed on when they need to return to the clinic in 
order to meet all scheduled assessments. Assessments outside of the scheduled visit  window  will be 
analyzed (by [CONTACT_599378]) as if they occur within the visit window; that is, no 
data will be excluded if it is measured  outside the visit window.  
CL0106-[ADDRESS_793347] SAD  cohort , PK analysis will be completed for all subjects  (cohorts 1 -3) and analyzed 
along with all safety data t o determine the dose for the final cohort of the SAD study. No other interim 
analyses are planned. SMC data reviews are not considered interim analyses (see Section 6 ). 
7.5. Significance level  
An independent statistician using standard statistical techniques will determine statistically significant 
differences in the trial measurement data at the nominal 0.[ADDRESS_793348]  Disposition  
The numbers of subjects  who were enrolled and  dosed with BIO 300 Oral Powder will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_211261]. R easons for discontinu ing BIO 300 Oral Powder and study completion status will be 
summarized as categorical variable s (number and percentage of subjects  in each category). Relevant data 
supporting these summaries will be listed by [CONTACT_1130] . 
8.2. Protocol Deviations  
Study inclusion/exclusion criteria violations and protocol deviations recorded in the clinical database, if any, will be summarized as categorical variables (number and percentage of subjects  in each category). 
Relevant data supporting this summary will be listed by [CONTACT_1130].  
8.3. Baseline and Demographic Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteristic data will be summarized with descriptive statistics for age, 
gender, race, ethnicity, height, weight, BMI, vital signs and laboratory results . ANOVA analysis will be used 
to compare each parameter between the study cohorts at baseline.  
9. Endpoint Analyses  
All observations available in the study database will be included  in endpoint analysis regardless of 
subjects ’ aggregate exposure to BIO [ADDRESS_793349] .  
9.1. Analysis  for Safety Endpoints  
Safety data will include adverse events ( AEs), safety laboratory (CBC/hematology, serum chemistry and 
urinalysis), pregnancy (if applicable), drug and alcohol tests test, physical exam, ECG, and vital signs. The 
proportion of subjects experiencing adverse events, serious adverse events, and DLTs  will be 
summarized for each dosing cohort. See Section 10  for more information on safety analysis.  
9.2. Analysis for the Pharmacokinetic Profile  
PK parameters will be estimated using nominal sampling times relative to each dose administration and 
nominal doses unless otherwise specified. Serum concentration values obtained at the predose time point 
will be used to estimate the concentration at time zero  (baseline) .  Concentration values reported as not 
quantifiable (BLQ, <1.0 ng/mL) will be assigned a value of zero.    
The area under the concentration vs. time curve (AUC) will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal method with linear interpolation. The AUC will not be calculated for PK profiles with less than [ADDRESS_793350] three observed 
concentration values after Cmax, but not including Cmax. The slope of the terminal elimination phase will 
be determined using log linear regression on the unweighted concentration data. Parameters relying on 
the determination of the terminal elimination phase will not be reported if the coefficient of 
determination is less than 0.800, or if the extrapolation of the AUC to infinity represented more than 20% 
of the total area. The parameters Tmax, Cmax, AUC(0-t), AUC (0-inf) and T1/2 will be reported for each 
SAD cohort and for the MSD cohort on after the Day 6 dose of BIO 300 Oral Powder.  
9.3. Analysis for Blood -Based Biomarkers  
Blood -based biomarkers will be identified by [CONTACT_599379].  Transcriptome analysis will  be 
conducted  by [CONTACT_54959] -end RNA sequencing. After investigating the quality of the raw sequencing data, 
sequence reads will be  trimmed to remove possible adapter sequences and nucleotides with poor quality 
using Trimmomatic v.0.36. The trimmed reads w ill be  mapped to the Homo sapi[INVESTIGATOR_599355] v.2.5.2b. The STAR aligner is a splice aligner that detects 
splice junctions and incorporates them to help align the entire read sequences. Binary Alignment Map 
(BAM ) files will be  generated as a result of this step. Unique gene hit counts w ill be  calculated by [CONTACT_599380] c ounts from the Subread package v.1.5.2. Only unique reads that fell within exon regions w ill be  
counted.  
After extraction of gene hit counts, the gene hit counts table w ill be  used for do wnstream differential 
expression analysis. Using DESeq2, a comparison of gene expression between the groups of samples w ill 
be performed. The Wald test will be  used to generate p -values and Log2 fold changes. Genes with adjusted 
p-values < 0.05 and absolut e log2 fold changes > [ADDRESS_793351] w ill be used to cluster the set of genes based 
on their biological process and determine their statistical significance. A principal component analysis 
(PCA) will be  performed using the "plotPCA" function within the DESeq2 R package. Th is plot will show 
the samples in a 2D plane spanned by [CONTACT_599381]. The top [ADDRESS_793352] deviation, median, minimum and maximum values.  
10.2. Adverse Events  
The FDA guidance entitled “ Toxicity  Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled 
in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials” will be used to grade all AEs. All reported terms and descriptions for 
AEs will be coded using this FDA guidance  and summarized with frequencies and percentages by 
[CONTACT_1570], system organ classification (SOC) and preferred term.  
CL0106-01  Statistical Analysis Plan  December 28 , 2020 
 
 7 All AEs will be included in comprehensive and cohort separated data listings. Additionally, AE summaries 
will be provided for the following: 
• DLT 
• Serious AEs ( SAEs ) 
• All Grade 3 or 4 AEs  
• AEs leading to discontinuation from the study  
• AEs by [CONTACT_599382] 
• AEs with 10% or higher incidence rates  
For all AE summaries, events will be counted only once per subject by [CONTACT_167956]. 
When an AE occurs more than once for a subject, the maximum severity and causality will be used.  
Partial start and end dates for adverse events will be replaced by [CONTACT_599383]. The following steps wi ll be followed.  
For a partial start date:  
1. Replace a missing month with January  
2. Replace a missing calendar day with the first of the month  
For a partial end date:  
1. Replace a missing month with December  
2. Replace a missing calendar day with the last day of the month  
An end date will not be estimated for adverse events marked continuing at the end of the study . 
10.3. Clinical Laboratory Test Results 
Subject  minimum and maximum post -baseline laboratory values (and changes from baseline) for analytes 
measured  on a continuous scale will be summarized by [CONTACT_67423], standard deviation, median, minimum 
and maximum values. The same statistics will be calculated to summarize laboratory test results by [CONTACT_765].  
Ordinal categorical test results  with a corresponding  Toxic ity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and 
Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials  severity scale  will be summarized 
using shift tables.  
Urinalysis tests such as specific gravity and pH were collected only to assess a subjects’  eligibility to 
participate in the study. No analyses are planned for urinalysis test results.  
10.4. Vital Signs  
Subject  minimum and maximum post -baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
pulse rate, temperature and body weight  (and changes from baseline) will be summarized by [CONTACT_67423], 
standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values.  The same statistics will be calculated to 
summarize vital signs by [CONTACT_765].  
10.5. Electrocardiograms  
ECG QTc measurements will be summarized with descriptive  statistics and time point with respect to BIO 
300 Oral Powder administration. All ECG data will be displayed in a data listing.

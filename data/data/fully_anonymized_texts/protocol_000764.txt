8Protocol Summary
Study Compound(s):  Ubrogepant
Phase:  3
Study Objective:  To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 2 doses of ubrogepant ( 25mg and 50mg) 
compared to placebo for the acute treatment of a single migraine attack
Clinical Hypotheses:
1.  At least 1 ubrogepant dose is superior to placebo in the acute treatment of migraine .
2.  Ubrogepant is safe and tolerable.
Study Design
Structure:  Multicenter, randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, single attack study; 
randomization to placebo, ubrogepant 25mg, or ubrogepant 50 mg .
Duration :  The study includes a screening period of up to 14 days prior to randomization, a 60 -day period in 
which to treat a single migraine attack, and a 4 -week follow -up period.
Study Treatment Groups :  Ubrogepant 25mg, ubrogepant 5 0 mg
Controls :  Ubrogepant placebo
Dosage/Dose Regimen :  Study participants will have up to [ADDRESS_679183] (IP) or rescue medication if the patient has either a nonresponding migraine or a 
migraine recurrence.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study Population Characteristics
Number of Patients :  Approximately 1650 patients will be randomized ( 550per treatment arm)
Condition/Disease :  Migraine with or without aura
Key Inclusion Criteria :  To be eligible for study participation, patients must be 18 to 75 years of age (inclusive), 
have a history of migraine with or w ithout aura for at least 1 year consistent with a diagnosis according to the 
International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria, 3rdedition, beta version ( ICHD -3 beta, 2013 ) and 
experience between 2 to 8 migraine attacks with moderate to severe headache pain in each of the 3 months prior 
to Screening (Visit 1) .
Key Exclusion Criteria :  
 UBR-MD-02

Allergan Confidential Protocol UBR -MD-02 Amendment 3
9Response Measures
Efficacy :  Rating of headache severity, absence or presence of migraine -associated symptoms, use of rescue 
medication, use of optional second dose, and recurrence of headache pain
 
 
 
 
 
General Statistical Methods a nd Types of Analyses:   The efficacy analyses will be based on the Modified 
Intent -to-treat ( mITT )Population. The last observation carried forw ard (LOCF) approach will be used to impute 
missing posttreatment values. Baseline for efficacy is defined as the last nonmissing efficacy assessment before 
the initial dose of study treatment. For each primary variable, the observed response proportions will be 
provided by [CONTACT_1570]. Theprimary efficacy variable of pain freedom at 2 hours after the initial dos ewill 
be analyzed using a logistic regression model with categorical terms for treatment group, historical triptan 
response (triptan responder, triptan insufficient responder, or triptan naïve), use of medication for migraine 
prevention (yes/no), and basel ine headache severity (moderate or severe). The primary efficacy variable of 
absence of the most bothersome symptom at [ADDRESS_679184] bothersome. The respective comparisons of the ubrogepant dose sversus placebo, which are the formal 
tests of the efficacy hypotheses, w ill be conducted using the appropriate pairw ise contrasts within the logi stic 
regression model. For secondary and other efficacy endpoints related to migraine headache pain severity and/or 
recurrence, migraine -associated symptoms, or use of rescue medication (including the second dose of IP), the 
observed response proportions w ill be analyzed using the same methods used to analyze the primary efficacy 
variables. For secondary efficacy endpoints on migraine -associated symptoms, baseline presence/absence of the 
symptom will be included as an additional covariate for the logistic r egression model .The proportion of 
patients reporting satisfaction with study medication at 2 and 24 hours after the initial dose, the proportion of 
patients able to function normally at 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after the initial dose, and the proportion of pa tients 
assessed by [CONTACT_160477] “much better” or “very much better” at 2 hours after the initial dose will be analyzed 
using the same methods used to analyze the primary efficacy variables. The baseline functional disability score 
will also be included as a covariate for the analysis of the proportion of patients able to function normally. For 
the change from baseline in EQ- 5D-5Lindex value at 24hours after the initial dose
, treatment comparisons of 
ubrogepant dose groups versus placebo will be performed u sing an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
with categorical terms for treatment group, baseline severity, historical triptan response, and use of medication 
for migraine prevention, and with the baseline EQ-5D-5L index value as a covariate. Descriptive statistics will 
be provided for the change from baseline in the EQ VAS score at 24 hours after the initial dose by [CONTACT_6490].

151. Background and Clinical Rationale
What is Migraine and How Prevalent is It?
Migraine affects 18% of women and 6% of men in the [LOCATION_002] with a peak prevalence 
occurring between the ages of [ADDRESS_679185] during an attack ( Lipton et al, 2007). In the U nited States , work loss due to 
migraine is estimated to cost ~ $13 billion annually ( Hu et al, 1999). P revalence is similar in 
Europe, with migraine headache affecting 17.6% of women and 8% of men 
(Stovner andAndree, 2010
).It is currently  ranked by  [CONTACT_941] W orld Health Organization as 19th 
among causes of disability  (Katsarava et al, 2012). 
Migraine is ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_160324], unilateral headache of moderate 
or severe pain intensity , associated with nausea, vomiting, and/or sensitivity to light 
(photophobia) and sound (phono phobia). In about 25% of individuals, migraine headache 
may be preceded b y focal neurological dy sfunction (aura). Improving the diagnosis and 
optimizing treatments for migraine have been recognized as critically  important to reduce the 
global burden of 
migraine ( Katsarava et al, 2012
).
Because there are no biological markers for migraine, diagnosis is based on clinical history , 
exam, and the exclusion of other headache disorders. Phy sicians appl y clinical criteria to 
guide diagnoses and subsequent treatment. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_72436] a s yndrome diagnosis 
applied to patients with migraine (with or without aura) who have 1 to 14 headache day s per 
month. Chronic migraine is a specific International Classification of Headache Disorde rs 
criteria, 3rdedition beta version (ICHD -3 beta) diagnosis applied to a subset of patients with 
≥15 headache day s per month ( ICHD-3 beta, 2013; Katsarava et al, 2012 ; 
Olesen etal,2006). 
What is CGRP  and What is its Relationship to Migraine?
CGR P(calcitonin gene-related peptide) isaneuropeptide implicated in
thepathoph ysiology 
ofmigraine. CGR Plevels inthe cranial venous outflow (ie, external jugular vein) are
increased durin g amigraine attack ( Goadsb y
 and Edvinsson, 1993) and exogenous ly
administered CGR Phasbeen shown to trigger migraine- likeheadache in migraineurs. The 
majorit y (80%to 90%) oftrigeminal Aδfibers thatinnervate thedura contain CGRP ,
suggesting that these fibers may be involved insterile neurogenic inflammation and
migraine pain transmission. Furthermore, the CGRP receptor is present on human meningeal
andcerebral blood vessels. These observations suggest that activation of the 
 UBR-MD-02
15
Allergan Confidential Protocol UBR -MD-02 Amendment 3
16trigeminovascular s ystem, with release of CGRP , may play  a key  role in migraine 
pathogenesis and that inhibition of CGRP function may yield anovel therapeutic approach to
treating migraine.
Establishment of CGRP  Antagonism to Treat Migraine
The abilit y of CGR Pantagonism torelieve pain inthe acute treatment of migraine was
established by[CONTACT_523329] (I V)formulation ofolcegepant (Olesen etal,2004), 
andreplicated by [CONTACT_44873] & Co.,Incwith anoral formulation oftelcagepant, ahighly
selective CGR Preceptor antagonist (CGRP RA). InPhase 3studie s,telcagepant was
superior to placebo inthe primary  endpoints of 2
-hour pain freedom, 2- hour pain relief, 
and the absence of associated symptom s(photophobia, phonophobia, andnausea), aswell as
thekey secondar y endpoint of 24-hour sustained pain freedom (Connor et al, 2009 ). 
Serum alanine aminotransferase (AL T) increases were observed with telcagepant as well as 
with a second CGRP  antagonist, MK- 3207. For this reason, the development of these 
compounds was stopped. 
What is Ubr ogepant?
Ubrogepant, a novel CGRP  receptor anta gonist that is chemicall y distinct from both 
telcagepant and MK -3207, is now being developed for the acute treatment of migraine. 
Preclinical and clinical studies conducted to date for ubrogepant have shown no evidence of 
hepa totoxicity .
A Phase 2b clinica l study was conducted, which compared 1 -, 10-, 25-, 50- , and 100
-mg 
doses of ubrogepant to placebo in the acute treatment of migraine. Overall, all the ubrogepant 
doses tested were well tolerated and t he adverse event (AE) profile of all ubrogepant doses 
did not dif fer significantly  from placebo. For the primary  efficacy  endpoint of pain freedom
at 2hours, ubrogepant doses of 1 and 10 mg did not dif fer from placebo, but doses of 25, 50, 
and 100 mg were better than placebo. For the primary  efficacy  endpoint of pain relief at 
2hours none of the ubrogepant doses dif fered from placebo , probabl y due to a high placebo 
response rate.
The a bsence of migraine -associated s ymptoms of photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea was
assessed as key  secondary  endpoints. Ubroge pant doses of 50 and 100 mg were significantly  
better than placebo for absence of phonophobia and photophobia at 2 hours, whereas 25 mg 
did not dif fer from placebo. None of the ubrogepant doses dif fered from placebo for the 
endpoint of absence of nausea at 2 hours. Measures of sustained migraine headache relief 
 UBR-MD-02
16
Allergan Confidential Protocol UBR -MD-02 Amendment 3
17(2to 24 hours and 2 to 48 hours sustained pain freedom and sustained pain relief) generally  
suggest edthat ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg were more effective than the 25 -mg dose.
The purpose of this study will be to assess the safety and ef ficacy  of 2 doses of ubrogepant, 
25and 50 mg, versus placebo in the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura, in a 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 3 study .
2. Study Objectives and Clinical Hyp otheses 
2.1 Study Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy , safety , and tolerability  of 2 doses of ubrogepant ( 25and 50mg) 
compared to placebo for the acute treatment of a single migraine attack.
2.[ADDRESS_679186] 1 ubrogepant dose is superior to plac ebo in the acute treatment of migraine.
2.Ubrogepant is safe and tolerable.
3. Study Design
This multicenter , randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, single attack 
study  will enroll approximately  1650 patients from approximately  100 centers in the United 
States. Patients will be randomized (1:1:1) to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups:  placebo, 
ubrogepant [ADDRESS_679187] and description of each efficacy  assessment is in 
Section 6.1 and the efficacy anal yses are presented in Section 7.3.1.
The planned safet y assessments are AEs, clinical laboratory  tests, electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), vital signs, ph ysical examination, and the Columbia -Suicide Severity  Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS). Details regarding safet y assessments are described in Section 6.5and t he safety  
analyses are presented in Section 7.3.3.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_679188]
AnAdjudication Charter will be established and will describe the process for the blinded 
surveillance, monitoring, and adjudication b y the Clinical Adjudication Committee of events 
of posttreatment elevations of ALT and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 3 times the 
upper limit of normal (ULN) in the ubrogepant program. The purpose of this committee 
charter will be to provide a standardized process for the adj udication of data associated with 
these events in order to determine whether the elevation was 
related to ubrogepant. 
 UBR-MD-[ADDRESS_679189] (DSMB) will also be established to review 
unblinded safet y data and summary reports, identify any safety issues and trends ,and make 
recommendations to the Sponsor , including modification or early  termination of a trial, if 
emerging data show unexpected and clinically significant AEs of treatment.
Details of the DSMB memberships, standard operational procedures for data 
monitoring/review , frequency  of review , and other pertinent details will be provided in a 
separate DSMB Charter .

397.2 Collection and Derivation of Efficacy Assessments
7.2.1 Primary Efficacy Variables
The coprimary  efficacy  parameters for the U nited States are as follows:  
Pain freedom (PF) at 2 hours after the initial dose , defined as a reduction in headache 
severit y from moderate/severe at baseline to no pain, at 2 hours after the initial dose
Absence of the most bothersome migraine -associated sy mptom (the most bothersome 
migraine -associated s ymptom will be ide ntified at baseline for each patient) at 2 hours 
after the initial dose . 
7.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables
The secondary  efficacy  parameters for the[LOCATION_002]are:
Pain relief (PR) at 2 hours after the initial dose , defined as the reduction of a 
moderate/severe migraine headache to a mild headache or to no headache, at 2 hours 
after the initial dose
Sustained pain relief (SPR) from 2 to 24 hours after the initial dose , defined as pain 
relief with no administration of either rescue medication or the second dose of IP, and 
with no occurrence thereafter of a moderate/severe headache during the relevant 
number of hours after dosing with the IP
Sustained pain fr eedom (SPF) from 2 to 24 hours after the initial dose, defined as pain 
freedom with no administration of either rescue medication or the second dose of I P, 
and with no occurrence thereafter of a mild/moderate/severe headache during the 
relevant number of h ours after dosing with the IP
Absence of photophobia at 2 hours after the initial dose
Absence of phonophobia at 2 hours after the initial dose
Absence of nausea at [ADDRESS_679197] (LOCF) approach will be used to impute missing posttreatment values. Baseline for 
efficac y is defined as the last nonmissing ef ficacy  assessment before the initial dose of study  
treatment. All statistical tests will be 2 -sided hy pothesis tests performed at the 5% level of 
significance for main ef fects. All confidence intervals will be 2-sided 95% confidence 
intervals, unless stated otherwise.

427.3.1 Efficacy Analyses
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Analyses
For each primary  variable, the observed response proportions will be provided by  [CONTACT_6490]. The primary  efficacy  variable of pain freedom at 2 hours after the initial dose will be 
analyzed using a logistic regression model with categorical terms for treatment group, 
historical triptan response (triptan respon der, triptan insufficient responder, or triptan naïve), 
use of medication for migraine prevention (y es/no), and baseline headache severit y 
(moderate or severe). The primary  efficacy  variable of absence of the most bothersome 
symptom at [ADDRESS_679198] bothersome. If the logistic regression model fails to converge due to complete or 
quasi -complete separation, Firth’s penalized likelihood method ( Firth, 1993 ) will be used. 
The logistic regression model will be referred to as the primary  model. 
The respective comparisons of the ubrogepant dose sversus placebo, whi ch are the formal 
tests of the efficacy  hypotheses, will be conducted using the appropriate pairwise contrasts 
within the logistic regression model. Treatment comparisons will be based on the model -
derived odds ratios and their associated 95% confidence in tervals. Two- sided p -values will 
also be provided. 
, the study will be considered a success if at least 1 ubrogepant dose is 
demonstrated to be superior to placebo on both coprimary  variables after multiplicity  
adjustment. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
For each secondary  efficacy  endpoint, the observed response propor tions will be analy zed 
using the same methods used to anal yze the primary  efficacy  variables. The respective 
comparisons of the ubrogepant doses versus placebo will be conducted using model -derived 
odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals and p -values from th e logistic regression model. For 
secondary  efficacy  endpoints on migraine -associated sy mptoms, baseline presence/absence 
of the sy mptom will be included as an additional covariate for the logistic regression model. 
 UBR-MD-02
42

Allergan Confidential Protocol UBR -MD-02 Amendment 3
43A graphical approach b y Bretz et al ( 2009 ) will be used to control the overall ty pe I error rate 
for multiple comparisons across the ubrogepant doses and the primary  and secondary  
efficacy  endpoints. The coprimary  efficacy  endpoints will serve as the gatekeepers of the 
secondary  endpoints. The secondary  endpoints will be tested in the same order as they  appear 
in the list of secondary  endpoints, except for the 3 migraine -associated s ymptoms which will 
be treated at the same level to allow the recy clingof weights am ong the 3 sy mptom 
endpoints. Recy clingof weights between the 2 doses is also allowed. The details of the 
multiple comparison procedure will be provided in the statistical analy sis plan (SAP).

 UBR-MD-[ADDRESS_679200] ivity instructions for patients enrolled in the study .
Patients will be provided with instructions on the use of the eDiary  to complete when they  
experience a qualify ing migraine . A practice session with a hy pothetical scenario should be 
administered to en sure the patients’  comprehension of the questions and the information to be 
entered . In addition, criteria for a qualify ing migraine to be treated as well as prohibited 
medications should be reviewed with the patients. Patients will be instructed to bring their 
eDiary  at the next clinic visit and return their IP  (used and unused).
 
8.6 Unscheduled Visits
Additional examinations and laboratory  assessments may  be performed as necessary  to 
ensure the safet y and well -being of the patients during the stud y period. Unscheduled visit 
eCRFs should be completed for each unscheduled visit. For all param eters not measured, 
indicate “not done”.
8.7 Compliance with Pr otocol
All assessments will be conducted at the appropriate visits as outlined in Table1, and th
e
timing of the visits should occur as close as possible to the specified day . At each visit, the 
patient will be asked if the patient changed the dose/regimen of any  existing concomitant 
 UBR-MD-[ADDRESS_679201] all unused IP.
8.8 Early Discontinuation of Patients
A premature discontinuation will occur when a patient who signed the informed consent form 
(ICF) and has been randomized ceases participation in the study , regardless of circumstances, 
before completion of the study . Patients can be prematurely  discontinued from the study  for 
one of the following reasons :
AE
Protocol violation
Noncompliance with IP
Withdrawal of consent (a clear reason must be documented)
Lost to follow -up. (Every ef fort must be made to contact [CONTACT_102]; a 
certified/traceable letter must be sent.)
Lack of Qualify ing Event (a qualify ing migraine is not treated within 60 day s from 
Randomization [Visit 2] )
Pregnancy
Other reasons
Patients may  voluntaril y withdraw from the stud y at an y time. Notification of earl y patient 
discontinuation from the study  and the reason for discontinuation will be clearl y documented 
on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF) . All randomized patients who 
prematurel y discontinue from the study, regardless of cause, should be seen for a final 
assessment. A final assessment will be defined as completion of the evaluations scheduled for 
Visit 3/Early  Termination  
.If 
the patient discontinues after IPis taken, the patient is also expected to return for the Safety 
Follow -up V isit (V isit 4) 4 weeks postdose.

Allergan Confidential Protocol UBR -MD-02 Amendment 3
608.9 Withdrawal Criteria
Women who become pregnant will be withdrawn from the study (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and 
should refrain from taking IP. The patient should return to the clinic for early  termination
procedures (V isit 3) , including the safet y follow -up visit (V isit 4) if I P was taken.
Patients who reply  with “y es” to questions 4 or 5 in the suicidal ideation section or “y es” to 
any ques tion in the suicidal behavior section of the C -SSRS at Visit 3  
 and should receive appropriate follow -up as in routine clinical practice , 
including the safet y follow -up visit (V isit 4) if I P was taken.
A patient with a condition and/or a situation that, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], may  put the 
patient at significant risk, may  confound the study  results, or may  interfere significantl y with 
the patient's participation in the study  may  be withdrawn from treatment.
 
 
 
 
 
8.11 Study Termination
Allergan may stop the study (and/or the stud y site) for an y reason with appropriate 
notification.

61the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product. I n addition, during the screening period, AEs will be assessed 
regardless of the administration of a pharmaceutical product.
Note:  AEs must be collected once informed consent has been obtained, regardless of 
whether or not the patient has been administered study  drug.
Progression of treatment indicat ion including new or worsening of anticipated clinical signs 
or sy mptoms, which are collected as clinical efficacy  variables and assessed as unequivocall y 
associated with the disease progression and /or lack of efficacy , should NOT  be reported as 
AEs unles s the disease progression is greater than anticipated in the natural course of the 
disease. 
Adverse events will be assessed, documented, and recorded in the eCRF throughout the study  
(ie, after informed consent has been obtained). At each visit, the investigator will begin b y 
query ing for AEs by [CONTACT_229298] a general, non -directed question such as “How have 
you been feeling since the last visit?” Directed questioning and examination will then be 
done as appropriate. All reported AEs will be documen ted on the appropriate eCRF .
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is any  AEoccurring at an y dose that results in any  of the following outcomes:  death, 
a life -threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persi stent or significant disability/incapacity , or a congenital anomaly /birth 
defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_227334] a nSAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may  jeopardize the patient and may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (See Section 9.3 for procedures for reporting 
SAEs .)
Allergan considers all cancer AEs as SAEs . In addition, Allergan considers any abortion 
(spontaneous or nonspontaneous) as a n SAE .
Preplanned surgeries or procedures for pre -existing, known medical conditions fo r which a 
patient requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358174] a n SAE .
Any preplanned surgery  or procedure should be clearl y documented in the site source 
documents by  [CONTACT_358226]’ s entry  into the

Mild Awareness of sign or s ymptom, but easily  tolerated
Moderate Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity
Severe Incapacitating with inability  to work or do usual activity
9.1.4 Relationship to Study Drug or Study Pr ocedure
A determination will be made of the relationship (if an y) between an AEand the study  drug 
or study  procedure, as applicable. A causal relationship is present if a determination is made 
that there is a reasonable possibility  that the AEmay have been caused by  [CONTACT_523332].

All SAEs that are drug -related and unexpected (not listed as trea tment -related in the current 
investigator's brochure) must be reported to the governing Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (I RB/IEC) as required by  [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, local 
regulations, and the governing health authorities. Any adverse event that is marked 
“ongoing” at the exit visit must be followed -up as appropriate.
9.3 Procedures for Reporting a Serious Adverse Event
Any SAE occurring during the stud y period (beginning with informed consent) and for at 
least [ADDRESS_679205] be reported to Allergan or 
Agent of Allergan (eg, contract research organization [ CRO ]) and recorded on the SAE form. 
All patients with a nSAE must be followed up and the outcomes reported. The investigator 
must supply  Allergan and the I

completed 2 hours after the initial dose: 
…the proportion of patients assessed by 
[CONTACT_160477] “much better” or “very much 
better” at 224hours after the initial dose 
will be analyzed using the same methods 
used to analyz e the primary efficacy 
variables.Expert input recommended a change in 
PGIC assessment from 24 hours to 2 
hours after the initial dose to increase 
the probability of differentiating

Date of Amendment:  19May 2017
Amendment Summary
This summary  includes changes made to Protocol UBR -MD-02 Amendment 2, 
(04Nov 2016). This protocol was amended to: 1) increase sample size from 450 to 
550
patients per arm ; 2) revise statistical methods to include an additional categorical term to 
the logistic regression analy sis for t he primary  efficacy  variable of absence of the most 
bothersome s ymptom at 2 hours after the initial dose ; 3) 
revise statistical methods to include 
an additional categorical term to the logistic regr ession analy sisfor the secondary  efficacy  
endpoints on migraine -associated s ymptoms; 4) reorder the secondary  endpoints,  
 
and6) remove the 35% triptan insufficient responder 
requirement .
Following is a summary  of content -oriented changes that were made to each section of the 
protocol, and a brief rationale for these changes. Minor editorial and document formatting

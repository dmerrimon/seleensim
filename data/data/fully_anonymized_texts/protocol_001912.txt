The study protocol . 
The study participants were patients of Astoria Pain Management, [LOCATION_001], [LOCATION_003] (age 
28–72 years) with a clinical diagnosis of cervical radiculitis. The Canadian SHIELD 
Ethics Review Board approved this study (July 18, 2019. REB tracking number: 19 -06-
002),  conducted from August 19, 2019, to October 8, 2019. Patients were eligible for the 
study if they met the criteria for cervical  ESI, which included clinical and recent MRI 
findings confirming the diagnosis of  cervical radiculitis and inadequate pain relief  with 
conservative care for more  than 3 months. Other  criteria were if the procedure was 
covered by [CONTACT_401177], and if they  signed informed consent. Patients were 
excluded from the study if they were taking anticoagulants or had serious comorbiditie s 
such as congestive heart failure.  
The p atients were divided into two groups of 20 each and underwent CESI with either 
an 18G or a 25G Tuohy needle . Patient  selection for the18G and 25 G groups was not 
random. For example, the preference was  given for a 25G needle when the procedure 
was performed at the C5 -6 level (25G/18G  = 15/4)  and for an 18G (18G/25G  = 16/5) 
when the needle was inserted at  C6-7 or C7 -T1 level.  The smaller needles were favored 
for females (25G/(25G+18G) = 17/24) vs. males (25G/(25G+ 18G) = 3/16) . The skin was 
anesthetized with 1% lidocaine in the 18G group but not in the 25G group.  All CESIs 
were performed utiliz ing the fluoroscopy only method when the needle was navigated 
from the skin toward the epi[INVESTIGATOR_666796] o blique fluoroscopy,  and the 
contrast spread technique was employed for epi[INVESTIGATOR_666797]. After 
radiological confirmation of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_666798], LOR was tested using an Epi[INVESTIGATOR_666799]® 
device (Exmoor Innovatio ns Ltd., Somerset, [LOCATION_006]). Subsequently, acc ompanied by [CONTACT_666808], I observed the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_666800] 30 seconds or more; if the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_666801],  the result was positive. However, if the device remained inflated, the result 
was reported as negative. The collected data was then analyzed.    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Statistical analysis and Results.  
 
There were three investigations:  
1) Within group 1; 18G (LORT vs. CST),  
2) Within group 2; 25G (LORT vs. CST); and   
3) Between groups 1 and 2 (LORT 1 vs. LORT 2).  
 
The Confidence Interval Test for Proportion to estimate the confidence interval (CI) 
between LORT and CST within groups 1 and 2  was employed . The 95% CI was [0.385, 
0.815] for group 1 (LORT 60%; 18G) and [ -0.031, 0.231] for group 2 (LORT 10%; 25G), 
confirming that LORT showed a statistica lly significant lower rate of epi[INVESTIGATOR_666802] (Table 1).

the CST.  x –positive results, n –number of patients, p –percentage of positive results.  
 
The z -test for independent proportions was utilized to compare the epi[INVESTIGATOR_666805] 1 (group 1; 18G) and LORT 2 (group 2; 25G). Since CST 
detected 100%, it was employed as a benchmark to conduct a hypothesis test of 
proportion, using H 0: ρ = 1; Ha: ρ < 1. There was a statistically significant difference 
between the proportions of epi[INVESTIGATOR_666806] 18G c ompared to 
25G needles: z = 3.31, p < 0.001, Cohen's h = 1.13 (Table 2).

Cohen’s h  
0.[ADDRESS_900179]=20 (100%) was employed as a benchmark. Since p -value: 0.0009 < 0.05, H 0 was rejected. 
As Cohen’s h > 0.8, the difference in LORT detection rate between 18G and 25G needles is 
large.

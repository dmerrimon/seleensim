OAB affects up to 27% of women in the [LOCATION_002] and has been shown to negatively impact quality of life and increase rates of depression and sleep disturbances.1-4 For patients who areIRB ID:  MOD00007450  IRB Approved: 1/17/2024 - 9/11/[ADDRESS_269266]-line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_223785] (BTX-A) or Botox injections.BTX-A is a highly efficacious therapy with a reliable safety profile and demonstrable improvements in subjective and objective measures for OAB symptom control.4-7 This procedure is quick and requires minimal equipment, making it ideal for the outpatient office setting. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_223786]-A being a common practice, limited research has been done to optimize the injection technique for 200 or 300 units of BTX-A. This amount of BTX-A can be administered to patients who suffer from non-idiopathic OAB caused by [CONTACT_223801] a neurological disorder, refractory idiopathic OAB8, and radiation cystitis9.Neurological disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Spi[INVESTIGATOR_17751] (SCI), Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Spi[INVESTIGATOR_171514] (SB), and stroke disrupt neural control of voiding and lead to the development of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD), which develops when either the detrusor muscle fails to maintain effective contractions (voiding phase) or fails to relax appropriately with low pressures (storage phase), if the urethral sphincter (internal or external) fails to lower its tonicity and resistance, or if there is an asynchrony in events eventually leading to detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD). Different patterns of NLUTD (including both storage and voiding) can arise depending on the level of injury or type of neurological disease. It can be characterized by [CONTACT_223802], frequency and incontinence or urinary hesitancy and retention that leads to urinary tract infections (UTIs).Management of NLUTD symptoms is complex. Treatment with BTX-A has been shown to decrease epi[INVESTIGATOR_223787]. It has also been shown to ameliorate a multitude of devastating complications, such as upper tract deterioration, recurrent urinary tract infections, sepsis, and death.10-11 According to the current manufacturer’s recommendation, a standard 200-unit vial of Botox® should be diluted in 30cc of 0.9% saline and injected across [ADDRESS_269267] depth and location for injection, optimal concentration, and volume of toxin per injection site is. The objective of this study is to determine the optimal injection schema for 200 or 300 units of intradetrusor BTX-A in the office setting.We hypothesize that patients indicated for an injection of 200 or 300 units of BTX-A for all indications will be more willing to pursue additional sessions of BTX-A injections with a protocol utilizing less injection sites, while still maintaining effectiveness of the procedure.2.Purpose of the Study / ObjectivesSpecific Aim 1: To evaluate patient satisfaction and perceived discomfort during office- based injection of intradetrusor BTX-A via two different administration protocols.a. We will assess and compare validated questionnaires between two groups of patients receiving 20 versus 5 injections. We will assess and compare patient willingness to continue with treatment by [CONTACT_223803]-A injections over 12 months of follow-up.IRB ID:  MOD00007450  IRB Approved: 1/17/2024 - 9/11/2024
3Specific Aim 2: To evaluate treatment effectiveness between the two different administration protocols.a. We will compare validated questionnaires between two groups of patients receiving 20 versus 5 injections.b. We will compare procedure time between the two groups.We will compare two common and specific adverse events (AEs) between the two groups including symptomatic UTIs, symptomatic gross hematuria, and new-onset incomplete bladder emptying necessitating de-novo bladder catheterization.3.BackgroundProper function of the lower urinary tract (LUT) is intricately regulated by [CONTACT_223160]. To achieve both storage and release of urine (voiding) the connections between the brain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_223788]12. During bladder filling, sympathetic nuclei at the T11-T12 spi[INVESTIGATOR_223789]. Once it is deemed appropriate to void, tonic inhibition of the pontine micturition center (PMC) by [CONTACT_223804].20 Parasympathetic nuclei at the S2-S4 spi[INVESTIGATOR_223790]. Acetylcholine and noradrenaline released from postganglionic nerve terminals onto M3 muscarinic receptors induce bladder contraction, while simultaneous acetylcholine release from somatic axons relaxes urethral smooth muscles, all leading to effective bladder emptying.Neurological disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Spi[INVESTIGATOR_17751] (SCI), Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Spi[INVESTIGATOR_171514] (SB), and stroke disrupt neural control of voiding and lead to the development of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD), which develops when either the detrusor muscle fails to maintain effective contractions (voiding phase) or fails to relax appropriately with low pressures (storage phase), if the urethral sphincter (internal or external) fails to lower its tonicity and resistance, or if there is an asynchrony in events eventually leading to detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD).Different patterns of NLUTD (including both storage and voiding) can arise depending on the level of injury or type of neurological disease. It can be characterized by [CONTACT_223805] (OAB) symptom complex which may include urinary urgency, frequency and incontinence or urinary hesitancy, and also retention that may lead to urinary tract infections (UTIs). Conditions such as radiation cystitis or BCG induced cystitis may also cause disruption of the neural control of voiding leading to lower urinary tract dysfunction and OAB9.Management of LUTD symptoms primarily due to storage dysfunction include various pharmacological agents (anticholinergics, antimuscarinics, beta-3- receptor agonists), intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxinA (BTX-A) and tibial or sacral neuromodulation modalities. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_223791], it is important to continue to improve these treatment modalities to better serve individuals with LUTD due to storage dysfunction. The objective of this study is to determine the optimal injection schema for 200 or 300 units of intradetrusor BTX-A for all patients in theIRB ID:  MOD00007450  IRB Approved: 1/17/2024 - 9/11/2024

Patients will be randomized into one of two groups:-Schema 1: 200 or 300 units BTX-A reconstituted in 20 mL normal saline, injected into the bladder detrusor in 20 separate injections of 1 mL including the trigone.-Schema 2: 200 or 300 units or more BTX-A reconstituted in 5 mL normal saline, injected into the bladder detrusor in 5 separate injections of 1 mL including the trigoneThis trial will be designed and reported as outlined in the CONSORT guidelines.Endpoints:Primary Endpoints:a. Change in patient willingness to repeat BTX-A injection procedure as assessed with an 11-point visual analog scale.b. Change in discomfort in patients that undergo BTX-A injection, measured using the Numeric Pain Scale scores provided by [CONTACT_223806].c. Change in Patient Global Impression of Improvement score provided [ADDRESS_269268]- procedure.Secondary endpoints:a. Change in procedure times (from cystoscope insertion to removal).b. Change in International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form.c. Change in Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score – Short FormSafety endpoints:a. Incidence of symptomatic UTI within the first 4- 6 weeks after the procedure.b. Incidence of bleeding requiring admission or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/office evaluation related to the injection procedure.c.

A continuous model was utilized. Cohen effect sizes were used with a power of 80% with statistical significance defined as an alpha of 0.05 for a target sample size of 74 patients. Accounting for a 5% drop out rate, our final target sample size will be 78 patients split between the two study groups (please see the randomization plan below).Recruitment: Individuals with the diagnosis of OAB symptoms (frequency, urgency, UUI) who do not have a painful bladder condition and scheduled to undergo [ADDRESS_269270] (EMR).The dosing amount will be determined by [CONTACT_223808]-A treatment based on clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_223792]. We will recruit and sample from patients who are already scheduled for this therapy prior to study enrollment. Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be approached on the day of the procedure and consented in person if they are interested in participating.5.Study InterventionThe study will include a clinic visit for the Botox procedure, a scheduled follow-up visit, and possibly a 15-minute phone call approximately 6 weeks after Botox injection.During the clinic visit, the patient will rate the patient’s willingness to repeat the procedure and pain level and fill out a short questionnaire called the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF) and Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score-Short Form (NBSS-SF). At the follow-up visit, the patient will fill out the ICIQ-UI SF and NBSS-SF again to assess symptom improvement, Patient Global Impression (PGI) of Improvement score, and assess the patient’s willingness to repeat the procedure. The questionnaire should take roughly 5 minutes to fill out. The component of the patient’s participation that is being researched is the patient’s willingness to repeat the procedure, response to questionnaires, and clinical response to the Botox. In addition, if the patient participates in the study, data from the medical record will be collected for this research. Types of data collected include demographic and baseline characteristics, procedural time, procedural response, discomfort with the procedure, and any procedural complications encountered. Besides 4-6 weeks follow-up, patients charts will retrospectively reviewed at the 6-12 months At 6 months to 1 year after their Botox injection, to see if additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_223793].

A trained, primary member of the research team will identify all patients scheduled for BTX-A as listed on the EPIC schedule for the Urology providers listed above: [CONTACT_223819], [CONTACT_223818], [CONTACT_223820], and [CONTACT_223821]. Without opening charts, a note can be placed on the schedule for patients >18 yo to be evaluated for study qualification. The physician caring for the patient on the day of their scheduled BTX-A procedure will identify whether the patient meets inclusion/exclusion criteria for study enrollment based on the criteria listed in this protocol (inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in the Study Population section above). By [CONTACT_223810], the patients’ information in the EMR will only be accessed by [CONTACT_223811].These patients will be approached on the day of the procedure and consented to in person if they are interested in participating. Other than a detailed consent form, no recruitment materials or advertisements will be utilized as part of this study.12.Withdrawal of SubjectsSubjects would be withdrawn from the study if they are found to have symptomaticIRB ID:  MOD00007450  IRB Approved: 1/17/2024 - 9/11/[ADDRESS_269274] infection on the day of the procedure – this would be defined by [CONTACT_223812], frequency or urgency above baseline, or hematuria along with a urine dip that is positive for nitrites or leukocyte esterase.• Subjects would be withdrawn if they are not able to tolerate the procedure itself and it is terminated prior to full injection of reconstituted BTX-A or if BTX-A was not able to be injected for other reasons (difficult anatomy, unable to pass scope or perform in the office)13.Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of SubjectsPrivacy will be protected by [CONTACT_223813]. Caregivers that patients interact with during a typi[INVESTIGATOR_223797]-A procedure include front desk staff for check in, the nurse/medical assistant helpi[INVESTIGATOR_223798], a resident or fellow if present in clinic that day, and the attending staff. Additional personnel patients would have to interact with to participate in the study would be a research member during the consent process ([CONTACT_223822], Hamida Rijab, Julu Benoy, research coordinators) and a research member during the telephone follow-up. The patient will be made to feel at ease with this research through a thorough explanation of the study protocol, the BTX-A procedure itself, and follow-up telephone encounters. All study members will be introduced by [CONTACT_223814]- explained that either injection protocol are standard ways that we perform BTX-A in the office every day.14.Risks to SubjectsThe risks to the subjects participating in this study are only represent risks inherent to the nature of the BTX-A procedure itself – risks all subjects would be incurring regardless or participation or exemption given that we are only including patients who are scheduled for BTX-A prior to enrollment.Risks of undergoing intradetrusor BTX-A include: Post-procedural UTI (up to 10-30% in the literature, variations based on definition of UTI), bleeding requiring admission (<1%), and urinary retention (up to 5%).There is some risk of physical discomfort with injections, which we are hopeful to optimize with the results of this data. We ameliorate this risk through the instillation of local anesthetic into the bladder, which is standard protocol for all BTX-A injections and is recommended on the package insert/FDA approval for BTX-A.There should be no psychological, social, legal, or economic risks to the subjects. There is a small risk of loss of confidentiality that is inherent to the nature of any study participation. We will work to minimize this risk through the early de-identification of participants and through careful data storage by [CONTACT_223815].BTX-A is considered to be pregnancy category C according to the package insert. This is based on animal studies, showing mostly reduction in fetal birth weight, as very limited studies regarding BTX-A in pregnancy have been performed in humans. A survey study of physicians who have performed BTX-A in pregnant women, knowingly or unknowingly, shows minimal risk14. For this research, the majority of our patients are post-menopausal. We do not perform BTX-A injections in women with knownIRB ID:  MOD00007450  IRB Approved: 1/17/2024 - 9/11/2024
10pregnancies. Pregnancy is an exclusion criterion for this study – all women of reproductive women will be screened for pregnancy.There are no risks to patients who do not participate as study subjects.15.Potential Benefits1.Every patient in the study will benefit from intradetrusor BTX-A injections, ahighly effective treatment, as prescribed by [CONTACT_223816].2.A potential benefit to the individual could be reduced procedural discomfort due to an optimized injection protocol.16.Financial and Economic Issues-There is no cost to the patients associated with participation in this study.-Patients will be compensated $100 for their participation in this study. They will receive$100 at the initial visit and another $[ADDRESS_269275] access to the names of the participants. All consent forms and randomization allocations will be stored in a locked cabinet in the study coordinator’s password- protected HMH office. Any electronic data will be securely stored in the primary co- investigator’s (Miceli) office on a password protected office computer. This office is always locked, and the computer is only opened through password protection. All data will be stored in Houston Methodist’s electronic record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_223799]. All physical data/consents will be destroyed (shredded or erased from the computer hard drive) when use is no longer needed but not before a minimum of [ADDRESS_269276] fulfills inclusion criteria, the study team member (attending, fellow, research coordinator) will discuss the goal of the study and the process of BTX-A reconstitution and injection. If the patient is interested, the study requirements will be explained in detail - including requirements on the day of the procedure (short questionnaire, NPS rating prior to and after procedure) and [ADDRESS_269277] flowing this discussion.□If the patient agrees to participate, they will be consented in person by a member of the research team and will then be randomized. These documents will be safely storedIRB ID:  MOD00007450  IRB Approved: 1/17/2024 - 9/11/2024
11as discussed above.□A copy of the consent will be retained by [CONTACT_223817] a locked file cabinet, and one copy will be given to the patient.19.Waiver of Informed Consent and /or AuthorizationWe will be requesting HIPAA waiver for performing preparatory research activities such as reviewing patient’s surgical and medical history and for the purpose of this study.The researchers have taken steps to minimize this risk. The research team will take proper precautions to ensure that any information regarding a patient’s personal identity obtained in connection with this research will remain confidential. Patients will be assigned a unique study identification number. This number will be used to identify patients’s study participation; their personally identifiable data will be storedseparately. All study data will be stored in the secure and access-restricted REDCap research database maintained at Houston Methodist. Only the investigators and authorized study team members have access to the REDCap database. There are no plans to share any study data collected for this research with anyone outside of the study team; however, no one outside of the authorized study team would be able to link patients’s study code with their personally identifiable information. Any inclusion of patient identifiers within the database will not be shared externally outside of the study team.20.References1.Haylen BT, Ridder D, Freeman RM, Swift SE, Berghmans B, Lee J, Monga A, Petri E, Rizk D, Sand P, Schaer G.

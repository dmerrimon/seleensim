1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EVICEL Fibrin Sealant (Human) for 
use as an adjunct to sutured dural repair in cranial surgery.  The effectiveness objective of this study is to 
evaluate whether EVICEL Fibrin Sealant (Human) is non -inferior to DuraSeal Dural Sealant System 
(Control) for use as an adjunct to sutured dural repair in cranial surgery.   
2. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a single-blinded randomized, controlled study evaluating EVICEL as an adjunct to sutured dural 
closure compared to DuraSeal Dural Sealant System.  
Approximately 230 subjects undergoing posterior fossa or supratentorial procedures (craniectomy or 
craniotomy) will be enrolled in the trial with at least 60 subjects und ergoing posterior fossa procedures 
being randomized.  
Upon completion of the sutured dural repair, the closure will be evaluated for intraoperative 
cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) leakage with a baseline Valsalva maneuver performed to an intra- thoracic 
pressure between 20-[ADDRESS_539354] a CSF leak will be stratified by [CONTACT_426742], posterior fossa or supratentorial 
approach , and then randomized to either EVICEL Fibrin Sealant or DuraSeal Dural Sealant System in a 
1:[ADDRESS_539355]-operatively through discharge and again at 30 (-/+7) days and 60 (-/+14) 
days post-surgery.  For the primary endpoint, the incidence of CSF leaks will be assessed up to the [ADDRESS_539356]-
operative follow-up period.  A CSF leak or pseudomeningocele will be reported  as detected by [CONTACT_117162]: clinical observation, diagnostic testing, imaging or the need for surgical intervention to 
directly treat a CSF leak.  
Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of treatment to each subject, to increase the 
likelihood that attributes of the subject are balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity 
of statistical comparisons across treatment groups.  
The Sponsor will provide each study site with two sets (Supratentorial or Posterior Fossa A pproach) of 
computer-generated randomization envelopes, each bearing the sequential subject randomization number, 
and containing the treatment allocation and stratification.  In the event that a potential subject fails intra -
 Page 4 of 20  Version:  AMENDMENT 1     Date: March  21, [ADDRESS_539357] a CSF leak during surgery and up to 
the 30- day ( -/+ 7) post- operative period.  A subject is declared as a success when the following conditions 
are met:  
• absence of intra- operative CSF leak following final Valsalva maneuver, and  
• absence of CSF leak or pseudomeningocele in the surgical area during the 30 -day ( -/+ 7) follow-up 
period.  
A confirmed CSF leak or pseudomeningocele is diagnosed by [CONTACT_5292], diagnostic testing, 
imaging study or the need for surgical intervention to directly treat a CSF leak during the 30- day ( -/+ 7 
days) follow-up at the location where randomized treatment was applied.  
In addition, the following safety endpoints will be included in this study:  
• Incidence of intra- operative CSF leakage following final Valsalva maneuver;  
• Incidence of post- operative CSF leakage within 3 0 days (±7) post- operatively;  
• Incidence of post-operative CSF leakage within 60 (±14) days post- operatively;  
• Incidence of surgical site infections (SSI) according to NNIS definition and CDC classification 
within 30 days (±7) post- operatively;  
• Incidence of adverse events, collected from time of randomization, throughout the follow-up 
period until 60 days (±14) after the procedure. 
4. CHANGES IN THE CONDUCT OF THE STUDY OR PLANNED ANALYSIS  
Not applicable. 
5. ANALYSIS SETS 
The following three analysis sets defined:  
• Intent- to-treat (ITT ) set consists of all enrolled and randomized subjects.

8. EFFECTIVENESS  
 
8.1 General m ethods of analysis 
The Clinical Data Management and Biostatistics groups within  Clinical Development at ETHICON will 
be responsible for the overall analysis of data from this protocol.  All analyses/summaries will be 
produced using SAS (Version 9.1 (EG) or later).  
Effectiveness data will be summarized descriptively for subjects in each treatment group  in the ITT set  to 
assess comparability of treatment groups.  The categorical data will be summarized descriptively by 
[CONTACT_426743]. The continuous data will be presented using summary 
statistics such as number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, min imum, median and maximum.   
 Page 7 of 20  Version:  AMENDMENT 1     Date: March  21, [ADDRESS_539359] CSF leak during surgery and up to the 
30-day (±7) post-operative period.  A subject is declared  success when the following conditions are met:  
• Absence of  intra -operative CSF leak following Valsalva maneuver, and  
• Absence of CSF leak or pseudomeningocele in surgical area during the 30 -day follow-up period.  
 
The primary effectiveness parameter will be analyzed using the ITT and Per -Protocol analysis sets.  The 
Per-Protocol analysis will be the  primary effectiveness analysis.  
The analysis for the ITT set will be performed considering missing data as failures; in addition, 
sensitivity analyses for the ITT set will be performed considering missing data as successes, and, as 
worst -case, with missing data for the EVICEL® group considered as failures and missing data for the 
DuraSeal™ group considered as successes.  
The statistical hypothesis for testing the treatment difference is presented as follows:  
• H0: Δ ≤ - 0.[ADDRESS_539360] the alternative hypothesis  
• Ha: Δ > -0.10.  
where:  
• Δ is the difference between the success rates of Experimental and Control (Experimental minus 
Control)  
• -0.10 is the non- inferiority difference  
• The assumed proportion of successes for Control is 0.95.  
PC is the proportion of success in DuraSeal™ Control subjects and P E is the proportion of success in 
EVICEL® subjects.  
Two hundred and two (202) evaluable subjects (101 per arm) will achieve 90% power to detect a non-
inferiority margin difference in group proportions of -0.10.  The proportion of successes in the Control 
group is 0.95. The proportion of successes in EVICEL® group is assumed to be 0.85 under the null 
hypothesis of inferiority.  The power was computed for the case when the actual proportion of successes 
in the EVICEL® group is 0.95.  The one- sided significance level of the test is 0.025.  
If the lower limit of the one -sided 97.5% confidence interval for Δ is greater than -0.10, then it will be 
concluded that EVICEL® is consider ed to be non-inferior to DuraSeal™.  
For the primary endpoint, the comparability between the surgical procedure (posterior fossa or 
supratentorial approach) subgroups will be evaluated using a logistic regression analysis, with 
success/failure fo r primary endpoint as dependent variable and with surgical procedure, treatment group,  
and interactio n between surgical procedure and treatment group as independent variables included in the 
model.  The interaction term s will be considered significant at 0.[ADDRESS_539361] demographics and baseline characteristics on the primary endpoint 
may also be evaluated.   In addition, the primary endpoint will be compared between treatment groups 
using a Co chran -Mantel -Haenszel ( CMH) Chi -square test adjusting for the surgical procedure at 0.05 
significance level. 
 Page 8 of 20  Version:  AMENDMENT 1     Date: March  21, 2016 8.3 Secondary effectiveness analysis 
No secondary effectiveness data will be collected for this study.  
8.4 Analysis of follow-up data  
The following follow -up data will be summarized descriptively for 30- day (±7 days) and 60- day (±14 
days) visits:  
• Re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426736];  
• CSF leak or pseudomeningocele determination data; 
• Surgical site assessment data;  
• Wound healing assessment data;  
• Presence of clinically significant changes to subject since previous study visit (for 30 -day only); 
• Laboratory data (complete blood count with differential, liver function tests and electrolytes) (for 
30-day only). 
 
8.5 Statistical/analytical issues  
8.5.1 Handling of dropouts or missing data 
The analysis for the ITT set will be performed considering missing data as failures; in addition, 
sensitivity analyses for the ITT set will be performed considering missing data as successes, and, as 
worst -case, with missing data f or the EVICEL® group considered as failures and missing data for the 
DuraSeal™ group considered as successes.  
If there are incomplete dates and calculations (e.g. time since procedure) are needed, the following rules 
are used (no rules will  be applied for missing years; t his data would normally be expected to be queried): 
• Missing date which includes the procedure data: the rules below are followed unless the derived 
date is pre-procedure, when the derived date will be 1 day after the procedure. 
• Missing day:  15th used  
8.5.2 Interim analyses and data monitoring 
No interim analysis will be performed for this study. 
8.5.3 Multiple comparison / multiplicity  
Not applicable.

 Page 19 of 20  Version:  AMENDMENT 1     Date: March  21, 2016 APPENDIX 2: CDC/NHSN CRITERIA FOR DEFINING A SURGICAL SITE I NFECTION (SSI)  
 
Superficial Incisional SSI  
Infections occur within [ADDRESS_539369] one of the following: 
1. Purulent drainage, with or without laboratory confirmation, from the superficial incision. 
2. Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture or fluid or tissue from the superficial 
incision. 
3. At least one of the following signs or symptoms of infection: pain or tenderness, localized 
swelling, redness, or heat and superficial incision is deliberately open by [CONTACT_7995], unless  incision 
is culture -negative.  
4. Diagnosis of superficial incisional SSI by [CONTACT_24699]. 
Do not report the following conditions as SSI: 
1. Stitch abscess (minimal inflammation and discharge confined to the points of suture penetration. 
2. Infection of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_426739]. 
3. Infected burn wound. 
4. Incisional SS I that extends into the fascial and muscle layers (see deep incisional SSI).  
Note:  Specific criteria are used for identifying infected epi[INVESTIGATOR_426740].  
Deep Incisional SSI  
Infections occurs within [ADDRESS_539370] and the infection appears to be related to the operation and infection involves deep 
soft tissues (e.g., fascial and muscles layers) of the incision and at least one of the following: 
1. Purulent drainage from the deep incision but not from the organ/space component of the surgical 
site. 
2. A deep incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened by a surgeon when the patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38°C), localized pain, or tenderness, unless site is culture- negative.  
3. An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision is found on direct examination, during reoperation, or by [CONTACT_80603]. 
4. Diagnosis of a deep incisional SSI by a surgeon or attending physician. 
Notes:  
1. Report infection that involves both superficial and deep incisional sites as deep incisional SSI.  
2. Report organ/space SSI that drains through the incision as a deep incisional SSI. 
 
Organ/ space SSI  
Infections occurs within [ADDRESS_539371] and the infection appears to be related to the operation and infection involves any part 
of the anatomy (e.g., organs or s paces) other than the incision, which was opened or manipulated during 
an operation and at least one of the following:  
1. Purulent drainage from a drain that is placed through a stab wound into the organ space. 
2. Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue in the organ/space. 
3. An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the organ/space that is found on direct examination, during reoperation, or by [CONTACT_426748]. 
4. Diagnosis of an organ/space SSI by a surgeon or attending physician.

SSI SURGICAL WOUND C LASSIFICATION  
 
CLASS I/CLEAN:  
An uninfected operative wound in which no inflammation is encountered and the respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], alimentary, 
genital and urinary tracts are not entered.  Clean wounds are primarily closed and, if necessary, drained 
with closed drainage. Operative incisional wounds that follow non- penetrating (blunt) trauma should be 
included in this category if they meet th ese criteria.  
 CLASS II/CLEAN- CONTAMINATED:  
An operative wound in which the respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], alimentary, genital and urinary tract is entered under controlled conditions and without unusual contamination.  Specifically, operations involving the biliary tract, appendix, vagina, and oropharynx are included in this category, provided no evidence of infection 
or major break in technique is encountered. 
 
CLASS III/CONTAMINATED:  
Open, fresh, accidental wounds, operations with major breaks in sterile technique or gros s spi[INVESTIGATOR_222631], and incisions in which acute, nonpurulent inflammation is encountered. 
 
CLASS IV/DIRTY OR INFECTED:  
Old traumatic wounds with retained devitalized tissue and those that involve exi sting clinical infection or 
perforated viscera. This definition suggests that the organisms causing postoperative infection were 
present in the operative field before the operation.

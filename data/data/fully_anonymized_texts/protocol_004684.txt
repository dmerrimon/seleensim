RESEARCH PLAN  
 
A. Specific Aims  
 
Aim [ADDRESS_486699]/analyze a 
series of structured, open -ended interviews  with interdisciplinary T1D experts and 
adolescents with T1D to make adaptations to content/delivery (telehealth) of a 
BREATHE mindfulness group and HealthEd comparison group for adolescents with 
T1D. Our expected outcomes will be a mindfulness -based group program addressing 
negative affectivity and a didactic HealthEd control group, with teen workbooks and 
intervention manuals adapted specifically for youth with T1D.  
Aim 2 . Evaluate feasibility/acceptability of BREATHE -T1D and HealthEd -T1D. Our 
hypothesis is that we will be able to recruit participants, as measured by [CONTACT_388198], enrollment, and dropouts, to a 2-way pi[INVESTIGATOR_388172] -T1D telehealth, or HealthEd -T1D. We will assess post -
intervention follow -up rates by [CONTACT_3004]. We anticipate that both conditions will be 
acceptable, with surveys indicating high satisfaction and qualitative structured 
interviews informing final ref inements. We hypothesize BREATHE -T1D telehealth will 
evidence the highest participation ( >80%), with both conditions achieving >65% 
 
 
 Page [ADDRESS_486700] be followed including multiple blood glucose checks, insulin injections, 
monitoring food choices and physical activity, maintaining snack av ailability for 
hypoglycemia,  restocking medical supplies, and management of acute complications 
(ADA, 2011).   National studies demonstrate that only 32% of youth aged 13 -18 years 
and 18% of youth age 19 and older meet American Diabetes Association (ADA) targets 
for glycemic control, as compared to 56% of adults  2,3. Additionally, up to 1/3 of young 
adults experience diabetes -related acute and chronic complications.4 Thus, glycemic 
control significantly deteriorates across adolescence and continues into young 
adulthood.5. Adherence to diabetes prescribed regimen is critical in achieving glycemic 
control and reducing the risk of acute and long -term complications of diabetes 6. 
Psychological Well -being and T1D in Adolescents  
Although there are multiple reasons for the observed decline in T1D treatment adherence 
and glycemic control during adolescence, one significant and potentially modifiable risk 
factor is negative affectivity . As shown in Figure 1 , the conceptual model guiding the 
work is that the high -stress dietary regimen and disruption of physiological signals of 
hunger -satiety signals that are necessary burdens of T1D promote negative affectivity , 
including depression and anxiety symptoms.7 Negative affectivity, in turn, is known to 
promote stress -related behavior, including maladaptive eating behavior, which commonly 
occurs in an effort to cope with unpleasant emotions.7 Consequently, stress -related 
behavior leads to diminished 
treatment adherence 
and thereby, worsening 
of glycemic control.7 In 
support of this model, 
there is a well -
established association 
between T1D and 
increased risk for 
elevated depression 
and anxiety symptoms, 
with meta -analyses 
indicating that 40% of 
teens with T1D have 
elevated symptoms of depression or anxiety , as compared to 20% in community 
samples of adolescents without T1D.8,[ADDRESS_486701] treatment adherence and glycemic control through a 
variety of stress -related behavioral mechanisms ; yet, maladaptive eating behavior 
appears to be particularly salient for youth with T1D, given the hyper -focus on 
food/calories and disruption of hunger -satiety signals that are central features of this 
chronic illness.[ADDRESS_486702] -prandial insulin.11 
Intentional insulin omission leads to acute weight loss, whereas regular insulin 
administration promotes weight gain. Overweight (BMI 85th %ile for age/sex) and obesity 
(BMI 95th %ile for age/sex) are increasingly common in youth with T1D, with 25% having 
overweight and 7% obesity.12 Maladaptive eating behavior typi[INVESTIGATOR_388173] T1D, as well as those without T1D, and it is more common 
among adolescents with overweight/obesity.[ADDRESS_486703] very 
high rates of maladaptive eating relative to adolescents without T1D.13 Specifically, 20% 
of adolescents with T1D report clinically significant  maladaptive eating behavior, referring 
to symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder, and an additional ~25% 
report subthreshold  maladaptive eating, which is problematic but occurs less frequently 
and/or for a shorter duration than the diagnostic threshold.13,[ADDRESS_486704] -of-care T1D education . Drawing 
on a combination of clinical experience, our guiding theoretical model, and extant 
scientific data, we anticipate  that interventions should include: (i) explicit 
acknowledgement and acceptance of the burden of T1D, (ii) psychoeducation about 
negative affectivity during adolescence, (iii) provision of tools for self -monitoring and 
identification of unp leasant emotions, cognitions, and body sensations that commonly 
arise in adolescents with T1D, (iv) acceptance and tolerance of such unpleasant 
emotions, cognitions, and body sensations without acting rashly, and (v) copi[INVESTIGATOR_388174] T1D stress a nd its concomitant, negative affectivity, which provide adolescents 
with healthier alternatives to maladaptive eating and that are tailored for adolescents with 
T1D who are required to carefully manage food intake. As such, mindfulness -based 
intervention may be uniquely suited for the needs of adolescents with T1D . 
There has been r ising scientific and clinical interest in mindfulness -based interventions to 
decrease negative affectivity23,24 and improve physical health outcomes, including 
stronger treatment adherence and better chronic disease management.25-27 A principal 
goal of mindfulness -based interventions is increasing dispositional mindfulness, referring 
to the propensity to pay attention on purpose to one’s present -moment experiences with 
an attitude of non -judgment and equanimity.28 From the framework of Monitor and 
Acceptance Theory,29,30 mindfulness -based interventions are postulated to decrease 
negative affectivity and thereby, stress -related behavior through (i) increased attention to 
monitoring of present -moment experiences in combination with (ii) increased acceptance 
of experiences r egardless of their valence. These mechanisms have been supported in 
recent dismantling studies.29,31-33 We theorize that a mindfulness -based intervention will 
be particularly fitting for decreasing negative affectivity and decreasing stress -related 
behavior in adolescents with T1D. Enhanced monitoring and acceptance of thoughts, 
emotions, and body sensations as they unfold moment -to-moment is theorized to 
decrease negative affectivity through the therapeutic mechanisms of: (i) increased 
monitoring  of thoughts, emotions, and body sensations, (ii) increased acceptance  and 
equanimity with respect to thoughts, emotions, and body sensation, (iii) increased 
executive function , and (iv) decreased negative urgency  (Figure 2 ).[ADDRESS_486705] from 
emotional and physical cues that prompt responding on “auto -

based interventions in adults or emerging adults with  
diabetes, typi[INVESTIGATOR_388175] T1D 
and type 2 diabetes (T2D).  These studies have shown 
moderate effects of mindfulness interventions for decreasing 
depression and anxiety symptoms, relative to waitlist, 
diabetes education, and treatment -as-usual controls, from 
post-treatment to [ADDRESS_486707] studies 
support the efficacy of mindfulness interventions for lowering depression/anxiety in 
diverse samples of adolescents without  T1D, with moderate effects compared to attention 
controls.[ADDRESS_486708] found that mindfulness interventions decrease 
maladaptive eating in teens ( without  T1D) who are at risk for weight -related disorders and 
adverse metabolic health, as well as among adults with overweight/obesity.38,40,49-[ADDRESS_486709] considerations in adolescents with T1D  for adapting 
mindfulness -based training to address negative affectivity and stress -related behavior 
particularly maladaptive eating, in this population: (i) adolescents with T1D face 
potentially unpleasant physical and emotional sensations unique to T1D (e.g., 
hypoglycemia); (ii) T1D treatment adherence necessitates a heightened focus on eating 
and nutrition; (iii) T1D treatment adherence requires an overriding of physiological cues 
for hunger -satiety; (iv) T1D treatment adherence often  results in higher body weight with 
appropriate insulin administration; and (v) many families have lengthy travel to receive 
specialty healthcare, suggesting novel delivery formats such as telehealth should be 
considered for feasibility, acceptability, and  sustainability.

knowledge control group (HealthEd -T1D) adapted for youth with T1D, in order to directly 
prepare for a future efficacy trial that can test the ef ficacy of a mindfulness -based group -
based intervention on negative affectivity, stress -related behavior, treatment adherence, 
and glycemic control.  
 
C. Preliminary Studies  
 
Negative affect/maladpative eating in  adolescents with T1D at Children’s National . 
Drs. Mackey (PI) and Streisand (Co -I) enrolled N=100 youth with T1D, 11 -17y ( Mean 
age=14y), in an observational, longitudinal study. The recruitment rate was 59% of eligible 
teens approached in clinic.  Thus, our investigative team is well-positioned to access 
the target population . In preliminary analyses of this cohort, we were able to 
characterize rates of negative affectivity ( Figure 
3), maladaptive eating, and suboptimal 
glycemic control. Consistent with estimates 
from other cohorts of adolescents with T1D, a 
majority (61%) of adolescents receiving 
T1D care at Children’s National Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(Washington, DC) reported elevated 
symptoms of depression, anxiety, or both, 
and a considerable number (25%) repor t 
engaging in maladaptive eating behavior . 
Also consistent with national statistics, the 
vast majority (81%) of adolescents with 
T1D had poor glycemic control (A1c 
≥7.5%) . Figure 3. Rates of elevated depression, anxiety, 
and both types of negative affectivity

Elevated Negative Affectivity
or Anxiety + Anxiety
 
 
 Page 7 of 30 
 
 Further, preliminary analyses provide support for our conceptual model. U sing path 
analysis, we found that negative affectivity, as reported by [CONTACT_333007] T1D and their 
parents, predicted poorer self -care and higher A1c (worse glycemic control) 3 months 
later ( Figure 4 ). In clinically meaningful terms, T1D teens with elevated depression and/or 
anxiety had a nearly 1% higher A1c at 3 -month follow -up, controlling for baseline A1c, 
than those with no or low negative affectivity  ( Mean  A1c 9.7% vs. 8.9%, p=.07). T he 
effect of negative affectivity was partially explained by [CONTACT_388199]. Moreover, the 
connections of negative 
affectivity with maladaptive 
eating and self -care were 
moderated by [CONTACT_388200]. Adolescents with 
T1D were most likely to 
report engaging in 
maladaptive eating 
behavior and poorer self -
care in response to negative 
affectivity when they also 
were higher in negative 
urgency. These data 
contribute to the 
overarching hypothesis 
for the current work: mindfulness -based inter vention may be highly suitable for 
adolescents with T1D because its therapeutic targets include provision of copi[INVESTIGATOR_388178], increasing 
executive function, and decreasing negative urgency .38,40,48-51,56  
Intervention development in T1D . Drs. Mackey (PI) and Streisand (Co -I) recently 
completed an NIH -funded intervention development grant ( DP3DK103998) to promote 
healthy eating and physical activity, in order to improve glycemic control in young children 
with T1D. This project employed the ORBIT model to [create a brand -new intervention 
from the ground up] .57 Interviews were initially conducted with 4 parents in the target 
population (parents of children ages 2 -5y with T1D). Interviews used a semi -structured 
format with questions about adjustment to diagnosis, regimen, and areas of difficulty and 
strengths, wi th specific probes for eating behavior and physical activity. A stakeholder 
advisory board, including parents, professional experts in T1D care, and research 
consultants, was created. Once the initial program content was created, the research 
team contract ed with a graphic designer to create a logo and visually appealing materials. 
The stakeholder advisory board was consulted for ongoing refinement and was sent 
drafts of the materials for review and feedback. Next, we carried out a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] 
(N=10) to examine feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, approach, and 
assessment protocol. Minor adjustments were made and then a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265] ( N=36) 
was conducted to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of the intervention as compared to 
usual care. Results indicated feasibility of recruitment in that 68% of contact[CONTACT_388201], feasibility of retention with 97% r etained through 6 -
Figure 4. Path analysis of observational data shows negative affectivity, 
combined with negative urgency, relates to poorer T1D self -care and 
higher A1c at 3 -month follow -up, partially through greater maladaptive 
eating; model/all paths p<.05, controlling for age, s ex, race/ethnicity, and 
socioeconomic status

 month follow -up, and high acceptability/satisfaction, as 100% perceived the program had 
a positive impact on their child’s T1D management and 84% would recommend the 
program to other parents and were glad that they participated. These data indicate the 
unique expertise of the study team to systematically develop T1D behavioral 
interventions that are feasible and acceptable using a similar framework proposed 
in the current study . 
 
D. Research Design and Methods  
 
Overview . The proposed approach is consistent with the ORBIT model of progressive behavioral 
intervention development.[ADDRESS_486712] adapt content/delivery format of an

 utilize a rigorous, multistep, iterative process58 to systematically assess, code, and integrate in -
depth, qualitative feedback  from T1D experts and teens with T1D on the curricula.  In Phase 2 
“Set up Pi[INVESTIGATOR_388180] ,” we will finalize the  BREATHE -T1D and HealthEd -T1D 
manuals/ workbooks, consult with a telemedicine expert to establish standard operating 
procedures for telehealth delivery of BREATHE -T1D, finalize recruitment materials, and establish 
assessment standard operating procedures. In Phase 3 “Carry out Pi[INVESTIGATOR_388180] ,” 
we will carry out a 2-way pi[INVESTIGATOR_187192] N=40 adolescents, 12 -17y, with >1-year durati on of T1D, 
randomized to BREATHE -T1D deli vered via telehealth, or HealthEd -T1D. We will track all 
elements of study flow and carry out a mixed -methods evaluation of feasibility  and acceptability. 
In Phase 4 “Plan Next Steps ,” we will make final refinements to  BREATHE -T1D and HealthEd -
T1D and study protocols based upon Phase 3 results, disseminate results, and prepare a grant 
application that directly builds upon the R34 findings. Specific elements of each phase are 
described  below:  
1. Phase 1: Adapt  BREATHE and HealthEd : Phase 1 will focus on [initial] tailoring of 
BREATHE for adolescents with T1D. This phase will include a rigorous qualitative data 
collection and coding/analysis approach to intervention adaptation58 using the inputs of 
interdisciplinary T1D healthcare/provider experts and adolescent patients with T1D to adapt 
and refine BREATHE -T1D. Also, we will use experts’ and patients’ inputs to adapt a credible 
and feasible HealthEd comparison group adapted for adolescents with T1D. The foundation 
for these adaptations will be our existing, manualized BREATHE and HealthEd group 
programs:  
a) Learning to BREATHE : Learning to BREATHE  is a mindfulness -based  group program 
derived from mindfulness -based stress reduction28 and adapted for adolescents by 
[CONTACT_388202].59 Each letter in BREATHE acronym corresponds to a theme: B: Body, R: Reflections, 
E: Emotions, A: Attention, T: Tenderness, H: Habits (of Healthy Living), for overall goal of E: 
Empowerment. Example activities include breath awareness, body scanning, mindful eating, 
sitting meditation, loving -kindness practice, and gentle yoga. The original , published  
curriculum was designed to offer high flexibility in delivery timing and selection of exercises.59 
We previously developed a manualized version of BREATHE for consistency in timing and 
content,48,53 but minimally modified content from its original format. Brief homework (~10 
minutes/day), including formal (e.g., meditation audio -recordings) and informal practices (e.g., 
personalizing mindfulness in daily living), is assigned weekly. Teens  are given digital 
meditation audio -recordings, a yoga mat, meditation cushion, homework log, and worksheets.  
Although BREATHE has not been delivered to adolescents with T1D, previous studies show 
it is well -liked by [CONTACT_388203]/ethnically diverse teens , including in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_388181]-risk for weight -related disorders.48,53 Speaking to its potential 
application for adolescents with T1D, data from our group and others show that BREATHE 
decreases depression symptoms and ameliorates insulin resistance up to 1 -year later in pi[INVESTIGATOR_106389] .48,53,60-63 
b) HealthEd : The HealthEd curriculum will be derived primarily from a didactic manual that [CONTACT_388221] (Co -I) and colleagues developed as an educational control condition for delivery to 
adolescents with T1D ( 1R01DK121316 -01; PI [INVESTIGATOR_388182]). This manualized program provides 
basic education on T1D that would be included as part of standard -of-care, including didactics 
on insulin administration, managing and prevention hypo/hyperglycemia, managing T1D at 
school, considerations for travel, and driving with T1D. The program requires adaptation for 
group delivery, and in doing so, we will draw on the delivery format of a HealthEd didactic 
group program, HeyDurham,[ADDRESS_486716].  
c) Qualitative design/analytic plan for intervention adaptation : Trained interviewers will 
conduct structured, open -ended interviews with N=10 stakeholders, including n=3 
interdisciplinary T1D healthcare experts , n=[ADDRESS_486717]  adolescents with T1D,  and n=[ADDRESS_486718] to adapt BREATHE and HealthEd for specific delivery to adolescents with T1D. 
We will use a rigorous, multistep, iterative process, delineated by [CONTACT_17487]. ,58 for adapting 
BREATHE for the new target population and a n interpretive description methodological 
framework will be used for analyses of qualitative data.65 Participants will be purposefully 
sampled to ensure that diverse demographics are included in both stakeholder interviewees 
(e.g., discipline/area of T1D expertise) and adolescents (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, insulin 
regimen). The first step will include interviews with healthcare experts to guide the initial 
adaptations to the manuals. Interview guides with healthcare experts  will be designed to elicit 
a comprehensive understanding of providers’ subjective experiences of adolescent T1D 
patient challenges with negative emotions, barriers and facili tators of T1D self -management, 
problematic eating behaviors observed in clinical care, and barriers and facilitators to using 
telehealth as a delivery method of clinical care in this population. We will then ask clinicians 
to review the BREATHE and HealthEd  base programs and provide specific feedback and 
commentary regarding patient ne eds and face evaluation of the potential usefulness of the 
new programs.  
In parallel, we will create and adapt interview guides with teens with T1D . These will be 
designed to elicit a comprehensive understanding of teens’ subjective experiences of negative 
emotions related to T1D and other key life domains, current copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], unhealthy 
eating patterns/weight -control attempts, barriers and ena blers to T1D treatment adherence 
and self -care, and desired support. As with clinicians, teens will be asked to comment on the 
base programs of BREATHE content/format/delivery mode a nd content/format of HealthEd. 
Three teens with T1D will complete interviews and review the base programs. Based on the 
feedback from healthcare experts and initial group of [ADDRESS_486719] of expert 
BREATHE intervention delivery ( i.e., the discussion that is facilitated after experiential 
activities). For example, it may be critical to directly address awareness of physical sensations 
that adole scents with T1D may encounter when experiencing hypo/hyperglycemia or adapt 
the mindful eating exercise to reflect that hunger may not be the reason a teen with T1D is 
required to eat.  As with our previous studies,[ADDRESS_486720] found that acceptability is increased 
when intervention materials are presented in an appealing and professional manner. 
Participant workbooks will be designed by a graphic design service to enhance appeal.  
2. Phase 2: Set up Pi[INVESTIGATOR_388180] : The protocol will be submitted to the IRB for 
approval prior to data collection. Data collection procedures will be finalized with input from 
the expert panel and adolescents with T1D to ensure that measures capture essential factors 
and are feasible to administer and complete.  
 
 
 Page 11 of 30 
 
 a) BREATHE delivery mode : We will create 1 adaptation of BREATHE -T1D. The format will be 
BREATHE -T1D telehealth. This approach will use a telehealth delivery platform, Zoom, 
currently in use by [CONTACT_388204] a variety of 
behavioral/medical treatments . Zoom allows for groups to occur via video so that each 
member can see the others, mimicking the experience of an in -person group. We anticipate 
that BREATHE -T1D manual/teen workbook will require minimal -to-no modifications in order 
to deliver the program via Zoom.  
b) Finalize standard  operating  procedures : Written standard operating procedures, with 
accompanying checklists, will be finalized for all aspects of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265]. An amendment will 
be submitted to the IRB, as needed, based upon protocol revisions and adaptations for 
BREATHE -T1D telehealth and Heal thEd-T1D. All research staff will be trained in protocol s, 
complete/update CITI trainings in responsible conduct of research, and prepare/test  REDCap 
databases  for surveys and data management .  
c) Train interventionists : Interventionist s will be master’s  or doctoral  level clinicians who have 
experience working with teens with T1D. Interventionists w ill participate in a comprehensive 
3-day training to learn  BREATHE -T1D and HealthEd -T1D. Training will be  led by [CONTACT_6283]. Mackey 
(PI), Streisand (Co-I), and Shomaker (Co -I). Drs. Mackey and Streisand have  expertise in 
behavioral T1D interventions. [CONTACT_388222] has expertise in BREATHE  delivery and 
training/supervision . Training  will be conducted virtually , and it will include presentations of 
theoretical/empi[INVESTIGATOR_388183], r eview of BREATHE -T1D and HealthEd -T1D intervention 
manuals /teen workbooks , modeling of session elements, and role -play using mock -groups.  
Telehealth protocols and delivery methods will be practiced.  
3. Phase 3: Carry out Pi[INVESTIGATOR_388180] :  
a) Participants : We will recruit a total N=40 participants for n=20 in each arm of the intervention  
from the ~700 adolescents seen through the CNH T1D clinic annually].  Participants will be  
included on the basis of the following criteria: (i) age 12 -17y, (ii) T1D, with at least 1-year 
duration of illness, (iii) negative affectivity, defined as clinically elevated scores (T-score [ADDRESS_486721] mild depression/anxiety symptoms on either the PROMIS short form -
depression and/or anxiety scales), similar to criteria used in our previous studies in this patient 
population,67 and recommended for use in clinic screening procedures in youth with T1D,68] 
(iv) English -speaking , (v) no cognitive  or developmental delays which would interfere with their 
ability to participate in the study , and (vi) have no  other serious medical conditions (e.g., cystic 
fibrosis, cancer). Participants with Spanish -speaking parent will not be excluded; consent and 
parent surveys will be translated into Spanish and an interpreter will be utilized for delivery of 
consent. Participants will not be excluded based upon insulin regimen  or method of measuring 
blood glucose . Participants will not be excluded based on receiving outside psychological 
support, but treatment outside of the study will be carefully tracked and controlled fo r in 
analyses.  
b) Recruitment : Participants will be recruited using  a variety of approaches  that have been 
highly successful in previous studies conducted by [CONTACT_6283]. Mackey (PI) and Streisand (Co -I) in 
youth with T1D . Success of these approaches for the particular pi[INVESTIGATOR_4258] t racked to 
inform a future efficacy trial. Strategies will include: (i) direct mailings, emails,  and phone call s 
to participants who, based upon an electronic medical record review, appear to be eligible, 
based upon age, health status/diagnoses, and (ii) in -person approach of teens and parents at 
T1D clinic appointments who are in the target age range. Potentially interested participants 
will be screened  for depression  and anxiety  and will be invited to enroll if they meet the 
criterion for elevated (T -score 55) depression and/or anxiety.  Although recruitment feasibility

 recruitment/retention for clinical trials in youth with T1D, with a recruitment rate of 71% in a 
prior trial targeting an adolescent T1D population.69  
c) Baseline assessment : Following the pre -screen, participants who are interested and eligible 
will be met at the clinic most convenient for them. The endocrinology division at CNH sees 
patients across [ADDRESS_486722] found in previous studies results in strong 
retention and participation rates. They will receive a $[ADDRESS_486723]  for completion of this 
assessment and study -specific retention items (e.g., study logo water  bottle).  
d) Group participation : A computerized randomization sequence will be created by [CONTACT_388205] . After completion of baseline assessments, a llocation 
will be performed by [CONTACT_388206], which conceals the sequence. 
Teens  will be randomized to BREATHE -T1D telehealth or HealthEd -T1D. As shown in Table 
1, we will aim for n=5 youth /group  and i nterventions will be run in parallel . If scheduling is 
difficult, we will recruit up to [ADDRESS_486724] in cohorts 1 and 2. Based upon our base BREATHE and HealthEd manuals, 
we anticipate that g roup duration will be ~6 consecutive weeks, 1 -hour/week during non -
school hours, with potential for duration/frequency modifications  based on the adaptation 
phase.

Data Analysis  
Statistical Design and 
Power  
Overview :  
The first aim of the study 
is to carry out a series of 
iterative structured, 
open -ended interviews 
with key stakeholders in 
order to adapt an 
evidence -based, mindfulness group intervention, Learning to BREATHE, to be tailored to 
the distinctive needs of adolescents with type 1 diabetes (BREATHE -T1D). We also will 
adapt a didactic T1D health education program for delivery as a group -based control  
program matched for time and attention (HealthEd -T1D). The second aim is to assess 
the feasibility and acceptabil ity of 2 adolescent group -based conditions: 1) BREATHE -
T1D, delivered via telehealth, and 2) HealthEd -T1D, delivered via telehealth. We will 
determine the feasibility and acceptability of recruitment, assessment, retention, and each 
group condition . Together, these data will be essential for informing the final interventions, 
protocols, and design of a future efficacy trial of BREATHE -T1D for adolescents with T1D. 
The qualitative portions add patient voice to intervention adaptation and optimization, 
ensuri ng that the interventions to be tested and the outcomes to be measured as part of 
a larger efficacy trial will be meaningful, valuable, and helpful for adolescents.75 
Consistent with NCCIH’s policy for the conduct of pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], no preliminary analyses 
of efficacy are planned; yet, the study does include pi[INVESTIGATOR_388185], 
outcomes, and hypothesized mechanisms of the mindfulness -based intervention, 
BREATHE -T1D, in order to determine if measure administration is feasible and 
acceptable to adolescents with T1D for use in a future efficacy trial.  
Aim 1 : 
Qualitative design/analytic plan for intervention adaptation . Structured, open -ended 
interviews will be conducted with a total of N=10 stakeholders, including n=3 
interdisciplinary T1D healthcare experts and n=7 adolescents with T1D in order to adapt 
BREATHE and HealthEd for specific delivery to adolescents with T1D. Using interpretive 
description methods,65 participants will be purposefully sampled to ensure that diverse 
demographics are included in both stakeholder interviewees (e.g., discipline/area of 
expertise) and adolescent participants (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, insulin regimen, 
glycemic control ). Trained research staff will conduct interviews using an interview guide. 
Interview guides will be developed by [CONTACT_20685], which now includes an Assessment

 Page [ADDRESS_486732]. Katherine Kelly 
(Co-I), who has successfully collaborated with Co -I [CONTACT_388223] on previous 
mixed -methods studies in pediatric T1D.[ADDRESS_486733] step in this process will include interviews with healthcare experts to guide the 
initial adaptations to the manuals. Interview guides with healthcare experts  will be 
designed to elicit a comprehensive understanding of providers’ subjective experiences of 
adolescent T1D patient challenges with negative emotions, barriers and enablers to T1D 
treatment adherence and self -care, problematic eating behaviors observe d in clinical care 
experience, and barriers and enablers to using in person healthcare a nd telehealth as a 
delivery method of clinical care in this population. We will then ask clinicians to review the 
BREATHE and HealthEd base programs and provide specific feedback and commentary 
regarding patient needs and face evaluation of the potential u sefulness of the new 
programs based on their clinical experience with adolescents with T1D. We will query 
T1D healthcare experts about intervention formatting and design; ask them to highlight 
sections that they particularly liked; ask them to highlight se ctions that they particularly 
did not like, thought were unclear, or thought could be improved; and query as to whether 
providers perceive that any important content is missing.  
The second step that will happen in parallel with the provider interviews is that we will be 
creating and adapting interview guides with adolescents with T1D. These guides will be 
designed to elicit a comprehensive understanding of adolescents’ subjective experiences 
of negative emotions related to T1D and other key life domains, current copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], 
unhealthy eating patterns/weight -control attempts, barriers and enabl ers to T1D 
treatment adherence and self -care, and desired support. As with clinicians, teens also will 
be asked to comment on the base programs of BREATHE content/format/delivery mode 
and content/format of HealthEd. We will initially have n=[ADDRESS_486734], based on the feedback from the 3 healthcare experts and the initial group of 3 teens 
with T1D, we will make specific adaptations to the BREATHE and HealthEd programs 
and any changes, as indicated, to the interview guide for teenagers to elicit more 
information on emergent themes and/or to fill in more depth/detail about particular topic 
areas. Following revisions to the teen interview guides, we will conduct interviews and 
ask for comments on the first draft of the BREATHE -T1D and HealthED -T1D progra ms 
with n=[ADDRESS_486735] review and comment.  
All interviews will be audio -recorded; interviewers also will take extensive field notes. 
Interviews will be transcribed verbatim for qualitative analyses using Atlas.ti. [CONTACT_388224] 
(Co-I; qualitative expert) will initially code n=3 healthcare expert and n=[ADDRESS_486736] efficiency in 
completing qualitative analyses/coding, [CONTACT_388224] will complete analysis of these initial 
 
 
 Page [ADDRESS_486737] and efficient analysis. This 
qualitative analytic approach, in combination with regular, planned communication and 
discussion among the investigative team about interviews/analyses, will ensure that we 
derive the richest information from stakeholder interviews in order to adapt BREATHE -
T1D and HealthEd -T1D.58  See figure below for illustration of full process.  
How Aim 1 qualitative data/analysis will inform the adaptation of BREATHE . Qualitative 
data/analysis will provide critical information on the specific mindfulness -based skills and 
contextual factors that will be most important for mindfulness -based training in 
adolescents with T1D. Qualitative data collection/analysis is ideall y suited for intervention 
adaptation because it allows for both confirmation of anticipated changes to intervention 
content that will be necessary (e.g., matching themes with existing  BREATHE content) 
as well as emergent or unanticipated information to optimize an intervention for the target 
population through additional changes to content or creation of new content. Based on 
our previous experience, we anticipate that specific changes  will be needed regarding 
intervention content, examples that are provided in experiential activities (e.g., case study 
in module on stress and attention, or ways we practice kindness or meanness to 
ourselves), and specific discussion of areas of stress/co ncern for adolescents with T1D, 
which are an essential aspect of expert BREATHE intervention delivery (i.e., the 
discussion that is facilitated after experiential activities). For example, it may be critical to 
directly address awareness of physical sensat ions that adolescents with T1D may 
encounter when experiencing symptoms of hypo/hyperglycemia, adapt the mindful eating 
exercise to reflect that hunger may not be the reason a teen with T1D is required to eat, 
or other unique experiences teens with T1D not e that will be important to modify or use 
to highlight specific aspects of the BREATHE curriculum.  
Sample size justification . Based upon our past experience76 and recommended 
guidelines,77 a total sample size of N=10 total stakeholders is anticipated to achieve 
informational redundancy.

g) Feasibility : The primary focus of the feasibility assessment will be to demonstrate 
that a recruitment, participation, and retention can meet pre -defined targets. To 
evaluate feasibility, a CONSORT table and descriptive statistics regarding 
recruitment, retention, da ta completeness, and fidelity will be generated by 
[CONTACT_65237]. Feasibility will be determined overall by [CONTACT_388214]. Retention, participation, 
and fidelity by [CONTACT_388215] d for meeting feasibility criteria (>80% retention, 
>80% sessions attended, >80% of homework completed, 80% fidelity of intervention 
delivery). Feasibility indicators also will be evaluated for differences between group 
conditions in order to determine if one program is more feasible. For participants lost 
to attrition in each cohort, baseline characteristics and research coordinator feedback 
will be evaluated to determine how recruitment rates may be improved.  
h) Acceptability : To evaluate acceptability quantitatively, descriptive data will be 
generated of post -intervention satisfaction surveys overall and by [CONTACT_388216]. 
Acceptability will be determined by a high level of satisfaction with participation, 
perceived utility of  the intervention content, and perceived benefit from participation 
(>80% reporting that they were satisfied and perceived utility and benefit). 
Acceptability indicators will also be evaluated for differences between group 
conditions in orde r to determine if one is more acceptable.  
Qualitative acceptability strand . At post -intervention, all adolescents will complete an 
open -ended, structured interview to query about their subjective experiences of the 
intervention content, relationships with facilitators/other group members, home 
practice completion, and enablers a nd barriers of making changes in copi[INVESTIGATOR_388186], eating behaviors, and T1D treatment adherence. After coding 
n=3 BREATHE -T1D, telehealth interviews, and n=[ADDRESS_486739]. Kelly will oversee coding through regular 
audits. To assure rich and m eaningful information, we will make iterative adjustments 
to interview guides as needed and maintain regular communication and systematic

 discussion among interviewers, data analysts, the qualitative expert (Kelly), and 
experts in adolescents with T1D and behavioral interventions (Mackey & Streisand), 
eating (Mackey & Shomaker) and BREATHE (Shomaker).  
Based on the feedback received in cohort s 1 and 2 , additional modifications will be 
made to BREATHE -T1D and HealthEd -T1D as indicated for cohort s 2 and 3 . 
Specifically,  to carry out these additional, iterative adaptations to the interventions, 
after each set of n=5 interviews, qualitative findings will be reviewed by [CONTACT_388217], minor adjustments or tweaks to the BREATHE and/or 
HealthEd modules for the subsequent cohort(s).

i) Measurement : Descriptive statistics using the measurements of hypothesized 
outcome and mechanism indicators will be used to look at variability in responses for 
each measure for utility of use in future trials (e.g., is there sufficient variability across 
participant s to make it a worthwhile indicator of the proposed construct, do the 
measures correlate with one another in expected directions). Our primary pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (and 
subsequent full -scale trial) assessments of improvement in measures will be a set of 
planned contrast comparisons using independent samples group t -tests with further 
validation using the non -parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test. These are:  
i) Comparison of the n=20 active treatment participants in BREATHE -T1D telehealth 
delivery to the n=20 HealthEd -T1D control arm participants on measures of 
feasibility (e.g., recruitment, dropout, data missingness, fidelity) and acceptability 
(e.g., satisfaction ratings) to determine if there are differences in feasibility or 
acceptability between BREATHE -T1D versus HeatlhEd -T1D.  
Sample size justification . For studies that can be considered both feasibility and pi[INVESTIGATOR_388188]. There are a range of thoughts 
on sample sizes needed to assess feasibility.78 Julious et al.79 recommend n=12 per 
group as a rule of thumb and justify this recommendation based upon rationale about 
feasibility and precision about the mean and variance. A paper provided by [CONTACT_388218]80 recommends a total pi[INVESTIGATOR_388189] 
N=30 and N=50. We also assessed the 80% completion rule (which is used for several 
of our feasibility outcomes). If we assume a chance response of 50% program completion, 
with a sample size of 15 (at alpha = 0.05 and 80% power), we can detect a difference of 
80% com pletion or more. Therefore, we believe the proposed study will be powered to 
assess feasibility overall and by [CONTACT_388216].

 Concerning the sample size assessment for pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], we reference Cocks and 
Torgerson81  who recommend using a total sample size of N=[ADDRESS_486740] size of 0.25 or greater between 2 group conditions planned in the larger 
trial following the pi[INVESTIGATOR_388190] a total sample size of N=[ADDRESS_486741] size of 0.31 or greater between 2 group arms in the larger trial following the pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480]. Based upon our review of similar studies assessing glycemic control82 and 
mindfulness -based intervention measures,34 we believe these effects size are reasonable 
for our 3 planned 2 -group comparisons regarding our primary aims of evaluating feasibility 
and acceptability.  
E. Study Population:  
 
There will be 90 total participants across both phases of study (3 diabetes team providers, 
7 adolescents with T1D for the intervention development qualitative feedback, and 4 0 
adolescent and caregiver dyads for the feasibility trial).  Diabetes team providers ( n=3) 
will be interviewed to provide feedback regarding the adaptation of BREATHE for use 
with adolescents with T1D. We will recruit a total N=4 0 participants for n= 20 in each arm 
of the intervention. Participants will be included on the basis of the following criter ia: (i) 
age 12 -17y, (ii) T1D, with at least 1 -year duration of illness, (iii) negative affectivity, 
defined as clinically elevated scores (T -score >[ADDRESS_486742] mild 
depression/anxiety symptoms on either the PROMIS short form -depression and/or 
anxiety scales ) (iv) A1c >7.5%, (v) English -speaking, (vi) no cognitive or developmental 
delays which would interfere with their ability to participate in the study, (vii) are able and 
willing to complete questionnaires and intervention via the internet, (vi ii) do not have 
severe depression or active or recent (within the past two months) suicidal ideation and 
(viv) have no other serious medical conditions (e.g., cystic fibrosis, cancer). Participants 
with Spanish -speaking parent will not be excluded; consent and parent surveys will be 
translated into Spanish and an interpreter will be utilized for delivery of consent. 
Participants  will not be excluded based upon insulin regimen or method of measuring 
blood glucose. Participants will not be excluded based on r eceiving psychological support  
outside of the context of the study , but treatment outside of the study will be carefully 
tracked and controlled for in analyses.  The study will be nonselective in its recruitment 
and enrollment with respect to gender, r ace, and ethnicity.   
  
F. Human Subjects  
 
Adolescents  and a primary caregiver will be recruited from the Child and Adol escent 
Diabetes Program at CNMC . Adolescents between the ages of [ADDRESS_486743] been highly 
successful in previous studies conducted by [CONTACT_6283]. Mackey (PI) and Streisand (Co -I) in 
youth with T1D. Success of these approaches for the particular pi[INVESTIGATOR_388191] a future efficacy trial. Strategies will include: (i) direct mailings, emails, and 
phone calls to participants who, based upon an electronic medical record review,  appear 
 
 
 Page 21 of 30 
 
 to be eligible, based upon age, health status/diagnoses, A1c and (ii) in -person approach 
of teens and parents at T1D clinic appointments who are in the target age range. 
Potentially interested participants will be screened for depression and anxiety using the 
PROMIS scales and will be invited to enroll if they meet the criterion for elevated (T -score 
55) depression and/or anxiety.   
  
G. Risks and Side Effects:  
 
There are no known psychological risks to subjects when providing feedback via 
qualitative interview or when filling out standardized psychological questionnaires. 
However, the questionnaires may contain questions that make the subjects feel 
uncomfortable in that they ask about their physical and psychological health. Additionally, 
we will be recruiting participants with elevations on measures of depression and/or 
anxiety. For participants by [CONTACT_6270] -report responding that they are experiencing a clinically 
significant level of anxiety OR depressive s ymptoms (using the PROMIS short form – T 
> 55 cutoff for depression and for anxiety subscales), we will follow a protocol that has 
been effective in our prior studies. Additionally, adolescents report on disordered eating 
behaviors, including risky behavio rs such as insulin withholding. The DEPRS will be 
screened for clinical cutoff and specifically for endorsing either of the two items that ask 
about insulin withholding. Specifically, all forms will be reviewed by [CONTACT_388219] [ADDRESS_486744] in clinic 
or via zoom (and flagged if either the depression or anxiety scores are above the clinical 
cutoff (T -score > 55) or if the DEPRS is above the clinical cutoff AND/OR either of the 
insulin withholding items are endorsed). If the score is above the clinical cutoff or the 
insulin withholding items are endorsed, the study team will notify the family both that they 
are eligible for participation in the study, and also reminded of additional  referrals for care, 
including the in -house diabetes psychologist and other community referrals. The PROMIS 
measures do not assess for suicidal ideation, and we will not be assessing this specifically 
given that it is outside of the scope of this trial. Ho wever, if suicidal ideation or intent is 
suggested during the course of any study interactions, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Eleanor Mackey, a 
licensed child clinical/pediatric psychologist, will be informed immediately via cell phone, 
and outreach to the parent and teen wi ll be made. All research staff interacting with 
patients (e.g., research coordinator, research assistants) will be trained in our lab’s risk 
assessment procedures. If deemed necessary, the teen will be referred for immediate 
mental health evaluation at the  CNH Emergency Department. Our team of T1D 
psychologists maintains written protocols for all cases that necessitate a possible breach 
of confidentiality and for handling concerns that may arise such as suicidal ideation or 
self-harm. As we have done succes sfully in prior studies, we will monitor ongoing parent 
and teen reporting of the use of mental health support outside of the study either via usual 
care (e.g., seeing the in -clinic psychologist) or outside therapy/consultation or other 
behavioral health s ervices. Paralleling national trends, most teenagers with T1D, even 
when screened and referred, do not seek regular therapy due to a variety of barriers. 
Thus, the interventions being offered, including the control condition, will likely offer more 
support  and monitoring than adolescents would otherwise receive, even when they 
screen positively for depression/anxiety in diabetes clinic.

 The primary potential source of risk in this study is the risk of gathering sensitive social, 
behavioral, and medical information. Data collection via the Internet will be conducted 
through secure applications (REDCap). The respondent burden for completion  of 
questionnaires at each assessment point is approximately [ADDRESS_486745]. In all 
datasets we will use ID numbers only. A separate dataset linking names with ID numbers 
will be accessible only to authorized study personnel under the direction of the PI.  
 
 
H. Benefits:   
 
There are no known direct benefits to subjects to participating in this research. Those 
allocated to the BREATHE -T1D telehealth condition may gain skills in managing negative 
affect and ultimately improving diabetes management behaviors.

(ASD).  
2.0 BACKGROUND AND HYPOT HESIS  
2.1 AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER  
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heter ogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with onset 
early in life. It is characterized by [CONTACT_664985] a restricted range of activities.[ADDRESS_898221] of supporting an in dividual with ASD is estimated to be $1.[ADDRESS_898222] is $2.[ADDRESS_898223] identified several de novo mutations, 
copy number variants (CNV), and single -nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that are associated 
with an increased risk of ASD. However, it is estim ated the specific genetic cause can only be 
identified in less than 20% of cases, with the remaining causes likely being caused by [CONTACT_664986].[ADDRESS_898224] a 
role in the treatment of children with ASD.  
2.2 IMMUNE DYSREGULATION IN ASD  
A role of immune activation and/or dysregulation in the etiology of ASD is supported by 
[CONTACT_664987]. M ultiple epi[INVESTIGATOR_664953]. 
This association has been consistent across countries and time periods, having been 
reported as early as the 1970s a fter a rubella pandemic in the [LOCATION_002]6 and throughout 
the decades in Denmark ,[ADDRESS_898225]-MSC in Toddlers with ASD (TACT)

Potential pathophysiologic mechanisms include alterations in maternal -fetal immune tolerance 
(via maternal antibodies and/or cellular immunity) and fetal brain inflammation, which lead to 
changes in brain cytokine profiles and microglial activation that may be detrimental to 
neurodevelopment. Evidence of increased numbers of m icroglia and increased microglial 
activation in ASD has been obtained via autopsy studies, positron emission tomography (PET) 
brain imaging, and animal models. In addition, abnormal functioning in aspects of the immune 
system in the brain (such as microgli a that are tasked with providing support to neuronal 
synapses) has been described.10,[ADDRESS_898227] that both environmental and genetic risk 
factors may contribute to the development of AS D by [CONTACT_664989]/or abnormal neuronal connectivity that adversely affect normal brain development 
and cause core symptomatology observed in individuals with ASD.  
2.4 MESENCHYMAL STROMAL CELLS (MSCs)  
hCT-MSC is a third party, allogeneic, human mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) product 
manufactured from donated umbilical cord tissue, after written informed consent for donation 
and commercialization, harvested from discarded birthing tissues, that is digested, expanded 
for two passa ges in culture in xeno free media, harvested, cryopreserved, and stored in the 
vapor phase of liquid nitrogen until use. The umbilical cord tissue is donated by [CONTACT_664990] . The 
cells are cryopreserved and stored in the Robertson CT2 GMP laboratory ([ADDRESS_898228], 
Duke University, Durham, NC).  
 
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs):  
MSCs are a heterogeneous group of undifferentiated, multipotent cells that can be isolated 
from several different tissues including bone marrow, adipose tissue, and birth tissues 
(umbilical cord blood, umbilical cord tissue, amniotic fluid, placenta). While MSCs can give rise

 to mesodermal tissue types including bone, cartilage, and fat, their prim ary mechanism of 
action is thought to result from paracrine effects on immunomodulation, antiapoptosis, 
angiogenesis, support of the grown and differentiation of local stem and progenitor cells, 
antifibrosis, and chemoattraction (figure 1).[ADDRESS_898229] demonstrated a multitude of 
immunomodulatory effects on both humo ral and cell -mediated immune responses. These 
include, but are not limited to, inhibiting B -, T-, NK, dendritic -cell, and microglial proliferation, 
decreasing pro -inflammatory cytokine production, and blocking neutrophil recruitment.

from Singer, Annu. Rev. Pathol. Mech. Dis., 2011.16) 
 
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_664954], MSCs themselves have low 
immunogenicity. MSCs express low levels of MHC class I molecules on their surface and lack 
expression of MHC class II and several costimulatory molecules. This allows MSCs to be 
used in the allogeneic setting, without the need for donor -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_664955]. In fact, in a review of 13 huma n studies of 
intravenous allogeneic MSC administration, there were no reports of infusional toxicity17 or 
longer term SAEs, supporting the notion that MSCs are “immune -privileged” and can avoid 
immunological allorecognition. When utilized as a therapeutic c ell, it is widely accepted that 
MSCs exert effects via paracrine and trophic signaling. They do not engraft in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  
 
Safety of MSCs:  
MSCs manufactured from bone marrow and adipose tissue have been studied in hundreds of 
clinical trials worldwide involving thousands of individuals and a wide variety of human 
conditions. Their safety has been repeatedly demonstrated and is summarized in a [ADDRESS_898230]-transplant conditions. Based on a combination of randomized controlled trials and 
uncontrolled studies with follow -up periods of weeks to up to 5 years, there was no association

which did not cause any long -term sequelae. Importantly, no malignancies were reported in 
patients without a prior history of cancer.  
 
After intravenous administration, approximately 70% of infused MSCs are engulfed by [CONTACT_664992]. While there is a theoretical risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800], the only 
randomized trial in which acute pulmonary reactions have been observed was conducted  in 
patients with chronic ischemic heart failure who received intracoronary MSCs.[ADDRESS_898232] (clinicaltrials.gov).

 Experience with MSCs in Children:  
The most well -studied MSC product given to children to date is a bone marrow -derived product 
originally manufactured by [CONTACT_129402]® and subsequently acquired by [CONTACT_664993] -L used to treat patients with GvHD after a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. 
Prochymal® received regulatory approval in Canada in 2012 and in Japan in 2018 as TEMCELL® 
for use in children with acute steroid refractory GvHD. A recent expanded access study of 
Remestemcel -L enrolled 241 children (median age 9.6 years) with refractory GvHD from 2007 -
2014.68 Eight MSC doses (2x106 cells/kg/dose) were given intravenously over a four week time 
period, with four additional weekly infusions in patients who demonstrated a partial or mixed 
response. There were no incid ences of ectopic tissue formation in [ADDRESS_898239] frequent severe adverse events were infections (24%) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_330287] (16%), common issues in post -transplant patients. There were only 11 severe adverse 
events and one infusion reaction related to MSC treatment. Patients with primary steroid -refractory 
GvHD who had only been treated with steroids demonstrated an 81% response rate to MSCs. 
Overall, 65% of patients demonstrated an improvement in their GvHD, with higher response rates 
in patients with less severe disease. This demonstrates that repeated doses of MSCs are safe and 
well-tolerated in children, and suggests that they provide anti -inflammatory and 
immunomodulatory effects in the setting of GvHD. A more recent phase III open -label, single arm 
study of Remestemcel -L in 55 children with primary steroid refractory GVHD replicated these 
results.   
 
In a recent study, a German group pooled bone marrow cells from 8 healthy donors to create an 
MSC cell bank.69 They treated 26 children, ages 1 -19 years old with steroid -refractory GvHD, 
with a total  of 81 doses of MSCs from this bank (median 3 doses per patient, median 2.2x106/kg 
MSCs IV per dose). Treatment was well -tolerated, with only one reported headache and one 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_129367]. Six patients died from causes unrelated to MSCs 
(thromboembolism, disease progression, GvHD, sepsis). Response rate, defined as complete or 
partial remission of GvHD, was 77%.  
 
Others are investigating the use of MSCs in patients with other conditions. There have been case 
reports of intracoronary admin istration of autologous bone marrow -derived MSCs in children, ages 
4 months to 14 years, with severe dilated cardiomyopathy and/or heart failure with subsequent 
short - and intermediate -term improvement in clinical condition and B -type natriuretic peptide 
values.70-[ADDRESS_898240] tissue -
derived MSCs without apparent adverse events.  
 
MSCs in Neurologic Conditions:  
Numerous preclinical studies using MSCs for diseases of the central nervous system suggest 
that MSCs can act through release of different neurotrophic, anti -inflammatory, and anti -
apoptotic factors to promote recovery the injured area and prevent further damage. The majority 
of clinical experience has focused on adults with stroke, with a few studies in patients with 
neurodegenerative conditions or multiple sclerosis (MS).  
 
 
 
Open Label Phase I  HCT-MSC in Toddlers with ASD (TACT)  
 
May 17, [ADDRESS_898241] (MultiStem) conducted in 126 adult patients with stroke (65 treated, 61 
placebo), MSC therapy was well -tolerated.74 While there was no difference between placebo and 
treated patients in measures of stroke recovery, the treatment group had a lower rate of mortality 
and infections, associated with down regulation of inflammatory biomarkers including IL -6. 
Patients who re ceived MSCs earlier ([ADDRESS_898242] -stroke) 
demonstrated more favorable recovery than patients who received later treatment or placebo.  
 
A few clinical trials of autologous MSC therapy have been conducted in patients with mult iple 
sclerosis (MS). Of 25 patients with progressive MS treated with a single intrathecal injection of 
autologous bone marrow -derived MSCs, the disease stabilized in half of patients over a one -year 
time period.75 Side effects, all tr ansient and self -limited including low -grade fever, 
nausea/vomiting, lower limb weakness, and headache, were likely related to the intrathecal route 
of administration and were consistent with those reported from other small studies of intrathecal 
MSC treat ment in patients with MS.76,77 Another study that treated 10 patients with progressive 
visual deficits due to MS with a single intravenous dose of autologous bone marrow -derived 
MSCs demonstrated improvements in visual acuity, visual evoked response latency, and optic 
nerve area.78 
 
One clinical trial has been conducted in seven patients with Parkinson’s diseas e who received 
a single dose of autologous bone marrow -derived MSCs transplanted to the subventricular 
zone using stereotaxic surgery. With a follow -up of 10 to 36 months, three patients 
demonstrated an improvement in disease symptoms. Two patients also re ported subjective 
improvement of symptoms and reduction in drug dosage .79 
 
Potential Mechanism of MSCs in ASD:  
The exact mechanism of action of MSCs in ASD is the subject of ongoing inves tigations, but there 
are several potential means through which MSCs may exert therapeutic effects, including cell -
mediated immunomodulation, molecular -mediated neuroprotection, and restoration of functional 
neurologic circuitry.  
 
MSCs have been shown to exert immunomodulatory effects on cell -mediated immune 
responses by [CONTACT_61670] T -cell proliferation and decreasing production of pro -inflammatory 
cytokines, including TNF -α and interferon gamma.[ADDRESS_898243] -MSCs and CD3/CD28 beads to stimulate T -
cell proliferation (figure 2).  
 
MSCs may also provide neuroprotection through anti -inflammatory mechanisms by [CONTACT_664994], microglial activation, astrocyte proliferation, and oxidative stress molecules.[ADDRESS_898244] 
of the MSCs or if it is mediated through activation of cytokines (ie. TCP, IL -6).

Finally, MSCs may also aid in synaptogenesis and restoration/regeneration of functional 
neurological pathways by [CONTACT_664995]. Various molecular targets have been implicated, incl uding tissue plasminogen 
activator (tPA), synaptophysin, brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotransmitter 
receptors. Through a series of in vitro  experiments via coculture, patch -clamp, inhibitory, and 
biochemical techniques, Koh, et al.82 demonstrated that (1) human umbilical cord -tissue derived 
MSCs can induce synapse formation and enh ance synaptic function and (2) thrombospondin 
proteins are both produced by [CONTACT_664996] -derived MSCs and necessary for their synaptic effects. 
In addition to chemokines associated with the capacity to repair endothelium, hCT -MSCs also 
produce thrombospondi n-1, indicating that they may also have the capacity to restore effective 
synapses. Research at Duke University demonstrated that hCT -MSCs produce and secrete 
multiple cytokine and chemokines using cytokine arrays by [CONTACT_664997] (Norcross, GA). Follow up 
studies using Bioplex assays and ELISA measured levels of selected cytokines/chemokines as 
shown in Table 2.

Derecki et al85 report recovery of function in a mouse model of Rett syn drome, an X -linked 
condition associated with ASD typi[INVESTIGATOR_664956] a mutation of the MECP2  gene. This gene 
encodes a methyl -CpG-binding protein, and the mutation leads to deficient phagocytic function in 
glial cells. Transplantation of cells from wild ty pe bone marrow via intravenous infusion arrested 
disease development in the mouse model of Rett syndrome ( Mecp2 -null C57BL/6 mice). Following 
engraftment, survival was improved, breathing patterns normalized, apneas were reduced, body 
weight increased, and  locomotor activity was improved.  
 
The BTBR T+ Itpr3tfI (BTBR) mouse strain, derived from the inbred Black and Tan BRachyury 
strain, is another mouse model of ASD. In addition to impaired social behavior, aberrant 
communication, increased repetitive behavi ors, and increased cognitive rigidity, BTBR mice  also 
exhibit increased levels of peripheral CD4+ T -cells, peripheral B -cells, and serum and brain

 immunoglobulin levels, among other immune abnormalities.86 Segal -Gavish, et al87 delivered 
human MSCs to BTBR mice via intraventricular injection into the central nervous system. Mice 
were immunosuppressed with cyclosporine before and after treatment. In this model, 
improvements in all three domains – social behavior, stereotyped behaviors, and cognitive rigidity 
– were observed in MSC -treated mice compared to controls. Differences in anxiety -related 
behaviors and locomotion were not observed.

safe, feasible and improve cor e symptoms of autism in affected individuals. Results of these 
studies are summarized below.  
 
DukeABCs Clinical Trial: Duke investigators recently completed and published the  results of an 
open -label Phase 1 safety and tolerability study in 25 children (ages 2 -5 mean age 4.5 years), 
diagnosed with ASD who were treated with a single intravenous infusion of autologous  CB 
and followed for a year (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ).88 CB was administered as a 
single infusion (median infused dose:  2.6x107/kg, range: 1.0x107/kg to 8.1x107/kg). No 
immunosuppression was administered prior to infusion.  
 
The safety and tolerability profile of autologous CB infusion in ASD was excellent. No s erious 
adverse events were reported, and adverse events, in general, were sparse. Three children 
had mild allergic reactions associated temporally with the infusions, consisting of cough and 
hives during infusion for [ADDRESS_898249] to preliminary assessments of efficacy, improvements in social communication 
abilities were noted on the caregiver -completed Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales -Second 
Edition (VABS -II) and on the Pervasive Developmental Disorder Behavior Inventory (PDDBI) 
(figure 4). The Clinical Global Impression -Improvement scale, completed by [CONTACT_664999], reflected 
beneficial changes during the [ADDRESS_898250] -infusion in core ASD symptoms in 
approximately 60% of the participants, as manifested by [CONTACT_3038]’ increased social 
communication skills, receptive/expressive language, decreased repet itive behavior, and 
decreased sensory sensitivities.  In computerized eye -tracking assessments, the participants 
manifested improvements in social attention. Participants, on average, showed a 20% increase 
in odds of gazing at the actress’ eyes over time (O R=1.20, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.43, p5.048). A [ADDRESS_898251] score was associated with a 14% increase in 
odds of gazing at the actress (OR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.07,1.21; p<.001).[ADDRESS_898252]-MSC in Toddlers with ASD (TACT)

 There was also some evidence that improvements in social behavior were found to be associated 
with increases in connectivity across brain regions when assessed via diffusion tensor imaging 
(obtained via MRI scans). In an open label trial evaluating the eff icacy of autologous cord blood 
for treating autism symptoms, improvement on 3 behavioral outcome measures was correlated 
with increased connectivity between the left temporal pole and the left hippocampus (VABS II 
p<0.001; Expressive One Word Pi[INVESTIGATOR_17122] -Fourth Edition (EOWPVT -4) p<0.05; 
CGI-I p<0.0001). Improvement on both the VABS -II and the EOWPVT -4 was correlated with 
increased connectivity between the fusiform and putamen (VABS II p<0.05; EOWPVT -4 p=0.01) 
as well as between the inferio r temporal gyrus and the hippocampus (both p<0.05), both in the left 
hemisphere. Finally, there was a significant correlation between improvement on both the VABS -II 
and the CGI -I and increased connectivity between the inferior temporal gyrus and superior 
temporal gyrus (VABS -II p<0.05, CGI -I p<0.01) and between the temporal pole and globus 
pallidus (VABS II p<0.01; CGI -I p<0.05) in the left hemisphere. Improvement on the VABS II and 
CGI-I was also significantly correlated with increased connectivity betwee n the frontal pole and 
globus pallidus and the insula and putamen in the right hemisphere (all p<0.05). Based on these 
data, a Phase 2 randomized study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of CB therapy versus 
placebo in children with ASD. Data analysis of this trial is currently in progress.  
 
MSCs in ASD: One Chinese study enrolled [ADDRESS_898254] blood mononuclear cells (CBMNC, given both intravenously and 
intrathecally) (n=14), CBMNC + intrath ecal umbilical cord -derived mesenchymal stem cells 
(UCMSC) (n=9), or standard therapy (n=14).[ADDRESS_898255] -treatment, both treated groups demonstrated 
greater improvement in multiple ASD measures (Childhood Au tism Rating Scale, Clinical Global 
Impression scale, Aberrant Behavior Checklist) than the placebo group, indicating a potential 
therapeutic response.  
 
Results of a Phase I Trial of human cord tissue MSCs in children with ASD: At Duke, we  have 
treated [ADDRESS_898256] -MSC infusions 
with a two -month interval between doses. Each dose contained 2x106/kg hCT -MSC (see study

 Twelve children, three girls, nine boys with a mean age of 6.4 years (range 4 -9 years), were 
enrolled between June and October 2017. Eleven participants were white, one was Asian; two 
were Hispanic or Latino . A total of [ADDRESS_898258] -MSC doses were administered from 3 different 
manufacturing lots. Target dose at each administration was 2.0x106 TNC/kg based on the post 
thaw count. The mean of the actual dose infused was 2.0x106 TNC/kg with a standard deviation of 
0.4x10 6 TNC/kg. One patient received a lower dose of 1.79x106 TNC/kg (Patient 12 at Infusion 3) 
due to a laboratory complication. All children were premedicated with an intravenous dose of 
diphenhydramine 0.5mg/kg and solumedrol 0.5mg/kg approximately [ADDRESS_898259] -MSC infusion was 
successfully completed after a dose of IV Benadryl. One patient in Cohort 3 experienced 
Moderate Hypotension after infusion 3 and received a dditional IV fluids.  
 
A total of 66  non-serious  Adverse Events (AE s) that were not specifically attributed to the study 
product  were reported among 11 of the 12 enrolled participant s (Figure 6) .  All of these reported 
events were Mild.  The most frequently occurring event, a gitation during the infusion procedure, 
was associated with the requirements of placing and maintaining an IV and being confined to a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_664958], and all of these events r esolved on the same day.  A total of 22 
other p sychiatric or behavioral symptoms were reported in 7 different participants: 2  participants/2  
event s in Cohort 1, 1 participant/5  events in Cohort 2, and 4 participants/15  events in Cohort 3. 
These symptoms included aggression (n=2), agitation (n=5), anxie ty (n=3), defiant behavior (n=2), 
depression (n=1), emotional labiality (n=1), insomnia (n=3), intentional  self-injury (n=1), and 
stereotopi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (n=4).  Of note, 3 participants accounted for 17/22 of the psychiatric or behavioral 
adverse events.  Aside from agitation during the infusion procedure, there was a trend of 
increasing frequency of non -serious adverse events with increasing number of doses 
administered, but this was not statistically significant. There were no differences observed in the 
frequency o f AEs according to lot number ( GMP -075: median=9 events/participant, range: 1 -12; 
GMP -087: median=4.5, range: 0 -13; GMP -088: median=3.5, range: 3 -50) (P Kruskal -Wallis=0.58).  
There were no concerning changes in blood counts, chemistries, basic inflammatory  markers 
(CRP, ESR), or humoral and cellular immune profiles throughout the study.  All participants 
remained Coombs negative.   
 
Six months after the initial hCT -MSC dose, development of anti -HLA class I antibodies was 
observed in [ADDRESS_898260] detectable HLA antibodies pre -treatment. HLA 
antibody data is available on all 12 participants at baseline and 6 months, and 11/12 participants 
at ≥[ADDRESS_898261] -MSC dose. In those participants who developed new HLA 
antibodies  by [CONTACT_157515], the HLA antibodies persisted at ≥12 months (figure 7). The HLA 
antibodies were directed against HLA alleles/antigens expressed on the MSCs and not by [CONTACT_4677]. There were no associated clinical events in patients who developed anti -HLA a ntibodies.

May 17, [ADDRESS_898271] through paracrine and trophic mechanisms to favorably modulate ongoing inflammation and/or 
immune pathology in the brain, suppress microglial  activation, and possibly protect neurons from 
further damage. The p rimary hypothesis of this phase I c linical trial is that administration of hCT -
MSCs will be safe and tolerable and result in improvement in the social communication abilities, 
as measured via objective ratings of social communication abilities  during caregiver -child 
interaction.  
 
In many contexts, MSCs suppress, rather than augment, immunological and inflammatory 
responses. Documented mechanisms include shifts in effector T cells such as g eneration of 
regulatory T cell populations and changes in monocyte/dendritic cell cytokine generation leading 
to anti -inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, it is plausible to consider a population of MSCs as an 
immunological and/or anti -inflammatory agent. Bo th postmortem brain tissue studies and PET 
imaging data from living individuals with ASD have revealed evidence of increased microglial 
activation, suggesting that immune and/or inflammatory mediated brain damage plays a role in 
the etiology of ASD as disc ussed above.[ADDRESS_898272] tissue -
derived mesenchymal stromal cells (h CT-MSC) in toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  
Toddlers 18 months to <4 years (3  years 364 days)  of age  with a  confirmed  diagnosis of ASD will 
be eligible to participate . Diagnosis will be  confirmed at the time of the eligibility visit at the Duke 
Center for Autism and Brain Development .  All participant s will receive a single intravenous dose 
of 2x106/kg hCT-MSC per kilogram at baseline.  Assessments will be conducted at baseline and 6 
months, with remote follow -up assessments at 12 months.  
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and feasibility.  Safety assessments includ e 
monitoring of  acute infusion reactions, adverse event s, incidence of infections, and  markers of 
alloimmunization .  Clinical outcome measure s will also be d escribed.  A key clinical outcome 
measure  is the change in  social communication abilities  from baseline to 6 months based on the 
Joint Engagement Rating Inventory (JERI ), a commonly -used and well -validated coding system 
for rating the quality and quantity of social communication  skills in toddlers with and without 
ASD.91  JERI coding rates social communication abilities on a  1 to 7 scale and factor s in both the 
quantity and quality of skills .  The total joint engagement score as well as r atings on all JERI 
subscales that comprise the total score will be described .  
 
Other clinical endpoints will include the  PDD Behavior Inventory (PDDBI) autism composite score , 
the mean of the Socialization Subscale Standard Score and Communication Subscale Standard 
Score on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS -3), the Clinical Global Impression Scale

around the mouth, throat or eyes, tachycardia, bradycardia, diaphoresis), transmission of infection, 
and HLA sensitization.  Theoretical risks that must be considered but have not been associated 
with MSC administration in humans include the possibility of immune suppression and ectopic 
tissue formation.  Cord blood collected with the cord tissue used to manufacture hCT -MSC is 
screened for infection, and the product must meet releas e criteria prior to infusion, as described 
below.  Participants will not receive immunosuppressive therapy prior to or after infusion of hCT -
MSC cells.   Additionally, an inherent risk in completing study procedures in person is possible 
exposure to COVID -19; however, social distancing, screening, masking, cleaning and other safety 
procedures in line with the most recent guidelines from Duke Health and the Duke University 
School of Medicine have been implemented to minimize this risk as much as is feasible.    
 
Potential benefits of this intervention include the possibility that hCT -MSC may, via direct or 
indirect mechanisms, induce changes that result in the reduction of the participant’s core ASD 
symptomatology and improvement in abilities affected by [CONTACT_665003] .

If a participant has consented to the Duke Center for Autism Research Repository (Pro00054178), 
study team members may access these data for purposes of screening , eligibility, or as source 
data in this study. Participants screened for or enrolled in the TACT  study may also be 
approached per repository protocol to determine their interest in storing data from this study and

 any future studies into the repository for future use.  The consent form and participant -facing 
materials related to the Duke Center for Autism Research Repository are submitted and approved 
separately, through Pro00054178 .   
 
Screening for the study is co nducted under a separate, IRB -approved screening protocol 
(Pro00063563).  Under this protocol, after written informed consent is obtained from a 
parent/guardian, the patient’s medical and psychological records, therapy records, photographs, 
behavioral vide os, and results of genetic testing are obtained and reviewed by [CONTACT_392729].  The 
medical review is conducted by a team of pediatric nurses, nurse practitioners, and physicians to 
identify the presence of any metabolic, immunologic, neurologic, sensory, gene tic, or laboratory 
exclusion criteria.  If no exclusion criteria are identified, the psychiatric review is then conducted by 
a combination of psychologists, psychiatrists, and other clinically trained staff  with expertise in 
diagnosing and treating childre n with ASD.  They perform an extensive review of the patient’s 
psychological records as well as any therapy records available. A patient must be approved by 
[CONTACT_665008], phone, 
teleconfere nce, or in-person screening and study enrollment.  Should a concern for a previously 
undiagnosed condition or genetic finding arise during the screening process, this will be discussed 
with the patient’s parent(s)/guardian(s) and a referral will be made to  an appropriate medical or 
psychiatric provider for evaluation and treatment, if indicated.  
 
5.5 EARLY WITHDRAWAL OF RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS  
 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy : 
1. Diagnosis of a genetic disease while under evaluation or on study.  
2. Change in medical condition that precludes study participation.  
 
Patients who are off protocol therapy are to be followed until they meet any one of the off-study 
criteria (see below).  Follow -up data will be obtained on off -protocol participants unless consent is 
withdrawn.  Participant s that are taken off study prior to infusion of hCT -MSC will be considered 
not evaluable and can be replaced with another  participant . 
 
Off-Study Criteria : 
1. Death.  
2. Lost to follow -up. 
3. Withdrawal of consent for any further data collection.  
4. Completion of the final study visit.  
6.[ADDRESS_898283] TISSUE -DERIVED MESENCHYMAL STROMAL CELLS (hCT -
MSC)  
hCT-MSCs are a product of allogeneic cells manufactured from digested umbilical cord tissue that 
is expanded in culture, cryopreserved and banked.  hCT -MSCs are manufactured from umbilical 
cord tissue donated to the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank, an FDA -licensed, FACT -accredited, public 
cord blood bank at Duke University Medical Center, after written informed consent from the baby’s 
mother.   Cord tissue is harvested from the placentas of male babies delivered by [CONTACT_129431] C -
section after a normal, full -term pregnanc y.   Donor screening questionnaires are completed by 
[CONTACT_129432], and maternal blood is tested for communicable diseases by [CONTACT_129433] -certified 
donor screening laboratory.   Donors must be eligible for donation to a public cord blood bank for 
allogene ic use.   After delivery of the placenta and cord, the cord blood is aseptically drained from 
the placenta.   Then the cord is dried and cleaned with chloropreps, separated from the base of the

Expansion XSFM (Irvine Scie ntific) media with 1% platelet lysate and grown to confluence (~7 -14 
days) to establish the P0 culture.   To establish the master cell bank, P0 is harvested and 
cryopreserved in cryovials with Cryostor 10 media (BioLife), and stored in the vapor phase of 
liquid nitrogen.   P1 and P2 cultures are grown under similar conditions, in hyperflasks or 
hyperstacks without platelet lysate, as needed to create the working cell bank and product for 
administration, respectively. Cells from P1 and P2 are removed from plas tic cultureware using 
TrypLE (Gibco). The final product is derived from the P2 cultures which are harvested into 
plasmalyte with 5% human serum albumin, washed and cryopreserved in 5 compartment 
cryobags (Syngen) in 5 mL containing 50 -100 million cells in a final concentration of 10% DMSO

Nucleic acid testing for HIV -1/2/O, HBV, WNV and HCV are also performed on maternal blood. 
Screening for Zika virus may also performed.  
  
Because the cord tissue used for this study will be obtained from donors consented for cord blood 
donation to the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank, they will undergo donor screening and infectious 
disease testing per Carolinas Cord Blood Bank standard operating procedures.  The cord blood -
associated maternal samples and co rd tissue MSC samples will be retained as reference samples 
for future testing as part of this study.

7.1 OVE RVIEW  
Parents/Guardians who have previously contact[CONTACT_129436] a child who may meet 
eligibility criteria for this study will be notified that this study is available.  After initial contact, 
parents/guardians of potential research participants will h ave an initial phone or teleconference 
interview with study personnel to describe the study, verify basic eligibility criteria, and confirm 
their interest in participation.  The participant’s eligibility will then be screened through review of 
medical and psychological records, therapy records, video, photos, cognitive and diagnostic 
testing, and laboratory testing under a separate screening protocol and consent.  
 
Once all screening is complete and the participant  is likely to meet study criteria, the participant  
will travel to Duke for their first visit.  During their baseline visit at the Duke Center for Autism and 
Brain Development , the informed consent will be obtained and participant  eligibility will be 
determined by [CONTACT_665011] -5

SenseToKnow (S2K) Application with 
Computer Vision Analysis (CVA)  Autism symptoms  10 minutes  
*The DAYC -2 and BOSA  are only conducted during screening  
 
7.5.1 Assessments for Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder:  
Diagnosis of ASD will be confirmed by [CONTACT_9288] -[ADDRESS_898299], which will be informed by [CONTACT_665017] (BOSA) Assessment.  Clinical research staff that have been 
certifi ed as research reliable in the administration of the ADOS -2 will complete diagnostic 
evaluations.  
Brief Observation of Symptoms of Autism (BOSA):  This assessment will be used to help inform a 
DSM -[ADDRESS_898300]-MSC in Toddlers with ASD (TACT)  
 
May 17, [ADDRESS_898301] (DSM -5): This is a clinician checklist based off of 
diagnostic c riteria for ASD within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth 
Edition.  Diagnostic criteria are taken from the DSM -5, and are utilized in order to confirm 
appropriate ASD diagnosis for inclusion in the study.  This checklist is co mpleted by [CONTACT_665018]’s best judgment and is informed by [CONTACT_665019] . The DSM -[ADDRESS_898302] is completed at baseline.  
 
 7.5.2 Other Clinician Assessments:  
Developmental Assessment of Young Children - Second Addition  (DAYC -2): 92 The Developmental 
Assessment of Young Children (DAYC -2) is a cognitive based assessment designed to identify 
delays in very young children and preschoole rs from birth through [ADDRESS_898303] administration time varies from 10 -20 minutes per domain . This 
assessment will be conducted during the baseline visit only . 
 
SenseToKnow (S2K) Application  (app):  The application consists of a series of brief dynamic 
stimuli (including short, <1 minute movies and games) which are designed to elicit  early risk 
behaviors related to autism.  The application records the child's behavior  via the front -facing 
camera as he or she interacts with the stimuli. Algorithms based on computer vision and  machine 
learning are  employed  to quantify a multitude of autism symptom behaviors,  including attentional 
responses,  preferential gaze,  facial affect, and motor responses.  Dawson and  Sapi[INVESTIGATOR_664963] -clinic and at -home environments  demonstrating that CVA can objectively 
and reliably  quantify autism symptoms.93-97 The application takes about 10 minutes will be 
conducted at the baseline and 6 month visits.  
 
JERI Rating based on Parent -Child Interaction  Task  (PCIT): During a 12 -minute Parent -Child 
Interaction  Task  (PCIT), the participant will be observed during two contiguous sessions 
conducted in the same room comprised of (1) a six-minute interactive play session in which the 
parent joins the child in play and (2) a six-minute independent play session with toys available 
during which the caregiver will be sitting in the corner of the room completing a questionnaire . The 
Parent -Child Interaction Task will be completed at the baseline and 6 month  visits.  Behavior will 
be video recorded with audio recording. Behavior will then be characterized through two methods: 
1) automated video tracking with computer vision analysis , and 2) behavioral coding of child social 
communication abilities during interactive pl ay using the Joint Engagement Rating Inventory 
(JERI ).91  Videotapes will be coded using JERI by [CONTACT_665020].  Computer vision 
analysis  software will be used to automatically track the child’s movements and the parent’s 
movements. The purpose of the video tracking is to automatically measu re social approach or 
avoidance and exploration. The primary dependent variable is the time spent in each core region 
(center of room, periphery of room, near parent, activity table). Exploratory dependent variables 
will be related to latency, frequency, v elocity and movement.  
 
The JERI will be used to code for child engagement states during the first  6-minute parent -child 
interactive play session. Behaviors that will be rated include: unengaged, object engaged, 
support ed joint engagement, coordinated joint engagement, symbol -infused joint engagement, 
and total joint engagement. All items are rated on a 1 to 7 scale and factor in both the quantity and 
quality of each behavioral state of engagement.   Dependent variables wil l include total joint 
engagement (primary endpoint) and ratings on all items (secondary endpoints).  
 
Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (VABS -3) Survey Interview Form :98 This will be 
used to assess social, communication, motor, and adaptive behavior. The assessment is 
administered to the parent/caregiver using a semi -structured interview format. This assessment 
 
 
Open Label Phase I  HCT-MSC in Toddlers with ASD (TACT)  
 
May 17, 2021   Page 35 of 55 
 takes about 60 -120 minutes to administer.  The VABS -3 is a well -standardized measure of several 
domains of adaptive functioning including socialization, communication, daily living, and motor 
skills. Norms are available from birth to 90 years.  The Socialization subdomain assesses play, 
interpersonal relationships and copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]. The Communication subdomain assesses receptive, 
expressive and written language skills. The Dai ly Living Skills subdomain assesses personal, 
domestic and community living skills. The Motor Skills subdomain assesses gross and fine motor 
skills. The VABS -3 will be completed at the baseline , 6, and 12  months.   
 
Clinical Global Impression (CGI) : The CGI is a commonly used rating scale with two components 
that measures symptom severity and treatment response.  
 
The Clinical Global Impression – Severity Scale (CGI -S) is a 7 -point scale that requires the 
clinician to rate the severity of the partic ipant’s symptoms based on parent interview and child 
observation at the baseline and 6 month visits.  The CGI -S requires the clinician to rate the 
severity of the participant’s symptoms of ASD at the time of the assessment, relative to the 
clinician’s past  experience with participants who have the same diagnosis. There will be three 
separate CGI -S ratings; these include social communicative functioning, restricted/repetitive 
interests and behaviors, and overall. The CGI -S will be completed at the baseline a nd 6 months.  
 
The Clinical Global Impression – Improvement (CGI -I) is a 7 -point scale that requires the  clinician 
to assess how much the participant has improved or worsened relative to baseline  based on 
parent interview and child observation . There will be three separate CGI -I ratings; social 
communicative functioning, restricted/repetitive interests and behaviors, and overall improvement. 
The CGI -I will be completed at the 6-month visit.   
 
7.5.3 Parent Caregiver Questionnaires:  
All caregiver questionnaires will be completed online through a Duke approved EDC system or by 
[CONTACT_29160]. The EDC survey tool is available for Duke users through a university -wide site license. The 
EDC is integrated with Duke’s NetID authentication system but allows sharing of surveys with non -
Duke users.   
 
Pervasive Developmental Disorder Behavior Inventory (PDDBI) :99 The PDDBI was developed to 
assess responsiveness to intervention in children with ASD. The PDDBI is an informant -based 
rating scale that is designed for children 1 year, 6 months to 12 years, 5 months.  It assesses 
problem behaviors as well as appropriate social, language, and learni ng/memory skills. The 
PDDBI assesses both social impairments typi[INVESTIGATOR_664964] -social skills that are integral to improved reciprocal social behavior. 
The PDDBI renders raw scores as well as t-scores based on comparisons to a standardized ASD 
population.  The PDDBI has been validated in a PDDBI development sample of 311 children 
between the ages of 1 and 17 years old. This is a parent questionnaire with 188 items that takes 
approximately 30 -45 minutes to complete.  The PDDBI will be administered every three  months.  
 
Intervention History Questionnaire : This questionnaire is completed by a primary caregiver to 
obtain detailed information on behavioral health interventions that the child/family h as been 
involved in over the past [ADDRESS_898304] administered.  Information 
is collected about the type and quantity of interventions, services, and treatments the child is 
receiving. This questionnaire will be administered at baseline, 3 months and 6 months .

 comprehension, and grammar.  It was developed for use in infants an d toddlers ages 8 to 30 
months but it may also be used with older children with developmental delays.  Because language 
changes so dramatically during that time span, there are t hree separate forms for different age 
ranges and language abilities.  Each for m generally takes 20 -40 minutes to complete.   
 
CDI: Words and Sentences form is designed for children ages 16 to 30 months.  This form yields 
scores for vocabulary production and a number of aspects of grammatical development, including 
sentence complexit y and the mean length of the child's longest utterances. The CDI words and 
sentences version will be used for all participants.  This form will be collected at baseline, 3 
months, 6 and 12 months.  
 
 
Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) 4.0 Generic Core Scales:  The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales 
is a 5 -minute parent questionnaire that measures the child’s functioning in the dimensions of: 
physical, emotion, social and school. The Toddler Parent Report version is composed of 21 items 
and will be completed at the baseline and 6 month visits and remotely at 12 months.   
 
 
Center for Autism and Brain Development (CABD) Demographics Form : The CABD demographics 
form collects race and ethnicity according to the NIH reporting standards. Additional questions 
collec t data to help characterize the population. This parent questionnaire takes less than 10 
minutes to complete and will only be completed at the baseline visit.  
 
Medical and Behavioral History Questionnaire (MBHQ) : The MBHQ is a broad assessment of 
medical and behavioral issues. It is completed at baseline, three , six, nine and [ADDRESS_898305] Survey (CEFIS): [ADDRESS_898306] of the pandemic on the family.  The CEFIS will be completed every three 
months.  Data collected with the CEFIS measure will be de -identified and shared with the tool 
developers through a CSV file sent securely using D ukeBOX.

9.0 SAFETY AND ADVERSE E VENT REPORTING  
9.1 DEFINITIONS  
Adverse E vent (AE) :  An adverse event is any untowar d medical occurrence associated with the 
use of the investigational product regardless of whether it is considered related to the 
investigational product.   
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) :  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered 
“serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following 
outcomes:  death, a life threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_664966], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Important medical events 
that may not result in death, be life -threatenin g, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47022], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant  and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Grade/Sev erity:  Grade/severity will be assessed according to CTCAE v5.0 guidelines.  
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction :  A suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event for which there 
is a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused the adverse even t.  “Reasonable 
possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the investigational 
product and the adverse event.  
 
Causality :  The investigator will use the following question when assessing causality of an adverse 
event to t he investigational product: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the investigational 
product caused the event?”  An affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected adverse 
reaction.  
9.[ADDRESS_898317] be recorded.  AEs occurring in 5% of enrolled participants will be reported in 
clinicaltrials.gov.  Information to be reported includes  date when the site became aware of the 
event, in vestigator -specified assessment of severity and relationship to study therapy, whether 
there is an alternative etiology, seriousness, as well as any required treatment or evaluations, and

 outcome.  In general, investigators should report adverse events as diseases or syndromes 
whenever possible, instead of reporting individual component symptoms, signs, laboratory 
abnormalities, and sequelae.  
Severe adverse infusion reactions (fatal, life -threatening or requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will be 
reported within sev en calendar days of receipt of the information.  All fatal or life threatening SAEs 
will be reported by [CONTACT_665021], following FDA guidel ines.  All serious and 
unexpected AEs will be reported to the FDA via a written report within 15 days of receipt of the 
information (21 CFR 312.32).  If the  principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_664967], then the event will not require expedited reporting but will be included in the annual 
summary report.  
The following events within [ADDRESS_898318] -MSC infusion will also be recorded in the e -CRF: 
infusion reaction, sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, fever, 
rigors/chills, nausea, vomiting, infection, dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoglobinuria.  
9.3 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_664968] F DA.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_664969] (expedited report) associated 
with the use of the study therapy as soon as possible but no later than seven calendar d ays after 
receipt of the information.  Initial notification will be followed by a written report within [ADDRESS_898319] ( IRB) and DSMB of any study related and unexpected SAEs.   
9.4 ELICITING ADVERSE EVENT I NFORMATION  
In addition to research participant observations, AEs will be documented from any data collected 
throughout the study including clinically significant laboratory values or physical exam findings.  
9.5 STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_664970].  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_664971].  The study will be stopped for a safety review if:  
 Any participant  experiences a grade 4 -5 infusion reactions within 48 hours of infusion; OR  
 Two or more grade [ADDRESS_898320] by [CONTACT_665022]/or the DSMB occur;  
OR 
 Any participant  experiences a blood stream infection within 6 months of infusion;  
OR 
 Any participant  develops grade II -IV GvHD;  
OR 
 Any death.  
 
A consensus decision to stop the study will be made by [CONTACT_149463].  Such a 
decision with its supp orting documentation and possible future plans for the study will be 
submitted to, and discussed with, the FDA.  
 
 
Open Label Phase I  HCT-MSC in Toddlers with ASD (TACT)  
 
May 17, [ADDRESS_898321] (DSMB)  
A DSMB will be formed and a charter established.  Members of the DSMB will be independent of 
Duke University and comprise d of a minimum of three members, including a clinician with 
experience in the treatment of ASD and a physician with experience in cell therapy.  The DSMB 
will be notified immediately for all SAEs directly related to the study product throughout the study.  
A total safety assessment will be prepared on an annual basis and forwarded to the DSMB for 
review as well.  The DSMB and its members will have the right to make decisions and act 
independently.  Policies of the DSMB will be described in the DSMB charter and signed by [CONTACT_665023].  
 
All study related and unexpected SAEs reported or observed during the study beginning at the 
time of the study infusion must be recorded and maintained in the study participant’s paper files.  
Severe adverse infusion reactions (fatal, life threatening or requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will be 
reported to the IRB and FDA in accordance with HRPP policies.  
11.0 DATA HANDLING AND QU ALITY ASSURANCE  
11.1 CASE REPORT FORMS  
As part of the responsibilities assumed by [CONTACT_665024], the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_59778]-Investigators agree to maintain adequate case histories of the research participants treated 
as part of the research under this protocol.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator agrees 
to maintain accurate CRFs  and source documentation as part of the case histories.  Duke 
University will supply the CRF electronically (eCFR) through secured electronic data entry 
systems.  
11.2 VIDEO AND AUD IO RECORDINGS  
Video recordings of potential participants from parents and g uardians may be submitted and used 
for determining study eligibility.  Audio and video recordings may also be obtained of portions of 
the evaluations and interviews if indicated with parental consent, and may include full facial 
features  and audio .  The re cordings will be used solely for analysis by [CONTACT_665025]/guardian.  They will be stored 
electronically on a password -protected server and identified by [CONTACT_3038]’ study ID.   
Software used to conduct and record visit assessments completed remotely will be done on Duke 
approved platforms and participants will receive instructions to enhance privacy and security 
measures.  
11.3 INSPECTION OF RECORDINGS  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_582208]-Investigators and institutions involved in the study will permit 
study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and regulatory inspection(s) by [CONTACT_636226].  In the event of an audit, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator 
agrees to allow the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other regulatory agency access to all 
study records.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigators should promptly notify all relevant 
parties of any audits scheduled by [CONTACT_665026] y authorities and promptly forward copi[INVESTIGATOR_664972].  
 
 
Open Label Phase I  HCT-MSC in Toddlers with ASD (TACT)  
 
May 17, [ADDRESS_898322] RETENTION  
Study results will be retained in the participant ’s research record for six years after the study is 
completed or until the participant  reaches  the age of 21, whichever is longer.  Essential 
documents should be retained until at least two years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an International council for  Harmonisation (ICH) region and  until there are no 
pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least two years have 
elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product.  
These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_11005].  
11.5 Process for adding the Study Diagnostic Report to Patient’s Duke Medical Record  
As part of this study, it the participant  (or their LAR, as applicable) also receives clinical ser vices at 
Duke  outside of the study, they may request  have their clinical evaluation report(s) added to their Duke 
Maestro chart. Doing this will allow researchers and clinicians at the Duke Center for Autism and Brain 
Development to better integrate our re search and clinical programs. If the patient is getting care outside of 
the study at Duke, they may benefit from this by [CONTACT_665027] -research 
context more seamless, allowing providers to review reports from clinical asse ssments conducted as part of 
the study in order to inform clinical care, and avoiding unnecessary duplication of efforts on the part of both 
research participant and study team. Most participants of the study are not patients receiving regular 
medical care  at Duke outside of the study. However, in the event that a participant would like to have the 
report added to the medical record, they may make a request to do so.   
 
When receiving a request, the study team will let the participant know, or remind them, t hat the diagnostic 
report will summarize diagnoses, developmental function, and cognitive skills and other symptoms and 
abilities that were assessed as part of the study; that we will not “list” or change diagnoses in the medical 
record, but will make the report available for other Duke Health providers to review. We will also note that 
the report will indicate that the individual received the evaluation as part of a study. Documentation of 
requests will be stored with the participant’s research record.  
 
11.6 Participant Engagement  
Participants of this study may be contact[CONTACT_665028][INVESTIGATOR_664973], including any parts that they enjoyed and/or any 
challenges. They will be reassured tha t this is completely optional. Questions include: their 
experience in the study generally, their opi[INVESTIGATOR_664974], the quality of print 
materials and interactions with our staff, anything about the study they found helpful and any 
challenges encountered, and what changes might be helpful to consider in the future. Interviews 
may be recorded on Duke -approved platforms if the family agrees. These open -ended questions 
and responses will not be asked as a part of this study, or used for dat a analysis, or to make 
conclusions about the study, but may be used in efforts to support the Duke Center for Autism and 
Brain Development’s efforts in connecting with the broader community via social media, 
conferences, newsletters, seminars and other eve nts/media about our research efforts and impact 
at the Duke Center for Autism. This activity will be key to the Center’s efforts in promoting active 
engagement and bidirectional exchange with the families we serve and the broader community. 
These interview s may also help inform designing protocols and/or making changes as needed to 
enhance inclusivity, cultural appropriateness, and feasibility. If staff perform post -study interviews, 
participants will be asked whether they want to publish their identity in any publicly published 
information or would prefer to not be named. The relevant information will be added to a HIPAA 
waiver provided by [CONTACT_665029]. Although these interviews and dissemination and outreach core ( DOC ) activities 
are not part of the study, we wish to inform the IRB that these interactions may take place as it 
may entail additional interactions with research participants.

12.[ADDRESS_898324] Operating Procedures or Working Practice Documents or Guidelines.   
12.1 CONFIDENTIALITY  
All laboratory speci mens, evaluation forms, reports, and other records will be identified in a 
manner designed to maintain research participant confidentiality.  All records will be kept in a 
secure storage area with limited access.  Clinical information will not be released without the 
written permission of the research participant’s guardian except as necessary for monitoring and 
auditing.  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator and all employees and coworkers involved with this 
study may not disclose or use for any purpose other than performance of the study, any data, 
record, or other unpublished, confidential information disclosed to those individuals for the 
purpose of the study.   
12.[ADDRESS_898325] APPROVAL  
Federal regulations and the ICH guidelines  require that approval be obtained from an IRB prior to 
participation of human research participants in research studies.  Prior to the study onset, the 
protocol, informed consent, any advertisement used to recruit study participant s, and any other 
written  information regarding this study to be provided to the research participant or the research 
participant’s legal guardian must be approved by [CONTACT_1201].   
 
All IRB approvals should be signed by [CONTACT_352821], the clinical protocol by [CONTACT_29985]/or protocol number, and the date the approval 
and/o r favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_11744].  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator is responsible for obtaining continued review of the 
clinical research at intervals not exceeding one year or otherwise specified by [CONTACT_1201].  The 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator must supply the Sponsor or its designee with written 
documentation of continued review of the clinical research.  
12.[ADDRESS_898326] be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201].   
12.4 INFORMED CONSENT  
A written informed consent in compliance with Part 5 0 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) and Institutional IRB shall be obtained from each research participant prior to 
entering the study or performing any unusual or non -routine procedure that involves risk to the 
research participant.   
Before enrollment, each prospective research participant and/or at least one  legal guardian will be 
given a full explanation of the study and be allowed to read the approved informed consent form.  
 
 
Open Label Phase I  HCT-MSC in Toddlers with ASD (TACT)  
 
May 17, 2021   Page 44 of 55 
 Once the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator is assu red that the research participant/legal 
guardian understands the implications of participating in the study, the research participant/legal 
guardian will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by [CONTACT_617047].  
The Princip al Investigator or Sub -Investigator shall provide a signed/dated copy of the signed 
informed consent to the research participant and/or legal guardian.   
12.5 PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS AND DEVIATIONS  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator or designee mus t document and explain in the 
research participant’s source documentation any deviation from the approved protocol.  The 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the 
protocol to eliminate an immediate hazar d to study research participants without prior IRB 
approval.  As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation or change, 
the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendment(s) should be submitted to the IRB for 
review and approv al, to the Sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if required.  
 
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the procedures 
and/or processes approved by [CONTACT_665031] P rincipal 
Investigator or Sub -Investigator.  Deviations usually have an impact on individual research 
participants or a small group of research participants and do not involve inclusion/exclusion or 
primary endpoint criteria.  A protocol violation occurs wh en there is non -adherence to the protocol 
that results in a significant, additional risk to the research participant, when the research 
participant or Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator has failed to adhere to significant protocol 
requirements (inc lusion/exclusion criteria) and the research participant was enrolled without prior 
Sponsor approval, or when there is non -adherence to FDA regulations and/or ICH GCP 
guidelines.  
 
Protocol violations and deviations will be documented by [CONTACT_665032]. Principal Investigators or Sub -Investigators will be notified of violations and/or 
deviations in writing by  [CONTACT_134639]/or the study monitor. The IRB should be notified 
of all protocol violations and deviations  meeting criteria  in a timely manner as required by [CONTACT_779]’s 
IRB.  
12.6 STUDY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
By [CONTACT_6231], the Pr incipal Investigator or Sub -Investigator agrees to submit reports 
of serious adverse events according to the timeline and method outlined in the protocol.  In 
addition, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator agrees to submit annual reports to his/h er 
IRB as appropriate.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator also agrees to provide the 
Sponsor with an adequate report shortly after completion of the Principal Investigator’s or Sub -
Investigator’s participation in the study.  
12.7 FINANCIAL OBLI GATIONS  
Duke University is not financially responsible for further testing/treatment of any medical condition 
that may be detected during the screening progress. In addition, in the absence of specific 
arrangements, Duke University is not financially respo nsible for further treatment of the research 
participant’s disease.

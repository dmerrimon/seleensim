Date : 06/27/2017 Study Objectives:  
• Primary:  
• Secondary:  The primary objective is to ascertain if addition of Linagliptin  improves CD34+ 
cell function and gene expression  in early type 2 diabetes pati ents with CKD 
stage 1 -3, which will be correlated to improvement in 24hr urinary protein 
estimation and creatinine clearance  (obtained via micro -albumin/creatinine ratio 
from a spot urine sample).  
The secondary objective is to correlate the cellular outcom e measures with other 
measures of endothelial function such as:  
1. Arterial stiffness measures with  pulse wave analysis  and pulse wave velocity 
measurements  
2. Serum biochemistry looking at surrogates  of endothelial health, endothelial 
inflammation, appet ite controlling hormone levels and fasting glucose, insulin 
and lipid profile .  
3. Resting Metabolic Rate measurement  
 
Study Outcome Measures

inadequately controlled (Hb A1C ≥ 6.5 % to ≤ 10%) while being treated 
with stable Insulin , Metformin, or both .  
• Cellular markers. We will study pre and post Linagliptin  treatment 
changes in number, function and gene expression of patients’ peripheral 
blood -derived CD34+ cells.

Protocol Version: 6.9 7 
Date : 06/27/2017 1 INTRODUCTION  
Type 2 diabetes is a national epi[INVESTIGATOR_901] (1, 2) with significant macro and microvascular 
complications  (3). Insulin resistance in pre -diabetes and overt diabetes are associated 
with endothelial dysfunction  (4).  
A few studies indicate that stem cells particularly EPCs can act as a suitable bio -marker 
(5-7, 9) for monitoring cardiovascular morbidity. In this proposal we suggest that EPCs 
or CD34 positive cells (defined as CD34/VEGFR2+ cells) can act as a suitable cellular 
biomarker for estimating and following endothelial dysfunction in early type [ADDRESS_985791] been shown to be dysfunctional in both CKD patients a nd 
type 2 DM patients. (5, 7, 31 , 35)  
Linagliptin ( TRADJENTA ) tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to 
improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. No dose adjustment is 
recommended for patients with renal impairmen t. (29)  
EPCs have been used as a regenerative tool in ischemic myocardium and diabetic 
wound healing (8, 10-13). Endothelial dysfunction with associated inflammation may be 
a consequence of excess intra-cellular super -oxide presence in a setting of diabete s 
which is a pro -oxidative stress condition ultimately leading to poor EPC function and 
senescence  (14).  
Though lifestyle modification has been proposed as a main stay for prevention and 
treatment of early type 2 diabetes, (2, 15 -19) several new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_721734]  (2). Incretins and incretin mimetics appear to hold 
promise. Mechanism of positive effect of exercise and oral hypoglycemic agents can be 
very different. (44 -50) 
DPP-[ADDRESS_985792] been shown to increase  EPCs in patients with type 2 diabetes  
(20) reportedly via SDF -1 alpha up -regulation. Interestingly, up -regulation of SDF -1 
alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), both chemotactic factors increase 
mobilization and recruitment of EPCs in the f ace of acute ischemic injury for repair and 
regeneration . (21-24).  
Several studies have shown positive effect of incretins (Glucagon like peptide, GLP -1) 
and incretin receptor agonists (GLP -1 receptor agonists) on cardiovascular risk factors in 
type 2 dia betes patients  (20, 25) and even in patients with chronic heart failure and left 
ventricular dysfunction who do not have diabetes  (26, 27) .  
DPP-[ADDRESS_985793] cardio -protective effects of their own, as they increase bio -
availability of endogenous G LP-1. They improve blood flow and nitric oxide production in 
 
Linagliptin -Sen I IS  
Protocol Version: 6.9 8 
Date : 06/27/2017 endothelium  (28, 29) . These are unique properties not demonstrated by [CONTACT_721754]  (29). The mechanism underlying these effects may be mediated by 
[CONTACT_721755].  However these 
beneficial effects appear to be independent of glycemia reduction.   
It is however unknown whether Linagliptin will have any positive effect on human EPC 
function where two prominent cardiovascular risk f actors co -exist such as CKD and type 
2 diabetes.  
Therefore we plan to investigate if Linagliptin can alter function and gene expression of 
CD34+ cells in a setting of CKD and type 2 diabetes.  We choose to look at non geriatric 
adult population with early type 2 diabetes ( ≤15 years of duration) at an early phase of 
renal impairment (stages 1 -3). 
We specifically choose to exclude known CVD disease patients and early type 2 DM 
patients with early CKD as this cohort may be still retain  capability to reverse or halt 
persistent endothelial damage seen in type 2 diabetes and CKD (3,30,35) .   
Our preliminary study results , which just finished, looked at effect of 150min/week of 
aerobic physical activity on EPCs in pre -diabetes population show that interventions 
even though non pha rmaceutical can lead to quick (within 4 weeks) improvement in 
gene expression and function of CD34+ cells. These cellular changes are reproducible 
and consistent with other outcome measures such as serum biochemistry and vessel 
wall dilation measures such as flow mediated dilatation. (34)    
Research Hypothesis:  
We hypothesize that Linagliptin, a member of DPP -4 inhibitor group of drugs may be 
able to improve number and function of CD34+  endothelial progenitor cells by [CONTACT_25764] -
regulating chemotactic agent SDF1 alpha (DPP -4 degrades SDF -1) and its receptor 
CXCR4  (7, 20, 21) and thereby [CONTACT_721756]. We also propose that this expected cardiovascular benefit is independent of 
HbA1C reduction.  (30, 31)   
In this proposed st udy we plan to recruit patients with type 2 diabetes of ≤15 years 
duration  (in early phase of diagnosis) , who are  on a stable dose of insulin , Metformin, or 
both for at least 3 months  either short or long acting  but still remain inadequately  
controlled wit h HbA1C between 6.5% and 10% (both values inclusive), but not overtly 
out of control (> 10% of HbA1C).  
The patient will adjust insulin levels so as to keep their HbA1C levels under 10.0%, for 
health measures. If the HbA1c rises above 10.0% then the PI [INVESTIGATOR_17027] l speak with the patient 
and provide a documented form indicating the insulin dose adjustment that should be

Date : 06/27/2017 made.  Initially life -style intervention with diet and regular aerobic activity (as per 
Standards of Diabetes Care: Diabetes Care Supplement: Jan 20 14) along with insulin 
titration will be undertaken for initial 4 weeks  (time between screening visit and 1st visit). 
Subjects will begin taking 5.[ADDRESS_985794] of Linagliptin  on Endothelial progenitor cells (CD34 
positive cells)  in patients whose HbA1C is between 6.5 to 10% (both inclusive) 
while being on treatment wit h a stable dose of insulin , Metformin, or both  for the 
preceding 3 months before enrollment.  
 
Cellular markers : We will use patient’s peripheral blood derived CD34+ cells looking at 
number, function and gene expression changes pre and post Linagliptin  over 12 weeks 
of therapy .  
Urinary Function Marker in CKD : We will estimate 24hr urinary protein estimation and 
creatinine clearance  (This is measured via the micro -albumin/Creatinine ratio provided 
from a random spot urine sample).  
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_985795] of Linagliptin  treatment on serum endothelium inflammatory 
markers including: C -reactive protein (hs -CRP), IL -6, TNF-alpha , and fasting lipid profile 
including ApoA1 and ApoB  (5, 6, 30 , 36).  
 
Glycemic control  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_721757], insulin levels and 
HbA1c. Fasting blood glucose , insulin and lipid profile will be used to assess insulin 
resistance (32, 37)  
 
Adiposity  will be measured using the Tanita Body Composition Analyzer scale, 
measured as percenta ge body fat (33). Serum will be used to estimate levels of SDF1 -
Alpha, VEGF, and GLP1 levels by [CONTACT_6428] (25 , 28, 29, and 30 ). 
We also intend to follow resting Metabolic Rate at baseline , midway,  and post DPP4 
inhibitor therapy to ascertain if Linagliptin has  any effect on RMR (56).  
 
Kidney health will be monitored by [CONTACT_721758] / creatinine  
levels , which will be obtained from the spot urine sample.  
a. Subjects will have the option of opting into a sub -study that is being 
where  10-20 mL  of the excess fresh spot urine that has been 
collected will be used  for exosome analysis. This is optional, and is 
not required of subjects. For details of urine -exosome study please 
see the appendix.

The biochemical or bio -inflammatory markers are an i mportant marker of endothelial 
inflammation and dysfunction along with glycemic markers and markers of arterial 
stiffness  (36-43, 55, 57 ). Literature suggests that DPP4 inhibitors and GLP1modifies and 
modulates hemopoetic stem cells and vaso dilatation ( 37, 44, 45).  
Vessel health will be assessed by [CONTACT_721759], using arterial tonometry. 
The central and the aortic pressure is assessed by [CONTACT_721760] (PWA) and 
pulse wave velocity (PWV) . Arterial stiffness  will be assessed using vascular flow and

Date : 06/27/[ADDRESS_985798]. Various  studies  (11, 34), have shown that various di sease states, including those 
seen in diabetes, can deplete and damage EPC, thereby [CONTACT_721761].  The inability to maintain or repair damaged endothelial tissue leads to 
cumulative vascular dysfunction and cardiovascular diseas e.  
 
We hypothesize that monitoring number,  function and gene expression of 
endothelial progenitors will allow us to quantify cardiovascular disease risk at the 
onset and regenerative potential post intervention at a cellular level. It will also 
help us to  identify and correlate the best endothelial function bio -chemical 
inflammatory marker as an early indicator of cardiovascular disease progression

Insulin will be titrated upwards if HbA1C is above 10% with minimal dose adjustments so 
as to keep the adjusted HbA1C below overtly uncontrolled levels (above 10%).  
 
Our study population will include equal numbers of adult male and female Type 2 
diabetes (T2DM) patients aged 40 -70 years, enrolled in both arms of the study.  
Patients will be treated with 5 mg of Linagliptin or placebo  for 12 weeks and  with 
adequa te lifestyle modification  for 16 weeks (as per Am erican  Diabetes Association

Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Serum Cr should be used to estimate 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Estimate d GFR (eGFR) is commonly reported by 
[CONTACT_721762] (MDRD) study equation or the Chronic Kidney Disease Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10427] (CKD -EPI) equation. The latter is the pref erred GFR estimating 
equation. GFR calculators are available at http:// www.nkdep.nih.gov .  
Abnormal urinary albumin excretion and eGFR may be used to stage chronic kidney 
disease (CKD). The National Kidney Foundati on classification (Table below) is based 
on both kidney damage (UACR at or above 30 mg/g Cr) and eGFR.  
Normal UACR is defined as less than 30 mg/g Cr, and increased urinary albumin 
excretion is defined as at or above 30 mg/g Cr. Because of variability in u rinary 
albumin excretion, ideally two (at least one) specimens of UACR should have been 
collected within a [ADDRESS_985802] 
albuminuria.

procedures outlined before . The only exception to this requirement is when a subject 
withdraws consent for all study procedures or loses the ability to consent freely (i.e., is 
imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or 
physical illn ess). If a subject withdraws before completing the study, the reason for 
withdrawal must be documented appropriately.  
4 TREATMENTS  
4.1 Study Treatment: Linagliptin  
Definition of Investigational Product:  A pharmaceutical form of an active substance or 
placebo bei ng tested or used as a reference in a clinical study, including products 
already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled (formulated or packaged) 
in a way different from the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or 
when used  to gain further information about the authorized form. In this protocol, the 
investigational product is Linagliptin . 
Definition of Non -Investigational Product: Other medications used in the study as 
support or escape medication for preventative, diagnosti c, or therapeutic reasons as 
components of a given standard of care. In this protocol, the non -investigational product 
is Insulin , Metformin, or both .  Patients will continue on Insulin , Metformin, or both  as per 
their study entry dose added to Linagliptin  or placebo.  As mentioned before, pa tients on 
oral hypoglycemic  agents other than Metformin  will not be invited to join the study as 
OHA plus DPP4 inhibitor could have a different effect on vasculature or hemopoetic 
CD34+ stem cells compared to insulin and  DPP4 inhibitor.

Protocol Version: 6.9 16 
Date : 06/27/2017 This study is being conducted under FDA mandated guideline for use in type 2 diabetes. 
Though in this particular study Linagliptin  is referred to as the investigational drug, it is 
not a novel drug and we should not need a separate IND f or execution of this study.  
4.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to a Treatment  
Subjects, as per selection criteria below will be randomized to treatments using a 
permuted block design, developed by [CONTACT_59743][INVESTIGATOR_623] & Biostatistics Research Core. 
This approach ens ures groups will be approximately balanced at any time during the 
study and at study completion.  
4.[ADDRESS_985807]  
The recommended dose of Linagliptin  is 5 mg PO will be given once daily. Linagliptin 
can be taken with or withou t food.  
4.3.1  Dose Modifications  
No dose modification is necessary in CKD stage 1 -3 
4.4 Blinding/  Unblinding  
Blinding is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, in the event of a medical 
emergency or pregnancy in a subject, in which knowledge of t he investigational 
product is critical to the subject's management , the blind for that subject  may be 
broken.  
Before breaking the blind of an individual subject’s treatment, the investigator 
should have determined that the information is necessary, i.e., that it will alter the 
subject’s immediate management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is 
not investigational product -related, the problem may be properly managed by [CONTACT_721763]-blinding.  
End of Study Unblinding Protocol  
Upon completion of the research study, we will undergo the following protocol in order to 
unblind the research data.  
Unblinding  is the process by [CONTACT_570965], 
clinical staff and the trial statistician becomes aware of which intervention each subject 
enrolled in the research study was taking.  
Unblinding at the end of the study is required in order to make unmasked analysis in 
accordance with the study analysis pl an. It is also conducted in order to inform the 
participants of which investigational product they were assigned to.  
 
Linagliptin -Sen I IS  
Protocol Version: 6.9 17 
Date : 06/27/2017  
Time to unblind:  
Unblinding shall be conducted when all subjects enrolled in the research study have 
finished treatment, and all follow u p visits. There must be no plan to recruit any more 
subjects in the research study. Additionally, all data points and outcome measures for 
each research subject must have been collected, and ideally compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602]. Prior to 
unblinding there will be a data lock o n clinical outcome measures and basic side 
outcome measures and associated  research data collected for the study.  
 
Procedure to unblind  
Once data (from both the clinical and the basic science side) and has been compi[INVESTIGATOR_721736], the investigat or can choose to unblind. The Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_721737], and receive permission to un -blind. If, for unforeseen 
reasons, at the pre -determined date for full study unblinding the data analysis on the 
cellular or basic aspects of the study is lagging behind the clinical data outcome 
measures (though the data has been acquired) the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_721738] -blind the clinical outcome measures before the 
basic side data has been an alyzed but compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602]. Upon confirmation from the study 
sponsor, the principle investigator must make a written request to the designated party 
to unblind, hereto referred at the “ unblinder ”. The unblinder is the bio -statistician of the 
MFA, [CONTACT_721775] r. Upon receipt of an instruction to unblind, the unblinder will 
sign the request form, indicating their agreement to unblind. This form will then be taken 
to the pharmacy, MFA’s IDS , where a member of the IDS staff will take the form, and 
will give the un blinding study binder to the unblinder. The pharmacy will sign to indicate 
their release of the binder, and the unblinder will sign to indicate receipt of the binder. At 
this point in time the chain of custody of the pharmacy unblended binder has been 
transferred to the designated party to unblind. The form with all of the signatures will be 
provided to the study coordinator to be kept in the regulatory binder.  
 
Possible Adverse Events, Definitions of Adverse Events and Management  
Adverse event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, including an 
exacerbation of a pre -existing condition, in a patient in a clinical investigation who 
received a pharmaceutical product. The event does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationsh ip with this treatment.

• Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity  
• Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities  
Causal relationship of adverse event  
Medical judgment should be used to determine the rela tionship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history. Assessment of causal relationship  should be recorded in the case report forms.  
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
 administered and the AE.

Protocol Version: 6.9 21 
Date : 06/27/2017 Research Study Design and Methods:  
 
Patient Definition and Sele ction:  Adults aged 40 -70 years will be recruited from the 
GWU MFA research patient database provided by [CONTACT_570968] , and 
then contact[CONTACT_570969] , from the endocrinology and other provider clinic s at 
GWU and through referrals from the Veterans Affairs (VA) clinics . Suitable 
advertisements for the study patient enrollment will be posted. Patients will be included 
in the study if they have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within the previous 15 
years using criteria of the American Diabetes Association  (2), and are currently treated 
with a stable dose of Insulin , Metformin, or both . We plan to enroll subjects with HbA1C 
between 6.5% and 10% (both inclusive) and with BMI 25 -39.9 kg/m2 (both inclusive). 
Post enrollment, patients will b e randomized to Linagliptin  [ADDRESS_985809] the details of the study 
described to them, and they will be given a writ ten informed consent document to read. 
Then, if subjects consent to participate in the study, they will indicate that consent by 
[CONTACT_157324].  
Recruitment:  Subjects will be recruited fr om the p hysician clinics at GWU, Medical 
Faculty Associates, where [CONTACT_109202] is a clinician , as well as through referral from the VA . 
All patients will receive counseling regarding the study aims and methods.  
Study Design Overview: We propose a 2 -arm random ized, double -masked, placebo -
controlled, parallel group, longitudinal study of 1 2-weeks duration. (See study design 
below), recruited over  3 years.  The 1 2 week time interval has been previously shown 
adequate to observe changes in endothelial progenitor s tem cells, biochemistry  and 
importantly, PWV changes  [20, 36]. Patients will be randomized to 2 groups:  
Control, (n=20), Insulin /Metformin /Both  + Lifestyle  + Placebo  
Treatment, (n=20) Insulin /Metformin /Both  + Lifestyle  + Linagliptin 5mg  
This proposed study  is based on patients with type 2 diabetes of ≤[ADDRESS_985810]  3 months  but still 
remain poorly controlled with HbA1C between 6.5% and 10% (both inclusive),  but not 
overtly out of contr ol (> 10% of HbA1C). Our study design is similar to that of Fadini et al 
[20] where Sitagliptin was compared to placebo with endothelial progenitor cells as a n 
outcome measure in patients with type [ADDRESS_985811] as a confounding factor 
on CD34+ cell number, function and gene expression.  
 
Linagliptin -Sen I IS  
Protocol Version: 6.9 22 
Date : 06/27/[ADDRESS_985812] DPP -4 inhibitor studies are with animal EPCs where 
comparison with human CD34+ population is difficult to make. In one study  (58) where 
saxagliptin was used for 12 weeks  in drug -naïve type 2 diabetes patien ts there was 
placebo -subtracted HbA1c reduction noted of 0.45 -0.63%. It showed mean placebo -
subtracted reductions in fasting serum glucose  of 20 mg/dL. From our laboratory studies 
of in vitro human EPC studies we do not think glucose level change of 20 mg/ dL is 
significant enough to account for changes in EPC number, function and gene 
expression. However we will take th e possibility  of glycemia change/ reduction in 
experimental arm into account during statistical analysis of the results between the 
Linaglip tin and placebo groups.  
As per recent clinical guidelines  (2), all patients at entry will receive dietary advice by 
[CONTACT_2420], diabetes educator, or registered dietician specifically geared towards 
type 2 diabetes patients. They will be advised to adhere to 150 minutes of weekly 
aerobic exercise (50 -70% of maximal heart rate). Patient’s activity will be monitored 
using accelerometers and will be downloaded at visit 2 and visit 3 by [CONTACT_5984].  
Subjects will be taking 5.0 mg of Linagliptin  or placebo. Dose titration of insulin will be 
allowed so that the HbA1C is maintained below 10%. 
Visits with outcome measurements  will be scheduled for the morning  while overnight 
fasting (except  water) to reduce diurnal variability, and clinical parameters wil l be 
obtained at scheduled office visits as depi[INVESTIGATOR_721743]:  
Week -4: Subjects will be screened and eligibility will be verified based on physical and 
laboratory tests. Equal numbers of mal e and female patients will be recruited. All 
patients will be educated on the recommended lifestyle changes of maintaining a level of 
aerobic activity of 150 minutes/ week (non -supervised) and adherence to a healthy diet 
as advised by [CONTACT_9137] , a diabetes educator, or a dietitian  as part of the 
type 2 diabetes patient management plan  [2].  We will allow 4 weeks for the patients to 
reach a steady state while implementing diet and exercise changes.  
Week 0:  At this stage patients will be randomize d into the study. Subjects will have the 
first set of measurements. We will make sure that patients still meet the inclusion criteria. 
They will be started on medication or placebo and will be encouraged to continue 150 
minutes/week of moderate physical ex ercise and dietary management for the remainder 
of the study.

Genes associated with progenitor cell chemotaxis: VEGF -A, SDF1 alpha, CXCR4  
  
Secondary Measures:  
• Highly selective C -reactive protein (hs -CRP), IL -6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and fasting 
lipid profile including ApoA1 and ApoB  (3, 6)  
• Serum SOD acti vity and SDF1 alpha (ELISA), VEGF -A (ELISA) and GLP -1 
(ELISA) levels will also be assessed  (14, 20, 24, 39) . 
• Assessment of insulin sensitivity using the HOMA -IR (32), calculated from 
individual serum measures (fasting glucose (mg/dl)* insulin (µU/mL)/405) [37].  
• Adiposity will be measured using the Tanita Body Composition Analyzer scale, 
measured as percentage body fat, BMI, waist -hip measurements (5, 55)  
• Fasting lipid profile will be checked as a marker of insulin resistance and lipo -
toxicity at weeks 0, 6  and 12.  
• We also intend to acquire Pulse wave analysis and Vascular Flow using 
SphygmoCor CP system from ATCOR to measure central arterial pressure and 
arterial  stiffness  (38-42). The secondary measures are indirect measures of 
endothelial inflammation in  early type 2 diabetes patients . (30, 31, 55, 56, 57) .  
• Obtain indirect calometric measurements of basal metabolic rate using machine 
obtained from Korrs Medical. This is a non invasive procedure . We plan to 
measure the oxygen that the body consumes.  It will help us calculate a patient ’s 
Resting Energy Expenditure (REE), commonly referred to as a Resting Metabolic 
Rate (RMR).   As our protocol is directed to overweight and obese individuals 
using incretin therapy, it will be beneficial to note if the treat ment modifies RMR.

mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_721744].   Because there is a 
direct correlation between oxygen consumed and calories burned (4.813 calories 
for every milliliter of oxygen consumed), an accurate measurement of oxygen 
consumption is an effective measurement of calorie consumption. The machine 
uses a one -way valve in th e disposable (MetaBreather) mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].   This draws

5 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Statistical Analysis:  
Sample Size Estimation:  
The total sample size requested, accounting for attrition over the 1 2-week period, is 20 
subjects per group or 40 subjects total.  We plan to allow for 25% attrition (drop out), 
therefore plan to screen 55 patients over three years . 
 
Sample size estimates were based on the effects of exercise on CD34+/KDR+ cells and 
VEGF, as described in the literature (47-50).   
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_721747].  
 
The effect of a single session, as well as extended training, on healthy subjects or those 
with existing cardiovascular conditions appears to increase the CD34+/KDR+ cells and 
VEGF.   
 
Linagliptin -Sen I IS  
Protocol Version: 6.9 26 
Date : 06/27/2017  
To compute sample size we used the approach suggested by [CONTACT_17157], Liang, & Zeger 
(1994) (51) which compares the rates of change in the two study groups over t ime.  This 
approach incorporates the number and interval of time points and the correlation among 
repeated measures.  For this study, we will employ one baseline and two follow -up 
measures at 6 and 1 2 weeks.  Further, we will assume a correlation 0.60 amon g 
repeated measures of the outcome.  We consider this a conservative estimate since 
Frison and Pocock (1992) (52) suggest a correlation of 0.65 as reasonable in the 
absence of an existing estimate. We also note that as this correlation increases, 
statistica l power also increases.  
 
The results in the table below show the expected mean difference in study groups at the 
end of follow -up, as well as the average rate of change in the two groups at 80% power 
and 90% power.  To estimate the effect of Linagliptin  on the CD34+/KDR+ cells, we 
expect that the effect would be at least 25% greater than the effect seen for exercise 
alone.  Using the results from Sandri et al. (2005)49 for the rate of change and the 
variability, the CD34+/KDR+ cells increased an average ra te of about 4/wk with a 
standard deviation of about 15.  Thus, for a 25% increase in the rate of change for the 
CD34+/KDR+ cells due to Linagliptin , a sample size of 18 subjects per group would 
provide about 84% power, assuming measures taken at baseline a nd [ADDRESS_985818] of Linagliptin  is only 20%, a sample of 18 
would provide about 70% power, whereas a sample of 20  would provide about 73% 
power.  
 
For VEGF, the results from Sandri et al. (2005) (49) were mixed with one study group 
showing a .6 pg/mL per week increase and another showing a 0.5 pg/mL per week 
decrease after 4 weeks of training.  If we assume that Linagl iptin will increase VEGF 
consistently at 0.3 pg/mL per week difference in slopes compared with exercise alone, 
then assuming a standard deviation of 5 and correlation or 0.60 among repeated 
measures, a sample size of 18 per group would provide about 77% po wer to detect a 
difference in slopes of 0.3 pg/mL per week or a mean difference in the groups at the end 
of the study of 3.6 pg/mL.  A sample size of 27 would provide about 90% power to detect 
the same effects.  
 
Thus, we feel that a sample size of at least  [ADDRESS_985819] 18 per group who complete the study, we will enroll 20 subjects per group in order 
to account for attrition over the 1 2-week intervention period.

To estimate the effect of linagliptin on CD34+/KDR+ cells, we originally proposed 
a sample size of 20 per group in 2 groups, giving us power = .73, assuming 
alpha=.05, between time points of .[ADDRESS_985821] size we were modeling was an 
interaction that explained 3% of total variance, or a partial eta -square = .0291.  
Using 3 groups (Insulin only, metformin only, metformin + insulin), with the s ame 
effect size, we would achieve this same level of power using a total sample size 
of 51 (17 per group). However, given the relatively small numbers of potential 
participants with insulin -only (n=21) and insulin+metformin (n=54), and the 
relative large n umber with Metformin only (260), we will need to change the 
allocation ratio between groups. Maintaining the same total sample size as 
originally proposed (40), we will allocate patients from each group in the following 
numbers : Metformin only (22), Metfor min+insulin (12), Insulin only (6).  We 
recognize that we will be underpowered for comparisons between the Metformin 
+ insulin versus Insulin groups. However, comparisons with the Metformin -only 
group will still have reasonable power.  Given the small numbe r of potential 
patients with Insulin -only, this is a feasible strategy for including this group in the 
analysis.  
 
 
Data Analysis .   
 
The distributional assumptions of all measures will be examined. Means and standard 
deviations will be computed for contin uous measures and proportions for categorical 
variables. Graphical representations of the mean group slopes and individual slopes will 
be generated and inspected.  Study groups will be compared to determine whether any 
imbalance between the groups on patie nt characteristics remain after randomization.  If 
imbalance is evident, by [CONTACT_122317], all models will be adjusted for the unbalanced 
covariates.  Change in outcome over time will be examined using a multilevel approach 
with linear mixed models (LMM) (53, 54).  The longitudinal multilevel modeling approach 
will enable us to examine characteristics of within -person change, as well as between -
group differences that may influence change.  LMMs handle missing data more 
efficiently than traditional ANOVA design s. In the linear mixed models, the patient is 
considered a random effect and the outcome measured at specific time points is nested 
within patient.   In an initial model containing only the variable TIME, we will use a 
likelihood ratio test to determine wh ether a random effect for time should be modeled.

ij ij i i ij ij Timeu u Time Y   + ++ +=1 0 1 0The model below represents a random intercept for patient and a random coefficient for 
TIME.  
 
 
We will examine whether TIME may be modeled linearly by [CONTACT_721767] (represented w ith two indicator variables) to a model with TIME as 
a single continuous variable.  Assuming time may be modeled as a continuous variable, 
subsequent analyses will add study group and other patient characteristics as 
covariates. We are particularly interes ted in whether there is a significant interaction 
between study group and time, adjusting for other patient level covariates.  A significant 
interaction would indicate that the slopes in outcome over time differ by [CONTACT_2060].  If 
the global test of inter action is significant, subsequent significance testing of the pair 
wise comparisons of group slopes group will be adjusted for multiple comparisons.  The 
model also includes coefficients for the group -by-time interactions and random effects 
for patient and  time.  
 
 
In the event that TIME is modeled using indicator variables, two indicator variables will 
be used to represent the three time points, with baseline serving as the reference 
category.  The interaction between GROUP and TIME will be modeled in a si milar 
fashion using two additional indicator variables.   The above multivariable model enables 
us to adjust for time -varying covariates, such as glucose.  Since glucose will be 
measured contemporaneously with the outcomes at each visit, however, causal 
interpretations of glucose and any outcome are suspect.  As such, we will consider 
glucose as a nuisance covariate, and consider any relationship between glucose and an 
outcome as merely associative.   
 
APPENDIX A: OPTIONAL URINE EXOSOME STUDY  
A urine sample  is already required as a part of [CONTACT_109202]’s Linagliptin protocol. This urine 
will be used for urine pregnancy tests (if applicable), and labcorp tests for 
microalbumin/creatinine ratio. There will likely be excess urine.  
  
Subjects will have the option to  opt in or out of a research study  in which the urine will 
undergo a urine exosome analysis.  
 
Purpose of this Study:  Exosomes  are cell -derived vesicles that are present in many and 
perhaps all biological fluids, including blood, urine, and cultured medium  of cell cultures. 
The reported diameter of  exosomes  is between 30 and 100 nm, which is larger than LDL, 
but much smaller than for example, red blood cells . Exosomes are either released from 
the cell when  multivesicular bodies  fuse with the  plasma membrane  or they are released 
directly from the plasma membrane.[3] Evidence is accumulating that exosomes have 
specialized functions and play a key role in, for example,  coagul ation , intercellular 
signaling, and waste management.[1] Consequently, there is a growing interest in the 
clinical applications of exosomes. Exosomes can potent ially be used for prognosis, 
therapy, and biomarkers for health and disease.  In this study we are particularly interested 
 
Linagliptin -Sen I IS  
Protocol Version: 6.9 29 
Date : 06/27/2017 in exosomes released from podocytes as a marker of podocyte function and podocyte 
inflammation. Podocytes are often considered a modif ied endothelium and one of its 
more commonly used parameter is microalbuminuria.  
In this study we are using urine exosomes as an added parameter of kidney function other 
than microalbuminuria and GFR calculation.  
 
The procedure for this stud y is as follows : 
From this sample, 10-20 mL of the fresh spot urine (or as much as possible) is placed into 
a urine cup containing 1 tab of cOmplete Ultra - protease inhibitor cocktail ([COMPANY_002]) for 
exosome analysis. The s pecimen can be refrigerated at 4ºC for ~ 1 week or frozen at -
80ºC until assay, or will be processed for exosomes as follows;  
 
Spot urine for exosomes isolation  has been successfully employed in our laboratories 
from ~15 ml urine using a differential centrifugation method2,3. The supernatant will be 
subje cted to ultracentrifugation, with final centrifugation at 200,000g for 2 hr at 4ºC to 
obtain the urinary exosome pellet. The pellet will be tested for exosomes markers, 
namely CD63, CD9, CD81, Hsp70, and WT -1, nephrin and podocalyxin,  using o ne of 
two meth ods. Preferably m RNA will be extracted and then RT -PCR will be run. 
Alternative analysis will be done using gel electrophoresis followed by [CONTACT_721768].   
 
Method 1:  Urine exosome mRNA extraction  
mRNA extraction from exosomes will be accomplish ed by [CONTACT_570977] 
(Norgen Biotek Corp., Catalog # [ZIP_CODE]). Thereafter, a pre -amplification step will take 
place, this i s a necessary step to measure m RNA in exosomes and will be followed by 
[CONTACT_721769]9, WT -1, 
nephrin and podocalyxin by [CONTACT_937] -PCR.  
 
Total urinary protein content, albumin and creatinine will be measured via Lapcorp for 
the same  urine samples that have been collected.  
 
Method 2 : Gel electrophoresis and Western blot  
 Exosome pe llet will be dissolved in Laemli buffer and proteins will be resolved by [CONTACT_570978] (4 -12% polyacrylamide gel) under denaturing conditions. Subsequently, 
proteins will be transferred to a PVDF membrane by [CONTACT_570979] a dry 
blotting meth od (iBlot). The blot will be incubated with blocking solution for 1h, and 
subsequently exposed to a solution with the first antibody overnight, at 4ºC. After 
washing (5 x 5 min), the membrane will be exposed to a secondary antibody (horseradish 
peroxidase [HRP] -conjugated) for 1h at room temperature. Finally, the membrane will be 
incubated with an HRP substrate reagent to reveal the proteins bound to the antibodies 
tested. Quantitative analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_721770].

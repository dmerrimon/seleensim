[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
July 7, [ADDRESS_492707] of primer aligners in both 
the 7 aligner set Invisalign treatment and the 12 aligner set Invisalign 
treatment.  Results were measured by [CONTACT_392497] (in days), and 
refinement rate per cohort.  
Purpose  The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that allowing time for the 
biological re sponse of the periodontal ligament (PDL) resulted in successful 
achievement of clinical outcomes and subject /doctor  satisfaction.  
Relevant Scientific 
Background  Align offers treatment options to treat minor tooth movements.  These 
products consist of a li mited number of aligners in a treatment. One of the 
clinical barriers to ado ption for treatments requiring a pre -set low number of 
aligners  can be  the lack of clinical outcomes and predictability  in the set 
number of aligner sets .  A potential explanation for this hypothesis is that a 
biological delay, or “ lag”, in tooth movement occurs  at the beginning of 
treatment.  This lag is usually quantifiable and takes up to [ADDRESS_492708] 
low number aligner treatments . 
Design  This was a non -significant risk, multicenter, randomized prospective study . A 
total of twenty -one (21) doctors participated in this study, 13 in the U.S. and 
eight (8) in the U.K.  There were 253 subjects enro lled into the study, 198 
from the U.S. and 55 from the U.K. All subjects received Invisalign® Full treatment per the standard I nvisalign® Instructions for Use.  
Subjects were randomly placed into one of four  different cohorts:  
• Cohort 1: 7 aligner Cohort wear time 1  
• Cohort 2: 7 aligner cohort wear time 2  
• Cohort 3: 12 aligner cohort wear time 1  
• Cohort 4: 12 aligner cohort wear time 2  
Primary Outcome s Total treatment time (in days) and refinement rate (%) was compared 
between the 7 aligner and 12 aligner cohorts.  
• Subjects were followed for the duration of orthodontic treatment, an average of 37 weeks/262 days.  
Treatment  The Invisalign ® System .

Exclusion Criteria : 
A subject was considered ineligible if any  one of  the following exclusion

3 months prior to the start of treatment

Sites  [ADDRESS_492709] Enrollment  
• Started: 253 
o 178 female

215 completed subjects were included in the data analysis which was 
conducted by [CONTACT_392498]’s own statisticians. These 215 subjects all had initial and 
final data points for analysis. Total treatment time was  measured in days and 
refinement rate was measured as a percentage  per cohort . No Adverse Events 
were reported.

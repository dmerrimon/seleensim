   The scope of the healthcare challenge posed by [CONTACT_123986], both in the 
number of affected persons and the related cost burden. There were an estimated 
892,300 stroke -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37081] U.S. in 20 05, representing 77.3 stays 
per 10,000 persons over 45 years of age [1]. Approximately 50% of these 
individuals suffer from chronic deficits in UE function [2]. As the leading cause of 
disability in the U.S., the long -term financial impact of stroke is exo rbitant. From 
2005 to 2050, the total stroke -related burden on the U.S. economy is expected to 
exceed $[ADDRESS_139437] earnings [3].  
   Modern s troke rehabilitation practice is based on the principle of brain plasticity 
– the formation of new circuits and changes to internal structures that remap 
existing synapses to perform functions previously accomplished by [CONTACT_123987] [4]. Plastic ity may strengthen redundant pathways to restore lost 
functionality, in effect remodeling the lesioned brain [5]. This process requires 
that the affected neurological pathways be exercised through interactions that 
involve the stroke -impacted functions [6], [7]. Consequently, research suggests  
that intensive, repetitive, task -directed therapy can encourage the desired cortical 
plasticity [8], [9], [10]. Training specificity is also an important component, 
whether targeting specific functional movements (e.g . squeezing a tube of 
toothpaste) or an integrated skill (e.g. self -grooming) [11], [12]. Repetitive ADL 
practice, by [CONTACT_108], satisfies these critical requirements for brain plasticity 
supporting UE recovery.  
   Weakness in grip strength and finger ext ension are leading causes of hand 
motor control deficits following stroke [13]. In particular, a loss of ability to 
extend the fingers is a key indicator for poor graspi[INVESTIGATOR_123965] [14]. 
Additionally, an inability to bring the hand and wrist into a neut ral pose can 
IRB-HSR #[ZIP_CODE]: Glove Rehabilitation Application f or Stroke Patients (GRASP) Phase II  
 
Versio n Date: 09-18-20 
Page Number: 2 of 22 prevent participation in the task -directed functional practice necessary for 
neuroplasticity to occur.  A common technique to enable stroke patients to 
achieve a functional hand pose (and thus participate in rehabilitation) is a 
dynamic splint  that supports finger and/or wrist extension. When larger forces 
are necessary (i.e. to overcome abnormal muscle tone), an outrigger -type splint 
may be employed. One example is the spring -based SaeboFlex system [15]. For 
patients lacking finger extension d ue to weakness or mild hypertonicity, a low 
profile device such as the SaeboGlove [16] is preferable. SaeboGlove () is a 
commercially -available, passive glove orthosis that employs a plastic splint to 
support the wrist and a rubber band -based tensioner sys tem to support finger 
extension and enable patients to engage in task -specific training. These Saebo 
products are used in over 2,000 clinics and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (and by 10,000 trained 
clinicians) worldwide.  
   Numerous past efforts to apply technology to hand t herapy have focused on the 
use of active assistance including cables, pneumatics, and robotics [17], [18], 
[19], [20], [21], [22],[23] [24]. The cost of these complex systems is typi[INVESTIGATOR_123966], and many never find application beyond the research labor atory. On the 
other end of the spectrum are adaptations of hand tracking systems for therapy 
that do not provide any assistance to the wrist, hand, or fingers [25] [26] [27]. 
Hand movements elicited by [CONTACT_123988] -oriented 
and e xperiences do not correlate to real -world tasks, which is a central tenet of 
brain plasticity In summary, previous systems are limited by: (1) not providing the 
finger extension and wrist support necessary to enable a stroke patient to bring 
the hand and w rist into the neutral position required for functional tasks; (2) 
limitations of sensor and software design that do not permit hand or arm 
involvement in virtual practice of ADLs; and (3) childish arcade -type user 
experiences do not involve mental imagery and cognitive challenges that are 
representative of real -world activities.  
    Although there is substantial literature on adaptations of “virtual reality” for 
rehabilitation [28], low -cost commercial sensors and commercial game engine 
technology have onl y very recently enabled the development of sophisticated 
systems at a price point that is compatible with at -home use. Moreover, it is also 
only recently that researchers have begun to unravel the relationship between 
game design and patient motivation. Ad herence is an essential aspect of any 
treatment program. A perhaps -obvious, but often -overlooked, reality is that to 
realize gains through rehabilitation, a patient must accept and adhere to the 
prescribed treatment regime. The challenge of adherence is co mpounded by [CONTACT_123989], repetitive, task -directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_123967], fatiguing, and even painful for stroke patients. 
Without the direct encouragement of a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], adherence is a particular 
challe nge for home -based therapy.   
    The effectiveness of stroke therapy may be further bolstered by [CONTACT_123990] [33]. During mental practice of UE motor 
tasks, neural activation patterns may occur as if the impaired l imb were actually 
performing the intended action [34], [35]. One approach to promoting this effect is 
by [CONTACT_2363] a mirror to present the image of an unaffected hand as if it were the 
paretic one [36]. The resulting enhancement in cortical representation of the 
impaired extremity appears to lead to tangible improvement in motor function.

Page Number: 3 of 22 model of cognitive psychology in which subliminal activation of the motor system 
is embedd ed in “covert” stages of action that precede actual motor response 
[37]. These precursor stages encompass visualization of intended outcomes, 
recognition of environmental factors, and learning by [CONTACT_4171] – elements that 
are directly facilitated by [CONTACT_55463] -oriented virtual world -based ADL training. In the 
virtual world, limitations of impairment can be artificially mitigated, permitting the 
patients to visualize task completion in the appropriate environmental context, 
with meaningful tasks that map to real -world experience.  
The purpose of this research study is to assess the effectiveness of a novel 
ADL-centered  virtual reality system that is able to incorporate tracking and 
assistance to the hand for the purposes of stroke rehabilitation.  The Glove 
Rehabi litation Application for Stroke Patients (GRASP) system enhances a 
commercial glove orthosis, the SaeboGlove (see Figure 1) , with finger tracking 
sensors to enable a patient to manually interact with a virtual environment for UE 
motor practice .

The GRASP system, developed by [CONTACT_123991], Inc., comprises the sensor -
enhanced glove orthosis, a Kinect sensor, a Windows [ADDRESS_139438] and 
the glove sensors, GRASP software tracks a patient’s UE movements and 
translates them into equivalent movements of a graphical avatar that represents 
the patient in a virtual environment rendered on the co mputer display monitor.

Figure 2. Virtual Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)  
 
A completed GRASP Phase I study (IRB -HSR [ZIP_CODE]) involving use of the GRASP 
device by 15 stroke patient s demonstrated the criterion validity of UE 
performance measures derived from the system, as well as the usability of the 
device by [CONTACT_123993].  The results of the completed GRASP 
Phase I study are documented in the following journal p aper.

and Health, 39(2), 81 –89. https://doi.org/10.1177/1539449219829862  
The GRASP Phase II study builds on the Phase I results, targeting demonstration 
of efficacy of a home exercise program (HEP) for UE stroke therapy employing 
the GRASP system. The GRASP Phase II device has been improved to address 
lessons learned in the Phase I study. Notably, the glove sensor system is now 
wireless (Bluetooth) and the GRASP software incorporates a wider range of 
virtual activities to support pract ice over an 8 -week intervention.

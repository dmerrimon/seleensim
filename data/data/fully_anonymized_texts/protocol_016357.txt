Dementia

The
 
term
 
‘dementia’
 
encompasses
 
various
 
forms,
 
with
 
Alzheimer ’s
 
disease
 
being
 
the
 
most
 
prevalent,
 
accounting
 
for
 
60%–78%

cases,
 
and
 
vascular
 
dementia
 
following
 
at
 
15%
 
(Kearney

As
 
dementia
 
progresses,
 
it
 
is
 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_232678],
 
moderate,

stages.
 
The
 
stages
 
are

For

The

were
 
to:
 
1)
 
investigate
 
the

on

engagement
 
in

The
 
objective
 
of

was
 
to
 
answer
 
the

question:
 
Does

levels
 
in
 
individuals
 
with

We

who
 
participated
 
in
 
a
 
7-week
 
CST
 
program
 
in
 
a

facility
 
would
 
exhibit
 
significantly

Study
 
Procedur es
 
 
Before
 
the
 
start
 
of
 
the
 
study ,
 
participants
 
underwent
 
a
 
screening
 
measure
 
where
 
they
 
9
 
performed
 
the
 
ADAS-Cog–a
 
neuropsychological
 
test
 
designed
 
to
 
assess
 
the
 
severity
 
of
 
cognitive
 
impairment–to
 
assess
 
for
 
cognitive
 
impairment
 
(Schafer
 
et
 
al.,
 
2013).
 
Another
 
occupational
 
therapy
 
student
 
researcher
 
from
 
the
 
NKU
 
Occupational
 
Therapy
 
program
 
demonstrated
 
competency
 
in
 
administering
 
the
 
ADAS-Cog
 
under
 
the
 
supervision
 
of
 
a
 
licensed
 
occupational
 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_232686].
 
Participants
 
who
 
scored
 
within
 
the
 
mild-to-moderate
 
range
 
(18–55)
 
on
 
the
 
screening
 
were
 
eligible
 
for
 
admission
 
into
 
the
 
study
 
and
 
proceeded
 
to
 
pretesting.
 
Pre-testing
 
and
 
post-testing
 
were
 
conducted
 
by
 
a
 
different
 
NKU
 
occupational
 
therapy
 
doctoral
 
student,
 
also
 
supervised
 
by
 
a
 
licensed
 
occupational
 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541],
 
who
 
had
 
demonstrated
 
competency
 
in
 
administering
 
the
 
Montreal
 
Cognitive
 
Assessment
 
(MoCA)
 
and
 
The
 
Observational
 
Measurement
 
of
 
Engagement-Modified
 
(OME-Modified)
 
to
 
minimize
 
bias.
 
The
 
MoCA
 
and
 
OME-Modified
 
were
 
administered
 
to
 
participants
 
as
 
primary
 
outcome
 
measures
 
to
 
evaluate
 
levels
 
of
 
cognitive
 
impairment
 
and
 
engagement.
 
The
 
MoCA
 
is
 
a
 
standardized
 
tool
 
that
 
assesses
 
cognitive
 
domains:
 
attention,
 
executive
 
functions,
 
short-term
 
and
 
working
 
memory ,
 
language,
 
visuospatial,
 
and
 
orientation
 
(Nasreddine,
 
2017).
 
Scores
 
range
 
from
 
0
 
to
 
30,
 
with
 
scores
 
of
 
18
 
to
 
25
 
indicating
 
mild
 
impairment,
 
10
 
to
 
17
 
indicating
 
moderate,
 
and
 
0
 
to
 
9
 
indicating
 
severe
 
(Nasreddine,
 
2017).
 
The
 
MoCA
 
was
 
selected
 
due
 
to
 
its
 
sensitivity
 
to
 
changes
 
in
 
cognition
 
(Julayanont
 
et
 
al.,
 
2013).
 
 
 
The
 
OME-Modified
 
assessed
 
engagement
 
through
 
the
 
assessment
 
of
 
a
 
participant’ s
 
response
 
to
 
a
 
stimulus
 
during
 
an
 
activity ,
 
taking
 
note
 
of
 
their
 
attention
 
and
 
attitude
 
using
 
standardized
 
rating
 
scales.
 
The
 
OME-Modified
 
was
 
selected
 
due
 
to
 
its
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
core
 
outcomes,
 
ease
 
of
 
use
 
in
 
an
 
applied
 
setting,
 
high
 
intra-class
 
correlation
 
value
 
(.78),
 
and
 
high
 
inter-rater
 
reliability
 
(0.84
 
–
 
0.92)
 
(Cohen-Mansfield
 
et
 
al.,
 
2010).
 
Participants
 
performed
 
each
 
assessment
 
on
 
alternate
 
days
 
to
 
limit
 
cognitive
 
fatigue.

psychological
 
well-being
 
in
 
this

instead
 
of

There
 
is
 
also
 
a
 
risk
 
that
 
participants’
 
identifiable
 
information
 
could
 
be
 
accidentally
 
disclosed
 
in
 
a

(anxious/depressed)
 
to

(Spector

The

not

but
 
were
 
discussed
 
at
 
the
 
end

The

involved
 
participants
 
raising
 
their

to
 
indicate
 
if
 
they
 
liked

data
 
will
 
be
 
explored
 
in
 
a
 
future
 
retrospective
 
study .
 
At
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
7-week
 
period,
 
participants
 
performed
 
the
 
OME-Modified
 
and
 
MoCA
 
for
 
the
 
posttest
 
outcome
 
measures
 
again.
 
During
 
post-test
 
administration
 
of
 
the
 
OME-Modified,
 
participants
 
who
 
demonstrated
 
limited
 
interest
 
in
 
the
 
initial
 
stimulus
 
were
 
retested
 
using
 
an
 
alternative
 
stimulus.
 
This
 
adjustment
 
was
 
made
 
because
 
the
 
high
 
stimulation
 
of
 
CST
 
sessions
 
may
 
have
 
reduced
 
the
 
appeal
 
of
 
the
 
pre-test
 
stimulus,
 
potentially
 
affecting
 
the
 
accuracy
 
of
 
results.
 
Ethical
 
Considerations
 
During
 
the
 
study ,
 
participants
 
were
 
free
 
to
 
change
 
their
 
minds
 
and
 
withdraw
 
from
 
the
 
study
 
at
 
any
 
time
 
without
 
penalty .
 
Participants
 
were
 
allowed
 
to
 
refuse
 
treatment
 
on
 
any
 
given
 
day
 
for
 
any
 
reason.
 
During
 
sessions,
 
participants
 
also
 
had
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
leave
 
the
 
study
 
or
 
decline
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
specific
 
group
 
activities
 
(e.g.,
 
warm-up
 
song)
 
without
 
any
 
negative
 
consequences.
 
During
 
evaluation
 
and
 
assessment,
 
participants
 
could
 
skip
 
any
 
questions
 
they
 
did
 
not
 
wish
 
to
 
answer .
 
Whatever
 
the
 
participant
 
decided
 
would
 
not
 
result
 
in
 
any
 
loss
 
of
 
benefits
 
or
 
services
 
to
 
which
 
they
 
were
 
otherwise
 
entitled.

Data
 
were
 
analyzed
 
using
 
IBM

(Version

Demographic
 
characteristics
 
were
 
analyzed
 
using
 
descriptive
 
statistics.
 
Normality
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
was
 
assessed
 
using
 
the
 
Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]-W ilk
 
test,
 
which
 
indicated
 
that
 
the
 
majority
 
violated
 
assumptions
 
of
 
parametric
 
testing
 
(Gil
 
et
 
al.,
 
2022).
 
A
 
one-tailed
 
Wilcoxon
 
signed-rank
 
test
 
was
 
conducted
 
to
 
assess
 
pre-

post-intervention
 
outcomes
 
(Gil
 
et
 
al.,
 
2022;

To
 
reduce
 
a
 
Type

error
 
from
 
multiple

a
 
Bonferroni

was
 
applied
 
to
 
adjust
 
the
 
significance
 
level
 
to
 
p

for
 
the

Confidence

not

due
 
to

and

limitations.
 
Due
 
to
 
the
 
statistical
 
probability
 
of
 
change
 
in
 
subtests,
 
descriptive
 
statistics
 
were
 
used
 
to
 
determine
 
whether
 
the
 
performance
 
in
 
MoCA
 
and
 
OME-Modified
 
subtests
 
increased,
 
decreased,
 
or
 
maintained.
 
 
Data
 
inclusion
 
was
 
predetermined
 
at
 
50%
 
attendance,
 
equivalent
 
to
 
attending
 
at
 
least
 
two-thirds
 
of
 
each
 
session
 
and
 
7/14
 
sessions.
 
Participants
 
outside
 
this
 
criterion
 
were
 
classified
 
as
 
dropouts
 
and
 
excluded,
 
with
 
their
 
data
 
removed.
 
This
 
approach
 
ensured
 
that
 
the
 
analysis
 
reflected
 
outcomes
 
from
 
participants
 
who
 
meaningfully
 
engaged
 
in
 
the
 
intervention.

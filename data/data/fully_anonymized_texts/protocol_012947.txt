TITLE A 26-week Randomized, Double- blind, Placebo-controlled, 
Dose -ranging Phase 2 Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of 
SAR425899 in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION Multinational 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT Phase 2 
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) 
 Primary objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess the dose-response 
relationship of SAR425899 versus placebo in terms of glycemic 
control as measured by [CONTACT_715706] 
(HbA
1c) from baseline to Week 26.  
Secondary objectives: 
• To assess the effect of once daily dosing of SAR425899 on body weight over 26 weeks. 
• To assess the safety and immunogenicity profile of SAR425899 when administered as daily subcutaneous 
(SC) injections over 26 weeks, including assessment of the 
heart rate (HR) change from baseline to Week 26 by 
[CONTACT_53402] (ECG) and Holter monitor. 
• To assess the proportion of patients achieving predefined 
HbA1c targets of <7% and <6.5% as well as the proportion 
of patients achieving ≥5% and ≥10% body weight loss at 
Week 26. 
• To assess the effect of once daily dosing of SAR425899 
on additional parameters of glycemic control and lipid 
metabolism. 
• To assess the effect of once daily dosing of SAR425899 on additional pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers. 
• To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and parameters of SAR425899, inter-individual and  
inter-occasion variability in PK parameters using a 
population PK approach. 
Exploratory objectives: 
• To assess and compare the safety and efficacy of SAR425899 versus open-label liraglutide from baseline to 
Week 26. 
• To explore SAR425899 PK/PD relationships for glycemic parameters, body weight loss and heart rate. 
• To assess the treatment effects in each group on  patient-reported outcomes. 
• To assess the treatment effects in each group on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cardiovascular 
biomarkers.

DRI13940  Version number: [ADDRESS_974796] (IMP; ie, dose of SAR425899 or matching placebo) is not 
blinded. 
Patients will be assigned to 1 of the 7 treatment arms: 3 SAR425899 
treatment arms with 3 different dose levels (60 patients per arm), 
3 matching SAR425899 placebo treatment arms (10 patients per 
arm), and 1 liraglutide arm (active co mparator arm with 60 patients).  
For the biostatistical analyses, data from the 3 SAR425899 placebo arms will be pooled into 1 placebo group (30 patients total). 
The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_715707]
1c (<8.0% 
versus ≥ 8.0%) and Visit 4 (Day 1) body mass index (BMI; 
<35.0 kg/m2 versus ≥35.0 kg/m2). 
Up to 50% of patients will perform additional assessments: meal test 
and Holter monitor. Full PK will be performed in a subset of 
40 patients. 
The study will include a 3-week screening period, a 26-week 
treatment period, and a 3-day pos t treatment follow-up period. 
In case of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or HbA 1c (assessed by 
[CONTACT_12115]) above predefi ned thresholds and if no reasons 
can be found for insufficient glucose control, it is recommended to add rescue therapy. The choice of rescue therapy is at the 
Investigator’s discretion with the exception of using glucagon-like 
petide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) 
inhibitors.  
Thresholds:  
• FPG >270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) from baseline Visit 4 
(Week 0) to Visit 9 (Week 8, including value at Visit 9).  
• FPG >240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) from Visit 9 (Week 8) to Visit 10 (Week 14). 
• FPG >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1C >8% from Visit 10 (Week 14) to Visit 12 (Week 26). 
All assessments planned in Visit 12 are to be performed before 
initiating rescue therapy. After these assessments are completed and rescue therapy initiated, the patient will remain in the study and 
continue to administer the study treatment (including background 
therapy). The planned visits and assessments should be performed until the last scheduled visit.

ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE The schedule of study-related procedures/assessments is detailed in 
the Study Flowchart. 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination:   
For the primary endpoint of change in HbA 1c from baseline to 
Week 26, a sample size of 60 patients per arm of SAR425899 and 
30 patients in the placebo group (pool of the 3 placebo arms) will provide 80% power to detect a difference of 0.7% in the HbA
1c 
change from baseline to Week 26 between a dose group of SAR425899 and placebo (standard deviation [SD] 1.1%; 
5% significance level 2-sided). 
The total sample size will be 270 patients to be randomized over 
7 arms (3 SAR425899 dose arms of 60 patients each, 3 matching 
placebo arms with a total of 30 patients [10 patients per arm], and 
1 active comparator arm of liraglutide 1.8 mg of 60 patients). 
Analysis population: 
The primary efficacy population w ill be the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population, which includes all randomized patients. Patients will be 
analyzed in efficacy analyses by [CONTACT_715709] (IRT) (as 
randomized). 
Safety analyses will be based on the safety population, defined as all 
randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of IMP. Patients will 
be analyzed for safety analyses according to the treatment actually 
received.  For a patient randomized to a SAR425899 treatment arm, 
the patient will be analyzed in the treatment he/she receives starting Week 8 visit (inclusive) when no adjus tment of dose level is allowed. 
However, for a patient randomized to a SAR425899 treatment arm and discontinues the IMP before Week [ADDRESS_974800] dose level that the patient is exposed from Week 8 visit or 
later. If a patient is treated with both placebo and SAR425899 any time during the study, the patient will be analyzed in the SAR425899 
treatment arm.  Liraglutide patients will be included in the Liraglutide 
treatment arm regardless of dose amount patients receive.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 9 Primary endpoint analysis: 
The primary efficacy endpoint of c hange in HbA1c from baseline to 
Week 26 will be analyzed with missing values imputed by  
[CONTACT_66727]-based multiple imputation method under the missing not at random frame work. 
• For placebo group patients, missing data will be imputed 
based on the placebo group data. 
• For patients in the SAR425899 groups, missing data will be imputed as if the patients were on placebo group 
throughout the study. 
Each of the complete dataset will be analyzed by [CONTACT_400296] (ANCOVA) model with treatment groups (SAR425899 
0.12 mg, SAR425899 0.16 mg, SAR425899 0.20 mg, placebo and liraglutide), randomization strata of screening HbA1c value (<8, 
≥8 %), randomization strata of Visit 4 (Day 1) BMI (<35.0 kg/m
2, 
≥35.0 kg/m2), and country as fixed effects, and baseline HbA1c 
value as a covariate. Results from each complete dataset will be 
combined to provide the adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 for each treatment group, as well as the 
between-group difference (compar ing each SAR425899 dose group 
versus placebo) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference. 
HbA1c values at baseline and Week 26 (observed or imputed) 
regardless of treatment discontinuati on or initiation of rescue therapy 
will be used. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints: Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints:
 
All continuous secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 26 will be 
analyzed using the same ANCOVA model with missing values imputed by [CONTACT_66727]-based multiple imputation method. Means and 
adjusted means of each treatment group will be provided, as well as 
adjusted mean and associated two-sided 95% CI of the differences between each SAR425899 dose group and placebo group. The 
analyses include values at baseline and Week 26 (observed or 
imputed) regardless of treatment discontinuation or initiation of 
rescue therapy. 
All categorical secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method stratified on randomization 
strata. The proportion in each tr eatment group will be provided, as 
well as the difference of proportions between each SAR425899 dose 
group and placebo with associated 2-sided 95% CI. For HbA1c and 
body weight responders, all values at Week [ADDRESS_974801] received rescue therapy duri ng the 26-week treatment period 
will be summarized.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 10  Safety analysis  
Safety analyses for the 26-week treatment period will be descriptive, 
based on the safety population (randomized and exposed).  
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs 
that developed or worsened or became serious during the period 
from the administration of first dose of the study treatments up to [ADDRESS_974802] administration. 
Interim analysis 
An interim analysis for body weight will be conducted when 
108 patients (about 24 patients per dose arm of SAR425899 and 
liraglutide and 12 patients from the SAR425899 placebo arm) have 
been randomized and completed 14 weeks of treatment. Descriptive 
statistics will be used to summarize the body weight results and the 
changes from baseline by [CONTACT_150138]. Potentially an interim analysis for PK/PD will be conducted when 60% of 
patients have completed the end of treatment visit. An internal 
sponsor team, independent of the study team, will perform the analysis, which is for internal project planning purposes. It will not 
lead to changes in the conduct of this protocol.  Only those 
necessary for the analysis and project planning will have the access 
to the interim analysis results before study completion.  Study team 
and investigational sites will continue to be blinded to individual randomization codes except for t he open-label liraglutide until after 
study completion and database lock.  
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per patient)  The study duration is approxim ately 30 weeks (3-week screening 
period, 26-week treatment period,  3-day post treatment follow-up 
period).

a In case of rescue therapy, all assessments planned in V12 should be performed before starting rescue therapy, patients then con tinue the study treatment (including metformin), and all visits and assessments 
should be performed as scheduled.  In case of premature permanent IMP discontinuation, patients should have a visit as soon as possible with the assessments normally planned in V12 (the standardized meal 
test and PK collections are performed only if the patient receives the IMP the day of the visit, note that otherwise predose PK sample can be taken if the patient receives the IMP the day before). Afterward, the 
patients should continue in the study up to the scheduled date of study completion. They should be followed up according to the  study procedures as specified in the protocol (except for the [ADDRESS_974803]-
treatment and PK assessment). If the patient drops out from the study at the time of IMP discontinuation regardless if the pati ent receives the IMP or not on the day of the meal test, the meal test should be 
performed. However, PK collections are performed only if the patient receives the IMP the day of the visit, otherwise predose P K sample can be taken if the patient receives the IMP the day before. 
b Weight will be recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg and should be measured using calib rated scales.  The same pair of scales should p referably be used throughout the trial.  Weight should be measured in the fasting 
state in the morning at approximately the same time with an empty bladder, without shoes and only wearing undergarments or ligh t clothing.  Weight measured at screening Visit 1 will be used only for calculation 
of screening BMI for eligibility cr iteria whereas weight measured at Visit 4 w ill be used as baseline fo r assessment of change in body weight and for calculation of baseline BMI which will be the BMI value used for 
stratification.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an endogenous enteroendocrine hormone secreted by L-cells 
of the distal intestine in response to oral nutri ent ingestion.  Glucagon-like peptide-1 has multiple 
physiologic effects that contribute to ameliorating hyperglycemia in the treatment of type-2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  These effects include enhancing insulin secretion from pancreatic  β-cells in a glucose dependent manner, suppre ssing glucagon secretion, and slowing gastric 
emptying ( 1).  Glucagon-like peptide-1 also enhances satiety with subseque nt reduction in food 
intake thereby [CONTACT_274651].  About 80% of patients with T2DM are overweight or 
obese.  Many of the available cl asses of treatment options for T2DM (eg, sulfonylureas, glinides, 
thiazolidenediones, and insulin) are actually associ ated with promoting weight gain, a distressing 
side effect for patients already struggling with  excess body weight and one that may adversely 
impact adherence to therapy ( 2).  In recent years, a new class of pharmacotherapy for T2DM has 
emerged in the form of GLP-[ADDRESS_974820] as a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of obesity/T2DM is ox yntomodulin (OXM).  Like GLP-1, OXM is secreted by L-cells 
of the distal gut and is also derived fro m the same precursor peptide proglucagon.  
Oxyntomodulin is a dual agonist at both the GL P-[ADDRESS_974821] and suppresses food intake ( 3).  However, glucagon 
has additionally been shown to in crease energy expenditure (EE) ( 4).  Therefore, it has been 
hypothesized that activation of both GLP-[ADDRESS_974822] of 
reduced food intake along with enhanced energy expenditure could be expected to produce greater weight loss than simply decreasing food intake al one (as in the case with pure GLP-[ADDRESS_974823]).  Studies conducted in obese mice treated  with OXM versus a selective GLP-1-receptor 
agonist that did not exert any significant glucagon receptor activity support this hypothesis as OXM administration led to superior weight loss with similar glucose lowering activity compared to the GLP-[ADDRESS_974824] group ( 5).  Additional work conducted in GLP-[ADDRESS_974825] also yielded results that implicate 
activation of the glucagon receptor as a component  to driving the weight loss observed with OXM 
(6).  Finally, OXM has also been suggested as a potential contributing factor in the metabolic 
improvements associated with bariatric surgery when it was observed that OXM concentrations 
rise markedly in response to oral glucose in morbidly obese women with T2DM who had 
undergone recent gastric by[CONTACT_4897] ( 6). 
Although activation of the glucagon receptor increases blood glucose levels, simultaneous 
activation of the GLP-1 receptor could potentiall y counterbalance this (v ia a GLP-1 stimulated 
increase in insulin release with subsequent inhib ition of gluconeogenesis) and prevent undesirable 
hyperglycemia.  This concept was supported by a rodent study which showed that OXM administration ameliorated glucose intolerance in mice fed a high-fat diet ( 7).  Other preclinical 
studies with synthetic dual agonists of the GLP- [ADDRESS_974826] 
demonstrated similarly promising results in terms of weight loss as well as improvements in additional metabolic parameters, including antihyperglycemic effects ( 8, 9).  Likewise, a study of 
coinfusion of GLP-1 and glucagon in overweight/o bese humans demonstrated an increase in EE

another study of coadministration of GLP-[ADDRESS_974827] glucagon-induced hyperglycemia ( 11). 
Oxyntomodulin administration has also been st udied in humans and has been shown to produce 
effects on body weight reduction, suppressi on of food intake, and increase in EE ( 12, 13).  
Furthermore, OXM administered as a single dos e to males with T2DM was shown to blunt 
glucose excursions during a continuous glucose in fusion to an extent that was comparable to 
liraglutide administration in the same study ( 14).  Based on this finding, the authors hypothesize 
that OXM, a dual agonist of the GLP-[ADDRESS_974828] of the GLP-1 and glucag on receptors, and is being developed for the 
treatment of patients with T2DM who are overw eight/obese.  Preclinical  studies conducted in 
several animal models (rats, DIO mice, db/db mic e, and monkeys) have demonstrated reductions 
in blood glucose and body weight as well as increase in EE (shown in mice) with SAR425899 
administration or its tool molecule surrogate.  Nonclinical pharmacology data and available preclinical toxicology results for SAR425899 are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  Recently, the phase 1 study (TDR13700) conducted in both healthy volunteers and patients with 
T2DM was completed.  The effect of SAR425899 on glucose lowering and weight reduction was 
observed in the study.  There are no safety concer ns from these completed studies to preclude the 
planning of the DRI study. 
Study DRI13940 is a 26-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ranging 
Phase [ADDRESS_974829] of a 3-w eek screening period, a 26-week treatment period, 
and a 3-day follow-up period.  The primary objec tive of study DRI13940 is to assess the dose 
response relationship of SAR425899 versus placebo in terms of glycemic control as measured by 
[CONTACT_715711] (HbA
1c) from baseline to Week 26.  The main secondary 
objectives are to assess safety of SAR425899 as we ll as its effect on body weight.  The inclusion 
of an active comparator arm with liraglutide (Victoza®) is intended to help be stow further clinical 
perspective on the safety and efficacy of SAR425899 in this study.

[IP_ADDRESS] Metformin 
Background treatment with metformin is considered as a noninve stigational medicinal product 
(NIMP). 
Metformin should be administered orally accord ing to the local product labeling.  Metformin 
should be used at a stable dose of at least 1500 mg/day or at the maximal tolerated dose for at 
least 3 months prior to screening (Visit 1). The doses of metformin (if applicable) should be continued and should remain stable throughout 
the study unless there is a specific safety issue related to this treatment. 
The background treatment is to be reported in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
The cost of the background treatment (metformin),  if not covered by [CONTACT_715716], can be 
reimbursed where permitted by [CONTACT_427]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Diet and exercise 
Lifestyle and diet therapy followed before the time of screening is to be continued during the 
study.  Counseling will be provided by a healthca re professional at screening Visit 3 or Visit 4, 
and Visit 10, and should be consiste nt with international or local guidelines for patients with

For SAR425899, a double-blind design has been set up.  The cartridges, containing either 
SAR425899 or matching placebo solution for injecti on, are indistinguishable to preserve the 
double-blind.  The dose level is not blinded as the volume to be injected and the number of kits 
dispensed is different between the doses.

DRI13940  Version number: [ADDRESS_974842] acebo is labeled with a treatment kit number, 
which is generated by a computer program from the Sponsor.  In accordance with the 
double-blind design, Investigator s will remain blinded to stud y treatment on SAR425899/placebo 
(dose level not blinded) and will not have access to the randomiza tion (treatment codes) except 
under exceptional medical circumstances described in Section  8.3.2.  Consequently, the double 
blinded will be maintain ed on SAR425899/placebo (dose level not blinded).  
Liraglutide (Victoza®) kits are under open-label design. 
The Investigator and the Sponsor will not have ac cess to the data of the primary efficacy endpoint 
(ie, HbA1c) nor to FPG, or the data of the meal test endpoints (postp randial plasma glucose 
[PPG], and blood glucose excursion, insulin, proins ulin, and C peptide and associated excursion 
values) obtained after baseline visit until V12 (Week  26), or until End of Treatment visit in case 
of premature treatment discontinuation. In case th e central laboratory detects a FPG or HbA1c 
above the rescue threshold the investigator will receive an alert by [CONTACT_2237]. CAC 
members will review and adjudicate major cardiovascular events in a blinded manner (please refer to Section  6.4.2). PSAC members will review and adjudicate pancreatic events in a blinded 
manner (please refer to Section  6.4.1). The DMC will receive unblinded, closed reports from an 
independent statistical group for review (see Section  6.4.3). These reports will have to be handled 
strictly confidentially. None of these reports  may be delivered to unauthorized persons. 
However, the study team may review the data for the primary efficacy parameter in descriptive statistics for the overall treatment during data review meetings. An independent programmer will generate the descriptive statistics for HbA1c, FPG and meal test related parameters. 
Refer to Section  10.5 for suspected unexpected serious adve rse drug reaction unblinding by [CONTACT_429]. 
8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study 
In case of an adverse event (AE), the code should only be broken in circumstances when 
knowledge of the IMP is required for treating the patient.  Code breaking can be performed at any time by  [CONTACT_715717] (IRT) and/or by [CONTACT_715718] y other phone number provided by [CONTACT_715719].  If the blind is broken, the Inve stigator should document the date, time of day,

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 39 The randomization and treatment a llocation are performed centrally by [CONTACT_18603] (IRT): 
• The study biostatistician provi des the randomization scheme and the IRT generates the 
patient randomization list (including stratification) according to which it allocates 
treatment groups to the patients and the corresponding treatment kits. 
• Patients will be randomized to 1 of the fo llowing treatment arms during the 26-weeks 
according to a randomization ratio of 6:6:6:1:1:1:6: 
- SAR425899 0.12 mg, 
- SAR425899 0.16 mg, 
- SAR425899 0.20 mg, 
- Placebo 0.12 mg, 
- Placebo 0.16 mg, 
- Placebo 0.20 mg, 
- Liraglutide 1.8 mg. 
The randomization is stratified by [CONTACT_277125] 1c value (<8.0% versus ≥8.0%) and Visit 4 
(Day 1) BMI (<35.0 kg/m2 versus ≥35.0 kg/m2).   
At screening visit, the Investigator or designee ha s to contact [CONTACT_715720].  The patient identification (Patient number) is composed of a 12-digit number containing 
the 3-digit country code, the 4-digit center code, and the 5-digit patient chronological number (which is [ADDRESS_974844] patient screened in a center, [ZIP_CODE] for the second patient screened in 
the same center, etc). 
On V4 (Day 1), assessment results are reviewed  and baseline assessments are completed. After 
confirming that the patient is eligible for randomization, the IRT is called, the investigator or 
designee has to provide some information (s uch as patient number provided by [CONTACT_715721], date of birth/ dummy date of birth, etc.). The first treatment kit(s) are then 
allocated by [CONTACT_6606]. Afterwards the IRT is called again each time a new treatment kit(s) 
allocation is necessary, ie, at V6 (Week 2), V8  (Week 4) and V9 (Week 8), V10 (Week 14), and 
V11 (Week 20). 
The IRT will allocate sufficient treatment kits numbers until the next on-site visit.  In some 
specific circumstances, eg, damaged kit, the Investigator can perform a “replacement call” to the IRT to obtain an additional treatment kit. 
A randomized patient is defined as a patient who is allocated a tr eatment kit number by [CONTACT_6606] , 
and recorded in the IRT database, regardless of  whether the treatment kit was used or not.  
A patient cannot be randomized more than once in  the study. In cases where original screen 
failure is due to reasons expected to change (e xcept for HbA1c) at rescreening and based upon the 
Investigator’s clinical judgment, the patient can be rescreened one time for this study.

IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP us ed in the clinical trial is securely maintained 
as specified by [CONTACT_328730]. 
All IMPs will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the 
Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or us e of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labelin g, expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], etc) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by [CONTACT_429]. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by [CONTACT_1034], in order to reca ll the IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party (except for Direct To Patient (DTP) shipment, for which a courier comp any has been approved by [CONTACT_1034]), allow 
the IMP to be used other than as directed by [CONTACT_400322], or dispose of IMP in any 
other manner. 
8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
Measures taken to ensure and document treatment compliance and IMPs accountability include: 
• Proper recording of treatment kit number or packaging number as required on appropriate 
eCRF page for accounting purposes. 
• All medication treatment kits (whether empty or unused) are returned by [CONTACT_181261] a treatment dispensing is planned. 
• The Investigator or his/her delegate tracks treatment accountability/compliance comparing 
the treatment number recorded on the patient di ary with the treatment number of returned 
treatment kits (whether empty or unused) and fills in the patie nt treatment log. 
• The monitor in charge of the study then checks the data entered on the IMPs administration page by [CONTACT_715722]. 
• For the NIMP not provided by [CONTACT_37922], tracking and reconciliation will be 
documented in patient’s source documents and reported in appropriate eCRF pages. 
8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments 
A detailed treatment log of the destroyed IMP and NIMP will be established with the Investigator (or the pharmacist) and countersigned by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator and the monitoring team.  The 
Investigator will not destroy the used and unused IMP unless the Sponsor provides written 
authorization. 
For NIMP reimbursed by [CONTACT_1034], tracking and reconciliation will be achieved by [CONTACT_3786] (or the pharmacist, if appropriate) acc ording to the system proposed by [CONTACT_1034].

A concomitant medication is any treatment received by [CONTACT_56449](s). 
8.8.1 Prohibited medications 
Use of the following medications will not be permitted during the study: 
• Weight control treatment, including any medi cation with a labelled reference to weight 
loss or weight gain.  
• Systemic glucocorticoid use for more than 7 days. 
• Any antidiabetic treatment other than IMP,  authorized background antidiabetic therapy 
and rescue therapy, if necessary.   
• GLP-1 receptor agonists or dipeptid yl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors. 
• Drugs that affect gastrointestinal motility (eg, chronic use of anticholinergics, 
antispasmodics, 5HT3 antagonists, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]). 
• Medications that may cause significant weight gain such as antipsychotic medications, tricyclic antidepressants, and mood stabilizer s (eg, imipramine, amitr yptiline, mirtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
paroxetine, phenelzine, chlorpromazine, thiorida zine, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], valproic acid 
and its derivatives, and lith ium), and growth hormone. 
• Cannabis, even if prescribed for medical reasons. 
8.8.2 Rescue therapy 
In case of FPG or HbA1c above pre-defined th resholds and if no reasons can be found for 
insufficient glucose control, it is recommended to add rescue therapy. 
Central laboratory alerts on FPG and HbA1c are set up to ensure that glycemic parameters remain 
under predefined threshold values (see hereinafter).  
The threshold values are defined as  follows, depending on study period: 
From baseline Visit 4 (Week 0) to Visit 9 (Week 8, including value at Visit 9): FPG >270 mg/dL 
(15.0 mmol/L). From Visit 9 (Week 8) to Visit 10 (Week 14): FPG > 240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L). From Visit 10 (Week 14) to Visit 12 (Week 26): FPG>200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c>8%. In case of FPG / HbA1c above the threshold va lues, the investigator should ensure that no 
reasonable explanation exists for insufficient glucose control, and in particular that:  
• Plasma glucose was actually measured in fas ting condition (ie, after at least [ADDRESS_974847]). 
• Investigational product is given at planned dose.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 43 • There is no intercurrent disease, which may jeopardize glycemic control (eg, infectious 
disease). 
• Compliance with treatment is appropriate. 
• Compliance with diet and lifestyle is appropriate. 
If any of the above can reasonably explain the in sufficient glycemic control, the investigator 
should undertake appropriate action, ie, 
• Dose increase of investiga tional product according to prot ocol (if tolerance allows). 
• Set up adequate investigation and treatment of intercurrent  disease (to be reported in 
AE/concomitant medication parts of the eCRF). 
• Stress on the absolute need to be compliant with treatment. 
• Organize a specific interview with a Registered Dietician or other qualified nutrition 
professional and stress on the absolute need to be compliant to diet and lifestyle 
recommendations, and check a FPG / HbA1 c assessment at the next visit. 
If none from the above-mentioned reasons can be found, or if appropriate action fails to decrease FPG / HbA1c under the threshold values, rescue medication ma y be introduced. 
The choice of rescue therapy is at the investigat or’s discretion with the exception of using GLP-[ADDRESS_974848] udy treatment (including backgr ound therapy). The planned visits 
and assessments should be performed  until the last scheduled visit.

The same scale should be used throughout the study, and calibrated on a regular basis as 
recommended by [CONTACT_3455].  The use of bala nce scales is recommended; if digital scales 
are used, testing with standard weights is of par ticular importance.  The floor surface on which the 
scale rests must be hard and should not be carpeted or covered with other soft material.  The scale 
should be balanced with both weights at zero and the balance bar alig ned.  The patient should 
stand in the center of the platform as standing off-center may affect measurement.  The weights 
are moved until the beam balances (the arrows are aligned).  The weight is read and recorded in the eCRF and source data.  Self-reported weights are not acceptable; patients must not read the scales themselves. 
Body weight will be measured on days indicated in the flow chart (see Section  1.2). Weight 
should be measured in the fasting state in the morning at approximately the same time with an 
empty bladder, without shoes and only wearing undergarments or light clothing.  Weight 
measured at screening Visit 1 will be used only for calculation of screening BMI for eligibility 
criteria whereas weight measured at Visit 4 will be used as baseline for assessment of change in body weight and for calculation of baseline BMI which will be the BMI value used for stratification.

The observation period of safety data will be divided into 3 segments: 
• The pretreatment period is defined as the time between the date of the informed consent 
and the first injection of IMP. 
• The on-treatment period is defined as the time from the first injection of IMP up to 3 days (1 day for hypoglycemia) after the last injec tion of IMP, regardless of the introduction of 
rescue therapy.  The 3-day interval is chosen based on the half-life of the IMP 
(approximately 5 times the half-life of SAR425899). 
• The post treatment period is defined as the time starting [ADDRESS_974861] injection of IMP 
(after the on-treatment period). 
The baseline value for safety endpoints will be the last available value prior to the first injection 
of IMP. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events 
All AEs/SAEs will be coded to a “Lower Level Term (LLT)”, “Preferred Term (PT)”, “High Level Term (HLT)”, “High-Level Group Term (HLGT)” and associated primary “System Organ Class (SOC)” using the version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) currently in effect at the sponsor at the time of  database lock. MedDRA terms for hypersensitivity 
and injection site reactions will be included.  The occurrence of AE/SAEs is recorded from the time of signed informed consent until the end of the study. 
Refer to Section  10.4 to Section  10.7 for details.

The IW-SP is a validated questionna ire to assess an individual’s sel f-perception related to his or 
her weight.  It was developed with moderately obese individuals with T2DM (BMI 25 to 
40 kg/m²) ( 19).  It includes 3 items on unhappi[INVESTIGATOR_715701], self-consciousness in social 
situations, and overall self-perception, evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale (from 1 [always] to 5 [never]).  A total score is calculated by [CONTACT_10621] [ADDRESS_974873] psychometric 
properties in patients with T2DM and BMI >30 kg/m² and was able to discriminate patients who achieved at least 5% weight loss from others who did not. 
In addition of the 3 PRO questionna ires, patients will be asked to an swer questions at the end of 
the treatment period (Week 26).  This patient qualitative assessment of treatment aims to better 
understand patients’ views on benefits and disadvantages of the treatment they experienced during 
the trial.  The two first questions will ask patients to describe in free text the benefits and 
disadvantages of the drug they experienced during the trial.  A third question will ask patients if they would be willing to pursue the treatment they had during the trial (yes/no) and to describe the reasons in free text.  Finally, patients will be asked to give their perception of the drug benefit-risk on 7-point Likert scale ranging from -3 (disadvant ages significantly outweigh the benefits) to 3 
(Benefits significantly outweigh the disadvanta ges) and where 0 corresponds to ‘Equal benefits 
and disadvantages’.  This patie nt qualitative assessment should ta ke between 10 and 20 minutes.  
Patients’ answers to the [ADDRESS_974874] questions will be analyzed qualitatively. Due to the availability of this questionnaire only in Eng lish, it will be limited to English speakers in [LOCATION_002] and 
Canada only.

treatment of patients with T2DM who are ove rweight/obese.  Preclinical studies have 
demonstrated reductions in blood glucose and body weight as well as increase in energy 
expenditure with SAR425899 administration. 
The primary objective of this study is the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26. Several studies have document ed a reduced risk for the development and progression of 
complications of type [ADDRESS_974876] glycemic control with an HbA1c <7% 
according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and a more stringent goal of <6.5% for appr opriate patients. The duration of 
study treatment is considered to  be sufficient for achieving stable conditions with IMP and for 
enabling an adequate assessment of time-dependent changes in HbA1c. 
The problem of weight gain in type 2 diabet es is widely recognized. More than 80% of 
individuals with type 2 diabetes are overweight, many at the time of diagnosis. Consequently, 
iatrogenic weight gain is not only unwelcome, but re presents an important clinical issue that can 
become a barrier to the successful management of  glycemic control. Rece ntly, the phase 1 study 
(TDR13700) conducted in both healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM was completed.  The effect of SAR425899 on glucose lowering and we ight reduction was observed in the study. 
A number of biomarkers will be integrated into the trial, as these markers may serve to better 
understand the mechanism of action (MoA) of dual  agonism and confirm that target receptors 
were hit. For glucagon effects on lipid meta bolism and lipolysis ha ve been described. 
Increased heart rate has been linked to cardiovascular diseases. BNP and hs-CRP are added as biomarkers to evaluate the risk  of cardiovascular diseases ( 20). 
The therapeutic potential of GLP-1 analog in the treatment of NASH has been suggested recently. 
The change of NASH biomarkers will be evaluated in the study ( 21).

10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e.  In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort.  Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the eCRF.  In any case, the patient should remain in the study as long as possible. 
Pregnancy will lead to definitive treatment discontinuation in all cases.   
10.3.[ADDRESS_974885](s) 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be considered by [CONTACT_179639].  Reinitiation of treatment with the IMP will be done under cl ose and appropria te clinical/and 
or laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the responsibility of the IM P(s) in the occurrence of the concerned event 
was unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to Section  7.1 and 
Section  7.2).   
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, duration should be reco rded by [CONTACT_209480].  
Temporary treatment discontinuation decided by [CONTACT_715729] [ADDRESS_974886](s) 
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any tr eatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at 
any time. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_974887] of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Inve stigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to 
document the reason(s) for treatme nt discontinuation and this shoul d be documented in the eCRF.

DRI13940  Version number: 1 
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 72 Patients may withdraw from treatment with IMP in case of the following reasons: 
• At patient’s own request, ie, w ithdraw of consent for treatment. 
• If, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation with the administration of IMP would be 
detrimental to the patient’s well-being. 
• At the specific request of the sponsor. 
A patient must withdraw from treatment with IMP in case of the following:  
• Intercurent condition that requires discontinuation of IMP: eg, laboratory abnormalities (see decision tree and general guidance for the follow up of laboratory abnormalities in 
Appendix C ), diagnosis of acute pancreatitis confirmed by [CONTACT_495572] (see Section  10.6.4), calcitonin value ≥ 50pg/ml (see Section  10.6.6). 
• Pregnancy. 
• Systemic hypersensitivity reaction.  
Any code-breaking requested by [CONTACT_361569]. 
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG para meter will be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation (eg after 24 hours) before making a decision of pe rmanent discontinuation of the 
IMP for the concerned patient.   
Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Patients will be followed-up according to the study pr ocedures specified in this protocol up to the 
scheduled date of study completi on, or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be followed-
up as specified in this prot ocol, whichever comes last. 
If possible, and after the permanent discontinuation of treatment, the patients will be assessed 
using the procedure normally planned for the last dosing day with the IMP including a pharmacokinetics sample if already scheduled. 
All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation s hould be recorded by [CONTACT_327467]. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_974888] follow-up, eg, medical records check. 
If possible, the patients are assessed using the procedure normally planned for the end-of-study 
visit including a pharmacokinetics sample if already scheduled.  
Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their 
decision to withdraw consent, and any AE info rmation elicited should be  documented.  The site 
should document and sign the reason for the patient’s  failure to withdraw consent in writing.

at least the date of the withdrawal  and the reason should be documented. 
For patients who fail to return to the site, unle ss the patient withdraws consent for follow-up, the 
Investigator should make the best effort to rec ontact the patient (eg, contact [CONTACT_4676]’s family or 
private physician, review available registries or health care databases), a nd to determine his/her 
health status, including at least his/her vital status. Attempts to contact [CONTACT_101876]’s records (eg, times an d dates of attempted telephone contact, receipt 
for sending a registered letter). 
The statistical analysis plan will specify how these patients lost to follow-up for their primary 
endpoints will be considered. 
Patients who have withdraw n from the study cannot be rerandomized (treated) in the study. Their 
inclusion and treatment numb ers must not be reused. 
10.4 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 
10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessari ly have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious adverse event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or, 
• Is life-threatening, or, 
Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_56385], or, 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or, 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, 
• Is a medically important event, 
Medical and scientific judgme nt should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in othe r situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_400284] (ie, specific measures or corrective 
treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event of special interest 
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by [CONTACT_125478]. Such even ts may require further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand them.  Adverse events of special interest may be added, modified or 
removed during a study by [CONTACT_12548]. 
• Pregnancy of a female patient entered in a study as well as pregnancy occurring in a 
female partner of a male subject entered in a study with IMP/NIMP: 
- Pregnancy will be recorded as an AESI with immediate notification in all cases, 
- It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills one of the seriousness criteria 
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), 
- In the event of pregnancy in a female participant, IMP should be discontinued, 
- Follow-up of the pregnancy in a female partic ipant or in a female partner of a male 
participant is mandatory until the outcome has been determined.

authorities 
Not applicable. 
10.4.3 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
• All AEs, regardless of seriousness or rela tionship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the 
signature [CONTACT_206411] [CONTACT_56485], are to be recorded  on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of 
the eCRF. 
• Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. The Investigator should specify the date of ons et, intensity, action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, and his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_56390] a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_179646](s).  
• The Investigator should take appropriate measur es to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that

investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_400335].  
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until 
the end of the study as defined by [CONTACT_56485]. 
• Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if:  
- Symptomatic and/or,  
- Requiring either corrective trea tment or consu ltation, and/or,  
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or,  
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or,  
- Defined as an AESI. 
Instructions for AE reporting are summarized in Table [ADDRESS_974896] immediately: 
• ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the eCRF; the system will automatically send a notification to the monitoring team after approval of the Investigator within the eCRF or after a standard delay. 
• SEND (preferably by [CONTACT_3719] e-mail) a photocop y of all examinations carried out and the 
dates on which these examinations  were performed, to the representative of the monitoring 
team whose name, fax number, and email addr ess appear on the clin ical trial protocol. 
Care should be taken to ensure  that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's 
identifiers in the clinical trial are properly mentioned on any copy of a source document provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges. 
• All further data updates should be recorded in the eCRF as appropriate, and further 
documentation as well as additional information (for laboratory data, concomitant medications, patient status, etc)  should be sent (by [CONTACT_3719] e- mail) to the monitoring team 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the SAE. In addition, every effort should be made to further document any SAE that is fatal or life-threatening within a week (7 days) of the initial notification. 
• A back-up plan (using a paper case report form  [CRF] process) is available and should be 
used when the eCRF system does not work. 
Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the patient and considered by [CONTACT_12552]/her  to be caused by [CONTACT_56486] a reasonable possibility, should 
be reported to the monitoring team.

During the course of the study, the S ponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
• All SAEs that are both unexpected and at leas t reasonably related to the IMP (S[LOCATION_003]R), to 
the regulatory authorities, independent ethics committee (IECs)/institutional review boards 
(IRBs) as appropriate and to the Investigators.   
• All SAEs that are expected and at least reasonably related to the IMPs to the regulatory authorities, according to local regulations. 
Adverse events that are considered expected will be specified by [CONTACT_326927].  
For safety reason, the treatment code will be unb linded for reporting to the health authorities of 
any suspected unexpected serious adverse reactio n (S[LOCATION_003]R), ie, any SAE that is both unexpected 
(per the investigator’s brochure) and reasonably a ssociated with the use of the IMP according to 
either the judgment of the I nvestigator and/or the Sponsor. 
The Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct of the trial in the clinical 
study report. 
10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Hypoglycemia 
Hypoglycemic events will be categorized as follows: 
• Severe hypoglycemia: Se vere hypoglycemia is an event re quiring third party assistance of 
another person to actively administer carboh ydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative 
actions.  These epi[INVESTIGATOR_715703], unconsciousness or coma.  Plasma glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery  attributable to the restoration of plasma 
glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.  The defin ition of severe sympto matic hypoglycemia 
includes all epi[INVESTIGATOR_400683]-treatment and which were  thus thought to place patients at risk for injury to 
themselves or others.  Note that “requires third party assistance” means that the patient 
could not help himself or herself.  Assistin g a patient out of kindness, when assistance is 
not required, should not be considered a “requires assistance” incident. 
Severe hypoglycemia will be qualified as a SAE only if it fulfills SAE criteria.  All events 
of seizure, unconsciousness, or co ma must be reported as SAEs. 
• Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia:  Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event during which typi[INVESTIGATOR_394480] a measured plasma glucose concentration of ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).  Clinical symptoms that are 
considered to result from a hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_400287]: increased sweating, nervousness, asthenia/weakness, tremor, di zziness, increased a ppetite, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], 
headache, sleep disorder, confusion, seizures, unconsciousness, or coma.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 79 • Asymptomatic hypoglycemia: Asymptomatic hypoglycemia is an event not accompanied 
by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_10922]  a measured plasma glucose concentration 
less than or equal to 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). 
• Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia: Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event 
during which symptoms of hypoglycemia are not accompanied by a plasma glucose 
determination, but was presumably caused by a plasma glucose concen tration less than or 
equal to 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L); symptoms trea ted with oral carbohydrate without a test 
of plasma glucose. 
• Relative hypoglycemia: Relative hypoglycemia recently te rmed “pseudo-hypoglycemia” is 
an event during which the person with diabetes  reports any of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_647371], and interprets the symptoms as indicative of hypoglycemia, but with a measured plasma glucose concentration greater than 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), but approaching this level. 
Patients will be instructed to measure finger stick plasma glucose levels prior to the administration of carbohydrates whenever symptomatic hypoglyce mia is suspected, unless safety considerations 
necessitate immediate glucose re scue prior to confirmation, and then a glucose measurement 
should be performed as soon as safe, with appropriate diary doc umentation. Details on 
hypoglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_277099], and patients will contact [CONTACT_715732].

10.6.[ADDRESS_974898] AE page in the eCRF. 
10.6.3 Allergic or allergic-like reaction 
In case a patient experiences an allergic reaction or an allergic-like reaction, this has to be reported as an AE and recorded in the eCRF on th e specific AE form for suspected allergic event. 
Virtually all symptoms listed on the allergic reaction complementary form are possible adverse reactions that may be allergic in nature and ma y need to be addressed after medical judgment, 
excluding another etiology than allergy. 
Sometimes, transient injection site  reactions, irritant in nature may occur requiring no intervention 
and are of dubious significance.  These reactions would not be considered to be allergic reactions.  
Adverse events that are obviously not of allergic origin (eg, local injection site reactions) should 
not be recorded on the allergic reaction complementary form.

Potential safety signals for acute pancreatitis had been identified in the postmarketing experience 
of other GLP-1 receptor agonists.  Therefore, pa tients enrolled in this study should be followed 
for any suspected pancreatitis, eg, with symptoms and/or signs of acute abdominal distress or abnormal levels of pancreatic enzymes.  Serum amylase a nd lipase concentrations are monitored 
routinely at screening, baseline, and peri odically during the study treatment period. 
In the presence of clinical signs and/or symptoms evocative of pancreatitis, eg, persistent abdominal pain, which can radiate to the back, of ten with characteristic positional features, with 
possible occurrence of nausea, vomiting, fever and leucocytosis, further measurement of amylase and lipase should be performed.  The clinical sign s and/or symptoms should be documented in the 
source data.

MRI with contrast, as appropriate) must be perfo rmed.  Please document in the source data the 
absence of clinical signs and/or symptoms (if c linical signs and/or symptoms develop, please see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] below). 
Best clinical judgment is to be used when interpreting elevated serum amylase and lipase levels in 
asymptomatic patients.  Temporar y discontinuation of the IMP may be considered in these cases 
if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_737]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Elevation of amylase and/or lipase >[ADDRESS_974906] with clinical signs and/or symptoms 
In the presence of clinical signs and/or symptoms evocative of pancreatitis (as described above) associated with elevated amylase and/or lipase, treatment with the IMP should be promptly and at least temporarily discontinued pending further clinical evaluation and diagnosis confirmation. 
Clinical signs and/or symptoms are to be documented in the source data.  A laboratory 
determination of amylase and lipase has to be obtained at the time of the event and again within 48 hours or earlier as clinically indicated.  If the value(s) remain(s) >[ADDRESS_974907], then amylase and/or 
lipase levels should be retested as described in  Section [IP_ADDRESS]  above, or more of ten if clinically

specific complementary form for “increased calcitonin ≥20 pg/mL” with all appropriate 
clinical and laboratory documentation. 
• An ultrasound scan of the thyroid should be perfo rmed and the patient may be referred to a 
thyroid specialist if judged necessary. 
• The patient should continue to  be followed according to protocol schedule (including 
planned calcitonin measurements).  The specific AE form “increased calcitonin ≥20 pg/mL (5.9 pmol/L)” should be updated w ith any new information collected during 
the follow up. 
If at any time during further follow up a calcitonin value ≥ 50 pg/mL (14.75 pmol/L) is found, the 
patient should be permanentl y discontinued from IMP (see Section 10.3.3) and referred to a 
specialist.  As far as possible, blood should be collected 1 to 2 weeks after IMP discontinuation and sent to the central laboratory for calcitonin measurement. 
If at any time during follow-up a calcitonin value ≥20 pg/mL increases by 20 % or more between 
2 assessments (while remaining below50 pg/mL), a repeated measurement should be performed 
earlier than scheduled in the prot ocol, ie, 1 month later.  Once results are available, discussion 
with Sponsor should be initiated without delay for further guidance. 
10.6.7 Monitoring of renal function in case of prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting 
In case of prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting, if clinically indicated, serum creatinine 
measurement has to be centrally performed.  If there is an acute increase of serum creatinine, metformin has to be di scontinued until resolution of renal dysfunction.

For the primary endpoint of change in HbA 1c from baseline to Week 26, a sample size of 
60 patients per arm of SAR425899 and 30 patients in the placebo group (pool of the 3 placebo 
arms) will provide 80% power to detect a difference of 0.7% in the HbA 1c change from baseline to

All appendices attached hereto and referred to herein are made part of this clinical trial protocol. 
The Investigator should not implemen t any deviation from, or changes to the clinical trial protocol 
without agreement by [CONTACT_56527]/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_20291]/IEC and/or notification/approval of health authorities (competent regulatory 
authority) of an amendment, as required by [CONTACT_1295], except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to clinical trial patients, or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial. Any change  agreed upon will be recorded in writing, the 
written amendment will be signed by [CONTACT_56529]. 
Any amendment to the clinical trial protocol requires written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_56400]/IEC prior to its implementation, unl ess there are overriding safety reasons. 
In case of substantial amendment to the clinical trial protocol, approval from the health authorities (competent regulatory authority) will be sought before implementation. 
In some instances, an amendment may require a change to the informed consent form. The 
Investigator must receive an IRB/IEC approval/fa vorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_56401]-collected if 
necessary.

1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATION ALE 
 
1.1 The Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Pathway  
 
Activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been implicated 
in the development of several malignancies.1,2 A member of the phosphatidylinositol 3 -
kinase (PI3K) -related family of kinases, mTOR is a 289 -kDa protein serine/threonine 
kinase that was first identified as the cellular target of rapamycin and is involved in 
checkpoint regulation of the cell cycle regu lation. Additionally, the mTOR pathway is 
responsible for upregulating downstream signaling of hypoxia inducible factor -1-α (HIF1 -
α) which promotes angiogenesis and cell proliferation.[ADDRESS_397053] multiprotein signaling complexes, the rapamycin 
sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), and rapamycin insensitive mTOR complex 2 
(mTORC2). mTORC [ADDRESS_397054] through AKT and the 
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2). Activated AKT phosphorylates TSC2, which 
leads to dissociation of TSC1/TSC2 complex, thus inhibiting the ability of TSC2 to act as 
a GTPase activating protein. This all ows Rheb, a small G -protein, to remain in a GTP 
bound state and to activate mTORC1. Another regulator of the mTOR pathway is NF1.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_397055] approved by [CONTACT_941] U .S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with advanced renal 
cell carcinoma (RCC) in 2009.  It recently received approval for use in patients with 
advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors  as well.  T he FDA approved dose of 
everolimus is [ADDRESS_397056] common adverse reactions being stomatitis, 
fatigue, nausea,  diarrhea. Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions (≥2%) include infections, stomatitis, 
fatigue and pneumonitis. The most common laboratory abnormalities are anemia, 
hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, lymphopenia and increased 
creatinine.8 
 
Somatic mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex 1 ( TSC1 ) and NF2 gene s were rec ently 
identified as potential markers of response to mTOR therapy .  In a phase II study 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) of patients with bladder cancer treated with everolimus, 13 patients had 
tumor tissue available for molecular analysis. Of these, 8 patients were wild typ e for TSC1 
and all had progressive disease. Five of those patients had TSC1 mutations: 1 had CR of 
greater than 2 years (also had NF2 inactivation), 2 had minor response (24% and 17%), 1 
had stable disease, and 1 had progressive disease. Since mTORC 1 is m ainly activated via 
Protocol Version:  02/15/[ADDRESS_397057] through AKT and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2), we 
hypothesis that in a similar manner TSC2 mutation would also predict for response to 
everolimus.  Inactivating somatic mutations of STK11 (LKB1) reported in 34% of lung 
adenocarcinomas and 19% of squamous cell carcinomas could potentially identify patients 
likely to respond to temsirolimus given the sensitivity of a cell line with loss of STK11 to 
rapamycin.10-12 
 
1.2.1 Overview of Everolimus  
 
Everolimus is a derivative of rapamycin which acts as a signal transduction 
inhibitor ( Table 1 -1, Figure 1 -1). Everolimus selectively inhibits mTOR 
(mammalian target of rapamycin), specifically targeting the mTOR -raptor signal 
transduction complex. mTOR is a key serine -threonine kinase in the PI3K/AKT 
signaling cascade, which is known to be dysregulate d in a wide spectrum of human 
cancers (Boulay and Lane 2007).  
 
Everolimus is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act  
 directly on the tumor cells by [CONTACT_069];  
 indirectly by [CONTACT_129552] 
(via potent inhibition of tumor cell VEGF (vascular endothelial growth 
factor) production and VEGF -induced proliferation of endothelial cells).

Protocol Version:  02/15/[ADDRESS_397058] and Cancer  
 
At the cellular and molecular level, everolimus acts as a signal transduction 
inhibitor. It selectively inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a key 
protein kinase which regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. The mTOR 
kinase is mainly activated via the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI3 -Kinase) 
pathway through AKT/PKB and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/2). 
Mutations in these components or in PTEN, a negative regula tor of PI3 -kinase, may 
result in their dysregulation. Abnormal functioning of various components of the 
signaling pathways contributes to the pathophysiology of numerous human cancers. 
Various preclinical models have confirmed the role of this pathway in t umor 
development ( Cohen et al 2005 ). 
 
The main known functions of mTOR include the following ( Bjornsti and Houghton 
2004 ): 
 mTOR functions as a senso r of mitogens, growth factors and energy and 
nutrient levels;  
 Facilitating cell -cycle progression from G1 -S phase in appropriate growth 
conditions;  
 The PI3K/mTOR pathway itself is frequently dysregulated in many human 
cancers, and oncogenic transformation may sensitize tumor cells to mTOR 
inhibitors;  
 PI3-kinase mutations have been reported in the primary tumor in 10 -20% 
of human colorectal cancers ( Frattini 2005 , Velho 2005 ); 
 The loss of PTEN protein, either through gene deletion or functional 
silencing (promoter hypermethylation), is reported in approximately 60% 
of primary human colorectal cancers ( Goel et al 2004 ); 
 The mTOR pathway is involved in the production of pro -angiogenic factors 
(i.e., VEGF) and inhibition of endothelial cell growth and proliferation;  
 Through inactivating eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteins and 
activating the 40S ribosomal S6 kinases (i.e., p70S6K1), mTOR regulates 
protein translation, including the HIF -[ADDRESS_397059], prostate, colon, melanoma and 
glioblastoma. IC50s range from sub/low nM to µM. Everolimus also inhibits the 
proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECS) in vitro , with 
particular potency against VEGF -induced proliferation suggesting that everolimus 
may also act as an anti -angiogenic agent. The anti -angiogenic activity of 
everolimus was confirmed in vivo . Ever olimus selectively inhibited VEGF -
dependent angiogenic response at well tolerated doses. Mice with primary and 
Protocol Version:  02/15/17  Page 12 of 53 metastatic tumors treated with everolimus showed a significant reduction in blood 
vessel density when compared to controls.  
 
The potential of everolimus as an anti -cancer agent was shown in rodent models. 
Everolimus is orally bioavailable, residing longer in tumor tissue than in plasma in 
a subcutaneous mouse xenograft model, and demonstrating high tumor penetration 
in a rat pancreatic tumor model.  The pharmacokinetic profile of everolimus 
indicates sufficient tumor penetration, above that needed to inhibit the proliferation 
of endothelial cells and tumor cell lines deemed sensitive to everolimus in vitro . 
 
Everolimus administered orally daily was a  potent inhibitor of tumor growth, at 
well tolerated doses, in 11 different mouse xenograft models (including pancreatic, 
colon, epi[INVESTIGATOR_015], lung and melanoma) and two syngeneic models (rat pancreatic, 
mouse orthotopic melanoma). These models included tumo r lines considered 
sensitive and “relatively resistant” in vitro . In general, everolimus was better 
tolerated in mouse xenograft models than standard cytotoxic agents (i.e., 
doxorubicin and 5 -fluorouracil), while possessing similar anti -tumor activity. 
Additionally, activity in a VEGF -impregnated subcutaneous implant model of 
angiogenesis and reduced vascularity (vessel density) of everolimus -treated tumors 
(murine melanoma) provided evidence of in vivo  effects of angiogenesis.  
 
It is not clear which molecu lar determinants predict responsiveness of tumor cells 
to everolimus. Molecular analysis has revealed that relative sensitivity to 
everolimus in vitro  correlates with the degree of phosphorylation (activation) of the 
AKT/PKB protein kinase and the S6 ribos omal protein; in some cases (i.e., 
glioblastoma) there is also a correlation with PTEN status.  
 
In vivo  studies investigating the anti -tumor activity of everolimus in experimental 
animal tumor models showed that everolimus monotherapy typi[INVESTIGATOR_321773]. These effects occurred 
within the dose range of 2.5 mg to 10 mg/kg, orally once a day.  
 
In preclinical models, the administration of everolimus is associated with reduction 
of protein phosphorylation i n target proteins downstream of mTOR, notably 
phosphorylated S6 (p -S6) and p -4E-BP1, and occasionally with an increase in 
phosphorylated AKT, a protein upstream of mTOR signaling pathway.  
All significant adverse events observed in toxicology studies with everolimus in 
mice, rats, monkeys and mini -pi[INVESTIGATOR_321774] -proliferative and immunosuppressant and at least 
in part reversible after a [ADDRESS_397060] notably testes.  
 
In vitro genotoxicity studies covering relevant genotoxicity end -points showed no 
evidence of  clastogenic or mutagenic activity.  
 
In male fertility studies in rats, testicular morphology was affected at 0.5 mg/kg and 
Protocol Version:  02/15/17  Page 13 of 53 above, and sperm motility, sperm head count and plasma testosterone levels were 
diminished at 5 mg/kg which corresponded to 0.7 times the estimated clinical 
exposure at 10 mg/day, and caused a decrease in male fertility. There was evidence 
of reversibility. Female fertility was not affected, but everolimus caused an increase 
of pre -implantation loss in female rats at doses > 0.1 mg/kg, suggesting it could 
also potentially  impact fertility in females.  Everolimus crossed the placenta and 
was toxic to the conceptus. In rats, everolimus caused embryo/fetotoxicity at 
systemic exposure below the planned therapeutic level comprising mortality and 
reduced fetal weight. The incide nce of skeletal variations and malformations at 0.3 
and 0.9 mg/kg (e.g. sternal cleft) was increased. In rabbits, embryo toxicity was 
evident by [CONTACT_321792]. Effects of everolimus on the pre - and 
postnatal development of rats were limit ed to slightly affected body weight and 
survival in the F1 -generation at ≥0.1 mg/kg, and did not indicate a specific toxic 
potential.  
 
The potential reproductive risk for humans is unknown. However, due to the 
observed malformations in rats, everolimus sh ould be considered potentially 
teratogenic. Everolimus should not be given to pregnant women unless the potential 
benefit outweighs the potential risk for the fetus. Women of childbearing potential 
should be advised to use highly effective contraception me thods while they are 
receiving everolimus and up to 8 weeks after treatment has been stopped. It is not 
known whether everolimus is excreted in human milk. In animal studies, 
everolimus and/or its metabolites were readily transferred into the milk of lacta ting 
rats. Therefore women who are taking everolimus should not breastfeed.

this study. Provided  they meet other eligibility criteria , they will be consented to participate 
in the study.   
 
Genes to be sequenced include TSC1 ,TSC2 , NF1, NF2 and STK11 . The technology 
employed will permit detection of single nucleotide variants, small insertions, deletio ns, 
and complex indels, as well as amplifications and large deletions across the coding regions 
of all sequenced genes. Tumor -derived DNA obtained from formalin fixed, paraffin 
embedded tissue will serve as the source of input material for the assay.  Sens itive and 
specific methods to call variants and other genomic alterations will be performed using a

1.4 Study Rationale  
 
Cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease comprised of complex genomic alterations 
in common and overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_321776].  Complicating the heterogeneous nature of cancer 
is the clonal evolution that occurs within a tumor 10.  The molecular landscape of the tumor 
at time of diagnosis may differ significantly from the molecular profile at the time of 
disease progression 11.  It is critical that tumor samples are obtained at the time of diagnosis 
and following disease progression.  Key alterations in the tumor biology can be identified 
efficiently through use of routine next generation seq uencing.  It is important to identify 
predictive biomarkers for response to molecularly targeted agents; however , it is also 
important to investigate biomarkers that confer resistance to specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  As an 
example, 10% of non small cell lung cancer s (NCSLC) carry activating mutations in the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13391] (EGFR TK).[ADDRESS_397062] demonstrated response rates of approximately 70 -90% 
13,14, drug  resistance eventually develops as a consequence of an emergence of a population 
of tumor cells harboring a new mutation in the EGFR TK domain or amplification in the 
MET oncogene 15.  As a result , clinical studies are underway targeting  EGFR mutations in 
combination with MET inhibitors to target the genomic alterations that are occurring at the 
time of progression on an EGFR inhibitor.  Using a similar model, mutations in the 
mTOR/PI3K pathway and potential mechanisms of resistance to ev erolimus can be 
identified using routine next generation sequencing at the time of diagnosis and at time of 
disease progression.

This is an open label, single -arm phase II trial focusing on the response rate of everolimus .  The 
study treatment plan is as follows:  
 
1. Everolimus [ADDRESS_397076] 1.1  criteria  
4. Follow up biopsy (of accessible lesions that clearly showed progression)  
 
5.[ADDRESS_397077] the vomited dose.  If a patient misses a dose, the patient should be instructed not to 
take or make up that dose and to resume dosing with the next scheduled dose.  Patients will 
be instructed to bring all unused tablets  and their medication diary  (see Appendi x B) to 
each study visit for assessment of compliance.   
Protocol Version:  02/15/17  Page 19 of 53  
5.2 Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Overall, safety data available from completed, controlled and uncontrolled studies indicate 
that everolimus is generally well tolerated at weekly or daily dose schedules.  The safety 
profile is characterized by [CONTACT_58858] (AEs). These AEs are generally 
reversible and non -cumulative.  
 
Adverse events most frequently observed with everolimus are stomatitis, rash, diarrhea, 
fatigue, infections, asthenia, nausea, peripheral edema, decreased appetite, headache,  
dysgeusia, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], mucosal inflammation, pneumonitis, weight decreased, vomiting,  
pruritus, cough, dyspnea, dry skin, nail disorder, and pyrexia.  Overall, the most frequently 
observed laboratory abnormalities include  decreased hematology parameters including 
hemoglobin, lymphocytes, platelets, and neutrophils (or collectively as pancytopenia).; 
increased clinical chemistry parameters including cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, 
aspartate transam inases,  creatinine, alanine transaminases, and bilirubin; and decreased 
clinical chemistry parameters including phosphate and potassium. The majority of these 
AEs have been of mild to moderate severity (NCI CTC grade 1 -2).  
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_397078] been 
severe (e.g. leading to sepsis, res pi[INVESTIGATOR_36886]) and occasionally have 
had a fatal outcome.  
 
Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with 
everolimus . Treat pre -existing infections prior to starting treatment with 
everolimus. While taking everolimus, be vigilant for symptoms and signs of 
infection; if a diagnosis of infection is made, institute appropriate treatment 
promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation of everolimus.  
 
If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is mad e, discontinue everolimus 
and treat with appropriate antifungal therapy.  
 
Cases of pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), some with a fatal outcome, have 
been reported in patients who received everolimus. PJP may be associated with 
concomitant use of cort icosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents.  
Prophylaxis for PJP should be considered when concomitant use of corticosteroids 
or other immunosuppressive agents are required.  
 
5.2.2 Management of skin toxicity  
Protocol Version:  02/15/[ADDRESS_397079] be reported as an AE. Patients with grade 2 or higher toxicity 
may be treated with the following suggested supportive measures at the discretion 
of the investigator: oral minocycline, topi[INVESTIGATOR_321779], topi[INVESTIGATOR_47288], 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_029], diphenhydramine, oral prednisolone (short course), 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], or pi[INVESTIGATOR_031].  
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_397080] pain or angioedema (e.g. swelling of the 
airways or tongue, with or without respi[INVESTIGATOR_88739]) have been observed 
with everolimus.  
 
5.2.4 Angioedema with concomitant use of angiotensin -converting enzym e 
(ACE) inhibitors  
 
Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk for 
angioedema (e.g. swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respi[INVESTIGATOR_36880]).  
 
5.2.5 Renal Failure Events  
 
Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with fatal outcome, 
occurred in patients treated with everolimus. Renal function of patients should be 
monitored particularly where patients have additional risk factors that may further 
impair renal function.  
 
Elevations of serum crea tinine, usually mild, and proteinuria have been reported in 
patients taking everolimus. Monitoring of renal function, including measurement 
of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary protein, or serum creatinine, is 
recommended prior to the start of everolimus therapy and periodically thereafter.

5.2.6 Management of stomatitis / oral mucositis / mouth ulcers  
 
Severity  Everolimus Dose Adjustment and Management Recommendations  
Grade 1 
(Minimal 
symtpoms, 
normal diet)  No dose adjustment required.  
Manage with non -alcoholic or salt water (0.9%) mouth wash several times a 
day. 
Grade 2 
(Symptomatic 
but can eat and 
swallow 
modified diet)  Temporary dose interruption until recovery to grade ≤1.  
Re-initiate everolimus  at the same dose.  
If stomatitis recurs at grade 2, interru pt dose until recovery to grade ≤1. Re -
initiate everolimus  at a lower dose.  
Manage with topi[INVESTIGATOR_321780] (e.g. benzocaine, butyl 
aminobenzoate, tetracaine hydrochloride, me nthol or phenol)with or without 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930] (i.e. triamcinolone oral paste) *. 
Grade 3 
(Symptomatic 
and unable to 
adequately eat 
or hydrate 
orally)  Temporary dose interruption until recovery to grade ≤1.  
Re-initiate everolimus  at lower dose.  
Manage with topi[INVESTIGATOR_321780] (i.e. benzocaine, butyl 
aminobenzoate, tetracaine hydrochloride, me nthol or phenol)  with or 
without topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930] (i.e. triamcinolone oral paste) * 
Grade 4 
(Symptoms 
associated with 
life-threatening 
consequences)  Discontinue everolimus  and treat with appropriate medical therapy.  
* using agents containing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives in management of 
stomatitis as they may worsen mouth ulcers . 
 
Patients with a clinical history of stomatitis/mucositis/mouth ulcers and those with 
gastrointestinal morbidity associated with mouth/dental infections, irritation of 
esophageal mucosa e.g. gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and pre -existing 
stomatitis/mucositis must be monitored even more closely. Patients should  be 
instructed to report the first onset of buccal mucosa irritation/reddening to their 
study physician immediately.  
 
Stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers due to everolimus should be treated using 
local supportive care. Please note that investigators in earlier trials have described 
the oral toxicities associated with everolimus as mouth ulcers, rather than mucositis 
or stomatitis. If your examination reveals mouth ulcers rather than a more general 
inflammation of the mouth, please classify the adverse ev ent as such. The suggested 
paradigm for treatment of stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers is as follows:  
 
1. For mild toxicity (grade 1), no dose adjustment required. Manage with non -
alcoholic mouth wash or salt water (0.9%) mouth wash several times a day 
until resolution.  
2. For more severe toxicity (grade [ADDRESS_397081] pain but are 
able to maintain adequate oral alimentation, or grade 3 in which case 
patients cannot maintain adequate oral alimentation), the suggested 
treatments are topi[INVESTIGATOR_321781] (i.e., local anesthetics 
such as, benzocaine, butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine hydrochloride, 
Protocol Version:  02/15/17  Page 22 of 53 menthol, or phenol) with or without topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], such as 
triamcinolone oral paste 0.1% (Kenalog in Orabase®). 
3. Agents containing  alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme 
derivatives may tend to worsen mouth ulcers.  These agents should be 
avoided.  
4. Antifungal agents should be avoided unless a fungal infection is diagnosed. 
In particular, systemic imidazole antifungal agents (ke toconazole, 
fluconazole, itraconazole, etc.) should be avoided in all patients due to their 
strong inhibition of everolimus metabolism, therefore leading to higher 
everolimus exposures. Therefore, topi[INVESTIGATOR_321782].  
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_397082] onset (for example 
4 mg orally followed by 2 mg orally every 2 hours u ntil resolution of diarrhea).  
 
5.2.8 Management of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_321783] 1  No dose adjustment required.  
Initiate appropriate medical therapy and monitor.  
Grade 2  No dose adjustment required.  
Manage with appropriate medical therapy and monitor.  
Grade 3  Temporary dose interruption.  
Re-initiate everolimus  at lower dose.  
Manage with appropriate medical therapy and monitor.  
Grade 4  Discontinue everolimus  and treat with appropriate medical therapy.  
 
Treatment of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_89383] -treatment status and 
dietary habits of the patient. Grade 2 or higher hypercholesterolemia (>300 mg/dL 
or 7.75 mmol/L) or grade 2 hypertriglyceridemia or higher (>2 .5x upper normal 
limit) should be treated with a 3 -hydroxy -3-methyl -glutaryl (HMG) -CoA reductase 
inhibitor (e.g. atorvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin) or appropriate triglyceride -
lowering medication, in addition to diet.  
 
Note: Concomitant therapy with fibrates and an HMG -CoA reductase inhibitor is 
associated with an increased risk of a rare but serious skeletal muscle toxicity 
manifested by [CONTACT_090], markedly elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 
levels and myoglobinuria, acute renal failure and s ometimes death. The risk versus 
benefit of using this therapy should be determined for individual patients based on 
their risk of cardiovascular complications of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].  
 
Dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (including hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia) has be en 
reported in patients taking everolimus.  Monitoring of blood cholesterol and 
triglycerides prior to the start of everolimus therapy and periodically thereafter as 
well as management with appropriate medical therapy is recommended.  
Protocol Version:  02/15/[ADDRESS_397083] of rapamycin derivatives. Cases of 
non-infectious pneumonitis  (including interstitial lung disease) have also been 
described in patients taking everolimus. Some of these have been severe and on 
rare occasions, a fatal outcome was observed . 
 
 A diagnosis of non -infectious pneumonitis should be considered in patients 
presenting with non -specific respi[INVESTIGATOR_321784], pleural effusion, cough or dyspnea, and in whom infectious, 
neoplastic and other non -medicinal causes have been excluded by [CONTACT_3568]. Opportunistic infe ctions such as PJP should be 
ruled out in the differential diagnosis of non -infectious pneumonitis.  
Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856].  
 
Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non -infect ious 
pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms may continue everolimus therapy 
without dose alteration.  
 
If symptoms are moderate (grade 2), consideration should be given to interruption 
of therapy until symptoms improve.  The use of corticosteroids may be i ndicated.  
Everolimus  may be reintroduced at a daily dose approximately 50% lower than the 
dose previously administered.  
 
For cases of grade 3 non -infectious pneumonitis, interrupt everolimus  until 
resolution to less than or equal to grade 1.  Everolimus  may be re -initiated at a daily 
dose approximately 50% lower than the dose previously administered depending 
on the individual clinical circumstances.  If toxicity recurs at grade 3, consider 
discontinuation of everolimus .  For cases of grade 4 non -infectiou s pneumonitis, 
everolimus  therapy should be discontinued.  Corticosteroids may be indicated until 
clinical symptoms resolve.  
 
For patients who require use of corticosteroids for treatment of non -infectious 
pneumonitis, prophylaxis for pneumocystis jiroveci i pneumonia (PJP) may be 
considered. The two compounds studied most extensively for prophylaxis against 
PJP have been trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole, given orally, and pentamidine, 
given as an aerosol.

5.2.10  Management of hepatitis reactivation / flare  
 
Reactivation  of Hepatitis B (HBV) has been observed in patients with cancer 
receiving chemotherapy ( Yeo 2004 ). Sporadic cases of Hepatitis B reactivation 
have also been seen in this setting with everolimus. Use of antivirals during anti -
cancer therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of Hepatitis B virus reactivation 
and associated morbidity and mortality ( Loomba 2008 ). A detailed assessment of 
Hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors must be done for all patients at 
screening, with testing performed  prior to the first dose of everolimus.

5.[ADDRESS_397095] be instructed not to take any medications (over -the-counter or other products) 
during the protocol treatment period without prior consultation with the investigator. The 
investigator should instruct the patient to notify the study site about any new medications 
he/she takes after the start of study drug. All medications (other than study drug) and 
significant non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including physical therapy and blood tra nsfusions) taken 
within 28 days of starting study treatment through the 30 -day safety follow up visit should 
be reported on the CRF.  
 
5.3.1 Cytochrome P450 and P -glycoprotein inhibitors/inducers/substrates  
 
Co-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or P gP should be avoided; and 
may cause increased everolimus concentrations. For a current table of Substrates, 
Inhibitors and Inducers please access the following website:  
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources
/DrugInteractio nsLabeling/ucm093664.htm  
 
Protocol Version:  02/15/17  Page 27 of 53 Everolimus is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 in the liver and to some extent in the 
intestinal wall.  
 
Therefore, the following are recommended:  
 Co-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, ritonavi r) or P -glycoprotein (PgP) inhibitor should be avoided.  
 Co-administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, 
fluconazole) or PgP inhibitors should be used with caution. If a patient 
requires co -administration of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors  or PgP 
inhibitors, reduce the dose of everolimus by [CONTACT_3450] 50%. Additional 
dose reductions to every other day may be required to manage toxicities. If 
the inhibitor is discontinued, the everolimus dose should be returned to the 
dose used prior to i nitiation of the moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor after a 
washout period of 2 to 3 days.  
 TSC with SEGA:  Everolimus trough concentrations should be assessed 
approximately 2 weeks after the addition of a moderate CYP3A4/PgP 
inhibitor. If the inhibitor is discon tinued the everolimus  dose should be 
returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the inhibitor and the 
everolimus trough concentration should be re -assessed approximately 2 
weeks later.  
 Grapefruit, Seville oranges, and starfruit affect P450 and PgP ac tivity. 
Concomitant use should be avoided.  
 If patients require co -administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer, consider 
doubling the daily dose of everolimus  (based on pharmacokinetic data), 
using increments of [ADDRESS_397096] 3 to 5 da ys (reasonable time for significant enzyme de -
induction), before the everolimus  dose is returned to the dose used prior to 
initiation of the strong CYP3A4 inducer.  
 TSC with SEGA Patients receiving concomitant strong CYP3A4 
inducers (e.g., the enzyme inducing antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_321785], 
phenobarbital, and phenytoin) may require an increased everolimus  
dose to attain trough concentrations of 3 to 15 ng/mL. Double the daily 
dose of everolimus  and assess tolerability. Assess the everolimus trough 
level two weeks after doubling the dose. Further adjust the dose if 
necessary to maintain the trough within the 3 to 15 ng/mL range. If the 
strong inducer is discontinued, the everolimu s dose should be returned 
to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4 inducer and 
the everolimus trough concentrations should be assessed approximately 
2 weeks later.  
 This dose adjustment of everolimus is intended to achieve similar AUC to 
the range observed without inducers. However, there are no clinical data 
with this dose adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inducers. If 
Protocol Version:  02/15/17  Page 28 of 53 the strong inducer is discontinued the everolimus dose should be returned 
to the dose used prior to initiation  of the strong CYP3A4/PgP inducer.  
 
Please refer to  the tables below  listing relevant inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A 
and relevant substrates, inducers, and inhibitors of PgP.  
 
5.3.2 Everolimus and drugs influencing CYP3A4 enzyme  
 
Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4, and a substrate and moderate inhibitor of the 
multidrug efflux pump, PgP (PgP, MDR1, and ABCB1). Therefore, extent of 
absorption and subsequent elimination of systemically absorbed everolimus may 
be influenced by [CONTACT_321793], inhibitors, or inducers of CYP3A4 
and/or PgP. Concurrent treatment with strong CYP3A4 -inhibitors should be 
avoided. Refer to Table [ADDRESS_397097] of inducers and 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 and Table 6 -3 ]for a l ist of relevant substrates, inducers and 
inhibitors of PgP. Inhibitors of PgP may decrease the efflux of everolimus from 
brain or tumor and therefore increase everolimus concentrations in these tissues. In 
vitro studies showed that everolimus is a competit ive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of 
CYP2D6, potentially increasing the concentrations of products eliminated by [CONTACT_10835]. Thus, caution should be exercised when co -administering everolimus 
with CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index. Clinical 
studies have been conducted in healthy subjects to assess pharmacokinetic drug 
interactions between everolimus and potential CYP3A modifiers (ketoconazole, 
verapamil, erythromycin, rifampin, midazolam, and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors 
(statins). Please refer to http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main -table/  and

8.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
8.1 Everolimus  
 
8.1.1 Everolimus  Description  
 
Everolimus is an  inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and an 
antineoplastic agent.  
 
Chemical name:

tricyclo[[IP_ADDRESS],9]hexatriaconta -16,24,26, 28-tetraene -2,3,10,14,20 -pentaone.  
 
Molecular formula:  C53H83NO 14 
 
Molecular weight:  958.2  
 
8.1.2 Clinical Pharmacology  
Protocol Version:  02/15/17  Page 38 of 53  
Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine -
threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR p athway is 
dysregulated in several human cancers. Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, 
FKBP -12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 
(mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the 
activity o f S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic elongation factor 
4E-binding protein (4E -BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein 
synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation 
domain 1 of the estrogen recepto r which results in ligand -independent activation of 
the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia -inducible 
factor (e.g., HIF -1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by [CONTACT_321795], angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies.  
 
Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to 
endocrine resistance in breast cancer. In vitro studies show th at estrogen -dependent 
and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus, 
and that combination treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase 
inhibitors enhances the anti -tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic  manner.  
 
Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin -
sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 ( TSC1 , TSC2 ). Loss or inactivation of either TSC1 or 
TSC2 leads to activation of downstream signaling. In TSC, a genetic disorder, 
inactivating mu tations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma 
formation throughout the body.   
 
8.1.3 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
 
After administration of everolimus tablets in patients with advanced solid tumors, 
peak everolimus concentrations are reach ed 1 to 2 hours after administration of oral 
doses ranging from 5 mg to 70 mg. Following single doses, Cmax is dose -
proportional with daily dosing between 5 mg and 10 mg. With single doses of 20 
mg and higher, the increase in Cmax is less than dose -proport ional, however AUC 
shows dose -proportionality over the 5 mg to 70 mg dose range. Steady -state was 
achieved within 2 weeks following once -daily dosing.  
 
Dose Proportionality in Patients with SEGA and TSC: In patients with SEGA and 
TSC, everolimus Cmin was a pproximately dose -proportional within the dose range 
from 1.35 mg/m2 to 14.4 mg/m2.  
 
Food effect: In healthy subjects, high -fat meals reduced systemic exposure to 
everolimus 10 mg tablet (as measured by [CONTACT_12265]) by 22% and the peak blood 
concentration Cmax by 54%. Light -fat meals reduced AUC by 32% and Cmax by 
42%. Food, however, had no apparent effect on the post absorption phase 
concentration -time profile.   
Protocol Version:  02/15/17  Page 39 of 53  
The blood -to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration -dependent over 
the range of 5 to 5000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined 
to the plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer 
patients given everolimus 10 mg/day. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% 
both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.   
 
Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and PgP. Following oral administration, 
everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main 
metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including thr ee 
monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring -opened products, and a 
phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also 
identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 
100-times less activity tha n everolimus itself.  
 
In vitro , everolimus competitively inhibited the metabolism of CYP3A4 and was a 
mixed inhibitor of the CYP2D6 substrate dextromethorphan.   
 
No specific elimination studies have been undertaken in cancer patients. Following 
the administration of a 3 mg single dose of radiolabeled everolimus in patients who 
were receiving cyclosporine, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces, 
while 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine 
or feces.  The mean elimination half -life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours.   
 
8.1.4 Supplier(s)  
 
Everolimus will be provided by [CONTACT_192651].  
 
8.1.5 Dosage Form and Preparation  
 
Everolimus is formulated as tablets for oral administration of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 
mg strength.  Tablets are blister -packed under aluminum foil, which should be 
opened only at the time of administration as the drug is both hygroscopic and light -
sensitive.  
 
8.1.6 Storage  and Stability  
 
Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted between 15°C -30°C (59° -85°F).  Store 
in the original container.  Protect from light and moisture.  
 
8.1.7 Administration  
 
Everolimus is an oral drug which will be administered on an outpatient basis at a 
dose of 10 mg daily.   
 
8.1.8 Special Handling Instructions  
Protocol Version:  02/15/[ADDRESS_397117] with suspensions of tablets.  
Wash hands thoroughly before and after preparation of either suspension.  
 
 
9.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
9.1 Archived Tumor Ti ssue 
 
If mutational testing has not already been performed, n ext generation sequencing and 
screening for mutations in TSC1,  TSC2, NF1, NF2 and STK11  will be performed on 
archived formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue  as part of the patient’s 
routine care at any qualifying CLIA -certified laboratory that reports clinical next -
generation sequencing of these genes .  If the archival tissue does not have adequate viable 
cells for next generation sequencing to be performed, a fresh biopsy may be done prior to 
initiation of treatment.   This is being done as part of routine care, and only patients who 
show a mutation in TSC1,  TSC2, NF1, NF2 and STK11  may enroll to the study.

Protocol Version:  02/15/[ADDRESS_397120] – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 8 weeks.  
In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 8 weeks  (not less 
than 4) weeks following initial documentation of objective response.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) 
guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228 -247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diamete r 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case 
of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
12.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease :  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_397121] 
x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_397122] scan, or >[ADDRESS_397123] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Malignant lymph nodes :  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_397124] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the shor t axis will be measured and followed.  
Protocol Version:  02/15/17  Page 43 of 53  
Non-measurable disease:   All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non -measurable disease.  Bo ne lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the  criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should 
not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since 
they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considere d as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
 
Target lesions :  All measurable lesions up to a max imum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions 
and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of 
their size (lesions with the longest  diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but 
in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline s um diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short 
axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the dis ease.  
 
Non-target lesions :  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the 
presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
 
12.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to chara cterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Protocol Version:  02/15/17  Page 44 of 53 Clinical le sions:   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Convent ional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_397125] 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be 
twice the slice thicknes s.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly  impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical 
specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the 
type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should 
be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the 
same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to  prescribe specific 
MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the 
same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed 
as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath -hold 
scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
PET -CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the s ite can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -
CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then 
the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with convent ional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  
Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias 
an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
Ultrasound:   Ultrasound is not useful in as sessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it 
cannot be guaranteed that the sam e technique and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_13192], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation exposure 
at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained o r to determine relapse in trials where 
Protocol Version:  02/15/17  Page 45 of 53 recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Tumor markers:   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they mu st normalize for a patient to be considered 
in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [JNCI 
96:487 -488, 2004; J Clin Oncol 17, 3461 -3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol 26:1148 -1159, 2008].  
In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_397126] -line trials in 
ovarian cancer [JNCI  92:1534 -1535, 2000].  
 
Cytology, Histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benig n tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable 
disease is mandatory to differentiate between response o r stable disease (an effusion may 
be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET:   While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis 
of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
 Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
 No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this 
is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT, additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is 
truly progression o ccurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the 
initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this  is not PD.  
 FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both 
approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and 
biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
  
Note:   A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
Protocol Version:  02/15/17  Page 46 of 53 12.4 Response Criteria  
 
12.4.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline s um diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative i ncrease of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 
12.4.2  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be  non-pathological 
in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target les ion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):   Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump tar get lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_205948], and the 
progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or 
Principal Investigator).  
 
12.4.[ADDRESS_397127] Overall Response  
 
Protocol Version:  02/15/[ADDRESS_397128] response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until dis ease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic 
deterioration.”  Every effort should be mad e to document the objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.

12.4.4  Duration of Response  
 
Protocol Version:  02/15/17  Page 48 of 53 Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive d isease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first 
met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of s table disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline 
measurements.

Protocol Version:  02/15/[ADDRESS_397129] size is expected. Based on historical data, we assume a null 
hypothesis of an overall response rate of <1% in this setting.9 We hypothesize that an 
overall response rate of 30% or higher w arrants further investigation.    A total of N=[ADDRESS_397130] single -stage design with 85% 
power at a 1 -sided 0.05 significance level (using ph2single  function from library clinfun  in 
the R package). If [ADDRESS_397131] 1.1. Response 
rate will be defined as complete response (disappearance of all target lesion) plus partial 
response (a least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). Secondary 
endpoint will be to fu rther evaluate molecular markers of response or resistance using 
exome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing when feasible.  
 
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample, as well as response, and toxicity 
by [CONTACT_321796]. The overall response rate and its 
90% confidence interval will be estimated.  If possible, permutation tests will also be 
performed to compare the differences of secondary endpoints between responders and non -
responders. The distrib ution associated with no difference (the null distribution) can be 
identified using the data in hand. If there is no difference between the values seen in 
responders and those in non -responders, then, for this purpose, it does not matter whether 
a given pa tient is labeled as a responder or a nonresponder. So we can randomly shuffle 
the response labels and calculate the test statistic from the shuffled data. If this procedure 
is repeated 10,[ADDRESS_397132] the null hypothesis of no differenc e and conclude that 
there is a true difference between responders and non -responders. Then the null distribution 
Protocol Version:  02/15/[ADDRESS_397133] 
statistic is “unusual,”  a permutation test generates a p -value, which is equal to the 
proportion of test statistics from the label -shuffled samples that exceed the observed test 
statistics.

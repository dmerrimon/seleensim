Design : Volunteers will be [ADDRESS_581166], a fourth group of 5 previously vaccinated volunteers  may be recruited.  If an 
inadequate number of volunteers vaccinated on these schedules are available volunteers  vaccinated with PIV 
followed by [CONTACT_454660] 28 days  later may also be included.  
Both vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers  will be challenged with the DHIM -1 challenge strain at University 
of Maryland ’s CVD  in at least two separate challenge events .  Volunteers  who meet the criteria  for inpatient 
analysis  (i.e.,  develop fever, detectable  viremia , and/or symptoms , signs or laboratory criteria  concerning for 
development of severe dengue ) will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39869] a designated inpatient unit . 
After inoculation, volunteers  will be seen and evaluated (including blood draw) closely (qd or qod per study 
schedule) until Day [ADDRESS_581167] inoculation.  If a volunteer  develops viremia, symptoms or laboratory findings  that 
meet sequestration (viremia) or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_454602]  (vire mia plus symptoms and/or laboratory findings) he  
or she will be admitted. During hospi[INVESTIGATOR_454603]. Volunteers  will be eligible for discharge when they have fever 
resolution, improvement in symptoms and absence of virus detection by [CONTACT_940] (PCR).  
Note:  Due to the C OVID -[ADDRESS_581168] been added to the protocol in the event that local 
transmission of the SARS -CoV-2 virus continue s concomitant to study operations.

Endpoint Analysis : 
Primary:  
The primary endpoints align with the safety and clinical objectives. The nature, frequency and severity of adverse 
events (AEs) associated with the attenuated DHIM -1 will be evaluated in  the vaccinated ADVP004 volunteers 
and unvaccinated dengue -naïve contr ol volunteers with statistical comparisons both within  and between groups.  
• Occurrence, grade , and duration of solicited injection site symptoms until [ADDRESS_581175] virus inoculation  
• Occurrence, intensity, and duration of unsolicited injection site symptoms until [ADDRESS_581176] inpatient , whichever is later  
• Occurrence, intensity, and duration of solicited systemic symptoms until [ADDRESS_581177] inpatient , whichever is later  
• Number, intensity, and duration of abnormal laboratory measurements until [ADDRESS_581178] inpatient , whichever is later  
• Occurrence, intensity and duration of dengue like symptoms/adverse events until [ADDRESS_581179] inpatient  whichever is later  (See defined Dengue  Illness Index ) 
• Occurrence, intensity, and duration of unsolicited systemic symptoms until [ADDRESS_581180] inpatient , whichever is later  
• Number of SAEs until [ADDRESS_581181] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], whichever is later  
• Number of SAEs until [ADDRESS_581182] virus inoculation  
• The occurrence of fever defined as greater than or equal to 38°C (100.4° F) measured at least [ADDRESS_581183] 4 hours apart

IND 016332 ; CVD Dengue [ZIP_CODE]  Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health  
V4.0, 04 Jan 2021  10  The secondary endpoints align with the viremia  and immunogenicity objectives.  Dengue viremia will be 
examined both as a binary endpoint (present or not present) , peak,  and as a function of area under the curve 
(AUC)  
• Viremia by [CONTACT_454663] -polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) up to [ADDRESS_581184] 
virus inoculation  
• MN50 antibody GMT  titers at 28 days following inoculation in vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers  
 
Statistical Methods of Dengue Illness Index  (DII) of DHIM -1: 
The impact  of the challenge virus up to 28 days after virus inoculation will be assessed descriptively using the 
following disease severity index (DSI) parameters  and assessing differences between vaccinated and 
unvaccinated study volunteers : 
• Number and percentage of volunteers  in each group (vaccinated vs. control) who develop signs and 
symptoms of dengue fever as described below  
• Time to onset of clinical signs an d symptoms of dengue fever as described below  
• Magnitude of viremia, time to onset of viremia, duration of viremia, number and percentage of volunteers  
with measurable and sustainable viremia and area under the curve viremia analysis   
• Number and percentage of volunteers  in each group with fever greater than or equal to 38°C (100.4°F) 
measured at least [ADDRESS_581185] four hours apart in 24 ho urs  
• Number, percentage and severity  score  of volunteers  in each group  with each of the following clinical or 
laborat ory symptoms  as measured by [CONTACT_454664] : 
- Fever  greater than or equal to 38°C (100.4°F)  
-  Headache /retro -orbital pain   
- Rash   
-  Fatigue and/or  malaise  
-  Myalgia  
-  Arthralgia and/or bone pain   
- GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain)  
- Liver function tests (ALT, AST)  
- Leukopenia  
- Thrombocytopenia  
*Note:  Post -hoc analysis can recategorize disease severity based upon WHO parameters  
Analysis of the secondary endpoints will be applied on per protocol population. Only those volunteers  who 
receive inoculations will be included in the analysis.   Descriptive analysis will compare measurements from 
vaccinated and unvaccinated study voluntee rs.  
Statistical Methods for Exploratory Endpoints:  
Exploratory endpoints will be analyzed using the population of volunteers  enrolled in the trial who receive 
dengue virus  inoculation. Analysis will be done using the previously mentioned assays and appro priate statistical 
tests will be performed.  The immune response to the challenge virus at each dose will be characterized 
descriptively by:  
• Geometric mean titer (GMT) and geometric mean titer rates (GMTRs) of neutralizing antibodies 
(measured by [CONTACT_454665] (NT) at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months after virus inoculation  (> 10  defined 
as response)  
• Cell mediated immunity (CMI)  
• Proteomics - microarray  
• Transcriptomics  (to include single -cell analyses)  
• Evolutionary analysis of DHIM -1 strain whole genome sequence (consensus and quasi -species )

grouped into 4 types (DENV -1 to DENV -4), occurs in more than [ADDRESS_581197], and Africa (estim ated 2.5 
billion people at -risk). Dengue is the most common arboviral (mosquito -borne) infection of 
humans and a major cause of acute febrile illness affecting an estimated 100 million people 
worldwide annually , with 500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fev er (DHF) and 22,000 deaths 
annually  (WHO -2009).[ADDRESS_581198] Asia.2 A recent GeoSentinel analysis of 82,825 ill Western travelers identified 1,910 
with acute dengue infection of which 0.9% developed hemorrhagic fever, resulting in one death .[ADDRESS_581199] experienced numerous disruptions due 
to dengue . It has particularly affected US troops  in the Pacific Theater , with over 91,000  cases 
observed in WWII. Dengue infection  accounted for approxi mately 30% of febrile viral illnesses 
in Vietnam, affecting 40/1000 troops . More recently it was the cause of 289  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_454609] 406 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] s among US troops in Haiti.  Soldiers who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_454610] 14 -21 days to recover to the point where they are fully mission capable. As the 
[LOCATION_002] shifts its foreign policy and military focus to the Pacific region, the number of 
military and civilian personnel traveling to dengue endemic regions is also expected to ris e 
significantly .5 Once infected with dengue virus  (DENV) , the incubation period typi[INVESTIGATOR_34607] 4 to 
7 days, ranging from 3 to 14 days .6 Infection with dengue virus may cause an undifferentiated 
febrile illness with a maculopapular rash. The majority of infections, especially in children under  
age 15, are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic.7 Older children and adults sustain either a 
mild febrile syndrome or the classical, self-limited , but incapacitating illness dengue feve r 
consisting of fever (often 102°F -105°F), myalgias, rash,  frontal headache, retro -orbital pain, 
nausea, vomiting, anorexia, altered taste and olfactory perception, and malaise. The fever typi[INVESTIGATOR_454611] 2 -7 days and viremia lasts an average of 5 days.8 Following the painful “breakbone ” and 
febrile phase most  patients slowly improve. Dengue virus dis appears from the bloodstream at 
approximately the same time that the fever dissipates. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are 
common findings in mild dengue  infection .  
A small proportion of individuals  will progress to a more severe form of dengue infection. 
Manifestations of severe dengue (DHF or dengue shock syndrome [DSS]) include severe 
hemorrhage leading to shock through blood loss, sudden increased vascular  permeability leading 
to shock with or wit hout hemorrhage, and severe encephalopathy with  hepatitis. There is no 
pathognomonic sign or symptom for DHF during the acute stage, but as  fever remits, characteristic 
manifestations of plasma leakage appear, making accurate clinical  diagnosis possible in  many 
cases.  An individual who has been infected with a specific DENV serotype, develops serotype 
specific antibodies and is generally considered to be protected from future infection from the same 
serotype. However, they are not protected against infectio n from a heterologous serotype, and 
approximately 10% are at increased risk for progressing to DHF or DSS during the second

specific treatment is currently available but symptomatic and supportive measures (e.g. , 
intravenous  [IV] fluid management) significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality rates. Less 
well verified has been the impact of exposure to prior flavivirus infections.[ADDRESS_581200] 
characteristics such as pediatric obesity may play a role in disease severity.12 Currently, vector 
control is the only method with a demonstrated although limited efficacy , but it is c ostly. Mosquito 
control does not offer satisfactory control of dengue and additional prevention methods are 
required. There are no antivirals registered, but several candidates are under evaluation at 
preclinical stage s. Several vaccine candidates are at v arious stages of development.  There is one 
FDA licensed dengue vaccine but  is only indicated in pediatric populations with prior dengue 
exposure.13 This labeling is in part due to the concern of enhanced dengue disease in vaccine 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_454612].14  
5.1. Rational e for the Study Design  
To evaluate the effectiveness of candidate dengue vaccine formulations,  and to refine our 
understanding of correlates of dengue protection,  it is prudent to develop an appropriate challenge 
model. To this end, this study will examine the level of protection following Dengue 1  Live Virus 
Human Challenge (DENV -1-LVHC) product in volunteers  previousl y vaccinated with 
heterologous prime boost  utilizing Tetravalent Dengue Virus (TDEN) Purified Inactivated 
Vaccine (PIV) and Tetravalent Dengue Virus Live Attenuated Vaccine (LAV)  as compared to 
unvaccinated, healthy control volunteers . We will further examine the safety a nd effectiveness of 
the DENV -1-LVHC  and assess the ability of this virus strain to elicit an uncomplicated dengue -
like illness.  
5.2. Name [CONTACT_454729], the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) challenge 
lot 18 06, DENV -1-LVHC, is a lyophilized powder for  injection c onsisting of: DENV -1 strain 
45AZ5  virus, Eagle’s minimal essential medium (EMEM, modified) culture me dium, human 
plasma albumin -USP, L -glutamine, streptomycin, neomycin, and lactose. The freeze -dried 
DENV -1-LVHC is rehydrated with 0.7 mL of water for injection (WFI). The route of 
administration is subcutaneous (SC) injection for the proposed indication of  infection of volunteers  
to produce an uncomplicated dengue -like illness in order to support development of vaccines and 
drugs.  
5.3. Summary of Pre -clinical and Clinical Trials  
Pre-clinical Studies  
In 2013, the new DENV -1-LVHC was used in a non -Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) preclinical 
study entitled “Pre -clinical evaluation of dengue virus type 1 (DENV -1) pre - and post -transfection 
human challenge viruses in the rhesus macaque ( Macaca mulatta ) infection model.” The purpose 
of the study was to test the re -derived (post -transfection) DENV -1 challenge virus in rhesus 
macaques and compare it with its pre -transfection parent (Salk vaccine, lot 1 -82). The DENV -1 
challenge virus was administered SC (0.5 mL) at an infectivity titer of 105 plaque forming units 
(PFU)/mL  to 10 healthy adult rhesus macaques. Five of the animals were administered DENV -1 
45AZ5 (DENV -1-LVHC), Salk lot 1 -82, Run 2, pre -transfection seed; and 5 of the animals were

IND 016332 ; CVD Dengue [ADDRESS_581201] -transfection seed. Blood samples  collec ted daily for 
14 days and on Days 16, 18, and 21, were used to measure serum virus (viremia) by [CONTACT_454666] (qualitative viremia), 50% cell culture infective dose (CCID50) assay 
(quantitative viremia), and viral RNA (RNAemia) by [CONTACT_454667] r everse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. A blood sample collected [ADDRESS_581202] -transfection 
virus seeds in terms of their ability to induce viremia or RNAemia in rhesus macaques, nor were 
there significant differences in viremia ons et, duration, or mean virus titers between groups that 
received the different challenge viruses. Furthermore, both groups exhibited similar 
seroconversion rates and neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) approximately

phenotype in an accepted nonhuman primate model. Please refer to the Investigator’s brochure for 
additional information.

In 2001, study A -9211, “Clinical and Immunological Evaluations of Four Dengue Viruses as 
Challenge Strains in Immune and Susceptible Volunteers,” was completed  under BB -IND-8796. 
The clinical study report (CSR) was submitted on 14 June 2002; serial number (SN) 0018 and a 
second iteration (for site number 2) was submitted on 02 January 2003 (SN 0020). This was an 
exploratory study to evaluate possible dengue chal lenge viruses that will reproducibly cause 
uncomplicated dengue fever lasting 3 -7 days.  
Out of 15 volunteers  total; two volunteers  received DENV -1, three volunteers  received DENV -2, 
three volunteers  received DENV -3, four volunteers  received DENV -4, and th ree volunteers  
received placebo. DENV -1 45AZ5 was administered SC to two flavivirus (FV) naïve volunteers

Controls) information was included in Master File 8797. The final CSR was submitted to the US 
Food and Drug A dministration (FDA) on 04 March 2008 (IND 8796, SN0029). This clinical study 
was performed using both previously vaccinated and non -vaccinated (FV -naïve) volunteers . 
In regard to DENV -1, all 5 volunteers  previously vaccinated with tetravalent live -attenuat ed 
dengue vaccine ( volunteers  1, 4, 6, 7, and 12) were protected against DENV -[ADDRESS_581205] measurable  
neutralizing antibody at the time of challenge. DENV -1 in control volunteers  (volunteers  17 and 
18) caused febrile illness lasting 2 -6 days after incubation periods of 17 and 21 days, respectively.

virus from prior yellow fever virus vaccination but no pre -existing hemagglutination  inhibition 
(HI) or neutralizing antibody to any dengue serotype. (Additionally, one volunteer  had received 
an inactivated tick -borne encephalit is vaccine.) Neither volunteer  reported significant discomfort 
at the injection site, and no redness, swelling, or regional adenopathy were seen. After an 
incubation period of 8 -9 days, both volunteers  developed characteristic dengue fever; headache, 
myalg ia, fever (lasting for 3 and 5 days, respectively), rash, progressive leukopenia (reaching 
nadirs of 2,700/mm3 and 2,300/mm3, respectively) and mild platelet count depression (below 
200,000/mm3, the lower count of the two was 123,000/mm3). They experienced neither 
hemorrhage nor hypotension. Proteinuria and mild pyuria were noted incidentally in one volunteer . 
One volunteer  had resolution of his fever and symptoms by [CONTACT_941] 6th day of illness. The other 
volunteer  achieved resolution of fever  and overall symptomatic improvement by [CONTACT_454669]; however, he experienced malaise, easy fatigability, and a sense of depression until the 
eleventh day of illness.

Two dengue vaccine trials have been conducte d at WRAIR utilizing a heterologous prime boost strategy. 
The first study entitled, “A Phase 1, Randomized, Open -label, Single -center, Study of TDENV -PIV and 
LAV Dengue Vaccine Platforms as part of a Heterologous Prime -boost Strategy in Healthy Adults in a  
Nonendemic Region ” (ADVP003) involved [ADDRESS_581211] in immune response as measured by [CONTACT_454674]005  The University of Maryland, Baltimore   
IND 016332 ; CVD Dengue [ADDRESS_581212] in antibody production following receipt of PIV boosting. The overall antibody titers were 
noted  to be substantially higher in the PIV/LAV 0,180 group than the PIV/LAV 0,[ADDRESS_581213] final vaccination  and persistent tetravalent seroconversion status for all 
volunteers  in this group . (ASTMH Annual Meeting pr esentation Nov 2016).  
A second study of prime boost was subsequently initiated to further evaluate the optimal schedule for this 
vaccination regimen. The second study entitled, “A Phase 1, Randomized, Open -label, Single -center, 
Comparison of Heterologous P rime-Boost Vaccination Schedules of Tetravalent Dengue Virus Purified 
Inactivated Vaccine (PIV) and Tetravalent Dengue Virus Live Attenuated Vaccine (LAV) in Healthy 
Adults in a Nonendemic Region ”(ADVP004)  enrolled 40 volunteers  in two groups of 20 who re ceived 
either PIV/LAV 0,90 day or PIV/LAV 0,[ADDRESS_581214] in both the PIV/LAV 0,90 and PIV/LAV 0,180 groups along with 95% 
tetravalent seroconversion in the 0,90 -group compared to 100% in the 0,[ADDRESS_581215].   
5.4. Known and Po tential Risks and Benefits to Human Volunteers  
 
5.4.1.   Dengue Classification  
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, dengue severity is divided 
into the following: dengue with or without warning signs, and severe dengue 36 
Dengue  without warning signs is defined as fever and two (2) of the following:  
• Nausea  
• Rash  
• Aches and pains  
• Leukopenia  
• Positive tourniquet test  
Dengue with warning signs is dengue defined above with any of the following:  
• Abdominal pain or tenderness  
• Persistent vomiting  
• Clinical fluid accumulation (ascites, pleural effusion)  
• Mucosal bleeding  
• Lethargy, restlessness  
• Liver enlargement > 2 cm  
• Laboratory increase in HCT concurrent with rapid decrease i n platelet count  
Dengue with warning signs requires strict observation and medical intervention.  Severe dengue 
is defined by [CONTACT_454675], severe hemorrhage, and severe organ impairment. Severe 
dengue also requires strict observation and medical i ntervention.  We do not anticipate dengue 
with warning signs, based upon prior experience with this attenuated DHIM -[ADDRESS_581216] -hoc basis if symptoms 
dictate.

V4.0, 04 Jan 2021  25  5.4.2.  Risks/Discomfo rt to Volunteers  and Precautions to Minimize Risk  
Outlined below are anticipated and unexpected /unanticipated adverse reactions, and a brief 
description of procedures to ameliorate risks and symptoms. All known risks and precautions 
described here are explained in detail in the informed consent.  Of note, the challenge strain is an 
attenuated strain of dengue virus.  
[IP_ADDRESS].       Local Reactions  
Local reactions may include pain, redness , and swelling at the injection site.  
[IP_ADDRESS].       Systemic Reaction s 
The symptoms of classic dengue infection range from asymptomatic infection, to a mild febrile 
syndrome, or the classical, self -limited, but incapacitating illness dengue fever consisting of fever 
(often 102°F -105°F), joint pain, myalgias, frontal headach e, retro -orbital pain, nausea, vomiting, 
anorexia, rash, increase in liver enzymes, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mild bleeding 
manifestation (e.g., nose or gum bleed), petechiae, or easy bruising. Any or all of these clinical 
manifestations may occur.  While the incubation period for natural occurring dengue is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 7 
days (range 4 – 10 days) with manifestations of complicated dengue likely to appear by [CONTACT_2006] 10  
(range [ADDRESS_581217] symptom onset) , the incubation and signs of complicated dengue infec tion 
may be different for the attenuated study product.  A recent trial conducted at SUNY Upstate 
utilizing the DHIM -[ADDRESS_581218] demonstrated that 5 of 6 volunteers developed viremia 
between Days 4 -16 (range 9 -12 days) accompanied by [CONTACT_932] (5 of 5 volunt eers) between Days 6 -
24 (mean of 9 days), and fever (>100.4º F) in only on volunteer (Day 12). Other reported symptoms 
included headache, eye pain, weakness, bone, muscle, and/or joint pain, indicative of an 
uncomplicated dengue infection.  
In-patient  patients will receive symptomatic and supportive care as needed. Most will only require 
oral hydration and acetaminophen for fever and myalgias. Volunteers  with more severe symptoms 
may require IV fluid hydration. The risks for this are pain and bruising  at the IV site, 
thrombophlebitis, fluid extravasation, or volume overload .  Local infection or systemic infection 
(bacteremia) are extremely uncommon risks related to IV insertion.  
Severe dengue infection (DHF) with evidence of plasma leakage and hemorrhage is extremely rare 
in first time infections. Only previously vaccinated or dengue naïve volunteers  will be eligible to 
participate in this study. No volunt eers who have received live attenuated virus strains in prior 
vaccination  or challenge  studies  (including other DENV challenge studies of those who have 
received dengue vaccines)  have developed severe dengue symptoms.21  
[IP_ADDRESS].      Pregnancy  
Risks to unborn babies are not well characterized  at this time , with a recent meta -analysis 
indicating  a possible association with  dengue and  pre-term delivery and /or lower birthweight .37 
Pregnancy is an exclusion criterion for enrollme nt in this study and contraception should be used 
by [CONTACT_454676]. Female volunteers  who become 
pregnant following inoculation will not be discontinued from the trial and will be followed for 
safety assessment for the duration of the pregnancy. Female partners of male volunteers  who father 
a child during the study will be asked to be foll owed for the duration of the pregnancy.  
A sexually active man is defined as one whose partner is a woman of childbearing potential (see 
definition below) and has not had a vasectomy performed > 1 year prior to screening.  Dengue virus 
Clinical Protocol ADVP005  The University of Maryland, Baltimore   
IND 016332 ; CVD Dengue [ADDRESS_581219] agree to use 
a barrier method of birth control (e .g., either condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream or 
partner usage of occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] with spermicidal 
foam/gel/film/cream/suppository).  
Women of childbearing potential are defined as those who have not been sterilized via tubal 
ligation, bilateral ooph orectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], hysterectomy, or successful Essure® 
placement (permanent, non -surgical, non -hormonal sterilization) with history of documented 
radiological confirmation test at least 90 days after the procedure (or with use of another bi rth 
control method if history of confirmation test not confirmed), still menstruating or <  [ADDRESS_581220] menses if menopausal. For this study, an effective contraceptive method is defined as one that 
results in a failure rate of less than 1% per year when it is used consistently.  Adequate contraceptive 
precautions  include - intrauterine  contraceptive device, oral contraceptives, diaphragm, or condom 
in combination with contraceptive jelly, cream, or foam; Norplant® or Depo -Provera®, through 56 
days  after the  dengue challenge  injection to minimize any potential risk.  
[IP_ADDRESS].       Lactati on 
Risks to nursing infants are unknown at this time. Females who are breastfeeding a child will be 
excluded from enrollment into the study. Females will be instructed not to become pregnant for 
the duration of the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].       Venipuncture  
Blood sampling carries a minimal risk of minor discomfort and the possibility of minor bruising 
at the site of the needle puncture and, rarely, the possibility of infection at the needle puncture site 
and/or nerve damage. Occasionally, the act  of blood sampling or the injection of study product 
induces a vasovagal reaction.  Volunteers will be queried as to their propensity for this reaction 
and will be encouraged to remain lying down during procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS].        Allergic Reaction  
As with any investigational new drug (IND) product administration and no matter what precautions 
are taken, there is always the risk of a serious, or even life -threatening, allergic reaction. Medical 
emergency equipment is located  at the study site . This is availa ble to handle emergencies, such as 
anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm.  
[IP_ADDRESS].        Guill ain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)  or adverse reactions to vaccines  
A serious but rare, neurologic disorder called Guill ain-Barré syndrome can occur afte r certain 
infections, due to immune activation which damages the body’s peripheral nerves, resulting in 
muscle weakness and some degree of paralysis. GBS can last for weeks to months. There is no 
known causal  association of dengue and GBS. A pproximately 85% of people eventually recover 
completely or nearly completely, but some people have permanent nerve damage, and between 
3% and 4% of people who develop GBS die. To decrease this risk, individuals with a history of 
GBS or other significant r eaction to vaccines will be excluded from participating in the study.   
[IP_ADDRESS].        Observations from  Natural Dengue Infection  
Patients who have antibody from an earlier dengue virus infection and who are subsequently 
infected by a dengue virus strain of  another serotype, have been shown to be at higher risk for

IND 016332 ; CVD Dengue [ZIP_CODE]  Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health  
V4.0, 04 Jan 2021  27  DHF and/or dengue shock syndrome. The virus to be used in this stud y is designed to induce 
Dengue -1 virus sero -responsiveness. There is the possibility that a volunteer  exposed in the  future 
to se rotypes 2, 3, or 4 may develop a more severe case of dengue infection (i.e. , DHF /DSS ) than 
if they had been dengue naïve. To date, there is no evidence that attenuated dengue virus vaccines 
(monovalent and tetravalent) place adults at in creased risk for se vere dengue .39 However,  a 
chimeric dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia ®) produced by [CONTACT_13225], has demons trated a safety signal 
suggesting increased risk in seronegative pediatric patients  less than nine years of age .[ADDRESS_581221] received a tetravalent  
dengue  virus (TDEN) purified inactivated vaccine (PIV) followed by [CONTACT_454677] d virus 
(LAV) at [ADDRESS_581222] ion remains unknown but neutralizing  
antibody is believed to be important .41 The potential risk of enhanced dengue infection upon 
natural infection following vaccination and subsequent inoculation with this challenge strain is 
unknown . Tetravalent responders (defined as Day 28 titers following final vaccination) from the 
ADVP -[ADDRESS_581223] sustained 
tetravalent responses will be  preferentially asked to participate in order to mitigate risk.  
Theoretical Risks  
Theoret ical risks based on symptoms /outcomes typi[INVESTIGATOR_454615] -type dengue 
infection, but not seen in prior attenuated DHIM studies  may include:  
• Volunteer (s) may develop dengue fever with one or more of the following events  
− Hemorrhage  
− Evidence of end organ involvement defined by [CONTACT_454678] 2 severity  
− Intravenous (IV) fluid requirement for hemodynamic instability (not for comfort 
or the inability to take oral fluids)  
• Volunteer (s) may develop dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) with symptoms similar 
to dengue fever plus, any one of the following  
− Severe and continuous pain in abdomen  
− Ascites and or/pleural effusions  
− Bleeding from the nose, mouth and gums or skin bruising  
− Frequent vomiting with or without blood  
− Black stools, like coal tar  
− Excessive thirst (dry mouth)  
− Pale, cold  skin 
− Restlessness, or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]  
• Volunteer (s) may develop dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which can be defined as 
DHF plus the following symptoms

− Hypotension  
− Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]  
− Altered level of consciousness  
− Narrow pulse pressure (less tha n 20 mm Hg)  
− Cold, clammy skin  
− Restlessness  
• A volunteer  who receives this viral challenge could be primed for more severe 
disease, if exposed to another d engue virus following this study.   Post hoc analysis 
may re -categorize volunteers according to the WHO  grading system in the unlikely 
event that non-severe cases with warning signs or severe cases occur.[ADDRESS_581224], but closely related, serotypes of the virus that cause dengue 
(DEN V-1, DEN V-2, DEN V-3, and DEN V-4). Recovery from infection by [INVESTIGATOR_2394] e provides 
lifelong immunity against that particular serotype. However, cross -immunity to the other 
serotypes after recovery is only partial and temporary. Subsequent infections by [CONTACT_454679][INVESTIGATOR_454616]. In primary w ild type dengue 
infection, there is a less than 1% risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_454617]. With a secondary 
infection, this risk may increase to as high as  5-10%.9 
Globally, there are an estimated 50 to 100 million cases of dengue fever (DF)  and se veral 
hundred thousand cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) per year. There are 
approximately 30,000 deaths per year related to severe dengue. There is no specific 
treatment for dengue/ severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medi cal care 
lowers fatality rates below 1%.[ADDRESS_581225] underlying immune issues present.

in the community surrounding the clinical site.   DENV LVHC (rDEN2 30)  has been 
conducted within the greater Baltimore -Washington region.21  To mitigate the risk of 
challenge strain transmission, challenges will be conducted  in the autumnal/winter 
months  (November -March)  when mosquitoes cannot replicate /transmit  or volunteers 
will be sequestered during periods of viremia  (April – October) . 
• Female volunteers  with excessive menstrual bleeding and hypermenorrhea have bee n

is included in the sponsor’s information sheet.  
5.7. Study Population  
This study will enroll healthy male and non -pregnant, non -breastfeeding  female volunteers  
between the ages of 18 and 50 (inclusive)  for the  naïve volunteers  as well as volunteers  that were 
previous participants of a TDEN  vaccine study (ADVP -004) conducted at Clinical Trials Center, 
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (CTC, WRAIR). The study will include 5 unvaccinated 
dengue naïve volunteers  (recruited from the greater Baltimore -Washington area) , [ADDRESS_581232], a fourth group 
of 5 previously vaccinated volunteers  may be recruited.  If an inadequate number of volunteers 
vaccinated on these schedules are available volunteers  vaccinated with PIV followed by [CONTACT_454660] 28 
days later may also be included  (ADVP -003 trial participants) . WRAIR and WRAIR staff will not 
be directly involved in the clinical conduct of this study. Contact [CONTACT_454680],  and University of Maryland will perform 
recruitment and screening activities from this available list.  
5.8. Study Sites  
This study will be conducted at the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health (CVD) at 
the University of Maryland , Baltimore  (UMB) . The UMB CVD is a clinic -based  research center 
affiliated with the UMB  School  of Medicine (SOM)  and is located on the 3rd and 4th floors of the 
Health Sciences Facility  (HSF) Building. The outpatient phase will occur at the UMB CVD. A 
sequestration phase, precipi[INVESTIGATOR_454618], will occur at a

6. Trial Objectives  
6.1. Primary Objectives  
• To furthe r evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of the DHIM -1 human challenge model  
• To determine the level of protection to dengue serotype [ADDRESS_581233] utilizing TDEN PIV  and 
TDEN LAV . 
6.2. Secondary Objectives  
• To characterize the immunologic responses following dose exposure to the DENV -1-
LVHC viral strain as a DHIM in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated volunteers  
• To compare virologic responses following dose exposure to DHIM -1 in vaccinated 
compared to unvaccinated groups  
6.3. Exploratory Objectives  
• To explore the immune response and host -virus interactions following exposure to 
manuf actured, attenuated DENV -1-LVHC  
7. Trial Design  
7.1. Study Endpoints  
 
7.1.1.    Primary Endpoints  
The primary endpoints align with the safety and clinical objectives. The nature, frequency and 
severity of adverse events (AEs) associated with the attenuated DHIM -1 will be evaluated in the 
vaccinated ADVP004 volunteers and unvaccinated dengue -naïve control v olunteers with 
statistical comparisons both within and between groups.  
The primary endpoints to address safety are as follow s: 
• Occurrence, intensity, and duration of solicited injection site symptoms until [ADDRESS_581234] 
virus inoculation  
• Occurrence, intensity, and duration of unsolicited injection site symptoms until [ADDRESS_581235] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], wh ichever is later  
• Occurrence, intensity, and duration of solicited systemic symptoms until [ADDRESS_581236] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], whichever is later

which ever is later  
• Number of SAEs until [ADDRESS_581241] virus inoculation  
• The occurrence of fever defined as greater than or equal to 38°C (100.4° F) measured at 
least [ADDRESS_581242] 4 hours apart  
7.1.2.   Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints align wi th the viremia and immunogenicity objectives. Dengue viremia 
will be examined both as a binary endpoint (present or not present) and as a function of area under 
the curve (AUC) : 
• Viremia by [CONTACT_922] -polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) up to [ADDRESS_581243] 
virus inoculation  
• MN50 antibody titers following inoculation in vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers  at 
[ADDRESS_581244] in oculation  
 
7.1.3.   Exploratory Endpoints  
The endpoints for the characterization of response to the challenge virus may inclu de the 
following : 
• Proteomics  - microarray  
• Cell mediated immunity (CMI)  
• Transcriptomics  (including single -cell transcriptomic assays)  
• Evolutionary analysis of DHIM -1 strain whole genome sequence (consensus and 
quasi -species)  
7.2. Overall Study Design  
The goal of the study will be to compare  the level of protection (as determined by [CONTACT_454681]) against  dengue serotype [ADDRESS_581245] utilizing TDEN PIV  and TDEN LAV  and compared to unvaccinated controls.  A 
Dengue Illness Index (DII) will assess the following parameters descriptively and as a function of 
a numerical calculated va lue between vaccinated and unvaccinated controls.  
The clinical characteristics  (the level of uncomplicated dengue measured ) are defined as:  
1. Measurable viremia by [CONTACT_937] -PCR and duration  in days  
2. Viremia by [CONTACT_4503] -PCR (pfu/mL ) and calculated AUC

will be provided to the volunteer  before any study procedure is performed.  
Volunteers  will b e given a test on their  understanding of the information from this informed 
consent an d they  must score at least 75% correct in order to continue with th e screening process. 
In case they  do not pass the test on the fi rst try with a score of 75%, they  will be given [ADDRESS_581270] (3 total). All questions and answ ers will be reviewed for all candidate 
volunteers . 
9.2. Screening  
 
9.2.1.   Screening Visit 1 (Day -90 to -1) 
After signing and dating the ICF, previously vaccinated and unvaccinated  volunteers  will be 
sequentially assigned a  unique  volunteer  identifier number  starting with -001. The screening 
process is a two -step process occurring over a minimum of two visits. The procedures and 
assessments listed in Table 3 , Day -90 and Day -28, respectively, will be carried out for each 
volunteer  to determ ine their eligibility for participation in the study.  
• The informed consent process will be performed  
• Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed  
• Demographic information will be collected  
• A complete medical history will be collected  
• Concomitant medic ations will be recorded  
• A complete physical examination will be performed including the collection of vital signs 
(Heart rate and blood pressure) and temperature   
• Urine will be collected for pregnancy test, females only  
• Blood will be drawn for screening se rology tests  (valid for 56 days prior to enrollment  after 
which tests will be repeated )  
- Blood will be drawn for safety labs which consist of complete blood count  and 
differential  (WBC, h emoglo bin, platelet s, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts ), liver 
functi on tests  (AST/ALT , serum chemistry (Cr, glucose ), prothrombin time/partial  
prothrombin time, albumin, and fibrinogen

9.2.2.   Screening Visit 2  
After the initial screening visit, available information will be reviewed to assess eligibility. If the 
unvaccinated volunteer  is eligible to continue, a second screening visit will be completed  
(volunteers from the ADVP003 or -[ADDRESS_581272] procedures completed in a single screening 
visit to minimize inconvenience and travel to the greater Baltimore -Washington area) : 
• Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be re -assessed  
• Medical history will be u pdated  
• Concomitant medications will be reviewed and updated  
• Vital signs (Heart rate and blood pressure) and temperature  will be performed  
• Unvaccinated control volunteers will have b lood drawn for screening serology test to 
include neutralizing antibodies t o dengue, West Nile, Yellow Fever, Japanese B 
encephalitis and Zika.   
• Safety labs that were exclusionary grade 1 in abnormality may be repeated if the 
investigator believes that there is a laboratory error or reasonable transient explanation for 
the abnorm ality (e .g., elevated AST after vigorous exercise), or is the result of a normal 
variant of a healthy state.   
• Blood will be drawn for research assays which consist of serum for microarray and 
ELISAs, PBMC for core cellular assays and scRNAseq and transcriptome analysis  
All screening related procedures and assessments should be completed no more than 90 days prior  
to inoculation. If volunteer  is not inoculated within 56 days of screening, they will be re -screened 
before inoculation with the possible exception of FV, HIV and hepatitis serologies (if < 6 months). 
Laboratory evaluation for FVs will be considered evalu able for inclusion/exclusion for up to [ADDRESS_581273] positive for Zika antibodies, they will be referred to their healthcare provider for 
additional follow -up and retesting . Close observation will be made between pre -vaccination 
(ADVP003 or ADVP004) titers and pre -challenge titers to ascertain if this represents a new 
infection, antibody decay or potential cross -reactions with the previous dengue vaccination. 
Although most antibody positive cases are asymptomatic, there is a chance for sexual transmission. 
We will counsel the volunteer  to abstain from sexual activity, reduce the exposure to mosquito 
bites and see their doctor immediately.  
When a volunteer  has com pleted the screening visits and is eligible and willing to continue 
participation, he/she  will be scheduled for inoculation (Day 0). Information on volunteers  that fail 
the screening visit(s) will not be recorded in the data management system.

admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the procedures for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_454633]  (Table 4 ) will be followed.  
9.3.1.  Day 0 Inoculation  
To confirm a volunteer  is still eligible the following procedures will be completed prior to 
inoculation:  
• Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed  
• Medical history will be reviewed  
• A targeted  physical examination, including vital signs  (HR and BP)  and temperature, will be 
conducted  
• Concomitant medications will be reviewed  
• Screening s afety lab results will be re-reviewed  
• In the event of ongoing local transmission of the C OVID -19 virus, an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (e.g.

V04.0, 04 Jan 2021  52  9.4. Inpatient Admission  
9.4.1. Criteria for Admission to Inpatient Service  
Due to the possibility of signs and symptoms associated with dengue fever, and the presence of 
mosquitoes theoretically competent for  dengue virus, volunteers will be admitted to an inpatient 
service for observation if defined criteria are met. Viremia is expected, on average, to occur 
between days 5 -16 after challenge  (D0) . Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopi[INVESTIGATOR_40643] , mosquito dengue 
vectors found in the [LOCATION_002], are present in the mid -Atlantic region of Maryland, and have 
the potential to transmit  Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and other viruses. Infected mosquitoes are 
not present in this area,  but their presence re quires vigilance by [CONTACT_454692].  The CDC website notes 12 imported cases, 
and no locally transmitted cases of dengue were detected in the state of Maryland and reported 
throu gh ArboNET in 2019 (as of October 2, 2019).36 Volunteers  will be sequestered within a local 
hotel (e.g. the Lord Baltimore or Hotel  Monaco ) if asymptomatic save for viremia or  admitted to 
the inpatient  facility  (Pharmaron or the GCRC ) for closer observation if any of  the following 
additional criteria are met  (or arise during the sequestration phase).  If volunteers r emain viremic 
for periods beyond Day 16 , they will remain seques tered or an inpatient until documented 
clearance.  If a DHIM occurs in late autumn/winter months in which there  are no circulating Aedes  
spp., viremia will not result in  sequestration  (sustained temperatures above 59° F required for 
Aedes albopi[INVESTIGATOR_40643] ).43 This would conservatively range from November to April.   Note:  If local 
pandemic conditions continu e, volunteers will be encouraged to sequester at the local hotel  from 
the time of challenge onwards. If local, they will be asked to self -quarantine at hom e and apply 
social distancing standards to minimize any inadvertent exposure to the SARS -CoV-2 virus.  
Temperatures and vital signs will be monitored daily and an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (e.g. NP or nasal)  
swab obtained for SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_581278] temperatur e (>100.4F) to distinguish the fever 
from that related to COVID -19. 
Sequester  Criteria : 
− Viremia (D+24 h) as detected by [CONTACT_937] -qPCR  during the months of May through October  
 
Inpatient  Criteria :   
− Viremia (D+24 h) as detected by [CONTACT_937] -qPCR and two or more of the following symptoms : 
Symptoms /lab parameters : 
− Fever ( > 100.4°F)  at [ADDRESS_581279] 4 hours apart in the  absence of antipyretic

admission (i .e., viremia  and/or  > grade 2 symptoms ) resolve and  meet the discharge criteria 
(Section 9.4.3. ).  
Volunteers  will not be admitted if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_17439], an unrelated medical condition is 
responsible for the volunteer  meeting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383803] . If required, the volunteer will be 
referred to their primary care physician for evaluation.  Of special con cern is the underlying risk of 
exposure to SARS -CoV -2.  Close attention will be paid to symptoms consistent with COVID -19 
illness to include upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] (new or increased nasal discharge, sore throat, 
shortness of breath, wheezing, or the on set of loss of taste or smell).  If necessary, additional testing 
or referrals for nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID -19 PCR may be done.  
9.4.2.  Procedures During Inpatient Admission  
Once a volunteer  is admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the Dengue Human Infection Model Clinical 
Observation and Inpatient  Management Phase Algorithm , will be followed. The procedures are 
listed in Table 4  and summarized below.  
During inpatient admission and sequestration , the fol lowing procedures will be performed daily: 
A symptom -driven physical exam, AE /SAE assessment, concomitant medication review, and 
Memory  card review if applicable . The presence of viremia (RT -qPCR) will be checked daily from 
Days 4 -16 (or extended until cle arance if viremia continues past Day 16). Research sample 
collection will be performed according to  Tables 3  and 4. Safety labs will be  performed every 
other day ( Table 4 ) and consist  of complete blood count, liver function tests, Cr, prothrombin 
time/partial prothrombin time, albumin and fibrinogen. In addition to the previously described 
procedures, the following daily additional procedures will be followed for the inpatient phase of 
the study. T he volunteer ’s temperature and other vi tal signs will be measured at least 3 times per 
day (q 8 hours +/ - 1 hour) , or more if needed for volunteer  care, and f luid intake and output  
measurement will be recorded on the volunteer ’s medical record . The standard of care is at the 
discretion of the P I and may include medication for management of pain, antipyretics 
(acetaminophen), the management of fluid loss through oral or IV hydration, monitoring and 
periodic clinical assessment, and judicious fluid replacement.

severe symptoms, dengue with  warning signs or severe symptoms may occur. Experienced 
clinicians will be expected to treat patients in accordance with the protocol and using  the CDC and 
WHO guide lines  as reference .  
9.4.3.  Criteria for Discharge/Release from Sequestration or Inpatient Admission  
The actual discharge day will vary by [CONTACT_454684] . For volunteers  to be discharged from observation, 
the following criteria must be met:  
Sequestration:  
• Two negative qualitative RT -PCR tests for dengue run on samples obtained via [ADDRESS_581282] 8 hours apart  
Inpatient admission:  
• Amelioration of symptoms to < grade 2 admission criterion* and:  
• No fever (< 100.4°F)  
• Laboratory parameters resolving and are  admission grade criteria , at clinician discretion  
• Clinical symptoms are resolving and are  grade 2, at clinician discretion  
*Note:  Will continue daily follow -up until two negative qualitative RT -PCR tests for de ngue 
obtained on [ADDRESS_581283] inoculation, only if discharge occurs prior 
to Day 28.  All volunteers  will be seen on  Days 56, 90, and 180 (2,  3, and [ADDRESS_581284] inoculation) 
according t o Table 3  and Table 4.   
9.5. Biological Samples  
9.5.1.  Biological Sample Handling    
Samples will be coded with information including, but not limited to, volunteer  study number, 
study time -point, sample type and date/time. Samples will not be labeled with information that 
directly identifies the volunteer . WRAIR investigators with access to study data from 
ADVP003 and ADVP004 may have access to subject identifiers f rom these studies as 
information will be shared to facilitate research. However, laboratory investigators will not 
have access to this level of information.  Samples will be held in storage until exhausted 
through use in research assays or until directed to  be destroyed by [CONTACT_454693] (e.g. FDA, [LOCATION_003]MRDC etc.). Samples sent to WRAIR will follow these 
same guidelines and will be dispositioned and tracked by [CONTACT_454694].

that new tests work reliably and are comparable to previous methods.   
It may be desirable to use the samples acquired in this study for future researc h, not described in 
this protocol. Therefore, all volunteers  will be asked to give a specific consent to allow the 
sponsor’s representative to use the samples for future research.  
Volunteers  not authorizing future use of samples will be tracked, and their  samples will be 
destroyed upon completion of the study  (note: samples intended to be run as part of the study 
endpoints and/or exploratory analyses will continue until completion ). Samples stored for future 
use will be stored indefinitely , unless  local rules, regulations or guidelines require different 
timeframes or different procedures.  
A volunteer  may decide at any point during the study to withdraw consent for the future use of 
his/her samples. Should a volunteer  withdraw consent for the futur e use of his /her samples, 
remaining samples will be destroyed after the conclusion of testing for this clinical study. Testing 
sites will provide verification of destruction in writing to the clinical site.  
9.6. Concomitant Medications  
Volunteers  are not b eing asked to discontinue current medications. In the event that medical 
conditions not related to the study arise after inoculation and dictate use of medications, volunteers  
are encouraged to obtain appropriate care, comply with the course of therapy as prescribed by [CONTACT_153155], and inform the investigators as soon as practicable. Details of all medications taken 
during the course of this study must be recorded on the volunteer ’s record.  Some medications will 
be exclusionary (e .g. HMG -CoA reductase i nhibitors which have been shown to ameliorate dengue 
viremia).  
Volunteers  should not use any aspi[INVESTIGATOR_44285] -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 
including Advil, Motrin, Nuprin, Aleve, Naproxen, and Celebrex, during the [ADDRESS_581286] 
severe dengue infection with bleeding problems ; however , it is still rec ommended to avoid these 
drugs. The investigators may recommend Tylenol or Paracetamol, which can be used safely for 
fevers and body aches.

9.8. Serum Antibodies  
Blood samples will be obtained for the measurement of antibodies against the four dengue 
serotypes, DENV -1-4 and quantification of neutralizing antibodies via the MN50 
microneutralization assay to be performed at WRAIR.  Anti-dengue IgG , IgA  and IgM may be 
measured using research lab  (WRAIR)  or commercial ELISA kits. Other functional assays, such 
as in vitro anti body -dependent enhancement (ADE) assays or antibody depletion assays may also 
be used to characterize serum antibodies.  Screening flavivirus neutralization assays will be 
performed by [CONTACT_454695][INVESTIGATOR_454635].  
 
9.9. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Detection of Viremia  
Blood samples will be obtained for measurement of leve ls of viremia using qualitative and/or 
quantitative (qPCR).  Samples will be analyzed in real time (RT) in house using nucleic acid -
based methods for the detection and quantification of dengue virus.  WRAIR laboratories may be 
involved in the performance of  this testing if needed.  
 
9.10.  Immune Responses  
Cryopre served peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be tested for innate, T and B cell 
profiling and/or cellular immune responses, antigen -specific cytokine responses, chemokines and 
cell surface markers in order to examine the acquisition of T  and B  cell memory response s 
following challenge. Conventional flow cytometry (CFCM) and CyTOF® and Helios® mass 
cytometers may be utilized for novel examinations of the memory response.  Panels of 30 -38 
parameters are designed to identify innate mechanisms of immune response, effector/memory and 
peripheral T follicular helper cell subsets, pro -inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production, T 
cell homing patterns, B cell profiling, and the act ivation status of various T cell subsets. The use 
of a human challenge model will allow for investigation of predominant  anti-DENV immune 
responses and the kinetics to examine early responses , and identify immune signatures, which 
differ in susceptible and  resistant volunteers that may elucidate important correlates of protection.  
If funds allow, studies to investigate antigen -specific T cell functional responses against various 
DENV -derived antigens (e.g., whole cell DENV homogenate, overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_454636], etc.) will 
be performed.  WRAIR laboratories will be involved in the performance of some of this testing.

V04.0, 04 Jan 2021  57  9.11. Transcriptomics   
A global approach to transcriptional analyses will be performed for gene expression analysis 
during primary infection using  the HTA 2.0 array and/or total ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA -
Seq). This approach allows for unbiased analysis of genes regulated in response to dengue 
infection and has the potential to identify key pathways modulated. Initial analysis will focus on 
activation of innate immune pathways, as this type of analysis has not been possible in the natural 
infection setting. Given that the innate immune system is key to generating an effective acquired 
immune response, identification of key innate pathways regul ated during infection may provide 
rational targets for enhancing a protective immune response. Subsequent confirmation of select 
targets will be done by [CONTACT_454696] . Blood will be collected directly 
into P AXg ene® sample preparati on tubes optimized for stabilizing RNA for long -term storage 
prior to transcriptional profiling. Genetic testing may be performed on these samples only after 
specific informed consent is acquired for such testing and IRB approval is obtained.  Additionally,  
minor variant sequence analysis may be performed utilizing RNA.  WRAIR laboratories will be 
involved in the performance of some of this testing.  
9.12. Single cell RNA Sequencing (scRNAseq)  
A global approach to characterizing cell populations will be pursued using the 10X Genomics 
Single Cell Immune Profiling technique which allows for a kinetic examination of the adaptive 
immune response in a subset of lymphocytes collected over the course o f the DHIM.  Barcoding 
technology allows for enhanced immune cell phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_454637]. unvaccinated controls. WRAIR laboratories will be involved in the 
performance of some of this testing.  
10.0.  SAFETY ASSESSMENT  
10.1. Consortium Data Safety Committee  
The core Consortium Data Safety Committee (CDSC) includes, at a minimum, each site Principal 
Investigator (or designate), the protocol Independent Safety Monitor/Research Monitor 
(ISM/RM), and the IND spons or Medical Officer.  Participants in the CDSC reviews may also 
include site Assistant/Associate Investigators, or designated team representatives including but not 
limited to study coo rdinators , study clinicians, or protocol specialists. The CDSC performs the 
safety reviews for the DHIM’s conducted as part of the Dengue Consortium operations and  will 
perform safety reviews and review the summary of study safety data reports on a weekly basis 
through [ADDRESS_581287] study

10.3. IND Safety Reporting Definitions  
The following terms, as defined by 21 CFR 312.32, apply to IND safety reporting . 
 
10.3.1. Adverse Event/Suspected Adverse Reaction/Unexpected Adverse Reaction  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than 
adverse reactio n, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure  or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed . For 
exampl e, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) 
if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, 
cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpec ted (by [CONTACT_36093]) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as 
used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned in the investigator broch ure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from

V04.0, 04 Jan 2021  59  the pharmacological properties of the drug but  are not specifically mentioned as occurring with 
the particular drug under investigation.  
See Section 10.6 for Adverse Event Reporting  
10.3.2.  Solicited Adverse Event  
A solicited AE is a predetermined event, identified in the investigator’s brochure  (IB), which may 
reflect safety concerns related to the investigational product. The solicited AEs for this study 
include:  
• Fever ≥ 38°C (100.4°F)  
• Rash  
• Headache  
• Retro -orbital (eye) pain  
• Muscle pain (Myalgia)  
• Arthralgia ( Joint ) pain and/or bone pain  
• Fatigue and/or malaise (w eakness ) 
• Pain at injection site  
• Swelling at injection site  
• Erythema at injection site  
• GI Symptoms ( Abdominal pain , naus ea, vomiting)  
Solicited AEs will be captured during all clinical visits . 
Refer to Section 10.9 .1 for adverse event reporting.  
10.3.3. Serious Adverse Event/Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_27362]’s Representative , it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening adverse event  
• Unanticipated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_165843]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening ” if, in the view of 
either the PI [INVESTIGATOR_27362]’s Representative, its occurrence places the patient or volunteer  at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might  have caused death.

IND 016332 ; CVD Dengue [ZIP_CODE]  Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health  
 
V04.0, 04 Jan 2021  60  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_454639], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the patient or volunteer  and may require  medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do  not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
For the purposes of this study, planned inpatient admission  for dengue symptoms without serious 
deterioration in health, will not be considered an SAE as it is a n expected outcome. Inpatient 
admission  (defined as admission  resulting in an overnight stay of  > 24h ) not related to dengue 
symptoms will be considered an SAE.  
See Section 10.9.2 for SAE reporting.  
10.3.4. Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks To Volunteers  Or Others 
(UPI[INVESTIGATOR_16104])  
Federal regulations require that unanticipated problems involving risks to volunteers  or others be 
promptly reported to the IRB. These events encompass a broader category of events t han SAEs 
and may include issues such as problems with loss of control of volunteer  data or the 
investigational product, adverse psychological reactions, or breach of confidentiality. Risks to 
others (e.g., program personnel) must also be reported.  
Unantici pated problems involving risks to volunteers  or others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_16104]) are any incident, 
experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the procedures that are 
described in the protocol, investigators brochure or informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the volunteer  population;  
• Related or possibly related to a volunteer ’s participation in the study; and  
• Suggests that the study places volunteers  or others at a gr eater risk of harm than was 
previously known or recognized.  
The IRB will evaluate the PI’s and safety monitor’s reports to determine whether a given incident, 
experience or outcome constitutes an unanticipated problem involving risk to volunteers  or others  
and, in coordination with the Sponsor’s Representative, ensure upward reporting of the 
unanticipated problems involving risk to volunteers  or others to the appropriate regulatory offices.  
See Section 10.9.2. for UPI[INVESTIGATOR_272917].  
10.3.5. Pregnancy  
Volunt eers who become pregnant after Day 0 will be followed to term, and the following 
information will be gathered for outcome, date of delivery, health status of the mother and child 
including the child’s gender, height /length , and weight. Complications and or  abnormalities should

a physician can make this determination.  
Table  7: Adverse Event Relationship to Investigational Product Categories  
Category  Description  
Not related  No relationship to investigational product. Applies to those events for which evidence 
exists that there is an alternate etiology.  
Unlikely  Likely unrelated to the investigational product. Likely to be related to factors other than 
investigational product but  cannot be rule d out with certainty.  
Possible  An association between the event and the administration of investigational product 
cannot be ruled out. There is a reasonable temporal association, but there may also be an 
alternative etiology such as the volunteer ’s clinical status or underlying factors including 
other therapy.  
Probable  There is a high degree of certainty that a relationship to the investigational product exists. 
There is a reasonable temporal association, and the event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_454697] ’s clinical state or factors including oth er therapy.  
Definite  An association exists between the receipt of investigational product and the event. An 
association to other factors has been ruled out  
To align consortium protocols, AE relationship  uses 5 categories of relatedness  (defined above), 
which are to be used for this clinical trial . The category of “Not Related” maps to the dual  
category of “Not Related ,” while the categories of “Unlikely ,” “Possible ,” “Probable ,” and 
“Definite” map to the dual category of “Related .” 
10.5. Severity Assessme nt 
All AEs will be assessed for severity by [CONTACT_093]. Inherent in this assessment is the medical 
and clinical consideration of all information surrounding the event including any medical 
intervention required. Each event will be assigned 1 of the f ollowing categories: mild, moderate, 
severe, potentially life -threatening, or fatal using the criteria in the FDA’s Guidance for Industry: 
Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative 
Vaccine Trials ( 2014 ) summarized in Appendix A . Any AE not included in the scale will be graded 
according to Table  8. For laboratory results, any event identified as abnormal according to the 
Clinical Protoc ol ADVP005  The University of Maryland, Baltimore   
IND 016332 ; CVD Dengue [ZIP_CODE]  Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health  
 
V04.0, 04 Jan 2021  62  local laboratory normal ranges will also be graded according to the FDA’s Toxicity Grading Scale 
(Tables 12 and 13) in Appendix A .  
FDA guidelines for toxicity will be followed; however, if a volunteer  is evaluated in an emergency 
room for nonlife threatening illness or symptoms (i.e., visits emergency department on weekend 
for mild problems beca use the physician’s office is closed), the information from that visit will be 
reviewed and severity of the adverse event will be assessed according to the volunteer ’s clinical 
signs and symptoms.  
As defined by [CONTACT_284367], the term “severe” is often used to describe intensity 
(severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event 
itself however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is 
not the same as “seriou s”, which is based on volunteer /event outcome or action  criteria usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a volunteer ’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not 
severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Table  8: Adverse Event Severity Categories  
Category  Grade  Description  
Mild  1 Does not interfere with routine activities  
Minimal level of discomfort  
Moderate  2 Interferes with routine activities  
Moderate level of discomfort  
Severe  3 Unable to perform routine activities  
Significant level of discomfort  
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 3 is a 
category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as 
Grade 3 .  
10.6. Recording Adverse Events  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_454640], annual, and/or final 
reports. The study site will provide data files for preparation of annual and final reports to the 
FDA.  
10.6.1. Methods/Timing f or Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Endpoints  
AEs and SAEs  will be assessed at all study visits, documented in the source records, and recorded 
on the eCRF’s using accepted medical terms and/or the diagnoses that accurately characterize the 
event. When a diagnosis is known, the AE term recorded on the eCRF will b e the diagnosis rather 
than a constellation of symptoms. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_454641], relationship to 
investigational product, severity, and other possible etiologies. When an event has not resolved by 
[CONTACT_454698] ’s participatio n (6 months), it will be documented on the AE eCRF as “not 
recovered/not resolved”.

V04.0, 04 Jan 2021  63  The timeframe for the collection of AEs begins at time of inoculation (Day 0) through end of 
volunteer ’s participation (6 months). SAEs will also be collected from Day 0 th rough end of 
volunteer ’s study participation (6 months).  
The timeframe for the collection of solicited AEs begins at the administration of investigational 
product through Day 28 (Local injection site solicited AEs will be collected through Day 7). All 
solicited AEs collected in the first 28 days will be considered ‘definitely related’ to the 
investigational product unless they can be attributed to a known cause unrelated to the 
investigational agent.  
10.6.2. Duration of Follow -Up of Volunteers  after Serious Adverse Events  
Investigators are required to follow SAEs to resolution, even if this extends beyond the prescribed 
reporting period. Resolution is the return to baseline status or stabilization of the condi tion with 
the probability that it will become chronic. The SAE outcomes will be reported to the sponsor’s 
representative using the Serious Adverse Event Report Form.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAEs in former volunteers ; however, if a SAE, 
considered to be related to the investigational product is brought to the attention of the investigator 
at any time following completion of the study, the event will be reported to the sponsor’s 
representative’s safety office  as defined in Section 9. 
10.7. Study Halting  Criteria  
The PI, study site  safety office, or the sponsor’s representative will place the study on hold for any 
of the following criteria:  
Further enrollment and study inoculation  will be halted for safety review  if any of the following  
are reported:  
1. Any volunteer  experiences a study product -related SAE from the time of the study 
product administration through the volunteer ’s last study visit.  
2. Any volunteer  experiences laryngospasm, bronchospasm, generalized urticaria or 
anaphylaxis with in [ADDRESS_581292].  
This trial will also be halted for safety review  if any of the following occurs:  
1. Two or more volunteers  experience a Grade [ADDRESS_581293] and not 
resolved or improved to lower grade within 2  days.

adverse event (excluding leukopenia that would be expected with a viral 
infection) that is considered anything other than not related to study product.  
In addition, the PI, sponsor’s representative, UMB  IRB or the FDA may place this study on hold 
at any time.  
Grading scales for solicited local (application site) and sy stemic  AEs are included in Appendix 
A. 
Grading scales for clinical safety laboratory adverse events are included in Appendix A . 
10.8. Termination Rules  
If the AE/SAE profile is not acceptable to the PI, sponsor’s safety office, sponsor’s representative, 
Consortium Data Safety Committee (CDSA)  or FDA, the trial may be terminated.  
If the trial is terminated, a notification (via memo) indicating the reasons  for suspending the study 
will be provided by [CONTACT_456]’s representative to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_71467].

• Statistical methods and tests that will be used to an alyze the endpoints,  
• Strategy that will be used if the statistical test assumptions are not satisfied,  
• Specification of potential adjusted analyses and a statement with which covariates or factors 
will be included,  
• Planned exploratory analyses and justi fication of their importance, and  
• Any subgroup effects with biological justification and support from within and outside the 
study.  
11.1. Description of Statistical Methods  
Descriptive analysis of safety and reactogenicity outcomes will include all volunteers  who meet 
the eligibility criteria, receive inoculation , and for whom safety data are available. Summary tables 
will be created in which incidence, severity , and relationship to the use of investigational product 
of individual solicited local and  systemic signs, symptoms, or trending unsolicited events are 
delineated by [CONTACT_2060], severity, gender, and overall. Unsolicited AEs and SAEs will be 
analyzed in a similar fashion.  
Analysis of the data from this study will be descriptive in nature. The primary endpoints align with 
the safety and clinical objectives. The nature, frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs) 
associated with the attenuated DHIM -1 will be evaluated in the vaccinated ADVP004  and 
ADVP003  volunteers and unvaccinated dengue -naïve control volunteers with statistical 
comparisons both within and between groups.  
For hematology and serum chemistry tests, any clinically significant changes from baseline value , 
and between groups,  will be identified. As an example, but not limited to t he following, dengue 
viremia will be examined both as a binary endpoint (present or not present) and as a function of 
area under the curve (AUC).   Mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and possibly median 
and quartiles will be used for continuous dat a and number and percentage will be used for 
categorical data, unless specified otherwise in the section below.  Confidence intervals and p values 
will be calculated as appropriate.  
There will be a final statistical analysis conducted following the end of all study visits.  
11.1.1. Analysis Addressing the Primary Endpoints  
The primary endpoints align with the safety and clinical objectives . The nature, frequency and 
severity of adverse events (AEs) associated with the attenuated DHIM -1 will be evaluated in the 
vaccinated ADVP003/ ADVP004 volunteers and unvaccinated dengue -naïve control volunteers  
individually and as a comparison between group s. This analysis will be primarily descriptive in 
nature and is not expected to provide statistically significant differentiation between the study 
groups. This portion of the analysis will be performed primarily to contribute further data to the 
safety an d reactogenicity performance parameters of the DHIM -1 challenge material in both 
vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers.

V04.0, 04 Jan 2021  69  The safety analysis set (SafAS) will be used for the analysis of safety data in this study. The SafAS  
population consists of all volunt eers who are inoculated.  
Individual solicited local AEs over the [ADDRESS_581298] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (whichever is later) will be analyzed.  
The incidence, intensity, and relation ship of individual solicited AEs to the inoculation  will be 
calculated overall and by [CONTACT_19313]. Abnormal laboratory measurements that occur following each 
inoculation will be summarized overall, and by [CONTACT_454702]. 
Presentat ions will include the number and percentage of volunteers  with at least 1 solicited 
symptom (local or systemic), at least [ADDRESS_581299] 1 general (systemic) symptom, 
as well as the incidence of each symptom individually.  
The number of volun teers  with at least [ADDRESS_581300] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (whichever is later) will also be 
summarized overall and by [CONTACT_7169]. The intensity and temporal relationship of the unso licited 
symptoms to inoculation will also be assessed. Presentations will also summarize unsolicited AEs 
by [CONTACT_6764], grade , and relatedness to virus inoculation. For the tabulation of the AEs by [CONTACT_110377], a volunteer  will be counted only once in a g iven body system. For example, a volunteer  
reporting nausea and diarrhea will be reported as 1 volunteer , but the symptoms will be listed as 2 
separate AEs within the class. Therefore, the total number of AEs reported within a body system 
may exceed the nu mber of volunteers  within the body system reporting AEs. SAEs occurring at 
any point during the trial will be summarized and relatedness to virus inoculation will be assessed. 
Serious and/or unexpected AEs will also be discussed on a case -by-case basis.  
A Dengue Illness Index  (Table 11 ) will be calculated for each volunteer.   A calculated score will 
be generated on each volunteer which will allow for a statistical analysis of the values tabulated 
between the vaccinated and unvaccinated controls.  The Dengue  Illness Index will be compared 
between vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers using statistical testing such as Fisher’s exact test 
or T-test to evaluate for statistically significant differences between these two groups. P -values 
less than 0.05 will be c onsidered significant for analysis performed within this protocol.  The 
number, percentage and severity score of volunteers  in each group with each of the following 
clinical or laboratory symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_454703] : 
-  Fever greater than or equal to 38°C (100.4°F)  [measured at least [ADDRESS_581301] four hours 
apart in 24 hours]  
-  Headache/retro -orbital pain  
- Rash  
-  Fatigue and/or malaise  
-  Myalgia  
-  Arthralgia and/or bone pain  
- GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain)

A scoring system will be used to evaluate symptoms (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = 
severe)  on a daily basis and a total will be calculated representing the mean of the summation of 
total number of days of symptoms (A), the number of symptoms per day (B) and the maximum 
severity score (grade 0 -3) (C) (See Table 11 ).  Volunteers may also be categorized based upon 
the 2009 revised WHO guidelines (Dengue without warning signs, dengue with warning signs 
and severe dengue).44 Note:  Tourniquet tests will be performed at investigator discretion.

11.1.3. Analysis Addressing the Secondary Endpoints  
The performance of the challenge virus at a certain dose up to 28 days after inoculation will be 
assessed descriptively using the following parameters:  
Analysis of the secondary endpoints will be applied on per protocol population. Only those 
volunteers  who re ceive inoculations will be included in the analysis.  The analysis of secondary 
endpoints will include analysis viremia magnitude and kinetics  (area under the curve) which will 
be compared between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups using statistical te sts such as t -test 
and Kaplan Meier analysis to evaluate for statistically significant differences between these 
groups.  
11.1.4. Analysis Addressing the Exploratory Endpoints  
There are no hypotheses. All of the main analysis will be descriptive.  Analyses i nvolving t he 
immune /immunogenetic  response to the challenge virus at a certain dose may be characterized 
descriptively  (but are not limited to) : 
• GMT and geometric mean titer rates (GMTRs) of neutralizing antibody titer levels (measured 
by [CONTACT_454704]) at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months after inoculation  
• Number and percentage of volunteers  with a titer ≥10  
• CMI data: descriptive statistical summaries will be provided to describe data by [CONTACT_6490] . 
• Genetic (RNA) data to include minor variant sequence analysis, whole genome RNA -seq, 
and/or transcriptomic analysis  
• ADE assay data  
Analysis of the exploratory endpoints will be applied on the full analysis set and per protocol 
population. Only those volunteers  who receive inoculations will be includ ed in the analysis.  
11.2. Planned Enrollment and Reason for Sample Size  
As this study has no statistical hypothesis test, there is no formal power calculation.  The sample 
of [ADDRESS_581303] vaccination schedules has been determined primarily on the basis of available funding 
for a study of this nature along with the available pool of previously vaccinated volunteers who 
remain available and potentially willing to parti cipate in this study. The control arm of previously 
unvaccinated and flavivirus naïve volunteers has been set at 5 based upon standards set using 
previous challenge models which will allow a reasonable comparison group  for those symptoms 
and criteria that are expected to occur in >90% of subjects inoculated which would include viremia 
and at least one dengue like symptoms based on previous studies with this challenge virus strain.  
Clinical Protoc ol ADVP005  The University of Maryland, Baltimore

rate is 26%.  At least 7/[ADDRESS_581305] seroconvert to establish a true seroconversion rate of 
no less than 30% with 95% confidence.  
With 10 consecutive successes of meeting the desired performance parameters, it can be concluded 
with 95% confidence that the future success rate of the DENV -1-LVHC virus challenge is expected 
to be greater than 74%. 
11.3. Procedures for Reporting Deviatio ns from the Original Statistical Plan  
Any deviation(s) from the original statistical plan as indicated in the protocol will be described in 
an amendment to the protocol and in the SAP.  
11.4. Selection of Volunteers  to be Included in Analyses  
Three analysis sets will be used: The Per -Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS), the Full Analysis Set 
(FAS), and the Safety Analysis Set ( SafAS ). 
11.4.1. Safety Analysis Set  
The SafAS is defined as those volunteers , who meet the eligibility criteria, received the virus 
inoculation , and for whom safety data are ava ilable  
11.4.2. Full Analysis Set  
The FAS is defined as those volunteers , who meet the eligibility criteria, received the virus 
inoculation,  and for whom performance data are available.  
11.4.3. Per-Protocol Analysis Set  
The PPAS will include all volunteers  who meet the definition of the SafAS and had none of the  
following protocol deviations:   
1. Administration of inoculation was not done as per protocol (site and route of administration)  
2. Volunteer  received a dose other than  the one that he/she was expected to receive  
3. Volunteer  received a protocol -restricted medication  
4. Volunteer  did not complete the study due to being lost to follow up (during the [ADDRESS_581306] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], whichever is later), but not due to 
withdrawn consent  
11.4.4. Populations Used in Analyses  
The safety analyses will be performed on the SafAS. Volunteers  will be analyzed according to the 
inoculation  they actually received.  
The performance analyses will be performed  on the FAS and PPAS. Volunteers  will be analyzed 
according to the inoculation they actually received.

produced. They will generally be identified as summarizing or listi ng data from the PPAS.  
If exploratory endpoint data become available, exploratory analysis set will be defined in separate 
documents defining the analyses planned for those populations and data.  
11.5. Handling of Missing Data and Outliers  
Missing data will be handled according to Table 1 2.  
Table  12: Methods for Handling Missing Data and Outliers  
Data  Handling Method  
Safety  Missing data will not be replaced with imputed values.  
Causality  Non-serious unsolicited AEs and SAEs with missing causality will be considered as 
related to inoculation.  
Measurements  Missing measurement (for temperature) will not be replaced. Nevertheless,  the following 
rule will be applied: If temperature is partially missing after decimal point, the data w ill be

13.1. Study Monitoring  
Study monitoring will be the responsibility of ICON . Upon successful approval of the protocol 
and establishment of the regulatory file, the clinical monitor will establish a clinical monitoring 
plan. To ensure that the investigator and the study staff unde rstand and accept their defined 
responsibilities, the clinical monitor will maintain regular correspondence with the site and may 
be present during the course of the study to verify the acceptability of the facilities, compliance 
with the investigational p lan and relevant regulations, and the maintenance of complete records. 
As needed, the clinical monitor may witness the informed consent process or other applicable 
study procedures to assure the safety of volunteers  and the investigators’ compliance with t he 
protocol and GCPs.  
Monitoring visits by a sponsor’s representative -designated clinical monitor will be scheduled to 
take place at the initiation of the study, during the study at appropriate intervals, and after the last 
volunteer  has completed the stud y. A report of monitoring observations will be provided to the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_11305]’s office, at a minimum.  
13.2. Audits and Inspections  
Auditing of the clinical trial may be conducted at any time during the study to ensure continued 
compliance with regulat ions, policies, and procedures. Authorized representatives of the sponsor, 
the FDA, the independent ethics committee or IRB may visit the site to perform audits or 
inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of the audit or inspection is t o 
systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to determine 
whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported 
according to the protocol, GCP guideline of the ICH, and a ny applicable regulatory requirements. 
Audit findings will be documented in a formal audit report that will detail the conduct of the audit 
and summarize the observations noted.  
The investigator should contact [CONTACT_456]’s office immediately if contact[CONTACT_257216] a regulatory 
agency about an  inspection.

conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and policies including the Declaration of 
Helsinki, ICH Guidelines, US 32 CFR 219 (Protection of Human Volunteers ), US 21 CFR Part 50 
[Protection of Human Volunteers  (Informed Consent)] and Part 56 (IRBs) and Part 312 
(Investigational New Drug Application), AR [ADDRESS_581307] for 
persons, beneficence, and justice described in the Bel mont Report.  
The procedures set out in this study are designed to ensure that the sponsor’s representative and 
all study personnel abide by [CONTACT_454706]. The investigator confirms thi s by [CONTACT_454707] 1572.  
Clinical Protoc ol ADVP005  The University of Maryland, Baltimore   
IND 016332 ; CVD Dengue [ADDRESS_581308] (HIPAA ) requires that researchers obtain 
the volunteer ’s permission (HIPAA Authorization) to use and disclose h ealth information about 
the volunteer  that is either created by [CONTACT_454708]. The information 
includes the entire research record and supporting information from the volunteer ’s medical 
records, results of laboratory tests, and both clinical and research observations made during the 
individual’s participation in the research.  
In this research, the volunteer ’s health information will be collected and used to conduct the study; 
to monitor the volunteer ’s health status; to measure e ffects of the investigational product; to 
determine research results, and possibly to develop new tests, procedures, and commercial 
products. Health information is used to report results of research to the sponsor’s representative 
and Federal regulators an d may be reviewed during study audits for compliance with study plans, 
regulations, and research policies. After the study ends, each volunteer  has the right to see and 
receive a copy of his/her information.  
The sponsor’s representative, the IRB, and the  FDA are eligible to photocopy and review records 
related to this protocol as a part of their responsibility to protect the participants of this protocol. 
In addition, these representatives are eligible to witness the applicable study procedures to assure 
the safety of volunteers . 
No personal identifier will be used in any publication or communication used to support this 
research study. The volunteer ’s identification number will be used in the event it becomes 
necessary to identify data specific to a single volunteer . 
 
14.1.2.  Compensation  
Volunteers  will be compensated for time and inconvenience in accordance with the standards for 
compensation at the site. Compensation may vary depending upon the number of days that may 
be required for the daily evalua tions  in the period after a DHIM  as those who become viremic 
early will require fewer days of clinic visits than those who have delayed or no viremia .  Details 
are provided in the ICF . 
 
14.1.3.  Written Informed Consent  
The site will prepare a model ICF which will embody the ICH GCP as well as sponsor -required 
elements.  Freely given and written informed consent must be obtained from each volunteer  prior 
to participation in the study.   
The informed consent process and document wil l be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_454709]’s representative prior to initiation of the study. The consent document contains a full 
explanation of the possible risks, advantages, and any alternate vaccination/preventative options, 
and availability of  treatment in the case of injury, in accordance with 21 CFR 50. The consent 
document indicates that by [INVESTIGATOR_59844], the volunteer  permits access to relevant study records by [CONTACT_103]’s representative and by [CONTACT_284384]. The sponsor’s repres entative will 
submit a copy of the initial IRB - and sponsor’s representative -approved consent form to the FDA 
and will maintain copi[INVESTIGATOR_454646].

volunteer  should understand that  the study product is an investigational drug and is not licensed 
by [CONTACT_454710]. Informed 
consent includes the principle that it is critical the volunteer  be informed about the principal  
potential risks and benefits. This information will allow the volunteer  to make a personal risk 
versus benefit decision and understand the following:  
• Participation is entirely voluntary  
• Withdraw al from participation can occur at any time  
• Refusal to parti cipate involves no penalty  
• Questions to understand the nature of the protocol can be asked  
• A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov , 
as required by [CONTACT_20008].  
Should  the protocol be modified, the volunteer  ICF must be reviewed and revised, if applicable, 
to reflect the changes made to the protocol. If a previously enrolled volunteer  is directly affected 
by [CONTACT_134404], the volunteer  will receive a copy of the revised i nformed consent document to 
read. If the volunteer  agrees to continue participating in the study, the approved revision will be 
signed and dated by [CONTACT_454711] . 
14.1.4.  Medical Care for Research -Related Injury  
All non -exempt research involving human volunteers  shall, at a minimum, meet the requirement 
of 32 CFR 219.116(a)(6).  
If a volunteer  suffers an injury directly related to participation in this project, UMB and/or one of 
its affiliated institutions or health care groups will help obtain medical treatment for the specific 
injury and provide referrals to other health care facilities, as a ppropriate. UMB and/or its affiliated 
institutions or health care groups will not provide financial compensation or reimbursement for 
the cost of care provided to treat a research -related injury or for other expenses arising from a 
research -related injury.  The institution or group providing medical treatment will charge the 
volunteer ’s insurance carrier, the volunteer , or any other party responsible for treatment costs. If 
the volunteer  incurs uninsured medical costs, they are the responsibility of the volunteer . 
14.2. Ethics Review

If separate research records are maintained by [CONTACT_093](s), the medical record and the 
research records will be considered the source documents for the p urposes of auditing the study. 
The source documents will be retained at the site.  
Any study information shared between the [LOCATION_003]MMDA , WRAIR,  and UMB -CVD will be  coded 
and only  transferred utilizing  the technology transfer platform, SAFE, to ensure data 
confi dentiality.  Data in question includes clinical and immunologic data from ADVP003 and -
[ADDRESS_581312] of ADVP005.  
For this study, an electronic data capture ( EDC ) database system will be used for the collection of 
the study data in  an electronic format. The EDC database system will be designed based on the 
protocol requirements, the approved eCRF layouts and specifications, and in accordance with 21 
CFR Part 11. The eCRF layouts and specifications define and identify the applicable source data 
that will be collected and captured into the EDC database system. The applicable source data will 
be electronically transcribed by [CONTACT_454717] (data entry screens) in the EDC 
database system. The investigator is ultimately r esponsible for the accuracy of the data collected 
on the eCRF. Data monitoring and management will be performed in the EDC database system by 
[CONTACT_454718].  
All individuals who will be expected to use t he EDC will be given the training necessary to perform 
their assigned tasks as described in (21 CRF 11.10(i)). Training will be conducted by [CONTACT_454719] a continuing, as needed basis. The training documentation will be 
maintained  at the trial site. The sponsor will also keep a record of the training files.   
A detailed data management plan will be written and approved by [CONTACT_454720] [INVESTIGATOR_454650], with approval by [CONTACT_456]’s data manager.  All updates to the  data management 
plan must be approved before study close -out and database lock.  
15.1.  Inspection of Records  
The sponsor’s representative or designee will be allowed to conduct site visits at the study site for 
the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the s tudy. The investigator agrees to allow the monitor to 
inspect the storage area, investigational product stocks, accountability records, volunteer  charts, 
study source documents, and other records relative to study conduct.  
Volunteers ’ study chart information will be used to report results of research to the sponsor’s 
representative and Federal regulators and may be reviewed during study audits for compliance 
with study plans, regulations, and research policies. The consent document in dicates that by

representative and by [CONTACT_284384].  
15.2.   Retention of Records  
Following closure of the study, the investigator must maintain all site study records in a safe and 
secure location. The records must be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval, when needed 
(e.g., audit or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent review of data in 
conjunction with as sessment of the facility, supporting systems, and staff. Where permitted by 
[CONTACT_5751]/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of these records can be maintained 
in a validated format other than hard copy (e.g. microfiche, scanned, electronic  for studies with an 
eCRF); however, caution needs to be exercised before such action is taken. The investigator must 
assure that all reproductions are legible and are a true and accurate copy of the original and meet 
accessibility and retrieval standards,  including re -generating a hard copy, if required. Furthermore, 
the investigator must ensure there is an acceptable back -up of these reproductions and that an 
acceptable quality control process exists for making these reproductions.  
The investigator must m aintain all documentation relating to the study . The CVD will retain 
records on site for the duration of the active IRB protocol.  If it becomes necessary for the sponsor’s 
representative or designee or the FDA to review any documentation relating to the s tudy, the 
investigator must permit access to such records.  An archival at an off -site facility , Iron Mountain, 
will hold records in  perpetuity  and the records are easily retrievable .  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_454651] , i.e., name, 
address, telephone number, Social Security number, and volunteer  identifier in the study, so that 
the sponsor’s representative, the local IRB, the FDA, employees of WRAIR  or [LOCATION_003]MR DC, or 
other regulatory authorities may have access  to this information should the need arise.  
16.0.  PUBLICATION POLICY  
16.1.  IND Annual Reports and Final Clinical Study Reports  
After appropriate data cleaning and query resolution between the clinical site, sponsor’s clinical 
monitor, and clinical data manager, SAEs from the clinical database will be reconciled with the 
sponsor’s SAE database. SAEs and AEs for inclusion in annual and final reports to the FDA will 
be provided from the clinical database by [CONTACT_454722].  
 
16.1.1.  IND Annual Rep ort to the FDA  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_284307] a detailed annual synopsis of clinical activity, 
including adverse events, for submission to the sponsor’s representative.  Each annual report will 
summarize IND activity for one year. The sp onsor’s representative will notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_284320].  
 
16.1.2. Study Results and Clinical Trial Registries  
Following completion of the study, the investigator may publish the results  of this research in a 
scientific journal. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member 
journals have adopted a trials -registration policy as a condition for publication. This policy 
Clinical Protoc ol ADVP005  The University of Maryland, Baltimore   
IND 016332 ; CVD Dengue [ZIP_CODE]  Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health  
 
V04.0, 04 Jan 2021  81  requires that all clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov , 
which is sponsored by [CONTACT_1055] (NLM). Other biomedical journals are 
considering adopting similar policies. It is the responsibili ty of DMID to register this trial in an 
acceptable registry. In compliance with Public Law [ADDRESS_581313] of 2007 (FDAAA), DMID will also post the results of the trial in accordance to 
the legal requirements.  
The IC MJE defines a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human 
participants to intervention or comparison groups to study the cause -and-effect relationship 
between a medical intervention and a health outcome. Studies designed for oth er purposes, such 
as to study pharmacokinetics or major toxicity ( e.g., Phase 1 trials), would be exempt from this 
policy. As a result, this study can but is not required to be registered in the NLM registry, 
ClinicalTrials.gov.

Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others  
 
Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others encompass a broader category 
of events than serious adverse events (SAEs) and may include issues such as pr oblems with 
loss of control of subject data or the investigational product; adverse psychological 
reactions; or breach of confidentiality. Risks to others (e.g., program personnel) must also 
be reported.  
 
Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others are any incident, experience, 
or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the procedures 
that are described in the protocol, investigators brochure or informed consent 
document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population;  
• Related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the study; and  
• Suggests that the study places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than was 
previously known or recognized.  
 
Unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, should be promptly reported 
(48 hours) by [CONTACT_756], email, or fax to the WRAIR HSPB. A complete written report 
should follow the initial notification within [ADDRESS_581357] information for the WRAIR HSPB

Continuing Reviews and Closeout Report  
 
The WRAIR POC is responsible for preparing and/or submitting continuing review reports 
and a closeout report as per WRAIR Standard Operating Procedure UWZ -C-618. The 
WRAIR HSPB will review and acknowledge the reports in order for WRAIR personnel to 
continue  their participation on the study.  Once all study activities have been completed, to 
include data analysis, a closeout report will need to be submitted to the WRAIR HSPB to 
close the study.

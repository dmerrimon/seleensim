will be considered the MTD.  If a DLT occurs at the 20.0 mg/kg dose, then a dose level of 15.0 mg/kg may be explored pending safety review.  If on ly 3 subjects were treated at the MTD or PAD, then a 
minimum of 3  additional evaluable subjects will be enrolled at this dose before it  is administered in Part  2 
of the study.   
If Cohort 1 (0.03 mg/kg; starting dose) exceeds the MTD, the sponsor and inves tigators will consider 
dosing INCAGN01876 at 0.01 mg/kg (Cohort -1), and/or investigate 0.03 mg/kg at alternate dose 
schedules,  based on available safety, PK,  data.  If an alternate schedule is tested and 
determined to be safe, re- escalat ion of INCAGN01876 will proceed according to the table below. 
Throughout the treatment period, if > 33% of subjects (a minimum of  6 subjects ) experience a ≥ Grade  3 
toxicity related to study drug after completing ≥ 4 cycles, then dose administration will be stopped, and 
the MNTD will be determined in conjunction with the investigators and sponsor based on all available 
safety data.  
Additional subjects wi ll be enrolled in a cohort to achieve the minimum of 3 evaluable subjects.  Subjects 
who drop out for reasons other than a DLT (eg, events clearly associated with the underlying disease, 
disease progression, concomitant medication, or comorbidity), during the 28-day DLT observation period 
will be considered nonevaluable and will be replaced.  Dose modifications should not be made during the 
DLT observation period without discussion with the medical monitor.  Intrasubject dose escalation is not permitted; ho wever,  once the recommended Part 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule has been determined, 
ongoing subjects in Part 1 may be permitted to escalate to the RP2D with approval of the medical monitor.  The cohorts and dose levels are shown in the table below.

Part 1  – Safety Expansion  
In order to  confirm the preliminary safety of the 
dose escalation cohorts, Part [ADDRESS_574606] dose levels determined to be safe and/or doses 
determined to be pharmacologically active.  Fixed doses of INCAGN01876 (equivalent to or less than the 
MTD/PAD determined during dose escalation), may also be explored during the safety expansion.  All doses and schedules explored during the safety expansion will depend on PK,  and safety 
results.  
Approximately 36 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in the Part 1 safety expansion, with each cohort 
enrolling approximately 9 e valuable subjects .  If < 3 of 9 evaluable subjects experience a DLT, the cohort

CONFIDENTIAL  will be deemed safe.  If > 1 safety expansion cohort is deemed safe, then a recommended dose and 
schedule will be determined in conjunction with the investigators and sponsor based on all available 
safety, PK,  results.  The safety expansion cohorts may be conducted in parallel to 
Part 2 and may be limited by [CONTACT_450726] a balance across 
cohorts. 
Part 2  − Dose Exp ansion 
Part 2 of the study will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, PK, and pharmacologic activity of the RP2D of INCAGN01876 in subjects with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, melanoma, NSCLC (squamous and nonsquamous), and RCC.  Each 
cohort will comprise of an individual tumor type.  A Simon 2-stage design will be utilized with a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_450707] a particular cohort at the end of Stage 1 if there are insufficient responses observed.  During Stage 1, 9 evaluable subjects will be enrolled  in each  cohort; if no responses 
are observed within the cohort then the cohort will be discontinued.  If at least 1 response is observed, 
8 additional evaluable subjects will be enrolled in the cohort (Stage 2), for a maximum of 17 evaluable 
subjects per cohort.   
Subjects will continue to receive INCAGN01876 at the RP2D and schedule until Protocol-defined 
withdrawal criteria are met.  Continuous evaluation of toxicity events will be performe d throughout 
enrollment in Part 2 of the study.  If the cumulative incidence of DLTs occu rs in ≥ 33% of subjects after 
[ADDRESS_574607] 28 days, further enrollment may be interrupted until the sponsor 
has determined the appropriate course of action.  All AE s, regardless of the time of occurrence on study 
may be consid ered in determining the appropriate dose, schedule, and MNTD. 
Toxicity will continue to be monitored  throughout the treatment period.  If > 33% of subjects (minimum 
of 6 subjects ) experience a ≥ Grade 3 toxicity related to study drug after completing ≥ 4 c ycles,  then the 
MNTD will be determined in conjunction with the investigators and sponsor based on all available safety 
data.

Part 2 of the study will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, PK, and 
pharmacologic activity of the RP2D of INCAGN01876 in subjects with advanced or metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, melanoma, NSCLC (squamous and nonsquamous), and 
RCC.  Each cohort will comprise an individual tumor type.  A Simon 2- stage design will be 
utilized with a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_450714] a particular cohort at the end of Stage 1 
if there are insufficient responses observed.  During Stage 1, 9 evaluable subjects will be 
enrolled  in each cohort; if no responses are observed within the cohort, then the cohort will be 
discontinued.  If at least 1 response is observed, then 8 additional evaluable subjects will be 
enrolled in the cohort (Stage 2), for a maximum of 17 evaluable subjects per cohort.   
Subjects will continue to receive INCAGN01876 at the RP2D and schedule until Protocol-defined withdrawal criteria are met.  Continuous evaluation of toxicity events will be 
performed throughout enrollment in Part 2 of the study.  If the cumulative incidence of DLTs 
occurs in ≥ 33% of subjects after [ADDRESS_574640] 28 days, further enrollment may be interrupted until the sponsor has determined the appropriate course of action.  
All AEs, regardless of the time of occurrence on study , may be considered in determining the 
appropriate dose, schedule, and MNTD. 
Toxicity will continue to be monitored throughout the treatment period.  If > 33% of subjects

5.1.2. Randomization and Blinding  
This is an open-label nonrandomized study; therefore , randomization and blinding do not apply. 
5.2. Study Drug  
5.2.1. Description and Administration 
The study drug (INCAGN01876) is in liquid form in the formulation buffer of 10 mM histidine, 
7% sucrose, pH 6.0 at a strength of 10 mg/mL to be used for IV infusion.  The infusion site should not be used for blood sampling.   
Study drug will be diluted in 0.9 % normal saline  and administered by [CONTACT_450735] a 30-minute period on Day 1 of each cycle.  In Part  1, subjects will be 
administered study drug, according to cohor t enrollment ( Table 2).   In Part  2, subjects will be 
administered study drug  at the RP2D and schedule.  Subjects will continue to receive 
INCAGN01876, up to the defined maximum number of cycles, as long as the subje ct is deriving 
benefit and has not met any of the Protocol- defined conditions for treatment withdrawal (see 
Section  5.5).  
Duration of treatment (maximum number of cycles) will be determined based on safety during 
Part 1 and may be fewer than the absolute maximum number of cycles as outlined below: 
• For a 14- day cycle:  maximum of 26 cycles  
• For a 21- day cycle:  maximum of 17 cycles

5.4. Treatment In terruptions and Adjustments  
5.4.1. Dose Modifications 
Selections and modifications to the study drug are planned for dose-escalation cohorts.  D ose 
interruptions and modifications also may occur for individual study subjects.  The identification 
of DLTs will define the doses used in planned cohorts (see Section  5.4.2).  Further, the 
occurrence of DLTs and other toxicities (related or unrelated to study drug) will guide decisions 
for treatment interruptions and discontinuation for individual subjects.  Intrasubject dose 
escalation is not permitted; however, once the RP2D has been determined, ongoing subjects in Part [ADDRESS_574643] dose reductions may be made based on events observed at any time during 
treatment with study drug; however, for the purposes of dose cohort escalation/de- escalation, 
expanding a dose cohort, and determining the MTD/PAD of study drug, decisions will be made 
based on events that are observed from the first day of study drug administration through and 
including study Day 28.  A lower MTD may subsequently be determined based on relevant toxicities that become evident after study Day 28. 
Table 3: Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
Nonhematologic  toxicity  
• Any ≥ Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity EXCEPT the following:  
- Transient (≤ 72 hours) abnormal laboratory values without associated clinically significant signs or symptoms.  
- Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea adequately controlled with supportive care within 48  hours.

- An event clearly associated with the underlying disease, disease progression, a concomitant medication, or 
comorbidity.  
- Asymptomatic changes in lipid profiles.  
- Asymptomatic changes in amylase and lipase. 
- Single or nonfasting elevations in blood glucose (ie, blood glucose excursions will be considered toxicities if 
fasting blood glucose is elevated on 2 separate occasions).  
Hematologic  toxicity  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding (ie, requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], transfusion of blood 
products, or other urgent medical intervention).

5.4.3. Management of Dose- Limiting Toxicities or Other Urgent Situations  
In all cases , investigators may  employ any measures or concomitant medications, after  
discussion with the sponsor (whenever possible), necessary to optimally treat the subject.  
5.4.4. Follow- Up of Dose -Limiting Toxicities  
Any DLT should be followed until it resolves to baseline or appears to have stabilized for a 
minimum of 4 weeks  (eg, 28 days).  During follow -up, subjects should be seen as often as 
medically indicated to assure safety.  
5.4.5. Procedures for Cohort Review and Dose Escalation  
Telephone conferences will be scheduled by [CONTACT_450738] -specific data and overall safety data, to agree on dose escalation, adjudicate 
individual high- grade AEs as potentially dose -limiting, and guide other major study decisions. 
5.4.6. Criteria and Procedures for Dose Interrupti ons and Adjustments  of Study Drug  
Treatment with study drug may be delayed to allow for resolution of toxicity.  Subjects may 
resume treatment if no medical condition or other circumstance exists that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would make the subject unsuitable for further participation in the study.  For 
toxicities that occur outside of the 28-day DLT period, the treating investigator should contact [CONTACT_450739] t han 4 weeks (28 days) before restarting treatment with study drug. 
Instructions for dose modifications and interruptions are outlined in Table 4.  Individual 
decisions regarding dose interruptions and reduction s should be made using appropriate clinical 
judgment in consultation with the medical monitor, taking into account relatedness of the AE to 
the study drug and the subject's underlying condition.  Adverse events that have a clear 
alternative explanation , or tran sient (≤ 72 hours) abnormal laboratory values without associated 
clinically significant signs or symptoms may be exempt from dose -reduction rules.  Dose 
interruptions are permitted in the case of medical /surgical events or logistical reasons not related 
to study therapy (eg, elective surgery, unrelated medical events, subject vacation, and/or 
Incyte Europe Sàrl   Page 47 of 99

reductions of study drug.  
5.4.7. Definition, Procedures, and Supportive Care Guidelines for Immu ne-Related 
Adverse Events  
INCAGN01876 is an immune modulator, and although no toxicities were identified in 
preclinical models, it is possible that ir AEs (both nonserious and serious) similar to those 
described with approved immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_144087].  Adv erse events of a potential 
immunologic etiology or irAEs may be defined as an AE consistent with an immune phenomenon associated with drug exposure after all other etiologies have been eliminated .  
Immune- related AEs may be expected based on the nature of INCAGN01876 , its mechanism of 
action, and based on reported experience with other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Special attention should 
be paid to AEs that may be suggestive of potential irAEs.  An irAE can occur shortly after the first dose or several months after t he last dose of treatment.   Suspected irAEs should be 
discussed with the medical monitor when possible. 
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_78017].  Suggested supportive care measures for t he management of drug -related 
AEs with potential immunologic etiology are outlined in Table 5.  Detailed supportive care 
guidelines for specific irAEs can be in found in Ap pendix B .  For each AE, attempts should be 
made to  rule out other causes, including but not limited to metastatic disease or bacterial or viral 
infection, which might require specific supportive care.

• Grade 4 or life -threatening AEs (see Table 4 and Table 6).  
• ≥ Grade 2 ocular irAE. 
• Occurrence of an AE that is related to treatment with the study drug that, in the 
judgment of the investigator or the sponsor's medical monitor, compromises the 
subject 's ability to continue study -specific procedures , or is considered to not be in 
the subject 's best interest.  
• An AE requiring more than 2 dose reductions of study drug , or more than 1 dose 
reduction of study drug if the starting dose is 0.03 mg/kg (see Table 2 ). 
• Persistent AE requiring a delay of study drug beyond 4 weeks (28 days), unless the 
delay has been approved by [CONTACT_456]. 
5.4.10. Treatment After Initial Evidence of Radiologic Disease Progression  
Immunotherapeutic agents may produce antitumor effects by [CONTACT_134981] -specific immune responses.  The response patterns seen with such an approach may 
extend beyond the typi[INVESTIGATOR_450717] a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions.

treatment while awaiting radiographic confirmation of progression as outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
5.5. Withdrawal of Subjects  From Study Drug 
5.5.1. Withdrawal Criteria  
A subject may choose to withdraw from the study at any time or be withdrawn from the study by 
[CONTACT_4687], if the subject is noncompliant with the study requirements.  Subjects 
may also be withdrawn at the discretion of the FDA or health authorities.   If a subject is 
withdrawn, then every reasonable effort should be made to determine the reason for withdrawal , 
and this information should be recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
Subjects must  be withdrawn from study drug  for the following reasons: 
• The subj ect becomes pregnant.  
• Consent is withdrawn.  Subjects may choose to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty of jeopardizing their health care or loss of benefits to which the 
subject is otherwise entitled.  
• Further participation would be injurious to the subject' s health or well -being, in the 
investigator 's medical judgment.  
• The subject is lost to follow -up. 
Incyte Europe Sàrl   Page 51 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  • Unacceptable toxicity (see Section  5.4).  Subjects with unacceptable toxicities must 
be withdrawn from study drug but will continue to be followed during the safety 
follow-up visits as specified in Section  6.4. 
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_456]. 
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_19407], IR B, or IEC. 
A subject  may be discontinued from study drug  as follows:  
• Confirmed radiographic progression of disease per mRECIST v1.1.  See 
Section  7.7.1. 
Note :  For unconfirmed progression, see Section 7.7.1. 
Note :  A subject may be granted an exception to continue on treatment with 
confirmed radiographic progression if clinically stable or clinically improved.  See Section 7.7.1. 
• If, during the course of the study, a subject is found not to have met eligibility criteria (see Section  3), then the medical monitor, in collaboration with the investigator, will 
determine whether the subject  should be withdrawn from the study. 
• If a subject is noncompliant with study procedures or study drug administration in the investigator 's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], then  the sponsor should be consulted for instruction on 
handling the subject. 
5.5.2. Withdrawal Procedures  
In the e vent that the decision is made to permanently discontinue the study drug , the subject will 
be withdrawn from the study, and the end -of-treatment  (EOT) visit should be conducted.  
Reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject  return for follow-up visits.  These visits 
are described in Section  6.  The last date of the last dose of study drug and the reason for subject 
withdrawal will be recorded  in the eCRF . 
If a subject is withdrawn from the study:  
• The study monitor or sponsor must be notified. 
• The reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented in the subject' s medical record and 
in the eCRF . 
• The EOT  visit should be performed. 
• The date of the EOT visit should be recorded in the IW RS. 
• Subjects must be followed f or safety until the time of the follow -up visit or until 
study drug–related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, 
whichever is longe st. 
If the subject discontinues study drug and actively withdraws consent for collection of follow -up 
data (safety follow -up or disease assessment), then no additional data collection should occur; 
however, subjects will have the option of withdrawing consent for study drug but continuing in 
the follow-up period of the study for safety/efficacy assessments . 
Incyte Europe Sàrl   Page [ADDRESS_574648] dose of study drug should be recorded for SAEs as defined in Section  8.  
Concomitant treatments/procedures that are required to manage a subject 's medical condition 
during the study will also be recorded in the eCRF . 
5.6.1. Permitted Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject 's welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_12983].  All concomitant medication s will be recorded on the eCRF , including all 
prescription, over-the-counter, herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids.  If changes 
occur during the study period, documentation of drug regimen, frequency, route, and date may 
also be included on the eCRF .  Note:   The use of bisphosphonates and denosumab are permitted 
in this study.  
5.6.2. Restricted  Medications  
Use of s ystemic glucocorticoids is restricted to  prophylaxis  for contrast allergi es for radiographic 
procedures, or to modulate symptoms or treat an AE of suspected immunologic etiology.  The 
use of physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy may be approved after consultation with 
the sponsor. 
Note:   Inhaled and topi[INVESTIGATOR_14271].  A short course of steroids (prednisone or 
equivalent) ≤ 10 mg/day may be permitted with sponsor approval. 
• Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs; eg, ibuprofen) 
may be used.  Due to the risk of liver injury with the use of high doses of 
acetaminophen, subjects should be advised to stay within the recommended daily 
dose of acetaminophen. 
5.6.3. Prohibited Medications  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria (s ee Section 3.2) are 
not allowed during the ongoing study.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the study, discontinuation from study drug or vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding 
this with the sponsor.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the 
investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the subject on study drug or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the investigator, 
the sponsor, and the subject. 
Incyte Europe Sàrl   Page 53 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_450718]: 
• Any anticancer medications, including chemotherapy or biologic therapy other than the study drug . 
• Any immunological-based treatment for any reason from screening through follow-up 
visit.  
Note:   Completed adjuvant therapy (eg, vaccines) with medical monitor approval, 
inhaled or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826], systemic steroids at doses ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalents, and immune suppressants are allowed for treatment of immune toxicities 
as described in Section  5.4.7 and Appendix B . 
Note:   Allergy shots may be permitted after consultation with the medical monitor.  
• Investigational agents other than the study drug from screening through the follow-up 
visits. 
• Concomit ant radiation therapy.  
Note:   Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be 
considered on an exceptional case -by-case basis after consultation with the medical 
monitor .  The subject must have clear measurable disease outside the radiated field.  
Administration of palliative radiation therapy will be considered clinical progression for the purposes of determining PFS. 
• Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_574649] dose of study drug and while 
participating in the study.  Examples o f live vaccines include, but are not limited to, 
the following:  measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette –Guérin , and typhoid (oral) vaccine.  Seasonal influenza vaccines for 
injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed.  However, intranasal 
influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist
®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.  
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the study.  Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  The exclusion criteria 
describe other medications that are prohibited in this study.  There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_450719]- treatment follow -up period.

6.1. Screening  
Screening is the interval between signing the ICF and the day the subject is enrolled  in the study 
(eg, Cycle  1 Day 1).  S creening may not exceed [ADDRESS_574658] of care; 
however, p rocedures  conducted as part of the subject' s routine clinical management obtained 
before  signing of informed consent may be used for screening or baseline purposes with approval 
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page [ADDRESS_574659]  who fails  screening may repeat 
the screening process 1 time  if the investigator believes  there has  been a change in eligibility  
status (eg , after  recovery from an infection).  Treatment should start as soon as possible after the 
date of enrollment. 
6.2. Treatment  
The treatment period begins on the day the subject receives the first dose of study drug (Cycle 1 
Day 1) through the point at which the investigator determines that the subject will be 
permanently discontinued from study drug.  Cycle [ADDRESS_574660] regularly scheduled study visits on Day 1 of every c ycle ± [ADDRESS_574661] es obtained (see Table 9) .  Toxicities will be monitored 
continuously and will be graded using the NCI CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_574662] 4 cycles (Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, and Cycle 4 
Day 1), subjects will be required to stay at the study site for safety observation for up to 
[ADDRESS_574663] 
should be encouraged to return for the follow-up v isit(s). 
6.4. Follow -Up 
6.4.1. Safety Follow- Up 
The safety follow -up period is the interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled follow-up 
visit, which should occur 30 days (+ 7 days) and 60 days (+ 7 days) after the EOT visit (or after the last dose of study drug if the EOT visit was not performed).  Adverse events and SAEs must 
be reported up until a t least [ADDRESS_574664] is scheduled to begin a new anticancer therapy before the en d of the 30- day 
or the 60- day safety follow -up period, then the safety follow -up visit should be performed before 
new anticancer therapy is started.  
6.4.2. Disease Status  Follow- Up 
Subjects who discontinue study drug for a reason other than  disease progression wi ll move into 
the disease status follow -up period and should continue to be assessed every 8 weeks  (± 7 days ) 
for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter,  by [CONTACT_450743].  Every effort should be made to collect information regarding disease 
status until the earliest of the following : 
• The start of new anti cancer  therapy.  
• Disease progression . 
• Death . 
• The end of the study.  
6.5. End of Study  
The end of the study will occur when all subjects have completed the last study follow -up visit or 
have discontinued study drug and have completed applicable follow-up assessments.  
Additionally, s ubjects will be considered as having completed the study if they meet any of the 
following criteria:  
• Subject dies and a date of death is available.  
• Subject is known to have died; however, the date of death cannot be obtained.  (NOTE:  Every effort must be made to obtain the date of death.) 
• Consent is withdrawn for any further contact [CONTACT_165913]. 
− Every reasonable effort s hould be made to determine the reason a subject 
withdraws prematurely, and this information should be recorded in the eCRF . 
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_456]. 
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_450744]. 
6.6. Unscheduled Visits 
Unsc heduled study visits may occur at any time if medically warranted.  Any assessments 
performed at those visits should be recorded in the eCRF . 
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page [ADDRESS_574665] OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
Individual study procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to perform these 
procedures at unscheduled timepoints if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_093].  
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary for reasons related to 
subject safety.  In some cases, such evaluation/ testing may be potentially sensitive in nature 
(eg, HIV, HCV), and thus local regulations may require that additional informed consent be 
obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.  Subjects of childbearing potential must agree to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy in order to participate in the study ( Appendix A ). 
7.1. Administration of Informed Consent Form  
Valid informed consent must be obtained from the subject before  conducting any study- specific 
procedures using an ICF approved by [CONTACT_1036]/IEC.  The ICF should contain all elements 
required by [CONTACT_12212] E6 and describe  the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study in a 
manner  that the subject can understand.  Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and 
administration must be followed; the original signed ICF must be retained by [CONTACT_093], 
and a copy of the signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.  The informed consent process for each subject must be documented in writing within the subject source documentation. 
7.2. Interactive Web Response System  Procedure  
The investigator or designee will assign a subject number when a subject enters the scr eening 
phase.  Upon determining that the subject is eligible for the study (see Section  3.1 and 
Section  3.2), the subject will be entered into the IWRS.  The I WRS  will be contact[CONTACT_450745] 's status and for study drug supply.  Refer to the I WRS  manual for detailed 
instructions. 
7.3. Demography and Medical History 
7.3.1. Demographics and General Medical History  
Demographic data and a complete medical and medication history will be collected at screening by [CONTACT_165922], race, ethnicity, medical 
and surgical history, and current illnesses.  Medical history will include relevant medical or 
surgical treatment  within th e last [ADDRESS_574666]' s malignanc y under study including date of diagnosis, initial and current 
cancer stage, primary tumor histology, and prior treatments including systemic, radiation, and 
surgica l procedures will be recorded. 
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page [ADDRESS_574667] will be maintained  after  signing the ICF to document concomitant 
medications , including any changes to the dose or regimen.  Concomitant medications include 
any prescription, over- the-counter, or natural/herbal preparations taken or administered during 
the study period.  Concomitant treatments  and/or procedures  that are required to manage a 
subject 's medical condition during the study will also be recorded in the eCRF .  See Section  5.[ADDRESS_574668]  signs the ICF .  Subjects will be 
instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occurrence of AEs 
throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects will be asked general, nonleading questions such as "How are you feeling? "  All AEs (serious and nonserious) must be 
recorded on the source documents and eCRF s regardless of the assumption of a causal 
relationship with the study drug .  The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs 
are described in  Section  8. 
7.6.2. Physical Examinations 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Comprehensive Physical  Examination 
Physical examinations must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed 
physician, physician 's assistant, or an advanced registered nurse practitioner, as local law 
permits.  
The comprehensive physical examination will include assessment(s) of the following organ or body systems:  skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system; abdomen (liver, spleen); extremities; and lymph nodes, as well as a brief neurological 
examination.  The screening physical examination should also include a measurement of height.  
Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AEs. 
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page 63 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS]. Targeted Physical  Examination 
The targeted physical examination will be a symptom -directed evaluation conducted by [CONTACT_92685] a medically qualified designee.  The targeted physical examination will include 
assessment(s) of the body systems or organs, as indicated by [CONTACT_106216], AEs, or other 
findings.  Clinically notable abnormalities that a re considered clinically significant in the 
judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AEs. 
7.6.3. Vital Signs  and Weight 
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature.  
Blood pressure and pulse will be take n with the subject in the recumbent, semirecumbent, or 
sitting position after [ADDRESS_574669] 4 cycles (C1D1, C2D1, C3D1, and 
C4D1), subjects will be required to stay at the study site for safety observation for up to [ADDRESS_574670] the site for any reason during the safety observation period.  During the safety observation period, vital signs (blood pressure, 
pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature) will be assessed every 60 minutes ± 10 minutes 
(eg, 1 hour postinfusion, 2 hours postinfusion, 3 hours postinfusion, etc). 
Weight will also be assessed at each study visit.  Clinically notable abnormalities that are 
considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AEs.  
7.6.4. Electrocardiograms  
All [ADDRESS_574671] and should not be performed within 15 minutes of a blood collection.  All 
12-lead ECGs will be acquired using an ECG analysis system with analysis and printing 
capabilities, as well as digital transmission capabilities to a central capture module at the central 
ECG laboratory. 
Timed triplicate ECGs (separated by 5 minutes) will be cond ucted at screening and in 
conjunction with the pre- and postinfusion PK timepoints on C1D1 and C6D1 ( see Table 11).   
The specified postdose timepoint may be adjusted based on emerging PK data. A 12-lead ECG should be performed on Day 1 of every other cycle after Cycle 2  (eg, Cycle 4, 
Cycle 6, Cycle 8, Cycle 10, etc).  Subsequent ECGs only need to be performed in triplicate if 
there has been a QT prolongation on study or the ECG shows a clinically significant abnormal ity 
not present at baseline.  
The automated 12-lead ECGs readings will be interpreted by [CONTACT_093], or qualified 
designee at the site to be used for immediate subject management.  The decision to include or 
exclude a subject or withdraw a subject fro m the study based on a centrally analyzed  ECG 
flagged as "Abnormal, Clinically Significant" is the responsibility of the investigator, in 
consultation with the medical monitor, as appropriate.  Clinically significant abnormal findings before signing consent should be recorded as medical history.  Clinically significant abnormal 
findings after signing consent should be recorded as an AE.  In the event that a single QTc is > [ADDRESS_574672] may enroll if the average QTc for the 3 EC Gs is 
< 470 milliseconds or with approval from the medical monitor.  For subjects with an intraventricular conduction delay (QRS interval > 120 milliseconds ) at screening, the JTc

clinically stable as defined by [CONTACT_4868]: 
• Absence of clinically significant signs and symptoms (including worsening of 
laboratory values) indicating disease progression. 
• No decline in ECOG performance status. 
• Absence of rapid progression of disease. 
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.

The first imaging assessment should be performed [ADDRESS_574679] dose of study drug and 
then every 8  weeks (56 days ± 7 days)  for [ADDRESS_574680] met the conditions detailed in Section  7.7.1.  A central imag ing vendor will not be used in 
this study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Imaging During Follow- Up 
If the subject discontinues study drug  for reasons other than disease progression, imaging 
assessments should continue at the Protocol-specified interval until documented disease 
progression, the start of new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, death, or the end of the 
study, whichever occurs first.   
7.8. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
7.8.1. Blood Sample Collection  
Pharmacokinetic  samples  will be obtained at the visits indicated in  Table 9.  Timing of 
PK  assessments are outlined in Table [ADDRESS_574681] of the date/time of the next visit.  
8. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
8.1. Adverse  Events 
8.1.1. Definitions  
For the purposes of this Protocol, an AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, that occurs 
after a subject  provides informed consent.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results occurring 
after informed consent constitute AEs  only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are 
considered clinically meaningful, require therapy (eg, hematologic  abnormality that requires 
transfusion), or require changes in the study drug(s) . 
8.1.2. Reporting  
Adverse events  that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse 
Events form  of the eCRF .  Conditions that were already present at the time of infor med consent 
should be recorded on the Medical History form in  the eCRF .  Monitoring for the occurrence of 
new AEs should be continued for at least [ADDRESS_574682] dose of study drug.  Adverse 
events ( including lab oratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described usin g a 
diagnosis whenever possible rather than  by [CONTACT_147108].   
The term "disease progression " should be recorded as an AE/SAE only if there are no other 
identifiable AEs /SAEs  associated with the disease progression at the time of reporting.  For 
events associated with disease progression , the relevant signs and symptoms should be reported 
using a diagnosis whenever possible rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms.  When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE.  If the events resulting from disease progression meet the criteria for an SAE (eg, 
resulted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a life -threatening event, or death ), the specific event(s) should be 
reported as an SAE(s) as described in Section 8.3.2.  In both cases (ie, AEs or SAEs related to 
disease progression), it should be indicated that each event  (reported as a diagnosis or as signs 
and symptoms) is  related to disease progression  on the Adverse Events form of the eCRF . 
The severity of AEs will be assessed using CTCAE v 4.03 Grades 1 through 4.  T he CTCAE 
v4.03 severity of Grade 5 will not be used; AEs resulting in death  will be graded accordingly 
using Grades [ADDRESS_574683] the out come noted as fatal.    
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page 73 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  If an event is not classified by [CONTACT_3989], the severity  of the AE will be graded according to the 
scale below to estimate the grade of severity:  
Grade  1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; inte rvention 
not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
activities of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe or medical ly significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_450721]; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living . 
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_450747] t he 
screening process after signing the ICF and at each visit during the study.  A dverse events may 
also be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_165936], or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments.  To the 
extent  possible, each AE  should be evaluated to determine: 
• The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to  4). 
• Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study 
treatment :  suspected (yes) or not suspe cted (no) . 
• The s tart and end dates, unless unresolved at final follow-up. 
• The action taken with re gard to study drug . 
• The event o utcome ( eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, 
recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown). 
• The s erious ness, as per SAE definition provided in Section  8.3.1. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements  (see Section  8.3.2). 
All AEs should be treated appropriately.  If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or 
nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on A dverse Event form and the treatment should 
be specified on  the Prior/ Concomit ant Medications  or Proce dures and Non- Drug  Therapy  form 
in the eCRF . 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it ha s resolved  or until it is judged to be 
permanent;  assessment should be made at  each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any  
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat the event , and the outcome. 
When the severity  of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between visits ), each 
change in severity  will be re ported as a separate AE until the event resolves.  For example, 
[ADDRESS_574684] Abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes 
in study drug ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event form in  the eCRF .  Whenever possible, a 
diagnosis rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, " anemia" instead of "low hemoglobin" ).  
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs should be followed until they have 
returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  When an abnormal 
laboratory te st result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE, it is not 
necessary to separately record the laboratory  test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities  that do not meet the definition of an AE  should not be reported as AEs .  
A Grade 3 or 4 (severe) AE does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it meets the definition 
of serious, as defined in Section 8.3.1.  A dose modification  for the lab oratory  abnormality may 
be required (se e Section  5.4) and should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test  
abnormality as an SAE . 
8.3. Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1. Definitions  
An SAE is defined as an event that meets at least 1 of the following criteria: 
• Is fatal or life -threatening . 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a result of: 
− A routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with 
any deterioration in condition.   
− An elective surgery or preplanned treatment for a pre- existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the ICF. 
− A treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. 
− Any social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594], in the absence of any deterioration in the subject 's general condition. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability , incapacity , or a substantial d isruption of 
a person 's ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
• Is considered to be an important medical event  or a medically significant event that 
may not result in death, be immediately life -threatenin g, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147065], based on appropriate medical judgment, the event 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
1 of the outcomes listed above. 
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page 75 of 99 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  8.3.2. Reporting  
Every SAE, re gardless of suspected causality (eg, relationship to study drug(s) or study 
procedure or disease progression), occurring after the subject has signed the ICF through the last 
study visit (or [ADDRESS_574685] dose of study drug,  whichever is later) mu st be reported to 
the sponsor (or designee) within [ADDRESS_574686] a reasonable possibility that the SAE is related to the study treatment:  suspected 
(yes) or not suspected (no).  Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Serious Adverse Event R eport Form.  
The contact [CONTACT_89208]' s study- specific representatives  is listed in the 
investigator manual  provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the 
confirmation sheet must be kept at the study site.  
Investigational site personnel must report any new information regarding the SAE within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the information in the same manner that  the initial SAE Report 
Form was sent.  Follow-up information is recorded on an amended or new SAE Report Form, with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original 
report.  The  follow-up report should include information that was not provided on the previous 
SAE Report Form, such as the outcome of the event (eg , reso lved or ongoing), treatment 
provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg , dose reduced, interrupted, or 
discontinued), or subject disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation ).  Each 
recurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow-up to that event, regardless of when it occurs. 
If the SAE is not documented in the IB for the study drug  (new occurrence) and is thought to be 
related to the sponsor' s study drug, the sponsor or its designee may urgently requir e further 
information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities .  The sponsor or its designee 
may need to issue an  Investigator Notification (IN)  to inform all investigators involved in any 
study with the same dru g that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and 
relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC , or as per national 
regulatory requirements in participating countries. 
8.4. Emergency Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
Not applicable.  
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page [ADDRESS_574687] safety:  
• The s tudy drug must be discontinued immediately  (female subjects only ). 
• The i nvestigator must complete and submit the Incyte Clinical Trial Pregnancy form 
to the sponsor or its designee within 24 hours  of learning of the pregnancy. 
• A serum pregnancy test must be performed to confirm the urine pregnancy test result.   
If a negative serum test does not confirm the urine pregnancy test result, then: 
− The investigator will use his or her expert judgment, based on an assessment of 
the potential benefit/risk to the subject, to determine whether it is in the subject' s 
best interest to resume study drug and continue participation in the study. 
• The EOT visit evaluatio ns must be performed. 
Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety evaluation.  Follow-up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by [CONTACT_147109]- baby [CONTACT_765].  Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial  Preg nancy f orm 
and reported by [CONTACT_89211].  Pregnancy follow-up information 
should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible causal relationship to the sponsor' s study drug to  any pregnancy outcome , as well as  follow-up to the 
first well-baby [CONTACT_89212] , whichever is later .  Refer to the 
Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Clinical Trial  Pregnancy Form.  
Any SAE occurring  during pregnancy must be re corded  on the SAE  report form and 
submitted to the sponsor or designee.  
8.6. Warnings and Precautions  
Special warnings or precautions for the study drug, derived from safety information collected by [CONTACT_3552] , are presented in the Investigator 's Brochure.   Additional safety 
information collected between IB updates will be communicated in the form of Investigator 
Notifications  (INs) .  Any important new safety information should be discussed with the subject 
during the study, as necessary .  If new significant ris ks are identified, they will be added to the 
ICF. 
8.7. Data Monitoring Committee  
There will be no formal Data Monitoring Committee for this open -label study.  For Part 1, the 
sponsor will conduct telephone conferences with investigators in order to review cohort- specific 
data, to review overall safety data from prior cohorts (if applicable), and to agree on dose

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -101 Amendment 3 16 MAY 2017  
CONFIDENTIAL  • Obtaining approval from the IRB/IEC before the start  of the study and for any 
changes to the clinical study Protocol, important Protocol deviations, routine updates, 
and safety information in accordance with institutional requirements and local law. 
− The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the safety reports provided by [CONTACT_169110] /IEC . 
• Adhering to the Protocol as described in this document and agree ing that changes to 
the Protocol procedures , with the exception of medical emergencies, must be 
discussed and approved, first, by [CONTACT_89223], second , by [CONTACT_5040]/IEC.  Each investigator is responsible for enrolling subjects who have met the 
specified eligibilit y criteria . 
• Retain ing records in accordance with all local, national, and regulatory laws, but for a 
minimum period of at least [ADDRESS_574688] article for 
investigation to ensure the availability of study documentation should it become 
necessary for the sponsor or a regulatory authority to review. 
− The investigator must not destroy any records associated with the study without 
receiving approval from the sponsor.  The investigator must notify the sponsor or 
its designee in the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study records.  If the investigato r leaves the institution where the study was conducted, the sponsor 
or its designee must be contact[CONTACT_89224]. 
− All eCRF  data entered by [CONTACT_779] (including audit trail), as well as computer 
hardware and software (for accessing the data), will be maintained or made 
available at the site in compliance with applicable record retention regulations.  The sponsor will retain the original eCRF  data and audit trail.  
10.2. Accountability, Handling, and Disposal of Study Drug 
The inves tigator is responsible for drug accountability at the study site; however, some of the 
drug accountability duties may be assigned to an appropriate pharmacist or other designee.  
Inventory and accountability records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_147117]. 
The investigator or designee must maintain records that document: 
• Delivery of study drug to the study site.  
• Inventory of study drug at the site.  
• Subject use of the study drug including pi[INVESTIGATOR_147067]. 
• Return of study drug to the investigator or designee by [CONTACT_1766]. 
The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the Protocol.  The investigator 
will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects were provided the specified 
Incyte Europe Sàrl  Page [ADDRESS_574689] and retain all used, unused, and partially used containers of study drug until verified by  [CONTACT_168307] r (unless otherwise agreed to by [CONTACT_456]).  At the 
conclusion of the study, the investigator or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining study drug back to the sponsor or its designee for destruction according to institutional standard operating  procedures.  If local procedures mandate on-site destruction of investigational supply, 
the site should (where local procedures allow) maintain the investigational supply until the study 
monitor inspects the accountability records in order to evaluate com pliance and accuracy of 
accountability by [CONTACT_3878].   At sites where the study drug is destroyed before 
monitor inspection, the monitors rely on documentation of destruction per the site SOP. 
10.3. Data Management  
Data management will be performed in a validated database via an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.  All data entry, verification, and validation will be performed in accordance with 
the current standard operating procedures of the Data Management Department  at the sponsor or 
its designe e.  The database will be authorized for lock once all defined procedures are completed. 
The investigator will be provided with access to an EDC system so that an eCRF  can be 
completed for each subject.  Entries made in the eCRF  must be verifiable against s ource 
documents; if updates to the database are not possible, any discrepancies should be explained 
and documented.  The investigator will be responsible for reviewing all data and eCRF  entries , 
and will sign and date the designated forms in each subject's eCRF , verifying that the 
information is true and correct.  The investigator is responsible for the review and approval of all query responses. 
Protocol deviations will be identified and recorded in the Protocol Deviation form  of the eCRF .  
The study monitor will reference the Monitoring Plan in order to ensure that each issue identified 
is appropriately documented, reported, and resolved in a timely manner in accordance with the 
plan's requirements.  
10.4. Data Privacy and Confidentiality of Study Records  
The investigator and the sponsor or its designee must adhere to applicable data privacy laws and 
regulations.  The investigator and the sponsor or their designees are responsible for ensuring that sensitive information is handled in accordance with local requirements (eg, HIPAA).  
Appropriate consent and authorizations for use and disclosure and/or transfer (if applicable) of 
protected information must be obtained. 
Subject names will not be supplied to the sponsor or its designee, if applicable.  Only the subject 
number and subject' s initials (subject 's initials will only be recorded if allowable by [CONTACT_13125]) will be recorded in the eCRF , where permitted; if the subject 's name [CONTACT_169117] (eg, laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to the sponsor or its designee.  Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in 
accordance with local data protection laws.  The subjects will be informed that representatives of the sponsor or its designee, IRB or IEC, or regulatory authorities may inspect their medical

CONFIDENTIAL  irAE  Supportive Care  
Endocrinopathies Note:  Subjects should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of 
hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency (including adrenal crisis), and hyper- or 
hypothyroidism.  Subjects may present with fatigue, headache,  mental status 
changes, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, and hypotension, or report 
nonspecific symptoms which may resemble other causes such as brain metastasis 
or underlying disease.  Unless an alternate etiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of endocrinopathies should be considered immune-mediated. 
For Grade 2 (mild to moderate new symptoms):  
• In hypophysitis, treat with systemic corticosteroids, per institutional standard 
of care .  When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper sh ould be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
Note: These suggested supportive care measures also apply to Grade 3 
hypophysitis   
• In hyperthyroidism, nonselectiv e beta- blockers (eg, propranolol) are suggested 
as initial therapy.  
• In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine or liothyronine, is indicated per standard of care. 
Note:  Isolated hypothyroidism may be treated with replacement therapy 
without treatment interruption and without corticosteroids. 
• Evaluate endocrine function and, as clinically indicated, consider pi[INVESTIGATOR_450725].  
• For subjects with abnormal endocrine work-up, except for those with isolated hypothyroidism, consider short-term, high- dose corticosteroids (eg, 
methylprednisolone or IV equivalent) and initiate appropriate hormone 
replacement therapy.  
• For subjects with normal endocrine work- up (labs or MRI), repeat labs/MRI as 
clinically indicated.  
For Grade 3 or 4 (severe or new symptoms, new/worsening hypoxia, life 
threatening):  
• Hypothyroidism may be treated with replacement therapy without treatment 
interruption and without corticosteroids. 
• In hyperthyroidism, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_78019].  Consider initiation of systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 
1-2 mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent, and initiate appropriate hormone replacement therapy.  Once improving, gradually taper 
immunosuppressive steroids over ≥ 4 week s. 
• In hypophysitis, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_79918].  When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper 
should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
• For adrenal crisis, severe dehydration, hypotension, or shock:  immediately 
initiate intravenous corticosteroids with mineralocorticoid activity.  
• Consult endocrinologist. 
• Consult medical monitor.

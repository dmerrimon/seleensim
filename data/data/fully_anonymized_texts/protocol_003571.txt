study conduct and oversight may require 
implementation of temporary or alternative 
mechanisms eg, phone contact, virtual visits, 
online meetings, use of local clinic or 
laboratory locations, and home visits by [CONTACT_245625]. Implementation of such mechanisms 
may differ country by [CONTACT_1606], depending on 
country regulations and local business 
continuity plans. Additionally, no waivers to 
deviate from protocol enrollment criteria due to 
COVID -19 (or any other pandemic) w ill be

Participants will be required to apply moisturizers (emollients) once or  twice daily for at least 
5 out of the 7 consecutive days immediately before Day 1 and continue until Week  36. 
If participants are on a stable regimen of low to medium  potency TCS or TCI at  the screening  
visit, they can continue their topi[INVESTIGATOR_245556] m 
Screening to Week  24. If specific lesions resolve, the participant can stop applying steroids to 
those sites but are permitted to continue applying to persistent lesions. If participants are on stable 
regimens of high potency or superpotent steroids , participants should decrease potency to medium  
potency TCS and continue to apply daily from screening to Week  24. Occlusion is not al lowed 
from Screening to Week  24. 
Participant s can be rescued with high potency  or superpotent  TCS/TCI as needed throughout the  
study.  
Post-trial access to study medication

Statistical considerations:  
• Randomization  
- The participant s will b e randomized to d upi[INVESTIGATOR_245557] 1:1 ratio with 
stratification factors of documented history of atopy (atopic or non -atopic),  stable use 
of TCS/TCI (yes or no),  and country /territory code . Number of participants with active 
mild AD upon study entry  will represent up  to 10% of the atopic participant s. Both t he 
atopic and the non-atopic PN population  will be capped  at 60% of the total enrolled 
population .

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 15 • Sample size calculation  
- The primary endpoint is  the proportion of participant s with a WI-NRS  reduction  of 
≥4 from baseline to  Week  12. Assuming a response rate of  in placebo 
and d upi[INVESTIGATOR_245558], 56 participant s/arm will provide 90%  power to detect the 
difference of  between dupi[INVESTIGATOR_245559] 2 -sided 
level of 0.05. Assuming 15% drop out during the 12 weeks of treatment, the target is  to 
randomize 75 participant s/arm to allow for up to 10% of atopic  patients having active 
mild AD upon study entry . 
• Primary analysis  
- The analysis population for the efficacy endpoints will be the intent -to-treat (ITT ) 
population defi ned as all randomized participant s analyzed according to the treatment 
group allocated by [CONTACT_245630].  
- The primary analysis o n WI -NRS  reduction ≥4 at Week  12 will be conducted by [CONTACT_245631] -Mantel -Haenszel ( CMH ) test stratifying by [CONTACT_245632] s (documented 
history of atopy [atopic or non -atopic ], stable use of  TCS/TCI [yes or no ], and region 
[countries combined ]) and covariate of baseline anti -depressant use (yes or no) . For 
participants discontinuing the study treatment before Week  12, their off -study 
treatment values measured up to Week  12 will be included in the analysis. Participants 
taking selected prohibited medications and/or rescue medications (details of selection 
will be specified in the statistical analysis plan [SAP]) prior to Week  [ADDRESS_298659] 
missing data at Week  12 will be cons idered non -responders.  
- Sensitivity analyses using alternative methods will be performed to handle missing 
data and/or data collected after participant s taking selected prohibited medications 
and/or rescue medications. A subgroup  analysis will be performed  excluding 
participants with a current diagnosis of AD. More details of the sensitivity  and 
subgroup  analyses will be specified in the SAP . 
• Analysis of secondary endpoints  
- Secondary efficacy endpoints that measure binary responses will be analyzed in the 
same fashion as the primary endpoint.  
- Time -to-event secondary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using the Cox 
proportional hazards model, including treatment, stratification factors (countrie s 
combined to region ), and covariate of baseline anti -depressant use (yes or no ). The 
hazards ratio, its 95% confidence interval and p -value will be reported. Kaplan -Meier 
curves will be also provided . 
- Continuous secondary efficacy e ndpoints will be analyz ed using a hybrid method of 
the worst observation carried forward (WOCF ) and multiple imputations. Data of  
participants  taking s elected prohibited medications  and/or  rescue medications will be 
set to missing  after the medication usage, and the worst postbaseline value on or before 
the time of the medication usage will be used to impute missing endpoint value (for 
participants  whose postbaseline values are all missing, the baseline will b e used to 
impute). Participants  who discontinue the treatment prematurely are encouraged to 
follow the planned clinical visits and in th ose participant s who did not take the selected  
prohibited medications  and/or rescue medications , all data collected afte r treatment

testing procedure will be defined in the study SAP. The study is considered positive 
when the primary endpoint achieves statistical significance.  
• Planned d atabase lock date

treatment of PN (3, 4, 5, 6). Type  2 cytokine involvement is implicated in all forms of PN.  This is

2.2 BACKGROUND   
Prurigo nodularis  is a skin disease characterized by [CONTACT_27873], intensely itchy skin eruptions in 
symmetrically distributed areas of the extremities ( 1). The main symptom is prolonged, repetitive 
and uncontrollable rubbing, scratching and uncontrollable itching which leads to hyperkeratotic 
eroding papules and nodules on the skin.  A broadly accepted definition  for chronic prurigo  has 
been published by [CONTACT_245635] (EADV ) (10). The 
convened experts agreed  that chronic prurigo should be used as an umbrella term for the range of 
clinical manifestations (eg , papular, nodular, plaque or umbilicated types). Prurigo  nodularis  is

and/or signs of repeated scratching and multiple localized/generalized pruriginous skin lesions 
(whitish , hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_49194],  or pi[INVESTIGATOR_245565], nodules  and/or plaques).  
Pathophysiological studies in PN patients reveal increased dermal nerve fiber density and changes 
in many types of skin cells. These skin cells cause inflammation and pruritus (severe, constant 
itching) through the release of cytokine IL -31, tryptase, prostaglandins, eosinophil cationic 
protein, histamine, and neuropeptides, such as substance P, calcitonin gene -related peptide and 
nerve growth factor  (11). The itch caused by [CONTACT_245637]. This neuronal 
hypersensitization is the final common pathway which drives th e symptomatol ogy of PN ( 1). 
Fukushi et al. studied 22 PN skin biopsies and found that 86% of them showed activation of 
STAT6, a marker for Type [ADDRESS_298668] activ ation downstream of the Type  2 
cytokin es IL-4 and IL -13 (12). Consistent with this, IL -4 and IL -5 messenger RNA  expression is 
upregulated in the skin of PN patients ( 13). Importantly, these two studies did not mention  
whether these skin biopsy specimens came from patients with or without atopy. The etiology of 
the profound pruritus in this disease is thought to be driven by [CONTACT_245638]  2 inflammat ion driving 
activity at the level of the sensory neuron. Human sensory neurons in skin that transmit the 
sensation of itch are known to express IL - 4Rα, IL-13Ra1, and IL -31RA  (14). On testing for 
functional stimulation, IL -4 was shown to enhance responsiveness to ot her pruritogens like 
histamine ( 14). These findings support that Type  2 cytokines may play a principal role in the 
pathogenesis of PN.  
Due to  the central manifestation of itch, PN carries a  significant burden of disease ( 10, 15). The 
effect on quali ty of life due to PN has been reported to be higher than other common skin 
disorders like AD and psoriasis (16). Patients report chronic sleep loss due to constant itching; 
constant burning, stinging, and pain at affected area; and chronic depression, anxiety, anger, 
disgust, and shame; and hence overall experience a great impact on their quality of life. According 
to a 5 year cross -sectional study on 909 adult PN patients in the John Hopkins hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42619] 
(15), PN is a key contributing factor to mood d isorders such as anxiety and depression. Of all 
patients with chronic pruritus, 70% have some type of psychiatric comorbidity, and the severity of 
depression in patients with chronic pruritus correlates with intensity of itch. The concomitant 
psychologic c omponent of PN likely contributes to the challenging nature of treating this disease.  
Data on the epi[INVESTIGATOR_245566]. Most studies show a predominance of older patients 
with a median age of more than 50 years ( 2, 10, 15). Prurigo nodularis is only occasionally 
observed in younger patients, in whom it is often associated with atopic conditions (17). 
There are no FDA or EMA approved targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_245544] , whether 
atopic or non -atopic forms; the lesions of atopic and non -atopic PN are clinically 
indistinguishable and treatment options remain the same. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_245567].  While there is a mechanistic rationale for their use, no rigorous clinical 
studies confirming their efficacy  were identified . Anecdotal feedback obtained from 
derm atological experts indicate variable, modest efficacy. For thicker lesions, TCS is also 
administered intralesionally. Lesional cryotherapy is another available topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786]; case 
reports indicate temporary relief. Antihistamines and antileukotrienes a re occasionally used; their 
efficacy, however, is not supported by [CONTACT_245639], randomized clinical trials and is rated low

added in patients not responding to topi[INVESTIGATOR_245568]. While some improvements with 
phototherapy have been reported, they re main usually partial and complete remissions are 
uncommon.  
Oral immunosuppressants such as methotrexate and cyclosporine have been used off -label with 
some success as reported based on case reports and retrospective ( 18). Use of cyclosporine in 
PN is limited by [CONTACT_245640], impaired renal and 
hepatic function, and potential for increased susceptibility to infections and cancer, particularly 
skin cancer, due to decreased cancer immunosurveillance  (19). Methotrexate has well established 
toxicities, in particular, myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity. In addition, the broad 
immunosuppression caused by [CONTACT_245641][INVESTIGATOR_245569], fungal, viral, and mycobacterial infections.  
Neuromodulatory agent s such as gabapentin and anti -inflammatory agents such as thalidomide 
have been used in PN with varying degrees of success ( 18), but have also  considerable adverse 
effects. Adverse effects of thalidomide include peripheral neuropathies, sedation, dizziness and 
teratogenicity, while adverse effects of gabapentin include headache, sedation and dizziness.  
Overall, despi[INVESTIGATOR_245570], many patients with PN remain uncontrolled, and 
some of the available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_245571]. Given the 
lack of targeted treatments and the suboptimal efficacy associated with currently available 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], t here remains a significant unmet need in patients with PN.

the pathophysiology of the disease support itch as a reasonable primary endpoint. This choice is in 
line with the study design  publicly available for other drug classes such as NK1 -antagonists (20). 
Amongst standard measurement instruments for evaluation of chronic pruritus, NRS  assessing 
worst itch in the past 24 hours features high reliability and concurrent validity and is a popular 
choice for all patients due to its simple format (21, 22, 23, 24). The proposed WI-NRS  is currently 
being u sed in Phase 3 trial assessing serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_245586] ( 20). A similar pruritus NRS 
(peak  pruritus) has been validated for AD. Additional validation work covering PN as additional 
indication will be conducted  in the context of the current study . The primary assessment will be a

to the assessment widely used in AD studies , and similar to the value proposed for assessment of

starting at Week  [ADDRESS_298673] 4 points at Week  24. 
As another key secondary endpoint, PN lesions will be assessed by [CONTACT_245643] -Stage, which is a 
scale that measures the approximate nu mber of nodules. The estimated number of lesions 
correlates well with increasing DLQI scores (ie , worsened quality of life), and demonstrates very 
good inter -rater reliability and test -retest reliability ( 25). The IGA scale  is widely used in several 
dermatological indications (eg, as Physician Global Assessment [ PGA ] in psoriasis). A modified 
PAS will be used as an exploratory measure. Both instruments are PN -specific and have been 
developed by [CONTACT_210319]. These are the only two disease -specific instruments currently 
available for the lesion assessment . The validation of both  instruments for use in PN will be 
conducted in the context of the Phase 3 trials .  
Secondary e ndpoints will also include  HRQoL  assessments using  the skin-disease specific DLQI 
in recognition of the significant impacts on quality of life experienced by [CONTACT_245644]. Even 
though not validated in PN specifically, the DLQI is well established and widely used to assess 
HRQoL in patients with skin  conditions in clinical trials ( 26).

4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  FOR STUDY DESIGN   
This study is a multi -center, 24 -week treatment , double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study 
to evaluate the use of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_245589]. Based on mechanistic data (see  Section  2), 
Type  [ADDRESS_298675] of active dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24736].  
The patient population to be studied in this trial is intended to include patients with underlying 
systemic medical conditions know n to be associated with PN. Given that better control of severe 
manifestations of underlying systemic illnesses can confound the primary itch endpoint, we will 
enroll 40% to 60 % of non -atopic PN patients that have medically well -controlled systemic 
conditi ons. Since the literature suggests that approximately 20%-60% of PN patients have a 
history of atopy (defined as having a medical history of AD, allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivits, 
asthma, or food allergy), our study design will require that the remaining PN patients have a 
history  or a current diagnosis  of atopy. Because active AD can confound the primary endpoint, we 
will exclude moderate -to-severe AD patients and will institute a cap of up to 10% of the atopic 
patient  subgroup having active mil d AD . It is the goal of this design to mirror the overall PN 
patient population consistent with real -world estimates of overall prevalence while trying to 
minimize potential confounders on the primary endpoint.

Dosing regimens of 300  mg Q2W after a loading dose of 600  mg were used in the PN case 
studies, which resulted in marked improvement in itch within three months and subsequently 
a notable improvement of th e skin lesions  (see Section  2).  
The 300  mg Q2W  dose, with loading dose, is the approved dose for AD and  is an approve d dose  
for asthma in the US  and the EU . 
Therefore, based on the totality of the data, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300  mg Q2W (with loading dose) regimen

5.4 SCREEN FAILURES   
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are 
not subsequently randomly assigned to study intervention/entered in the stud y. A minimal set of 
screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants 
to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT ) publishing requirements and 
to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, 
screen failure reasons, eligibility criteria, and any SAE.  
In the case of technical malfunction of equipment, the patient may  be rescreened. Patients who 
fail the exclusion criteria may be rescreened once during the open screening period of the study. 
Rescreened participants will be assigned a new participant number versus the one received for the 
initial screening.  
There is no  requirement for a waiting period between the screen -failure date and the rescreening 
date. The interactive response technology (IRT ) report will flag rescreened patients. Patients that 
are rescreened must sign a new consent form and all Visit [ADDRESS_298689] finally meets the eligibility criteria.

course of the study.  
Participants will be required to apply moisturizers (emollients) once or twice daily for at least 
5 out of the 7  consecutive days immediately befo re Day 1 and continue until Week  36. All types 
of moisturizers are permitted, but patients may not initiate new treatment with prescription 
moisturizers or over -the-counter moisturizers containing additives during the screening period or 
during the interve ntion period. Patients may continue using stable doses of such moisturizers if 
initiated before the screening visit.  
If participants are o n a stable regimen of low  to medium potency TCS or TCI at the screening 
visit, they can continue their topi[INVESTIGATOR_245596]  24. If specific lesions resolve, the participant can stop applying steroids to 
those sites but are permitted to continue applying to persistent lesions. If participants are on stable 
regimens of high potency or superpotent steroids, participants should decrease potency to medium 
potency TCS and continue to apply daily from screening to Week  24. Stable regimen for TCS is 
maintaining the same medicine (low to medium potency TCS), and maintaining the same 
frequency of treatment (once or twice daily) used from 2  weeks prior to screening. Stable regimen 
for TCI is maintaining the same medicine of TCI and the treatment frequency (once or twice 
daily) used from 2  weeks prior to screening. If participan t’s prior regimen was applying once 
daily, the participant will maintain daily application during study and for participants who had 
twice daily prior to screening, participation will maintain twice daily regimen during study. 
Ifspecific lesions resolve, t he participant can stop applying steroids to those sites but are permitted 
to continue applying to persistent lesions.  Occlusion is not allowed from Screening to Week  24. 
It is recommended that patients use triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream or fluocinolon e 
acetonide 0.025% ointment for medium potency, and hydrocortisone 1% cream for low potency. 
If rescue with TCS is needed, it is recommended that patients use either betamethasone 
dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 0.05% optimized ointment for high potency TCS or clobetasol pro pi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 
0.05%  cream for super high potency TCS. If patients have tolerance issues with any of these

Methods of assigning patients to treatment group  
The randomized intervention kit number list is generated centrally by [CONTACT_245647]. The randomization and intervention allocatio n are 
performed centrally by [CONTACT_209473]. The IRT generates the participant randomization list and allocates 
the intervention number and the corresponding intervention kits to the participants according to it.  
Participant s will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to tre atment arms described in Table  2. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_15006]:  
• documented history of atopy ( atopic  or no n-atopic ) 
- Atopic: Patients with a physician -documented history of atopic comorbidities def ined 
as AD, allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivits, asthma, or food allergy, or a current 
diagnosis of at least one of these atopic comorbidities, per investigator judgement. 
NOTE: enrollment of patients with a current diagnosis of active mild AD will be 
capped at up to 10% of the participants in this subgroup  
- Non-atopic: Patients without a physician -documented history of atopic comorbidities 
defined as AD, allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma or food allergy, and 
without a current diagnosis of at le ast one of such atopic comorbidities, per 
investigator judgement  
• stable use of TCS /TCI (yes or no)

intervention regardless whether the interv ention kit was used or not (ie, participant registered by 
[CONTACT_6606]).  
A participant cannot be randomized more than once in the study.  
Study intervention will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in SoA  (see Section  1.3). 
Returned study intervention should not be re -dispensed to the participants.  
Methods of blinding

The IRT will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the 
Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’s treatment 
assignment is warranted (eg, in case of available antidote). Participant safety must always be the 
first consideration in making such a de termination. If the Investigator decides that unblinding is 
warranted, the Investigator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_27464] 
a participant’s treatment assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the 
participant.  If a participant’s treatment assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor must be notified

according to the labeling instructions.  
IMP a ccountability:  
• Intervention units  are returned by [CONTACT_21439]. In case of DTP process, the 
intervention units can be returned by [CONTACT_21440] (if defined in the contract) . 
• The Investigator counts the number of remaining kit/pre -filled syri nge, and fills in the IMP 
accountability and inventory forms . 
• The Investigator or his/her delegate records the dosing information on the appropriate 
page(s) of the eCRF . 
• The monitor in charge of the study then checks the eCRF data by [CONTACT_245648] e 
IMP which he/she has retrieved and source documents . 
Participant compliance with study intervention will be assessed at each visit. Compliance will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_245649]/pre -filled syringe . Deviation(s) from the prescribed dosage 
regime n should be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY   
Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives 
during the study must be recorded along with:  
• Reason for use.  
• Dates of administration including start and end dates.  
• Dosage information including dose and frequency.  
The concomitant use of non-sedating antihistamine administration is allowed during the study 
except for treatment of AD or PN, but dose change of non -sedating antihistamine is not allowed

PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION /WITHDRAWAL     
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY INTERVENTION    
7.1.1  Definitive discontinuation   
In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant  to permanently discontinue study 
intervention. If study intervention is permanently discontinued, the participant will remain in the 
study to be evaluated for  safety . See the So A (Section  1.3) for data to be collected at the time of 
discontinuation of study intervention.  
The participants may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if he or she decides to do so, at any  
time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be the investigator’s decision. All efforts should 
be made to document the reason(s) for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented 
in the eCRF.  
Participants must be permanently withdrawn from the study treatment for the following reasons:  
• At their own request or at the request of their legally authorized representative (legally 
authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under 
applicable law to consent on  behalf of a prospective participant to the patient’s 
participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research).  
• If, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation in the study would be detrimental to the 
participant’s well -being.  
• At the specific request of the Sponsor.  
• If they are treated with the specific prohibited medications mentioned in Section  6.5. 
• If they miss more than 2 consecutive IMP doses . 
• In the event of a protocol deviation, at the discretion of the investigator or the Sponsor.  
• Any code broken at the requested of the investigat or.  
• Pregnancy . 
• Anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require 
treatment (see Section  10.8).  
• Diagnosis of a malignancy during study, excluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or 
squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.  
• Any opportunistic infection or other infections whose nature or course may suggest 
an immunocompromise d status (see Section  10.9).  
• Serum A LT >[ADDRESS_298695] and Total Bilirubin > [ADDRESS_298696] (see  Section  10.6).  
• Serum ALT >[ADDRESS_298697] if baseline ALT ≤[ADDRESS_298698] or ALT >[ADDRESS_298699] if baseline ALT >[ADDRESS_298700]

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 48 If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline 
in QT interval corrected using Fridericia’s formula [QTcF ] after enrollment ), the Investigator  or 
qualified designee will determine if the participant can continue in the study and if any change in 
participant management is needed. This re view of the ECG printed at the time of collection must 
be documented. Any new clinically relevant finding should be reported as an AE.  
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation  within a reasonable timef rame as assessed by [CONTACT_245650] a 
decision of definitive discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned participant.  
Handling of participants after  definitive  intervention  discontinuation  
Participants will be followed -up according to the  study procedures specified in this protocol up to 
the scheduled date of study completion, or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be 
followed -up as specified in this protocol, whichever comes last.  
Participants who discontinue the study intervention prematurely (prior to completing the 24 -week 
treatment period) will perform, as soon as possible, the early termination visit with all assessments 
normally planned for the EOT Visit (Visit 6), to assure a complete clinical assessment in close 
temporal proximity to the premature termination of study treatment is available.  
In addition, and to allow assessment of participant outcomes over the stipulated study period, 
patients will be asked and encouraged to complete all remaining study treatment visits, and

Reinitiation of intervention  with the IMP will be done under close and appropriate clinical/and or 
laboratory monitoring once the Investigator  will have considered according to his/her best medical 
judgment that the responsibility of the IMP(s) in the occurrence of the concerned event was 
unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to  Section  5). 
7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION/ WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY   
• A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator  for safety, behavioral, 
compliance, or administrative reasons.  This is expected to be uncommon . 
• At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an early discontinuation visit 
should be conducted, as shown in the SoA  (Section  1.3). See SoA for data to be collected 
at the time of study discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that 
need to be completed.  
• The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the study intervention and 
from the study at that time.  
• If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor  may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
• If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples 
taken and not tested, and the Investigator  must document this in the site study records.  
If participants no longer wish to take the IMP, they will be encouraged to remain  in the study.  
The Investigator s should discuss with them key visits to attend. The value of all their study data 
collected during their continued involvement will be emphasized as important to the public health 
value of the study.  
Participants who withdra w from the study intervention  should be explicitly asked about the 
contribution of possible AEs to their decision, and any AE information elicited must be 
documented.  
All study withdrawals should be recorded by [CONTACT_245653] o f the 
eCRF  and in the participant ’s medical records. In the medical record, at least the date of the 
withdrawal and the reason should be documented.  
In addition, a participant  may withdraw his/her consent to stop participating in the study. 
Withdrawal of c onsent for intervention  should be distinguished from withdrawal of consent for 
follow -up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non -participant  contact [CONTACT_6492] -up, 
eg, medical record checks. The site should document any case of withdrawal of consent.  
Participants who have withdrawn from the study cannot be  rerandomized  (treated) in the study. 
Their inclusion and intervention  numbers must not be reused.

waivers or exemptions are not allowed.  
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA  
(see Section  1.3), is essential and required for study conduct.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed t o confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator  will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures  conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count)  and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed 
within the time frame defined in the SoA  (see Section  1.3). 
• Patient -Reported Outcome questionnaires including NRS should be completed by [CONTACT_2416] s before the consultation and/or clinical tests, in a quiet place. The 
questionnaires should be completed by [CONTACT_2299] s themselves, independently from 
their p hysician, the  study nurse or any other medical personnel and without any help from 
friends or relatives . 
• In light of the public health emergency related to Coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID -19) 
(or in case of any other pandemic requiring public health emergency), the continuity of 
clinical study conduct and oversight may require implementation of temporary or 
alternative mechanisms eg, phone contact, virtual visits, online meetings, use of local 
clinic or laboratory locations, and home visits by [CONTACT_25011]. Implementation of such 
mechanisms may differ country by [CONTACT_1606], depending on country regulations and local 
business continuity plans. Additionally, no waivers to deviate from protocol enrol lment 
criteria due to COVID -19 (or any other pandemic) will be granted. All temporary 
mechanisms utilized, and deviations from planned study procedures are to be documented 
as being related to COVID -19 (or any other pandemic) and will remain in effect only  for 
the duration of the public health emergency .

questionnaires during their site visit on a tablet that will be provided to the site. This device is 
kept at the site during the study.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_298704] -itch numerical rating scale (WI -NRS) is a PRO  comprised of a single item rated on a scale 
from 0 (“No itch”) to 10 (“Worst imaginable itch”). Participant s are asked to rate the intensity of 
their worst pruritus  (itch) over the past 24 hours using this scale.   
Participant s will complete the WI -NRS daily according to the SoA  (see Section  1.3). The 
assessment tool is provided in  Section  10.7.1 . 
8.1.2  Investigator’s global assessment  for prurigo  nodularis   
Investigator’s global assessment for prurigo  nodularis  (IGA  PN) is a  clinician -reported outcome  
(ClinRO ) that allows clinicians to assess the activity of PN (IGA PN -A) using a 5 -point scale 
from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe); and the stage of the disease (IGA PN -S) using a 5 -point scale from 
0 (clear) to 4 (severe).  
Clinicians will complete the IGA  PN as described in the SoA  (see Section  1.3). The assessment 
tool is provided in Section  10.7.2 .  
8.1.3  Prurigo activity score   
The PAS is a ClinRO  measur ement. The original PAS questionnaire Version 0.9 consists of 
7 items, developed by [CONTACT_245654] ( 25). The items of the PAS evalua te the pruriginous 
lesions in terms of:  
• Type (visible lesions: Item 1a; predominant lesions: Item 1b);  
• Estimated number (Item 2);  
• Distribution (Item 3, 4);  
• Size (biggest lesion: Item 6a; representative lesion: Item 6b).  
Other items evaluate the represent ative body area and exact number of lesions (Item 5), the 
activity in terms of percentage of pruriginous lesions with excoriations/crusts on top (reflecting 
active scratching; Item 7a) and the percentage of healed pruriginous lesions (reflecting healing of  
chronic prurigo ; Item 7b).  
A 5-item simplified version of the PAS will be used in the current study.  In particular, 
Item 3 (lesion distribution) and Item 6 (lesion monitoring) of the original PAS were removed, and 
the response options slightly modified and refined .

8.1.4  Dermatology life quality index   
The DLQI is a PRO developed to measure dermatology -specific HRQ oL in adult patients (27). 
The instrument comprises [ADDRESS_298705] of skin disease on patients’ HRQ oL over 
the previous week. The items cover symptoms, leisure activities, work/school or holiday ti me, 
personal relationships including intimate, the side effects of treatment, and emotional reactions to 
having a skin disease. It is a  validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials 
(26). Response sca le is a 4 -point L ikert scale  (0 = “not at all” and 3 = “very much”) for 
nine items. The remaining one item about work/studying asks whether work/study has been 
prevented and  then (if “No”) to what degree the skin condition has been a problem at work/study; 
the item is rated on a 3 -point L ikert scale ( “Not at all ” to “A lot ”). Overall scoring ranges from 
0 to 30, with a high score indicative  of a poor  HRQoL.

The Euroqol -5 dimensions (EQ -5D) is a standardized PRO measure of health status developed by 
[CONTACT_245655] a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and 
economic appraisal  (30). The EQ -5D consists of 2 parts: the descriptive system and the EQ v isual 
analog scale ( VAS ). The EQ -5D descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: 
mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimens ion has 
5 levels of perceived problems: “no problem”, “slight problems”, “moderate problems ”, “severe 
problems ” and “inability to do the activity ”. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health 
state by [CONTACT_13158] (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of 
the 5  dimensions; this results in a 1 -digit number expressing the level for that dimension. The 
digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5 -digit number describing the respondent’s health 
state. The EQ  VAS recor ds the respondent’s self -rated health on a vertical VAS  where the 
endpoints are labeled “best imaginable health state (100)” and “worst imaginable health state (0)”. 
This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by [CONTACT_173896].  
Participant s will complete the questionnaire as described in the SoA  (see Section  1.3). The 
assessment tool is provided in Section  10.7.6 .

• Symptomatic overdose (serious or nonserious) with IMP/NIMP  
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP is an event suspected by [CONTACT_209488] 11 days. The circumstances 
(ie, accidental or intentional) should be clearly specified in the verbatim and 
symptoms, if any, entered on separate AE forms.  
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) with any NIMP is an event suspected by [CONTACT_245657] , within the intended therapeutic interval. 
The circumstances (ie, accidental or intentional) should be clearly specified in the 
overdose form.  
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 3 ( Section  10.3). 
Adverse events  will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a care giver, 
surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative).  
The Investigator  and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for fo llowing 
up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study intervention  or study procedures, or that 
caused the participant to discontinue the  study intervention  (see Section  7). 
8.3.1  Time period and frequency for collecting AE and SAE information   
All AEs, serious or non serious,  will be collected from the signing of the ICF  until the EOS visit  at 
the time points specified in the SoA ( Section  1.3). 
All SAEs and AESI  will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee immediately and 
under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3 ( Section  10.3). The 
Investigator  will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor  within 24  hours of it being available.  
Investigators  are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE after conclusion of the study participa tion. 
However, if the Investigator  learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has 
been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study 
intervention  or study participation, the Investigator  must promptly notify the Sponsor .

The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting SAE reports  are provided in Appendix  3 (Section  10.3). 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SA Es. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method t o inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
8.3.3  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs   
After the initial AE/ AESI/ SAE report, the Investigator  is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  At the pre -specified study end -date,  all SAEs  and 
nonserious AESI  (as defined in Section  8.3) will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the 
event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  7.3). 
Further information on follow -up procedures is given in  Appendix 3 ( Section  10.3). 
8.3.4  Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs   
• Prompt notification by [CONTACT_208022] a SAE is essential so that legal 
obligat ions and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of 
a study intervention  under clinical investigation are met.  
• The Sponsor  has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agen cies about the safety of a study intervention  under clinical 
investigation. The Sponsor  will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards 
(IRB )/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC ), and Investigator s. 
• Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected seriou s adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R ) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor  policy and 
forwarded to Investigator s as necessary.  
• Adverse events that are considered expec ted will be specified in the reference safety 
information . 
• An Investigator  who receives an Investigator  safety report describing a SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor  will review 
and then file it along  with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to 
local requirements.  
8.3.5  Pregnancy   
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants  and female partners of male participants  
will be collected after the start of study intervention  and until  the outcome has been 
determined.

The statistical hypotheses for comparing dupi[INVESTIGATOR_245604] -NRS reduction  of ≥4 (minimally important difference) at 
Week 12 are as follows:  
• Null hypothesis H0: No treatment difference between dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24765]  
• Alternative hypothesis H1: There is a treatment difference between dupi[INVESTIGATOR_245605].  
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMIN ATION   
The primary endpoint is the proportion of participant s with WI-NRS reduction of ≥4 from 
baseline to  Week  12. By [CONTACT_245660][INVESTIGATOR_245606], 56 participant s/arm will provide 90% power to detect the difference of  between 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_245607] 2 -sided level of 0.05. Assuming 15% drop out 
during the 12 weeks of treatme nt, the target is to randomize 7 5 participant s/arm  with a cap of up 
to 10% of participants  in the atopic population having active mil d AD . 
Approximately 15 0 participant s will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_298719] of d upi[INVESTIGATOR_245608] -NRS reduction ≥ 4 at Week  16

RECORDING, EVALUATIN G, FOLLOW -UP, AND RE PORTING   
DEFINITION OF AE  
AE definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study intervention , whether or n ot considered related 
to the study intervention . 
NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention . 
Events meeting  the AE definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the me dical 
and scientific judgment of the Investigator  (ie, not related to progression of underlying 
disease) . 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New cond itions detected or diagnosed after study intervention  administration even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequel ae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention  or a concomitant medication.  
• “Lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacological action ” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments . 
However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy 
will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.  
Events NOT meeting the AE definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findin gs or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_21501]’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 76 • Situations in which an un toward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen . 
DEFINITION OF SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease).  
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical oc currence that, at any dose:  
a) Results in death  
b) Is life -threatening  
The term “ life-threatening ” in the definition of “serious ” refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c) Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12993], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12332]/or treatment  that would not have been appropriate in the physi cian’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or  was necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21358] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
d) Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
- The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
- This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accide ntal trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
f) Other situations:  
- Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in decidi ng whether SAE reporting 
is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_245612]. These events should usually be 
considered serious.

an emergency room  or at home for allergic bronc hospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.  
RECORDING AND FOLLOW -UP OF AE AND/OR SAE  
AE and SAE r ecording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigat or to review all  
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.  
• The Investigator  will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.  
• It is not acceptable for the Investigator  to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records to the Sponsor’s representative  in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE CRF page.  
• There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_88650]’s representative . In such case, care should be taken to ensure that the patient's 
identity is protected and the patient's identifiers in the study are properly mentioned on any 
copy of a source document provided to the Sponsor . 
• The Investigator  will attempt to establish a di agnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of intensity  
The Investigator  will make an assessment of int ensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study and assign it to 1 of the following categories:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal discomfort and 
not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate: An event tha t causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the 
inten sity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
An event is defined as “ serious ” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.  
Assessment of causality  
• The Investigator  is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention  and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A “reasonable possibility ” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rath er than  that a relationship cannot be ruled 
out.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 78 • The Investigator  will use clinical judgment to determine whether or not the  relationship  is 
causal . 
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention  
administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The Investigator  will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the Invest igator  must  document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator  has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to  the Sponsor’s representative . However, it is 
very important that the Investigator  always make an assessment of causality for 
every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor’s 
representative . 
• The Investigator  may change his/her o pi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information 
and send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• The Investigator  is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_1034]’s 
representative  to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as  
possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
• If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the Investigator  will provide the Sponsor’s representative  with a copy of any 
post-mortem findings including histopathology . 
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.  
• The Investigator  will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor  within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
REPORTING OF SAES  
SAE reporting to the Sponsor via an electronic data collection tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to the Sponsor’s representative  will be the 
electronic data collection tool.  
• If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data col lection 
tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours.  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the elec tronic system as soon as it becomes available.

• If a site receives a report of a new SAE f rom a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken 
off-line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or 
to the  Sponsor’s representa tive by [CONTACT_756].  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the protocol . 
SAE reporting to the Sponsor’s representative via paper CRF  
• Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this

Female participants of childbearing potential are  eligible to participate if they agree to use 
a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described below.  
 
Contraceptivesa allowed during the study include:  
Highly effective m ethodsb that have low user dependency  
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
• Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb 
- Intrauterine device (IUD)  
- Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)b 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
Vasectomized partner  
(Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the 
WOCBP  and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception 
should be used. Spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.)  
Highly effective m ethodsb that are user dependent  
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition o f ovulationc 
- oral 
- intravaginal  
- transdermal  
- injectable  
• Progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationc 
- oral 
- injectable  
Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual inter course 
during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant .)

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 81 COLLECTION OF  PREGNANCY INFORMATION:  
Male participants with partners who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male participant’s 
female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in this study. This 
applies only to male participants who receive  dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] . 
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and 
submit it to the Sponsor wi thin 24 hours  of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The 
female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. 
Generally, the follow -up will be n o longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status 
(presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
Female participants who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the 
appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of 
a participant 's pregnancy. The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. The Investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant and the 
neonate and the information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow -up will  
not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence 
of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
• Any pregnancy complication or el ective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as 
an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be 
reported as such. Any post -study pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to 
the study intervention by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator will be reported to the Sponsor as described in 
Section  8.3.4  of the protocol. While the Investigator  is not obligated to actively seek this 
information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through 
spontaneous reporting.  
• Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will 
discontinue study intervention.

Use/Analysis of DNA  and RNA  
• Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to study intervention , susceptibility 
to, and severity and progression of disease. Variable response to study intervention  may be 
due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and

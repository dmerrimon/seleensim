Version 2. 3 Date: February [ADDRESS_77548]  
STUDY OBJECTIVES: This is a human laboratory clinical pharmacology study to assess 
potential interactions between intravenous cocaine and treatment with clavulanic acid (CLAV) . 
 Primary : The primary objective of this study is to determine if there are significant interactio ns 
between CLAV treatment concurrent with i.v. cocaine infusions of 40 mg by [CONTACT_71426] [heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and electrocardiogram (ECG)] in adult subjects with cocaine use disor der.  
 Secondary:  
 1. To evaluate whether the acute administration of CLAV alters the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
cocaine or its major metabolite, benzoylecgonine (BE) in adult subjects with cocaine use disorder. 
2. To determine PK of CLAV in adult subjects with cocaine use disorder during treatment at 250 mg/day (low dose) and 500 mg/day ( medium dose) . 
3. To evaluate whether there are significant pharmacodynamic (PD)  interactions between 
CLAV treatment (250 mg, 500 mg) concurrent with i.v. cocaine infusions of 40 mg by [CONTACT_71425] a pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60187]. 
 Exploratory: 
 1. To evaluate whether CLAV treatment alters the subjective effects of cocaine measured by 
[CONTACT_71427] (VAQ) and the V isual Analog Scales (VAS), the perceived 
value of the dose of cocaine measured by [CONTACT_71428] (DVQ), and craving 
measured by [CONTACT_71429]- Brief (CCQ -Brief).  
2. To assess the effects of clavulanic acid on mood and personality  using the Profile of Mood 
States (POMS) and on the abuse liability using the Addiction Research Center Inventory 
(ARCI).   
3. To evaluate the safety of CLAV treatment concurrent with iv cocaine infusions with subjects with combined cocaine and opi[INVESTIGATOR_71418]. 
4. To evaluate the safety and  whether there are significant PD interactions between CLAV 
treatment 750 mg concurrent with i.v. cocaine infusions of 40 mg.  
 STUDY ENDPOINTS :  
 Primary endpoint :  Safety and toleration as assessed by  [CONTACT_71430] .   In addition, the following 
cardiovascular measures wil l be assessed  during the three study periods: supi[INVESTIGATOR_71419] ( BP, HR) and ECG standard 12- lead monitoring  (QTc prolongation).   
 Secondary endpoints : 
 
1. PK of cocaine alone will be compared statistically with PK  when both Cocaine and 
CLAV (250 mg, 500 mg) are present . Both the PK of cocaine and its major metabolite, 
 
Protocol Clavulanic Acid - Cocaine Interaction Study   6 
Version 2. 3 Date: February 2 2, 2018 BE, will be evaluated with both doses of CLAV.  PK will be sampled close to T max and drug 
levels during combination therapy will be compared with drug levels during treatment with 
each drug alone.  
2. PK of CLAV alone will be compared statistically at both doses of CLAV (250 mg, 500 mg) PK will be sampled close to T
max. If possible, important gende r differences in CLAV PK 
will be explored. 
3. PD. Pupil diameter  (over time ) after Cocaine infusion alone (with PBO) will be compared 
with pupil diameter ( over time ) after Cocaine infusion with CLAV at both doses (250 mg, 
500 mg). 
Exploratory:  
1. Subjective effects  of cocaine alone  (PBO)  will be  compared with subjective effects of 
cocaine and CLAV (250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg)  using both the Visual Analog Questionnaire 
(VAQ) and the Visual Analog Scales (VAS)  for each condition (COC+PBO vs. 
COC+CLAV).  The perceived value of cocaine alone (PBO) will be compared with the 
perceived value of cocaine in combination with CLAV (250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg) using the Drug Value Questionnaire (DVQ) for  each condition (COC+PBO vs. COC+CLAV).   
Cocaine craving  associated with cocaine alone (PBO) will be compared with the craving 
associated with cocaine and CLAV (250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg) using measured by [CONTACT_71429]- Brief (CCQ -Brief).  
 2. The subjective effects of clavulanic acid  without cocaine  (250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg) on 
mood and personality will be assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) score for each dose of CLAV compared with the score on PBO. The effects of CLAV on  the abuse 
liability using the Addiction Research Center Inventor y (ARCI)  will be compared at each 
dose of CLAV (250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg) compared with PBO score. 
 
3. Safety of clavulanic acid and buprenorphine in combination with cocaine. Safety and toleration as assessed by  [CONTACT_71431][INVESTIGATOR_71420].   In addition, the 
following cardiovascular measures will be assessed during the three study periods: supi[INVESTIGATOR_71421] (BP, HR) and ECG standard 12- lead monitoring (QTc 
prolongation).  
 
4. Safety of 750 mg clavulanic acid dose.  Safety and toleration as assessed by  [CONTACT_71432].    In addition, the following cardiovascular measures will be assessed and compared with placebo: supi[INVESTIGATOR_71421] (BP, HR) and ECG standard 12 -lead monitoring (QTc prolongation).  
 STUDY DESIGN:  This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled inpatient cross-over 
study of CLAV for Cocaine Use Disorder (CUD). The crossover study will involve acute oral 
administration of two (2) doses of CLAV (250 mg/day; 500 mg/day); (low and medium ) and 
matched oral placebo in 12 (12 completers, 21 enrolled) healthy non- treatment seeking CUD 
adult subjects for each drug. The study is performed in an inpa tient medical unit (Centennial 6)

 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
5.1  Outcome Measures 
5.1.1  Primary Outcome Measures 
The primary outcome measures are adverse events and cardiovascular responses (HR, BP, ECG  
(QTc prolongation ). Safety and toleration as assessed by  [CONTACT_71434]  (250 mg, 500 mg, PBO) wi thin each subject .  
 5.1.2  Secondary Outcome Measures Secondary outcome measures are intended to determine if there are any changes in cocaine 
pharmacokinetics in the presence of clavul anic acid (250 mg, 500 mg) after acute dosing of 
 
Protocol Clavulanic Acid - Cocaine Interaction Study   9 
Version 2. 3 Date: February 2 2, 2018 CLAV.  The pharmacokinetics of clavulanic acid at 2 doses (250 mg, 500 mg) will be 
determined in non-treatment seeking adults with cocaine use disorder.  The pharmacodynamic effects of clavulanic acid in com bination with cocaine will be determined by [CONTACT_71435]’s pupil after the cocaine infusion.  
 
5.1.3  Exploratory Outcome Measures  
 
Exploratory outcome measures are intended to evaluate whether if there are any changes in the subjective effects of cocaine in the presence of clavulanic acid (250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg) after acute dosing of CLAV.  The subjective effects of clavulanic acid without cocaine in non-treatment seeking adults with cocaine use disorder will be assessed at all do ses (250  mg, 500 mg, 
750 mg).

craving and mood.  Summary statistics will be provided for all safety, tolerability and subjective data.  In addition to the analyses specified below, listings of all data for each patient will be provided. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Demographic and Baseline Comparability Analyses 
Demographic variables will be summarized for all for male and female patients.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary , Secondary , and Exploratory Analyses 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Primary Analyses: Safety is a primary assessment variabl e.  The number of patients 
reporting each AE by [CONTACT_71436].  Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_71437].   In addition, all adverse events (AE’s) noted during the study will be listed.  The listings will include each occurrence of the AE, when it was 
reported, the severity and the duration. Adverse event data will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_71424] (250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg) and placebo and presented as summary statistics by [CONTACT_34565]. Our primary analyses will compare the rates of occurrence of adverse events across the 
three -periods within each person. The data are gathered using a 3-period 3- treatment crossover 
design. Safety concerns constrain us to restrict the order of administration of the [ADDRESS_77560] three sequences: {PBO, Low (250 mg), Medium (500 mg)}, {Low, PBO, Medium}, and {Low, Medium, PBO}. One third of the subjects are randomized to each of these sequences. Each period is a 1 day session and the periods correspond to days 2, 3, and 4, providing 24 half- lives 
between administrations. The main explanatory variables in the mod els are: 1) a 3 level within -
 
Protocol Clavulanic Acid - Cocaine Interaction Study   10 
Version 2. 3 Date: February [ADDRESS_77561] factor representing drug condition (PBO, study drug low dose (SDlow), study drug 
medium dose (SD medium), and 2) a three level factor representing period (1, 2, and 3). We use 
standard mixed effects (repeated measures) A NOVA models for binary responses in three -period 
three -treatment crossover designs to test our hypotheses.[ADDRESS_77562] for differences in response across the three drug doses, and contrasts will determine the pattern of differences (if any). Mixed effects models can allow for different error variances for different sessions, and other complex error structures as needed. As this study has only three repeated measures, a relatively simple covariance structure model (e.g. heterogeneous compound symmetry model) should be sufficient to account for within- subject correlations.  
 Pharmacodynamic parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and QT
C interval, 
expressed as AUC, 2 -minute values and maximal value s) will be similarly analyzed.  The COC 
infusions occur on the day of each session, providing three repeated sets of measures of each COC related response ( change in HR, change in SBP, change in DBP, change in QT
c interval,).  
 HR and BP (systolic BP  (SBP)  and diastolic BP  (DBP )) and QT
C induced by [CONTACT_71438] C measurements before the cocaine infusion to assess 
change. BP and HR and QT C changes after infusion given after CLAV (250 mg, 500 mg, 750 
mg) will be c ompared to those without CLAV. We will compare the distribution of Area Under 
Curve (AUC) summaries of the within -period repeated measures of changes in vital signs (heart 
rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure) across the three-periods wi thin each 
person as described above.  QT
C interval measured by [CONTACT_71439] C 
interval before the cocaine infusion to assess change. QT C interval changes after infusion given 
after CLAV (250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg) will be compared to those without CLAV. We will compare the distribution of Area Under Curve (AUC) summaries of the within -period repeated 
measures of changes in QTc interval across the three- periods within each person as described 
above.  [IP_ADDRESS].2  Secondary Analyses: The pharmacokinetic parameters will be statistically analyzed using a repeated measure analysis of variance model.   
 [IP_ADDRESS].3  Exploratory Analyses:  Subjective effects of cocaine, as measured by [CONTACT_71440], visual analog an d rating scales, will be listed for each patient and summarized for each group . 
Adverse events for the CLAV 750 mg group will be analyzed as described above for the lower CLAV doses. Adverse events for the subset of subjects stabilized on Buprenorphine wil l be 
analyzed as described above.  
 
5.2.2  Secondary Outcome Measures Secondary outcome measures are intended to determine if there are any changes in cocaine 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the presence of clavulanic acid (250 mg, 500 mg).  The pharmacokinetics of clavulanic acid will be determined in non -treatment seeking adults with 
cocaine use disorder.  The COC infusions occur on the day of each session, providing four repeated sets of measures of each COC related response (PK, PD as determined  by [CONTACT_71441] - Cocaine Interaction Study   11 
Version 2. 3 Date: February 2 2, 2018 pupil diameter from baseline).  PK curves for single dose CLAV at 250 mg and 500 mg will be 
constructed for all subjects and then for men and women, separately.   
 
5.2.3 Exploratory Outcome Measures Data regarding CLAV’s effect on subjective effects and motivation for COC will be considered 
exploratory regarding efficacy, as subjects receive acute treatment.

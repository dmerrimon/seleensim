1.0  BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
Emotional distress in parents and their young child (ages 3- 8) with cancer during acute treatment is a 
prevalent, persistent problem associated with physical symptom distress and diminished quality of life 
and family function.1-7 In the longer term, this acute emotional distress is related to traumatic stress 
symptoms after treatment ends. As many as 58% of parents and 40% of childhood cancer survivors later report traumatic stress symptoms in the moderate to severe range.
1,2,8-[ADDRESS_860515] palliative 
care in many pediatric and adult hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]; however, few studies have examined mechanisms by [CONTACT_642910].
15-[ADDRESS_860516] young children cope with traumatic experiences.
19-27  
Based on Robb’s music therapy theoretical framework, we developed and tested the Active Music Engagement (AME) intervention, establishing it as a feasible/acceptable intervention that reduces emotional distress in young children hospi[INVESTIGATOR_642885].
24,25,[ADDRESS_860517] -led 
AME uses music -based play and parent education/support (music play resource kit; tip sheets). The 
AME builds on existing skills, minimizing the burden of learning new skills during a stressful time when learning can be less efficient.
29 As parents witness intervention benefits for their child and learn 
how to use normalizing play activities to help manage their child’s distress, traumatic reactions to and distressing memories of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_642886]. The AME is particularly viable because it is easy to implement and teaches parents/children how to therapeutically use a familiar activity to manage distress.  
As a palliative care intervention, the AME was developed to help manage distress and offer psychosocial support during acute cancer treatment. Three preliminary Active Music Engagement 
studies  were conducted by [CONTACT_37152]. Study 1  was a descriptive study conducted to 
measure the presence/absence of contextual support (i.e., structure, autonomy support, relationship support) in the environment and levels of child engagement across three conditions (usual care, AME, and audio- storybooks). Findings indicated that the AME intervention: 1) was theoretically 
aligned with Robb’s Contextual Support Model for Music Therapy (CSM -MT), and 2) engaged 
children significantly more than usual care or attention control conditions.
24  
Study 2 was a multi -site, non- randomized (sequential assignment) study that established 
feasibility/acceptability of a single- session, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led AME intervention and audio- storybooks as an 
attention control condition. In this study we examined two attention control conditions (music listening and audio- storybooks). Music listening did not demonstrate any significant behavioral benefits and 
was not well accepted by [CONTACT_3654]. In contrast, the audio- storybooks condition was acceptable to 
parents but did not demonstrate any significant behavioral benefits, validating it as the best control condition for our current study. In addition, children randomized to the AME intervention demonstrated significantly more engagement behaviors than children in the control conditi ons (i.e., 
the proximal mediator proposed in this trial) .
 25 
Study 3 was a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_642887], acceptability, and preliminary efficacy 
of a parent implemented AME. In this study we translated the AME into a parent -led intervention and 
added parent instruction/coaching. Findings indicated the intervention and design were feasible, highly acceptable, demonstrated significantly more child engagement and parent child interaction behaviors, and produced positive outcomes for children. However, although parents were able to deliver the intervention they expressed: 1) preference for more therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332214]/support during 
  scheduled sessions (i.e., therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led vs. parent -led sessions) in order to be more focused on their 
child; and 2) preference to have parent -led and/or child- initiated AME play between scheduled 
sessions. Parent interview data also supported child engagement, family normalcy, and parent self -
efficacy as important potential mediators of intervention effects. Based on these studies, our team 
has established the AME as beneficial in managing child distress, and we have created a theoretically 
sound conceptual framework proposing mechanisms of action responsible for change in our targeted outcomes.
[ADDRESS_860518] the 
mechanisms of action (proximal/distal mediators; moderators) proposed in our conceptual framework. 
We know from our prior studies that the proposed study design/procedures are feasible and 
acceptable, that the AME is theoretically aligned with the guiding conceptual framework, Robb’s 
CSM -MT, and have preliminary effect size data about the relationship of the AME to our proposed 
proximal/distal mediators and outcomes.  
2.0. OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS 
The objectives  of this two group randomized controlled trial is to identify behavioral, sociological, and 
psychological variables contributing to positive outcomes observed in previous AME studies (i.e., mediators) and identify for whom the intervention works (i.e., moderators). We will examine proximal 
mediators of child engagement and parent -child interaction and distal mediators of perceived family 
normalcy, parent confidence (self -efficacy) about their ability to support their child during treatment, 
and independent parent/child use of music play to manage distress during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. We hypothesize that these factors mediate change in outcomes of child emotional distress, physical symptom distress, and quality of life; parent emotional/traumatic distress and quality of life; and family function.
24,25,28,30 Published literature and our parent interview data support the proposed mechanisms 
of action; therefore, a mechanistic study of mediators and moderators of intervention effects is t he 
next logical step.28 In some instances we will consent the child’s caregiver if they are currently 
fulfilling the role of the parent . Specific aims and hypotheses are to:   
Aim 1: Examine the effects of proximal and distal mediators of the Active Music Engagement (AME) intervention on outcomes for young children with cancer and parents.  
Hypothesis 1.1: Child engagement and parent -child interaction (proximal mediators) will mediate the 
effect of AME on perceived family normalcy, parent self -efficacy, and independent parent/child use of 
music play.  
Hypothesis 1.2: Perceived family normalcy, parent self -efficacy, and independent parent/child use of 
music play (distal mediators)  will mediate the effect of AME on child outcomes (emotional distress, 
quality of life), parent outcomes (emotional distress, traumatic distress, quality of life), and family function immediately post -intervention (Time 2) and [ADDRESS_860519] -intervention (Time 3).  
Aim 2: Examine moderators of the AME intervention on outcomes for young child and parent distress.  
Hypothesis 2.1:  Child and parent distress with prior hospi[INVESTIGATOR_642888]/traumatic distress outcomes at Time 2 and Time 3.  
Aim 3 (Exploratory): Explore child physical symptom distress in mediation and moderation models.  
Hypothesis 3.1: Compared to attention control, children in the AME group will report les s physical 
symptom distress (pain, fatigue, nausea) at Time 2 and Time 3.  
Hypothesis 3.2: Perceived family normalcy, parent self -efficacy, and independent parent/child use of 
music play (distal mediators) will mediate the effect of AME on child physical symptom distress at Time 2 and Time 3.  
  Hypothesis 3.3:  Child and parent distress with prior hospi[INVESTIGATOR_642889] [ADDRESS_860520] across repeated 
admissions to manage distress and prevent traumatic stress symptoms in survivorship.  
3.0. SAMPLE ELIGIBLITY CRITERIA  
Child/Parent Inclusion Criteria and Rationale: Children and parents /caregivers  will be eligible if:  1) 
the child is 3 – 8 years of age at time of enrollment (intervention content is not age- appropriate for 
other children); 2) patients with an expected treatment course of at least 3 days to receive moderate 
to high intensity chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy e ither in -patient or outpatient  (children 
receiving chemotherapy are at risk for high symptom distress; 3 -day treatment course is required to 
deliver study conditions and contributes to sample homogeneity);  and 3) one parent /caregiver  (>18 
years of age) can be present for all sessions (study targets both child and parent /caregiver ). 
Child/Parent Exclusion Criteria and Rationale: Children and parents /caregivers  will be excluded if:  
1) the child and/or parent /caregiver  do not speak English or 2) the child has a significant cognitive 
impairment that might  hinder participation (determination made in consultation with attending 
physician, oncologist, and parents).   
Sample Size.  We will recruit a total sample size of 184 child  and parent/caregiver  dyads (368 total) 
and assume 15% attrition in order to retain 156 child and parent/caregiver  dyads (78 dyads/group) at 
Time 3.  
4.0. PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT AND ENROLLMENT  
Procedures mirror successful strategies used in Preliminary  Study 3, and our current R01 music 
intervention study for adolescents/young adults undergoing high risk cancer treatment and their parent.  
Recruitment & Informed Consent. The recruitment and informed consent procedures will preserve 
participants' right to refuse and guarantees that potential subjects who refuse will not be known to the research team. Children and parents /caregivers  will be recruited from Riley Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7722],  
Children’s Mercy Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta , and University of [LOCATION_007] MD Anderson 
Cancer Center  during clinic visits. As with our previous and current studies, the hematology/oncology 
coordinators, who will not be employed on the study, will identify potentially eligible parents / 
caregivers and children using an eligibility checklist. The coordinators then meet with potentially 
eligible parents/children to provide an initial study introduction, verify eligibility, and provide a study brochure. After the coordinators gain parent/patient approval, the coordinators will contact [CONTACT_74143]/PI [INVESTIGATOR_642890]/patient. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_642891]/parent, explain the study, randomization procedures, intervention schedule, and assess willingness to participate. Written parent /caregiver  consent for self and their child, and assent 
for children > 6 years will be obtained, following the requirements of the human subjects review committee. The hematology/oncology coordinators are nurses who are trained and employed to enroll children/parents on clinical trials for their respective programs. We have worked closely with them on our previous and current studies with great success.  
Data Collection & Randomization Procedures. Following consent, the project manager will arrange a time for parents /caregivers  to complete baseline (T1) measures during a routine clinic visit, prior to 
their next scheduled chemotherapy admission. A trained evaluator will administer measures in a quiet/private setting and remain available for questions. The child/ parent or caregiver dyad will then 
be stratified by [CONTACT_11491] (preschoolers 3- 5 years; school -agers 6- 8 years) and randomized in blocks 
of six to the AME or attention control condition by [CONTACT_91724]. After the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] p roject manager from 
the enrolling site receives randomization status from our study statistician, she will inform the parent/child of their randomization status and will then immediately schedule Session 1. Only the 
  project manager, PI, statistician, and intervener will know the child/parent dyad’s randomization 
status. Evaluators will be blinded.  
All study condition sessions will be video recorded to facilitate collection of child engagement and parent -child interaction data and monitor treatment fidelity.  Sessions 1 and 2 are video recorded to 
desensitize children/parents to video recording; only Session [ADDRESS_860521] participant accrual.  An evaluator, blind to randomization status, will administer T2 measures after Session 3. Evaluators will administer T3 measures 30 days  (+/- 7 days)  post-intervention during a subsequent clinic visit or by [CONTACT_756]. 
Parent self -reports will be used to monitor use of study condition activities between sessions and 
between T2 and T3 data collections (Appendix 1).   
5.0. RESEARCH DESIGN, METHODS, AND PROCEDURES  
Conceptual Framework. Our conceptual framework (Figure 1) is based on Robb’s Contextual Support Model of Music Therapy
24,30 and further informed by [CONTACT_642911]’s Pediatric Medical Traumatic 
Stress Model,4 which provides a useful heuristic for understanding short and long- term consequences 
of pediatric cancer treatment for parents and their child. In our conceptual framework, re curring 
events related to cancer treatment (i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], procedures) are viewed as potentially traumatic events. Parent appraisal of events as traumatic or not traumatic is influenced by [CONTACT_094]-existing factors, which serve as antecedents  in our st udy.   
Published research indicates that higher parent and child distress during cancer treatment and survivorship is related to: 1) demographics (younger child/parent age, female parent gender, and lower socio -economic status/education),
36,37 2) higher parent/child distress with prior hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 
and greater traumatic stress symptoms,1,2,38  and 3) disease and treatment characteristics (diagnosis, 
relapsed disease, greater treatment intensity).5,10,12,13,39 
 
The AME directly targets the proximal mediators  of child engagement and parent -child interaction,24,28 
as well as distal mediators  of perceived family normalcy,40 parent confidence (self -efficacy) about 
their ability to support their child during treatment,[ADDRESS_860522] -
led sessions.  

  Our study examines proximal and distal mediators of the AME on outcomes for young children 
(emotional distress, physical symptom distress (exploratory), quality of life), parents (emotional 
distress, traumatic distress, quality of life), and family function. In addition, we examine moderators of the AME intervention on outcomes (child/parent distress with prior hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; child age). This study will allow us to determine how  and for whom  the intervention works, informing a subsequent 
trial to examine cumulative impact/efficacy of AME across repeated cancer treatment admissions to manage distress and prevent traumatic stress symptoms in survivorship. Findings will also have implications for use of the CSM -MT to guide development of active music interventions to manage 
treatment distress in other populations.  
Study Desi gn. This is a two -group, randomized, controlled trial. Children and one parent will be 
stratified and randomized in blocks of six to the AME intervention or attention control condition (see Study Schema). Child/parent dyads will be stratified by [CONTACT_11491] (preschoolers 3- 5 yrs; school -agers 
6-8 yrs). Both conditions are standardized and each group will receive three 45- minute sessions over 
[ADDRESS_860523] 
that 1) a usual care condition would likely have high attrition and negatively affect study accrual, and 2) our audio-storybooks low dose condition was acceptable without behavioral benefits. Thus, we will use audio- storybooks as 
our attention control condition. The number of sessions and amount of contact [CONTACT_642912] -term ([ADDRESS_860524] -
intervention)  benefit.
24,25,28  
As in our preliminary studies, baseline data (Time 1) will be collected after consent. Time [ADDRESS_860525] -Session 3. Parents/children are encouraged to 
use AME and low dose audio- storybooks activities between sessions and at home following 
discharge and self -reported frequency and duration of activities will be collected during sessions 2 
and 3, and at T3 ([ADDRESS_860526] -intervention). Data collection timelines are based on positive findings 
from our preliminary studies and inform our primary aims which examine mediation. Findings will inform a subsequent trial to examine long term benefi ts. See Study Schema for assessment 
timelines . 
Setting.  Young children (ages 3- 8 years) and their parents will be recruited from three children’s  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] . These hospi[INVESTIGATOR_642892]. All three sites 
are members of the Children’s Oncology Group, which treats similar types of cancer diagnoses with similar therapeutic protocols. The inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_642893]/oncology clinic 
will be used for delivery of intervention and attention control conditions; data collection will occur both in the clinic and in- patient setting. All sites have verified availability of dedicated, private space for 
these activities.  
Study Procedures.  Procedures mirror successful strategies used in Preliminary Study 3, and our 
current R01 music intervention study for adolescents/young adults undergoing high risk cancer treatment and their parent.  

  Recruitment & Consent.  Children/parents will be recruited during a clinic visit. As with our 
previous/current studies, certified research coordinators will use the eligibility checklist to identify 
potential participants and notify the project manager . The project manager will then contact [CONTACT_197503]/parent, explain the study, and if they are interested, obtain written parent consent for themselves and their child and assent for children > 6 years, following human subjects review committee requirements.  
Data Collection & Randomization Procedures. Following consent, the project manager will arrange a time for parents to complete baseline (T1) measures during a routine clinic visit, prior to their next 
scheduled chemotherapy admission. A trained evaluator will administer measures in a quiet/private 
setting and remain available for questions. The child/parent dyad will then be stratified by [CONTACT_11491] (preschoolers 3- 5 years; school -agers 6- 8 years) and randomized in blocks of six to the AME or 
attention control condition by [CONTACT_91724]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_642894] 1. Only the project manager, PI, statistician, and intervener will know the child/parent dyad’s randomization status. Evaluators will be blinded.  
All study condition sessions will be  video recorded to facilitate collection of child engagement and 
parent -child interaction data and monitor treatment fidelity. Sessions 1 and 2 are video recorded to 
desensitize children/parents to video recording; only Session [ADDRESS_860527] participant accrual.  An evaluator, blind to randomization status, will administer T2 measures after Session 3. Evaluators will administer T3 measures 30 days (+/ - 7 days)  post-intervention during a subsequent clinic visit or by [CONTACT_756]. 
Parent self -reports will be used to monitor use of study condition activities between sessions and 
between T2 and T3 data collections (Appendix 1).   
Study Condition Procedures. Consistent  with our other studies, we train music therapi[INVESTIGATOR_642895]. Risk for experimental drift, bias, and diffusion will be addressed through four quality 
assurance monitoring procedures established in our previous trials.
56 Children/parents randomly 
assigned to AME or attention control receive the same length of sessions (45 min.) and timing of 
contact (3 sessions, 3 consecutive days). Session 1 will occur within 24 hours of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].   
Usual care at all three sites.  Across all sites, chemotherapy is administered according to Children’s 
Oncology Group protocol guidelines, ensuring consistency of treatment. Antiemetic regimens are similar across sites and tailored to patient -specific needs. We will document patient medications at 
baseline, during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (T2), and [ADDRESS_860528] -intervention (T3) and control for site in all 
analytic models.   
Procedures.  Following consent, the project manager will arrange a time for the parent to complete 
baseline measures during a routine clinic visit, prior to their next scheduled chemotherapy admission. Baseline measures will be completed in a private room in the outpatient clinic. A trained evaluator will administer the baseline measures and remain available for questions during measurement completion. The evaluator will immediately notify the project manager that baseline measures are completed. The child/parent dyad will then be randomly assigned to the AME or the attention control condition by [CONTACT_4305]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_642896]/parent of their randomization status and schedule their first session with the intervener. Only the project manager, PI, statistician, and intervener will know the child/parent’s randomization status.  
AME Intervention.  Parents/children randomly assigned to the AME intervention receive three, 45-
minute sessions with the music therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], delivered daily, for [ADDRESS_860529] (MT- BC) who tailors music -based play experiences to encourage 
active engagement in and independent use of music play as a strategy to manage distress. During 
AME sessions, the music therapi[INVESTIGATOR_642897]/parents repeated opportunities to experience competence, autonomy, and meaningful interactions through music -based play activities, and 
  provides support/education about ways music play can be used to manage distress and sustain a 
sense of family normalcy while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_642898].  
There are three components to the AME intervention: 1) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led music -based play activities and 
sessions, 2) the music play resource kit (to promote independent music play), and 3) tip sheets for parent education and support that focus on why music play, how to use music play during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and how to use music play during transition from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21104]. During each session, the music therapi[INVESTIGATOR_642899] a 5 minute introduction/assessment period, followed by a 30 minute music play session, and closes with a 10 minutes of parent education and tailored suggestions for using music play outside sessions.  
The child/parent also receive a music play resource kit to use during and between therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -led 
sessions. The kit includes: 1) a professional CD recording of music composed and/or arranged 
specifically for t his project, 2) age- appropriate musical instruments and play materials that correspond 
with each activity, and 3) activity cards designed to give children/parents at -a-glance information on 
ways they can use their kit. Universal precautions and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_642900], compact disc recordings, music play resource kits, and other study materials. Children receive their own music play resource kit to keep both during and after study completion.  
Attention Control (Audio- storybooks).  Parents/children randomly assigned to the audio- storybooks 
attention control condition will have the same length of sessions (45 minutes) and timing of contact (3 sessions, 3 consecutive days) as the AME intervention group. Session 1 is delivered within 24 hours 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. The audio- storybooks (ASB) condition is designed to control for attention from 
an intervener, shared parent -child experiences, and audio- visual stimulation. It offers parents/children 
opportunities  to make choices and engage in an age- appropriate, non- music -based play activity. In 
each session children/parents will choose and listen to one of two illustrated children’s books with audio- taped narration. Children/parents receive a kit that includes [ADDRESS_860530] disc recordings, audio- storybooks kit, and other study materials. Children receive 
their own audio- storybooks kit to keep both during and after study completion.  
All study condition sessions will be video recorded to facilitate collection of behavioral outcome data and monitor treatment fidelity. Sessions 1 and 2 are video recorded to desensitize children/parents to video recording; only Session [ADDRESS_860531] participant accrual or cause distress. An evaluator, blind to randomization status, will administer T2 measures after Session 3. Evaluators administer T3 measures 30 days (+/ - 7 days) post -intervention during a subsequent clinic visit or by [CONTACT_756]. All 
evaluation sessions are audio- recorded to monitor evaluation fidelity.  
Treatment Fidelity Strategies. Our team developed and published treatment fidelity strategies 
consistent with NIH Treatment Fidelity Workgroup recommendations to ensure treatment integrity, minimize experimental drift, and minimize contamination of the control group.
56,57 Strategies include: 
1) standardized intervention and control condition protocols, study manuals, and training; 2) self - and 
external monitoring of video- recorded intervention/attention control sessions; 3) self - and external 
monitoring of audio- recorded evaluation sessions;  4) quality assurance checklists to track protocol 
deviations; 5) intervener field notes to document duration and  frequency (dose), and uptake of study 
conditions; 6) separate intervener/evaluator conference calls; and 7) weekly study administration 
team meetings to address any concerns.  
Sources of Materials . All data will be collected solely for the purposes of this study. Parents will 
complete a set of study measures three times (baseline, post -session 3, and 30- days post -session 3).  
We estimate it will take the parent 30 – 45 minutes to complete measures.  
All measures will be completed using paper/pencil administration. Once parents complete a set of measures our evaluators will directly enter data into RedCap, a HIPAA compliant web- based data 
  manageme nt system. Paper measures will be secured in a locked cabinet, in a locked office 
dedicated to our study.  
Medical information will be obtained from chart reviews, relevant to diagnosis and treatments. These 
data will be obtained by [CONTACT_642913], all of whom are Children’s Oncology Group Certified Research Associates.  
Field notes on intervention and evaluation sessions will be completed by [CONTACT_642914][INVESTIGATOR_642901] a password protected computers that are connected to a secure web- based server.  
All study related materials and forms are stored on HIPAA compliant encrypted data management server.  
All intervention and attention control sessions will be video recorded, and all evaluation sessions audio recorded to facilitate collection of behavioral outcome data and to monitor fidelity.  
A listing of specific measures can be found in Section B and in Appendix [ADDRESS_860532] identities; all raw data, including digital audio and video data will be stored according to Indiana University IRB requirements.  
Potential Risks. Risks to child/parent participants are considered minimal and include: 1) breach of 
confidentiality; 2) increased fatigue for the child or parent as a result of participating in study session activities or completing measures; and 3) psychological discomfort for the parent when responding to evaluation questions.  
Protection Against Risk  
Confidentiality. To minimize the possibility that a breach in confidentiality will occur, data for this 
study will be kept separate from any subject identifiers and will be kept in a locked file cabinet and on 
a secure, encrypted data management server. Digital audio and video recordings of child/parent participation in study sessions will also be uploaded on a secure, password protected computer server that is backed up by [CONTACT_77842]’s main computer system. Only the PI, Co- I, PM, and 
designated research assistants will  have access to the data. Computers where data will be entered 
will be accessed through passwords and kept in locked offices. Data monitoring will occur in three stages: 1) field editing for missing data by [CONTACT_642915]; 2) office editing by a designated res earch 
assistant after instruments are returned to the office; and 3) listening to random samples of 25% of the audio- taped evaluation sessions and video- taped intervention sessions by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_12749]- I.  
Fatigue. Interveners and evaluators will be trained to observe for increasing fatigue and ask parents’ 
to indicate if the child’s or their own fatigue is at a level where the activity should be stopped. Also, intervention sessions or control condition sessions, and evaluations will be stopped if the intervener  
or evaluator assesses a level of fatigue in the child or parent that precludes their ability to participate. Children and parents will be informed they can stop the session at any time and/or stop their involvement in the study at any time.  
Psychological  Discomfort. Interveners and evaluators will receive specific training in identifying and 
responding to psychological discomfort related to group assignment and to evaluation. Parents and children will be informed they can stop the session at any time and/or stop their involvement in the study if they become uncomfortable. Should psychological discomfort be identified, a protocol will be in place to notify the PI. The attending oncologist and nurse on the unit will also be notified of the concern in order to make a decision regarding referral. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_642902] 24 hours on decisions made. Should any child give any indication the level of psychological distress is at a level of danger to self or others, the child’s parent and attending oncologist will be immediately consulted to arrange an evaluation at Riley Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Indianapolis site), Children’s Mercy Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(Kansas City site), Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta (Atlanta site), or University of [LOCATION_007] MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston site)  unless the parent indicates a preference for treatment elsewhere. In the 
event that a parent is judged to be a danger to self or others, the child’s primary care oncologist will be consulted to arrange an evaluation, unless the parent indicates a preference for treatment 
  elsewhere. Again, parents and children will be informed they can stop the session at any time and/or 
stop their involvement in the study at any time.

7.0. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
As part of Preliminary Study 3,  we have already created and successfully implemented a secure web-
based system to capture the study data using the REDCap database management system, as well as a telephone log system and participant calendar that will enable the research coordinators to track and schedule participants’ visits. We will review and process data using already -programmed multiple 
verification and edit -checking programs. We will also conduct rudimentary analyses to ensure that the 
data have been properly collected and to identify any outliers or errors.    
Preliminary analyses :  Prior to hypothesis testing, we will calculate coefficient alpha as a measure of 
internal consistency reliability on all multiple -item scales.  Construct validity will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_642917]. We will assess multicollinearity between the scales for the mediators by [CONTACT_642918]. If any pairwise correlations are 0.[ADDRESS_860533] to demographic and baseline outcome variables using two- sample t tests, chi -square tests, or Fisher ’s 
  Exact tests as appropriate.  We will control for any demographic variables that are not balanced in the 
models below (all models will adjust for baseline outcome). We will also control for site in all models.  
Main analyses :  For analyses below we will analyze as randomized and attempt to collect outcome 
data on non- completers, following the intent -to-treat principle.  For Aims 1 and 2, each outcome will 
be modeled separately. Also we will model T2 separately from T3. Thus, there will be a total of 12 models in Aim 1 (6 outcomes x two time points).  In Aim 2, two outcomes will be examined and 3 potential moderators at two time points for a total of 12 (2 outcomes x 3 moderators x 2 time points) models. For Aim 1, our primary goal is to test mediation effects.  Mediation effects will be estimated in 
an ANCOVA setting, fitting the appropriate mediation models using MPlus
[ADDRESS_860534] 6 key predictors (intervention, two proximal mediators, 3 distal mediators), and control for T1, age  (3- 5 years vs. 6 -8 years), site, and any imbalanced baseline covariates found 
above (allowing for up to 6 imbalances).  Thus we will have up to [ADDRESS_860535] moderation effects by [CONTACT_642919] (dichotomized at the median) with the intervention indicator (AME vs. attention control) in our models. For all models in Aims 1 and 2, we will assess goodness -of-fit (GOF ) using standard 
GOF measures (comparative fit index, root mean square error of approximation, and root mean square residual). For Aim 3, an exploratory aim, we will use ANCOVA to compare changes in child symptom distress at T2 and T3 between intervention and control groups. In light of positive findings, we next will explore models as in Aims 1 and 2 to assess for potential mediation and moderation effects for this outcome.  
Missing data and multiple comparisons :  We will compare all baseline variables between subjects 
who drop out of the study and those who do not using two- sample t tests, chi -square tests, or their 
non-parametric equivalents as appropriate. MPLUS software will incorporate participants who drop 
out before completion by [CONTACT_642920] a bias adjustment for 
missing data under maximum likelihood estimation and the assumption that data are missing at random. If we find that missing data are not missing at random, we will use a pattern mixture modeling approach to address; however, based on our prior studies we expect limited attrition (<15%) and little to no missing data on instruments (<1%). As our primary outcomes are child (CHQ) and parent emotional/traumatic (POMS) distress and other outcomes are considered secondary, we do not plan on adjusting p  value for multiple comparisons for the primary outcomes but will apply the 
Hochberg step- up procedure for the secondary outcomes.

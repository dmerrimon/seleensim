M ethodology:
This is a Phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging
stud y in subjects undergoing p rimar y unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) under general or spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227].
Note: Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606376].
On Day 1, eligible subjects will be randomized to receive a single dose of study drug administered in a blinded
manner within [ADDRESS_803275] and hep-locked (see “Postsur gical Rescue Medication” belo w).
Additionally, a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump will be established prior to the completion of the
surgery. The PCA pump will not be loadedat thistime . The use of fentanyl will be permitted during surgery.
However, intraoperative administration of morphine or any other analgesics (including intrathecal opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]), local
anesthetics, or anti-inflammatory agents is prohibited, unless needed to treat an adverse event (AE).
All subjects will be required to remain in the study site for a minimum of [ADDRESS_803276] in order to prevent
falls (e.g., use of support devices during ambulation, such as a knee immobilizer and walker/crutches), as needed.

Methodology (Cont) :
Part 1
During Part 1 of the study, approximately 100 subjects (25 per treatment arm) will be randomized to receive a
single dose injection femoral nerve block with either one of three doses of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (67, 133, or
266 mg) or placebo in [ADDRESS_803278] the results from the following assessments conducted during Part 1:
(1) the area under the curve (AUC) of the numeric rating scale (NRS) at rest (NRS-R) pain intensity scores
through 72 hours; (2) total postsurgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]; (3) the time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_265388]; and (4) safety
data. Based on a clinical evaluation of the data, the committee will determine the apparent efficacy and safety of
each of the three liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606377] a dose level for Part 2 of the study.
Statistical significance will not be required in order to recommend a dose level for Part 2. The unblinded dose
selection committee also will recommend whether the sample size for Part 2 should be increased.
Part 2
In Part 2 of the study, approximately 180 subjects (randomized 1:1, resulting in approximately 90 liposome
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606378] 90 placebo subjects) will receive a single dose injection femoral nerve block with the
selected dose level of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (i.e., 67, 133, or 266 mg) or placebo in [ADDRESS_803279] rescue medication will be intravenous (IV) hydromorphone 0.5 mg, which will be administered once via
bolus only. At this time, the PCA should be loaded with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (morphine or hydromorphone only).
The second rescue medication will be an on-demand PCA-administered opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (morphine or hydromorphone).
The PCA pump will be programmed to deliver either on-demand morphine or on-demand hydromorphone
boluses at a dose and lockout interval in accordance with the site's standard practice. A continuous infusion
(background or basal rate) of morphine or hydromorphone is not permitted. If the subject’s pain is excessive or
pain control is inadequate, then the bolus dose may be adjusted according to local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338310]; however,
adding a basal rate is prohibited. Once a subject is tolerating oral (PO) medication, PO immediate-release
oxycodone may be administered (but not more than 10 mg every 4 hours).
If a subject’s pain is inadequately controlled by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_2438], a third rescue medication consisting of conventional
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606379] a concentration of 0.125% (1.25 mg/mL) at a rate of 8 mL per hour for up to 12 hours may be
administered via the previously placed femoral nerve catheter.
Subjects who do not achieve adequate pain relief with this regimen will be withdrawn from the study and
followed for AEs only. No other analgesic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs),
are allowed during the 72-hour observation period or until the subject is withdrawn from the study, whichever is
sooner.

Methodology (Cont.)
Postsurgical Assessments: Postsurgical assessments will include pain intensity scores using the 0-10 point
NRS-R and NRS with activity (NRS-A) (where the prescribed activity is active knee flexion up to 45 degrees)
(seeAppendix 1 ); use of supplemental opi[INVESTIGATOR_22388]; neurological assessment (see Appendix 2 );
cardiac assessment (i.e., ECG recordings); sensory function assessment (i.e., cold test); motor function
assessment (i.e., 20-meter walk test); vital signs; overall benefit of analgesia score (OBAS) questionnaire
(seeAppendix 3 ); subject satisfaction with postsurgical pain control (see Appendix 4 ); physician satisfaction
with return of sensory/motor function (see Appendix 5 ); and an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related AE questionnaire during Part 1
only (see Appendix 6 ). Adverse events will be recorded through Day 30. If a cardiac or neurological event
occurs during Part 1 or Part 2 of the study that the Investigator believes may be associated with high levels of
systemic bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], an unscheduled PK blood sample should be collected at the time that the event is noted.
Safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted at pre-specified time points afterthe end of surgery (defined as
the time of the last suture/staple).
A follow-up visit will be scheduled for all subjects on Day 30.
Pharmacokinetic Assessments (Part 1 only): Blood samples for PK analysis will be obtained from subjects at
specific sites during Part [ADDRESS_803281] is not yet in surgery or is still in surgery. Placebo samples will be collected to maintain the
treatment double-blind but will not be analyzed. Samples from subjects receiving bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606380]. (Note: At time points when the PK and NRS pain intensity assessments coincide, the NRS
pain intensity assessments will be conducted before the blood draw.)
Number of Subjects (Planned):
Approximately 280 subjects are planned for enrollment in this study: 100 subjects (25 per treatment arm) in
Part 1 and 180 subjects (approximately 90 liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606378] 90 placebo subjects) in Part 2.
The number of subjects in Part 2 may be increased after review of the Part 1 data.

7.1. Indication
Liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338321] a single dose administration
without the use of indwelling catheters and to decrease the requirement for supplemental opi[INVESTIGATOR_338322]. It is indicated for use as an analgesic injected into the surgical site for postsurgical
pain relief. This study will explore the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of
liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338336] a femoral nerve block.
Effective postsurgical pain control is a critical element in subject recovery following surgery,
as the majority of subjects may experience significant pain, particularly in the first few days.
Improved postsurgical pain management contributes to better healing, faster subject
mobilization, shortened hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], and reduced healthcare costs ( American Society of
Anesthesiologists Task Force on Pain Management 1995).
7.2. EXPAREL (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40469])
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40501]-acting local anesthetics, but even so it has a limited duration of
action after local administration, usually reported as less than 8 hours. EXPAREL®(Pacira
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Diego, [LOCATION_004]) is a bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40469].
It consists of microscopic spherical, multivesicular liposomes (DepoFoam®drug delivery
system), organized in a honeycomb-like structure comprising numerous non-concentric internal
aqueous chambers containing a bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40502] a concentration of 13.3 mg/mL. Each
chamber is separated from adjacent chambers by [CONTACT_40562]. The lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805],
cholesterol, and triglycerides) are naturally occurring or close analogs of endogenous lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_482754] a complex mechanism involving
reorganization of the barrier lipid membranes and subsequent diffusion of the drug over an
extended period of time. A small amount of extra-liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (i.e., not bound within
the DepoFoam particles) enables liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606387] a similar onset of action to
standard bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].
EXPAREL (liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) was approved by [CONTACT_40563] 2011 for administration into
the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia. The active ingredient (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) and
inactive ingredient (DepoFoam) of EXPAREL are each contained, though separately, in
FDA-approved products:
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338325], a well-characterized anesthetic/analgesic, with more than
35 years of use in the US.
DepoFoam, a liposomal extended-release formulation contained in the marketed products
DepoCyt®(1999) and DepoDur®(2004). The form of DepoFoam used in each of the
three products – DepoCyt, DepoDur, and liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] – has a slightly different
mixture of lipid components. However, unlike the other two products, EXPAREL
employs a novel lipid excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (dierucoylphosphatidylcholine [DEPC]) in its
formulation.

CONFIDENTIAL 19 April [ZIP_CODE].3. Summary of Human Experience with Liposome Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338326] 21 clinical studies and 1 observational follow-up study to investigate
liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. Across these studies, over 1300 human subjects received liposome
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338327] 9 mg to 665 mg administered by [CONTACT_40564]: local
infiltration into the surgical wound, subcutaneous, perineural, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]. The product
generally has been well tolerated and in active comparator studies reported adverse events
(AEs) occurred at a similar rate as the corresponding bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40504].
Two nerve block studies have been completed. SKY0402-002 was a Phase 1 dose escalation
study conducted to evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of liposome
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. A total of 37 healthy subjects were administered liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338328] (24 subjects received liposome
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] 12 subjects received bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]). The incidence and types of adverse
events experienced were similar across treatment groups. All AEs were mild or moderate in
severity; those related to liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338329]. There were no serious
adverse events (SAEs), deaths, or discontinuations due to adverse events.
SKY0402-C-203 was a Phase 2 nerve block study was performed in which three doses of
liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (155, 199, and 310 mg) were compared to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] (125 mg) in
a bunionectomy. A total of 38 patients received liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. Liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606388]
72 hours; a PK curve also was defined.
In doses up to [ADDRESS_803316] nature of the efficacy results in both pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491] (SKY0402-C-316 and SKY0402-
C-317) was demonstrated across subgroups of patients with various prognostic features and
across demographic subgroups.
Following the NDA submission of EXPAREL (liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]), numerous clinical
studies were initiated in which liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606389] (including infiltration into the transversus abdominis plane [TAP] and
intraoperative wound infiltration or instillation); final results are not available at this time.
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information regarding the completed
studies. Please see the EXPAREL Full US Prescribing Information for safety information

CONFIDENTIAL 19 April [ZIP_CODE]. STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN
9.1. Study Design
This is a Phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled,
dose-ranging study in subjects undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA)
under general or spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227]. Note: Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606376].
On Day 1, eligible subjects will be randomized to receive a single dose of study drug
administered within 2 hours prior to the surgical procedure as a femoral nerve block. Study drug
administration will be performed in a blinded manner (see Section 11.5.1). At the conclusion of
t
he block, a femoral nerve catheter is to be left in place and hep-locked (see “Postsurgical Rescue
Medication” below). Additionally, a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump will be
established prior to the completion of the surgery. ThePCApump will notbeloaded at this time .
The use of fentanyl will be permitted during surgery. However, intraoperative administration of
morphine or an y other analgesics (including intrathecal opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]), local anesthetics, or anti-
inflammatory agents is prohibited, unless needed to treat an AE.
All subjects will be required to remain in the study site for a minimum of [ADDRESS_803318] in order to prevent falls (e.g., use of support devices during ambulation, such as a
knee immobilizer and walker/crutches) as needed.
Part 1
During Part 1 of the study, approximately 100 subjects (25 per treatment arm) will be
randomized to receive a single dose injection femoral nerve block with either one of three doses
of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (67, 133, or 266 mg) or placebo in [ADDRESS_803319] the results from the
following assessments conducted during Part 1: (1) the area under the curve (AUC) of the
numeric rating scale (NRS) at rest (NRS-R) pain intensity scores through 72 hours; (2) total
postsurgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]; (3) the time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_265388]; and (4) safety data. Based
on a clinical evaluation of the results the committee will determine the apparent efficacy and
safety of each of the three liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606377] a dose
level for Part 2 of the study. Statistical significance will not be required in order to recommend a
dose level for Part 2. The unblinded dose selection committee also will recommend whether the
sample size for Part 2 should be increased.
Part 2
In Part 2 of the study, approximately 180 subjects (randomized 1:1, resulting in approximately
90 liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606378] 90 placebo subjects) will receive a single dose injection
femoral nerve block with the selected dose of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (i.e., 67, 133, or 266 mg) or
placebo in 20 mL under ultrasound guidance.

Liposome Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606385]. 040-[ZIP_CODE].006 28 of 71 PCDOC #[ADDRESS_803320] Rescue Medication (IV Hydromorphone)
The first rescue medication will be intravenous (IV) hydromorphone 0.5 mg, which will be
administered once via bolus only. At this time, the PCA should be loaded with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (morphine
or hydromorphone only).
Second Rescue Medication (PCA and/or PO Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480])
The second rescue medication will be an on-demand PCA-administered opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (morphine or
hydromorphone). The PCA pump will be programmed to deliver either on-demand morphine or
on-demand hydromorphone boluses at a dose and lockout interval in accordance with the site's
standard practice. A continuous infusion (background or basal rate) of morphine or
hydromorphone is not permitted. If the subject’s pain is excessive or pain control is inadequate,
then the bolus dose may be adjusted according to local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338310]; however, adding a
basal rate is prohibited .
Once a subject is able to tolerate oral (PO) medication, PO immediate-release oxycodone may be
administered (but not more than 10 mg every 4 hours).
Third Rescue Medication (Conventional Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974])
If a subject’s pain is inadequately controlled by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_2438], a third rescue, a femoral nerve block,
consisting of conventional bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606379] a concentration of 0.125% (1.25 mg/mL) at a rate
of 8 mL per hour for up to 12 hours may be administered via the previously placed femoral nerve
catheter.
Subjects who do not receive adequate pain control with this regimen are to be withdrawn from
the study and followed for AEs only. No other analgesic agents, including non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), are allowed during the 72-hour observation period.
Postsurgical Assessments
Postsurgical assessments will include pain intensity scores using the 0-10 point NRS-R and
NRS with activity (NRS-A) (where the prescribed activity is active knee flexion up to
45 degrees) (see Appendix 1); use of supplemental opi[INVESTIGATOR_22388]; neurological
assessment (see Appendix 2); cardiac assessment [i.e., ECG recordings]; sensory function
assessment [i.e., cold test]; motor function assessment [i.e., 20-meter walk test]; vital signs;
overall benefit of analgesia score (OBAS) questionnaire (see Appendix 3); subject satisfaction
with postsurgical pain control (see Appendix 4); physician satisfaction with return of
sensory/motor function (see Appendix 5); and an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related AE questionnaire during Part 1
only (see Appendix 6). Adverse events will be recorded through Day 30. If a cardiac or
neurological event occurs during Part 1 or Part 2 of the study that the Investigator believes may
be associated with high levels of systemic bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], an unscheduled PK blood sample should
be collected at the time that the event is noted.
Safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted at pre-specified time points after theend of
surgery (defined as the time of last suture/staple). A follow-up visit will be scheduled for all
subjects on Day 30.

appropriate regulatory authorities and notified the Investigator(s).
9.2. Discussion of Study Design
Liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338334] a surgical wound. This multicenter,
randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study is a comparison of the efficacy and safety of
liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606393] a femoral nerve block in subjects
undergoing unilateral TKA. The double blind study design is intended to avoid potential bias
resulting from subject or Investigator knowledge of the assigned treatment.
Total knee arthroplasty is a frequently performed surgical procedure that causes postsurgical pain
of considerable intensity and duration. Standard analgesia following TKA often includes IV and
PO opi[INVESTIGATOR_558696]. Therefore, TKA was selected as an appropriate pain model for
investigating a sustained-release formulation of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], which has the potential to
overcome the limitation reported in previous studies with regard to the duration of the analgesic
effect obtained with commercially-available products.
During Part 1, subjects will receive a single dose femoral nerve block with one of three dose
levels of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (67, 133, or 266 mg). An unblinded dose selection committee
will review study data, determine the apparent efficacy and safety of each of the three liposome
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606394], and recommend a dose level to be tested during Part 2 of the
study. In Part 2 of the study, subjects will receive a single dose injection femoral nerve block
with the selected dose of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (i.e., 67, 133, or 266 mg) or placebo.

11.1. Treatment to be Administered
Study Drug
Subjects will receive a single dose injection femoral block with either one of three doses of
liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (67, 133, or 266 mg) or placebo (preservative-free normal saline) in 20 mL
volume under ultrasound guidance according to the randomization schedule. Preservative-free
normal saline will be added to the 67 mg and 133 mg doses of study drug to achieve a volume of
20 mL (i.e., 15 mL of saline will be added to the 67 mg dose [5 mL] of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606397] 10 mL of saline will be added to the 133 mg dose [10 mL]). Study drug administration will
be performed by [CONTACT_606419]-specific, postsurgical
assessments.
Rescue Medication
Subjects should only receive rescue medication upon request, as needed.
The first rescue medication will consist of IV hydromorphone 0.5 mg, which will be
administered once via bolus only. At this time, the PCA should be loaded with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (morphine
or hydromorphone only).
The second rescue medication will consist of an on-demand PCA-administered opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (morphine
or hydromorphone). The PCA pump will be programmed to deliver either on-demand morphine
or on-demand hydromorphone boluses at a dose and lockout interval consistent with the site's
standard practice. A continuous infusion (background or basal rate) of morphine or
hydromorphone is not permitted. If the subject’s pain is excessive or pain control is inadequate,
then the bolus dose may be adjusted according to local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338310]; however, adding a
basal rate is prohibited . Once the subject is tolerating PO medication, PO immediate-release
oxycodone may be administered (but not more than 10 mg every 4 hours).
If a subject’s pain is inadequately controlled by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_2438], a third rescue, a femoral nerve block,
consisting of conventional bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606379] a concentration of 0.125% (1.25 mg/mL) at a rate
of [ADDRESS_803330] is withdrawn from the study, whichever is sooner. Subjects who do not
achieve adequate pain relief with this regimen will be withdrawn from the study and followed for
AEs per Section 10.3.
11.1.1. Administration Technique
Study drug (liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338309]) will be administered under ultrasound guidance
by [CONTACT_606420] (adopted from Mariano 2009 ).
Patients will have their femoral nerve located by [CONTACT_606421]. The recommended
method is as follows: With a linear array transducer in a sterile sleeve, the femoral nerve will be
identified in a transverse (short-axis) view at the inguinal crease. In a transverse view, the

(fascicles) and hyperechoic connective tissue (perineurium and epi[INVESTIGATOR_41821]). Once the optimal
image of the femoral nerve is obtained, a local anesthetic skin wheal will be raised lateral to the
ultrasound transducer. A needle will be inserted through the skin wheal and directed medially in
plane beneath the ultrasound transducer toward the femoral nerve. The study drug (20 mL) will
be injected posterior to the femoral nerve viathe needle. A flexible epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]-type catheter will
then be placed through the length of the needle and advanced 5 cm beyond the needle tip. Once
the catheter has been inserted, the needle itself will be withdrawn over the catheter. The catheter
tip position will be assessed by [CONTACT_44579] 1 mL of air via the catheter under ultrasound guidance
with the appearance of hyperechoic air bubbles posterior to the femoral nerve confirming proper
catheter placement (and replaced, if necessary). Because the in-plane ultrasound-guided needle
placement technique effectively “tunnels” the catheter in a lateral-to-medial direction under the
transducer, the catheter will not be tunneled further. The catheter will be secured with sterile
liquid adhesive, a clear occlusive dressing, and an anchoring device to affix the catheter hub to
the subject. After negative aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], [ADDRESS_803331](s)

CONFIDENTIAL 19 April 201311.3. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment
11.3.1. Randomization Scheme
In Part 1 of the study, approximately 100 subjects (25 per treatment arm) will be randomized to
receive a single dose injection femoral block with either one of three doses of liposome
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (67, 133, or 266 mg) or placebo.
In Part 2 of the study, approximately 180 subjects (randomized 1:1, resulting in approximately
90 liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606378] 90 placebo subjects) will be randomized to receive single
dose injection femoral nerve block with the selected dose level (i.e., 67, 133, or 266 mg liposome
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) or placebo.
The randomization code will be generated by a centralized randomization system, which will
also be used to communicate subject randomizations to study sites. All randomized subjects will
have both a unique subject identifier and a unique random code identifier. No subject or random
code identifiers are to be reused once assigned.
11.3.2. Randomization Procedures
Once a subject is identified as being qualified for the study per the eligibility criteria (see
Section 10.1 andSection 10.2), and is at the study site for surgery, the research pharmacist or
designee will contact [CONTACT_338373] a randomization assignment
(4-digit random code identifier). The subject will be considered randomized into the study once
the assignment is received.
11.3.3. Replacement of Subjects
Subjects who are randomized but are withdrawn from the study before receiving study drug or
do not undergo the planned surgical procedure may be replaced. Once assigned, subject numbers
will not be reused; subjects enrolled to replace those who withdraw will be assigned a unique
subject number and randomized to treatment according to the procedures outlined above.
11.4. Selection of Doses in the Study
During the clinical development of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], single doses ranging from [ADDRESS_803332] bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 100 mg. Based on this experience, a similar
maximum total dose was deemed appropriate for this study.
During Part 1 of the current study, subjects will receive a single dose femoral nerve block with
one of three dose levels of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (67, 133, or 266 mg) or placebo. During Part 2
of the study, subjects will receive a single dose injection femoral nerve block with the selected
dose level of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (i.e., 67, 133, or 266 mg) or placebo.

11.5.1. Blinding Procedures
Liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338342]; therefore, to maintain the
double-blind study design, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_606399]-specific postsurgical assessments will remained blinded to treatment assignment.
Only unblinded study personnel who are NOT involved with protocol-specific, postsurgical
assessments may prepare or administer the study drug. Staff members conducting study-specific,
postsurgical assessments and the subjects will remain blinded to the assigned treatment
throughout the study. If a subject experiences an SAE, Pacira will not automatically unblind the
subject’s treatment, unless it is necessary to manage treatment of the SAE. Expedited SAEs will
be unblinded by [CONTACT_40571].
Unblinded randomization assignments will be provided via a randomization system. At each
site, only the individual(s) who are identified in the randomization system to receive unblinded
randomization assignments will be responsible for preparing study drug.
Site surveys suggest that study sites will vary in their standard (and feasible) procedures for
preparing sterile study drug in a blinded fashion. Therefore, each site will be responsible for
providing their written blinding procedures for study drug preparation, transportation, and
administration that will ensure that the blind is maintained throughout each of these steps.
This documentation will be made available to Pacira for review before the site enrolls a subject
into the study. Assignment of blinded and unblinded responsibilities regarding the preparation of
study drug should take into account that liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606400] a syringe
for more than 4 hours after preparation for administration .
The presurgical administration of study drug will be recorded using the minimal amount of
information necessary to avoid unblinding staff who will be participating in blinded procedures.
No crossover will be permitted between the blinded and unblinded study site personnel during
the study period. The assignment of site monitors will also be segregated. Blinded monitors will
review case report forms (CRFs), clinic charts, and all other study-related documents that do not
disclose the allocation of study treatment. Care should be taken in recording and review of
operating room records to not record information in an unblinded fashion. Pharmacy or any
other clinic records providing unblinded information (e.g., randomization, study drug
preparation, study drug accountability, study drug administration) will be reviewed by
[CONTACT_482805].
11.5.2. Unblinding Procedures
Subject treatment assignments should not be unblinded during the study by [CONTACT_606422]. The Investigator will have the ability to unblind a subject if he or she feels that
subject safety warrants such unblinding. However, the Investigator should discuss the safety
issues with the Medical Monitor before attempting such unblinding, if possible. Any unblinding
will be documented through immediate notification of the Pacira study team and the Investigator.
Any accidental unblinding events (i.e., through mishaps in the operating room or
miscommunication among study staff) must be reported to Pacira immediately.

A time and events schedule for all study procedures is provided in Table 1.
13.1. Instructions for Conducting Procedures and Measures
With the exception of the PK assessments (which will be conducted after the beginning of study
drug administration), all assessments conducted after baseline will be timed from the end of
surgery. Day [ADDRESS_803343] suture/staple. Postsurgical is defined as after the end of surgery.
Subjects will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192608] 72 hours after surgery; therefore, postsurgical analgesia
and collection of study data through the primary endpoint will take place under the supervision
of study staff.
13.1.1. Pain Intensity Assessments
Pain intensity will be assessed using the NRS-R followed by [CONTACT_257141]-A (see Appendix 1).
To assess pain intensity at rest (NRS-R), the subject will assume a resting position that does not
exacerbate his or her postsurgical pain. The subject will rest in this position for at least
5 minutes before responding to the following question, “ On a scaleof 0 to 10, where0 =no pain
and 10 =worst possiblepain, how much pain areyou having right now ?” The subject’s
response will be recorded.
The subject’s pain intensity will be assessed with activity (NRS-A). The prescribed activity is
active knee flexion up to [ADDRESS_803344] will respond to the following question, “ On a
scaleof 0 to 10, where0 =no pain and 10 =worst possiblepain, how much pain areyou having
right now?” The subject’s response will be recorded.
Note: At time points when the NRS pain intensity assessments coincide, the NRS-R will be
conducted before the NRS-A. At time points when the NRS pain intensity assessment(s) and a
PK assessment coincide, the NRS assessment will be conducted before the blood draw.
Additionally, if ice or passive extenders are used, these must be stopped at least [ADDRESS_803345] 15 minutes prior to the NRS pain intensity assessments.
13.1.2. Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score Questionnaire
The OBAS questionnaire ( Lehmann 2010) will be completed at 24, 48, and 72 hours
(seeAppendix 3).
13.1.3. Neurological Assessment
A neurological assessment will be conducted at baseline, [ADDRESS_803346]'s orientation. Additionally, the subject will be asked whether s/he is experiencing any
numbness and tingling of the mouth and lips, a metallic taste, blurred vision, tremors, or
twitching (see Appendix 2). If the neurological assessment reveals a neurological event that the

CONFIDENTIAL 19 April 2013Investigator believes may be associated with high levels of systemic bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], an
unscheduled PK blood sample should be collected at the time that the event is noted.
13.1.4. Cardiac Assessment (Electrocardiogram Recordings)
Digital 12-lead holter ECGs will be recorded using the Mortara Instrument Digital H12+ ™ECG
continuous recorder (Mortara Instrument, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin), which will continuously
record all [ADDRESS_803347]’s unique identification number and demographic information will be
recorded for each card. Without knowledge of subject treatment assignment, a central laboratory
will generate a 10-second, 12-lead digital ECG at each time point specified in the protocol.
If targeted ECG time points are artifactual and of poor quality, the central laboratory will capture
analyzable 10-second ECGs as close as possible to the targeted time points.
Digital ECGs will be transmitted by [CONTACT_338378], EXPERT. Interval duration measurements will first be obtained by [CONTACT_338379] a computer screen
utilizing the method of Global Median Beat. The Global Median Beat is created by [CONTACT_338380], where one representative beat for each of the 12 leads is selected and superimposed,
creating a single superimposed (Global Median) beat. Trained analysts will then review for
correct interval duration measurement (IDM) caliper placement and adjudicate the pre-placed
algorithm calipers as necessary. A cardiologist will then verify the interval durations and
perform the morphology analysis, noting any T-U wave complex that suggests an abnormal form
compatible with an effect on cardiac repolarization.
On-screen measurements of the HR, PR, QRS, and QT interval durations will be performed and
derived variables RR, QTcF, and QTcB will be calculated using the following formulae:
QTcB = QT/ √RR
QTcF = QT/3√RR
RR = 60/HR
Each fiducial point (onset of P wave, onset of Q wave, offset of S wave, and offset of T wave)
will be marked. The original ECG waveform and such annotations will be saved separately in
XML format for independent review.
Electrocardiogram changes in RR, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF, and QTcB will be examined at the time
closest to the median T max.
13.1.5. Sensory Function Assessment (Cold Test)
For the sensory function assessment, the subject’s sensitivity to cold in the innervated
dermatomes (L2, L3) (see Appendix 7) will be assessed at baseline, when the subject wakes up
after surgery (general surgery subjects only), and at 2, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and [ADDRESS_803348]’s sensitivity to cold has returned in two consecutive evaluations.
The subject's skin will be wiped with ice or an alcohol pad. The subject will then be asked,
"Does this feel cold - yes or no?"

CONFIDENTIAL 19 April 201313.1.6. Motor Function Assessment (20-Meter Walk Test)
Each subject's ability to perform a 20-meter walk, unassisted with the optional use of a 4-legged
walker, on a level surface will be assessed at baseline (during screening) and postsurgically at
24 hours, 72 hours, and on Day 30.
Subjects will be transported to the start of the course by [CONTACT_606425], assisted into a standing
position, and instructed to walk from end-to-end at their own pace while attempting to cover
20 meters with or without using a four-leg walker. The following standardized limited
encouragement from the staff should be offered: "You're doing well" or "Keep up the good
work." The outcome of the test will be recorded as either "yes" (the subject was able to walk the
full 20 meter distance) or "no" (the subject was unable to walk the full 20 meter distance).
13.1.7. Vital Signs
Vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure) will be assessed after the subject has rested in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_206142] [ADDRESS_803349]’s satisfaction with postsurgical pain control will be assessed at 72 hours and Day 30
using the Likert Scale (see Appendix 4).
13.1.9. Physician Satisfaction with Sensory/Motor Function
The physician’s satisfaction with return of sensory/motor function will be assessed at 72 hours
and on Day 30 using a Likert scale (see Appendix 5).
13.1.10. Fall Prevention
The study staff must ensure adequate safety precautions are in place in order to prevent falls
(e.g., use of a knee immobilizer and walker/crutches during ambulation, as needed).
Additionally, the study staff must be educated regarding possible continuous peripheral nerve
block-induced muscle weakness and necessary fall precautions.

14.1. Adverse Events
14.1.1. Definitions
Definition of Adverse Event (AE) :Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of
a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse
experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory finding),
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about
causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use in combination with
another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended change in a body structure or body function.
Adverse events include any clinically significant deterioration of a subject’s medical status.
The AE may involve any organ or system and can be represented by [CONTACT_338382] a disease, a syndrome, a symptom, a physical sign, as well as by [CONTACT_338383]. Any medically relevant and untoward
change after the subject is randomized, including frequency or pattern changes for a fluctuating
condition (e.g., migraine) is considered an AE.
An AE that occurs after randomization and before the start of the study drug administration is
identified as a pretreatment AE (PTAE). An AE that occurs after the administration of the study
treatment is considered a TEAE. All AEs must be recorded and reported accordingly, whether
they appear causally related to the study drug or not. Adverse events will be followed until the
outcome is known or until the end of the study.
Definition of Adverse Reaction: Any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.
Definition of Suspected Adverse Reaction: Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility
that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.
A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse
reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. Suspected adverse reactions are a subset of all
AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.

CONFIDENTIAL 19 April 201314.1.2. Recording Adverse Events
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to document all AEs (i.e., PTAEs and TEAEs) with an
onset after the subject is randomized. For the purpose of this study, all AEs that occur through
Day [ADDRESS_803353] be recorded regardless of whether or not they are considered related to
study drug. Whenever feasible, AE terms should be documented as medical diagnoses (highest
possible level of integration); otherwise, the AEs should be reported separately as individual
signs or symptoms. Only one AE per line should be recorded in the AE CRF; for example, an
AE of nausea and vomiting should be listed as two separate events: the event of nausea and the
event of vomiting. If a diagnosis is established after symptoms are recorded on the AE CRF,
the diagnosis should be recorded and the symptoms collapsed (removed; i.e., lined through and
initialed). Whenever possible, abnormal laboratory results should be reported as their clinical
corollary (e.g., low potassium should be recorded as hypokalemia).
All AEs will be followed through progression and regression of their severity. For example,
if an AE is reported as mild in severity but changes to moderate, the AE of mild will have an
outcome of changed AE characteristic and the AE will be re-entered. The AE with a moderate
severity must have the same start date as the mild event stop date. If the AE then becomes mild,
the AE with a moderate severity will have an outcome of changed AE characteristic and the AE
will be re-entered with a severity of mild; the start date of the mild AE must be the same as the
stop date of the moderate AE.
Any condition noted before the subject is randomized will be listed as Medical History and is
considered a pre-existing condition. If a pre-existing condition changes (i.e., becomes more
severe or more frequent), at any time after randomization, or after study drug administration, it is
considered an AE. Note: A change in treatment for a pre-existing condition (e.g., new high
blood pressure medication), does not necessarily indicate an AE.
Information recorded on the AE CRF will include the AE term, the date and time of onset,
severity, seriousness, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, action taken for
the AE, and the outcome of the AE, including the date and time of resolution, if applicable.
14.1.3. Severity of Adverse Events
In general, the severity of an AE should be categorized using the following guidelines :
Mild: An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.
Moderate: An AE that is discomforting and interferes with normal everyday
activities.
Severe: An AE that prevents normal everyday activities.
14.1.4. Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug
The Investigator will assess the relationship of the AE to study drug after careful medical
consideration on a case-by-case basis. General guidelines are provided below:
Not Related: A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE can be
easilyruled out (e.g., based on the temporal sequence, absence of
Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 402-C-323 (TKA)
Liposome Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606385]. 040-[ZIP_CODE].006 53 of 71 PCDOC #[ADDRESS_803354] evidence of
actual cause).
Related: There is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event (i.e .,there
is a reasonablepossibility based on evidence to suggest that the drug
caused the event).
14.1.5. Outcome of Adverse Events
The Investigator will assess the outcome of the AE after careful medical consideration, on a
case-by-case basis. General guidelines are provided below:
Recovered/Resolved: The event resolved and the subject recovered from the AE.
Recovered/Resolved
with Sequelae:The initial event resolved, but has a continuing abnormal condition
as a result of the AE.
Not Recovered/
Not Resolved:At the time of last assessment, the event was ongoing, with an
undetermined outcome. Note: ongoing AEs are not to be considered
resolved as a result of death.
Recovering/Resolving: At the time of last assessment, the event was decreasing in
frequency, severity, etc., and a resolution was expected.
Fatal: The AE directly caused death.
Unknown: There was an inability to access the subject or the subject’s records
to determine the outcome (e.g., subject withdrew consent or was
lost to follow-up).
14.1.6. Action Taken with Subject due to an Adverse Event
The Investigator will provide any actions taken regarding the subject (e.g., treatment, diagnostic
tests, laboratory tests, or therapy) for each reported AE.
None.
Medication.
Non-pharmaceutical therapy. (The specific therapy used must be recorded in the
CRF.)
Discontinued from study.
Other. (The specific action taken must be recorded.)

CONFIDENTIAL 19 April 201314.2. Serious Adverse Events
14.2.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event
Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of
either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:
Death1.
A life-threatening adverse event2.
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]3.
A persistent or significant incapacity4.
Congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Medically significant5.
1Death: Any event resulting in a subject’s death must be reported as an SAE. However, death,
in and of itself, is not an AE; it is an outcome. The cause of death is the AE. Therefore, the
Investigator should make every effort to obtain and document the cause of death for all subjects
who die during the study. If, despi[INVESTIGATOR_321510], the cause of death remains unknown, the AE
should be documented as an “unspecified fatal event.”
2Life-threatening: An AE is considered life-threatening if, in the view of either the Investigator
or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an
AE that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.
3Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] : It should be noted that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], in and of itself, does not represent an
SAE. It is the AE leading to the subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40541] “serious” when it
requires inpatient care. Consequently, an SAE should not be reported in case of preplanned
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen during the study. However,
any medical condition that delays a subject’s discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (i.e., prolonged
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) or requires the subject to be readmitted should be reported as an SAE.
4Persistent or significant incapacity: A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct
normal life functions.
5Medically Significant : Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medically
significant events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
14.2.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events
Any SAE or death that occurs at any time after randomization through Day 30, whether or not
related to study drug, must be reported by [CONTACT_606427] [ADDRESS_803355] information for
Pacira Drug Safety/designee can be found in the regulatory binder.

all SAEs until resolved or the condition stabilizes and further follow-up is not warranted.
If the Investigator is made aware of any SAEs after Day 30, these should also be reported to
Pacira Drug Safety or designee provided the SAE is considered related to study drug. The site
would then provide a completed SAE form within 1 business day and the event would be
followed until resolution, or until adequate stabilization is met.

CONFIDENTIAL 19 April 201315. STATISTICAL METHODS
A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed for this study. A separate
SAP will be developed for the analysis of the ECG results.
15.1. Study Hypothesis
Part 1
The primary objectives of Part 1 are to (1) evaluate three dose levels of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606405], and (2) select a
single therapeutic dose of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606406].
Part 2
The primary null hypothesis is:
H0: The means of the AUC of the NRS-R pain intensity scores through 72 hours are not
different between the liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338353].
The alternative hypothesis is:
HA: The mean AUC of the NRS-R pain intensity scores through 72 hours for the
liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338354].
15.2. Study Endpoints
The endpoints to be assessed in this study are listed in Section 12.2 (Efficacy Endpoints),
Section 12.4 (PK Endpoints) and Section 12.6 (Safety Endpoints).
15.3. Determination of Sample Size
Part 1
The sample size for Part 1 of the study was not based on formal statistical power calculations.
Part 2
A study population of approximately 180 subjects is planned with approximately 90 subjects in
each treatment group (liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338304]). The sample size was estimated based
on the results of a Phase 3 hemorrhoidectomy study of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606407] (standard deviation) AUC of the NRS-R pain intensity scores through 72 hours
was 141 (101) and 202 (104) for the liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338353], respectively.
A two-group t-test with 0.[ADDRESS_803357] > 97% power to detect a
difference in means of 61, assuming that the common standard deviation is 104, when the sample
size in each group is 90.
After the data from Part 1 are evaluated, the sample size for Part 2 may be increased.

CONFIDENTIAL 19 April 201315.4. Analysis Populations
The following analysis sets are planned:
Safety: The safety analysis set will include all subjects who receive study drug and will be based
on actual treatment received.
Efficacy: The efficacy analysis set will include all subjects in the safety analysis set who undergo
the planned surgery and will be based on randomized treatment, regardless of actual treatment
received.
Pharmacokinetic: The PK analysis set will include all subjects in the safety analysis set who
receive liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], provide sufficient samples to allow for calculation of PK
parameters required for analysis, and who do not receive conventional bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606408].
15.5. Handling Subject Dropouts and Discontinuations
For the calculation of AUC of NRS pain intensity scores through any of the time periods, the
following methods will be used for imputing missing data:
Missing scores before the first non-missing score will be replaced by [CONTACT_338384]. Missing scores after the last
non-missing score will be replaced by [CONTACT_338385]-missing score (last observation carried
forward). Linear interpolation will be used to replace missing scores between two non-missing
scores. Subjects who have no pain scores after surgery will have the missing scores replaced by
[CONTACT_338386].
Additional methods for dealing with missing data will be described in the SAP.
15.6. Statistical Analyses
15.6.1. Baseline Characteristics
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], separately for
Part 1 and Part 2.
15.6.2. Study Compliance
The percentage of subjects in each analysis set and the percentage who fail to complete the study
(as well as the reasons for discontinuation) will be displayed by [CONTACT_1570], separately for
Part 1 and Part 2.
15.6.3. Efficacy Analyses
All efficacy analyses will be based on randomized treatment, regardless of actual treatment
received.
Efficacy data for Part 1 and Part 2 will be analyzed separately.

Liposome Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606385]. 040-[ZIP_CODE].006 58 of 71 PCDOC #[ADDRESS_803358] (wWOCF) imputation method will be applied. For subjects who
take rescue pain medication, their pain intensity scores recorded within the window of controlled
type of rescue medication (6 hours for oxycodone, 4 hours for morphine, and 2 hours for IV
hydromorphone) will be replaced by [CONTACT_941] ‘worst’ observation. For subjects who require a rescue
with conventional bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974], the window will be from the start of the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606409] 12 hours. All pain scores within that window will be
replaced by [CONTACT_941] ‘worst’ observation. The worst observation will be the highest score in the time
interval from the end of surgery up to the time prior to taking their first rescue pain medication.
Note that pain intensity scores in the window that are higher than the worst value prior to rescue
pain medication will not be overwritten. If no pain intensity score is available prior to the first
rescue pain medication, the worst observation from all available measurements will be used
instead.
Part 1
For AUC of the NRS-R pain intensity scores through 72 hours, each dose of liposome
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606410] (ANCOVA) with
treatment as the main effect and the baseline NRS-R pain intensity score as the covariate. Based
on the model, the difference between each dose of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606411] 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI).
Part [ADDRESS_803359] and the baseline NRS-R
pain intensity score as the covariate. Based on the model, the difference between the treatment
groups will be estimated along with the 2-sided 95% CI.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Measures
The secondary efficacy measures for Part 2 of this study are:
Total postsurgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_338358] 72 hours
Time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_265388].
These efficacy measures will be analyzed using a hierarchical fixed-sequence stepwise testing
procedure. To protect the Type [ADDRESS_803360] will be declared positive at the two-sided
0.05 significance level.

[IP_ADDRESS] Tertiary Efficacy Measures
Continuous Measures of Efficacy
For AUC of pain intensity scores, missing data will be imputed as described in Section 15.[ADDRESS_803363] and the baseline value as the covariate will be used. Based on
the model, liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_606413]-sided 95% CIs about the
differences will be presented.

Part 1
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated from the PK analysis set, using plasma drug
concentration-time profiles, where appropriate, by [CONTACT_105]-compartmental analysis.
Actual sampling time will be used for all calculations of the PK parameters. If there is any doubt
in the actual time a sample was taken, then the scheduled time will be used.
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the PK parameters.
Part 2
Not applicable.
15.6.5. Safety Analyses
All safety analyses will be based on actual treatment received.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
Adverse events from Part 1 and Part 2 will be shown separately and combined.
Adverse event verbatim terms will be mapped to preferred terms and related system organ class
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All summaries of AEs will
only include TEAEs. Events that start prior to the start of study drug administration will be
identified in listings only. Incidence rates of TEAEs and the proportion of subject prematurely
withdrawn from the study due to a TEAE will be shown for each treatment group. Incidence
rates also will be displayed for each treatment group for study drug-related TEAEs and by
[CONTACT_926]. Incidence rates of SAEs also will be shown for each treatment group. All incidence
rates will be categorized and displayed by [CONTACT_6657].

i PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS – BMT CTN PROTOCOL 0601 
 
Unrelated Donor Reduced Intensity Bone Marrow Transplant  for Children  
with Severe Sickle Cell Disease  
 
Study Chairpersons:  Shalini Shenoy, M.D., Naynesh Kamani, M.D.  
Primary Objective:  The primary objective  is to determine event -free survival (EFS) at 1 
year after unrelated donor (URD) hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HCT) using bone marrow (BM) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD).  Death, disease recurrence or graft rejection by 1 year will be considered events for this endpoint. 
Secondary Objectives:  Secondary objectives include determining the effect of HCT on clinical and laboratory manifestations of severe sickle cell disease including stroke and determining the incidence of other transplant -
related outcom es.  The latter include: overall survival; neutrophil, 
and platelet recovery; grades II -IV and grade III- IV acute graft -
versus- host disease (GVHD); chronic GVHD; hepatic veno-
occlusive disease (VOD); idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS); central nervous sys tem (CNS) toxicity (reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome [RPLS], hemorrhage, and seizures); neurocognitive dysfunction; cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection; adenovirus infection; Epstein Barr virus  infection ; invasive fungal 
infect ion; immune reco nstitution; and health -related quality of life 
(QOL).  
Study Design:  The study is a Phase II, single arm, multi -center trial.  It is designed 
to estimate the efficacy and toxicity of unrelated donor HCT using a reduced -intensity conditioning regimen in pat ients with SCD and 
high risk features who are between 3.0 and 19.75 years of age.  
Accrual Objective:  The target sample size is 30 BM recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].

1-1 CHAPTER 1  
  
1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a recessive genetic disorder caused by a point mutation that results in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at the sixth position in the ß -chain of hemoglobin.  
The homozygous gene disorder affects approximately 1 in every 400 African American newborns and an estimated 70,000 persons in the [LOCATION_002].  A major cause of morbidity and mortality in severe SCD is vaso -occlusion, often causing irreversible damage in target organs 
such as the central nervous system (CNS),  lung, bone , and joints.  Sequelae of this genetic defect 
can occur in any organ.  The most devastating result is cerebral infarction.
[ADDRESS_648668] syndrome (ACS), pulmonary hypertension, and severe vaso- occlusive painful crises.  These 
complications predict for early mortality, recurrent sickle -related complications such as ACS , 
and poor quality of life.
2, 3, 4, 5  The average life expectancy for male pati ents with SCD is 42 
years, and 48 years for females.6  Among patients with Hb SS and S -ß thalassemia, the overall 
rates of death and stroke were 0.59 and 0.85/100 patient -years.  The cumulative overall and 
stroke- free survival decreases to 85.6% and 88.5%  by [ADDRESS_648669] impaired motor and/or cognitive function because of cerebral infarction manifesting as overt or silent strokes.  Overt strokes occur in approximately 9% of patients with sickle cell disease before their 14
th birthday.8  Silent cerebral infarctions, defined by 
[CONTACT_504034] T2 weighted images but with no history or physical findings of focal neurologic deficits lasting longer than 24 hours, are another common form of neurologi c injury in children with SCD.  By 14 years of age, 18% of children with sickle cell 
anemia (Hb SS) have silent cerebral infarcts .
9  Silent cerebral infarcts are associated with an 
increased risk of overt stroke, lower IQ, and poor academic achievement.10, 11, 12, 13 
 Regular blood transfusion is less than optimal for prevention of recurrent strokes.  Scothorn et al. 
identified 137 children with a stroke that were followed for a mean and median of 10 years.
14  
Participants were included if they had continuous blood transfusion therapy throughout the observation period with a maximum transfusion interval of less  than six weeks.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_503976], approximately 20% (1 in 5) developed a second stroke, and of that group, 30% (1 in 3) had a third stroke.  In the subgroup group of patients that had second or third strokes, the hemoglobin S levels were documented to be less than 30%.  Given the high rate of second and third strokes, even with optimal transfusion therapy, stem cell transplant for this high- risk population is a therapeutic option that may provide benefit over transfusions.  
Improved cerebrovascular patency following HCT has been previously described in SCD.
15 
 Other complications of sickle cell disease associat ed with increased morbidity and/ or mortality 
and/or poor quality of life include severe, persistent , and recurrent painful epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], recurrent 
pulmonary vaso- occlusion resulting in progressive pulmonary changes, and the development of 
pulmonary hypertension.  For these co -morbid conditions, the natural history is not well defined 
but there is a significant risk of progression and early mortality, especially if they remain 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Pediatric URD Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol [ADDRESS_648670] Hb SS or Hb 
S-βº thalassemia.  However, clinical severity of the disease is dependent on several factors such 
as leukocyte and platelet counts, non- globin gene modifiers, Hb S polymer fractions, and the 
level of  reduction of beta chain synthesis.
17, 18, 19, 20  This results in a severe disease phenotype in 
some patients with sickle cell disease variants such as Hb S -β+ thalassemia, Hb S C, etc.  Since 
the pathology and progression of disease in these patients is comparable with those with severe 
Hb SS disease, it is logical to consider the curative option of stem cell transplantation in all patients with Hb S variant disease that manifest a severe phenotype.    1.1. Role of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 
 Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment currently available for patients with SCD and can benefit patients who are likely to have significant morbidity and early mortality from the disease.
21, [ADDRESS_648671] but is limited by [CONTACT_504035] -related complications.  These include early and 
late organ toxicities of individual agents and depend on the age of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_503977]/or radiotherapy applied.
29  Since graft failure is a major 
barrier especi ally in immunocompetent and extensively transfused recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], transplantation in 
this setting has relied upon myeloablative conditioning to achieve donor cell engraftment.  Commonly used myeloablative conditioning regimens contain high doses of total body  
irradiation (TBI) or busulfan and another alkylating agent.  In addition to prolonged myelosuppression, acute toxicities include gastrointestinal (mucositis, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia), genitourinary (renal, hemorrhagic cystitis), cardiac, cuta neous (erythema, 
desquamation, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371]), CNS (seizures, hemorrhage, encephalopathy), pulmonary, and hepatic (VOD) manifestations.
[ADDRESS_648672] Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol [ADDRESS_648673].  Late toxicities include chronic pulmonary dysfunction, endocrine insufficiency, gonadal failure and sterility, learning disorders, neurocognitive deficits, and chronic alopecia.
31, 32, 33, 34, 35 
 Patients receiving non- transplant therapy for SCD are at risk for  disease - or therapy- related 
organ complications such as hepatotoxicity or cardiotoxicity from transfusional iron overload and inadequate chelation, pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension, renal damage, and neurotoxicity/hypertension/seizure disorder  as a consequence of sickle neurovascular disease.  
These toxicities render many patients who might benefit from HCT ineligible or more susceptible to transplant related toxicities.  The risk of conditioning regimen- related toxicity in 
these patients must be balanced with the risk of graft rejection due to inadequate host immunosuppression when transplant conditioning options are considered.
36  
 
1.3. Bone Marrow as a Source of Hematopoietic Stem Cells  
 
Only 14% of patients with SCD are likely to have a HLA- identical sibling donor.[ADDRESS_648674] patients with SC D.  Donors who are matched at 6 (HLA -A, B and DRB1 loci) to 10 HLA -antigens 
(including HLA -C and DQB1 loci) can be identified via the National Marrow Donor Program in 
approximately 80% of Caucasian recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]; however, the likelihood of identifying a simil arly 
HLA- matched URD is less likely in other ethnic groups due to under -representation of these 
groups in the volunteer donor pool and greater genetic diversity of some groups, particularly African -Americans.
[ADDRESS_648675] for those who might benefit.38 
 Treatment related mortality (TRM) and the incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD depend on the level of HLA matching especially in the unrelated donor set ting.  The incidence of 
grade II -IV acute GVHD (within the initial [ADDRESS_648676]) ranges from 10- 50% after HLA -
identical sibling bone marrow transplantation.
39  The incidence of  chronic GVHD ranges 
between 60 -80% in long- term survivors of unrelated HCT.  As expected, GVHD rates are higher 
after unrelated donor HCT, dependent on the degree of HLA mismatch.40, [ADDRESS_648677] outcomes appear to be optimal when bone marrow donors are HLA -
matched (at the allele level) at 8 loci (A, B, C and DRB1), this level of matching will be adopted for this study.
42  The recent Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) report from 
2006 suggests that 36.1% of African American patients will be able to locate a donor matched for 8/8 HLA alleles in the unrelated donor registry (personal communication – D. Confer).   1.4. HCT for Severe Sickle Cell Disease  
 Allogeneic HCT for SCD following myeloablative conditioning ensures donor cell engraftment and can ameliorate SCD symptoms, improve quality of life, and stabilize vasculopathy.  In a multicenter trial of BM transplantation from HLA -identical sibling donors, [ADDRESS_648678] Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol 0601  
  Version 11.0 dated June 4, 2014  
 
 
1-4 engraftment.  Thirteen of these had stable mixed chimerism (11- 90% donor cells); all had a 
normal hemoglobin levels (11.2 to 14.2 g/dl).  Hb S levels ranged from 0- 7% when donor 
chimerism ranged between 11- 74% (normal donors) and 36- 37% when donor chimeris m ranged 
between 25 -60% in donors with SS trait.  Stable donor engraftment (whether associated with 
complete or mixed chimerism) resulted in resolution of symptoms of vaso- occlusive crisis 
(VOC), stroke and acute chest syndrome.  Thus, though [ADDRESS_648679] hematopoietic chimerism, the majority of these patients continue to survive free of 
SCD symptomatology.  The overall survival was 94% and the event -free survival was 85%.  A 
similar study by a French group demonstrated the need for immune ablation to achieve successful donor cell engraftment.
44, 45  Graft failure rates were significantly lower after the 
addition of rabbit anti -thymocyte globulin (rATG) to a myeloablative combination of busulfan 
and cyclophosphamide.  TRM  was 10% and DFS was 85%.  Thus, HLA identical sibling HCT 
has acceptable results and ameliorates disease symptoms, especially in children.  Of significance, 
[ADDRESS_648680] study developed ovarian failure after exposure to 
myeloablat ive BU dosing.46  Sterility and other late effects of myeloablative conditioning 
regimen remain of concern in transplants for children with non- malignant disorders where the 
preparative regimen is used solely to achieve stable donor engraftment.  Related d onor UCB transplantation for hemoglobinopathies has also been successful.  Locatelli 
et al reported outcomes in 44 children with sickle cell disease (N=11) or thalassemia major (N=33) who received myeloablative doses of busulfan, cytoxan +/ - ATG, or busulf an, 
cytoxan/fludarabine and thiotepa.
47  The median number of TNC infused was 4.0 x 107/kg (range 
1.2-10 x 107/kg).  No patient died of transplant -related complications.  Thirty -six of [ADDRESS_648681].  The two -
year EFS rates were 79% for thalassemia and 90% for SCD.  Graft failure rates were lower after intensifying the conditioning regimen with the addition of thiotepa and eliminating methotrexate 
from the GVHD prophylaxis.  Although sibling donor HCT for SCD and thalassemia major has demonstrated the effectiveness of this treatment, the approach is only feasible if a suitable donor  is available.  Consequently, 
unrelated donor transplant strategies must be designed to explore methods of safely treating patients with hemoglobinopathies by [CONTACT_504036]/graft types with acceptable rates of early and late toxicities.  
 1.5. Non-myeloablative or Reduced -intensity Conditioning Regimens: Rationale and 
Clinical Experience 
 Myeloablative conditioning ensures engraftment of donor cells in most HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
However, reduced intensity conditioning is attractive due to its potential for reduced toxicity.  Since stable mixed chimerism is sufficient to ameliorate symptoms of the underlying disease in disorders such as SCD and thalassemia, it is possible that reduced intensity conditioning might be effective even if it results in stable chimerism.   
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Pediatric URD Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol 0601  
  Version 11.0 dated June 4, 2014  
 
 
1-5 Murine and canine transplantation models demonstrate that myeloablation is not necessary to achieve donor engraftment; suppression of host lymphocytes is adequate to permit this process.  This approach could have the following potential advantages: 1) lower regimen- related toxicity, 
both early and late; 2) a shorter period of neutropenia; 3) shorte r hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; and  4) 
consideration of transplantation in some recipi[INVESTIGATOR_503978] -existing disease -related end organ 
dysfunction.
[ADDRESS_648682] utilizing ‘minimally ablative’ conditioning regimens is largely limited to malignant disorders,  especially in elderly or high -risk patients , and has been successful in 
achieving stable engraftment of donor cells in that setting.
[ADDRESS_648683] also demonstrated a high incidence of GVHD similar to that predicted in myeloabative regimens.
54, 55, 56 
 Reduced inten sity regimens vary substantially in the levels of myeloablation and immune 
suppression achieved.  It is clear that if a reduced intensity regimen is to be successful, a high level of immunoablation is necessary for successful donor engraftment following tr ansplantation 
for non- malignant disorders such as hemoglobinopathies.  Further, GVHD offers no benefit in 
this group (in contrast to patients with malignancies where GVHD -associated anti -cancer effects 
mitigate the recurrence risk), and strategies to minimize the incidence of GVHD while ensuring engraftment would optimize outcomes after HCT.  1.6. Objectives and Experience with the Conditioning Regimen Proposed  
 A reduced intensity conditioning regimen consisting of alemtuzumab, fludarabine , and 
melphalan was developed in [ADDRESS_648684] Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol 0601  
  Version 11.0 dated June 4, 2014  
 
 
1-6 regimen was based in part on the observations of Chakraverty, et al where the combination of alemtuzumab (following a contracted time course of administration nearer the stem cell infusion) with f ludarabine and melphalan was administered in [ADDRESS_648685] and resulted in a low rate (2 of 44 patients) of graft failure and a very low frequency of acute (3/44) and chronic GVHD (0/44).
[ADDRESS_648686] in that study.  Because it has a serum half -life of 42 -57 hours, its presence in 
the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ serum early post -transplant was probably available to bind donor cells and reduce 
the GVHD risk.  In this group, early TRM was 14.9%, and graft failure was 4.5%.  There are two disadvantages to the approach described above.  Elimination of donor T cells by [CONTACT_504037].  Pharmacokinetic studies show that a concentration of up to 0.5µ g/mL of alemtuzumab can 
be detected by [CONTACT_504038] [ADDRESS_648687] when 100 mg 
alemtuzumab is given between Days –8 and –4.
60  Persistence of the antibody, with 
accompanying donor immunodepletion, also results in delayed immune reconstitution and increased risk of late infections and infection -related mortality.
61, 62, 63  Hence, we modified the 
alemtuzumab  dosing and administration schedule, moving it to Days –21, –20, and –19, well 
before infusion of donor cells, to reduce the level and duration of exposure of the  infused donor 
cells to the antibody.   Initial experience with this modified conditioning reg imen has been published.
[ADDRESS_648688] with this regimen.  Four recipi[INVESTIGATOR_503979] a graft rejection following an initial myeloablative or reduced intensity regimen.  The children were treated by [CONTACT_504039] (33 bone marrow; [ADDRESS_648689]) and HLA -identical sibling donor HCT (15).  One unrelated 
donor was matched at 9/10 HLA alleles but mismatched for a single class I antigen; another was  
matched at 8/[ADDRESS_648690] blood donors (all

(range 1 -52 months).  The regimen caused little toxicity with the exception of reactions during 
alemtuzumab infusion.  Most had only urticaria and fever that responded to pre -medication.  One 
patient developed superficial blisters on the trunk and extremities and the last dose of alemtuzumab could not be administered.  Another patient did not receive the final 5 mg because of generalized urticaria.  Myeloid (ANC > 0.5x10
9/L) and platelet (> 50x109/L) engraftment 
occurred at a median of 13 (10- 36) and 26 (12- 82) days, respectively.  Among 52 patients with 
follow-up the overall survival was 87% and event free survival was 77%.  
 Graft failure (defined as less than 20% donor cells in lymphoid, myeloid, or bone marrow compartments) occurred in 5% of the patients.  All graft failures occurred within [ADDRESS_648691] to observations of graft rejection that occurred in patients with mixed donor chimerism treated by [CONTACT_504040].  No late graft failure has occurred to date.  Two patients with graft rejection had SCD

within a month prior to commencing treatment; 2) weekly monitoring and therapy for CMV infection; 3) maintaining higher pla telet count after HCT; and  4) the addition of methotrexate to 
the GVHD prophylaxis for UCB transplants.  Acute GVHD (grades I I-IV) developed in 15% and 
chronic GVHD in 11% of patients.  The onset of chronic GVHD was 6- [ADDRESS_648695] -

 Ten patients with hemoglobinopathie s (3 with thalassemia and 7 with SCD) were treated by [CONTACT_504041].  There was no significant regimen -related toxicity and no treatment related 
mortality.  Indications for HCT among SCD patients were stroke and severe VOC, and all patients were receiving chronic RBC transfusions prior to HCT.  Two of the 10 patients received a reduced dose of melphalan (70 mg/m

remaining 8 patients received a melphalan dose 140 mg/m2.  Five received bone marrow f rom

Based upon the preliminary experience of HCT for hemoglobinopathies in this study, it appears that the conditioning regimen is safe in most patients, and there were no deaths related to transplantation in this small series.  Several additional patients who were treated with this regimen also h ad received chronic transfusion therapy (for Evan syndrome, congenital 
dyserythropoietic anemia type I, and aplastic anemia) before HCT and all had stable engraftment of donor cells.  Of interest, an adolescent female had an uneventful pregnancy [ADDRESS_648698],  temporally followed by [CONTACT_398]8+ T cells, B cells, and finally CD4+ T cells between [ADDRESS_648699] Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol 0601

 Health -related quality of life (QOL) is a measure of a patient’s well being from a physical, 
emotional, and social perspective.  It is a valid patient reported outcome that measures the impact of disease, morbidity from disease, and treatment of disease on the well being and functioning of the pat ient and family.  Health -related QOL is traditionally measured at multiple intervals to 
track impact of treatment and the natural history of the disease.  It will be used in this setting to determine the impact of HCT on the well being of the child. 
The Ch ild Health Questionnaire (CHQ) is a widely used instrument to measure health -related 
QOL that has been validated in children with sickle cell disease and in children with other 
chronic diseases.

and over).  The testing instruments are listed below and address specific domains that are impaired in patients with SCD.  Similar testing is previously reported and also underway in an internatio nal trial of chronic transfusion therapy for SCD and silent stroke and correlate with 
MRI changes.

Additional details are provided in Appendix G.   Rationale for Choosing Neuropsychologic Tests :  The selected measures were chosen to 
provide optimal screening of neurocognitive abilities t hat may be impaired in children with SCD, 
especially those who have had prior stroke.  Measures assessing specific cognitive domains were selected for the following characteristics: 1) appropriate for administration to children and young adults in the age ranges to be studied; 2) widely  used in clinical practice; and  3) having good 
psychometric properties.  For example, the WASI was selected because it can be administered to individuals from [ADDRESS_648710] Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol 0601

2-1 CHAPTER 2  
  
2. STUDY DESIGN  
 2.1. Study Overview  
 The primary goal of this Phase II study is to determine whether a reduced intensity conditioning regimen in the setting of unrelated donor (URD) HCT is successful in achieving donor engraftment, inhibiting sickle erythropoiesis, and limiting disease- relate d organ toxicity in 
patients at high risk for morbidity and mortality associated with SCD.  The donor of choice is an unrelated adult bone marrow (BM) donor who is HLA- matched at [ADDRESS_648711] of tacrolimus or cyclosporine in combination with short course methotrexate (MTX) and methylprednisolone/  
prednisone.  Post -transplant supportive care will include infection surveillance and prophylaxis, 
and disease- specific supportive care.  
 2.2. Hypothesis and Study Objectives  
 2.2.1. Primary Hypothesis 
 A preparative regimen that provides intense host immunosuppression without myeloablation will promote stable engraftment of unrelated donor hematopoietic cells, inhibit sickle erythropoiesis, 
and result in an event free survival of ≥  75% of children with SCD. 
 
2.2.2. Secondary Hypotheses 
 SCD patients who undergo URD HCT following the reduced intensity conditioning regimen described in this study will have stable donor -derived hematopoiesis and immune reconstitution 
with acceptable rates of acute and chronic GVHD and TRM.  QOL following URD HCT will be superior to QOL prior to HCT.  Neurocognitive function will not be adversely affected by [CONTACT_417929]  2.2.3. Primary Objective  
 To determine event -free survival at [ADDRESS_648712] complications.  Secondary outcome variables include:

2-8 Dose adjustments will be made on the basis of toxicity and tacrolimus levels.  Once the patient can tolerate oral medications and has a normal gastro -intestinal transit time, tacrolimus will be 
converted to an oral form.  Tacrolimus dosing will be monitored and altered as clinically appropriate.  From Day 100 to 180, tacrolimus will be gradually tapered in patients without significant acute or chronic GVHD (taper approximately 5- 10% per week).  
 Alternately, cyclosporine (CSA) may be administered beginning on Day –3 and doses will be 
adjusted to maintain a level of 250- 500 ng/mL by [CONTACT_331265] (or 100- 250 ng/mL by [CONTACT_504047]).  CSA can be administered by [CONTACT_333429].  
 
Dose adjustments will be made on the basis of toxicity and CSA levels.  Once the patient can 
tolerate oral medications and has a normal gastro -intestinal transit time, CSA will be converted 
to an oral form, preferably microemulsion, at 2 -3x the current IV dose.  CSA dosing will be 
monitored and altered as clinically appropriate.    Patients will receive CSA until Day +100 and tapered between Days 100 to 180.  If there is no 
GVHD, the dose will be tapered 10% per week beginning on Day 100.   Centers will declare their preferences of tacrolimus or cyclosporine.  However, in the event of toxicity, centers may change calcineurin inhibitors.  [IP_ADDRESS]. Methylprednisolone/prednisone 
 Starting on Day 7, methylprednisolone 1.0 mg/kg/day intravenous (IV) or prednisone  1.2 mg/kg/day (orally [PO]) will be administered in two divided doses daily and continued until Day 28.  In the absence of GVHD, prednisone will be tapered 20% per week.  [IP_ADDRESS]. Methotrexate  
 Methotrexate will be given at a dosage of 7.5 mg/m
2 IV on Day s 1, 3, and 6.  The Day 1 dose of 
methotrexate should not be administered until 24 hours following completion of the marrow infusion.  Leucovorin rescue may be used per institutional practice guidelines.   Methotrexate dose will be adjusted as follows:

 Serum magnesium level should be maintained > 1.5 mg/dL during the period of treatment with 
calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine or tacrolimus to reduce the risk of seizures.  2.6.4. Blood Pressure Monitoring and Control 
 Blood pressure should be strictly controlled to prevent CNS toxicity.  Blood pressure should be 
monitored closely (every four hours) and both systolic and diastolic hypertension should be treated promptly to maintain blood pressure  within 10% above the baseline age -related median 
systolic and diastolic pressure as described in children with SCD in Pegelow et al Am J Med

G-CSF (5 µ g/kg/day) will be given subcutaneously or IV starting Day 7, after completion of  
methotrexate doses.  G -CSF will be continued until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is

products should be administered universally,  and CMV negative blood products are 
recommended for CMV sero -negative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
 2.6.7. Treatment of Fever/Infections  
 Patients should be monitored closely for clinical manifestations of infection and treated per institution guidelines with broad spectrum antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal agents.  Early and severe immunosuppression of the patient necessitates prompt and adequate treatment of infections to prevent systemic spread.  Since patients receive alemtuzumab, they are especially susceptible to bacterial and viral infections in the early post-transplant period.

2-11 2.6.8. Infection Surveillance and Prophylaxis 
 [IP_ADDRESS]. HSV prophylaxis  
 Acyclovir prophylaxis is recommended for 6 months for patients who are sero- positive for HSV 
or VZV.  If unable to tolerate PO medications, IV therapy will be necessary.   [IP_ADDRESS]. PCP prophylaxis 
 Trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole or an equivalent drug should be administered beginning after 
neutrophil recovery and continued post-transplant for 1 year.   [IP_ADDRESS]. Fungal prophylaxis 
 Due to the level of immune suppression, anti -fungal prophylaxis against Aspergillus sp. is 
recommended with agents such as itraconazole, voriconazole, or posaconazole until Day 180.  Frequent monitoring of tacrolimus or CSA levels will be necessary during azole therapy to avoid toxic drug levels.   [IP_ADDRESS]. Bacterial prophylaxis 
 Prophylaxis against bacterial infections is recommended with a broad spectrum antibiotic such as ciprofloxacin after alemtuzumab administration to Day 180.   [IP_ADDRESS]. CMV surveillance  
 All r
ecipi[INVESTIGATOR_503984] a week after commencing 
alemtuzumab until Day 100.  From Day [ADDRESS_648731] twice monthly.  Antiviral therapy for CMV reactivation should commence pre -emptively if 
CMV testing reveals a high or rising viral load.  If CMV reactivation occurs at or before engraftment, foscarnet may be considered to prevent marrow suppression.  [IP_ADDRESS].
 Adenovirus and EBV intervention guidelines 
 Adenovirus:  Testing for adenovirus infection in the blood by [CONTACT_331270][INVESTIGATOR_331206], hepatic dysfunction, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_037].  If an active systemic infection is diagnosed, therapy should be instituted with cidofovir or other active agents per institution guidelines.  EBV:  
Patients will have EBV DNA quantitative PCR testing on peripheral blood every two weeks 
from Day 14 to Day 100.  In the event of persistent EBV viremia or signs/symptoms consistent with EBV -related PTLD (adenopathy, fever, etc.) therapy with rituximab is recommended. 
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Pediatric URD Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol [ADDRESS_648732] or Donor Cellular Infusion 
 A second transplant or donor cellular infusion (DCI) should not be considered unless the patient has < 20% donor chimerism.  If donor chimerism declines to less than 20% then the patient may be treated per institutional guidelines.  
 2.6.11. Supportive Care Guidelines for CNS Toxicities 
 Patients with sickle cell disease and cerebral vasculopathy have a high incidence of new CNS 
toxicities (seizures, labile hypertension, RPLS, PRES, intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, etc.) 
during the entire transplant process, beginning with the conditioning regimen and lasting through 
the time that immunosuppression is eventually discontinued.  In or der to minimize or avoid these 
risks, adherence to the following guidelines is  necessary for all BMT CTN # 0601 patients: 
1. The baseline blood pressure in patients with sickle cell disease is oft en less than “normal” 
for age.  Elevations in blood pressure can ensue following fluid infusions, or with the use 
of medications such as corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, even after short term use.  Blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) should be monitored closely (at least 
every 4 hours) and strictly  maintained within 10% above the median baseline blood 
pressure documented for that age in Pegelow et al Am J Med 1997;  102: 171-77 (see 
section 2.6.4 for table).  Aggressive (and often parenteral) use of anti -hypertensive drugs 
will be required to control elevations in blood pressure.  In addition, close attention 
should be paid to fluid balance since fluid overload (patient weight is > 10% of base weight in euvolemic state at the time of admission to the BMT unit) may contribute to elevations in blood pressure. 
2. Seizure prophylaxis should be commenced with conditioning therapy i.e., from the date of the first alemtuzumab infusion (the test dose) and continued at least until immunosuppression is withdrawn.  If neurontin is used as the prophylactic antiseizure medication, it is recommended that it be started several days before the test dose of alemtuzumab so that the patient can be on the full dose by [CONTACT_504048].  
3. Platelet counts should be monitored frequently after starting the conditioning therapy (including alemtuzumab) and platelet transfusions should be administered as needed to 
keep levels > 50,000/ µL.

  Version 11.0 dated June 4, 2014  
 
 
2-13 2.7. Toxicities  
 2.7.1. Pancytopenia 
 The administration of fludarabine and melphalan is expected to produce pancytopenia with ANC < 500/μL, hemoglobin < 7- 8 gram/dL and platelet < 50,000/μL for at least a week in many 
patients.  Most patients will require transfusions of red blood cells and platelets during this period.  In addition, many patients will develop fever and approximately 30% will develop a documented infection during the period of neutropenia.  Complications related to pancytopenia may be life -threatening or fatal.  
 2.7.2. Alemtuzumab  
 
Administration can cause fevers, rigors, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, fatigue, rash, urticaria, 
dyspnea, headache, cough, pruritis, diarrhea, pain, anorexia, increased sweating, sepsis, myalgia, 
asthenia, hypertension, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, back pain, dizziness, anemia, infections, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. 
• F
ever and chills :  These are regularly observed, particularly during initial infusions of 
alemtuzumab.  They probably result from a breakdown of cells binding the antibody. 
• Skin rash and itc hing:  A complication that is probably due to minor allergic reactions to 
the antibody.  These symptoms will usually be prevented by [CONTACT_333437] -
histamines as well as with concomitant administration of corticosteroids.  
• Anaphylaxis :   A rare  but severe allergic reaction which may cause a life threatening drop 
in blood pressure, wheezing and difficulty breathing, and severe hives or skin exfoliation.  
This complication can be treated with anti-histamines and steroids. 
• Platelet and white cell c o unt depression:  These are frequently observed and are probably 
caused by [CONTACT_333438].  Platelet transfusions will be administered to reduce the chance of bleeding or life threatening hemorrhage. 
 2.7.3.
 Fludarabine 
 Admin istration can cause hemolytic anemia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, low blood counts 
secondary to bone marrow suppression, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, skin rash, pneumonitis, edema, fever, chills, fatigue, blurred vision, peripheral neuropat hy, confusion, 
coma, decreased immunity , and rarely encephalopathy (in very high doses). 
 2.7.4. Melphalan  
 Administration can cause decreased blood counts, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, oral ulcers, decreased immunity, sterility, interstitial pneumonitis, lung fibrosis, allergic reactions , and rarely 
seizures (with very high doses).   
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Pediatric URD Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol [ADDRESS_648733] infusion, patients will be hydrated before and after administration of allogeneic BM, and will be monitored closely before, during, and after infusion.  2.7.6. Growth Factor or G-CSF (Filgrastim, Neupogen) 
 G-CSF may cause: bone pain, insomnia, headaches, dyspnea, body aches, rash, fever, 
splenomegaly allergic reaction, fatigue, edema, and nausea/vomiting.  2.7.7. Tacrolimus  
 Tacrolimus can cause predisposition to infection, renal insufficiency, hypertension, choles tatic 
hepatic toxicity, gingival hyperplasia, thrombotic microangiopathy, seizures, tremors, hirsutism, anorexia, nausea , and possibly later B -cell lymphomas.  To reduce the risk of toxicity, blood 
pressure, tacrolimus levels, renal function, and liver enzymes will be monitored closely and vital 
signs aggressively maintained at baseline.  2.7.8. Cyclosporine 
 Cyclosporine may cause: nephrotoxicity, seizures, hypertension, hirsutism, thrombotic microangiopathy, electrolyte imbalances, paresthesias/neuropathy, gingival hyperplasia, transient -blindness, and hepatic dysfunction. 
 2.7.9. Methylprednisolone and Prednisone 
 Methylprednisolone and prednisone can cause predisposition to infection, electrolyte disturbances, gastritis with GI bleeding, insomnia and mental status changes, fluid retention, edema, fat accumulation causing a change in facial appearance, and aseptic necrosis.  To reduce 
the risk of steroid toxicity, the medication will be tapered early per protocol in the absence of GVHD.   
 2.7.10. Methotrexate  
 The most methotr exate sensitive organs are the bone marrow and the gastrointestinal mucosa, so 
that myelosuppression and stomatitis are the most common dose -limiting side effects.  At the 
dosage used in this study, no other significant side effects are anticipated.

allotransplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].)  Enrollment on BMT CTN #[ADDRESS_648757] also be submitted for all patients enrolled on this trial.  CIBMTR forms will be submitted directly to the CIBMTR at the times specified on the Form Submission Schedule. 
 
Weekly GVHD Monitoring:   GVHD should be monitored in accordance wit h BMT CTN 
guidelines as specified in the Manual of Procedures.  Patients should be assessed weekly until Day [ADDRESS_648758] -transplant for GVHD.  After Day 100 patients will be assessed at each follow -up 
visit (Day 180, 365, and 730) for the presence of GVHD.    4.3.2. Adverse Event Reporting 
 Unexpected, grade 3 -5 adverse events (AE) will be reported through an expedited AE reporting 
system via AdvantageEDC.  Unexpected, grade 4- [ADDRESS_648759] be reported within three business days of knowledge of the event.  Expected AEs will be reported using NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 at regular intervals as defined on the Form Submission Schedule.  Serious Adverse Events will be consistent with BMT CTN procedures (BMT CTN Admini strative Manual of Procedures, Chapter 6) and reported through an expedited Adverse 
Event (AE) reporting system.  Serious and unexpected Grades [ADDRESS_648760] BMT CTN Unexpected Grade 3- 5 Adverse Event reporting, all 
central nervous system (CNS) events, or events requiring intensive care (ICU) or advanced care interventions are required to be reported via the Unexpected Grade 3- 5 Adverse Event forms in 
AdvantageEDC for this study.  All event reporting is to be expedited.  Grade 4 -5 events should 
be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  Grade 3 events should be reported within three business days of the event. 
 
For the purposes of this protocol, examples of “ICU” or “advanced care treatment” are one or more of the following:

to be reported via the Unexpected Grade [ADDRESS_648761] Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol [ADDRESS_648762] to this trial.  
 5.1.4. Primary Endpoint 
 The primary objective is to assess event -free survival (EFS) probability [ADDRESS_648763] is where the EFS probability is 75%, which is the anticipated 1 year EFS probability based on the available data showing that EFS for HLA- matched sibling donor transplants for SCD is 85%.
  
 For this setting, the confidence interval length is 31%.  The percentages above and below 75% are meant to represent other plausible EFS percentages.

 5.3. Interim Analysis and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_503989] (overall mortality, graft rejection, and GVHD) will be 
conducted.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_130015] a trigger for consultation with the DSMB for additional review.  A truncated Sequential Probabil ity Ratio Test (SPRT) for a binomial outcome will be used to 
monitor each type of toxicity as described below.  This sequential testing procedure conserves type I error across all of the monitoring looks for each toxicity, but not across the three toxicity  
outcomes.  Thus for a single toxicity the type I error is approximately 10%, and across all the toxicities, the study -w i d e  t y p e  I  e r r o r  i s  <  3 0 % .   A  t y p e  I  e r r o r  r a t e  o f  1 0 %  p e r  t o x i c i t y  w a s  
selected to be more conservative with regard to the safety of a new treatment in a less well studied disease indication.  The rationale for not conserving type I error across multiple toxicities is twofold.  First, adjusting the size of the test for multiple comparisons would reduce statistical power to detect adverse outcomes, which seems imprudent.  Secondly, the procedure is a guideline for requiring additional review by [CONTACT_39109], and is not a formal “stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]” that would mandate automatic closure of study enrollment.    The SPRT can be represented graphically.  At each interim analysis, the total number of patients enrolled is plotted against the total number of patients who have experienced toxicity.  The continuation region of the SPRT is defined by [CONTACT_110893].  Only the upper boundary will be used for monitoring the study to protect against high incidences of toxicity.  If the graph falls above the upper boundary, the SPRT rejects the null hypothesis  and concludes that the toxicity 
rate is higher than predicted by [CONTACT_98395].  Otherwise, the SPRT continues until enrollment reaches the target goal.

The usual measures of performance of an SPRT are the error probabilities α  and β of rejecting 
H0 when θ = θ0 and of accepting H 1 when θ = θ1, respectively, and the expected sample size 
E(N|θI).  Note that since the test uses only the upper boundary, and is truncated by a finite 
sample size, the size of the test will be slightly lower than the nominal level given %.  The tests 
to be used in this protocol were developed from SPRT’s described in more detail in the following subsections.    5.3.1. Overall Mortality  
 Overall mortality in this trial is projected to be ≤ 15% at 100 days.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_503990] 100 day overall mortality rate exceeds 15% based on the truncated SPRT.  This truncated SPRT is based on contrasting 15% versus 30% 100 day mortality, with nominal type I and II errors of 14% and 10%, respectively.  The common slope of the parallel lines is 0.219 and the intercept for the upper boundary is 2.097.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_503991].

 The testing procedure for overall mortality rejects the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative 8% of the time when the true 100 day overall mortality rate is 15%, and 85% of the time when 
the rate is 35%.  This corresponds to a type I error rate of α  = 0.08 and a type II error rate of β  =

 Failure to engraft donor cells (defined as <  20% donor chimerism) by [CONTACT_2006] 100 should occur in  
< 20% of patients with this approach.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_503995] 100 graft rejection rate exceeds 20% based on the truncated SPRT.  This 
truncated SPRT is based on contrasting 20% versus 35% Day 100 graft rejection, with nominal

 The testing procedure for graft failure rejects the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative 8% of the time when the true Day 100 graft failure rate is 20%, and 82% of the time when the rate is 
40%.  This corresponds to a type I error rate of α = 0.08 a nd a type II error rate of β  = 0.18.  
When the true Day 100 graft failure rate is 40%, on average, the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_503994] [ADDRESS_648768] been observed in 17 patients.  
 Secondary graft rejection will  be monitored and reported to the DSMB. 
 5.3.3. Grade III- IV Acute GVHD  
 Grade III- IV acute GVHD should occur in ≤ 15% of patients by [CONTACT_2006] 100 with this approach.  
The grade III -IV acute GVHD rates are not expected to differ substantially by [CONTACT_504056], 
so that the monitoring rule will include both stem cell sources together.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_503999] 100 is more than 15% based on the truncated SPRT.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_504000].  5.4. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
 Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all patients.  Characteristics to be examined are: age, gender, stem cell source, performance status, HLA match, disease symptoms, serum bilirubin level, serum creatinine level, pulmonary function tests, cardiac function, donor age, donor gender, donor ethnicity, splenic function, hemoglobin electrophoresis, cerebral MRI, serum ferritin, QOL, neurocognitive function.  5.5. Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
 The primary analysis will consist of estimatin g [ADDRESS_648769] Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol 0601  
  Version 11.0 dated June 4, 2014  
 
 
5-6 calculated.  All transplanted patients will be considered for this analysis.  In addition, the frequencies of each compo nent of the composite endpoint (primary graft failure, secondary graft 
failure, and disease recurrence) will be described.  
 5.6. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 Overall survival:   The survival distribution will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761]- Meier curve.  All 
patients will be followed for a minimum of two years post- transplant for mortality.  
 Incidence of neutrophil and platelet engraftment:  To assess the incidence of each type of engraftment from day of transplant, a cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 
95% confidence interval at [ADDRESS_648770] -transplant.  Death prior to each type of engraftment 
will be considered as a competing risk.  
 
Time to acute GVHD:   To assess the incidence of grades II -IV or grades III- IV acute GVHD 
from day of transplant, the first day of acute GVHD onset at either grades II -IV or grades III- IV 
will be used to calculate a cumulative incidence curve for that acute GVHD grade.  A 95% confide nce interval at [ADDRESS_648771] clinical onset of chronic GVHD:  To assess the incidence and severity of chronic 
GVHD from day of tr ansplant, a cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 95% 
confidence interval at two years post-transplant .  Death prior to occurrence of chronic GVHD 
will be considered as a competing risk.  Transplant -related complications:   The frequency of transplant -related complications, both 
overall and by [CONTACT_504057], will be described using proportions (along with 95% confidence intervals).  Disease -related complications:   The frequency of disease -related complications (stroke) will be 
descr ibed using proportions (along with 95% confidence intervals).  
 Immune reconstitution:  Descriptive statistics will be computed for all the immune reconstitution assays.  Health -related QOL:   Mean QOL scores and confidence intervals will be computed at each  
time point.  For both parent and child reported health- related QOL mean scores, a paired student 
T test will be used to look for differences in mean scores between baseline and [ADDRESS_648772] sizes (or z- scores) will be 
calculated.  This will be done by [CONTACT_504058] -up scores and dividing by [CONTACT_334239].  
Domain scores will also be c ompared between baseline and [ADDRESS_648773] Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol 0601  
  Version 11.0 dated June 4, 2014  
 
 
5-7  Pearson correlation coefficients will be used to determine the association between child and parent health -related QOL scores.  Fisher’s z- transformation will be used to test whether this 
correlation is significantly different from [ADDRESS_648774] the difference between the mean CHQ 
scores of the child and parent at each time point.   Neurocognitive evaluation:   All patients will be assessed with a cognitive battery at study entry 
and 2- year follow -up.  The major indicator of cognitive loss will be decline in general 
intellectual abilities (IQ) as assessed by [CONTACT_139820] (WASI) or Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WIPPSI -III).   
 Other secondary outcomes, including the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function 
(BRIEF) Continuous Performance Test Second Edition (CPT -II), VMI, Children’s Memory 
Scale (CMS), and [LOCATION_004] Verbal Learning Test (CVLTC) will be compared in the same 
manner by [CONTACT_504059] t -score for each age- appropriate cognitive domain test over 
time.  
 A paired t -test will be used to assess the change from baseline in WASI IQ and change from 
baseline in BRIEF and other age -appropriate tests T -Scores over time.  In addition to using 
statistical techniques to evaluate changes in IQ, clinical significance will also be evaluated.  
 Functional scores and confidence intervals will be computed at each time point in age -
appropriate fashion.  Mixed models for repeated measures data will be used to assess whether functional scores change significantly after transplant over time.   Secondary analysis of the secondary outcome will be performed.  This secondary analysis will be an adjustment of the secondary study outcome for potential confounding factors (e.g., adjust the secondary study outcome for confounding factors such as gender, age, medical history,  
co-morbidities, etc.).  Since the secondary study outcome is a continuous measure, we will be 
able to make these adjustments with the use of generalized linear models (e.g., analysis of covariance).  Generalized lin ear models can help to determine whether the apparent effect of one 
variable (e.g., treatment) on the outcome of interest (e.g., the mean change from baseline of IQ after 2 -years of follow -up) is accounted for by [CONTACT_504060] (e.g., 
treatment compliance, gender, age, medical history, co- morbidities, etc.).  
 5.7. Safety Analysis 
 The DSMB will review the study for safety endpoints at least twice per year or more often if stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_504001].  Accrual will not stop during this evaluation.  The reporting of serious adverse events will be consistent with standard BMT CTN procedures.  The type and severity of adverse events will be analyzed.  
   
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Pediatric URD Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol [ADDRESS_648775] the conference.  All potential risks associa ted with the 
use of conditioning regimen and GVHD prophylaxis medications should be discussed as objectively as possible.   
 
The consent document should be reviewed with the patient and family prior to proceeding to transplantation.  Informed consent from the patient and the patient’s parent/guardian will be obtained using a form approved by [CONTACT_504061].   2. Confidentiality  
 Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_29072] a patient identifier code.  The code linking the patient’s identity with the ID code will be kept separately at the center.  The ID code will be transmitted to the BMT CTN Dat a Coordinating Center upon 
enrollment.  
 3. Participation of Women and Minorities and Other Populations  
 Women and ethnic minorities and other populations will be included in this study.  Accrual of women and minorities at each center will be monitored to determine whether their rates of enrollment are reflective of the distribution of potentially eligible women and minorities expected from data reported to the CIBMTR.  Centers will be notified if their rates differ significantly from those expected and asked to develop appropriate recruitment strategies.  It is expected that the number of minority patients on this study will be large given the disease being studied.  4. Ethical Considerations  Patients are referred to the Transplant Center for consideration of hematopoietic cell transplantation.  While there will be every effort to seek out and include females and minority patients, the patient population is dependent upon the referral pattern and the ability to identify suitable donors.  Female  and minority patients are eligible for all aspects of the study and their 
participation will be actively encouraged .

B-2 Informed Consent to Participate in Research  
 
Unrelated Donor Reduced Intensity Bone Marrow Transplant for Children  
with Severe Sickle Cell Disease  
 
 
This is a clinical trial, which is a research study to answer specific medical questions.   
The information from this study may also help future patients.  The Study doctor (the 
person in charge of the research) will explain the study to you and your child.  This 
research study will include only people who choose to take part.  Please take your time to 
make your decision about allowing your child to take part.  You may discuss your decision 
with family and friends.  You and your child should also discuss this with your child’s 
health care team.  If you, or your child, have any questions, you and your child can ask the 
Study doctor for more explanation.  
 
 
This is a consent for a research study.  Your child is being invited to participate in this study 
because your child has severe sickle cell disease that may be treated with a bone marrow transplant.  This form is intended to give you and your child information to help you decide if you and your child want to participate in this study.  You should read this form and ask any questions you or your child may have before agreeing to be in the study.    Children with sickle cell disease are born with a defect i n hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein 
in red blood cells that carries oxygen to vital organs such as the brain, heart, lungs and kidneys.  Defective hemoglobin damages red blood cells and makes them sticky.  This causes them to look like a sickle.  The dam aged or sickled red blood cells can block blood flow in blood vessels and 
block oxygen and nutrients from reaching organs.  As a result almost all the organs in the body can be damaged but it is especially bad when vital organs are involved.  When the flow  of blood 
is blocked in a blood vessel in the brain, a stroke occurs.  When blood flow is blocked in a bone or muscle, this causes severe pain.  If it occurs in the lung, this complication is called acute chest syndrome and causes chest pain and a low oxygen level.  Sickle cell disease can also cause anemia.  
 It is possible to replace the defective red blood cells with normal blood cells in children with severe sickle cell disease by [CONTACT_746] a bone marrow transplant.  We know this from recent studies where bone marrow from a brother or sister has replaced the defective sickled red cells after transplantation.  Blood vessels are no longer blocked, and the anemia goes away.    However, a bone marrow transplant is an intensive medical procedure and there ar e serious risks 
involved.  Therefore, it is usually offered only to children who have had severe complications of sickle cell disease such as stroke, frequent painful crises, or repeated epi[INVESTIGATOR_325848].  In most cases, it is offered only to children who have a healthy brother or sister who

  Version 11.0 dated June 4, 2014  
 
 
B-3 is HLA- identical, which means that the donor has the same ‘tissue’ type as the person receiving 
the transplant.    Most children with severe sickle cell disease do not receive a transplant because they do not have the same tissue type as their healthy brothers or sisters.  These children are often treated with medicines and regular red blood cell transfusions for many years to try to control symptoms and organ damage.  However, in children with sickle cel l disease who have had a stroke, 20% (1 in 
5) will develop a second stroke and, of that group, 30% (1 in 3) children will develop a third stroke even if they are receiving regular blood transfusions.    Cells in the bone marrow that make healthy red cells are called blood stem cells.   This study is a clinical trial for children with severe sickle cell disease that do not have a brother 
or sister with the same tissue type who can serve as their donor.  Although previous studies have 
shown that a bone marrow  transplant is possible for patients with a healthy related bone marrow 
donor, this study will determine if this is a good treatment option for patients transplanted with cells from an unrelated donor.  Patients who participate in this study will also receive lower intensity treatment (conditioning) before transplant with bone marrow donated by a healthy adult donor.  This lowered intensity conditioning treatment (reduced intensity conditioning regimen – RIC) is 
being used to decrease the side effects or to xicities of the conditioning treatment.  It is not known 
whether this RIC will be successful in allowing donor cells to settle in the patient and grow successfully.  This is the research question that is being asked in this study.  Before you decide whether or not to have your child join the study, please read all the information in this consent form.  Feel free to ask questions to understand your child’s rights and protections.  The choice to take part in this study is completely voluntary.  Sponsor and source of funding:  
This study is sponsored by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH) and the National Marrow Donor Program® who is the primary source of funding.  Additional NIH sponsors include the Sickle Cell Disease Clinical Research Network (SCD -CRN) an d the National Center on Minority 
Health and Health Disparities .  The NIH is a government program that funds the Blood and 
Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN), a group of transplant programs conducting research in transplantation for severa l diseases including severe sickle cell disease.

B-4 If you decide to allow your child to take part in this research study:  
• You or your child’s insurance company will be responsible for all medical bills from your child’s transplant.  
• You or your child will not pay for any extra tests that are being done for the study (these are lab tests, scans and other special tests that are not part of regular, routine care).  The extra research tests that are being done for this study are a blood test to measure fun ction 
of the spleen, a special scan of the brain called an MRA/MRI (magnetic resonance angiography and imaging after injection of contrast), measurement of brain function using performance tests that are age -dependent, and question sheets that measure qual ity 
of life.  The tests that measure learning and brain function will be done before transplant and again 2 years after transplant.  Quality of Life question/answer sheets will be completed before transplant and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after transplant.  
• You or your child will not be paid to take part in this study.  
 If you decide not to allow your child to participate in this study,  your child’s study doctor 
will discuss other treatment options with you.  What other choices does your child have if your ch ild does not take part in the study?  
Your child’s other choices may include: 
• Treatment with drugs such as hydroxyurea that may lessen complications of severe sickle cell disease. 
• Experimental treatments with new drugs for severe sickle cell disease. 
• A tran splant using bone marrow without being part of this study where the choice of 
medicines before and after transplant, and other guidelines may be different. 
• Other treatments such as regular RBC transfusions to try to control symptoms related to 
your child’s  severe sickle cell disease. However, RBC transfusion therapy may not 
prevent further strokes in all children who have had an initial stroke.  
 
It is important that you talk to your child’s study doctor about your child’s treatment choices before you decide to have your child participate in this study.  Why is this study being done?  
This study is being done to determine if blood cell transplants, with bone marrow from unrelated donors, are effective in children with severe sickle cell disease and if this treatment approach has acceptable risks and side effects.  The study will also look into the risk of death associated with this treatment approach and if it is acceptable considering the potential benefit of avoiding the long- term consequences of severe sickle cell disease.  Transplant studies for sickle cell disease 
have previously used high dose chemotherapy to prepare patients for transplant (myeloblative 
conditioning).  This has been successful mostly in patients who had tissue -matched family 
members  such as brothers or sisters, as donors.  In this study, the success of transplant for sickle 
cell disease is being measured after using reduced intensity conditioning treatment to reduce 
toxicities of treatment using tissue -matched unrelated donor cells.  This is being done to try to 
avoid the toxicities of more intense conditioning treatment.

B-5 This research study is being done to answer the following questions: 
• Is it safe to transplant children who have severe sickle cell disease with bone marrow from a healthy, unrelated donor? 
• Are the drugs given to patients in this study (reduced intensity conditioning) effective in destroying sickle cells and allowing blood cells from a healthy donor to grow in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]?  
• After transplant, will children with sickl e cell disease make healthy red blood cells and 
avoid the health problems caused by [CONTACT_504062]?  
• After transplant, will children with sickle cell disease experience any side effects that shorten their life or worsen their quality of life?   
 How ma ny children will take part in the study?  
Thirty (30)  children in the U.S. will take part in this study.  To be part of the study your child 
must:  
• Be between the ages of 3 and 19 years  
• Have severe sickle cell disease with one or more of the following sickle cell 
complications: 
o Stroke or other severe sickle cell disease complication affecting the brain  
o Repeated acute chest syndrome epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], despi[INVESTIGATOR_2391]  
o Repeated severe pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_504002]  
• Not have a healthy brother or sister who has the same tissue type who is able and willing 
to donate 
• Have an acceptable unrelated marrow donor available  
• Provide a signed consent for participation in the study (your child signs an assent form if they are old enough to understand the risks and benefits) 
 What will happen if your child takes part in this research study?    Before the transplant:  
The first step in considering your child for an unrelated blood or marrow transplant is to have an eligibility review panel (a group of 5 sickle cell disease experts and blood and marrow transplant physicians unconnected with this trial) review your child’ s medical history.  Once they have 
confirmed that your child is eligible for this trial we will proceed with the pre -transplant work-up 
and research tests listed below.  In the unlikely event that they determine that your child is not eligible for this trial, your doctor will discuss other transplant and treatment options with you.  
 The following research tests will be performed:  
• Question/answer sheets to measure quality of life before transplant.  
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_504003].  
• Special tests of learning and brain function called ‘Neurocognitive testing’.  These tests are done to learn about any effects of sickle cell disease on brain function before the transplant, and compare 2 y ears after transplant to see if there is a change.  
• MRA and MRI tests before transplant will be performed as part of the research for this 
study.

  Version 11.0 dated June 4, 2014  
 
 
B-6  These tests will be done as an outpatient before the transplant over the course of several days.    
 To help with the administration of medicines, blood transfusions and obtaining blood for lab tests, a central venous catheter (also known as a ‘Hickman’ or ‘Broviac’ catheter) will be placed before the transplant.  This is a hollow tube that is inserted by a surgeon or radiologist usually in the operating room.  The doctor performing the procedure will explain it in more detail before the procedure.  Your child’s anesthesiologist will describe the risks of a general anesthetic.  The tube is placed in the chest and allows medicines, transfusions, etc. to be given painlessly into the vein without the need for repeated sticking of needles in your child’s arms.  Once the central venous catheter is placed, it will need daily care at home with cleaning and injection of medications to prevent catheter -related blood clots.   
 
Transplant/conditioning: 
Conditioning is the chemotherapy and other medicines given to prepare your child to receive donor cells.  It prevents your child’s immune system from rejecting donor cells.  Conditioning will start 22 days before transplant.  The medicines used are alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and melphalan.  Alemtuzumab will be given intravenously (through your child’s central venous catheter) once a day for 3 days (after a small test dose) beginning [ADDRESS_648777] to proceed.  Your child will be admitted during alemtuzumab infusions and may be discharged if well the day after the infusions are completed.  Next, your child will return to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504004] 8 days before the transplant.  Fludarabine will be given intravenously once a day for 5 days.  Finally, melphalan will be given intravenously 3 days before the transplant.  This will be followed by 2 “rest days” when your child will not receive any chemotherapy.

Transplant day  Bone  marrow infusion  
 Bone marrow  transplant: 
Your child will be given the marrow transplant on Day 0.  The donated marrow will come from a suitably tissue -matched unrelated person.  The donor cells will be given through the central 
venous catheter, in a manner similar to a blood transfusion. 
 
Immunosuppression to prevent graft -versus -host disease (GVHD):  
Three days before the transplant, your child will begin to receive medicines to hold back the immune system and these medicines will continue after the transplant.  This may make your child develop more infections than usual.  However, these drugs are important to allow donor cells to accept their new role and to lower the chance of their injuring your child’s organs by [CONTACT_504063] -versus- host disease (GVHD).  GVHD is an attack by [CONTACT_504064]’s body.  GVHD is discussed in greater detail below.  Your child will receive one or more standard drugs to prevent GVHD and these will be given for at least 6 months after the transplant.  These drugs include tacrolimus (also called FK 506 or Prograf®), methylprednisolone or prednisone, methotre xate, and cyclosporine (also called Gengraf® or 
Neoral®) and may be used in different combinations.   Choice of drugs may depend on the preference of the transplant team at your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Post-transplant follow- up and care:  
The conditioning regimen will destroy your child’s blood and marrow cells.  This will cause low counts of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.  Blood stem cells from the donor will produce new blood cells to replace the destroyed recipi[INVESTIGATOR_504005].  To speed this process along after the transplant, your child will receive granulocyte -colony- stimulating factor (also called G -
CSF or Neupogen).  G -CSF is a natural protein made in the body that increases the white blood 
cell count and that is used to help protect against infections.  Your child will start receiving G -
CSF one week after the transplant.  It is given either by [CONTACT_504065].  Your child will receive it daily until the white blood cell count has recovered.

B-9 Can your child stop being in the study?  
You can decide to stop your child’s participation at any time.  Tell your child’s doctor if you or your child are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_59917].  The doctor will tell you and your child how to stop safely.  It is important to note that once your child receives the medicines for the conditioning regimen, he/she must receive the unrelated donor marrow in order for the blood counts to recover in a timely fashion.    If you decide to withdraw your child, or your child’s doctor withdraws your child from the study, we will ask your permission to use all the information about your child that has already been collected as part of the study.  We will also ask your permission to continue to allow your child’s doctor to tell us about his/her progress until at least two years post-transplant.  You can choose to give or not to give this permission.

B-12 Potential Risk of RPLS/PRES   
The Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network is a group of transplant, sickle cell disease and other experts that ensure the safety of patients treated on this and other trials.  This group carefully monitors the experience of 
patients to make sure that the side effects that they experience are not unusual or more frequent or more severe than would be expected.   The DSMB has noted that children transplanted on the clinical trial BMT CTN [ADDRESS_648783] a higher than expected occurrence of a usually uncommon (<  5%) complication called reversible 
posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) also known as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).  Patients with RPLS/PRES have confusion and other c hanges 
in their ability to think.  Sometimes, they experience seizures, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_333397], rarely, loss of 
consciousness.  RPLS is diagnosed with an MRI of the brain.  It is a disorder that is sometimes 
seen in patients with sickle cell disease even if they do  not have a transplant.  In transplant 
patients, it is usually caused by [CONTACT_504066].  It can often, but not always, be prevented by [CONTACT_333451].  It 
is treated by [CONTACT_333452], controlling blood pressure and/or giving 
anti-seizure medicines.  About a quarter of the patients on BMT CTN [ADDRESS_648784] developed 
RPLS/PRES; all were successfully treated for this complication.  Thus far, no RPLS/PRES has 
been observed in any patient more than [ADDRESS_648785] high blood pressure are more likely to develop RPLS/PRES.  If your child experiences any of these side effects or changes in mental status, you should contact [CONTACT_51443]’s transplant physician right away, since early treatment is important.  It is also important that any blood pressure medication be taken as prescribed to decrease the risk of RPLS/PRES.    
 RISKS AND TOXICITIES RELATED TO STANDARD TRANSPLANT PROCEDURES  
 Graft -versus -Host Disease (GVHD):   This condition results from white cells called T cells in 
the donor’s bone marrow cells recognizing your child’s body as foreign and attacking it.  Your child is more likely to get GVHD if the donor’s tissue type does not match your child’s tissue type well.    There are two forms of GVHD: acute GVHD (usually occurs in the first 3 months afte r 
transplant) and chronic GVHD (usually occurs later and lasts longer).  Acute GVHD may produce skin rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abnormalities of liver function and an increased risk of infection.  Chronic GVHD may produce skin rashes, hair loss, thickened skin, joint stiffness, dry eyes, dry mouth, liver disease, weight loss, diarrhea and an increased risk of infection.  To confirm the diagnosis of acute or chronic GVHD, your child may be asked to have a skin biopsy (i.e., taking a small sample of skin tissue to look at under the microscope) and possibly an intestinal biopsy and rarely a liver biopsy.  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Pediatric URD Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol 0601  
  Version 11.0 dated June 4, 2014  
 
 
B-13 There is a 10 -20% chance that your child will develop GVHD after the transplant.  Your child 
will be watched closely for this complication and given treatment to treat it further if it occurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_504006].  In most cases, GVHD can be successfully treated.  If 
GVHD does not respond to the medicines listed above, treatment can involve combinations of many other medicines with different side effects.  Treatment may be necessary for many years as 
GVHD symptoms can last for many months or years.  Prolonged treatment for chronic GVHD can result in a weak immune system and infections and may need frequent medical care and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Sometimes GVHD is severe or difficult to treat and may lead to death.

  Damage to the vital organs in your body.  The conditioning or GVHD treatment could result in problems in the heart, lungs, liver, intestine, kidneys and bladder, brain etc.  Lung problems can be the result of infections or chemotherapy.  Some patients can have veno- occlusive disease of 
the liver  (VOD).  This complication usually results from high doses of chemotherapy.  Patients 
with VOD become jaundiced (yellowish skin), have liver function abnormalities, fluid retention, abdominal swelling, and abdominal pain.  If organ damage symptoms are severe, your child may have to stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504007] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504008].  Although many patients 
recover completely, these complications may cause permanent damage or even death.  
 Serious infections.   Full and complete recovery of your child’s immune system may take many 
months following the initial recovery of your child’s cell counts.  During this time, there is an increased risk of infections.  Your child will be prescribed certain medications to reduce the chance of those infections.  However, preventive treatments are not always effective.  If your child has an infection, he/she may have to stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504007] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504009].  Although most infections can be successfully treated, some infections are fatal.  
 Recurrence of disease and graft rejection.   Since the study uses a conditioning treatment 
regimen of reduced intensity, it may not allow donor cells to grow and your child may partially or fully reject the donor’s bone marrow.  If this happens, your child’s blood cells will grow back again and the severe sickle cell disease may persist or come back even if the transplant is initially successful.  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Pediatric URD Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol [ADDRESS_648786] common complications associated with central venous catheters are blood clots in the catheter and infection.  If clots form, a medicine will be injected to dissolve the clot.  If it cannot dissolve, the catheter may need to be replaced.  Infecti ons will be treated with medicines; sometimes, removal of the infected catheter is required 
and a new catheter will need to be placed.   
 Impact on reproductive hormone function and sexuality.  High doses of chemotherapy can cause sterility (inability to h ave children) and decreased hormone levels.  Some patients with 
chronic GVHD have reported impaired sexual function due to decreased sexual desire and vaginal dryness.  Since the chemotherapy doses used in the preparative regimen for this study are lower, the risk of sterility may be lower.  Some patients treated with this preparative regimen have had children after their transplant.  However, it is difficult to know the exact risk of sterility after transplant with the use of this conditioning regimen.  
 
Risk of death.  Some of the side effects of  an unrelated donor transplant may be very severe and 
may cause death of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_504010].  Though all precautions will be taken to make the transplant as safe as possible for your child, there is still a 10% chance of the patient’s death following unrelated donor transplantation.

Unrelated Donor Reduced Intensity Bone Marrow Transplant for Children  
with Severe Sickle Cell Disease  
 You are being invited to be in a research project.  This research project is about seeing if transplants can help children who have s evere sickle cell disease.  People with sickle cell disease 
do not make healthy red blood cells.  In this research project, doctors will see if a bone marrow transplant can help children with sickle cell disease make healthy red blood cells.  You should talk to your parents about this research project.  If you have questions, ask your parents or your 
doctor. 
 
Before the transplant, your doctors will give you medicines so that your body will let the new cells grow.  These medicines are not as strong as the ones that have been used before and are called reduced intensity medicines.
  The medicines may make you throw up, lose your hair or 
have mouth sores.   
 
After the medicines, you will get a transplant of new cells from an unrelated donor.  An unrelated donor  is a person you do not know.  The cells will come from the donor's bone 
marrow. The cells should make new and healthy red blood cells in your body.  Sometimes the donor’s cells can cause a problem called GHVD.  GVHD can give you diarrhea, a skin rash, or make you not feel hungry.  Your doctors will give you medicines to try to make sure that you don’t get GVHD.  Sometimes the donor cells may not establish themselves and grow in your body.  If donor cells are rejected from your body, your own blood cells will grow again and your sickle cell disease problems will come back.  
 You will stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504017].  After you go home, you will need to go back to see your doctors often.    You don't have to be in this research project.  Your doctors and nurses will not be mad at you if you don't want to be in the research project.  If you decide you don't want to be in this research project, you should talk to your doctor and parents about other things to do for your disease.   Sign your name [CONTACT_504078].  You can keep a copy of this form at home.

Unrelated Donor Reduced Intensity Bone Marrow Transplant for Children  
with Severe Sickle Cell Disease  
 Patients with sickle cell disease have a defect in hemoglobin.  Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells (RBCs) that carries oxygen to vital organs such as the brain, heart, lungs and kidneys.  When hemoglobin is damaged the RBCs are sticky and look like a sickle.  The damaged RBCs 
cannot flow well through blood vessels, and block oxygen and nutrients from reaching organs.  This can damage almost all the organs in the body.  It is especially bad when vital organs are involved.   
 
Recent studies have shown that a bone marrow transplant from a brother or sister can replace the damaged RBCs with healthy red blood cells.  Because of the risks of a bone marrow transplant, transplants are usually only given to patients with severe complications.  Usually a bone marrow transplant is only done if the patient has a brother or sister as a donor who has the same ‘tissue’ type.  Before a transplant, patients receive high doses of chemotherapy called conditioning to allow donor cells to grow in the patient.  Since most patients with severe sickle cell disease do 
not have a brother or sister with the same tissue type, they do not receive a transplant.  These patients often receive medicines and red cell transfusions to try to control symptoms and organ damage.  These treatments may be given for many years.  
 
This is a research study of unrelated donor transplantation in patients with severe sickle cell disease.  There will be as many as [ADDRESS_648789] Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol [ADDRESS_648790] if I do not take part in the study?  
If you decide not to participate in this study, your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you and your parents.  Other choices may include: 
• Treatment with drugs such as hydroxyurea that can lessen complications of severe sickle cell disease  
• Experimental treatments with new drugs for severe sickle cell disease  
• A transplant using bone marrow without being part of this study  
• Other treatments such as regular RBC transfusions to try to control symptoms related to your severe sickle cell disease  
 
Why is this study being done?   This research study is being done to answer the following questions: 
1. Is it safe to do a transplant in patients who have severe sickle cell disease using bone marrow from healthy unrelated donors?   
2. Is a “reduced intensity” transplant effective and safe in performing unrelated donor transplants?  This “reduced intensity” approach will use a new combination of drugs at reduced doses compared to those previously used for traditional transplants.  
3. After the transplant, will the patients with severe sickle cell disease make healthy red blood cells and be protected from health problems of severe sickle cell disease?   
 
What will happen if I take part in this research study?   
 
Before enrolling on study:  
Your doctor will check to see if you have a type matched bone marrow donor available for your transplant.   
 
Before the transplant:  
You will have several tests done to check your organ function.  These tests will check your heart, lungs, and brain. Most of these tests are X -rays or scans, questions, or blood tests.  The doctors 
will look at the results of all the se tests to make sure that it is okay for you to have a transplant.   
 
A central line will be placed in your chest in the operating room (you will be asleep for this).  A central line makes it easier for you to receive drugs and for drawing blood for tests  (you will not 
be poked for blood tests or receive shots).   
 
Preparation for the transplant:  
Before the transplant, you will need to receive medicines so that your body can accept the new bone marrow cells.  This is called a ‘preparative regimen.’  Before the transplant, you will be 
given [ADDRESS_648791] Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol 0601  
  Version 11.0 dated June 4, 2014  
 
 
B-27 These medicines are given to allow the donor cells to grow.  There are many drugs that can be 
used to suppress your immune system.  The names of these medicines are tacrolimus, methylprednisolone/prednisone, methotrexate, and cyclosporine.  
 
Bone marrow - infusion of cells:  
Bone marrow from an unrelated donor will be used for the transplant.  These cells will be given through the central venous catheter, just like a blood transfusion.  On the day of your transplant, the new bone marrow cells will be given through your central line.  
 
Post-transplant follow- up and care:  
After the transplant you will continue to get medicines to help the donor cells grow.  These drugs will also help lower the chance of getting graft versus host disease (GVHD).  GVHD is a complication that happens when the donor’s cells attack your body. You will receive one or more medicines to prevent GVHD.  You will continue to receive these drugs for at least 6 months after the transplant.  
 
You will be in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504018].  You will be allowed to go home from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504019].  After you go home you will need to return to visit your doctors so they can check your recovery.  Your doctors will need to check your blood and bone marrow after the  transplant to make sure the new blood cells are growing in 
your body.  Your doctors will also do blood tests and other tests to make sure your organs are working well. When blood is needed for these tests it will be drawn through the central line.  Can th e doctor who is the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_504020]?   
You can be taken off the study (with or without your consent) for any of the following reasons: 
• You need a medical treatment not allowed in this study 
• The investigator decides that continuing in the study would be harmful to you 
• You become pregnant and the study participation could be harmful to the fetus 
• The study is cancelled by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) or the National Institutes of Health (NIH)  
 
What are the risks of being in this study?  The drugs may cause a skin rash, hair loss, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea and infections. Your blood counts will fall and you may get fevers, infections or start bleeding.  You may also get mouth sores.  These are temporary and you will feel better as your new bone marrow grows.   
 
Since you will not be able to fight infections while your new bone marrow is growing back, you may need to get antibiotics.  You may also need to get blood transfusions since your new bone marrow will not be making new blood cells right away.   
 
Even with medicines to prevent it, you may get GVHD.  This can cause skin rash, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, lung and liver problems, swelling of the hands and feet, dry eyes, stiff joints, and tiredness.  These problems are usually mild but can become very serious and 
prolonged. Medicines are given to prevent GVHD during and after transplant.  If GVHD occurs even after taking these medicines, other medicines will need to be started and hospi [INVESTIGATOR_504021] – Protocol [ADDRESS_648792] to make you feel better and keep you safe.  Often this may require many hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959].  However, it is important to understand that there is a small risk (about a 1 in 10 chance) that you may die as a result of one or more of the complications of unrelated donor transplantation.   
 
It is possible that instead of new bone marrow, your old red blood cells will grow back.  If it does, you will continue to have severe sickle cell disease and its problems.   Are there benefits to taking part in the study?  
You may or may not benefit from taking part in this study.  If the transplant is successful, you may benefit by [CONTACT_504067].  The knowledge gained from this study may help other patients with severe sickl e cell disease.  
 What are your rights if you decide to take part in this study?  It is up to you if you want to participate in this research study.  If you leave the study you can still get medical care from your doctor and transplant center.  You will be  told about new 
information or changes in the study that may affect your health or your willingness to continue in the study.    Will your medical information be kept private?   We will do our best to make sure that the personal information in your medical  record be kept 
private.  However, we cannot guarantee total privacy.  Your personal information may be given out if required by [CONTACT_2371].  If information from this study is published or presented at scientific meetings, your name [CONTACT_3381].

The form is intended to be self completed by [CONTACT_504069].  If the child needs help completing the survey, this should be done with the aid of a research assistant who can read the questions and responses to the child.   The information below from the User’s Manual of the CHQ should aid in administering the questionnaires.   ADMINISTERING THE CHILD HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE  
(From Landgraf, Abetz, and Ware, Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ): A User’s Manual, 1999)  
 The Child Heal th Questionnaire (CHQ) is intended to be completed by [CONTACT_504070].  The administrator should present the importance of the questionnaire and why their responses to the questions will be helpful in understanding the quality of life of children with silent stroke.  The administrator should also ensure the questionnaires are 
completed and done correctly.  The CHQ is designed to be able to be read and understood by [CONTACT_504071] a 3
rd grade reading 
level.  If the person completing the questionnaire is not able to read at this level, the form should be read to them using the interview script designed for the questionnaire (please see Interview Script section).  
 Each questionnaire should contain a unique identifier (this should be the subject’s study ID number) that will be used to keep the information confidential yet linked to each study subject.   
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Pediatric URD Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol [ADDRESS_648800] to them and their families.  The CHQ asks questions about your child’s physical wellness, his/her feelings, behavior, and activities at school and with family and friends.  The 
parent-completed CHQ also asks a few questions about you.  
The CHQ is simple to complete. Be sure to read the instructions [point to them].  The CHQ contains 
que
stions that ask how you feel .  Remember, there are no right or wrong answers.  This is not a test.  
Choose the response that best represents the way you feel. Please do not share or compare responses with your child or other family members.  
 P
lease fill out the questionnaire now.  I will be nearby [CONTACT_240770].  Return 
your completed questionnaire to me. 
 
 
ADMINISTERING AND COMPLETING THE HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE  
 
Provide a firm writing surface such as a clipboard or tabletop.  Provide a number 2 pencil.  
 
When the parent returns the CHQ, check the questionnaire for completeness.  Note whether the questionnaire is complete by [CONTACT_504072].  If it is not complete, bring 
the missing section or questions to the respond ent's attention.  If they chose not to answer a series of 
questions, gently encourage them to do so.  If there are more than half of the items missing for a scale the data will be discarded and it will not be possible to calculate their responses.  If the parent/child has an 
objection or difficulty completing any items or sections, simply record their reason(s) for non- completion.  
Never force someone to answer if they do not feel comfortable doing so on their own 
 
Closing  
 Be sure to put the completed ques tionnaires in a safe and secure place to ensure confidentiality.  
 
Finally, thank the parent using the following exit script (or a variation appropriately reworded to sound 
more like your style of speech): 
 
Thank you for taking the time to complete this questionnaire.  You will complete this questionnaire again at the end of the study. 
 
 
ADDRESSING PROBLEMS AND QUESTIONS  
 
What to do if the CHQ parent doesn’t want to complete the CHQ?  
If the parent is able to self -administer the CHQ but declines to participat e, tell the parent that its 
completion is voluntary.  They are being asked to complete the CHQ because it will provide helpful 
information for clinicians, school nurses, teachers, and others.  The goal is to better understand the 
physical, mental, and soci al health problems of children  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Pediatric URD Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol 0601  
  Version 11.0 dated June 4, 2014  
 
 
F-3 Emphasize that this information is as important as any of the other medical information.  Responses are 
essential so that a complete pi[INVESTIGATOR_504026]'s health and its effect on the parent and family may be obtained.  Emphasize that the CHQ is simple to complete.  Suggest that it is possible that this 
questionnaire is different from others they have filled out in the past, and that they may even enjoy 
completing it.  If parent still declines, retrieve the CHQ, record the r eason for the decline, and thank the 
parent
 
 
What to do if the CHQ parent starts to complete the CHQ, but doesn’t want to finish?  
If non- completion is a result of the parent having trouble understanding particular items, ask the 
parent/child to explain the  difficulty.  Reread the question for them verbatim, but do not rephrase the 
question.   If the parent is still unable to complete the CHQ, accept it as incomplete, and indicate on the 
CHQ itself that the parent was unable to complete the questionnaire due to difficulty understanding 
questions. 
 
I
f the parent is unable to self -administer the questionnaire, document the  reason.   If the reason is health 
related, indicate the specific physical problem/condition.  
 
What to do if the CHQ parent is concerned that s omeone will look at their answers?  
Emphasize that all parents' responses to the CHQ are to be kept confidential.  You are not allowed to read 
the responses other than to check that all responses are answered.  Point out that their names do not 
appear anywhere on the questionnaire, so that their results will be linked with an ID number and not their 
name.  If this is for a clinical study, tell parents that their answers to the questionnaire will be pooled with 
other parents' answers and that they will be ana lyzed as a group rather than as individuals  
 
What to do if the CHQ parent asks the meaning of an item?  
While completing the questionnaire, some parents might ask the meaning of specific items so that they 
can better understand and respond, if this happens, you can assist the parent/child by [CONTACT_144981].  If the parent/child asks you to interpret the meaning of an item, do not try to 
explain it, but suggest that he/she use his/her own interpretation of the question.  All parents should 
answer the questions based on what they think the questions mean.  
 
Sometimes parents may have trouble with the response choices.  They may say "I don't know" or 
something different than what is stated on the questionnaire.  In these circumstances, it is important to 
gently guide the parent to respond in one of the pre -set categories by [CONTACT_240772]: 
 
“I know that it may be hard for you to think this way, but which of these categories most 
closely expresses what you are thinking or feeling?"  
 
If the parent does not like a question, or thinks it is unnecessary or inappropriate, emphasize that all 
questions in the CHQ are very important and included for different reasons.  They should try to answer all 
of the questions.  
 
Rewordi ng items, paraphrasing or interpreting items for the parent can bias results.  Thus, it is important 
that differences in answers due to rewording of items be minimized.  If the parent has difficulty 
completing the CHQ and you feel you cannot address their concerns adequately with the instructions and 
guidance provided, thank them, retrieve the CHQ, and record the difficulty  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Pediatric URD Transplant Severe SCD – Protocol 0601  
  Version 11.0 dated June 4, 2014  
 
 
F-4 What to do if the CHQ parent wants to know the meaning of their answers? 
If a parent asks you to interpret responses or asks for a "score" on the CHQ, tell him/her that you are not 
trained in interpreting or scoring the information. Emphasize that their responses are to be kept 
confidential. You are not allowed to read the responses other than to check that all responses are 
answered.  If this is for a clinical study, tell parents that their answers to the questionnaire will be pooled 
with other parents' answers and that they will be analyzed as a group rather than as individuals.  
 
What to do if the CHQ parent asks why they must fill out the CHQ additional times?  
Optional - only appropriate in situations or studies with multiple administration of the CHQ.  Explain to the parent that the reason they are being asked to complete the CHQ more than once is to determine if the child's health or well -being has changed over time.  Monitoring changes 
provides a more complete and appropriate representation of the child's health and its impact on their everyday functioning and well- being and that of their family

NEUROCOGNITIVE TESTING  
  Neurocognitive assessment: Age -appropriate neurocognitive  evaluation will be performed in all 
patients prior to, and 2 years after transplant to document effects of transplant on cognitive function.  If a patient has crossed age groups between two testing periods, the child  will be 
administered the same battery of tests completed at pre -screening but at the age -appropriate 
level .  Please see the CRFs for the sub tests of each tool. 
 Time scheduled for each assessment: 2 hours 
 
For children ≥ 6 years : Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) (Block Design ,

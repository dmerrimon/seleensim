1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Title:  The Role of Regional Anesthesia to Reduce Opi[INVESTIGATOR_748165] (FESS)  
Study Des cription : Opi[INVESTIGATOR_748166], 
however there are contraindications and side effects that are common to 
all opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. We hypothesize using local regional anesthetic during  sinus 
surgery will reduce pain , therefore dec reasing the need for post -operative 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536] . The primary objective is to determine if a long -acting 
regional anesthetic applied during a surgery will reduce post -operative 
oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_16444].  
Objectives:  
 Primary Objective:   The primary of objective is to determine if a long -acting 
regional anesthetic applied after a surgery will reduce post -operative oral 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_16444].  
 Secondary Objective:  The secondary objective is to  measure the level of 
each patient’s pain.  
Endpoint s: • Primary Endpoint:  The amount of post -operative pain  after FESS.   
Participants will self -report a pain score on a scale of 0 -10, with 0 
being “no pain” and 10 being “worst pain imaginable” on the 
provided questionnaire (see Appendix 1).    
 • Secondary Endpoint:  Patient’s daily pain medication usage.  
The amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_748167] -procedure will be 
determined by a pi[INVESTIGATOR_748168] -operative clinic visit.  
Study Population:  It is anticipated that 3 0 subjects will be enrolled in this protocol. Potential 
subjects will be male or female adults over  the age of 18 from the United 
States who undergo  functional endoscopic sinus surgery under the 
supervision of one surgeon .

2.2 BACKGROUND   
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_748169]; however, there are 
contraindications, cautions, and side effects that are common with all opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Dependence and 
tolerance are also likely with regular opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], resulting in the current nationwide opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817]. In 
Reducing Opi[INVESTIGATOR_748164] 1.0

P a g e  | [ADDRESS_1023465] prescribing rate in the country, nearly twice 
the national rate, per the NIH/NIDA website ( https://www.dr ugabuse.gov/drugs -abuse/opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]/opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -
summaries -by-state/alabama -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -summary ). In 2015, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released 
prescribing guidelines relating to chronic pain, and in 2018 Alabama’s Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance 
group limited  the supply of opi[INVESTIGATOR_748170] 7 days 
(https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/03/bluecross_blueshield_changing.html ).  
 
There is currently no clinical guideline for prescribing post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_748171] (FESS). A [ADDRESS_1023466] been performed to help decrease the pain 
patient’s feel after sinus surgery.  Haytoglu (2016) revealed that adding non absorbable sinus packs 
loaded with local anesthetics such as bupi[INVESTIGATOR_748172].   
 
Given this current data we believe injecting patients with a long acting analgesic during the procedure 
will help reduce post -operative pain. If we can decrease the amount of pain patients have in the post -
operative period we can theoretically decrease the number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_748173]. We plan to 
also track the number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_748174] -operative period to  obtain a 
somewhat uniform prescribing pattern within surgeons.   
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT

voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their 
frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.  
 
• Risks associated with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40473] (MarcaineTM): The most frequently reported 
adverse reactions are restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision, tremors , nausea, 
vomiting, chills, and constriction of pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324] (central nervous system reactions ) and depression of 
the myocardium, decreased car diac output, heartblock, hypotension, bradycardia, ventricular 
arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest 
(cardiovascular system reactions). Other reported reactions include persistent anesthesia, 
parest hesia, weakness, or paralysis . Allergic reactions are characterized by [CONTACT_748205], pruritus, erythema, angioneurotic edema (including laryngeal edema), tachycardia, 
sneezing, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, syncope, excessive sweating, elevated t emperature, and 
possibly, anaphylactoid -like symptomatology (including severe hypotension) . Reactions to 
MARCAINE are characteristic of those associated with other amide -type local anesthetics. A 
major cause of adverse reactions to this group of drugs is e xcessive plasma levels, which may be 
due to overdosage, unintentional intravascular injection, or slow metabolic degradation. In

 addition to systemic dose -related toxicity, unintentional subarachnoid injection of drug during 
the intended performance of cau dal or lumbar epi[INVESTIGATOR_748175] (especially in the head and neck region) may result in underventilation or apnea (“Total 
or High Spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]”). Also, hypotension due to loss of sympathetic tone and respi[INVESTIGATOR_748176]. This 
may lead to secondary cardiac arrest if untreated. Patients over [ADDRESS_1023468] with difficult resuscitation or death during use for epi[INVESTIGATOR_748177].  
• Risks associated with dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection:  The most frequently reported 
adverse reactions are a naphylaxis, infection, seizures, hypertension, erythema, rash, urticarial, 
nausea, vomiting, edema, petechial, ecchymosis, skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_748178], acne, 
headache, dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, anxiety, and depression.  
• Risks associated with protocol -mandated procedures:  
o Surgical procedures:  All surgical procedures will be performed in the routine manner. 
There will be no additional clinical or surgical risks, other than the normal risks for 
patients undergoin g this type of treatment.  
o Questionnaires: Completion of a questionnaire and the questions might make the 
subject feel uncomfortable or upset. Subjects will have the choice to not answer any 
such questions.

a control group. Our goal is to apply this to sinus surgery in providing analgesia to the sensory nerves of 
the face/sinus.  The immediate potential benefit for the patient is reduced discomfort and pain in the 
post -operative p eriod. Potential long term benefits would include decrease need for post -operative 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_748179].

 Pain is a subjectively 
based outcome that 
can be difficult to 
determine prior to a 
surgery. We believe if 
we are able to reduce 
pain in the majority of 
our patients tested

Opi[INVESTIGATOR_748166] ; however , there are 
contraindications and side effects that are common to all opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. We hypothesize using local regional 
anesthetic after sinus surgery will reduce pain , therefore decreasing the need for post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_17023].  
 
This is a Phase 4, rand omized, single -blinded, single -site, parallel -assignment intervention with a primary 
purpose of supportive care after functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). It is anticipated that 30 
subjects will be enrolled in this protocol. Potential subjects will be male or female adults over the age of 
18 from the [LOCATION_002] who undergo functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) under the 
supervision of one surgeon.

P a g e  | [ADDRESS_1023472] sinus scans will be obtained and/or reviewed.  
 
Participants will be randomized to one of the two following groups:  
• Treatment Group (n = 15): participants will recei ve 20 mL of 1.3% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 2 mg 
dexamethasone injected locally in the location for sensory nerves of the sinus cavities and face 
during the FESS procedure  
• Control Group (n = 15):  participants will not receive regional anesthetic during the FESS 
proc edure  
 
Participants will have their scheduled functional endoscopic sinus surgery procedure. After surgery, 
participants will be given a pain diary to record their pain score on a scale of [ADDRESS_1023473] -operative clinic visit, the diary will be reviewed, and their opi[INVESTIGATOR_748183].  
 
Data points/variables to be collected during the study could include the following, to be ascertained 
from the medical record and/or patient report:  
• Name  
• Medical Record Number

results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse event (of note, the term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event, rather than to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if  it were more severe)  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important me dical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
8.2.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events ( AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to describe severi ty.  
 
• Mild  – Event s require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant ’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a participant ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.   Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily  equate to “serious”.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention  assessed  by [CONTACT_237357]/her clinical judgment. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the 
study product must always be  suspect.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention  caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention  and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention  and the AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibil ity that the administration of the study 
intervention  caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention  
and event onset , or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_748186] ( AE) is expected 
or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is 
not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
8.2.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an  adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant  presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_21218] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition  deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as a n AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity  to be performed. A Es characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The S tudy Coordinator  will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs 
since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
8.2.5  ADVERSE AND SERIOUS EVENT REPORTING

P a g e  | [ADDRESS_1023481] 
include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused 
the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be reported 
in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the 
study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must 
immediately report the event to the sponsor.  
 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_488329]. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested and should be provided as soon as possible.  
 
8.3 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participant s or others to include, in general, any incident, experienc e, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant  population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_547147]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participant s or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
8.3.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTIN G  
The investigator  will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corre ctive actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events ( SAEs) will be reported to the IRB within 24 hours  of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event.

P a g e  | 14 
 • Any other UP will be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of the investigator becoming 
aware of the problem.  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate ins titutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s 
written reporting procedures)  and the Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) within the 
timeline in accordance with the policy  of the IRB’s receipt of the report of th e problem from the

study intervention  and/or have some particular amount of follow -up outcome data)  
• Safety Analysis Dataset: defines the subset of participant s for whom safety analyses will be 
conducted (e.g., participant s who took at least one dose of study intervention ) 
• Per-Protocol Analysis Dataset: defines a subset of the participant s in the full analy sis (ITT) set 
who complied with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that these data would be likely to 
represent  the effects of study intervention  according to the underlying scientific model (e.g., 
participant s who took at least 80% of study intervention  for 80% of the days within the 
maintenance period)

Title of Research: The Role of Regional Anesthesia  to Reduce Opi[INVESTIGATOR_748191] (FESS): A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_748192] #: IRB-300000567
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_748163], M.D.
Sponsor: UAB Department  of Otolaryngology
General Information You are  being asked to take  part  in a research study.  This  research study is 
voluntary, meaning  you do not have to take part  in it.  The procedures, risks, and 
benefits are fully described further in the consent  form.
Purpose The purpose of  the study is  to determine  if receiving extra  pain medication during 
your sinus procedure affects the amount  and kind of pain medication that is taken 
after surgery.
Duration & Visits You will be in this study for  up to 21 days.
Overview of Procedures If you decide to  take  part in this  study, you will assigned by [CONTACT_748213]. This  is called randomization. 
If you are pi[INVESTIGATOR_748193] , you  will receive 10-12 mL of 
0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72160]  1:200,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_13027] 2 mg  dexamethasone  
injected locally in  the location for sensory nerves  of the sinus cavities and 
face intraoperatively, or during the  FESS procedure.
If you are pi[INVESTIGATOR_748194] , you  will not receive any local 
anesthetic during the FESS  procedure.
Both groups will receive the same post-operative prescription pain medication 
(Norco), will complete  a daily pain diary (recording  pain score  and medications  
taken), and will have a  prescription pain medication pi[INVESTIGATOR_748195]-
operative clinic visit.
Risks You will be assigned to a  group by  [CONTACT_3364],  which may  prove to  be less  effective  or 
to have  more side effects than  the other study group or alternatives. 
The most  common side effects of the medications include  nausea/vomiting, 
restlessness, anxiety,  dizziness, rash, and headache.
Benefits You may  not benefit directly  from taking  part  in this study. However, this study  
may help us better  understand how  to treat post-surgical pain  in the future.
Alternatives You do not have to participate in this study  to receive  standard  of care treatment  
for your sinus disorder. Your doctor  will tell you  more  about other treatments that 
may be available to you. You may choose to have no treatment at all.  One 
alternative may be to not to participate in this study.
Purpose of the Research  Study
We are  asking you to take part in a research study because you are  scheduled to have  a functional  endoscopic 
sinus surgery (FESS) procedure  for your sinus issue. You  will be  given a prescription for opi[INVESTIGATOR_748196]

Version Date: 4/11/19as part of your routine care after your surgery. The  purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_748197] a  local anesthetic during FESS is  feasible  and whether it  may affect the amount and kind  of pain 
medication that you will use after surgery.
There will be 30 participants enrolled at  UAB.
Study Participation & Procedures
If you agree to join the  study, your medical record will be reviewed  to obtain  information regarding your 
medical condition and  diagnosis, as well as demographic information, such as your  age and gender. During 
your pre-surgery  clinic visit, you will have a routine  nasal  endoscopy,  and your sinus CT scans  will be obtained 
and/or reviewed. 
You will be randomly pi[INVESTIGATOR_112899] (like the flip of a coin) to either receive the study intervention, or  to receive the 
standard of  care  treatment  during your surgery:
If you are pi[INVESTIGATOR_748193] , you  will receive 10-12 mL of 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 
1:200,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_13027] 2 mg dexamethasone injected locally in the location for sensory nerves of  
the sinus cavities and  face intraoperatively,  during the FESS procedure.
If you are pi[INVESTIGATOR_748194] , you  will not receive any local anesthetic during the FESS 
procedure.
You will then have your  surgery. This  surgery  will be performed in the routine manner  that  was planned for  
you, based on your  condition.   If you are pi[INVESTIGATOR_748198], you will receive the  extra 
medication during  the procedure. If  you are pi[INVESTIGATOR_748199], you will not  receive any extra 
medication during  the procedure.
After your surgery, you will  be prescribed pain medication in  the routine manner. These are the  same 
medications that  you would have whether you were  participating in this study or  not.
For study purposes, you will  be given a study diary  to complete for  the first ten  days  following your surgery. 
This will consist of  a pain  scale, graded on a scale of 1-10, as  well as a  medication diary. You will be  asked to 
record all of the medications you take for the pain you experience  after  your  surgery, both the prescribed  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_748200]-the-counter medications such as  Tylenol  or Advil. 
At your first post-operative clinic visit,  you  will bring in your study  diary and your  medicine bottles so  that we 
can count the number of  pi[INVESTIGATOR_748201].  We will  record these amounts for  our 
research data  only. 
The daily  study diary  will take approximately  [ADDRESS_1023492]  common side effects of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_748202] (MarcaineTM) are:
restlessness

heart block
hypotension (low blood pressure)
bradycardia (slow  pulse)
irregular heart  beat
rapid, life-threatening heart rhythms
The most  common side effects of dexamethasone  are:

edema  (fluid collection under the skin)
bruising
acne
headache
dizziness
insomnia
anxiety
depression  
Save for the above-mentioned  risks  of side  effects, there is no  additional risk to  taking  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_748203].  There aren’t  any known increased risks  for taking these 
medications in combination. They do not have cross reactions with  each other or other known interactions  
that may lead to increased  risks,  other than those  listed above.
No matter what group you are assigned to, you will receive a prescription for hydrocodone-acetaminophen 
(commonly known as Norco) for any  post-operative  surgical pain you may have. There  is a chance that  those  
assigned to Control  Group (who will not receive any  local anesthetic during the  FESS  procedure)  will have an 
increase use of this post-operative pain medication. Risks  associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_748204]:
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]
nausea/vomiting
allergic reaction
constipation
dizziness
headache

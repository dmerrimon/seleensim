Colorectal Cancer, and Other Advanced Solid Tumors IND No.: 127,[ADDRESS_183689] No.:
Not applicable
Study Number: TAK -931-2001 Phase: 2
Study Design: 
Phase 2, multicenter, single agent, uncontrolled, open -label, parallel arm trial in advanced cancer indications. The 
study will also enroll a lead-in safety cohort of Western patients ([LOCATION_002] [US] only) with locally advanced or 
metastatic solid tumo rs to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAK -931 50 mg QD for 
14days in 21 -day cycles in this patient population.
Primary Objectives:
To confirm the safety and tolerability of TAK -931 in a cohort of Western patients with meta static solid tumors. 
To evaluate the anti -tumor activity of TAK -931 in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer 
(CRC), squamous esophageal cancer (sqEC), and squamous non –small - cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC) 
Secondary Objectives:
To characterize the PK of TAK -931 in a cohort of Western patients with metastatic solid tumors. 
To contribute to evaluation of population PK using a limited sampling strategy in tumor -specific cohorts .
To assess additional measures of antitumor activity, including overall response rate (ORR), duration of response 
(DOR), progression -free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). 
To further characterize the safety of TAK -931 as a single agent in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, 
CRC, sqEC, and s qNSCLC.
Patient Population : Patients with one of the following diagnoses:
Pathologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma that has progressed after, at least, a first line of 
standard systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease.
Pathologica lly confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum who have progressed to at least [ADDRESS_183690] systemic chemotherapy for the metastatic disease.
Pathologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic sqEC that has progressed after at l east a first line of 
standard systemic therapy for metastatic disease. First -line patients can be enrolled if a platinum doublet is 
contraindicated or refused by [CONTACT_102].
Pathologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic sqNSCLC that has progress ed after at least [ADDRESS_183691] systemic therapy for metastatic disease .
Number of Patients:
It is expected that up to ~33 response -evaluable patients in the 
metastatic pancreatic cancer cohort and ~35 response -evaluable 
patients in the metastatic CRC cohort will be enrolled in the study in 
3 stages, each with 2 futility evaluations. Additionally, up to 40
response -
evaluable patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
sqEC and up to 40 response - evaluable patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic sqNSCLC may be enrolled in 2 stages, with 
1futility evaluation for each cohort. Number of Sites: 
Approximately 2 -4 sites for the Western safety 
cohort in the US; approximately 18 sites total 
(2-3 sites in Japan and approximately 15 in the 
US).

Metastatic Pancreatic and CRC Cohorts
Two interim futility analyses will be conducted for both cohorts. In the metastatic pancreatic cancer cohort, the first 
interim futility analysis will be carried out after the first 16 response -evaluable patients. If no patients with disease 
control (CR, PR, or SD ≥6 weeks) are observed in the first stage, the study will be stopped for futility; otherwise, the 
study will continue to the second stage. The second interim futility analysis will be carried out after 25 
response -evaluable patients. If ≤[ADDRESS_183702] achieved disease control, the study will be stopped for futility; 
otherwise, the study will continue into the third stage to more fully characterize the DCR in a total of 33 
response -evaluable patients and the null hypothesis will be rejected if there are more than 7 patients with disease 
control. Similarly, the 2 interim futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_158138] ≤1/15 and 
≤4/25 in a total of 35 response -evalua ble patients, and the null hypothesis will be rejected if there are more than 11 of

Squamous Esophageal Cancer and Squamous Non –Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cohorts 
One interim futility analysis will be conducted for both cohorts. The interim futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_158139] 
≤6 patients with disease control in a total of 20 response -evaluable patients, and the null hypothesis will be rejected if 
there are more than 16 of 40 patients with disease control.

4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
TAK -931 i s a highly potent and selective inhibitor of the cell divisio n cycle 7 (CDC7) kinase. 
CDC7 is a serine/threonine kinase that contributes to init iation of DNA replicat ion by 
[CONTACT_158164] e maintenance complex 2 (MCM2) [1,2] . Kinase act ivity of 
CDC7 is controlled by [CONTACT_158165]4 in a cell cycle -dependent m anner [
3]. Recent 
studi es revealed that CDC7 is also invo lved in DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA 
replicat ion, suggest ing that CDC7 plays important roles in both cell pro liferat ion during the S 
phase and geno mic stabilit y in DDR [
4-7]. 
Furtherm ore, el evated CDC7 expressio n has been reported in various cancers and correlates with 
poor prognosis, such as in diffuse large B
-cell lympho ma, oral squamous carcino ma, and breast, 
colon, col orectal , ovari an, and lung tumors [8-11] . However, it is not clear to what extent this 
increased expressio n reflects proliferat ive potential [
12].
In vitro inhibi tion of  the CDC7/DBF4 kinase complex arrests cell pro liferat ion and induces 
apoptosis in cancer cell lines [
13]. The major reason why t he inhibit ion of the CDC7/DBF4 kinase 
complex is highly relevant for cancer is that activation of diverse oncogenes and loss of some 
tumor suppressors evoke replication stress and consequent DNA damage that triggers the 
checkpoint responses of specific sig naling cascades, as demonstrated in cell culture experiments 
and in analyses o f clinical specimens fro m a range of human malignancies [14]. Taken togeth er, 
these data suggest that CDC7 kinase inhibitors present a novel class of mo lecular targets for cancer 
therapy  [
15].
Given that CDC7 is responsible for two key  functions of DNA replicat ion and DDR, CDC7 
appears to be a critical gene for proliferat ion and survival o f cancer cells, and inhibit ion of CDC7 
is expected to be ant iproliferat ive and induce apoptosis in a broad range of cancers. Based on its 
dual mechanism of act ion, CDC7 inhibitors may also produce clinically meaningful efficacy both 
as a single agent and in co mbination wit h other DNA -damaging drugs. 
4.1.1 Nonclinical Experience
[IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical Pharmacology
In vitro and in vivo pharmacology  studi es indicate that TAK -931 is a highly  potent and sel ective 
inhibitor of CDC7 kinase with a concentration producing 50% inhibit ion (IC 50) of l ess than 
0.3nM. Time -dependent inhibit ion assays in the presence of high and low adenosine 
5’
-triphosphate (ATP) concentrations revealed that TAK -931 is an ATP -competitive inhibitor 
with slow-binding kinet ics to CDC7 kinase. The specificit y of TAK -931 was evaluated at 1 M 
against a panel of kinases. Of the 308 kinases tested, TAK-931 at 1M inhibited 10 kinases by 
80% or more. The IC 50values for these kinases —DAPK3, DAPK1, CDK9/Cyclin T1, DMPK, 
CDK8/Cyclin C, MAPK12, STK17A, CLK4, DYRK1A, and [COMPANY_004]3B—ranged from  36.9 to 
338nM. TAK -931 exhibited >[ADDRESS_183708] ivity for CDC7 kinase i nhibit ion compared wit h the 
other kinases in this panel.

TAK -931 causes DNA replication stress by [CONTACT_158166]2 at serine -40 
(pMCM2). In the colorectal adenocarcino ma cell lines COLO205, SW48, HCT116, and RKO, 
TAK -931 suppressed MC M2 phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner with IC 50values 
ranging from 18 to 170 nM. 
The in vivo ant itumor activit y of TAK -931 administered orally as either a single agent or in 
combinat ion (wi th irradiat ion, irinotecan, or topotecan) was evaluated in female BALB/c nude 
mice bearing COLO205 human co lorectal  adenocarcino ma o r OC -11-JCK human primary ovaria n 
adenocarcino ma xenografts. Single treatments with TAK -[ADDRESS_183709] 
COLO205. In COLO205, TAK
-931 combined wit h irradiat ion or irinotecan also exhibited 
additive antitumor activit y compared with eit her single treatment alone. In the OC -11-JCK 
xenograft, the combinat ion of TAK -931 and topo tecan produced synergy  com pared wi th either 
treatm ent al one.
The in vivo ant itumor activit y of TAK -931 was further characterized using 94 primary  human 
xenograft tumors. In this nonclinical phase 2 like study , mice were treated with TAK -
931 
60mg/kg orally (PO) wi th a 3 days on and 4 days off weekly schedule for 21 day s. In thi s study , 
TAK -931 was m ore acti ve in pancreat ic and colorectal tumors ( Figure 4.aand  Figure 4.b). 
In addit ion, microsatellite -instable (MSI) ty pe of  colorectal  tumors appeared to show worse 
response to TAK -931 compared with microsatellit e stabl e (MSS) type of CRC ( Figure 4.b). These 
in vivo data were consistent with the in vitro cancer cell line screen results where the data 
suggested that the MSS group was more sensit ive to TAK -931 than the MSI group in CRC cell 
lines.

[IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
The pharmacokinet ic (PK) and pharmacodynamic response of TAK -931 was evaluated after a 
single oral  administrati on of  10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg/kg to female BALB/c nude mice bearing 
COLO205 human colorectal adenocarcino ma xenografts. Plasma and tumor samples were 
obtained and analyzed for TAK- 931 concentrations and derived PK parameters. pMCM2, which 
CDC7 kinase phosphorylates directly, was used as a target -engagement pharmacodynamic 
marker. Pharmacodynamic analysis was performed using Western blot and immunohistochemistr y 
(IHC). The plasma and tumor exposures of TAK -931 are increased in an approximately 
dose-proporti onal manner in female BALB/c nude mice bearing COLO205 xenografts. Both 
Western blot and IHC analysis dete cted modulat ions of the pharmacodynamic bio marker pMCM2 
in xenograft tumors and mouse skin in a dose -and time -dependent manner. Furthermore, 
antitumor activit y and durat ion of saturated pMCM2 suppressio n in tum or was well correlated in 
nude mice bearing C OLO205 xenografts. These results indicate the potential utilit y of pMCM2 as 
clinical pharmacodynamic bio markers to evaluate the pharmacodynamic response of TAK -931.
TAK -931 exposure after a single oral administration demonstrated that the compound is rapid ly 
absorbed in vivo, with 35.1% and 21.6% oral bioavailabilit y in Sprague -Dawley  rats and beagle 
dogs, respectively. After a single intravenous dose, TAK -931 demonstrated high plasma clearance 
in rats (3260 mL/hr/kg) and dogs (2630 mL/hr/kg), and high vo lume of distribut ion at steady state 
in both species (rats: 2460 mL/kg; dogs: 3060 mL/kg). Both rats and dogs exhibited nonlinear oral 
PK.

concentration -time curve (AUC) from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC 24) increasing in a greater than 
dose-proporti onal manner at hi gher doses. No accumulat ion of TAK -[ADDRESS_183710] cancer resistance protein, but is not 
likely  a substrate for P -glycoprotein (P -gp) on the basis of transcellular transport invest igations 
across Caco -[ADDRESS_183711] on 
P-gp–mediated efflux activit y (IC 50>100 M). The drug -drug interaction (DDI) potential o f 
TAK -931 wi th P-gp substrates and inhibitors is low.
In an in vitro study , plasma protein binding was 59% to 62% in mice, 73% to 74% in rats, 57% to 
58% in dogs, and 73% to 74% in humans, with no concentration dependency observed fro m 0.01 
to 1 g/mL.
The in vitro oxidative metabo
lism of TAK -931 was evaluate d using liver microsomes from CD -1 
mice, Sprague -Dawl ey rats, beagl e dogs, cyno molgus monkeys, and humans. TAK -931 was 
metabo lized primarily to the unident ified metabo lite [LOCATION_006] -1 and, to a lesser extent, [LOCATION_006] -2. There 
was no m etabo lite unique to human liver mi crosomes through oxidat ive metabo lism.
Evaluat ion of the in vitro metabo lism of TAK -931 in the presence of uridine -5'-
diphosphategl ucuroni c acid showed that the compound is metabo lized through glucuronidation by 
[CONTACT_158167] (mice, rats, monkeys, and humans).
Invest igations into cytochrom e P450 (CYP) enzyme -mediated metabo lism showed that CYP2D6 
and CYP3A are the main CYPs invo lved in the metabolism o f TAK -931. There is a DDI potential 
with UDP -glucuronosyltransferase induc ers; however, the DDI potential wit h CYP inhibitors, 
though they  are involved in metabolism, is unlikely . TAK -931 is unlikely to cause DDIs with 
concomitant medicat ions metabo lized via CYP isozymes at C maxvalues <800 ng/mL . 
Details on these studies are provi ded in the current TAK -931 Investi gator’s Brochure (IB).
[IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical Toxicology
The toxi cologic profile and systemic toxic potential o f TAK -931 has been well defined in 
Sprague -Dawl ey rats and beagle dogs.
The primary  dose -limit ing toxicit ies (DLTs), particularly in the dog, appear to be associated with 
Cmaxand are closely associated with the observed cardiovascular (CV) changes. These CV effects 
were dose dependent and plasma co mpound concentration dependent, occurring in rats and dogs 
when TAK -931 pl asma concentrations exceeded approximately  1000 ng/mL. It has been 
confirmed that the effects of TAK -931 on HR and BP are monitorable and reversible upon 
clearance of TAK -931.The CV effects may be related to TAK -931 inhibitory  activit y at off -target 
kinase s. In addi tion, renal injury  (obstructive nephropathy ) was confirmed to be a DLT in rats, 
although similar changes were not observed in dogs. Renal effects of TAK -[ADDRESS_183712] arti cle-related findings 
Property of [COMPANY_005]: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use
TAK -[ADDRESS_183713] ems, gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, and reproductive 
organs. Decreased white blood cell (WBC) count or single cell necrosis in the GImucosa appeared 
with minimal degree atlower dose s and severit y increased with dose level. All target organ 
toxicities obse rved in the repeated- dose studies were generally mo nitorable and reversible, except 
for the effect on germ cells.
Based on these results, the toxico logy studi es conducted wi th TAK -931 support the proposed 
clinical program in adult patients with advanced ma lignancies. The nonclinical toxico logy profile 
demonstrated target organ toxicit y that was generally considered to be monitorable and reversible. 
The primary C max-related toxi city was CV effects (decreased BP with reflect ing tachycardia). The 
DLTs rel ated to total exposure were effects on the GI mucosa and lympho id systems consistent 
with pharm acology-mediated CDC7 inhibit ion. 
Details on these studies are provided in the current TAK -[ADDRESS_183714]-in-human (FIH) phase 1 study  (TAK -931-1002) in 
Japanese patients with advanced so lid malignancies . The data cut -off used for the safet y analysis 
and PK analysis was [ADDRESS_183715] 1 dose of 
TAK -931 as a single agent. This trial in pat ients wit h advanced nonhematologic cancer has 
enrolled 16 patients in Schedule A (14 days on/7 days off in 21 -day) in 4 dose levels (14 patients 
DLT -evaluable). The MTD was defined at 50 mg QD with this schedule. Twelve pat ients were 
enrolled into Schedule B (7 days on/7 days o ff twice in 28 -day cycles), [ADDRESS_183716] been enro lled into Schedule D (c ontinuous QD administration), 6 patients at 
20 m g and 6 pati ents at 30 m g. Current ly pat ients are being enro lled in this schedule at 40 mg.
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety
The MTD has been defined per the protocol at 50 mg QD for Schedule A because there were no 
DLTs in the 14 DLT -evaluable patients receiving this dose in the escalat ion plus the expansi on 
phases. Neutropenia has been the only reported DLT. Neutropenia was dose -dependent, 
noncumulat ive, and reversible, with the nadir usually occurring at the end of the dosing period . 
Neutropenia has not been accompanied by [CONTACT_158168], mucosit is, or 
diarrhea. 
Two of 3 patients receiving 60 mg QD in Schedule A had DLTs (Grade 4 neutropenia lasting 
longer than 3 days that, per the protocol, was considered a DLT). The first patient presented with 
an abso lute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir o f 190/mm3and l ow-grade fever that prompted the 
investigator to use prophylact ic antibiot ics and granulocy te-colony stimulating factor (G -CSF). 
The second pat ient’s ANC nad ir was 30/mm3, and prophylact ic antibiot ics and G- CSF were al so 
used. No Grade 4 neutropenia was observed at 50 mg. In Schedule B, 2 out of 9 patients in the 
80-mg cohort had DLTs of Grade 3 febrile neutropenia; 1 of these 2 patients presented with 
concomi tant ileus and the other wi th a peri toneal abscess. Both pati ents were di scontinued as a 
consequence o f the events. Escalat ion in this cohort is ongoing.

In the 49 patients treated with TAK -931 in the FIH study , nausea was reported in 24 (49%) 
patients. Ot her GI AEs included vo miting (n = 10 [20%]), diarrhea (n = 9 [18%]), constipation (n = 
5 [10%]), abdominal pain (n = 4 [8%]), ileus (n = 2 [4%]), dysgeusia (n = 1 [2%]), and pancreat itis 
(n = 1 [2%]). In addit ion, 13 (27%) patients reported AEs of decrease d appet ite. Seri ous GI AEs 
included ileus (2 [4%]) and nausea (1 [2%]). Grade ≥3 GI AEs included decreased appet ite (2 
[4%]), abdominal abscess (1 [2%]), and ileus (1 [2%]). In general, GI tolerabilit y was good with a 
low frequency of severe nausea, vomit ing, and di arrhea, and there was no significant impact on 
treatm ent com pliance. Nausea and vomit ing were successfully managed with standard 
antiemetics.
Hypotensi on is considered a key  nonclinical risk (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). In the FIH trial, 2 patients 
presented with an AE of drug -related Grade 1 (asymptomat ic, intervention not indicated) 
hypotension. One patient dosed with 40 mg in Schedule A presented with Grade 1 hyp otensi on in 
Cycle 1 that started on Day  2 and l asted until the end of the dosing period in Cycle 1. No action 
was taken with study  drug. Another patient treated at 50 mg QD presented with Grade 1 
hypotension for 2 consecut ive days (Cycle 1 Day 12 predose a nd Cycle 1 Day  13 predose); thus, 
TAK -931 doses were held for these 2 days. The low BP recovered without intervent ion. Both

concentration of 214 ng/mL wit h an interpatient CV of 39.6%. Hy potensi on in animals was 
observed wit h C maxabove 1000 ng/mL. Based on clinical safet y and PK, the risk o f clinically 
relevant hy potensi on at a 50 m g dose i s considered to be very  low.
Alopecia has been reported in the study  TAK -
931-1002. As of 04 January 2017, 4 of the 12 
patients who received treatment with TAK -
931 reported Grade 1 or 2 alopecia. None of the 
reported TEAEs for alopeci a were designated as serious.
The current study  (TAK -931- 2001) i s the second trial with TAK -931. The enrollment of the 
Western cohort safet y (n = 12) has been completed. One patient presented with Grade 3 
neutropeni a as a DLT. The PK profile on Days 1 a nd 8 is comparable to that obtained for the same 
dose in the previous FIH study  in Japanese patients with so lid tumors.

and coefficient of variat ion [%CV] ≤30% for AUC). TAK -931 showed minimal accumulat ion 
following once -daily dosing wi th a mean terminal  disposi tion phase half -life ( t1/2z)of 4.3to

TAK -[ADDRESS_183718] atic cancer (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). The main clinical toxicit y is neutropenia that is monitored 
routi nely in this trial. The overall tolerabilit y and safet y of TAK-[ADDRESS_183719] ivity include PRs in duodenal cancer at 30 mg, squamous esophageal 
cancer at 50 mg, and squamous cervical cancer at 60 mg, prolonged SD (9 months) in 1 patient 
with pancreat ic cancer at 30 mg, and bio marker response (CA125) in [ADDRESS_183720] asma concentrations 
of TAK -931 observed in the nonclinical xenograft models. In the FIH study , strong pMCM2 
inhibit ion in skin was observed in pat ients treated with TAK -931 (all dose levels) which correlated 
well with the drug exposures in these pat ients. Thus, pMCM2 appears to be a viable 
pharmacodynamic marker to monitor target engagement of TAK -[ADDRESS_183721] chemotherapy . Enrollments in the CRC and pancreat ic 
cohorts will fo llow a 3 -stage desi gn wi th 2interim analyses for fut ility using di sease control  rate 
(DCR). Enrollments in sqNSCLC and sqEC will follow a 2- stage design wit h 1 interim fut ility 
analysis using DCR (see Sect ions 4.2and 13.2 for details). 
Trial parti cipants are requi red to provi de bi opsies for predi ctive biomarker assessment. This 
activit y is crucial for a successful pat ient selection in future tri als. 
Patients in the Western safet y cohort are requested to provide low -risk pretreatment and 
posttreatment skin tissue biopsies to demonstrate target engagement and to establish 
PK-pharm acodynamic rel ationships to further confirm the data obtained in the Japan ese 
patient popul ation from the FIH tri al (TAK -
931-1002). Skin t issue biopsies are optional for 
patients undergoing or scheduled to have pre and on -treatment tum or biopsies to establish a 
correl ation between target engagement in skin and tumor. 
All pat ients in the disease
-specific cohorts are required to provide a pretreatment tumor biopsy 
for predi ctive bio marker evaluation. It can be eit her a fresh tumor biopsy  obtained during the 
screening period or an archival one. Because biopsy procedures have risks, the biopsy  
sampling plan and rationale are outlined in Sect ion [IP_ADDRESS] . If a fresh biopsy is required and 
the pati ent gives consent, the lesio n should be accessible in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the invest igator.

These tumor biopsies will be used to evaluate mo lecular biomarkers and their relationship with

[CONTACT_158169]. For these patients, a skin tissue biopsy may also be collected (optional).
4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study
This trial has 2 principal objectives:
!To confirm the dose and schedule of 50 mg QD for 14 days in 21-day cycles in Western 
patients of non-Japanese ethnicity. This objective has been achieved.
!To evaluate the antitumor activity of TAK-931 in patients with metastatic pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma, patients with metastatic CRC, patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous esophageal cancer, and patients with locally advanced or metastatic sqNSCLC. The 
selection of the 2 additional indications is based in the identification of an enrichment 
signature [CONTACT_158204]  4.2.1.
The trial will enroll patients at sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and in Japan. To achieve the 
objectives, the study is divided into [ADDRESS_183723] part, a limited safety cohort of ~12 patients 
with metastatic solid tumors that progressed after appropriate prior therapy were enrolled only in 
the US. Safety, PK, and skin pharmacodynamic information was used to confirm the 50 mg QD 
dose in Western patients. To achieve this, a descriptive comparison with a similar population with 
a Japanese ethnicity treated in the FIH study (TAK-931-1002, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was performed. In 
this cohort of [ADDRESS_183724] been amended to evaluate othe r dosing alternatives. This objective has been 
already achieved and 50 mg QD is considered comparable between Japanese and Western cancer 
patients.

TAK-[ADDRESS_183725] chemotherapy. Based on nonclinical research, TAK-931 is expected to be more active in 
MSS colorectal tumors. For this reason, the trial excludes patients with known MSI-H genotype. 
The selection of these indications is based on nonclinical efficacy models as described in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS].  
The FIH study TAK-931-1002 has confirmed 50 mg QD as the MTD for 21-day cycle dosing ([ADDRESS_183726]). For this reason, Japanese sites will enroll patients directly in 
the tumor-specific cohorts. If the same dose is confirmed in the US, US sites will begin to enroll 
patients with pancreatic cancer and CRC with the char acteristics specified in the inclusion criteria 
(Section 7.1). 
The selection of DCR as the primary endpoint for activity is based on the recent phase 3 
registration trial in CRC and pancreatic cancer. In these trials, ORR (CR+PR) per RECIST was 
minimal in a similar pretreated patient population; however, there were differences in DCR 
(defined as the sum of CR+PR+SD ≥6 weeks) (see Sections  13.2 and 13.3) . 
Regorafenib (STIVARGA) single agent was approved by [CONTACT_3133] 
(FDA) in patients with metastatic CRC previously treated with 2 lines of chemotherapy. The phase 
3 placebo-controlled trial enrolled 760 patients with a 2:1 randomization scheme. The trial 
demonstrated benefits in OS and PFS (hazard ratios of 0.77 and 0.49, respectively). Only 1% of 
patients achieved a PR status per RECIST; however, DCR (defined as PR+SD assessed at least 6 CCI

38(15%) patients assigned to plac ebo (p<0.0001) [16]. Similarly, TAS -102 (LONSURF) was 
approved in Japan and the European Union (EU) in a similar pa tient popul ation with a 
placebo -controlled phase 3 trial (N = 800, 2:1 randomizat ion). The trial demo nstrated a significant 
OS and PFS advantage (hazard ratios of 0.69 and 0.48, respectively). PR was achieved in only 
1.6% of patients with TAS -102; however, DCR was reached in 221 pat ients (44%) in the TAS -
102 
group and in 42 patients (16%) in the placebo group (p<0.0001) [17].
4.2.3 Pancreatic Cancer
Liposom al irinotecan (Onivyde) single agen t was init ially com pared wi th 5-fluorouracil/fo linic 
acid (5-FU/FOL) for treatment of pat ients with metastatic pancreat ic cancer that had progressed 
after gemcitabine (liposomal irinotecan n = 151; 5 -FU/FOL n = 149). The trial was amended once 
started to i nclude an arm using triplet liposomal irinotecan/5 -FU/FOL, which was approved in the

monotherapy  achieved an object ive response compared with one patient (1%) assigned t o 
5-FU/FOL (difference of 5.3%, 95% CI 1.3 to 9.3; p = 0.02). Forty - one percent of patients in the 
irinotecan arm achieved a PR or SD versus 24.2% treated with 5 -FU/FOL. Twenty -nine of 123 
patients (24%) allo cated to liposo mal irinotecan monotherapy  had a carbohydrate antigen 19 -9 
(CA19 -9) response versus 12 of 105 patients (11%) assigned to 5- FU/FOL (p = 0.024) [18,19 ]. 
The DCR endpo int was selected over PFS or OS because it can be used as an early indicator of 
futilit y in a mult istage design; however , for future studi es other time -to-event indicators will be 
considered.

incidence in Japan. There are no sy stemic treatm ents approved specifically for the metastatic 
squamous indication. With few except ions (HER2 -positive adenocarcino mas), the same 
treatm ents are recommended for esophageal adenocarcino ma, sqEC, gastroesophageal junct ion 
carcino ma (GEJC), and gastric cancer. The standard first-line therapy is a doublet containing a 
platinum plus a fluoropyrimidine. After recurrence, single -agent chemotherapy  with a taxane or 
irinotecan is indicated in patients with a good performance status [18] [20] .
Seven pat ients with esophageal cancer have been dosed in the FIH trial TAK -
931-1002, 1 at 
20mg, 4 at 30 mg, 1 at 40 mg using a continuous QD administrati on schedule, and 1 patient at 50 
mg QD with a 2 weeks on/[ADDRESS_183728] 1.1 PR until

Cycle 6 ([ADDRESS_183729] ion of -
20%), and 1 is ongoing in Cycle 10+. 
There are no published clinical trials evaluat ing the effect of any single -agent chemotherapy  as 
second -line treatment in sqEC. As a reference, we used the control arm in the RAINBOW trial: 
paclitaxel plus ramu cirumab versus paclitaxel plus placebo in patients with gastric cancer or GEJC 
in second line (n = 665). In this trial, computed tom ography (CT) scans were done every  6 weeks

therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014]. Approximately 30% of NSCLC patients are fit enough to receive further treatment, 
which is ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_897] m onotherapy  with either chemotherapy or a targeted agent [
21]. Although 
targeted agents are a valid option for some patients whose tumors express anaplast ic lympho ma 
kinase (ALK), epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] ( EGFR ), B Raf -proto -oncogene, serine/threonine 
kinase (BRAF ), 
c-ros oncogene 1 or programmed death -ligand 1 (PD-L1), many of these patients 
fail to respond to targeted agents. In this context, a clinical trial wit h an oral single -agent drug is a 
reasonable option for sqNSCLC in third -line treatment and beyo nd. 
There are no specific published references of clinical trials in the sqNSCLC third -line setting and 
beyond. Establishing an acceptable comparator to retrospectively evaluate activit y is even m ore 
complicated because of the recent introduction of several checkpo int inhibitors in first -and 
second -line treatment. 
In a single -arm phase [ADDRESS_183731] as a reference for this trial were enro lled in cohort 2: tumors EGFR −/ALK −with <25%

6.0 STUDY DESIGN
6.1 Overview of Study Design
This is a phase 2, mult icenter, single -agent, uncontrolled, open -label, parallel -arm trial in patients 
with metastati c cancer (CRC, pancreas cancer, sqNSCLC and sqEC). The study  will also enroll a 
safet y cohort of ~[ADDRESS_183733] peri od in 21- day cycles. In 
this cohort, init ially 6 pati ents will  be enrolled for safet y and PK evaluat ion. These 6 patients can 
be enrolled concurrent ly. If no more than 2 patients present with a DLT (Section 8.2), the 
remaining 6 pati ents will be enrolled. If the final number of patients wi th a DLT i s 4 or m ore, the 
50mg QD dose will be considered unsafe for Western patients and enro llment of the 
disease -specific cohorts will not start in the US until the protocol is amended and a safe path to 
evaluate the dose and schedule is ident ified. Bef ore deciding that the 50 mg QD dose is adequate to 
proceed into the disease -specific cohorts in Western patients, a complete review o f available 
safet y, PK, and ant itumor activit y will be perform ed. These resul ts will  be com pared wi th those 
from Japanese patients who were treated in the FIH study  TAK -931- 1002 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Dose 
comparabili ty will not be established using formal statist ical methods. If TAK -931 exposures at 50 
mg QD in Japanese and Western populat ions are considered comparable, the trial w ill start 
enrolling pat ients with metastati c pancreat ic adenocarcino ma and CRC in the US. In Japan, the 
proposed dose has been considered the MTD of 50 mg QD for the 14 days on/7 days off schedule; 
therefore, Japanese sites will enro ll disease -specific coh orts fro m the beginning. The 
comparabili ty of dose and schedule between Japanese and Western patients wasachieved at the 
time of Protocol Amendment 03.
AEs will be assessed according to CTCAE, version 4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010 [
20], and 
laboratory  values, vi tal signs, and ECGs will be obtained to evaluate the safet y and tol erabili ty of 
TAK -931.
HRQOL will be evaluated using the patient -reported outcome (PRO) measure, the EORTC 
QLQ -C30.
Serial blood sam ples f or determination o f the plasma concentration of TAK -931 will be obt ained 
at prespecified time points as described in the Pharmacokinet ic Sampling Schedule ( Appendix A). 
An intensive PK co llection with time-matched triplicate ECGs will be perform ed in the Western 
safet y cohort and first 10 patients in the pancreatic cancer and CRC cohorts in the US to allow 
comparison wi th a similar Japanese populat ion. All other patients, including all pat ients in the 
sqEC and sqNSCLC cohorts, will undergo sparse PK sampling. 
Serial blood sam ples will  be collected in the Western safet y cohort for tumor -specific markers 
(CEA in the CRC cohort and CA19 -9 in the pancreatic cancer cohort).
An evaluat ion of disease response using the modified RECIST version 1.1 [22] will be performed 
at Baseline and every other cy cle o f treatm ent.

In the Western safety cohort only, predose and postdose skin biopsies will be collected in Cycle 1 
for pharmacodynamic bio marker (pMCM2) assessment and PK -pharmacodynamic relat ionships 
for target engagement evaluation and co mpar ison with simil ar data obtained in the FIH trial. 
Relationships between plasma exposures o f TAK -931 and pMCM2 (Ser40) levels in pretreatment 
and posttreatment tumor biopsies will be explored to evaluate PK/pharmacodynamic -efficacy 
relationships. Paired baseline predose and postdose tumor biopsies in Cycle 1 after exposure to 
TAK -931 are optional for patients in the disease -specific cohorts to evaluate target engagement in 
the tumor tissues by [CONTACT_158170]2 levels. Other potential bio markers (to be determined) will 
be assessed in the same way.
Serial plasma sam ples will  be collected for NGS characterizat ion of ctDNA in patients to ident ify 
molecular determinants of TAK-[ADDRESS_183734] ive biomarkers, the trial requires all pat ients in the 
disease -specific cohorts to provide a pretreatment tumor biopsy, eit her fresh (during the screening 
period) or archival (obtained at any  time since the init ial diagnosis). A fresh biopsy or an archival 
one obtained after last tumor progression i s preferred. 
6.2 Number of Patients
Initially, ~12 Western patients with metastatic solid tumors are expected to be enrolled in the US to 
confirm the dose of 50 mg QD for 14 day s in 21 -day cycles based on the safet y, tolerabilit y, and 
PK of TAK -931 in Western patients of non -Japanese ethnicit y. 
It is expected that up to ~33 response -evaluable patients in the metastatic pancreat ic cancer cohort 
and ~35 response -evaluable patients in the metastatic CRC cohort will be enro lled in the study in 3 
stages, each with 2 futility evaluat ions. Addit ionally , up to 40 response -evaluable pat ients with 
locally advanced or metastatic sqEC and up to 40 response- evaluable pat ients with locally 
advanced or metastatic sqNSCLC may  be enrolled in 2 stages, with 1 futilit y evaluat ion for each 
cohort (see Sections 13.2 and 13.3). 
6.3 Duration of Study
6.3.1 Duration of an Individual Patient’s Study Participation
Patients may receive TAK -931 unt il they experience PD or unacceptable toxicit y or until any other 
discontinuat ion criterion is m et (Secti on 8.3.3 ). The maximum scheduled duration of treatment 
will be 1 year; however, patients with clinical benefit (per invest igator and as agreed by [CONTACT_103]’s medical monitor) can continue treatmen t beyo nd 1 year with the explicit approval of the 
sponsor’s medical mo nitor. 
All patients will attend an End -of-Treatm ent (EOT) vi sit 30 days (+10 day s) after receiving their 
last dose of study  drug or before the start of subsequent sy stemic ant icancer th erapy , whichever 
occurs first, to permit detection of any delayed TEAEs and resolut ion of ongo ing events. Patients 
with unresolved TEAEs will cont inue the periodic safet y follow-up until com plete resol ution or 
stabilization (established as sequelae) occurs .

follow-up, consent withdrawal, study  terminat ion, or any  of the ci rcumstances described in 
Secti on 9.7. 
6.3.2 End of Study/Study Completion Definition and Planned Reporting
The final data cutoff for the CSR will be conducted after all pat ients have been discont inued fro m 
treatm ent or transferred to a long -term safety  study, a single -patient invest igational new drug 
applicat ion, or a similar program. 
The estimated time frame for study complet ion is 18 to 24 months. Alternat ively, if fut ility criteria 
are met for any  disease -specific cohort(s), the study  will be considered co mplete (see

Grade 1 AEs No dose reductions or interruptions 
Grade 2 AEs Treat according to local practice. Whether to hold treatment or continue it at the 
same or at a reduced dose is at the discretion of the investigator.
Patients experiencing Grade 2 AEs considered related to study treatment that are not 
easily  managed or corrected and are not tolerable to the patient, or AEs that are not 
accepta ble in the investigator’s judgment, should have study treatment interrupted 
until the AE resolves to Grade ≤1 or Baseline and then restarted at the same dose or, 
depending on the toxicity, at a reduced dose level. 
Grade 3 AEs Hold TAK -931 until resolution to Grade ≤1 or Baseline, then resume treatment at 
either the same dose or a reduced dose level at the discretion of the investigator.
Grade 4 (life -threatening) AEs Consider permanently withdrawing the patient from the study, except when the 
investigator determines that the patient is receiving clinical benefit and has 
discussed this with the sponsor, then treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose 
level or below when toxicity recovers to Grade ≤1 or Baseline.
AEs of all grades If treatment h as been held for >14 consecutive days without resolution of the 
toxicity (to Baseline or Grade ≤1), consider permanently discontinuing study 
treatment unless there is clinical benefit for the patient as assessed by [CONTACT_158176]'s appro val. Treatment can be resumed at a reduced

9.3.11 Electrocardiogram
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety ECGs
Standa rd 12 -lead ECGs will be administered at the time points specified in the Schedule of Events 
(Appendix A,
 Tables A and B). All machine -generated tracings should be acqu ired in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_158146] 5 minutes. Additional ECGs may  be obtained as 
clinically indicated (see Section 8.4.5 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Triplicate ECGs
Patients in the Western safet y cohort and the first 10 US patients in the CRC and pancreat ic cancer 
cohorts will undergo triplicate ECGs matching PK sampling for QTc assessment during Cycle 1 
on Day s 1 and 8 
(Appendix A, Table C). Triplicate ECGs are not required for all other 
patients, including all patients in the sqEC and sqNSCLC cohorts. 
Before each no minal triplicate ECG sampling time point, patients must ma intain a supi[INVESTIGATOR_158147] 15 minutes. A Holter monitoring device will be used for triplicate ECG assessment. Three 
ECGs (approximately 1 minute apart) will be extracted at prespecified time points at times that 
match the times of Day  1 and Day  8 postdos e PK/ECG sampling. For these matched PK/ECG 
collect ions, the PK blood sample should be co llected only after complet ion of the triplicate ECG 
collect ion as described below. It is reco mmended that patients refrain from eat ing or limit 
themselves to bl and foo d for [ADDRESS_183804] period (the ECG extraction 10 -minute window).

to collect a skin tissue biopsy simultaneously  with the tum or biopsy . 
For sample retent ion, refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
[IP_ADDRESS] Archival (Banked) Tumor Tissue Sample
All patients enrolled in the disease -specific cohorts must have an FFPE pretreatment tumor tissue 
biopsy to assess TAK -[ADDRESS_183807] progression, if available, is preferred; however, an archival FFPE sample obtained at the 
time of the init ial diagnosis (eg, surgical specimen) is acceptable. An FFPE block or a minimum o f

For sample retent ion, refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
[IP_ADDRESS] Fresh Tumor Tissue Biopsy Sample
If FFPE tumor tissue is not available, a fresh biopsy must be obtained. If a new biopsy is 
perform ed, it shoul d be obtained during the screening period with a nonsignificant risk procedure 
per the treating physician as described in Sect ion9.3.16.4 .
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Paired Fresh Tumor Tissue Biopsy Sample for Pharmacodynamics
Paired tum or biopsies are opti onal from patients in each disease -speci fic cohort to demonstrate

biopsy be taken from the same lesio n or, at l east, from  the same organ as at Baseline. 
The invest igator should preselect patients for this procedure and the patient must consent 
specifically to undergoing paired biopsies. Biopsies should meet the characterist ics of 
nonsignificant risk as assessed by [CONTACT_093]. Failure to obtain a fo llow-up bi opsy  (eg, if the 
patient declines to undergo the second procedure) will not be considered a reason to discont inue a 
patient from the tri al.

HRQOL assessment using the EORTC QLQ- C30 will be co llected from pat ients in the 
disease -specific cohorts at the time points specified in the Schedule of Events 
(Appendix A, Table 
C). The patient should be given the paper versio n of the quest ionnaire to complete at the scheduled 
visit before other clinical assessments are conducte d. The questionnaire should be co mpleted in 
the language most familiar to the patient, at the scheduled visit, before the patient sees the 
investigator for clinical assessments. The patient should be given sufficient space and time to 
complete the questi onnaire. The patient should complete the quest ionnaires on their own without 
any assistance from site staff or a caregiver. The questionnaire is intended to be self -reported and 
shoul d not be interviewer -administered.
The quest ionnaire should be checked for completeness and the patient is encouraged to complete 
any missing response. Detailed instructions relat ing to the administrative procedures of the 
questionnaire will be provided to the sites. Patient’s refusal to complete all or any part of a 
questionnair e shoul d be documented in the eCRF.
The EORTC QLQ C30 was designated to assess HRQOL in a wide range of cancer patient 
popul ations and contains [ADDRESS_183811] ional scales (physical, role, 
cogni tive, em otional, and soci al), 9 symptom  scales (fat igue, nausea and vo miting, pain, dyspnea, 
sleep disturbance, appetite loss, const ipation, diarrhea, and financial difficult ies), and a global 
qualit y of life/healt h status scale. Most of the [ADDRESS_183812] 4 response levels (not at all, a litt le, 
quite a bit, and very much), with [ADDRESS_183813] ional scales and the global 
healt h status scale, higher scores represent better HRQOL; wh ereas for the symptom scales lower 
scores represent better HRQOL. All items in this questionnaire relate to a recall period of 1 week.

9.9 Posttreatment Follow -up Assessments (Progression -Free Survival and Overall 
Survival) 
Patients in the di sease -specific cohorts who stop treatment for any  reason other than PD will 
continue to have PFS and OS follow -up visi ts. Patients in the Western safety  cohort will  be 
followed only  for PFS. The PFS follow -up visi t shoul d be conducted at the site every 12±[ADDRESS_183816] ic therapy, study  terminat ion (Section 9.4), or until 
6months after the patient discont inues treatment, whichever occurs first. 
After the occurrence of PD or the start of subsequent anticancer therapy , all pat ients in the 
disease -specific cohorts will cont inue to have OS follow -up visit s. The OS visits should be 
conducted every 12±[ADDRESS_183817] patient disco ntinues treatment, or until 50% of patients have died, whichever 
occurs first.
Survivor informat ion and death details may be co llected by  [CONTACT_158182], but are not 
limited to, telephone, e -mail, mail, or retri eved f rom online or other databases (eg , soci al securi ty

the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with this 
treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnorm al 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal 
(invest igational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any 
newly occurring event, or a previous condit ion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the 
administration of study  drug.
An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuat ion or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervent ion, or is considered 
by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change fro m Baseline.
10.1.[ADDRESS_183819] medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the pat ient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe).
Requi res inpat ienthospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] (see

between an SAE and an AE that is considered severe in intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms 
serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term severe is often used to describe the 
intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT the same as serious , which is 
based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described above, and is usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or ability to function. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does 
not necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, a WBC count of 1000/mm3to less than 
2000/mm3is considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not 
intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.
10.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_102] a nd/or in response to an open question from study 
personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures will be 
recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section 10.3 for the period of observation). Any 
clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an 
AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be 
noted as 1 comprehensive event.
Regardless of causality, SAEs (as defined in Section 10.1.2)  must be reported (see Section 10.3 for 
the period of observation) by [CONTACT_158183] (contact [CONTACT_51259]). Th is should be done by [CONTACT_158184] [ADDRESS_183821] Information

For both serious and nonserious AEs, the invest igator mu st determine both the severit y (toxi city 
grade) of the event and the relat ionship of the event to study drug administration. 
Severit y (toxi city grade) for e ach AE, including any lab oratory abnorm ality, will be determined 
using the NCI CTCAE, v.4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010 [25].The criteria are provided in the 
Study  Manual.
Relationship of the event to study  drug administrati on(its causalit y) will be determined by  [CONTACT_158185] (rel ated) or no (unrelated) to this quest ion: “Is there a reasonable 
possibilit y that the AE is associated with the study  drug? ”
10.3 Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation
AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be mo nitored throughout the study  as fo llows: 
AEs will be reported from the signing of the ICF through [ADDRESS_183822] dose of study  drug or before init iation of new ant icancer therapy  (whichev er com es first)

15.2 Patient Information, Informed Consent, and Patient Authorization
Written consent documents will embody  the elements of informed consent as described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and th e ICH Gui delines for GCP and will be in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. The ICF, patient authorizat ion form (if applicable), and patient 
inform ation sheet (if applicable) describe the planned and permitted uses, transfers, and 
disclosures of the patient’s personal and personal health informat ion for purposes of conducting 
the study. The ICF and the patient informat ion sheet (if applicable) further explain the nature of the 
study , its object ives, and potential risks and benefit s, as well as the date informed consent is given. 
The ICF will detail the requirements of the participant and the fact that he or she is free to 
withdraw at any  time wi thout giving a reason and without prejudice to his or her further medical 
care.
The invest igator i s responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the ICF 
and if applicable, the patient authorizat ion form. The ICF, patient authorizat ion form (if 
applicable), and patient information sheet (if applicable) must be approved by [CONTACT_4198].
The ICF, patient authorization form (if applicable), and patient informat ion sheet (if applicable) 
must be written in a language fully co mprehensible to the prospective pat ient. It is the 
responsibilit y of the inves tigator to explain the detailed elements of the ICF, patient authorizat ion 
form (if applicable), and patient informat ion sheet (if applicable) to the patient. Information should 
be given in both oral and wr itten form whenever possible and in the manner dee med appropriate by 
[CONTACT_4186]. In the event the patient is not capable of rendering adequate written informed 
consent, then the patient’s legally  acceptable representati ve m ay provi de such consent for the 
patient in accordance with applicable laws and regul ations. 
The patient, or the patient’s legally acceptable representative, must be given ample opportunit y to: 
(1) inquire about details of the study and (2) decide whether or not to participate in the study. If the 
patient, or the pati ent’s l egally ac ceptable representative, determines he or she will part icipate in 
the study , then the ICF and pat ient authorizat ion form (if applicable) must be signed and dated by 
[CONTACT_102], or the patient’s legally acceptable representative, at the time of consent and before the 
patient entering into the study. The pat ient or the patient’s legally acceptable representative should 
be instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknames, using blue or black ballpo int ink. The 
investigator must also sign and date the ICF and patient authorization (if applicable) at the time o f 
consent and before the patient enters into the study; however, the sponsor may allow a designee o f 
the invest igator to sign to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_1289]. 
Once signed, the original ICF, pati ent authori zation form (if applicable), and pat ient informat ion

15.3 Patient Confidentiality
The sponsor and designees affirm and upho ld the principle of the patient’s right to protection 
against invasio n of privacy. Throughout this study , a pati ent’s source data will be linked to the 
sponsor’s clinical study  database or documentation only via a unique ident ificat ion number. As 
permitted by [CONTACT_39823], limited patient attributes, such as sex, age, or date 
of birth, and patient initials may be used to verify the pat ient and accuracy  of the pati ent’s unique

(C1D1). 
cPerform vital sign measurements, including HR and BP measurements, before dosing on C1D1, C1D8, and on C1D15. Also, for all p atients in Western safety cohort and the first [ADDRESS_183861] before PK sampling. 
dAll 12 -lead safety ECG recordings should be made with the patient in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. On C1D1, C1D8, and C1D15, a 12- lead safety ECG should be recorded after vit al sign 
measurements and before any specified predose PK sampling. 
eTriplicate ECGs: Refer to Table C in this appendix for triplicate ECG/PK collection on C1D1 and C1D8. Patients in the Western safety cohort and the first [ADDRESS_183862] maintain at supi[INVESTIGATOR_31774] 15 minutes. A Holter monitoring device will be used for triplicate ECG assessment. Three ECGs (approximately 1 m inute apart) will be extracted at prespecified time 
points at ti mes that match the times of Day 1 and Day 8 postdose PK/ECG sampling. 
fBaseline CT (with contrast) or MRI scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis must be obtained within [ADDRESS_183863] or MRI on patients with bone metastases. See Section 9.3.15 for more details
gIncluding serious pretreatment events; see Section 10.1.[ADDRESS_183864] will be performed only for women of childbearing potential during screening and a gain at C1D1 (Baseline) if the screening 
test was performed more than [ADDRESS_183865] dose of TAK -931 is administered (within the 4 days 
before C1D1), or as otherwise required by [CONTACT_427]. If C1D1 serum pregnancy results will not be available before dos ing, a urine pregnancy test may be performed. 
Additional pregnancy testing may be performed during the study at the discretion of the investigator, upon request of an IEC/ IRB, or if required by [CONTACT_427].
jThe hematology and chemistry blood samples for C1D1 may be collected within 4 days before dosing to ensure patient eligibility on C1D1. If screening clinical laboratory testing 
was performed within 4 days before the C1D1 dose, then testing does not need to be repeated on C1D1. See Section
 9.3.14 for an analyte listing. For patients in the DLT observation 
window (C1, safety lead -in cohort), any symptomatic or asymptomatic Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities need to be retested every 2 days until the event is ≤Grade 2. For patients in 
the disease specific cohorts in Cycle 1, new clinically significant Grade ≥3 laboratory results should be repeated a minimum of every 3 days until recovered to Grade ≤2. Safety 
laboratory measurements outside C1D1 can be collected up to [ADDRESS_183866] be followed and collected according to the schedule for CEA (CRC) and CA -19-9 (pancreatic cancer) measu rements. 
lComplete urinalysis with qualitative analysis for protein at Screening and C1D1. Refer to Section 9.3.14 for required clinical urinalysi s tests. If screening urinalysis was performed 
within 4 days before the C1D1 dose, urinalysis does not need to be repeated on C1D1. 
nA blood sample will be obtained before administration of TAK -931 at C1D1, C3D1, C5D1, and EOT/relapse for plasma and subs equent ctDNA isolation.

specimen) is acceptable. An FFPE blocks or ≥10 unstained slides are required. 
q A fresh skin tissue biopsy sample (2 to 4 mm) will be obtained from all patients in the Western safety cohort either during screening or predose on C1D1 and postdose on Day [ADDRESS_183869] paired (predose and on -treatment) tumor biopsies, an optional skin tissue biopsy will be collected simultaneously, if possible, with the 
tumor collection. 
rIf FFPE tumor tissue is not available (see footnote p), a fresh tumor tissue biopsy sampl e must be obtained. If a new biopsy is performed, it should be obtained during the screening 
period with a nonsignificant risk procedure in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. For patients in the Western safety cohort, th is biopsy is optional. 
sPaired tumor biopsies (predose and postdose on any dosing day after the completion of 3 consecutive days in Cycle 1 [Day 4 and after]) are optional and the patient needs to consent 
specifically for them (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). The predose biopsy can be collected any time before the first dose of TAK -931. The postdose biopsy can be collected 4 to 9 hours 
postdose on any dosing day after completion of 3 consecutive days of TAK -931 treatment (Day 4 and later). It is recommended that the postdose biopsy be taken from the same lesion 
or, at least, from the same organ as at Baseline. Fresh tumor biopsies are optional for patients enrolled in the Western safety  cohort. F resh biopsies should meet the characteristics of 
nonsignificant risk, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
t Patient -reported outcomes (HRQOL) should be completed before any other study procedures are performed. 
Note: Tests and procedures should be performed on schedule; patients may remain on study with occasional changes (±3 days) for holidays, vacations, and other administra tive 
reasons.

The corresponding text has been revised throughout the protocol.
Change 1: SAE reporting requirements were changed fro m EDC -based reporting to 
paper/e -mail/fax -based reporting.  
The primary  change occurs in Secti on 10.2 Procedures for Recording and Repo rting Adverse 
Events and Serious Adverse Events :
Initial 
wording: …
Regardless of causalit y, SAEs m ust be reported (see Section 10.3 for the period of 
observat ion) by [CONTACT_158202] [ADDRESS_183883] igators should transmit an electronic data capture (EDC) SAE report; 
however, if transmissio n of an EDC SAE report is not feasible, a facsimile of the 
completed [COMPANY_005] paper -based SAE fo rm may be sent. A sample o f the paper -based 
SAE form and processing directions are found in the Study  Manual . Informati on in 
the SAE report or form must be consistent with the data provided on the eCRF. 
If informat ion not available at the time o f the first report becomes available at a later 
date, the invest igator will transmit a fo llow-up EDC SAE report (or a paper -based 
SAE form if an EDC SAE report is not feasible) or provide other documentation 
immediately  within 24 hours of receipt. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_158159] (eg, ECGs, laboratory  tests, di scharge summary , postm ortem  resul ts) 
shoul d be sent to the addressee, if requested. 
All SAEs should be fo llowed up unt il reso lution or permanent outcome o f the event. 
The timelines and proce dure for follow- up reports are the same as those for the 
initial report. 
…
Amended 
or new 
wording:…
Regardless of causalit y, SAEs (as defined in Section 10.1.2) must be reported (see 
Secti on10.3 for the peri od of  observati on) by  [CONTACT_158203] (contact [CONTACT_51259]). 
This should be done by [CONTACT_51260] [ADDRESS_183884] igators should transmit an electronic data capture (EDC) 
SAE report; however, if transmissio n of an EDC SAE report is not feasible, a 
facsimile of the co mpleted [COMPANY_005] paper -based SAE form may be sent. A sample of 
the paper -based SAE form and processing direct ions are found in the Study  Manual . 
Inform ation in the SAE re port or form must be consistent with the data provided on 
the eCRF. The SAE Form, created specifically by [CONTACT_11750], will be provided to 
each clinical study site. A sample of the SAE Form may be found in the Study

TAK-[ADDRESS_183885] report becomes available at a later 
date, the investigator will transmit a follow-up EDC SAE report (or a paper-based 
SAE form if an EDC SAE report is not feasible) or provide other documentation 
immediately within 24 hours of receipt. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_158160] (eg, ECGs, laboratory tests, discharge summary, postmortem results) 
should be sent to the addressee, if requested. 
All SAEs should be followed up until resoluti on or permanent outcome of the event. 
The timelines and procedure for follow-up reports are the same as those for the 
initial report. 
…
Prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157194] a matter of practical convenience is not to be 
considered to be an AE unless the patient’s condition deteriorated.
…
Rationale for Change: EDC SAE reporting is intended for new studies. EDC systems are not in 
place yet for this study.  CCI

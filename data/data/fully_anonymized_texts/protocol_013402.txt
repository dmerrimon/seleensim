Section 6.2: Secondary Objectives  
A secondary outcome will incl ude time from birth to either (a) requirement of ≥16-hour 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_149367] (includes BiPAP) continuously for >2 weeks in the absence of an 
acute reversible illness or (b) death. 
Secondary outcomes will also include the change in CHOP -INTEND from baseline score 
and demonstration of improveme nt of  motor function  and muscle strength as determined 
by [CONTACT_149436].   Additionally, AveXis, Inc. may opt to provide 
videos of the physical exams, CHOP-INTEND assessments, and/or Bayley Scale 
assessments to an independent, blinded reviewer for confirmation of the development 
milestones.  
Rationale for Change  
Achievement of motor milestones will serve as a more clinically meaningfully efficacy  endpoint. 
 
Section 6.3: Exploratory Objectives 
Exploratory outcome measures will be tested during the study as part of the program and product development plan; however if exploratory measurement results show efficacy and primary outcomes do not reach sta tistical significance, the only interpretation is that the  results show a 
trend toward benefit but can never supersede primary measures.  These exploratory outcome 
measures will include: 
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-[ADDRESS_172066]: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / 21 Apr 2016  
 
Confidential  4 • ACTIVE -mini (Ability Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation- mini) evaluation of 
infant movement ability.  
• Patient functional measures using the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101967] (CHOP- INTEND).  This test has been studied and validated in 
infants with spi[INVESTIGATOR_149368].19 
• Bayley Scales of Infant Development version [ADDRESS_172067] will administered if the child  
reaches or exceeds a score of 60 out of 64 on the CHOP- INTEND. 
• Motor neuron function will be assessed via evoked compound motor action potentials (CMAP) and motor unit number estimation (MUNE). 
• Pathological status of muscles will be quantified by [CONTACT_149437] l Impedance Myography  (EIM).  
• The age at which significant motor milestones are achieved will be assessed using a standard Motor Milesto ne Development Survey shown in Table 10 in Section  11.1.10. 
• Compel ling, demonstrable, documented evidence of efficacy as determined by [CONTACT_149438][INVESTIGATOR_149369]/or captured by [CONTACT_1130]/parent/legal guardian at home.  
Rationale for Change  
Determination tha t “compelling evidence” of efficacy may be documented via video -taped 
physical therapy sessions, showing motor milestone achievement. 
 
Section 7.1: Overall Study Design  
The proposed clinical trial is an open-label, single injection ascending dose study of self -
complementary  AAV9 carrying the SMN gene under the control of a hybrid CMV 
enhancer/chicken  AVXS -101 delivered one-time through a venous catheter inserted into a 
peripheral vein (arm, leg, or scalp) of Type 1 spi[INVESTIGATOR_149370]. The prim ary analysis for efficacy will be assessed when all patients reach 13.6 months of 
age (a database lock will be performed at the time point at which all patients reach 13.6 
months of age).  A follow- up safety analysis will be completed at the time point at which the 
last patient reaches [ADDRESS_172068]- dose.
 
Rationale for Change  
In a natural history study of SMA Type 1 survival,20 the distribution of the age at reaching the 
combined endpoint of death or respi[INVESTIGATOR_149371]2 copy number.  T he median 
age at the combined endpoint for subjects with two ( 2) SMN2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_26615] 10.5 (IQR 8.1-13.6).  
Therefore,  13.6 months is the expected age at which 75% of SMA Type 1 patients with two ( 2) 
SMN2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_149372]/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399].  
 
The following are procedures that are being conducted for study purposes, but were not 
described/outlined as appropriate in previous versions of the protocol (s): 
Section 8.1 Inclusion Criteria  
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-[ADDRESS_172069]: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / [ADDRESS_172070] meet all of the following Inclusion Criteria: 
1. Six months of age and younger1 at day of vector infusion with Type 1 SMA as defined by 
[CONTACT_149439]: 
a. Bi-allelic SMN1 gene mutations (deletion or point mutation) with two copi[INVESTIGATOR_149373]2 (no more and no fewer). 
b. Patients [ADDRESS_172071] nine subjects enrolled under previous version(s) of the protocol could be nine months of age or 
younger.   Inclusion revised to reflect six months of age or younger in 24 Jun 2015 Protocol Addendum #2.  
Initial genetic testing and diagnosis completed at an institution/laboratory other than 
Nationwide C hildren’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/Ohio State University is acceptable if proper 
documentation is received at Nationwide Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], verified by [CONTACT_978], and filed 
in the patient’s medical record.  
AveXis, Inc.  may opt to confirm all genetic diagnoses through a con tracted third -party 
laboratory utilizi ng an additional blood sample collected during a post -dose visit. 
Rationale for Change  
For clarification purposes, added notation that baseline diagnostic genetic testing was not 
completed at Nationwide Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149374].  As noted, AveXis, Inc.  may opt to 
have baseline blood samples for all subjects re- tested at a commercial laboratory to ensure 
consistent results for all subjects in the trial.  As these samples would be run after enrollment/dosing was c omplete, results would not impact subject eligibility.  
Section 11.8.[ADDRESS_172072] achieves two cons ecutive CHOP -INTEND scores of ≥62, a 
teleconference will be conducted between PI, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], and  AveXis, Inc. to review 
the subject status and determine whether or not continued CHOP -INTEND assessments 
are necessary.  A decision will be reached and confirmed in writing following the teleconference.  If decided that no further assessments are necessary, the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_149375] -INTEND assessment at subsequent visits; otherwise 
CHOP -INTEND assessments will continue monthly.  
CHOP -INTEND examinations will be videotaped in accord with the Videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_149376].  
Rationale for Change:  
As patients on a normal development course age, CHOP- INTEND scores decrease over time as 
there are portions of the assessment that are specific to infant development.  As patients develop out of infancy, they no longer exhibit some motor functions in an appropriate way for some of 
the assessment sections to be scored.  As study subjects achieve a score of 64, more in line with a 
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-[ADDRESS_172073]: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / [ADDRESS_172074] was designed by [CONTACT_149440][INVESTIGATOR_149377]’ s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149378] 1 subjects in this trial; it 
is source from a collection of existing motor assessments.   See Appendix  5. 
Additionally, CHOP -INTEND and Bayley physical therapy assessment videos may be 
transferred to a centralized reviewer for independent determination of milestones achieved.  
Rationale for Change  
The Gross Motor Skills Checklist was developed as an assessment and added to the protocol as a 
method by [CONTACT_149441] a maximum CHOP -INTEND score of 64.  
 
Section 11.10 Video Evidence 
Physical therapy assessments and physician physical examinations required at each study visit 
will be videotaped in an effort to produce compelling, demonstrable, documented evidence of effica cy as determined by [CONTACT_149442].  Parent(s)/legal guardian(s) may also 
share home videos demonstrating achievement of functional abilities.  AveXis, Inc.  will provide 
a secure and confidential upload process for transfer and storage of the videos from NCH to a contracted third -party vendor that will compi[INVESTIGATOR_149379], Inc.

Section 11.19.11 Saliva, Urine, Stool Collection  
Saliva, urine, and stool samples will be collected for viral shedding studies.  Saliva will be 
collected from the patient’s mouth with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_149381].  200 −500 µL of urine will 
be collected from patients’ soiled diapers by [CONTACT_149443] a cot ton ball.  Pea- sized fecal samples 
will be collected from patients’ soiled diapers.  Each of these samples will be placed in a 
DNAse/RNAse -free Eppendorf tube with locking top.  The tubes will be stored in a -80°C 
freezer.  
Rationale for Change  
Saliva, urine, and stool samples will be collected to study viral shedding.

of the SMN-Δ7 mouse model for SMA from a median of 15.5 days to over 1 year, following 
intravenous delivery to the facial vein.  This clinical trial is an open -label, single  injection

5.1 Background and Preliminary Data 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_149392] a neurogenetic disorder caused by a loss or mutation in the survival motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1) on chromosome 5q13, which leads to reduced SMN protein levels and a selective dysfunction of motor neurons.  SMA is an  autosomal recessive, early childhood 
disease with an incidence of 1:11,[ADDRESS_172110] common and severe form (Type 1), hypotonia and progressive weakness 
are recognized in the first few months of life, leading to diagnosis by 6 months of age and then 
death due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_149393].  SMA Type 1 is the leading genetic cause of infant death.  Motor neuron loss in SMA Type 1 is profound in the early postnatal period (or may even 
start in the pre -natal period), whereas motor neurons in Type [ADDRESS_172111] not resulted in clinical benefit (www.ClinicalTrials.gov, and Darbar, et al17).  A dose 
escalation trial of scAAV9.CB.SMN will provide information for the potential gene transfer has 
in treating Type [ADDRESS_172112] chosen Spi[INVESTIGATOR_102011] (SMA) Type 1 as the target for this gene therapy 
study.  We believe there is a strong rationale for this based on studies of the natural history of this disease.  The class ification of SMA is shown below ( Table 5 ); Type 0 to Type 4 SMA is 
described.  SMA is conventionally classified into four phenotypes on the basis of age of onset 
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-[ADDRESS_172113]: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / [ADDRESS_172114] motor function achieved, with an additional phenotype (t ype 0) to  describe the 
severe forms of antenatal -onset spi[INVESTIGATOR_11902].1,[ADDRESS_172115] 18 months, and children afflicted with this condition are 
able to maintain sitting unassisted but never walk independently.  SMA Type 3 patients attain the 
ability to walk unaided [Type 3a have onset <3yo; Type 3b have onset >3 yo].  SMA Type 4 is an adult onset disease.  The genetic cause for SMA is well established and is i ntimately  involved 
with one’s prognosis.  All forms of SMA are autosomal recessive in inheritance and  are caused 
by [CONTACT_149449] 1 (SMN1) gene.  Humans also carry a second nearly 
identical copy of the SMN1 gene called SMN2 .
3  Both the SMN1 and SMN2 genes express 
SMN protein, however, the amount of functional full-length protein produced by [CONTACT_102134]2 is much 
less (by 10 -15%) than that produced by [CONTACT_102134]1.3-[ADDRESS_172116] 
higher SMN2 copy numbers.6-7  Quantitative analysis of SMN2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_14953] 375 pa tients with Type 
1, Type 2, or Type 3 SMA showed a significant correlation between SM N2 copy number and 
SMA type, as well as, duration of survival.  80% of patients with  Type 1 SM A carry one or two 
SMN2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 82% of patients with Type 2 SMA carry three SMN2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and 96% of patients with Type 3 SMA carry three or four SMN2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
8  Among 113 patients with Type 1 SMA, 9 
with one SMN2 copy lived <11 months, 88/94 with two SMN2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_149394] <21 months, and 
8/10 with three SM N2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_149394] 33–[ADDRESS_172117] predictiv e factor in survival .9 
The severity of SMA type 1 is unequivocally demonstrated by [CONTACT_149450] -
Meier survival curves shown in Figure  1. 

AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-[ADDRESS_172118]: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / [ADDRESS_172119] into adult life.  This contrasts with SMA Type 1 where motor 
neuron loss is profound in the early postnatal period (or may even start in the pre-natal period, 
especially for SMA Type [ADDRESS_172120] three months of life).  The findings in Figure  1 confirm other pi[INVESTIGATOR_149395].
10,11,12  
From a clinical trials perspective these findings emphasize the  importance of targeting SMA 
Type 1 for gene transfer of SMN2 in hopes of rescuing neurons at this critical stage.  Ultimately, 
the goal is to modify the SMA Type 1 phenotype leading to a milder course and prolonged 
survival, as we see in SMA Type 2 or 3 patients. 
These findings more clearly provide the rationale for a clinical gene transfer trial in the younger 
patients making it more difficult to justify even Phase I safety trials in  older (SMA Type 2 or 3) 
subjects.  Based upon what we know about the natural history of SMA, gene transfer in the older, 
less severe SMA types (2, 3, and 4), is less likely to have a significant, clinical effect than it 
would in the younger Type [ADDRESS_172121] of the clinical trial, in some 

AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-[ADDRESS_172122]: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / [ADDRESS_172123] good reason to believe that there are very few safety issues to b e concerned about 
when targeting the SMA Type 1 group for this clinical gene therapy trial.  Overexpression of 
SMN has been shown to be well tolerated in both mice and non-human primates, and in humans 
high copy number of SMN2 poses no risk (as seen in Type 2, 3, and [ADDRESS_172124] high 
SMN2 copy number).  This allows us to utilize robust, ubiquitous expression systems (like the CB-promoter) to ensure sustained, high-level SMN expression.  Additionally, it is important to 
point out that recombinant scA AV can be employed for this trial because of the small size of the 
SMN gene.  This enables efficient packaging and allows for efficient gene transfer with lower viral titers (a safety consideration), compared with prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l single -stranded AAV vectors. 
Our recent studies using scAAV9.CB.SMN show a robust postnatal rescue of SMA mice with correction of motor function, neuromuscular electrophysiology and survival after a onetime delivery of vector.

spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], and muscle of scAAV9.C B.SMN -treated animals, compared to untreated SMA mice  
(although lower than WT controls).  SMA animals treated with either scAAV9.CB.SMN or 
scAAV9.CB.GFP on P1 were assessed for their rig hting ability and were compared to WT 
control mice and untreated mice.  WT controls could right themselves quickly, whereas the SMN - and GFP- treated SMA animals showed difficulty at P5.  However, by P13, 90% of SMN -
treated animals could right themselves compared with 20% of GFP- treated controls  and 0% of 
untreated SMA animals .  At P18, SMN- treated animals were larger than GFP -treated  animals, 
but smaller than WT controls.  Locomotive ability of the SMN- treated mice was nearly identical 
to WT control s, as assayed by [CONTACT_149451]. 
Survival of SMN- treated SMA animals compared with GFP -treated SMA animals was

the tropi[INVESTIGATOR_149398]9, resulting in a ‘chimeric’ animal in which 
some cells were not transduced .  Additionally, the smaller size suggests an embryonic role for 
SMN .  Most remarkably , SMN -treated mice survived well past 250 days of age.

Toxicology biodistribution studies were generated by [CONTACT_149452].  In the non- GLP  
studies, 24 mice and 4 non- human primates (NHPs) were injected, by [CONTACT_149453], 
with scAAV9.CB.SMN.  To assess toxicity and safety scAAV9.CB.SMN was injected  into P1 
wild type FVB mice with either vehicle (PBS) (3 males/6 females) or 3.3 x 1014 vg/kg of 
scAAV9.CB.SMN (6 males/9 females) via the facial temporal vein.  This dose was previously 
shown to be most effic acious in the Δ7 mouse model of SMA16.  P1 mice were used in 
anticipation of simulating potential clinical studies in infants, which is the planned  population for 
the first -in-human clinical trial.  All mice survived the injection procedure and the initial 24 -hour 
observation period without any signs of distress or weight loss.  Body mass  was measured and 
hands-on observations were performed weekly for the remainder of the study; neither revealed 
any difference between contr ol and treated cohorts ( Figure  3).

and clinical chemistries assessment (ALT, AST, ALK  Phos, creatinine, BUN, electrolytes, and 
CK).  All were  normal except for one variant at the [ADDRESS_172129]-injection and 8 mice 
at 180 days.  All organs were normal; in particular there  was no inflammation seen in any section 
from any organ (heart, liver, kidney, muscle, gonads, brain, lung, lymph nodes, and intestines). 
In the safety study for the four male Cynomolgus Macaque s, subjects were injected at 90 days of 
age to closely mimic the likely age of administration of treatment in SMA Type 1  infants.  The 
scAAV9.CB.SMN vector was administered one time by [CONTACT_149454] a dose of 6.7 x 1013/kg, which corresponds to the lowest dose tested for which SMN -Δ7 
mice showed a significant increase of survival.  Animals were followed for six months until they 
were sacrificed at approximately 9 months of age.  No adverse effects  were seen, and all clinical 
chemistries were normal.  T-cell immune response was teste d using ELISpot in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and all were negative at [ADDRESS_172130] injection. 
These mouse and monkey studies can be summarized as follows.  The serum chemistry  and 
hematology studies were unremarkable as was the histopath ology assessment.  The  NHP subjects 
mounted appropriate immune responses to capsid (but not to transgene), with very high 
transgene expression persisting at [ADDRESS_172131]- injection .  In conclusion, these studies provide 
strong evidence that systemically -delivered scAAV9.CB.SMN is safe and  well tolerated, even at 
the high doses required for penetration of the blood- brain barrier .13 
Formal IND -enabling GLP pharmacology, toxicology, and biodistribution studies were discussed 
with the  FDA at the Pre-IND meeting held January 2012.  The toxicology plan discussed with 
CBER was found to be acceptable for the initiation of this Phase I trial.

Confidential  24 6 TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND  PURPOSE  
6.1 Primary O bjective  
The primary  outcome for this clinical trial is safety.  Discontinuation criteria are based on  the 
development of unacceptable toxicity, defined as the occurrence of any one Grade III or higher, 
unanticipated, treatment- related toxicity that presents with clinical symptoms and requires 
medical treatment.  
6.2 Secondary O bjectives  
A secondary outcome will include time from birth to either (a) requirement of ≥16-hour 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_149367] (includes BiPAP) continuously for ≥2 weeks in the absence of an 
acute reversible illness , excluding perioperative ventilation or (b) death. 
Secondary outcomes will also include the change in CHOP- INTEND from baseline  score and 
demonstration of improvement of motor function and muscle strength as determined by 
[CONTACT_149455] .  Additionally, sponsor may choose to provide videos of the 
physical exams, CHOP -INTEND assessments, and/or Bayley Scale assessments to an 
independent, blinded reviewer for confirmation of the development milestones.

development plan; however if exploratory measurement results show efficacy and primary 
outcomes do not reach statistical significance, the only interpretation is that the  results show a 
trend toward benefit but can never supersede primary measures .  These exploratory outcome 
measures will include: 
• ACTIVE -mini (Ability Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation-mini) evaluation of 
infant movement ability.  
• Patient functional measures using the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101967] (CHOP-INTEND).  This test has been studied and validated in infants with spi[INVESTIGATOR_149368].
19 
• Bayley Scale of Inf ant Development version [ADDRESS_172134] will administered if the child reaches or exceeds a score of 60 out of 64 on the CHOP -INTEND.  
• Motor neuron function will be assessed via evoked compound motor action potentials (CMAP) and motor unit number estimation (MUNE). 
• Pathological status of muscles will be quantified by [CONTACT_149456] (EIM).  
• The age at which significant motor milestones are achieved will be assessed using a standard Motor Milestone Development Survey shown in Table 10 in Section  11.1.10. 
• Compelling, demonstrable, documented evidence of efficacy as determined by [CONTACT_149457][INVESTIGATOR_149369]/or captured by [CONTACT_1130]/parent/legal guardian at home.

Confidential  25 7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design 
The proposed clinica l trial is an open -label, single injection ascending dose study of self-
complementary  AAV9 carrying the SMN gene under the control of a hybrid CMV 
enhancer/chicken  AVXS -101 delivered one-time through a venous catheter inserted into a 
peripheral vein (arm, leg, or scalp) of Type 1 spi[INVESTIGATOR_149370]. 
The primary analysis for efficacy will be assessed when all patients reach 13.6 months of age (a 
database lock will be performed at the time point at which all patients reach 13.6 months of age).   A follow -up safety analysis will be completed at the time point at which the last patient 
reaches [ADDRESS_172136] a 3 week intra -cohort 
dosing interval between dosing of patient s within  a cohort to allow review of the safety analysis 
from five time points (days 1, 2, 7, 14, and 21) prior to dosing of the next patien t.  There will be 
at least a [ADDRESS_172137] six time points (days 1, 2, 7, 14, 21, and 
30) from all the patients  within a  cohort.  Safety analysis will be done by [CONTACT_149458], as well as, time for  decisions to be made about whether to implement a higher dose 
group.  Dose escalation will  be based on dose- limiting toxicity (DLT).  
Cohort [ADDRESS_172138] of three (3) SMA patients followed by [CONTACT_133075] 2A with a minimum of three 
(3) and no more than six (6) SMA patients to receive a single infusion at escalating doses.  
• Cohort 1 (Low Dose): 6.7 X 1013 vg/kg (n=3)  
• Cohort 2A  (Intermediate Dose): 2.0 X 1014 vg/kg (n≥3 and n≤6) 
Cohort 2B and Cohort [ADDRESS_172139] of three (3) SMA patients to receive a single infusion at escalating doses.  
• Cohort 2B: 2.0 X 1014 vg/kg (n=3)  
• Cohort 3 (High Dose) : 3.3 X 1014 vg/kg (n=3)  
Cohort 2B will be done first and if efficacy is favorable but does not fully improve subjects to 
normal, Cohort 3 at high dose will be implemented. 
Treatment of Cohort 3 is permitted  based on safety assessment presented in the IND .  A score of 
8 or higher on the Bayley Scales of Infant Developm ent will be considered the low end of 
normal.  If efficacy (defined as any clinical improvement from baseline of either primary or 
exploratory outcome measures) is observed at the intermediate dose (2.0 X 1014 vg/kg), the 
Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_149399] a maximum of 9 
patients.  
If no clinically significant improvement without toxicity is observed, the possibility of adding  an 
additional escalation cohort at a higher dose will be discussed with the FDA, DSMB and r elevant 
oversight regulatory agencies.  
7.2 Number of Subjects  
A total of 15 subjects may be enrolled. 
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-[ADDRESS_172140]: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / [ADDRESS_172141] (DSMB) and safety monitor will monitor safety 
data on a continual basis throughout the trial.  The DSMB can recommend early  termination of 
the tr ial for reasons of safety.  Study enrollment will be halted by [CONTACT_149459] a Grade III , or higher adverse event toxicity that is unanticipated and 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug that presents with clinical symptoms 
and requires medical treatment .  This will include any patient death, important clinical laboratory 
finding, or any severe local complication in the injected area related to administration of the study agent.  If after review by [CONTACT_4318], IRB, IBCSC,  NIH -OBA and FDA, the decision is 
made to continue, the study will proceed according to the dose escalation schedule. 
Subjects may be discontinued from further study participation or the trial may be terminated for 
the following reasons: 
• Development of unacceptable toxicity, defined as the occurrence of any one Grade III or 
higher, unanticipated, treatment- related toxicity that presents with clinical symptoms and 
requires medical treatment.  
• Patient requires at least 16 -hour per day of ventilation support for breathing, including 
BiPAP use,  for ≥14 consecutive days in the absence of an acute reversible illness , excluding 
perioperative use 
• Death  
• Failure to comply with protocol-required visits or procedures 
• Study is terminated by [CONTACT_3211] 
• Subject withdrawal of consent to participate further

In general, the high dose will not be diluted for a total dose of 3.3 X 1014 vg/kg.  The low doses 
will be diluted to the same volume as the high dose and split equally.  Thus, the vector will be 
withdrawn from each vial for the low doses, pooled together, and diluted in an amount of 
normosol-R to equal the total volume used in the high dose cohort in a given weight range for a 
total dose of 6.7 X 1013 vg/kg.  
Preparation of the vector will be done aseptically in a class II BSC by [CONTACT_149462].  The vector will be allowed to warm to room 
temperature prior to infusion to avoid the possibility of particle aggregation following product 
thaw.  The vector-containing syringes will be delivered to the designated PI[INVESTIGATOR_149406].  It 
will be delivered inside a sealed leak-proof bag, carried in a designated container at room 
temperature and administered to the subject within 8 hours from removal from the -80°C freezer.

analysis will be done by [CONTACT_149463], as well as, time for  decisions to be 
made about whether to implement a higher dose group.  Dose escalation will  be based on dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT)  as described in Section  11.1.1. 
The investigators will confer with the IRB and DSMB on all Grade III or higher adverse  events 
with [ADDRESS_172170] waste container. 
The empty syringes used for delivery of the vector will be resealed in the procedure room and 
placed into a small labeled box.  The empty vials used to prepare the syringes will also be 
maintained in the pharmacy.  Both will be returned to a secure -80°C freezer archival storage separate from the unused vector storage.

12 ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
12.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre-
existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or 
not considered casually related to the product.  In clinical studies, an AE can include an 
undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
All AE s that occur after any patient has been enrolled, before treatment, during treatment, or 
within [ADDRESS_172192] be 
recorded in the eCRF . 
12.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., baseline, treatment, 
washout, or follow -up), and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, 
that fulfils one or more of the following: 
• Results in death  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a  congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes list ed above.  
All SAEs that occur after any patient  has signed informed consent, before treatment, during 
treatment, or within [ADDRESS_172193] be recorded on forms provided by [CONTACT_149470], Inc. 
12.1.3 Other Adverse Event (OAE)  
OAEs may be identified by [CONTACT_149471] , if applicable , also by [CONTACT_149472].  
Significant adverse events of particular cl inical importance, other than SAEs and those AEs 
leading to discontinuation of the patient/subject from the study, will be classified as OAEs.  For 
each OAE, a narrative may be written and included in the Clinical Study Report. 
12.[ADDRESS_172194] for each AE (Unrelated, Possibly Related or Probably Related) .  The 
Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, t here is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].  If no valid reason 
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-[ADDRESS_172195]: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / 21 Apr 2016  
 
Confidential  45 exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “unrelated.”  If there is 
any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause- and-effect relationship 
between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related.” 
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be 
“possible” or “probable” the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product 
for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. 
12.3 Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_149473]/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235].  Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and pulse need not be reported as AEs.  However, abnormal values that constitute an SAE or lead to 
discontinuation of administration of study drug must be reported and recorded as an AE.  
Information about AEs will be collected from Day -[ADDRESS_172196] medical terminology when possible.  For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it 
caused the patient to discontinue the study . 
Events will be graded in accord with Table 9. 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468]  12.1.2.  An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious. 12.4 Reporting Adverse Events  
All SAEs (related and unrel ated) will be recorded from the signing of consent form until [ADDRESS_172197] complete, sign and date the SAE pages, verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE pages with the corresponding source documents, and send notification to AveXis, Inc., as per the Safety Management Plan . 
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be provided to AveXis, Inc. within 5 calendar  days of receipt for events that are unexpected and/or 
possibly/probably/definitely related to the investigational product.  This information should be 
provided on a follow-up SAE form and placed with the original SAE information and kept with 
the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or study file.  Follow-up information for events that are not unexpected and are not related to the investigational product should be provided to AveXis, 
Inc. within 7 calendar  days of receipt. 
AveXis, Inc. is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authoriti es of certain events.  It 
is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB of all SAEs that occur at his or her site, as per the IRB’s reporting guidelines. 
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-[ADDRESS_172198]: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / [ADDRESS_172199] quarterly; this data will also be provided to 
the DSMB for quarterly review.  If AveXis or the DSMB determines there are any emerging safety 
signals and/or trends that may warrant reporting to appropriate regulatory authorities, AveXis will 
report these events in aggregate.  
[ADDRESS_172200] (DSMB) will act in an advisory capacity to review  
participant safety and study progress for the clinical trial.  Responsibilities of the DSMB are  to: 
• review the research protocol, informed consent documents and plans for data and safety 
monitoring; 
• evaluate the progress of the trial, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit,  trial 
site performance, and other factors that can affect study outcome;  
• consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on participant safety or the ethics of the trial; 
• review study performance, make recommendations and assist in the resolution of problems reported by [CONTACT_079]; 
• protect the safety of the study participants;  
• review safety data to determine whether to recommend dose escalation; 
• review quarterly safety data to determine safety signals or trends;  
• ensure the confidentiality of the trial data and the results of monitoring; and, 
• assist by [CONTACT_57018], enrollment, and sample size 
and/or data collection. 
13.1 DSMB Reporting and Meetings  
Reports describing the status of the study will be prepared by [CONTACT_149470], Inc.  and/or the Principal 
Investigator’s staff and sent t o the DSMB at least quarterly , or at the DSMB’s request.  A 
meeting (either by  [CONTACT_149474]) with the DSMB will be scheduled after Day  [ADDRESS_172201] patient in each cohort, or at the DSMB’s request.  Reports will be  submitted prior 
to a scheduled meeting for review by [CONTACT_4318].

Confidential  54 20 APPENDICES  
APPENDIX 1 DECLARATION OF HELSI NKI : ETHICAL PRINCIPLES FOR 
MEDICAL RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECT S 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964 and amended by 
[CONTACT_941]: 
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_172223] WMA General Assembly, Washington DC, [LOCATION_003], October 2002 (Note of Clarification 
added) 
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 2004 (Note of Clarification added) 59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 2008 
64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable human ma terial and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs. 
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to 
physicians.   The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving 
human subjects to adopt these principles. 
General Principles  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my patient will be  my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics 
declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical care.” 
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well-being and rights of patients, including those who are involved in medical research.  The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subje cts. 
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments).  Even the best proven interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human subjects and protect their health and rights. 
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-[ADDRESS_172224]: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / [ADDRESS_172225] been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed.  
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-[ADDRESS_172226]: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / [ADDRESS_172227], incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treati ng and/or 
compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research 
study.  
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post- trial 
provisions. 
Research Ethics Committees  
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval 
to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins.  This committee must be 
transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence and must be duly qualified.  It must take into consideration the laws 
and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allow ed to reduce or 
eliminate any of the protections for research subjects  set forth in this Declaration.  
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies.  The researcher must provide 
monitoring information to the committee, especially information  about any serious adverse 
events.   No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by 
[CONTACT_942].  After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s f indings and conclusions. 
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-[ADDRESS_172228]: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / [ADDRESS_172229]’s freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing.  If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the 
non-writte n consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the general 
outcome and results of the study. 
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the phys ician must be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician 
or may consent under duress.  In such situations the informed consent must be sought by [CONTACT_30388]. 
28. For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized  representative.  These individuals 
must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by [CONTACT_11275], the research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden.  
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized  representative.  The potential 
subject’s dissent should be respected. 
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research   group.  In such 
circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative.  If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, 
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-[ADDRESS_172230]: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / [ADDRESS_172231] fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the 
research.  The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to 
withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient- physician relationship. 
32. For medical research using identifiable human materia l or data, such as research on material 
or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse.  There may be exceptional situations where consent 
would be impossible or impract icable to obtain for such research.   In such situations the 
research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
Use of Placebo  
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested agains t 
those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances: 
Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or 
where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is necessary to determine the efficacy or  safety of an intervention and the patients who receive 
any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of not receiving t he 
best proven intervention.  Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
Post-Trial Provisions 
34. In advance of a cl inical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should 
make provisions for post- trial access for all participants who still need an intervention 
identified as beneficial in the trial.  This information must also be disclosed to participant s 
during the informed consent process. 
Research Registration and Publication and Dissemination of Results  
35. Every research study involving human subjects must be registered in a publicly accessible 
database before recruitment of the first subject.  
36. Researcher s, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard 
to the publication and dissemination of the results of research.  Researchers have a duty to make publicly available the results of their research on human subjects and a re accountable 
for the completeness and accuracy of their reports.  All parties should adhere to accepted 
guidelines for ethical reporting.  Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must 
be published or otherwise made publicly available.  Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest must be declared in the publication .  Reports of research 
not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication. 
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-[ADDRESS_172232]: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / [ADDRESS_172233] been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorized  representative, may use an 
unproven intervention if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or alleviating suffering.  This intervention should subsequently be made 
the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy.   In all cases, new 
information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available. 
AveXis, Inc.  Protocol Number: AVXS -101-CL-[ADDRESS_172234]: AVXS -101 Protocol Version 14.0 / [ADDRESS_172235] 
will be collected and returned to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_149421]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Analysis of the tissue will be done to determine whether the vector transduced the expected motor neurons and if the SMN gene was expressed.  These results demonstrate whether 
the vector delivered the therapeutic gene as expected.  Tissue  samples collected will also be 
available for histology and immunohistochemistry, allowing  the state of the motor neurons and 
muscles to be examined.  
Specifically, tissue samples from the following organs and regions of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_149422] ( see Table  12 below ).  Tissue sample will b e frozen or fixed (eg. 2% 
paraformaldehyde) for appropriate analysis.  
Families will be asked to consent to the autopsy and tissue collection prior to any sign of 
moribund or death by [CONTACT_149479].  There are distinct consent forms  for 
the formal autopsy and for the research tissue collection.  This allows the families the  flexibility 
to participate in one or both of the research activities.

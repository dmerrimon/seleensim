Title:  Cardiac Resynchronization in the Elderly: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_564266]. Defibrillator Therapy 
(Randomized Trial and Observational). CRT – P vs. CRT – D.  
 
Précis:  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_564270] a two part aim at enrollment. Aim 1 is designed as a 
randomized, controll ed trial for older patients (≥75 years) who are indicated for CRT 
device implantation to receive a CRT -P or CRT -D. Information collected will help to 
assess the ability to enroll and retain older patients is a randomized controlled trial of 
CRT -P versus CR T-D in preparation for a large pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076]. Aim 2 is a non -
randomized, observational study of patients who were offered inclusion into Aim 1 but 
refused to participate. Aim 2 subjects present an opportunity to understand the reasons 
why older patients ma y refuse enrollment into a randomized trial as well as still 
allowing for collection of data regarding their chosen CRT device.  
 
Objectives:  Primary  Objective : Feasibility of enrolling and maintaining elderly heart failure

Heart failure (HF)1-[ADDRESS_741214] decades, the long -term prognosis for patients 
with HF remains poor with less than 50% of patients surviving five  years after the initial diagnosis. A 
characteristic feature of HF is that it is a progressive disease with patients having repeated and 
progressively more frequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_564272]. HF puts an overwhelming 
burden on patients as evid enced by [CONTACT_564303] (QOL). It also has a 
marked impact on the economics of our health system accounting for over 50 billion dollars in annual 
national healthcare expenditure.  
Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an establ ished therapy in HF6. HF patients with 
severe cardiomyopathy and ventricular conduction abnormalities, as demonstrated by a wide QRS 
waveform on surface electrocardiogram (>120 ms), who continue to suffer from HF symptoms (New 
York Heart Association Classe s II, III, and ambulatory IV) despi[INVESTIGATOR_564273]

2 INTRODUCTION:  BACKGROUND  INFORMATION  AND  SCIENTIFIC  RATIONALE  
2.1 BACKGROUND  INFORMATION  
CRT-P vs. CRT -D 
Protocol  A Version  v.0.6  
         24 MAY 2018  
PROTOCOL  SUMMARY   
4  including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, -blockers, and 
potassium -sparing diuretics can benefit from CRT with improved maximum oxygen consumptio n, 
exercise tolerance, and improved QOL7,8. Results of large, multicenter, randomized controlled trials 
such as Companion9 and Care -HF10 demonstrate, in addition, a significant decrease in the composite 
endpoint of death or HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_564274]. Studies also 
suggest a benefit of CRT on reducing the burden of ventricular arrhythmias11. It is estim ated that 
about 40% of patients who have systolic HF are CRT candidates by [CONTACT_564304]6.   
CRT-P versus CRT -D  
CRT can be delivered through a pacemaker (CRT -P) or a defibrillator (CRT -D). CRT -P 
devices are smaller (i.e. require a smaller sur gical incision at implantation) and cost a fraction of the 
price of CRT -D devices. Both CRT -P and CRT -D provide resynchronization to the failing heart 
through low  energy pacing impulses, but CRT -D can additionally deliver high -energy shock therapy 
to termi nate life -threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Compared to optimal pharmacological 
treatment, both CRT -P and CRT -D have been shown in randomized controlled trials9,[ADDRESS_741215] defibrillator recipi[INVESTIGATOR_564275]. Of 100 patients implanted with a defibrillator for primary prevention, ~23% 
receive appropriate shocks in response to life -threatening ventricular arrhythmias over long term 
follow -up12. In addition, it is estimated that about [ADDRESS_741216] of health care.  
CRT in the Elderly  
The U.S. and Europe  populations are  getting older. For instance, in the [LOCATION_002], the 
population aged 80 -84 years increased by 16.1%, and those aged 85 -89 years increased by 29.8% 
from 2000 to 201018. Although not excluded from the large CRT randomized trials9, 10, older patients 
(≥75 years)  have been largely underrepresented in these trials but still receive up to 40% of all CRT -
D’s in the [LOCATION_002]19,38. Moreover, older patients have a higher risk of death than younger 
patients based on competing causes of death and comorbid conditions, t hus stirring controversy 
regarding the role of defibrillator therapy in the elderly20-24. In addition, data from large CRT -D 
registries show that the odds of receiving appropriate defibrillator shocks decrease significantly with 
every decade of age25. 
 
 
CRT-P vs. CRT -D 
Protocol  A Version  v.0.[ADDRESS_741217]  
  A large, randomized, non -inferiority trial comparing mortality and QOL in older HF patients 
receiving CRT -P versus CRT -D therapy addresses a critical clinical practice area. Uncertainty about 
the comparative outcomes of older patients with  these two therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564276]: Older CRT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_564277] -D device 
that can deliver painful shocks, in the absence of any proof for incremental survival benefit with 
CRT -D ove r CRT -P. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_564278] (Aim 1) will be essential to the 
design of a large pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076]. This project will also have significant scientific impact because it will 
evaluate  the clinical and demographic predictors of choosing CR T-P or CRT -D therapy as well as 
patients’ change in their satisfaction with their decision [ADDRESS_741218] focused on expanding its clinical indications by 
[CONTACT_564305]. From the original surgically -implanted single -chamber ‘shock box’ devices used in survivors 
of cardiac arrest, the field moved steadily in the direction of expanding the indications to larger 
patient  groups. Today, defibrillators are implanted mainly for primary prevention of sudden cardiac 
death in patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (≤35%) who have never experienced a life -
threatening arrhythmia13, 14. They are also implanted in HF patients, a significant proportion of whom 
requires CRT devices9, 10. Driven by [CONTACT_564306], on -going trials are now investigating the role 
of the implantable defibrillator in patients with relatively preserved ventricular function (ejection 
fraction  between 36% and 50%)[ADDRESS_741219] investigates whether in a subset of patients (age ≥ 75 years) 
who are currently indicated for CRT device implantation, the smaller, simpler, and cheaper CRT -P is 
equivalent to the CRT -D in decreasing mortality and improving QOL. Of note, the proposed patient 
population overwhelmingly receives CRT -D therapy in th e U.S. today (>80% of cases)27, presumably 
because of an overinflated estimate of the protective role of defibrillator therapy in these patients, 
which is based on results extrapolated from other non -CRT trials, which were performed in different 
patient po pulations13-15. As opposed to studying the eligibility of non -indicated patients to receive an 
available therapy with the goal of expanding its clinical indications, we propose to study a subgroup 
of patients that is currently indicated for CRT -D therapy a ccording to the published national 
guidelines6 and CMS  reimbursement policies28 but is poorly represented in large randomized trials14 
and is least likely to benefit from defibrillator therapy.  
Our proposal is also important because it focuses exclusively on elderly patients who 
although not excluded from randomized trials of cardiac implantable electronic devices, have been 
grossly underrepresented in these trials9, 10, [ADDRESS_741220] cardiac implantable electronic device trial to  be performed exclusively in

6  
patients 75years of age or older, thus focusing on this large stratum of the population that is 
neglected in clinical cardiac research.  
  Finally, our research will create a cohort of patients who declined enrollment into the pi[INVESTIGATOR_48424]. This observational cohort will provide an opportunity to examine the 
clinical and demographic determinants of choosing CRT -P versus CRT -D in older HF patients. 
These decisions are typi[INVESTIGATOR_564279], after discussing the pros and cons with the treating physician. We will also assess the 
patients’ satisfaction with their decision to receive CRT -P versus CRT -D, at baseline and [ADDRESS_741221] patients’ choice of CRT -P versus CRT -D in HF 
management and the level of satisfaction of patients is novel in the field of cardiac implantable 
electronic device management.
 
 
For the Aim [ADDRESS_741222] medical care for HF patients. The  
risks involved with the implantation of either device are comparable to those of patients not enrolled 
in this research study. The risks include, but are not limited to, death, stroke, heart attack, damage to 
the heart or lungs or veins, infections, bleed ing, arrhythmias, or the need for emergent open -heart 
surgery. These risks are the same in patients undergoing the CRT -P or CRT -D implantation 
procedures but who are not enrolled in this research study.   Defibrillator devices include additional 
risk of  shocks that can occur when there is an abnormal heart rhythm detected by [CONTACT_8121]. 
Occasionally, the device may deliver a shock for unintended reasons (a benign heart rhythm or noise).  
For the observational Aim there is no additional health risk to the patients as only the patients’ 
health information will be collected. There is a risk that the patients personal or health information 
may become exposed outside of the observational trial.  This risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_564307]. This risk also applies to the Aim [ADDRESS_741223] benefits to the subjects as a result of their  participation in this study. 
The possible benefits of this procedure, using the pacemaker or the defibrillator, would be to help the 
subjects  heart function in a more synchronized manner. By  [CONTACT_4907], subjects  may 
contribute valuable in formation to medical science that may b enefit future patients with their  same 
condition . The sponsor cannot guarantee any benefit to the subjects for their participation in this 
study. 
 
The primary objective is to evaluate and determine the feasibility of enrolling and maintaining 
elderly heart failure patients in  the CRT -P versus CRT -D randomized trial. Additionally, for Aim 2, 
the observational arm will also maintain the same objective. Secondary objective is to examine the 
predictors of undergoing Pacemaker versus Defibrillator device implantation in elderly pat ients 
(≥75b years) .

The design of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_564280] 1 and 2 (Figure 1). Aim 1 
is designed as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_47669], controlled trial to be conducted at 4 institutions in the United 
States. It will randomize older patients (≥ 75 years) who are indicated for CRT device implantation to 
receive a CRT -P or a CRT -D. The choice of the design of Aim [ADDRESS_741224] data on rates of screening of patients, 
acceptance of enrollment, randomization, device implantation, and patient retention during follow -
up. Any design variations are likely to introduce biases which would increase the chances of flawed 
design of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076].  
Aim 2  is a non -randomized, observational study of patients who were offered inclusion into 
Aim 1 but refused to participate. We speculate that a majority of those patients who refuse 
participation in the randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_564281] a strong preferen ce for CRT -P or CRT -D. 
This cohort complements Aim 1 and presents an opportunity to understand the reasons why older 
patients may refuse enrollment into a randomized trial of CRT -P versus CRT -D and to examine the 
demographic and clinical determinants assoc iated with choosing a CRT -P versus a CRT -D device. It 
also provides the means to measure patients’ QOL and satisfaction32-34 with decision (CRT -P or 
CRT -D), at baseline and  6 months after enrollment into this observational cohort.

With the Aim 1 randomized subjects the primary endpoint is the  ability to enroll in the 
randomized controlled trial of CRT -P versus CRT -D patients. The subjects enrolled with aid in 
determining and assessing feasibility of screening, enrolling, randomizing, and retaining participants 
in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. 
 
 The subjects enrolled in Aim 2 will help to determine the clinical and demographic 
characteristics of subjects who refused participation in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_564282] 1.  Therefore the secondary endpoint is the determination of predictors of 
refusing participation in CRT -P versus CRT -D clinical trial.

PROTOCOL  SUMMARY   
9  Patients identified in Aim 1 who refuse to participate will be offered to enroll in the 
observational cohort of Aim 2 . Patients are eligible to enroll in the observational cohort  at the time 
of implant through fourteen days’ post procedure. There is  a separate written, informed consent 
designed specifically for the prospective observational study. Sites are to collect , from all patients 
enrolled in Aim  2, their reas on(s) why they refused enrollment in Aim 1. It is anticipate d that a 
majority of these patients will accept participating in the observational study of Aim [ADDRESS_741226] to duration and 
risk of the procedure, with the exception that CRT -D implantations require a larger ski n incision 
(~1.5 inches versus 0.75 inches).  
The research coordinator at each site will maintain a log of all patients who were screened for 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. The log should include reasons for why the patient did not meet either the inclusion or 
the exclu sion criteria. Additionally, the log would also include the patient’s reason for not wanting to 
enroll in the Aim [ADDRESS_741227] of patient’s full name [CONTACT_18131].  
 
During the consenting process subjects will be informed of their rights to withdraw from the 
study at any time without prejudice . Subjects who no longer attend their required in -office follow -up 
or are unable to be reached by [CONTACT_34675] [ADDRESS_741228]’s  participation in this research s tudy prior to the date that they formally withdraw 
consent may continue to be used and disclosed by [CONTACT_564309] h purposes.  
A patient may be discontinued from participating in this research if their device implantation 
procedure is not successful or is complicated by [CONTACT_564310] -up after device 
implantation according to the research protocol requ irements.

PROTOCOL  SUMMARY   
10   
This study  may be  temporarily suspended  or prematurely terminated if  there  is sufficient 
reasonable  cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study  suspension  or 
termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_564311]. 
It is the responsibility of each individual site to then notify their respective IRB.  If the  study is  
prematurely terminated  or suspended, the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_564283](s) for the  termination  or suspension to each site. The study may resume  once  
concerns about  safety,  protocol  compliance, data quality are  addressed  and satisfy the sponsor and 
IRB. Before resuming any study enrollments each individual site must first receive notification 
from the sponsor.  
 
Randomization Aim  
 Table 1  details the baseline data collected for every enrolled patient.  Baseline demographics 
(e.g. age, gender, and race) and clinical information (e.g. cardiac condition, comorbid conditions, 
echocardiographic parameters, EKG parameters) will be abstracted from  the electronic medical 
records of each participating institution. QOL questionnaires will be obtained at enrollment and at 
the 6 -month follow -up visit using both the RAND -36 health Status Inventory35 and the Minnesota 
Living with Heart Failure Questionnai re36. A paper and pencil option will be provided unless the 
patient is unable to read or write in which case the questionnaires will be administered verbally by a 
research coordinator.  
  Patients will be followed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_564284] e of enrollment until study 
closure. During follow -up, information will be collected on procedural details and complications, as 
well as clinical events including death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and emergency room visits. The events will 
be ascertained by [CONTACT_564312]. Data pertaining to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_564285]. If at 
another institution, these data will be collected by [CONTACT_564313] a r elease of medical 
records form and by [CONTACT_564314]. The cause of 
death and primary reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_564286] (arrhythmic or non -
arrhythmic) or non -cardiac by [CONTACT_564315] . For the CRT -D arm of the study, information about appropriate and inappropriate device 
shocks and anti -tachycardia pacing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_12308]. Importantly, rates of patient 
screening, enrollment, randomization, and retention in the study will also  be collected.

 The milestones of data collection are detailed in Table 2.  Patients enrolled in the randomized 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_564287], clinical, and pharmacological information collected after 
they sign written informed consent. QOL questionnaires and patient satisfaction will also be obtained 
at baseline. At the scheduled date of device implantation, which will be within 30 days of enrollment, 
procedural details will be collected including total and fluoroscopic durations of the procedure, device 
and l ead models, and any acute major or minor procedural complications. Patients whose device 
implantation procedure is scheduled > [ADDRESS_741229] interim information from patients or next of kin regarding non -
acute procedural complicat ions or clinical events (e.g. death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). Original medical 
records will be obtained for all clinical events and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_329097]. Each scheduled phone visit will also be associated with a remote device interrogation to 
assess device function and obtain information about stored arrhythmic events.  
Observational Aim  
Patients enrolled in the observational cohort of Aim [ADDRESS_741230] demographic and clinical data 
collected at baseline similarly to patients enr olled in the ra ndomized trial of Aim 1. Table 1  details 
the clinical variables collected at enrollment. Table 2  details the follow -up milestones. Also, 
patients enrolled in Aim 2 of this proposal will undergo QOL assessment using the RAND -36 
Health Status Inventory35 and the Minnesota Living with heart Failure Questionnaire36 (Appendices 
1 and 2) at baseline and at the [ADDRESS_741231] of care will also be collected for all patients enrolled in Aim 2.  
In addition, patients enrolled in the observational cohort will be asked about  their decision  to 
receive a CRT -P or CRT -D device and will be probed for the reason (s) behind their decision and 
their answers will be recorded. The actual type of device implanted (CRT -P versus CRT -D) will be 
ascertained at the time of the implantation procedure. At baseline and at the 6-month research call, 
they will be assessed for their level of satisfaction with their decision about device therapy (CRT -P 
or CRT -D) using the Satisfaction with Decision Scale32-34 (Appendix 3 ), which  assigns a score of 1 
to 5 to the answer of each of 6 questions pertaining to the patient’s level of satisfaction with their 
medical decision (lowest satisfaction score is [ADDRESS_741232] is 30).

occurred  per their respective reporting guidelines , and  if requ ired, to the NHLBI.  Each adverse event 
will be classified by [CONTACT_564316] ‘study -related’ or ‘not study related’ and  reviewed by [CONTACT_564317]. Serious adverse events (death, procedural complications, or  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_564288]) will be reported to the coordinating center and the local IRB (per their reporting 
guidelines) within [ADDRESS_741233] oversite of completed  SAE  Form s. Reporting of the forms should 
occur  within  the following  timelines:  
 
• All deaths  and immediately  life-threatening events,  whether  related  or unrelated  to the 
clinical trial , will be recorded  on the SAE  Form and submitted  to the study  sponsor  
within  48 hours  of site awareness.   
• Other  SAEs  regardless  of relationship  will be submitted  to the study  sponsor  within [ADDRESS_741234] quarterly  to assess  
safety  and efficacy  data on each arm of the study.  The DMSB will  operate  under  the rules  of 
an approved  charter  that will be written  and reviewed at  the organizational  meeting  of the 
DSMB.  At this time,  each data  element  that the DSMB  needs to  assess  will be clearly  defined. 
The DSMB  will provide  its input  to the NHLBI.

PROTOCOL  SUMMARY   
13   
The primary  responsibility  of the DSMB , an independent group of experts that a dvises the 
study investigators, is to oversee the progress of the study and review adverse events. All adverse 
events  in both arms of the clinical trial will be reviewed and adjudicated as ‘research -related’ or 
not. Stoppage rules of the clinical trial will be mandated by [CONTACT_564318] -cause mortality.  The DSMB will also review the overall progress of the 
trial, the quality of data collection, the safety and  confidentiality of data storage, and the overall 
management of the trial. A Data and Safety Monitoring report will  be generated including 
information on study status and enrollment milestones, quality of data collected, and  safety data.  
 
 
Randomized Aim  
 
Descriptive patient characteristics will be presented as mean (SD) for continuous  variables and 
n (%) for categorical variables.  Baseline comparisons of patients assigned to CRT -P vs. CRT -D will 
be performed using t -tests for continuous variables (Wilcoxo n rank -sum test if non -normally 
distributed) and chi -squared tests for categorical variables (Fisher’s Exact Test in case of small 
sample sizes within cells) to confirm that the randomized treatment arms are balanced in key 
demographics and potential confo unders.  The proportion of patients experiencing major/minor 
procedural complications within 30 days will be reported as n (%) within each treatment arm. These 
complication rates will be ascertained through review of pertinent medical records following the  
device implantation. Mortality [as n (%)] and the 6 -month QOL outcomes [as mean (SD)] within each 
treatment arm will be reported as well.  Cost of care for the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_564289] -up period will be measured  at the conclusion of the study and 
compared between the [ADDRESS_741235] (or Wilcoxon test if the data are non -normally 
distributed). Retention will be presented as n (%) completing at least 6 -month of follow -up.  In 
addition to the reten tion, in order to document the recruitment success, we will report the number of 
patients approached in order to successfully enroll n=50 patients, which will be useful information in 
planning a large scale trial . 
 
Observational Aim  
 
All patients who do no t enroll in the trial, but consent to be followed, will be enrolled in a 
parallel observational cohort.  Patients’ clinical and demographic characteristics will be examined and 
compared between CRT -P and CRT -D recipi[INVESTIGATOR_50582] t -tests, Wilcoxon rank -sum te sts, chi -squared 
tests, or Fisher’s Exact tests, as appropriate. Patient satisfaction among CRT -P vs. CRT -D recipi[INVESTIGATOR_564290]  6 months after enrollment using the Satisfaction with Decision Scale. 
The scores will be presented as me an (SD) and tested using a [ADDRESS_741236] (or Wilcoxon test if the 
data are non -normally distributed). Deceased patients will be included in the analysis (assigned the 
lowest possible satisfaction score of 6) to avoid survival bias in the event of differe ntial mortality in 
CRT -P vs. CRT -D. Cost of care will also be presented as mean (SD) and compared between the two 
cohorts using a [ADDRESS_741237] (or Wilcoxon test if the data are non -normally distributed).  
Multivariate modeling with adjustment for select ed patient factors will be considered if there are 
differences in CRT -P vs. CRT -D patients on key demographics, but the power to test this difference 
while accounting for multiple confounders may be limited.  
 
[ADDRESS_741238]  deviation = √(.5*(1 -
.5)/50) = 7%, meaning that a 95% confidence interval will have a maximum margin of error ± 13% in 
estimating true retention rate.  However, this margin -of-error may be lower (the further the sample 
retention is from 50%).  For example,  if 40/50=80% participants enrolled complete at least the 6 -
month visit, a 95% CI estimating the true 6 -month retention in this population would range from 
68.9-91.1%, information that can be used to guide recruitment estimates for the large scale trial.  The 
recruitment success rate can be estimated with even more precision, as there will be a larger N 
approached than N enrolled (and thus a smaller standard deviation of the sample proportion).  
 
Observational Aim  
 
It is anticipate d based on the physician an d patient surveys that approximately 40% of patients 
offered the opportunity to enroll in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_564291] 1 will do so.  
Therefore, 125 patients  will need to be screen  to enroll 50 in the  pi[INVESTIGATOR_37087].  It is assumed  
that 80% of those who decline participation in Aim [ADDRESS_741239] (or Wilcoxon rank -sum test, if non -normally 
distributed).  Assuming roughly equal numbers select CRT -D vs. CRT -P, enrollment of [ADDRESS_741240] 80% power to detect a difference in Satisfaction with Decision s cores if one 
treatm ent group’s average score is at  least 0.[ADDRESS_741241] deviations higher than the other group.  
 
Randomized Aim  
 
Based on the total volume of CRT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_564292] 4 enrolling institutions and the estimated 
percentage of acceptance of patients to enroll in a randomized CRT -P versus CRT -D trial provid ed by 
[CONTACT_099] (Appendix 1 ) and patient (Appendix 2 ) surveys, it is  anticipate d that the actual 
enrollment rate will exceed the rate needed to reach the target sample size of [ADDRESS_741242] to number of sites needed and duration of the enrollment phase.  
The present pi[INVESTIGATOR_564293] -blinded, i.e. patients and physicians 
know whether the implanted device is a CRT -P or CRT -D. In order to better understand if there are 
biases in the type of patients who accept randomization, the research is to be conducted as  described 
in Aim 2  by [CONTACT_564319] (compare p atients in Aim 1 versus Aim 2) as well as insights into the determinants 
of choosing a CRT -P versus CRT -D device (compare patients in Aim 2 who received CRT -P versus 
CRT -D).   
 
 
 
9.[ADDRESS_741243]. Since all investigators on this 
proposal are electrophysiologists, if the pi[INVESTIGATOR_564294] a major reason for 
patients’ refusal to participate in a randomized study of CRT -P vs. CRT -D is because of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_564295], then the pi[INVESTIGATOR_564296], which would likely 
mitigate this problem. This is one example for how the results of Aim [ADDRESS_741244] 
redacted source documents to aid in verification of informa tion provided for the sole purpose of the 
trial. With each adverse event that is reported, the sites will submit all source documents pertaining 
to that event. These records will also be redacted of any patient identifiable information and marked 
with the corresponding patient identification number and correlating case report form. Each site is 
responsible for maintaining a patient log that indicates the patient that corresponds with their study 
identification number.  
 
QC procedures  will be implemented beginning with the data entry system  and data QC checks  
will be run on the database  for reports to be generated.  Any missing data  or data anomalies  will be 
communicated  to the site(s)  for clarification/resolution.  Each site is responsible for conducting the  
clinical trial  and that the data is generated,  documented  (recorded), and reported  in compliance  with 
the protocol,  GCP,  and the applicable  regulatory  requirements . The investigational  sites will 
provide  access  to all trial related information , source  data/documents,  and reports  for the purpose  of 
monitoring and auditing by  [CONTACT_456].  
 
 
The investigator  at each site  will ensure  that this study  is conducted  in full conformity  with 
Regulations  for the Protection  of Human Subjects  of Research . All personal planning to be involved 
must ensure that the trial is performed and the data are generated, documented (recorded), and 
reported in compliance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirement(s) . 
 
The protocol,  informed  consent  form(s),  and all participant  materials  will be submitted  to the 
IRB for review  and approval.  Approval  of both the protocol  and the consent  form  must  be obtained  
before  any participant  is enrolled.  Any amendment  to the protocol  will require  review  and approval  
by [CONTACT_564320].  All changes  to the consent form  will 
also need  IRB approv al; a determination  will be made  regarding whether  previously  consented  
participants  need to  be re-consented.  Any changes to the consent by [CONTACT_564321].

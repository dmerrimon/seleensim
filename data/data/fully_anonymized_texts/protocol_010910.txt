CONFIDENTIAL    Protocol Synopsis 
Title:   An Open- label Extension (OLE) Study to Assess the Long-term Safety and Efficacy of 
AMG 334  
Study Phase:  Open -label extension  
Indication:   Prevention of chronic migraine  
Primary Objective:   To characterize  the safety and tolerability of long- term administration of 
AMG  334    
• Primary Objective of Clinical Home Use (CHU)  Substudy:   To assess users’ ability to 
administer a full dose of AMG 334 in home- use, using eith er two prefilled syringe s (PFS) or 
two prefilled autoinjector /pens (AI/pen). 
Secondary Objectives:    
• To characterize  the efficacy of long- term administration of AMG 334 as assessed by:  
• Change from baseline in monthly migraine days  
• Proportion of subjects with at least 50% reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days  
• Change from baseline in monthly acute migraine- specific medication treatment days  
• Change from baseline in monthly cumulative hours of headache  
• Secondary  Objective of CHU Substudy:   To assess  the safety and toler ability of AMG  334 
administered using two 1- mL PFS or two 1 -mL AI/pen s 
For the purpose of primary  analysis for secondary and exploratory endpoints in the 20130255 
open -label extension (OLE) study, baseline is defined as baseline of the AMG 334 20120295 
parent study (from the first day subject used eDiary in baseline at week -4 study visit through the 
day prior to study day 1).   However, change from week 8 through 12 data of the parent study  
(hereafter referred to as parent study Month 3 data) will also be evaluated.  
Hypotheses:   The clinical hypothesis is that long- term exposure of AMG 334 will be safe and 
well tolerated in subjects with chronic migraine 
Primary Endpoint:   Subject incidence of adverse events  
Secondary Endpoints: 
• Change f rom baseline in monthly migraine days at assessment timepoints  
• Achievement of  at least a 50% reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days at 
assessment timepoints  
• Change from baseline in monthly migraine- specific medication treatment days at assessment  
timepoints  
• Change from baseline in cumulative monthly headache hours at assessment timepoints  
Study Design:   This is a multicenter, open- label study designed to assess the long- term safety 
and efficacy of AMG 334.  Subjects who complete the 12- week double- blind treatment phase of 
the AMG [ADDRESS_32516] not yet enroll ed in the study will receive open- label AMG 334 140 mg every 
month ( QM) subcutaneous ( SC) for [ADDRESS_32517]:  AMG 334  
Protocol Number:  201 [ZIP_CODE] 
Date:  [ADDRESS_32518] the option 
to decrease open- label AMG 334 from 140 mg QM to 70 mg QM.  The 13- month open -label 
AMG  334 treatment phase will be followed by a 12- week safety follow -up visit ([ADDRESS_32519]).    
Sample Size:   All subjects who completed the 12-week double -blind treatment phase of the 
AMG  [ADDRESS_32520] Eligibility  Criteria:   Adults with  history of chronic migraine and who 
completed the 12-week double- blind treatment phase  of the parent study .  For a full list of 
eligibility criteria, please refer to Section 4.1.  
[COMPANY_010] Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:   Investigational product (IP) 
(ie, AMG 334 70 mg or 140 mg) will  be dosed QM by [CONTACT_10530].   For subjects participating in 
the CHU substudy, IP is AMG  334 140 mg in either a PFS or prefilled AI/Pen . 
Procedures:   Prior to enrolling in this study, subjects will need to undergo week-[ADDRESS_32521] iogram 
(ECG ) central reader report.  Subject  numbers will be the same as those in the parent study.   
After signing informed  consent, subjects will have monthly in -clinic study visits throughout the 
13-month treatment phase.  During these visits, IP will be administered and study -related 
procedures will be completed.   
All subjects will receive open -label AMG 334 QM SC for 13 months  followed by a 12- week  safety 
follow up visit ([ADDRESS_32522] dose of IP).  
Subjects will use an electronic diary (eDiary) every day between the Day [ADDRESS_32523] of study  procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to 
Section  7 and the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  1).   
Statistical Considerati ons:   
For the purpose of primary analysis for secondary and exploratory endpoints in the 20130255 
OLE study, baseline is defined as baseline of the AMG 334 20120295 parent study (from the first day subject used eDiary in baseline at week - 4 study visit th rough the day prior to study day 1).   
However, change from parent study Month [ADDRESS_32524] will be 
provided.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.[ADDRESS_32542] two of the following pain characteristics:  
unilateral, pulsating, moderate or  severe intensity, or aggravated by [CONTACT_33233].  In addition, the migraine attacks are often accompanied by [CONTACT_33234], vomiting, 
and sensitivity to light (photophobia) and sound (phonophobia).  The pathophysiology of 
aura may differ from that of migraine pain (Eikermann-Haerter and Ayata, 2010).  Migraine is a highly prevalent disease worldwide.  The prevalence of migraine is  
approximately 11.7% in the [LOCATION_003], 14.6% in Canada, and 14.7% in Europe 
(Lipton et al, 2007; Stovner and Andree, 2010).   The disease is more common in women 
than in men and presents most often during the period of an individual’s peak economic 
productivity between the ages of 30 and 50 years  of age (Lipton et al, 2007; 
Stovner et al, 2007; Stovner and Andree, 2010).  Depending on the headache 
frequency, migraine is divided into two broad forms:  epi[INVESTIGATOR_33170] [ICHD-3 ].  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_33171]

headache days per month (where at least 8 of those days are migraine days) .  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_33172], 
which include the headache pain features and associated symptoms.  However, there 
are also differences between patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_33173], r isk factors and co-morbidities.  In general, patients with 
chronic  migraine experience more severe and disabling migraine attacks , and have 
more co-morbidities (eg, depression and anxiety, chronic pain and cardiovascular disorders ) than patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730].  Individuals with chronic migraine are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_33174], have lower  levels of overall education, lower household incomes and are 
less likely to be working full time than individuals diagnosed with epi[INVESTIGATOR_33175] (Diener et al, 2012; Katsarava et al, 2012).

Date:  [ADDRESS_32543] frequently used acute 
migraine medications include analgesics and a class of drugs called triptans ( Houston 
and Vanhoutte, 1986; Humphrey et al, 1990).  I t has been demonstrated the triptans are 
effective in both epi[INVESTIGATOR_33176], although those with chronic migraine  
tend to have less robust response to tr iptans than those with epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] (Lipton 
and Chu, 2009).  Based on published treatment guidelines , up to 40% of the migraine 
patient population (including all patients with chronic migr aine) would benefit from 
preventive therapy ( Lipton et al, 2001).  The available migraine preventive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33177].  Migraine 
prophylaxis is an area of large unmet medical need.  While recommendations exist for 
the preventive treatment of migraine headache in the U.S. and Europe, most of the medications were evaluated in epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] (Silberstein et al, 2012; Evers et al, 
2009).  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_33178]-controlled trials

somnolence, language difficulties, and difficulties with memory and concentration 
(Adelman et al, 2008; Brandes et al, 2004).   Additionally, onabotulinumtoxinA was 
recently approved by U nited States  Food and D rug Admi nistration (FDA), several  EU 
countries , and Canada for prophylaxis of chronic migraine, based on 2 randomized, 
placebo-controlled, double-blind studies (Aurora et al, 2010; Diener et al, 2010).     
Calcitonin Gene-related Peptide (CGRP)  
Migraine was historically considered to be due to vasodilatation of cranial blood vessels.  More recent understanding of the pathophysiology of migraine indicates that the vasodilatation of the cranial blood vessels is secondary to activation of the trigeminal 
nociceptive pathway ( Goadsby [CONTACT_2297], 2002).  CGRP is a 37 amino acid peptide 
expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems including the trigeminal 
ganglion and nucleus, and is believed to be a key mediator of migraine based on several lines of evidence.  CGRP was elevated in jugular venous blood  in migraine attacks  
(Goadsby [CONTACT_2297], 1990) and was also elevated interictal ly in migraine patients ( Ashina et 
al, 2000), and trials with antagonists to the CGRP receptor demonstrated efficacy in acute migraine with aura and migraine without aura (Connor et al 2009; Ho et al , 2008 ; 
Ho et al, 2010; Olesen et al, 2004).  It is expected that mechanistically antagonism of the

2.2 AMG 334 Background 
AMG 334 is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin (IgG2) against the CGRP receptor.  
AMG 334 binds to the CGRP receptor complex with high affinity (K d of 20 pM) and 
competitively and reversibly blocks the binding of the native ligand, CGRP.  AMG [ADDRESS_32545].   
The potential mechanisms of action of CGRP receptor antagonists involve components of the trigeminal -vascular system and include normalization of CGRP -induced 
vasodilation, reduction of C GRP -induced neurogenic inflammation, and inhibition of pain 
transmission at the trigeminal ganglion and trigeminal nucleus (Durham, 2004; Poyner, 1992; Wang et al, 1995; Zimmermann et al, 1996 ).  The site of action for AMG 334 will 
be predominantly restricted to the periphery due to AMG 334’s physical size and 
structure (antibody).  While it is not definitively  known whether the CGRP receptors that 
are relevant for migraine lie within or outside of the blood brain barrier, t he following 
scientific evidence argues strongly for a predominant role for peripheral CGRP in the generation of migraine: 
1) CGRP -induced migraine headaches via intravenous (IV) infusion are most 
likely initiated through peripheral CGRP receptor signaling systems . 
a. Migraine can be initiated by [CONTACT_33235] ( Lassen et al , 2002). 
b. CGRP is a 37-amino acid peptide (molecular weight [MWt ] 
>3700 daltons).  It most likely has limited brain penetration across the 
blood brain barrier  (MWt cut off for brain penetration is ~ 500 daltons) . 
c. CGRP peptide has a short plasma half -life [mean plasma 
T
½~11 min in man ( Kraenzlin et al , 1985)] .   
2) The physical and chemical properties of the CGRP -receptor antagonists 
olcegepant and telcagepant suggest that their site of action is likely to be in 
the periphery . 
a. Olcegepant is a peptidic IV CGRP-receptor antagonist that has a 
molecular weight (MWt 870 daltons)   that is greater than the upper 
limit for blood brain barrier penetration with low oral bioavailabili ty 
(Rudolf et al , 2005).  
b. A positron emission tomography (PET) study showed minimal  brain 
penetration of telcagepant and low central receptor occupancy (4-10%) at the clinically efficacious dose of 140 mg (Connor et al, 
2009; Ho et al, 2010; Hostetler et al, 2013 ).  This degree of receptor 
occupancy would be unlikely to produce a functional effect.

Date:  [ADDRESS_32546] was saturated at a lower dose of 150 mg, which has

The preclinical toxicology data were generated in cynomolgus monkey as it is  the only 
laboratory species in which AMG  [ADDRESS_32548] level (NOAEL) was the maximum  dose 
evaluated in the 6-month Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology study, 
150 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC).  There were no significant effects on electrocardiogram

In preliminary  PK results from healthy subjects in the multiple -dose study, t he observed 
mean area under the curve ( AUC) 0-28d accumulation ratio at all 3 dose levels  (21, 70, and

frequency and half-life of monoclonal antibodies .

CONFIDEN TIAL    2.3 Rationale 
Migraine prophylaxis  in chronic migraine is an area of large unmet medical need, with 
existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33183].  While a variety of medications 
are used off -label for prophylaxis of chronic migraine, only onabotulinumtoxinA  is 
approved for this indication.  CGRP receptor antagonism represents a novel approach to 
migraine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Results from the AMG 334 p hase 2 study (Study 20120178) in 
subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_33184] 70 mg dose resulted in 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in monthly migraine days at 
week 12 compared with placebo (70 mg: -3.40 vs Placebo: -2.28; Difference: -1.12; 
p = 0.02).  Neither the 7 mg nor the 21 mg dose was associated with statistically 
significant reductions in monthly migraine days.  The 70 mg dose produced statistically 
significant improvements in multiple secondary and exploratory outcome measures, including the 50% responder rate, monthly headache days, and monthly migraine-specific medication treatment days, while neither the [ADDRESS_32551] dose that results in efficacious 
concentrations  (Lenz  et al, 2015; Sun et al, 2015 ).  This study is designed to assess 
whether a CGRP receptor antagonist is  safe and well tolerated in subjects with chronic 
migraine.   
Rationale for AMG  [ADDRESS_32552] been generally well tolerated in 
phase 1 studies and that this dose is predicted to  result in near complete inhibition of the 
peripheral CGRP receptor for a month.  To ensure optimal efficacy is achieved with 
AMG 334, a higher dose, 140 mg, is currently being evaluated in the double-blind 
placebo-controlled parent study in chronic migraine (Study 20120295) as well as in a phase 3 study in Epi[INVESTIGATOR_33185] (Study 20120296) and efficacy data are being 
collected.  Based on the AMG [ADDRESS_32553] level from preclinical toxicology studies was determined 
to be the high dose, 150 mg/kg SC twice weekly, corresponding to a maximum 
concentration (C
max) of 2620 μg/mL, and AUC 0-7d of [ZIP_CODE] μg•day/mL.  This is 275-fold 
and 296-fold higher than the observed mean C max and AUC 0-28d,  in humans after the third  
 
  Product:  AMG 334  
Protocol Number:  201 [ZIP_CODE]  
Date:  [ADDRESS_32554] monthly subcutaneous  
administration in humans of 140 mg, after  corre cting the different dosing frequency in 
cynomolgus monkeys and humans . 
Based on the clinical data generated to date, it is expected that multiple doses of 
AMG 334 up to 140 mg will be well tolerated in subjects with migraine.  AMG 334 has 
been administered at single doses up to 210 mg SC and 140 mg IV and at doses up to 
140 mg SC administered monthly for 3 months  in migraine subjects, and in healthy 
subjects at doses of 280 mg SC administered on day 1 followed by 210 mg SC administered on days 29 and 57.  R efer to the AMG 334 Investigator’s Brochure for 
details.   
The ability of AMG 334 to inhibit CGRP receptor s in humans was evaluated by [CONTACT_33236][INVESTIGATOR_33186].  This capsaicin- induced 
DBF model has been used to demonstrate proof of pharmacological activity for CGRP antagonists (eg, telcagepant, olcegepant)  (Sinclair et al, 2010).  Based on the results of 
the study with AMG 334, a dose of 70 mg is predicted to result in near complete 
inhibition of the peripheral CGRP receptor for a month.  The plasma concentration 
achieved at 70 mg i s approximately 10 fold higher than the 90% effective concentration 
(EC
90) from the DBF model and is sustained for greater than 28 days ( Figure 1 ).  The 
correlation between the DBF model and clinical efficacy in migraine prophylaxis has not been established with AMG 334 although clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in 
acute migraine treatment for telcagepant (a small molecule CGRP antagonist) at doses with concentrations approximately 2 - 4 fold higher than EC
90 from the DBF model 
studies ( Connor et al, 2009; Ho et al, 2008; Sinclair et al, 2010).

2.4 Clinical Hypotheses 
The clinical hypothesis is that long-term exposure of AMG 334 will be safe and well 
tolerated in subjects with chronic migraine.   In the CHU substudy, it is hypothesized that 
users will be able to administer a full dose of AMG  334 comparably using either the PFS 
or prefilled AI/pen.  No formal hypotheses will be tested.

7.3 Antibody Testing Procedures 
Blood sample(s) for antibody testing are to be collected at timepoints outlined in the 
Schedule of Assessments for the measurement of anti -AMG 334  binding antibodies.  
Samples testing positive for binding antibodies will also be tested for neutralizing 
antibodies and may be further characterized for quantity/titer, isotype, affinity and presence of imm une complexes.  Additional blood samples may be obtained to rule out 
anti-AMG [ADDRESS_32610] at the 
final scheduled study visit will be asked to return for additional follow -up testing.  This 
testing is to occur approximately every 3 months starting from when the site has been 
notified of the positive result, until:  (1)  neutralizing antibodies are no longer detectable 
or (2) the subject has been followed for  a period of at least 1 year (±  4 weeks)  post 
administration of investigational product.  All follow -up results, both positive and negative 
will be communicated to the sites.  More frequent testing (eg, every month) or testing for 
a longer period of time may be requested in the event of safety -related concerns.  
Follow -up testing is not required where it is established that the subject did not receive 
AMG 334. 
Subjects who test positive for binding, non-neutralizing antibodies and have clinical 
sequelae that are considered potentially related to an anti -AMG 334  antibody response 
may also be asked to return for additional follow -up testing.   
7.4 Biomarker Development  
Blood samples are to be collected for biomarker development, and samples collected for 
other testing could be utilized for biomarker development.  Biomarkers are objectively 
measured and evaluated indicators of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.  Biomarker development can 
be useful in identify ing disease subtypes, guiding  therapy, and/or predicting  disease 
severity.

respond positively or negatively to AMG 334.    
7.5 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1 ) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests outlined in  the protocol and for any tests necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes tes ting to ensure analytical methods 
produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the study.  This can also 
include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ensure confidentiality.   
If informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_423], [COMPANY_010] can do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand 
migraine, the dose response and/or prediction of response to AMG 334, characterize 
antibody response, and characterize aspects of the molecule (eg, mechanism of 
action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be documented and 
maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  Samples can be 
retained for up to [ADDRESS_32612]’s medical record and are not to be 
made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other third parties , except as specified in the informed consent.  
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by [CONTACT_21947] .  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed.  
Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are completed.  
However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be 
retained by [CONTACT_11337].

Subjects  can decline to continue receiving investigational product and/or other 
protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33204].  If this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the subject the 
appropriate processes for discontinuation from investigational product or other 
protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33205]  (Table 1 ) and collection of data, including 
endpoints and adverse events.  The i nvestigator  must document the change to the

CONFIDENTIAL    The definition of adverse events includes  worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre-existing medical condition or underlying disease  
(eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than would be expected, and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome than expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more 
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease)  during the study or 
involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while 
on study , is not considered an adverse event.   
An adverse device effect (ADE) is any adverse event related to the use of a 
medical device.  Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any malfunction of the device, or adverse events resulting from use error or from 
intentional misuse of the device. 
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representati ve requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33206], refer to Section 8.[ADDRESS_32617] 1 of the 
following serious criteria:  
• Fatal 
• Life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Other medically important serious event  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”, if the event necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
If an i nvestigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could

Event Summary), including events that are reported to the Event Adjudication 
Committee for adjudication. 
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms), 
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved) , 
• Severity,  
• Assessment of relatedness to investigational product and/or any study -mandated 
activity or procedure, and 
• Action taken. 
The adverse event grading scale used will be the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE).  The grading scale used in this study is described in 
Appendix  A.  The criteria for grade 4 in the CTCAE grading scale differs from the 
regulatory criteria for serious adverse events.  It is left to the investigator’s judgment to 
report these grade [ADDRESS_32619].  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the 
question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33248]?”   
During the CHU, the i nvestigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly 
related to the IP and/or device.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response

“yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by a study activity /procedure (eg, administration of 
investigational product, device[s]) ?”  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  For example, hematuria caused by [CONTACT_33250].  However , laboratory value changes that 
require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded 
as the adverse event.

After the protocol -required reporting period defined above, the investigator does not 
need to actively monitor subjects for serious adverse events.  However, if the 
investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event after this protocol -required 
reporting period, the investigator will report the event to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  Serious adverse events  reported outside of

Clinical outcome assessments will be determined via diary data. 
• Migraine Day: Any calendar day in which the subject experiences a qualified 
migraine headache (onset, continuation, or recurrence of the migraine headache).  A 
qualified migraine headache is defined either as a migraine without aura or a 
migraine with aura as outlined below:  
1. A migraine without aura, lasting for ≥ 4 continuous hours, and meeting criteria a 
and/or  b: 
a) ≥ 2 of the following pain features:

• Migraine Attack:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_33207] a triptan or ergot-derivative to treat headache or aura.  The 
following rules will be used for distinguishing an attack  of long duration from two 
attack s, or for distinguishing between attack s and relapses:  
a) A migraine attack  which is interrupted by [CONTACT_33222], and then 
recurs within 48 hours after onset of the attack  will be considered as one attack,

10.1.2 Analysis Sets 
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all subjects who were enrolled in the study  and 
received at least one dose of investigational product.   All subjects participating in the 
PRO substudy and have at least one monthly score for the MPFID will be included in the 
PRO analysis set.  All subjects enrolled in the CHU substudy will be included in the CHU 
analysis set.    
10.1.3 Covariates and Subgroups 
Since no formal statistical testing is planned for either safety or efficacy endpoint, no  
covariate analysis will be performed.  
Subgroups: 
• Region (North America vs. o ther) 
• Medication overuse (Yes vs. n o)

All subjects who completed the 12-week double-blind treatment phase of the parent 
study, meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the 20130255 OLE study, and 
consent to receive IP  will be eligible to be enrolled.  Up to 651 subjects may participate 
in the study.     
In the CHU Substudy:  Assuming 5% of subjects per treatment group discontinue IP and 
90% of the remaining subjects respond that they administered a full dose, then the anticipated distribution of responses per treatment group at a planned visit would be

CONFIDENTIAL    5% categorized as not attempting due to discontinuing IP, 85.5% responding that they 
administered a full dose, and 9.5% responding that they did not administer a full dose.  
The associated 95% confidence interval halfwidths with 40 subjects per group are 
6.8%, 10.9%, and 9.1%, respectively.  The anticipated 95% confidence interval halfwidth 
for the difference between treatment groups in the proportion of subjects administering a 
full dose is 15.4%.  The discontinuation rate is expected to be less than 5% and the rate 
of administering a full dose is expected to be greater than 90%, and therefore these 
calculations are anticipated to be lower bounds.  Calculations were performed using

10.3.1 Interim Analyses  
On an annual basis or until an administrative decision is made to close the study, 
descriptive statistics of safety and efficacy will be produced for use in the annual report and/or to support publications, if warranted. 
An analysis of the data collected as part of the CHU substudy will be performed once the

over time by [CONTACT_1570]. 
The ECG measurements from this clinical study will be performed as per standard of 
care for routine safety monitoring, rather than for purposes of assessment of potential 
QTc effect.  Since these evaluations may not necessarily be performed under the 
rigorous conditions expected to lead to meaningful evaluation of QTc data, summaries 
and statistical analyses of ECG measurements are not planned, and these data would not be expected to be useful for meta-analysis with data from other studies. 
The incidence and percentage of subjects who develop anti -AMG 334 antibodies 
(binding and if positive, neutralizing) at any time will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570]. The analysis of s ubject- reported outcome of attempted full -dose administration at each 
of day [ADDRESS_32634] report of full dose administration will be considered a “yes” response, and a 
subject report of partial or no dose administered will be considered a “no” response.  The 
proportion of each possible pattern of responses across the two visits will also be estimated.  Ninety -five percent confidence intervals will be provided for each group and 
the difference in proportions between the groups.

The [COMPANY_010] representative(s) and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for 
contact[CONTACT_21974], 
upon request, inspecting the various records of the clinical study (eg, CRFs and other 
pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected. 
The [COMPANY_010] clinical m onitor is responsible for verifying the CRFs at regular intervals 
throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and 
consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research.  The c linical mo nitor is to have access to subject medical records and other 
study -related records needed to verify the entries on the CRFs. 
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the clinical monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing CRFs, are resolved. 
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected 
for audit by [CONTACT_21975]’s Global Compliance Auditing function (or 
designees).  Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, protocol -required therapy storage 
areas, laboratories) and review of study -related records will occur to evaluate the study 
conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
All paper CRFs  are to be typed or filled out with a black ballpoint pen and must be 
legible.  
• Corrections to paper forms are to be made by a single line stroke through the error

CONFIDENTIAL    • Corrections to electronic forms are automatically documented through the software’s 
“audit trail”.  
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review is performed on subject data received at [COMPANY_010].  During this 
review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies.  In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review 
process, data queries and/or site notifications are sent to the site for completion and 
returned to [COMPANY_010].

Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  
• All source documentation supporting entries into the CRFs must be maintained and 
readily available. 
• Updates to CRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s “audit trail”. 
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all  subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review is performed on subject data received at [COMPANY_010].  During this 
review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies.  In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review 
process, data queries and/or site notifications are created in the EDC system 
database for site resolution and closed by [CONTACT_33261].

[COMPANY_010] (or designee) will perform Self-Evident Corrections  (SEC) to obvious data errors 
in the clinical trial database.  SECs will be documented in the eCRF instructions 
available in the EDC system .  Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected 
by [CONTACT_11337] (or designee) include deletion of obvious duplicate data (eg, same results 
sent twice with the same date with different visit- week 4 and ET ) and clarifying “other, 
specify” if data are provided (eg, race, physical examination).  Each investigative site will  
be provided a list of the types of corrections applied to study data at the initiation of the trial and at study closeout.

of the Inter national Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE ) 
Recommendations for the Conduct of Reporting, Editing, and Publications of 
Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which states:  
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the version to be published; (4) Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work 
in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work 
are appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors  should meet conditions 1, 2, 3, 
and 4. 
• When a large, multi center group has conducted the work, the group should identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above. 
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the researc h 
group, alone, does not justify authorship. 
• All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who 
qualify should be listed.  
• Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. 
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] for review.  The Clinical Trial 
Agreement among the institution, investigator, and [COMPANY_010] will detail the procedures for,

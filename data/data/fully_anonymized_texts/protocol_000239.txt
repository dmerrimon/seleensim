    Using SMART Design to Improve Symptom Management Strategies Among Cancer Patients  National Cancer Institute Grant # 1 R01 CA193706 Study Protocol and Statistical Plan  May 28, 2020     
   Research Strategy B. Significance 1. Symptoms during Treatment: Solid Tumor Cancer Patients. By 2030, cancer will surpass heart disease as the leading cause of death in the [LOCATION_002], with new cases expected to increase nearly 45% from 1.[ADDRESS_934907] significance to clinical practice, these patients are likely to experience the burden of symptoms resulting from cancer and its treatment,2-4 leading to diminished health related quality of life (HRQOL).5-9 The  adapted Barsevick symptom management model10 (Figure 2) guides this study.  Based on the model, improved symptom management, especially fatigue, is the proposed mechanism for improving HRQOL. Symptoms are defined as patient’s perceptions of abnormal emotional and physical states.11  Primary Outcome: Fatigue is the most prevalent and often distressing symptom related to cancer and its treatment.12 The prevalence of cancer-related fatigue during active treatment ranges from 25% to 99% based on the sample and methods of assessment.[ADDRESS_934908] had cancer.10 Due to the high prevalence of fatigue and this team’s completed work showing efficacy of two interventions for this symptom,5,[ADDRESS_934909] HRQOL outcomes.10,15-20 The biological changes due to chemotherapy and the resulting inflammatory processes may be responsible for the persistence of fatigue, as well as related symptoms.21-23 Physical, emotional and cognitive components of fatigue will be captured in this study.  Secondary Symptom Outcomes:  In a survey of a 1000 cancer patients, the mean number of symptoms reported was eleven.24 Therefore we will evaluate three secondary outcomes: 1) summed severity score across an array of symptoms other than fatigue (to avoid duplication with primary outcome) from the expanded M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)25,26 pain, nausea, disturbed sleep, distress, shortness of breath (dyspnea), difficulty remembering, decreased appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, sadness, vomiting, numbness/tingling, cough, constipation, diarrhea, sore mouth, rash, and hair loss; 2) depressive symptoms; and 3) anxiety. A key symptom example from the MDASI is dyspnea, a multidimensional subjective experience of breathing distress that impairs functional status, and is associated with thoughts about

  disability, lowered hopefulness, and existential problems in individuals with cancer.27,28 In our completed studies with reflexology and meditative practices, there was a significant improvement in self-reported dyspnea.5,29 We will also assess  two symptoms not specifically included in MDASI: depression and anxiety that are common in cancer patients and are a source of high distress and decrease in HRQOL.30,[ADDRESS_934910] is also significant because it meaningfully engages a friend or family member in their patients’ supportive care over time. Many randomized controlled trials (RCT) of symptom management interventions, including complementary therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], consist of an intervention period of several weeks, which does not cover the full duration of cancer treatment. Since symptom management is needed not just for a few weeks, but for the entire cancer treatment and beyond, the engagement of a friend or family caregiver may represent a significant solution to the sustainability of home-based symptom management interventions. In our nearly completed R01 with reflexology for cancer symptom management, we engage friend or family caregivers.[ADDRESS_934911] $306 billion annually.42,43 It is recognized that the support provided by [CONTACT_689119]’s cancer treatment.38,44-46 Caregivers may also be an important influence on patient care options since they are key stakeholders in patients’ symptom management. In this sense, interventions that support the patient may also indirectly support the caregiver.47,[ADDRESS_934912] targets the caregiver along with the patient to engage in the home-based symptom management intervention/s.  Home-based Interventions. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_689098], patients undergoing cancer treatment have limited choices, given their unique vulnerabilities.49 Reduced functional status can lead to difficulties with the use of supportive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_689099] a group format.14 Further, patients with symptoms such as dyspnea are at a higher risk due to weather changes, another factor which reduces function and accessibility to interventions that are provided outside the home.27,37 While home-based interventions during cancer treatment are potentially significant, many do not produce clinically or practically meaningful improvements. For example, while the effects of supervised exercise interventions on the improvement in fatigue are moderate to large (e.g., d=0.75-0.8750 and d=0.95-1.00), 50-[ADDRESS_934913] sizes (see preliminary work).5,[ADDRESS_934914] controls is individualization and sequencing of interventions using the SMART design.60,61 The two interventions considered in the proposed research use different approaches; one is physical (reflexology) and one psychological (meditative practices). Therefore the success of these interventions may be different for different patients, and there is a need to either lengthen the time with one therapy or test the effects of adding a different therapy when one does not produce the desired outcomes in a given period of time. The SMART design provides a rigorous framework for such testing because of the strength of conclusions that will be derived from randomized comparisons.  3. Interventions: Two Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. An increasing number of cancer patients turn to CAM therapi[INVESTIGATOR_689100].62 Our team’s program of research focuses on building the evidence base for CAM that may enhance symptom management among cancer patients, in order to determine which therapi[INVESTIGATOR_689101], and which elicit comfort or placebo effects but do not add to the pool of effective symptom management interventions.63 The widespread use of complementary therapi[INVESTIGATOR_689102] a significant increase (p≤.001) over a 7-year time span for common chronic conditions.64 The National Health Interview Survey reported that 38% of Americans use some type of complementary therapy.[ADDRESS_934915] selections and sequences of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_689103].   The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)72 identified five categories of complementary therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]:  mind-body; body-based; biologically based; energy therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and alternative medical systems. We have selected a body-based therapy and a mind-body therapy because these two therapy groups are the most widely used by [CONTACT_76428],[ADDRESS_934916] of reflexology on symptom management is burgeoning.5 Our team’s completed R01 (5R01CA104883-5) demonstrated a significant decrease in fatigue when foot therapy was provided by a lay caregiver.[ADDRESS_934917] cancer patients (n=60),84 and a fifth study involved a mixed sample of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519561] (n=42) where a partner provided one session, resulting in an immediate decrease in pain intensity and anxiety.[ADDRESS_934918] with reflexology (n=[ADDRESS_934919] cancer patients), and demonstrated a significant improvement in physical functioning and dyspnea following [ADDRESS_934920] of reflexology and the preliminary results from our nearly completed trial (1R01CA157459-01), where reflexology is delivered by a friend or family caregiver, are presented under justification and feasibility.   Reflexology is a significant body-based intervention selection because it: 1) is non-invasive; 2) extremely low risk; 3) does not interfere with cancer treatment the patient is receiving;5  4) can easily be taught in the home to a friend or family caregiver;33 and 5) based on a national survey, patients are highly likely to use it.85  Meditative Practices. Meditative practices are purposeful strategies aimed towards building capacities to attend to the present moment, including one's thoughts, emotions, bodily sensations, and the environment with nonjudgmental openness and acceptance.86 This therapy selection is grounded in evidence that meditation training with gentle yoga and breathing exercises enhance patients’ ability to adapt to serious medical concerns.87-[ADDRESS_934921] designs.100-104 Studies in cancer report that training in meditative practices resulted in significant improvements in mood,105,106 anxiety 31,75,97,101,105,107, depression,31,75,101,108  fatigue,36,102,105 HRQOL,75,98,101 stress,97,101,108,109 copi[INVESTIGATOR_007],97,109,110 and sleep quality.96,99,104 In two RCTs, engagement in meditative practices reduced perceived stress,103 and psychological distress,75,105 demonstrating efficacy in modulating emotional symptoms.  Meditative practices are a significant mind-body intervention selection because they: 1) have been tested with solid tumor cancer patients;97-99,101,104,110 2) are a highly-utilized supportive therapy with vulnerable cancer patients;75,93 3) have been shown to promote adjustment, reduce psychological distress, and improve HRQOL in cancer patients;94,109 4) are economically delivered and feasible for patients to use on their own at home;94 and 5) are a non-toxic option for symptom management during active treatment.  
  Rationale for sequencing of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (reflexology and meditative practices). While there are likely several physiological mechanisms involved that contribute to the positive outcomes from reflexology and meditative practices, the benefits derived from reflexology, a direct body manipulation are primarily physically mediated; whereas, the effects derived from training in meditative practices are cognitively-mediated.[ADDRESS_934922] one therapy, and if it is inadequate, we will either: 1) add the alternative therapy -- recognizing that an alternate therapy may evoke benefits by [CONTACT_689120], or 2) provide a longer duration of the first therapy. Because of these potential systemic effects, the benefits of reflexology and meditative practices are not limited to immediate results and may be cumulative over time. Therefore extending duration of a single therapy is one possibility to achieve desired symptom reduction. On the other hand, the use of two therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], that evoke the relaxation response via different pathways to gain similar symptom management, may optimize the potential for therapeutic benefits. Some people may prefer or respond better to a cognitive therapy over direct physical contact, while others may favor body-based reflexology, and the optimal intervention choice and sequencing may depend on such individual differences. The SMART design allows for rigorously testing and tailoring intervention sequences to patients. 4. SMART Design. Existing static symptom management interventions deliver a predetermined dose at specific intervals. These interventions are tested in standard RCTs against controls, and this has already been done for reflexology and meditative practices. Dynamic tailoring of interventions to patient responses is needed to enhance the science of symptom management.113,[ADDRESS_934923] to start with reflexology or with meditative practices and then add the second therapy, and the proposed research will assess which patient and caregiver characteristics are important in making this decision for future work. While SMART designs do not typi[INVESTIGATOR_84688] a control group (since first and second stage interventions have been pre-tested in standard RCTs), we included one to help gauge the clinical significance of improvements in symptoms from sequences of interventions that originate from the first randomization. The evidence obtained in the analysis of the intervention sequences will guide refined algorithms for allocating intervention resources in a way that leads to the best possible patient outcomes.   
  C. Innovation The key innovations that maximize the potential of the intervention sequences to improve symptom outcomes are: 1. Involvement of a friend or family caregiver in delivery of a multistage home-based intervention for symptom management over time.  Family involvement has been a missing link in sustaining home-based symptom management.  Many interventions require delivery by a provider outside of the home and can be expensive. This research creatively utilizes a multistage intervention that builds on evidence established in our work that friend or family caregivers can successfully learn to deliver reflexology and can also participate and/or support patients with their meditative practices over time in nonclinical environments such as the patient’s home.  2. Rigorous investigation of combinations and sequencing of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Past research on complementary interventions often bundled several therapi[INVESTIGATOR_689104], and the resulting outcomes could not be attributed to specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].74,115-[ADDRESS_934924] of intensifying an intervention with a second therapy versus giving a single therapy more time (higher dose) can be isolated.  3. Dynamic delivery model and cutting-edge statistical methods. The innovative SMART design allows us to investigate the sequencing of interventions based on their success with individual patients. Designs similar to SMART have begun to be implemented in chronic conditions119-[ADDRESS_934925] cancer, no adverse events were reported, and > 89% of women in the reflexology group completed three or four sessions of the four session protocol. Longitudinal comparisons revealed significant improvements in physical functioning for the reflexology group compared to the control group (p=.04). Dyspnea severity was reduced compared with the control (p < .01) and lay foot manipulation (LFM) groups (p = .02). The effects sizes for the improvements in dyspnea and physical function in the reflexology group compared to controls and LFM were medium to large (between 0.41 and 0.87 for average differences between groups over time). No differences were found for depressive symptoms or state anxiety. The LFM  group had a significant improvement in fatigue compared to controls (p=.01).5  1c. Preliminary Work with Reflexology and Caregivers. In the principal investigators’ (PIs) ongoing R01, both patients and their friend or family caregivers are enrolled as dyads in a reflexology study for symptom support and reduction of unscheduled health services used.[ADDRESS_934926] been successful in maintaining scheduled dyad enrollment (N=240 consented and 190 randomized after completing baseline interview as of February, 2015). Friend and family caregivers have been able to achieve protocol proficiency at 90% immediately after training and at the follow-up quality assurance check a week later.132  After caregiver training, the rate of protocol completion is high for more than one session per week (69%, 89%, 82%, and 83% by [CONTACT_5875]). Virtually all dyads that completed at least one session actually did [ADDRESS_934927] of caregivers in delivering reflexology sessions to patients. Outcomes are measured at baseline, week 5 (post 4-week intervention) and at [ADDRESS_934928] sizes (Cohen’s d) for average group differences over time expressed in standard deviation units. The results from N=140 dyads who completed the 5 and/or 11 week interview to date are summarized in Table 1. P-values <.05 and clinically significant effects sizes >0.33 are bolded. The significant improvements due to caregiver-delivered reflexology are seen in severity of fatigue, pain, and summed symptom severity and interference (MDASI).   1d. Preliminary work with meditative practices. To develop our meditative practices intervention, we first conducted focus groups with cancer patients who had undergone radiation (RT) and chemotherapy.14  Table 1. Preliminary Work: Reflexology and Caregivers  Caregiver-delivered reflexology LS Mean (SE) N=72 Attention control  LS Mean (SE) N=[ADDRESS_934929] size Fatigue severity  3.64 (0.23) 4.32 (0.23) .04 .46 Insomnia severity 2.95 (0.26) 3.57 (0.27) .10 .31 Pain severity 2.25 (0.23) 3.21 (0.24) <.01 .49 MDASI total symptom severity 25.07 (1.59) 30.63 (1.63) .02 .48 MDASI total symptom interference 12.15 (1.15) 16.08 (1.17) .02 .48 
Table 2. Preliminary work with Meditative Practices  
  Based on the findings from these focus groups, we developed a shortened home-based intervention responsive to the needs of vulnerable cancer patients who are in treatment. The adapted meditative practices protocol was tested with 40 patients with lung cancer [mean age: 66.2+9.4 years; sex: 27(67.5%) females, 13(32.5%) males; disease stage: III, 10(25%); IV, 30(75%)] receiving radiation and/or chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive weekly meditative practice sessions (N=20) or an attention control condition (N=20). Outcomes were measured at baseline, post intervention and at [ADDRESS_934930] squares (LS) means, their standard errors (SE), p-values and adjusted effect sizes for group comparisons. Due to relatively small sample size, statistical significance was not reached for all outcomes; however the effect sizes indicate clinically significant improvements and the magnitude of the effect sizes is similar to those seen in Table [ADDRESS_934931].

Rebecca Lehto is an assistant professor and expert oncology clinician who investigates meditative practices in cancer patients to facilitate improvement of cognitively-mediated symptoms. Our team consultants are: Elizabeth Marazita, a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and reflexology expert; and Denise Kozikowski, PhD who is a psychologist and certified expert in meditative practices.  Other Personnel. Recruiters will be located at each site. Interviewers will contact [CONTACT_689121] 12 from the main research office. Intervention experts will train and QA the study reflexologists and meditative practices teachers; study reflexologists will train caregivers in reflexology and meditative practices teachers will train caregivers in meditative practices. The Education Coordinator (EC) will schedule and coordinate all training, and make weekly calls to caregivers. 3. Setting. We will begin with 3-[ADDRESS_934933], and open additional sites if needed to maintain enrollment. All dyad therapy sessions will be done in the home.

  4. Sample. Patients will be approached at the participating oncology clinics. Inclusion criteria are: 1) age 21 or older; 2) solid tumor cancer diagnosis; 3) able to perform basic activities of daily living; 4) undergoing chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or targeted therapy; 5) reporting severity of >3 on fatigue using a 0-10 standardized scale at intake; 6) able to speak and understand English; 7) have telephone access; and 8) able to hear normal conversation. Exclusion criteria are: 1) diagnosis of major mental illness in medical record and verified by [CONTACT_158592]; 2) nursing home resident; 3) bedridden; 4) currently involved with reflexology or meditative practices; or 5) deep vein thrombosis or painful foot neuropathy.  Solid tumors have been selected because fatigue can be effectively managed with the two interventions based on existing evidence, and this symptom is prevalent during cancer treatment.5,143,144 The cut-off of >[ADDRESS_934934] work for balancing sensitivity and specificity in the prediction of the need for symptom management in the future 8 weeks.146  Friends/family caregivers will participate with each patient and will complete a consent form. Their inclusion criteria are: 1) age 18 or older; 2) able to speak and understand English; 3) access to a telephone; 4) able to hear normal conversation; 5) cognitively oriented to time, place and person (determined via recruiter); and 6) willing to be trained in reflexology and meditative practices.  4a. Sample size. To determine the sample size for this study, we started at the right end of the schematic in Figure 1 (the second randomization) and moved from right to left to determine the needed number of consenting patients. To power the comparisons for the value added by [CONTACT_689122], we used the effect size of 0.45, the smaller of the two effects sizes for fatigue from Tables [ADDRESS_934935] size for the longitudinal analysis of 4 time points is 0.54, which results in the sample size requirement of N=55 per group being compared (far right of Figure 1), for power of .80 or greater in two-tailed tests at 0.05 level of significance.  These 55 patients from 4 groups (220 total) created by [CONTACT_689123]-responders from the first intervention stage. Assuming that these 220 are 80% of the total number of patients in the first stage (i.e., that there is a 20% response rate to fatigue during the first 4 weeks), we will need [ADDRESS_934936]-attrition sample size is N=331. To account for 23% attrition seen in past work5,[ADDRESS_934937] 430 patients consent. 4b. Strategies to minimize sample attrition. 1) Recruiters will emphasize the importance of participating in the full intervention and the weekly calls; 2) patients will be asked to mark their home calendar for intervention days and study calls; and 3) weekly calls to patients maintain contact [CONTACT_689124]. These strategies have worked well in our completed and ongoing trials.  
  Participants will be assured of the confidentiality of all information and that refusing to participate will not alter their care. Patients will continue to receive standard medical care, so if any healthcare problems arise, they may seek care from their health providers. For patients who refuse, the recruiter will seek consent to review their record for demographics and ask the reason for refusal. These data help us understand who declines and contribute to external validity and generalizability of the findings. 5. Recruitment. Our team has an existing relationship with [ADDRESS_934938]-attrition sample size of 331. In our recently completed reflexology R01 (N=[ADDRESS_934939] cancer patients), we were able to remain within 10% of recruitment goals for the four years of enrollment and had a consent rate of 74%. In our current R01 with both cancer patients and their caregivers (planned N=200 patients; [ADDRESS_934940]-attrition), we are having similar enrollment rates during year four. As of February 2015, N=[ADDRESS_934941] recent reflexology trial, 14% of patients and 13% of caregivers were African American, and 4% were Hispanic.[ADDRESS_934942] care at the sites. They will approach patients during clinic visits and explain the study. Patients can choose to consent at that time if their caregiver is present, or take the packet home to discuss with their caregiver. Recruiters will follow up during a clinic visit or by [CONTACT_689125], answer questions, and discuss the study with caregivers. If verbal consent is obtained over the phone for either the patient or caregiver, the consent forms in the packet can be signed and returned in the stamped envelope. If the consent forms are not returned within one week, the recruiter will call as a reminder to mail the consent forms if they wish to participate.  5b. Recruiter training includes didactic information, role-playing, problem cases and return-demonstration conducted by [CONTACT_689126]. Recruiters will use a script to introduce the study to patients including: 1) initial randomization to reflexology, meditative practices for symptom management or a usual care control group, and the possibility of the two active groups being re-randomized after [ADDRESS_934943] therapy to either continue the same therapy or to also add the other therapy; 2) weekly intervention sessions provided by [CONTACT_689127] (following training by a reflexologist and/or a meditative practices teacher) in their home; 3) there is no cost; 4) the complete study lasts 12 weeks to include all data collection (i.e., weekly calls and two 30-45 minute phone interviews); 5) both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_689106]; and 6) a review of potential risks/benefits. 6. Randomization. Following the baseline interview, patients will be randomized to reflexology, meditative practices or standard care control. Randomization will be completed using a computer minimization algorithm programmed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Sikorskii that balances arms by [CONTACT_689128], site of cancer, stage of cancer (early versus late) type of treatment (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or targeted therapy, and their combinations), patient sex and relationship to the caregiver (spouse vs non-spouse).[ADDRESS_934944], with the same balancing factors, except that randomization will allocate patients into 2 groups: continuing the same therapy or adding the other one. 
  7. Intervention Components 7a. Active Group Caregiver Intervention Procedures. Caregivers will: 1) be trained by a study reflexologist or meditation teacher in the therapy their patient is initially randomized to; 2) after 4 weeks of delivering the therapy, caregivers will be trained in the second therapy if their patient is re-randomized to receive the other therapy; 3) receive weekly calls over [ADDRESS_934945] one weekly session is required per protocol. The number of additional sessions per week is not restricted in a home-based intervention, and the number of sessions delivered is tracked weekly (see 7d, Protocol Fidelity).  7b. Intervention Protocols. As recommended by [CONTACT_689129], complementary therapy investigators should partner with therapy experts, while acknowledging that the investigator role requires very different preparation than that of the practitioner.[ADDRESS_934946]. Lehto and our training meditation teacher (see experts & trainers letters of support). The consultants and trainer for each therapy will have no direct contact [CONTACT_20688]; this further assures protection against contamination of roles.   7c. Common Elements to Study Provider Training. The intervention trainers will train the study providers who will work directly with patients and caregivers. Study provider reflexologists will be practicing reflexologists, who will be trained in the study specific protocol. Study meditation providers will be health professionals, e.g., nurses. Training for both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_689107], written steps of the protocol, role-playing, demonstrations, and return-demonstrations based on our study-specific criteria. All study providers must demonstration protocol proficiency > 90% to begin and continue (QA checks) with participants (proficiency check list in appendix). Both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_689108]. In addition, to enhance the utilization of technology, a DVD demonstrating the instructions will be offered to all dyads.  Each study provider will be in the home approximately 45-[ADDRESS_934947] four weeks will then be evaluated to determine which therapy the dyads will continue with through week 8. Provider Consistency. All study providers will pass a demonstration of > 90% proficiency as judged by 
  [CONTACT_200857]’ score on the checklist for both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_689109]. Caregivers must also achieve 90% accuracy. Delivery Consistency. There will be a QA check and booster session conducted biannually for each study provider (those who teach caregivers one or both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), with a 90% proficiency in delivery of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Caregivers are taught and evaluated during intervention weeks [ADDRESS_934948] number of sessions reported by [CONTACT_689130]. Thus, fidelity of the receipt and enactment of each therapy will be documented weekly over the 8-week intervention period.  7e. Incentives.  All participants will be mailed a thank-you letter and a local complementary therapy directory after the week 12 data collection. Control caregivers will be offered a complimentary training session of their choice (reflexology or meditative practices). This therapy-based incentive has worked well in the past.132,[ADDRESS_934949] data collected twice via telephone interviews: baseline and study week [ADDRESS_934950] published evidence of reliability and validity with samples of cancer patients and caregivers. The interviews will take 30-45 minutes. If a participant becomes fatigued, we will divide the telephone interview into two phone calls within the same week.  8b. Interviewer Training. The interviewers will call both members of the dyad at intake and week 12. Interviewers will be blinded to the dyad’s group assignments. The Education Coordinator will train interviewers via didactic information, written steps, role-playing for difficult interview questions, and return-demonstrations based on our study-specific criteria. In addition, 10% of all interviews will be recorded for QA. 8c. Weekly Calls to Patients. The interviewers will make the weekly calls to all patients to assess symptoms using MDASI (fatigue included) during the 8-week intervention period or an equivalent time frame for the control group. Therefore the attention of asking patients about their symptoms will be equalized across groups. When a symptom is rated at a [ADDRESS_934951] their oncology office.  For patients randomized to reflexology or meditative practices, weeks 1-4 call data will be used to assess response on fatigue (see definition of symptom response below). If response is not achieved; the patient and caregiver will be re-randomized and weekly calls will continue for weeks 5-[ADDRESS_934952] call 7 days ago, as described under Fidelity (section 7b). During weeks 5-8, if re-randomized to add another therapy, the number of sessions will be recorded for the initial and added therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The Education Coordinator will make these calls because interviewers need to be blinded to dyad’s group assignments. 
  9. Measures of Primary Symptom Outcome - Fatigue  9a. Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) 153 (Patients; baseline & week 12). Physical and emotional components of fatigue will be measured with the Brief Fatigue Inventory for rapid assessment of fatigue severity and interference with daily life. The instrument consists of nine items. The first three items ask respondents to rate the severity of fatigue “right now,” at its “usual” level during the past 24 hours and at its “worst” level during the past 24 hours. Answer choices are on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0=no fatigue and 10=as bad as you can imagine. The remaining six items assess how fatigue affected the following during the past 24 hours: general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work (including work outside the home and daily chores), relations with other people, and enjoyment of life. Responses are on a 0 to 10 scale where 0=does not interfere and 10=completely interferes. Alpha coefficients exceeded .95.  9b. Attentional Function Index (AFI) (Patients; baseline & week 12).[ADDRESS_934953] cancer.154,155 In our previous studies with lung cancer, alpha reliabilities were .89 and .91 respectively.156 10. Measures of Secondary Symptom Outcomes.  10a. Symptom Inventory (Patients; baseline & week 12 & weekly calls).157 The expanded M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) evaluates severity of 19 symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_76428] (i.e., fatigue, pain, nausea, disturbed sleep, distress, shortness of breath, difficulty remembering, decreased appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, sadness, vomiting, numbness/tingling, diarrhea, constipation, sore mouth, rash, hair loss, and cough, and the interference of these symptoms with daily life on the scale from 0=symptom not present to 10=worst imaginable. This instrument has established evidence of reliability and validity in samples of cancer patients.[ADDRESS_934954] common symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_689131] 3: Measures Patient Measures Week 1 Week 12 Weekly calls 1.a Primary Outcome    • Physical and Emotional Fatigue (Brief Fatigue Inventory) X X  • Cognitive Fatigue (Attentional Function Index) X X  1.b  Secondary Outcomes    • MDASI minus fatigue to avoid redundancy with BFI X X  • PROMIS Depression & Anxiety SF 4   X X  1.c  Weekly Calls    •   MDASI with fatigue, since no BFI  or AFI in brief weekly calls   X 2.

  treatments.25 A single summed symptom severity score across 18 symptoms (without fatigue, since it is measured in more detail by [CONTACT_689132] 9 above) will be used as a secondary outcome in study Aims 1-4 and in building optimal decision rules in exploratory Aim 5. 10b. & c. Measures of Secondary Outcomes of Depression and Anxiety. PROMIS-short forms 4: depression and anxiety (Patients; baseline and week 12).159-162 These two symptoms are not directly covered by [CONTACT_447162], which includes related items of distress and sadness. Therefore, we include the additional PROMIS measures for these symptoms. PROMIS measures were developed using sophisticated measurement techniques, including Item Response Theory (IRT).159,[ADDRESS_934955] high correlations with IRT-derived scores obtained from extensive item banks. We chose 4-item short forms to minimize respondent burden while maintaining measurement precision. 11. Determination of Response on Fatigue during Weeks 1-4 for the Purpose of Re-randomization (Patient; weekly calls). Fatigue response will be assessed based on the fatigue item from MDASI administered in weekly calls to patients. First, we define symptom onset as the date of the weekly call when a symptom for the first time is reported by [CONTACT_689133]-points.[ADDRESS_934956] increases in symptom interference occur as severity increases between successive integers ranging from 1 to 10. Thus, the cut-points are anchored in symptom interference with patient’s lives. For fatigue, the mild category corresponds to a severity score of 1, moderate category corresponds to scores 2-4, and scores of 5-[ADDRESS_934957] the value added by [CONTACT_689134] 2 and 3.  12. Measures of Dyad Characteristics (Potential Covariates) 12a. Demographics (Dyads; baseline). Demographics include age, education, work, ethnicity, race, religious affiliation, marital status, and relationship between patient and the friend or family caregiver.   12b. Chronic Conditions (Patients; baseline). The Bayliss tool queries the presence of  20 comorbidities.167 12c. Medical Treatment (Patients; eligibility & week 12).  Chart data include radiation, surgery, chemotherapy (dose, type, dates received), co-morbidities, cancer stage, and medications (e.g., supportive agents for pain control, nausea, anxiety, or depressive symptoms) corresponding with the time-on-study. In addition, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) data will be collected on side effects and toxicities including anemia and neutropenia. 
  12d. Complementary Therapy Expectancy Scale (Dyads; baseline).168 This tool has items on logical thinking and feelings related to complementary therapy use.  12e. Complementary Therapy Utilization (Patients; baseline & week 12).169 Assesses the use of 24 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  12f. Caregiver Reaction Assessment Tool (Caregiver; baseline and week 12).170 Caregiver burden will be measured with this tool developed and validated with caregivers of patients with chronic conditions. It has 5 subscales: impact on schedule, caregiver’s esteem, family support, impact on health, and impact on finances. 12g. PROMIS Profile-29 (Caregivers; baseline & week 12).159,171 The PROMIS profile instruments are a collection of profile short forms, containing items from one of seven primary PROMIS domains (depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and satisfaction with participation in social roles). The PROMIS Profile-29 includes four items from each primary domain plus a single pain intensity rating. The instrument was developed for the general population and is particularly suitable for the assessment of caregiver health, including symptoms and functioning. Since interventions will be delivered by [CONTACT_689135], caregiver health may influence the optimal decision rules explored in Aim 5. 12h. Patient Satisfaction with Friend or Family Caregiver Involvement. (Patients; week 12).[ADDRESS_934958] seven days. 13b. Attrition Data will be documented when it occurs in association with data collection interviews, including being unable to reach the patient or the patient stating she/he wishes to discontinue. The date and reason, when possible, will be documented. Interviewers will make three attempts for each call.  13c. Training Forms for proficiency will be completed at each training and refresher. The trainers for the reflexologist and meditative practices providers will use a scored proficiency checklist to test study providers accuracy initially and at QA checks every [ADDRESS_934959] when training caregivers at weeks 1 & 2 and if a second therapy is added at weeks 5 & 6. 14. Analytic Methods Data management, tracking and analyses. All data for patients will be entered into the secure web-based database that will be accessible to recruiters and interveners at multiple recruitment sites. To maintain security, data will be stored within a server different from the server of web application. Periodic quality assurance checks of the data will be performed.  De-identified data will be transferred into SAS 9.[ADDRESS_934960] randomization and the equivalence of subgroups created by [CONTACT_520455], the outcome values at baseline and potential covariates will be compared using t-tests, chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests. The latter variables include recruitment location, age, sex, site and stage of cancer, type of treatment (e.g., chemotherapy and/or radiation, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy), administration of supportive agents, comorbid conditions, relationship to the caregiver, and living arrangements. If systematic differences are discovered, then the appropriate variables will be included as covariates in further analyses. Outliers will be investigated by [CONTACT_520458], and models described below will be fit with and without outliers to examine their influence on the results. Two-sided tests of hypotheses stated below will be performed to determine the superiority of one group versus another as created by [CONTACT_689136]. 14b. Attrition Analyses and Handling of Missing Data. We will compare dyadic characteristics of those who drop out between consent and first randomization to those who continue participation. Following the first randomization, attrition analyses will compare those who drop out according to the second randomization. In addition, we will compare characteristics of those who completed the study with those who did not within their designated group to inform the generalizability of findings. The regression techniques described below allow for missing at random (MAR) mechanisms.177 If patterns of missing data indicate potential not missing at random (NMAR) mechanisms, then models describing missing mechanisms will be considered (e.g., pattern-mixture models).178,179 Since NMAR or MAR assumptions are not directly testable, we will employ sensitivity analyses to investigate the robustness of the results under pattern-mixture or other  models.  Primary Analysis outcomes: severity of fatigue (primary, physical and emotional from BFI, cognitive from AFI), summed severity index of other symptoms (secondary, from MDASI), depression (secondary, from PROMIS), anxiety (secondary, from PROMIS).  Aim 1, part a), relative effectiveness of reflexology and meditative practices. Hypothesis 1. Patients randomized to the reflexology group will report lower severity of fatigue and lower summed severity score from the MD Anderson symptom inventory at weeks 1-4. This hypothesis will be tested using statistical model #1 that relates the outcome y  at weeks 1-4 to the group assignment variable (reflexology, meditative practices or control), outcome at baseline, and other covariates (see baseline comparisons). Additional covariates will include variables used in randomization, due to their potential impact on outcomes. If errors are normally distributed, this model will be fit as a linear mixed effects model (LME), which generalizes classical analysis of repeated measures.  Generalized linear mixed effects (GLME) modeling will be used with the appropriate link function and error distribution (e.g., gamma) if the symptom severity outcome is not normally distributed and cannot be normalized using transformations. We are primarily interested in the additive effect of the group variable, and differences in the least square (LS) means will be tested according to the levels of variable .  Aim 1, part b), characteristics of responders and non-responders. Patients who are responders or non-responders on fatigue will be defined as described in measures. The characteristics of 1x2x
1x
  responders and their caregivers will be compared to those of non-responders using t-tests, chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests.  Aim 2, Hypothesis 2. Patients who do not respond to reflexology on fatigue during weeks 1-4 (1st intervention stage) and have the meditative practices added during weeks 5-8 (2nd intervention stage), will report lower severity of fatigue and improved 3 secondary outcomes: summed severity index of other symptoms, depression and anxiety, as compared to those who are re-randomized to continue with reflexology alone.  The analytic strategy described under the analyses for Aim 1 will be implemented for the comparison of two groups created by [CONTACT_520455]. The repeated severity measures during weeks 5-8 and week 12 will be related to study group (reflexology alone versus reflexology and meditative practices), symptom severity during week 4, and covariates (see preliminary analyses). The test of the significance of the coefficient for the group variable will yield a formal test of Hypothesis [ADDRESS_934961] of Hypothesis 2 for these 2 secondary outcomes will come from the significance of the coefficient for group assignment in the second randomization. Aim 3, Hypothesis 3. Patients who do not respond to meditative practices on fatigue during the weeks 1-4 (1st intervention stage) and have the reflexology added during the 2nd intervention stage (weeks 5-8), will report lower severity of fatigue and improved 3 secondary outcomes: summed severity index of other symptoms, depression and anxiety as compared to those re-randomized to continue with meditative practices alone.  The analysis for this aim is the same as the analysis for Aim 2, but will be performed among those who did not respond to meditative practices during weeks 1-4. Aim 4, Hypothesis 4: Patients randomized to intervention sequences beginning with reflexology or meditative practices will report lower severity of fatigue and improved 3 secondary outcomes: summed severity of other symptoms at weeks 1-8 and week 12, depression and anxiety at week 12 compared to controls. The LME model described under analysis for Aim 1 will be extended to include 8 repeated measures of symptom severity (from weekly calls) and an additional measure from week [ADDRESS_934962] of Hypothesis 4. PROMIS depression and anxiety measures from week 12 interview will be analyzed using generalized linear models with the following explanatory variables: group assignment at first randomization, depression or anxiety (respectively) at baseline, and balancing variables from randomization. Exploratory Analysis: Aim 5.  To explore which dyadic characteristics observed during weeks 1-[ADDRESS_934963]. Two Q-functions will be considered. The function 𝑄!(𝐻!)=𝐸[𝑌!|𝐻!] is the expectation of the second stage outcome	𝑌!  given history after 2 stages, denoted by 𝐻!:	dyadic characteristics, outcomes observed during weeks 1-8 and week 12, and interventions received. The function 𝑄"(𝐻")=𝐸[𝑌"+max𝑄!(𝐻!)] uses history through the first intervention stage 𝐻".The conditional expectations in the Q-functions will be estimated from regression analyses for the outcomes of severity of fatigue, summed severity of other symptoms, depression & anxiety, and the optimal decision rule will be found using backward induction by [CONTACT_689137].183,184  Due to caregiver involvement in intervention delivery, caregiver characteristics including measures of symptoms (described in the measures section) will be explored, as the optimal decision rules may be based on both patient and caregiver factors. The Q-learning method will be implemented in SAS PROC QLEARN129 developed by [CONTACT_689138].[ADDRESS_934964].  15. Potential Difficulties/Limitations and Alternative Approaches Since randomizations may not account for all possible error sources, we will adjust for baseline values of outcomes in the analysis to provide added control over possible confounding pre-intervention influences.  One primary (fatigue), 3 secondary outcomes (summed severity of other symptoms, depression & anxiety) and the hypotheses are all stated a priori. In the exploratory analyses, the issue of multiple testing will be addressed by [CONTACT_689139]-Hochberg or Hochberg adjustment186-[ADDRESS_934965] analysis, report  X  X  X  X 16.

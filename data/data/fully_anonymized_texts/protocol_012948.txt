Version 2.0  
1. Study Aims  
 Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI), defined as both stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and urge urinary 
incontinence (UUI), is a challenging condition and there are limited trials evaluating interventions that can 
optimize treatment outcomes. The overarching goal of this randomized trial is to estimate the effect of 
combined midurethral sling (MUS) and peri -operative behavioral/pelvic floor therapy (BPTx ) compared to 
MUS alone on successful treatment of MUI symptoms in [ADDRESS_482062] of combined treatment compared to MUS on improving OAB and SUI outcomes 
separately, need for additional treatment, time to fail ure and identifying predictors of poor outcomes  in this 
MUI population.  
 
1.1. Primary Aim:  
 To assess whether combined MUS + peri -operative BPTx is superior to MUS alone for improving 
MUI symptoms at 1 year in women electing surgical treatment.  
 
Primary O utcome : Change in s everity of MUI symptoms at 1 year following MUS measured using the 
Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI).2   
 
Primary Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in  the change in  MUI symptoms between women receiving 
combined MUS+BPTx versus MUS alone at 1 year following MUS surgery.  
 
Primary Alternative Hypothesis : Combined MUS+BPTx is superior to MUS alone for improving change in 
MUI symptoms at 1 year following MUS surgery.  
 
1.2. Secondary Aims:  
1. OAB symptom outcomes:  To assess whether combined MUS+BPTx  is superior to MUS alone 
for improving change in OAB symptoms  at 1 year in women electing surgical treatment.  
-OAB symptoms will be measured using UDI -irritative subscale scores  
 Secondary Alternative Hypothesis: Combined MUS+BPTx is superior to MUS alone for improving 
change in OAB symptoms in women with MUI at 1 year following MUS surgery.  
 
2. SUI symptom outcomes:  To assess whether combined MUS+BPTx is superior to MUS alone for 
improving change in SUI symptoms at 1 year in women electing surgical treatment for MUI.  
-SUI symptoms will be measu red using  the UDI -stress subscale.  
 
Secondary Alternative Hypothesis: Combined MUS+BPTx is superior to MUS alone for improving 
change in SUI symptoms in women with MUI at 1 year following MUS surgery.  
 
1.3. Exploratory Aims:  
1. Secondary urinary outcomes:  To assess whether combined MUS+BPTx is superior to MUS 
alone for improving the number of urgency and urge incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_385288] 1 
year following MUS surgery.  
 2. Time to failure:  To compare time to failure between MUS+BPTx versus MUS alone.  
-Failure will be defined as initiation of any additional treatment  for lower urinary tract symptoms (SUI, 
UUI/OAB, or voiding dysfunction) .

Version 2.0  
3. Predictors of poor outcomes:  To develop models to identify predictors of change  of MUI, OAB, 
and SUI outco mes measured using the UDI  between baseline and [ADDRESS_482063]-treatment . 
 
4. Quality of life and global impression:  To compare quality of life outcomes and Patient Global 
Impression- Improvement (PGI -I)3, Patient Global Impression -Severity (PGI -S)3 between groups  
 
5. Safety and additional treatments:  To describe rates of reoperation (sling revision) for worsening 
OAB sym ptoms after MUS and to compare the proportion of women in each group initiating 
additional treatment for SUI and/or OAB, and the types of additional treatment (BPTx, medications, 
other)  
   
6.  Minimally important difference (MID) and clinical definitions:  To determine MIDs and 
clinically meaningful definitions of MUI that predict clinical outcomes using cut -offs and combinations 
of standardized measures  
  
7. Pelvic floor muscle strengthening:   To compare pelvic floor muscle strength changes between 
women r andomized to combined MUS+BPTx versus MUS alone and to estimate associations 
between pelvic floor muscle strength improvement and UI symptoms. We will also explore predictors 
of unsuccessful pelvic floor muscle strengthening.  
 
8. Cost -effectiveness analysi s: To determine the cost effectiveness of combined midurethral sling 
(MUS) and peri -operative behavioral/pelvic floor therapy (BPTx) compared to MUS alone for the  
treatment of MUI symptoms  
2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
2.1. Disease/Condition Background:   
 Up to 50% of women with incontinence have mixed urinary incontinence (MUI); a complex condition 
that is significantly challenging for patients, clinicians and researchers.4-[ADDRESS_482064] treatment 
approaches.  The wide variability of patient symptoms and terminology, ranging from “stress -predominant”, 
“urge- predominant”, “OAB -wet” or “OAB -dry”, further complicates data interpretation and patient 
management. The current definiti ons and treatment approaches have failed to provide significant progress 
in the treatment of this bothersome condition.

Version 2.0 2.2. Challenges with definitions  
 There is significant variability and controversy regarding the “best” definition of MUI: essentially there 
is an absence of a universal definition.10-15  Based on the name [INVESTIGATOR_67866], it makes sense that “MUI” includes 
symptoms of both SUI and UUI/OAB. The International Urogynecological As sociation (IUGA)/International 
Continence Society (ICS) joint terminology report defines OAB based on symptoms alone as “urgency with 
or without urgency incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia”: women can be “OAB -wet” or “OAB -
dry”.  MUI is defined by [CONTACT_385322] “the complaint of involuntary leakage associated with urgency and also with exertion, effort, sneezing, or coughing”.
16 Clinical challenges with this definition include: 1) it 
excludes women w ho may have significant urgency and/or frequency without UUI; 2) it excludes women 
who have detrusor overactivity in the absence of sensory urgency; and 3) many women do not experience 
SUI or UUI based on these clear cut definitions.  Purely “objective” measures such as urodynamic 
evaluation (UDE) also do not provide a clear and consistent definition. Further complicating the issue is the 
lack of consensus and evidence regarding the pathophysiology of MUI. Some experts argue the two 
conditions should be con sidered as having completely different pathological processes,[ADDRESS_482065] in a subset of women, they are directly linked (e.g. proximal urethral funneling causing 
detrusor overactivity).  
 Brubaker et al and the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (UITN) attempted to develop an 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_385289] 2009.[ADDRESS_482066] ress Incontinence Surgical Treatment 
Efficacy Trial ( SISTEr trial ), a randomized trial comparing fascial sling to Burch colposuspension,[ADDRESS_482067] clinical outcomes. Standardized measures included the Medical, 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_117583] (MESA),18 the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI),2 urodynamic 
studies and a 3 -day urinary diary. The investigators created threshold definitions using the MESA (which 
measures the frequency of SUI and/or UUI), the UDI (which measures the presence and degree of bother 
for SUI and UUI), and UDE (defined as presence of urodynamic SUI and detrusor overactivity with or 
without associated leakage). These definitions were evaluated against  the trial’s clinical outcome, a 
composite outcome divided into SUI success (negative cough stress test, no SUI re- treatment, and negative 
MESA SUI) and overall success (stress criteria plus no leakage on diary or pad test). After testing [ADDRESS_482068] 
clinical outcomes and proposed that both subcomponents of SUI and UUI should be individually described 
instead of using a one- dimensional descriptor. One limitation is that the SISTEr trial included only women 
with pure SUI or stress -predominant MUI.   
 In a second attempt, Brubaker et al used data from the UITN Behavior Enhances Drug Reduction of 
Incontinence (BE -DRI) to again explore operational definitions of M UI, using various thresholds and 
combinations of the MESA, UDI and [ADDRESS_482069] the study’s primary outcome (success defined as a 
70% reduction in incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] ). Because of this, the authors again recommended  using distinct 
descriptions of both urgency and stress subcomponents when characterizing subjects with MUI until better 
definitions are developed. One limitation is that the BE -DRI population included primarily women with urge-
predominant MUI.   
2.3. Current treatment strategies for MUI: Challenges and old assumptions  
 Based on expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the primary treatment strategy for MUI typi[INVESTIGATOR_385290]  (SUI vs UUI) .  Although many women may clearly 
have one condition that is more bothersome, many have equally bothersome symptoms, or cannot determine which condition is “most bot hersome”. Behavioral/pelvic floor therapy (BPTx) has been shown to 
be effective for all types of incontinence
20, and some experts suggest that BPTx should be the first 
treatment for MUI, regardless of which symptom is more bothersome because it is minimally invasive. Other authors support the first -line use of anti -muscarinics f or MUI, despi[INVESTIGATOR_385291]    2-12-[ADDRESS_482070],21 side effects are common, and discontinuation is high, ranging from 
43%-83% within the first [ADDRESS_482071], these 
recommendations are based on the following assumptions for MUI:  
 1. OAB and SUI are separate and unrel ated conditions  
 -There is some evidence to suggest that at least in a subset of women, these 2 conditions may be 
related (proximal urethral funneling causing detrusor overactivity)  
 2. Treatment should always be initiated in a stepwise, sequential fashion  
 -There has been little evidence evaluating the potential benefit of combined treatments, and thus the 
old paradigm of following stepwise treatment remains unproven  
 3. Surgical treatment should be reserved for women with SUI -predominant MUI because it w ill 
worsen OAB symptoms  
 -Most studies suggesting worsening of OAB symptoms included traditional bladder neck slings and 
colposuspension and not MUS  
 4. All women would prefer to take long- term medications over undergoing a surgical intervention  
 -Adherence to anticholinergics is poor  
  
Clinically, many women with MUI become dissatisfied with conservative treatment and/or the need to take a 
medication long- term. In practice, there can be much “cross -over” due to patient dissatisfaction when the 
outcomes of  treatment are focused on only one symptom. Many women with “urge- predominant” MUI who 
have tried BPTx and/or anti -muscarinic therapy will go on to choose surgical treatment for SUI after 
becoming dissatisfied with the results. Women with equally bothersom e OAB and SUI components 
commonly choose surgery, with or without a trial of BPTx.  This “traditional” treatment paradigm for MUI has not resulted to significant advances and we are now challenged to consider new paradigms for MUI.   
 
2.4. Behavioral/pelvi c floor muscle therapy (BPTx)  
 BPTx includes components of behavioral therapy, designed to change behaviors to encourage 
continence, and pelvic floor muscle therapy, designed to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, enhance the physiological closure of the bladder neck, and improve coordination. A recent Cochrane review of pelvic 
floor muscle exercise found that these treatments were effective for both SUI and MUI compared to placebo 
or no treatment, but women with pure SUI may have better outcomes.
20 The UITN study BE -DRI by [CONTACT_385323] -muscarinic  therapy with behavioral therapy would increase the 
number of women who could discontinue drug therapy while sustaining a significant reduction in UUI.23 BE-
DRI included women with pure UUI or UUI -predominant MUI. A lthough the addition of behavioral therapy 
did not improve drug therapy discontinuation, the study found that the combination of behavioral training 
and drug therapy yielded improved urinary outcomes compared to drug therapy alone. Specific to the MUI 
population, there is a paucity of literature evaluating whether combined therapi[INVESTIGATOR_385292] (bothersome SUI and bothersome UUI) will improve a 
patient’s outcome and perception of her condition.      
 
2.5. Anti-incontinence s urgical treatment outcomes in women with MUI  
 Although “traditional teaching” is that women with MUI should not undergo anti -incontinence surgery 
for SUI due to potential  risk of worsening OAB, this is not supported by [CONTACT_385324].  
There continues to be accumulating evidence regarding the efficacy of midurethral sling (MUS) for the 
treatment of MUI (See Table 1). The MUS has proven to be highly effective for SUI treatment with cure 
rates up to 80% at 1 yea r24 and there is more recent evidence supporting improved OAB outcomes also.

Version 2.0  A systematic review by [CONTACT_385325] 2011 including six randomized trials and seven prospective 
studies reported that the overall cure r ate of urgency and the UUI component of MUI after MUS was 30-
85% at a follow -up of a few months to 5 years.25  Whether authors consider MUS to be helpf ul or hurtful for 
MUI often depends on the point of view of a paper, and may also be highly dependent on the definitions 
used to define “persistent OAB.”  Some studies report that more than 50% of women with MUI experience 
complete resolution or improvemen t of OAB symptoms after MUS treatment.26 However, other studies 
report that MUI is a risk factor for failure of both SUI and OAB outcomes27 or that MUS may exacerbate 
OAB symptoms. One stud y reported a failure rate of 42% compared to 12% for SUI outcomes in women 
with baseline MUI compared to those with SUI alone.28  Whether there may be specific patient 
characteristics that are associated with resolu tion or exacerbation of OAB symptoms also remains unclear.  
 The Trial of Mid- Urethral Slings (TOMUS) by [CONTACT_385326] 597 women with 
pure SUI or SUI -predominant MUI (based on MESA scores) to retropubic versus transobturator MUS.24  
Success was a composite outcome, defined as: 1) negative CST; 2) negative pad test; 3) no retreatment for 
SUI; 4) no self -reported leakage on 3 -day voiding diary; 4) no self -reported SUI symptoms; 5) no self -
reported retreatment of SUI. At baseline, 70/589 (12%) had detrusor overactivity on UDE, but overall mean 
urge scores on MESA were low (5.9 -6.6 + 4 points). One year postoperatively, 11% had persistent UUI 
(defined as any MESA urge item response of “sometimes” or  “often” or post -operative initiation of anti -
muscarinic treatment for UUI).  The rate of de novo UUI was 1/597 (0.002%). The UDI -irritative subscale 
scores improved from a mean of 41.2 (25.4), to 9.2 (15.2), and 8.9 (15.1) at baseline, 6 and 12 months, 
respectively suggesting improvement in OAB symptoms (unpublished data, personal communication). 
Higher baseline MESA urge scores increased the risk of overall (objective and subjective) sling failure.29 In 
a planned secondary analysis evaluating UDE predictors, detrusor overactivity on preoperative UDE was not a risk factor for objective or subjective failure.
30  
 Barber et al performed a second trial also comparing retropubic versus transobturator MUS for 
SUI.27, 31 Although women with baseline detrusor overactivity were excluded, 71% had baseline UUI based 
on the UUI item on the PFDI -20 questionnaire32.  At 1 year postoperative 31% of women report ed 
bothersome UUI and 4- 10% had new or worsened UUI. 45% of women were failures, defined as a 
composite outcome of “abnormal bladder function” defined as: 1) incontinence symptoms of any type; 2) 
positive CST; 3) retreatment for SUI; 4) postoperative urinary retention.  Overall, 79% reported Patient -
Global Impression of Improvement3 (PGI-I) scores as “much better/very much better”. The 2 UDI -irritative 
items in the UDI -6 (UUI and frequency) improved from a median of 3 points at baseline to 0 points at 12 
months, also suggesting improvement in OAB symptoms (unpubl ished data, personal communication). In a 
secondary analysis, baseline UUI was not a risk factor for recurrent UI 1 year postoperatively, but preoperative use of anti -muscarinic medications was. However, 53% (10/19) of women taking anti-
muscarinics  at baseline  were no longer taking them 1 year postoperatively.  
 A secondary analysis by [CONTACT_385327].33 In the original 
inclusion criteria, only women with a “detrusor instability score” < 7 (suggesting pure SUI) were included. 
However, the authors found that despi[INVESTIGATOR_385293], a considerable proportion of women reported 
at least slightly bothersome urinary frequency and UUI on the UDI -6 (~75% reported urinary frequency and 
66% had UUI at baseline that was at least “somewhat bothersome”). At 36 months postoperatively, 51 -60% 
were “cured” of urinary frequency and 73- 75% were cured o f UUI based on UDI -6 responses. The rate of de 
novo urgency was 3.1 -4.5% at 12 months and 5.6 -6.2% at 36 months. The authors go so far as to conclude 
that MUS “can be recommended in cases of mixed incontinence”.  
 Abdel -fattah performed an RCT comparing two transobturator MUS including 341 women with pure 
SUI or SUI -predominant MUI. In a secondary analysis evaluating only the subset of women with urodynamic 
MUI, (n=83/341, 24%), 52% of women were cured of urgency, 23% had persistent urgency, and 25% had wors ened urgency.
34 58% were cured of UUI, 24% had persistent UUI, and 19% had worsened UUI at 12

risk factor for sling failure by [CONTACT_380440] -I.[ADDRESS_482072] suggested that over half of women may

2.6. Limitations of existing MUS trials for the MUI population 
 The existing MUS RCT data are limited because they do not focus on women with MUI and the 
inclusion criteria almost always require one condition to be “predominant” or “more bothersome” (e.g. SUI -
predominant for most surgical trials and UUI -predominant for most medication trials). Thus, women with 
equally bothersome symptoms are typi[INVESTIGATOR_385294], or may feel pressured to “choose” a most bothersome 
condition in order to qualify for a trial. In addition, many MUS trials use a composite outcome to define 
failure (e.g. any self -reported incontinence or incontinence on diary) and therefore it is difficult to tease out

Version 2.0 SUI and OAB outcomes separately, which is highly important when counseling a patient  with MUI . Finally, 
ancillary studies from existing trials are underpowered to determine SUI and OAB outcomes separately.  
2.7. MIMOSA Trial: Firs t Network trial attempt focused on MUI population  
 In 2009 the UITN published on their experience with the “Mixed Incontinence: Medical or Surgical 
Approach” (MIMOSA) trial.37 MIMOSA was designed as a pr agmatic clinical trial randomizing women to 
nonsurgical treatment (pharmacological therapy and behavioral therapy) versus surgical treatment (MUS 
including TVT, TOT, TVT -O, fascial sling and Burch). After [ADDRESS_482073] inclusion criteria.  
Based on unpublished data from MIMOSA: of 24 women randomized with complete  follow- up data 
at 6 months, 71% met criteria of optimal outcome (defined as score < 2 on PGI -I and a score of < 2 on PGI -
S), suggesting that surgic al treatment may improve MUI symptoms at least in the short term.  
 To avoid the challenges encountered in MIMOSA, the ESTEEM protocol team carefully designed 
our treatment to ensure a fair perception of treatment arms in an efficacy trial design, and caref ully selected 
inclusion criteria that would not be overly strict, yet still allow recruitment of a MUI population (See Section 
4.2, Inclusion Criteria).  
2.8. Summary of known and potential risks and benefits of study treatment  
 BPTx has been shown to be beneficial when used for the treatment of MUI. Other than time and 
effort commitment and potential discomfort from a pelvic exam, the risks of BPTx are extremely low. MUS 
has been shown to be an effective treatment for SUI, and recent evidence suggests possi ble benefit for MUI 
populations also. However, there are women with MUI who report persistent or worse UUI/OAB symptoms after MUS and this is one potential risk. The remaining risks of MUS are not expected to be different for the 
ESTEEM p opulation compared  to previous  studies including pure- SUI or SUI -predominant MUI subjects.  
2.9. Significance of proposed study / Rationale for combined surgical and BPTx approach  
 In summary, at least three gaps of knowledge contribute to the clinical challenge of treating women 
with MUI who desire SUI surgery. First, there is a lack of data to guide counseling on expected outcomes, 
particularly for the OAB component after MUS (what happens to OAB symptoms after MUS?). Second, 
while persistent / worse ned OAB symptoms after s urgery are associated with patient dissatisfaction, there 
have been essentially no trials evaluating how to best treat this component peri -operatively (how do we 
improve OAB outcomes after MUS? Can combined treatment improve outcomes for MUI?). Third, ther e is 
little data on what factors may increase the risk of MUS “failure” in this population (who should or should not get a MUS if they have MUI?).  ESTEEM will provide the needed information to address these gaps.  
 Patients with MUI who ultimately elect surgery for SUI are often hopeful that their overall urinary 
condition will improve, but as surgeons we currently cannot assure patients this will be the outcome. 
Treatments that can optimize both OAB and SUI outcomes in this population are needed.  Studies have 
demonstrated potential clinical benefit of initiating perioperative  physical therapy after other procedures  
including prostatectomy
38, [ADDRESS_482074] similar effects on improving OAB outcomes in women with  MUI. The index surgery may serve as a 
“teachable moment” that can be used to reinforce principles  and adherence of BPTx to optimize outcomes, 
and/or an opportunity to affect postoperative tissue remodeling and neuromuscular dysfunction.   
2.10. Innovation  
 This proposal is innovative for several reasons. First, it studies a population of women who are  often 
excluded from clinical intervention trials but are at high risk for failing segregated SUI and UUI treatments . 
Second, in contrast to the historical paradigm of initiating treatments separately and stepwise for SUI and 
UUI, we will evaluate the effe ct of a combined surgical and non- surgical approach to optimize treatment 
outcomes.  Third, this study will provide critical information regarding OAB outcomes after MUS and will be

Version 2.0 powered to allow reporting of OAB and SUI outcomes separately after treatm ent.  Finally, we will gain 
important predictive information regarding which patients may experience improvement, worsening, or no 
change in their OAB symptoms. At the completion of this study, we will understand whether a combined behavioral/surgical trea tment approach is superior to surgery alone and will have predictive information that 
will be directly applicable to the clinical care of patients with this challenging condition.

Version 2.0 3.2 Masking issues  
 It is not feasible to mask the patients or interventionists to the BPTx intervention due to the nature of 
the treatment being studied. The team considered “sham” visits with interventionists; however, based on 
expert interventionist opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], sham interventions for UI involving the pelvic floor are extremely difficult to 
design in a way that is convincing yet maintains the integrity of the intervention itself. We also considered 
using “general massage” as a potential control group; however, there is some evidence suggesting that 
psychological stress is associated with OAB and irritative symptoms which could potentially contaminate the 
control group.41 Issues of adherence (or over -adherence) in the massage group are also possible, as 
women could schedule these independently from the study. For these reasons, t he team decided it was not 
feasible to incorporate any sham procedures in the control group.  
 Study surgeons and outcome assessors will be masked to treatment assignment. All outcome 
measures will be collected by [CONTACT_385331]. Study coordinator s / clinical staff performing 
objective measurement of PFM strength will be masked (Aim 7).  All patient -reported outcomes (PROs) will 
be administered prior to other clinical assessments or procedures.

  Efforts will be made by [CONTACT_385332]/staff members to remind the patient that the 
surgeon is masked t o her treatment assignment. If she desires additional treatment, it is likely the surgeon 
would offer BPTx as additional treatment and she will be reminded that she can decline additional BPTx 
without revealing to her surgeon that she received the BPTx int ervention. Such methods have been 
effective for past  PFDN trials (e.g. OPTIMAL trial
42).  
3.3. Randomization and Stratification  
Patients will be assigned to one of the two treatment groups with a randomization sequence 
prepared and maintained centrally by [CONTACT_36909] (DCC). Allocation to the treatment 
groups will be 1:1. Randomly ordered permuted blocks will be used, with block sizes known only by [CONTACT_219001]. The web -based data management system will provide the treatment assignment for each participant 
as she is randomized. Thus, the allocation sequence will be concealed from clinical site staff.  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_68566]. It is important that UUI “severity” is comparable in 
both groups as it is a potential risk factor for treatment failure. Therefore, randomization will also be 
stratified based on UUI “severity”  which will be defined by [CONTACT_385333][INVESTIGATOR_1841] (IEs) on diary. This will ensure that wo men who have more frequent, or more “severe” UUI are 
equally distributed between the two groups. SUI severity is less of an issue because all subjects will be 
receiving the same treatment for SUI.  
 Burgio et al,43 identified risk factors for unsuccessful behavioral treatment of urge/urge- predominant 
MUI.  Women who had >10 IE/week on a 7 -day diary diary at baseline were much less likely to be 
completely continent after behavioral treatment. Therefore, for a 3- day diary, this would translate into ~4 IEs 
on a 3 -day diary as a potential risk factor for treatment failure.  
PFDN Protocol    2-12-14 
ESTEEM  
Confidential  
16 
Version 2.0  There is limited data to support stratification based on presence of pr eoperative DO on UDE.  One 
study found that up to 38% will have resolution of DO after MUS.[ADDRESS_482076] that baseline DO is associated with 
greater improvement in OAB symptoms postoperatively. Choe et al  evaluated 132 women with MUI who 
underwent MUS and found a higher proportion of women with preoperative DO had complete resolution of 
OAB symptoms postoperatively compared to those without DO (37% vs. 18%).46 A secondary analysis of 
TOMUS data supported that more severe UUI (by [CONTACT_385334]) was a risk factor for non -SUI sling failure 
after MUS  (or failure due to UUI) ;29 however, baseline DO was not a risk factor (28% vs 21% objective 
failure for women with and without DO, respectively).30  
 Based on the existing evidence, the team  reached consensus that women should be stratified based 
on a cutoff of > 4 urge IEs on 3 -day diary. The team agreed that there was insufficient data regarding 
preoperative DO to stratify by [CONTACT_385335]; however, this data will be collected for exploratory  analyses.  
 
3.4. Outcomes  
 
Figure 3. ESTEEM outcomes  
 
 
3.4.1. Detailed Description of Primary Study Outcome  
The primary outcome for this study is the mean change from baseline in UDI -total score at 1 year 
postoperative.  The U DI is a validated, disease specific patient -reported outcome (PRO) measure. A PRO is 
a measurement of any aspect of a patient’s health status that comes directly from the patient (without interpretation by [CONTACT_099], researcher, other). In clinical tri als, symptom indices and quality of life PRO 
instruments are being increasingly used as primary outcomes and supported by [CONTACT_370079].
37, 47, 48  
The long form of the UDI is a 19 item, validated UI symptom spec ific questionnaire with 3 subscales: 
stress, irritative, and obstructive  symptoms .[ADDRESS_482077] validity (convergent) was originally established by [CONTACT_385336] s cores with the number of IEs on 7 -day 
diary and pad tests. Criterion validity was established by [CONTACT_385337]. The UDI can effectively discriminate between known UI clinical groups and diagnoses (specifical ly genuine SUI, urodynamic detrusor overactivity, or mixed) and is responsive to change. These 
are some minimum qualities needed for valid interpretation of a PRO in a clinical trial.  
Although it is fairly simple to determine the statistical significance of a change in a symptom index, 
placing the magnitude of these changes in a context that is meaningful for patients is more difficult . The  Aims          Outcomes

Version 2.0 minimum important difference (MID) of a measure is a score change that should reflect a clinically 
meaningful response to treatment and represents the “between group criterion” that needs to be met or 
exceeded in order for study results to be considered clinically meaningful.  From the patient perspective, 
MID can be defined as “the smallest difference in score in the domain of interest which patients perceive as beneficial...” 
[ADDRESS_482078], a combination of approaches is 
often used to determine a reasonable range of MID scores. Importantly, there are published MID ranges for 
the total UDI sc ore and its subscales for urge predominant and pure stress/stress predominant urinary 
incontinence populations.  
Table 3 summarizes the relevant published MID data for the UDI. Dyer et al used the BE -DRI study 
population to determine MID values for the UDI and UDI -irritative subscale.
50  The BE -DRI population 
included 94% subjects with urge -predominant MUI based on bladder diary with a baseline mean UDI total 
score of 120 (49) points and UDI -irritative subscale score of 58 (22) points.  Using anchor based methods, 
the authors recommend an MID of -35 for total UDI and -15 for UDI -irritative scores for this population.  
Barber et al used the Ambulatory Treatments for Leakage Associated with Stress Incontinence Trial 
(ATLA S) study population and determined MID values for the UDI total and UDI –stress subscales.51 This 
population was pure/stress -predominant MUI, undergoing conservative treatment for SUI. The baseline 
mean UDI score was lower at 80 (40) points and UDI -stress was 47 (19) points. Based on their findings, the 
authors recommend an MID of -11 and -8 for the UDI total and stress subscale scores respectively.

 #1. Compare postoperative mean UDI scores  between groups at 1 year   
#2. Compare mean changes  (delta) in UDI scores from baseline to 1- year between groups 
(preferred, see below)  
#3. Dichotomize “success” and “failure” as women who achieved a 35 point improvement versus 
those who did not (also known as “res ponder analysis”)  
  We chose not to dichotomize our outcome for many reasons (option #3). Dichotomizing women as 
“success” or “failure” based on MID could simplify interpretation; however, using purely a responder 
analysis approach has limitations and some  authors recommend avoiding this for primary analyses in 
trials.
[ADDRESS_482080] “slightly” improved, but 
PFDN Protocol    2-12-[ADDRESS_482081] not enough to be classified as a “success”. Also relevant to ESTEEM, if both groups worsened but one 
group “worsened less”, this information would also be lost using this approach.  
 Because the trial is randomized and we will be stratifying by [CONTACT_385338], we would expect the 
baseline UDI scores to be similar between groups. If the average baseline score is the s ame in the two 
groups, then comparing  the mean change in UDI score between groups (option #2) is mathematically 
equivalent to comparing post -operative UDI scores at 1 year between groups (option #1). However, option 
#2 has some advantages in that (1) if baseline scores are not the same in the two groups, comparing the mean change in UDI score between groups at 12 months will account for that baseline difference, and (2) 
UDI scores typi[INVESTIGATOR_44769] a distribution that is highly skewed, but differences from baseline should be close 
enough to being normally distributed that analysis methods that assume a normal distribution can be used.   
3.4.1.a Rationale for using UDI as primary study outcome  
Due to limitations in how to best  define successful treatment of MUI , the investigators had extensive 
discussion around whether an objective, subjective, or composite outcome would be best for this trial. The 
team agreed that the primary outcome must remain true to the clinical question and be clinically relevant in 
captur ing both potential benefit and harm of both the control and the intervention for this trial.  It is critical  
that the outcome is  meaningful from the patient perspective and will be able to capture OAB improvement, 
worsening, or no change in symptoms. The t eam discussed using bladder diary, patient global impression, 
or OAB PROs . Arguments against each of these  were  based on the following rationale:  
 1. Problems with using bladder diary as primary outcome:  
a. Diary does not capture a meaningful patient outc ome- It is becoming clear that typi[INVESTIGATOR_385295], voided volumes, etc do not capture what is meaningful to patients. Counting IEs on diary likely does not capture what is important to a patient (e.g. having 3 large u rge leaks a 
day may be more bothersome than having 20 small stress leaks or having 20 urgency associated voids may be more bothersome than having 1 UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]). In addition, diary IEs do not correlate perfectly with 
patient satisfaction.
[ADDRESS_482082] been shown to be less reliable in women with MUI, 
particularly for the SUI component.54 
b. Diary c utoffs to define improvement for MUI are unknown- What percent improvement for the SUI 
component and for the UUI component is clinically important for a woman with MUI? Any cutoffs chosen 
would be arbitrary.  
c. Using IEs on bladder diary as a pr imary outcome would require a minimum number of IEs 
(approximately 3 -4 IE/3days) at baseline to be able to detect a change. The protocol team felt that setting 
such strict inclusion criteria would be too limiting to allow recruitment of a good range of MUI  severity (see 
Inclusion Criteria, Section 4.2).  
For all of these reasons, the team decided against using bladder diary IEs as the primary outcome 
and to instead focus on measures that can capture outcomes from the patient perspective.  
 
2. Problems with u sing global impression measure as primary outcome  
A patient’s overall/global impression of improvement would be reflective of her overall urinary 
condition. Although this outcome would seemingly be ideal for capturing a meaningful outcome, for our trial 
it could potentially introduce bias. Because it is not feasible to mask subjects in ESTEEM to the intervention 
(BPTx), a single, subjective global impression item would be subject to bias. For example, if subjects in the 
control group were more likely to ask  for additional treatment and report they were not “improved” because 
they knew there was another potential treatment available that they did not receive, this would bias our 
study towards a higher failure rate in the control group (making our intervention seem more effective than it 
really is). The challenges of masking or designing a sham procedure for the control group for ESTEEM have already been noted above (Section 3.2).  
 
3. Problems with using OAB PRO measure as primary outcome  
PFDN Protocol    2-12-14 
ESTEEM  
Confidential  
19 
Version 2.0 Finally, we considered  using an OAB PRO as the primary outcome, such as the Overactive Bladder 
Questionnaire (OAB -q)[ADDRESS_482083] this may be the case.27, 28 Finally, there are 
some women with MUI who may not be able to clearly distinguis h all UI epi[INVESTIGATOR_385296] - or urge - related 
and the team felt it would be important to also capture these symptoms. Finally, s pecifically regarding the 
OAB- q, there is less validity data in  a MUI population compared to the UDI.  
 
For all of these reasons,  using the UDI as the primary outcome is ideal and it has all of the 
characteristics that are important for a MUI population:  
1. The overall UDI score includes both a stress and irritative subscale, allowing us to 
comprehensively capture both SUI and OAB s ymptom outcomes.  
2. It captures a meaningful outcome from the patient perspective, incorporating both the presence 
and bother of SUI and OAB symptoms.  
3. It includes [ADDRESS_482084] a priori analysis plans (see Section 6, Statistical Considerations).  
3.4.1.b. Rationale for timing of prim ary outcome:  
 There was significant discussion regarding the best timing for the primary outcome. In framing this 
question, the group considered at which time- point would a difference in outcome lead to recommendation 
of BPTx as part of clinical practice. Long -term outcomes of 1 year and/or more are “standard” for surgical 
trials and are important to determine if a surgical treatment is worthwhile. However, outcomes for BPTx 
trials are often shorter, between 3- [ADDRESS_482085] 6 months or greater.  
 Based on these considerations, the primary outcome will be the change in UDI score from baseline 
and 12 months postoperative, given the intervention is the combination of BPTx and surgery, with Time 0 = 
the time of surgery. Note that if a participant is randomized but surgery is not performed, then Time 0 will be 
the planned surgery date. A secondary outcome  will include time to failure; therefore, we will be able to 
detect any potential early differences that are not sustained at 12 months (See Section 6, Statistical 
Analysis). Additional ass essments will be made at [ADDRESS_482086] additional treatment for SUI and/or OAB after MUS:  
 The overarching goal of ESTEEM is to evaluate the effect of combined treatment on improving both 
SUI and UUI outcomes in women with MUI. Therefore, any request for additional treatment for any lower 
urinary tract symptoms (SUI, UUI/OAB , voiding dysfunction) before the 1 year outcome for either of these 
symptoms will be considered treatment failure.  The team agreed it would be difficult to withhold additional 
treatment from either group for the 1 year study duration; however, any additional treatment should be 
initiated after the acute  postoperative recovery period. Clinically, some women may experience immediate 
PFDN Protocol    2-12-[ADDRESS_482087] reached a baseline. This will allow enough time for 
complete physical and tissue recovery from the surgical procedure, will allow for assessment of potential BPTx early benefits, and will provide information on the natural course of OAB symptoms in the early 
postoperative period which is important for clinical counseling and decision- making. Any subjects receiving 
additional treatment prior to the 3 month time point will be considered a protocol deviation.  
In the event that a randomized participant decides not to undergo surgery but then later changes her 
mind and has MUS surgery, the surgery will be considered additional treatment. For purposes of calculating follow up windows, the date of the original planned surgery that did not  occur will be Time 0.  
Subjects who initiate additional treatment will be asked to complete all primary and secondary 
outcome measures prior to initiation of additional treatment. The type of additional treatment will not be 
limited and will be left to the physician’s clin ical judgment. This may include ( but is not limited to) behavioral 
and/or pelvic floor therapy, continence pessary, medical therapy, other procedure- based treatments 
(posterior tibial nerve stimulation, Botox), and surgical (sling revision, re -placement, sacral 
neuromodulation). Statistical models designed to specifically account for subjects who initiate additional 
treatment will be used. Please see Section 6, Statistical Considerations section for details on how the 
analysis of primary and secondary outcomes measured at 1 year will account for any additional treatment 
requests for SUI and/or OAB if initiated prior to the [ADDRESS_482088] differences in OAB and SUI symptom outcomes separately.  
 
3.4.2.a. Urge urinary incontinence/overactive bladder symptom outcomes  
Because t he primary clinical problem in this population is the potential for persistent or worsening 
OAB after MUS, it is highly important to capture and report on the cardinal symptoms of OAB from the patient perspective. The UDI -irritative subscale measures sympt om burden, impact, and changes related to 
OAB which are important aspects that cannot be directly observed or otherwise measured. It is highly 
responsive to treatment -related change and is able to discriminate among levels of change in all bladder 
diary variables (urinary urgency, frequency and urge incontinence) and patient ratings of treatment benefit. Particularly for ESTEEM, this comprehensive OAB measure will be important to understanding how MUS 
may affect all OAB symptoms individually and as a whole.   
 
3.4.2.b. Stress urinary incontinence symptom outcomes  
 It is also important to be able to report on SUI outcomes separately. The majority of studies have not 
demonstrated significant differences in efficacy for SUI outcomes for subjects who had MUI preoperatively; 
however the majority of studies only had small  subsets of women with MUI. Two studies  have suggested 
worse SUI outcomes in women with MUI at baseline (see section 2.4 above). One study by [CONTACT_385339] 274 women, of which 73 had MUI and reported cure rates for SUI to be 78% for the MUI group 
and 95% for the pure SUI group.
57 They also reported that maximal urethral pressure at baseline was 
associated with a greater risk of persistent OAB, suggesting the possibility that profound urethral 
dysfunction may contribute to persistent symptoms. A study by [CONTACT_385340] 534 women with MUS found that women with MUI had higher rates of SUI compared 
to women with SUI only (36% vs 16%, p <.001) with an adjusted OR = 2.7 (95% CI 1.7, 4.2) (unpublished 
data). In addition, because BPTx can also treat SUI, it is important to know if women randomized to

Version 2.0 MUS+BPTx have improved SUI symptom outcomes as well. Therefore, as a secondary outcome, we w ill 
also compare SUI outcomes between women randomized to MUS + BPTx versus MUS alone. SUI 
symptoms will be measured using the UDI -stress subscale.  
3.4.3. Other outcomes  
3.4.3.a. Other UUI/OAB outcomes  
i. Bladder diary  – We will assess the change in IE fr equency and type, number of urgency epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], 
urgency severity with voids, number of diurnal voids, and number of nocturnal voids and compare these variables between groups at 6 months and 1 year.  
 
ii. Overactive Bladder treatment satisfaction (OAB -SAT-q)58-The OAB -SAT-q is an 11 item 
instrument designed to assess patient satisfaction with treatment in a clinical setting. There are three 3- item 
subscales (Satisfaction, Side Effects, Endorsement) and two single items  (Convenience, Preference). 
Response options are presented on 4- , 5-, and 6- point Likert scales. It has demonstrated good 
psychometric properties in OAB/UUI patients receiving anticholinergic and anticholinergic + behavioral 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. We will compare change from baseline in OAB -SAT-q scores at 6 months and 1 year between 
treatment groups.  
 
iii.  Overactive Bladder Questionnaire- Symptom subscale (OAB -q) – The OAB -q is a validated, 
responsive questionnaire that includes 8 symptom bother items (SS) and 25 health related quality of life (HRQOL) items of 4 subscales (copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], concern, sleep, and social interaction).
55 In a systematic review of 
UI questionnaires by [CONTACT_385341], the OAB -q was rated as “grade A”, highest recommendation specifically 
for OAB symptoms.59  Each item is rated on a 6 -point Likert scale ranging f rom “not at all bothered” to “a 
very great deal bothered” for symptom items and “none of the time” to “all of the time” for HRQOL items. 
Subscales are summed and transformed into scores ranging from 0 -100 with higher bother scores 
indicating increasing sym ptom bother and higher HRQOL scores indicating better quality of life.60,61 We will 
compare change from baseline in OAB -q scores at 6 months and 1 year between treatment groups.  
 
3.4.3.b. Time to failure  
 For analyzing time to failure, “f ailure ” will be defined as initiation of any additional treatment  for either 
SUI or UUI/O AB symptoms  during the follow -up period. Subjects lost to follow up will be censored at the 
time of their last visit.    
3.4.3.c. Quality of life/global impression  
We will compare change from baseline in the scores below at 6 months and 1 year between trea tment 
groups.  
 a) Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ)  
 b) Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220]) 62

3.4.3.e. Pelvic floor muscle (PFM) strength  
 PFM strength has traditionally been measured subjectively by a clinician or interventionist using the 
Brink score in many previous studies, including Network studies. Howev er, because this is a subjective 
measure, it may be subject to bias. Although there are many trials showing symptom improvement with 
pelvic floor therapy20, there are limited studies evaluating the association between PFM strength and 
improvements in UI symptoms. To contribute to the literature about this issue, in ESTEEM we wil l 
objectively assess PFM strength changes using the Peritron Perineometer. Peritron is an advanced 
pressure biofeedback perineometer specifically designed for pelvic floor assessment. Pelvic floor muscle 
contraction creates pressure in the sensor that is t ransferred and displayed on a “Readout Unit” which is 
small and handheld.  
 
 
FIGURE 4. Peritron Perineometer  
 
Example: Peritron 9300 Device ( www.win -health.com/perineomter.html ) 
 
After a thorough search of the literature and discussion with other experts in the field, the protocol 
investigators concluded that the Peritron device has adequate evidence to support its validity, including test -
retest reliability and inter-rater reliability, for both baseline and maximum contraction pressure 
measurements. In addition, studies support its reliability in “normal”, continent controls as well as women 
with UI.  
Studies evaluating the Peritron’s reliability properties are in Table 4. A study by [CONTACT_385342], parous women (inter -rater 
reliability for baseline and maximum pressure 0.78 to 0.88).64  This is supported in normative women as well 
(correlation r=0.83).[ADDRESS_482089] received. PFM measures (Maximum squeeze amplitude and duration of 
squeeze), will be performed at baseline, at the fi rst post -operative visit after surgery (2 weeks), 8  weeks,  
and at the primary endpoint (12 months) –  See Assessment Table 11. Changes in squeeze measures from 
baseline at 8 weeks and 12 months will be compared between treatment groups.

We plan to cap ture incremental direct health care, direct non -medical, and indirect resource use related to 
study interventions and complications and other urinary incontinence management (such as other UI 
treatment, UI products and management of side effects).  Costs w ill be estimated using the resource costing 
method .   Direct medical service use collected from each study case report form and direct non -medical and 
indirect costs collected from patient questionnaires are monetized by [CONTACT_385343]. Detailed individual cost data will not be 
collected.  This method allows a consistent capture of resource use when costs are incurred across multiple 
health systems or payers. Detailed cas e report forms, that include the interventions performed (e.g. 
midurethral sling surgery and behavioral/pelvic floor therapy sessions) and clinical events (e.g. complications and additional treatment) will be completed by [CONTACT_385344]. Patient 
questionnaire on direct non- medical costs (e.g. pads, laundry) and indirect costs (e.g. time, lost productivity)

Rationale for using the EQ -5D to measure Utility Values  
 
The European Quality of Life- 5 Dimensions (EQ -5D) (EuroQol Group, http://www.euroqol.org), preference-
based utility index algorithm wi ll be used to calculate each subject’s utility index.69  This instrument will be 
collected at baseline and follow up study visits (3, 6,  and 12 months). The EQ -5D has 5 attributes (mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) with 3 levels each for a possible 243 
unique health states.  The EQ -5D scoring Function is based on the time -tradeoff method with [LOCATION_006] Scores 
ranging from  -0.59 to1.00 and US Scores from - 0.11 to 1.00.   This instrument has been previously 
validated in women with urinary incontinence (Penn  preliminary data, Tables  6 and 7) and used in women 
with urinary incontinence.70, 71 These data will be used to compare change in QALYs between the two 
treatment groups. We are choosing to use a general scale to calculate change in utilities (rather than condition- specific) to allow for comparison of cost -effectiveness results with other interventions and 
diseases.  
 
PFDN Protocol    2-12-[ADDRESS_482098] non -medical costs (e.g. pads, laundry) and indirect costs (e.g. ti me, lost 
productivity) will be administered.  Based on similar questionnaires used in SISTEr17 and ValUE72 studies, 
this instrument should take approximately [ADDRESS_482099] to complete at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 
months.

4. SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS  
Adult women aged 21 or older with bothersome MUI (defined as bothersome S UI and UUI) will be eligible.  
 
4.1. Eligibility Criteria/Rationale for inclusion/exclusion 
4.1.1. Defining the ESTEEM MUI population 
 For ESTEEM, women must demonstrate both subjective bothersome SUI and UUI and objective 
documentation of both conditions.  The team wanted to ensure that our eligibility criteria would identify the 
appropriate MUI population, but wanted to avoid overly strict criteria that may hinder recruitment such as in MIMOSA.  
However, as already discussed, the MUI population is difficul t to define. Currently, an instrument that 
can clearly segregate SUI versus UUI symptoms and assess the magnitude of bother that is predictive of 
clinical outcomes for MUI does not exist . Therefore, defining our inclusion criteria for this MUI population i s 
critical, but we recognize that whatever criteria are selected may not be considered to be strictly “evidence-
based”.   
We reviewed the literature on common definitions of SUI and UUI used in previous clinical trials to 
help determine our criteria. Trial s for SUI often use a subjective report of SUI in combination with a positive 
cough stress test (CST). CST has a 90 -100% test -retest reliability.
[ADDRESS_482100] or UDE.  
The team reviewed bladder diary criteria for existing SUI and UUI trials (summarized in Table 8 ). 
Ultimately the goal of ESTEEM is to capture those women who have MUI that are most clinically 
challenging because it is unclear which to treat first and for which a MUS potentially could be efficacious, 
detrimental, or  neutral. It is not the patient who has severe UUI who needs sacral neuromodulation that we 
are interested in recruiting for ESTEEM. In addition, unlike previous UUI trials, because our primary 
outcome is not  defined by [CONTACT_385346], the diary will be utilized only to document the presence of 
both SUI and UUI IEs. Therefore, the number of IEs does not have to be set “so high” solely to allow demonstration of outcome improvement.  
Therefore the team decided that at least [ADDRESS_482101] be documented on a 3 -day 
diary: a minimum of [ADDRESS_482102] “moderate bother” 
from UUI on the UDI will help to ensure a more severe UUI population (with MUI ) than TOMUS.

19) Women who have undergone anteri or or api[INVESTIGATOR_385306] [ADDRESS_482105] used bladder capacity as a criteria for whether a woman with MUI i s eligible for  an anti -
incontinence procedure for SUI, often excluding women with capacities <150- 200 cc  to avoid exacerbation 
of OAB symptoms . Upon review of the literature, there is very little evidence to support excluding women 
with a “small” bladder c apacity, or to guide what volume defines a “small” capacity bladder. Gamble et al 
performed a retrospective study to evaluate predictors of persistent postoperative detrusor overactivity after 
a variety of slings.79 They found that the mean maximum cystometric capacity was smaller in women with 
postoperative persistent DO compared to those with resolved DO. However, the mean capacity in women with persistent DO was 459 cc (SD 185) versus 539 cc (SD 176), which does not support the traditional 
teaching of avoiding slings in women with capacities less than 150- 200 cc. Also, 37% of their study 
population included traditional bladder neck slings, which may be more obstructive than MUS.  Finally, the 
proportion of women reporting UUI symptoms  in this study was not different between women who had 
resolved versus persistent DO, highlighting the limitation of using UDE parameters to predict symptoms.  
Numerous other studies have failed to demonstrate any specific bladder capac ity cutoff that is associated 
with better or worse outcomes or poses a safety issue for MUS.  
 Because there is a lack of evidence to support setting a minimum bladder capacity cutoff for this 
study, women determined to be eligible for a MUS based on their clinician’s judgment will be eligible for 
ESTEEM, regardless of bladder capacity. One advantage of the ESTEEM design is that only women who 
have been offered a MUS by [CONTACT_385347]. Therefore, if the provider determines that the 
patient is not clinically a candidate for a MUS, she will not be eligible. In addition, we will be excluding 
women with a history of painful bladder or chronic pelvic pain syndromes who often have “small” capacity 
bladders. To further contribute to the literature about this issue, we will collect data on both maximum 
cystometric capacity on UDE and functional bladder capacity based on voiding diaries and evaluate these 
variables as potential predictors of worsening OAB symptoms in our exploratory analyses.  
 
4.4. S creening for Eligibility  
 It is anticipated that participants will come from PFDN Clinical Site practices. Women with MUI will 
be offered the full range of treatment options consistent with routine practice including expectant 
management, pelvic floor musc le therapy, behavioral therapy, medication and possibly surgery. Those 
PFDN Protocol    2-12-[ADDRESS_482106] 3 
months. The coordinator will also document that the patient understands that behavioral/pelvic floor therapy 
is a treatment option for MUI outsi de of ESTEEM (See section 5.3, “What is the best control group”). She 
will be instructed on how to complete the voiding diary.  
 To address the issue of overactive bladder medication use, these subjects will be required to have a 
washout of [ADDRESS_482107] half -life 
currently on the market is Vesicare with a half life of 45- 68 hours. Therefore, by 1 week there should be 
negligible amounts in the bloodstream and by 2 weeks the drug would be  completely out of the system. 
Therefore, 3 weeks should be adequate time for washout and this time period is consistent with prior PFDN 
studies (ABC trial
78). In addition, because we are highly interested in what happens to OAB outcomes after 
MUS, subjects will need to remain off of overactive bladder medication until 3 months postoperative to allow 
accurate assessment of these symptoms postoperatively  (See statistical analysis plan for details on why 3 
months is adequate to allow analyses) . Subjects who re- start overactive bladder medication  postoperatively 
will be considered as having “additional treatment”. Every effort will be made to schedule the patient’s 
surgery within 3 months from enrollment (see Section 4. 6, Appointment scheduling below).  
 
4.5. Baseline Visit  
 At the baseline visit, the voiding diary will be reviewed to ensure that entries are clear and 
interpretable. If the first baseline voiding diary is not acceptable, the subject will be allowed one mor e 
attempt. If the second baseline voiding diary is not acceptable, the subject will not be eligible for the trial.  
 Once eligibility is confirmed, pre -treatment  information will be obtained including:  
• Demographics – age, race/ethnicity, education level  
• Medical history –  prior urinary incontinence procedures and treatments, prior pelvic 
surgeries, comorbidities, smoking, medications  
• Physical exam –  Body mass index, pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POPQ), PFM

5. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1. Midurethral sling procedure (both groups)  
 To address the potential issue that different sling or mesh types may result in different outcomes, 
MUS types will be standardized.  All women (both groups) will receive a MUS which can include the TVT™ 
(mec hanical cut mesh only, Gynecare, ETHICON Women’s Health & Urology, Somerville, NJ), TVT -O™ 
(mechanical cut mesh only, Gynecare), or Monarc™ (American Medical Systems, Minnetonka, MN). In the 
TOMUS trial and Barber’s equivalence trial, these approaches and devices demonstrated equivalence for 
improving objective success of SUI and were not significantly different for subjective success, persistent 
UUI or de novo UUI.24, 31 The Gynecare “laser -cut” slings will not be a llowed in this trial due to data from 
Moalli et al showing that the laser -cut meshes are “stiffer” (less deformation under an applied load), which 
theoretically may increase risk of mesh complications.80 Although it is unclear how “laser -cut” meshes may 
affect clinical outcomes, these types of slings were not included in the TOMUS or Barber’s equivalence trials resulting in less published, long- term outcome data. “Mini -sling” or “single -incision” slings will not be 
allowed.  Key aspects of the procedure will be standardized across surgeons and sites.  
  
5.1.a. Surgeon Certification-  To address the issue of surgeon certification and to ensure standardized 
training of all surgeons, all “certified surgeons” will have performed a minimum of [ADDRESS_482109] sign off that each participating  surgeon has met the criteria.  
 
5.1.b. Standardization of sling procedures:  
 Detailed standardization of the surgical procedure will be developed and w ill include the following 
key points:  
 1. The participating surgeon must be present and scrubbed for key portions of the procedure. 
Residents and fellows may participate in procedures as is standard for each Clinical Site 
 2. All subjects will receive preoperative intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis. The choice of antibiotic 
will be determined by [CONTACT_67296].  
 3. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis is required for all participants. The choice of prophylaxis will be 
determined by [CONTACT_67296].  
 4. Any concomitant native tissue procedures must be declared prior to randomization. Per exclusion 
criteria, women clinically requiring anterior vaginal prolapse or api[INVESTIGATOR_385307].  
 5. Tensioning of the sling will be performed in a fashion to ensure that it  is a tension- free technique. 
This can include either by [CONTACT_1299] a blunt instrument between the sling and the urethra, or by [CONTACT_385348] a small 
knuckle of mesh in a Babcock clamp or similar  method during tensioning.  
 
5.1.c. Need for postoperative sling revis ion: 
 To address the issue of postoperative sling revision, the team developed a plan for several potential 
scenarios which may require the surgeon to revise the sling, detailed below . Women who undergo a sling 
revision will all be considered as having “additional treatment” in outcome analyses regardless of indication.  
Prior to sling revision, subjects will complete all outcome assessments  including the primary outcome (UDI) . 
 1. Urinary retention / incomplete bladder emptying (abnormal PVR) –  An abnormal post-void residual 
is defined as PVR > 150 cc in this protocol (consistent with exclusion criteria). This is a known complication after MUS, and there is no evidence to support that this would be higher in women with MUI. Based on 
Barber’s trial which incl uded 70% women with MUI, the sling revision rate was 0 -1%, which is also 
consistent with the TOMUS trial. For retention/incomplete emptying, the postoperative management and 
need for sling revision will be left up to the surgeon’s clinical judgment.  
PFDN Protocol    2-12-14 
ESTEEM

31 
Version 2.0  2. Worsening OAB /lower urinary tract  symptoms with a normal  PVR – it is possible that some 
women may experience worsening OAB symptoms immediately postoperatively. It is unclear from the 
literature in which women such symptoms may be transient and ultimately r esolve once postoperative 
recovery is complete, or in which women it will persist and/or worsen over time (an aim of ESTEEM). 
Therefore, for women with a normal PVR complaining of worsening OAB symptoms, sling revision will be 
deferred until 3 months postoperatively. This will provide important information about the natural course of 
these symptoms in the immediate postoperative period, and whether BPTx is effective for improving these 
symptoms early on. If after 3 months the patient desires sling revision due to worsening OAB symptoms, the 
surgeon can perform the procedure based on his/her clinical judgment. There is no evidence to support any 
potential harm by [CONTACT_385349] a woman with OAB symptoms and a normal PVR.  
 3. Persistent SUI symptom s – For women who have persistent SUI symptoms, sling 
revision /replacement  can be performed after 3 months based on the surgeon’s clinical judgment.   
5.2. Background for BPTx intervention  
 To develop the most evidence- based, reproducible, standardized, and logical BPTx intervention 
protocol, the team reviewed the evidence and determined that bladder training/urge suppression 
techniques, pelvic floor muscle therapy, and weight loss have high level of evidence for treatment of urinary 
incontinence. Therefor e, weight loss will be discussed with all women, and bladder training/urge 
suppression and pelvic muscle exercises will be incorporated into the ESTEEM BPTx intervention.  
The summary of evidence for 5 key questions relevant to our intervention are summari zed below:  
5.2.1. What is the evidence for behavioral/lifestyle modification?   
 There are many components that can be defined as “behavioral” or “lifestyle” modification including 
caffeine intake, fluid intake, obesity, smoking, constipation and timed voi ding. A summary of ICI evidence 
and recommendations is below:  
 
Table 9. Summary of ICI recommendations  
Modification  Level of evidence  Grade of 
recommendation  Recommendation  
1. Caffeine intake  2 B Caffeine reduction may improve incontinence  
2. Fluid intak e 3 B Minor decreases by 25% may be recommended 
provided baseline consumption is not less than 
one liter a day  
3. Weight loss  1 A Morbidly and moderately obese women should 
consider weight loss to reduce UI  
4. Smoking  3 None  More research  
5. Constipatio n 3 None  More research  
6. Timed voiding  3 C Two-hour voiding intervals in women with mild 
UI and infrequent voiding patterns  
7. Bladder training/urge 
suppression  1 A Recommended for UI reduction  
 
Caffeine:   Aside from the volume of fluid ingested with t hese beverages, caffeine has been shown to have a 
diuretic effect and may increase OAB symptoms by [CONTACT_385350].
81-[ADDRESS_482110] produced conflicting results, but there are some small studies 
suggesting decreasing caffeine may improve continence.85 
 Fluid intake:   Excessive fluid intake can certainly increase urinary frequency and exacerbate OAB 
symptoms.
[ADDRESS_482111] older adults, fluid intake should be approximately six 8 -oz 
glasses per day.88    
 
Weight loss:   Obesity, defined as a body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2, was traditionally 
considered a risk factor for S UI only but more recently has been appreciated as a risk factor for OAB and 
UUI as well.89, 90  Bump et al showed improvement in both SUI and UUI following surgical weight reduction 
in morbidly obese women.91  But, even moderate weight loss can improve bladder symptoms in overweight 
women. A large randomized t rial demonstrated that a structured weight loss intervention group resulting in a 
loss of 8% of body weight was associated with a clinically relevant reduction of 70% or more in the 
frequency of all IEs (P<.001), SUI (P=.009), and urge IEs (P=.04) compared to a control group which only 
lost 1.6% of body weight.90, 92   
 
Smoking:   Smoking, particularly nicotine, has been implicated as a risk factor for OAB and incontinence.93, 94  
Potential etiologies are increased intra -abdominal pressure from chronic cough and increased nicotine 
induced detrusor overacti vity (as shown in cats).[ADDRESS_482112] of 
smoking cessation on bladder symptoms.  
 
Constipation:   Constipation is a common co- morbid complaint among patients with OAB and UI.96-[ADDRESS_482113] resolving constipation 
improves OAB symptoms.  Promotion of bowel regularity initially through natural methods including 
increasing dietary fiber, increasing water intake, physical activity and use of stool softeners is often 
recomm ended because it is low risk; however the evidence for its effect on improving OAB or UUI 
symptoms in the general adult population is limited.  
 
Timed Voiding:  Timed voiding or prompted voiding is a mechanism to theoretically increase bladder 
awareness, al though firm evidence for its effectiveness for UI does not exist.  Timed voiding involves a 
voiding schedule that starts with interval voiding on a fixed schedule regardless of the desire to go.
[ADDRESS_482114] cognitive function.  For some patients who delay 
urination, initially decreasing the voiding interval to every 30- 90 minutes may be necessary to decrease 
incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_385308].100 The maintenance of the timed 
voiding schedule during nighttime hours is determined by [CONTACT_102]’s general sleep pattern (weather he/she awakens naturally to void), their motivation to stay dry (whether he/she sets an alarm to make sure 
to awaken), and the availability of help if needed.   
 
5.2.2. What is the evidence for bladder trai ning/urge suppression? 
 Bladder training through urgency control and suppression techniques has been an effective means 
of decreasing the intensity of urgency and incontinence in well motivated patients.  Bladder training, sometimes referred to as bladder retraining, bladder reeducation or bladder drills, may be effective as the 
result of rewiring of complex circuitry between the bladder and the brain.
101  The training consists of three 
important components, (1) education about bladder function, dysfunction and urgency control strategies; (2) 
a timed voiding regimen that evolves to gradually increase the interval between voids; and (3) positive 
feedback and reinforce ment by [CONTACT_50633].102, 103  Utilization of relaxation techniques including slow deep 
breathing and distraction techniques (mental concentration on other tasks) are most popular during urgency 
suppression.100  Additional strategies including rapid contractions of the pelvic floor, or quick flicks 
(described below) and the use of self -motivating statements (“I can do it,” “I am in control.”) are also 
PFDN Protocol    2-12-[ADDRESS_482115] to the bathroom as this  
may increase intra -abdominal pressure and promote leakage.  Bladder training is used to slowly increase 
the interval between voids in attempts of reestablishing normal voiding intervals, break previously formed 
voiding habits, and diminishing urgency.  In  general, the voiding interval is increased on a weekly basis by 
[CONTACT_3450] 15 to 30 minutes until a voiding interval of every 3- 4 hours is reached.104  A randomized 
controlled trial of 123 women with mixed urinary incontinence showed a 57% reduction in incontinence 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_49591] a 54% reduction in quantity of urine loss after implementation of a bladder training program.105  
The ICI rated the level of evidence a 1 (based on scant evidence) and the grade of recommendation 
an A for the impact of bladder training  on reduction in urinary incontinence.  
 
5.2.3. What is the evidence for Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT)?  
 A recent Cochrane review titled “Pelvic floor muscle training versus no treatment, or inactive control 
treatments, for urinary incontinence in women” reported on [ADDRESS_482116] 3 month in duration; however the authors recommend additional research to 
support these conclusions.  
 
5.2.4. What is the best approach to PFMT for treatment of urinary incontinence? 
 The same Cochrane review20 above also attempted to separate trials by [CONTACT_385351]: 1) 
Strength 2) Endurance, and/or 3) Coordination (for urgency suppression).  Based on the descriptions of training, two trials had PFMT programs that clearly or predominantly targeted coordination
106 or strength 
training107. Miller and colleagues described a short (one week) program to improve coordination between a 
voluntary pelvic floor muscle contraction (VPFMC) and a rise in intra- abdominal pressure.106 Bø et al 
recommended a program that comprised 8 to 12 high intensity (close to maximal) VPFMC, with six to eight 
second hold and th ree to four fast contractions added at the end of each hold, six second rest between 
contractions three times per day. Exercises were done in different body positions included lying, kneeling, sitting, standing; all with legs apart
107.  
 It was difficult to characterize the other PFMT programs, because they were either a mixed program 
(for example strength and endurance) or had not described a key training parameter (for example amount of 
voluntary effort per contraction). This Cochrane review highlighted some gaps and opportunities for future 
research in this field. Recommendations from the authors included research in which one arm would 
comprise a supervised PFMT program derived from sound exercise science, confirmation of a correct 
voluntary pelvic floor muscle contraction, and incorporate appropriate supervision and adherence measures 
to promote maintenance  of knowledge acquisition. The choice of program would have to be set against the 
resource implications of intensively supervised individual programs and the opportunity cost this represents.  The reporting of formal economic analysis would have to be added to the study.  Careful clinical judgment would be needed about what sort of program could actually be applied in everyday practice and in different 
countries with their different health care delivery systems while still delivering an effective interventi on.  
 A second relevant Cochrane review
108 titled “Comparisons of approaches to pelvi c floor muscle 
training for urinary incontinence in women” also attempted to compare different approaches and/or 
components. These included: 1) differences in training supervision (amount, individual versus group), 2) 
approach (one versus another, the effect of an additional component) and 3) exercise training (type of 
contraction, frequency of training). Overall, the review concluded that there was insufficient evidence 
PFDN Protocol    2-12-[ADDRESS_482117] approach to PFMT; however, more frequent visits resulted in improved subjective 
outcomes (women receiving “regular” supervision were more likely to report improvement compared to little 
or no supervision).  
 
5.3. What is the best “control” group for this study? 
 The team discussed whether  women randomized to the control ar m should receive baseline 
educational materials about behavioral and/or pelvic floor therapy. Educational materials that are routinely 
provided to women with MUI considering treatment options (before deciding on surgery) from each site 
were collected. The majority of sites (7/8) currently provide routine written material to patients on 
Kegel’s/pelvic floor muscle exercises. The majority also routinely provide information on: 1) urge 
suppression/kegel (7/8 sites); caffeine (7/8 sites); other bladder irritant s (5/8 sites), and excessive fluid 
intake (6/8 sites). All sites were in agreement that these are routinely offered to women prior to moving forward with surgical intervention, although not all women choose to use these behavioral strategies.  
 The team con sidered the possibility of providing educational pamphlets to the control group; 
however, the ESTEEM population includes women who have already elected to proceed with surgery. In clinical practice, women who have decided on surgery have already been offer ed other conservative options 
and it is not routine practice to provide pamphlets again about other options at a preoperative visit. 
Therefore, this would not mirror what happens in the “real world”.  
 Because of these reasons, the team agreed the control group in ESTEEM should be MUS only. 
However to balance this, as part of our inclusion crit eria, women will be reminded that BPTx is a treatment 
option for M UI (even outside of the study) to ensure they have been offered behavioral therapy and/or 
physical t herapy  outside of ESTEEM . (See Inclusion Criteria, Section 4.2). Along these lines, women who 
previously tried other behavioral or pelvic therapy will not be excluded. If the patient meets eligibility for 
ESTEEM, she would still have bothersome MUI  by [CONTACT_385352] . If the patient was not aware that 
behavioral/physical therapy was an option, she would be offered a referral at that point for which she can 
either accept (and cancel her surgery), or decline (and still be eligible for ESTEEM). The research 
coordinator will ask this screening question using similar wording that has been used in previous PFDN 
protocols.  
 Although routine educational pamphlets may be provided to subjects prior to their enrollment into 
ESTEEM per usual care at each site,  once enrolled, no additional educational pamphlets may be provided 
to either control or intervention subjects outside of the protocol. The control group will  complete bladder 
diaries and undergo PFM assessments at the same time intervals as the intervention group  to control for 
any potential independent effects that bladder diary completion may have .  
 Rationale for including women who have previously tried behavioral and/or physical therapy:  
 There are many reasons to include women who have previously tried behavioral and/or pelvic floor 
physical therapy. First, women eligible for ESTEEM must have at least moderately bothersome MUI and desire surgery; therefore, even though these women have had treatments in the past , they  did not improve 
enough to forego additi onal treatment. In addition , ESTEEM is evaluating the effect of  combined surgical 
and BPTx treatment and not just BPTx alone. Therefore, women who have previously failed BPTx alone 
in the past may still significantly improve with combined surgical/BPTx treatment or surgery alone and there is no evidence to support their exclusion from this trial. This is the most important reason why these women should be included. Second, many women who have previously tried behavioral and/or physical therapy 
may have had a wide range of non- standardized interventions to varying degrees, durations, and with 
various components. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude that they may be at “higher risk” for failure, or that they will not benefit from the ESTEEM intervention. In ESTEEM, the BPTx protocol is based on existing 
evidence for specific BPTx components and the expertise of interventionists focused solely on improving 
MUI symptoms. This standardized protocol can potentially enhance the surgical effects for women with MUI.  
The protocol does provide the opportunity to identify risk factors for failure of a standardized BPTx 
intervention which will help build additional  evidence for future trials.  
PFDN Protocol    2-12-[ADDRESS_482118] logical  and pragmatic  rationale with a focus on 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a reproducible and standardized  protocol.  
 
 
For the purposes of this proposal “Behavioral training” (BPTx) will include:  
 1. Pelvic floor muscle training 
 2. Urge strategies defined in the field (included in intervention handout)  
 3. Stress strategies defined in the field (included in intervention handout)  
 4. Delayed voiding techniques (included in intervention handout)  
 The intervention will include [ADDRESS_482119]. Patients will be monitored using an adherence questionnaire.  
 
The intervention will be standardized through the following mechanisms:  
a. Certification of all interv entionists  through passing of e- learning modules and attendance and 
demonstration of hands -on skills at a [ADDRESS_482120] been performed 
across subjects  
c. There is a detailed protocol for the PFM exercise progression  
d. There is a detailed protocol for “special circumstances” for when  the standard PFM exercise 
progression protocol cannot be followed (ie: weak muscle) that the interventionist will be required to 
follow 
e. Subject handouts will be developed for the 4 components (PFME, Urge strategies, stress 
strategies, and delayed voiding techniques) and the interventionists will be required to refer only to 
the handouts during the education component  
f. All intervention sessions will be audiotaped and a subset will be audited by [CONTACT_385353]. Any protocol deviations will be addressed as  necessary.  
g. Phone calls between interventionists and behavioral experts will take place as needed to ensure 
adherence to protocol and address any issues and deviations.  
 
 Preliminary data from the OPTIMAL trial suggest that perioperative BPTx was not ef fective for 
improving urinary, prolapse, or colorectal symptoms at 6 months  (unpublished data) ; however , the study 
population in OPTIMAL is significantly different from ESTEEM . Regarding baseline urinary symptoms, 
subjects in OPTIMAL were required to have an affirmative response to one SUI item  only on the UDI 
whereas subjects in ESTEEM will be required to have an affirmative response to both  the SUI and UUI 
items on the UDI and these symptoms must be at least  moderately bothersome. Only 40% of women in the  
OPTIMAL trial reported mixed UI. In addition, all women in OPTIMAL had at least stage [ADDRESS_482121] of MUS and BPTx is designed as a treatment  intervention in ESTEEM. For all of these

Version 2.0 reasons, we believe that the early findings from OPTIMAL do not directly address the aims proposed in 
ESTEEM and are not applicable to a MUI population.      
 The intervention in ESTEEM has been designed to focus on SUI and UUI symptoms and includes 
only components that address these 2 symptom constellations.  Differences between the ATLAS, OPTIMAL

5.5.1. Baseline Procedures  
 In addition to information collected to determine eligibility and standardized questionnaires, the 
following information wi ll be obtained for all randomized patients by [CONTACT_385354]:  
a. Demographic information: age, race, ethnicity, insurance status, education 
b. Medical history: vaginal parity, comorbidities, height, weight, prior pelvic surgeries, medications, estrogen 
status, previous treatments for pelvic floor disorders  
c. Social history: tobacco use  
d. Pelvic, rectal exam, neurological examination, POP -Q, PFM strength (collectively will include Brink and 
Peritron measurement), post -void residual, urinary  stress test  
e. Standardized urodynamic evaluation (UDE) will be performed preoperatively –  There continues to be 
controversy regarding the usefulness of UDE for preoperative evaluation of SUI. However, it is often 
recommended in women who have a “mixed”  UI pi[INVESTIGATOR_385309]. Therefore, the protocol team agreed that patients in ESTEEM should undergo UDE testing, primarily to allow evaluation of 
variables that may predict clinical outcome. Because eligibility includes women electing surgery, and 
because this is a complex population, many patients may already have UDE results  prior to enrollment. For 
those women who have not, they wil l undergo testing preoperatively, although there are no specific UDE 
parameters that determine eligibility for this trial.  Urodynamic tests performed within the past 18 months  will 
be allowed.

6. Statistical considerations  
6.1. Sample size estimates  
6.1.1. Primary aim and secondary aims:  
This study is designed to compare the efficacy of MUS+BPTx versus MUS alone on improving MUI 
symptom outcomes.  Because OAB and SUI symptoms are highly important secondary outcomes as stated 
previously, we felt strongly that our sample size should provide adequate power to detect differences for the 
separate UDI -irritative and UDI -stress subscales in addition to the UDI total score. Our initial sample size 
estimates were based on published MIDs for the UDI total score and subscales; however, we recognize that 
the populations on which those MIDs were based might differ from the target population for ESTEEM. A 
secondary aim of ESTEEM is to estimate the MIDs for UDI scores in this study population, and it is possible 
that the MIDs in this population could be smaller than values previously published, particularly for the UDI 
total score. Thus, our goal was to power the s tudy to detect a statistically significant difference between 
groups in change from baseline in UDI total score at 1 year that was smaller than the published MID but still in a range of what we think may be a clinically important difference in our populati on.  
Sample size estimates are based on simulations using analysis methods accounting for both the 
rate of additional treatment in the two groups as well as UDI total score or subscore values over the 12 month follow up period (refer to the statistical analysis plan for details). We assumed that 30% of women in 
the MUS only group and 20% of women in the MUS+BPTx group would request additional treatment. In 
TOMUS, 10 -12% of women who had baseline MUI had persistent UUI postoperatively based on MESA 
responses  and/or initiation of anticholinergic treatment.
24 In Barber’s TVT vs TOT equivalence trial, 70% 
reported baseline MUI and postoperatively, 30% of all women reported bothersome UUI with 16% of subjects on anticholinergic treatment postoperatively.
31 In Abdel -Fattah’s transobturat or MUS trial, 25% 
reported worsening OAB and almost all of these women were on anticholinergic treatment postoperatively.34 
In Palva’s TVT vs TVT -O trial, 174 women reported preoperative UUI and of these, 7 women (4%) had tried 
anticholinergics postoperatively after 3 years. Therefore, based on existing MUS trials, the rate of additional 
treatment for OAB ranges from 4- 25%, supporting our conservative assumption that 30% of women will 
request additional treatment in the MUS only group.  
 
i. Primary outcome:  MUI symptoms = UDI -total score  
 
 The MID for the UDI -total score published by [CONTACT_385355] 35 points.50 Assuming a 
two-sided alpha of .05, SD of 50.4, and tr ue difference in mean change from baseline in UDI -total scores at 
1 year between treatment groups of 35, 75 women per group would provide 90% power to detect a statistically significant difference between groups.  
 ii. Secondary outcome:  OAB symptoms= UDI -irritative subscale: For the UDI -irritative subscale, the 
published MID estimate is 15 points.
50 Assuming a two- sided alpha of 0.05, SD of 25.6, and true difference 
in mean change from baseline in UDI -irritative scor es at 1 year between treatment groups of 15, 92 women 
per group would provide 90% power.  
iii. Secondary outcome:  SUI symptoms = UDI -stress subscale: For the UDI -stress subscale, the 
published MID is 8 points.51 Assuming a two -sided alpha of 0.05, SD of 21.5, and true difference  in mean 
change from baseline in UDI -stress scores at 1 year  between treatment groups of 8, 200 women per group 
would provide 90% power to detect a statistically significant difference between groups.  
 
Using 200 per group as our base estimate and adjusting for 15% dropout post -operatively result s in 
a total sample size of 472 randomized to treatment.  
Additionally, this sample size will provide approximately 90% power to detect a difference as small 
as 19 between treatment groups for the UDI -total score, and a difference as small as 16.5 points w ith 80% 
power.

Version 2.0   
6.1.2. Potential limitations of the UDI and primary outcome:  
 One potential limitation of using change from baseline score as the primary outcome is that point 
estimates of the difference in means between 2 groups may mask important changes for individual patients 
that are meaningful. However, this would also be the case if we dichotomized the outcome into “success” 
versus “failure”.  In addition, the published MID used for our primary outcome is derived from the BE -DRI 
population, an urge -predominant MUI population and MID estimates can vary depending on the study 
population. The published estimate for UDI -total MID for the BE -DRI urge -predominant population is 35 
points based on Dyer et al50 whereas  Barber et al found the MID for pure stress/stress -predominant 
population to be 11 points in the ATLAS population.51 One advantage of the BE -DRI population is that 96% 
had MUI, which is more similar to the anticipated ESTEEM population. It is possible that women with UUI 
require larger improvements compared to pure/SU I predominant women to be meaningful. This is 
consistent with many previous studies showing that women with UUI experience worse impact and bother than SUI patients and that the UUI component drives patient perception of severity and satisfaction after 
treatment.  
 Although we do not definitively know whether [ADDRESS_482125] applicable to our target population. In  addition, because our total sample size is 400 subjects (before 
adjustment for drop out), our study will have 90% power to detect a statistically significant difference in UDI -
total scores if the true difference is as small as 19 points between groups and 80% power to detect a 
difference if the true difference is as small as 16.5 points. This difference is smaller than the conservative, 
distribution- based MID estimate of -24.8 based on the BE -DRI population. Thus, the planned sample size 
will allow for ana lyses to assess whether the true MID in this population is smaller than 35.  
 Finally, the UDI total score includes 3 subscales: stress, irritative and obstructive. Therefore, our 
primary outcome will include a total score combining all 3 of these subscales. We believe the inclusion of 
the obstructive subscale is appropriate for the following reasons:  
 1. Although obstructive symptoms related to prolapse are not a focus of ESTEEM, some items in 
this subscale may still be relevant to the MUI population (ie: “general urine leakage not related to urge or 
activity”; symptoms of “difficulty emptying”; and “incomplete emptying”).  
 2. Because women with symptomatic prolapse will be excluded in both groups, it is unlikely that the 
inclusion of this subscale in the primary outcome will lead to bias.  
 3. The published MID for the UDI in the BE -DRI population also includes all 3 subscales for an urge -
predominant MUI population.
50 
 
6.1.3. Management of women who drop out prior t o receiving MUS  
 It is possible that some women in both groups may cancel their surgical MUS procedure due to 
personal reasons, or other. It is also possible that women randomized to BPTx may cancel their surgical 
procedure if they receive preoperative BPTx treatment and experience improvement. These women will still 
be included from an ITT perspective.  
6.2. Statistical analysis plan 
 
6.2.1. Primary aim  
The mean change from baseline in UDI scores will be compared between groups at 1 year. As 
explained prev iously, participants will be permitted to seek additional treatment for SUI and/or OAB after [ADDRESS_482126] the participant’s UDI score at [ADDRESS_482127] results to model specifications.  
We will report whether change in total UDI score between baseline and one year is significantly 
different in the two groups. If the difference is statistically significant, the potential clinical significance of the 
difference will be discussed. We recognize that our sample size would allow us to find a difference between 
groups that is statistically significant yet smaller than published MIDs for total UDI score for women with 
MUI. However, published MIDs were calculated based on populations that may be somewhat different from 
the one targeted for enrollment in ESTEEM, and a secondary aim of ESTEEM is to explore whether the true 
MID in this population differs from previously published values.  
 
6.2.2. Secondary aims  
 The mean change from baseline in UDI -irritative and UDI -stress scores at 1 year will be compared 
between groups using the same analysis methods described for the primary outcome.  If the difference is 
statistically significant, the potential clinical significance of the difference will be discussed.  Additional 
analyses will be conducted to determine whether the MIDs in this MUI population differ from previously 
published MIDs . 
 
6.2.3. Exploratory aims  
a.  Other UUI/OAB outcomes  
Bladder diary  
 We will compare change in number of urge IEs and urgency -epi[INVESTIGATOR_385310] 6 and 12 months . Of note, not all four symptoms of OAB (frequency, 
urgency, nocturia, and UUI) are required to be present at baseline for eligibility into this trial (only UUI 
required).  Changes fr om baseline in bladder diary outcomes will be calculated and analyzed using the 
methods described for the analysis of the primary outcome.  
 For urinary frequency, women reporting on average >8 voids/24 hours at baseline will be considered 
symptomatic, and normalization of voiding frequency will be defined as < 8 voids/24 hours at 1 year. A 50% 
improvement will be defined as a reduction by [CONTACT_385356].  The 
number of women who had normalization of voiding frequency and 50% improvement will be compared 
between groups separately and collectively. We will also assess the proportion of women who had 
worsening of urinary frequency (includes women who developed de novo frequency and those who 
worsened). These dichotomous outcomes will be analyzed using logistic regression, controlling for the 
design effects of stratification by [CONTACT_385357]. To assess the impact of additional 
treatment prior to [ADDRESS_482128] is not sustained at the 12 month t ime point?  For example, 
if BPTx could delay the need for anti -muscarinics for up to 9 months, this would be relevant information for 
counseling women and perhaps clinically recommending perioperative BPTx. As described previously, 
failure will be defined as initiation of any additional treatment  for either SUI or UUI/OAB symptoms . 
 A class of survival model which can account for interval censoring (outcomes measured at pre -
planned time points as opposed to continuously over time) will be used to determine if combined MUS+BPTx is associated with a decrease time to failure compared to MUS alone between 3- [ADDRESS_482129] additional treatment prior to 1 
year will not be included in the predictive models. Potential predictors will include age, diary parameters such as number of UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]/[ADDRESS_482130] ional bladder capacity, bother severity at baseline. The 
relationship between potential predictors and outcomes will be explored in models that include one predictor 
plus stratification factors (center and baseline urge IE group). Predictive models will be constructed using 
backward selection of predictors. The impact of col linearity between predictors will be assessed and the 
final model modified as necessary.  
   
d. Quality of life/global impression  
For these scales and associated subscales, differences fr om baseline will be calculated and 
methods described for analysis of the primary outcome will be used to test for differences between treatment groups  from baseline and 6 and 12 months .  
 
e. To describe safety and initiation of additional treatment for wor sening OAB and/or persistent SUI  
 We will describe rates of sling revision due to worsening OAB symptoms and rates of additional 
treatment.  
 f. To determine MIDs and clinically meaningful MUI definitions that predict clinical outcomes.    
                We will explore potential MIDs for UDI total score and stress and irritative subscores for this MUI 
population. MIDs will be calculated using anchor - and distribution- based approaches. Potential anchors 
include global impression of change, incontinence epis odes from the bladder diary, and request for 
additional treatment.  
We will attempt to create threshold definitions, based on baseline measures of the UDI, IIQ, OAB -q, 
UDE, and baseline bladder diary parameters in isolation and in combination, that are predictive of clinical success at [ADDRESS_482131] as large as the MID for this MUI population.  
 g. To compare pelvic floor muscle strength changes between women randomized to combined MUS+BPTx 
versus MUS alone, to estimate associations between pelvic floor muscle strength improvement and UI symptoms, and to identify predictors of unsuccessful pelvic floor muscle strengthening and urge 
suppression and their effects on urinary outcomes in women randomized to BPTx  
 As mentioned above, all women will undergo PFM strength measurements using the Peritron device 
by [CONTACT_385358], postoperative at 2 weeks, 8 weeks (end of interv ention), and 12 
months (primary endpoint). The difference in the maximum pelvic floor muscle contraction pressure (maximum amplitude) will be compared between the BPTx and the control groups. A table of comparative 
PFDN Protocol    2-12-[ADDRESS_482132] a mean baseline PFM maximum contraction amplitude 
of 25 cm H2O, and that women randomized to control will not demonstrate significant improvement 
postoperatively (no change from mean maximum amplitude of 25 cm H2O (SD 13), and tha t  women 
randomized to BPTx will demonstrate improvement to 35 (SD 13) to 40 (SD 16) cm H2O at 6- [ADDRESS_482133] a difference between the groups with the current ESTEEM sample size of 400 women 
would be greater than 0.99.  Also, the difference from 25 (SD 13) that we could detect with 80% power is 
3.66 cm H2O between groups and with 90% power we could detect a difference as small as 4.23 cm H2O.  
 For analyses, we will compare the mean change from baseline in PFM maximum contraction 
strength between the BPTx and control groups at 8 weeks and at 12 months. General linear mixed 
modeling will be used, controlling for stratification factors  and time ( 8 weeks and 12 months ). We will test 
whether there is significant interaction between treatment gr oup and time.  Because additional treatment is 
not expected to impact this outcome, it will be ignored for the purpose of this analysis. We will estimate the 
correlation between PFM strength and UI symptoms at baseline and at [ADDRESS_482134] of self -efficacy
114, 115, 
adherence, and barriers to performing pelvic muscle contractions and behavioral therapy.

Differential mean costs and differential mean QALYs between the two treatment groups will be 
estimated using multiple regression analysis. Specifically, a generalized linear model w ith appropriate link 
function (e.g., log- link) and response probability distribution (e.g., gamma distribution) will be used to 
analyze costs due to the potential skewness and heteroscedasticity of medical expenditure data, while an ordinary least squares regression will be used for analyzing QALY data. The models will account for 
treatment group, study site and stratification factors, as well as other characteristics of the subjects that are 
found to differ significantly between the groups. When estimating QALYs, we will also adjust for subjects’ 
baseline utility scores to account for potential imbalance in baseline utility between the two treatment groups.
[ADDRESS_482139] -effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is the differential mean costs 
divided by [CONTACT_385360], to assess the additional costs associated 
with each additional QALY gained. Our base case analysis will be conducted based on subjects with 
complete data. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to include subjects with incomplete data using the 
multiple imputation method.  Non -parametric bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_67265] 
95% confidence interval for the ICER.118, [ADDRESS_482140] -effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) will 
be generated to illustrate the likelihood that one treatment is more cost -effective than the other with various 
ceiling cost -effectiveness ratios.  
In the case that a statistically significant difference in changes in utilities (as measured by [CONTACT_28973] -5D) 
between the treatment groups is not detected, we plan to conduct supplemental analyses using alternative 
PFDN Protocol    2-12-[ADDRESS_482141] -effectiveness ratio over a 
lifetime; assuming an average life expectancy, given the average age of participants at the time of the 
intervention.  
 
6.3. Interim data monitoring 
 Safety outcomes will be assessed at each DSMB meeting. This will inc lude the need for sling 
revision due to worsening OAB symptoms. Rates of sling revision and other safety outcomes will be compared between treatment groups using Fisher’s exact tests and provided to the DSMB. There is no 
established guidance regarding what  sling revision rate is “appropriate” for worsening OAB symptoms in this 
population: this is one of the exploratory aims of this study.   
Since we expect to enroll ESTEEM within [ADDRESS_482142] been attained for all participants.  At 
each meeting, the DSMB will be presented with information abou t enrollment and outcome data attainment 
(for example, the percent of expected clinic visits that have been completed) to allow them to determine that the study is making reasonable progress.  
 
7. Ethical Concerns/Safety  
7.1. Ethical Concerns  
 
As discussed in the background section, current clinical practice varies with respect to treatment of MUI and 
likely reflects training and experiential bias.  Although treatment with behavioral modifications and Kegel exercises have been described as effective first li ne treatments for mild stress, urge, and mixed urinary 
incontinence, many patients go on to request further therapy for their condition.  For moderate symptoms of SUI or UUI additional therapeutic options are generally offered based on treatment paradigms geared 
toward each of these conditions.  When patients have MUI, clinicians must decide which component (the 
SUI or the UUI) should be addressed first.  There is very little evidence to support a defined treatment 
strategy in this patient population and most recommendations are based on expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  The only way to 
test the superiority of one approach over another is in the setting of a randomized clinical trial.  We have 
carefully designed this trial to balance the risks and benefits to subjects. All patients in this study have 
elected to undergo surgery for SUI.  Therefore, they will have already been offered more conservative 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. We will be assured that women will have either previously tried behavioral or pelvic floor therapy 
or at least have been offered this treatment because it is an inclusion criteria. In addition all patients will be 
treated with a midurethral sling and half the patients will be randomized to perioperative supervised BPTx. 
The potential benefits of the BPTx intervention ar e improvement of MUI symptoms while the risks are very 
small.  The benefits of BPTx in SUI and UUI alone and MUI have been documented as has the benefit of 
MUS for patients with SUI.  Several studies have also documented an improvement in OAB and MUI 
sympt oms following sling.  The added benefit of a combined approach of sling plus BPTx in patients with 
MUI has not been defined and is the subject of this RCT.  Any subject can request additional treatment after 
[ADDRESS_482143] (DSMB) to oversee all PFDN 
studies, including this study.  Members of the DSMB are independent of the study investigators and 
represent Urology, Urogynecology and Biostatistics, as well as having a lay member. The DSMB meets 
every 3 months, or more frequently if requested by [CONTACT_21003], either in person or by [CONTACT_577].  This 
protocol has been approved by [CONTACT_385361]. Safety outcomes will be assessed in a 
descriptive manner at each DSMB meeting without formal statistical tests. This will include the need for sling revision due to worsening OAB symptoms. There is no established stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_385311] “appropriate” for worsening OAB symptoms in this population.  
 
7.4. Reporting of serious adverse events  
Each clinical investigator is responsible for reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) to the IRB per their IRB 
guidelines at their institu tion, and to the DCC. The DCC Safety Specialist reviews and summarizes the SAE 
per DCC SAE reporting procedures for the PFDN.  
7.5. Adverse events  
Adverse events are defined as untoward medical events that are temporally -related to participation 
in a clinical study, regardless of whether they are causally -related to the study. Adverse events will be 
collected during the course of this study and reported to the DSMB as described above.  
Sling surgery is a commonly performed operation for the treatment of SUI  and MUI.  Like all surgical 
interventions it has the risk of bleeding, infection, and injury to surrounding structures.  In addition, the sling 
procedure utilizes polypropylene mesh which can introduce additional risk of mesh complication.  These 
include vaginal mesh extrusion, mesh infection, and bladder or urethral mesh erosion.  Complications 
specific to sling placement include bladder perforation, retropubic hematoma, obturator nerve or vessel 
injury, groin pain, worsening incontinence, and worsening O AB.  The FDA has recently issued guidelines on 
the use of surgical mesh and has recommended it only be used by [CONTACT_307556].  All surgeons 
participating in this study will be specifically trained to use surgical mesh.  
 
8. Feasibility  
 The proposed study population has already chosen to undergo surgical treatment and the BPTx 
intervention is low risk. We have taken care to have comparable arms in a clinical efficacy trial design with 
inclusion criteria that are not overly -strict; therefore, we do not ant icipate particular difficulty in recruitment of 
MUI patients as encountered in MIMOSA.37 If needed in the postoperative period, medical therapy will not 
be withheld after 3 months postoperative. Women reporting bothersome OAB symptoms for which they 
desire additional treatment will be presented their options (additional BPTx and/or FDA approved OAB 
pharmacologic therapy , or other procedures or surgeries ), and additional treatment will be offered. Request 
for additional treatment for either OAB or SUI postoperatively will be driven by [CONTACT_385362].

midurethral sling surgery randomized to behavioral therapy or no behavioral therapy ( GloW ) 
 
Patient reported outcome (PRO) measures are of critical importance in the evaluation of functional 
disorders because anatomical and physi ologic tests do not precisely correlate with patient experience. 
Symptom severity and quality of life questionnaires partly fill this gap. The Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI), a measure of pelvic floor symptoms, the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ ) and the Pelvic Organ 
Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220]), measures of health related quality of life, are 
commonly used symptom and quality of life questionnaires. Within the PFDN, these questionnaires are 
used in conjunction with physical exam and physiologic testing to measure disease burden and to assess 
cure. While these questionnaires characterize the severity of symptoms and their impact on quality of life, 
they do not rank symptom importance nor do they provide an individualiz ed blueprint of what women hope 
to achieve with treatment. More recently, goal attainment scaling (GAS) has emerged as an established 
methodology of determining individual women’s goals and whether or not they meet personalized goals 
following treatment.  
 
In goal attainment scaling, patients are asked to list goals and rank their importance; following treatment, 
women rate whether or not the goal was achieved. Patient -identified goals have been described as the 
“fourth dimension” of pelvic floor disorder assessment, after physical findings, symptoms, and quality of life. 
(Lowenstein, 2008)  Individualized goals are not adequately captured by [CONTACT_385364]. For example, among a group of 200 women seeking care for pel vic floor 
dysfunction, continence goals were ranked more highly than resolution of bulge symptoms, despi[INVESTIGATOR_385314] (Stage 3) prolapse on exam and bother reported on the PFDI.(Elkardy, 2013) In a 
UITN randomized trial with standardized video consent (SIStr), women undergoing SUI surgery had high 
expectations for treatment of not only SUI symptoms, but also for treatment of their urgency and frequency, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_385315] (MUS)  was not designed to resol ve their urgency 
symptoms, documentation of stress incontinence on urodynamics and bother and quality of life changes 
consistent with SUI reported on the PFDI and PFIQ.(Mallett, 2008) Among women with a variety of pelvic 
floor disorders, patient goals and expectations vary and are linked to treatment satisfaction.
 (Elkardy, 2003; 
Hullfish 2004; Komesu 2008) Conversely, unmet goals are closely associated with patient dissatisfaction 
after treatment. (Elkardy, 2003; Hullfish 2004; Komesu 2008) Despi[INVESTIGATOR_385316], prior goal attainment scaling studies in urogynecology are limited by [CONTACT_385365], lack of assessment of the difference between short and 
long term goals, and have not consistently followed women after treatment to determine whether their goals are achieved. A key gap in our understanding of mixed urinary incontinence and women’s 
expectations following treatment is accurate goal characterization and det ermination of whether or 
not goals are attained in the short and long term following treatment.  ESTEEM provides an ideal study 
setting in which to answer this question.  
 
ESTEEM will compare the effect of peri -operative behavioral/pelvic floor therapy (BPTx ) plus MUS to 
MUS alone on MUI treatment in 472 women. This trial  provides an ideal setting in which to describe 
individualized goals for MUI treatment as well as the importance of goal attainment on women’s impression 
of cure . This, in turn, will enable providers to ultimately negotiate expectations so that providers and patients 
have better communication regarding the benefits and limitations of various treatments for mixed urinary incontinence. The long- term goal  of this supplementary study to ESTEEM is to better understand patient 
expectations following treatment for MUI  in order to provide patients and providers an informed platform 
for discussion of treatment options and realistic outcome expectations . The objectives  of this proposal  
are to describe patient centered goals among a group of women with MUI undergoing midurethral sling 
surgery with and without BPTx as well as determine whether or not these goals were met following 
treatment using the validated Self-Assessment Goal Achievement (SAGA) questionnaire. Our expectation 
is that a better understanding of individualized patient goals will improve patient -provider communication, 
PFDN Protocol    2-12-[ADDRESS_482164] 
symptom severity and quality of life measures.  
Aim 1 : To describe patient reported goals and goal  ranking among women consenting to  ESTEEM . We 
hypothesize that women’s goals vary and are not currently captured by [CONTACT_385366] . 
Aim 2:  To determine whether or not women achieve self -reported goals following treatment for MUI and 
to compare those who achieve their goals to those who do not in both the intermediate (6 months) and 
longer term (12 months) . We hypothesize  that women who report and rank continence related goals are 
more likely to achieve those goals than goals related to general health and specific activities and that goal  
achievement is related to patient’s PGI -I scores.  
Significance:  PROs are critical to the assessment of pelvic floor dysfunction, yet standardized measures of 
symptom severity and quality of life may not capture an individual women’s motivation and expectations for seeking treatment. Goal attainment scaling is an established methodology of describing and ranking 
individual goals and has been used in a variety of fields including treatment of pelvic floor 
dysfunction.(Khuller, 2013) Goal attainment scaling offers unique insight into individual concerns regarding 
common disorders, such as MUI. While it is known that the impact of pelv ic floor dysfunction varies between 
individuals with similar physiologic measures of disease, the underpi[INVESTIGATOR_385317]. In addition, patient expectations are likely 
to drive care seeking as well as adherence to treatment regimens and are, in turn, correlated with 
satisfaction with those treatment outcomes. MUI is a common disorder with lack of consensus regarding treatment; ESTEEM will test whether or not BPTx is beneficial prior to and following sling surgery. A key 
aspect of understanding women’s satisfaction with these treatment options is determining the importance of 
various lower urinary tract symptoms to individuals and what individualized goals women have fo r 
treatment.  
 
Innovation:  Mixed urinary incontinence is bothersome to women and often presents a treatment 
conundrum to providers. The symptom of urinary leakage is what concerns the patient most, yet the etiology of the UUI and SUI are thought to be diff erent and the treatments for one may lead to exacerbation of the 
other. While ESTEEM will measure symptom severity and quality of life for both SUI and UUI symptoms, currently the protocol does not contain a measure of the importance of alleviating specifi c symptoms to 
individual women. In addition, women participating in the trial likely have unique goals and concerns not 
currently captured with standard symptom severity and quality of life measures presently included in this 
study. Inclusion of the SAGA questionnaire at baseline, six months and one year after MUS with or without 
BPTx will offer the PFDN the opportunity to characterize treatment goals in a large number of women with 
MUI undergoing MUS surgery and assess whether or not those goals are achiev ed. While goal attainment 
scaling is an established method of assessing individual goals, until recently, a standardized and valid 
measure of assessing goals was not available. The SAGA questionnaire has been validated among women 
with lower urinary tract symptoms and fills that void.(Brubaker, 2013) SAGA consists of nine standardized 
goals regarding urinary symptoms, and asks women to rate the importance of these standardized goals on 
a scale from 0 (not applicable) to 5 (very important goal). In addition to these common goals, women are 
asked to record up to five of their individualized goals and rank them in a similar fashion. At follow -up 
following treatment, women are asked to rate whether or not they achieved their goals on a scale from 1 
(did not achi eve goal) to 5 (greatly exceeded goal). Importantly, the common goal list of [ADDRESS_482165] been 
determined in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 104 subjects and re- evaluated on an international basis in an additional 29 
subjects. Reliability and internal consistency testing was not performed because goals were assumed to vary between individuals. This proposal is innovative, in our opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], because it will assess goal setting 
using a newly validated questionnaire in a large group of women with MUI, a common condition which is 
difficult for patients to understand and for pro viders to explain, and will determine whether goal attainment is 
linked to patient global impression of improvement both in the short and long term.   Finally,  this innovative 
proposal offers the PFDN the opportunity to add an translational aim to ESTEEM by  [CONTACT_385367]    2-12-14

science of a comparative effectiveness trial to individual patients seeking care.  This ultimately may inform 
community dwelling women’s decisions to pursue or not to pursue care.  
 
Approach:  
Aim 1 : To describe patient reported goals and ranking of goals among women consenting for ESTEEM . We 
hypothesize that women’s goals vary and are not currently captured by [CONTACT_385366] . 
 
Introduction:  Assessment of individualized patient goals offers a unique perspecti ve of expectations and 
goals with treatment that current PROs do not capture.  The objective of this aim is to administer the SAGA 
questionnaire at women’s baseline visit in ESTEEM and to describe their ranking of the nine standardized 
questions in SAGA. In  addition, women will be asked to list up to five individualized goals for treatment and 
also rank their importance.  Our working hypothesis  is that the importance of the [ADDRESS_482166] a variety of individual goals which are 
not presently represented by [CONTACT_385368].  We will achieve this aim  by 
[CONTACT_385369].  Our expectation  is that 
the description of baseline goals of women recruited to ESTEEM will offer insight into what women are 
seeking with treatment for their MUI . 
 
Methods:  Women will be administered the baseline set of nine pre- specified goals as well as be asked to 
list up to  5 individual goals for their therapy. Goals will be ranked on a 6 point scale from 0 -Not applicable to 
5 – very important goal. In the original validation study of the SAGA, women randomly completed either the 
pre-specified or self -specified goals first.  No order effects were noted in the numbers of goals listed or 
ranking of nine pre- specified goals. For this study, women  
will complete the nine pre- specified goals  
followed by [CONTACT_385370]. Individualized goals will be transcribed and 
entered into the patient database; these goals 
will then be presented to the patient in follow -
up assessment of goal achievement in Aim #2. 
Table 1 is the SAGA questionnaire.  
 
Aim #1 is descriptive in nature therefore the 
analyses are qualitative versus quantitative. 
For self -selected goals, goals will be classified 
by [CONTACT_385371].  
The working group will review the goals in 
order to generate categories; goals will be 
categorized and then compared across 
individual categorization.  Development of 
categories and categorization will be by 
[CONTACT_21128]. For the analysis of ranking, each 
subject’s goal ‘selection’ will be ranked with #[ADDRESS_482167] choice, #2 for their 2nd choice and #[ADDRESS_482168] value to any goal subdomain identified in the entire 
population but not listed for a particular individual. A preferential ballot is used in political elections, but can also be used to prioritize preferences across individuals and is referred to as a “Borda count”.  Originally 
designed for political elections when there were multiple candidates on a ballot, Borda counts determine the Table 1: Self-Assessment Goal Achievement

PFDN Protocol    2-12-14 
ESTEEM

Version 2.0 “winner” of a ball ot by [CONTACT_385372]. Once all votes have been counted, the candidate with the most points is 
the winner. In our analysis, a modified Borda  preferential ballot consists of candidates (here, the list of goal 
subdomains) and a ballot for each participant, in which a rank of 1 is assigned for the participant’s highest 
ranked goal, a rank of [ADDRESS_482169] ranked goal, and so on. If a participant  doesn’t rank all of 
the candidates (goal subdomains), then the mid- rank of the un- used ranks are assigned –  this assures each 
ballot receives equal weight in the ballot count. The derivation of mid- rank was calculated by [CONTACT_385373]. The first winner is based in lowest average 
rank across all ballots, the second winner is based in second lowest average rank, and so on. The analysis 
of ballots can be done simply by [CONTACT_385374].  
 
Since this aim is qualitative in nature a formal power analysis was not computed; given the number of 
women who will be recruited to ESTEEM, we should have more than enough subjects to reach saturation 
on goal categor ies and to evaluated even small difference between goal rankings.  
 
Potential Problems and Solutions: It may be that women have difficulty in generating individualized goals, 
although prior research has documented that women, on average, do not have difficulty generating up to [ADDRESS_482170] what they wish to achieve with their treatment; this will be done without prompting for specific goals to 
avoid bias.  
 
Aim 2:  To determine whether or not women achieve self -reported goals following treatment for MUI . We 
hypothesize that women who report and rank specific continence related goals are more likely to achieve 
those goals than goals related to general healt h and specific activities and that achievement of these goals 
will be related to patient’s PGI -I scores. In addition, we hypothesize that women whose goals are achieved 
will report better global improvement in continence and quality of life than women who do not achieve their 
goals.  
  
 Introduction:  Achievement of patient goals offers a unique perspective of patient’s assessment of 
outcome of treatment.  The objective of this aim is to administer the SAGA follow -up goal achievement 
questionnaire at women’s f ollow- up visits in ESTEEM at 6 and 2 months.  We will describe women’s goal 
achievement and compare which goal categories are more likely to be achieved.  In addition, we will 
correlate goal achievement with PGI -I scores to further evaluate which goals are best correlated with 
patient’s global impression of improvement. Finally, we will observe whether goal achievement is stable between 6 and 12 months by [CONTACT_385375]. Our working hypothesis  
is that goal achievement vari es between individuals and that women who rank continence goals will be 
more likely to achieve those goals than goals not related to continence.  In addition we hypothesize that 
goal achievement changes over time and that more women will achieve goals at 6  months than do at one 
year.  Finally, we hypothesize that goal achievement will be significantly correlated with PGI -I scores.  We 
will achieve this aim  by [CONTACT_385376] -up questionnaire at 6 months and one year in 
women recruited to ESTEEM . Our expectation is that goal achievement varies over time and between 
individuals based on baseline goal setting and treatment efficacy . 
 
Methods:  Women will be administered the follow -up SAGA questionnaire at [ADDRESS_482171] of the patient’s self -determined goals established at baseline.  
The response categories for follow -up are 1 (did not achieve goal) to 5 (greatly exceeded goal).  The 
number of goals for each patient will vary as women may report less that [ADDRESS_482172] ranked some of the nine pre- specified goals as “not -applicable” at baseline.   
 
Again a Borda count system will be used to rank in this cohort goals and goal categories that were most 
likely to be achieved and we will describe the goals that were more likely to be achieved in this cohort at 6

Version 2.0 months and one year.  In the original validation study, a cut off T score of > 50 was determined to indicate 
women who achieved their goals, versus women who scored </= 50 who did not achieve goals according to 
the formula provided by [CONTACT_385377] (T -scores with mean = 50 and SD = 10). (Kiresuk, 1968) 
Weights will be applied to women’s individualized goal achievement ratings. We will compare women who 
achieve goals to those who do not at 6 and 12 months to determine both if there are baseline differences 
between those women who achieve goals and do  not, and if there is a different pattern of goal attainment at 
short term (6 months) and longer term (12 month) follow up.  
 
Potential problems and Strategies to overcome them: It is possible that women will rank goal attainment 
highly for all listed goals  and that there will not be differences noted between continence goals and self 
stated goals.  In this instance the data generated are still valuable because the negative findings are 
informative to the counseling of patients.

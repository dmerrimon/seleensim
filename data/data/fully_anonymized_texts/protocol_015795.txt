improvement of 10% at 1 year. (1, 2) Median survival, BSC vs. chemo: 4 vs 8+ mont hs, 
respectively. (3) Median survival now is 12+ months in more recent trials of VEGF targeted 
therapy plus platinum doublet. (4) Quality of life benefit was also observed with chemotherapy. 
(5)  First-line chemotherapy for unselected stage IV NSCLC is a p latinum doublet as the standard 
platform.  Combining taxanes with other chemotherapeutic agents has been reported to have high 
activity and to be tolerable.  Platinum doublets resulted in 2 year Survival of 15 -20%. (6) Scagliotti 
observed a survival advant age selecting doublet chemotherapy based on tumor histology. Using a 
platinum based doublet, the author observed 2 month longer median overall survival for 
adenocarcinoma treated with pemetrexed and 1 month longer for squamous cell carcinoma treated 
with g emcitabine. (7) Molecular targeted agents added to platinum doublet chemotherapy can also 
improve survival.  Anti -VEGF monoclonal antibody,  Bevacizumab , added  to platinum and 
paclitaxel improved overall survival in adenocarcinoma subset with stage IV disea se. (8) Selection 
of targeted agents where target is known can replace first -line chemotherapy (EGFR -TKIs in 
EGFR mutants; ALK fusion mutants treated with MEK TKIs). (9, 10) Identifying  better 
biomarkers will lead to better targeting.

months, for the concurrent sequence. ( 31, 32) . 
 
 
Final publication by [CONTACT_665462] (irPFS) significantly improved using the 
phased regimen compared with the control regimen (HR, 0.72; P = .05), whereas the concurrent 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665268] (HR, 0.81; P = .13). As assessed by  [CONTACT_128636], there was also an improvement in PFS, relative to the control, for phased ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (HR, 
0.69; P = .02) but not for concurrent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (HR, 0.88; P = .25). The median mWHO -PFS was 
4.2 months for the control group, 5.1 months for the phas ed ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102315], and 4.1 months for 
the concurrent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102315]. Similarly,  improved median overall survival for the phased 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665269] 12.2 months, and increase of 3.9 months over the median of 8.3 months for 
the control group (HR, 0.87;  P = .23). the median overall survival of 9.7 months for the concurrent 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665270] (HR, 0.99; P = .48).  Hematologic and 
nonhematologic toxicities were similar between control arm [Paclitaxel and Carboplatin] 
compared to phased arm [Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], Paclitaxel, Carboplatin]; and toxicities were typi[INVESTIGATOR_665271]. Specifically, toxicities observed as Grade 1 -2 
occuring > 30% in descending order (control, phased arm): anemia 8 9,92; alopecia 46,45; 
thrombocytopenia 35, 43; neutropenia 32,34; diarrhea 31,31; AST elevation 32,31; ALT 
elevation 35,29.  Observed Grade 3 -4 toxicities were infrequent, interestingly they more frequent  
in the control than phased arm,  less than 9% and 6%, respectively.  (59) 
 
 
1.2  Early Stage Lung Cancer  
 
1.2.1  Early Stage and Surgery  
The natural history of clinically staged (stage I and stage II) non-small  cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
following surgery is a five year survival of 50% and 30%, respectively.(1) Five -year survival in 
surgical pathologic stage IA (T1N0M0) and IB (T2N0M0) disease is 68 -83% and 53 -65%, 
respectively. Five year survival in surgical path ologic stage IIA (T1N1M0) and IIB (T2N1M0) 
disease is 40 -63% and 38 -45%, respectively.(2) Clinical implications are pathologically staged 
patients (17 -32% stage IA, 35 -47% stage IB, 37 -60% stage IIA, and 55 -62% stage IIB) are destined 
to recur because they  harbor regional or distant micro -metastasis outside their surgical resection.  
 
 
1.2.2  Early Stage and Posto perative Chemotherapy  
For early stage NSCLC, t he addition of chemotherapy to surgery has been shown to improve 
survival. Postoperative chemotherapy  improved 5 -year survival from 59% and 40% to 79% and 60% 
for stage IB > 4cm tumors and stage II NSCLC, respectively. ( 11, 12) Three randomized controlled 
trials of postoperative chemotherapy each reported improved overall survival for chemotherapy in

cisplatin based chemotherapy for stage IIIA NSCLC. ( 16)  
 
1.2.[ADDRESS_898643] included small phase III and phase II trials which initially 
report ed a threefold  median survival advantage favoring chemotherapy. (17) (18) However, 
long-term results were not durable, although a trend of improved sur vival favoring chemotherapy 
persisted. (19) (20) Four additional preoperative chemotherapy phase III trials  have been 
conducted. One reported  significant OS advantage using a non -taxane platin triplet (21), two 
reported trends to OS advantage using paclita xel/carboplatin (22, 23), and one was completely 
negative administered older technology chemotherapy (non -taxane/platin ) to 88% of patients. 
(24)  Most recently, a phase III trial r eported  preoperative chemotherapy using g emcitabine plus 
cisplatin improved  survival in patients with clinical stage IIB/IIIA NSCLC. The hazard ratios for 
PFS and overall survival were both in favor of chemotherapy. A statistically significant impact 
of preoperative chemotherapy on outcomes was observed in the stage IIB/IIIA subg roup (3 -year 
PFS rate: 36.1% v 55.4%; P _ .002). (25) Similar survival benefits have been observed for 
preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy by [CONTACT_665463] -analysis. (26, 27, 28, 29)  
 
 
1.3  Proposal: Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665272] , a T -Cell targeted agent , to enhance T -Cell 
immune response combined with preoperative platinum doublet chemotherapy . Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] a 
monoclonal (IgG 1) antibody that co -stimulates T -Cells by [CONTACT_665464]28 homolog , CTLA -

family on the antigen - presenting cell (APC). The combination of enhanced immune response 
together with cytotoxic chemotherapy may improve clinical outcome . We propose to study 
circulating T cells and tumor infiltrating T cells with specificities against tumor associated 
antigens  to better understand the effect that ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665273].  
 
1.4  Clinical  Trial Rationale  
 
We propose studying the cell mediated effects of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665274].  The overall immune assessment strategy for the proposed 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665275] 1)  T cells with specificities 
against tumor associated antigens expressed by [CONTACT_102]’s progressing NSCLC are present, but 
functionally impaired, at baseline, and 2) that the immunomodulatory effects of chemotherapy

baseline few patients with cancer have populations of circulating T cells with specificities 
against TAA above the detectable level of 0.05% CD8 lymphocytes. The primary endpoint of 
this clinical trial will be to determin e if the addition of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665277] -small cell lung cancer increases the percentage of patients with circulating T cells with 
specificities against TAA. We will also measure tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in resected 
tumors.  
 
1.4.[ADDRESS_898645] Tumor Associated Antigens  
 
Functional TAA -specific T cell reactivities will be monitored  at 4 time points [1) baseline prior 
to treatment, 2) cycle 2  chemotherapy , prior to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103999] , 3) 21-[ADDRESS_898646] dose  (cycle 3 ) of chemotherapy prior to  surgery, and 4) 3 -6 weeks after adjuvant ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482506] #2 ] utilizing a 1 2-color intracellular cytokine staining (ICS)  assay  in which functional 
reactivities within maturational subsets of CD4  and CD8 T cells will be assessed.  In this assay, 
TAA driven production of IL -2, IFN -γ, TNF -α, and the degranulation marker CD107a will be 
measured, thus permitting examination of qualitative changes in relative T  cell polyfunctionality  
within maturationa l subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes .  Pools of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] [ADDRESS_898647] chemotherapy plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_224], will be an 
especially rich source of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) for analyses .  
 
 
1.4.2 Longitudinal  Analyses of T Cell and MDSC Phenotypes   
Phenotypic and functional characterization of T cell populations will be performed on peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as TIL . It will be of critical  importan ce to better 
understand the impact  of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665278]: 1) regulatory T cel ls (Tregs) , 2) myeloid -
derived suppressor cells  (MDSC) , 3) T cell activation, and 4) T cell exhaustion . These 
parameters will all be assessed using a 14-color polychromatic flow cytometry panel specifically  
designed and validated for this trial.  
 
The comp onents of  both the 1 2-color ICS  and the 1 4-color Treg/Activation/Exhaustion/MDSC 
polychromatic flow cytometry panels are delineated in the Table below.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, [ADDRESS_898648] allowed 
the rational design of new strategies for immunotherapy of tumors, including melanoma. It has 
been known for some time that engagement of the T cell antigen receptor by [CONTACT_665465] T cell activation; a second co -stimulatory signal is required for induction of IL -
2 production, proliferation and differentiation to effector function of naive T cells. Abundant 
data now indicate that the primary source of th is costimulation is mediated by [CONTACT_665466]28 on the T cell surface by [CONTACT_151189] B7 family on the antigen -presenting cell (APC).i 
(33) (Figure 1.)  
Expression of B7 has been shown to be limited to “professional” antigen presenting cells; that is, 
specialized cells of the hematopoietic lineage, including dendritic cells, activated macrophages, 
and activated B cells. It has been suggested that this sharply -defined restriction of B7 expression 
is a fail -safe mechanism for maintenance of peripheral T c ell tolerance, insuring that T cell 
activation can only be stimulated by [CONTACT_485351].ii (34) The fact that tumor cells do not 
express B7 contributes to their poor capacity to elicit immune responses.  (35, 36)  
The demonstration that induction of express ion of B7 on many tumor cells by [CONTACT_506373], 
transduction, or other mechanisms can heighten tumor immunogenicity led to great interest in 
pursuing this as an approach to tumor immunotherapy. As demonstrated in vivo in murine tumor 
models, the utility of B7 expression as a vaccination approach is limited by [CONTACT_15006]: 
(1) B7 -expressing tumor cell vaccines are only effective when the tumor cells have a high degree 
of inherent immunogenicity; (2) while B7 -expressing vaccines have been shown in ma ny cases 
to be effective in inducing protective immune responses, they have demonstrated only limited 
utility in inducing responses to established tumors; and (3) inactivation of tumor cells by 
[CONTACT_665467] -enhancing activ ity of the B7 gene product.  (37, 
38) 
In the past few years it has become apparent that co -stimulation is even more complex than 
originally thought. After activation, T cells express CTLA -4, a close homologue to CD28. 
CTLA -4 binds members of the B7 family w ith a much higher affinity than CD28.  (39) Although 
there was initially some controversy as to the role of CTLA -4 in regulating T cell activation, it 
has become clear that CTLA -4 down -regulates T cell responses. (40)   
This was initially suggested by [CONTACT_485353]: (1)  blockade of CTLA -4/B7 
interactions with antibody enhanced T cell responses; (2)  cross -linking of CTLA -4 with CD3 and 
CD28 inhibited T cell responses; and (3)  administration of antibodies to CTLA -4 in vivo 
enhanced the i mmune response to peptide antigens or superantigens in mice.  (41, 42, 43, 44) 
Blocking CTLA -4-B7 interaction while preserving signaling via CD28 resulted in enhanced T 
cell responses in vitr o (42).

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, [ADDRESS_898649] convincing demonstration of the down -regulatory role of CTLA -4 came from 
examination of mice with a null mutation . (45, 46, 47) C TLA -[ADDRESS_898650] 
spontaneously activated T cells evident at approximately 1 week after birth, followed by [CONTACT_665468]. These mice die at approximately 3 weeks of age, 
either as a result of polyclonal T cell expansion and tissue destruction or as a result of toxic 
shock resulting from lymphokine production by [CONTACT_941] T  cells.  Since thymocyte differentiation and 
selection p roceed normally in CTLA -4-deficient mice, the rampant T cell expansion that occurs 
in the mice indicates that CTLA -4 plays a critical role in down -regulating T cell responses in the 
periphery.  (44)

age with massive lymphoproliferation and multiorgan tissue destruction.  
Complete information on the pre -clinical toxicology studies can be found in the Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_310943] (IB). Non-clinical toxicity assessments included in vitro evaluation for the 
potential of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485250] -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDCC) or 
antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and toxicology assessments in cynomolgus 
monkeys  alone and in the presence of vaccines.  
The in vitro studies demonstrated that ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485251] - or (CD)3 -
activated human T cells. However, low to moderate ADCC activity was n oted at concentrations 
up to 50 ug/mL. These data are consi stent with the requirement of high levels of antigen 
expression on the surface of target cells for efficient ADCC or CDCC. Since ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] a 
human IgG1, an isotype generally capable of mediating CDCC and ADCC, the lack of these 
activities is likely due  to a very low expression of CTLA -[ADDRESS_898652] that ipi[INVESTIGATOR_561579] T cells in vivo. 
Indeed, no depletion of T cells or T cell subsets were noted in toxicology studies  in cynomolgus 
monkeys.  
No mortality or signs of toxicity were observed in three independent 14 -day intravenous 
toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys at multiple doses up to 30  mg/kg/dose. Furthermore,

1.7   Clinical Pharmacology  
1.7.1  Mechanism of Action  
CTLA -4 is a negative regulator of T -cell activation. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665281] -4 and blocks the 
interaction of CTLA -4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA -4 has been shown to 
augment T -cell activation and proliferation. The mechanism of action of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]’s effect in 
patients with melanoma is indirect, possi bly through T -cell mediated anti -tumor immune 
responses.

The pharmacokinetics of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_144] 499 patients with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma who received doses of 0.3, 3, or 10 mg/kg administered once every 3 wee ks for four 
doses. Peak concentration (C max), trough concentration (Cmin), and area under the curve 
(AUC) of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_145]. Upon 
repeated dosing of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665282] [ADDRESS_898653] dose. The following mean (percent coeffic ient of variation) parameters were generated 
through population pharmacokinetic analysis: terminal half -life of 14.7 days (30.1%); systemic 
clearance (CL) of 15.3 mL/h (38.5%); and volume of distribution at steady -state (Vss) of 7.21 L 
(10.5%). The mean (± SD) ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665283] -state with the 3 -mg/kg regimen 
was 21.8 mcg/mL (±11.2).  
Specific Populations:  Cross -study analyses were performed on data from patients with a variety 
of conditions, including 420 patients with melanoma who received s ingle or multiple infusions of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_150] 0.3, 3, or 10 mg/kg. The effects of various covariates on ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665284].  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_152]; however, no dose adjustment of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_153] a mg/kg basis. The following 
factors had no clinically meaningful effect on the CL of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]: age (range 26 to 86 years), 
gender, concomitant use of budesonide, perfor mance status, HLA -A2*0201 status, positive anti -
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_154], prior use of systemic anticancer therapy, or baseline lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The effect of race was not examined as there were insufficient 
numbers of patients in non -Caucasian ethnic groups.  
Renal Impairment:  Creatinine clearance at baseline did not have a clinically important effect on 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_321213] 29 
mL/min or greater.  
Hepatic Impairment:  Basel ine AST, total bilirubin, and ALT levels did not have a clinically 
important effect on ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665285].  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_561583]. The primary objective of 
Protocol MDX010 -015 was to determine the safety and PK profile of single and multiple doses 
of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_561584] a transfectoma or hybridoma cell line. Mean plasma concentrations 
of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_561585] 3  mg/kg (hybridoma -derived drug product); 2.8  mg/kg,

distribution at steady state (Vss) across cohorts 2.8, 3, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20  mg/kg, was 57.3 to 
82.6 mL/kg, indicating drug distribution was mostly limited to the intravascular space. The 
clearance was low ( range 0.11 to 0.29  mL/h/kg) and reflective of the half -life (range 297 to 
414 h), which is consistent with the long terminal disposition phase of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. There was 
moderate variability in the PK parameters among subjects, with CV of 11% to 48% in AUC  (0-
21d), 20% to 59% in CL, and 17% to 46% in Vss.  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79229] a hybridoma clone. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665286] B. A new drug substance manufacturing 
process (Process C) has been de veloped utilizing a higher producing sub -clone of the current 
Master Cell Bank, and modified cell culture and purification steps. The new drug substance 
manufacturing process is intended to replace the current drug substance manufacturing process. 
The bioc omparability of Process C relative to Process B was assessed in Study CA184087.  
 
PK in Phase 1 Study CA184087 (Process B and Process C)  
The PK of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665287] a newer process C relative to current 
process B as an IV infusio n (1.5 -hr), in subjects with advanced melanoma (CA184087). Upon 
meeting eligibility criteria, subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive either ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665288] 
B (Arm A, reference) or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665288] C (Arm B, test) at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV 
administer ed over 90 minutes every 3 weeks on Days 1, 22, 43, and 64 (Weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10) 
during induction therapy. Randomization was stratified by [CONTACT_197484] (BW) and LDH 
values since both were identified as potential covariates in a population PK asse ssment.  
The primary endpoint of PK data at week 4 demonstrated that the PK of Process B and Process C 
are biocomparable as the 90% CIs for the ratio of geometric means of AUC(0 -21d) and Cmax - 
both adjusted or not adjusted for covariates - were entirely co ntained with the pre -specified 
equivalence interval (80 - 125%).

Safety Profile of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] a Dose of 10 mg/kg (Phase 2 data)  
 
The safety profile of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] a dose of 10 mg/kg was characterized in a total of 
325 subjects who received multiple doses of 10 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665294] 4 
completed mela noma studies (CA184004, -007, -008, and -022). (49, 50, 51, 52) Overall, the 
incidence of Grade 3/4 AEs attributable to study drug was 31%. The target organ system, the 
incidence and the severity of the most commonly observed irAEs  are displayed in Table  4.

Across clinical studies that utilized ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665295] 0.3 to 10 mg/kg, the 
following adverse reactions were also reported (incidence less than 1% un less otherwise noted): 
urticaria (2%), large intestinal ulcer, esophagitis, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], renal 
failure, and infusion reaction.  
 
Based on the experience in the entire clinical program for melanoma, the incidence and severity 
of enter ocolitis and hepatitis appear to be dose dependent.

biopsies from patients who had immune -related hepatotoxicity showed evidence of acute 
inflammation (neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages).  
Immune -related Skin  Toxicity  
Skin immune -related AEs presented mostly as a rash and/or pruritus. Some subjects reported 
vitiligo associated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_288]. Fatal toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_665301].  
Immune -related En docrinopathy  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665302], specifically hypophysitis,

which may resemble other causes such as brain metastasi s or underlying disease. The most 
common clinical presentation includes headache and fatigue. Symptoms may also include visual 
field defects, behavioral changes, electrolyte disturbances, and hypotension. Adrenal crisis as a 
cause of the patient’s symptoms  should be excluded. Based on the available data with known 
outcome, most of the subjects symptomatically improved with hormone replacement therapy. It 
is possible that long -term hormone replacement therapy will be required for subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_665303]/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_299].

Neurological manifestations included muscle weakness and sensory neuropathy. Fatal Guillain -
Barré syndrome has been reported in clinical trials of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Patient s may present with 
muscle weakness. Sensory neuropathy may also occur. Unexplained motor neuropathy, muscle 
weakness, or sensory neuropathy lasting more than 4 days should be evaluated and non -
inflammatory causes such as disease progression, infections, me tabolic syndromes, and 
medications should be excluded.  
Other Immune -related AEs  
Ocular inflammation, manifested as Grade 2 or Grade 3 epi[INVESTIGATOR_308], was associated 
with concomitant diarrhea in a few subjects (< 1%) and occasionally occurred in th e absence of 
clinically apparent GI symptoms. Other presumed immune -related AEs reported include, but 
were not limited to, arthritis/arthralgias, pneumonitis, pancreatitis, autoimmune (aseptic) 
meningitis, autoimmune nephritis, pure red cell aplasia, nonin fective myocarditis, polymyositis, 
and myasthenia gravis, of which were individually reported for < 1% of subjects.  
Overall, immune -related AEs commonly started within [ADDRESS_898664] instances by [CONTACT_420], discontinuing dosing, and/or through 
administering symptomatic or immunosuppressive therapy, including corticosteroids, as 
mentioned  above and detailed in Section 11 . Immune -related AEs generally resolved within days

of 10 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_190] a prolongation of overall survival in patients with  
previously untr eated melanoma and was feasible with an acceptable safety profile.  
Overall survival and other efficacy endpoints were assessed in ipi[INVESTIGATOR_229].  
Overall Survival: Prolongs survival in patients with metastatic melanoma who have failed prior 
treatment.  
Best Objective Response Rate (BORR): By [CONTACT_665474][INVESTIGATOR_125]. These responses tend 
to be durable with the majority of subjects who achieve objective responses progr ession -free at 
the end of long observation periods.  
Disease Control Rate (DCR): Disease stabilization in subjects receiving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] a key 
characteristic of anti -tumor activity. Stable disease, sometimes of long duration, or slow steady 
decline of tum or lesion size over long periods of time, has been observed. Consequently, SD as 
well as objective responses (both captured in DCR) are important for completely characterizing 
anti-tumor activity of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665309] -Free Survival (PFS): Some subjects  demonstrate initial tumor volume increase 
before response, possibly due to T -cell infiltration as shown by [CONTACT_665475]. Consequently, PFS 
incompletely captures all patterns of activity and may underestimate the clinical activity of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].

Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665310] -stimulating antibody with evidence of anti -cancer activity (durable 
objective response and stable disease) in subjects with advanced melanoma, including subjects 
with established brai n disease. Observations of clinical activity defined by [CONTACT_665476] (eg, mWHO) may be inadequate to realize the kinetics 
and magnitude of clinical benefit achieved with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
Histopathologic evidence has demonstrated ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665311]. Therefore, early increases in lesion size detected radiologically 
or upon gross examination could be misinterpreted as progressive tumor growth and precede 
object ive tumor shrinkage. In addition the appearance of new lesions may have categorized a 
subject to have progressive disease using conventional tumor assessment criteria despi[INVESTIGATOR_665312] -existing lesions a nd a net reduction in

1.9.2    MDX010 -20 (Phase 3, 3 mg/kg, previously treated melanoma)  
MDX010 -20, a randomized (3:1:1), double -blind, double -dummy study included 
676 randomized subjects with unresectable or metastatic me lanoma previously treated with one 
or more of the following: aldesleukin, dacarbazine, temozolomide, fotemustine, or carboplatin. 
Of these 676 subjects, 403 were randomized to receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 3  mg/kg in combination 
with an investigational peptide vac cine with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (gp100), 137 were 
randomized to receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 3 mg/kg, and 136 were randomized to receive gp100 alone. 
The study enrolled only subjects with HLA A2*0201 genotype; this HLA genotype facilitates 
the immune prese ntation of the investigational peptide vaccine. The study excluded subjects with 
active autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic immunosuppression for organ 
transplantation. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]/placebo was administered at 3 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion 
every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Gp100/placebo was administered at a dose of 2 mg peptide by [CONTACT_665477] 3 weeks for four doses. Assessment of tumor response was 
conducted at Weeks 12 and 24, and every 3 months thereafter. Subjects with evide nce of 
objective tumor response at 12 or 24 weeks had assessment for confirmation of durability of 
response at 16 or 28 weeks, respectively. (48) 
The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  + gp100 arm 
compared to that in the gp100 arm. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were OS in the 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] + gp100 arm compared to the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772], OS in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665313]100 arm, best overall response rate (BORR) at Week 24 between each of the study arms, 
and du ration of response.  
Of the randomized subjects, 61%, 59%, and 54% in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] + gp100, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and 
gp100 arms, respectively, were men. Twenty -nine (29%) percent were  65 years of age, the 
median age was 57 years, 71% had M1c stage, 12% had a hi story of previously treated brain 
metastasis, 98% had ECOG performance status of 0 and 1, 23% had received aldesleukin and

1.9.4    10 mg/kg Dosing with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485285], Phase 3 studies show improved survival at both 3 mg/kg (study MDX010 -20) as 
well as with 10 mg/kg (study CA184024). Several additional conducted trials studied the 
efficacy and safety of 10 mg/kg dosing, and additional information gained from these trials is 
listed below:  
 A dose of 10 mg/kg is necessary to ensure a blockade of the CTLA -[ADDRESS_898670] : in vitro  a 
concentration of 20 g/mL of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485286] -4 to B7.1 and B7.2. With a dose of 3 mg/kg q3w 30% 
achieved a trough concentration of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485287] 20 g/mL, compared to 95% of 
subjects treated at 10 mg /kg q3w.  
 In addition, in all ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485288], mean Absolute Lymphocyte Count  
(ALC) increased after ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665316] 12 -week induction -dosing 
period, in a dose -dependent manner. In an analysis of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 0.3, 3, o r 10 mg/kg in 
melanoma studies CA184007, CA184008, and CA184022 combined, the rate of change in 
ALC after ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665317] (p = 0.0003), with the 
largest rate at 10 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Moreover, the rate of change i n ALC over the first half 
of the induction -dosing period was significantly associated with clinical activity  in these 
studies (p = 0.009), where clinical activity was defined as CR, PR, or prolonged SD (ie, SD 
lasting at least [ADDRESS_898671] dose). Al though these analyses alone could not determine 
whether the rate of change in ALC was specifically associated with clinical activity in 
response to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45777], as opposed to being generally prognostic, these results do 
suggest a potential benefit  to higher rates of ALC increase after ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45777].  
 
 
In the three pri mary studies conducted in advanced melanoma (CA184007, CA184008, and 
CA184022), subjects treated with 10 mg/kg during the induction period had the highest response, 
disease control rates, median OS as well as 1 -year and 2 -year survival rates compared to ot her

Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665321] -treated 
advanced melanoma, based on a large, multinational, double -blind, pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], Phase  3 study 
supported by a comprehensive Phase 2 program.  
The unique immune -based mechanism of action is reflected in the clinica l patterns of anti -cancer 
activity in some patients. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665322], and measurable clinical 
effects emerge after the immunological effects. Tumor infiltration with lymphocytes and the 
associated inflammation (documented by [CONTACT_373204] y in some subjects) is likely the cornerstone of the 
effect of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665323]. In some cases, inflammation may not be noted by [CONTACT_665478] a manner seen in patients 
receiving other types of anti -cancer treatments. In other cases, response may be preceded by [CONTACT_665479]/or the appearance of new lesions, which may  be 
mistaken for tumor progression on radiological evaluations. Therefore, in subjects who are not 
experiencing rapid clinical deterioration, confirmation of progression is recommended, at the

initiating potentially toxic alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_665324]. Immune -related (ir) response criteria were developed based on these observations to 
systematically categorize novel pat terns of clinical activity and are currently being prospectively 
evaluated in clinical studies.  
In metastatic diseases, stabilization is more common than response, and in some instances is 
associated with slow, steady decline in tumor burden over many mont hs, sometimes improving 
to partial and/or complete responses. Thus, the immune -based mechanism of action of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665325], sometimes with novel patterns of response, which 
contribute to its improvement in OS.  
The immune -based mechanism of action is also reflected in the safety profile. The most common 
drug-related AEs are immune -mediated, consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug and 
generally medically manageable with topi[INVESTIGATOR_199]/or systemic immunosuppressants. As 
previously discussed, the immune -mediated adverse reactions primarily involve the GI tract, 
skin, liver, endocrine glands, and nervous system.  
The early diagnosis of immune -mediated adverse reactions is important to initiate therapy and 
minimize complicati ons. Immune -mediated adverse reactions are generally manageable using 
symptomatic or immunosuppressive therapy as recommended through detailed diagnosis and 
management guidelines, as described fully in the current IB. The management guidelines for 
general immune -mediated adverse reactions and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -related GI toxicities, hepatotoxicity, 
endocrinopathy, and neuropathy are provided in the appendices of the current IB.  
In summary, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665326] -treated advanced melanoma and evidence of clinical activity in randomized 
studies in other tumor types. These findings, together with evidence of a safety profile that is 
manageable with careful monitoring and appropriate intervention for treatment of immune -
mediated toxicities, suggest an acceptable benefit to risk ratio. In this trial, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665327]-tumor immune activity . The overall risk -benefit ratio for patients entering this protocol is 
therefore at least comparable to and possibly better than alternative options.

10.0   SAMPLE PROCUREMENT AND HANDLING  
 
10.1 Blood Specimens  
 
Blood will be collected 4 times to assess activated CD8+ T cells with specificity against tumor antigens  and 
CD4 and CD8 functional memory . At each blood collection, 4 tubes of 8.5-ml each will be collected. The 
tubes used will be ACD a nti-coagulated Vacutainer (yellow tops). The following time points will have 
blood collections  (see appendix F): 
 
Collection 1: Baseline prior to treatment  
Collection 2: Cycle 2 day 1 chemo therapy  prior to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665341] 3: 21-36 days after completion of cycle 3 chemotherapy prior to surgery  
Collection 4: 3-6 weeks after adjuvant ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665342] #2.  
 
 
 
10.2 Surgical Specimens  
 
Patients will be approached to participate in the “DUHS Biospecimen Repository and Processing Core 
(BRPC)” eIRB [ADDRESS_898685] or surrogate (resident, pathology assistant). Relevant margins 
are inked, removed and examined by [CONTACT_665481], if necessary. It is imperative that harvesting 
tissue for use in researc h trials does not impede accurate initial assessment of critical features of the tumor 
resection, most notably margin status.  After the specimen has been processed for margin status, the frozen 
section assessment of the specimen is complete, (appendix G), a specimen of excess tumor will be released 
and acquired by [CONTACT_665482] .

(BRPC)”  protocol (eIRB [ZIP_CODE]), prior to surgery to help coordinate and facilitate tissue acquisition. Tissue 
will be collected and released as described in this protocol to ensure proper involvement of pathology to 
minimize t he chance that a tissue collection event interferes with appropriate clinical tissue processing and 
diagnosis.  For those subjects that decline participation in this biorepository tissue will be processed as 
outlined above.  
 
11.0  Treatment  
Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS) will provide ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665343].  The investigational 
product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient being tested as a reference in the 
study, whether blinded or unblinded. In this study, the investigation al product is ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  Other 
medications used in the study as support or escape medication for preventative, diagnostic, or 
therapeutic reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, are considered non -
investigational products. In  this protocol, non -investigational product(s ) is/are: paclitaxel , carboplatin 
and cisplatin.  
 
 
11.1. Treatments Administered  
Patients will receive  neoadjuvant  combination chemotherapy as follows:  
 
Cycle 1 : Paclitaxel  175mg/m2  intravenously over 3 hours, followed by [CONTACT_181615] 75 mg/m2 over 60 
minutes or carboplatin AUC  6 (capped at 900 mg)  intravenousl y over 30 -60 minutes Day 1 (21 day  
cycle  x 1).* 
Cycles 2 and 3 : Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg  IV** intravenously over 90 minutes  followed  by [CONTACT_114461] 
175mg/m2 intravenously over 3 hours, followed by [CONTACT_181615] 75 mg/m2 over 60 minutes or carboplatin 
AUC  6 (capped at 900 mg) intravenously over 30 -60 minutes Day 1 (every 21 days  x 2 cycles)*  
 
Surgery:  Standard surgical evaluation to occur at least 21days after the last dose of chemotherapy 
followed by [CONTACT_665480] . 
 
Post-surgical  Treatment : A total of [ADDRESS_898686] -operatively  
 
Adjuvant:  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg /IV** every 3 weeks x 2 doses beginning 4 weeks postoperative ly      
 (up to 10 weeks if needed for recovery)  
 
Maintenance:  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg /IV** every 12 weeks x  2 doses  
 
*The total administered dose of chemotherapy may be rounded up or down within a range of +/ - 5 % of 
the actual calculated dose.

dosing visit, and prior to the infusion). Dose only to change if there is a weight change >10% from 
baseline.  
 
11.2. Materials and Supplies  
 
Qualified personnel who are familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to themselves and 
to the environment should undertake the preparation, handling and safe disposal of chemotherapeutic 
agents in a self -contained, protective environment. Unused portion s of injectable chemotherapeutic 
agents that do not contain a bacteriostatic agent or are prepared with unpreserved diluents (i.e., Sterile 
Water of Injection USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection) should be discarded within eight hours 
of vial entry t o minimize the risk of bacterial contamination . 
 
11.2.1. Paclitaxel, Carboplatin,  Cisplatin  and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665344], carboplatin, and /or cisplatin and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665345]. As a result, patient compliance is ensured.  
 
 
11.2.2. Paclitaxel  
 
Paclitaxel is commercially available as a sterile solution concentrate, 6 mg/ml in 5 ml vials (30 mg/vial) 
in poluxyethylated castor oil (Cremophor EL) 50% and dehydrated alcohol, USP, 50%. Paclitaxel must 
be pr epared in glass or polyolefin containers due to leaching of diethylexlphthalate (DEHP) plasticizer 
from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags and intravenous tubing by [CONTACT_69147]. Each bag/bottle should be prepared imm ediately before administration. 
Formulation of a small number of fibers in collation (within acceptable limits established by [CONTACT_665483]'s) has been observed after preparation of paclitaxel.  Therefore, in line 
filtration is ne cessary for administration of paclitaxel solution. In line filtration should be accomplished 
by [CONTACT_8246] a hydrophilic, microporous filter of pore size not greater than 0.22 microns (e.g., 
IVEX -II or IVEX -HP or equivalent) into the IV fluid pathway di stal to the infusion pump.  Although 
particulate formulation does not indicate loss of drug potency, solutions exhibiting excessive particulate 
matter formation should not be used. The intact vials should be stored under refrigeration (2 -8 °C). All 
solutio ns of paclitaxel exhibit a slight haziness directly proportional to the concentration of drug and the 
time elapsed after preparation, although when prepared as  described above, solutions of Paclitaxel 
(0.3-1.2 mg/ml) are physically and chemically stable f or 24 hours. Drug will be diluted in order to 
administer an IV rate of 167 ml per hour for 3 hours. Paclitaxel will be administered via an infusion 
control device (pump) using non -PVC tubing and connectors, such as the IV administration sets 
(polyethylene or polyolefin) which are used to infuse parenteral Nitroglycerin. Nothing else is to be 
infused through the line where paclitaxel is being administered. Patients will be attended by [CONTACT_115645]

11.2.3. Cisplatin  
 
Cisplatin (cis -Diamminedichlorop latinum; cis -DDP) is commercially available. It is available as 1 
mg/ml concentration aqueous injection in multidose vials of 50 ml. It should be stored at room 
temperature (15 C to 25C) and protected from light. Solutions diluted in 0.9% or 0.45% NaCl to  a 
concentration of 0.05 -2 mg/ml are stable for up to [ADDRESS_898688] with 
cisplatin yields a black precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047].  
 
11.2.4. Carboplatin  
Carboplatin is supplied commercially as a sterile lyophilized powder available in single -dose vials   
contain ing 50 mg, 50 mg and 450 mg of c arboplatin.  Each vial con tains equal parts by [CONTACT_665484] m annitol. Preparation:  Immediately before use, the content of each vial must be 
reconstituted with either Sterile Water for injection, USP, 5% dextrose in water, or 0.9% Sodium 
Chlorid e injection, USP, to produce a c arboplatin concentration of 10 mg/ml.  When prepared as 
directed, Carboplatin solutions are stable for 8 hours at room temperature.  Since no antibacterial 
preservative is containe d in the formulation, it is recommended that c arboplatin solutions be discarded 8 
hours after diluti on. Note: aluminum reacts with c arboplatin causing precipi[INVESTIGATOR_492014]; therefore, needles or intravenous sets containing aluminum par ts that may come in contact [CONTACT_665485] c arboplatin. Storage and  Stability:  
Unopened vials of c arboplatin are stable for the life indicated on the package when stored at controlled 
room temperatu re and protected from light. Administration:  Administer over 30-60 minutes after 
completing the p aclitaxel infusion.  The Crockcroft Gault formula  (Dose=AUC (CCC+25) will be used 
to achieve the desired AUC where CCC=Wt Kg x (140 -age)/72xCr (using actual body weight for both 
female and male and if female use 85%).  Capped AUC  6 dose of 900 mg.  Appendix D.

11.3 Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study  
 
11.3.1   Paclitaxel and Cisplatin or Carboplatin and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665349] 10 mg/kg, cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or carboplatin AUC  6 and paclitaxel 175 
mg/m2 was found to be safe and effective.  In advanced metastatic NSCLC, Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg has 
been successfully combined with the chemotherapy  doublet, paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 
6, as first -line treatment.  A recent phase II trial reported that the phased sequence (two courses 
chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_665487] + Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) had superior progression free 
survival , overall response, and overall survival; 6.4 months, 57%, and 12.9 months, respectively; 
compared to 5.7 months, 49%, and 9.1 months, for the concurrent sequence. (31, 32)  Overall safety was 
similar to the control arm with grade ¾ adverse events being 57% , 54% and 40% in the three study 
arms, (concurrent ipi [INVESTIGATOR_125]+Paclitaxel/carboplatin,  phased ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]+Paclitaxel/carboplatin, and 
paclitaxel/carboplatin alone),  respectively. Hematologic abnormalities observed were those generally 
expected with paclitaxe l/carboplatin alone. Most common (> 5% in any arm) treatment related grade ¾ 
adverse events (concurrent vs phased vs Paclitaxel/carboplatin alone) were: fatigue (10% vs 7% vs 6%) 
and diarrhea (10% vs 7% vs 4%) among nonsquamous patients; nausea (0% vs 5% v s 7%), vomiting 
(0% vs 5% vs 7%) and dyspnea  (0% vs 0% vs 7%) among squamous patients.  (31)Lynch et al, abstr

[IP_ADDRESS]    Renal Toxicity : Cisplatin and Paclitaxel   
 
Renal Toxicity Cisplatin  
Cisplatin therapy should be delayed if the creatinine is > 2.0 mg/dL. If treatment is delayed for renal 
toxicity, re -evaluate the serum creatinine weekly. If the serum creatinine is ≤2.0 mg/dL proceed with 
cisplatin at 75% of previous dose. If serum creatinine is not ≤2.0 mg/dL after 14 days, start next cycle 
without cisplatin. Missed cisplatin doses will not be made up. If creatinine is still not ≤2.0 mg/dL after a

Cisplatin is well known to cause high -frequency hearing loss. Continued use of the drug does not always 
result in hearing loss, although it may. If grade 2 or worse hearing loss is noted, the patient should be 
presented with a discussion of th e relative risks of hearing loss versus the potential benefit of continuing 
cisplatin therapy, and a decision made as to continuation of agent. Grade 3 or 4 hearing loss will warrant 
discontinuation of agent.

[IP_ADDRESS]   Other Toxicit ies from Paclitaxel  
 
If a patient develops chest pain, hypotension, or arrhythmia other than asymptomatic sinus brachycardia, 
the paclitaxel infusion should be stopped and patients should not receive further paclitaxel. For 
asymptomatic sinus brachycardia,  the infusion need not be stopped, but the patie nt should be followed

11.5.1   Immune -Related Adverse Events (irAEs)  Reactions and Immune -mediated Adverse 
Reactions: Definition, Monitoring, and Treatment  
Blocking CTLA -4 function may permit the emergence of auto -reactive T  cells and resultant clinical 
autoimmunity. Rash/vitiligo, diarrhea/colitis, uveitis/epi[INVESTIGATOR_227], hepatitis, and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_665369]-related, presumptive autoimmune events, now termed immune -medi ated adverse reactions , noted 
in previous ipi[INVESTIGATOR_229].  
For the purposes of this study, an immune -related adverse reaction is defined as an adverse reaction of 
unknown etiology associated with drug exposure and consistent with an immune phenomenon. E fforts 
should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin or other etiologic causes prior to 
labeling an event an immune -related adverse reaction . Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) 
data should be used to support the diagnosis  of an immune -related toxicity. Suspected immune -related 
adverse reactions must be documented on an AE or SAE form. Another term for an irAE is an immune -
mediate adverse reaction, as it is termed in the Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_277]. Both terms may  
be used in this protocol document.  
Patients should be informed of and carefully monitored for evidence of clinically significant systemic 
immune -mediated adverse reactions  (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus -like diseases) or organ -specific 
immune -mediat ed adverse reaction  (e.g., rash, colitis, uveitis, hepatitis or thyroid disease). If an 
immune -mediated adverse reaction is noted, appropriate work -up (including biopsy if possible) should 
be performed, and steroid therapy may be considered if clinically n ecessary.

11.5.2   Treatment of Infusion Reactions Associated with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665370], it is less likely that any allergic reaction will 
be seen in patients. However, it is possi ble that infusion of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_232] a cytokine release 
syndrome that could be evidenced by [CONTACT_411], chills, rigors, rash, pruritus, hypotension, hypertension, 
bronchospasm, or other symptoms. No prophylactic pre -medication will be given unless indica ted by 
[CONTACT_412]. Reactions should be treated based upon the following 
recommendations.  
 For mild symptoms (e.g., localized cutaneous reactions such as mild pruritus, flushing, rash):  
 Decrease  the rate of infusion until recovery from symptoms, remain at bedside and 
monitor patient.  
 Complete  the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_233].  
 Diphenhydramine  50 mg IV  may be administered at the discretion of the treating 
physician and patients m ay receive additional doses with close monitoring.  
 Premedication  with diphenhydramine may be given at the discretion of the investigator 
for subsequent doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 For moderate symptoms (any symptom not listed above [mild symptoms] or below [sever e 
symptoms] such as generalized pruritus, flushing, rash, dyspnea, hypotension with systolic 
BP >80  mmHg):  
 Interrupt  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 Administer  diphenhydramine 50  mg IV . 
 Monitor  patient closely until resolution of symptoms.  
 Corticosteroids  may abrogate any be neficial immunologic effect, but may be 
administered at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 Resume  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_234].

 If symptoms  develop after resumption of the infusion, the infusion should be 
discontinued and no additional ipi[INVESTIGATOR_236].  
 The next dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] w ill be administered at its next scheduled time and may be 
given with pre-medication (diphenhydramine and acetaminophen ) and careful 
monitoring, following the same treatment guidelines outlined above.  
 At the discretion  of the treating physician additional o ral or IV antihistamine may be 
administered prior to dosing with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 For severe symptoms (e.g., any reaction such as bronchospasm, generalized urticaria, systolic 
blood pressure 80 mm Hg, or angioedema):  
 Immediately discontinue infusion of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and disconnect infusion tubing from the 
subject.  
 Consider  bronchodilators , epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1  mg IV or subcutaneously , and/or 
diphenhydramine 50  mg IV , with solumedrol 100  mg IV , as needed.  
 Patients  should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will 
not recur.  
 No further  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_239].  
 In case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., appearance within one week after 
treatment of a localized or  generalized pruritus), symptomatic treatment may be given (e.g., 
oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).  
 
 
11.5.[ADDRESS_898699] use clinical judgment to de termine if the fever 
is related to the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_241]. If a patient experiences isolated drug fever, for 
the next dose, pre -treatment with acetaminophen or non -steroidal anti -inflammatory agent (investigator 
discretion) should be i nstituted and a repeated antipyretic dose at [ADDRESS_898700]  dosing with an appropriate 
antipyretic, the infusion rate for subsequent dosing should be decreased to 50% of the previous rate. If 
fever recurs following infusion rate change, the investigator should assess the patient’s level of 
discomfort with the even t and use clinical judgment to determine if the patient should receive further

Suggested Evaluation and Treatment  for Immune -related Adverse Eve nts: 
Early diagnosis and t reatment intervention for high -grade irAEs can help prevent the occurrence of 
complications such as GI perforation.  Gastrointestinal (diarrhea) and skin (rash) related toxicities are 
the most common irAEs reported in studies with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] . Suggested eva luation procedures for 
suspected irAEs of the GI tract, liver, skin, eye, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], and adrenal gland are described below.  When 
sypmptomatic therapy is inadequate or inappropriate, an irAE should be treated with systemic 
corticosteroids followed by a gra dual taper.  Infrequently, subjects with irAEs may require courses of 
corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive agents that exceed [ADDRESS_898701] Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly Pcarinii ) and prevalent 
fungal strains, as well as considerations for any additional pathogens that may be indicated by [CONTACT_541956] (e.g., herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus) or the environment (e.g., occupation, 
recent travel) of the subject. Consultat ion with infectious disease specialists may be considered. 
Immune -related (ir)AE management algorithms for general irAEs, and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665372], 
hepatotoxicity, endocrinopathy, and neuropathy have been developed and are listed below.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Gastrointestinal Tract:  Immune -mediated Enterocolitis  
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, mucus or 
blood in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus) . In 
symptomatic patients, rule out infectious etiologies and consider endoscopic evaluation for persistent or 
severe symptoms.  
Permanently discontinue ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665373] a dose of 1 to  2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent . Upon improvement to Grade 
[ADDRESS_898702] one month. In clinical trials, 
rapid corticosteroid tapering resulted in recurrence or worsening symptoms of en terocolitis in some 
patients.

persistent for more than one week, initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day 
prednisone or equivalent.  
The differential diagnosis for subjects presenting with abdominal pain should include colitis,

the cecal wall on CT scan that may have represented localiz ed inflammation.  
Diarrhea (defined as either first watery stool, or increase in frequency 50% above baseline with urgency 
or nocturnal bowel movement, or bloody stool) should be further evaluated and infectious or alternate 
etiologies ruled out. Subjects s hould be advised to inform the investigator if any diarrhea occurs, even 
if it is mild. An algorithm for managing subjects with diarrhea or suspected colitis is provided in 
Appendix L. 
The majority of subjects with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -induced diarrhea or colitis re sponded to symptomatic therapy 
or corticosteroids. Permanent discontinuation of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665375] (e.g., methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg once or twice per day or equivalent) is strongly 
recommended for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665376] ≥  Grade 3 diarrhea/colitis and steroids should be slowly tapered 
according to symptomatic response over at least 1 month. Subjects with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -related Grade 2 
diarrhea/colitis have to skip ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665377], fluid replacement or budesonide, but should be immediately switched to corticosteroids 
(prednisone 1 mg/kg or equivalent) if symptoms persist for [ADDRESS_898703] subjects with 
diarrhea/colitis will rapi[INVESTIGATOR_665378] c orticosteroids. The dose should be gradually 
tapered over at least a 1 -month duration. Lower doses of prednisone may be considered for less severe 
cases of colitis. It is suggested that prednisone (for oral administration) or methylprednisolone (for IV 
administration) be the corticosteroids of choice in the treatment of colitis. Caution should be taken in 
the use of  narcotics in patients with abdominal pain or colitis/diarrhea as narcotic use may mask  the 
signs of colonic perforation. Infrequently, subjects  will appear refractory to corticosteroids or will flare 
following taper of corticosteroids. In these subjects, unless contraindicated (i.e., sepsis, perforation and 
other serious infections), a single dose of infliximab at 5 mg/kg may provide benefit. For  patients with 
concomitant hepatitis, use of mycophenolate mofetil is recommended in place of infliximab. For 
patients with long term immunosuppressive therapy, administer antimicrobial prophylactics as 
appropriate per institutional guidelines. Such cases should be discussed with the sponsor study medical

[IP_ADDRESS]   Liver:  Immune -mediated Hepatitis  
Monitor liver function tests (hepatic transaminase and bilirubin levels) and assess patients for signs and 
symptoms of hepatotoxicity before each dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. In patients with hepatotoxicity, rule ou t 
infectious or malignant causes and increase frequency of liver function test monitoring until resolution.  
Permanently discontinue ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665379] 3 –5 hepatotoxicity and administer systemic 
corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day o f prednisone or equivalent . When liver function tests 
show sustained improvement or return to baseline, initiate corticosteroid tapering and continue to taper 
over [ADDRESS_898705] LFTs performed immed iately and reviewed before administering the 
next dose of study drug. Any increase in LFT should be evaluated to rule out non -inflammatory causes 
of hepatotoxicity including infections, disease progression or medications and followed with frequent 
LFT moni toring at 3 -day intervals until resolution.  
Any LFTs ≥ Grade 2 (for subjects with normal baseline LFT) or LFT ≥ 2 times baseline  values (for

corticosteroid therapy (e.g., methylpredni solone 2 mg/kg once or twice per day or equivalent) to control 
initial symptoms. A skin biopsy should be performed if appropriate. Once rash or pruritis is controlled, 
the initiation of corticosteroid taper should be based on clinical judgment; however, th e corticosteroid 
dose should be gradually tapered over a period of at least 1 month. Patients with any high -grade skin

Subjects with unexplained symptoms such as fatigue, myalgias, impotence, mental stat us changes, or 
constipation should be investigated for the presence of thyroid, pi[INVESTIGATOR_665392]. An 
endocrinologist should be consulted if an endocrinopathy is suspected. If there are any signs of adrenal 
crisis such as severe dehydra tion, hypotension, or shock, IV corticosteroids with mineralocorticoid 
activity (e.g., methylprednisolone) should be initiated immediately. If the patient’s symptoms are 
suggestive of an endocrinopathy but the patient is not in adrenal crisis, an endocrine  laboratory results 
should be evaluated before corticosteroid therapy is initiated.  
Endocrine work -up should include at least thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 levels. These 
should be obtained to determine if thyroid abnormalities are present.  THS, prolactin and a morning

discontinuation of corticosteroids should be avoided due to possible prolonged adrenal suppression. 
Once symptoms or laboratory abnormalities are controlled, and overall patient improvement is evident, 
the initiation of s teroid taper should be based on clinical judgment; however the corticosteroid dose 
should be gradually tapered over a period of at least 1 month. Appropriate hormone replacement therapy

investigator’s discretion. Granulocyte colony -stimulating factor must be discontinued at least 24 hours 
prior to the start of the next cycle of chemotherapy. If a patient develops hematologic toxicities, 
chemotherapy dose reduction and acute treatment of n eutropenia are recommended, rather than 
chemotherapy dose maintenance and pre -emptive treatment with G -CSFs. Use of erythropoietin (e.g.,

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  For example, a patient weighing 114 kg (250 lb) would be administered 1140 mg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (114 
kg x 10 mg/kg = 1140 mg) with an infusion volume of 228 mL (1140 mg ÷ 5 mg/mL = 228 mL) at a 
rate of approximately 2.5 mL/min (228 mL ÷ 90 minutes) x 60 minutes  = 150 ml/hr . 
The total dose must be calculated using the most recent subject weight (obtained within 3 days of the 
dosing visit, and prior to the infusion). Rounding to a whol e number is acceptable. Dose does not 
change unless weight changes > 10% from baseline.  
 
16. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS  
 
16.1 Criteria for Response, Progression, and Relapse (Solid  Tumors)  
 
Patients should be reevaluated by [CONTACT_16622]  (RECIST 1.1) after 
completion of neoadjuvant ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499747] (planned 3 cycles). Unidimensional 
measurements in the largest diameter will be used.  
 
 
16.1.1 Measurable Disease  
 
Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured (select largest, most 
reproducible lesions) in at least one dimension (largest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be 
recorded) as ≥20 mm with x -ray or ≥[ADDRESS_898734] scan (CT scan slice thickness ≤5 mm) or MRI. If 
scan has slice  thickness >5mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness. Measurable lesions will also include those that can be directly measured on physical exam 
with calipers and are at least [ADDRESS_898735] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal 
fractions of centimeters).  
 
 
16.1.2 Non-Measurable Disease  
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <20 mm with x -ray or 
<[ADDRESS_898736] or MRI scan), are considered non -measurable disease. Lesions considered non -
measurable include: bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitic involvement of  skin or lungs, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses/abdominal 
organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_87415].

Confidential: The information contained in this document is regarded as confidential and may not be disclosed to another part y unless such 
disclosure is required to initiate the study, to conduct study related activities, or t o comply with national, state or local laws and regulations. 
Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  16.1.3 Target Lesions  
 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per  organ (total 5 maximum target lesions) are 
considered target lesions. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_91071]). A sum of the longest diameter (LD)  for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum LD .  
The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_192236] h to characterize the objective tumor response.  
 
 
16.1.4 Non-Target Lesio ns 
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Non -target lesions include measurable lesions that exceed the maximum numbers 
per organ or total of all involved organs as well as non -measurable lesions. Measurements of these 
lesions are not required but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
 
 
16.1.5 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable/Evaluable Disease  
 
If subject has measurable disease, all measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation. For 
subjects with evaluable disease only, the sites of disease will be noted at baseline and followed for 
increase or decrease in size and/or new disease. All baseline evaluations should be perf ormed as closely 
as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than [ADDRESS_898737] of a treatment.  
 Clinical lesions : Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the 
case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate 
the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 CT a nd MRI : These techniques should be performed with cuts of 5 mm or less in slice 
thickness contiguously. If scan has slice thickness >[ADDRESS_898738] available 
and reproducible method to measure lesions for response assessment.  
 Laryngoscopy, Endoscopy : Such techniques can be useful to evaluate patients for 
response in SCCHN and may be used in tumor measurement.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016   Cytology, Histology : These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
 
16.2   Response Crit eria 
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
       Complete Response (CR): Disappearance  of all target lesions  
 Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease  in the sum of the largest diameter (LD) of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD  
 Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase  and a [ADDRESS_898739] sum LD recorded since 
the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. If scan showin g new 
lesion is of anatomical region which was not included in baseline scans, it is PD.  
 Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatm ent started  
 
 
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level  
 Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more non -target 
lesion(s) and/or maintena nce of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
 Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression (not attributable to different scanning technique or non-tumor ) of existing 
non-target lesions. (‘Unequivocal p rogression’ must be an overall level of substantial 
worsening in non -target disease that is of a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or 
PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy.) I f scan showing new lesion is of anatomical region which 
was not included in baseline scans, it is PD.

objective response and stable disease) in subjects with advanced mel anoma, including subjects  
with established brain disease. Observations of clinical activity defined by [CONTACT_665498] (eg, mWHO) may be inadequate to realize the kinetics  
and magnitude of clinical benefit achieved with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 
Histopathologic evidence has demonstrated ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665406]. Therefore, early  increases in lesion size detected radiologically or  
upon gross examination could be misinterpreted as progressive tumor growth  and precede objective  
tumor shrinkage. In addition the appearance of new lesions ma y have categorized a subject to

tumor burden that includes the new lesions.  
Therefore, patients with evidence of possible target lesion growth or new lesion appearance will not be

deemed resectable by [CONTACT_11065].  Target Lesions  Non-Target

16.3 Cytology and Histology  
 
If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be  confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3973]/histology. These techniques can be used to differentiate betwe en PR and CR in rare cases (for 
example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ ce ll tumor s, where known residual benign tumors 
can remain). The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that ap pears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor h as met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to diff erentiate between  response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the 
treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
Pathologic Response Criteria  
After receiving preop erative  chemotherapy + Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], criteria for examining resected tumor will be 
as follows:  
 No Response no evidence of cell death or tumor necrosis.  
 Partial Response ≥30% tumor necrosis or cell death.  
 Complete Response no evidence of viable tumor in surgical specimen (includes lung tissue 
and dissected lymph nodes ) 
 
 
16.4 Disease -Free Survival  
 Disease -free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from surgical resection to disease recurrence (first 
disease recurrence or death, whichever comes first) after surgery.  
 
 
16.5 Survival  
Survival will be measured from the date of enr ollment.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, [ADDRESS_898740], up to and 
including follow -up visits  will be reported  as per Adverse Event Reporting  sections below.  Safety will 
be evaluated for all treated patients using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov). Safety as sessments will be 
based on medical review of adverse event reports and the results of vital sign measurements, physical 
examinations, and clinical laboratory tests.  
 
 
 
 17.[ADDRESS_898741] entered this study and       
for alerting BMS or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered 
an unanticipated benefit to the patient. The in vestigator is responsible for appropriate medical care of 
patients during the study. The investigator remains responsible for following, through an appropriate 
health care option, adverse events that are serious or that caused the patient to discontinue be fore 
completing the study. The patient should be followed until the event is resolved or explained. Frequency 
of follow -up evaluation is left to the discretion of the investigator. Safety measures that will be used in 
the study include physical examination s, and clinical laboratory tests (e.g., hematology, blood 
chemistries, and CrCl). Patients will be rated for toxicity prior to each cycle using the NCI CTCAE scale 
version 4.0. Refer to the Study Schedule (Appendix A) for timing of safety measures.  
 
An adv erse event (AE) is the development of an unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, disease or 
the deterioration of a pre -existing condition that occurs while a patient is enrolled on a clinical trial, 
whether the event is considered related or unrelated to the study treatment. An adverse event is any 
adverse change from the subject’s baseline (pretreatment) condition; including any clinical or lab test 
abnormality that occurs during the course of research after treatment has started.  Adverse events will 
use the descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Toxicity and 
Adverse Event Reporting, Version 4.0 (CTCAE; CTEP home page: http://ctep.info.nih.gov ). 
 
Adverse events can be spontane ously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, examination, 
or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned 
regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)

is expected, not serious or not related to the research study should be reported as part of the routine 
clinical data. All adverse events should be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the case 
report form.  
 
If known, the diagnosis of the unde rlying illness or disorder should be recorded, rather than its 
individual symptoms. The following information should be captured for all AEs: onset, duration, 
intensity, seriousness, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and treatment requ ired. If 
treatment for the AE was administered, it should be recorded in the medical record.   
 
 
Subjects having adverse events will be monitored with relevant clinical assessments and laboratory tests 
as determined by [CONTACT_093]. All adverse events a re to be followed to satisfactory resolution or 
stabilization of the event(s).  
 
Any actions taken and follow -up results must be recorded on the appropriate page of the case report 
form as well as the subject’s source documentation (medical record).  
 
For all adverse events that require the subject to be discontinued from the study, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests must be repeated at clinically appropriate intervals until satisfactory 
resolutions or stabilization of the event(s).  
 
Cases o f pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to study drugs should be reported 
for tracking purposes. Additional data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory 
reporting and drug safety evaluation. This data also inclu des cases of pregnancies that occur during 
paternal exposures to [COMPANY_016] study drug. Lack of drug effect is not an adverse event in 
clinical trials because the purpose of the clinical trial is to establish drug effect.  
 
If a patient never receives study drug, but experiences an adverse event after the informed consent 
document is signed, ONLY events the investigator believes may have been caused by a protocol 
procedure will be reported.

additional required forms. Adverse events are to be reported for 30 days after the patient’s last dose of 
study drug and for any events beyond that time in which the investigator believes the event is related to 
study drug or study related procedures.  
 
Events leading to the clinical outcome of death due to NSCLC  will be included as part of the safety 
and efficacy analyses for this study, and will not be reported as adverse events via CRF  unless the 
investigator bel ieves the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_665499].  
 
 
17.1.2. Serious Adverse Events  
 
Study site personnel must alert BMS and the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_665408] “serious” 
(defined below) adverse event experienced by a patient. In addition, adverse events must be reported to 
regulatory authorities according to the definitions and timelines specified in the local laws and 
regulations.  
An unexpected adverse event  is any adverse drug experience where the specificity or severity is not 
consistent with the current investigator brochure; or, if an investigator brochure is not available, the 
specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the risk information d escribed in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application.  
Serious events are those that result in:  
 death  
 initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 a life -threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)  
 persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 congenital anomaly/birth defect  is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that 
may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon 
appropriate medical and sci entific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require 
intervention [e .g., medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the 
definition above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in  
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)   
 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]:  
 a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_665409] l ess than 24 hours that does 
not result in admission (unless considered an “important medical event” or a life -threatening 
event)  
 admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
 routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, routine 
colonoscopy)

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016   medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state that was planned 
before study entry. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases.  
 Admission encountered for a nother life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and 
requires no medical/surgical intervention (e .g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative).  
 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_665410] (such as for study drug administration) 
that are not the result of an adverse experience (e.g. elective surgery for a pre -existing condition) are not 
considered SAE’s and should be recorded on the appropriate case report form. H ospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or 
death that are unequivocally due to progression of disease should not be reported as an SAE . 
 
Exception: BMS will be alerted to a study -specific clinical outcome of death due to progressive disease 
as a serious adverse event only if the investigator deems it to be related to use of the study drug.  
 
Serious adverse event collection begins after the patient has signed informed consent and has received a 
study drug. If a patient experiences an SAE after signing informed consent, but prio r to receiving study 
drug, the event will normally NOT be collected unless the investigator believes the event may have been 
caused by a protocol procedure.  
 
Serious adverse events will be collected for [ADDRESS_898743] been caused by [CONTACT_13462] a protocol procedure.  
 
 
17.1.3. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
 
All serious adverse event (SAE) reports should include the patient study number, age, sex, weight, 
severity or reaction, relationship to the study drug(s), date of administration of test medications and all 
concomitant medication and medical treatment prov ided. This information is to be recorded on FORM 
3500 , which can be located at: www.fda.gov/medwatch/getforms.htm . 
 
The SAE report should be comprised of full written summary detailing relevant aspec ts of the adverse

All adverse events, including those that are serious will be graded according to the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0.  
 
The following categories and definitions of causal relatio nship to investigational product as determined 
by a physician should be used:  
 
Related:  There is a reasonable causal relationship to investigational product administration and  
the adverse event.  
 
Not Related:  There is not a reasonable causal relationship to investigational product 
administration and the adverse event.  
 
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey in general that there are facts (e .g., 
evidence such as de -challenge/re -challenge) or other arguments to suggest a positive  causal relationship.

The Duke Cancer Institute SOC i s responsible for annual data and safety monitoring of DUHS sponsor -
investigator phase I and II, therapeutic interventional studies that do not have an independent Data 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The primary focus of the SOC is review of safety data, toxicities and 
new information that may affect subject safety or efficacy. Annual safety reviews includes but may not 
be limited to review of safety data, enrollment status, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12596], accrual, toxicities, 
reference literature, and inter im analyses as provided by [CONTACT_456] -investigator.  The SOC in concert 
with the DCI Monitoring Team (see Section 12.1 for Monitoring Team description) oversees the 
conduct of DUHS cancer -related, sponsor -investigator therapeutic intervention and preventi on 
intervention studies that do not have an external monitoring plan, ensuring subject safety and that the 
protocol is conducted, recorded and reported in accordance with the protocol, standing operating 
procedures (SOPs), Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and  applicable regulatory requirements.

18.1   Monitoring Plan  
Review of this protocol begins with an initial review by [CONTACT_140642] , Cancer Center Protocol Committee 
(CPC), which performs a risk assessment of the trial. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_665414], which will determine the intensity of subsequent external monitoring. Documentation of this 
assessment will be maintained.  
 
The clinical research study will be monitored both internally by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_665415] 
(DCI) Monitoring Team in accordance with their NCI -approved “Institutional Protocol Monitoring 
Procedures and Guidelines for NIH -sponsored Research Inv olving Human Subjects”.   The monitoring 
team will conduct visits to ensure subject safety and to ensure that the protocol is conducted, recorded 
and reported in accordance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, good clinical practice, and 
applic able regulatory requirements.  As specified in the DCI monitoring plan, they will conduct routine 
monitoring after the third subject is enrolled, followed by [CONTACT_12636] 1 -3 subjects until the 
study is closed to enrollment and subjects are no long er receiving study interventions that are more than 
minimal risk.  
Additional monitoring may be prompted by [CONTACT_12637], unexpected frequency of 
serious and/or unexpected toxicities, or other concerns and may be initiated upon request of  DUHS and 
DCI leadership, the DCI Cancer Protocol Committee, the Safety Oversight Committee (SOC),  the 
sponsor, Principal Investigator, or the IRB.  All study documents must be made available upon request 
to the DCI Monitoring Team and other authorized reg ulatory authorities, including but not limited to the 
National Institute of Health, National Cancer Institute, and the FDA.  
 
In terms of internal review, the PI  (with the help of the statistician)  will continuously monitor and 
tabulate adverse events. Appr opriate reporting to the Duke University Medical Center IRB will be made.

18.2 Audits  
 
The Duke School of Medicine Clinical Trials Quality Assurance (CTQA) office may conduct audits to 
evaluate compliance with the protocol and the principles of GCP.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_665416](s) direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate his/her time and the time of the study 
team to the CTQA auditor(s) in order to discuss findings and any relevant issues.  
 
CTQA audits  are designed to protect the rights and well -being of human research subjects. CTQA audits 
may be routine or directed (for cause). Routine audits are selected based upon risk metrics generally 
geared towards high subject enrollment, studies with limited ov ersight or monitoring, Investigator 
initiated Investigational Drugs or Devices, federally -funded studies, high degree of risk (based upon 
adverse events, type of study, or vulnerable populations), Phase I studies, or studies that involve 
Medicare populatio ns. Directed audits occur at the directive of the IRB or an authorized Institutional 
Official.  
 
CTQA audits examine research studies/clinical trials methodology, processes and systems to assess 
whether the research is conducted according to the protocol ap proved by [CONTACT_12638]. The primary 
purpose of the audit/review is to verify that the standards for safety of human subjects in clinical trials 
and the quality of data produced by [CONTACT_12639]. The audit/review will serve as a 
qualit y assurance measure, internal to the institution. Additional goals of such audits are to detect both 
random and systemic errors occurring during the conduct of clinical research and to emphasize “best 
practices” in the research/clinical trials environment.

20.0. Departure from the Protocol  
 
There should be no departure from the protocol if at all possible. If an emergency occurs that requires 
departure from this protocol, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_631021], if cir cumstances and time permit, contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_665417]. Such contacts 
with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_665418] a decision as to whether or not the subject will be continued on study. 
Such departures need to be clearly documented on the Duke Notification  of Protocol 
Deviation/Violation form.  A protocol deviation or violation  is reportable to the IRB if the event is likely 
to adversely affect: (i) the rights and welfare of the research subject; (ii) the safety of the research 
subject; (iii) the integrity o f the research data; and/or (iv) the subject’s willingness to continue study 
participation. Such events should be reported to the DUHS IRB within 10 business days  of the time the

guidelines, all patients will sign a statement of informed con sent, which has been approved by [CONTACT_1201]. 
The patient will receive a copy of the executed consent document. The signed consent will be retained at 
the investigative site for each patient. The informed consent document serves as authorization as deemed 
unde r HIPAA and contains the appropriate statements regarding privacy and confidentiality of protected 
health information (PHI) as well as information on withdrawal from the study. The investigator or 
designee will explain to each patient (or legally authorize d representative) the nature of the study, its 
purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits, and any 
discomfort the study may entail. Each patient will be informed that participation in the study is 
voluntary an d that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will 
not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician.  The patient 
will have as much time as he/she may need to make an informed  decision about the study and all 
treatment related questions will be answered. The consent discussion should occur in an exam room or a 
private area where it is just the research staff, the patient and his/her family/significant other(s) if 
desired.  
The i nformed consent will be given by [CONTACT_3553] a standard written statement, written in non -technical 
language. For those that cannot rea d, or are blind, the consenter will read the  consent form verbatim in 
the presence of a witness. The patient will read and c onsider the statement before signing and dating the 
document, and should be given a copy of the signed document. If the patient is unable to sign, make 
another kind of mark (like an X) to indicate consent. The person obtaining consent will document at the 
bottom of the consent form that the consent was read out loud to the patient by (name [CONTACT_665513]).  If an X or mark is used instead of a signature, the person obtaining consent will note 
on the consent form that the subject wrote a mark or  X instead of a signature.   The witness will sign the 
consent form. Subjects who do not read/understand English may be potentially enrolled following 
DUHS HRPP policy, including obtaining IRB approval of either a short form or long form consent 
translatio n. No patient will enter the study before his/her informed consent document has been obtained. 
Before, during, and after the consent is signed, the research team and investigators will be available in

26.0 Statistical Methods and Analytical Plans  
 
26.1. General Considerations  
 
STATISTIC AL CONSIDERATIONS : 
 
Sample size justification  
The primary objective of the phase II trial is to determine the proportion of early stage lung cancer patients 
with detectable circulating T cells specific against TAA after receiving platinum based neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy plus i pi[INVESTIGATOR_665426].  Based on Duke ICS assessments over the past 8 years,  
“detectable” circulating T cells with specificity against TAA are defined as a CD8, CD4, and DP 
(CD4+CD8+) lymphocyte percentage of ≥ 0.05% with each value also being at least twice that of the 
background unstimulated control value ( see Appendix B of the correlative science measures for additional 
details) . It was found that the proportion of patients before or without the treatment  with “detectable” 
circulating T cells specific  against TAA is 0 -1%. Let p be the true proportion of patients with “detectable”

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  circulating T cells at Collection 3 after receiving the protocol treatment ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665427]. For the 
purpose of sample size determination, we assume that the null hypoth esis H0: p<0.[ADDRESS_898758] the 
alternative hypothesis H1: p>0.20. With a sample size of [ADDRESS_898759] approximately 90% power to test the above hypothesis using a one -sided binomial test at a 
significance  level of 0.010. The null hypothesis H0 will be rejected if [ADDRESS_898760] TAA after the treatment.  Assuming a 5% screening failure 
rate, the study will enroll a total of 30 patients. A pa tient is deemed “evaluable” if the patient meets 
eligibility criteria, receives the protocol treatment ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665428] 3, and the 
levels of circulating T cells against TAA are measurable at Collection 3. All treated patients will b e 
evaluated for treatment related adverse events and followed for tumor response and disease free survival.  
 
Futility Analysis  
Futility analysis is often used for assessing clinical efficacy before the trial reaches target accrual and stops 
the trial earl y if the therapy clearly performs worse than control. The primary objective of this one -arm 
phase II trial is not to evaluate the efficacy of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665429]. Since it is unlikely that the 
therapy will harm the patients, a futility analysis o n the percentage of patients with detectable T -cells is 
unnecessary . 
   
Adverse event monitoring  
The first 12 treated patients will be evaluated for AE’s attributable to the preoperative treatment. Overall, if 
[ADDRESS_898761] 12 treated patients (> 25%) experience grade 3-5 non-hematologic adverse events 
(excluding diarrhea and rash) that are probably, possibly, or definitely related to the preoperative treatment, 
OR if the number of treatment -related deaths from the first  treatment until  [ADDRESS_898762] 12 patients (>17%), accrual to the study will be suspended to allow for 
investigation.  After consideration by [CONTACT_665504], a decision will be made as to whether 
accrual can be resumed, potentially with  modifications to entry criteria and/or study conduct.   In addition, 
all toxicity patterns will be monitored by [CONTACT_665505]. Postoperative ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665430].

exceeds 17%, and 2) if the cumulative percentage of all treated patients deemed unable to go to surgery due 
to adve rse events attributed to neoadjuvant therapy exceeds 20%.  The percentage of patients unable to go 
to surgery after chemotherapy is a conservative estimate based on data reported for a SWOG trial that 
studied neoadjuvant chemotherapy in early state lung ca ncer (22).  The trial will be stopped for accrual 
whenever a total of [ADDRESS_898764] one of the thresholds of the safety and feasibility 
criteria is exceeded. In the event either of these two thresholds is exceeded, the investigatio nal therapy will 
be considered “inf easible ” in this setting.  
 
 
 
 
Analytic methods  
The primary outcome will be analyzed using the evaluable patients as defined in the sample size 
justification section.  The exact binominal test will be used to test the incr ease in the proportion of patients 
with detectable circulating T cells specific against TAA after the treatment. The proportion will be 
estimated and its 2 -sided 98% confidence interval will be given to be consistent with the nominal 1 -sided 
significance level of 0.  01 used in the sample size justification.  All secondary objectives are considered 
exploratory in nature, and type I error will not be controlled for multiplicity. P -values for these statistical 
tests will be provided for descriptive purposes.  . All treated patients will be included in the analysis of 
adverse events.  
 
The following statistical analyses will be conducted on the secondary objectives:  
(1) Feasibility/tolerability of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665432].  Based on data 
provided by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_327757] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_327757]. J Clin Oncol. 2010 April 10; 28 (11): 1843 -1849), the following

Confidential: The information contained in this document is regarded as confidential and may not be disclosed to another part y unless such 
disclosure is required to initiate the study, to conduct study related activities, or t o comply with national, state or local laws and regulations. 
Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  criteria would be considered evidence of not feasible/tolerable: less than 75% of subjects receive 3 
cycles of preoperative therapy (i.e. receive  some amount of the expected study medications each cycle), 
“less than 80% of subjects undergo surgical exploration  within [ADDRESS_898765] cycle of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy” , more than 10% of subjects undergoing lobectomy have surgery -related 
mortality, or more than 20% of subjects experience dose -limiting toxicity during neoadjuvant therapy. 
Dose -limiting toxicity will be defined as  possibly, probably or definitely treatment -related :  ≥ Grade 4 
hematologic toxicity (excluding Grade 4 neutropen ia without fever or infection), or ≥ Grade 3 non -
hematologic toxicity (excluding grade 3 fatigue, nausea, vomiting, peripheral neuropathy, chemotherapy 
infusion reaction to carboplatin or paclitaxel).  
 
(2) Evaluate disease -free survival and patterns of me tastases after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665330]. Disease -free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from surgical 
resection to disease recurrence (first disease recurrence or death, whichever comes first) after surgery. The 
Kaplan-Meier estimator will be used to estimate median DFS and its 95% confidence interval. The 
frequencies of metastases by [CONTACT_665506].  
 
 (3)  The relationship between pathologic response and the RECIST response will be explored by [CONTACT_51445] 
a frequency cross -tabulation of pathologic versus RECIST response.  
 
 
The following exploratory objectives  will be conducted:  
 
(1) Determine the percentage of patients with “detectable” ( percentage of ≥ 0.05% with each value also 
being at least twice that of the background unstimulated control value)  tumor infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TILs) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. The percentage of patients with TILs for patients 
who have surgical resection and its 95% exact confidence interval will be est imated. See Appendix B of the 
correlative science measures for additional details on identifying TILs.  
 
(2) Estimate the  pathologic response rate for neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665433]. The definition of pathologic response rate  is given in section 16.3. The pathologic response rate 
along with its 95% exact confidence interval will be estimated.  
103 
Confidential: The information contained in this document is regarded as confidential and may not be disclosed to another part y unless such 
disclosure is required to initiate the study, to conduct study related activities, or t o comply with national, state or local laws and regulations. 
Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016   
(3) Estimate the objective response rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665433]. Best response rate is of in terest and tumor response will be evaluated from treatment initiation to 
prior to surgery. The definition of objective response will be measured by [CONTACT_393] 1.1. The objective 
response rate (ORR=CR+PR) along with its 95% exact confidence interval will be est imated.  
 
(4) Determine if the immunomodulatory effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665434], restoring functional reactivity to important anti -tumor effector cell populations.  
Functional TAA -specific T cell react ivities will be measured in the blood at four time points: Collection 1, 
2, 3 and 4. Changes in measures of anti -TAA reactivity (see Appendix B for details about these correlative 
science measures) across time points will be visualized using boxplots with the mean, median and 
interquartile range for each time point. For the phenotypic reactivity measures with background 
unstimulated negative control values  (from the ICS panel) , the percentage of patients with a positive 
response (a percentage value greater than the background unstimulated negative  control value) will be 
calculated.   A Wilcoxon  signed rank test will be used to test for differences from baseline, as well as for 
any association between each reactivity measure and pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy.  
 
(5) Explore an alternative definition for detectability suitable for expression values generated using Boolean 
gating, and determine the percentage of patients w ith circulating T cells meeting this definition.  The 
percentage of patients with circulating T cells meeting the new definition of detectable and its 95% exact 
confidence interval will be estimated.  See Appendix B for additional details about this outcom e measure.  
 
(6) Evaluate whether presence, quantity or quality of detectable TILs is associated with pathologic response 
to neoadjuvant therapy. Quality of TILs (also called relative polyfunctionality) is defined as ≥2 
functional marker values (out of 4) that meet the definition of detectable described in Objective 5. See 
Appendix B  for additional details about this outcome measure. A Fisher exact test will be used to evaluate 
the association of both the presence and the quality of TILs with pathologic tum or response to neoadjuvant 
therapy. A Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to test the association of the quantity of TILs and 
pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy.

identified using the following process:  
 
Whenever individual patient tumor tissue is available for analysis, the expression of 10 highly 
conserved TAA ’s (see Table I below) will be assessed using standard Real -Time (RT) PCR 
technology. Peptide pools represent ing the three most highly expressed TAA ’s by [CONTACT_665509] -specific stimulators for PBMC isolated from the same patient at the [ADDRESS_898776] commonly expressed TAA ’s on NSCLC, namely Survivin, PRAME, 
and MAGE -A3, will be chosen as antigen -specific stimulators . 
 
The percentage of CD4, CD8, and double positive (DP=CD4+/CD8+) lymphocytes with 
specificity against the three  selected TAA ’s,  will be calculated for each of 4 individual 
functional markers (IL -2, TNF -α, IFN -γ, and CD107 underlined below).  For each peripheral 
blood collection, the lab will generate a total of 12 lymphocyte values (4 values each for CD4, 
CD8 and DP) for each of the three TAA’s and for CD3/CD28  (used as a positive control), as 
well as generating 12 background  unstimulated negative control  values.  All values will be

Confidential: The information contained in this document is regarded as confidential and may not be disclosed to another part y unless such 
disclosure is required to initiate the study, to conduct study related activities, or t o comply with national, state or local laws and regulations. 
Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  Using the same methods noted above, 12 lymphocyte percentage values (functional markers) for 
the 3 selected TAA’s w ill also be generated from tumor tissue collected at surgery, and in this 
context are called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).  These values will be used to determine 
the percentage of patients with any detectable TILs (exploratory objective 1).  Expr ession 
percentage values for each T cell (CD4, CD8, and DP) will also be collected corresponding to 
each combination of the 4 functional markers (excluding the combination where all four markers 
are negative) using Boolean gating. These 135 values (15 valu es * 3 T cells * 3 TAA’s) will be 
used to determine a definition of detectability suitable for these measures to avoid missing 
potential positive values, and to determine the percentage of patients with ≥1 of the 135 values 
satisfying the new definition of  detectable circulating T cells (exploratory objective 5).  In 
addition, this definition will also be used to explore whether the presence, quantity or quality of 
TILs is associated with pathologic response (exploratory objective 6).   
 
* Boolean gating will be performed to calculate percentage values corresponding to the 
following combinations of T cells and functional markers (excluding the combination 
where all 4 markers are negative):  
 
* %CD4 +/CD69+/ -IL-2+ or -TNF -α+ or -IFN-γ+ or -CD107 + or -

* %DP+/CD69+/ -IL-2+ or -TNF -α+ or -IFN-γ+ or -CD107 + or - 
 
For exploratory outcome 4, changes in all  measures of anti -TAA reactivity listed below across time 
points will be analyzed, as well as how these  values relate to pathologic response .   In addition, for 
the  phenotypic reactivity measures with background unstimulated negative  control values  (those 
from the ICS panel) , the percentage of patients with a positive response (a percentage value 
greater t han the background unstimulated negative  control value) will be calculated.   The 
distribution of the changes will b e estimated with a boxplot and the median (mean) change will 
be calculated by [CONTACT_665510] (yes/no).

well as activated and exhausted T cells.  
 
 
Blood volumes and collection time points:  
 
 At each blood collection, 4 tubes of 8.5 -ml each will be collected. The tubes used will be ACD

Appendix G   Tumor  Tissue  Specimen for correlative sciences  
 
SURGICAL SPECIMEN  
 
Patients will be approached to participate in the “DUHS Biospecimen Repository and Processing Core 
(BRPC)” eIRB [ZIP_CODE] protocol prior to surgery.  Tissue will be collected and released as described in this 
protocol to ensure proper involvement of pathology to minimize the chance that a tissue collection event 
interferes with appropriate clinical tissue processin g and diagnosis.  
 
 
PRINCIPLE:  
Lung tissue is harvested in the frozen section or gross dissection area of the surgical pathology suite.  The 
tissue is first examined by a certified anatomic pathologist or surrogate (resident, pathology assistant). 
Relevant margins are inked, removed and examined by [CONTACT_665481], if necessary. It is imperative 
that harvesting tissue for use in research trials does not impede accurate initial assessment of critical features 
of the tumor resection, most notably margi n status.  After the specimen has been processed for margin 
status, the frozen section assessment of the specimen is complete, a specimen of excess tumor will be 
released and acquired by [CONTACT_665511].   
 
 
SPECIMEN: Lung resection specimen  
 
LOCATION: Surgical Pathology Suite  
 
QUALITY CONTROL:  
Lab guidelines for safe handling of all samples must be followed. All tubes used for specimen processing 
must be labeled with the unique patient identifier or sample number before transfer of the tissue sample.

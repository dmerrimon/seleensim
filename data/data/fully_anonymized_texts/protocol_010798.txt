A Phase 2 Study of Clofarabine, Idarubi cin, Cytarabine, Vincristine, and 
Corticosteroids for Patients with Newly Diagnosed or Relapsed Mixed Phenotype 
Acute Leukemia 
 
I. Objectives 
Primary:  
To evaluate the response rate of the c hemotherapy regimen in  patients with mixed 
phenotype acute leukemia 
Secondary:  
To evaluate the durability of response, the ov erall and event-free surv ival rates, and the 
safety profile of the regimen 
 
II. Rationale  The diagnosis of acute leukemia is typi[INVESTIGATOR_633499], 
immunophenotype, karyotype, and molecular f eatures of blast cells found in the bone 
marrow. Most often, the leukemia is clearly assigned to one of the following specific 
lineages: B-lymphoid, T-lymphoi d, or myeloid. Diagnosis is usually unequivocally acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML), or acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). ALL is further delineated 
into B- or T-cell groups. The therapeutic re gimen is often designed based on the lineage 
of the leukemia. Nevertheless, rarely a patient cannot be readily classified due to 
immunophenotypic evidence of multiple lineages within the cell population [1]. 
Throughout the years, these leukemias have been referred to by a number of names, 
including mixed lineage leukemia, biphenotypic  leukemia, bilineal leukemia, hybrid 
leukemia, undifferentiated leukemia, or  leukemia of ambiguous lineage. This 
terminology has been used to describe leukem ias with a single po pulation of cells 
expressing markers from multiple lineages, as well as leukemias exhibiting two distinct 
blast populations each belonging to a distin ct lineage. In 2008, the World Health 
Protocol 2013-[ADDRESS_845959] 8, 2019 
2 
 
Organization (WHO) grouped these proce sses together under t he heading mixed 
phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) [2].  
The definition of MPAL has evolved over the years, but most now accept the WHO 
definition published in 2008 [2]. Briefly, a blast population is myeloid if there is sufficient 
present of myeloperoxidase (MPO) or mono cytic differentiation is present. The T 
lineage is defined by [CONTACT_633515]3. To assign the B 
lineage, a combination of the expression of several markers is used, including CD19, 
CD79a, CD22, and CD10.  
There is no standard therapy for the group of patients diagnosed with MPAL, and the 
situation presents a clinical  challenge that has not been well studied. Most experience 
to date comes from the pediat ric literature and from older case series. Killick and 
colleagues identified 25 cases of  “biphenotypic” leukemia of 693 cases (3.6%) of acute 
leukemia over an 8 year period [3]. This c ohort included pediatric patients as young as 3 
years of age, and adults up to age 46. A wide variety of induction regimens were used, 
including conventional ALL induction, conventi onal AML induction, as well regimens that 
used agents typi[INVESTIGATOR_633500]. Median overall survival (OS) for the 20 de novo patients was 27.3 weeks, which is ve ry poor considering a median age of 25.5 
years. Importantly, severa l patients also had the Ph iladelphia chromosome, and 
treatment was before t he era of tyrosine kina se inhibitors.   
Recently, a group from Saudi Arabia describ ed the clinical characteristics and outcome 
of 24 pediatric patients diagnosed with MPAL [4 ]. All patients were treated uniformly 
with a modified St. Jude Total Therapy-B HR r egimen, which that group uses to treat 
high risk ALL [5]. This regimen involves at least six drugs with activity against lymphoid and myeloid leukemias. All pat ients were also considered for allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation (alloSCT) in first complete remission (CR) . For patients not undergoing 
alloSCT, maintenance therapy was continued fo r 2.5 years. With a median follow up of 
four years, the survival wa s 75.7%, which is excellent, but must be interpreted keepi[INVESTIGATOR_633501] 2013-[ADDRESS_845960]. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_633502] e leukemias [6]. Thirty-five 
patients were treated, and t he median age was 10. Overall, 23 patients received AML 
induction (daunorubicin, cytarabine, etoposi de), and [ADDRESS_845961] ALL induction 
(vincristine, daunorubicin, L-asparaginase, pr ednisone). Patients receiving AML or ALL 
induction regimens up front achieved CR rates of 52% and 83%, respectively. Eighty 
percent of the patients not achieving CR after AML induction subsequently went into CR after ALL induction. The 5-year OS for patient s with B/Myeloid or T/ Myeloid was 47.8%.  
There is very little reported in the liter ature on adults with MPAL, and as a referral 
center, we may encounter these patients more often th at other institutions. A 
contemporary regimen empl oying drugs active agains t both myeloid and lymphoid 
leukemias may be the optimal approach. AM L is generally treated with anthracyclines 
combined with cytarabine [7-9]. Recently, the addition of a cladribine, a purine analog, 
to standard AML induction improved the surv ival of younger patients with newly 
diagnosed disease [10]. Clofarabine is also a purine analog that was rationally designed 
to optimize the pharmacologic shortcomings of two of its predecessors, fludarabine and 
cladribine [11]. The drug works through seve ral mechanisms including inhibition of 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerases, inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, and 
induction of apoptosis via DNA strand breaks and disruption of mi tochondrial integrity 
[11]. Clofarabine is currently approved for pedi atric patients with re lapsed and refractory 
acute lymphoid leukemia after failure of tw o previous regimens [12].When administered 
three to six hours prior to cytarabine, in vitro both drugs induce a synergistic effect 
against AML cells, possibly due to the ability of clofarabine to efficaciously block ribonucleotide reductase [13]. These data have formed the basis for several clinical 
studies that we and others have conducted in an attempt to exploit this relationship, and hence, improve AML outcomes [14]. Currently , our frontline AML in duction regimen of 
choice is a combination of clofarabine, cytarabine, and idarubicin.   
Protocol 2013-[ADDRESS_845962] 8, 2019

The frontline strategy for t he management of adult ALL is  similar to pediatrics, and 
involves induction chemotherapy, multiple  rounds of consolidation, a prolonged 
maintenance phase, as well as central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. Most 
protocols call for approximately [ADDRESS_845963] involve the same key agents which 
include vincristine, anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin or daunorubicin), corticosteroids 
(e.g., prednisone or dexamethasone), with or  without some form of L-asparaginase [15-
17]. One such regimen is the hyperCVAD, which employs the co mbination of hyper-
fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincrist ine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone 
alternating with high dose methotrexate and cytarabine [18, 19]. Cycles are repeated 
approximately monthly for 8 cycles, a point at  which patients move to the maintenance 
portion of the regimen with daily mercapt opurine, monthly vincristine, weekly 
methotrexate, and monthly pulses of prednisone (POMP). Long term outcomes have 
been published previously, with five  year overall survival (OS) of 38%. Survival was 
influenced by [CONTACT_633516] t hat were assessed using multivariable 
analysis. This is comparable to a number of other regimens that are used depending on 
center preference. 
At the M.D. Anderson Cancer  Center (MDACC), MPAL has  traditionally been treated 
with AML induction regimens. It may be optim al to also administer agents that are 
predominantly used against ALL. Therefore, we are proposing to use a hybrid regimen, 
with components of both AML and ALL therapy, to treat pati ents diagnosed with MPAL 
at MDACC. The backbone of the regimen wi ll be our standard induction for AML, 
clofarabine, idarubicin, and cyt arabine administered at attenuated doses. Importantly, all 
three of these drugs also have activity agai nst ALL. In addition, we will add vincristine 
and corticosteroids to the regimen for enhanc ed lymphoid activity. These are ideal 
candidates for addition to the regimen for a num ber of reasons. First, the toxicity profiles 
do not overlap, allowing us to safely give  all five agents during the same course of 
therapy. Second, corticosteroids are rout inely used as a premedication to prevent 
toxicity induced by [CONTACT_633517], albeit at lower doses.

V. Treatment Plan 
1. Study Design This will be a phase II, single center, open label  trial to assess the safety and efficacy of 
the regimen outlined below. Patients will be eligib le if they are newly diagnosed or with 
relapsed disease, though these groups wil l be analyzed separatel y. We anticipate 
enrolling 10 – [ADDRESS_845975] of the patient. 2. Induction 
 Clofarabine 15 mg/m
2 IV daily over approximately 60 minutes for 4 days on days 
1 – 4 (for 3 days on days 1-3 for pa tients 61 – 80 years of age or with 
performance status (PS) of 2 or 3) 
 Idarubicin 10 mg/m2 IV over approximately 30 – 60 minutes daily for 3 days on 
days 1 – 3 (for 2 days on days 1-2 for pat ients 61-80 years of age or with PS 2 or 
3) 
o To start 1 – 2 hours after the clofarabine  
 Cytarabine 1,000 mg/m2 IV over approximately 2 hours daily for 4 days on days 1 
– 4 (for 3 days on days 1-3 for patients 61 – 80 years of age or with PS 2 or 3) 
o To start 3 – [ADDRESS_845976] 8, 2019 
14 
 
 Vincristine 2 mg (FLAT dose) IV over  approximately 15 – 30 minutes on days 1, 
8, and 15 
 Dexamethasone 40 mg IV daily for 4 days on days 1 – 4 and days 15 – 18  
o May be given 30 – 60 minutes prior to each dose of cytarabine during 
induction on days 1 – 4 (if rituximab given, can administer dexamethasone 
prior to rituximab on day 1) 
For patients with CD20 positive disease (> 10%  of the lymphoid population), rituximab 
may be added to the regimen as follows: 
 Rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV infused according to packa ge labeling on days [ADDRESS_845977]/prescribing 
information to prevent infusion related reactions. 
The doses and schedule can be modified for the following situations: 
 For patients 61 – 80 years of age or with performance status of 2 or 3: give 
clofarabine and cytarabine for 3 days; give idarubicin for 2 days as mentioned 
above.  
 Further dose reductions or modifications  can be considered after discussion with 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_633503]’s medical record 
Protocol 2013-[ADDRESS_845978] 8, 2019 
15 
 
 All patients will receive at least one lu mbar puncture during the first cycle of 
induction. This is for diagnosis as well as for the application of prophylactic 
intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexa te 12 mg or cytarabine 100 mg). 
 The standard for ALL patients is to administer [ADDRESS_845979] four cycles.  
 For this protocol, giving more than  one intrathecal treatment will be at the 
discretion of the managing physician. This degree of flexibility is warranted due to the heterogeneity of patients with MPAL. 
Patients, who have not achieved a complete remission (CR)/complete remission without platelet (CRi) recovery following one inducti on course can receive a second induction 
course to optimize response if possible. A second induction course at the same dose as 
the previous course or in a dose-reduced fa shion should not be given until at least 28 
days of course 1. If the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_633504]/or biopsy(s) performed after the re-
induction cycle reveals a remission marrow ( CR/CRi), then the patient may proceed with 
consolidation at the discreti on of the treating investigator. In addition, any clinically 
significant drug-related, non-hematologic toxici ty experienced by a patient should return 
to ≤ grade [ADDRESS_845980] achieved a remission, incl uding CR and CRi after the re-induction 
course, he/she will be taken off study for fa ilure to respond, unless the patient has 
Protocol 2013-[ADDRESS_845981] 8, 2019 
16 
 
achieved clinical benefit or partial remission,  at which time further therapy on protocol 
may be permitted with appr oval from the PI. 
3. Consolidation 
Patients in CR or CRi can continue with up to 6 consolidation cycles. 
 Clofarabine 15 mg/m2 IV daily over approximately 60 minutes for  3 days on days 
1 – 3 (for 2 days on days 1-2 in patients 61 – 80 years of age or  with PS 2 or 3) 
 Idarubicin 6 mg/m2 IV over 30 – 60 minutes daily for  2 days on days 1 – 2 (3 
mg/m2 for 2 days on days 1-2 in patients 61- 80 years of age or with PS 2 or 3) 
o To start 1 – 2 hours after the clofarabine  
 Cytarabine 1,000 mg/m2 IV over approximately 2 hours daily for  3 days on days 
1 – 3 (for 2 days on days 1-2 in patients 61 – 80 years of age or  with PS 2 or 3) 
o To start 3 – 6 hours after the clofarabine  
 Vincristine 2 mg (FLAT dose) IV ov er 15 – 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 
 Dexamethasone 40 mg IV daily for 4 days on days 1 – 4 and days 15 – 18  
o May be given 30 – 60 minutes prior to each dose of cytarabine during 
consolidation on days 1 – 3 (if rituximab given, can administer dexamethasone prior to rituximab on day 1) 
For patients with CD20 positive disease (> 10% of the lymphoid population), rituximab 
may be added to the regimen as follows during consolidati on cycles 1 – 3:  
 Rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV infused according to package labeling on days [ADDRESS_845982]/prescribing 
information to prevent infusion related reactions. 
The doses and schedule can be modified for the following situations: 
 For patients 61 – 80 years of age or with performance status of 2 or 3: give 
clofarabine and cytarabine for 2 days; give idarubicin 3 mg/m2 for 2 days as 
mentioned above.  
 Further dose reductions can be cons idered after discussion with the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_633505] 3 to 10 w eeks based on leukemia response and 
resolution of clinically significant drug-rela ted toxicities. Prior to each consolidation 
cycle, the ANC should be > 1.0 x 109/L, and the platelet count should be > 60 x 109/L 
(except for patients who are considered to have achieved a CRp following induction/re-
induction and in whom the platelet count may be lower). Patients with borderline values 
for ANC and platelet count (value up to 10% lower than recommended) can still proceed 
with the next consolidation cycle if this is j udged to be in the best interest of the patients 
and after discussion with the principal inve stigator and the discussion documented in 
the patient’s medical record. In addition, any clinically significant drug-related non-
hematologic toxicity experienced by [CONTACT_54890] < grade [ADDRESS_845983] severe toxicity and based on the drug causing the toxicity. 
4. Dose Modifications 
Drug doses in subsequent consol idation cycles may be modified for clinically significant 
drug-related > grade [ADDRESS_845984] for the 
patient and after discussion with the pr incipal investigator and the discussion 
documented in the patient’s medical record .  Doses of each individual drug can be 
modified if a toxicity is considered due this particular drug. 
The following are suggestions for dose modifica tions in subsequent treatment courses: 
 Persistent neutropenia (< 1,000) or th rombocytopenia (< 50,000)  greater than 42 
days from previous cycle: reduce doses of clofarabine, cytarabine and idarubicin 
by 20 – 25% 
 Clinically significant peripheral ne uropathy persisting for > 2 weeks:  
- 50% reduction of vincristine (1 mg) for Grade 2 persistent neuropathy 
- Eliminate vincristine for Grade 3- 4 neuropathy, seizures and Ileus 
suspected to be related to vincristine

5. Targeted therapy 
Approximately a third of pat ients with AML may harbor acti vating FLT3-ITD mutations; 
such mutations are also observed in pati ents with biphenotypic  or mixed lineage 
leukemias.  We have previously shown that  combining sorafenib with chemotherapy in 
patients with FLT3-ITD mutations is both sa fe and efficacious. (R avandi et. al. JCO 
2010). Therefore, patients with known FLT3-ITD mutations will be allowed to receive 
sorafenib therapy at a dose of 400mg orally twice daily on days 1-[ADDRESS_845986] of care and at the discret ion of the treating physician. These agents will require a 
separate consent to be completed by [CONTACT_622592]. Suggested dose adjustments 
are in the table below. 
Recently, the phase III randomized double-blin d RATIFY study was completed and 
reported for patients with FLT3 mutated AML (Stone RM, et al. NEJM 2017) .  717 
patients with FLT3 mutated AML were randomi zed to receive araC + daunorubicin with 
or without midostaurin.  Midostaurin led to a significant improvement in survival (median 
74.7 months for midostaurin vs. 25.6 for placebo; P=0.007).  Based on this study, 
midostaurin was approved for the treatment of patients with FLT3 mutated AML in 
combination with chemotherapy, the first combination to s how a survival benefit in 
several decades.  This has now become part of the standard of care in the treatment of 
FLT3-mutated AML.  Midostaurin  has the additional benefit of targeting not only FLT3-
ITD mutations, but also point mutations in t he FLT3 kinase, such as D835 mutations.  
Therefore, AML patient s with known FLT3-ITD or FLT3 kinase domain mutations will be 
allowed to receive midostaurin at the recommended dose of 50mg or ally twice daily on 
days 6-[ADDRESS_845987] 8, 2019

Other FDA-approved FLT3 inhibito rs or targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g . IDH1 or IDH2 inhibitors) 
are allowed at the discretion of  the treating physician and afte r discussion with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_633508]. 
Patients with the presence of t he Philadelphia chromosome [tr anslocation (9;22)] or the 
presence of the bcr-abl fusion gene (detect ed by [CONTACT_633520]) – such as those with 
CML myeloid blast phase or ‘Philadelphia-positive AML’ – may benefit from concomitant 
therapy with an abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (T KI).  Several orally bioavailable TKIs have 
now been FDA approved for Philadelphia positive  CML and their selection is based on 
patient tolerance, comorbidities, and abl ki nase domain mutations.  Patients with bcr-abl 
positive disease may receive concomitant therapy with an approved TKI, dosed orally, 
Protocol 2013-[ADDRESS_845988] practice. 
 
 
6. Central Nervous System (CNS) Prophylaxis and Treatment 
All patients will receive at least one lumbar puncture during the first cycle of induction. 
This is for diagnosis as well as for t he application of prophy lactic intrathecal 
chemotherapy (methotrexate 12 mg or cytarabine 100 mg).

Patients who are diagnosed with CNS disease at any point (cytologically or 
radiographically) will be managed according to the departmental standard of care with 
intensive intrathecal c hemotherapy treatment.  
7. Maintenance Therapy 
Maintenance or continuation ch emotherapy for up to [ADDRESS_845990] not included maintenance therapy. 
Therefore, maintenance  therapy after the completion of  consolidation will be at the 
discretion of the managing physician. Ta rgeted therapy will continue during 
maintenance per t he managing physician.

procedures/observations. 
 Relapse unless the treating physician det ermines that the patient has achieved 
clinical benefit, at which time furthe r therapy on protocol  may be permitted with 
approval from the PI.  
 Failure to achieve at least a CRi after 2 induction courses 
 
IX. CRITERIA FOR RESPONSE 
The response criteria recommended by t he NCI and the MDS International Working 
Group. Definitions: 
Complete Response (CR): 
 Neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 ×10
9/L 
 Platelet count ≥ 100 ×109/L 
 Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] < 5% blasts 
 No extramedullary leukemia 
CRi: 
 Response as in CR but platelets <100 ×109/L

 XI. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Protocol 2013-[ADDRESS_846000] 8, 2019

This is a Phase II study of clofarabine, idarubicin, cytarabine, vincristine, and 
corticosteroids for patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory mixed 
phenotype acute leukemia 
The primary objective is to evaluate the ef ficacy, with primary endpoint of response (CR 
or CRi) during a 2 month window.  The tw o groups of patients will be evaluated 
separately; however accrual to  both groups will be concurrent. 
Part I: Newly diagnosed patients 
A maximum of 40 newly diagnosed will be enrolle d. The toxicity, 4-week mortality rate, 
and efficacy (response) will be monitored during the study, and all the data will be used 
to update the prior distributions for toxicity  and efficacy parameters. The study will be 
stopped for toxicity, 4-week mortality and fut ility based on the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].   
1.[ADDRESS_846001] treatment for the study patient is about 50%, it is anticipated that with the study treatment the response 
rate will increase to 70%.   
Response will be monitored closely in all patient s using the method of Thall et al (20).  
The interim monitoring will begin after [ADDRESS_846002] 
treatment and this experimental study by P
S  and P E, respectively  We assume P S ~ 
beta(50, 50) to reflect the hi storical response rate and P E ~ beta (1, 1), which have the

same response rate but a bigger various.  We will stop the trial if at any point Pr (P E > 
PS  + 0.2 | data) < 0.01. That is, we will stop the trial if, at any time during the study, we 
determine that there is less than 1% chance t hat the response rate in the study is 20% 
more than that of  the standard treatment. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_633510] 1a and 1b respectively. For 
example, if [ADDRESS_846004] response to the treatment, 
then the 95% credible interval for t he response rate will be (0.54, 0.82).

Up to 20 relapsed/refractory patients who have no other treatment options will be 
enrolled in the study. The descriptive analys is will be used to summarize the response 
data, and the Kaplan-Meier method will be applied to estimate the median survival and 
1-year survival rate. The study will monitor the 4-week mortality and toxicity use the 
method of Thall et al (1995).

Title of Study: The effect  of chemotherapy and  stereotactic body radiation  therapy for locally  advanced,  
non-resectable pancreatic cancer  
Schema: Eligible  primary locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer.  Patients will 
be treated with chemotherapy and SBRT  to 4000cGy delivered in 5 fractions  over  14 days.
Primary objective:   To estimate toxicity and  efficacy
Protocol No.: BCC-RAD-13-chemotherapy and SBRT
Investigators: Neal E Dunlap and Rebecca Redman
Study Center: James Graham Brown  Cancer Center
Study Duration:  Approximately  48 months
41.  Background
Pancreatic cancer  remains the fourth leading  cause of cancer deaths in the United  States 
(1).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_68518],  surgical 
ressection remains the  only modality  associated  with long-term survival (2).  
Approximately 40-50% of pancreatic cancer patients  present  with localized yet  
unresectable disease  with a reported median  survival  of 6 – 14 months.  These  results  vary based  
on the patient  characteristics, intensity of treatment regimen and those with  borderline resectable 
disease (3-7).  Although the Gastrointestinal  study group  established  the standard of care as 
combined modality  treatment with chemotherapy  and radiation, the most appropriate method for 
integrating radiation into the treatment  regimen  remains unestablished  especially  with the 
introduction of newer, more  intense chemotherapy  regimems.   Data  using combined modality 
therapy typi[INVESTIGATOR_68519] 40-50%, but the  role of multi-modality  
therapy is not well  defined.  Recent  data from  the Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG) 
demonstated that radiation of  50.4Gy in combination  with gemcitabine improves median survival 
compared to  gemcitabine alone  (8).  
Although many people ultimately fail distantly,  locoregional control remains  an 
important aspect of treatment due  to the significant  impact on morbidity and quality of life.  
Attempts have been made to  increase radiaiton dose or hypofractionate radiation dose to  improve  
outcome varying reults.  Recent  advances in radiation therapy delivery using image-guidance 
and high dose  delivery with stereotactic body radiation therapy  have  resulted  in the potential of 
dose escalation to the  primary tumor.  Schellenberg  et al. (9)  demonstated that  single fraction  
SBRT with gemcitabine showed local control rates of 82% with a median follow up of 22 
months.  Only  2 patients developed late grade 3 toxicity (12%) in  the form of duodenal  stricture  
requiring stent placement.  Similarly, Mahadevan  et al (10) showed a  3-fraction SBRT regimen 
in combination with gemcitabine resulted  in local  control rates of 78% with  14% grade [ADDRESS_75066] majority of patients will ultimately die of metastatic disease.  Single-agent 
gemcitabine and  gemcitabine-based doublets were  the mainstay of treatment for metastatic 
pancreatic cancer until recently, although median survival rarely exceeded 8 months  and 
objective response rates were generally  less than 20% (11-14).  However,  a randomized phase III 
study conducted by [CONTACT_68527]. (15) demonstrated  that combination chemotherapy consisting 
of fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and  oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX)  significantly improved 
median survival  to 11.1 months  as compared to 6.8 months in those treated with  single-agent 
gemcitabine.  Treatment-related toxicity was also increased with  FOLFIRINOX,  primarily 
gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), cytopenias, and neuropathy.  In addition, the objective response rate  was 32% as compared to 9% with gemcitabine.  As a  result of this  study, 
FOLFIRINOX is  now widely accepted as a standard first-line therapy for patients with  locally  
advanced and unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who  have a good 
performance status.  The influence of irinotecan on the efficacy  of FOLFIRINOX  is unknown as  
a similar response rate was reported in a single-arm study of 30 patients receiving infusional 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (16).  Since the metabolism of irinotecan is primarily hepatic, FOLFOX is an  acceptable  alternative, particularly in patients with an abnormal 
bilirubin.   Gemcitabine and nab (nanoparticle albumin bound)-paclitaxel represents  an 
alternative option for first-line treatment  based upon results of a  multicenter, randomized study 
5of 861 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer,  which demonstrated superiority of this 
combination over gemcitabine  alone  (17).  Median  overall survival in  the gemcitabine  and nab-
paclitaxel arm was 8.5 months with an objective response rate  of 23%.   Although  median 
survival was shorter than that reported  with FOLFIRINOX,  it remains an acceptable alternative  
for patients with  biliary obstruction or for  those deemed not to be  a candidate for 
FOLFIRINOX.
The objective of this phase II  study is  to combine  chemotherapy with  5 fraction SBRT in  
patients with locally advanced,  non-resectable pancreatic  cancer  in order to  determine treatment 
toxicity and efficacy.  
62.  Objectives  and Study Design
The objective of this prospective phase II  protocol is to assess the  toxicity  and efficacy of 
chemotherapy with 5 fraction SBRT in patients with locally advanced, non-resectable pancreatic  
cancer in order to document treatment toxicity and estimate efficacy.

2.1.1. To document treatment related toxicities
2.1.2. Establish the  efficacy of treatment
2.2 Secondary Objectives:
2.2.1.   To estimate progression free survival
2.2.2.   To estimate local failure
2.2.3.   To estimate overall survival
2.2.4.   To estimate quality of life
2.2.5.   To explore effects  of covariates (demographics, disease and  treatment  related) on 
toxicity, local  failure,  PFS and OS and QOL.
2.2.6. To explore the use of differential scanning calorimetry as a method for monitoring 
disease status
2.3  Study  design:

4. Treatment
 4.1 External Beam  Radiation
4.1.1.  Localization,  Positioning and Immobilization:
A volumetric planning CT study will be required to define the gross tumor volume (GTV)  and planning target volume (PTV).  Each patient will be  
8positioned in an  immobilization device  in the  treatment position on a flat  
table.  Contiguous CT slices of  1-[ADDRESS_75071]:  The use of 4-D CT radiation treatment planning is  required  on all      
patients.  Acceptable methods for acquiring  tumor motion include:  design  
of the PTV to cover  the excursion of the primary cancer and  nodes during 
breathing such  as an ITV  approach, a maximum intensity  projection  (MIP) 
approach or a gating approach.
4.1.3   Treatment planning:  Treatment  planning will be performed using 
either  conformal therapy  or intensity modulated radiation therapy 
(IMRT).  Cyberknife treatment is allowed.  Any combination of coplanar  
or non-coplanar fields designed to cover the target volumes while  limiting  
dose to critical  structures is allowed.   Composite dosimetry plans  of the 
prior treatment volume and the new  treatment plan will be  generated if 
prior dosimetry is available.  Standard  SBRT treatment planning  should be 
utilized.  Successful treatment planning should attempt to  meet  the 
following:
-Normalization:  The plan should be normalized such that 100% 
corresponds to the center  of mass of the  PTV
-Prescription Isodose  Surface Coverage:  The prescription isodose 
surface will be  chosen such that 95%  of the PTV is conformally 
covered by [CONTACT_68528] 99% of the PTV  
receives a minimum  of 90% of the dose.
4.1.4.  Critical structures and dose limits:  Standard  dose constraints  to critical
structures will be  utilized for and  SBRT  as outlined by [CONTACT_68529] (QUANTEC)
4.1.5.  Treatments:   3200cGy delivered in [ADDRESS_75072].
4.2 Chemotherapy
4.2.1 Patients will receive one of the following chemotherapy  regimens  at the  
discretion of the treating physician:
FOLFIRINOX administered intravenously on day 1 of each 14-day cycle 
for 4 cycles:   
 Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 over  2 hours
 Leucovorin 400 mg/m2 over 2 hours
9 Irinotecan 180 mg/m2 over  90 minutes, concurrent with  leucovorin  
through a  Y-connector, started 30 minutes  into leucovorin infusion  
(Irinotecan may be  omitted at the  discretion of the treating 
physician.  Reason for  omission should be  noted.)
 Fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 iv push
 Fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 over  46 hours
-OR-
Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of each  28-day cycle:
 Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 over  30 minutes
 Nab-Paclitaxel 125  mg/m2 over 30 mnutes
See Appendix A  for suggested chemotherapy dose modifications.
4.2.2 Chemotherapy dose rounding allowed  per institution protocol as long as 
rounded dose is within 10% of calculated  dose.
4.2.3 BSA should  not be  capped.  Actual  weight  should be  used.  Recalculation  
of BSA  and drug doses is required if patient  has a 10% or greater change 
in weight from  previously  calculated doses.
4.2.4 Antiemetic  regimen:  A standard,  FDA-approved antiemetic regimen  will 
be administered to patients prior  to the start of chemotherapy at the 
discretion of the treating oncologist.   An example of such a regimen 
includes a  5HT [ADDRESS_75073]  and dexamethasone.  
4.2.5 Growth factor  support  is recommended  with FOLFIRINOX, but not  
required.  If not administered as primary prophylaxis and ANC < 1500 on day 1 of  any cycle,  the addition of growth factor support and/or dose 
reduction is strongly encouraged  with subsequent cycles.
4.2.[ADDRESS_75074].  Examples include prevention/treatment of delayed nausea,  
diarrhea, and fever.  The prophylactic  administration  of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 0.5 mg 
IV is strongly encouraged to prevent  or decrease symptoms of  the 
cholinergic syndrome associated with irinotecan.
4.2.7 Pharmaceutical Data:
1. Oxaliplatin
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Mechnism of  action: Oxaliplatin, a  platinum  derivative, 
is an alkylating agent.  Following intracellular 
hydrolysis, the platinum  compound binds  to DNA  
forming cross-links which  inhibit DNA replication  and 
10transcription, resulting in cell death. Cytotoxicity is cell-cycle nonspecific.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Preparation/Administration: Do not freeze and protect from light the  concentrated  solution.  A final dilution  
must never be performed  with a sodium chloride 
solution or other chloride-containing  solutions.  The 
solution must  be further  diluted  in an infusion solution 
of 250-500 mL  of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.  After 
final dilution, protection from light is not required.  Oxaliplatin is incompatible in solution with alkaline  
medications or media (such as  basic solutions of  5-
fluorouracil) and must  not be mixed with these  or 
administered simultaneously through the same infusion 
line. The infusion line  should be flushed with 5%  
Dextrose Injection, USP prior to administration of  any 
concomitant medication.
2. Irinotecan
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Mechanism of action: Irinotecan and its active metabolite (SN-38) bind reversibly  to topoisomerase I-
DNA complex preventing religation  of the cleaved 
DNA strand. This results  in the  accumulation of  
cleavable complexes and  double-strand DNA  breaks. 
As mammalian  cells  cannot  efficiently repair these  
breaks, cell death consistent with S-phase cell cycle  
specificity occurs, leading  to termination  of cellular 
replication.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Preparation/Administration: Irinotecan  should be 
diluted in 5%  Dextrose Injection, USP,  (preferred) or 
0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to a final concentration range  of 0.12  mg/mL to 2.8 mg/mL. 
Other drugs should not  be added  to the infusion 
solution.
3. Fluorouracil
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Mechanism of action: A pyrimidine analog antimetabolite that interferes  with DNA and RNA 
synthesis; after activation, F-UMP (an  active 
metabolite) is incorporated into RNA  to replace  uracil 
and inhibit cell growth; the active metabolite F-dUMP,  
inhibits thymidylate synthetase, depleting  thymidine 
triphosphate (a necessary component of DNA synthesis).
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Preparation/Administration: Fluorouracil  Injection, 
USP is  available  for intravenouse use in 10 mL vials. 
Each mL  contains 50 mg (available  as 500 mg/10  mL)  
11of fluorouracil in a  colorless to faint yellow  aqueous  
solution.  If a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_68520], resolubilize  by [CONTACT_68530] 140°F  and 
shaking vigorously; allow  to cool  to body temperature 
before using.   Do not refrigerate or freeze. Protect from 
light.
4. Leucovorin
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Mechanism of action: Stabilizes the  binding of 5-dUMP  
and thymidylate synthetase, enhancing the  activity  of 
fluorouracil.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Preparation/Administration: Reconstitute  the 
lyophilized vial products with Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (benzyl alcohol preserved), or Sterile Water for Injection, USP.  Because of the calcium content of the leucovorin solution,  no more than 160 
mg of leucovorin should be injected intravenously per minute (16 mL  of a 10 mg/mL, or 8 mL of a 20 mg/mL 
solution per  minute).   Leucovorin  should not be mixed 
in the same infusion as 5-fluorouracil,  since this may 
lead to the formation  of a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047].
5. Gemcitabine
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Mechanism of action: A pyrimidine antimetabolite that inhibits DNA synthesis by [CONTACT_68531], cell cycle-specific for  the S-phase of the cycle (also blocks  
cellular progression  at G1/S-phase). 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Preparation/Administration: Reconstitute  in NS without 
preservatives to yield  a concentration of 38 mg/mL; 
further dilute with NS prior to administration; final concentration may be as low as 0.1 mg/mL. Diluted solution stable  at room  temperature for  24 hours; do not  
refrigerate.
6. Nab-Paclitaxel
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Mechanism of action: Promotes microtubule assembly by [CONTACT_68532],  stabilizing 
existing microtubules, and  inhibiting their disassembly, 
interfering with  the late G 2 mitotic phase,  and inhibiting 
cell replication.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Preparation/Administration: Reconstitute  in NS, swirl 
until complete  dissolution  occurs.  Immediately use the 
reconstituted suspension in the vial or infusion bag, or 
refrigerate (2 to 8 degrees C) for  a maximum of  24 
12hours. Infuse IV over 30 minutes and use  caution  to 
avoid extravasation.
5. Adverse Events
 5.1  Radiation Toxicities
5.1.1.  The CTEP  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE  
v4.0) will be used.  Standard radiation  related  toxicities are expected.    Toxicity  
will be defined as acute (<3 months from completion), subacute (3-12 months)  
and late (>12 months).  Reversible or permanent alopecia, bone marrow  toxicity, 
skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], nausea, and gastritis are expected  side effects of  radiation  
therapy.  
5.2Chemotherapy Toxicities
5.2.1 Common Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.[ADDRESS_75075]  common  grade 3 or 4 adverse  events  occurring  in more than 5% 
of patients  receiving FOLFIRINOX in a multicenter  phase II/III study (15) 
included neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, peripheral  neuropathy, transaminitis, and 
thromboembolism.  Alopecia, stomatitis, and hand/foot syndrome are also reported.  Irinotecan,  in particular,  causes  both early  and late  diarrhea.   
The early form  (during  infusion  or shortly thereafter) is often accompanied  
by [CONTACT_68533][INVESTIGATOR_68521]  (diaphoresis, 
flushing) and  can be attenuated  or prevented with the  use of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], as 
suggested in this protocol.  In  addition to acute and chronic sensory  
neuropathy, oxaliplatin  may cause laryngopharyngeal dysesthesias.   All 
chemotherapeutic drugs carry the  risk of an infusional reaction, including 
anaphylaxis.
5.2.[ADDRESS_75076]  common  grade 3 or adverse  events occurring in  more than 5% of  
patients receiving  gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel included leukopenia, 
anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue,  peripheral neuropathy,  and diarrhea.  
Febrile neutropenia  occurred in 3% of  patients, with 26% of  patients 
receiving growth  factor support.
5.3 Adverse Event Reporting:  Adverse  events  (AE) and serious adverse  events  (SAE)  
will be reported in a  timely manner through the appropriate channels.  The 
investigator will assess and determine whether the  event is related to the study 
treatment and  assign the following category  (possible, probable, definite).  If 
possibly/probably related,  investigator  will specify whether AE/SAE is related to  
chemotherapy or  SBRT.  Please see below for  definitions  of each.  Any and all  
AE/SAEs occuring  during and up to 90 days after protocol-specified  treatment (up to 
[ADDRESS_75077]-SBRT) will be reported.
-AE:  Any  unfavorable  and unintended  sign, symptom,  or disease temporally 
associated with  the use of  a medical  treatment  or procedure regardless  of whether  
13it is considered related  to the medical  treatment  or procedure.  (CTEP, NCI  
guidelines: Adverse event reporting requirements)
-SAE:  Any adverse experience occurring during any  part of protocol treatment 
and 90 days after  that results in the following: death, life-threatening  adverse 
experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or  significant disability,  or a 
cognitive anomaly.
- SAE  will include any  event leading  to the  following:
· Death;
· A life-threatening adverse drug experience;
 · Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
· A persistent or significant disability/incapacity;
 · A congenital anomaly/birth  defect.
Reporting of Adverse  Events
All AEs, regardless  of severity and whether or not they occurred during the study 
treatment or within [ADDRESS_75078] 
and the Co-Chairman of the Data  Safety Monitoring Committee within 24 hours  
of becoming aware of the  event.
6.Follow-up  and Response Criteria
6. 1.    Follow Up
6.1.1. Follow-up:  Complete history and physical  exam will be  performed at  
each follow-up visit  to assess for  treatment related toxicity.   
6.1.2. Imaging:   Imaging  will be obtained  every [ADDRESS_75079] will be  
obtained as recommended by [CONTACT_1963].  
6.2       Response Criteria
6.2.1. Response determination:  Response  assessment will follow  a modified 
version of the  RECIST  criteria guidelines as outlined  below.  Response will be 
assessed from the planning CT scan by [CONTACT_68534].
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance  of all target lesions
14Partial Response (PR):  At least  a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest 
diameter (LD)  of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of LD
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20%  increase  in the sum of the LD of target  
lesions, taking as  reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the  treatment 
started or  the appearance of one or  more new lesions
Stable Disease (SD):  Does not qualify for  a PR  or PD
6.3 Quality of life assessment
Quality of  life is one of the measures we plan on examining.  SBRT offers  a 
compressed treatment regimen and relative few  side effects when compared to  
convential treatment methods in the retreatment setting.   
6.4.1  Function Assessment of Cancer Therapy  – Pancreas  (FACT-Hep):   The  
FACT-Hep quality of life assessement  form  (see Appendix B) will be  utilized.   
This is  an established tool for measuring patient quality of life both before and  
after intervention.  The  form will consist of  41 questions  and be administered at 
the following  time  points:   within [ADDRESS_75080]-treatment.  The  questionnaire should take approximately 8 minutes to  
complete.
6.4 Exploratory biomarker  analysis
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) examines  changes in  the thermodynamic  
properties of  high abundance plasma  proteins. This is highly relevant  since it is 
recognized that proteins and fragments shed from cancer tissue  
microenvironments enter the circulatory system.  Study of the high abundance proteome by [CONTACT_68535].  Blood will be  drawn  at 
strategic timepoints during treatment and follow-up  for this exploratory biomarker  
analysis.

all patients registered to the trial, including  early  termination and patients deemed 
ineligible.
8.3.[ADDRESS_75086] 
and accrual.
9. DSMC Review
An independent committee,  called the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee  (DSMC)  will 
review the progress of  the study and  monitor subjects’ accrual, serious adverse events and  
unexpected events.  Through this process  the DSMC is also assessing  the continuing validity 
and scientific merit of the  trial.  The DSMC members are from the Study Chair’s  Institution, 
the Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville.   Members on the committee view 
themselves as representing the interests  of the study patients and not that of the institution.  
The DSMC makes written  reports summarizing  their  findings  at each review.  The  DSMC 
meets quarterly, or  more  frequently if  requested by [CONTACT_079]. The study 
statistician will provide  the DSMC interim  analysis reports determined  by [CONTACT_68536].
10.  Ethical and Regulatory  Considerations
The following must be  observed to comply with Food and Drug  Administration  regulations 
for the conduct and  monitoring  of clinical investigations; they also  represent  sound research 
practice.
Informed Consent
The principles of informed  consent  are described by [CONTACT_68537] 
(Federal Register Vol. 46, No. 17, January 27, 1981, part 50) and the Office of protection from Research Risks  Reports; protection of Human  Subjects  (Code  of 
17Federal regulations 45 CFR  46). They must be followed to  comply with  FDA  
regulations for the conduct  and monitoring of clinical investigations.
Institutional Review;  This study must be approved  by [CONTACT_68538]  ( Ref.  Federal Register 
Vol. 46, No 17, January 27,  1981, part 56) and the Office for protection from Research 
Risks Reports; Protection of Human Subjects  (Code of Federal regulations 45, CFR 
46).
11. Statistical  Considerations
11.1 Study  Design:
The study  will be  a single-arm,  single center,  uncontrolled phase II trial to estimate the 
safety of  the combined treatment and then estimate the efficacy in terms of the ORR,  overall 
response (CR +  PR +SD)  rate in patients with advanced, non-resectable pancreatic  cancer. 
11.2 End-Point Definitions:
We will use two main end-points. The primary end-point of interest is the clinical 
response. The progression-free  survival, PFS, is  directly related to the sustained response rate 
and thus the time to the first event  will also be  monitored. The second end-point will be  
tolerability/toxicity to treatment.  Secondary end-points  to be considered are the overall survival,  
OS, which is the time  to first  event  or death  due to any reason, quality of life. 
11.3 Sample Size:
There is no data available at the  institution  to support the sample size justification based 
on efficacy of this treatment. In the published  literature,  Conroy et  al. (2011) report overall 
response rate to be  around  25%.  We expect that the  overall response rate should be  between 7-
30%. Therefore an ORR rate less than 10% should indicate the treatment  is not sufficiently 
promising (P0 =  0.10).  We expect the therapy to  increase  the overall response rate to 
approximately 25% (P1 =  0.25). Using Simon’s  two-stage minimax design for phase  II trials  
(Simon, 1989) we plan  to enroll a maximum of 28 patients using alpha=5% and power=70%. In 
first stage, 13 patients will be enrolled. Table  S1 gives the details of the  justification  of this  
sample size.

11.4 Accrual and  Follow-up:
Based  on our experience  we plan to enroll 15 patients per year. It will take approximately 
2.0 years to complete the  enrollment of 28 patients.  Depending on the combination treatment’s 
performance we  may  not need to enroll all  28 participants. The live  patients  will be  followed two 
additional years after the  completion of the treatment.
11.5 Statistical  Analysis:
Patients receiving  treatment will be presented.  Patients  receiving treatment who  are 
found not to have fully met the eligibility criteria will also  be presented.  On-study protocol  
violations will also be  presented.  Patients who do not complete the required observations  will be  
listed and  evaluated separately as necessary.  Reasons for study discontinuation and date of 
withdrawal from study will be presented.
Descriptive statistics related to the participant characteristics, treatment, and prognostic 
factors will be reported.   Clinical response rates  (complete, partial, and sustained) along with 
95% confidence intervals will be estimated  (Yuan  and Rai 2011).  The progression-free survival 
and overall survival  will be estimated by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier method (Kaplan and Meier 1958). 
Differences in survival  will be evaluated  through the estimated hazard rates  using the un-
weighted log-rank tests. The PFS time will be determined as the time from enrollment until the 
first adverse event (i.e., disease progression or death due to any cause).  The OS time will be 
determined as the time from enrollment  until death or last follow-up  evaluation. In order to 
examine the significant  prognostic factors, we will use the Cox proportional hazards regression 
models in both univariable and multivariable  settings  (Cox 1972; Cantor 2003; Kalbfleisch and 
Prentice 2002). Descriptive statistics associated with the toxic events will be reported. Logistic 
regression model will be used to find association  with the presence of higher grade toxicity  and 
clinical and demographic factors  (Fleiss  1986, Fleiss et al 2003; Dmitrienko et al. 2005). For 
longitudinal measures such as quality  of life (QOL) mixed model approach will be used (Diggle 
et al. 2002; Littell 2006). The differential  scanning  calorimetry (DSC) will be used to predict the 
response outcome using the method  of Rai and others (2013). The factors to be analyzed  are 
ethnicity, gender, age, pathological subtype, etc. The various  factors  will be placed  into 
categorical variables. All calculations will be performed with SAS statistical software (SAS, 
2003). 
11.6 Monitoring Rule:
Safety monitoring of the accumulated outcomes data is designed to ensure the continuing 
safety of  the currently  enrolled participants and participants  not yet enrolled.  This  is achieved by 
[CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_68522]  a harmful or ineffective 
treatment. 
11.7 Non-efficacious Treatment (Futility):
19In the first stage we will enroll [ADDRESS_75088] 6 patients.  If the ORR is only 7%, we will have 62% chance of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_68523], at most, 19 patients will be treated  on the potentially ineffective therapy. 
11.8 Toxic  Treatment (Safety):
The cumulative number of  grade  3 or 4 toxic  events will  be monitored after each  person 
is enrolled (Ray  and Rai, 2011). If  the cumulative  number of toxic events produces enough  
evidence to conclude that  the true toxicity rate is greater than or equal to 33% (Pt0 = 0.33) then 
the trial will be stopped early for safety  reasons.  The cumulative number of toxic events after 
each is person  is treated  will be compared  to the boundary values in  Table S2. If the  cumulative  
number of toxic  events after person  i is treated is greater than or equal to the associated  boundary  
value bi then the combination  treatment  is rejected  for safety considerations. With this rule,  there  
is only  a 5%  chance of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_68524] 33%. Continual assessment of the toxic events  ensures we do not  expose  an undue number 
of patients to a  harmful treatment.

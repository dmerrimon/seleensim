Study Title
A Phase 2, International, Multicenter, Randomized, Open-label, Par allel Group Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of CC-486 (oral azacitidine) Alone and in Combination With 
Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in Subjects  With Myelodysplastic Syndromes Who Fail to Achieve an 
Objective Response to Treatment With Azacitidine for Injection or Decitabine
Indication
The treatment of myelodysplastic s yndromes (MDS) not res ponding to prior treatment with 
azacitidine for injection or decitabine.
Objectives
Primary Objective
The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of CC-486 as monotherapy, 
and in combination with anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, durvalumab (MEDI4736), in 
subjects with MDS that did not respond to treatment with an injectable hypomethylating agent (HMA – azacitidin e for injection or decitabine), or were unable to tolerate tr eatment 
with an injectable HMA.
Secondary Objectives
!Assess the safety and tolerability of CC -486 alone and in combination with 
durvalumab, as treatment for MDS
!Describe the clinical relevance of objec tive hematologic and/or biologic responses 
associated with treatment with CC-486 alone and in combination with durvalumab
!Evaluate the impact (if any) of durvalumab on the pharmacokinetics of CC-486 and 
CC-486 on durvalumab in subjects with MDS

dose for the monotherapy and combinati on therapy arms for the randomized phase.
The safety run-in will utilize a 3+[ADDRESS_26572] to confirm the expected safety profile of CC-486 alone at the planned dose and 
schedule in the target population. 
Data from the safety run-in will be reviewed in conjunction with the study investigators, 
Scientific Steering Committee, and Data Monitoring Co mmit tee to ensure agreement with the 
recommended Phase 2 dosing regimens prior to beginning enrollment to the randomized treatment phase.
The randomized treatment phase will be conducted in 2 stages, with a fut ility assessment planned 
at the completion of Stage 1 to determine whether the null hypothesis (H
0: p <12.5%) can be 
rejected with [ADDRESS_26573] (IP) in this 
study will continue to be followed for information related to post-treatment safety and 
subsequent MDS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], as described in Section 4.1.5 .
Approximately 10-12 evaluable subjects randomized  to the combination treatment arm at 
selected study centers will participate in PK sampling procedures as described in Section 6.10.
Extension Phase
At the Investigator’s discretion and following c onfirmation of eligibility cr iteria below, subjects 
can enter the Extension Phase (EP):
Eligibility Criteria:
!Subjects who have signed the informed consent for the EP of the study;
!Subjects receiving oral azacitidine and continuing in the Treatment Phase 
demonstrating clinical benefit as assessed by [CONTACT_27617];
!Subjects who do not meet any of the criteria for study discontinuation (see 
Section 12).
Details for the EP are provided in Appendix J .
The study design is described in detail in Section 4.1.
Study Population
The study will enroll at least 70 to 194 evaluable subjects with MDS who did not respond to an 
adequate course of therapy with an injectable hypomethylating agent (i HMA – a zacitidine for 
injection or decitabine) as their last treatment for MDS, or who we re unable to tolerate an iHMA

Confidential and Propri etary 8 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: [ADDRESS_26574] 3 subjects will be enrolled in each of two treatment groups (monotherapy and 
combination therapy) during the safety run-in  phase of the study: The monotherapy treatment 
group w ill be enrolled first and evalu ated for dos e-limiting toxicity (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), prior to 
selecting a CC-486 dose and regimen, and initiating enrollment for the combination treatment group. Progre ssive disease (PD) and stable disease (SD) designations are made based on the 
subject’s best response to iHMA therapy determined at the start of the study (see Section 4.1).
A total number of [ADDRESS_26575] stage of the 
randomized tr eatment phase into 4 cohorts:  SD monotherapy, PD monotherapy, SD combination 
therapy, and PD combination therapy.  If the required number of objective responses are 
observed in a cohort, the cohort will be continue d into the second stage of study to include 25 
more subjects (see Section 4.1, Section 10.3, and Figure 2 ).
The study is closed to further enrollment with the last subject enrolled in June 2018. A total of 65 
subjects were enrolled in the study. At the time of this amendment, 6 subjects are ongoing in the 
Monotherapy SD/PD cohorts (One subject from Phase 1, and 5 from Phase 2).
Length of Study
The total duration of this study is expected to be approximately 75 months (see Section 4.3).  
Subjects will undergo screening procedures over a period of up to 28 days following the signing 
of their informed consent document (ICD).  Eligible subjects will continue to the safety run-in or 
the randomized treatment phase of the study where they will receive IP for up to six 28-day treatment cycles.  Those who derive benefit from the treatment may continue IP until loss of that 
benefit (Section 4.1.3 ). 
After treatment discontinuation, subjects will be  followed for [ADDRESS_26576] that is required for 
primary, secondary and/or exploratory analysis,  as pre-specified in the protocol and/or the 
Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP), whichever is the later date.
The study will conclude once all subjects have completed or discontinued from the Extension 
Phase.

Confidential and Propri etary 9 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019Eligible subjects who are assigned to the monotherapy treatment ar m will receive CC-486 at the 
dose and schedule identified during the safety ru n-in phase of the study .  Dose and schedule 
may be reduced to manage toxicity or increased as described in Section 8.2. Subjects can 
continue treatment with CC-486 as long as all protocol-sp ecified re-tr eatment criteria continue to 
be met (see Section 8.2.5 ).  
Durvalumab (MEDI4736)
Eligible subjects who are assigned to the combination therapy tr eatment arm will receive CC-486 
as described above, and durvalu mab 1500 mg on Day 1 of each 28- day treatment cycle by 1-hour 
(± 5 minutes) intravenous (IV) infusion.  For toxicity considered by [CONTACT_27618], including immune-med iated adverse events (i mAEs) or infusion-
type reactions, the infusion of durvalumab may be slowed, interrupted, or discontinued as 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Dose reduction for durvalumab is not permitted. Subjects can 
continue treatment with durvalumab in combina tion with CC-486 as long as all protocol-
specified re-tr eatment criteria continue to be met (see Section 8.2.5 ). 
Overview of Efficacy Assessments
The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial is the proportion of subjects achieving an objective 
response (hematologic improvement (HI), partial remission (PR), complete remission (CR), or 
marrow CR – modified from International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria – Appendix F ) to 
treatment with CC-[ADDRESS_26578] 6 treatment cycles.  Subjects who continue beyond Cycle 6 will 
undergo bone marrow examination following every 3 treatment cycles or when necessary to confirm suspected hematologic response or dis ease progression.  Bone marrow samples (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_27505]/or biopsy), along with a peripheral blood smear and pertinent clinical i nformation will be 
submitted for review by [CONTACT_27619], response, and/or progression.  
Hematologic parameters including complete blood count (CBC) with white blood cell (WBC) 
differential and platelets will be assessed by [CONTACT_27620] ( Table 2 ) and Section 6.7.[ADDRESS_26579] of any immunogenic response to durvalumab on the efficacy 
of the treatment, immunogenicity assessment will be performed at the frequency described in the Table of Events ( Table 2 ).

Overview of Pharmacokinetics Assessments
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analy sis will be collected from approximately 10-[ADDRESS_26581] blood samples collected as described in Section 6.10.
Sample Size Determination and Statistical Analysis (Randomized Treatment Phase)
The sample size required will be identical for each cohort and is estimated using the optimal 
design of the Simon's two-stage design method ( Simon, 1989 ). The null hypothesis of the
response rate will be tested against a one-sided alternative. 
For each cohort, the null hypothesis of response rate (H0: p ≤ 0.125) will be tested against the 
alternative hypothesis of response rate (H1: p ≥ 0.27) with a type I error rate of 10% and 80% 
power. During the first stage, [ADDRESS_26582] opped and no further recruitment will be 
needed. Otherwise, 25 additional subjects will be accrued per cohort for a total of 41 subjects in

rejected. 
For each cohort, in addition to the evaluation of treatment responses based on objective response 
criteria, the quality of responses will also be considered for the decision whether to continue the cohort to the second stage of the study. Quality of response will be assessed based on the 
magnitude of hematologic and biologic responses observed in individual subjects, with special 
consideration for response duration, and will be specified with more details in the final SAP.
For the primary objective, the response rate at the end of Stage 2 and the associated 95% 
confidence interval will be estimated for each cohort  which completes Stage 2. Similar estimates 
for Stage 1 will be provided for an y cohort which does not  continue to Stage 2. The response 
rates at the end of Stage 2 will be compared between cohorts of SD and PD subjects (if both 
cohorts finished Stage 2) using the relative risk ratio or other appropriate methods. Specifically, 
if relative risk method is used, the ratio of response rates for both cohorts and the associated 95% confidence interval will be es timated. Description of methodologies will also be provided in the 
SAP if other methods are used.
For the secondary objectives, Kaplan-Meier’s method will be used to analyze the time-to-event 
variables, which include overall survival, time  to response, duration of response, and time to 
disease progression. The safety and tolerability of the regimen in this sample of subjects will be 
estimated and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be estimated.
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee will re view the safety data during the safety run-in

1.1. Myelodysplastic Syndromes
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is an umbr ella term that encompasses a heterogeneous 
collection of hematopoietic stem cell disorders primarily  affecting older adu lts.  MDS is typi[INVESTIGATOR_27506], neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia of variable frequency and severity, with symptoms of anemia being the most frequently-presenting manifestation.  Anemia is the most 
frequent laboratory finding and it often progresses to red blood cell (RBC) transfusion 
dependence.  Other less common presenting clinical features related to the cytopenias are an increased risk of infection and/or hemorrhage and a potential to progress to acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) ( Catenacci, 2005 ).  The latter clinical features often appear over time and are 
associated with more advanced disease.
Myelodysplastic syndromes are classified acc ording to World Health Organization (WHO) 
criteria by [CONTACT_27621] 
(Brunning, 2008; Vardiman, 2009; Appendix A ):  
!Refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia (RCUD)
∀refractory anemia (RA)
∀refractory neutropenia (RN)
∀refractory thrombocytopenia (RT)
!Refractory Anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS)
!Refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD)
!Refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1) 
!Refractory anemia with excess blasts-2 (RAEB-2)
!Myelodysplastic syndrome - unclassified (MDS-U)
!MDS associated with isolated del(5q)
Or by [CONTACT_27622]-American-British (FAB) classification system subtypes of MDS ( Bennett, 1982; 
Appendix B ): 
!Refractory anemia (RA) 
!Refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (if accompanied by [CONTACT_27623])
!Refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB)
!Refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T)
!Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)
A patient’s disease is also assigned to one of 4 prognostic groups (Low, Intermediate-1 [INT-1], 
Intermediate-2 [INT-2], and High risk) according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS - Appendix C ) based on cytogenetic features, number of cytopenias, and bone marrow

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 22 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: [ADDRESS_26596] percentages.  Overall survival and risk of progression to AML is significantly different in 
the 4 risk groups.  Median survival for patients in these risk groups being 5.7 years (Low), 3.5 
years (INT-1), 1.2 years (INT-2), and 0.4 years (High).  The median t ime for 25% of patients to 
progress to AML is 9.4, 3.3, 1.1, and 0.2 years, respectively ( Greenberg, 1997 ).
Allogeneic bone marrow transplan tation ha s been effective, both in patients under the age of 
[ADDRESS_26597] suitable human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched donors.  However, this approach has limited value, since most patients with MDS are older than [ADDRESS_26598] significant comorbidities that 
preclude the use of this modality as it is associ ated with a high morbidity and mortality rate, as 
described in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines: MDS ( NCCN, 2015 ).  
For patients diagnosed with, or progressing to, higher-risk disease, the standard of care is 
treatment with a locally-available injectable HMA: azacitidine for injection or decitabine.  Injectable HMAs can produce hematologic response or improvement in approximately half of 
treated patients, but responses are transient and responding disease will eventually relapse
(Grinblatt, 2008 ; Lyons, 2009 ; Musto, 2010 ; Silverman, 2002 ).
There are no approved (or proven) treatment opti ons following failure of treatment with an 
injectable HMA.  The mainstay of therapy in this setting among patients not eligible for 
autologous stem cell transplant remain s supportive care, including RBC and/or platelet 
transfusions, treatment of infections, and the use of eryth ropoiesis s timulating agents (ESAs)
such as epoetin alfa or darbepo etin, plus hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) when needed ( Lübbert, 2000 ; NCCN, 2015 ;Kadia, 2011 ). 
Neither ESAs nor myeloid growth factors are approved for the treatment of MDS.  
Thus, additional data regarding the use of potentially-e ffective agents in this population is greatly 
needed. 
1.2. CC-486 (Azacitidine)
CC-486 is an oral formulation of azacitidine.  A zacitidine is an analog of the naturally occurring 
pyrimidine nucleoside cytidine and is classified as an ant imetabolite.  In the [LOCATION_002] (US), 
azacitidine (Vidaza®) is approved for the treatment of all 5 FAB classification subtypes of MDS: 
RA, RARS, RAEB, RAEB-T, and CMML, but it is not routinely utilized in the lower-risk 
disease setting.  Azacitidine is approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of adult 
non-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-eligib le patients with IPSS INT-2 or high-risk MDS, 
CMML with 10% to 29% marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder, and AML with 
20% to 30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to the WHO classification.  In addition 
to the US and EU, azacitidine is currently approved in 30 other countries, including Canada, Switzerla nd, Australia, and Japan, for the treatment of MDS (approvals for specific subtypes 
vary by [CONTACT_1606]).  Current approved routes of administration include subcutaneous and 
intravenous (approvals va ry by [CONTACT_1606]).  Similarly, decitabine (Dacogen
®), another 
hypomethylating agent, is approved in the US for treatment of all FAB classification subtypes 
and IPSS INT-1, INT-2 and high-risk MDS.
Azacitidine has strong in vitro and in vivo anti-leukemic activity and the ability to induce 
differentiation at lower concentrations in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell lines.  The

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 23 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019effects of azacitidine may result from multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), and protein synthesis, incorporation into 
RNA and DNA, and activation of DNA damage pathways.  The ability of azacitidine to cause 
differentiation can be attributed to its activity as a hypomethylating agent.  The degree of methylation of cytosine residues in DNA has been demonstrated to play a role in gene 
expression.  Indeed, hypermethylation of cytosine residues of genes critical to ensure orderly cell 
proliferation and maturation (differentiation) is frequently found in primary neoplasms and tumor cell lines ( Zingg, 1997 ).  Therefore, use of an inhibitor of DNA methylation, such as 
azacitidine, is a rati onal approach to reversing these epi[INVESTIGATOR_27508]-establishing antiproliferative signals  that were extinguished  by [CONTACT_27625].  
Preliminary data from the AZA-PH-GL-2003-CL-001 survival study ( Herman, 2009 ) with 
azacitidine in higher-ri sk MDS patients found, from analysis of pretr eatment bone marrow 
methylation density, that the overall survival benefit observed with azacitidine versus conventional care regimens (CCR) was independent of the methylation status of the 5 genes 
analyzed (CDKN2B [p15], SOCS1, CDH1 [E-cadherin], TP73, and CTNNA1 [ α-catenin]).  
However, increasing methylation was associated with worse overall survival.  Patients with lower levels of methylation treated with azacitidine had the best overall survival, suggesting that 
they may derive greater benefit from azacitidine.
Azacitidine has been  studied extensively in MDS and has been shown in a large, randomized, 
Phase [ADDRESS_26599] supportive care, low-dose cytarabine, 
or intensive chemotherapy ( Fenaux, 2009 ).  The clinical experience with azacitidine in AML is 
smaller, but positive efficacy results have been obtained.  In a subset of 113 patients with WHO-
defined AML (mean age 70 years, 24% with unfavora ble karyotype, median bone marrow blasts 
23%) from the larger MDS study discussed above, the median overall survival was 24.5 months 
(n = 55) in the azacitidine arm compared wi th 16.0 months (n = 58) in the CCR arm ( Fenaux, 
2008 ).  Additionally, the outcome was not significan tly different in patients with an unfavorable 
karyotype, although the sample size was small.  Silverman et al, using WHO-defined AML 
criteria for diagnosis, reported a median over all survival of 19.3 months (n = 27) in patients 
treated with azacitidine compared with 12.9 months (n = 25) in patients who received best supportive care ( Silverman, 2006 ).  Additionally, Goldberg et al. reported on 33 patients who 
received azacitidine (n = 11, median age 74) or 7+3 intensive chemotherapy (n = 22, median age 
67 years) ( Goldberg, 2006 ).  Median blast count at bas eline was 42% in the azacitid ine group 
and 65% in the intensive chemotherapy group.  The median overall survival was 13.2 months in 
the patients treated with azacitidine compared with 9.2 months in patients receiving intensive 
chemotherapy ( Goldberg, 2006 ).  All of the above-mentioned studies used the standard injectable 
azacitidine dose of 75 mg/m
2/day for [ADDRESS_26600] responses to azacitidine occur by [CONTACT_27626] 6 cycles of treatment, but responses 
may still occur beyond this ( Musto, 2010 ; Silverman, 2006 ).  Elderly patients (> 70 years of age) 
respond as well as younger patients, and failure to respond to prior therapy with ESAs does not 
preclude possible responses to azacitidine ( Musto, 2010 ). Overall response rates in lower-risk 
MDS subjects have been reported as approximately 50% in various studies ( Grinblatt, 2008 ; 
Lyons, 2009 ; Musto, 2010 ; Silverman, 2002 ).

Confidential and Propri etary 24 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019An oral formulation of azacitidine (CC-486) has been  evaluated in 3 clinical studies to date.  
Results from a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (AZA PH US 2007 PK 004) indicated that azacitidine in an oral 
formulation was bioavailable ( Garcia-Manero, 2008 ).  This was confirmed when evaluating 
several different formulations of the drug in a Phase 1 study (AZA PH US 2008 CL 008).  Results from another Phase 1 study of CC-486 in subjects with MDS, CMML, or AML (AZA 
PH US 2007 CL 005) indicated that administration on different treatment schedules (7-, 14-, and 
21-day once daily [QD] and 14- and 21-day twice daily [BID]) was feasible, generally well-tolerated, and exhibited biologic and clinical activity ( Garcia-Manero, 2009 ; Garcia-Manero, 
2010 ).  
1.3. Durvalumab (MEDI4736)
Durvalumab is briefly described below.  Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure for further 
details.
Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG )1 kappa m onoclonal antibody (mAb) that 
blocks the interaction of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (but not programmed cell death ligand-2) with programmed cell death 1 (P D-1) on T-lymphocytes (T-cells) and cluster of 
differentiation (CD) 80 on immune cells and is engineered to reduce antibody-dependent cell-
mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).
1.3.1. Durvalumab Experience in Solid Tumors
Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 is a Phase 1, firs t-time-in-human, multicenter, open-label, dose-
escalation, and dose-expansion study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or 
optimal biologic dose, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of 
durvalumab in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy or for 
which no standard therapy exists. 
As of [ADDRESS_26601] received durv alumab at 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks (Q2W), 
either in the dose-escalation or dose-expansion phase of the study. The 10 mg/kg Q2W cohort 
represents combined data from subjects treated with this dosing regimen in either the dose-
escalation or dose-expansion phase. The 10 mg/kg Q2W cohort comprises subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (n = 304), urot helial carcinoma (n = 191), squam ous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and microsatellite instability high (both n = 62), 
gastro-oesophageal cancer (n = 51), ovarian cancer (n = 47), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (both n = 40), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 31),
uveal melanoma (n = 24), non-SCC HN human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (positive) (HPV+) (n = 22), 
advanced cutaneous melanoma and s mall cell lung cancer (both n = 21), glioblastoma 
multiforme and soft tissue sarcoma ( both n = 20) and nasopha ryngeal carcino ma (n = 10). 
Subjects in the 10 mg/kg Q2W dose cohort were exposed to a median of 6 doses of durvalumab, 
ranging from 1 to 27 doses.
Of the 970 subjects treated with 10 mg/kg Q2W, 947 subjects (97.6%) had at least 1 adverse 
event (AE) (regardless of causality). AEs (all grades) reported in decreasing order of frequency 
in ≥10% of subjects were fatigue  (37.6%), nausea (23.7%), decreased appetite (23.2%), dyspnea 
(21.9%), constipation (20.2%), diarrhea and cough (17.9% each), back pain (16.5%), vomiting

incidence of AEs was generally similar.
Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported in 295 subjects (30.4%) and were manageable by [CONTACT_27627]. Events occurring in >2% of subjects were anemia (6.2%), dyspnea (6.0%),

A total of 554 subjects (57.1%) reported AEs that were considered by [CONTACT_27628]. Treatment-related AEs (all grades) reported in > 5% of subjects were fatigue (18.7%), nausea (7.9%), diarrhea (7.6%), pruritus (6.8%), decreased 
appetite (6.7%), hypothyroidism (6.3%) and rash (6.0%). The majority of the treatment-related 
AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity with ≥Grade 3 events occurring in 88 subjects (9.1%). 
Treatment-related ≥Grade 3 or 4 events reported in ≥2 subjects were fatigue (1.6%), AST 
increased (1.0%), alanine aminotransferase (A LT) increased (0.8%), GGT increased (0.7%),

event (autoimmune hepatitis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, pneumonia and pneumonitis).
Serious adverse events (SAEs) (regardless of causality) have been reported in 504 of 970 
subjects (52.0%) treated with 10 mg/kg durvalumab Q2W. Serious adverse events reported in 
>1% of subjects by [CONTACT_27629]: NSCLC (4.5%), dyspnea (4.3%), 
abdominal pain and bladder cancer (2.7% each), pneumonia (2.5%), pyrexia and sepsis (2.3% each), general physical health deteriorati on (2.0%), back pain (1.8%), acute kidney injury,

(1.4%), respi[INVESTIGATOR_27510] (1.2%) and hypercalcemia (1.0%). Thirty-nine subjects (4.0%) had SAEs considered by [CONTACT_27630]. Treatment related 
SAEs that occurred in > [ADDRESS_26602] each were colit is and pneumonitis (4 subjects each), nervous 
system disorder (3 subjects), and acute kidney in jury, AST increased, and diarrhea (2 subjects 
each). The majority of the treatment-related SAEs were Grade 3 or higher in severity and 
recovered with or without sequelae.
No clinically meaningful difference in the AE profile across doses was observed, including 
Grade 3 or 4 events, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, or treatment-related AEs.
As of 29 April 2016, 304 NSCLC subjects had received durvalumab monotherapy; 144 subjects 
(47%) with non-squamous and 160 subjects (53%) with squamous histology. Subjects with tumors defined as PDL1 positive had improved overall rate of objective response (ORR) and 
overall survival (OS). The ORR, was 25% and 6% in PD-L1 positive and negative subjects, 
respectively. The 12-month OS rate was 55.8% and 38.8% in PD-L1 positive and negativesubjects, respectively.

Carcinoma: As of d ata cut-off (DCO) on 20 November 2015, 61 sub jects had been enrolled into 
the urothelial cell cohort. Forty-two sub jects who initiated study therapy ≥12 weeks prior to 
DCO were evaluable for response. Confirmed ORR was 46% in the PD-L1 positive subgroup compared to 0% in the PD-L1 negative subgroup. ORR in the entire response evaluable 
population was 31% (13/42 subjects).
Other indications: In PD-L1 unselected subjects, the ORR, based on investigator assessment per 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, ranged from 0% in uveal 
melanoma to 17.4% in advanced cutaneous mela noma, and disease control rate (DCR)-24w 
ranged from 4.2% in TNBC to 39.1% in advanced cutaneous melanoma. Across the PD-L1 high tumors, ORR was >10% for advanced cutaneous melanoma and HCC (33.3% each). In the PD-
L1-positive subset, DCR- 24w was >10% in advanced cutaneous melanoma (66.7%) and HCC 
(33.3%).
As of 24 July 2016, PK data were available for a total of 977 subjects following treatment with 
0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W and 15 mg/kg Q3W (dose escalation), 10 mg/kg Q2W (dose-expansion), 
and 20 mg/kg Q4W (dose-exploration) durvalumab administered as an intravenous (IV) i nfusion 
over 60 minutes. PK samples were analyzed using an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method 
for quantitative determination of durvalumab in human serum with lower limit of quantitation 
(LLOQ) of 50 ng/mL in 100% matrix. 
Following the first IV dose, durvalumab exhibited nonlinear PK at doses < 3 mg/kg Q2W likely 
due to saturable target-mediated clearance (CL) and exhibited linear PK at doses ≥3 mg/kg 
Q2W. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)0-14 increased dose-proportionally at doses of 3 to 20 mg/kg and more  than dose- proportionally at doses of < 3 mg/kg, likely due to 
saturable target-mediated CL. Maximum observed concentration (C
max) increased in a dose-
proportional manner within the dose range examined. The steady state was achieved at approximately Week 16. Accumulation of durvalumab was observed following repeated dosing. 
Mean accumulation ratio (AR) ranged from 0.64 to 1.87 and 3.15 to 4.93 for C
maxand trough 
concentration (C trough) , respectively.
As of 24 July 2016, a total of 790 subjects provided samples for anti-drug antibody (ADA)
analysis. Only 25 of 790 subjects ([ADDRESS_26605] each in 0.1 and 3 mg /kg cohorts, 17 sub jects from 10 
mg/kg cohort) were ADA positive. One subject in the 10 mg/kg cohort tested positive for anti-
TM antibody. Three subjects were neutraliz ing ADA (nAb) positive. For the proposed clin ical 
dose, of 751 subjects (ADA evaluable population) treated with 10 mg/kg Q2W, 2.8% (21/751) 
had treatment-emergent ADAs and 0.1% (1/751) of subjects were positive for nAb. Based on population PK covariate analys is, ADA positive status was not associated with a clinically 
relevant reduction of exposure to durvalumab. At the 10 mg/kg Q2W dose, sPD-L1 suppression 
in ADA positive subjects was similar to that obse rved in ADA negative subjects. The relevance 
of ADA on safety and efficacy is unknown given the small number of ADA positive subjects.

1.4. Study Rationale
The original protocol rationale was to evalu ate the efficacy and safety of CC-486 as a 
monotherapy only.  
Currently, this clinical study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of CC-486 alone, and in
combination with durvalumab, in sub jects with myelodysplastic syndromes, refractory to 
treatment with azacitidine for injection or decitabine; ie, stable disease or disease progression
was the best response to that treatment.  
1.4.1. Azacitidine Exposure
While injectable hypomethylating agents (azacitid ine for injection and decitabine) remain the 
standard of care in the treatment of IPSS higher-risk  MDS, as many as half of affected patients 
do not respond to treatment, and nearly all those who do respond will eventually relapse.  Upon failure of treatment with azacitidine for injection and/or decitabine, the prognosis for patients

(Prebet, 2011; Jabbour, 2010 ).  Similarly, injectable HMAs are approved for treatment of IPSS 
lower-risk MDS in some countries , and while there are few data to characterize outcomes in 
lower-risk disease following failure of these agents, prognosis is poor and for patients who are not eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant, no proven treatment options currently exist 
(Jabbour, 2013 ). 
Aberrant hypermethylation of DNA is a feature of myelodysplastic syndromes, and is implicated 
in the pathogenesis and progression of disease ( Gore, 2006 ).  This supports the notion that 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_27511].  
However, association between the degree of constitutive methylation and magnitude of reduction in methylation state via treatment with HMAs has not been clearly correlated with treatment 
outcomes ( Follo, 2009 ).  
Azacitidine is a cytidine analog that may, in pa rt, exert its antineoplastic effect by [CONTACT_27631].  Optimal drug activity may require an increased window of exposure to 
malignant cells to increase the opportunity for cycling cells to incorporate drug ( Mahfouz, 2013; 
Stresemann, 2008 ). 
An oral formulation of azacitidine provides an opportunity to deliver the drug daily over a more 
prolonge d schedule than can be practically achieved with parenteral therapy.  In a Phase 1 dose-
finding study, the safety, bioavailability, and biologic effects of CC-486 were evaluated.  
Compared with 75 mg/m
2 subcutaneous (SC) AZA, 300 mg CC-486 QD x 14 days and QD x 21 
days provided mean cumulative exposures (AUC) per cycle of approximately 38% and 56%, respectively.  With SC AZA 75 mg/m
2QD, 7/[ADDRESS_26608] reduction in global de-methylation score (GDMS – percent of highly-
methylated loci) of -8.8% at Day 15.  However, methylation increased throughout the remaining 
21 days of the cycle to a GDMS of -3.2% by [CONTACT_27632].  In subjects treated with CC-486 300 mg 
QD,14/28 days and 21/28 days, methylation was significantly reduced at Day 15 (-3.3% and -
5.3%, respectively), Day 22 (-3.8% and - 6.7%) and cycle end (-2.4% and -5.0%) ( Laille, 2015 ).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_27512]-486 compared to azacitidine administered 
subcutaneously, the oral agent, given 21/[ADDRESS_26609] absolute reductions in DNA 
methylation were associated with BID dosi ng.  CC-486 200 mg BID taken 21/[ADDRESS_26610] reductions in  GDMS:  -11.0%, -11.8%, and -9.1% at Day 15, Day 
22, and Day 28, respectively ( Laille, 2015 ).
An orally administered hypomethylating agent may offer several advantages when compared to 
parenterally administered agents. Oral administration eliminates the need for the patient to travel 
for parenteral administration. Furthermore, as no injection is needed, there is the potential to 
decrease adverse events at the site of injection including pain and infection.
Demethylation of several immune checkpoint genes was seen in these analyses which is in line 
with findings that PD-1 and PD-L1 expressi on was increased after treatment with HMA

The goal in treating this population and in evalu ating new potentially therapeutic options is to 
capture or recapture hematologic response or hematologic improvement ( Appendix F ), to reduce
the rate of disease progression and AML transformation, and to prolong survival.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_27513]-HMA setting among researchers, there remains a critical unmet medical need.  
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for detailed information concerning the available 
pharmacology, toxicology , drug metabolism, clinical studies, and adverse event profile of the 
Investigational Product (IP).  The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP), and the applicable regulatory requirements.
1.4.2. Cancer and Immune Function
The importance of the immune system in cancer development and progression has been 
recognized during the past decade ( Hanahan, 2000 ). Failure of immune surveillance of pre-
neoplastic lesions and micro-metas tases is a key step in cancer development. Chronically 
immunosuppressed individuals show higher rates of cancer. This observation led to the 
hypothesis that sporadic cancers among immune-competent individuals are likely to be minimally immunogenic, allowing for passive escape from immune surveillance. Recent data 
suggest that this may be an oversimplification. Some sporadic tumors are highly immunogenic, 
but actively suppress the local immune e nvironment through production of immunosuppressive 
cytokines ( Shields, 2010 ). As such, the local tumor environment is likely a highly dynamic 
environment where most tumors grow and metastasize through adaptive responses that modulate 
antitumor immunity. The complexity and redundancy of the immune system offers multiple targets that may be manipulated to maximize the body’s inherent immune response to a tumor. 
Immune response may be augmented by [CONTACT_27635], indirectly stimulating 
effectors by [CONTACT_27636], or by [CONTACT_27637], cells, or messages ( Monti, 2005 ). 
1.4.3. Immune-checkpoint Inhibition
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have the capacity to control the growth of many types of 
cancers ( Gooden, 2011 ). Most tumors show infiltration by [CONTACT_27638], but tumors modulate the local 
microenvironment through expression of inhibitory molecules. Engagement of TIL cell-surface receptors with these inhibitory ligands lead s to a dysfunctional immune  response, causes T-cell 
exhaustion, and facilitates tumor progression ( Baitsch, 2012; Crespo, 2013 ). It is increasingly 
appreciated that cancers are recognized by [CONTACT_27639], and under some circumstances, the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors ( Dunn, 2004 ).  Novel monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) that block these inhibitory receptors have shown significant clinical activity 
across a number of tumor types ( Wolchok, 2009; Hodi, 2010; Robert, 2011; Brahmer, 2010; 
Topalian, 2012 ). Specifically, blockade of immune-checkpoint inhibitors such as cytotoxic T-
lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), PD -1, and PD-L1 have shown clinical activity not 
only in conventionally immune-responsive tumors  such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma 
but also in NSCLC ( Brahmer, 2010; Brahmer, 2012; Topalian, 2012; Gordon, 2013 ), and 
prostate cancer ( Harzstark, 2010 ).  Pembrolizumab and nivolu mab are both PD-[ADDRESS_26612] family of checkpoint inhibitors to gain approval

Confidential and Propri etary 30 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), pembrolizumab for melanoma and 
nivolumab for melanoma and squamous cell lung cancer. Both pembrolizumab and nivolumab 
have received European Commission regulatory  approval for the treatment of metastatic 
melanoma. The European Commission has also approved nivolumab for the treatment of advanced previously treated squamous NSCLC.
The PD-[ADDRESS_26614] 
tumors ( Peggs, 2009 ). This may be accomplished by [CONTACT_27640]-inhibitory molecules such as 
CTLA-4 or PD-1 from binding with their ligands, B7 or B7-H1 (PD-L1).
PD-L1 and PD-L2 are expressed on many human lymphomas ( Li, 2012 ; Chen, 2013 ). PD-L1 has 
been detected on several hematologic malignancies, including Hodgkin lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute 
myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and adult T- cell leu kemia/lym phoma ( Liu, 
2007 ; Dorfman, 2006 ; Rosenwald, 2003 ; Tamura, 2005 ; Xerri, 2008 ). PD-L1 expression has 
been detected on several myeloid cell lines, sugge sting that PD-L1 expression continues to 
suppress immune function ( Dolen, 2013 ). In addition, in MDS subtypes, PD-L1 expression on 
myeloblasts has been associated with MDS transformation to AML ( Ogata, 2012 ). Myeloid 
leukemia cell lines that were treated with the hypomethylating agent decitabine were shown to 
have an upregulation of PD-L1 expression ( Yang, 2012 ). Upregulation ( ≥ 2 fold) of PD-L1 has 
been observed in 25% of AML CD34+ samples, 33% of PD-L2, and 22% of PD-1 ( Yang, 2014 ).
PD-1 signaling may be involved in MDS pathogenesis and resistance mechanisms to azacitidine; 
therefore, combined blockade of this pathway can be a potential therapy in MDS and AML 
(Yang, 2014 ).
PD-L1 expression is present in MDS and AML, with increased expression observed in advanced 
disease. In addition, there has been evidence to  suggest that PD-L1 is upregulated in myeloblasts 
in MDS subtypes ( Yang, 2014 ). Therefore, a rationale exists for evaluating durvalumab in 
combination with azacitidine in subjects with MDS and AML.

1.4.5. Rationale for Durvalumab Fixed Dosing Regimen
The dose and schedule for durvalumab monotherapy (20 mg/kg once every 4 weeks [Q4W]) 
were selected based on 2 sets of data: (1) the safety analysis of doses (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 
mg/kg once every 2 weeks [Q2W]) administered in Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 (a Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of IV durvalumab given as monotherapy in 
subjects with advanced solid tumors; and (2) PK profile simulations for durvalumab
administered using 10 mg/kg Q2W and 20 mg/kg Q4W schedules.
Safety and PK characteristics of the studied dose and schedule 10 mg/kg Q2W:
After evaluation of the PK data from subj ects enrolled in Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108, 
durvalumab exhibited nonlinear (dose-dependent) PK consistent with target-mediated drug disposition. Linear PK was observed at doses of 3 mg/kg and higher and is consistent with near 
complete target suppression, as reflected in target trough plasma concentrations of drug >100 
ug/mL. This trough concentration is supported by [CONTACT_27641]-L1 (sPD-L1) suppression data. 
Furthermore, the 10 mg/kg Q2W dose was not a ssociated with any DLTs in the dose escalation 
portion and was, therefore, selected for further evaluat ion in the dose-expansion portion of Study 
CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108.
Extrapolation of dose and schedule of 10 mg/kg Q2W to 20 mg/kg Q4W through population PK 
modeling:
A population PK model was devel oped using durvalumab monothe rapy data from Phase 1 of 
Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 (N=292; doses = 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 mg/kg Q3W; solid
tumors) ( Fairman, 2014 ). This population PK model adequately described monotherapy PK data 
and was utilized to predict expected PK expos ures following 20 mg/kg Q4W dosing regimens 
(since none of the monotherapy studies explored Q4W regimens). Pharmacokinetic simulations 
indicate that a similar overall exposure as represen ted by [CONTACT_27642] (4 weeks) is expected following 
both 10 mg/kg Q2W and 20 mg/kg Q4W regimens. However, median C
maxat steady state is 
expected to be higher with 20 mg/kg Q4W (~1.5 fold) and median trough concentration at steady 
state is expected to be higher with 10 mg/kg Q2W (~1.25 fold). 
Justification for fixed dosing over weight-based dosing:Population PK analysis indicated only minor impact of body weight (WT) on PK of durvalumab
(coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The impact of body WT-based (10 mg/kg Q2W) and fixed dosing (750 mg 
Q2W) of durvalumab was evaluated by [CONTACT_27643] (5th, median, and 95th percentiles) using the population PK model. A fixed dose of 750 mg was 
selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on median body WT of ~75 kg). A total of 1000

2013 ). Wang and colleagues investigated 12 monoclonal antibodies and found that fixed and 
body size-based dosing perform similarly, with fixed dosing being better for 7 of 12 antibodies 
(Wang, 2009 ). In addition, they investigated [ADDRESS_26616] 
variability in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics parameters ( Zhang, 2012 ). 
A fixed dosing approach is preferred by [CONTACT_27645]. Given expectation of similar pharmacokinetic exposure and variability, 
we considered it feasible to switch to fixed dosing regimens. Based on average body WT of 75 kg, a fixed dose of durvalumab at 1500 mg Q4W (equivalent to 20 mg/kg Q4W) is included 
in the current study.

4.1. Study Design
This is a Phase 2, international, multic enter, randomized, parallel group, open-label study 
consisting of 5 study phases: Screening, Safety Run-in, Randomized Treatment , Follow-up , and
Extension .  
The study is closed to further enrollment with th e last subject enrolled in June 2018. A total of 65 
subjects were enrolled in the study. At the time of this amendment, 6 subjects are ongoing in the 
Monotherapy SD/PD cohorts (One subject from Phase 1, and 5 from Phase 2).
The study is amended to include an Extension Phase (EP).  The EP allows subjects who are 
currently receiving oral azacitidine and who are demonstrating clinical benefit as assessed by [CONTACT_3786], to continue receiving oral azacitidin e until the subject meets the criteria for study
treatment discontinuation.  No survi val will be followed during the EP.
ASafety Run-in will first explore the saf ety and tolerability of m onotherapy, followed by
[CONTACT_27646][INVESTIGATOR_27514] (see Figure 1 ).  
The randomized treatment phase of the study will be conducted in 2 stages.  Following 
identification of dose and schedule in the safety run-in of a tr eatment arm, enrollment for Stage 1 
of the treatment phase may begin.  Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of two open treatment arms:
!Monotherapy – CC-486 alone, or
!Combination Therapy – CC-486 plus durvalumab
In the event that only one treatment arm for a c ohort is open for accrual due to available safety 
and efficacy data, subjects will be assigned to treatment on the open arm.
Throughout the study, subjects will be categorized as having Progressive Disease (PD) or Stable 
Disease (SD) and these designations are made based on the subject’s best response to iHMA 
therapy determined at the start of this study (see Section 7), and any marked changes in their 
disease prior to beginning treatment in this study (eg, a subject with stable disease as their best 
response to iHMA therapy, but with subsequent disease progression would be assigned to the PD group).  Numb ers of subjects with PD and SD allocated to each treatment arm will be monitored 
to enable the planned analyse s for each sub-population.  Hence there are 4 cohorts being 
evaluated in this study:
!Monotherapy, progressive disease
!Monotherapy, stable disease
!Combination therapy, progressive disease
!Combination therapy, stable disease
Excluded from participation in this clinical trial is the cohort of patients that initially 
demonstrates a positive response to treatment with an injectable HMA, but subsequently relapses.  This group is thought to represent an especially difficult-t o-treat sub-population in

Confidential and Propri etary 37 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: [ADDRESS_26619] 70 to 194 evaluable subjects (inclusive 
of subjects in the safety run-in and randomized phases). 
At least 6 subjects will be included in the safety run-in: 3 receiving monotherapy, and 3
receiving combination therapy (see Figure 1 ).  The dose and schedule of CC-486 to be evaluated 
in combination with a fixed dose of durvalumab will be determined as described in Section 4.1.2.
In the randomized treatment phase, eligible subjects  will be randomized to  receive CC-486 alone 
or in combination with durvalumab.  The randomized treatment phase will be conducted in 2 
stages, with a futility assessment planned at the completion of Stage 1 to determine whether the 
null hypothesis (H0: p <12.5%) can be rejected with [ADDRESS_26620] the same integrity as the fut ility assessment planned at the 
completion of Stage 1. An analysis will be performed at the completion of Stage 2 to estimate the 
overall response rate of treatment of all the subjects in the cohort (see Figure 2 ). Additional
analyses will be conducted approximately [ADDRESS_26621] is enrolled, as 
described in Section 4.1.5 and Section 10.6.2 .
During the randomized treatment phase of the study , approximately 32 subjects with PD and 32 
subjects with SD will be randomized evenly to receive either CC-486 alone, or CC-486 + 
durvalumab.  There will be 4 cohorts (16 subjects in each) in Stage 1:  SD treated with 
monotherapy, PD treated with monotherapy, SD treated with combination therapy and PD treated with combination therapy. If there are 2 or fewer responses in any cohort during Stage 1, 
enrollment to that arm will be termin ated.  Otherwise,  the cohort w ill continue to Stage 2 and 
accrue an additional 25 subjects each.  If 8 or more responses are observed in these 41 subjects, the null hypothesis will be rejected for that cohort.  During the course of the study, whenever 
both cohorts of the same patient classification (ie, SD or PD) are open for enrollment, established 
randomizatio n procedures will be followed. During Stage 1, if a cohort is awaiting the decision 
to continue to Stage 2 pending on the response evaluation while the other cohort of the same 
patient classification is open for enrollment, available patients will be assigned to the cohort with 
open enrollment without randomization. If both cohorts of the same patient classification are waiting for response evaluations, enrollment of that patient classification will be temporarily 
halted.
Therefore, the total number of subjects for the randomized treatment phase will range from
approximately 64 (at Stage 1) to 164 (Stage 1 plus Stage 2) for the [ADDRESS_26622] cohorts.  More 
subjects can potentially be recruited for replacem ent of non-evaluable subjects, if needed (see 
Figure 2 ).

(dose level -2) as the CC-486 dose to proceed in to the combination therapy safety run-in.
The dose-finding procedure for CC-486 and CC-486+durvalumab will proceed as following.
Part (A) - starting dose for CC-486 as monotherapy :A group of 3 subjects will receive CC-486 
at dose level 0 (200 mg BID ( 21/28 days) and will be closely monitored through at least 2 
treatment cycles for dose- limiting tox icities, as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  If for any reason the 
monotherapy safety run-in starting dose needs to be reduced, the starting dose will follow the established levels in Table 1. 
1. If #Subject with DLT = 0/3, the dose will be declared tolerable and used as the starting 
CC-486 dose.
2. If #Subject with DLT = 1/3, recruit another [ADDRESS_26627] the same dose.
a. If #Subject with DLT = 1/6, the dose will be declared tolerable and used as the 
starting CC-486 dose.
b. If #Subject with DLT ≥ 2/6, the dose will be declared intolerable and the next 
lower dose level of CC-486 according to Table 1 will then be explored. Repeat 
the entire procedure with 3 new subjects.
3. If #Subject with DLT ≥ 2/3, the dose will be declared intolerable and the next lower dose 
level of CC-486 according to Table 1 will then be explored. Repeat the entire procedure 
with 3 new subjects.
The safety run-in for CC-486 monotherapy has been completed as of December 2016.
Part (B) - starting dose for CC-486+durvalumab as combination therapy : A group of 3 subjects 
will receive CC-486 dose determined in Part (A) above plus d urvalumab 1500 mg (given by [CONTACT_27650] [over 1 hour ± 5 minutes] on Day 1 of each 28-day treatment cycle) and will be closely 
monitored through at least 2 treatment cycles for dose- limiting toxicities, as defined in
Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  
1. If #Subject with DLT = 0/3, the dose will be declared tolerable and used as the starting 
CC-486 dose plus durvalumab 1500 mg.
2. If #Subject with DLT = 1/3, recruit another [ADDRESS_26628] the same dose.
a. If #Subject with DLT = 1/6, the dose will be declared tolerable and used as the 
starting CC-486 dose p lus durvalumab 1500 mg.
b. If #Subject with DLT ≥ 2/6, the dose will be declared intolerable and the next

Table 4 provides guidance for the management of CC-486-related toxicity, including provisions 
for appropriate delay or discontinuation of treatment.
For acute events of neutropenia, thrombocytopeni a, and leucopenia, a ssociated with treatment 
with CC-486, the following formula should be us ed to calculate the minimum neutrophil, 
platelet, or white bl ood cell count that would signify “recove ry” of marrow function and enable 
initiation of the subsequent treatment cycle.
For example, a subject with a pre-treatmen t absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.0 x 109/L
experiences a nadir ANC of 0.4 x 109/L (Grade 4) following one cycle of treatment.  The 
subject’s ANC must recover to at least 0.4 + (1.0-0.4)/2, or 0.7 x 109/L before beginning the 
subsequent treatment cycle.  If the event is judge d by [CONTACT_27653] 14 days of completing Cycle 1, it will be 
considered a dos e-limiti ng toxicity.

Figure 2 depi[INVESTIGATOR_27515].
The randomized tr eatment phase of the study will be conducted in 2 stages.  Following 
identification of dose and schedule in the safety run-in of a tr eatment arm, enrollment for Stage 1 
of the treatment phase may begin.  Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of two open 
treatment arms:
!Monotherapy – CC-486 alone, or
!Combination Therapy – CC-486 plus durvalumab
In the event that only one treatment arm for a cohort is open for accrual due to available safety 
and efficacy data, subjects will be assigned to treatment on the open arm.
Subjects with stable disease at the time of enrollment will be included in the stable disease (SD) 
cohort for that treatment arm, and those with progressive disease at th e time of enro llment will 
be included in the progressive disease (PD) cohort (see Section 7.2).  Subjects with MDS that
responded to injectable HMA treatment are not eligible for this study, even if their disease subsequently relapsed.  
Numbers of subjects with PD and SD allocated to each treatment arm will be monitored to 
enable the planned analyses for each sub- population.  Hence there are 4 cohorts being evaluated 
in this study:
!Monotherapy, progressive disease
!Monotherapy, stable disease
!Combination therapy, progressive disease
!Combination therapy, stable disease
Excluded from participation in this clinical trial is the cohort of patients that initially 
demonstrates a positive response to treatment with an injectable HMA, but subsequently 
relapses.  This group is thought to represent an especially difficult-t o-treat sub-population in 
which gaining disease control is unlikely with currently-available or experimental options.  Even among patients not responding to initial HMA therapy, some will experience rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]-progressing 
disease characterized by [CONTACT_27654].
All baseline assessments and procedures should be performed prior to administration of the first 
dose of CC-[ADDRESS_26637] should begin treatment on the day of randomization via Inter active Response 
Technology System (IRTS) whenever possible, but the dose may be delayed for up to [ADDRESS_26638] be discussed with, and 
approved by, the sponsor’s medical monitor and may result in the need to repeat screening.  
Approximately 10-12 evaluable subjects randomized to the combination treatment arm at 
selected centers will participate in PK sampling procedures as described in Sections 4.1.4 and 
6.10.  Subjects in whom Cycle 1 and 2 PK sampling cannot be completed will be replaced for PK 
collection purposes.

management of unacceptable toxicity.  All efforts should be made to maintain BID dosing.  A 
QD ‘rescue’ regimen is available if the investigator believes a subject’s ability to tolerate 
treatment is limited by [CONTACT_27656]-daily dosing (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who cannot tolerate a reduced 
dose and schedule of 100 mg BID (or 200 mg QD), 14/28 days, will discontinue the treatment 
phase of the study and enter the follow-up phase.  
Interruption or delay of treatment with CC-486 for up to 42 days is permitted as outlined in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] to enable recovery from IP-related toxicity.  If there is a delay of more than 42 
days (6 weeks) in the start of the next cycle, the medical monitor must be consulted.  When the 
start of a new treatment cycle with CC-486 is de layed for any reason, the infusion of durvalumab
will also be delayed (in subjects randomized to the combination treatment arm), such that 
durvalumab continues to be administered on Day 1 of each treatment cycle.  Study treatment 
should be discontinued if there is a delay of more  than 56 days (8 weeks) in the start of the next 
cycle, unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_27516], the subject is 
experiencing clinical benefit.
For toxicity that is thought to be rel ated to treatment with durvalumab, including immune-
mediated AEs (imAEs) or infusion-type r eactions, as well as for non-immune mediated 
reactions, the infusion of durvalumab may be slowed or interrupted, or a dose may be withheld, 
as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Dose reduction of durvalumab is not permitted.
In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, subjects who show signs of worsening disease (clinical
or hematological), who remain in stable disease, or do not experience modified IWG 2006 
hematologic improvement (HI) or better (PR, CR or marrow CR – modified IWG 2006, Appendix F ) after [ADDRESS_26641] has completed 12 cycles.

the end of Cycle 6, prior to starting Cycle 7.
Subjects who satisfy any one of the following criteria may continue on to Cycle 7 and beyond.  
The disease status of these subjects will be assessed at the beginning of every new cycle based 
on available clinical and laboratory assessments:
!Objective response to treatment:  CR, marrow CR (mCR), PR, or HI ( Appendix F ), or

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 48 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: [ADDRESS_26644] one dose of IP will undergo treatment discontinuation 
procedures (Section 6.13) when treatment with IP is discontinued.  If a subject is discontinued 
during a regularly-scheduled visit, that visit will be considered the treatment discontinuation visit and all treatment discontinuation procedures should be completed.  If a procedure had been 
performed within 7 days of the treatment discontinuation visit, it does not need to be repeated.
For all enrolled/randomized subjects, the reason for discontinuing treatment w ill be rec orded in 
the case report form (CRF) and in the source document, regardless of whether or not a dose of IP 
was ever administered.
During the randomized treatment phase of the study, approximately 32 subjects with PD and 32 
subjects with SD will be randomized ev enly to receive either CC- 486 alone, or CC-486 + 
durvalumab.  There will be 4 cohorts (16 subjects in each) in Stage 1: SD treated with 
monotherapy, PD treated with monotherapy, SD treated with combination therapy and PD treated with combination therapy. If there are 2 or fewer responses in any cohort during Stage 1, 
enrollment to that arm will be terminated.  Otherwise, the cohort will continue to Stage 2 and 
accrue an additional 25 subjects each.  If 8 or more responses are observed in these 41 subjects, the null hypothesis will be rejected for that cohort.
Therefore, the total number of subjects for the randomized treatment phase will range from 
approximately 64 (at Stage 1) to 164 (Stage 1 plus Stage 2) for the 4 cohorts. More subjects can potentially be recruited for replacement of  non-evaluable subjects, if needed (see Figure 2 ).
A subject is considered evaluable for response once they have received one cycle of treatment 
with a maximum of [ADDRESS_26645] who discontinues from the treatment phase for any reason not related to IP 
toxicity (eg, disease progression or administrative r easons) before the first post-baseline efficacy 
assessment (following treatment Cycle 2) will be replaced and an additional subject will be 
included in that cohort (PD or SD cohort).  This will ensure a valid statistical assessment in both 
the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, and, if different, the modified ITT (mITT) population
(Section 10.2), excluding those who discontinue study treatment early because of the rapid 
progression of their disease, or leave the study for non-study-related reasons prior to this first 
post-baseline efficacy assessment.
The sponsor, in consultation with the Scientific Steering Committee and Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee, will continue to evaluate each  subject’s response to treatment based on 
modified IWG 2006 criteria ( Appendix F ) until the required number of responses is observed for 
a given cohort to proceed to Stage 2, or when th e last active subject in Stage 1 of any cohort 
(monotherapy or combination therapy; PD or SD) reaches the disease status assessment 
following treatment Cycle 6.  At that point a final determination can be made regarding the 
progression of that cohort to Stage 2.
In addition to evaluating responses to treatmen t based on objective criteria, the sponsor, in 
consultation with the Scientific Steeri ng Committee and Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee, w ill also evalu ate the quality of each objective response.  Quality of response will be

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 53 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun [ZIP_CODE].2. Study Design Rationale
This is a Phase 2, international, multic enter, randomized, parallel group, open-label study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safe ty of treatment with CC-486 (an orally-available 
cytidine analog) alone and in combination wi th durvalumab (a m onoclonal antibody  targeting the 
Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 [PD-L1]) in subjects with myelodysplastic syndromes when an objective response is not achieved through treatment with an injectable hypomethylating agent 
(iHMA). The randomized study design reduces bias in subject selection by [CONTACT_1570], and 
enables a valid comparison of efficacy and safety between treatment groups.  This will allow for selection of the appropriate treatment group for further evaluation in the post-iHMA setting.
The study population represents  the group of patients with MDS that have exhausted available
HMA tr eatment options.  No additional medical intervent ion is currently approved in this setting 
and prognosis for members of this population is dismal.  
The study will evaluate the two treatment regimens in two subsets of subjects who fail to respond 
to iHMA treatment: those with stable disease (with no hematologic response or improvement) 
associated with the i HMA, and those with disease progression during or following iHMA 
treatment.  The study excludes subjects who respond to injectable therapy but subsequently 
relapse, because this group is thought to repre sent an especially hard-to-treat segment of the 
population wher e additional disease control is generally unlikely with this, or other, experimental 
agents.  The SD and PD sub-populations will be analyzed se parately for the monotherapy and 
combination therapy treatment arms.
A safety run-in phase of the study will explore the safety and toler ability of CC-486 alone and in 
combination with durvalumab to confirm that there are no overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_27520], and to determine the init ial 
dose and schedule to be applied for the randomized portion of the study.  Once a recommended
dose and schedule for the combination has been identified as described in Section 4.1.2 , 
enrollment into the randomized tr eatment phase may begin.
All cohorts will be evaluated using a Simon’s 2-stage design (Section 10.3).  This approach will 
enable safety and efficacy to be formally evaluated following enrollment of Stage [ADDRESS_26656] 
stage of the randomized tr eatment phase.  If suffici ent objective responses are observed in one or 
more cohorts (SD monotherapy, PD monotherapy, SD combination therapy, PD combination 
therapy), the applicable cohort(s) w ill be expanded in the sec ond stage of study to include up to 
approximately 25 additional subjects per cohort (see Section 4.1, Section 10.3, and Figure 2 ).
In addition to evaluating responses to treatment based on objective criteria, the sponsor, together 
with the study’s Scientific Steering Committee and Independent Data Monitoring Committee 
will also evaluate the quality of each objective response.  Quality of response will be assessed 
based on the magnitude of hematologic and biologic responses observed in individual subjects, 
with special consideration for response duration.  The sponsor may decide to discontinue accrual 
to one or more cohorts despi[INVESTIGATOR_27521].  For example, if a sufficient quantity of 
responses is observed, but all responses are transient hematologic improvements that are not

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 54 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: [ADDRESS_26657] 21 days of each 28-day tr eatment cycle. This dose and schedule has demonstrated 
reasonable tolerability in a prior study ( Garcia-Manero, 2009 ; Garcia-Manero, 2010 ) and BID 
dosing is hypothesized to contribute to anti-tum or activity by [CONTACT_27663] 
S-phase throughout the treatment cycle compared to a once d aily or injectable regimen.  
Durvalumab will be administered on Day 1 of each 28-day treatment cycle as a single 1500 mg 
IV infusion, as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Subjects should continue to receive IP for at l east 6 cycles of treatment before considering 
treatment discontinuation for lack of clinical activity because, based on prior studies with 
parenteral azacitidine therapy, response to tr eatment may be delayed to allow for adequate cell 
line recovery without dose reduction ( Silverman, 2006 ).  While on treatment, subjects will 
continue to receive best supportive care, thus the requested 6-month minimum treatment period 
does not represent an undue risk to subjects.  In addition, because overall survival is one of the 
endpoints, the effect of ex tended therapy is being evaluated; suspension of therapy at an early 
time point may blunt any po ssible clinical benefit.  
Analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted only after all active subjects have comp leted 
the modified IWG response assessment following a maximum of [ADDRESS_26658] supportive care provided to all study subjects is to include RBC (pRBC and whole blood) 
and platelet transfusions (single donor or pooled donor), antibiotic, antiviral and antifungal 
therapy, and nutritional support as needed.  Gr anulocyte colony-stimulating factors are allowed 
only for subjects experiencing neutropenic fever/infection as well as for secondary prophylaxis 
under certain conditions (see Section 9.1).  
Best supportive care for this study excludes the use of ESAs and other hematopoietic growth 
factors as these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_27522].  Furthermore, 
ESAs are less effective for RBC transfusion-dependent anemia than for RBC transfusion-independent anemia ( Hellstrom-Lindberg, 2003 ).  Thus the best supportive care for this study 
should minimize the risk of not providing subjects with appropriate care, while providing the 
potential benefit of achieving additional diseas e control that was previously not achievable.  
Further consideration for excluding the use of ESAs from best supportive care is the theoretical 
possibility that the combination of ESA with azacit idine may have an additive effect on response
and this could confound the evaluation of e fficacy associated with CC-[ADDRESS_26659] approximately 24 months. Therefore, 
the total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 75 months.

All required study visits are described in Table 2 with an “X” indicating the procedures to be 
performed during a particular visit.  All data obtain ed from these assessments must be present in 
the subject’s source documentation.  Unless otherwise noted, acceptable study visit windows are 
as follows:  routine assessments of Cycles [ADDRESS_26683] be performed ± 3 days of the targeted day indicated in the table; all routine assessments of Cycles [ADDRESS_26684] be performed ± 7 
days of the targeted day; post-treatment follow- up contacts must be performed within ± [ADDRESS_26685]’s screening period in 
order to establish eligibility and to document relevant medical and demographic data (eg, 
medical history and prior/concomitant medications ).  Written informed consent must be obtained 
before any study-specific procedures are performed and any samples are collected for study-
specific analysis.  Per inclusion criterion number 5, there may not be more than [ADDRESS_26686]’s last dose of injectable HMA and the date of their informed consent signature.  Also, there may not be less than [ADDRESS_26687]’s last dose of injectable HMA and 
the planned first dose of IP in this study (inclusion criterion number 6).  Given this timeframe, 
subjects may begin screening after the last dose of prior injectable HMA. 
Subject eligibility is established by [CONTACT_27667].  Docume ntation used  to establish eligibility should be forwarded to the 
sponsor to ensure documentation is sufficient from a regulatory and quality perspective.  The sponsor may contact [CONTACT_27668].  Failure to satisfy any entry criterion will preclude a subject from 
enrolment into the safety run-in or tr eatment phase of the study.  Unless otherwise specified, 
screening assessments must take place, and eligible subjects enrolled in the study within 28 days 
after the date of informed consent signature.  Refer to Section 6.2for information to be collected 
for screen failures: screened subjects who do not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria during 
screening, or who are not enrolled in the treatment phase for any reason.
A subject who becomes a screen failure can be rescreened if it is reasonable to believe they will 
meet eligibility criteria during rescreening. Please note that if a subject is to be rescreened, they must reconsent to participation in the study by [CONTACT_2960] a new and current Informed Consent 
Document and the date of signature [CONTACT_27761] [ADDRESS_26688] dose of injectable 
HMA.
6.1.1. MDS Diagnosis, WHO and FAB Classifications and IPSS(-R) Risk Classification
MDS diagnosis, WHO classification ( Appendix A ), FAB classification ( Appendix B ), IPSS risk 
classification ( Appendix C ), and IPSS-R risk classification ( Appendix D ) will be established 
through documentation collected during screening.

diagnosis, WHO/FAB classification and IPSS/IPSS -R risk categorization is available within [ADDRESS_26698] 
in the study.  
Instructions for submission of blood and bone marrow slides/samples, along with relevant 
clinical information, for central review are provided in the Central Laboratory Manual.  Samples and documentation should be prepared and sent to the central reviewer as early in the screening 
process as possible, and not more than [ADDRESS_26699] signs informed consent; this will 
enable resolution of any issues prior to the sub ject being enrolled into the study.  Therefore, the 
informed consent process and screening procedures (including bone marrow collection) should 
be planned with careful consideration for the 28-day screening period to avoid any potential need 
for re-screening due to exceeding the 28-day limit.  Special handling requests such as return of materials to the site will be managed on an individual basis.

signing informed consent to the day the subject is declared a screen failure.  This information 
will be captured in the subject’s source documents and appropriate CRF(s).  Relevant 
information will also be recorded on a Screening Log.  Subjects can be re-screened following discussion with the medical monitor.  
6.3. Entering a Subject Into the Study (Enrollment)
Written consent must be obtained prior to any study-specific procedures being conducted.  All the screening evaluations must be completed and eligibility criteria must be verified by [CONTACT_27674] a subject. Enrollment will occur v ia IRTS to enable automated tracking and 
replenishment of IP.  Specific contact [CONTACT_27675].
The IRTS enrollment call should be performed as close as possible to the planned first dose of IP 
to avoid enrolling a subject who ultimately does not receive IP for any reason.
The first dose of IP should be administered at the site on the day of enrollment whenever 
possible, but may be delayed for up to [ADDRESS_26700] be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_456]’s medical monitor, and 
may result in the need to repeat screening.
Subjects enrolled in the safety run-in phase of th e study will be assigned to the monotherapy arm 
or the combination therapy arm.  Subjects enrolled in the treatment phase of the study will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms, while controlling for the numbers of 
subjects with PD and SD required in each arm for the planned analysis.

if it is well-tolerated but no objective response is observed.  
Special attention should always be given to po tential drug-related toxicity and/or tolerab ility 
issues so dose and/or schedule can be reduced appropriately (Section 8.2.4 ).
Subjects can continue tr eatment with CC-486 as long as all protocol-specified re-tr eatment
criteria continue to be met (see Section 8.2.5 ).
Best supportive care s hould be us ed in combination with study treatment as  deemed necessary.  
Best supportive care includes, but is not limited to, treatment with RBC transfusions (pRBC or whole blood), single donor or pooled donor platelet transfusions, antibiotic, antiviral and/or 
antifungal therapy, antiemetic and/or antidiarrheal support, nutritional support as needed, and 
granulocyte (or granulocyte macrophage) colony-stimulating factors for subjects experiencing neutropenic fever or infection, and may be given as secondary prophylaxis (Section 9.1).  Best 
supportive care for this study excludes the use of ESAs and other hematopoietic growth factors, 
except as noted for G- or GM-CSF in Section 9.1.  It is recommended that an antiemetic 
medication such as ondansetron or an appropriate locally-available equivalent be taken 30 
minutes prior to CC-486 administration during Cycle 1 of the treatment phase.  If 
nausea/vomiting is not significant, further antiemetic prophylaxis may not be needed.  
Refer to Section 8.2for details regarding IP dispensation, administration, and accountability.

documented at any time from signing of informed consent through death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent for further data collection, or study closure, whether or not thought to be
related to treatment with IP.
Events of disease progression to  AML are reported in the same way as SAEs using the 
seriousness criterion of “important medical event” if  no other seriousness criteria apply.  This 
information must also be documented on the appropriate CRFs and in the subject’s source 
documents.  Documentation supporting the diagnosis of progression to AML (eg, confirmatoryhistology or cytology results, etc.) must be provi ded at the time of reporting as an SAE.  Refer to 
Section 11.2 for evaluation of AEs.  
6.7.3. Physical Examination, Vital Signs and Weight
Physical examinations, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) and 
weight measurements are to be performed as specified in Table [ADDRESS_26704] 12-lead ECG is to be pe rformed during screening, upon treatment discontinuation, 
and whenever clinically indicated.  
Electrocardiograms will be conducted locally as described in Section 6.1.9 .
6.7.6. Coagulation Parameters
Coagulation parameters, including PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen will be recorded during 
screening.  Re-testing of coagulation parameters throughout the study is only necessary if 
clinically indicated.

Hematology and serum chemistry central laboratory analyses, including thyroid function tests,
are to be performed according to the schedule in Table 2.   The same parameters assessed during 
screening are to be evaluated throughout the treatment period, upon treatment discontinuation and at the 28-day follow-up visit (see Section 6.1for details).  
Samples for hematology analysis will be collected pr ior to IP administration on Day 1 of each 
treatment cycle and prior to IP administration on other required days, when possible.  Samples will be processed as detailed in the study laboratory  manual and sent to the central laboratory for 
analysis and reporting.  The schedule of hemato logy assessments for enrolled subjects is as 
follows: 
!Cycles 1-2 – Days 1, 8, 15 and 22
!Cycles 3-12 – Days 1 and 15
!Cycles ≥1 3–D a y  1  
!Treatment Discontinuation Visit

Samples for serum chemistry analysis will be collected prior to IP administration on Day [ADDRESS_26705] 2 
cycles of treatment, if possible.  Samples will be processed as detailed in the study laboratory 
manual and sent to the central laboratory for analysis and reporting.  The schedule of serum chemistry assessments for enrolled subjects is as follows: 
!Cycles 1-2 – Days 1, 8, 15 and 22
!Cycles ≥3 – Day 1 
!Treatment Discontinuation Visit
!28-day Follow-up Visit
Any or all laboratory assessments may be repeated more frequently if clinically indicated.  In the 
event that an immediate laboratory assessment is required to acutely manage a subject, local 
laboratory tests may be used.  In addition to collecting the local laboratory sample, a second 
sample should be processed for shipment to the central laboratory.  If the subject management decision made based on the local laboratory result differs from the decision which the central lab 
result would have resulted in (when available), th e applicable local laboratory result(s) should be 
recorded in the appropriate CRF.
Refer to Section 11.[ADDRESS_26706] results

Whenever a bone marrow sample is collected, a peripheral blood sample and peripheral blood
smear is to be prepared as well.  Specific requirements for submission of bone marrow samples 
for central review are detailed in the Central Laboratory Manual.
6.8.2. Cytogenetics
Bone marrow cytogenetic testing is to be completed by [CONTACT_27680] a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_27531].  Note that specific handling of the biopsy is required in order to be used for cytogenetics testing.  See the 
Central Laboratory Manual for handling instructions.
6.8.3. International Working Group Modified Response Assessment
Hematologic response or improvement according to  criteria modified from that of the 
International Working Group (IWG) ( Appendix F ) is to be assessed following every [ADDRESS_26712] IWG 
assessment repeated after every 3 cycles and at treatment discontinuation.
Due to the turnaround time required to obtain results from review of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_27505]/or biopsy, peripheral blood smear and cytoge netics, IWG response assessment may be done 
at any time prior to starting the next cycle of treatment.  Decisions regarding dose-modification 
and treatment continuation following IWG response assessment may be made based on available local assessments, if necessary, ahead of central hematology and bone marrow pathology 
assessments becoming available.  However, after at least [ADDRESS_26713] be notified as soon as possible (not later than the next scheduled study visit) to discontinue further study treatment and 
to schedule the treatment discontinuation visit, as appropriate.

monotherapy, and 3 receiving combination therapy.
During the randomized treatment phase of the study, approximately 32 subjects with PD and 32 
subjects with SD will be randomized ev enly to receive either CC- 486 alone, or CC-486 + 
durvalumab.  There will be 4 cohorts (16 subjects in each) in Stage 1: SD treated with monotherapy, PD treated with monotherapy, SD treated with combination therapy and PD 
treated with combination therapy.
If there are 2 or fewer responses in either cohort during Stage 1, enrollment to that cohort w ill be 
terminated.  Otherwise, the cohort will continue to  Stage 2 and accrue an additional 25 subjects 
each. If 8 or more responses are observed in these 41 subjects, the null hypothesis will be 
rejected for that cohort.
Therefore, the total number of subjects for the randomized treatment phase will range from 
approximately 64 (at Stage 1) to 164 (Stage 1 plus Stage 2) for the 4 cohorts. More subjects can 
potentially be recruited for replacement of non-evaluable subjects, if needed (see Figure 2 ).
The study population may include subjects with both lower- and higher-risk disease who meet
the following criteria.
7.2. Inclusion Criteria
Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:
1. Male or female, ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent document
2. Documented diagnosis of MDS, classified according to FAB classification criteria

3. Adequate course of treatment with an injectable hypomethyl ating agent (azacitidine for 
injection or decitabin e) as the last therapeutic inte rvention for MDS prior to beginning 
screening for this study 
Adequate is defined as: 
∀having received at least 6 consecutive 4-week treatment cycles  with azacitidine 
for injection, or
∀having received at least 4 consecutive 6-week treatment cycles with decitabine (3-
day regimen) or at least 6 consecutive 4-week treatment cycles with decitabine (5-

or decitabine 5-day regimen; two 42-day cycles of decitabine 3-day regimen.
4. Documented disease progression or stable disease as best response to treatment (or 
attempted treatment) with azacitidine for injection or decitabine.  Those achieving an 
objective response to treatment regimen with an injectable HMA ( Appendix F ) are 
excluded from participation in this study.
Definitions of disease progression are modified from IWG 2006 criteria ( Appendix F ) 
and include:
∀Pre-injectable HMA baseline bone marrow myeloblasts:
oLess than 5%: ≥100% increase to ≥8% blasts
o≥ 5%: ≥50% increase to ≥10% blasts
Note:  ≥ 30% blasts is considered AML per FAB classification.  Subjects known to 
have ≥ 30% blasts are not eligible for inclusion in this study.  Recognizing limitations 
of blast cell quantification, this protoc ol will allow subjects with pre-enro llment bone 
marrow blast counts up to 33% on the screening bone marrow examination to be 
considered for inclusion.  Assessment may  be made according to local bone marrow 
examination to facilitate enrollment of eligible subjects into the treatment phase of the study.  
∀Any clinical worsening from pre-injectable HMA baseline condition, including:
osustained clinically-significant worsening (investigator’s assessment) from 
baseline granulocyte, platelet, or hemoglobin values ( ≥ 2 values, separated by 
≥ 2 weeks)
worsening granulocytes should be ≥ 50% decrease from pre-injectable 
HMA baseline value
worsening platelets should be ≥ 50% decrease from pre-injectable
HMA baseline value (untransfused)
worsening hemoglobin should be ≥ 1.5 g/dL decrease from pre-
injectable HMA baseline value in subjects not receiving RBC 
transfusions
omeaningful worsening in RBC or pl atelet transfusion requir ement
Definition of stable disease is based on modified IWG 2006 criteria ( Appendix F ):
∀Failure to achieve any objective response (CR, PR, mCR, or HI), but no evidence 
of disease progression within the [ADDRESS_26730]’s first dose of IPin this study (Cycle 1, Day 1).
5. Have the last dose of the prior treatmen t regimen (injectable HMA – azacitidine for 
injection or decitabine) not more than 16 weeks prior to screening for this study (date of informed consent signature).
6. No less than [ADDRESS_26731] dose of the prior treatment regimen (injectable 
HMA – azacitidine for injecti on or decitabine) and the planned date of first dose of IP.

(36%F to 46 %F) and must be used before the individually assigned expi[INVESTIGATOR_27541].
Durvalumab will no longer be supplied during the Extension Phase as no subjects are being 
treated with durvalumab.
8.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule
After the safety run-in is complete and the CC- 486 dose and regimen to be used in combination 
with durvalumab is established, eligible subjects will be randomized to receive CC-486 alone or 
in combination with durvalumab in the ra ndomized tr eatment phase of the study.  All 
randomized subjects will receive CC-486 orally ad ministered tablets at the established dose and 
schedule. The schedule will include BID dosing on days 1-21 of each 28-day tr eatment cycle. 
Subjects randomized to the combination ther apy arm will receive durv alumab, 1500 mg on    
Day 1 of each 28-day treatment cycle by [CONTACT_27688] 1 hour (± 5 minutes).
CC-486 tablets should be ingested approximately  1 hour after completion of the durvalumab 
infusion on Day 1 of each  treatment cycle (except for Cycle 1 in which CC-486 is given on
Day -1 for PK sub-study subjects) as described in Section 8.2.2 .  In the event of unacceptable 
toxicity, CC-486 dose and schedule may be modified (see Section 8.2.4 ).  Infusions of 
durvalumab may be interrupted, slowed, or discont inued in order to address toxicity, but dose 
reduction of durvalumab is not permitted (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).

or hematological), who remain in stable disease, or do not experience modified IWG 2006 
hematologic improvement (HI) or better (PR, CR or marrow CR – modified IWG 2006, 
Appendix F ) after [ADDRESS_26749] their dose increased at the discretion of the 
investigator and in discussion with the medical monitor as described in Section 8.2.4 and
Table 3 . Again, dose and schedule may be adjusted as described in Section 8.2.4 in order to 
manage toxicity.  
Subjects may continue to receive the protocol-prescribed therapy for as long as they benefit from 
the treatment (Section 4.1.3 ) or until treatment is discontinued for reasons detailed in Section 12.  
Prior to discontinuing a subject, it is reco mmended that the investigator contact [CONTACT_27683].  However, the 
decision to discontinue a subject remains the responsibility of the treating physician and will not 
be delayed or refused by [CONTACT_456].
8.2.1. Investigational Product Dispensation8.2.1.1. CC-486 Dispensation
CC-486 will be dispensed on Day 1 of each treatment cycle (except for Cycle 1 in which CC-486 
is given on Day -1 for PK sub-study subjects).
Only [ADDRESS_26750] at this time unless extreme extenuating 
circumstances apply and other arrangements are agreed to by [CONTACT_456]’s medical monitor in 
writing.  
The subject may not receive IP for each treatment cycle until all Day [ADDRESS_26751] been 
completed and all IP from the previous cycle is accounted for (where applicable).  
For FCBP subjects, a pregnancy test must be pe rformed, and a negative result verified by [CONTACT_1275], within 72 hours prior to IP administration on Day 1 of each treatment cycle.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Durvalumab Dispensation
Total in-use storage time from needle puncture of durvalumab vial to start of administration 
should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). If in-use storage time exceeds these limits, a new dose must be prepared from new vials. Infusion 
solutions must be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to commencement of 
administration. Durvalumab does not contain preservatives and any unused portion must be discarded.
Sites should follow standard and local aseptic procedures and the clinical study protocol for all 
activities. All dispensing activit ies should be documented according to local procedures.
The shelf lives stated above are based on chemical and physical stability; assignment of 
microbial shelf life is the responsibility of th e clinical center and should be aligned with local 
procedure for managing microbial risk as long as the times specified in this section are not exceeded. Vials should be used for the specific subjects to whom they are assigned, and must not 
be shared between subjects.

in dose due to an adverse event).
Investigational product is scheduled to be tak en on the first 21 days of each 28-day tr eatment 
cycle, unless there has been a schedule modification of CC-486 administration due to toxicity.  
Subjects will be instructed to take CC-486 twice daily, in the morning and evening, at 
approximately the same times each day.  It is recommended that an antiemetic medication be taken 30 minutes prior to CC-486 administration during Cycle 1.  If nausea / vomiting is not 
significant, antiemetic prophylaxis may not be needed.  Subject will ingest CC-486 tablets with 
approximately 240 mL (8 ounces) of room temperature water.  Investigational product may be taken on an empty stomach or with food (a  light breakfast or meal of up to approximately 600 
calories can be provided as a guidance).
Subjects assigned to the combination treatment arm will take their first dose of CC-[ADDRESS_26754] dose of CC-
486 on PK days (ie, Cycle 1 Day -1 and Cycle 2 Day 1) is described below:

durvalumab administration, within 5 minutes of completing the durvalumab infusion, and at 30 
minutes (± 5 minutes) and 60 minutes (± 5 minutes) post infusion of durvalumab, followed by a 
2-hour (± 15 minutes) period of observation.
In the event of a ≤Grade 2 infusion-related reaction, the infusion rate of durvalumab may be 
decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution of the event (up to 4 hours) and re-initiated at 
50% of the initial rate until completion of th e infusion. For subjects with a ≤Grade 2 
infusion-rel ated reaction, subsequent infusions may be  administered at 50% of the initial rate.
Acetaminophen and/or an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine) or equivalent medications per 
institutional standard may be administered at the discretion of the investigator. If the infusion-rel ated reaction is ≥Grade 3 or higher in severity, IP will be discontinued.

8.2.4. Dose Modifications and Toxicity Management8.2.4.1. CC-486 (Oral Azacitidine) Dose Modification and Toxicity Management
All efforts should be made to maintain treatment with CC-[ADDRESS_26760] at unacceptable risk in the investigator´s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] 
(eg, Grade 4 neutropenia), CC-[ADDRESS_26761] possibly related to treatment.
A minimum CC-486 dose and schedule of 100 mg BID 14/28d (or 200 mg QD 14/28d) is 
permitted in the event of toxicity (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who cannot tolerate this minimum dose 
and schedule should discontinue the treatmen t phase of the study a nd enter follow-up.  
Subjects who have their CC-486 dose reduced or treat ment schedule modified may return to their 
original dose and/or schedule in a stepwise fa shion upon discussion and documented agreement 
between the investigator and the medical monitor, provided that at least two treatment cycles have proven tolerable at the current dose and schedule.  The treatment schedule should first be 
increased from 14/28 days to 21/28 days at 100 mg BID (or 200 mg QD if the rescue dosing 
option was utilized), followed by a stepwise es calation in dose (eg, 100 mg BID to 150 mg BID 
or 200 mg QD to 300 mg QD, etc.).  At least two treatment cycles without unacceptable drug-
related toxicity should precede any increase in dose or schedule.
In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, subjects who show signs of worsening disease (clinical
or hematological), who remain in stable disease, or do not experience modified IWG 2006 
hematologic improvement (HI) or better (PR, CR or marrow CR – modified IWG 2006, 
Appendix F ) after [ADDRESS_26762] their dose increased at the discretion of the 
investigator and in discussion with the medical monitor as described in Section 6.5and Table 3 . 
Again, dose and schedule may be adjusted as described in Section 8.2.4 in order to manage 
toxicity.

Dose Modification for Neutropenia Grade 4
For subjects entering the study with pre-existing Neutropenia Grade 4, treatment should be 
started at the regular starting dose and schedule of 200 mg BID 21/28d.  However, if neutropenia continues to worsen under treatment, dose modification may be considered as summarized in

Events
Dose Modifications Toxicity Management
General Considerations
Drug administration modifications of IP/study regimen will be 
made to manage potential immune-mediated AEs based on severity 
of treatment-emergent toxicities graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03.
In addition to the criteria for per manent discontinu ation of IP/study 
regimen based on CTC grade/severity (table below), permanently discontinue IP/study regimen for the following conditions: 
!Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤ 10 mg of 
prednisone per day (or equivalent) within [ADDRESS_26771] dose of IP/ study regimen
!Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 
treatment-related AE following resumption of dosing. 
Grade 1 - No dose modification
Grade 2 - Hold IP/study regimen dose until Grade 2 resolution to
≤ Grade 1
!If toxicity worsens, then treat as Grade 3 or Grade 4
!IP/study treatment can be resumed once event stabilizes to 
Grade ≤1 after completion of steroid taper
!Subjects with endocrinop athies who may require 
prolonged or continued steroid replacement can be retreated with IP/study regimen on the following conditions: 1) the event stabilizes and is controlled, 2) the subject is clin ically stable as per Investigator or treating 
physician’s clinical judgement, and 3) doses of prednisone are at less than or equal to 10 mg/day or 
equivalent.
Grade 3 - Depending on the individual toxicity, IP/study regimen 
may be permanently discontinued. Please refer to guidelines below
Grade 4 - Permanently discontinue IP/study regimen It is recommended that management of immune-mediated adverse 
events (imAEs) follow the guidelines presented in this table
- It is possible that events with an inflammatory or immune-
mediated mechanism could occur in nearly all organs, some of them not noted specifically in these guidelines.  Whether specific immune-mediated events (and/or laboratory indicators of such events) are noted in these guidelines or not, subjects should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (eg, disease progression, concomitant 
medications, infections, etc.) to a possible immune-mediated event. 
-In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all such events 
should be managed as if they were immune related.  General 
recommendations follow.
-Symptomatic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_27549]-grade (Grade 1 or 2, unless otherwise specified) events.
-For persistent (greater than 3 to 5 days) low-grade (Grade 2) 
or severe (Grade ≥ 3) events promptly start oral prednisone 1-
2 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent.
-Some events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or 
mortality – eg, myo-carditis, or other similar events even if 
they are not currently noted in the guidelines – should progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_27550] (methylprednisolone at 2 to 4 mg/kg/day) even if the event is Grade 2, and if clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_27551]/or there has been clinical confirmation. Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician, and promptly pursue specialist consultation.
-If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering 
(28 days of taper), increase the corticosteroid dose (prednisone dose [eg, up to 2-4 mg/kg/day PO or IV

discontinued in Grade 3 events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality – e g, myocarditis, or other 
similar events even if they are not currently noted in the guidelines. Similarly, consider whether IP/study regimen

discontinuation of IP for Grade 4 events (ie, 
hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Type 1 diabetes)equivalent]) until stabilization or improvement of symptoms, 
then resume corticosteroid tapering at a slower rate (> 28 days of taper).
−More potent immunosuppressives such as TNF inhibitors (eg
infliximab) – (also refer to individual sections of the immune mediated adverse events for specific type of immunosuppressive) should be considered for events not responding to systemic steroids.  Progression to use of more potent immunosuppressives should proceed more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_27553]/or mortality –
eg, myocarditis, or other similar events even if they are not currently noted in the guidelines – when these events are not

−With long-term steroid and other immunosuppressive use, 
consider need for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP, formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) prophylaxis, gastrointestinal protection, and glucose monitoring.
-Discontinuation of IP is not mandated for Grade 3 / Grade 4 
inflammatory reactions attributed to local tumor response (eg, 
inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph 
nodes, etc.). Continuation of IP in this situation should be based upon a benefit/risk analysis for that subject.

Pneumonitis/Interstitial 
Lung Disease (ILD)Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade:
−Monitor subjects for signs and symptoms of 
pneumonitis or ILD (new onset or worsening shortness of breath or cough). Subjects should be evaluated with imaging and pulmonary function tests, including other 
diagnostic procedures as described below.
−Initial work-up may include clinical evaluation, 
monitoring of oxygenation via pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), laboratory work-up, and high- resolution CT scan.
Grade 1
(asymptomatic, 
clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated)No dose modifications required. 
However, consider holding IP/study 
regimen dose as clinically appropriate and during diagnostic work-up for 
other etiologies.For Grade 1 (radiographic changes only):
−Monitor and closely follow up in 2 to 4 days for clinical 
symptoms, pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), and 
laboratory work-up and then as clinically indicated.
−Consider Pulmonary and Infectious disease consult.
Grade 2
(symptomatic; 
medical intervention indicated; limiting 
instrumental ADL)Hold IP/study regimen dose until 
Grade 2 resolution to Grade ≤1.
!If toxicity worsens, then treat as 
Grade 3 or Grade 4.
!If toxicity improves to Grade ≤1, 
then the decision to reinitiate IP/study regimen will be based upon treating physician’s clinical judgment and after completion of 
steroid taper.For Grade 2 (mild to moderate new symptoms):
−Monitor symptoms daily and consider hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
−Promptly start systemic steroids (eg, prednisone 1 to 
2 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent).
−Reimage as clinically indicated.
−If no improvement within 3 to 5 days, additional workup 
should be considered and prompt treatment with IV 
methylprednisolone 2 to 4 mg/kg/day started
−If still no improvement within 3 to 5 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_27554] 2 to 4 mg/kg/day, promptly start immunosuppressive therapy such as TNF inhibitors 
(eg, infliximab at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Caution: It is 
important to rule out sepsis and refer to infliximab label 
for general guidance before using infliximab.

Peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes
(such as Guillain-Barre 
and myasthenia gravis)Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade:
−The prompt diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral 
neuromotor syndromes is important, since certain subjects may unpredictably experience acute decompensations that can result in substantial morbidity or in the worst case, death. Special care should be taken 
for certain sentinel symptoms that may predict a more 
severe outcome, such as prominent dysphagia, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_27567], and signs of respi[INVESTIGATOR_27568].
−Subjects should be evaluated to rule out any alternative 
etiology (eg, disease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes or medications). It should be noted that the diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes can be particularly challenging in subjects with underlying cancer, due to the multiple potential confounding effects of cancer (and its treatments) throughout the neuraxis.

Myocarditis Any Grade General Guidance
Discontinue drug permanently if 
biopsy-proven immune-mediated myocarditis.For Any Grade:
−The prompt diagnosis of immune-mediated myocarditis 
is important, particularly in subjects with baseline cardiopulmonary disease and reduced cardiac function. 
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study 
physician.
−Monitor subjects for signs and symptoms of myocarditis 
(new onset or worsening chest pain, arrhythmia, shortness of breath, peripheral edema). As some symptoms can overlap with lung toxicities, simultaneously evaluate for and rule out pulmonary 
toxicity as well as other causes (eg, pulmonary 
embolism, congestive heart failure, malignant pericardial effusion). A Cardiology consultation should be obtained early, with prompt assessment of whether and when to complete a cardiac biopsy, including any 
other diagnostic procedures.

Myositis/Polymyositis (“Poly/myositis”)Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade:
−Monitor subjects for signs and symptoms of 
poly/myositis. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], muscle weakness/pain occurs 
in proximal muscles including upper arms, thighs, shoulders, hips, neck and back, but rarely affects the extremities including hands and fingers; also difficulty breathing and/or trouble swallowing can occur and 
progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. Increased general feelings of tiredness 
and fatigue may occur, and there can be new-onset falling, difficulty getting up from a fall, and trouble climbing stairs, standing up from a seated position, 
and/or reaching up.
−If poly/myositis is suspected, a Neurology consultation 
should be obtained early, with prompt guidance on diagnostic procedures. Myocarditis may co-occur with poly/myositis; refer to guidance under Myocarditis. Given breathing complications, refer to guidance under Pneumonitis/ILD. Given possibility of an existent (but previously unknown) autoimmune disorder, consider 
Rheumatology consultation.
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study 
physician.
−Initial work-up should include clinical evaluation, 
creatine kinase, aldolase, LDH, BUN/creatinine,

Confidential and Propri etary 126 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: [ADDRESS_26784] continue to meet entry criteria regarding 
renal and hepatic function (see Section 7.3).  Thus subjects will have laboratory assessments 
performed to evaluate organ function prior to s tarting each cycle (including Cycle 1).  Because of
the time it takes to obtain results from the central laboratory, samples should be collected early 
enough prior to starting the next cycle in order to allow sufficient time for review.  In the event 
that immediate laboratory assessment is needed, local laboratory measurement is acceptable for starting the next cycle pending the outcome of the central laboratory assessment (ie, in addition 
to collecting the local laboratory sample, a matching sample should always be sent to the central 
laboratory).
The start of the next cycle will be delayed if the subject does not meet entry criteria regarding 
renal and hepatic function.  If there is a delay of more than 42 days (6 weeks) in the start of the 
next cycle, the med ical monitor must be  consulted.  Study treatment should be discontinued if 
there is a delay of more than 56 days (8 weeks) in the start of the next cycle, unless, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_27581], the subject is experiencing clinical benefit.  
Justification of the subject continuing in the study  must be recorded in the source documents.
Prior to discontinuing a subject, it is reco mmended that the investigator contact [CONTACT_27683].  The decision 
to discontinue a subject remains the responsib ility of the treating physician and will not be 
delayed or refused by [CONTACT_456].
8.2.6. Overdose
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, refers to CC-[ADDRESS_26785], regardless of any associated adverse events or sequelae.
On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as any amount more frequent than the 
protocol-required schedule or frequency. On an infusi on rate basis, an overdose is defined as any 
rate faster than the protocol-specified rate. 
!For oral, any amount over the protocol-specified dose
!For IV, 10% over the protocol-specified dose
Complete data about drug administration, including any overdose, regardless of whether the 
overdose was accidental or intentional, should be reported in the case report form. See Section 11.[ADDRESS_26786] and/or from the study:

should be recorded in the CRF and in the source documents.
8.3. Method of Treatment Assignment
Subjects will be enrolled via IRTS to ensure time ly registration and to facilitate subject tracking 
and IP resupply needs.
Investigator or designated site staff will be assigned password protected, coded identif ication 
numbers that give them authorization to call into the IRTS to enroll a subject.  At screening, the investigator or designated staff will call into th e IRTS and provide the requested identifying 
information for the subject.  The IRTS will then confirm the assignment of a unique subject 
number.  Once assigned to a subject, the subject number will not be reused.  If a subject is screened but not enrolled, the screen-failure must  be registered using the IRTS.  During the 
treatment phase, calls will be placed to the IRTS for each new allocation of IP to a subject, to 
acknowledge receipt of additional IP shipments to the site, and to register changes in a subject’s status (eg, drug hold, dose modification, or treatment discontinuation).  Details regarding use of 
the IRTS are found in the IRTS User Manual.

number, IP name, dosage form and strength (where applicable), amount of IP per container, lot 
number, expi[INVESTIGATOR_5695] (where applicable), medication identification/kit number, dosing 
instructions, storage conditions, and required caution statements and/or re gulatory statements as 
applicable. Additional information may be in cluded on the label as applicable per local 
regulations.
No blinding is applied in this study.
8.5. Clinical Supplies
The investigator(s) or designee(s) is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of IP 
received and comparing it with the accompanying shippi[INVESTIGATOR_27582].  The investigator(s) or 
designee(s) will verify the accuracy of the information on the form and call the IRTS to register 
the IP received at the site.  
At the study site, all IP will be stored according to the storage conditions described on the IP 
packaging label in a locked, safe area to prevent unauthorized access.  The IP must be stored as directed on the package label at a controlled temperature, and a temperature log must be 
maintained in the source documents.
8.6. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal 
Investigational product accountability will be assessed by [CONTACT_1719].  Applicable information such as lot number, tabl et or vial count, and expi[INVESTIGATOR_27583], as well as information provided by [CONTACT_27701] (eg, subject dosing 
diary).  
Investigational product accountability s hould be a ssessed before drug dispensing for each 
subsequent treatment cycle in the treatment phase, starting on Day 1 of Cycle 2, and at the treatment discontinuation visit.
The investigator(s) or designee(s) is responsible for accounting for all IP that is issued and 
returned by [CONTACT_27702].  Any unused IP must be return ed by a study subject and retained by [CONTACT_27703] a Celgene representative (or designee).  If 
any IP is lost or damaged, its disposition should be documented.  At periodic monitoring visits, a Celgene representative (or designee) will conduct IP accountability and address any 
discrepancies.  Upon satisfactory reconciliation of all IP, returned IP may be destroyed.  At the 
conclusion of the study, all remaining IP will be  counted, reconciled with dispensing records, 
documented, and destroyed at the clinic site or allocated drug destruction location after 
completion of drug accountability by a Celgene representative (or designee).  The Celgene 
representative (or designee) will ensure that a final report of drug accountability to the unit dose level (ie, tablet) be prepared and placed in both the investigator study file and the central clinical 
study file.
A copy of the site’s Standard Operating Pro cedure (SOP) for drug destruction may be collected 
by [CONTACT_456] (or designee).  Any revisions to a site’s destruction process must be provided and

8.7. Investigational Product Compliance
Subjects will self-administer CC-[ADDRESS_26789] (or legally aut horized re presentative) on scheduled clinic visit days.  Subjects (or 
legally authorized representative) will be asked to record IP dosing information in the diary card and to bring the diary card and unused tablets in the blister card (or the blister card packaging 
even if it is empty) with them to scheduled clinic visits (ie, prior to the start of the next treatment 
cycle).  A diary card and tablet compliance check w ill be performed by [CONTACT_3462].  Diary
cards must be saved and kept with the sour ce documentation.  Study site personnel will perform 
an IP administration compliance check and record this information in the subject’s source 
documentation and on the appropriate CRF.

Confidential and Propri etary 130 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun [ZIP_CODE]. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS AND PROCEDURES
All prior and concomitant medications (prescri ption and non-prescription), treatments, and 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_27585] 28 days (4 weeks) prior to th e first dose of IP, up to [ADDRESS_26790] 
dose of CC-486 (90 days for durvalumab), or up to the last study visit, whichever date is later, 
must be recorded on the appropriate CRF.  
All prior treatments for MDS, including ESAs, thrombopoiesis-stimulating agents (TSAs), iron-
chelating agents, chemotherapy, cyto toxic therapy, investigational agents, or other medications 
considered supportive care for MDS should be recorded on the respective CRF(s) regardless of discontinuation date of treatment.
Concomitant medications should be kept to a minimum during the study.  However, if
considered necessary for the subject’s welfare and are unlikely to interfere with the IP, they may be given at the discretion of the investigator.
9.1. Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Best supportive care may be used in combination wi th study therapy if deemed necessary.  Best 
supportive care for this study includes, but is not limited to, treatment with RBC or whole blood transfusions, fresh frozen plasma transfusions, single donor or pooled donor platelet transfusions, 
antibiotic, antiviral and/or antifungal therapy, nutritional support as needed, and myeloid growth 
factors (G-CSF and GM-CSF) for subjects experiencing neutropenic infections. The use of myeloid growth factors is also allowed for secondary prophylaxis under certain conditions as 
described below.  The use of these products will be considered as concomitant treatment and 
documented as concomitant medications, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21882].  
Blood product support (RBCs and platelets) may be administered according to institutional 
standards.  RBC and platelet transfusions will be considered concomitant procedures and should 
be collected on the appropriate CRF.
Subjects who are currently using iron-chelating agents should be on a stable or decreasing dose 
for at least 8 weeks (56 days) prior to enrollment.  Initiation, modification, and/or 
discontinuation of iron-chelating agents during the treatment phase of the study is discouraged and should be discussed with the medical monitor first whenever possible.
Subjects may be administered supportive and palliative care (eg, pain control) as clinically 
indicated throughout the study.
It is recommended that an antiemetic medication such as a serotonin 5-HT
3receptor antagonist 
(eg, ondansetron) be taken 30 minutes prior to IP administration during Cycle 1 of the treatment 
phase.  If nausea/vomiting is not significant, further antiemetic prophylaxis may not be needed.  Pre-treatment or post-treatment with a serotonin 5-HT
3receptor antagonists, or other locally 
available and appropriate antiemetic medication, will be considered concomitant treatment and 
should be recorded on the appropriate CRF.
Treatment with antidiarrheal medications is recommended at the first sign of diarrhea as per the 
guidelines in Appendix H.   Pre-medication with antidia rrheal medication for subsequent doses of 
CC-486 and/or durvalumab may be appropriate.  Pre- and post-treatment with an antidiarrheal must be recorded in the CRF as concomitant medication.

treatment of neutropenic fever/infections as well as for secondary prophylaxis if the subject had a 
previous event of neutropenic fever/infection or neutropenia Grade [ADDRESS_26791] is considered jeopardized by [CONTACT_27706][INVESTIGATOR_27586]/infections or Grade 4 neutropenia.
For subjects who develop an ANC < 0.5 x 10
9/L (or per institutional standards), administration 
of prophylactic fluoroquinolone antibiotics ( eg, ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or other 
recognized prophylactic antibiotics may be considered and documented as a concomitantmedication on the appropriate CRF.  If neutropenic f ever/infection occurs, treatment should 
consist of a broad spectrum antibiotic, and if the investigator deems the use of a myeloid growth 
factor to be medically important, myeloid growth factors may also be administered.  Forsecondary prophylaxis with myeloid growth factors, the dose modification guidelines detailed in
Section 8.2.[ADDRESS_26792] is on a stable or decreasing dose for ≥ [ADDRESS_26793] dose of IP.  
Initiation, modi fication, and/or discontinuation of corticosteroids during the treatment phase of 
the study is discouraged and should be discussed with the medical monitor first whenever 
possible.
9.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Best supportive care for this study specifically excludes cancer surgery, immunotherapy, 
biologic therapy, radiotherapy, anticancer hormonal therapy, and systemic chemotherapy where 
the goal is to eradicate or sl ow the progression of the disease.

10.1. Overview
This is an open-label, randomized 2-arm study  to estimate the efficacy of CC-486 as a mono-
therapy and CC-486 + durvalumab as a combinati on therapy in subjects with MDS who fail to 
achieve an objective response to treatment with azacitidine for injection or decitabine.
The study consists of 5 phases: Screening, Safety Run-in, Randomized Treatment, Follow-up, and
Extension . The randomized treatment phase will be conducted in 2 stages, with a fut ility 
assessment planned at the completion of Stage 1 to determine whether the null hypothesis (H0: p 
<12.5%) can be rejected with [ADDRESS_26797] populations for va rious statistical data an alyses, the justifications
of sample sizes for the cohorts, and the methodologies that will be used for the efficacy and
safety analyses. All statistical analyses specified in this protocol will be conducted using SAS® 
Version 9.[ADDRESS_26798] one dose of 
IP.
10.2.2. Modified Intent-to-Treat Population
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) populatio n includes all ITT subjects who have at least one 
post-baseline efficacy assessment performed, met all inclusion/exclusion criteria, and received a 
minimum of one cycle of treatment.
10.2.3. Safety Population
The safety population will incl ude all enrolled subjects who have received at least [ADDRESS_26799]-dose safety assessment.

10.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
The sample size required will be identical for each treatment arm in each cohort and is estimated 
using the optimal design of the Simon's two-stage design method ( Simon, 1989 ). The null 
hypothesis of the response rate will be tested against a one-sided alternative. 
For each cohort, the null hypothesis of the response rate (H0: p ≤ 0.125) will be tested against the 
alternative hypothesis of th e response rate (H1: p ≥ 0.27) with a type I error rate of 10% and 80% 
power. During the first stage, [ADDRESS_26801] ical

Confidential and Propri etary 135 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019Supportive efficacy analyses will also be performed using the evaluable population.
10.6.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary assessment of efficacy will be the overall rate of response (defined as CR, PR, or 
mCR), and HI as determined using the modified IWG 2006 response criteria for MDS(Appendix F ).  For hematologic response, CR, PR, and mCR will be determined by [CONTACT_27708] (with confirmation by [CONTACT_27709]), while HI will be derived.  The percentage of 
subjects with the other response outcomes of stable disease, failure, relapse after CR or PR, and disease progression will also be presented.  Percentages will also be presented separately for CR, 
PR, mCR, and HI.
The percent of responders will be estimated using 95% confidence intervals for proportions.  Hematologic response (Complete R emission [CR], Partial Remission [PR], Marrow CR [mCR], 
Stable Disease [SD], Failure, Relapse after CR or PR, and Cytogenetic Response) is defined 
according to modified IWG 2006 criteria ( Appendix F ).  Subjects will be classified according to 
their best response achieved during treatment for the response categories of CR, PR, mCR, SD, 
and failure.  Only subjects who achieve CR or PR will be included in the Relapse after CR or PR 
category.  Subjects will be evaluated for cytogenetic response regardless of their response status in other categories.  For cytogenetic response, s ubjects will be classified as having a complete or 
partial response based on the best response ach ieved during treatment.  Hematologic response 
will be presented descriptively using counts and percentages. 
The response rates at the end of Stage 2 and the associated 95% confidence interval will be 
estimated for each cohort which completes Stage 2. Similar estimates for Stage 1 w ill be 
provided for any cohort which does not  continue to Stage 2. The response rates at the end of 
Stage 2 will be compared between c ohorts of SD and PD subjects (if both cohorts finished   
Stage 2) using the relative risk ratio or ot her appropriate methods. Specifically, if relative risk 
method is used, the ratio of response rates for both cohorts and the associated 95% confidence interval will be estimated. 
10.6.2. Secondary Efficacy Analyses
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overall Survival
Overall survival (OS), time to death from any cause, will be calculated using date of first dose 
and date of death, or date of last follow-up for censored subjects. Time to death from any cause is defined as the time between first dose and death from any cause. All subjects will be followed 
until drop-out, death, or study termination. Drop-out  may be due to withdrawal of consent from 
further data collection or loss to follow-up. Subjects who drop-out or are alive at study termination will have their OS times censored at the time of last contact, as appropriate.  The OS 
curve will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) method.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Time to Onset of Response
Time to onset of first response is defined as the time between the date of first IP dose and the 
earliest date any response (CR, PR, mCR, or HI) is first observed.  Subjects who do not achieve any defined response during the treatment period will be censored at the date of treatment 
discontinuation, disease progression, or death, whichever occurs first.  Time to onset of best

[IP_ADDRESS]. Duration of Response
Duration of hematologic response/improvement will be determined only for subjects who 
achieve a response on treatment.  Duration of hematologic response/improvement is defined as 
the time from the date response/improvement is first observed until the date the subject has a 
subsequently documented relapse or disease progression as defined by [CONTACT_27710] 2006 criteria.  Subjects who maintain hematologic response/improvement through the end of the 
treatment period will be censored at the date of treatment discontinuation or death, whichever 
occurs first.  Duration of response will be assessed for both first response and best response.  Duration of hematologic response/improvement for the treatment group w ill be es timated using 
KM method.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Progression-free Survival
Progression-free survival (PFS), time to disease progression or death from any cause, will be 
calculated using date of first dose of IP and the earliest of date of disease progression or date of death, or date of last follow-up for censored subjects. Time to disease progression or death from 
any cause is defined as the time between first dose and the earliest of disease progression or 
death from any cause. All subjects will be followed until drop-out, death, or study termination. Drop-out may be due to withdrawal of consen t from further data collection or loss to follow-up. 
Subjects who drop-out or are alive without disease progression at study termination will have 
their PFS times censored at the time of last contact, as appropriate.  The PFS curve will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) method.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Stable Disease
!A subject will be considered as having a stable disease if the disease neither 
responded nor progressed during or after the treatment. 
!The duration of stable disease will be defined as the time between any two 
observations of objective disease progression (modified IWG criteria – Appendix F ), 
starting from the first day of dosing wi th IP.  Note, objective disease progression 
requires two observations demonstrating progressive disease, at least [ADDRESS_26804] observation that is not 
followed by a discordant observation within the subsequent 8 weeks.  
!Subjects who maintain stable disease through the end of the treatment period will be 
censored at the date of study termination.  
!Duration of stable disease will be estimated using KM method.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Disease Progression to AML
!Time to AML progression is defined as the time from the date of first dose of IP until 
the date the subject has documented progression to AML. 
!Subjects who do not progress to AML will be censored at the date of last follow-up, 
the date of death, or the date of study termination.

10.7. Safety Analysis
The safety population will be used for all safety evaluations.
Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
Adverse event listings will include the verbatim term and the MedDRA preferred term.  Adverse 
events will be summarized by [CONTACT_27711]. Adverse events, as well as treatment-emergent AEs, will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], and preferred term.  Adverse events 
leading to death or to discontinuation from treatment, events classified as NCI CTCAE (Version 
4.03) Grade [ADDRESS_26805] (AESI) will be su mmarized separately.  
Clinical laboratory results will be summarized descri ptively and will include a display of change 
from baseline.  Laboratory values outside of th e normal ranges will be identified.  Clinically 
significant hematologic and non-hematologic la boratory abnormalities that meet Grade [ADDRESS_26806] at each visit.  Descriptive statistics for 
vital signs, both observed values and changes from baseline, will be summarized.
10.8. Interim Analysis
An Independent Data Monitoring Co mmit tee will review the safety data during the safety run-in 
phase. The committee will also review the efficacy and safety data during the randomized phase 
of the study, in addition to the recommendation for any cohort to continue to Stage 2 of the 
study. The details of the data monitoring plan will be provided in a separate charter document.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Plasma Concentrations
By-subject listing of pharmacokinetic blood sample collection times as well as derived sampling 
time deviations will be provided.  CC-486 plasma concentrations will be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, standard error, minimum, median, 
maximum, percent coefficient of variation, geometric mean, and geometric percent coefficient of 
variation) for each cycle, if/when appropriate.  Concentrations that are below the limit of quantification (BLQ) will be treated as zero for the computation of descriptive statistics. Missing 
concentrations and concentrations from blood s amples coll ected more than ± 10% of nominal 
time will be omitted from the calculation of descriptive statistics.

be graphically presented on linear and semi-logarithmic scales.
Following single dose administration, predose samples that are BLQ or missing will be assigned 
a numerical value of zero for the calculation of AUC .  Any anomalous concentration values 
observed at predose will be identified in the clinical study report and used for the computation of 
AUC.  Pharmacokinetic parameters will be computed if the anomalous value is not greater than 
5% of the C max.  If the anomalous value is greater than 5% of C max, the computed 
pharmacokinetic parameters for the given subject will be dropped from the pharmacokinetic 
analysis.  
Any other BLQ concentrations will be assigned a value of zero if they precede quantifiable 
samples in the initial portion of the profile.  A BLQ value that occurs between quantifiable data 
points, especially prior to C max, will be evaluated to determine if an assigned concentration of 
zero makes sense, or if reanalysis or exclusion of the data is warranted.  Following C max, BLQ 
values embedded between 2 quantifiable data points will be treated as missing when calculating 
AUC.  BLQ values occurring at the end of the collection interval (after the last quantifiable 
concentration) will be treated as missing data.  If consecutive BLQ concentrations are followed by [CONTACT_27712], these quantified 
values will be excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis by [CONTACT_27713] a value of missing, 
unless otherwise warranted by [CONTACT_27714]-time profile.  For the purpose of analysis, these 
trailing BLQ values may be designated as zero in the dataset if the pharmacokinetic program 
used to do the analysis (such as WinNonlin
®) will treat trailing zero values as missing when 
calculating AUC.
Actual sampling times will be used in the calcu lations of pharmacokinetic parameters that will be 
derived using noncompartmental methods with Phoenix™ WinNonlin®Professional Version 6.3, 
or higher, (Pharsight®, a Certara™ company, St. Louis, Missouri).  Graphics may be prepared 
with SAS Version 9.1, or higher; or Excel 2007, or higher; Phoenix™ WinNonlin®Professional 
6.3, or higher; or S-Plus 8.2., or hi gher (MS MIAMI, Miami, [LOCATION_012]).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Parameters
The following PK parameters will be calculated for CC-486:
AUC inf Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from Time 0 
extrapolated to infinity, calculated as [AUC t+ Ct/∋z].  Ct is the last 
quantifiable concentration. No AUC extrapolation will be performed 
with unreliable ∋z.  If AUC %Extrap is ≥25%, AUC inf will not be 
reported

Confidential and Propri etary 140 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 201911. ADVERSE EVENTS
11.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may 
appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a 
worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject’s health, 
including laboratory test values (as specified by [CONTACT_14540] 11.3), regardless of 
etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or 
intensity of a pre-existing condition) should be  considered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndrome 
should be recorded on the AE page of the CRF rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. 
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an
AE. Overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on the overdose CRF. (See Section 8.2.6 for the definition of overdose.) Any sequelae
of an accidental or intentional overdose of an investigational product should be reported as an 
AE on the AE CRF. If the sequelae of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequelae must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE CRF. The overdose resulting in the SAE should 
be identified as the cause of the event on the SAE report form and CRF but should not be 
reported as an SAE itself.
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for CC-486 or 
durvalumab overdose. Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all of the following parameters:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, pathological, radiological or surgical findings , physical examination findings, or findings from 
other tests and/or procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_27717] [ADDRESS_26809]’s source documents.  All 
SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge 
of the event by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
11.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to: 
11.2.1. Seriousness

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 141 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019!Is life-threatening (ie, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE);
!Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27588] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay);
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
!Constitutes an important medical event.
Important medical events are defined as thos e occurrences that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:
!The administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied 
indication.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a comp lication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
!A procedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, 
endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling).  However, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27590] a complication of such procedures 
remains a reportable SAE.
!Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27591], practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE.
!A procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to starting of treatment on st udy); must 
be documented in the source document and the CRF.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication remains a reportable SAE.
!An elective treatment of or an elective pr ocedure for a pre-existing condition 
unrelated to the studied indication. 
!Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the CRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the investigator will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to IP, action taken regarding IP, and outcome.
11.2.2. Severity / Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator must assess the severity / intensity of the event.

EDMS Doc. Number: CC-486 (Oral Azacitidine)
Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 142 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019The severity / intensity of AEs will be grade d based upon the subject’s symptoms according to 
the current active minor version of the Commo n Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE, Version 4.03).
AEs that are not defined in the CTCAE should  be evaluated for severity / intensity according to 
the following scale:
!Grade 1 = Mild – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required
!Grade 2 = Moderate – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may 
be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required
!Grade 3 = Severe – marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; 
medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27594]
!Grade 4 = Life threatening – extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance 
required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27595]
!Grade 5 = Death - the event results in death
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is notthe same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.  
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a gui de for defining regulatory obligations.
11.2.3. Causality 
The investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: Means a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP 
administration is unlikely or remote , or other medications, 
therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observed event.
Suspected: Means there is a reasonable possibility that the administration 
of IP caused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibility’ means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the adverse event.
Causality s hould be a ssessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information.  Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional IP 
that has not been manufactured or provided by [CONTACT_27718], please provide the name [CONTACT_27765].

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 143 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: [ADDRESS_26810] of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
11.2.5. Action Taken
The investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg, discontinuation, interruption, or reduction of IP, as appropriate) and report if concomitant and/or additional treatments were given for the event. 
11.2.6. Outcome
The investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered or death (due to the 
SAE). 
11.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:
!results in discontinuation from the study;
!requires treatment, modification/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervention; or
!is judged to be of significant clinical importance.
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory a bnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.  
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF.  If the abnormality was not a 
part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the labor atory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. If 
possible, the laboratory abnormality should be r ecorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnormal laboratory result (eg, record throm bocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).
11.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in either a female subject or partner of a 
male subject are immediately reportable events.
11.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential:
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on IP, or within [ADDRESS_26811]’s last dose of IP, are considered immediately reportable events.  IP is to be discontinued 
immediately and the subject instructed to return any unused portion of the IP to the investigator.  The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene 
Drug Safety immediately by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Initial 
Report Form, or approved equivalent form.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 144 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: [ADDRESS_26812] 
notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follo w-up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the investigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Ce lgene Drug Safety by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report 
Form, or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_26813] to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant d eath after 28 days that the investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the 
event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
11.4.2. Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking IP becomes pregnant while the male subject is on IP, 
or within [ADDRESS_26814]’s last dose of IP, the male subject taking IP should notify 
the investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call their healthcare provider immed iately.  Where applicable, the IP may need to be discontinued in the male subject, 
but may be resumed later at the discreti on of the investigator and medical monitor.
11.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF. All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  This 
instruction pertains to initial SAE repo rts as well as any follow-up reports.
The investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that occur during the study 
from the time the subject signs informed consent until [ADDRESS_26815] dose of durvalumab, or until the Treatment Discontinuation Visit, whichever is later, and any SAE made known to the investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of 
being related to IP.  SAEs occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be collected.
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include a concise summary
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27598].  If a subject died and an autopsy has been 
performed, copi[INVESTIGATOR_27599] d eath certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug 
Safety as soon as these become available.  Any follow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safety.  
Where required by [CONTACT_19666], the investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/EC of 
the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow-up information about the event.

11.5.1. Safety Queries
Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from Celgene Drug Safety to the site via 
facsimile or electronic mail.  The response time is expected to be no more than five (5) business 
days.  Urgent queries (eg, missing causality assessment) may be handled by [CONTACT_648].
11.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events
For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of events suspected of being related to CC-486 based on the Investigator’s Brochure.
In the [LOCATION_002], all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be 
reported in an expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.
For countries within the European Economic Area (EEA), Celgene or its authorized 
representative will report in an expedited manner to Regulatory Authorities and Ethics 
Committees concerned, S[LOCATION_003]Rs in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC and the Detailed 
Guidance on collection, verification and presentation of adverse reaction reports arising from 
clinical trials on investigational products for human use (ENTR/CT3) and also in accordance with country-specific requirements.  
For the purpose of regulatory reporting in the EEA, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the 
expectedness of events suspected of being related to the other IP, durvalumab, based on the Durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure for the product.
Celgene or its authorized repres entative shall notify the investigator of the following information 
!Any AE suspected of being related to the use of IP in this study or in other studies 
that is both serious and unexpected (ie, S[LOCATION_003]R);
!Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for 
human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.
Where required by [CONTACT_19666], the investigator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly of 
these new serious and unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects.
The investigator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_27601]/EC.  (See Section 15.[ADDRESS_26818] retention 
information).

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 146 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them 
in association with the use of these IPs.
AESIs for durvalumab include but are not limited to events with a potential inflammatory or 
immune-mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent monitoring and/or interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormone replacement therapy. These 
AESIs are being closely monitored in clinical  studies with durvalumab monotherapy and 
combination therapy. An immune-mediated adverse ev ent (imAE) is defined as an adverse event 
that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism of 
action and where there is no clear alternate etiology. Serologic, immunologic, and histologic 
(biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to support an imAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectio us, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of 
the imAE.
If the investigator has any questions in regards to an adverse event (AE) being an imAE, the 
investigator should promptly contact [CONTACT_1689].
Further information on these AESIs (eg presenting symptoms) can be found in the current 
version of the Durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure (section 5.4.2 Summary of Risks).
11.7.1. Progression to AML
Progression to AML will be monitored as an event o f special interest and must be reported as an 
SAE regardless of causal relationship to IP, occurring at any time for the duration of the study, from the time of signing the ICD until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent for further 
data collection, or study closure.

Confidential and Propri etary 150 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: [ADDRESS_26826], evaluation, and 
documentation of this study are designed to ens ure that Celgene, its authorized representative, 
and investigator abide by [CONTACT_27727], as described in International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will receive approval from an IRB/EC prior to commencement. The 
investigator will conduct all aspects of this study  in accordance with applicable national, state, 
and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities.
14.2. Investigator Responsibilities
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the local regulations.  Celgene staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all 
investigators who in turn will select their staff.
The investigator should ensure that all persons assi sting with the study are adequately informed 
about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties and functions. The investigator should maintain a list of sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified 
persons to whom he or she has delegated significant study-related duties.
The investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a record of all subjects who sign an informed consent 
document and are screened for entry into the study.  Subjects who fail screening must have the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents.
The investigator, or a designated member of th e investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study-related charts) for source data 
verification.  The investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and queries.
14.3. Subject Information and Informed Consent
The investigator must obtain informed consent of a subject and/or a subject’s legal representative 
prior to any study related procedures.
Documentation that informed consent occurred prio r to the study subject’s entry into the study 
and of the informed consent process should be recorded in the study subject’s source documents 
including the date.  The original ICD signed and dated by [CONTACT_27728]’s entry into  the study, must be maintained 
in the investigator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject.  In addition, if a protocol is 
amended and it impacts on the content of the inform ed consent, the ICD must be revised.  Study 
subjects participating in the study when the amended protocol is implemented must be re-
consented with the revised version of the ICD.  The revised informed consent document signed 
and dated by [CONTACT_27729]’s study files and a copy given to the study subject.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 151 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: [ADDRESS_26827]'s right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in 
compliance with ICH and other local regulations (whichever is most stringent). Celgene requires 
the investigator to permit Celgene's representatives and, when necessary, representatives from 
regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in 
accordance with local laws.
Should direct access to medical records require  a waiver or authorization separate from the 
subject’s signed informed consent document, it is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain such permission in writing from the appropriate individual.
14.5. Protocol Amendments
Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_27730]/medical monit or.  Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval.  
Written approval must be obtained before implement ation of the amended version occurs.  The 
written signed approval from the IRB/EC should  specifically reference the investigator name, 
protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are administrative in nature do not require IRB/EC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/EC for 
information purposes.
14.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval
Before the start of the study, the study protocol , informed consent document, and any other 
appropriate documents will be submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing the 
documents submitted, their dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is sought. If applicable,  the documents will also be submitted to 
the authorities in accordance with local legal requirements.
IP can only be supplied to an investigator by [CONTACT_27731]. This documentation must also include a list of the 
members of the IRB/EC and their occupation and qualifications. If the IRB/EC will not disclose the names, occupations and qualifications of the committee members, it should be asked to issue 
a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. For 
example, the IRB General Assurance Number may be accepted as a substitute for this list. Formal approval by [CONTACT_1201]/EC should mention the protocol title, number, amendment number 
(if applicable), study site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable), and any other 
documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must beofficially signed by a commi ttee membe r. Before the first subject is enrolled in the study, all 
ethical and legal requirements must be met.
The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to 
determine whether formal approval must be sought and whether the informed consent document 
should also be revised.

operating procedures.
16.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study.  All aspects of the study are reviewed with the investigator and the staff at a study 
initiation visit and/or at an investigator meeting.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a 
Celgene representative will review the protoc ol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and reporting of AEs/ SAEs with the investig ator.  Monitoring will 
include on-site visits with the investigator and his/her staff as well as any appropriate 
communications by [CONTACT_2319], email, fax, or telephone.  During monitoring visits, the facilities, investigational product storage area, CRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study 
documentation w ill be inspected/reviewed by [CONTACT_27738].
Accuracy will be checked by [CONTACT_12939] a direct comparison of 
the entries made onto the CRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the i nvestigator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary 
corrections will be made directly to the CRFs or via queries by [CONTACT_1755]/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consent documents, adherence to 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and documentation of  SAEs and their proper recording be verified.  
Additional monitoring activities may be outlin ed in a study-specific monitoring plan.
16.2. Audits and Inspections
In addition to the routine monitoring procedure s, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
unit exists within Celgene.  Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research 
activities in accordance with Celgene SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Pract ice 
guidelines and regulations.
The investigator is required to permit direct acce ss to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, CRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for 
audits and inspections by [CONTACT_1744]/ECs, regulatory  authorities (eg, [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug 
Association [FDA], European Medicines Agency [EMA], Health Canada) and company 
authorized representatives.  The investigator should make every effort to be available for the 
audits and/or inspections.  If the investigator is contact[CONTACT_27739], he/she should contact [CONTACT_27740].
16.3. Product Quality Complaint
A Product Quality Compliant (PQC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, qualit y, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, 
purity, or performance of any drug product manufactured by [CONTACT_27741]. PQCs may reduce the usability of the product for its intended 
function or affect performance of the product and therefore pose a significant risk to the patient.

∀PFS: disease progression or death from any cause
∀DFS: time to relapse
∀Cause-specific death: death related to MDS

aDysplastic changes should consider the normal range of dysplastic changes (modification).
bModification to IWG (2000) response criteria.  
cIn some circumstances, protocol therapy may require the initiation of further treatment (eg, consolidation, maintenance) before  
the 4-week period.  Such subjects can be included in the res ponse category into which they fit at the time the therapy is start ed.  
Transient cytopenias during repeated chemotherapy courses should not be considered as interrupting durability of response, as
long as they recover to the improved counts of the previous course.
d20 – 30% blasts is considered AML according to the WHO classification ( Vardiman, 2009 ).

Confidential and Propri etary 181 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019Appendix J: Extension Phase
Upon Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_26844] Eligibility
At the Investigator’s discretion and following c onfirmation of eligibility criteria below, subjects 
can enter the Extension Phase:
!Subjects who have signed the informed consent for the EP of the study;
!Subjects receiving oral azacitidine and continuing in the Treatment Phase 
demonstrating clinical benefit as assessed by [CONTACT_27754];
!Subjects who do not meet any of the criteria for study discontinuation (see 
Section 12).
Treatment Assignment 
Upon approval of Amendment 4, subjects will start the EP at the start of their next regularly 
scheduled dosing cycle for oral azacitidine and align the Cycle XDay 1 visit with the Treatment 
Discontinuation Visit ( X= most recent cycle during the treatment phase), so they occur on the 
same day.  The dose and schedule will follow the study treatment administration and schedule
(Section 8.2). Subjects will remain at the same dose levels from the main study during the 
Extension Phase and may decrease dose levels following dose modifications (Section 8.2.4 );
however, dose levels will not increase. Any potential dose escalation will be considered a 
treatment failure and the s ubject will be discontinued.
Cycles should be repeated every 28 days.  Subjects should be monitored locally for hematology 
and chemistry testing, pregnancy testing for FCBP and dose- limiting toxicities be fore the dosing 
of the next cycle. Dosage delay or reduction as described below may be necessary.
Management of Toxicities and Dose Modifications
Subjects should be monitored for toxicity usi ng the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.03), as a guide for the grading of 
severity.  If a certain level of toxicity is obse rved and considered by [CONTACT_27755], IP dosing may be interrupted, delayed or modified.  In all cases, the 
reason for dose modification must be recorded in the subject’s medical record and corresponding 
eCRF page.  If the subject discontinues the protocol-prescribed therapy because of an AE, this event must be reported in accordance with the procedures outlined in Section 12.
Oral azacitidine dose modifications due to nonhematological and hematological toxicities during 
oral azacitidine treatment should be managed as described in Section 8.2.[ADDRESS_26845] w ill be 
discontinued.
Adverse Events
Adverse events (non-serious and serious) will continue to be collected in the CRF.

Confidential and Propri etary 182 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019For subjects entering the EP, ongoing AEs at the time of the Treatment Discontinuation Visit (in 
the main study) should be left as ongoing and should not be recorded again in the EP AE CRF.  
Adverse events with an onset date equal to or after the EP informed consent date should be 
recorded in the EP AE CRF.  If a previously reported AE worsens during the EP, then the AE should be recorded as a new AE with a higher grade on the EP AE CRF. All subjects will be 
monitored for AEs for [ADDRESS_26846]’s participation in the study must be followed until recovered (return to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to the SAE).  Refer to 
Section 11Adverse Events for reporting requirements, responsibilities and procedures.
Concomitant Medications
All concomitant medications that are necessary for the subject’s welfare may be given at the 
Investigator’s discretion during the EP and recorded in the CRF.  However, treatment with any 
other investigational medication is not permitted.  Refer to Section 9for prohibited concomitant 
medications/therapy for subjects on oral azacitidine.
Survival Follow-up
No Survival Follow-up will be required for any subjects in the EP.
Monitoring of Subjects
The monitoring of subjects is to be conducted as per the local standard of care, and include at 
least:
!Complete blood count with WBC differential and platelet c ount as required, and at a 
minimum, prior to each dosing cycle
!For FCBP, pregnancy testing must be done and have a negative result prior to 
initiating a new cycle
!Bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_27608]
!Additional tests or more frequent monitoring are at the Investigator’s discretion based 
on the subject’s clinical status.
Investigator’s Responsibility 
!Obtain subject’s signature [CONTACT_27766]
!Monitoring of subjects (listed above) 
!Complete Extension Phase case report form pages
!Document all adverse events (serious and non-serious) on the adverse event log page 
of the Extension Phase CRF as required by [CONTACT_760] (Section 8.2.4 )
!Report serious adverse events and other immediately reportable events, as required by 
[CONTACT_760] (see Section 11).  A completed SAE form must be faxed to Celgene Drug

Statistical Methods  
Safety evaluation for the EP will include monitoring for adverse events and recording of 
concomitant medications. Although physical examinations, vital sign measurements and 
laboratory assessments will be performed in the EP, these assessments will not be captured in the CRF.  However, clinically significant findings from these assessments which meet the definition 
of an adverse event (see Section 11) will be reported as adverse events.  Adverse events will be 
summarized as per Section 10.7 on the subjects entering the EP.  Exposure to oral azacitidine as 
well as concomitant med ications taken during the EP will also be summarized.

Summary of Changes CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 3 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun [ZIP_CODE]. JUSTIFICATION FOR AMENDMENT
Based on Protocol Section 4.1.7 (Study Closure), the timing for the primary analysis and 
potential closure of the study will be met shortly. Also in line with this section, Celgene is 
adding an Extension Phase for all currently active subjects who are receiving treatment and opt 
to continue with CC-486. 
Study enrollment was closed on 29 Jun 2018. Enrollment in the Phase 1 safety run-in portion for 
CC-486 Monotherapy was completed with 13 subjects in the Phase 1 CC-486 Monotherapy
cohort on 07 Sep 2017. The Phase 1 Combination Therapy Cohort was stopped on 16 Jan 2018 due to challenges in finding the optimal combination dose. The Phase 2 Monotherapy SD and PD 
cohorts fully enrolled for Stage 1 in Dec ember 2017 and June 2018, respectively. However, the 
minimal number of responses required to proceed to  Stage 2 was not met and the Phase 2 cohorts 
were closed on 29 Jun 2018. Six subjects are ongoing in the Monotherapy SD/PD cohorts.
Per protocol, the primary analysis will be conducted once all subjects enrolled have completed 
[ADDRESS_26847].
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
!A description of the Extension Phase is presented in Appendix J and mentioned 
throughout the protocol. The overall duration of the study will be extended during the Extension Phase.  
∀Revised sections:  Protocol Summary, Sections 4.1.6 Extension Phase, and 6.15 
Extension Phase, Figure 1, Table 2 (Table of Events) and Appendix J: Extension 
Phase; and other editorial changes in the protocol for the extension phase.
The amendment also includes other minor clarifications and corrections:
!Protocol Summary and Section 4.1: Information was updated on enrollment closure, 
the Extension Phase, and the number of subjects who are ongoing.
!Section 4.1.7, 4.4, and 14.8: Language was added on the timing of study closure.
!Section 4.3: Total study duration was updated to include the Extension Phase.
!Section 8.1.1: The available CC- 486 supply was modified due to current subjects only 
taking 100 mg tablets. “After Amendment 4 approval, the CC-486 supply will be 
limited to 100-mg tablets for oral administration.”
!Section 8.2.4: Restrictions were added to dose increase modifications during the 
Extension Phase.
!Section 11.6: The following text was deleted: “Adve rse events such as death related 
to disease progression (in the absence of serious IP-related events) and serious events due to the relapse of the studied indication will not be subject to expedited reporting by [CONTACT_27756].  These events will be captured as AEs on the 
CRF, reported to Celgene Drug Safety meeting SAE reporting criteria (within 24 
hours) and reported to regulatory authorities in the annual report.” 
The amendment also includes several othe r minor clarifications and typographical corrections.

This protocol was amended as follows:
!Protocol text was updated to allow the dose  escalation of CC-486 after 2 well-tolerated 
cycles (instead of 4 cycles).  The safety assessment observed in the Phase [ADDRESS_26849] adverse events occurred early 
in these cycles. Thus, it is reasonable that in the absence of unacceptable toxicity, subjects who show signs of worsening dis ease (clinical or hematological), who remain in 
stable disease, or do not experience modified International Working Group (IWG) 2006 
hematologic improvement (HI) or better (partial response [PR], complete response [CR]or marrow CR – modified IWG 2006) can dos e escalate after [ADDRESS_26850] also added the text “who remain in stable disease” for clarity that stable disease 
patients may also dose escalate after 2-well tolerated cycles. 
Revised sections include Section 4.1.3 Randomized Treatment Phase, Section 6.5 CC-
486 (Oral Azacitidine), Secti on 8.2 Treatment Administration and Schedule, and Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] CC-486 (Or al Azacitidine) Dose Modification and Toxicity Management.
!The dosing modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines have been updated for 
consistency with recommendations in the most recent Durvalumab Investigator’s 
Brochure Edition 12.
Revised sections: Table 5: Durvalumab Treatment Modification and Toxicity 
Management Guidelines for Immune-Mediated Adverse Events, Table 6: Durvalumab Treatment Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Infusion-Related 
Reactions, and Table 7:  Durvalumab Tr eatment Modification and Toxicity Management 
Guidelines for Non-Immune-Mediated Reactions.
!To be consistent with the Durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure Edition 12, the term 
“immune-related adverse event (abbreviated as irAE) has been changed to “immune-
mediated adverse event” (abbreviated as imAE) throughout the protocol text.
Sections revised include Protocol Summary, Section [IP_ADDRESS] Durvalumab / CC-[ADDRESS_26851] of Abbreviations and Definitions of Terms.

Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_27610].   
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
!Primary objective wording was updated to remove the text “the most recent” treatment 
with a prior injectable hypomethylating agent (iHMA) for MDS to provide clarity that 
subjects in this trial need  to have failed all prior tr eatments with iHMA and not just “the 
most recent” treatment.  There is no impact expected regarding study population or 
outcome.  Also, please note that this clarif ication does not change  the overall primary 
objective and no text changes were needed per Section 2.1 Primary Objective.  
Revised sections: Protocol Summar y, Section 4.1.3 Randomized Treatment Phase,
Section 6.1.1 MDS Diagnosis, WHO and FAB C lassifications and IPSS (-R) Risk 
Classification, and Section 7.2 Inclusion Criteria (criterion number 4).
!Updates were made to detail that the fut ility analysis may be performed ear lier in Stage [ADDRESS_26854]’s response result in Stage 2 to perform the final overall analysis (rate of response) for that specific cohort.  Each of the 4 cohorts will 
be analyzed separately. 
The protocol language will read as follows:“The randomized treatment phase will be conducted in 2 stages, with a fut ility assessment 
planned at the completion of Stage 1 to determine whether the null hypothesis (H0: p 
<12.5%) can be rejected with [ADDRESS_26855] the same integrity as the fut ility assessment 
planned at the completion of Stage 1. An anal ysis will be performed at the completion of 
Stage 2 to estimate the overall response rate of treatment of all the subjects in the cohort”.
Revised sections:  Protocol Summary,  Section 4.1 Study De sign, and Section 10.1 
Overview.
Also, protocol language will read as follows:“A subject is considered evaluable for respons e once they have one  cycle of treatment 
with a maximum of 6 cycles of treatment”.
Revised section:  Section 4.1.3 Randomized Treatment Phase
!The enrollment period and total trial duration were extended due to the length of the CC-
486 safety run-in, which required the enrollment and monitoring of additional subjects 
due to gastrointestinal intolerab ility. E nrollment was extended from “a pproximately 24

Summary of Changes CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 3 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 1.0 Final: 08 Sep [ZIP_CODE]. JUSTIFICATION FOR AMENDMENT
Rationale for the amendment:
While injectable hypomethylating agents (azacitidine for injection and decitabine) remain the 
standard of care in the treatment of International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as many as half of affected patients do not respond to 
treatment, and nearly all those who do respond will eventually relapse.  Upon failure of treatment 
with azacitidine for injection and/or decitabine, the prognosis for patients with higher-risk disease is dismal, with median overall survival on the order of 4-6 months. Similarly, injectable 
hypo-methylating agents (iHMAs) are approved for treatment of I PSS lower-risk MDS in some 
countries, and while there are few data to characterize outcomes in lower-risk disease following failure of these agents, prognosis is poor and for patients who are not eligible for allogeneic stem 
cell transplant (ASCT), no proven treatment options currently exist.
The goal in treating this population and in evaluating new potentially therapeutic options is to 
capture or recapture hematologic response or hematologic improvement to reduce the rate of 
disease progression and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) t ransformation, and to prolong survival.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_27613]-HMA setting among researchers, there remains a critical unmet medical need.  
Cancer and Immune Function
The importance of the immune system in cancer development and progression has been 
recognized during the past decade.  Failure of immune surveillance of pre-neoplastic lesions and 
micro-metastases is a key step in cancer development. Chronically immunosuppressed 
individuals show higher rates of cancer. This observation led to the hypothesis that sporadic cancers among immune-competent individuals are likely to be minimally immunogenic, 
allowing for passive escape from immune surveillance. Recent data suggest that this may be an 
oversimplification. Some sporadic tumors are highly immunogenic, but actively suppress the local immune environment through production of immunosuppressive cytokines.  The local 
tumor environment is likely a highly dynamic environment where most tumors grow and 
metastasize through adaptive responses that modulate antitumor immunity. The complexity and redundancy of the immune system offers multiple targets that may be manipulated to maximize 
the body’s inherent immune response to a tu mor. Immune response may be augmented by 
[CONTACT_27635], indirectly stimulating effectors by [CONTACT_27636], or by [CONTACT_27637], cells, or 
messages.
Immune-checkpoint InhibitionTumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have the capacity to control the growth of many types of 
cancers.   Most tumors show infiltration by [CONTACT_27638], but tumors modulate the local 
microenvironment through expression of inhibit ory molecules. Engagement of  TIL cell-surface 
receptors with these inhibitory ligands lead s to a dysfunctional immune  response, causes T-cell 
exhaustion, and facilitates tumor progression.   It is increasingly appreciated that cancers are 
recognized by [CONTACT_27639], and unde r some circumstances, the immune system may

Summary of Changes CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 4 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 1.0 Final: 08 Sep 2015control or even eliminate tumors.  Novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block these 
inhibitory receptors have shown significant clinical activity across a number of tumor types 
Specifically, blockade of immune-checkpoint inhibitors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-
associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), PD-1, a nd PD-L1 have shown clinical activity not only in 
conventionally immune-res ponsive tumors such as melanoma and re nal cell carcinoma but also 
in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and prostate cancer.  
The PD-[ADDRESS_26865] tumors.  This may
be accomplished by [CONTACT_27640]-inhibitory molecules such as CTLA-4 or PD-1 from binding with their ligands, B7 or B7-H1 (PD-L1).
PD-L1 expression is present in MDS and AML, with increased expression observed in advanced 
disease. In addition, there has been evidence to  suggest that PD-L1 is upregulated in myeloblasts 
in MDS subtypes.  
In addition, in MDS subtypes, PD-L1 expressi on on myeloblasts has been associated with MDS 
transformation to AML.  Myeloid leukemia cell lines that were treated with the hypomethylating agent decitabine were shown to have an u pregulation of PD-L1 expression.  Upregulation ( ≥ 2 
fold) of PD-L1 has been observed in 25% of AML CD34+ samples, 33% of PD-L2, and 22% of 
PD-1.  PD-1 signaling may be involved in MDS pathogenesis and resistance mechanisms to azacitidine; therefore, combined blockade of this pathway can be a potential therapy in MDS and 
AML.
Based on this information, a rationale exists for evaluating durvalumab in combination with 
azacitidine in  subjects with MDS and AML. 
Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG)[ADDRESS_26866] human PD-L1.
Durvalumab is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and has an overall molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa. Durvalumab selectively binds  human PD-L1 with high affinity and 
blocks its ability to bind to PD-1 and clu ster of differentiation 80. The fragment crystallizable 
(Fc) domain of durvalumab contains a triple mutation in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that reduces binding to the complement component C1q and the Fc gamma receptors 
responsible for mediating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 is a Phase 1, firs t-time-in-human, multicenter, open-label, dose-
escalation, and dose-expansion study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or 
optimal biologic dose, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of 
durvalumab in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy or for 
which no standard therapy exists. As of 21 Aug 2014, 408 subjects across 8 tumor types

Confidential and Propri etary 5 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 1.0 Final: 08 Sep 2015hepatocellular carcinoma [hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus positive]) have received 
durvalumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) for a median of 6 doses.
Partial efficacy data are available as of 21 Aug 2014.  In this study, 352 of 408 subjects treated 
with durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W were evaluable for response analysis, which included subjects 
who had at least [ADDRESS_26868] 1 follow-up scan (included discontinuations due to progressive disease [PD] or death 
prior to first follow-up scan). Early (5 weeks) and durable (56+ weeks) activity were observed 
across multiple tumor types. Disease cont rol rate at 12 weeks (DCR-12w) was 33% (115/352 
subjects) and objective response rate (ORR) was 10% (36/352 subjects) across the 8 tumor types. 
Greater DCR-12w (47% vs 28%) and ORR (22% vs 5%) were observed in subjects with PD-L1-
positive versus PD-L1-negative tumor. Responses are ongoing in 92% of subjects (33/36) with 
an objective response (OR).
Durvalumab is being evaluated in MDS after iHMA treatment.  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_27613]-HMA setting among researchers, there remains a critical unmet 
medical need.  The current study is being ame nded to additionally ev aluate a new potenti ally 
therapeutic option, durvalumab in combination with CC-486, in an effort to capture or recapture hematologic response or hematologic improvement, to reduce the rate of disease progression and 
AML transformation, and to prolong survival.  
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
An additional investigational product (IP), anti-PD-L1 monoclona l antibody, durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) in combination with CC-486 (combination therapy), will be evaluated  in this study 
in addition to the evaluation of CC-486 as monothe rapy.  The changes in the protocol are being  
made to accommodate this additional arm of combination therapy.
The Introduction (Section 1) now includes a description of durvalumab (Section 1.3) including 
experience in MDS.  Study Rationale (Section 1.4) was changed to include information on cancer and immune function, immune checkpoint inhibition  and 
durvalumab fixed dosing regimens.
The primary objective of the study (Title Page , Protocol Summary and Section 2.1) remains the 
same except for the addition of combination therapy.  The original secondary objectives  also 
remain the same except for the addition of co mbination therapy.  An additional secondary 
objective was added  to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the durvalumab and CC-486 combination.

The study design (Protocol Summary, Section 4) and study design rationale (Section 4.2)  has 
been changed to accommodate the addition of the combination therapy.  The study design now 
includes a safety run-in:  a 3+3 design for CC- 486 monotherapy followed  by a 3+3  design with 
combination therapy to evaluate safety and tolerability.  Dose limiting toxicity was defined for 
monotherapy and for combination therapy.  The previous randomized treatment phase was 
changed to add the additional arm of combination therapy.   Section 4.1.3 was updated to state 
that once the CC-486 dose and schedule in the safety-run in of a treatment arm is identified, 
enrollment for Stage 1 of the treatment phase may begin . A pharmacokinetic sub-study (Section 
4.1.4 and 6.10) was added that will collect samples from 10-12 evaluable subjects randomized to 
the combination treatment arm.  Subjects participating in the pharmacokinetic sub-study will 
receive CC-486 on Day -1 of Cycle 1 (Section 6.3, Section 6.10, Section 8.2).
The previous study design (Figure 1) and the amended study design including the run-in phase 
(Figure 2 and 3) are attached.  The follow-up phase is extended from 28 days to 90 days for the 
combination therapy.
Study populations (Protocol Su mmary, Section 7.1) has been amended to include additional 
subjects for treatment in the safety run-in and in the combination arm.  At least [ADDRESS_26870] 3+3 design for the monotherapy and then for the combination therapy.  The Stage 1 randomized treatment will include 64 subjects: 
approximately 32 with stable disease and 32 with progressive disease.  If there are 3 or more 
responses in any arm, that arm with enroll 25 additional subjects in Stage 2.  The total number of subjects  in the randomized treatment phase will range from 64 to 164 subjects.  
The enrollment period (Protocol Summary, Section 4.3) fo r this study has been increased and is 
expected to last approximately [ADDRESS_26871] is enrolled.  Therefore, the 
total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 36 months.  
Inclusion criteria was amended to include the signing of an additional  
 and the exclusion criteria (Secti on 7.3) was amended to  add exclusions 
appropriate to ensure safety and exclusions of conditions that would confound the ability to 
interpret the data of subjects receiving durvalumab including subjects who received previous treatments similar to durvalumab.  
Study treatment (Title Page, Protocol Su mmary, Section 6.5 now Section 6.6, Section 8, Section 
7.3, and Section 9.2) was amended to add th e following information for durvalumab:  
description, dosing and administration, IP dispensation and guidelines for toxicity management 
and overdose.  Prohibited medications was expanded to add immunosuppressive agents and live 
attenuated vaccines.
Statistical analysis  (Protocol Summary, Secti on 10) now refers to the 2-arm study with the 
addition of the combination treatment.   Sample size and power considerations, primary efficacy 
analysis,  
were changed to reflect the addition of the combination therapy arm.

Summary of Changes CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 7 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 1.0 Final: 08 Sep 2015Safety assessments and  adverse events (Protocol Summary, Table of Events, Section 6.6 now 
Section 6.7 and Section 11), and adverse events of special interest were  added primarily to 
reflect those additional events that are specific to durvalumab, e.g., hepatic function abnormality, 
pneumonitis, infusion reactions and hypersensi tivity.  Appropri ate safety assessments were 
added including infusion monitoring and 12-lead ECG at study discontinuation. 
Other significant changes and rationale for those changes:
Concomitant medications (Section 6.1.4, Secti on 6.6.7 now 6.7.9, Section 9, Table 1 footnote) 
All prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal medications and therapeutic procedures received 
within 12   4 weeks (28 84 days) prior to the first dose of IP, until [ADDRESS_26872] dose of 
the IP (or until the treatment discontinuation visit, whichever period is longer) must be recorded on the appropriate CRF page.
Rationale:   Medications discontinued more than [ADDRESS_26873] the study.  Treatments for MDS are gathered outside of that time frame.
Coagulation parameters will be collected at baseline (Table 1 now Table 2: Table of Events and 
Section 6.1.5).
Rationale:  Collection of coagulation parameters has been added as an additional safety 
measure.
Amylase and lipase will now be added to serum chemistries as well as thyroid function tests 
(Protocol Summary, Section 4.1.3, Table of Events, Section 6.1.13, Section 6.7, Section 6.14) 
Rationale:  Collection of amylase, lipase and thyroid function tests have been added as
additional safety measures. 
A urine sample should be collected prior to IP administration on Day 1 of every 3
rdtreatment 
cycle (i.e. Cycles 3, 6, 9, etc), treatment disconti nuation and safety follow-up, and sent to central 
lab for analysis (Protocol Summary, S ection 4.1.3, Table of Events, Section 6.1.10, Section 6.7, 
Section 6.13 and Section 6.14). 
Rationale:  Urine monitoring time points have been added as an additional safety measure.
IVRS (Interactive Voice Response System) was changed to IRTS (Interactive Response 
Technology System).
Rationale: This change was provided by [CONTACT_27759], our IRTS vendor.

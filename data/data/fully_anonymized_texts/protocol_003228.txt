Protocol Version  #6 Date:  01/15 /[ADDRESS_216885] been documented among cervical cancer survivors. Recent 
national data indicate that between 44% and 48% of cervical cancer survivors are current smokers.1-[ADDRESS_216886] declined substantially among cancer survivors and 
among the general population of smokers, the prevalence of smoking among gynecologic cancer survivors – particularly cervical cancer survivors – has remained extraordinarily high.

recommended that cervical cancer survivors be provided with a survivorship care plan that addresses the dangers of continued tobacco use and the risk of subsequent malignancy that persists throughout the survivor’s lifetime.
[ADDRESS_216888] -effectiveness of a theoretically - and empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675] -based 
“Motivation And Problem -Solving” (MAPS) approach to promoting and facilitating smoking cessation among 
cervical cancer and high grade cervical dysplasia survivors. Participants (N=300) will be recruited through the 
Stephenson Cancer Center or OU Physicians at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, via the 
ClinicalTrials.gov website, by [CONTACT_183718] (e.g., flyers in 
clinics, Facebook), and through referrals from healthcare providers. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 1) Standard Treatment [ST] or 2) “ Motivation And Problem -Solving” (MAPS) ST 
will consist of a mailed packet of materials including a letter referring smokers to the Oklahoma Tobacco Helpline, [LOCATION_012] Quitline or to the national quitline number (1- 800-QUIT -NOW) for participants residing in other 
states, free nicotine replacement therapy when ready to quit, and standard self -help materials. ST will be 
mailed a total of 3 times to participants with completed  assessments (Baseline, 6 and 12 months) . MAPS will 
consist of ST plus up to [ADDRESS_216889]- effectiveness.  
MAPS is a holistic, dynamic approach to facilitating behavior change that utilizes a combined motivational 
enhancement and social cognitive approach based on motivational interviewing (MI)
18,19 and social cognitive 
theory.20-22 MAPS is designed for all individuals regardless of their readiness to change, and specifically targets 
motivation and intrinsic motives for change, social cognitive constructs (e.g., agency/self -efficacy), and other 
factors of key relevance to cervical cancer survivors (e.g., stressors, anxiety, depression, family conflicts, 
finances, fear of cancer recurrence). Because MAPS revolves around a Wellness Program that addresses 
numerous barriers and concerns that are prevalent among cervical cancer survivors, we believe it is particularly appropriate for treating this population. Furthermore, the delivery of this intervention via telephone 
offers a less resource intensive modality while also minimizing participant  burden.  
 
The specific aims are to:  
1. Compare the efficacy of a MAPS approach to promoting and facilitating smoking cessation to ST among cervical cancer  survivors.  
2. Assess the effects of MAPS on hypothesized treatment mechanisms (motivation, agency, and stress/negative affect) and the role of those mechanisms in mediating MAPS effects on  abstinence.  
3. Compare the cost- effectiveness of MAPS and ST.  
Page [ADDRESS_216890] dramatically declined.28 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_183693], in the 
[LOCATION_002], approximately 250,000 women are survivors of cervical cancer, over 12,000 new cases of invasive cervical cancer are diagnosed each year, and approximately 4,200 women die from the disease each 
year.
28,29 Cervical cancer predominantly affects younger women with a median age at diagnosis  of 49 years.29 
Furthermore, there are profound racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the incidence and mortality of the disease.
30 Compared to white women, the incidence of cervical cancer is 39% higher among African 
American women31 and 80% higher among Latina women.32 In addition, African American and Latina women 
are significantly more likely to die from cervical cancer.31,32 Smoking prevalence is lower among African 
American (15.5%) and Latina (8.6%) women compared to non -Latina White women (18.8%).33 However, 
women that are members of these racial/ethnic minority groups as well as women with low socioeconomic status are known to suffer disproportionately from the health consequences of smoking,

are members of racial/ethnic minority groups suffer tremendous disparities with regard to cervical cancer 
related morbidity and mortality and the health consequences of smoking. Therefore, women who are current smokers and have a history of cervical cancer represent a particularly vulnerable subgroup at substantially 
elevated risk.  
Recent national data indicate that a strikingly high proportion of cervical cancer survivors – between 44% 
and 48% – are current smokers.
1-[ADDRESS_216892] had small sample sizes (<30), measured only short -term 
smok ing status, and most importantly, found no significant treatment effects.42-[ADDRESS_216893] also been well documented.
53-57 Moreover, cervical cancer survivors with lower socioeconomic status  and limited social 
support are at even greater risk for poor outcomes.53,58,59 Because MAPS is built around a Wellness Program, 
addresses life events, stressors, and other concerns of each individual (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress, fear of cancer recu rrence, family conflicts, financial concerns, relationship and sexual issues) it is especially well - 
suited to address concerns of particular relevance to cervical cancer survivors. Furthermore, the delivery of the MAPS intervention and the collection of theoretical mechanisms data via telephone will offer a more cost 
effective and less burdensome approach.  
 
MAPS Overview and Rationale. MAPS is a holistic, dynamic framework for behavior change that 
integrates treatment elements from both motivational interviewing (MI)18,19,60 and social cognitive theory.20,21,61 
MAPS is structured around a Wellness Program that addresses a wide array of concerns and barriers to 
change, similar to patient navigation programs.62 The overarching theoretical rationale for MAPS is the social 
cognitive model of behavior change.21,63,64 Social cognitive theory posits that “High levels of both motivation 
and self -efficacy are important ingredients … an individual may fail to engage in a specific behavior despi[INVESTIGATOR_183695] -efficacy if the motivation for performance is low or absent.”65 Similarly, Miller et al.66 note that 
“the key element for lasting change is a motivational shift that instigates a decision and commitment to change. In the absence of such a  shift, skill training is premature." That is, theory posits that effective smoking 
cessation treatments require both enhancing the motivation to achieve and maintain change, as well as developi[INVESTIGATOR_183696] -efficacy and skills necessary to do so. Nevertheless, current interventions often focus 
largely on either motivation or problem -solving/skills training despi[INVESTIGATOR_183697]. When motivation is addressed, the focus is typi[INVESTIGATOR_183698] a 
quit attempt, with little to no focus on the motivation to maintain change.
20,[ADDRESS_216894] to previous approaches, MAPS utilizes an innovative combination of motivational enhancement 
and social cognitive treatment techniques, is designed for all individuals regardless of their readiness to 
change, and specifically targets motivation, agency/self -efficacy, and stress/negative affect. Although stage - 
based conceptualizations of behavior change also emphasize both motivation and skills training, motivational shifts are conceptualized as relatively stable changes in “stage.”
[ADDRESS_216895] that can fluctuate on a moment -to-moment basis depending on 
context. Counselors carefully assess and attend to changes in motivation so that treatment strategies are appropriately matched to motivation in the moment. MAPS is built around a Wellness Program that in addition 
to focusing on smoking cessation and relapse prevention, also addresses life events, stressors, and other 
concerns of each individual (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress, fear of cancer recurrence, family conflicts, 
financial concerns, relationship and sexual issues, etc.). By [CONTACT_183719], not only are many of the barriers to success addressed, but we believe that adherence is 
increased because individuals perceive that the counselors care about them as whole people, and are not solely interested in their smoking behavior. Most importantly, our previous research has supported the efficacy 
of MAPS for motivating quit attempts, increasing cessation, and preventing relapse.
69-71 
 
Major Hypothesized Mechanisms . Both research and theory identify motivation, agency, and 
stress/negat ive affect as critical mechanisms underlying behavior change.72-75 As such, MAPS specifically 
targets these mechanisms and they are hypothesized to underlie MAPS effects on behavior change.  
Page 5   
 
Motivation . Motivation prospectively predicts both the decision to make a quit attempt and the likelihood of 
cessation.68,76 Further, motivation can change rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375],77-80 consistent with a recent model positing that 
motivation is dynamic and characterized by [CONTACT_183720].80 Motivation for the maintenance of change 
has received much less attention, although the extant empi[INVESTIGATOR_183699] - 24% of all relapse epi[INVESTIGATOR_183700] a 
distinct lack of motivation to maintain abstinence81 and a decline in motivation over time prospectively predicts 
relapse.[ADDRESS_216896] 
abstinence whereas extrinsic motives do not, and only  intrinsic motives are associated with long- term 
abstinence.84,85 In sum, the data indicate that: motivation influences the initiation of a quit attempt, cessation, 
and the maintenance of abstinence; type of motives influence long- term success; and, motivation can fluctuate 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. Therefore, MAPS utilizes an approach with a specific emphasis on motivation and on appropriate therapeutic responses to common rapid fluctuations in motivation that occur throughout the change process.  
Agency . Agency reflects the ability to intentionally affect one’s behavior or life situation.86 Self-efficacy is a 
form of agency that is context and behavior dependent (i.e., varies based on the behavior and situational 
demands). Self -efficacy has predicted cessation outcomes in numerous studies.87-[ADDRESS_216897] problem -solving and copi[INVESTIGATOR_25125], and increased motivation.
21,90 -92 
Stress/Negative Affect . Stres s and negative affect, measured in many different ways, predict cessation 
outcomes. Affective predictors include affective responses to smoking- related acute events, individual 
differences in affective vulnerability, depressive symptoms, and the magnitude and trajectory of stress/negative affect over time. 
19,81,87,93- 97 In addition to the stress/negative affect engendered by [CONTACT_183721], life stressors such 
as those experienced by [CONTACT_183722], have been shown to have adverse effects over time on motivation, self -efficacy, and abstinence. 
98,99 Further, social cognitive theory posits that weak motivation for 
abstinence can increase stress/negative affect, particularly during high-risk situations.21 Thus, MAPS is 
hypothesized to reduce stress/negative affect via its impact on decreasing ambivalence and increasing motivation, through the application of copi[INVESTIGATOR_183701] -solving, and through utilization of a 
holistic approach in which other life concerns and stressors are addressed.  
 
APPROACH 
 
Project Design and Procedures. Participants will be women with a diagnosis of cervical cancer or high 
grade cervical dysplasia who report smoking any cigarettes within the past 30 days, recruited through the Stephenson Cancer Center or OU Physicians at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, via the ClinicalTrials.gov website, by [CONTACT_183718] (e.g., flyers in 
clinics, Facebook), and through referrals from healthcare providers. Participants will be followed for a period of 
18 months, and randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) Standard Treatment [ST], or 2) Motivation and 
Problem Solving [MAPS]. ST will consist of a mailed packet of materials including a letter referring smokers to 
the Oklahoma Tobacco Helpline, [LOCATION_012] Quitline or to the national quitline number (1- 800-QUIT -NOW) for 
participants residing in other states, free nicotine replacement therapy when they are ready to quit, and standard self -help materials. ST will be mailed a total of 3 times to participants with completed assessments 
(at Baseline, 6 and 12 months). MAPS will consist of ST plus up to [ADDRESS_216898] counseling call at that time (see Table 1).  
 
Recruitment . Participants will be women with a diagnosis of cervical cancer or high grade cervical 
dysplasia who report smoking any cigarettes within the past 30 days, recruited through the Stephenson Cancer Center or OU Physicians at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, via the ClinicalTrials.gov website, by [CONTACT_183718] (e.g., flyers in clinics, Facebook), and 
through referrals from healthcare  providers.  
 
Participant Eligibility . Inclusion criteria: > 18; current smoker with a history of at least [ADDRESS_216899] 30 days; history of cervical cancer or high grade cervic al 
dysplasia (we have defined survivorship as beginning at the time of cancer diagnosis, consistent with the NCI definition); has a working cell phone; valid home address; speaks English, Spanish or both languages.  
Exclusion criteria: current use of tobacco cessation medications; self -report of being pregnant or lactating; or, 
another household member enrolled in the study; or contraindication of nicotine patch use unless under the 
supervision of a physician as advised by [CONTACT_60551].

Screening and Informed Consent Procedures. After being screened in- clinic or completing a secure 
online screener via REDCap, potential participants will be contact[CONTACT_183723]. All eligible individuals will be invited to participate. A detailed description of the study will be provided and informed consent will be obtained. For those who agree to enroll in the study, 
research staff will obtain informed consent either in- person or over the phone. When participants are 
consented over the phone, research staff will read the informed consent document to participants and will document in our database that verbal informed consent has been obtained. A copy of the informed consent 
document and project materials will be provided to participants either in -person or by [CONTACT_2319]. All informed consent 
materials will be available in both English and Spanish. Women who decline or are ineligible will be given self - 
help materials and a referral to other cessation programs if they so desire.  
 
Baseline Assessment and Randomization. Eligible women who choose to participate will complete 
telephone- administered questionnaires where data are entered directly into a database. The system includes 
online error checking and is used in all of our ongoing research projects. After completing the assessment, participants will be randomly assigned to ST or MAPS using a form of adaptive randomization called 
minimization.
100,[ADDRESS_216901] ics that may be related to time of accrual. In this 
study, we will randomize based on race/ethnicity, age, education, cigarettes/day, cervical cancer or dysplasia 
stage, cervical cancer or dysplasia treatment status, and time since diagnosis. After complet ing the 
assessment and randomization procedures, the [ADDRESS_216902] counseling call. 
 
Financial Compensation and Retention Procedures. Participants will receive financial remu neration after 
completing each assessment call to compensate for the time and inconvenience associated with participation 
($60 for each of the 5 assessment calls and up to a total of $300). The inclusion of compensation makes study participation more feasible and acceptable, which increases the representativeness of the sample and 
generalizability of the results. Compensation also increases follow -up rates, which reduces biases, and we 
have consistently achieved follow -up rates of approximately 80% even among very low -SES and 
racially/ethnically diverse smokers.
69,102 Other procedures to reduce attrition include: 1) mailing postcard 
reminders and calling to remind participants of upcoming assessment calls; 2) maintaining communication with 
participants throughout the study period via mailing birthday cards, holiday cards, etc. (each mailing includes a 
stamped address update postcard with the study return address); 3) Having a staff member available at all 
times during business hours as well as evenings and weekends to conduct assessment calls; 4) requiring that 
in addition to a functional phone number (necessary for counseling calls), participants must have a home 
address so that they can be contact[CONTACT_183724]; and 5) obtaining names, addresses, and phone numbers of up to three collaterals (i.e., relatives/friends) who can provide information on participants’ 
whereabouts during the study (permission to contact [CONTACT_183725]).  
In addition to being compensated for the time associated with completing assessments, all participants will be compensated up to a total of $150 for completing the assessments, up to a total  of $150 for costs incurred as a 
result for the use of study -related cell phone minutes, and up to a to tal of $120 for returning the cotinine tests. 
Compensation for completing assessments will be provided at baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months from baseline (5 times points x $30 = $150). Compensation for study -related cell phone use will be provided at baseline, 3, 6, 
12, and 18 months from baseline (5 time points x $30 = $150). Compensation for returning the cotinine tests will be provided at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months (4 time points x $30 = $120). 
 
TREATMENT PLAN  
 
Nicotine Replacement. All participants are eligible to receive a 12 -week supply of nicotine patches and 
Page 8  lozenges. Participants will receive educational materials describing potential side effects; proper use of the 
patch and an illustration demonstrating the proper placement of the patch  on the body. The nicotine patch and 
lozenge regimen will be based on the participant’s self -reported smoking rate and will not be validated once 
assigned. At the time of enrollment, a research staff member will determine the proper dose. Participants who smoke >10 cigarettes/day will receive 8 weeks of 21 mg. patches, 2 weeks of 14 mg. patches, 2 weeks of 7 
mg. patches, and 12 weeks of 2 mg. lozenges. Those who smoke <10 cigarettes/day will receive [ADDRESS_216903] Treatment (ST).  ST will consist of 1) a mailed packet of materials including a letter referring 
smokers to the quitline, 2) free nicotine replacement therapy when they are ready to quit, and 3) standard self - 
help materials. ST will be delivered a total of 3 times to participants with completed assessments (at Baseline, 6 and 12 months).  
MAPS.  MAPS will consist of ST plus up to [ADDRESS_216904] approximately 30 minutes. Calls are scheduled based on participants’ needs in negotiation with the counselor. For example, call timing can be negotiated to be clustered around the timing of 
a specific quit attempt. This is consistent with many interventions that load treatment during the period when 
relapse risk is highest.
103 Similarly, a woman not motivated to quit might negotiate the next call to occur many 
months later, or to occur sooner if specific barriers are noted that the individual wishes to address (e.g.,  stress, 
social support, family problems). Similarly, individuals struggling with maintaining abstinence may have several 
calls in a shorter period of time to get them through the problematic period, while others need less frequent 
help.  
 
Counselor Qualifications and Training. We have adopted the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_183704] -based approaches: 1) master’s degree in counseling, psychology or social work, and  
2) 2+ years of clinical experience.[ADDRESS_216905] the counselor training and supervision. Counselors will receive 
20 hours of MAPS training initially. Training will continue until the counselor reaches performance criteria for competence and adherence to the protocol. Counselors will also participate in 1 -2 hour “booster” training 
sessions every [ADDRESS_216906]. de Dios will supervise all Spanish language cases and bilingual  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].  
 
Treatment Fidelity and Monitoring of the Trial . To monitor deviation or drift from the protocol, all 
counseling calls will be digitally recorded and encrypted. A random sample of 10% of calls will be coded to 
ensure adequate competence and protocol adherence. A counselor who falls below performance criteria will 
receive additional training. The Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity Manual (MITI, 2nd edition)104 has 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_183705]. The MITI 
works well for ensuring that counselors are following the protocol and utilizing the general MI spi[INVESTIGATOR_17040]. In addition, 
the MITI is modified slightly to include coding of discussions around social cognitive/problem solving strategies 
and transitions between motivational enhancement and problem -solving. To monitor implementation, we will 
review weekly monitoring reports to track call completion and follow up rates. Dr. de Dios will be responsible for the fidelity monitoring of the Spanish language cases through the same process outlined above.  
 
ASSESSMENTS  
 
Assessments. Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) will be used to administer all questionnaires 
over the phone, in person, and/or via a web- based link when convenient for the participant. REDCap is a 
secure, web- based application designed to support data capture and utilizes a computer -administered self - 
interview format.  This system is used in all of our current research and is designed to comply with all HIPAA 
regulations. Having research staff read the questionnaire items to participants will help overcome problems 
related to low literacy levels. Finally, we will attemp t to reduce the inconvenience associated with completing 
assessments by [CONTACT_183726]’ time. In sum, the battery of instruments comprehensively assesses our hypothesized mechanisms and associated variables of interest. A  copy of each 
assessment instrument is included in the Appendix and all measures are listed in the Procedures Table (Table 
1). 
 
Smoking Abstinence. Abstinence assessments are based on recommendations from the Society for 
Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (S RNT).105 We will report both prolonged and point -prevalence abstinence 
Page 9  at all follow- up assessment points. Prolonged abstinence refers to abstinence beginning with the initiation of  
treatment and including a grace period. The prolonged abstinence measure utilizes SRNT’s recommendation 
for determining relapse (i.e., 7 consecutive days of smoking or smoking in each of 2 consecutive weeks). We 
will also evaluate two point -prevalence abstinence measures: 1) no smoking during the previous 7 days, and 2) 
no smoking during the previous [ADDRESS_216907] to follow -up are considered smoking. Abstinence at all follow- ups will 
be biochemically verified using a saliva cotinine level of <20 ng/ml.  
 
Participants who self -report abstinence will be mailed a prepaid envelope, instructions for providing the 
cotinine sample, and a saliva cotinine kit. Research staff will contact [CONTACT_183727] , review the contents of the packet , and answer any questions participants may have about collecting 
a saliva specimen. Although cotinine cannot comprehensively validate the various abstinence definitions and timeframes, the most comprehensive review  on biochemical validation concluded that misreporting is typi[INVESTIGATOR_183706] (~2%), and that adjustment for misreporting almost never influences analyses regarding relative 
treatment efficacy.
106 As such, our biochemical validation procedures are well justified both scientifically and 
practically. 
 
PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT PLAN  
 
If a participant: 1) states that she is thinking about harming herself or others, or 2) uses actions or words to 
lead us to believe that she may be in eminent danger or in danger of harming another person, research staff will execute our standard crisis procedures. These procedures are described in detail in Appendix H. Once the 
plan is executed, a trained counselor will assess the participant using the “Crisis Assessment” (Appendix I).  
Participants will also be encouraged to follow ups with a mental health professional of their choice. Our team 
will have extensive interactions with participants throughout the course of the study. Therefore, our plan is 
appropr iate for our target population.  
 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Data Analysis Approach. The primary outcome is abstinence from smoking at the 18- month assessment. 
To test the treatment effect at [ADDRESS_216908] logistic regression analysis with abs tinence as the 
outcome variable, and treatment (a two- level categorical variable) as the predictor, adjusting for covariates, 
specifically, factors used in the minimization procedures ( race/ethnicity, language, age, education, income, 
cigarettes/day, cervical cancer stage, and time since diagnosis). Interactions between treatment and specific covariates of interest may be included and tested for exploratory purposes.  
 
Because the primary and secondary outcomes and mechanisms include repeated measurements that are 
correlated within subjects, our data analytic approach will also utilize generalized linear mixed model 
regression (GLMM)
107,108 to analyze the effects of MAPS across the 3, 6, 12, and 18 month timepoints. For 
abstinence, we will assume a logit link  and binomial variance function for the GLMM, and parameterize them 
with blocking on individual nested within treatment conditions. Treatment and time will be included, as well as their interaction, with adjustment for relevant covariates. The effects of interactions between treatment and 
specific covariates will also be examined. Similarly analyses will also be conducted to assess the MAPS effects 
on quit attempt and use of the quitline (both binary). To assess MAPS effects on continuous measures such as cigarettes per day and mechanisms, the GLMM analysis will be replaced by [CONTACT_183728] (LMM) 
analysis (i.e., a special case of the GLMM). Similarly, the logistic regression analysis for the 18- month 
assessment will be replaced by [CONTACT_183729]. Normalizing transformations for continuous measures (such as cigarettes per day) will be applied as appropriate. Alternatively, Poisson GLMM or Poisson 
regression could be used to analyze the effect of MAPS on cigarettes per day. In addition to examining the 
effects of treatment on primary and secondary outcomes and mechanisms, we will also assess the mediation 
(indirect) effects of treatment on abstinence through the mechanisms (motivation, agency, stress/negative affect) using single and/or multiple mediator models.
109 With the primary outcome being abstinence at the 18 - 
month assessment, potential mediators will be mechanisms measured at the previous time points (i.e., 3, 6, and 12 months), one at a time. A recommended approach to estimating and/or testing for the indirect effects 
for a binary outcome variable is via coefficient standardization in the b path (e.g., logistic regression), as 
appropriate, and bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].
109-[ADDRESS_216909] sensitivity analyses by [CONTACT_183730], including multiple imputation (under a missing at random assumption),
114,115 and selection models (under  an assumption of non - 
ignorable missingness, or missing not at random).114,116- [ADDRESS_216910] of non- ignorable 
missingness. Regardless of the approach used to handle missing data, it is unlikely that serious biases in estimation or considerable loss of efficiency in inference will result when the proportion of missing data low 
(e.g., not more than 10%; even more so when the missing data proportions are similar in MAPS and ST).  
Overall, robust results based on both the primary and sensitivity analyses will strengthen our study  findings.  
 
Power . Our power analysis is based primarily on the comparison of 18- month abstinence rates between 
MAPS and ST. Because an intent -to-treat approach will be used, power is calculated based on the full sample 
without attrition (N=300; 150 per gr oup), given that individuals lost to follow -up will be treated as smoking). All 
power analyses assume a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_216911] would be approximately 10%. Using a chi -square test to examine the effect of 
treatment on abstinence at 18 months, a sample size of 300 (150 per group) will provide 80% power to detect 
an overall treatment effect that corresponds to abstinence rates of 10% and 21.9% in ST and MAPS 
respectively. Relative to examining abstinence over time, these calculations represent the worst case scenario. Table [ADDRESS_216912] the same average differences across  time.  
 
Table 2. Detectable differences in binary smoking outcomes with 80% power (abstinence, quit attempt)  
ST (n=150)  MAPS (n=150)  
5.0%  14.60%

20.0%  34.40%  
30.0%  45.70%  
40.0%  56.20%  
 
Although the proposed mediation analyses for aim 2 are theoretically -grounded and hypothesis -driven (see 
Figure 1), they are quasi -exploratory in nature, and the sample size for this study was based on power to 
detect a significant difference for Aim 1. Nonetheless, power for the mediation analyses (Aim 2) has been calculated as follows. For the mechanism analyses (Aim 2), power is based on a conservative 25% attrition 
rate (N= 300; 112 per group). Because the mechanism variables are continuous, a sample size of 300 (112 per group at 18 months) will provide 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_216913] deviation (SD) unit 
(difference in means between the ST and MAPS divided by [CONTACT_183731]), using a two group t -test with a 0.[ADDRESS_216914] treatment effects on the primary 
outcome and mechanisms, as well as the effects of mechanisms on abstinence (with power generally greater 
using continuous predictors than binary predictors such as treatment group), we expect to have good power to detect mediation effects. We note, however, that the power calculated for analyses in Aim 2 should be 
considered in the context of inflated type 1 error due to multiple analyses and hypothesis tests (including the mediation analyses) being performed for this aim. We feel that this inflated type [ADDRESS_216915] -effectiveness analyses (CEA) will compare the two interventions: ST and MAPS. 
The conventional CEA summarizes study findings in terms of the incremental cost -effectiveness ratio 
(ICER).121,[ADDRESS_216916] -effective.  
The net benefit approach, introduced more recently, 123,124, transforms the ICER into the net benefit, defined 
as NB(λ)= λ•  ∆E – ∆C, where λ represents a societal willingness -to-pay (WTP), ∆C represents the incremental 
costs; and ∆E represents the incremental effectiveness. We will report the CEA results both in terms of the conventional ICER and the CE acceptability curve,
123,[ADDRESS_216917] data. For each of the two intervention arms, the costs associated 
with implementing the intervention will come from three sources: study personnel, production of materials, and 
materials to participants. Project staff will keep logs of time spent on each of the tasks related to implementing 
the intervention, net of additional time that may be spent to  satisfy the research and evaluation components of 
the project. Costs of developi[INVESTIGATOR_183707], 
whereas costs associated with training counselors will apply only to MAPS. Any hardware cost s necessary for 
implementing the intervention will be tracked through invoices. Material costs will be obtained from invoices maintained by [CONTACT_183732]. All intervention- related costs will be 
expressed in local market terms for personnel, office space, furnishings, and equipment. The cost model will include all personnel, hardware, and material costs necessary to implement the interventions. Even if the research team uses existing resources at Moffitt Cancer Center, Stephenson Cancer Center, or the quitlines 
without charge (e.g., office space, phones, computers), we will estimate all of the expenses necessary for 
implementing MAPS since these expenses would be required for the implementation of population- based 
tobacco control programs. We will not include other health care costs. This decision was based on the existing evidence regarding the heath care cost consequences associated with smoking and cessation and the 
expectation of how this evidence impacts the difference in costs among different intervention arms. Although 
smokers incur greater health care costs than non-smokers,
129-[ADDRESS_216918] - 
effectiveness of cessation interventions are number of quitters and years of life saved (YOLS).[ADDRESS_216919] decision making in selecting 
among interventions tar geted at different conditions that compete for limited budgets, we also included quality - 
adjusted life year (QALY) as an additional effectiveness measure, and calculate QALY from the health utilities 
obtained from the EQ -5D. This algorithm was favored over other published methods of extrapolation because it 
was built from a model with good face validity and has been adopted in many related CE  studies.[ADDRESS_216920] -effectiveness of the interventions in three time frames: short -term,  mid- 
term and long- term. The short -term and mid- term CEA will use "number of quitters" as the effectiveness 
measure and assess cost -effectiveness based on information collected at Months 3 and 6 (short- term), Month 
12 (mid- term), and month 18 (long- term),  respectively. The long- term analysis will extrapolate the intervention 
effect to lifetime and use YOLS and QALY as the effectiveness measure. A 3% discount rate will be applied to 
costs and outcomes accrued in the second year and forward. First, we will work with the lead biostatistician of  
Page 12  this study ([CONTACT_55209]) to address the issue of missing data using analytical approaches such as multiple imputation 
or selection models (details see above) and obtain imputed values for individual with missing value in cost 
and/or effectiveness variable. Next, we will perform deterministic CEA based on ICER. We will then apply the 
Bayesian approach to construct the CE acceptability curve and conduct probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
(PSA).138,139 The PSA assigns distributions for each of the key parameters to characterize uncertainties in each 
parameter, propagates all parameter uncertainties through the model simultaneously using simulation methods, and generates an empi[INVESTIGATOR_183708];
140,[ADDRESS_216921] vs. MAPS arm. Using the "ST" arm as the 
reference group, the regression coefficients associated with the treatment binary variable will provide 
information on the cost -effectiveness of the MAPS intervention compared to ST. The regression model will be 
analyzed in two ways: 1) GLMM to examine how cost -effectiveness varies  over time, and 2) Bayesian 
regression to systematically update information gathered at each time point.

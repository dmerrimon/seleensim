3.1 Primary :  
The primary endpoint is the feasibility of the breath- hold technique for women 
treated with radiation for left -sided breast cancer in the prone position.  
 
3.2 Secondary : 
To determine whether cardiac dose and lung dose can be reduced in women receiving prone breast radiotherapy when inspi[INVESTIGATOR_427079]. To evaluate the changes in mean dose to the heart and lungs with prone breath hold. Other secondary endpoints include heart volume receiving 20 Gy, maximum dose to left ventricle/LAD artery and relative volumes of lung receiving [ADDRESS_539758] cancer survivors alive in the [LOCATION_002]. Among these women, approximately 50% have received radiotherapy as part of their primary treatment. Adjuvant radiotherapy following lumpectomy improves both local control as well as overall survival. As such, whole breast radiotherapy following lumpectomy is the standard of care for women under 70. With advances in treatment, cure rates for early stage breast cancer now frequently exceed 95%. For these reasons, interventions aimed at reducing the long- term risks of radiotherapy are critical in this population as more 
survivors are living longer.  
 Late cardiac toxicity from breast radiotherapy is well documented. Early randomized studies from the 1970s and 80s comparing lumpectomy alone to lumpectomy plus radiotherapy demonstrated improved cause specific survival with the addition of radiotherapy. However, this cancer -specifi c survival benefit 
was negated by [CONTACT_427095] 10- 20 years following 
radiotherapy (Clarke et al 2005).  While technical improvements in radiotherapy have dramatically reduced the risk of cardiac injury, recent studies have continued to demonstrate a small but significant increased risk of cardiovascular events following breast radiotherapy. Darby [CONTACT_427096] (Darby  [CONTACT_2297] 2013). Thus, methods for reducing cardiac dose will be 
anticipated to reduce the long term risk of cardiac disease.  
 
The two methods most frequently used to reduce cardiac dose during breast radiotherapy are prone positioning on a breast -board and inspi[INVESTIGATOR_427080]-

the prone and supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. Radiation treatment plans for each position were 
compared specifically looking at doses to heart and lung volumes. Their results showed that prone positioning was associated with a 91.1% reduction in lung radiation dose and 85.7%  reduction of in- field heart volume. A critique of the prone 
position is that due to gravity not only does the breast tissue fall away from the chest wall but the heart falls anteriorly towards the chest wall.

1.5% decrease in the rate of heart normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). However, the absolute lung volume seeing higher doses of radiation is increased with DIBH but relative lung percentages receiving significant radiation doses may be improved.

part of their routine care to consult with the radiation oncologist for treatment of left sided breast cancer  will be provided with in formation regarding this study. 
See attached list for our website, newsletter and Front Desk Poster . 
   
Subjects will be consented at an already scheduled appointment  with the 
radiation oncologist . This could be either at their initial consult visit or prior to 
their CT simulation appointment. Subjects will have the opportunity to take their 
time in making a decision, and will be encouraged to take the Informed Consent Form home and discuss it with whomever they would like. The treating physician 
will explain to the s ubjects the risks and benefits. They will be informed that their 
participatio n is voluntary, and lack of participation will not affect the subject’s 
relationship with the treating staff or our facility. Subjects will be consented by 
[CONTACT_21114], Co – PI, or the Research Staff of the Radiation Oncology  
department . Subjects will als o be made aware that should they consent, they can

they are interested in participating in the study. If they are, a member of the research staff will review the study with the patient and complete the consent process. Subjects will be enrolled prior to their radiation therapy panning simulation (CT simulation).  
 During the radiation planning appointment, patients undergo CT scans used to plan the radiation doses and delivery. The number of images taken during the CT simulation is the same is if they were not treated on this research study . A CT  
scan will be performed in the prone position using coached voluntary inspi[INVESTIGATOR_99807]- holding using the RPM visual feedback system. Prone breath hold will be 
conducted using a monitor in the headrest of the prone breastboard that the subject will watch. This monitor allows the subjects to see their respi[INVESTIGATOR_427081] a sinusoidal curve. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_427082] [ADDRESS_539770] completes the radiation planning simulation, the physician will generate two radiation treatment plans: one for the free- breathing scan (standard 
of care) and one for the breath- hold scan (using inspi[INVESTIGATOR_125344]). For each 
plan, the heart, left ventricle/LAD artery  and lungs will be contoured on each CT 
scan with radiation fields placed on both CT scans to dosimetrically determine heart, left ventricle/LAD  artery and lung radiation doses and coverage of the 
affected breast. The doses to the h eart, left ventricle /LAD artery  and lungs will be 
compared to determine the plan with the lower cardiac and lung doses.  
 At the discretion of the treating physician, the plan with the lower cardiac and lung doses will be used to treat the subject. Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_427083]. If the free breathing plan shows

 11.  D ATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 11.1 Identification of the DSMB obligated for oversight responsibilities:  
The Arizona Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will provide ongoing oversight for this trial.  
  11.2 Identification of the entity obligated for routine monitoring duties:  
Routine monitoring will be provided by [CONTACT_89031]/Quality Control (QA/QC) Program to ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol design and regulatory requirements.  
 11.3 Monitoring progress and data revi ew process:  
Routine monitoring of subject data will be conducted at least annually.   The f
irst routine monitoring visit  will include at a minimum:  
• Informed consent – 50% of cases enrolled;  
• Subject eligibility - 10% of cases, up to two subjects;  
• Data revi ew - 10% of cases, up to two subjects.  
 All subsequent monitoring visits will consist of randomly selected subject cases 
based on current enrollment and include continuing review of previously selected cases, as applicable.  
 A monitoring visit report and f ollow- up letter will be completed approximately two 
weeks after the routine monitoring visit; a copy will be maintained in the study file. A query/finding form or an electronic record will also be completed by [CONTACT_89032], clarification, information or corrections to the CRF and/or regulatory records. The Clinical Research Coordinator or other applicable staff responsible for the study will be given a copy of this form, or will be notified of the electronic record for resolution of queries/findings. The query/finding form will be maintained with a copy of the visit report for follow -up at the next monitoring visit. Electronic records will be 
available in the institutional database or provided by [CONTACT_109598]/QC Program st aff.

authorized staff.  
 Note: Routine monitoring of regulatory documents and test article will be 
conducted at least annually.  
 11.4 Process to implement study closure when significant risks or benefits are identified:  
There are no plans for early study closure for this study, since the intervention used will actually reduce the side effects patients experience.
                                                         
  
11.5 Description of adverse events and reporting procedures:  
 ADVERSE EVENTS  An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a casual relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
 
Any and all adverse events will be recorded on the UMC adverse events  record 
form and reviewed by [CONTACT_079].  
 
All adverse events will be classified using either the MedDRA term or NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 or 4.0 and will address:  
• Grade  
• Relationship to study drug(not related, unlikely, possible, probable, definitely)  
• Causality other than study drug (disease related, concomitant medication related, intercurrent illness, other)   
• Date of onset, date of resolution  
• Frequency of event (single, intermittent, continuous ) 
• Event outcome (resolved, ongoing, death)  
• Action taken (none, held, dose reduced, discontinued, medication given)  
  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at 
 any dose:  
 1) Results in death;  
 2) Is life -threatening;  
3) Requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89019];  
 4) Results in disability persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or:  
 5) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
14 | Page  
Protocol version  4 8/17/2015 Note : A SAE may also be an important medical event, in the view of the 
investigator that requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  
 
All serious adverse events, regardless of attribution, and any deaths will be reported within 24 hours of notification of the event to the sponsor and DSMB Coordinator. All serious adverse events, regardless of attribution, and any deaths will be reported within 5 days of notification of the event to the University of Arizona Human Subjects Protection Program.  
 
All serious adverse events will be processed by [CONTACT_100357], every six months. The DSMB Coordinator will re view the SAE reporting process to confirm reporting 
requirements are met.  
 11.6  Plan for assuring data accuracy and protocol compliance:  
Routine study activity and safety information will be reported to the DSMB on an annual basis, or more frequently if requested. These reports will include:  
• Study activity, cumulative and for the period under review;  
• Safety (narrative description on non- serious and serious adverse events, 
protocol pre- determined early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_109595] -emergent 
adverse events); 
• Predetermined protocol early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_89020]/futility;  
• Status of study in relationship to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004];   
• Current dose level of study agent;  
• Routine monitoring and protocol compliance (describe the monitoring process and identify the status of the monitoring);  
• Comments;  
• Attachments (AE data reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_89021], SAE letters and reports, results of any review(s), applicable correspondence with the IRB or other regulatory agencies  
 
 Data, safety and study progress will be reported to:  
• Human Subjects Protection Program (IRB) at least annually;  
• Sponsor (if applicable) at least annually.  
 . Identification of the sponsor or funding agency, as applicable:  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_89022]; in writing, the funding agency, if applicable, any action resulting in a temporary or permanent suspension of the study.  A copy of this correspondence will also be forwarded to the DSMB and the SRC.  
 
11.7 Process to implement study closure when significant risks or benefits are identified:  
 Not applicable.   
 
12.  ADDITIONAL SAFETY REPORTING  
 
Serious adverse events will be reported to the Data Safety Monitoring Board as well as the institutional IRB within 24 hours of notification of the event to the PI.  
15 | Page  
Protocol version  4 8/17/2015 Serious adverse events will be reported using the FDA MedWatch form  to inform 
the DSMB, and using the F224 (Reportable Local New Information that is 
Potentially Problematic) form to inform the IRB.

14.    RECIST CRITERIA  
 Not A pplicable  
 15. R EMOVAL OF SUBJECTS  
 Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by [CONTACT_8018]. If this occurs, the investigator, or designee, is to discuss with the subject the safe and appropriate processes for discontinuation fr om the investigational  
intervention. 
 
The investigator or designee must document the change in status of the subject’s participation in the study and as applicable, the level of follow up that is agreed to by [CONTACT_423] (i.e. agrees to follow up exams, adverse event review, phone contact, but  not to further treatment and/or procedures).  
 
Subject withdrawal of consent for a study indicates that the subject does not wish to receive further protocol required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21882], and the subject does not wish to, or is unable to continue further study participation. Subject data only up to the time when consent is withdrawn will be included in the analysis of the study.  
  
 16. S TASTISITICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 Statistical analysis will be performed in collaboration with [CONTACT_427103], the Director of the University of Arizona Cancer Center Biometry Shared Service.   
 The primary endpoint of the study is the feasibility of the breath- hold technique 
for women treated with radiation for left -sided breast cancer in the prone position.  
Although it is expected that the number of women who are unable to master the breath- hold technique will be small, the proportion of women who cannot master 
the technique will be estimated with the appropriate exact 95% confidence interval.  
 The secondary endpoint is to evaluate the changes in the mean dose to the heart and lungs with prone breath hold.  Each woman enrolled in the study will have two radiation plans generated in the pr one position:  one for the free- breathing 
scan and one for the breath- hold scan.  The mean difference between the 
dosimetrically determined heart and lung radiation doses will be computed with the associated 95% confidence interval.  A paired t test will be used to assess 
16 | Page  
Protocol version  4 8/17/2015 whether the mean difference is statistically significant.  The other secondary 
endpoints will be analyzed in a similar fashion.  
 
Ten women will give 80% statistical power to detect a difference of [ADDRESS_539778] error of 16% or less. The estimated mean difference (and its standard error) will be used to generate the sample size required for a larger study to statically assess the benefit of adding the breath -
hold in reducing the cardiac and lung radiation dose.

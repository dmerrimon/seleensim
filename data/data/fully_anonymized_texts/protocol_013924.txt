 1. Introduction to the Personal Resilience Empowerment Program 
(PREP) at Hackensack Meridian Integrative Health & Medicine  
 
The Personal Resilience Empowerment Program ( PREP ) at Hackensack Meridian Integrative Health & 
Medicine is designed to assist patients in preparing for a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a surgery or 
procedure. The program offers classes  and personal sessions where the patient, with the  support of an 
Integra tive Health Coach ( Registered Nurse), is introduced to new life skills that will help him or her 
during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_403537].  
Using evidence -based tools derived from our Five Pi[INVESTIGATOR_403538] & Well -Being (Sleep, Activity,  
Purpose,  Nutrition, and Resilience), the patient learns how to :  
■ Acquire mind -body skills to assist in stress management  
■ Learn to thrive by [CONTACT_403564]  
■ Feel empowered to manage  their own  health  
■ Gain self -care skills to decrease anxiety, p ain, and nausea naturally  
■ Control the stress response and trigger the relaxation response to promote well -being  
■ Discover what foods fuel the body in preparation for healing, during recovery, and overall health  
The goal is for the patient to leave the coaching sessions feeling empowered to use new tools to elicit 
the relaxation response or build on resiliency practices they may already use.  
The program is led by [CONTACT_403565]/registered nurses who will help to facilitate and 
motivate the pa tient to make positive choices for overall health and wellness. They educate and support 
group members to achieve their goals through lifestyle and behavior adjustments. Health coaching 
brings together several disciplines including sleep, activity, purpose , nutrition, resilience. There is no 
cost for the class . 
2. Introduction to the PREP project  
 
The PREP at Hackensack Meridian Integrative Health & Medicine was designed in Legacy Meridian to 
assist all selected patients with upcoming hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. For the “Personal Resilience Empowerment 
Program (PREP) in the perioperative setting of surgically treated cancer patients ”, hereafter “the Project  
or PREP ”, the Hackensack Meridian Integrative Health & Medicine is designing a new pi[INVESTIGATOR_403539].   
All patients diagnosed with cancer that will undergo a scheduled surgical (Hepato -Biliary , and Thoracic ) 
procedure in Hackensack Meridian Health and specifically in the Jersey Shore University Medical Center, 
will be eligible to participate (for more details please see eligibility criteria, section 4).  
Overall, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_403540] 5 coaching sessions  and a n introductory session/visit that will take 
place on the physician’s office . The initial  physician visit will focus on patient eligibility, introduction to 
[ADDRESS_508989], informed consent and a pre -intervention survey and will be conducted by   [CONTACT_119785] [INVESTIGATOR_213832] -investigators listed above . The  following 5 sessions will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_403566]/registered nurses  (for details please see section 5). A post -
intervention survey will be completed during the fi nal session  and repeated at one month, and at [ADDRESS_508990] is to investigate whether using the PREP as an intervention in patients diagnosed 
with cancer would result in improving various metrics including impro vements to  resilience, sleep, 
activity, purpose, nutrition,  empowerment to manage one’s own health and well -being,  decrease in pain 
medication use and more rapid return to previous functional status  according to Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group  (ECOG ).  
3. Study Purpose and Objectives  
 
3.1. Purpose of the study    
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_403541] (PREP) in supporting surgical oncology patients before, during  and after  their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .  
 
3.2. Primary objectives   
The primary objective of this project is to determine if an increase in knowledge and awareness through 
coaching sessions improves quality of life by [CONTACT_403567]’s own health in the 
application of skills related  to our 5 pi[INVESTIGATOR_403542]. (sleep, activity, purpose, nutrition, 
resilience) in oncology patients.  
 
3.3. Primary and Secondary Endpoints   
Measurements of health related quality of life, slee p, activity, purpose, nutrition, resilience  and  
empowerment to manage one’s own health and well -being   at [ADDRESS_508991] th e number of times (if any) that  nurse coaches 
are called for support outside  of the protocol .

 4. Study Participants  
 
4.1. Study population  
All patients who will undergo a scheduled surgical , thoracic (lung),  hepato -biliary (cholangiocarcinoma , 
pancreatic, liver) procedure in Hackensack Meridian Health at Jersey Shore University Medical Center 
that meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in this project.  
Initial contact [CONTACT_403568]’s office and every surgeon 
listed as investigator/sub -investigator in this protocol will present the study to his/her patients and will 
consent them.  
 
4.2. Number of participants  
This project is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_403543], during 
and after their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_403544] a weekly basis in the  physician practices . We plan to run this project 
for 3 months, therefore taking into consideration patients’ willingness to participate and complete all 
sessions and the number of potential losses during follow -up, we estimate that we will include 30 -40 
patients but no more than 50 patients .  
4.3. Selection Criteria  
Inclusion Criteria  
1. 18 years of age and older  
2. Patients diagnosed with  cancer of the thoracic (lung) , hepatobiliary system 
(cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic, liver)   that will undergo a scheduled surgical procedure at 
Jersey Shore University Medical Center.  
3. Able to understand and sign the informed consent form  
4. Willingness to participate in the study and comply with protocol requirements  
Exclusion Criteria  
1. < 18 years of age  
2. Unable to provide consent  
3. Unable to participat e at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_403545] (if ECOG >1). See 
section [ADDRESS_508992], informed consent and a pre -intervention survey and will be conducted by  [CONTACT_403569] . The remaining sessions will be conducted by [CONTACT_403570]/registered nurses. A post -intervention survey will be completed during the final session.  
In addition to the basic demographics being collected, the fol lowing clinical information will also be 
collected for every patient across multiple time points : AJCC cancer stage, occurrence of chronic pain (if 
applicable), pain  level (using a scale 0-10), pain medication usage (yes/ no), pain medication type used 
(prescription or over the counter), and pain medication dosage and frequency for each pain medicine 
listed (where applicable).   
The goal of this project is to investigate whether using the PREP as an intervention in patients diagnosed 
with cancer would result  in improving various metrics including improvements to  health related quality 
of life, sleep, activity, purpose, nutrition, resilience, and empowerment to manage one’s own health and 
well-being , decrease in pain medication use and more rapid return to pre vious functional status.

5.4. Study visits / sessions   
As described earlier, this project will include one initial visit focusing on patient eligibility, study 
presentation and informed consent followed by [ADDRESS_508996] either in -person 
or over the phone.  
The initial visit will be c onducted by [CONTACT_403571], 
while the coaching sessions will be conducted by [CONTACT_403572] & Medicine .  
Attendance  and the duration of each session  will be rec orded in a Word document .  
5.4.1.  Research Eligibility  
The research eligibility will take place in the office of each one of the surgeons listed in this protocol. 
Following consent based on research eligibility,  all participants will complete the  pre-interventio n 
survey.  
More specifically, the surgeon will present the study using the script presented below.  
The Personal Resilience Empowerment Program (PREP) will assist you in preparing for your 
upcoming hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. You will learn and practice skills that you can use beyond your 
surgery or procedure in your everyday life. We look at this health event as an opportunity to 
examine your lifestyle choices and build your awareness of the mind/body connection so you can 
become empowered to manage your own he alth. You will be contact[CONTACT_100180] a 
Registered Nurse (RN) health coach to schedule a n in-person  group coaching and telephone 
coaching session within one week of this consent. During the group session, you will be introduced 
to our five pi[INVESTIGATOR_403548] -being: sleep, activity, purpose, nutrition and resilience. 
Following the group session and prior to your surgery, you will have a phone call with the nurse 
health coach. In this phone call, the RN health coach will  reinforce our five pi[INVESTIGATOR_403549]-being and discuss how you and the coach will partner throughout this process. In total, you 
will meet with the nurse health coach five times -first during a group coaching class, and then 
session [ADDRESS_508997] you in managing stress, reducing potential pain and empowering you to improve your 
quality of life.  
Patients that are interested in taking part in the study wil l be then consented by [CONTACT_403573] (upcoming 5 sessions) . They will 
be asked to provide their contact [CONTACT_403574] a contact [CONTACT_6227].  
To facilitate the in formation and engagement process, the surgeon will also provide enrolled patients 
with the “The Personal Resilience Empowerment Program (PREP) flyer ”. 
At the end of the information process, the surgeon will notify patient that the  Registered  Nurse - Health  
Coach will contact [CONTACT_403575].  
Finally, patients will be asked to fill the pre -intervention survey at the end of the session. Participants 
will be provi ded with hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_403550] a database 
created specifically for this project in Excel.  
After the end of the  research eligibility visit , the nurse coach will receive a spreadsheet of patients 
enrolled i n the study by [CONTACT_403576]   
5.4.2.  First session  
The first session is a group coaching class prior to surgery. After an overall presentation of the program, 
the class will focus on introducing the 5 pi[INVESTIGATOR_403551] -being: sleep, activity, purpose, 
nutrition and resilience. Several handouts will be provided for patients to take home and use between 
sessions. All handouts and the PowerPoint presentation for this session will be submitte d to the IRB for 
approval.  
This is a [ADDRESS_508998] over the phone.  
During the second session, the nurse  coach  after a quick overview of the group session will focus on the  
coaching needs of the patient at that time. The coach will address  the readiness to change and will 
reinforce the skills taught in the group class.  
To facilitate the discussion and ensure consistency across patients, the nurse coach will use a script (see  
appendix 2).  
The call is expected to last approximately 30 minutes (but  not more than 60 minutes ). The total time of 
the session will be documented and recorded in the patient’s research file.  The nurse health coach will 
complete a health coach consult note in research file.  
[ADDRESS_508999] 15 -30 minutes (but not more than 60 minutes).  
During the session, the nurse coac h will re -introduce the skills and he/she will practice those skills with 
the patient. To facilitate the discussion and ensure consistency across patients, the nurse coach will use 
a script (see appendix 3). The nurse health coac h will encourage and empower the patient to use these 
skills throughout the remainder of the stay and beyond. Coach will offer additional support as 
appropriate.  
In the end of the session, the nurse will remind the patient that they will receive a telepho ne call after 
discharge to schedule the fourth session over the phone. The patient will also be offered the 
opportunity to call the nurse -coach if they feel like they need additional support at any time throughout 
this program.  
5.4.5.  Fourth session  
The health c oach will be notified of the patients discharge date from the surgeon’s office and the health 
coach will contact [CONTACT_403577] a telephone coaching session within one week of the 
discharge.  To facilitate the discussion and ensure consistency acro ss patients, the nurse coach will use a 
script (see appendix 4).  
The fo urth session will be over the phone and will last approximately 15-30 minutes (but not more than 
60 minutes). During the session, the nurse -coach will focus on the skills and will encou rage and empower 
the patient that these can be used for relaxation, stress management and to build and sustain resilience  
beyond the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59361] . Coach will offer additional support as appropriate .  
5.4.5.  Fifth session  
Session [ADDRESS_509000] the same day as the follow -up doctor’s appointment  and 
will last 15 -30 minutes (but not more than 60 minutes).  
The nurse -coach will conclude the program, remind patient of the techniques learned and will also 
encourage and empower the patient  that these are life skills that can be used for relaxation, stress 
management and to build and sustain resilience. Coach will offer additional support as appropriate  after 
the end of the study. To facilitate the discussion and ensure consistency across pa tients, the nurse coach 
will use a script (see appendix 5 ). 
In the end of the final session, the patient will be asked to complete a hard copy of the exit survey (post -
intervention).  
5.4.6.  Follow -up 
Patients will be sent a  hard copy of the follow -up  survey to the address  they have provided at one and 
three months after discharge.  
 
  
[ADDRESS_509001] in Excel.  
6.2. Statistical Design  
The proposed study will be a descriptive case -series of thoracic and hepatobiliary oncology patients who 
are scheduled to undergo surgical intervention at Jersey Shore University  Medical Center, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_403552], that will be enrolled in the Personal Resilience Empowerment 
Program (PREP).  
6.2.[ADDRESS_509002], to determine the potential sample size.  
6.2.2 Planned Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS] Interim Analysis  
Due to the nature of the study design, there is no interim analysis planned.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis Methods  
Continuous measures and outcomes will firs t be summarized using minimum, maximum, mean, 
standard deviation, median, and interquartile range, while categorical and ordinal measures will first be 
summarized using frequencies and percentages. For any patient measure that can be described as a 
time to  an event, the median time will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier procedure with the 
standard error being estimated by [CONTACT_273919].  
In order to detect significant changes in the longitudinal repeated measurements from the pre - and 
post -interven tion patient survey, McNemar or Stewart -Maxwell tests will be used for categorical 
measures while Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests will be used for ordinal measures. Any continuous measures 
[ADDRESS_509003] consider using the 
Pearson’s Chi -Square test.  However, if any expected frequency within the contingency table is less than 
5 then the Fisher’s exact test will be used.  For any ordinal variables with more than [ADDRESS_509004] will be used . 
A two -sided p -value will be reported for each tes t result using a potential Type 1 error of α = 0.05.  Any 
p-value shown to be less than α will be considered statistically significant.  As necessary, graphical 
representations of results will be provided.  
6.2.3 Data Relevance  
The data elements being colle cted are both clinical and patient self -reported measures.  The clinical 
aspects that are proposed will allow the study team to better ascertain the patients’ health condition 
pre-operatively and post -operatively during the most critical timeframes for pre paration and recovery, 
respectively.  These pi[INVESTIGATOR_403553]. Whereas the self -reported measures that are 
proposed for collection, via surveys, will provide the study team with more of an understanding of the 
patients’ awareness of the effects of the 5 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_36523] (Activity, Nutrition, Sleep, Purpose, and Resilience), as 
well as their feelings towards making changes in their life based on the  PREP coaching process.  
Additionally, the follow -up surveys will allow the team to gain information from the patient on how they 
are recovering as well as how they can improve PREP for future patient participants.  
6.2.4 Data Coding  
[IP_ADDRESS] Data De -identification  
All study data will be de -identified prior to analysis by [CONTACT_20526] a unique and generic study identifier to 
each patient upon enrollment into the study.  This assigned number will not contain or be linked to any 
personal he alth identifiers (PHI). A coded list containing the matching information between the generic 
study identifier and the true identity of the patient will be kept on a Hackensack Meridian Health 
password protected network computer and will not be shared with the study biostatistician or anyone 
else performing data analyses.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Data Element Coding  
All clinical study data will be recorded as it is written in the patient chart, lab test report, or pathology 
report.  However, we may later create or recode  measures that indicate the presence or the lack of 
presence of something specific pre - or post -operatively as 0 (not present) and 1 (present). This could 
include the presence of certain comorbidities that may affect the coaching process or surgical outcom es. 
For coaching follow -up notes and survey data, the responses that are requested from the patient are 
largely from a 0 – 5 Likert Scale (with some written explanation) and will be coded as such. For any 
13 
 questions that elicit an affirmative response (i.e. : yes) or a negative response (i.e.: no) the measures will 
also be coded as a [ADDRESS_509005] protected comput ers only accessible to the study team.  
Statistical analysis will be performed using:  
1. SAS software Version 9.4 of the SAS System for Windows (SAS Institute Inc. [2012], Cary NC, 
[LOCATION_003]. URL www.SAS.com  ) 
2. R language for  statistical computing (R Core Team [2017].  R: A language and environment for 
statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL http://www.R -
project.org/  ) 
  
14 
 7. Ethical Consideration s 
 
The study will be conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP), the Declaration of Helsinki, Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and in accordance 
with the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations on Pro tection of Human Rights (21 CFR 50).  
7.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review  
The final study protocol, surveys and collection tool will be approved by [CONTACT_4707] 
(IRB) at Jersey Shore University Medical Center. Approval will be received  in writing before initiation of 
the study.  
Any changes to the study design will be formally documented in protocol amendments and approved by 
[CONTACT_14226].  
7.2. Data Management  
All data will be stored on a Hackensack password protected co mputer only accessible by [CONTACT_403578].  
Jersey Shore  UMC password protected computers are only accessible by [CONTACT_941] P.I. and/or research staff.  
Data collected will be maintained securely with limited access. Records will be retained in accordance 
with regulatory, organizational and sponsor requirements, but no less than six (6) years following the 
completion of the research.  Disposal of records will be done in such a manner that no identifying 
information can be linked to research data.  
7.3. Informed co nsent  
A signed informed consent shall be obtained from each participant prior to entering the study. The 
informed consent forms provides information and explanations of the aims, methods, anticipated 
benefits and potential hazards of the study.  
Before any  protocol -specific screening procedures are administered, information will be given to all 
potential participants during the study introduction taking place in the first session.   
The acquisition of informed consent will be documented in the participant’s  record and the informed 
consent form will be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_403579]. The original signed form will be retained in the Investigator Site File 
and a copy of the original  will be provided to the participant prior to participation in the study.  
The participants will be informed that they may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice 
and compi[INVESTIGATOR_154316]’s data will cease as of the date of his/her written request for withdrawal.   
 
7.4. Confidentiality  
The patient charts, collecte d data and all analysis of the data will adhere to HIPAA & institutional patient 
confidentiality requirements.  
15 
 More specifically, a coding system will be used for which a unique identifier (study number) will be 
assigned to each name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_8972].  Each participant whose data is collected will be assigned a 
unique study number. Only the study number will be included in the data collection tool, data analysis 
tools, and potential publications. The list with the direct identifiers (for the purposes of  linking data with 
the surveys and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_403554]) will also be stored in a secured server in the Jersey Shore 
University Medical Center, Center for Integrative Medicine , in a separate file.  
Analytical datasets will be stored on secure serve rs that also limit access to the investigator team. 
Should results of the study be published or reported, individual names or other identifying information 
will not be used.

 Appendix 2 – Handout and Script for Session No 2  
 
Session 2 - Phone call within one week prior to surgical admission with nurse health coach (at least 30, 
not more than 60 minutes)  
“Hi my name [CONTACT_832] ______ and I am a Registered Nurse Health C oach. We will partner throughout 
this process to help you bounce back and assist you in managing stress, reducing potential pain 
and empowering you to improve your quality of life . Today, in our second session, we will 
review th e skills from the group clas s and I will provide you with support around the skills. In the 
class, you learned the five pi[INVESTIGATOR_403551] -being that can support you to manage your 
upcoming surgery. These are life skills which you can apply during your upcoming hospi[INVESTIGATOR_403555]. To begin, let’s look at your pain, anxiety and 
well-being. How would you rate your pain right now from [ADDRESS_509006] pain? How about your anxiety level from 0 -10? If 0 is no anxie ty and 10 is severe 
anxiety, how would you rate how you feel right now? How about your sense of well -being?  
From 0 -10 with 0 meaning not well and 10 being well, what number would you rate yourself 
right now?  
We are now going to discuss the five pi[INVESTIGATOR_403548] -being by [CONTACT_403581][INVESTIGATOR_403556] . Let’s start by 
[CONTACT_403582] e ssential for the body to heal, repair, and prepare for the next 
day. How are you sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]? [Coach will offer support as appropriate]  
Our next pi[INVESTIGATOR_403557]. Activity is more than exercise; it includes your movement throughout 
the day. Movement is important for your body but it is also important for your mind. When y ou 
move, chemicals are released which improve your emotions and your brain function. What is 
your current activity level? Has your doctor given you any restrictions on your activity?  [Coach 
will offer support as appropriate]  
Our third pi[INVESTIGATOR_403558]. Pu rpose is where you find meaning in your life; it’s what gets you out 
of bed in the morning. When we are clear on our values, strengths and our sense of purpose, it 
can help serve as an anchor in tough times. Sometimes when we experience challenges such as

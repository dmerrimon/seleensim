Confidential and Proprietary Page 8 of 99 Study Design:  
Please refer to  Figure 1 for a schematic diagram of the study design and treatment duration.  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, active comparator study in eligible subjects 
with a new diagnosis (initial or subsequent) of MAC lung infection who have not started treat ment for 
their current infection. Subjects will be randomized at Baseline in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the two 
treatment regimens: ALIS  + background regimen or ELC  + background regimen for 6 months.  Note 
that background regimen in this study is defined  as AZI+ETH  per randomized treatment. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_11338] (North America, Europe,  and Rest of World) and history of 
MAC lung infection (initial or subsequent). After Baseline, subjects will return to the study site for in-clinic visits at Months 1, 3, 5, 6/EOT, and 7/ EOS.  
Visits at Months 2 and 4 do not require in-clinic appointments. At these non -in clinic visits, AEs and 
concomitant medications will be assessed. eDiary data will be collected continually for assessment of 
study drugs intake, and subjects will be required to provide and ship sputum samples for analysis. At 
the Month 6/EOT visit, subjects will discontinue all study drugs and will be followed for a 1 month off 
treatment period, during which medical or non-medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_692701].  
At Month 7/EOS, subjects will complete all protocol-specified assessments and the final EOS procedures.  
The procedures and assessments conducted at each study visit in the study are provide d in Table 4. 
Study Duration:  
Subjects will receive ALIS  + background regimen  or ELC  + background regimen  for 6 months and 
then remain off all study drugs  for 1 month. The Screening period will be up to approximately -70 days 
to -1 day (~2.5 months).  
The total duration of the study will be up to 9.5 months from the Screening visit to EOS.  
Study Sites and Locations:  
This study is planned to be conducted at approximately 150 sites globally.

 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
1.1. Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Lung Disease 
Nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease caused by [CONTACT_692760] a potentially life-threatening and 
progressively destructive disease that is associated with symptoms of productive cough, fatigue, 
shortness of breath, fever, weight loss, lung function decline, and hemoptysis ( Kim et al., 2008; 
Kobayashi et al., 2018 ; Park et al., 2016). It often complicates other chronic debilitating 
underlying lung diseases such as bronchiectasis or COPD. When NTM lung disease occurs in patients without underlying lung comorbidities, it has been implicated in progressive lung disease ( Prince et al., 1989) . If left un treated, MAC lung disease can be progressive, and has a 
5-year mortality rate of 33.3% ( Ito et a l., 2012 ). Mycobacterial lung disease carries a MAC 
related 5 -year all -cause mortality rate of up to 42% ( Diel et al., 2018) . Prevalence has increased 
globally over the past decades ( Chalmers et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2008 ; Khan et al., 2007; 
Marras et al., 2007 ). 
Signs and symptoms of NTM lung disease caused by [CONTACT_692761] a ttributable to 
an underlying disease, such as COPD, bronchiectasis, CF, HIV, and pneumoconiosis ( Griffith et 
al., 2007). Evaluation is often complicated by [CONTACT_692762]. Fatigue and loss of energy were reported as the “most common symptoms” by 80% of meeting attendees in an informal poll while 40% reported chronic cough and coughing up blood and 
phlegm ( US FDA Patient Focused Drug Development Workshop, 2015). Less commonly, 
malaise, dyspnea, fever, and weight loss can also occur, usually with advanced MAC lung 
disease.  
The current treatment of NTM lung disease is primarily with a multidrug regimen based on the treatment of tuberculosis  (Daley et al., 2020). The recommendation for MAC lung disease is a 
3-drug antibiotic regimen that includes a macrolide, ethambutol, and a rifamycin , however the 
optimal drugs, regimens, and duration of therapy are unknown. The recommendation of a 3-drug regiment over a 2 -drug regimen is stated with low confidence on a conditional recommendation. 
Currently clinical trials evaluating the clinical utility of a 2 -drug versus a 3-drug regimen are 
ongoing. The regimen is administered for 12 months beyond culture conversion to negative, although the  duration of antimicrobial therapy often exceeds 18 months ( Johnson and Odell, 
2014). Intravenous amikacin or intramuscular streptomycin are recommended for patients with 
fibrocavitary disease or severe nodular/bronchiectatic disease; however, the optimal treatment 
has yet to be established. Intravenous aminoglycoside use is limited by [CONTACT_692763], poor uptake by [CONTACT_16272] ( Zhang et al., 2018), and the potential for 
ototoxicity, loss of balance, and impaired kidney function with high or prolonged systemic exposure ( Kovacevic et al., 2016; Rybak et al., 1999).  
1.2. Amikacin Liposome Inhalation Suspension  
ARIKAYCE® was approved by [CONTACT_3557] [ADDRESS_939532], for the treatment of MAC 
lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen in subjects who do not achieve 
negative sputum cultures after a minimum of 6 consecutive months of a multidrug background regimen therapy. On 27 October 2020, ARIKAYCE was granted market authorization by [CONTACT_692764]® (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension)  Insmed Incorporated 
Clinical Trial Protocol INS -415                                         Version 3.0, Global Amendment 2 , 11 JUL  2022

 European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of MAC in adults with limited treatment 
options who do not have cystic fibrosis. On 23 March 2021, ARIKAYCE was approved by [CONTACT_692765], Labour and Welfare (MHLW)  for the 
treatment of patients with NTM lung disease caused by [CONTACT_692766] a multidrug regimen. Amikacin liposome inhalation suspension is a sterile aqueous liposomal formulation for inhalation via nebulizati on. ALIS is comprised of amikacin 
sulfate encapsulated in liposomes composed of DPPC and cholesterol; other inactive ingredients include sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment, and water for injection. ALIS is supplied in a single-use 10 mL vi al to deliver 590 mg amikacin to the nebulizer. ALIS is 
administered by [CONTACT_641193] a nebulizer system using the (LAMIRA) nebulizer 
system.
 The nebulizer system delivers medication in the form of aerosols that are inhaled into the 
lungs.  
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_692712], Study INS-212 (CONVERT), evaluated 
subjects with refractory NTM lung disease caused by [CONTACT_692767]. Over 80% of the subjects in this study had been treated with at least 3 antibiotics prior to enrollment in the study, yet all subjects 
persistently had prior positive sputum cultures. The addition of ALIS 590 mg QD to a multidrug 
antimycobacterial regimen statistically significantly increased the proportion of subjects achieving culture conversion (defined as 3 consecutive monthly negative sputum cultures) by 
[CONTACT_43380] 6 as compared to a multidrug antimycobacterial regimen alone (29.0% vs 8.9%, 
respectively, P  < 0.0001). Treatment with ALIS also statistically significantly increased the 
proportion of subjects achieving durable culture conversion at 3 months off treatment as 
compared to a multidrug antimycobacterial regimen alone (16.1% vs 0%, respectively, 
P < 0.0001). The safety profile of ALIS [ADDRESS_939533] not started treatment. A significant proportion of patients treated with currently available multidrug therapy do not achieve treatment success. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed in a total of 16 studies involving 1,462 subjects, the rate of treatment success was 60% ( Kwak et al., 2017) . In subjects who were macrolide 
susceptible and had previously been untreated for MAC, treatment for at least 1 year resulted in sputum culture conversion rate of 65.7% ( Diel et al., 2018). There is currently no validated PRO 
instrument to evaluate symptoms in patients with MAC lung disease. This study aims to generate evidence demonstrating the domain specification (via modern psychometric methods), reliability, validity, and responsiveness (within -subject meaningful change) of the PRO endpoints of 
ALIS -based regimen within the MAC lung disease population. The instrument validated in this 
study will be used for the assessment of the clinical benefit in a separate study.  
1.3.1. Study Population  
Patients with MAC lung disease are heterogeneous in part as a consequence of the signs and symptoms of this infection mirrorin g the underlying pulmonary disease(s) that predispose 
patients to the infection. The clinical approach to MAC lung disease is to first exclude more common reasons for worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765], and the decision to treat is often based on the 

ARIKAYCE® (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension)  Insmed Incorporated 
Clinical Trial Protocol INS -415                                         Version 3.0, Global Amendment 2 , 11 JUL  2022 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 24 of 99 
 conclusion that the MAC lung disease is progressing, evidenced by [CONTACT_692768] (eg development of cavitary disease) or persistent or worsening symptoms attributed to MAC. Additionally, there is no standardized approach to the classification or to the severity of 
disease by [CONTACT_483446]. The likelihood of a timelier diagnosis is partially related to the experience of a clinician managing a patient with this uncommon infection. The decision on 
which antibiotic regimen to administer is typi[INVESTIGATOR_692713]’s underlying lung 
disease.  
The proposed study will utilize eligibility criteria to decrease the heterogeneity of the study population. Importantly, the general approach to the clinical management of individuals of such a population is similar to a reasonable extent. This approach of  decreasing heterogeneity will 
improve the power of the study to detect the efficacy and safety of the ALIS -based regimen. In 
particular, this is important for measurement of patient symptoms, which are inherently subject to random fluctuation that may obscure the treatment effects. The subject population under investigation for this clinical study will include adults with non -cavitary lung disease with a new 
(initial or subsequent) MAC lung infection who have not started treatment for their current infection. 
1.3.2. Treatment and Duration of Exposure  
Patients to be evaluated in this study have mild disease and have not received treatment for their 
current MAC lung infection. The design and treatment have been extensively discussed and 
agreed with a global steering committee of experts experienced in the management of NTM pulmonary disease and with regulatory agencies. Subjects will be randomized to ALIS + 
background regimen or ELC +  background regimen. Note that background regimen in this study 
is defined as AZI+ET H per randomized treatment. Treatment will be administered continuously 
for [ADDRESS_939534] patients with MAC lung disease 
and patient tolerability for regimens that include one of these 2 drugs. In addition, the chosen companion drugs to ALIS can also be considered to contribute to the therapeutic success by [CONTACT_692769]. 
As stated in both the BTS and ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA guidelines, a 2-drug regimen including 
a macrolide and ethambutol is the regimen with the fewest possible drugs for treating MAC . 
Data recently published subsequent to the release of the global guidelines show that the 2-drug regimen of azithromycin and ethambutol may be an option for the treatment of non- cavitary 
MAC lung disease: 76% of patients were able to achieve sputum cultur e conversion after 
12 months of treatment, and none of those who failed to culture convert developed macrolide resistance ( Moon et al., 2019). Ethambutol is likely the key companion drug for preventing the 

ARIKAYCE® (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension)  Insmed Incorporated

 emergence of macrolide resistance ( Haworth et al., 2017; Daley et al., 2020). Literature has 
shown that patients have a higher risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_692714] (Griffith et al., 2007; Morimoto et al., 2016 ) drug regimen over a 2-drug 
regimen over a 2drug regimen: 
 “In patients with macrolide- susceptible MAC pulmonary disease, we suggest a treatment 
 regimen with at least 3 drugs (including a macrolide and ethambutol) over a regimen with 
 2 drugs (a macrolide and ethambutol alone) (conditional recommendation, very low certainty 
 in estimates of effect).”  
Additionally, both sets of treatment guidelines note the uncertainty over who to treat and when to 
start treatment for newly diagnosed NTM pulmonary disease as there are no randomized 
controlled trial data. In the ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA guidelines it is directly stated:  
 “No randomized, controlled trials have been conducted to examine the impact of treatment 
 on either survival or quality of life. Limited retrospective observational data have failed to 
 demonstrate that treatment of NTM pulmonary disease prolongs survival over watchful 
 waiting.”  
The BTS guidelines have a similar statement on the uncertainty “... fulfilling the criteria 
[ATS/IDSA] does not necessarily imply that treatment should be st arted, as patients can remain 
stable without antibiotic treatment.”  
Prevention of development of macrolide resistance is a priority in MAC treatment. As stated in the ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA guidelines for MAC pulmonary disease: “The optimal drugs, regimens, and duration of therapy are not known.” ( Daley et al., 2020). The guidelines do not 
state that a 2 -drug regimen is inferior to 3 drugs with regards to prevention of macrolide 
resistances, only that there is currently insufficient evidence to support the 2 -drug regimen. 
Miwa et al rep orted that no isolates in either group developed macrolide resistance, although the 
study was underpowered ( Miwa et al., 2014). Ito et al also evaluated the 2 -drug regimen 
compared to 3 drugs; their results suggest that [ADDRESS_939535] 
3-drug treatment ( Ito et al., 2020). Regardless, drug susceptibility will be closely monitored and 
the unblinded data will be regularly reviewed by [CONTACT_692770]. Of note there are other active 
trials that use a 2 -drug comparator arm of a macrolide and ethambutol in the treatment of 
pulmonary MAC disease, but more importantly the clinical equipoise of using a 2- versus a 
3-drug regimen is currently being investigated by a large multicenter study. The current active 
comparator is an accurate control for this study population as this is a population with milder disease, and a 4 -drug regimen (including ALIS) is not warranted. Germane to all clinical 
research, new treatments and treatment durations are being studied.  
The optimal duration of therapy in MAC pulmonary disease is unknown. As stated in the 2020 
ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA guidelines, while MAC species are the most common organisms causing NTM pulmonary disease, the optimal treatment duration for MAC pulmonary disea se 
has not been evaluated in a prospective randomized clinical trial and the conditional recommendation for [ADDRESS_939536]. Given the lack of data on the optimal duration of therapy, the panel voted unanimously to 
continue to follow the recommendations from the 2007 Guideline. The duration of exposure to 

ARIKAYCE® (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension)  Insmed Incorporated 
Clinical Trial Protocol INS -415                                         Version 3.0, Global Amendment 2 , 11 JUL  2022

 the study regimen (6 months) is less than the maximum duration of exposure of 20 months to the 
ALIS -based regimens in the subjects who parti cipated in both Study INS-212 and Study INS-312 
that evaluated a more difficult- to-treat population of adult patients with treatment refractory 
MAC lung disease.  
1.3.3. Efficacy Endpoints, Placebo Control, and Active Comparator 
The primary objective of this study is to generate evidence demonstrating the domain specification (via modern psychometric methods), reliability, validity, and responsiveness 
(within -subject meaningful change) of the PRO endpoints. Specifically, findings on 
psychometric validation will be optimized and reported for:  
1) Cross-sectional validation (modern psychometrics, internal consistency, concurrent validity, and known-groups validity) at Baseline. 
2) Test -retest reliability between Screening and Baseline among subjects reporting no change on 
PGI-S between screening and baseline. PGI -S anchors will be PRO specific, with a respi[INVESTIGATOR_692715] -S applied to the QOL-B respi[INVESTIGATOR_692705] F-SF 7a, respectively. 
3) Within -subject meaningful change estimated via anchor -based meth ods and validated via 
eCDFs and ePDFs between Baseline and EOS (Month 7).  
There are no established clinical endpoints to evaluate the clinical benefit of a therapeutic 
regimen in MAC lung disease. This study aims to validate PRO endpoints that can evaluate benefit of a treatment in MAC lung disease. This study will utilize PRO endpoints that are being 
used uniquely to determine the clinical meaningfulness of any treatment for MAC lung disease, 
in addition to microbiological endpoints. 
This study will assess data generated from PRO instruments. Therefore, given that this endpoint 
incorporates subject symptomology and subjectivity, it is critical to conduct the study in a 
double-blinded fashion to minimize the potential for biased responses. An active comparat or 
allows for the evaluation of the incremental benefit of ALIS and is an appropriate, efficient, and 
accurate control for this study population. The double- blind study design  and blinding  to 
microbiology results allows for an evaluation of the efficacy an d safety of an ALIS -based 
regimen. 
1.4. Risks and Benefits for Study Subjects 
A favorable benefit/risk profile  has been established for the use of ALIS  in subjects with 
refractory MAC lung disease. The safety profile is acceptable given the significant risk of the 
disease, the inadequacy of current treatment approaches, and early indications of positive clinical outcomes from the use of ALIS.   
 
ALIS has not been studied in adults with non- cavitary lung disease with new (initial or 
subsequent) MAC lung infections who have not started treatment for their current infection. Current treatment for patients with newly diagnosed MAC lung disease is similar to that for patients with refractory MAC lung disease; it is based on treatment with a multidrug regimen. However, optimal treatment has yet to be established, and current treatment have many adverse effects. A significant proportion of subjects treated with currently available multidrug therapy do not achieve treatment success. Data from previous studies (INS -212 and INS -312) in subjects

 with refractory MAC lung disease provide insight on the eventual benefit/risk evaluation for this 
subject population. This study will evaluate the benefit/risk profile of ALIS in subjects with newly diagnosed MAC lung disease. 
 
1.5. Treatment, Route, Dosage, Treatment Period 
Eligible subjects with non -cavitary lung disease with new (initial or subsequent) MAC lung 
infections who have not started treatment for their current infection (see Section  4) and who have 
signed the ICFs will be randomized and will receive treatment as follows (see Figure  1) 
• ALIS 590 mg QD + AZI 250 mg QD + ETH 15 mg/kg QD for 6 months, or 
• ELC (matching placebo for ALIS) + AZI 250 mg QD + ETH 15 mg/kg QD for 6 
months 
1.6. Randomization and Blinding 
Upon meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria, subjects will be randomly assigned through IWRS in a 1:1 ratio to either of the treatment groups. The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_11338] 
(North America, Europe, and Rest of World) and history of MAC lung infection (initial or subsequent). Subjects, Investigators, and Sponsor will be blinded to treatment group assignments 
and microbiology results throughout the study. In case of subject emergencies, unblinding of the 
assigned treatment will occur per establis hed procedure. 
1.7. Compliance Statement, Ethics, and Regulatory Compliance  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the ethical principles derived from 
international guidelines including the Declaration of Helsinki and the CIOMS Internati onal 
Ethical Guidelines, applicable ICH GCP Guidelines, and applicable local regulatory 
requirement(s) and laws.  
1.7.1. Subject Confidentiality  
The Investigators and the Sponsor will preserve the confidentiality of all subjects taking part in the study, in accordance with GCP and local regulations.  
The Sponsor will observe the rules laid down in the European Data Protection Regulation (EU) 
2016/[ADDRESS_939537]’s anonymity is maintained. On the eCRF or other 
documents submitted to Sponsor, subjects should be identified by a unique subject identifier as 
designated by [CONTACT_1034]. Documents that are not for submission to Sponsor (eg, signed ICFs) should be kept in strict confidence by [CONTACT_737]. 
In compliance with ICH GCP Guidelines, it is required that the Investigator and institution 
permit authorized representatives of the company, of the regulatory agency(s), and the EC or IRB direct access to review the subject’s original medical records for verification of study -
related procedures and data. The Investigator is obligated to inform the subject that his/her study -
related records will be revie wed by [CONTACT_31714]-named representatives without violating the

The date and time (if applicable) that informed consen t was given should be recorded on the 
eCRF.  
1.7.3. Regulatory Compliance  
The study protocol, subject information and consent form, the IB, any subject diary card or written instructions to be given to the subject, available safety information, subject recruitment 
procedures (eg, advertisements), information about payments and compensation available to the subjects and documentation evidencing the Investigator’s qualifications should be submitted to 
the IRB/EC for ethical review and approval according to local regu lations, prior to the study 
start. The written approval should identify all documents reviewed by [CONTACT_152872]. 
Changes in the conduct of the study or planned analysis will be documented in a protocol 
amendment and/or the SAP.  
All protocol amendments a nd changes to the ICFs or changes of the investigational site, 
facilities, or personnel (when applicable) must be submitted to the IRB/EC, and where necessary, approval from the IRB/EC must be obtained. The Investigator should notify the IRB/EC of 
deviations from the protocol or SAEs occurring at the site and other AE reports received from the Sponsor, in accordance with local procedures.

 3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1. Overall Plan  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active comparator study in eligible 
subjects with a new diagnosis (initial or subsequent) of MAC lung infection who have not started 
treatment for their current infection (Figure 1). Subjects will be randomize d at Baseline in a 1:1 
ratio to receive one of the two treatment regimens: ALIS  + background regimen or 
ELC  + background regimen for 6 months. Note that the background regimen in this study is 
defined as  AZI+ETH  per randomiz ed treatment.  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_11338] (North America, Europe, and Rest of World)  and 
history of MAC lung infection (initial or subsequent). After Baseline, subjects will return to the study site for in -clinic visits at Months 1, 3, 5, 6/EOT, and 7/EOS. 
Visits at Months  2 and 4 do not require in-clinic appointments. At these non- in clinic visits, AEs 
and concomitant medications will be assessed, eDiary data will be collected continually for assessment of study drug s intake, and subjects will be required to produce and ship sputum 
samples. At the Month 6/EOT visit, subjects will discontinue all study drugs and will be 
followed for a 1  month off treatment period, during which medical or non- medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_692717].  
At Month 7/EOS, subje cts will complete all protocol- specified assessments and the final EOS 
procedures.  This study aims to validate PRO outcomes from the QOL -B and PROMIS F -SF 7a within the 
MAC lung disease population.  
The validating variables will utilize the following PRO tools: 
• EXACT  
• E-RS  
• SGRQ  
• FACIT – Fatigue Scale  
• PGI-S – Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]  
• PGI-S – Fatigue  
Clinical/Digital validating variables:  
• ppFEV
1 
• Sputum cultures (Section  8.1) 
• Assessment of MAC isolates with amikacin MIC ≥ 128 μg/mL  
• Actigraphy  
The procedures and assessments conducted at each study visit in the study are provided in  
Table  4. Please refer to Figure 1 for a schematic diagram of the study design.

4.2. Discontinuation of Study Drugs and Participant 
Discontinuation/Withdrawal  
4.2.1. Discontinuation of Study Drugs  
All subjects are encouraged to stay in the study for continued safety monitoring regardless of 
discontinuation of study drugs . If a subject discontinues one or more study drugs (ALIS/ELC, 
AZI, and/or ETH), they will remain on the other study drug(s) and continue with the scheduled study visits. For these subjects, it is highly encouraged to stop all MAC treatment at Month 6 (per study design) to evaluate the primary and secondary endpoints during the off treatment 
period.  However , if deemed medically necessary per the Investigator, these subjects who 
prematurely discontinue one or more study drugs may be allowed to continue treatment during 
the off treatment period.  
If a subject discontinues ALIS or ELC:  
• The reason for ALIS or ELC discontinuation will be recorded in eCRF. 
• The subject will remain on the other study drugs (AZI and ETH) and continue with the 
next scheduled study visit. 
• At the next scheduled visit, the subject will complete the EOT visit assessments.  
• The subject will complete a Month [ADDRESS_939551] discontinues AZI and/or ETH, the reason for drug discontinuation should be recorded 
in the eCRF. The EOT visit should not be completed at this time. The subject will remain on the other study drugs (ALIS/ELC and AZI or ETH) and should initiate therapy consistent with the 
2020 ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA  treatment guidelines (Daley et al., 2020 ), and continue with the 
next scheduled study visit. Any changes to therapy and treatment regimen should aim to prevent 
the development of macrolide resistance. Changes to treatment should be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor to ensure compliance with the 2020 ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA treatment 
guidelines.  
For subjects who discontinue one or more study drugs, replacement therapy may be provided at 
the discretion of the Investigator; this is not considered rescue therapy.  
Subjects may be discontinued from one or more study drugs at the discretion of the Investig ator 
if they meet treatment stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_692719].

Clinical Trial Protocol INS -[ADDRESS_939552] withdraws consent from continued safety monitoring, the EOS visit should be 
completed. 
4.2.2. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
A subject may decide to wit hdraw from the study at any time, for any reason. The Investigator 
and/or Sponsor also have the right to withdraw a subject from the study if it is no longer in the 
interest of the subject to continue in the study, or if the subject’s continuation in the s tudy places 
the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a subject does not or cannot follow study 
procedures). All subjects who are withdrawn from the study should complete protocol- specified 
early discontinuation procedures (Section 4.2.3 ). 
4.2.3. Early Discontinuation Procedures  
If a subject prematurely discontinues the study, the subject will do the following: 
• Attend the EOT visit  
• Attend EOS visit [ADDRESS_939553] dose of study drugs  
• Complete EOS assessment  
If a subject withdraws from the study, the Investigator will complete and report the observations 
as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal including the date of last treatment and the 
reason for withdrawal.  
If the subject is discontinued from the study due to an AE, the Investigator will follow the subject until the Investigator deems that the AE has resolved or stabilized. In case of unresolved AEs including significa nt abnormal laboratory values at the EOS assessment, these events will 
be followed up until resolution or until they become stable. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Lost -to-Follow -up 
A subject will be considered lost- to-follow- up if the site is unable to contact [CONTACT_692775]. 
4.2.4. Subject Replacement  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study will not be replaced. 
4.2.5. Subject Rescreening Procedures  
Upon approval by [CONTACT_2728], subjects may be rescreened once, if the following apply: 
• The screening culture is not positive for MAC, or  
• The subject has a MAC isolate with MIC for amikacin ≥  128 µg/mL at Screening, and/or  
• The average QOL -B respi[INVESTIGATOR_692720] >  85, and/or  
• The subject has active COVID -[ADDRESS_939554]’s average QOL -B respi[INVESTIGATOR_692720] >  85, the subject may take the

 questionnaire again, once on the next day and again  within 7  days to calculate a new average; all 
other Screening assessments do not have to be repeated. Subjects should be rescreened within 
the original screening period timeframe (approximately - 70 to -1 days). 
If a subject is rescreened due to Screening culture that is not positive for MAC or MAC isolate has amikacin MIC ≥  128 µg/mL, all other Screening assessments must be repeated. The subject 
will have a new Screening window (approximately -70 to - 1 days).   
If a subject has active COVID -[ADDRESS_939555] a new Screening window (approximately -70 to -1 days).  Subjects who experienced 
COVID-19 related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], severe disease, and/or ARDS may not be rescreened.  
Rescreened subjects will be assigned a new subject number within the EDC system.  
4.3. Premature Termination of the Study  
The Sponsor may decide to terminate the study prematurely. If this occurs, written notification of 
the study termina tion is required to be sent to the site.  
Conditions that may warrant study termination may include the following: 
• Discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in the study 
• Decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue development of the 
drug 
• Decision by a regulatory authority or the Sponsor to stop the study at any time, where 
applicable 
In the event of study discontinuation, subjects will discontinue study drugs. Refer to Section  4.2.3 for early discontinuation procedures. 
Refer to Section  6.3 for considerations during public health emergencies. 
The Sponsor will notify the regulatory authorities in all countries where the study is being conducted regarding the reason for terminating the study.

 formation. Once the liposomes are formed, the defiltration is started using  sodium chloride 
to the targeted lipid concentrations, eg  ELC. 
5.1.2. Azithromycin and Ethambutol Tablets  
The background regimen that will be used in the study are azithromycin 250 mg tablets and 
ethambutol 100 mg and ethambutol 400 mg tablets . These drugs are commercially available and 
will be sourced regionally and provided by [CONTACT_1034]. 
5.1.3. Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatments  
Upon meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria, subjects will be randomized through an IWRS 
vendor in a 1:1 ratio to either of the treatment groups. The randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_11338] (North America, Europe, and Rest of World) and history of MAC lung infection (initial or subsequent).  
Investigators (including independent evaluator/raters and clinicians providing care to the 
subject), Sponsor, and subjects/caregivers will be blinded to treatment group assignments throughout the study.  
Study personnel and subjects are strongly discouraged from discussing any aspect of study drugs 
that may lead to unintentional unblinding of treatment assignment in order to maint ain study 
integrity.  
Selected individuals who are not involved in the conduct of the study may have access to unblinded data as needed for safety review or other data review (see Section  3.2).  
Unblinding is only to occur at the conclusion o f the study or in the case of subject emergencies.  
5.1.4. Study Drugs Administration  
ALIS [ADDRESS_939556] procedure to be conducted (see  Table  4). 
Azithromycin 250 mg tablets dosed 1 tablet QD, and ethambutol tablets dosed at 15 mg/kg will 
be taken by [CONTACT_692776], with or without food. The Investigator should refer to local labeling 
guidance:  
• To monitor AZI and ETH use 
• To conduct any necessary monitoring procedures (eg, ECG monitoring, ophthalmic exams, audiology testing) 
The Investigator is responsible for recording any AEs and SAEs as appropriate (see 
Section  9.10 ).   
Timing of Administration  
Study drugs should be administered QD around the same time each day, any time of day, in the 
fasted or as -fed condition.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Dose Interruption  
It is recommended that a ll subjects remain on prescribed daily treatment throughout the study. 
However, experience has shown that dose interruptions may be helpful to avoid discontinuation 
of ALIS ( Swenson et al., 2020). If a subject experiences a nonserious AE that is distressing and 
an interruption of study drugs dosing (ALIS/ELC, AZI and/or ETH per Investigator discretion) is needed to avoid discontinuation of study drugs, contact[CONTACT_692777].  
At the discretion of the Investigator, dose adjustments of azithromycin and/or ethambutol may be allowed if criteria are met per local label recommendation (ie, renal or hepatic insufficiency).  
All dose interruptions must be documented in the subject’s source documentation and recorded 
in the eCRF.  
5.1.5. Method of Assessing Treatment Compliance  
Subjects will be required to bring all their used and unused study drugs supplies to in -clinic study 
visits during the treatment period or, if the visit is being conducted virtually, have all used and unused study drugs supplies available to be accounted for.  
Accountability for study drugs administration during the study is the responsibility of the 
Investigator or designees. Drug accountability will be recorded at each in- clinic study visit by 
[CONTACT_692778] (eDiary) data (accounting for prescribed dose interruptions/adjustments) and count of returned study drugs.  
A subject will be considered noncompliant with use of study drugs if treatment adherence is less  
than 80% or more than 120% unless instructed by [CONTACT_692779] (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Subjects who are non-compliant with study drugs should be retrained. 
5.1.6. Emergency Unblinding  
Unblinding of treatment assignment for a subject may be necessary due to a medical emergency, 
rescue therapy (Section  5.2.2), or any other significant medical event (eg, pregnancy).  
In the case of an emergency, the Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if 
unblinding is warranted. The Investigator is required to follow the specific steps outlined in the 
unblinding procedure in the Study Reference Manual.  Prior to unblinding, it is suggested that the 
Investigator contact [CONTACT_692780] (if this does not interfere with emergency 
treatment). In all cases of unblinding, the date, including justification for unblinding, must be 
fully documented and signed by [CONTACT_692781]. The originally signed copy is maintained in the study file at the site, and a copy is 
provided to the Sponsor or its designee. The date and reason for the unblinding is also entered in 
the study file and any associated AE reports. The Investigator can obtain the identity of the study 
drugs dispensed to a subject through IWRS.

5.2.2. Rescue Therapy  
Rescue therapy is defined as any change from the randomized treatment (ALIS + background 
regimen  or ELC  + background regimen) as prescribed in the study (includes drug, dose, 
frequency, route of administration) due to progression of MAC lung infection. Rescue therapy 
does not include changes from randomized treatment (eg, removal or replacement of drug) due to 
intolerance or AEs from study drugs.  
If at any time during the study the Investigator believes that a subject has wo rsened clinically 
(eg, progressive worsening of signs/symptoms), the Investigator will determine the cause of the 
clinical deterioration (eg, intercurrent illness, noncompliance with pulmonary therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or 
progression of the MAC lung infection) and should contact [CONTACT_1689]. The clinical symptoms and cause should be documented in the subject’s source documentation. If non-urgent 
intervention is required, the Investigator will optimize concomitant therapy and will contact [CONTACT_479749] [ADDRESS_939560] is unable to return 
for the unscheduled visit, the assessment of change in signs/symptoms can be confirmed with a 
telephone visit. At that visit, the Investigator will then confirm the cause of the worsening 
signs/symptoms and should contact [CONTACT_1689]. If the Investigator confirms that the 
cause of the worsening in signs/symptoms is due to progression of MAC lung infection and 
rescue therapy is warranted, the Investigator will contact [CONTACT_692784] (Section  5.1.6 ). All contacts with the Medical Monitor should be 
documented in the subject’s source documentation. 
  
Subjects who receive rescue therapy will stop randomized treatment (ALIS  + background 
regimen  or ELC  + background regimen), be treated by [CONTACT_692785], and will continue with their remaining scheduled study visits. 
Data will be collecte d on the appropriate eCRF pages. 
5.3. Prohibited Medications and Medications with Limited Use 
Subjects are prohibited from using any inhaled antibiotics or any aminoglycosides with activity 
against MAC, such as streptomycin or kanamycin at Screening and throughout the study. The 
use of these drugs should not be initiated during the study period unless as determined necessary 
by [CONTACT_737]. Subjects are also prohibited from using any antibiotics for the treatment of  MAC lung infection (besides study drugs) , unless required as rescue therapy (Section  5.2.2).

Chronic anti-inflammatory therapy (eg, high- dose ibuprofen, prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day or the 
equivalent) is permitted if the regimen remains unaltered for at least 28 days preceding 
Day 1/Baseline and throughout the study. The doses should not change except for safety reasons 
or as needed for medical management of the subject.  
Although systemic expos ure to amikacin is low after ALIS administration, precaution should be 
taken if subjects require the following systemic medications that may have possible interactions with amikacin, including, but not limited to the following: potent diuretics (such as et hacrynic 
acid and furosemide), beta lactam antibiotics (such as penicillins and cephalosporins); bisphosphonates; platinum compounds and thiamine. 
The following may have possible interactions with azithromycin or ethambutol: digoxin, 
colchicine, and coumarin anticoagulants. Antacids should not be taken simultaneously with 
azithromycin or ethambutol. Azithromycin or ethambutol must be administered at least [ADDRESS_939562] be consulted.

 6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1. Schedule of Assessments 
The Schedule of Assessments is presented in Table  4.  
COVID-19 restrictions and/or concerns may impact subject attendance at in- clinic visits 
(Section  6.3). In the event subjects are restricted from attending in -clinic visits or if subjects have 
concerns regarding travel and attending in-clinic visits (due to potential public health concerns), 
the site should contact [CONTACT_692786], and decisions 
should be documented in the source documentation. 
The PRO instruments will be provided to the subject in electronic format on a computer tablet 
and should be conducted at approximately the same time of day at the specified timepoints.  
All PRO assessments must be completed prior to other study assessments (eg, physical 
examination, vital signs, laboratory assessments, audiology, etc) with the exception of sputum collection. If the subject produces their best sputum samples first thing in the morning prior to 
being able to attend a clinic visit, the subject should consistently collect sputum samples first, 
then proceed with PRO assessments throughout the study.  
At each in -clinic visit, the subject will complete the PRO assessments in the order listed below. 
T
he approximate time to complete each assessment is provided; these are conservative estimates 
based on different studies and actual time may be less than indicat ed. 
1. QOL -B (~10 -15 minutes) 
2. PROMIS F -SF 7a (~8 -12 minutes) 
3. EXACT (~3 minutes)  
4. EXACT -RS (~3 minutes)

7.1.1. Quality of Life Questionnaire – Bronchiectasis  
The QOL -B is a validated,  self-administered, reported outcome questionnaire used to assess 
symptoms, functioning, and health related quality of life in adults with non- CF bronchiectasis 
(Quittner et al., 2015). It measures outcomes over a recall period of 1 week. The questionnaire 
contains 37 items on 8 scales (physical, role, vitality, emotional, social, treatment burden, health 
perception, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696])  (Appendix 1).  
The QOL -B questionnaire will be completed at study visits in the order specified in Section  6.1 
and Schedule of Assessments ( Table  4). Subjects will self -administer the questionnaire 
electronically . The QOL -B questionnaire will be the first assessment to be conducted at the 
specified study visits (with the exception of sputum collection, if applicable).  
Each of the 37 items is scored from 1 to 4, and each of the 8 scale scores is standardized on a 0 to 100-point scale, with higher scores representing fewer symptoms or better functioning and 
quality of life. Scores are calculated for the 8 domains: physical, role, vitality, emotional, social, 
treatment burden, health perception, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696].  
7.1.2. PROMIS Fatigue Short Form 7a  
The PROMIS F- SF 7a is a self -administered questionnaire assessing a range of self -reported 
symptoms over the past 7 days, from mild subjective feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, 
debilitating, and sustained sense of exhaustion that likely decreases one’s ability to execute daily activities and function normally in family or social roles (Ameringer et al., 2016). Fatigue is 
divide
d into the experience of fatigue (frequency, duration, and intensity) and the impact of 
fatigue on physical, mental, and social activities over 7 items. Examples of items are: “How 
often did you feel tired,” and “How often were you too tired to take a bath/shower” 
(Appendix 2 ). 
The
 PROMIS F- SF 7a will be completed at study visits in the order specified in Section  6.1 and 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table  4). Subjects will self -administer the questionnaire  
electronically . The PROMIS F- SF 7a will be the second assessment to be conducted at the 
specified study visits.  
Response options are on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1=never to 5=always. The PROMIS  F-SF 7a is universal rather than disease -specific and  given its brevity, poses minimal 
burden to the subject.

 7.2. Validating Variables 
7.2.1. EXAcerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT)  
The EXACT PRO  was developed and qualified for use in characterizing COPD clinical 
endpoints ( Jones et al., 2011; Leidy et al., 2010 ; Leidy et al., 2011; US FDA, 2013) . Several of 
the concepts assessed by [CONTACT_692794]. These include, but are not limited to, dyspnea and fatigue. The EXACT total score measures acute, sustained, and worsening signs and symptoms exceeding 
subject- specific expected variability . The EXACT PRO is composed of [ADDRESS_939570] symptoms, difficulty expectorating, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and fear 
or concern ( Appendix 4).  
The EXACT PRO will be completed at study visits in the order specified in Section  6.1 and 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table  4). Subjects will self -administer the questionnaire  
electronically .  
7.2.2. Exact Respi[INVESTIGATOR_208466] (EXACT- RS) 
The E- RS is an 11- item subset of the EXACT PRO assessing exacerbations of respi[INVESTIGATOR_037] ( Leidy et al., 2014a ; Leidy et al., 2014b) ( Appendix 4). 
The E- RS will be completed at study visits in the order specified in Section  6.1 and Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table  4). Subjects will self -administer the questionnaire .  
7.2.3. St. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ)  
The SGRQ is a sel f-administered instrument for the assessment of overall health, daily life, and 
perceived well -being among individuals with obstructive airways disease ( Jones et al., 1992). 
The instrument consists of 50 items with 76 weighted responses grouped into a set of 17 questions. The items are divided into 2 parts and 3 categories: symptom, activity, and impact. 
Part 1 (symptom component) assesses an individuals’ perception of their recent respi[INVESTIGATOR_66780]. Part 1 evaluates frequency  and severity of symptoms including cough, sputum 
production, wheezing, breathlessness, and the duration and frequency of attacks of breathlessness and wheeze. Part 2 (activity and impact components) addresses individuals’ current state. The activity compo nent is composed of a series of items evaluating metabolic equivalence of 
incrementally increasingly physically demanding activities, ranging from sitting to climbing a flight of stairs. The impact component measures domains of social functioning and psychological disturbances resulting from airway disease ( Appendix 5).  
The SGRQ will be completed at study visits in the order specified in Section  6.1 and Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table  4). Subjects will self -administer the questionnaire .  
7.2.4. Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) – Fatigue Scale  
The FACIT -Fatigue Scale is a short, 13 -item, easy to administer, tool measuring an individual’s 
level of fatigue during their usual daily activities during the past week (Smith et al., 2010). The level of fatigue is measured on a four -point Likert scale (4 = not at all fatigued to 0 = very much

 8. EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
8.1. Sputum Culture  
Microbiological assessment of sputum specimens will be used for secondary efficacy 
measurements.  
During the study, pre-dose expectorated or induced sputum samples (approximately 2 mL) are 
required at study visits specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  4). To improve the 
probability of obtaining a good sputum specimen, [ADDRESS_939571] at each assessment; subjects will provide [ADDRESS_939572] should then come into the clinic for 
sputum induction on the scheduled visit. The induction should be performed within the specified visit window (Table  4). At the scheduled visit, once sputum is collected (spontaneously or by 
[CONTACT_692795]), study drugs can be administered. If the subject produces their best sputum samples first thing in the mornin g prior to being able to attend a clinic visit, the subject should 
consistently collect sputum samples first, then proceed with PRO assessments and other 
assessments throughout the study.  
Sterile, leak proof, non- wax, disposable plastic containers labeled with [ADDRESS_939573] as sessments. Sputum may be sent to 
local laboratories to be cultured for organisms other than mycobacterium.

Sputum specimens will be cultured in broth media (liquid) in addition to agar media (solid), and 
will be held for up to 6 weeks. A negative culture result will not be reported until after this time 
has transpi[INVESTIGATOR_5697]. All contaminated samples will be retreated and re-cultured once. 
Growth of other bacteria due to co- infections (eg, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, M. abscessus , other 
NTM ) will be reported as applicable.  Colony counts of MAC growth will be reported. Isolates of 
MAC will be identified using a commercial RNA probe (AccuProbe, Gen Probe, Inc., GenoType 
NTM -DR Ver 1.0, Hain Lifescience) and subsequently identified to species using molecular

 methodology ( Cousins et al., 1996 ). Standard antibiotic sensitivity testing usin g MICs will be 
routinely performed on mycobacterial isolates ( CLSI, 2018a ; CLSI, 2018b; Forbes et al., 2008 ). 
The MAC species and genotype at the Screening and/or Baseline sputum specimen will be 
identified by [CONTACT_136922] (Illumina Nextseq500TM) in subjects who achieve 
sputum culture conversion and who subsequently have positive sputum culture(s) (broth or agar); typi[INVESTIGATOR_692728].  
MAC Culture Assessment Definitions 
MAC culture negative No MAC growth on agar media and broth media in all sputum 
cultures at a visit.  
Non-productive Prior to culture conversion or post recurrence : visits where 
subjects were recorded as non -productive are considered MAC 
culture positive. 
Post culture conversion: visits where subjects were recorded as 
non-productive are considered MAC culture negative. 
Culture conversion No MAC growth on agar media and broth media in all sputum cultures at [ADDRESS_939574] of 2 consecutive negative cultures.  
Recurrence: Relapse  Subsequent to culture conversion, at least [ADDRESS_939575] 
2 consecutive visits. A MAC positive culture is defined as the 
same species and genome as cultured at Screening/Baseline.  
Recurrence: New infection  Subsequent to culture conversion, at least [ADDRESS_939576] 2 
consecutive visits. A MAC positive culture is defined as a culture that is different than cultured at Screening/Baseline (different 
species, or same species but different genome).  
 
8.2. Actigraphy 
The Philips Actiwatch Spectrum PRO actigraphy device resembles a wristwatch and senses the 
activity of the wearer. It is to be worn continuously by [CONTACT_692796]. It is water-resistant and does not need to be removed for bathing. The subject will be 
provided with charging materials and should be instructed to charge the device once every 30 days (if needed). The data collected should be downloaded at each in-clinic visit or during a 
home care visit (if applicable).

bronchodilator use if applicable) at Screening and Day 1/Baseline ( Table  4) prior to the 
administration of study drugs.  
9.5. ECG Monitoring  
ECG monitoring should be performed if required by [CONTACT_692798]/QTc.

to measure the concentration of CRP. 
Pregnancy Test  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed on WOCBP at Screening. A urine pregnancy test (at 
least 25 mIU/mL sensitivity) will be performed on WOCBP as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table  4). Results will be en tered into the eCRF. Women not of childbearing 
potential are defined as postmenopausal (ie, amenorrheic for at least 12 months), or surgically or 
naturally sterile.  
9.8. Chest CT Scan  
A chest CT scan will be performed at Screening. A prior chest CT scan may be used if this CT scan was obtained within [ADDRESS_939579]’s Screening visit. Chest CT scan will be 
read locally.  
9.9. Adverse Events 
The Investigator is responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as provided in the protocol and remain responsible for following up all AEs.  
The Investigator should proactively follow subjects with AEs until the EOS for each subject. At the EOS visit, the Investigator will record the AE status in the eCRF.  

ARIKAYCE® (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension)  Insmed Incorporated 
Clinical Trial Protocol INS -[ADDRESS_939580] a 
causal relationship with this treatment. A n AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Medical occurrences that begin after obtaining informed consent, but before administration of 
study drugs will be recorded under medical history/Current Medical conditions, not as AEs. 
Treatment -emergent adverse events are AEs that occurred on or after the date of first dose of 
study drugs and within [ADDRESS_939581] medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death,  
• Is life -threatening, 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 
• Is an important medical event.  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time o f the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (ICH E2A Guideline. Clinical 
Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, October 1994). 
Medical and scientific jud gment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46822]. Examples include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, and blood dyscrasias or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Note:  
• A procedure is not an AE or SAE, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or 
SAE.  
• Pre-planned (prior to signing the ICF) procedures or treatment requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31643]-existing conditions which do not worsen in severity are not SAEs.

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 61 of 99 
 • Suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product should be 
considered as a SAE  
• Laboratory abnormalities are usually not recorded as AEs or SAEs.   However, 
abnormal laboratory findings (such as clinical chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis) or other abnormal assessments (physi ologic tests such as electrocardiograms [ECG], 
imaging studies, or vital signs) that are associated with signs and/or symptoms, or are 
considered clinically significant in the judgment of the Investigator, require 
therapeutic intervention, or lead to discontinuation of the administration of study drugs , must be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definitions of an AE (or 
SAE).  
9.9.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest are defined as events known to be attributed to parentera l 
amikacin and inhalation of antibiotics. Additional information on some AESIs will be collected 
in the eCRF. The AESI category groups and preferred terms include the following: 
• Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (allergic alveolitis, pneumonitis, interstitial l ung disease) 
• Hemoptysis (hemoptysis) 
• Bronchospasm (asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchospasm, dyspnea, exertional 
dyspnea, prolonged expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], throat tightness, and wheezing) 
• Exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease (COPD, infective exacerbation of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, and infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis) 
o Pulmonary exacerbation will be defined based on the Investigators best clinical 
judgment. Details of these events should be reported in an additional “pulmonary 
exacerbation” page of the eCRF.  
• Ototoxicity (deafness, neurosensory deafness, unilateral deafness, dizziness, hypoacusis, 
presyncope, tinnitus, vertigo)  
• Nephrotoxicity (nephropathy toxic, azotemia, oliguria, albuminuria, acute kidney injury, anuria, renal impairment) 
• Neuromuscular disorders (muscle weakness, peripheral neuropathy, and balance disorder)  
9.9.4. Assessment of Severity  
The following definitions should be used to assess intensity of AEs: 
• Mild: Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolera ted, ie, does not interfere with 
subject’s usual function. 
• Moderate: Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity.  
• Severe: Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity, ie, interferes significantly with subject’s usual function .

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 62 of 99 
 9.9.5. Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator who identifies an AE will determine the causality of each based on the temporal 
relationship to administration of study drug s and clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about 
causality will be graded using the categories listed below.  
• Related : A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of study drugs; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the study drugs ; 
that disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in study drugs dose; and/or that 
reappears or worsens when the study drugs is administered. Could not be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_532853], co mplications, concomitant 
drugs, or concurrent treatments.  
• Not Related : A reaction for which sufficient data exist to indicate that the etiology is 
unrelated to the study drugs. 
9.9.6. Management of Adverse Events  
Initial education of adverse effect expectations i s crucial for subjects initiating study drugs in 
order to maintain retention of subjects in the study. Based on data from the ALIS development program, there is an association with ALIS and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] (eg, cough, dyspnea) reported as AEs, likely from airway irritation by [CONTACT_692799]. Data observed from 
Study INS-212 (refractory MAC population) show that the majority of subjects treated with ALIS experienced their first AE within [ADDRESS_939582] shown that specific interventions may be helpful in the management of TEAEs (Swenson et al., 2020). Pretreatment with a bronchodilator, move administration of ALIS to the 
evening, antitussives, post- dose gargle (warm liquid or glycerin), and other interventions may 
help with management of TEAEs.  
9.10. Reporting Requirements 
9.10.1. Adverse Events  
All AEs will be reported on the Adverse Events Form of the eCRF. Adverse events that occur between the time subject signs the ICF for the study and the time when subject receives his/her first dose of study drugs on Day [ADDRESS_939583] be reported to organization delegated by [CONTACT_692800] 24 hours of becoming aware of the event; corrections and additions 
are required to be submitted within 24 hours. Study- specific email, telephone, and fax number 
for SAE reporting are presented in the Study Reference Manual.

 Unexpected drug related SAEs as assessed by [CONTACT_692801]/EC, regulatory authorities, participating Investigators and, if cross reporting is required for S[LOCATION_003]Rs, in accordance with all applicable global laws and 
regulations. A S[LOCATION_003]R is a Serious Adverse Reaction, which is suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_692802], ie, its nature or severity is not consistent with the information in the relevant Reference Safety Information. SAEs, including 
those that do not meet requirements for expedited reporting, and all other AEs will be reported to 
the regulatory agencies as appropriate. 
9.10.3. Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy, including the pregnancy of a male subject’s female partner, that occurs during 
any phase of the study must be reported to the Sponsor or designated organization within 
[ADDRESS_939584] also be reported, including details of birth, the presence or absence of 
birth defects, congenital abnor malities or maternal and newborn complications, or whether 
termination was spontaneous or voluntary. 
9.10.4. Overdose  
An overdose is defined as a dose greater than the dose level evaluated in this study as described 
in Section 5. An overdose itself is not an AE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses must be reported regardless of sequelae. 
However, if the  overdose results in clinical signs and symptoms, it requires an expedited 
reporting as if it is an SAE. In the case of a symptomatic overdose, the Investigator should use clinical judgment in treating the overdose and should inform the Sponsor immediately. The 
Investigators should refer to the relevant documents for detailed information regarding warnings, 
precautions, contraindications, AEs, and other significant data pertaining to the study drugs used in the study. Such document(s) may include, but not limited to, the IB for ALIS and approved 
product labeling for ARIKAYCE, or approved product labeling for azithromycin and 
ethambutol.  
9.11. Follow -up of Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follo w-up (as defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). If the 
Investigator receives a report of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been 
discharged from the study, and the Investigator considers the event to be reasonably related to the study drugs or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.  
9.12. Regulatory Aspects  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify the FDA, National Competent Authorities and Central Ethics Committees of the European Union, and any other foreign regulatory competent 
agency, as well as all sites, about the safety of the drug. The Investigator has the responsibility to 
notify the local EC abo ut S[LOCATION_003]Rs.

Clinical Trial Protocol INS -[ADDRESS_939585] a domain specification that fits the data acceptably 
well. (Serrano and Iaconangelo, 2019; Serrano and Iaconangelo, 2017)   The model fit statistic for 
which power was computed is the RMSEA. The RMSEA is the primary fit index used in modern 
psychometric methods for determining the optimal domain structure. This fit assessment is the 
logical test to power, as the modern psychometric methods require the largest sample sizes of all validation analyses. Therefore, adequately powering modern psychometric methods is key to 
validation study success. In addition, the precision of all validation analyses subsequent to 
modern psychometr ic methods rely on correct domain specification, which itself relies on the 
RMSEA. 
 
For a 10-item questionnaire, approximately n=[ADDRESS_939586] meaningful change in this

Inputs to the power analysis simulations were obtained from the MAC subset of the ALIS treated 
subjects in Insmed Study TR02-112, and simulation conditions considered reflected conservative 
variation around observed es timates (larger dispersion and smaller magnitudes of effect). The

 following conditions were used to compute power: magnitudes of effect in change from baseline 
(6pt, 7pt, 8pt, 9pt, and 12pt change from baseline in converters, and 3 point change from baseline in non-converters); culture converter proportions (50%, 60%, and 70%); proportion data missing 
at random (MAR, 0%, 5%, 20%, 25%, and 30%); and sample size (n=100, n=120, and n=130). 
The polyserial correlation between simulated change from baseline in QO L-B respi[INVESTIGATOR_692731] 0.47, ranging from 0.3 to 
0.6. Within each unique simulation condition r=[ADDRESS_939587] conducted at α=0.05, then power was 90%. 
A total sample size of 100 subjects ([ADDRESS_939588] per treatment arm) will provide at least 80% 
power for detecting [ADDRESS_939589] treatment between subjects achiev ing culture conversion during the study and those who did 
not via ANOVA testing. This derivation assumes 50%, 60%, or 70% culture conversion rate, at 
least 40% polyserial correlation between culture conversion and QOL- B respi[INVESTIGATOR_692732], and missing data of 0%, 5%, or 20%. 
10.2. Analysis Sets 
10.2.1. Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set  
The ITT analysis set comprises all subjects who were randomized. This set will be analyzed 
using the treatment to which the subject was randomized.  
10.2.2. Safety Analysis Set 
The safety analysis set comprises all subjects who were randomized and received at least [ADDRESS_939590] -treatment visits;

Majo r protocol deviation will be summarized.  
Assessments collected exclusively prior to therapy will be listed and summarized as appropriate 
(including data for FEV

10.5.2. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is psychometric validation of PRO inst ruments.  
Psychometric validation will consist of cross -sectional and longitudinal validation analyses. At 
Baseline, cross-sectional validation will consist of modern psychometric methods (exploratory 
factor analysis, item response theory models and corresponding assessments of local dependence and differential item functioning),  internal consistency, concurrent validity, and known-groups 
validity.  Longitudinal validation analyses conducted between Screening and Baseline will 
consist of test -retest reliabil ity. The test -retest reliability population will consist of subjects 
reporting no change on PGI- S (respi[INVESTIGATOR_692734] -B and fatigue for PROMIS F -SF 7a) 
between Screening and Baseline. Longitudinal validation analyses conducted between Baseline and EOS (Mo nth 7) will consist of the estimation of within -subject meaningful change. The 
within -subject meaningful change anchor definition will be derived from the change in PGI- S 
anchors (respi[INVESTIGATOR_692734] -B and fatigue for PROMIS F -SF 7a) between Baseline and E OS. 
In addition, culture converter status will be used as an additional anchor variable. Point estimates of within -subject meaningful change will consist of the mean change score conditioned on the 
PGI-S anchor definition. In addition, the median estimate will be examined in sensitivity 
analyses. Point estimates will be validated through the use of eCDFs and ePDFs.

 10.5.3. Cross-sectional Validation 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modern Psychometric Methods  
Evidence associated with these methods will be estimated at baseline. The main function o f the 
modern psychometric methods employed will be the detection of any demonstrably irrelevant, 
redundant, or biased items. Full- information EFA and IRT models will be estimated in the 
service of this goal. Irrelevant items will be identified by [CONTACT_692803] (EFA) and slopes (IRT) approaching zero. Redundant items will be identified by [CONTACT_692804]. Biased items will be detected through DIF assessments, including effect -size estimates to discriminate 
between statistically significant but meaningless DIF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Internal Consistency  
Internal consistency will be estimated at baseline via Cronbach’s α and McDonald’s ω, the latter being the unbiased model- based analog of α. Whereas α assumes item exchangeability, ω does 
not. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Concurrent Validity  
Concurr ent validity will be estimated based on Pearson correlations for scores between the 
QOL -B respi[INVESTIGATOR_692705] F-SF 7a and the following concurrent validators: 
EXACT and EXACT RS, SGRQ, and FACIT -Fatigue.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Known -Groups Validation  
Known -groups vali dity
  will be estimated at baseline only. Known -groups validators will consist 
of the PGI-S (both respi[INVESTIGATOR_692735]- B respi[INVESTIGATOR_692736] F -SF7a , 
respectively) and a median split on reported ppFEV 1. Known-groups validity will be estimated 
by [CONTACT_6486] a linear model to the PRO score(s) at baseline and contrasting marginal means 
LSMEANS across known -group validator levels. Known-groups contrasts will consist of 
comparing the low- severity PGI- S group (reference) against all other PGI- S groups (effect) and 
the ppFEV 1 < median group (reference) against the ppFEV 1 > median group (effect) in pairwise 
contrasts.  
10.5.4. Lon gitudinal Validation  
Longitudinal validation will consist of both test- retest reliability (conducted pre -exposure 
between screening and baseline) and within-subject meaningful change (conducted between 
baseline and EOS (Month 7). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Test-retest Reliability  
Test-retest reliability correlations will be based on the [ADDRESS_939592] random ICC ( Shrout and Fleiss, 
1979). Test -retest reliability estimates of 0.[ADDRESS_939593] sample will be defined among subjects

 experiencing no change on the PGI- S between Baseline and follow -up (PGI- S change score is 
zero). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Within -Subject Meaningful Change  
Meaningful within -subject change will be estimated via change scores computed between 
Baseline and EOS (Month 7). Meaningful within-subject change will be characterized via point 
estimates obtained from the mean and median change score associated with the minimal 
improvement anchor group. 
The point estimates will be examined by [CONTACT_692805] -S 
change and culture conversion anchor groups. The separation of eCDFs and ePDFs at the 
meaningful change point estimates will be contrasted to assess separation between the minimal 
improvement and no- change anchor groups.  
10.5.5. Item -level Validation  
Item-level analogs of the analyses outlined above will also be conducted to provide a 
comprehensive set of validation evidence for FDA review.  
10.6. Other Efficacy Analyses 
10.6.1. Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses 
Summaries of efficacy data will be presented by [CONTACT_35080], as appropriate.  
Reporting of categorial secondary endpoints will include basic statistics, estimates derived via 
logistic regression and will include estimates of proportions, and difference of proportions, 
together with corresponding 95% CIs resulting, as appropriate. 
Reporting of continuous secondary endpoints will include basic s tatistics, estimates derived from 
ANCOVA model with change from baseline as response variable and treatment and baseline as 
independent variables, and will include estimates with corresponding 95% CIs as appropriate.  
ANCOVA and logistic regression models may not include adjustment for randomization strata 
due to expected small counts within each combination of strata.  
Time to culture conversion will be plotted via Kaplan -Meier method.  
10.6.2. Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
All of the summaries pertaining to exploratory endpoints will utilize available data, unless 
otherwise stated in the SAP. Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_35080], as 
appropriate.  
Difference between treatment groups in change from baseline to Month 7 in the QOL-B non-
respi[INVESTIGATOR_692737] (physical, role, vitality, emotional, social, health perception) will be 
summarized. The data will be reported by [CONTACT_692806]. Summary

 Any loss or unanticipated destruction of samples (eg, freezer malfunction) or data (eg, loss of a 
data sheet with individually identifiable information) that violates or compromises  the scientific 
integrity of study data must be reported to the Sponsor and the IRB/EC. 
At any time, subjects may inform the Investigator that they do not wish to have their samples 
stored beyond the completion (termination) of the study. In this case, the Investigator will 
request that all known remaining samples be destroyed and report the disposition of samples to 
the requesting subjects and the IRB/EC. 
13.5. Disposition of Stored Samples and Data  
Access to stored samples will be limited by [CONTACT_2329] a locked room . Samples stored by [CONTACT_692817]’s study identification information. Data will be kept 
in password-protected computers at the laboratory and then transferred to the vendor for data analysis. Samples and corresponding data acquired will be tracked using the laboratory’s 
specimen tracking system.  
In the future, other Investigators may wish to study these samples and/or data. In that case, 
IRB/EC approval and Sponsor approval must be obtained before any sharing of samples and/or 
data. Any clinical information shared about the sample would similarly require prior Sponsor and 
IRB/EC approval. 
Any loss or unanticipated destruction of samples (eg, due to freezer malfunction) or data (eg, 
loss of a data sheet with individ ually identifiable information) that results in a violation that 
compromises the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study will be reported to the 
Sponsor and the IRB/EC. 
Additionally, subjects may decide at any point not to have their samples stored for a period of up 
to [ADDRESS_939598] and to the IRB/EC. This 
decision will not affect the subject’s participation in this protocol.  
13.6. Initiation of Study  
Before the start of the study at each study site, the Sponsor’s study monitor (or designee) will ensure adequacy of the facilities and to discuss responsibilities regarding study protocol 
adherence with the Investigator and other personnel involved in the study. 
The Investigator may not enroll any subject into the study before the Sponsor has received 
written approval or a favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_692742] a 
formal meeting has been conducted by [CONTACT_1034]’s study monitor (or designee) to initiate the study. This meeting will include a detailed review of the study plan and completion of the eCRF.

caused by [CONTACT_692820] r equirement(s).  
13.8. Subject Identification and Confidentiality  
Subject names will not be supplied to the Sponsor. A subject number will be recorded in the eCRF, and if the subject name [CONTACT_75502] (eg, laboratory report), it must be obliterate d on the copy of the document to be supplied to the Sponsor. All records will be kept 
confidential to the extent provided by [CONTACT_1032], state, and local laws. Subjects will be informed that representatives of the Sponsor, IRB/EC, or regulatory authorities ma y inspect their medical 
records to verify the information collected, and that all personal information made available for 
inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in accordance with local data protection 
laws.  
The Investigator will maintain a  personal subject identification list (subject numbers with the 
corresponding subject names) to enable records to be identified. 
13.9. Study Monitoring  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an Investigator’s meeting, a Sponsor 
representative will review the protocol, eCRF, IB, and any study related materials with the 
Investigators and their staff. During the study, the Study Monitor or a designee will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of subject records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, 
adherence to the protocol, adherence to ICH GCP and applicable regulatory requirements, the 
progress of enrollment, and also to ensure that study drugs are  being stored, dispensed, and 
accounted for according to specifications.  
The Investig ator must give the Study Monitor access to relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692743]. No information in these records about the identity of the subjects will leave the study center. The monitoring standards of the study require 
full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, documentation of SAEs, and the recording of primary activity and safety variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the eCRFs are performed according 
to the study specific monitoring plan. 
13.10. Protocol Amendments  
Any substantial change or addition to this protocol requires a written protocol amendment that must be approved by [CONTACT_1034], before implementation. Am endments significantly affecting 
the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study, require 
additional approval by [CONTACT_298915](ies) and IRBs/ECs. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_692744]. 
The requirements for approval should in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken 
by [CONTACT_692821]. If an immediate change to the protocol is felt to be necessary by [CONTACT_49248]/her for safety reasons, the Sponsor or its agent should be 
notified and the applicable regulatory authority(ies)/IRBs/ECs should be info rmed within [ADDRESS_939600] be adhered to.

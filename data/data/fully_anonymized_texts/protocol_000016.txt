 2 CLINICAL INVESTIGATI ONAL PLAN SYNOPSIS  
TITLE  Observational evaluation of  the DyeVert ™ Plus System  
PROTOCOL 
NUMBER  TP-[ADDRESS_680110] Reduction  System ( Model Numbers: CMW -XX and XVOFF -XXX)  
which consists of a Contrast Monitoring Wireless Display (CMW) and the DyeVert Plus Disposable Kit which is inclusive of a disposable single -use 
sterile Smart Syringe and DyeVert Plus Module .  
PURPOSE  The purpose of this post -market  observational  study i s to evaluate the 
DyeVert™ Plus System during standard  clinical use and to quantify contrast 
media (CM) volume saved during manual injections in coronary angiography

STUDY OBJECTIVES  1. Evaluate the volume  (percentage)  of CM  saved  over the total procedure, 
performed with manual injections  
2. Assessment of incidence of Serious Adverse Device Effect  
STUDY DESIGN  This is a prospective , single arm , multi -center, observational  clinical study of 
the DyeVert  Plus System.  
SUBJECT POPULATION  Subjects undergoing a coronary artery imaging (angiogram) for diagnostic 
and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures are eligible to 
participate in this study.  
TREATMENT

coronary diagnostic imaging and/ or PCI procedure conducted with the 
DyeVertTM Plus System.  
CLINICAL SITES  This observational study will be conducted at  up to 15  center s.

 6 DATA AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT 
6.1 Study Data Collection 
6.1.1 Study Data Requirements 
To ensure data quality and comp leteness, all re quired data will  be recorded within an electronic 
database (EDC) provided by [CONTACT_524376]. 
6.[ADDRESS_680114] ing to the protocol, applicable  laws/regulations, or any study 
agreements (i.e. Clinical Trial Agreement or Investigator Agree ment). 
Protocol Deviations will be docum ented on the Protocol Deviatio n eCRF. Protocol deviations are 
reportable to the Institution’s g overning Institutional Review Board (IRB) during the annual 
reporting process, unless otherwise directed by [CONTACT_524377] I RB requirements or as the specific 
circumstance dictates. 
6.3 Investigator Certification 
Osprey Medical certifies that the investigator will fully execu te the Osprey Medical Investigator 
Agreement for this DyeVert Plus Trial.  
6.4 User Training 
Physician investigators will be specialists in interventional c ardiology.  Primary users using the 
DyeVert Plus System will undergo training on set-up and use of the system. Auxiliary personnel, 
such as catheter laboratory techni cians, may also be trained in  system use. The training will include 
on-site training, but may also be supplemented with additional training. Training materials such as 
IFU and training presentations w ill be provided. All training w ill be conducted by [CONTACT_524378]/or Osprey Medical-designated representative s.  If primary users have extensive 
use of the DyeVert product, train ing may be tailored to represe nt need-based training.

fixed null hypothesis. The null and alternative hypothesis to b e tested is: 
Ho: 𝜇ௗ௜௩௘௥௧௘ௗ൑ 30%   
Ha: 𝜇ௗ௜௩௘௥௧௘ௗ൐ 30%  
where μ diverted  is the mean percentage measure d volume saved. Successful rejec tion of the null 
hypothesis will demonstrate that  the percentage of volume saved  is statistically greater than 30%.

Document Number: TP-[ADDRESS_680116] for procedure type (PCI vs di agnostic). An additional analysis 
adjusting for physician will al so be employed if deemed appropr iate based on number of physicians 
and number of cases per physician.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_680117]  35%. Based on a sample size of 100 
subjects and a one-sided 0.025 alpha level, greater than 80% po wer will be provided for a standard 
deviation of 16. A larger mean o r smaller standard deviation wo uld provide additional power.  
To account for the possibility of unavailable contrast savings data or incorrect usage of the device, 
a 15% attrition rate will be utili zed. A total of 118 subjects will be enrolled to obtain approximately 
100 evaluable subjects.  The following instances indicate subje cts deemed unevaluable for the 
primary analysis. 
 The DyeVert Reservoir was inadve rtently turned off due to user error for > 1 injection. 
 The DyeVert Reservoir was turned  OFF for >1 injection due to an  adverse event, not 
related to the device. 
 The CMW did not provide contrast accounting details at the end of a case due to device 
deficiency.  
 A contrast accounting error due to user error occurs for > 1 in jection as defined in the 
procedure case report form.  
 The treating physician determines that a blue tooth disconnecti on occurred resulting in 
inaccurate contrast accounting.  
7.2 Subgroup Analyses  
A subgroup analysis of the prima ry endpoint will be performed b ased on access approach (radial 
versus femoral), body mass inde x (BMI), physician user and proc edure type.  For BMI, subgroups 
will be defined those with BMI < 30 kg/m2 versus those ≥ 30 kg/m2. A two-sample t test will be 
performed to compare the primary endpoint between groups at the  nominal 0.[ADDRESS_680118] deviation, median, inter-
quartile range, or percentages, numbers of patients with events , etc. and the associated 95% 
confidence intervals, as appropriate.

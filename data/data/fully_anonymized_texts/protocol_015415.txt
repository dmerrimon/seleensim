A.  SPECIFIC AIMS   
The overall objective of this prospective surveillance and controlled intervention study is to test 
the hypotheses that (1) low long-chain omega-3 (LC n-3) fatty acid status increases risk for 
adverse cardiometabolic effects and weight gain in adolescent bipolar patients treated with 
second generation antipsychotic (SGA) medications by [CONTACT_25764]-regulating stearoyl-CoA desaturase-
1 (SCD1), a lipogenic enzyme implicated in triglyceride biosynthesis, metabolic syndrome, and 
obesity, and (2) that increasing LC n-[ADDRESS_538492] the onset and progression of adverse cardiometabolic effects and weight gain 
in SGA-treated patients by [CONTACT_426213]1 expression/activity. 
SPECIFIC AIM 1:  
To prospectively evaluate low LC n-3 fatty acid status as a risk factor for adverse 
cardiometabolic effects and weight gain in SGA-treated adolescent manic patients. Prediction 1: 
Low baseline RBC EPA+DHA levels will be associated with greater baseline-endpoint increases 
in BMI and triglyceride levels following acute (6-week) SGA treatment compared with high RBC 
EPA+DHA levels. Prediction 2: Baseline SCD1 expression/activity will increase significantly 
following 6-week SGA treatment. Prediction 3: The relationship between RBC EPA+DHA levels 
and SGA-induced elevations in BMI and triglyceride levels is mediated by [CONTACT_426214]1 
expression/activity. 
SPECIFIC AIM 2:  
To prospectively evaluate the protective effects of increasing LC n-3 fatty acid status on the 
progression of adverse cardiometabolic effects and weight gain in SGA-treated adolescent 
manic patients. Prediction 4: LC n-3 fatty acid supplementation will be more effective than 
placebo for decreasing BMI and triglyceride levels in SGA-treated patients. Prediction 5: 
Reductions in BMI and triglyceride levels following LC n-3 fatty acid supplementation will be 
associated with reductions in SCD1 expression/activity and elevations in RBC EPA+DHA levels. 
Prediction 6: LC n-3 fatty acid supplementation will be more effective than placebo for improving 
SGA safety, tolerability, and efficacy.

 B.  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Bipolar disorder is a common psychiatric illness that is characterized by [CONTACT_313402][INVESTIGATOR_206115], as well as inter-epi[INVESTIGATOR_426159].71 In the United 
States (US), the life-time prevalence rates are 1.0% for bipolar I disorder (BD-I), 1.1% for BD-II, 
and 2.4% for subthreshold BD (4.4% total).[ADDRESS_538493] reported that 55%–75% of adult BD-I 
patients are overweight or obese, a rate that is approximately double the US national average 
(~30%).4,8,76-[ADDRESS_538494] obesity, 
metabolic syndrome, hypertension, sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, type II diabetes, and 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adulthood.81-88 Indeed, standardized mortality rates due 
to cardiovascular and circulatory disease in bipolar patients are approximately twice the age-
adjusted population norms.10,11 Health care costs for cardiometabolic conditions associated with 
obesity are over twice as high in bipolar patients compared with the general population.89 
Accordingly, there is an urgent and currently unmet need to identify modifiable risk and 
protective factors for metabolic disorder, obesity, and associated cardiovascular risk in patients 
with bipolar disorder.  
 
Second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medications, including quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
and risperidone, have been shown to be efficacious for the rapid treatment of acute manic and 
psychotic symptoms in pediatric and adolescent patients in controlled trials.16 These SGA 
medications are currently approved by [CONTACT_426215].17 The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) 
endorses the use of SGA medications as optimal first-line agents for the treatment of acute 
mania, and recommend 12-24 months of maintenance therapy for the treatment of acute 
mania.18,19 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_426160] a 6-fold increase in SGA 
prescription rates in pediatric and adolescent (<18 years of age) patients in US office-based 
medical practice during the past decade.20-[ADDRESS_538495]-
epi[INVESTIGATOR_426161].23-27 Our group reported that the prevalence of 
overweight among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426162].90 Another study found that more than 70% of youth exhibited 
significant weight gain after [ADDRESS_538496] 
circumference, and BMI after 4 week exposure, and these parameters as well as triglyceride 
levels continued to increase at 8 and 12 weeks.23  Our group similarly found that 8-week double 
blind treatment with the SGA quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_426163] (ages 12-17 years) bipolar patients 
resulted in a significantly greater increase in weight gain and fasting triglyceride levels 
compared with placebo.[ADDRESS_538497] 
that exposure to SGA  medications precipi[INVESTIGATOR_426164] a large 
subset of pediatric and adolescent patients with bipolar disorder. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_426165],92 the majority of youth starting SGA medications do not receive recommended

 regular glucose or lipid screening/monitoring in clinical practice.93 Together, these data highlight 
an urgent and unmet met need to identify modifiable risk and protective factors for SGA-induced 
adverse cardiometabolic effects and weight gain to guide ameliorative and preventative 
strategies. 
 
The principal long-chain omega-3 (LC n-3) fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 
20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3), can only be obtained through the diet, and 
membrane EPA+DHA composition modulates cellular signaling pathways involved in the 
regulation of lipid and metabolic homeostasis.[ADDRESS_538498] circumference, 
overweight and obesity,36-40 elevated fasting triglyceride levels,41-43 and elevated C-reactive 
protein (CRP) levels.44-48 Increasing LC n-3 fatty acid status is efficacious for lowering elevated 
triglyceride levels,42 and Lovaza (EPA+DHA, [COMPANY_004]) is currently approved by [CONTACT_426216] ( 500 mg/dl). Increasing LC n-3 fatty acid intake is 
thought to decrease triglyceride levels by [CONTACT_426217].161-163 
Moreover, there is now a substantial body of evidence implicating low LC n-3 fatty acid 
status,95,96 as well as elevated triglyceride levels,97-99 as risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity 
and mortality. Consistent with the storage of excess triglycerides in peripheral fat stores (i.e., 
adipocytes), a growing number of rodent studies have also found that increasing LC n-[ADDRESS_538499] observed reductions in 
total fat mass, subcutaneous adipocyte diameter, and BMI in adult overweight or obese patients 
following LC n-3 fatty acid supplmentation.164-166 Extant translational evidence therefore supports 
the proposition that low LC n-3 fatty acid status represents a candidate risk factor for 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_426166].  
 
Red blood cell (RBC) membrane EPA+DHA composition represents a reliable index of 
habitual (1-2 months) dietary EPA+DHA intake and ‘omega-3 status’,[ADDRESS_538500] RBC EPA+DHA deficits compared with healthy adults.101 The latter finding is consistent 
with prior case-control studies also finding that adult patients with bipolar disorder exhibit 
significantly lower RBC EPA+DHA levels relative to healthy adults.102,[ADDRESS_538501] RBC EPA+DHA deficits compared with healthy adolescents (Section a.6.1). Moreover, 
dietary supplementation with EPA+DHA (fish oil) significantly increases RBC EPA+DHA levels 
in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder in association with significant reductions in 
manic and depressive symptom severity.104,[ADDRESS_538502] also obtained preliminary evidence that 
12-week dietary supplementation with EPA+DHA (OmegaRx) significantly increases RBC 
EPA+DHA composition from in adolescent patients. Additionally, a preliminary open-label study 
found that 4-week EPA+DHA treatment significantly decreased elevated fasting triglyceride 
levels in schizophrenic patients treated with the SGA clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050].106 Adjunctive LC n-3 fatty acid 
supplementation was also found to accelerate treatment response, improve tolerability, and 
permit a 20% reduction in SGA dose in first-epi[INVESTIGATOR_426167],[ADDRESS_538503] 
additional benefits for improving mood symptoms, tolerability, and adherence. 
 
While the mechanisms mediating SGA-induced adverse cardiometabolic effects are poorly 
                                                                                                                               PI: [INVESTIGATOR_426158], Robert K.

 understood,109 recent evidence from in vitro, rodent, and clinical studies indicate that different 
SGA medications up-regulate the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 ( SCD1, delta9-
desaturase),65-[ADDRESS_538504]-precursor ratio of oleic acid to stearic acid 
(18:1/18:0), an index of SCD1 activity (the ‘desaturation index’), is positively correlated with 
human liver biopsy SCD1 mRNA expression,[ADDRESS_538505] is positively correlated with plasma triglyceride levels.53 Additionally, we found 
that normalization of LC n-3 fatty acid status through dietary supplementation normalized 
elevated liver SCD1 mRNA expression and plasma triglyceride levels. These data are 
consistent with prior findings that dietary LC n-3 fatty acid supplementation decrease SCD1 
activity in liver microsomes ex vivo111 and reduce liver triglyceride synthesis and/or secretion in 
different rodent models.112-[ADDRESS_538506] recently obtained proof-of-concept evidence that dietary-induced 
EPA+DHA deficits robustly augment SGA-induced elevations in rat liver SCD1 
expression/activity and liver and plasma triglyceride levels in rats maintained on standard 
diets.[ADDRESS_538507] opposing effects on SCD1 expression/activity which may account for their opposing effects 
on triglyceride biosynthesis and weight gain.  
 
C.  PRELIMINARY STUDIES 
C.1. First-epi[INVESTIGATOR_426168]-naïve manic youth exhibit LC n-[ADDRESS_538508]-epi[INVESTIGATOR_426169]/adolescent (10-18 yrs) manic 
patients (n=30, 15.2±1.6 years) exhibit RBC EPA+DHA levels that are significantly lower than 
those observed in age-matched healthy adolescents (n=30)(2.9±0.8 vs. 4.2±1.3 wt% total, 
p=0.0002). Importantly, 91% of first-epi[INVESTIGATOR_426170] ‘omega-3 index’ 
(EPA+DHA) of 4.0% compared with 25% of healthy controls ( 2 p=0.001). Based on 
prospective observational studies finding that an omega-3 index of 4.0% confers a 10-fold 
greater risk for primary cardiac arrest compared with an omega-3 index of >8.0%,[ADDRESS_538509]-epi[INVESTIGATOR_426171]. Moreover, the RBC EPA+DHA levels observed in first-
epi[INVESTIGATOR_426169]/adolescent manic patients (2.9±0.8%) is similar to that previously observed in 
adult patients suffering acute coronary syndrome (3.4±1.6%),124 as well as adolescents at ultra-
high-risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_322796] (3.1±1.2%).[ADDRESS_538510]-
                                                                                                                               PI: [INVESTIGATOR_426158], Robert K.

 epi[INVESTIGATOR_426172] (24.8±0.9 kg/m2) did not differ significantly from healthy 
pediatric/adolescent controls (24.0±1.0 kg/m2)(p=0.67), a finding consistent with prior 
prospective trials.23 This finding suggests that LC n-3 fatty acid deficiency alone is not sufficient 
to induce weight gain, but rather, increases risk for greater weight gain in response to a 
metabolic challenge (i.e., SGA-induced lipogenesis).  
 
C.2. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation increases RBC EPA+DHA levels in adolescent 
patients. While the etiological factors contributing to LC n-3 fatty acid deficiency observed in 
bipolar youth are poorly understood and likely multifactorial, dietary EPA+DHA insufficiency 
plays a key role.[ADDRESS_538511] found that pediatric and adolescent bipolar patients 
consume less preformed EPA+DHA in their diet compared with healthy controls,127 and that 
dietary EPA+DHA (fish oil) supplementation significantly increases RBC EPA+DHA composition 
in bipolar youth.104,105 In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_426173] (n=30, 15.2±3.5 years), 
we found that 12-week open-label EPA+DHA (OmegaRx) supplementation (2.4 g/d) significantly 
increased RBC EPA+DHA composition from 3.1 0.3% at baseline to 7.5 1.2% at study 
endpoint (+49%, p<0.0001). Based on prospective observational studies, the level of EPA+DHA 
observed in these patients following 12-week EPA+DHA treatment would confer a ~10-fold 
reduced risk for primary cardiac arrest compared with their baseline values.123 Consistent with 
prior studies,104,128 we found that baseline depressive (CDRS) symptom severity scores (primary 
outcome measure) declined significantly following 12-week EPA+DHA supplementation (-18%, 
p=0.01). Importantly, in this and other LC n-3 fatty acid supplementation trials conducted in 
children and adolescents,104,105,128 adverse events (predominantly gastrointestinal-related) were 
few and rated as mild by [CONTACT_1962]. Together, these preliminary findings suggest that dietary 
EPA+DHA supplementation is efficacious and well-tolerated for increasing LC n-[ADDRESS_538512] opposing effects on SCD1 mRNA expression in rat 
liver. As discussed above, emerging evidence suggests that stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 ( SCD1) 
is required for de novo triglyceride synthesis,54,56,[ADDRESS_538513] been investigating 
the effects of dietary-induced LC n-3 fatty acid deficiency, as well as subsequent repletion, on 
young adult rat liver SCD1 mRNA expression and activity indices (liver 16:1/16:0 & 18:1/18:0 
ratios), and determined relationships with postprandial plasma triglyceride levels. Compared 
with controls, rats fed the omega-3-deficient diet exhibited significantly lower RBC and liver 
EPA+DHA compositions, which were highly correlated, and both were normalized in repleted 
rats. Liver SCD1 mRNA expression (+82%, p=0.001) and activity indices (18:1/18:0: +60%, 
p<0.0001; 16:1/16:0: +75%, p<0.0001) were significantly greater in omega-3 deficient rats 
compared with controls. Consistent with a prior human liver biopsy study,110 liver SCD1 mRNA 
expression was positively correlated with liver 18:1/18:0 ( r = +0.90, p≤0.0001) and 16:1/16:0 ( r = 
+0.93, p≤0.0001) ratios, supporting the validity of these measures as indices of SCD1 activity.54 
Plasma triglyceride levels were significantly greater in omega-3 fatty acid deficient rats 
compared with controls (+30%, p=0.02), and liver SCD1 mRNA expression and activity indices 
were positively correlated with plasma triglyceride levels. Importantly, normalization of omega-[ADDRESS_538514] relevance to the current proposal, we recently reported that dietary-induced 
EPA+DHA deficits robustly augment risperidone-induced elevations in rat liver SCD1

for developi[INVESTIGATOR_426175] (i.e., have a mood disorder diagnoses other than bipolar I 
disorder and a first-degree relative with bipolar I disorder).129 In a subsequent double-blind 
placebo-controlled 8-week trial in adolescents (ages 12-17 years) with bipolar disorder, we 
observed a statistically significant between-group difference in baseline-endpoint change in 
fasting triglyceride levels (mean change in quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]: +30 mg/dL vs. placebo: +14 mg/dL, 
p=0.003), and that a greater number of subjects in the quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_179415] (24%) than in the 
placebo group (0%) exhibited a shift from normal to abnormal triglyceride levels. Subjects in the 
quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_426176] (mean increase: 2.3 kg) than those in the placebo 
group (0.9 kg), and the increase in BMI was greater for the quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_179415] (mean increase: 
0.9 kg/m2) than the placebo group (0.3 kg/m2).[ADDRESS_538516]. McNamara is Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience,

E. EXPRIMENTAL DESIGN & METHODS 
a. Methods and Procedures 
Study Overview : We are proposing a two-phase study design (see Fig. 1) to first prospectively 
investigate the relationship between baseline LC n-3 fatty acid status and treatment-emergent 
adverse cardiometabolic events and weight gain in response to acute (6-week) quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_426179] (ages 10-17 years)(Phase I, SA1). During Phase II (SA2), patients 
from Phase I will be randomized (stratified by [CONTACT_426218] 30 kg/m2) to double-blind adjunctive 
treatment with LC n-3 fatty acids or placebo for an additional 24 weeks to investigate protective 
effects on the progression and resolution of adverse cardiometabolic events and weight gain 
during quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_426180]. Patients will be recruited from the inpatient psychiatric 
units and outpatient clinics at Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29349] (CCHMC). The 
attending physicians and then the legal guardians of adolescents with a manic or mixed mood 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_426181] a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, type I, will be approached by [CONTACT_426219]. Once permission is obtained from their inpatient 
psychiatrist and legal guardians, adolescents will be approached about study participation. If 
agreeable, research staff will obtain written informed consent and assent for study participation 
from the legal guardian and adolescent, respectively. Patients will be discharged from 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426182] 
(typi[INVESTIGATOR_55225] 7 days).  Following initiation of double blind treatment, patients will have regularly 
scheduled visits at which time metabolic parameters (i.e., lipid profile, glucose, insulin), 
anthropomorphic measures (i.e., BMI), and mood symptom ratings (CDRS, YMRS) will be 
obtained. Primary outcome measures for both study Phases are BMI and fasting triglyceride 
levels. Following the completion of the 24-week Phase II study procedures (or early 
termination), patients will transition care to a community clinician so that there is no lapse in 
treatment. Patients will be recruited from the inpatient units and less commonly outpatient clinics 
affiliated with University and Cincinnati Children’s Medical Center Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Our program, the 
Division of Bipolar Disorders Research, has successfully recruited hundreds of patients from 
these units during the past [ADDRESS_538521] in the department of Psychiatry, Division of Bipolar Disorders

 significant weight gain of 7% from baseline, waist circumference (measured at the level of both 
superior iliac crests and umbilicus, using the point of largest abdominal circumference), and 
sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Fasting (>8 hour) venous blood (approximately 15 
cc) will be collected for determination of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides), glucose, insulin, TSH, 
adiponectin, leptin, and hsCRP. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance will 
be calculated [HOMA-IR: fasting insulin umol × glucose mmol/22.5]. White blood cells 
(lymphocytes, leukocytes, myeloid cells) will be isolated from whole blood to measure gene 
expression (i.e., SCD1 mRNA) by [CONTACT_426220].53,67,160 Red blood cell fatty acid 
composition will be determined as previously described.101,143 
 
Dietary assessments: We will request that subjects maintain their current diet over the course 
of their study participation. During the course of the trial we will obtain 3-day food records at 
scheduled visits to obtain estimates of average total energy intake (kJ/kg/d) and other dietary 
macronutrients (i.e., fat (g/d), carbohydrate (g/d), and protein (g/d). Additionally, the Omega-3 
Dietary Intake Questionnaire, an 11-item scale, will be administered at each Phase II visit to 
specifically assess omega-3 fatty acid intake. The Omega-3 Dietary Intake Questionnaire has 
been validated, and questionnaire scores (mg EPA and mg DHA per day) are positively 
correlated with EPA and DHA status.130 The Addiction Severity Index (ASI)  will also be 
administered to collect data regarding drug use (including nicotine and alcohol) at the Phase I 
baseline visit and at Phase II baseline and endpoint visits. 
 
Mood symptom ratings: Symptom ratings will be obtained using the Young Mania Rating 
Scale (YMRS),131-133 an 11-item scale to assess manic symptoms; the Children’s Depression 
Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R), a 17-item observer-rated questionnaire, to assess depressive 
symptoms.134,135  Subjects will also be rated using the Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale 
(CGI-S), a clinician-rated 7-point scale (1=normal to 7=extremely ill) to assess overall illness 
severity.136 A potential new manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_426184] a YMRS 
score >16, and a depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_426184] a CDRS score 
>24 and YMRS score <10. Per DSM-IV criteria, two weeks of depressive symptoms or one 
week of manic symptoms are required to define a new epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].   
 
Safety and tolerability assessments:  A complete medical and treatment history, vital signs, a 
physical examination, and serum laboratory tests (including a renal profile, complete blood 
count, liver function tests) will be performed at select visits during Phases I and II. Additionally, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be performed at selected visits to assess QTc interval. Adverse 
events will also be assessed at selected visits using a clinical interview as well as a structured 
side effect interview, the Side Effects Form for Children and Adolescents (SEFCA).138 The 
SEFCA measures the frequency and severity of specific cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, central 
nervous system, ocular, mouth and nasal, genitourinary, dermatological, and musculoskeletal 
side effects. Because LC n-3 fatty acid treatment may be associated with increasing bleeding 
time, we added the following four questions to the SEFCA: “Bruising”, “Nosebleeds”, “Longer 
than usual bleeding”, and “Heavy bleeding associated with menstruation”. Additionally, the 
Platelet Function Assay (PFA), a sensitive measure of blood clotting, will be measured at Phase 
II baseline and endpoint. If a study participant answers positively to any of the bleeding items on 
the SEFCA, a PFA will be performed at that point. Patients will be discontinued from study 
participation if their PFA values are outside the reference range (PFA-EPI: 75.0-199.0 and PFA 
ADP: 68.0-112.0) on two consecutive visits and provided with follow-up care. An adverse event 
will be defined as a symptom that was not present at or worsened in severity from baseline. The

TREATMENTS: 
Quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]:  Quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_123111] (Seroquel) is approved by [CONTACT_426221] (ages 10-17 years), and is currently among the most 
frequently prescribed SGA in children and adolescents in outpatients clinics in the US.[ADDRESS_538525] found that 
quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], like other SGA medications, is associated with treatment-emergent elevations in our 
primary outcome measures (i.e., BMI, triglyceride levels) in pediatric and adolescent 
patients.23,91,129,140-142 For the proposed Phase I component, acutely manic patients with limited 
prior SGA exposure ( 3 months) will be treated with quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] 6-weeks. Patients will be 
started on [ADDRESS_538526] subjects in the range of 200-500 
mg. In our prior studies, the mean quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_426185] 400 mg/day.91,[ADDRESS_538527], and we will monitor patient 
compliance by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_426186]/parental reports. During Phase I, every 
effort will be made to achieve an effective, well tolerated, and stable maintenance dose by 
[CONTACT_10585] 6. If patients are unable to tolerate therapeutic doses, they will be removed from the study 
and referred for alternate treatment. While it is anticipated that patients will be maintained on 
this dose during the 24-week double blind component (Phase II), we will permit dose 
adjustments if clinically indicated.

LCn-3 fatty acid supplements:  For the Phase II intervention trial, patients will be randomized 
to EPA+DHA supplements (OmegaRx) or placebo (safflower oil). Safflower oil was selected for 
the placebo because it does not contain omega-3 fatty acids, including -linolenic acid (found in 
olive oil), and to minimally alter the fatty acid composition of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_210308]. All 
capsules will be stored atroom temperature (60-75 ⁰F) , and EPA+DHA content determined upon 
initial receipt and every [ADDRESS_538528]. Placebo and OmegaRx capsules are identical in caloric content (~9 kcal/capsule), 
size, shape, and color to protect the blind. To test the integrity of the study blind, we will ask 
study participants to separately identify their treatment as placebo or omega-[ADDRESS_538529] to complete a 
questionnaire asking to which group (omega-3 fatty acids or placebo) they thought the subject 
                                                                                                                               PI: [INVESTIGATOR_426158], Robert K.  
 
Version Date:August [ADDRESS_538530] previously confirmed that each OmegaRx capsule contains 400 mg EPA and 
200 mg DHA. Subjects will be randomized to OmegaRx or placebo at a fixed dose of 3.0 g/day 
(EPA: 2.0 g, DHA: 1.0 g; 5 capsules/d). This fixed dose was selected based on American Heart 
Association recommendations to consume between 2.0-4.0 g/d for triglyceride reduction in 
individuals with hypertriglycerolaemia,145 controlled dose-response studies finding that similar 
fixed doses (2.0-4.0 g/d) are efficacious in lowering elevated triglyceride levels,42 a one month 
open-label intervention study finding that 3.0 g/day EPA+DHA significantly reduced fasting 
plasma triglyceride levels in patients treated with the SGA clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050],106 and findings that similar 
EPA+DHA doses (1.9-2.6 g/d) are efficacious for reducing manic and depression symptom 
severity in medicated bipolar adolescents.104,105 The US FDA considers EPA+DHA doses up to 
3.0 g/d to be ‘generally regarded as safe’ ( www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/ds-ltr11.html ). Treatment 
adherence will be encouraged at each visit and adherence monitored by [CONTACT_248457], 
capsule counts, legal guardian interviews, and a capsule adherence diary. Subjects with > 50%

b. Data analysis and Data Monitoring:  
Data management and analyses will be organized and performed under the direction of 
[CONTACT_426251], Director of the Division of Biostatistics in the Department of Psychiatry at the 
University of Cincinnati, who has participated in the development of this analytic plan. The 
research coordinator will be responsible for managing study flow, maintaining case report forms, 
                                                                                                                               PI: [INVESTIGATOR_426158], Robert K.  
 
Version Date:August [ADDRESS_538532] protected. Demographic and clinical 
data will be managed in a database using Microsoft Access® and stored in an IBM compatible 
PC connected to other PCs within the Division of Bipolar Disorder Research with a LAN that is 
password protected and coded to meet HIPAA requirements. Backups are performed weekly to 
protect against data loss. 
 
Data Analysis: Demographic and clinical variables (e.g. sex, race, age, baseline BMI, 
quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_67910], dietary energy intake) will be included as covariates in the model in a stepwise 
manner if they are associated with primary outcome measures using a liberal p-value of <0.2. 
We will use independent, 2-tailed t-tests for continuous variables and χ2 tests for categorical 
variables, and adjust for multiple comparisons as appropriate. For the Phase II DBPC 
component, analyses will be performed using data from the intent-to-treat (ITT) sample (all 
subjects receiving at least one dose of omega-3 fatty acid or placebo). All tests of hypotheses 
will be done at the 5% level of significance, unless otherwise specified. Prior to data analysis, 
the distribution of all dependent variables will be examined for normality. We will transform or 
apply alternative statistical models for dependent variables that are not normally distributed.  
Specifications for temporal correlation and random effects will be selected using AIC criterion. 
All analyses will be performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC, 2002) by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Welge.  
 
Prediction 1:  Low baseline RBC EPA+DHA levels will be associated with greater elevations in 
BMI and triglyceride levels in response to acute (6-week) SGA treatment compared with high 
RBC EPA+DHA levels. The relationships between baseline-endpoint change in BMI and 
triglyceride levels and baseline RBC EPA+DHA composition will be evaluated with a linear 
regression model. We will evaluate potential covariates (i.e., baseline BMI) as described above. 
We will also generate odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals to estimate relative risk in 
different quartiles of RBC EPA+DHA composition.  
 
Prediction 2:  Baseline SCD1 expression/activity will increase significantly following 6-week 
SGA treatment. We will use an unpaired  t-test (one-tail) to compare change from baseline to 
week 6 (or endpoint) in SCD1 mRNA expression and SCD1 activity index (plasma 18:1/18:0). 
We will evaluate potential covariates and confounds as described above.  
 
Prediction 3:  The relationship between RBC EPA+DHA levels and SGA-induced elevations in 
BMI and triglyceride levels is mediated by [CONTACT_426214]1 expression/activity. We predict a 
mediated effect in which low RBC EPA+DHA levels are associated with elevated SCD1 mRNA 
expression and SCD1 activity (plasma 18:1/18:0), which in turn increase baseline-endpoint 
change in BMI and triglyceride levels. For the prediction of a mediated effect to be supported, 
two conditions must be met: a significant association between RBC EPA+DHA levels and SGA-
induced elevations in BMI and triglyceride levels (Prediction 1), and a significant association 
between RBC EPA+DHA levels and SCD1 expression/activity (Prediction 2). If there is no 
residual relationship between RBC EPA+DHA levels and weight and metabolic parameters, 
then the relationship between these measures will be inferred to exist solely through the 
mediating effect of SCD1 expression/activity. Path analysis,157 an extension of linear regression 
to systems of simultaneous linear regression equations, will be used to analyze the fit of the 
proposed mediation model. This method allows for the same variable to serve as an 
independent variable in some of the regressions and a dependent variable in others. In this 
analysis, baseline-endpoint changes in BMI and triglyceride levels will serve as the final 
outcome measure, with changes in SCD1 expression/activity as the mediator and RBC 
                                                                                                                               PI: [INVESTIGATOR_426158], Robert K.

 EPA+DHA level as the independent variable. Estimation of path coefficients and bootstrap 
computation of associated significance levels ( =0.05) will be carried out using SAS macros.158 
The relationship between baseline-endpoint change in baseline RBC EPA+DHA composition, 
and baseline-endpoint change in BMI and triglyceride levels will be evaluated with multiple 
regression models.  
 
Prediction 4:  LCn-3 fatty acid supplementation will be more effective than placebo for 
decreasing BMI and triglyceride levels in SGA-treated bipolar patients. A mixed effects model 
repeated measures (MMRM) approach will be used to compare change over time in BMI and 
triglyceride levels between treatment groups (placebo, omega-3). The model will contain terms 
for group (2 levels), time, and group-by-time interaction. Covariates will be included as 
described above. We will also compare treatment group differences in change from baseline to 
endpoint in BMI and triglyceride levels using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). This analysis will 
provide information without the necessary assumptions of the MMRM model regarding missing 
data and fitting the regression.  
 
Prediction 5:  Reductions in BMI and triglyceride levels following LC n-3 fatty acid 
supplementation will be correlated with reductions in SCD1 expression/activity and increases in 
RBC EPA+DHA levels. The relationship between baseline-endpoint change in BMI and 
triglyceride levels and baseline-endpoint change in SCD1 mRNA expression and SCD1 activity 
index (plasma 18:1/18:0) will be evaluated with a simple linear regression model. We will 
evaluate potential covariates and confounds as described above.  
 
Prediction 6:  LCn-3 fatty acid supplementation will be more effective than placebo for 
improving SGA tolerability and efficacy (i.e., lower relapse and discontinuation rates). For 
tolerability, a MMRM approach will be used to compare change over time adverse events 
(SEFCA) and extrapyramidal symptoms (SAS) between treatment groups (placebo, omega-3). 
We will additionally measure the duration of time to exit double-blind treatment because of 
tolerability issues. For efficacy, we will use a MMRM approach to compare change over time in 
mood symptom severity (CDRS, YMRS). We will also compare treatment group differences in 
change from baseline to endpoint in CDRS and YMRS scores using an analysis of variance 
(ANOVA). A Kaplan-Meier with Mantel-Cox log-rank statistic will be used to compare duration of 
remission in the [ADDRESS_538533] (DSMB) and 
monitoring of tolerability data, including adverse events and serious adverse events, by [CONTACT_426223] (IRB). The DSMB will consist of non-study related faculty 
with research related experience and will include a statistician, a psychiatrist with expertise in 
omega-[ADDRESS_538534]. The DSMB will meet a minimum of 
every 6 months during the course of the study and will formally review tolerability, safety and 
efficacy data. Drs. McNamara and Patino will be responsible for providing updated efficacy and 
tolerability data to the DSMB. The DSMB will assess the risks and benefits of study participation 
to all subjects. Based on this assessment the DSMB will provide a written report of their 
analyses and recommendation as to whether the study should continue or modification to the 
study as needed. Drs. McNamara, Patino, and DelBello, in conjunction with the DSMB, will be 
responsible for making certain that the DSMB files their report to the IRB. The DSMB will also

bipolar adolescents (ages 10-17 years)(Total N=94). Patient selection will be done by [CONTACT_75275], in consultation with and with permission from Dr. DelBello and the attending 
physician of that patient. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below.  
 
b. Sample Size  
Up to 100 patients will be enrolled in this study at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center 
over a total of 60 months.  As this is an investigator-initiated protocol, there are no other sites

d. Intended Demographics 
Patients will be adolescents (ages 10-17 years) diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Patients from 
all available ethnic groups will be recruited at rates that reflect the demographics of the 
University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426190]. Consequently, we expect approximately 60% of the 
sample being White, 35% African-American and the remainder from other ethnic backgrounds. 
Because prior treatment with SGA medications would be anticipated to influence our primary 
outcome measures, we will recruit only patients with limited prior SGA exposure. 
 
e. Study population source 
Patients will be recruited from the inpatient units and less commonly, outpatient clinics affiliated 
with University and Cincinnati Children’s Medical Center CCHMC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Dr. DelBello is 
Director of Research Training and Education and Co-Director of the Mood Disorder Clinic at 
CCHMC, which will facilitate recruitment of potential subjects.  
 
f. Recruitment Plans 
Adolescents will be recruited primarily through infrastructure originally established for Dr. 
                                                                                                                               PI: [INVESTIGATOR_426158], Robert K.

 Delbello’s ongoing research study (R01MH080973-PI-Dr. DelBello) investigating the effects of 
6-week quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_426191]. Since the initiation of this 
trial, n=73 patients who would be eligible for participation in the proposed study (i.e., they were 
SGA-naïve and diagnosed with DSM-IV-TR criteria for bipolar disorder, type I, manic or mixed 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) have been randomized (an average of 3 patients per month). This rate of recruitment 
is sufficient to meet the proposed enrollment goals of an average of 2 subjects/month. 
Nevertheless, we will periodically assess our recruitment and retention rates and adjust 
recruitment efforts accordingly.  
 
Specifically, recruitment will be performed by [CONTACT_426229] (inpatient) 
and UC (outpatient) physicians. Inpatients will be identified as potential study candidates by 
[CONTACT_426230].  Physicians of those identified will be asked if they deem 
such inpatients suitable for this research study.  If so, study staff will also ask the same 
physician if it is permissible to approach the inpatient and their family about the research study.  
 
G.  RISK TO SUBJECTS  
a. Level of Risk Description  
Potential risks from study participation include possible risks from treatments, as well as 
other risks associated with any study participation (e.g. loss of confidentiality and fatigue and 
frustration from repeated evaluations). Possible risks of the proposed study design include 
the potential for symptom exacerbation. For the proposed study, all participants will be 
treated with quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_123111] (Seroquel) which is the standard of care. All subjects and 
their legal guardians will be informed about the potential risks associated with quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_426192]/assent process. Quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_426193] 
(ages 10-17 years) and is commonly prescribed for adolescents with bipolar disorder. All 
adolescents will be receiving quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] [ADDRESS_538538] 
treatment for children/adolescents with acute mania.18,19 As with any SGA medication there is 
a risk that quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_426194]-effects, and the principle 
objective of the proposed study is to elucidate risk and protective factors associated with 
SGA-induced adverse cardiometabolic side-effects and weight gain. Additionally,  subjects 
who exhibit worsening of mood symptoms (they have a 9 point increase in CDRS-R score (1 
point increase in > 50% of the 17 CDRS-R items) or a > 6 point increase in YMRS score (1 
point increase in > 50% of the 11 YMRS items) from baseline at any two consecutive visits) 
will be discontinued from study participation. If in the clinical judgment of the study physician 
a patient exhibits increased suicidality from Phase I baseline at any two consecutive visits, 
he/she will be discontinued from study participation. Other adverse events may include 
extrapyramidal symptoms. To minimize this risk, we will permit concomitant medications (e.g. 
propranolol or anticholinergics) for extrapyramidal syndromes that develop. Additionally, all 
subjects and their legal guardians will be informed about the potential risks associated with 
omega-3 fatty acids during the informed consent/assent process. Patients will be informed of 
potential omega-3 fatty acid side-effects including nausea, diarrhea, gastrointestinal reflux, 
and of less common side effects, such as vomiting and increased bleeding time. We will 
routinely monitor for all of these side effects with clinical interviews (i.e., SEFCA), vital signs, 
                                                                                                                               PI: [INVESTIGATOR_426158], Robert K.  
 
Version Date:August [ADDRESS_538539] patients (and 
their legal guardians) to contact [CONTACT_464] 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, if any concerns arise 
during their study participation. Following study discontinuation, study physicians (Drs. 
DelBello and Patino) will provide clinical care to address urgent safety issues and will actively 
facilitate clinical referral for individualized treatment to ensure that there is no lapse in care. 
Alternative medication options will be discussed with the patient and their family if 
discontinuation is necessary.  
In an effort to minimize risks associated with medication interactions, a complete history 
of prior medications will be obtained from the patient and their legal guardian, as well as, 
their treating clinician (after a release of information is obtained) by [CONTACT_426231]. To minimize the potential risk associated with the screening period, patients will 
be monitored by [CONTACT_426232]. Patients will be evaluated in 
person as needed. Additionally, the screening period may be shortened at the discretion of 
the study physician. Patients and their families will have access to a study physician 24 
hours/day, 7 days/week. The screening period is necessary to ensure the accuracy of the 
diagnosis. We have successfully used this approach during the screening period to maximize 
the safety of hundreds of adolescents with disruptive behavior and/or mood disorders in more 
than 20 prior studies. Subjects who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], are in need of inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139760]. 
Nevertheless, The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), will be administered at 
each Phase II visit to measure of suicidality.  
 
 To guard against the side effects of omega-[ADDRESS_538540] is physically healthy. We will then initiate dose titration 
with quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. To maximize safety during the 24-week double blind study phase (Phase II),  
body weight and fasting triglyceride and glucose levels will be obtained at selected visits, and 
a patient will be discontinued from study participation if they meet criteria for clinically-
significant increases in body weight ( 7% from baseline) and/or clinically-significant 
increases in fasting triglyceride ( 450 mg/dL) and/or fasting glucose ( 125 mg/dL) on two 
consecutive visits during study participation. Patients and their legal guardians will also be 
told to contact [CONTACT_426233]; allergic 
reactions like skin rash, itching or hives, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, anxiety, 
nervousness, changes in mood or behavior, chest pain, fast, irregular heartbeat, fever, or 
hot, dry skin, high blood pressure, muscle twitching, or uncontrollable head, mouth, neck, 
arm, or leg movements. Additionally, to minimize the gastrointestinal adverse events 
associated with quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_426195]-[ADDRESS_538541] found that this approach is 
effective and does not reduce compliance as evidenced by [CONTACT_426234]-reports. 
To minimize the side effects of quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], we will encourage patients to take quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_426196]. To minimize the risk of 
other adverse effects from study treatment, at each study visit following baseline, study 
physicians (Drs. DelBello or Patino) will carefully monitor all patients for adverse effects using 
                                                                                                                               PI: [INVESTIGATOR_426158], Robert K.  
 
Version Date:August [ADDRESS_538542] 
added four questions to the SEFCA that are associated with increased bleeding time: 
“Bruising”, “Nosebleeds”, “Longer than usual bleeding”, and “Heavy bleeding associated with 
menstruation”. Additionally, the Platelet Function Assay (PFA), a sensitive measure of blood 
clotting. If a study participant answers positively to any of the bleeding items on the SEFCA, 
a PFA will be performed at any point during study participation. Patients will be discontinued 
from study participation if their PFA values are outside the reference range (PFA-EPI: 75.0-
199.0 and PFA ADP: 68.0-112.0) on two consecutive visits and provided with follow-up care. 
We will advise all participants and their legal guardians about potential anti-coagulant effects 
of omega-[ADDRESS_538543] 
anticoagulant effects (e.g. aspi[INVESTIGATOR_855]-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs). Study 
related adverse events will be defined as a symptom that was not present at or worsened in 
severity or frequency from baseline. Patients also will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_426235]. Moreover, rates of adverse and serious adverse events will be 
monitored by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (see Data and Safety Monitoring Plan) that will 
meet every six months to review study tolerability and efficacy measures and determine 
whether the study should continue.  
 
 Additionally, should the need arise to discontinue a patient from the study because of 
symptom worsening (as defined previously) or for any other reason, including patient/legal 
guardian withdrawal of consent, we will collaborate with the patient, their legal guardian, and 
their non-study related physician to determine treatment options for that patient following study 
discontinuation. At the beginning of each subject’s study participation, we will make appropriate 
referrals for all patients who do not have preexisting clinicians so that follow-up care will be in 
place at the completion of their study participation. If a study participant discontinues study 
participation and is not able to have an immediate appointment with the clinician to whom they 
are being referred, a study related physician, in consultation with their treating clinician or the 
clinician to whom they are being referred, will initiate appropriate treatment for the patient until 
they are seen by a non-study clinician. The study clinician will discuss treatment options with the 
patient (and their legal guardians) as well as discuss whether they would like to continue to take 
quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Nonetheless, following study discontinuation, the study clinician will begin treatment 
as indicated in collaboration with non-study related clinicians if applicable and the study 
participant (and their legal guardian), to maximize the safety of the study participant. Study 
clinicians will manage the care of study participants until appropriate follow-up treatment is in 
place. We have been successfully using this approach to manage patients following study 
participation for more than [ADDRESS_538544] will be required to access computer information, and will be 
available only to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_426197]. Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_63903], and 
the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_426198]: McNamara, Robert K.  
 
Version Date:August [ADDRESS_538545] will be identifiable. Additionally, all study staff will be certified in Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP), which refers to a set of international ethical and scientific quality 
standards for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve human 
subjects. No subject will be identifiable in any publication that should arise from this work. 
Furthermore, collateral persons who are contact[CONTACT_426236] a signed release of information from the legal guardian, and will typi[INVESTIGATOR_426199]’s primary clinician(s). Subjects can withdraw from this study at any time, at which 
point contact [CONTACT_426237]. Subjects will be told that agents of the 
University of Cincinnati Medical Center Institutional Review Board, the National Institutes of 
Health, and the Food and Drug Administration will be allowed to inspect sections of their 
medical and research records related to this study if requested. By [CONTACT_426238].   
 
 We will attempt to minimize the risks associated with reporting of suspected abuse or 
neglect, by [CONTACT_426239]/county agency. All 
suspected abuse or neglect will be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_426200], one of the other 
study physicians, so that the situation can be further investigated by [CONTACT_215132]. 
In addition, should the need for reporting arise, the adolescents and legal guardians will be 
provided with supportive clinical services from the study staff until referrals to appropriate 
agencies are made. Following termination of study participation all patients who do not have 
an existing treating clinician will be given appropriate referrals for treatment. Every effort will 
be made so that all subjects have an appointment with a non-study treating physician prior to 
their last study visit so that a follow-up medication plan can be in place at the end of the 
study. If the appointment does not occur prior to the subject’s study termination visit, and if 
clinically indicated and agreeable to subjects and their legal guardians, subjects will continue 
treatment with their medication and monitored until their follow-up appointment. We have 
used this approach with prior studies and typi[INVESTIGATOR_426201] a child and 
adolescent psychiatrist within one month of termination of study participation.    
 
To protect against potential coercion or undue influence, all study procedures will be 
carefully explained to the subject and the subject's parent/legal guardian by [CONTACT_3647]. 
Research staff will inform patients that it is ok if they do not want to participate in the study 
and that they can stop being in the study at any time. Patient’s will be advised that they can 
take time to think about whether they want to participate in the study and that they can sign 
the assent at a later time. If agreeable research staff will obtain written informed consent and 
assent for study participation from the legal guardian and adolescent, respectively. 
 
 
b. Anticipated Benefit Justifies the Risk -  Potential benefits include a thorough psychiatric 
evaluation and monitoring performed by [CONTACT_426240], and the chance to contribute to a scientific investigation, which 
may be of benefit to patients with similar illnesses in the future. Additionally, study 
participants may also benefit from treatment with the quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (and potentially omega-3 
fatty acid treatment) that they receive free of charge during study participation in that it may 
reduce their mood symptoms. If requested by [CONTACT_426241], 
information obtained from this study will be available to that subject’s primary clinician. 
Overall, the risks associated with this study are minimal to the participants and they may 
                                                                                                                               PI: [INVESTIGATOR_426158], Robert K.  
 
Version Date:August [ADDRESS_538546] benefit from their study participation as previously described. Thus, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_7372], the benefits associated with this study outweigh the risks.  
 
Anticipated Benefit as Favorable as Alternative Approaches  – An alternative to study 
participation is not participating and receiving standard of care treatment as directed by a 
physician of that participant’s choosing.  Since this study proposes standard of care 
treatment, the investigators believe participation is as favorable to participants as that of the 
alternative approach. 
 
H. PAYMENT 
Subjects will be reimbursed $[ADDRESS_538547] COSTS 
Patients are expected to provide for clinical care that is not part of this research protocol (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14051]) through standard health care payment procedures. Subjects will have no 
costs associated with research participation.

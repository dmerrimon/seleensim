INTRODUCTION
Bone conduction hearing systems use the body’s natural ability to transfer sound through bone conduction. 
The bone conduction system pi[INVESTIGATOR_142553](s) (cochlea). A bone conduction system transmits sound directly to the cochlea 
independently of the function of the ear canal and middle ear. Thus, for patients with conductive hearing
losses (CHL) or mixed hearing losses (MHL) , patients with lasting hearing loss following a middle ear disease 
(such as for instance chronic otitis media, cholesteatoma, otosclerosis or other ossicular diseases) or 
malformations (such as aural atresia and/ or microtia), one utilizes that the vibrations are by[CONTACT_142558], stimulating the cochlea directly. For single -sided deaf 
(SSD) Participants , one utilizes that the vibrations are transmitted in the same manner via the skull bone to 
the (functioning) cochlea on the contralateral side [1].
Bone Anchored Hearing Systems (BAHS) have been used since the late 1970’s and are divided into two types :
direct drive and skin drive, both having two sub -types (see Figure 1). Direct drive denotes systems where the 
vibrations are transmitted directly to the bone (e.g. through an abutment connected to an osseointegrated 
implant), while in skin drive solution there is a layer of soft tissue between the transducer and the bone ( e.g. 
when utilizing a Softband). Percutaneous direct drive, also referred to as BAHS, is the most common type 
with more than 150.000 users world -wide [1].
The Ponto System
The Ponto system is an osseointegrated, percutaneous (direct drive) bone conduction system, which replaces 
the function of the outer and middle ear. This replacement happens by [CONTACT_142559] a transducer in the sound proce ssor and via a percutaneous implant anchored in the temporal 
bone. Sound is pi[INVESTIGATOR_142554] (vibrations) by[CONTACT_142560] a skin-penetrating 
abutment which is connected to the implant in the temporal bone of the skull (see Figure 2). The vibrations 
are conveyed from the implant by [CONTACT_142561]. In the cochlea, the vibrations 
are converted to signals that are transmitted to the brain through the auditory nerve.

This document is theconfidential property of Demant Group.
Template Doc-[ZIP_CODE]-5intended for the following patients and ind ications:
Patient swith conductive or mixed hearing losses, who can still benefit from amplification of the sound. 
The pure tone average (PTA) bone conduction (BC) threshold (measured at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 kHz) of the 
indicated ear should be better than or eq ual to 45 dB HL for use with the Ponto, Ponto Pro, Ponto Plus ,
Ponto 3 , Ponto 4 and Ponto 5 Mini sound processors, 55 dB HL for use with the Ponto Pro Power, 
Ponto Plus Power and Ponto 3 Power sound processors and 65 dB HL fo r use with the Ponto 3 
Super Power and Ponto 5 SuperPower sound processor s.
Bilateral fitting is applicable for most patients having a symmetrically conductive or mixed hearing loss. 
The difference between the left and right sides’ BC thresholds should be less than 10 dB on average
measured at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz, or less than 15 dB at individual frequencies. 
Patients who have a profound sensorineural hearing loss in one ear and normal hearing in the 
opposite ear (i.e. single sided deafness or “SSD”). The pure tone average (PTA) ai r conduction (AC) 
threshold of the hearing ear should then be better than or equal to 20 dB HL (measured at 0.5, 1, 2 
and 3 kHz).
Also indicated for any patient who is indicated for an air -conduction contralateral routing of signals 
(AC CROS) hearing aid, but who for some reason cannot or will not use an AC CROS.
JUSTIFICA TION FOR THE DESIGN OF THE STUDY
The study is a non-interventional, observational, cross -sectional , study on users of Ponto sound processors.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate subjectively assessed hearing performance and satisfaction with 
Oticon Medical’s sound processors fitted with the Genie Medical fitting software.
The overall study purpose aims to study long -term use ofOticon Medical’s sound processor Ponto (fitted 
with the Genie Medical fitting software) and how it impacts patient reported hearing improvements and
quality of life . 
The study is making use of subjective self-reported outcomes to evaluate hearing performa nce. Subjectively 
self-reported outcomes are commonly used to quantify how the patients subjectively perceive the device in 
their everyday life[C]and is considere dto provide representative measu rements of hearing improvement
[2]One such subjectively self-reported outcome measure is the IOI-HA[3]. The IOI-HAcontains generally 
applicable items forself-assessment of hearing aid fitting outcomes . It covers a minimal set of seven core 
outco me items targeting a different outcome domain. The domains are: daily use, benefit, residual activity 
limitations, satisfaction, residual participation restrictions, impact on others and quality of life. Each item has 
five response choices proceeding from the worst outcome to the bes toutcome .In terms of construction and 
wording , the items of the IOI-HAhavebeen designed to beeasy to read and understand .In addition it is 
designed to be self-explanatory and without any need for formal instructions [3]. The IOI-HA was originally 
designed to be distributed in paper form, but Thorén, Andersson and Lunner [4]found that the questionnaire
can be distributed also in an online format without compromising reliability of the outcome. Based on the 
short self-explanatory design [3]together with data supporting the use of the questionnaire for online use
[4]the IOI -HA has been chosen to be the questionnaire used inthis study. 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS A ND RISKS OF THE STUDY
No additional treatments or procedures will be utilized for this study, although participants will be asked to 
complete a survey. Therefore, only risks associated to data capture and data privacy have been identified 
and these are mitigated by [CONTACT_142563] (see Section 12).

Following overall information will be gathered from the participants:
Gender
Age
Usage of device 
Unilateral or bilateral user
Softband or Abutment fitting
Time of fitting (for how long they have used the device) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Part 2 International Outcome Inventory He aring Aids (IOI -HA)
The IOI-HA is a short questionnaire with generally applicable items used as self-assessment of hearing aid 
fitting outcomes. The questionnaire consists of seven item s: daily use, benefit, residual activity limitation, 
satisfaction, residual participation restrictions, impact on other and quality of life. Each item has five response 
choices proceeding from worst to best. Analy sisof the results can be done per item or total score. The items 
can be grouped in two subscales: Factor 1 (daily use, benefit, satisfaction and quality of life) and Factor 2: 
(residual activity limitation, residual participation rest rictions and impact on others) [3].
MONITORING
Due to the nature ofthis study, with users reporting data directly into the electronic system , monitoring is 
not applicable. 
STATISTICA L DESIGN AND ANALYSIS
The results of the IOI-HA(ranging from 1-5, 1=worst and 5= best) will be analyzed and presented using 
descriptive statistics. The values of the Overal l, Factor 1, Factor [ADDRESS_162002] deviation (SD), Median, M inimum and Maximum .
Sample size 
The user database currently consists of approx. [ADDRESS_162003] an initial response -rate of 50%, i.e.  
that approximately half of the users will respond to the survey invite. As the database continuously increases 
and out reach through social media and website also is planned additional outreach can be made to fulfill the 
sample size estimated below.  
The IOI -HA have been used for many studies on different number of subjects. The original paper the sample 
size was 172 [3]and the for the online validation [4]the sample size was 53. However, the IOI-HA has also 
been used for bigger populations, in [5]the IOI-HA was used on 1649 subjects.  For the two studies [3]and 
[4]the response rate were high and reported drop -out rates were 20% and 34%, respectively. Drop -out is in

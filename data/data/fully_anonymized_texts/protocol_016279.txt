[ADDRESS_331977] Context:  Developmental delays are frequently encountered among young children but disproportionately affect impoverished minority children leading to disparities in early child development. To promote healthy child development and reduce disparities, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates early intervention (EI) services be made available to young children with identified delays. However, only half of at-risk children initiate and complete referrals for EI services. Research suggests this may be due to misperceptions about EI services and logistical barriers that impede participation. As a result, many at-risk children do not receive needed services to improve their development early in life. It is unknown what strategies are effective to promote follow through with EI services. Thus, there is a critical need to identify effective strategies to foster initiation and completion of EI services among at-risk children. In the absence of such knowledge, public health agencies lack understanding of effective strategies to assist families with obtaining EI services and may propagate existing health disparities. Our long-term goal is to develop effective strategies to promote child development and reduce disparities through the development of our Opening Doors to Early Intervention Program, a patient navigation intervention designed to facilitate follow through with EI referrals and services. One parent from currently enrolled parent-child dyads in the Main RCT, will be recruited to participate in the sub-study which entails answering questions about safety net program use prior to and during the current COVID-[ADDRESS_331978] experienced childhood trauma.  Objectives:  1) To test the effectiveness of the Opening Doors to Early Intervention Program on EI service use and child developmental status among poor minority children residing in an urban community.  2) To develop a measure of engagement and assess whether parent engagement mediates the effects of the Opening Doors to Early Intervention Program.  
       
   vii 3) To explore whether the home learning environment, parental health literacy, or poverty moderate the effects of the Opening Doors to Early Intervention Program on child developmental status.  4) To determine changes in use of and need for safety net programs and adjustment to a remote service delivery model for Early Intervention services among low-income families of children with developmental disabilities during the current COVID-19 pandemic in Philadelphia.  5) To adapt an evidence-based co-parenting program for use among caregivers who have experienced significant trauma and chronic stress as a child. Study Design:  The main study is a prospective, randomized comparative effectiveness trial to study the effects of a novel patient navigation strategy on the use of EI referrals and services and on child developmental outcomes among at-risk urban minority children. For the sub-study, a total of around [ADDRESS_331979], will be recruited to participate in the COVID-rapid response sub-study. A subset of around 50 participants will be enrolled into the sub-study, along with up to 50 experts (in the fields of parenting, childhood trauma, and/or co-parenting) to participate in focus groups and Delphi consensus process. Setting/Participants: In the randomized controlled trial, we plan to recruit 4-6 urban practices from CHOP’s Pediatric Research Consortium (PeRC) to participate in the study. These practices care for a diverse, complex urban population and have onsite social workers to assist with family crises. A total of 360 eligible children, 90 children/year, will be recruited from participating practices to achieve a diverse sample of children. Children will be eligible to participate if they are <30 months old, >[ADDRESS_331980] recently been referred to the Philadelphia Infant Toddler Early Intervention Program in Philadelphia County. Children >30 months old will not be eligible, since they are transitioning to Preschool Early Intervention (Part B services) and have little time for retention or completion of the program. In addition, children outside of Philadelphia County will not be eligible, since they would be referred to EI services in a different county. Children will be excluded if they have received EI services in the past two weeks. The COVID-[ADDRESS_331981] provided permission to be contact[CONTACT_7678]. The Childhood Trauma sub-study will recruit up to 50 experts in the fields of parenting, childhood trauma, and/or co-parenting to participate in a modified Delphi consensus process

Then, up to [ADDRESS_331982] study, and these subjects will be recruited for the COVID-19 sub-study and also for Phase 2 of the Trauma-Informed Co-parenting Sub-study. The second group of subjects (Delphi Consensus group) will include up to 50 experts that will participate in Phase 1 of the Trauma-Informed Co-parenting Sub-study.  Study Interventions and Measures:  In the Main RCT, we will rigorously study the effects of the Opening Doors to Early Intervention Program’s Family Navigator (FN) intervention on the use of EI referrals and services and on child developmental outcomes among at-risk urban minority children.  In the COVID-[ADDRESS_331983] year participation in the following safety net programs: unemployment benefits; Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF); Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); Supplemental Security Income (SSI); Early Head Start; and county Early Intervention services. Questions derived from the latest Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) will be utilized to query participants on program use before and after the onset of the pandemic. To gain an in-depth understanding of safety net program use and adjustment to new service delivery models, we will conduct telephone interviews with 20-30 parents to identify their perceptions of program assistance and needs. We will inquire about each program they are currently participating in, how services are delivered (e.g. virtually), and whether the current format meets their needs. We will also inquire about barriers and facilitators to program participation and what unmet needs they currently have. An interview guide will be developed for the interviews. All interviews will be audiotaped and transcribed for analysis. In the Childhood Trauma sub-study, we will conduct 3-5 rounds of a modified Delphi process with up to 50 experts (fields of parenting, childhood trauma, and/or co-parenting) to develop a consensus list of childhood trauma and stress topi[INVESTIGATOR_271905]-parenting program known as Family Foundations (FF). We will then adapt the FF and conduct interviews with up to [ADDRESS_331984], using a CHOP approved conferencing software. Parents in the interviews will provide feedback on the adapted program regarding

The EI Program (Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) was established by [CONTACT_68118] [ADDRESS_331986] five years of life and to mitigate stressors among at-risk families that contribute to developmental delays.8 Reviews of EI programs found average improvements of 0.43-0.75 SD (~8-12 IQ points) in cognitive function.10,13 However, much of the research on the effectiveness of EI on at-risk children has involved premature infants,14-18 so it isn’t clear how effective EI services are for term or late preterm at-risk children. The National Early Intervention Longitudinal Study and other studies, which sought to describe participation rates in EI programs, found that few (2%) children participate in EI programs nationwide.3,19-21 This is particularly true for poor and racial minority children.22 This figure represents less than 20% of potentially eligible children. The few who do participate often experience long delays from initial recognition of a developmental delay to enrollment in an EI program: recognition first occurring at an average age of 7.4 months old and enrollment into EI and initiation of an Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) occurring at an average age of 15.[ADDRESS_331987] learning deficits that contribute to the so-called “Achievement Gap”. Improving access to early intervention services and early childhood educational systems is an important issue in reducing the “Achievement Gap”.[ADDRESS_331988] limited availability due to funding constraints.35  Federally-funded Part C EI services are a critical component in reducing disparities in early childhood development. However, it’s not entirely clear why at risk poor and racial minority children don’t fully utilize the EI system. Jimenez et al. found that families who didn’t complete EI referrals were more likely to misunderstand the importance of EI services, have ambivalence concerning the need for an EI referral, report distrust of the EI system, have a preference to manage the problem on their own without outside assistance, or experience logistical barriers to the completion of EI referrals.39,[ADDRESS_331989] been estimated to exceed $[ADDRESS_331990] children with developmental disabilities, with services to meet their children’s needs and basic family living expenses.101 Therefore, wide-spread crises such as the current COVID-19 pandemic can exert financial strains on these families as well as on the programs that support them. 
   
   3 1.3 Trauma-informed co-parenting program Sub-study Childhood exposure to trauma and chronic stress can lead to intergenerational cycles of poor parenting, childhood victimization, and maltreatment; thus contributing to suboptimal developmental outcomes across multiple generations. In prospective studies, up to 30% of parents who reported experiencing abuse as a child subsequently maltreated their children.32,33  Factors that mediate the relationship between a parental experience of maltreatment as a child and their own abusive parenting practices include parental antisocial behavior, depression, PTSD, early childbearing, and poor child disciplining skills.34–[ADDRESS_331991] of childhood trauma and chronic stress. Trauma-informed parent support programs (i.e. training addressing the impact of childhood exposure to trauma and chronic stress on parenting) have been effective in reducing risk for parent-child conflict, child maltreatment, and subsequent childhood behavior problems. In a meta-analysis examining the effect of trauma-informed parenting interventions, researchers found a significant reduction in internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems among children whose primary caregivers had experienced trauma during their childhood but completed a trauma-informed parent support program. The improvement in child behavioral problems was associated with an increased use of positive parenting practices and decrease in the use of negative parenting practices and parental stress among the caregivers.   Parents who have experienced trauma and chronic stress as a child may struggle to create strong co-parenting relationships (i.e., process through which adults work together to help children acquire values, habits, and attitudes as well as provide physical care for a child) with their caregiving partners. Strong co-parenting relationships are essential to promoting the practices and environment necessary for optimal child development. In a recent study of 477 parent dyads, we found that mothers and fathers reporting exposure to three or more traumatic experiences or chronic stressors as children displayed statistically significant decreases in co-parenting scores. 1.3.1 Introduction [IP_ADDRESS] Main RCT The overall objective is to study the effects of this novel strategy involving patient navigation on the initiation and completion of EI referrals and services and on child developmental outcomes among at-risk urban minority children using a participatory effort with Philadelphia’s EI community. PNs have been cited in the literature and consist of individuals who have been trained to provide patients with emotional support, instrumental and technical assistance, and/or health education in a culturally sensitive manner.48-[ADDRESS_331992] worked with members of Philadelphia’s EI community to modify a PN model to engage, inform, and assist poor urban minority parents who have children with suspected development delays to follow-through with EI referrals and services. This application addresses our long-term goal to identify strategies that promote healthy child development and reduce disparities by [CONTACT_271915] a well disseminated yet untested model among at-risk poor minority children with developmental delays in urban Philadelphia. The specific aims of this application address important gaps in the literature, namely to identify effective strategies to improve follow-through with EI services, to assess whether parent engagement mediates effects, and to explore whether intervention effects are moderated among families with known risk factors for poor child development including poverty, less enriching home environments, adverse childhood experiences and limited health literacy. This study is significant by [CONTACT_271916]. We will overcome limitations of previous studies by [CONTACT_14664] a rigorous randomized study with adequately powered sample sizes and a concurrent control group. Knowledge gained from this study can impact EI services, specifically Child Find practices designed to increase the identification and referral of children with developmental delays, with minimal economic impact through the reallocation of current Child Find funds to support patient navigators. If found to be successful, PN models have the potential to be scaled up and disseminated to address the poor participation rates in EI nationally. This proposal addresses the Healthy People 2020 objective to increase the proportion of children who are ready for school in all five domains of healthy development: physical development, social-emotional development, approaches to learning, language, and cognitive development.62  [IP_ADDRESS] Trauma-Informed Co-parenting Sub-study While the main RCT is examining family navigation for Early Intervention referral, this sub-study will address more upstream factors related to developmental delay. Approximately 20% of parent grant study participants report exposure to two or more traumatic experiences or chronic stressors growing up, making this supplement highly relevant. We will use qualitative, intervention development, and implementation science methods to adapt the Family Foundations program, which is an evidence-based universally used primary prevention program designed to enhance co-parenting relationship among cohabitating/married expecting first-time parents, into a trauma-informed parenting program for caregivers impacted by [CONTACT_271917]. In the first aim, we will solicit perspectives of parenting, childhood trauma, and co-parenting experts to identify the critical components of a trauma-informed program and conduct interviews with caregivers endorsing exposure to two or more traumatic or chronic stressors during their childhood to revise the Family Foundations curriculum and protocol.  
   
   5 1.4 Name [CONTACT_271971] a modified Patient Navigator model that we will refer to as a Family Navigator (FN) model, which will engage, inform, and assist participating parents to follow-through with the process of EI referrals and services. Eligible children randomized to the intervention arm will be provided with services from a FN. The FN will maintain contact [CONTACT_39118], the child’s primary care provider, and Early Intervention staff, if applicable, throughout the duration of the study.  1.[ADDRESS_331993] to identify and enroll eligible children with developmental delays and disabilities. Child Find practices utilized by [CONTACT_271918] a variety of different strategies ranging from public awareness campaigns to developmental screening to childcare and clinician referrals. In previous studies, we found that only 50% of urban patients in Philadelphia completed EI referrals once they were identified as having delays and referred using these strategies (See Preliminary Studies section). However, none of these current practices seek to engage, inform, and assist parents to overcome motivational, knowledge, and practical barriers to completion of referrals.  This application is innovative, in our opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], in adapting a PN model to address poor EI referral and service completion.  This model termed “Opening Doors to Early Intervention” was based on a review of the literature of patient navigators (or family navigators, as we will refer to them in our study) and received practical input from practicing clinicians, EI staff, and parents to adapt it. The intervention was manualized to ensure consistency of procedures and included multiple modules addressing 1) education of families regarding knowledge of early child development, 2) information on the EI system and steps necessary to complete an EI referral, 3) brief motivation interviewing to assess families’ goals and treatment preferences and level of interest in initiating EI referrals, 4) assistance with overcoming barriers to completing EI referrals and maintaining EI enrollment, and 5) social work referral in the event of medical complexity or family crisis (See Appendix for Manual of Operations). PNs met with families soon after a referral was made and then followed up with families using phone, email, or text messaging to track completion of the referral steps leading to a multidisciplinary evaluation for services (Fig 3). PNs provided assistance and encouragement when families experienced barriers to the completion of steps. Although the referral steps shown here are county-specific, we retained flexibility in the manual to allow adaptation to counties with different referral processes and steps. This proposal represents a novel application of a well disseminated patient navigation model shown to reduce health disparities in adult cancer and mental health treatment. This

   [ADDRESS_331994], we help families to understand what it is they want for their children, e.g. healthy development; how best to attain that goal, e.g. initiation of EI services; and their willingness and ability to complete the referral process. Third, the model provides for periodic check-ins with families and assists families to overcome barriers when they arise, e.g. rescheduling a missed appointment.  1.5.1 Scientific Premise [IP_ADDRESS] Main RCT While most efforts to reduce disparities in early child development have focused on primary prevention strategies, e.g. the Nurse-Family Partnership,37,43,[ADDRESS_331995] at-risk children and their families with accessing EI services. We are unaware of rigorous studies designed to identify effective strategies to improve EI participation. Identifying effective strategies to enhance the participation of at-risk urban minority families in existing early intervention programs has the potential to substantially mitigate existing disparities in early child development. [IP_ADDRESS] Trauma-Informed Co-parenting Sub-study Family Foundations (FF) is an evidence-based universal primary prevention program designed to enhance co-parenting relationships among cohabitating/married expecting first-time parents. Delivered as part of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based childbirth education program, the 
   
   [ADDRESS_331996], directly as traumatic experiences can trigger hostile and reactive parenting styles. Childhood trauma and chronic stress also lead to parental adjustment problems (stress, anxiety, depression, PTSD) which in turn leads to suboptimal parenting practices. At the same time, childhood trauma and chronic stress alters individual parent characteristics such as attitudes towards parenting which decrease cooperative parenting practices negatively impacting caregiving skills and subsequent child developmental outcomes. Effective co-parenting practices moderate the direct and indirect effects of childhood trauma and chronic stress on parenting, improving child developmental outcomes. Researchers have found FF to be an effective tool in promoting quality co-parenting and caregiver self-efficacy while decreasing parental stress and use of harsh discipline and child adjustment problems at age 3.56  However, FF has not been designed for use with trauma-impacted parents. We will use qualitative, intervention development, and implementation science methods to adapt the Family Foundations program into a trauma-informed parenting program for caregivers impacted by [CONTACT_271917].  1.6 Compliance Statement This study will be conducted in full accordance all applicable Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158737] 45 CFR 46 and the Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline approved by [CONTACT_8639]. All epi[INVESTIGATOR_48478].

[ADDRESS_331997] is to rigorously study the effects of the patient navigation intervention (Opening Doors to Early Intervention Program) on the use of EI referrals and services and on child develop-mental outcomes among at-risk urban minority children. Our central hypothesis is that patient navigation can improve parent engagement and knowledge, enhance follow through with EI services, and improve developmental outcomes among these children. Preliminary findings support this hypothesis and suggest the intervention is feasible and potentially effective. Findings from this study can be disseminated to similar urban counties across the U.S. to inform EI strategies and address disparities in early child development. We propose to test our central hypothesis and thereby

Caregivers of eligible children will be consented in person or remotely by [CONTACT_271924] e-consent process, to participate and will complete study visits at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months (Table 1). We will use all available means including letters, telephone calls, text messages, and emails to ensure data are collected thoroughly and systematically from all participants. Contact [CONTACT_271925] [ADDRESS_332000] been used in our prior work with urban populations to maintain >80% participant follow-up.[ADDRESS_332001] of parent- and observer-reported instruments and EI data. Following written informed consent (which is either completed in person or remotely with the electronic REDCap e-consent process), participant caregivers will complete a baseline visit. Measures of demographic characteristics (child age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, maternal education level, spoken language, and family structure) (Appendix 2), parental health literacy (SAHL) (Appendix 3), and the home learning environment (StimQ) (Appendix 4) will be collected at this visit. Due to the interactive nature of the SAHL measure, in the event that the baseline visit is conducted remotely, the participant will have the option of either completing the measure of parental health literacy (SAHL) remotely by [CONTACT_14662] a video conferencing application or completing the SAHL in-person at a later date. If a visit is conducted using a video conferencing application, we will try to use a HIPAA-compliant application licensed by [CONTACT_137108] (i.e., Skype, Bluejeans or WebEx). Measures of parent engagement and EI referral and service use will be collected at follow-up visits at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. These visits will be conducted in-person, by [CONTACT_756], or by [CONTACT_271926]. Parents will be asked at study visits to complete the EI Engagement questionnaire, which was adapted from the CECPS and generated during a prior study (IRB 18-014884), and measures of completion of EI referrals (intake, registration, assignment of service coordinator, home visit, and MDE), eligibility for and initiation of EI services (IFSP), EI services use if eligible (number of EI service visits and whether services were completed or terminated), and use of other services (transfer to Preschool EI services, childcare or preschool enrollment). We will corroborate parent-reported visits with EI staff. Participants will also complete the Philadelphia Expanded ACE measure at one time-point throughout the study. This time-point will typi[INVESTIGATOR_122896] 3-month survey, however the measure may be administered during either the 6- 9- or 12-month follow-up survey time-points in the event that the survey is not completed during the 3-month time-point. The ACEs survey assesses for adverse events in that have already occurred in the past (i.e., childhood adverse experiences), 
   
   [ADDRESS_332002] the veracity of the reported responses. Finally, all children will be assessed for developmental status around 12 months following enrollment at a time before the child turns 42 months 15 days. Parent’s and children will have the option of attending the Seashore house on CHOP’s main campus or the Robert’s Center for Pediatric Research on CHOP’s main campus, whichever is most convenient for the participant, to complete a measure of child developmental status (BSID-III) (Appendix 5). If the participant chooses the Seashore House, the Center for Human Phenomic Science will conduct the developmental assessment. If the participant chooses the Robert’s Center for Pediatric Research, a clinician will conduct the developmental assessment. In the event in-person procedures cannot take place at the time of the final study visit time-point (due to COVID-19 or other reasons) this assessment may be performed beyond the 12-month time-point, at a later date, anytime before the child turns 42 months and 15 days old. EI data on referral completion, EI referral completion, EI eligibility, and EI services use will be obtained from Philadelphia Infant Toddler Intervention, a community partner on this proposal, to corroborate parent self-report. The Early Intervention data is collected and managed by [CONTACT_271927]. 3.1.2 COVID-19 Rapid Response Sub-study: Safety Net Program Use Among Low-Income Families of Children with Developmental Disabilities During a Pandemic One parent from each of the currently enrolled parent-child dyads in the Main RCT will be contact[CONTACT_271928]-study. Participants consented into the sub-study will be surveyed concerning safety net program use prior to and during the current COVID-[ADDRESS_332003] year participation in the following safety net programs: unemployment benefits; Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF); Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); Supplemental Security Income (SSI); Early Head Start; and county early intervention services. Questions derived from the latest Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) will be utilized to query participants on program use before and after the onset of the pandemic.  To gain an in-depth understanding of safety net program use, we will conduct telephone interviews with 20-30 parents to identify their perceptions of program assistance and needs. We will inquire about each program they are currently participating in, how services are delivered (e.g. virtually), and whether the current format meets their needs. We will also inquire about barriers and facilitators to program participation and what unmet needs they currently have. An interview guide will be developed for the interviews. All interviews will be audiotaped and transcribed for analysis.

We will model changes in service use by [CONTACT_271929], race/ethnicity, and education level. Interview transcripts will be analyzed using NVivo, a qualitative software program. Transcripts will be coded, and themes will be generated using a deductive consensus approach and Grounded Theory. This sub-study will provide important information on current safety net program use and needs among low-income families of children with developmental disabilities during the current COVID-19 pandemic. This information can inform service needs and barriers to access to services for future pandemic planning, when needs are expected to increase due to employment furloughs and layoffs and access to services may be limited by [CONTACT_271930].  3.1.3 Trauma-Informed Co-parenting Sub-study The proposed study will be conducted in two phases: 1) modified Delphi approach to elicit from parenting, childhood trauma, and co-parenting experts key content that should be included in a primary care based trauma-informed adapted co-parenting program 2) qualitative methods to solicit perspectives from study participants currently enrolled in the Main RCT (R01MD011598) to adapt a primary care based trauma-informed co-parenting program  Phase 1 Key informants who are nationally or internationally recognized childhood trauma,  parenting, and/or co-parenting experts (individuals with a minimum of two peer-reviewed first author manuscripts on the subject matter) will be recruited to contribute to trauma-informed material to be included in the Family Foundations program. Phase [ADDRESS_332005], or who were former participants and provided consent to be contact[CONTACT_5646], will be recruited to participate in a virtual interview using a CHOP approved conferencing software (i.e., BlueJeans or WebEx). Inclusion criteria includes parents with children ages 42 months or younger who report exposure to two or more traumatic or chronic stressors as children. Parental exposure to traumatic and chronic stressors as a child is assessed as part of participation in the parent study using a modified Adverse Childhood Experiences questionnaire  3.2 Allocation to Treatment Groups and Blinding In this study, 360 eligible children will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_332006] bias and will ensure that patients in both arms are similar in observed and unobserved characteristics.  The initial randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_271931], child sex, and age group (0-<18 months old and 18-30 months old) to ensure 
   
   [ADDRESS_332007]-hoc statistically for any imbalances that arise. Allocation concealment (blinding of the treatment assignment) will be implemented using sealed, opaque envelopes, along with stratification, and randomly permuted blocks of unequal sizes (to prevent providers and patients from manipulating the randomization).  Treatment assignment will be done at the time of enrollment following informed consent and patients will be followed over time with measures related to EI referral completion, EI services completion, and patient engagement collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_332008] study duration for the 360 subjects will be approximately 12 months or until the BSID-III is completed (i.e., before the child turns 42 months 15 days).  3.3.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected A total of [ADDRESS_332009] study, and these subjects will be recruited for the COVID-19 sub-study and also for Phase 2 of the Trauma-Informed Co-parenting Sub-study.

Measures of demographic and biological variables (child age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, maternal education level, and family structure), parental health literacy, and the home environment will be collected by [CONTACT_271934] (Table 3). The Short Assessment of Health Literacy (SAHL, Appendix 3) is a validated 18-item measure of health literacy in both English and Spanish.76 The SAHL has good reliability (α=0.80 and 0.89) in Spanish- and English-speaking samples, and correlated well with other measures of health literacy including the REALM (r=0.94, p<0.05) and TOFHLA (r=0.68, p<0.05). SAHL scores ≤[ADDRESS_332021] been used to categorize low health literacy. The StimQ (Appendix 4) is a validated parent self-report questionnaire designed to measure cognitive stimulation provided in the home for children ages 5 to 72 months of age.77 The StimQ contains 4 subscales (availability of learning materials, reading, parental involvement in 1developmental advance, parental verbal responsivity) and is available in English and Spanish. Internal consistency (Cronbach a=0.88-0.93) and test-retest reliability (ICC=0.93) of the StimQ is excellent, and it correlates well (r=0.55) with the IT-HOME Inventory, another measure of the home environment.78 Poverty will be assessed by 
   
   18 examining family income (<100% of the Federal Poverty Level) and maternal education status (£ High School). Measures of engagement will be collected at baseline and at follow-up visits every 3months, while EI referral and service use will be collected at follow-up visits every [ADDRESS_332022] access to services (e.g. changes in EI funding or eligibility) will be queried of EI staff throughout the study period. The visits will be conducted by [CONTACT_271935]. The Client Engagement in Child Protective Services (CECPS, Appendix 1) is a validated 14-item measure of parent engagement in child welfare services and contains 4 subscales: receptivity, working relationship, buy-in, and mistrust.79 Reliability was good (α=0.95 for the total score and α=0.81-0.91 for subscale scores), and correlation with measures of global engagement and helpi[INVESTIGATOR_271906] (r=0.36 to 0.78). Following discussions with the author of the CECPS (personal communication with Diane Yatchmenoff), the CECPS will be adapted for an EI population by [CONTACT_271936]-structured interviews and cognitive testing with a separate group of parents previously referred to EI from one of the urban practices to identify new items and refine the wording on existing items. The adaption of the CECPS measure will be carried out as part of a separate study (IRB 18-014884).We have previously adapted an engagement measure for ADHD using a similar process (See Appendix). Parents will be asked at study visits to complete the adapted CECPS, which we are referring to as the EI Engagement questionnaire, and measures of completion of EI referrals (intake, registration, assignment of service coordinator, home visit, and MDE), eligibility for and initiation of EI services (IFSP), EI services use if eligible (number of EI service visits and duration of EI service visits), and use of other services (transfer to Preschool EI services, childcare or preschool enrollment). We will corroborate parent-reported visits with EI staff. Finally, all children will be assessed for developmental status at [ADDRESS_332023] edition (Bayley-III) (Appendix 5) is a validated scale of infant and toddler development from [ADDRESS_332024] edition (r=0.83). The Bayley-III has three subscales that will be utilized (cognitive, motor, and language) and a measure of socioemotional development. 5.1.3 Audio-recording of interviews A sub-set of the participants in the COVID-19 Rapid Response sub-study will participate in an audio-recorded semi-structured, one-on-one telephone interview with a study team member. Interview audio recordings will be transcribed by [CONTACT_271937] (http://www.adatranscription.com/). Audio recordings will be de-identified and sent via their secure server, and subsequent transcripts will be saved on a secure server accessed only by [CONTACT_40221].

As this study is not greater than minimal risk serious adverse events are not anticipated. 6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 6.1 Primary Endpoint In order to determine the effectiveness of the Opening Doors to Early Intervention Program on child developmental status, our primary outcome for this aim is the Bayley-III cognitive subscale measured at 12 months follow-up.   6.2 Secondary Endpoints Secondary outcomes include the Bayley-III language, motor, and socioemotional subscales and the binary outcomes of whether patients complete EI referrals and services at 12 months.   6.3 Control of Bias and Confounding Randomization and allocation concealment are the primary means of avoiding bias. Analytic strategies will also be used to control for residual confounding: (1) Stratification will control for imbalance not controlled by [CONTACT_8345]. (2) Additional potential confounders will be evaluated for any residual association with treatment and included in model as needed. (3) Post randomization effects: The primary source of bias will arise after randomization from dropout and loss to follow-up. To address this problem and avoid missing data, we shall implement the following measures: (a) incentives to each family to complete the study, (b) collection of multiple contact [CONTACT_271939], and (c) contact [CONTACT_271940], even if they do not continue with their clinical contacts. Baseline data collection will include questions about factors that predict potential dropout, such as current living situations and regularity of contact [CONTACT_271941].85,86 (4) Our analytic model for treatment effect will include not only potential confounders but also predictors of dropout, to be able to relax assumptions about the missing data process. (5) To investigate the possibly informative dropout (for reasons related to the intervention), we will implement sensitivity analyses.87,88 (6) For missing values in any of the outcome measurement tools, we will implement formal methods of multiple imputation.89,90 (7) We shall account for all dropouts and check all baseline information in real time for both invalid values and missing items and then prompt the child’s caregiver for any corrections or clarifications. Then, if any covariates remain missing, we shall implement multiple imputation. (8) Attenuation bias from non-compliance might also occur if the child remains 
   
   [ADDRESS_332026] of treatment in the presence of full compliance, we will implement the methods outlined by [CONTACT_271942].92 However, the “as randomized” approach will remain the primary method for assessing statistical significance of the intervention.    6.[ADDRESS_332027] [IP_ADDRESS] Specific Aim 1 Primary outcomes In order to determine the effectiveness of the Opening Doors to Early Intervention Program on child developmental status, our primary outcome for this aim is the Bayley-III cognitive subscale measured at 12 months follow-up.  For our primary outcome, a linear mixed effects approach will be used to model differences in cognitive functioning between intervention groups accounting for clustering due to practice. Such an approach is advantageous for offering flexible means for accounting for potential issues that arise in randomized trials.  For example, baseline patient characteristics that were not balanced across intervention groups by [CONTACT_271943].  Also, differential drop-out and loss to follow-up between groups can be accounted for by [CONTACT_271944].83,84  Secondary outcomes Secondary outcomes include the Bayley-III language, motor, and socioemotional subscales and the binary outcomes of whether patients complete EI referrals and services at 12 months.  Descriptive statistics for demographic, behavioral, and environmental characteristics measured at baseline will be examined across the two treatment groups to assess the success of the randomization. The secondary outcomes can be modeled using either a linear or logistics mixed effects model, which has similar flexibility. As a secondary analysis, we will examine differences in dosage (duration of EI service use and number of EI service visits) between intervention groups among those eligible for services. We will also examine the impact of public policy changes on the proportion eligible for EI and on the number of service visits pre- and post-change. In addition, we will examine the effects of the intervention by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity group, sex, and age group (<18 months, >18 months) to assess for differential intervention effects.  
   
   21 [IP_ADDRESS] Specific Aim [ADDRESS_332028] aim.  [IP_ADDRESS] Specific Aim [ADDRESS_332029] whether the association between intervention and the outcome differs by [CONTACT_271945].  Factors of importance from the background section that will be used in this aim include family level variables (race/ethnicity, maternal education level, family income category, StimQ total scores, and SAHL scores).  [IP_ADDRESS] Specific Aim [ADDRESS_332030] of the COVID-19 Rapid Response sub-study, we will determine changes in use of and need for safety net programs among low-income families of children with developmental disabilities during the current COVID-19 pandemic in Philadelphia. [IP_ADDRESS] Specific Aim [ADDRESS_332031] an 80% follow-up rate, the number needed to recruit to obtain this final sample size is about 360. Since a partial goal of the proposed intervention is to increase patient engagement, the rate of drop out is likely to be lower among the intervention group. If we conservatively assume that the drop-out rate among control patients is double that of patients on the intervention, the sample of patients 
   
   [ADDRESS_332032] of approximately 130 control patients and 170 intervention patients.  Using the Bayley-III cognitive subscale as a primary outcome, we assert that the proposed intervention would be successful if it resulted in an increase of 3 points or more on this subscale. This is the minimal clinically significant outcome difference. Thus, based on the proposed sample size, we would obtain 96% power to detect a clinically meaningful difference in the Bayley-III cognitive scores. The power was estimated based on a simulation study that assumed that the sole impact of the intervention was on increasing enrollment into EI. Based on expected cognitive improvements due to EI found by [CONTACT_271946], we further assume that children who enrolled in EI had an average increase over a [ADDRESS_332033] deviation of 1 point compared to patients who did not enroll.10,12,58 Based on these assumptions, an increase of 3 points on the cognitive scale between the intervention and control group would be the result of an increased rate of enrollment from 50% among controls to 80% among the intervention group. These rates of enrollment are consistent with rates suggested by [CONTACT_10323][INVESTIGATOR_10299] (Preliminary Studies Section).[ADDRESS_332034] a clinically meaningful difference  Assuming a minimal clinically significant outcome difference (≥ 3 points increase in the BSID-III cognitive subscale)  If this level of mediation by [CONTACT_271947], such differences should be adequately characterized by [CONTACT_271948]. To assess power to detect moderating effects, we use dichotomized literacy as an example based on having a SAHL score ≤ 14. We assume a rate of inadequate literacy of 50% in each group and that the overall effect of the intervention on the cognitive score is the same as before. Using a simulation study based on these assumptions, the proposed sample size would give us approximately 84% power to a 6-point difference in differences for the effect of the intervention among children whose parents have inadequate literacy compared to children whose parents have adequate literacy.

Power n 0.[ADDRESS_332036], the FN will either meet with or speak with families remotely at the beginning of the study to review results of developmental screening tests and/or milestone assessments. This modified FN model process proceeds in five modules. Specifically, they will provide to families 1) education regarding knowledge of early child development, 2) information on the EI system and steps necessary to complete an EI referral, 3) brief motivation interviewing to assess families’ goals and treatment preferences and level of interest in initiating EI referrals, 4) ongoing assistance to overcome barriers to completing EI referrals and maintaining EI enrollment, and 5) social work referrals in the event of family crisis or medical complexity. Specific procedures in separate modules, e.g. Early Intervention Intake Monitoring, have been manualized. The FN will contact [CONTACT_271949], text messaging, or email depending on family preference to monitor initiation and completion of referral steps, identify family concerns and/or barriers to referral completion, and assist families with problem-solving to identify barriers and solutions to complete EI referrals. Using email or telephone, the FN will also communicate with pediatric clinicians and EI staff to clarify treatment plans and goals and address emerging issues. A fidelity checklist developed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_271907]-reported task completion by [CONTACT_271950] (0- not completed, 1- partially completed, 2- fully completed). In addition, the FN will summarize patient encounters, e.g. telephone calls with parents, in a log file. In the control arm, eligible children and their families will follow usual care procedures. As such, families are counseled by [CONTACT_25240], provided with educational handouts on development and the EI process, and referred to EI using electronic faxes from the clinic offices to the EI administrative office. EI staff then contact [CONTACT_271951] (see Fig. 3). Families that fail to complete EI referrals and/or services in a timely manner may be dropped by [CONTACT_271952]-referred by [CONTACT_271953]. 7.2 Trauma-Informed Co-parenting Sub-study 7.2.1 Description [IP_ADDRESS] Phase 1 (Delphi Process) We will develop a consensus list of childhood stress and trauma-related topi[INVESTIGATOR_271908]-based trauma-informed co-parenting program, we will use a modified Delphi process to achieve agreement amongst key parenting/childhood trauma and chronic stress experts as to which topi[INVESTIGATOR_271909]. Participants will be asked to complete three to five iterations of the Delphi process using an internet-based survey. We will ask experts to complete the survey all at once and within two weeks of receiving the questionnaire. Participation can last between 2-[ADDRESS_332037] (1) to most important (4) for inclusion. During the first three rounds of the Delphi process, experts will be given the opportunity to add subject areas that were not initially included to our list.  [IP_ADDRESS] Phase 2 (Interviews) We will conduct interviews with up to [ADDRESS_332038] ODEI study ( IRB #18-014807), or if a former participant in the Main RCT, provided consent to be contact[CONTACT_5646], who report exposure to two or more traumatic events or chronic stressors as a child and have children ages [ADDRESS_332039] interviews virtually. Research assistants will help facilitate interviews and take notes. Interviews will be recorded, transcribed, de-identified, and entered into NVivo 12.0 for coding and analysis. We anticipate conducting interviews with a maximum of 50 caregivers but less if saturation is reached prior to interviewing 50 caregivers.  8 SAFETY MANAGEMENT 8.1 Clinical Adverse Events Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.   8.2 Adverse Event Reporting Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen during the course of this study (including SAEs) they will be reported to the PDPH IRB and the CHOP IRB in accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review.   9 STUDY ADMINISTRATION 9.1 Treatment Assignment Methods 9.1.1 Randomization Children and their parents will be randomized following informed written consent 1:1 to 1) a family navigator trained in the Opening Doors to Early Intervention program or 2) usual 
   
   25 care. Children will be stratified by [CONTACT_271931], age group (<18 months, 18-30 months old), and sex and randomized in blocks of 10-15 using randomly generated study numbers. Sealed opaque envelopes containing treatment assignments will be produced by [CONTACT_15282]. Children and their parents will participate in the study over a 12-month period with data collection occurring at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months.    9.1.2 Blinding Allocation concealment (blinding of the treatment assignment) will be implemented using sealed, opaque envelopes, along with stratification, and randomly permuted blocks of unequal sizes (to prevent providers and patients from manipulating the randomization). Participants will not be blinded to their treatment assignment. However, research will be blinded to treatment assignment when collecting study data. 9.[ADDRESS_332040]. All data for these study procedures will be maintained on CHOP’s secure research server, and all analyses will be performed on de-identified data only. All collected study measures will be entered directly into a REDCap database maintained and protected on this secure research server. The unique identifiers will be used to track enrolled families over the course of the study. Confidentiality will also be maintained by [CONTACT_271954]. Each member of the research team, including investigators, research assistants, and stakeholder-investigators will receive appropriate training in human subjects research and patient confidentiality.  Unique identifiers will be created for each subject in the study. REDCap will be used to store the data. A master list containing PHI and subject ID number will be kept separate from data forms (electronic and paper). The master list will be kept using password-protected files. These files will be encrypted and maintained on the CHOP secure server to ensure security. Participants’ information will be stored in the REDCap database and configured to export data without PHI. All de-identified records will be retained forever. De-identified data will be shared with the study sponsor. Stored data and patient identifiers will be kept for [ADDRESS_332041] NIH guidelines, a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC) will be automatically generated for this NIH-funded study.   Throughout the study, the Philadelphia Infant Toddler Early Intervention data will be shared with the Study Investigators. Additionally, any necessary study data will be transmitted accordingly to Clinicaltrials.gov.   9.[ADDRESS_332042] (DSMB). Research staff will provide reports of preliminary data and adverse events to the DSMB, and to the CHOP and PDPH IRBs on a yearly basis throughout the duration of the study. In the unlikely event of an adverse outcome associated with this study protocol, e.g. disclosure of patient information, it will be documented and discussed with the research team, and reported to the CHOP and PDPH IRBs and the NIMHD, if appropriate.  Any serious adverse events will be reported to the CHOP and PDPH IRBs, the DSMB, and to NIMHD within [ADDRESS_332043] (CAB) will meet twice annually to review study progress and make recommendations. The CAB will consist of the PI, an administrator at Philadelphia Infant Toddler Early Intervention, and three parents not enrolled in the study.   
   
   [ADDRESS_332044] information will be provided at the time of consent.  Should any specific concerns arise, the study team will intervene to address problems including, if needed, a change or discontinuation of study procedures.  The CHOP and PDPH IRBs will be promptly informed of any concerns.   The research involves the collection of information from parents and children and data from EI services. The risk of participation is considered minimal. There is a potential risk of breach of confidentiality of information and study results about individuals. This risk is minimized by [CONTACT_271955]; risks are greatly reduced by [CONTACT_171739], storing data on secure computers, using unique study identifiers, and de-identification of data prior to analysis. A second risk is that participants may become uncomfortable in completing study measures. If this occurs, the protocol will allow participants to stop at any time. Should any specific concerns arise throughout the project period, the CHOP and PDPH IRBs will be promptly informed. Since the purpose of the intervention is to help children and their families’ complete EI services and improve child development, we expect that adverse consequences will be extremely rare and unlikely. A third risk is that research staff may identify potential child abuse or neglect among study participants and report the incident to Child Protective Services. To prepare for this situation, all staff with direct interactions with child study participants will be required to undergo training in child abuse and neglect recognition available at CHOP. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania requires such training of all individuals who have direct contact [CONTACT_271956]. In addition, a child abuse and neglect protocol (see Appendix) will be submitted with the initial IRB application that will outline reporting requirements and procedures in the event of suspected child abuse and neglect.  9.4.[ADDRESS_332045]: Subjects Recruitment will be conducted through the Pediatric Research Consortium (PeRC). Eligible children and their parents will be identified at the time of a clinical encounter (visit or telephone) involving a referral to EI through the use of an EHR recruitment prompt. Parents who verbally agree to be contact[CONTACT_271957]. Medical records of the potentially eligible subjects will be screened and assessed for eligibility prior to contact[CONTACT_13742]. Subsequent to screening the medical record, the subject will be called by [CONTACT_271958] a study visit that will be completed either in person or remotely. Research staff will briefly explain the study procedures, guided by [CONTACT_271959]. This includes reading the inclusion criteria to the potential participant, and asking whether or not this individual is interested in participating. Research staff will then schedule a time to either meet with the parent in person or to complete the baseline visit remotely. In the event that the baseline visit is scheduled to be completed remotely, research staff will also need to confirm the subject’s email address in order to send them the electronic Informed Consent Form via REDCap. At this visit, parents will be asked to provide written informed consent (which can be completed in person or remotely by [CONTACT_271960] e-consent process) to participate in the study and to sign, either in person or electronically, a Medical Release of Information form to enable the research team to obtain EI data from Philadelphia Infant Toddler Early Intervention. The consent and Medical Release of Information form will be administered by a trained member of the research staff either in person or remotely and will consist of all elements of informed consent.   Based on data from a previous clinical trial involving [ADDRESS_332046] 332 children per year.44 90 eligible children (28%) per year will be recruited from the participating practices using an electronic recruitment tool embedded in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271910]. We previously utilized this tool in other studies to identify eligible participants at the point-of-care and obtain consent for contact [CONTACT_271961]. Children are members of a special class. The rationale for the involvement of children in the study is that the investigation 
   
   29 addresses child development in pediatric care settings. The study does not involve any other special class of subjects.   9.5.2 COVID-19 Rapid Response: Subjects One parent from each of the currently enrolled parent-child dyads in the Main RCT will be contact[CONTACT_100180] a study team member to obtain verbal consent for participation in the COVID-[ADDRESS_332047] in potentially participating in the sub-study, the study team member will proceed to verbally consent the participant into the sub-study.   9.5.3 Primary Care Clinics, Clinicians and EI Staff  The 4-6 practices within the (PeRC network will be invited to participate through a well-established process using in-person presentations and solicitations. A waiver of consent will be sought for primary care clinicians and EI staff, since no information will be collected about them, and all information collected from them will be clinical information (e.g. referral status) to be shared directly with the clinical team. Primary care clinicians at participating practices and EI staff will be informed of the study by [CONTACT_271962], and those who have a patient randomized to the intervention arm will receive text or phone messages and emails from the family navigator as part of the intervention component. 9.5.4 Trauma-Informed Co-parenting Sub-study: Subjects Phase 1: a list of experts in the fields of parenting, childhood trauma, and/or co-parenting that meet the initial screening criteria (minimum of [ADDRESS_332048] author publications) will be utilized to contact [CONTACT_42148]. An email describing the Delphi process will be sent and participants will be provided with a unique survey link that contains additional details about the study, a copy of the consent form for review, and a question that asks whether he/she is interested in participating (participation questionnaire). Subjects that respond as interested will have their email included on Delphi process distribution list. Additional experts referred by [CONTACT_271963], as applicable. Email will serve as the primary method of recruitment, but we will also mail an invitation letter to the experts as another form of recruitment. These efforts will be made as a second form of contact [CONTACT_271964]. The invitation letter will include the same information that will be provided to the experts in the email, however instead of a link to the online questionnaire, we will ask the experts to contact [CONTACT_271965]. Our team will then generate a unique link to send by [CONTACT_271966].   Phase 2: a parent who is currently enrolled in the Main RCT or is a former participant of the Main RCT and provided consent to be contact[CONTACT_5646], will be contact[CONTACT_100180] a study team member to briefly explain the sub-study and inquire as to whether or not they might be interested in participating. If the subject states their interest, the study team member will proceed to verbally consent the participant into the sub-study. 
   
   30 9.6 Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization Following the screening via review of the medical record, eligibility for study participation will be explained via phone. During the research staff visit subsequent to the screening process, written informed consent will be completed. Written informed consent can be completed either in person or remotely utilizing the electronic REDCap e-consent process. Research staff will discuss the study aims, procedures, risks and benefits, alternatives to participation, and confidentiality protocols with the parent. Research staff will speak to the parent about the voluntary nature of participation and provide the potential subject with the opportunity to ask questions about the study and its risks and benefits. Parents who consent to participate will either sign two copi[INVESTIGATOR_1076]: one will be kept for study purposes and the other will be provided to the consenting parent, or they will electronically sign the e-consent form through REDCap. Parents will be provided with plenty of time to ask questions and to decide whether they want to participate. Parents will be explicitly instructed that they are free to choose to participate and that their decision to participate will not affect the health care they or their children receive at participating practices. Participants who are already enrolled in the study and need to be reconsented due to study changes (such as the implementation of certain measures), will be contact[CONTACT_271967]-consented over the phone (or in person if that is the preferred method of the participant). No information sheet or copy will be offered to subjects who are verbally re-consented due to the fact that these subjects already have a copy of the main consent form.  The Trauma-Informed Co-parenting Sub-study will abide by [CONTACT_271968] 2. As this phase will be enrolled over the phone and investigators will not meet the participants in person, it would be impracticable to conduct the research without the waiver. For Phase 1 participants (experts), consent will be obtained through the online Participation Questionnaire (recruitment phase) and continued participation throughout the survey rounds will imply consent. Participants for Phase [ADDRESS_332049] (HIPAA).  CHOP personnel, including research staff and stakeholders, must complete training on the privacy measures of HIPAA. This training reviews the HIPAA policies relevant to research practice to protect the confidentiality of patients and research subjects.  The protection of human subjects training provides formal, comprehensive education in order to protect children, adolescents, and parents from the risks associated with participating in research, and to reduce the risk to 
   
   31 investigators and the institution that are associated with non-compliance.  Training covers institutional policies and procedures, federal regulations and critical aspects of study implementation.  These training requirements are fulfilled by [CONTACT_271969] (CITI) Course in the Protection of Human Subjects, an online program that covers the history and ethics of human subject research, the organizational structure and procedures of the Institutional Review Board, the protocol process, HIPAA for clinical research, and standards for conducting clinical research at CHOP.   1.1.[ADDRESS_332050] a car seat for the final study visit (Study Visit 5) through CHOP’s Family and Visitor services. In the event that the participant does not have a car seat, the participant will be reimbursed on their Clincard for their roundtrip travel based on mileage.   9.6.1 Payments to parent for time and inconvenience (i.e. compensation) Participants will be paid up to a total of $200 for their participation. They will receive $40 upon completion of the initial study visit (Baseline). They will then receive $20 upon completion of each of the three follow-up visits (3 month, 6 month, and 9 month follow-up). At the final study visit (12 month follow-up) they will receive $100. Participants in the sub-study will receive an additional $20 payment for completing the sub-study REDCap survey, and an additional $30 payment for completing the sub-study telephone interview if they are selected to do so. All payments will be made in the form of pre-paid, CHOP-issued debit cards (i.e., ClinCard). In the event that the Enrollment Visit or other follow-up visits are unable to be completed in-person (due to COVID-19 or other reasons), the participant will be mailed a ClinCard. Once study staff confirms that the participant has received the ClinCard, the ClinCard will be activated and relevant payments will be uploaded. Participants in Phase 1 of the Trauma-Informed Co-parenting Sub-Study will receive a one-time payment of $20 for participating in the Delphi process. Participants in Phase 2 of the Sub-study will receive a one-time payment of $20 for participating in an interview. All payments will be made in the form of pre-paid, CHOP-issued debit cards.  9.6.2 Gifts No other gifts will be given.   10 PUBLICATION This study will be registered with ClinicalTrials.gov following IRB approval of the final protocol and before any potential patients and their families are enrolled in the study. All study data will then be reported to the ClinicalTrials.gov site. Additionally, all arising publications of Study data and analyses will follow the set of guidelines outlined in the CHOP publications policy manual.  The research team plans to work closely with key stakeholders to disseminate and 
   
   32 implement the findings of the research study into accessible and usable formats in research, clinical, and community-based settings. We will target findings to state and national policymakers, county EI agencies across the state, parent advocacy groups, and pediatric practices using social media, policy briefs, mass emails, and newsletters. We will work with PolicyLab at CHOP to develop dissemination plans. PolicyLab has extensive experience distilling research findings into policy-relevant summaries and disseminating research findings to end-users. We will also utilize traditional approaches such as peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national meetings to disseminate findings to other researchers.

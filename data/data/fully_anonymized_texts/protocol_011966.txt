Clinical  Study  Protocol  C1 [ADDRESS_1065983] -COVID -19-US, Amendment  3, Version  4.0 Dated  25 May 2021  Page 9 of 58  
  
Background and 
Rationale:  Severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_19960]  2 (SARS-  
CoV-2) has spread globally since December 2019 causing a  
pandemic of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID -19) in almost all  
countries  worldwide.  The clinical spectrum  of COVID -19 
ranges  from asymptomatic  carriers  to respi[INVESTIGATOR_776124] (ICU).  
Systemic hyperinflammation is a hallmark  of more  severe  
stages  of COVID -19 leading to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_296043]  (“ARDS”),  mechanical  ventilation and ultimately  
death. In this stage, COVID -[ADDRESS_1065984] immune  system  
remains poorly understood but likely involves several immune  
cells and inflammatory  plasmatic  cascades  such  as the 
complement  and the kinin-kallikrein  (KK) system.  The 
complement system (CS) is an integral part of the innate  
immune system and consists of a number of distinct plasma  
proteins  that act as a first line of defense inducing an 
inflammatory response after opsonization of pathogens and  
dying cells.  Previous  evidence indicated that an over-activated  
complement  systems,  driven by [CONTACT_776189], seems to contribute to acute lung  
injury  (“ALI”) in response  to infection with CoV such  as SARS - 
CoV-2 leading to the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_776125] -19 
pneumonia and consequently to  ARDS.  
The KK system is a plasmatic cascade that after activation  
(shear stress of vessels, e.g. during vascular inflammation)  
and subsequent cleavage of kininogen by [CONTACT_776190]. Bradykinin binds to B2- receptors on endothelial  
cells leading to capi[INVESTIGATOR_776126].  After  
enzymatic degradation bradykinin products may also bind to 
B1-receptors on endothelial cells that are upregulated under  
proinflammatory conditions and have strong vasopermeable  
capacity. Although direct evidence is lacking, several facts  
argue for an involvement  of bradykinin in pulmonary  
angioedema observed in COVID -19, in particular a reduced  
activity of ACE2 caused by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV-2 leading to a relative  
abundance of bradykinin degradation production with 
subsequent B 1 activation  and local pulmonary  edema.  
C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH) is a member of the serpin  
superfamily  of serine -protease inhibitors  and is a strong  
inhibitor of the CS and KK system among others. RhC1INH is  
a recombinant human C1INH, that shares an identical protein 
structure  with plasma- derived  C1INH.  Although  data on C1INH  
treatment in the context of SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_1065985] that C1INH treatment  
may reduce  the collateral  damage  caused by 
[CONTACT_776191].  The rationale  of the 
current trial is based upon the following assumptions: In the  
context  of COVID -19, rhC1INH  treatment  may:  1) dampen  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  C1 [ADDRESS_1065986] -COVID -19-US, Amendment  3, Version  4.0 Dated  25 May 2021  Page 10 of 58  
  
 uncontrolled  complement  activation  and collateral  lung 
damage and 2) reduce  capi[INVESTIGATOR_776127].  
Hypothesis: Administration of rhC1INH for [ADDRESS_1065987] of care (SOC) in patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776128] - 
critical SARS -CoV-2 pneumonia (WHO Ordinal Scale Score 3  
or 4) will be associated with a reduced clinical severity  on day 
7 after inclusion  and a lower  risk of disease  progression to ALI 
and ARDS.  
Objective(s):  The primary objective of the study is to determine if adding [ADDRESS_1065988]  
disease severity within 7 days after inclusion as assessed by  
[CONTACT_776192]  (“WHO  
Ordinal  Scale”).  
Secondary  objectives  will determine if rhC1INH  will 
- Reduce the time to clinical improvement (time from  
randomization to an improvement of two points on the  
WHO ordinal scale or  live discharge from  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  
whichever  came  first) within  14 days  after enroll ment.  
- Increase the proportion of participants alive and not  
having required invasive or non- invasive ventilation at  
14 days  after enrollment.  
- Reduce the proportion of subjects with ARDS (defined 
by [CONTACT_776193])  within  14 days  after 
enrollment.  
Outcome(s):  The primary  endpoint  will be the disease severity  on the 7-point  
WHO  Ordinal  scale  on day 7. The WHO  Ordinal  scale  
measures  illness  severity over  time.  
Secondary  endpoints  include:  
- Time to clinical improvement (time from randomization  
to an improvement  of two points  on the seven- category  
WHO Ordinal scale or live discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  
whichever  came  first) within  14 days  after enrollment.  
- Proportion  of participants  alive and not having  required  
invasive or non -invasive ventilation at 14 days after  
enrollment.  
- Proportion of subjects with ARDS (defined by [CONTACT_776194])  within  14 days after  enrollment.  
Study design:  Randomized,  open -label,  parallel -group,  controlled,  multi - 
center  clinical trial

ventilation will be documented.  Disease  severity  will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_776195]:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Virological  clearance will be assessed  at [ADDRESS_1065995] /  
Intervention:  RhC1INH will be administered (150 U/ml) at a 50 U/kg dose  
(max  dose of 4200  U) as a slow intravenous  injection in

Number of Participants  
with Rationale:  Approximately  120 subjects  (80 in the active  treatment  arm, 40 
in the SOC group).  
The primary endpoint is a [ADDRESS_1065997] 1 point. Then, the standardized  
difference is about δ/σ = 0.67. For a fixed sample size design  
with a two -sided significance level of α = 0.05 and a power of  
1 - β = 0.80,  a sample size of N = [ADDRESS_1065998], we add 4 patients in each group, and  
because of drop- outs we add also 4 patients in each group to  
N = 2 x 46. For a 2:1-randomization,  a nonparametric  analysis  
by [CONTACT_776197] -test, and an adaptive group  
sequential analysis, the overall sample size is estimated as  
120 = 80 + 40. 
All patients are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], and it is very unlikely that the  
primary  endpoint  at Day 7 will not be measured.  Nevertheless,  
a drop-out rate of about  10% is included.  
Two interim analyses after 32 and 80 patients are planned  
according to the Pocock adjusted levels αp = 0.0221. Based  
on the results of an interim analysis the sample size can be  
adjusted  (Lehmacher,  Wassmer,  1999).  There  are no 
prespecified futility margins, but the DSMB can stop the study  
in the case  of insufficient  interim  results.

Statistical  
Considerations:  Detailed  methodology  for statistical  analyses  of the data 
collected  in this trial will be documented in a Statistical Analysis  
Plan.  
Full Analysis  Set/Intent -to-Treat  Population:  The FAS/ITT  
Population is defined as all patients  who are randomly  
allocated to a study arm. Statistical analyses will be based on  
the treatment  arm to which  the patient  was allocated.  
Safety Population: The Safety Population is defined as all  
patients who  received at least  one dose of rhC1INH.  
The primary  endpoint  WHO  7-point  outcome scale  at day [ADDRESS_1065999] 
stratified by [CONTACT_776198]- sided α -level of 5 %.  
The secondary  endpoint  is time to improvement  of at least  [ADDRESS_1066000] of the primary  
endpoint  (a priori  ordered hypotheses),  therefore,  no alpha 
adjustment  is necessary.  
Furthermore,  95% confidence  intervals  will be determined,  and 
the results  will be presented graphically  by [CONTACT_776199]-and- 
whisker  plots.  
Time  to event  (e.g. death,  virological  clearance,  
defervescence) will be displayed by [CONTACT_5263]- Meier plots and 
compared with a Wilcoxon rank test. Appropriate statistical  
tests  will be used for the analysis  of other  outcomes  of interest

1.3 Data  Safety Monitoring  Committee  
For rhC1INH serious  adverse events  see the current  Investigator’s  Brochure (IB). 
As the frequency  of comorbidities  in the patient  population under  study  is significant  and clinical  
complications are common in patients with COVID -19 infection, serious adverse events are  
possible  in this setting.  Hence,  we will establish  periodic  interim  safety  review  meetings  (ISRM) 
by [CONTACT_86493].  This Data Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB) will be responsible 
for safeguarding the interests of the study participants by [CONTACT_776200]. The DSMB may also consider factors external to the study  
when relevant information becomes available, such as scientific or therapeutic developments  
that may have  an impact  on the safety  of the patients  or the ethics  of the study.  An independent  
statistician will provide the DSMB with the pertinent safety data. The DSMB’s responsibility,  
roles and procedures will be specified in the study -specific DSMB Charter. A first ISRM will  
take place after inclusion of 32 patients. The advice(s) of the DSMB will only be sent to  
Pharming (Sponsor).  Should the Sponsor decide not to fully implement this advice, the  
Sponsor will send the advice to the Institutional Review Board (IRBs) and the Food Drug  
Administration  (FDA),  as appropriate,  including a note to substantiate  why (part of)  the advice 
of the DSMB  will not  be followed.

off-label  use of certain drugs  that are deemed to be effective in COVID -19 (e.g.,  
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir). In addition, escalation of treatment with off -label use of certain drugs (e.g.  
tocilizumab) in deteriorating participants is allowed during the trial. Anaphylactic reactions are 
exceptionally rare and have only been observed in a single patient with a pre- existent allergy  
to rabbits.  Although  patients  with rabbit  allergy  will be excluded  from participating in the study,  
included subjects will be monitored for anaphylactic e vents during and for at least 12 hours  
after each  administration  of rhC1INH.  A randomized,  open- label  study  design was chosen  due 
to the limited  experience of rhC1INH in this setting. The majority  of study  assessments will be 
conducted while the participants are admitted.  After discharge, the 3 month follow -up period  
will continue via weekly  telemedicine interview  or telephone call to assess adverse events  and 
outcomes.  
 
Participants’  confidentiality  will be maintained throughout  the trial. 
 
The decision of the FDA and the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in 
writing to the Sponsor before commencement of this study. The clinical study can only begin once approval from all required authorities has been received. Any additional requirements  
imposed by [CONTACT_776201].

The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_776138]. No changes will be made to the protocol without prior IRB  
approval,  except  where  necessary  to eliminate  apparent  immediate  hazards  to study  
participants.  
Reporting duties: Written progress reports will be sent to the IRB annually, or more frequently  
if requested  by [CONTACT_1201]. All Suspected  Unexpected Serious  Adverse  Reactions  (S[LOCATION_003]RS)  will 
be reported  within  7 (leading to death and life-threatening)  or 15 (others)  days to  the IRB. 
Premature  Termination of the Study  
Premature  study  end or interruption of the study  is reported within  15 days.  The regular  end of 
the study is reported to the IRB within 90 days, the final study report shall be submitted within  
one year after study end. Amendments  are reported according  to Section  2.9. 
Reasons for terminating the clinical study or participation of a study site may include, but are  
not limited  to, the  following:  
• The incidence and severity of AEs in this or other studies indicates a potential hazard  
to patients.  
• Patient  enrollment  is unsatisfactory.  
• Data  recording is inaccurate or incomplete.  
• The Investigator  of the study  site shows  serious  and/or  persistent  non-compliance with 
the clinical study protocol (CSP), the clinical research agreement, and/or applicable  
regulatory  guidelines  while conducting  the study.  
• The (central)  ethics  committee  decides  to terminate or suspend approval  for the clinical 
study or  the Investigator.  
• Investigator  is accused  of fraud (i.e., altered data,  omitted data,  or manufactured data).

 In the event that the study is terminated prematurely, the Sponsor will provide specific  
guidance to study  sites regarding end- of-study  procedures.  
 
2.3 Food  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  
The Sponsor  will obtain  approval  from FDA before  the start of the clinical trial. Written  progress  
reports will be sent to the FDA annually, or more frequently if requested by [CONTACT_8415]. All S[LOCATION_003]Rs  
will be reported within 7 (leading to death and life- threatening) or 15 (others) days to FDA.  
Unanticipated problems  involving  risks to humans  will be reported immediately to  FDA.  
 
Premature  study end or interruption of the study  is reported within  [ADDRESS_1066009]  of the Study  
The study will be carried out in accordance to the protocol and with principles enunciated in 
the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki, the guidelines of Good Clinical Practice  
(GCP) issued by [CONTACT_776202]’s requirements.  The IRBs and regulatory authorities wil l 
receive  annual  safety  and interim  reports  and be informed  about  study  stop/end  in agreement  
with local requirements.  
 
2.5 Patient  Information  and Informed  Consent  
The Investigators will explain to each participant the nature of the study, its purpose, the 
procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits and any  
discomfort it may entail. Each participant will be informed that the participation in the study is  
voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of  
consent  will not affect  his/her  subsequent  medical  assistance  and treatment.  
 
The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by  
[CONTACT_776203].  
 
All participants for the study will be provided a participant information sheet and a consent  
form describing the study and providing sufficient information for participant to make an informed decision about their participation in the study. Participants will have at least two  
hours and the opportunity to ask questions in order to decide on their participation. In the event that Informed Consent (IC) is obtained on the date that any study procedures are 
performed, the study record or subject´s c linical record will clearly show that IC was obtained 
prior to these procedures.  
 
Due to the special situation in SARS -CoV-2 infected patients including physical isolation,  
consent will be obtained in two possible ways (in accordance with the FDA Guidance on  
Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 Public Health Emergency  
Guidance for Industry, Investigators,  and Institutional  Review Boards ): 
 
Method 1:  A photograph of the signed informed consent document can be transmitted to the 
trial staff 
 
1. An unsigned consent  form is provided  to the patient by  a person  who has entered the 
room.  
2. The Investigator/designee arranges  a telephone call or video  conference  call with the 
patient (and, if desired and feasible, additional individuals requested by [CONTACT_102]  
(e.g.,  next of  kin). 
 
3. To ensure that patients are approached in a consistent fashion, a standard process  
should be used that will accomplish the following:  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  C1 [ADDRESS_1066010] -COVID -19-US, Amendment  3, Version  4.0 Dated  25 May 2021  Page 20 of 58  
 • Identification of who is on the call. 
• Review of the informed consent document with the patient by [CONTACT_3786]/designee and response to any questions  the patient  may have.  
• Verbal confirmation by [CONTACT_776204], and that they have signed and dated the 
informed  consent  document  that is in their possession.  
 
4. The patient (or an individual in the room) takes a photograph of the signed informed 
consent  document  and sends  it to the Investigator/designee.  
 
5. A trial team member enters the photograph into the trial records along with an 
attestation that states how that photograph was obtained and that it is a photograph 
of the informed  consent  document  signed by  [CONTACT_102].  
 
Method 2: A witness  can attest  to the signature,  but a photograph  of the signed informed  
consent  document  cannot  be transmitted  
 
1. An unsigned consent  form is provided to the patient by  a person who has entered  the 
room.  
 
2. The Investigator/designee arranges a three- way telephone call or video conference 
call with the patient, a witness who is not otherwise connected with the clinical  
investigation, and, if desired and feasible, additional individuals requested by [CONTACT_102] (e.g., next of kin).  Alternatively, in lieu of using a witness, a recording of the 
conversation can be made.  
 
3. To ensure  that patients  are approached  in a consistent  fashion, a  standard  process  
should be used that will accomplish the following:  
• Identification of who is on the call. 
• Review of the informed consent document with the patient by [CONTACT_3786]/designee and response to any questions  the patient  may have.  
• Verbal confirmation by [CONTACT_776204], and that they have signed and dated the informed  consent  document  that is in their possession.  
 
4. When using a witness,  documentation in the trial records  includes:  
• A signed and dated attestation by [CONTACT_776205], and  
• A signed and dated attestation by [CONTACT_737]/designee stating why the 
informed consent document signed by [CONTACT_362834] (e.g., due to potential  contami nation  of the document  by [CONTACT_345626]).  
 
The formal consent of a participant, using the approved consent form, must be obtained 
before  the participant  is submitted  to any  study  procedure.  
 
The participant should read and consider the statement befo re signing and dating the 
informed consent form and should be given a copy of the signed document. The consent  
form must also be signed and dated by [CONTACT_737] (or his designee) at the same time as  
the participant  sign, and  it will be  retained as  part of the study  records.  
 
2.6 Participant  Privacy  and Confidentiality  
The Investigator affirms and upholds the principle of the participant's right to privacy and that  
they shall comply  with applicable privacy  laws.  Especially,  anonymity  of the participants  shall

the computer  files. 
 
For data verification purposes, authorized representatives of the Sponsor, or a competent  
authority (e.g. FDA) may require direct access to parts of the medical records relevant to the 
study,  including participants’  medical history.  
 
2.7 Early  Termination  of the Study  
The Sponsor may terminate the study prematurely according to certain circumstances, for  
example:  
• ethical  concerns,  
• insufficient  participant  recruitment,  
• when the safety  of the participants  is doubtful  or at risk, respectively,  
• alterations in accepted clinical practice that make the continuat ion of a clinical trial 
unwise,  
• early  evidence  of benefit  or harm  of the experimental  intervention 
 
A DSMB will continuously monitor patients’ safety. The DSMB will independently judge and recommend on the need to halt enrollment for further evaluations or  to terminate the trial  
based on information regarding safety.  
 
2.8 Protocol  Amendments  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_183344]-Investigators  are allowed  to provide suggestions  for a protocol  amendment.  
 
Substantial amendments are only implemented after approval of the IRB(s).  Investigators  
will be notified immediately after approval and provided with updated study documents, and 
dossiers in trial registries  updated  accordingly.  
 
Under emergency circumstances, deviations from the protocol to protect the rights, safety  
and well -being of human subjects may proceed without prior approval of the sponsor and the 
FDA and IRB. Such deviations shall be documented and reported to the sponsor and the FDA/IRB  as soon as possible.  
 
All non -substantial amendments are communicated to the FDA as soon as possible if  
applicable and to the IRB within  the Annual  Safety  Report  (ASR).

 3. BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
 
3.1 Background  and Rationale  
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was reported in 
Wuhan, Hubei Province China. On 9 January 2020, China Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) reported a novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV) as the causative agent of this  
outbreak,  which  is phylogenetically  in the Severe Acute  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_82211]  (SARS)  
coronaviruses (CoV) clade. It rapi[INVESTIGATOR_41330], resulting in an epi[INVESTIGATOR_487727],  
followed  by [CONTACT_776206].  In February  
2020,  the World  Health  Organization (WHO) designated the disease  COVID -19, which  stands  
for coronavirus disease 2019. The virus that causes COVID -19 is designated severe acute  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV-2). As of 14 April 2020 SARS -CoV-2 has  
spread globally  with over 1,920,000  identified  cases worldwid e with over 119,000 deaths2. The 
WHO  declared COVID -19 a global pandemic on  March  2020.  
 
SARS- CoV-2 is a single- stranded enveloped RNA virus, which targets cells through the viral  
structural spi[INVESTIGATOR_776139]- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.  
The clinical spectrum of COVID -19 ranges from asymptomatic carriers to respi[INVESTIGATOR_776140] (ICU).  In the largest report of COVID - 
19 from the Chinese CDC 81% of 72,313 cases were of mild nature (stage I)3. However, a 
subgroup of 5% presented with respi[INVESTIGATOR_776141]- organ  dysfunction leading to death  
in half of the cases  (stage III). 
 
Figure  [ADDRESS_1066013] reasons and factors promoting progression from stage I to stage III are not yet  
known. Stage I (mild infection) is characterized by [CONTACT_776207] -CoV-[ADDRESS_1066014] em. In stage II (pulmonary involvement with (IIa) or without (IIb) hypoxia)  
patients develop viral pneumonia which is characterized not only by [CONTACT_776208] a localized inflammatory response. Clinically, patients present with fever, dry cough and dyspnea. Computerized tomography (CT) scans of the chest reveal uni - or bilateral  
ground -glass  opacities,  which  are related  to an increased  fluid content  in the alveoli  of the lung.  
Affected  individuals  will usually  require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776142].  About  20% of stage  II 
patients  will progress  into the most  severe  stage of illness  (stage  III), which  is characterized  

Clinical  Study  Protocol  C1 [ADDRESS_1066015] -COVID -19-US, Amendment  3, Version  4.0 Dated  25 May 2021  Page 23 of 58  
 by a systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome leading to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]  
(ARDS).  These patients  usually  require admission to the ICU for escalation of medial  
management  including  mechanical  ventilation5. In this stage,  COVID -19 infection  is associated  
with a decrease in suppressor and regulatory T cell counts and an extensive release of  
proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers such as interleukin (IL) -2, IL -6, ferritin, and D - 
dimer6, 7, called  a “cytokine  storm”,  which  is thought  to be the major  driver  of severe pneumonia 
caused by [CONTACT_7544]- CoV-2. 
 
No proven or approved effective treatment for COVID -[ADDRESS_1066016] immune system remains poorly understood but likely involves several immune cells and 
inflammatory  plasmatic  cascades  such  as the complement  and the kinin-kallikrein  (KK) 
system.  
 
The complement system (CS) is an integral part of the innate immune system and consists of  
a number  of distinct  plasma proteins  that act as a first line of defense inducing an inflammatory  
response after opsonization of pathogens and dying cells8, 9. Inflammatory responses include  
the activation of macrophages, neutrophils, platelets and endothelial cells, interacting wit h 
other plasmatic cascades such as the coagulation cascade and direct cell injury, thereby  
[CONTACT_776209]. The CS and particularly the lectin pathway  
of complement has been found to interact with and be involved in the c learance of several  
viruses10-14. While the CS does not seem to be critical for controlling CoV replication,  
unregulated  complement  activation  - induced by [CONTACT_776210] - plays  a 
crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI).  Indeed, an animal model suggests  
that the CS mediates SARS -CoV-induced lung disease and regulates the proinflammatory  
response.  Complement deficient mice infected with SARS -CoV were affec ted less severely  
and showed a reduced lung involvement  and lower  local and systemic cytokine  levels  
compared to control mice15. In line, inhibition of complement C5a signaling alleviated lung 
damage in animal infection models using MERS -CoV5516 and an influenza H7N917. Similar  
results  were  reported with inhibition  of complement  cascade C3a in an animal  infection  model  
using avian influenza18. Recently, Gao T et al. investigated the interaction of MERS -CoV,  
SARS- CoV and SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_1066017] of complement in more detai l19. They  
demonstrate an interaction of these highly pathogenic CoV with mannose- binding lectin  
associated serine  protease- 2 (MASP- 2), the key activator  of the lectin  pathway  of 
complement20, leading to uncontrolled activation of  the complement  cascade.  In line, MASP - 
[ADDRESS_1066018] in particular,  
seems to contribute to ALI in response to infection with CoV such as SARS -CoV-2 leading to  
the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_776143] -19 infection  and consequently  to ARDS.  
 
Besides the CS, the KK system may be involved in the pathogenesis of COVID -19, too.  The 
KK system is a plasmatic cascade that after activation (shear stress of vessels, e.g. during  
vascular  inflammation)  and subsequent  cleavage of kininogen by [CONTACT_776211].  Bradykinin binds to B2- receptors on endothelial cells leading to capi[INVESTIGATOR_776144].  After enzymatic degradation bradykinin products may also bind to B1 - 
receptors  on endothelial  cells that are upregulated  under  proinflammatory  conditions  and have 
strong  vasopermeable capacity.  Although  direct  evidence is lacking,  several  facts  argue  for 
Clinical  Study  Protocol  C1 [ADDRESS_1066019] activation by [CONTACT_776212] -2, was found to upregulate B2 
receptors on endothelial cells26. Moreover, bradykinin release by [CONTACT_776212] -1 mediated cleavage  
of kininogen was demonstrated27. Lastly, the enzyme that degrades bradykinin is identical to 
the inactivator  of the complement  anaphylato xins C3a and C5a28. In summary,  the KK system  
may be involved in COVID -19, particularly in stage II and III contributing to pulmonary edema 
and subsequently  ARDS.  
 
C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH) is a member of the serpin superfamily of serine- protease  
inhibitors.  It is an acute- phase protein that has manifold targets and biological functions,  
including inhibition of leucocytes and interactions with endothelial cells and microorganisms.  
C1INH is a strong inhibitor of the CS, factor XII and plasma kallikrein of the KK system.  In 
particular, C1INH is the natural inhibitor of the lectin pathway of complement. MASP -[ADDRESS_1066020] of  
the CS29. Decreased plasmatic antigenic levels of C1INH result in uncontrolled production of  
vasoactive peptides, which leads to the characteristic epi[INVESTIGATOR_776145] (HAE)
30. C1INH deficiency seems to cause uncontrolled  
activation of MASP -1, which may aggravate HAE 31. Currently, four C1INH preparations are 
available,  three  of them  plasma- derived and one recombinant,  i.e., rhC1INH (rhC1INH,  
Ruconest®, Pharming,  Leiden,  The Netherlands).  rhC1INH shares  an identical  protein  
structure with plasma -derived C1INH (pdC1INH) but has a different glycosylation pattern  
(containing abundant oligomannose residues), which is responsible for a shorter half -life than  
pdC1INH (3h vs. 30h)32, 33. Although comparable inhibition for most target proteases was  
demonstrated (including C1s, Factor XIa, XIIa and kallikrein)33, rhC1INH seems to target the  
activation of the lectin pathway more effectively compared to plasma -derived preparations34. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_776146], major adverse events or  
unique toxicities have not been demonstrated in previous studies with the exception of a  
potential  risk of allergic  reactions  in patients  with rabbit  dander  allergy.  
 
Although data on C1INH treatment in the context of SARS or influenza infections are lacking,  
results from pi[INVESTIGATOR_776147] C1INH treatment may reduce the collateral damage 
caused by [CONTACT_776213]35-37. Also, reduced occurrence of capi[INVESTIGATOR_776148] a further study38. 
C1INH was also able to block MASP -2 mediated overactivation of the complement system  
induced by [CONTACT_776214]19. 
 
In the context of COVID -19, rhC1INH treatment may: 1) dampen uncontrolled complement  
activation and collateral  lung damage by [CONTACT_776215]- [ADDRESS_1066021] activation; and 2) reduce capi[INVESTIGATOR_776149], inhibition of MASP- [ADDRESS_1066022] of care (SOC)  in patients  admitted  for stage  II COVID -[ADDRESS_1066023]  (treatment,  device)  and Indication

Acute and repeat dose toxicology and safety pharmacology as well as local tolerance studies  
in rats, dogs and  rabbits  support  the safety -in-use of the rhC1INH  preparation.  
 
The acute studies  showed no overt  toxicological  effects  in rats and dogs  with a single  dose up 
to 1250 U/kg.  A No -Observed- Adverse -Effect -Level (NOAEL) was established at 625 U/kg 
when dosed by [CONTACT_776216] 14 days  in rats and by [CONTACT_776217]  (5 mL/min)  
for 5 days in dogs.  In the 14- day pi[INVESTIGATOR_776151] , the NOAEL  
was established at  twice  daily IV infusions  of 1000  U/kg.

RhC1INH is predominantly cleared from the circulation by [CONTACT_776218].  It is more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_776153], dogs  and cynomolgus  monkeys  in comparison  with plasma-  
derived C1-INH. This faster  clearance likely  results  from the differential  glycosylation,  
including a lower  degree of sialylation  in rhC1INH.  Degradation is expected to be by 
[CONTACT_377365]/hydrolysis  within  intracellular  lysosomes.  From studies  in rats, dogs,  and 
cynomolgus monkeys, it can be concluded that rhC1INH distribution is limited to the vascular  
compartment.  For further  information,  see the IB. 
 
RhC1INH has not been assessed  in preclinical  models  of COVID -19 or related CoV infections.  
However,  pdC1INH treatment  was shown to reduce the activation of the CS and KK system  in 
a large- animal model of septic shock. Importantly, release of proinflammatory cytokines such  
as TNF- α and IL- 6 was attenuated 40. In addition, administration of rhC1INH reduced lung  
tissue damage in an animal model of hemorrhage induced systemic inflammation.  In 
particular, rhC1INH decreased tissue complement activat ion and deposition and circulating 
proinflammatory cytokines41. 
 
3.4 Clinical Evidence to Date  
RhC1INH has not been assessed in patients with COVID -19 or related CoV infections in a  
clinical trial s etting. RhC1INH has been extensively investigated in the treatment of acute  
attacks in patients with hereditary angioedema having demonstrated efficacy and safety  
(please, see IB for further details).  In addition, a recent randomized, double- blind, placebo-  
controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_776154]42. 
 
With regards  to infection and inflammation,  pdC1INH treatment  reduced  the collateral  damage  
caused by [CONTACT_776219][INVESTIGATOR_7602]35-37. In particular,  
it decreased complement and neutrophil activation43. Also, a reduced occurrence of capi[INVESTIGATOR_776148] a further study in line

3.5 Dose  Rationale  / Medical  Device:  Rationale  for the Intended Purpose  in Study  
(pre- market  MD)  
 
Pharmacological  Characteristics  
A phase 1, dose -escalating study in 12 asymptomatic patients with HAE demonstrated that  
rhC1INH administration provides a dose- dependent restoration of complement homeostasis.  
Patients with functional C1- INH levels <40% and C4 levels <300 μg/mL (values expectable in  
patients with HAE) received 2 IV doses of rhC1INH (range 6.25 to 100 U/kg), with a washout  
period of ≥5 weeks.  A dose- dependent, biologic activity was demonstrated by [CONTACT_776220] C4, which is a substrate for activated C1s: 12 hours after rhC1INH  
administration  (100 U/kg),  the mean  plasma levels  of C4 were  approximately  double compared  
to baseline.  Comparable results were shown after the 50 U/kg dose of rhC1INH, which was  
associated  with a maximum C4 level of approximately  1.76-fold that at baseline,  achieved after 
10.7 hours.  
 
A pharmacokinetic modelling indicated that a single IV injection of rhC1INH at a dose of 50  
U/kg restores functional C1- INH levels to at least the lower limit of the normal range in almost  
all patients45. 
 
Following  the slow IV administration (15 min) of 50 U/kg of rhC1INH to 6 asymptomatic  patients  
with HAE, the mean maximum plasmatic level of functional C1- INH was 1.36 U/mL, mean 
volume of distribution  was similar  to plasma volume  (approximately  3 L), mean elimination  half- 
life was 2.4  hours and  clearance  was approximately 23 mL/min46. 
The pharmacokinetic data derived from the phase [ADDRESS_1066027]  3 weeks.  14 patients  received a total of 59 administrations  of rhC1INH  
at a dosage of 100 U/kg.  The mean elimination half -life was 2.7 hours and the baseline 
corrected Cmax was 2.6 U/mL.  These values were comparable to those estimated in other  
studies.  The course of functional C1- INH levels after infusion of 100 U/kg of rhC1INH was  
identical  after 1st, 3rd and 5th administration.  
 
RhC1INH is cleared via mannose/asialoglycoprotein receptors on macrophages and hepatic  
cells with carbohydrate recognition.  RhC1INH is not expected to be excreted, but to be fully  
eliminated by [CONTACT_776221].  As there are no clinical data with rhC1INH in patients  with hepatic  
impairment,  and as hepatic  impairment  may prolong the plasma  half-life of rhC1INHrhC1 -INH, 
patients with  chronic liver  disease will be excluded  from study participation.  
 
Safety  
The clinical safety data analysis demonstrated that rhC1INH at doses of 50 and 100 U/kg are  
generally safe and well tolerated when administered for treatment of acute attacks in patients  
with HAE47. The adverse event profile found in the randomized, placebo- controlled studies  
was similar  for patients  treated  in the rhC1INH and  saline treatment  groups.  
 
Throughout the clinical development, no safety signal related to hematology, biochemistry,  
coagulation, urinalysis, vital signs, or ECG parameters was noted.  Evidence regarding a 
thrombogenic risk of rhC1INH has not been recorded during clinical development and clinical  
studies.  RhC1INH  had no effect on activation  of coagulation and fibrinolysis48. 
 
Because rhC1INH is derived from the milk of transgenic  rabbits  and contains  a small 
percentage  (0.002%)  of Host-Related  Impurities  (HRI),  immunogenicity  was extensively  tested  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  C1 [ADDRESS_1066028]  
rabbit allergy were administered rhC1INH by [CONTACT_776222] –  in case of lack of allergic  
response – an intradermal and subcutaneous injection. Two out of twenty patients revealed a  
positive response, suggesting that even in patients with a pre -existing allergy to rabbits the 
risk of  a hypersensitivity  reaction  upon administration  of rhC1INH is limited.  
 
Lastly,  safety  was favorable  with no related  or treatment -emergent  adverse events  in a recent  
double- blind,  placebo- controlled trial in elderly  patients  undergoing elective  coronary  
angiography42. 
 
Description and Justification of Route of Administration  and Dosage  
Because C1- INH is a plasma glycoprotein, an IV route of administration has been chosen for  
the existing indication (acute attacks in patients with HAE).  The same route of administration 
will be used in this  study.  
 
The approved dose for treatment of acute attacks in patients with HAE is 50 U/kg (up to 4200  
U), with an option  to repeat  the dose  once  based on clinical symptoms.  Studies  on prophylactic  
usage at a dose of 50 U/kg (up to 4200 U) twice weekly, up to 4 weeks, to treat patients with  
HAE with frequent acute attacks appeared efficacious and well tolerated.  Maximum doses  
(4200 U or 8400 U) have  been  administered to patients weighing  84 kg or more.  
 
In the current study, rhC1INH (150 U/ml) at a 50 U/kg dose (max dose of 4200 U) will be 
administered as a slow IV injection over a period in approximately 5 minutes every 12 -hours  
for 4 days.  The dosage  regimen was chosen  based on the following  rationale  
- Although C1INH antigenic  concentrations  are often  elevated in patients  with infections  
(C1INH is an acute phase reactant), the functional acti vity may be compromised as a 
consequence of modified/cleaved and consequently inactive C1INH49. 
- The half -life of rhC1INH is 2.5 hours, hence in order to achieve a sustained inhibition  
of the CS and KK system,  repeated administration  has been chosen.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_776155]-life sustained inhibition of the target proteases may be guaranteed related to the  
irreversible inhibition of target proteases followed by [CONTACT_776223].  
In order  to balance  effectivity with practicability  and potential  toxicity  we decided to limit 
the total daily  dose and administer  rhC1INH every  12 hours.  
- Repeated administration of rhC1INH over four days  has been chosen,  as 
hyperinflammation  may develop several  days  after the admission,  in particularly  during 
the time of seroconversion (development of antibodies against SARS -CoV-2)[ADDRESS_1066029].  
Participants will either receive rhC1INH plus SOC or only SOC.  SOC may include treatment  
for underlying comorbidities and management of COVID -19 symptoms. Importantly, local  
treatment p rotocols including drugs with perceived benefits in COVID -19 infections such as  
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  are allowed  as long as they are declared as SOC.  In order  to facilitate  patient  
recruitment  in a time of restricted human and financial  resources,  and because of an objective  
primary  endpoint,  a placebo group will be  omitted.  
 
Diphenhydramine, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin are associated with prolongation of  
the cardiac  QT interval,  and subsequent increased risk of fatal cardiac  arrhythmia.  
 
Cardi ovascular monitoring will be conducted in severely -ill subjects receiving multiple drugs  
on a case -by-case  adjudication of any prolongation of QT intervals  to evaluate the benefit -risk 
of continued participation in the clinical study.  
 
3.7 Risks  / Benefits  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_776156] a benefit of rhC1INH in the setting of hyperinflammation, it is  
unclear if participants in the current study will receive any immediate benefit from treatment  
with rhC1INH. However, the knowledge gained from this study m ay help to better understand  
the pathophysiology  of ALI and hyperinflammation in SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_1066030] -Related Impurities (rabbit).  Patients with medical history of allergy to  
rabbits or rabbit -derived products including rhC1INH or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_776157],  are 
excluded from participation.  
 
To minimize the risk for allergic reactions to rhC1INH, treated patients will be monitored for  
clinical symptoms  of hypersensitivity  during and after dosing.  All treatments  will be 
administered in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776158].  
 
RhC1INH was demonstrated to be a safe option for reducing the risk of contrast -induced renal  
damage in high- risk patients42. In addition, rhC1INH was safely administered to five patients  
suffering from stage  II COVID -[ADDRESS_1066031] the Investigator’s Brochure, expected adverse reactions are des cribed as follows:  
The clinical development  program  supporting safety  of rhC1INH is based on a total number  of 
268 unique patients  (up to Oct 2019).  Those [ADDRESS_1066032]  
1600 administrations of rhC1INH.  The treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that  
occurred  with onset  within  [ADDRESS_1066033]  frequently  reported  
(observed  in ≥3% of patients  treated  with rhC1INH)  were  headache  (11%),  nausea,  and 
Clinical  Study  Protocol  C1 [ADDRESS_1066034] -COVID -19-US, Amendment  3, Version  4.0 Dated  25 May 2021  Page 30 of 58  
 diarrhea (3% each).  There was no evidence of an increase in the percentages  of patients  with 
TEAEs or related TEAEs, or in the seriousness or severity of TEAEs, with increases in 
rhC1INH dose,  treatment  of a larger  number  of attacks,  and/or  treatment  of a single  attack  with 
an additional dose.  
 
As described in the US prescribing information for rhC1INH, AEs of headache, sneezing,  
angioedema, erythema marginatum, skin burning sensation, back pain, C -reactive protein  
increased, fibrin D -dimer i ncreased, vertigo, lipoma, nausea, and diarrhea occurred in ≥2% of  
rhC1INH -treated patients.  Note  that AEs are listed  in the US prescribing information 
regardless a causal relationship with rhC1INH. The frequency of adverse reactions listed  
above is defin ed using the following convention:  
• Very common  (≥1/10),  
• Common  (≥1/100 to <1/10),  
• Uncommon  (≥1/1,000  to <1/100),  
• Rare  (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000),  
• Very rare (<1/10,000),  
 
Specific antidotes against rhC1INH do not exist.  In the unlikely event of an allergic reaction,  
standard  treatment  regimens  indicated by [CONTACT_510510] (e.g. epi[INVESTIGATOR_238],  
antihistamines,  corticosteroids,  etc.) will be administered.  
 
The level of  risk may evolve over  time,  during the study:  consequently,  a Data Safety  
Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor the safety of all patients, as well as the continuing validity and scientific  merit  of the study.  
 
3.8 Justification  of Choice of  Study  Population  
Approximately 20% of patients with COVID -[ADDRESS_1066035] X -Ray. Approximately 15- 20% of these patients will progress to severe ALI  
requiring mechanical ventilation and ICU support. Patients with confirmed COVID -19 disease  
(based on a positive  SARS- CoV-2 PCR result)  and admitted to a non-ICU ward  will be eligible  
for the study.  This population was chosen, as anti -inflammatory treatments such as rhC1INH  
may interfere most effectively during stage II disease, i.e . during the early inflammatory  
response phase.  In addition,  interventions that  prevent patients from  deteriorating and  
requiring mechanical ventilation are highly desired and represent an area of unmet clinical  
need  in a pandemic  situation with limited  ICU and ventilation support  capacity.  This population 
offers  the opportunity  to impact  not only on  an individual  but also on a population level.

 7.4 Criteria  for Withdrawal  / Discontinuation  of Participants  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time without having to 
provide a reason.  Subjects may be withdrawn because of the appearance of a new health  
condition requiring care or medications prohibited by [CONTACT_760], unacceptable adverse  
event, refusal to continue treatment, or at the Investigator’s discretion if it is in the subject’s  
best interest.  
 
A subject who withdraws informed consent before randomization or who develops a violation 
of the selection criteria  before randomization is defined as a screening failure.  No follow- up of 
screening failures  will be performed.  
 
Participants who withdraw informed consent, who do not fulfil inclusion/exclusion criteria after  
obtaining informed consent or who are diagnosed with an alternative disease (e.g. influenza  
infection)  AND have  not received any study  medication will be withdrawn  from the study.  
 
Participants who experience a type I allergic reaction after any dose of study medication will  
be discontinued from further study interventions. Withdrawn or discontinued participants will  
not be  replaced.  Follow -up for all patient groups  will be explained in Section 8.5. 
 
 
8. STUDY  INTERVENTION  
 
8.1 Identity  of Investigational  Products  (treatment  / medical  device)  
8.1.1 Experimental  Intervention  (treatment)  
RhC1INH (Ruconest®) will be supplied by [CONTACT_776231],  
B.V.,  the Netherlands.  RhC1INH is a recombinant  analogue of human  C1-INH for intravenous  
injection.  The primary  and secondary  structures  of the molecule and target  protease  selectivity  
are consistent with those of plasma -derived C1-INH. RhC1INH is purified from the milk of  
transgenic rabbits, and supplied as a sterile, preservative- free, white/off -white lyophilized  
powder for reconstitution for injection.  RhC1INH contains less than 0.002% of rabbit -related  
impurities.  One internat ional unit (U) of rhC1INH activity is defined as the equivalent of C1-  
INH activity present in [ADDRESS_1066051] ered as a slow intravenous  
injection over approximately five minutes. Recommended doses of rhC1INH for the treatment  
of an acute angioedema attack are 50 U/kg if body weight <84kg and 4200 U if >84kg.  A 
second dose may be administered at the same recommended dose level within a 24- hour 
period.  In this study,  we will not use the product  according to the licensed indication.  A market  
batch  will be used  for the study.

 the glass vial of rhC1INH are labelled as ‘Ruconest® (C1 esterase inhibitor [recombinant]),  
powder for solution for injection. For intravenous infusion 2100U/vial’. One vial contains 2100 
U of rhC1INH, corresponding to 2100 U/14 ml after reconstitution, or a concentration of 150 
U/ml.  
8.1.4 Storage  Conditions  
RhC1INH will be stored at 2-25ºC  at the pharmacy  of the study  sites (shelf  life 48 months  when  
stored at 2 -25°C, prior to reconstitution) in a dedicated, secure and temperature- monitored  
study room at the in- house pharmacy which will be inaccessible to unauthorized personnel.  
Drug accountability will be monitored according to ICH -GCP E6 (R2) Guideline for Good 
Clinical Practice.  More  details are described  in the Study  Pharmacy  Manual.  
 
8.2 Administration  of Experimental  and Control  Interventions  
8.2.1 Experimental  Intervention  
RhC1INH (Ruconest®) will be administered at (150 U/ml)  at a 50 U/kg dose  (max  dose of 4200 
U) as a slow intravenous  injection via a peripheral  or central  intravenous  line in approximately  
5 minutes every 12 hours; for 4 days.  A total of 8 doses will be administered.  (The licensed 
dosage for rhC1INH is weight -based (50 U/kg up to 84 kg and 4200  U for a bodyweight  of >84 
kg). This is based on the aim to at least achieve a level of 0.7 U/ml C1- INH in patients with  
hereditary angioedema (lower limit of normal of C1- INH activity). Simulation studies have 
revealed that this aim is achievable with the  licensed dosing45. 
 
However, these simulations have also shown that C1 -INH levels will be lower when using 50  
U/kg compared  to 4200 U in patients  with a bodyweight  < 84kg.  As for the current  trial the aim 
is not to correct  underlying absolute C1-INH deficiency  (as in case  of hereditary  angioedema),  
but to ensure that a level of at least  twice  the serum  concentration  will be achieved in the vast 
majority  of patients, we  will use  the licensed dose.  
 
In patients with normal C1- INH levels, the chosen dose will increase plasma C1- inhibitor  
activities by [CONTACT_2669] 100% (4200 U) respectively.  To maximize efficacy rhC1INH will be  
administered repeatedly over 4 days.  Maximal volume of the injection is 28ml (4200 U) per  
administration.  
 
Repeated  administration  of rhC1INH was chosen for several  reasons.  First, hyperinflammation 
caused by [CONTACT_7544]- CoV-[ADDRESS_1066053],  a decline of C-INH activity  to pre-administration levels  was 
demonstrated  within  four to six hours  after administration  of rhC1INH at a dose of 50 U/kg46. 
 
Duration of exposure to rhC1INH will be approximately [ADDRESS_1066054] dose and via structured telephone interviews four  
weeks later.  
8.2.2 Control  Intervention  
Participants  in the control  arm will receive  SOC  treatment  according to local guidelines.  
 
8.3 Dose  / Device Modifications  
The only modification will be omission of subsequent doses of rhC1INH if the participant  
develops a type [ADDRESS_1066055] and  
subsequent syringes will be entered into the electronic prescribing system/chart or added to 
the paper chart.  As this study involves IV administration of the IMP by [CONTACT_39137], patient  
compliance measures are not necessary.  IMP will be administered by a nurse according to  
the site’s standard procedures.  Two nurses will check the IMP with respect to dose, study  
number and patient’s identity before administration to the patient. Nurses will document the  
syringe number  and the time of administration  in the electronic  or paper  chart.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1066056]  supportive care established at the sites which  may include 
off-label  use of certain drugs  that are deemed to be effective  in COVID -19 (e.g. 
hydroxychloroquin,  lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir).  In addition,  escalation of treatment  with off-label  use of 
certain drugs  (e.g. tocilizumab)  in deteriorating participants  is allowed  during the trial. 
 
In terms  of risk, rhC1INH,  a recombinant  human  protein,  has a very favorable side effect  profile  
and major adverse events attributable to study medication are not expected in this study.  
Anaphylactic  reactions  are exceptionally  rare and have only been  observed  in a single  patient  
with a pre-existent  allergy  to rabbits.  Although  patients  with rabbit  allergy  will be excluded  from 
participating in the study, included subjects will be monitored for anaphylactic events during  
and for at least [ADDRESS_1066057] administration of rhC1INH.  If patients develop type 1 
allergic reactions following the administration of rhC1INH treatment according to in- house  
guidelines (potentially invol ving administration of antihistamines, corticosteroids, intravenous  
fluids and if  needed adrenaline)  will be provided.  
 
No influence of rhC1INH on laboratory  parameters  or vital signs,  including ECG  was observed 
in previous clinical studies.  Hence, we will not perform additional laboratory monitoring  
exceeding routine laboratory controls planned by [CONTACT_333618] (with the exception of the  
above- mentioned additional  biomarker  analyses).  No interactions  with other  drugs  are known.  
 
If female,  patients  must  be/have:  
• Post-menopausal,  defined as the absence of menses for  at least  one year, OR  
Surgically  sterile,  defined as a bilateral  tubal  ligation  at least  [ADDRESS_1066058] -COVID -19-US, Amendment  3, Version  4.0 Dated  25 May 2021  Page 38 of 58  
 • Using  an effective  means  of contraception  with a failure  rate less than 1% per year (e.g. 
oral contraceptives,  contraceptive injections,  intrauterine device,  double- barrier  
method,  male partner  sterilization), OR  
• A negati ve pregnancy test before study entry/randomization.  We expect the rate of  
female patients of childbearing age who may become pregnant to be <10% of all  
patients potentially eligible for this study.  Due to the short treatment period (4 days)  
and half-life of rhC1INH (2.5 hours)  an effective  means  of contraception is not 
mandatory  during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776163].  At least  one method of 
contraception (oral contraceptives,  barrier  methods,  approved contraceptive implant  or 
abstinence)  is required  for the entire  follow up  study  period 
• Concomitant  Interventions  (treatments)  
All participants  will receive  standard  supportive care established  at the sites which  may include  
off-label  use of certain drugs  that are deemed to be effective  in COVID -19 (e.g. 
hydroxychloroquin, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir, prophylactic anticoagulation).  In addition, escalation of  
treatment with off -label use of certain drugs (. tocilizumab) in deteriorating participants is  
allowed during the trial.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_776233].  Off-label use of drugs for the treatment of COVID -[ADDRESS_1066059].  
 
Patients  are allowed  to use all their regular  medication during the trial. In addition,  patients  will 
receive all drugs  required for the treatment  of COVID -19 or its consequences.  The care of the 
participant  will remain unaffected by [CONTACT_776234].  
 
8.7 Study  Drug  / Medical  Device Accountability  
The in-house Pharmacy  will be responsible for maintaining accurate  drug storage and 
dispensing logs including records  about  shipments  to the trial sites,  return  to the Sponsor  and 
document on-site destruction if applicable.  Drugs will be stored in accordance with GCP and  
GMP  requirements  and will be inaccessible to unauthorized  personnel.  Lot/batch  numbers  will 
be recorded.  All unused and used rhC1INH vials will be retained at the site until drug inventory  
has been completed  by [CONTACT_35717].  
 
The study staff will use study drugs only within the framework of this clinical study and in  
accordance with this protocol.  Receipt, distribution, return, and destruction (if any) of study  
drugs will be properly documented.  Accountability records will include dates, quantities,  
batch/serial  numbers,  expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659],  and patient  numbers  and sign off by [CONTACT_776235].  These records will adequately document that the patients were provided the doses as  
specified in the protocol  and should allow reconciliation activities  from Monitor  for all rhC1INH 
received from the Sponsor. The drug accountability process will be described in further detail  
separately  in the Monitoring Manual.  
 
8.8 Return or Destruction  of Study  Drug  / Medical  Device  
Any study product that remains unused at the termination of the study will be returned to the 
manufacturer or destroyed in accordance with institutional policies and this process will be  
recorded.

• For the analysis of the proportion of patients alive and not having required invasive or  
non-invasive ventilation at 14 days after enrollment, admission to ICU with invasive or  
non-invasive  ventilation  or death  will be assessed  every  day until day 14. 
• For the analysis of the proportion of patients with ALI within 14 days after enrollment,  
PaO 2/FiO [ADDRESS_1066067]  
• The following  assessments  will be performed  during the study:  changes  in WHO  ordinal  
scale,  ICU admission/discharge date,  mechanical  ventilation start/end date,  
admission/discharge  date,  all-cause mortality  within  4 weeks.  
• Supportive interventions provided to study subjects in addition to ventilatory support  
(e.g., the use of prone  ventilation,  high- frequency  oscillatory  ventilation  (HFOV),  
paralytics,  pulmonary  vasodilators.  
• The receipt of additional anti -inflammatory treatments such as tocilizumab will be 
recorded  within 14 days.  
• Vital signs will be recorded until discharge to determine the time to defervesence and 
clinical improvement.  
• For the analysis of virological clearance of SARS -CoV-2, samples from the upper or  
lower  respi[INVESTIGATOR_776167] (if not already  performed on

9.1.4 Assessment  of Safety  Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse events  
Participants will be followed for adverse events and outcomes for [ADDRESS_1066070] treatment  
(Day 0). Assessments will be done daily while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776168] a weekly follow -up 
telemedicine interview or  telephone call after  discharge.  
 
Adverse events and clinical course including death within [ADDRESS_1066071]-treatment.  If 
necessary, medical charts will be reviewed, discharge summaries will be reviewed, or the  
patients’  general  practitioner will be contact[CONTACT_776238]- up information.  
Every effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_776239] -up. 
Conditions that started before signing informed consent will be recorded as medical history.  
Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing informed consent will be documented as  
AE. Definition  of AE and  SAE will be  found in Section 10.  
 
All AEs will be assessed and documented by [CONTACT_776240],  
intensity, causal relationship with study treatment, action taken with study treatment ( e.g. 
withdrawal),  specific  treatment  for AE and outcome.  In addition,  time of onset  and AE duration  
will be recorded.  Procedures  are defined in Section 10. AEs will be recorded on the respective  
CRF pages.  Participants  will be asked about  any new events/complaints  during the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222627] [ADDRESS_1066072] treatment.  In addition,  participants  are asked to report  
any new events  including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776169].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Laboratory  parameters  
Previous  studies  of rhC1INH have not shown any influence of rhC1INH on laboratory  
parameters.  Hence, we will not perform additional laboratory monitoring exceeding routine 
laboratory  controls  planned  by [CONTACT_776241].  If laboratory  findings  reveal  abnormal  values,  
they will be documented and reported as an AE if deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_776242].

No study specific vital signs will be assessed.  All patients will be monitored regarding blood  
pressure,  heart  rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_776170] -19 patients.  
9.1.5 Assessments in Participants  Who Prematurely  Stop  the Study  
Patients who are withdrawn from the study will remain in the trial for the purpose of follow -up 
and data analysis and  will be followed  as planned with the following  exceptions:  
- Patients, who withdraw consent for all study measures, will be asked to have assessments  
performed  as appropriate for the final 4 week  study  visit (i.e. a structured  telephone  
interview). The same approach applies for all active study participants if the trial is stopped  
early.  Patients  who withdraw  consent  are at liberty  to refuse  any or all individual  components  
of the final assessment.  
- Patients  who are withdrawn  because they have  not received any study  medication will not be 
followed  up and will  not receive a final study  assessment.  
- Patients  who discontinue  the study  because of safety  concerns  will be followed  as planned.  
- Patient with a type I allergic reaction will be referred to an allergist associated with the site  
for further  work -up.

10. SAFETY  
 
10.1 Drug  Studies  
During  the entire  duration  of the study,  all adverse events  (AE) and all serious  adverse events  
(SAEs)  are collected,  fully investigated  and documented  in source  documents  and case  report  
forms (CRF). SAEs are to be documented on the Pharming SAE form and reported to PV  
within  [ADDRESS_1066077] protocol -specific procedure has been completed,  
including a safety  follow- up period.  
 
As the frequency  of comorbidities  in the patient  population under  study  is significant  and clinical 
complications are common in patients with COVID -19 infection, serious adverse events are  
possible in this setting.  Hence, the Sponsor will establish periodic interim safety review  
meetings  by [CONTACT_86493]  (see also Section 1.3). 
10.1.1 Definition  and Assessment  of (Serious)  Adverse Events  and Other Safety  Related  
Events  
An Adverse Event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  or a clinical  
investigation participant  administered a pharmaceutical  product,  and which  does  not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the study procedure. An AE can therefore be any  
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or  
diseas e temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether  
or not related  to the medicinal  (investigational)  product.  [ICH E6  1.2]. Any medical  conditions  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  C1 [ADDRESS_1066078] treatment  are considered as Non-Treatment  Emergent  
Adverse  Events  (TEAE).  
 
A Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  is classified  as any untoward medical  occurrence  that: 
• results  in death,  
• is life-threatening,  
• requires  in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909],  
• results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity,  or 
• is a congenital  anomaly/birth defect.  
In addition, important medical events that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in  
death, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to  
prevent  one of the other  outcomes  listed  above  should also usually  be considered serious.  
[ICH E2A ]. The EMA Important Medical Events (IME) list will be used as a reference for this.  
An elective  or pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776172] a SAE.  
Note: an AE or adverse drug reaction is considered “life- threatening” if, in view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death.  It does  
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
SAEs should be followed until resolution or stabilization.  Participants with ongoing SAEs at  
study termination (including safety visit) will be further followed up until recovery or until  
stabilization  of the disease after  termination.  
 
Regardless of the assumed causal relationship, all AE volunteered by [CONTACT_776245]/or his staff must be recorded on the AE forms. Records of  
AEs include patient data, description of the event, intensity, severity, relationship to the study  
drugs, temporal relation to the study drugs, action taken, description of outcome and  
documentation  of the results of  diagnostic  and therapeutic  measures.  
 
Assessment  of Causality 
Both Investigator and Sponsor make a causality assessment of the event to the study drug,  
based on the criteria  listed in the  ICH E2A guidelines:  
Relationship  Description  
Definitely  Temporal relationship  
Improvement  after dechallenge*  
Recurrence  after rechallenge 
(or other proof  of drug cause)  
Probably  Temporal relationship  
Improvement  after dechallenge  
No other  cause  evident  
Possibly  Temporal relationship  
Other  cause  possible  
Not related  Causal  relationship  can be ruled  out 
*Improvement  after dechallenge  only taken  into consideration,  if applicable  to reaction  
 
Unexpected Adverse Drug  Reaction  
An “unexpected”  adverse drug reaction is an adverse reaction,  the nature or severity  of which  
is not consistent  with the applicable product  information (e.g. Investigator’s  Brochure  for drugs  
that are not yet approved  and Product  Information for approved drugs,  respectively).  [ICH E2A]  
 
Suspected Unexpected  Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  
Adverse reactions are all untoward and unintended responses to an IMP related to any dose 
administered.  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  C1 [ADDRESS_1066079] -COVID -19-US, Amendment  3, Version  4.0 Dated  25 May 2021  Page 47 of 58  
  
Unexpected adverse reactions are suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions  
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  if the following  3 conditions  are met: 
 
1. The event  must  be serious.  
2. There must  be a certain degree of probability  that the event  is a harmful  and an unintended  
reaction  to the IMP, regardless  of the administered dose.  
3. The adverse reaction must be unexpected, that is to say, the nature and severity of the  
adverse reaction are not in agreement with the product information as recorded in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
The Investigator and the Sponsor evaluate any SAE that has been reported regarding  
seriousness, causality and expectedness. If the event is assessed as related, either by [CONTACT_776246], and is considered serious and unexpected, it is classifi ed as a  
S[LOCATION_003]R.  
 
Assessment  of Severity 
The Investigator  will be required  to assess  the intensity  of the AE and to record  this assessment  
in the source documents. It is important to distinguish between serious criteria and severity of  
an AE. Severity is a m easure of intensity whereas seriousness is determined by [CONTACT_776247].  Investigators  will use the following  categories  to quantify  severity.  
• Mild/grade 1: events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the  
patient’s daily  activities.  
• Moderate/grade 2: events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic  measures.  Moderate events  may cause some interference  with functioning.  
• Severe/grade 3: events interrupt  a patient’s usual  daily activity and may require  
systemic drug therapy  or other  treatment.  Severe adverse events  are usually  
incapacitating.  
• Life threatening/grade 4: potentially life- threatening or disabling. High- risk medical  
interventions.  
• Fatal/grade 5: patient  died.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event  at each  level of intensity  to be performed.  AEs characterized as intermittent  require 
documentation  of onset  and duration of  each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
10.1.2 Reporting  of Serious  Adverse Events  (SAE) and Other Safety  Related Events  
Reporting  of SAEs  
All SAEs must be reported immediately and within a maximum of 24 hours  to the Sponsor via 
email  at [EMAIL_14812]  or fax at 1 201 -389-8092.  
 
Reporting  of S[LOCATION_003]Rs  
Fatal  or life-threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs  need to be reported  to the IRB and to Competent  Authorities  
(e.g. FDA and EMA) within [ADDRESS_1066080] be reported as an SAE within 24 hours of the Investigator’s first  
knowledge of the event, even if considered non- serious and regardless or not of whether an  
(S)AE occurred.  
 
Special  situations  may include,  but are not limited  to, the following:  
• Use of a medicinal  product  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding  
• Use of a medicinal  product in a pediatric  or elderly  population  
• Reports  of overdose,  abuse,  off-label  use, misuse,  medication error  or occupational  
exposure  
• Lack  of therapeutic  efficacy 
• (Suspected)  transmission  of an infectious  agent  
 
Overdose  
For this study  any dose of rhC1INH greater  than 100 U/kg will be considered an overdose.  
 
Medication errors  
A medication error is any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or administration 
of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare professional or patient. Examples  
of medication error include, but are not limited to: wrong dose, wrong or inadequate (route of)  
administration, equipment failure, preparation error. Medication errors are reported in the 
CRF. A description of the error must be provided and whether or not the medication error  
lead to any  AE. 
 
Periodic Reporting  of Safety  
In addition to the expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs, the Sponsor will submit, once a year  
throughout  the development  program  of the IMP, a developmental  safety  update report  
(DSUR) to  the competent  authorities  (FDA and EMA)  and IRBs,  as appropriate.  
 
This safety  report  consists  of: 
 
• A list of all suspected (unexpected or expected) serious adverse reactions, along with 
an aggregated summary table of all reported serious adverse reactions, ordered by  
[CONTACT_34565], per  study.  
• A report concerning the safety of the patients, consisting of a complete safety analysis  
and an evaluation of the balance between the efficacy and the harmfulness of the medicine under  investigation.  
10.1.3 
Follow  up of (Serious)  Adverse Events  
Participants with SAEs (whether or not related to the study drug) will be monitored until  
resolution  or until the event  is considered chronic  and/or  stable by [CONTACT_80373]/or  other  
physician who has the responsibility for the subject’s medical care. Treating physicians  
including general  practitioners  will be contact[CONTACT_776248]- up results.  If necessary,  participants  
will be contact[CONTACT_776249]- up. Follow -up SAE reports  will be reported according to the 
same  timelines as  initial reports.  The  outcome of AEs will be  documented.  
 
10.1.4 Ongoing  Safety  Monitoring and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_776173] (CTCAE) Version 5.0.  A subject who experiences a treatment - 
emergent  anaphylactic/anaphylactoid  reaction  or thrombotic/thrombo- embolic  event  will not be 
permitted to receive further treatment with study drug until the review of the case, discussion  
with the treating  Investigator  and Pharmin g, and further  evaluation as required is completed.  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  C1 [ADDRESS_1066081] -COVID -19-US, Amendment  3, Version  4.0 Dated  25 May 2021  Page 49 of 58  
 Further  enrollment  into the study,  and further  rhC1INH administration in all subjects,  will be 
temporarily halted  pending a review  of the data if either  of the following  occur:  
If one or more  subjects  experience a Grade 4 or Grade  5 adverse event  possibly  related  to 
study drug  administration,  as assessed  by [CONTACT_776250],  or 
If two or more  subjects  experience a Grade  3 adverse event  possibly  related to study  drug 
administration.  
 
11. STATISTICAL  METHODS  
 
11.1 Hypothesis  
Null hypothesis: Early administration of rhC1INH in addition to SOC is not associated with an  
improved clinical outcome in admitted COVID -19 patients  as reflected by a lower  score  on the 
WHO  Ordinal Scale on  day 7 compared  to SOC alone.  
 
Alternative hypothesis:  Early administration of rhC1INH in addition to SOC is associated with 
an improved clinical outcome in admitted COVID -19 patients as reflected by a lower score on  
the WHO Ordinal Scale  on day 7  compared to SOC alone.  
 
11.2 Determination  of Sample  Size 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_776174]1INH in the prevention of clinical  
deterioration in a high-risk population with COVID -19. There is  no reliable information  
available on the clinical evolution of the population included in the trial. Therefore, a precise 
quantitative pre -definition of the sample size of a population needed to obtain clinically  
significant  primary  endpoint  is not  possible at  this point  in time.  
The assumptions which are proposed and the criteria to monitor and assess the primary  
endpoint  are as follows:  
The primary endpoint is a 7- point scale and the standard deviation σ can be expected as 1.[ADDRESS_1066082] 1 point.  Then,  the standardized difference  
is about  δ/σ = 0.67.  For a fixed  sample  size design with a two-sided significance level of α = 
0.05 and a power of 1 - β = 0.80, a sample size of N = [ADDRESS_1066083], we add 4 patients  in each group,  and because of drop-outs we add also 4 
patients  in each  group  to N = 2 x 46. For a 2:1-randomization,  a nonparametric  analysis  by [CONTACT_776251] -test, and an adaptive group sequential analysis, the overall sample  
size is estimated  as 120 = 80 + 40. 
All patients are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], and it is very unlikely that the primary endpoint at Day 7 will not  
be measured.  Nevertheless,  a drop-out rate of about  10% is included.  
Adaptive  Design:  
Two interim analyses after 32 and 80 patients are planned according to the Pocock adjusted  
levels  αp = 0.0221.  Based  on the results  of an interim  analysis  the sample  size can be adjusted  
(Lehmacher, Wassmer, 1999).  There are no prespecified futility margins, but the DSMB can  
recommend  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_776175].  
The primary efficacy endpoint and the main secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed at  
latest  at [ADDRESS_1066084] -COVID -19-US, Amendment  3, Version  4.0 Dated  25 May 2021  Page 50 of 58  
 11.4 Planned Analyses  
11.4.1 Datasets  to be Analysed, Analysis  Populat ions 
A review of the database will be conducted in a blinded manner shortly before the database  
will be locked, and any decisions made at that meeting (blinded Data Review Meeting)  
concerning the statistical analysis, e.g., additional outcomes and populati ons, pooling of sites  
for efficacy analysis,  will be documented  in the  Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP).  
 
Missing data for the primary endpoint will be imputed by [CONTACT_776252] -observation-  
carried- forward (LOCF) method, as sensitivity analyses some alternative imputation methods  
like imputation  of the mean  and multiple  imputation will be additionally performed.  
 
Safety Population:  The Safety  Population is defined as all patients  who received at least  one 
dose of rhC1INH.  Statistical analyses will be based on the actual treatment the patient  
received.  
 
Full Analysis Set/Intent -to-Treat Population: The FAS/ITT Population is defined as all  
patients who are randomly allocated to a study arm.  Statistical analyses will be based on the  
treatment  arm to which the patient  was allocated.  For quantitative data,  the number  of patients  
with non- missing information, means, medians, standard deviations and extremes will be 
determined.  For qualitative  data,  absolute and relative  frequencies  will be calculated.  
Moreover,  changes  from baseline (V2,  d0) will be  calculated.  
 
Per Protocol Population: The PP Population is defined as all patients in the FAS/ITT  
Population who complete the study and who do not have any major protocol violations,  
including the following:  
• Patients  who had major  inclusion/exclusion criteria  violations.  
 
Sufficient  compliance is expected because of IV administration of the IMP. 
The PP Population will be determined by a blinded review  in the Data  Review  Meeting (DRM)  
of the data prior to database lock. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the FAS/ITT  
Population in this superiority trial; an additional efficacy analysis will be performed on the PP  
Population.  The Safety  Population will  be used  for all safety analyses .

Two adaptive interim analyses after 32 and 80 patients are planned according to the Pocock  
adjusted levels  αp = 0.0221.  The results  of the sequential  groups  are combined  by [CONTACT_776254] - 
normal -method (Lehmacher, Wassmer, 1999).  There are no prespecified futility margins, but  
the DSMB  can stop the study  in the case of  insufficient  interim  results.  
Furthermore, 95% confidence intervals will be determined, and the results will be presented 
graphically by  [CONTACT_776199]-and-whisker  plots.

necessary.  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  C1 [ADDRESS_1066088]. 
Qualitati ve secondary study parameters will be analyzed by [CONTACT_776256].  Pairwise Chi- Square tests will be carried out in order to compare each of the 
active  treatments  to placebo.  Moreover,  95% confidence intervals  for the treatment  differences  
will be calculated.  
Other  outcomes  of interest  will be analyzed by [CONTACT_776257].  
The analyses  will be carried out by [CONTACT_776255].  
11.4.4 Interim  Analyses  
Two interim analyses after 32 and 80 patients are planned according to the Pocock adjusted  
levels  αp = 0.0221.  Based  on the results  of an interim  analysis  the sample  size can be adjusted  
(Lehmacher, Wassmer, 1999).  There are no prespecified futility margins, but the DSMB can  
recommend  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_776176].  
11.4.5 Safety  Analysis  
The assessment  of safety  will be based mainly  on the frequency  of adverse events  (AEs)  that 
are treatment -emergent (TEAEs).  Formal tests will not be conducted for differences in safety  
parameters  between treatment  groups.  
 
The incidence  of all treatment -emergent  AEs will be tabulated  after groupi[INVESTIGATOR_776177].  For each preferred term and summarized over each system organ 
class overall,  the table will present  the absolute number  and proportion (%) of patients  in each  
treatment  group in whom  the event  occurred.  The incidence of all suspected- IMP-related AEs 
will be tabulated similarly. The incidence of all treatment -emergent AEs will also be tabulated  
by [CONTACT_776258].  
 
Safety will also be summarized with respect to vital signs as mean levels by [CONTACT_776259].  Abnormal  observations on physical  exams  will be  listed.  
11.4.6 Deviation(s)  From  the Original Statistical  Plan  
Deviations  from the planned analyses  will be discussed  by [CONTACT_776260].  
 
11.5 Handling  of Missing  Data  and Drop -Outs  
Withdrawn/discontinued participants  will not be replaced.  Missing  data for the primary  variable 
will be imputed by [CONTACT_776261]-observation- carried forward  (LOCF)  method,  as 
sensitivity analyses some alternative imputation methods like imputation of the mean and 
multiple  imputation will be additionally  performed.  
 
12. QUALITY  ASSURANCE  AND  CONTROL  
The Sponsor and the local site Investigators are responsible for proper training of all involved  
study personnel and for implementing and maintaining quality assurance and quality controls  
systems with written  SOPs  and working  instructions.  All SOPs  and working  instructions  will be 
prepared and critically evaluated by [CONTACT_776262].

12.1.1 Case  Report  Forms  
Study data will be recorded in a Case Report Form (CRF). A unique study code will be used  
for identification of participants in the CRF. Subjects will not be identified in the CRF by [CONTACT_776263].  Only authorized personnel will be able to make changes on the paper case  
report form (CRF) and are responsible for entering complete data.  If source data is available  
as a print -out (e.g. laboratory values), this print -out will be kept on file in a source data folder,  
and the data necessary  for the study  is to be added to the CRF immediately.  
12.1.2 Specification  of Source Documents  
Source data include the paper and electronic records of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776178]  (AE/SAE form,  informed consent  forms,  laboratory  reports  etc.). 
Source data includes demographic data, visit dates, informed consent forms, randomization  
numbers,  SAEs,  AEs,  concomitant  medication,  results  of physical  examination and information  
related to COVID -19 infection  (e.g. data from viral sampling).  Source data may be found either  
in the electronic or paper -based records of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776179] a  
print-out of study -related  laboratory  results  which  will be mailed  to the local Investigators  from

Data  is exported  and transferred to the sponsor -Investigator  by [CONTACT_776264].  Data  will be archived  by [CONTACT_776265].  
 
12.2 Monitoring  
Monitoring will be carried  out according to a predefined monitoring  plan by [CONTACT_776266]  
(Sponsor), which is independent from the Investigators.  Study documentation and all source  
data/documents will be accessible to monitors and all questions will be answered during  
inspections.  Participants’  data will be kept strictly  confidential  during the monitoring visits.  
 
12.3 Audits  and Inspections  
Audits  may be conducted  by [CONTACT_776267].  Study  
documentation  and all source  data/documents  will be accessible  to auditors/inspectors  and all 
questions  will be answered during inspections.  Participants’  data will be kept strictly  
confidential  during the monitoring visits.  The Investigator  should contact  [CONTACT_776268].  
 
12.[ADDRESS_1066092] requires immediate intervention,  
based  on the judgment  of the Investigator  (or a responsible,  appropriately  trained professional  
designated by [CONTACT_737]).  In the event  of a significant deviation from the protocol  due to 
an emergency, accident, or mistake, the Investigator or designee must contact [CONTACT_1034],  
or their agent,  at the earliest  possible time by [CONTACT_756].  This will allow an early  joint decision  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  C1 [ADDRESS_1066093]’s continuation in the study. The Investigator and the Sponsor will  
document  this decision.  The IRB will be informed of all protocol  changes  by [CONTACT_776269]. No deviations from the protocol of any type 
will be made  without  complying with  all the IRB established procedures.  
Any protocol deviations that will affect the subject’s safety or the study objectives may be  
considered Major Protocol Deviations upon review by [CONTACT_1034].  In addition, the following  
will be classified as  Major  Protocol Deviations:  
• Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
• Informed  Consent  not properly  obtained 
• Study  Drug  dosing variation 
• SAE not reported  in a timely  manner  
 
12.[ADDRESS_1066094]  confidentiality  is guaranteed.  In any publication and/or  presentation,  
information will be provided in such a way that the participants cannot be identified, except  
with their permission and individual patient data will not be shown.  Direct access to source  
documents  will be permitted for the purpose of monitoring,  audits  and inspections  by [CONTACT_776270].  
 
12.6 Storage  of Biological  Material  and Related  Health  Data  
Blood and urine samples will be stored at -80°C in a dedicated freezer with limited access to  
unauthorized personal.  The same applies to study data, which will be stored in a password 
secured database, and maintained by [CONTACT_776271].  All data including samples and  
source  data (patients’ charts)  are stored for ten years.  
 
13. PUBLICATION AND DISSEMINATION POLICY  
Data  derived from this  clinical trial is considered to be the property  of Pharming Technologies

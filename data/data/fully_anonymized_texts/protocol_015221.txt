VERSION(S) 
 
 
Version 2.0 ( dated April  8, 2016) compared  to Version 1.0 (dated June 5, 2015) . This amendment is 
considered substantial due to a change in exclusion criteria (to exclude subjects who were previously 
enrolled in a clinical study with caplacizumab and received caplacizumab or for whom the as signed 
treatment arm is unknown) and removal  of the planned interim analysis.  
Version n° and date were adapted throughout the document (including headers and footers).  The Table of Contents 
and List of Abbreviations was updated and the Section “Changes Compared to Previous Version(s)” was completed.  
Original section  Change/Rationale  
Approval of Clinical Study Protocol  Due to an update of the Sponsor’s standard operating procedure on 
protocol writing, Clinical Study Protocols are no longer signed by [CONTACT_513520].  
Synopsis, Sections 2, 3.1.1., 3.1.3., 
3.6.2. and 3.6.4.  Key and other secondary endpoints ha ve been reworded and reordered in 
view of hierarchical statistical testing for the key secondary endpoints. In addition, the interim analysis of efficacy has been removed and the 
description of analysis of key secondary endpoints has been updated to reflec t the hierarchical testing. 
The secondary objectives have been 
reworded to correspond to the rewording of the secondary endpoints.  
Synopsis , Schedule of Assessments,  
Sections 3.1.1.,  3.3.5. and 3.3.6.  For clarity, the statement “(with) in the same day” /”within 1 day”  has been 
reworded to “(with)in 24 hours”.  
Synopsis, Sections 1 and 8  Reference 1 has been replaced by a new reference as the original one is no 
longer applicable (due to the removal of the interim analysis).  
Synopsis , Sections 3.1.1.,  3.2.1, and 
3.3.[ADDRESS_665204] PE (i.e., PE administered prior to randomization) and the start of the first PE after randomization ( i.e., the first on -study PE) is [ADDRESS_665205] of abbreviations, Synopsis,

to avoid confusion.  
Synopsis , Section 3.3.2.  The text on IMP strength has been updated to reflect that reconstitution of 
a vial containing 12.5 mg caplacizumab with the supplied kit components 
leads to a solution containing 11.1 mg/mL caplacizumab. 
Synopsis, Schedule of Assessments 
and Sections [IP_ADDRESS].  and 3.4.2.  Wording has been added to specify that the retrospective collection of data 
will include results of ADAMTS13 activity test performed per standard of 
care upon admission.  Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

can occur on Day 2 (due to allowed time windows).  
Synopsis, Section 3.6.4.  As no ECG assessment is planned on Day 5, evaluation of cardiac ischemia 
and/or  arrhythmia/conduction abnormalities on Day 5 has been removed 
from the concerned secondary endpoint. 
Schedule of Assessments  Wording  has been added to clarify what the bleeding assessment consists  
of, to emphasize that a blood sample needs to be taken in case of a severe 
and/or serious hypersensitivity reaction, and that no study drug is to be 
administered at Week 5 in case of no treatment extensions.   
Schedule of Assessments, 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].  A speci fication has been added to clarify that pregnancy testing , screening  
samples for creatinine assessment and samples for platelet count will be 
analyzed by a local lab . 
Schedule of Assessments, Sections [IP_ADDRESS]. and [IP_ADDRESS].  A separate row has been created  in the Schedule of Assessments  for 
assessment of height and weight, as these are not to be assessed after 
5 min in supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. It is also clarified that these are to be assessed on 
Day 1 of the initial double -blind daily PE period only ; this also applies for 
assessment of complement C5a and C5b -9.  
Sections 3.1.3., 3.2.3. 1. and 
[IP_ADDRESS].  To reduce the risk of unintentional unblinding, it has been clarified that 
analysis of RICO may only be  done at the central laboratory. In addition, it 
has been emphasized  that any event of unblinding should result in 
treatment discontinuation for the concerned subject.  
Section 3.2.2. Exclusion criterion 11 on concurrent participation in another clinical study 
has been reworded for clarification purposes.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS].  For clarity, a  criterion for temporary  discontinuation of study drug  stated in 
Section 3.3.5., is now also mentioned in the section on removal of subjects 
from therapy or assessments.  
Section 3.3.3. Wording has been added  to clarify that unused returned IMP should no 
longer be used.  
Sections 3.3.4. and 3.3.5.  A statement has been added to emphasiz e that subjects should not 
self-administer study drug prior to their visit to the study site on days a 
visit is planned. 
Sectio ns 3.3.4.  and [IP_ADDRESS].  Wording has been adapted to clarify that product quality complaints should 
be communicated by [CONTACT_513521]. In addition, 
wording with regard to human factor engineering is deleted as this will not 
be part o f this study.  
Section 3.3.8. A statement has been reworded to better reflect what is captured  in the 
eCRF in case of a missed dose.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Details on adjudication  of major thromboembolic events and TTP -related 
death have been added.  
Sections [IP_ADDRESS]., [IP_ADDRESS]., [IP_ADDRESS]., 
and [IP_ADDRESS].  and 3.4.10.  For clarity, text has been reworded to reflect total amount of blood to be 
taken by [CONTACT_513522]. In addition, a statement has been added to allow remaining  blood samples to be used for further exploratory work in the 
context of the development of caplacizumab . 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].  For clarity, the body systems to be examined  during physical examination  
have been  added.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS].  The word “(specify)” has been deleted  with regard to causal relationship of 
any AE to PE or use of corticosteroids to avoid confusion on what is to be specified (AE,  PE parameter or corticosteroid).  
Section [IP_ADDRESS].  More details concerning pregnancy reporting  have been added . 
Sections 3.6.5.  and 3.6.6.  Wording has been updated to better reflect the planned analysis approach.

Original section  Change/Rationale  
Synopsis, Sections 3.1.1. and 3.2.  The number of subjects planned to be included in the study 
has been increased from 92 to 132 to account for a change in 
the assumed treatment difference for the primary endpoint in 
the sample size calculation (to bring it in line with the results 
of the Phase II study), to account for drop -outs, and to 
increase the statistical power of the key secondary endpoint 
analys es.  
Synopsis  and Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Clarification to ensure consistency.  
Schedule of Assessments  and Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of usability of the IMP kit has been removed from

Standard of care treatment:  
• PE with plasma (e.g. , fresh frozen plasma, solvent detergent/viral -inactivated plasma, 
cryosupernatant) at 1 to 1.5 x estimated plasma volume daily as of randomization . The 
PE prior to randomization† should have been given with volume and  intensity  at the 
discretion of the Investigator .  
Once the platelet count is ≥ 150 x 109/L, daily PE should continue for at least 2 days. 
Tapering of PE after platelet count normalization , defined as reducing its frequency to 
less than once per day,  is strongly discouraged  and if considered , should be discussed 
with the Medical Monitor .  
 • Corticosteroid treatment should  be initiated/ continued with  (methyl)prednisolone or 
(methyl)prednisone regimen of at least 1 mg/kg/day  intravenous ( i.v.) or per orale (p.o.)  
during the daily PE period and continued for the [ADDRESS_665208]- daily PE period, corticosteroid tapering 
should be reassessed based  on ADAMTS13 activity data of the previous 2 visits and other 
clinical signs of underlying disease .  
 
• Other immunosuppressive treatment:  The use of other immunosuppressive treatment 
(e.g., rituximab) is allowed per standard site practice  but should be  considered in light of 
protocol required corticosteroid treatment . 
 Study drug treatment : 
Daily PE period
‡ 
• Loading i.v. dose: subjects will receive a single loading dose of [ADDRESS_665209] PE done after randomization ; 
an i.v. bolus of [ADDRESS_665210] 
exacerbation  or relapse .  
• Daily subcutaneous (s.c.)  dose: w ithin 2 hours of completing each daily PE, a s.c. 
injecti on of 10 mg study drug will be administered daily throughout the full duration of PE 
treatment.

from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], subjects are allowed to self -administe r (after learning how to prepare and s.c. 
inject the study drug).  
 
Treatment extension period   
Study drug treatment extension beyond these [ADDRESS_665213] be accompanied by [CONTACT_513525]. The risk factors will include the 
ADAMTS13 activity profile (measured weekly), as well as other signs and symptoms of continued underlying disease  activity, such as presence of inhibitors if measured as routine 
practice by [CONTACT_779] . Continued study drug treatment should be given for additional 7 -day 
periods with a maximum of 28 days for subjects whose ADAMTS13 activity profile remains 
below 10% base d on weekly measurement s and for subjects with other clinical signs of 
underlying disease . In parallel, optimi zation of the immunosuppressive treatment should be 
considered starting at the Week [ADDRESS_665214]- daily PE period and includes 
revers al of corticosteroid tapering through increase or re -initiation of corticosteroid 
treatment, or start/continuation of other immunosuppressive treatment such as rituximab  
(to be used as per standard site practice ). Study drug treatment extension should be 
stopped when ADAMTS13 activity shows a sustained upward trend of >10% and at the 
latest on Day 28 of the study drug treatment extension.  
 
Recurrence of TTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]  
• Exacerbation  is defined as recurrent thrombocytopenia  after initial recovery of platelet 
count (platelet count ≥ 150×109/L with subsequent stop of daily PE within 5 days ), 
requiring re -initiation of daily PE, o ccurring during  the first 30-days post-daily PE period.  
• Relapse  is defined as recurrent thrombocytopenia  after initial recovery of platelet count 
requiring re -initiation of daily PE, occurring after the [ADDRESS_665215]-daily PE period . 
 Based on the mechanism of action and the available efficacy and safety results from study 
ALX-0681- 2.1/10 (Phase II TITAN trial) it is considered desirable f rom both a treatment  and 
exposure perspective (to maximize the number of subjects exposed to caplacizumab), to 
allow for crossover to open-label caplacizumab for subjects who experience a recurrence  of 
the TTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] . 
 
Exacerbation   
In case of  a first  exacerbation  of the presenting TTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] , subjects will receive open label 
caplacizumab  together with daily PE  irrespective of what the initial treatment allocation was. Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

together with appropriate immunosuppressive treatment. Study drug treatment will 
crossover as open -label caplacizumab irrespective of what the initial treatment allocation 
was without breaking the blind of the initial treatment assignment.  Caplacizumab treatment

Study medication:  
 
The study medication is provided in a kit containing  the following components : 
• One glass vial containing l yophilized powder for reconstitution (containing either 
caplacizumab or placebo  – see details below) . 
• One prefilled glass syringe containing solvent for reconstitution  (containing water for 
injection  [WFI]). 
• One “vial adapter ” device to facilitate transfer of the solvent for reconstitution and

containing 12.5 mg caplacizumab  and excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (see below) . 
- Active substance: caplacizuma b (anti-vWF Nanobody) . 
- Activity: caplacizumab  is directed towards the A1 domain of vWF and specifically 
inhibits the interaction of (ultra-large)vWF  ([UL]vWF) with the platelet Glycoprotein 
Ib (GPIb) receptor glycoprotein, thereby [CONTACT_166187] (UL)vWF-mediated platelet 
aggregation . 
- Strength: One vial contains 12.5 mg of caplacizumab and comprises an overfill to 
compensate for losses during reconstitution and liquid transfer. After reconstitution 
using the supplied kit components, the resulting solution contains 11.1 mg/mL of 
caplacizumab (the total volume of the reconstituted solution is slightly more than  
1 mL because the lyophilisate also takes up a certain volume ). Taking into account 
losses during transfer from vial to syringe, the nominal administered dose is 10 mg when injecting the entir e content s (nominally 0.9 mL) of the syringe.

 Statistical Methods  
 Sample size :  
The hypothesis of interest in this study is to test the superiority of caplacizumab compared 
to placebo with respect to the time to  platelet count response (initial platelet  count 
≥ 150×10
9/L with subsequent stop of daily PE within 5 days ). The required sample size is 
calculated to obtain a power of  at least 80% to detect a significant reduction in time to 
platelet count response using a two -sided Log-rank test, at a significance level of 5%. The 
accrual period is taken to be 2.5 years and the time -to-event period is set at 45 days. An 
estimated reduction of time to platelet count response for subjects in the caplacizumab arm 
of 40% is assumed. Wi th a median time to response in the placebo arm assumed to be 
7 days, this would correspond with a median time to response in the caplacizumab arm of 
4.2 days. In addition, an expected drop -out rate of 10% in the  first [ADDRESS_665233] 
administratio n of study drug  is taken into account in the calculations. Based on these 
assumptions a total sample size of 132 subjects (121 events) will provide a power of 80%. 
A total sample size of 132 subjects will also provide approximately 83% power to detect a 
20% reduction in the first key secondary endpoint, using a two -sided chi -squared test with 
a large sample approximation and a 5% significance level. This assumes an incidence of 30% and 10% in the placebo and caplacizumab arms, respectively.  
 Randomization : 
Subjects will be randomized to one of the 2 arms in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_513527] ( GCS ≤ 12 vs. GCS=13 -15). Stratification 
is foreseen to ensure balanced treatment arms for the key secondary endpoints related to Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

July 20, 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26/112 neurological involvement and not for the primary endpoint for which the stratification 
parameter is not known to be relevant.  
 Analysis of primary endpoint:  
Time to platelet count response  in the caplacizumab arm and placebo arm will be com pared  
by [CONTACT_14664] a  two-sided stratified Log-rank test (significance level of 5%) based on a 
Kaplan -Meier (KM) analysis, with severity of neurological involvement as stratification 
factor.  Time to platelet count response  will be measured from  the time of the first i.v. 
loading dose of study drug  after randomization . In the KM analysis an observation will be 
censored if the defined time interval of [ADDRESS_665234] administration of study drug is not met, due to any cause (e.g., endpoint not being reached within this time interval  or subject 
lost to follow -up). The censoring plan will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP). 
The analysis will be performed on the modified intent -to-treat ( mITT) population (ICH E9 
guidance), which co mprises all randomized subjects who have received at least one study 
drug dose. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were assigned. Crossover of subjects who experience a recurrence of TTP during the study to 
open-label caplac izumab will not affect the primary efficacy endpoint analysis as an 
exacerbation can only occur after the primary endpoint has been reached.  
 
Analysis of secondary endpoints: 
 Key secondary endpoints  
Confirmatory hypothesis testing will be conducted for th e key secondary endpoints. In order 
to control the rate of false positive conclusions with a family -wise error rate of 5%, a fixed 
sequence approach will be applied. The key secondary endpoints are hierarchically ordered. This allows statistical testing fo r these endpoints at the same nominal significance level of 
5% without adjustment, as long as the tests occur in the pre -defined sequential order, and 
given that all null hypotheses to be tested for endpoints with a higher rank (including the primary endpoint) are rejected. As soon as a test is not statistically significant for a certain 
endpoint, i.e. as soon as the sequence breaks, no confirmatory testing will be done for 
remaining endpoints lower in the ranking. Statistical comparison between the two tre atment 
arms for the key secondary endpoints will be done by [CONTACT_513528] (in hierarchical order):  
1. Proportion of subjects with TTP-related death, a recurrence of TTP, or at least one 
treatmen t-emergent major thromboembolic event (e.g., myocardial infarction, 
cerebrovascular accident, pulmonary embolism or DVT)  during the study drug 
treatment period (incl uding  extensions): Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test with 
adjustment for severity of neurological involvement (stratification factor u sed in

baseline for LDH only (not for cTnI or for serum creatinine) or not. Subjects who 
have crossed over from placebo to caplacizuma b before having reached the endpoint 
will be censored at time of crossover.

July 20, 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34/112 1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Caplacizumab  (Sponsor code: ALX -0081) is intended to inhibit the interaction between von 
Willebrand factor (vWF) and platelets, by [CONTACT_4122] A1 domain of vWF. C aplacizumab  
selectively prevents thrombus formation in high -shear blood vessels , blocks  ultra-large (UL) 
vWF mediated platelet interactions, and is expected not to interact with hemostasis in normal, healthy blood vessels.  
 Currently, caplacizumab  is being developed for treatment of acquired thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) [1]. TTP is a rare and  potentially  life-threatening 
thrombotic microangiopathy, in which accum ulation of ULvWF multimers lead s to an 
increased risk of thrombus formation in small blood vessels due to excessive platelet 
aggregation.  
 
1.1.  THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC 
PURPURA  
 
Acquired TTP is a rare, potentially life -threatening , (sub)acute onset  thrombotic 
microangiopathy that lead s to microvascular occlusions and variable organ ischemia 
throughout the body including brain, heart and to lesser extent kidneys. It is characterized by [CONTACT_12703], hemolytic anemia and signs and symptoms of tiss ue ischemia, 
result ing from ULvWF forming platelet aggregates in the microvasculature. Th e ischemic 
damage may result in both acute complications as well as in poorer longer term outcomes [2, 3]. Next to this acute phase, exacerbations  of the presenting TTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_513486] 30% of subjects.  
 
In TTP patients, the processing of ULvWF multimers by a disintegrin -like and 
metalloprotease with thrombospondin repeats 13 (ADAMTS13)  is impaired, resulting in the 
persistence of ULvWF with constitutively active A1 domain. This A1 domain readily interacts 
with the Glycoprotei n Ib ( GPIb)-IX-V receptor on platelets, resulting  in ULvWF mediated 
platelet string formation and subsequent thrombocytopenia, microvascular 
thromboembolism and erythrocyte fragmentation (schistocytes) (also see section 1.2.1). 
Impaired processing of ULvWF in TTP is often caused by [CONTACT_513529] -antibodies to 
ADAMTS13 (idiopathic acquired TTP), or due to mutation(s) in the ADAMTS13 gene (congenital form of TTP). Although ADAMTS13 deficiency is the primary molecular 
mechanism for TTP, it is not mandatory for the clinical diagnosis of acquired TTP , but may 
help to confirm it.

July 20, 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35/112 Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been reported as an early complication of TTP based 
both on clinical diagnosis of AMI [4] and autopsy findings  [5]. Post -mortem evaluation of 
25 patients with TTP who died within 5 – 126 days of the TTP diagnosis (23 of whom died in 
1995 or before, when plasma exchan ge (PE) was not the standard of care treatment [for 
treatment of TTP, also see section 1.1.1]), revealed clear involvement of myocardial arteries 
and more variable vascular involvement in the brain, kidney, pancreas and adrenal glands [5].  
 The use of PE treatment has greatly impr oved survival, however the isch emic damage 
remains a cause of concern: in a retrospective review of 74 patients with thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) it was demonstrated that patients with clinically suspected TTP are at high risk to deve lop AMI, based on high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH ) and troponin 
I (TnI) elevations. At presentation there were 14 subjects in whom a diagnosis of AMI was 
made (TnI > 1 ng/mL with at least one further criterion for AMI). Thirty- two patients of the 
74 TMA patients were assessed as having TTP. Thirteen  of these TTP patients (41%) had an 
AMI indicating that among TMA patients, those with TTP are more susceptible [4]. In 
another retrospective study in 41 TTP patients, raised troponin T levels >0. 01 µg/L were 
linked with mortality and acute morbidity. 27/41 subjects had troponin T levels above normal range (>0. 01 µg/L) and 22/41 had levels ≥0. 05 µg/L. Half of the subjects with 
troponin T ≥0. 05 µg/L (12/22) had clinical cardiac symptoms (including chest pain, 
syncope, dyspnea and palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]). Moreover, subjects that died (5/41) had higher 
troponin T levels (median: 0.305 µg/L), while there were no deaths in the group of normal 
troponin T leve ls (<0.1 µg/L). Histology confirmed widespread myocardial microvascular 
thrombo sis in the 5 subjects that died  [6]. 
 In an other, prospective cohort study of 133 TTP patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency 
(ADAMTS13 activity < 10%) for whom frozen samples on diagnosis were available for 
cardiac TnI ( cTnI) measurement, 78  patients (59%) had cTnI > 0.1 µg/m L. Thirty- three 
patients (25%) in this cohort died and 19 patients (17%) were assessed with refractory 
disease (absence of platelet count doubling after [ADDRESS_665248] of care treatment with persistently high LDH levels). A cut off value for cTnI predicting de ath was deter mined as 
0.25 µg/mL . Patients with cTnI at baseline > 0.25 µg/m L showed more cerebral and cardiac 
involvement and experienced a more severe outcome with a higher death  rate: 3 -fold 
increase in risk of death or refractory disease [7]. These results suggest that more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_513487] , e.g.  measured by [CONTACT_513530] , of the 
presenting TTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_513488] a clinical benefit. Other retrospective reports found similar results on acute and long -term cardiac involvement in TTP patients 
including myocardial infarctions [8] and other cardiac events like infarctions, arrhythmias, 
cardiogenic shock and sudden cardiac death [9].  
 In addition to the cardiac manifestations, neurological involvement is considered to be one of the differentiating factors for TTP. It is observed in more than half of patients presenting Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

July 20, 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36/112 with TTP: reported proportions vary from 50% in the Oklahoma TTP registry (patients with 
ADAMTS13 <10%) [10] to 68% in the French cohort study  [7]. Longer term consequences 
of the acute ischemia and/or recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_513489] a selection of 24 patients from the Oklahoma Registry with documented 
ADAMTS13 deficiency at the time of initial TTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_513490]. Twenty -four 
patients were included and underwent a variety of  tests assessing 11 domains of cognitive 
function. Results of these tests were compared to the [LOCATION_002] (US) normative 
population (16
th percentile) and the group performance for these 24 subjects was worse 
than the US population norms for neurological ly normal subjects. Eighteen (75%) of the TTP 
patients performed below expectations in one or more of the following domains: complex attention and sequencing, manual dexterity, rapid language generation and list learning 
[11]. In addition, a health -related quality of life survey in patients from the Oklahoma TTP 
Registry (using a standardized questionnaire, the Short Form -36, covering eight different 
domains of physical/mental health and general health) also revealed that patients with TTP 
have worse daily functioning and well -being compared to the US normative population [12]. 
 
Another report from the Oklahoma Registry based on the annual follow -up through [ADDRESS_665249] a greater risk for poor health and 
premature death. Hypertension and diabetes were not significantly different in prevalence at 
the time of TTP diagnosis. However, at the time of the report the prevalence of hypertension 
was greater than expected (40% vs. expected value of 23%, p = 0.011) but not tha t of 
diabetes (14% vs. expected 10%, p = 0.439). Depression was more prevalent in 2012 for these patients than expected (prevalence of 19% vs. expected 6%, p = 0.005 for major 
depression) – none of the patients with major depression had a relapse TTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. For the 
57 patients evaluated over a median of 7.8 years, there was a higher than expected 
mortality rate of 19% and the 11 patients who died all did before their expected age of 
death [2]. Contributory factors to the poorer outcomes noted by [CONTACT_513531]: age, 
race, gender and body mass index (BMI ), and the small number of patients with TTP 
precluded determination of TTP as an independent factor.  
 More recently, longer term outcomes were  reported from a single cent er retrospective 
analysis of 100 patients diagnosed with TTP and followed for a media n of 59 months (range 
1 – 117 months). In the 91 patients who survived there was a higher prevalence of 
hypertension (61.5 % vs. 24%), depression (26% vs. 12%), chronic kidney disease (26% 
vs. 15%), stroke (12% vs. 6%) and diabetes (7% vs . 4%) when compari ng the follow -up 
(FU) period to the prevalence at diagnosis [ 13]. 
 
A fast normali zation of LDH as marker for hemolysis and ischemic organ damage may 
potentially also be  beneficial for long term clinical outcome. In a retrospective study of 
282 subjects, high levels of LDH at presentation were linked with a worse long term Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

July 20, 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37/112 outcome (mortality), reflective of a severe multiple organ involvement [14]. Moreover, a 
persistent elevation of LDH after the initiation of PE (2 or more  sessions  of PE) predicts 
mortality in acquired TTP subjects [15]. Similarly, a ret rospective analysis of 30  patients 
with TMA/TTP showed that a more pronounced decline of LDH (i.e. , LDH ratio of < 0.6; 
calculated as the LDH levels before the third PE session / LDH level at baseline) was linked 
with a more favorable outcome [16]. In addition, TMA patients with an LDH ratio >  0.[ADDRESS_665250] a significantly higher risk for AMI [4]. These results 
suggest that a faster normalization of LDH levels would be linked to a better clinical outcome.  
 
1.1.1.  TREATMENT OF TTP  
 Plasma exchange therapy is the standard of care treatment for acquired TTP. It replenishes 
ADAMTS13, partially  normal izing vWF processing, and removes pathogenic auto antibodies 
when present. Immunosuppressive treatment, most commonly cortico steroids , is started 
together with the PE therapy. Daily PE therapy is stopped (or tapered) when the platelet 
count has normali zed for at least 48 hours. An “exacerbation” occurs in approximately 30% 
of patients [17]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_513491], 
acquired TTP still has an associated mortality of 10 to 20%. Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency 
(<10% ) has be en recognized as a potential biomarker for the management and follow -up 
relating to risk of relapse of acquired TTP patients  [18, 19 ]. Although different thresholds for 
defining a severe deficiency in ADAMTS13 activity have been described, recent guidance  
papers  have proposed a cut -off level of <10% to define a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency . 
ADAMTS13 levels below 10% during remission may predict an increased risk for relapse  
[20-22] and may be used as marker for active underlying disease [23]. 
 In spi[INVESTIGATOR_513492], there are no approved 
pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_513493]. Caplacizumab represents a novel approach to 
the treatment microvascular thrombosis inherent in  TTP and may provide significant benefit 
in terms of efficacy, safety and quality of life for subjects with TTP. Caplacizumab is being 
developed with the aim of preventing platelet consumption and formation of further microthrombi thereby [CONTACT_513532].

The following paragraphs provide summary information on caplacizumab ; for more detailed 
background information, please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure . 
 
1.2.1.  GENERAL PROPERTIES  
 Caplacizumab  is a Nanobody developed by [CONTACT_439943]. Nanobodies are therapeutic proteins 
that are derived from the smallest functional fragments of heavy chain only antibodies, which occur naturally in the Camelidae family. They have a high degree of homology (in terms of sequ ence and structure) to human immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region 
domains, and can be further engineered and expressed by a variety of expression systems.  
 
Caplacizumab  is a humanized bivalent Nanobody which is produced in E. coli  and consists of 
two identical humanized anti -vWF building blocks, genetically linked by a 3 -alanine linker 
(Figure 1). 
 
 
(aa: amino acid; MW: molecular weight; Da: Dalton)  
Figure 1: Schematic structure of caplacizumab   
 The target of caplacizumab , vWF, is a key protein in hemostasis. vWF is expressed by 
[CONTACT_513533]. The A1 domain in ULvWF is activated and is able to interact spontaneously, in circulation, with the platelet 
receptor GPIb -IX-V.  
 In healthy subjects, ULvWF multimers are immediately cleaved into smaller, regular- sized 
multimers by [CONTACT_513534] -cleaving protease ADAMTS13.  In TTP  patients, processing of ULvWF

GPIb-IX-V as ULvWF multimers) and its inactive form (i.e., multimers prior to 
conformational change of A1 domain), thereby [CONTACT_513535] -IX-V platelet receptor. As such, this Nanobody prevents the 
characteristic platelet string formation that would otherwise lead to platelet agglutination in the microvasculature, lo cal ischemia and platelet consumption ( see Figure 2). 
 
 
Figure 2: Mechanism of action of caplacizumab in TTP.  
 The interaction of caplacizumab with vWF is highly specific, and binding of the Nanobody to 
the vWF A1 domain does not affect the capacity of vWF to interact with coagulation factor 
VIII ( FVIII), for which vWF has a carrier function (preventing the degradation of FVIII while 
in its inactive state in circulation). Similarly, the selective binding of caplacizumab does not 
affect the capacity of vWF to interact with fibrillar collagens or collagen type VI. The Nanobody also does not cross react with hum an blood cells or platelets, and does not affect 
the activity of the vWF cleaving protease ADAMTS13. Due to this high specificity, off -target 
effects are not expected  and have not been observed in the clinical trials to date .

1.2.3.  NONCLINICAL STUDIES  
 
All relevant nonclinical studies conducted with caplacizumab  are described in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
• Pharmacology: The pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of caplacizumab  were studied in in 
vitro and in vivo studies .  
Caplacizumab  was shown to:  
- Bind to the A1 domain of vWF in normal and ultra large multimers.  
- Inhibit concentration- dependently and completely the interaction of (UL)vWF with 
platelets . 
- Inhibit in vitro  and in vivo  arterial thrombus formation.  
- Prevent in vitro platelet string formation with ULvWF.  
- Inhibit completely ristocetin -induced platelet aggregation (RIPA ) and ristocetin 
cofactor activity (RICO)  in vitro  and in vivo . 
- Decrease dose -dependently and saturably FVIII activity and von Willebrand factor 
antigen (vWF:Ag) levels with recovery after treatment stop.  
- Not increase surgical bleeding in vivo.  
- Prevent and treat thrombocytopenia and schistocytic hemolytic anemia in a baboon 
model of acquired TTP.  
 
• Pharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of caplacizumab  were analyzed in 
4 cross-reactive species (baboon, farm pig, cynomolgus monkey and guinea pig). 
Different routes of administration were assessed, namely intravenously (i.v.), subcutaneously (s.c.) and intramuscularly (i.m.). The terminal half -life (t
1/2) of 
caplacizumab  - more precisely caplacizumab  bound to vWF - ranges between [ADDRESS_665252] and the excess of unbound drug is 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_513494] [24]. Consequent ly, after i.v., s.c. or i.m. 
administration, non -linear kinetics were observed: exposure does not increase 
proportionally to the dose. This PK behavior limits the potential for overdosing. The absolute bioavailability of caplacizumab  after s.c. administrat ion, in cynomolgus monkey, 
ranged from 82% to 97% [25]. 
 • Toxicology: Toxicity studies include:  
- Single dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkey and guinea pig after i.v. and s.c. administration,  
- 2-week repeated dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkey after i.v. and s.c. 
administration,  Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

s.c. administration and  
- A 26-week chronic dose toxicity study in  cynomolgus monkey  after s.c. administration .  
 
The toxicology data revealed:  
- Neutralization of vWF activity throughout dosing period (as measured through RICO ). 
- Mild bleeding events such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_513495].  
- One case of marked and persistent ane mia, signs of inflammation, an increased 
bleeding tendency and low FVIII clotting activity (FVIII:C), concurrent with the presence of inhibitory anti -FVIII antibodies (AFA) in one cynomolgus monkey, with 
unclear assignment to study drug (high dose group, 2 6-week toxicity study in 
cynomolgus monkey).  
- One case of profound but reversible decrease of platelet counts in cynomolgus monkey 
(high dose group, 26 -week toxicity study).  
- No immune response -induced adverse events (AEs) were reported in any of the 
toxici ty studies.  
- Development of AFA without clinical correlates in 4 animals (2 out of 32 verum -treated 
animals from 13- week toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey and 2 out of 40 verum -
treated animals from 26 -week toxicity study).  
- In the [ADDRESS_665253] level 
(NOAEL) was established at 4 mg/kg/day based on morbidity of one high -dose animal 
and the absence of findings in the 4 mg/kg/day group. The observation of AFA 
positivity across dose groups, was not used to determine the NOAEL as immune -
mediated processes are known not to be dose -related.  
 
1.2.4.  EFFECTS IN HUMANS  
 Phase I studies  
Up to now, the following Phase I studies have been completed in healthy volunteers and in 
patients:  
• Study ALX -0081- 01/06 was a Phase Ia double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized 
parallel group, single ascending i.v. dose study conducted in healthy male subjects to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of caplacizumab administered 
i.v. as sin gle ascending doses.  
• Study ALX -0681- 1.1/08 (Phase I) examined the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of caplacizumab (ALX- 0081) in healthy volunteers after single or 
multiple s.c. administrations.  
• Study ALX -0081- 1.2/08 was perfor med mono- centric with stages A and B as a double -
blind, placebo -controlled, randomized, dose -escalation Phase Ib study to evaluate the 
safety of ascending doses of caplacizumab  in stable angina patients undergoing 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). An open label extension (OLE) stage (Stage C) Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

July 20, 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42/[ADDRESS_665254] and 
the overall biological and clinical re sponse.  
• Study ALX0681 -C102 was a Phase I , single center, open -label, randomized, single dose, 
2-way 2 -period cross -over study in healthy male subjects to evaluate the PK 
characteristics and demonstrate bioequivalence of a reconstituted new lyophilized 
formulation of caplacizumab for s.c. injection as compared to an equal nominal s.c. dose 
of the reference liquid formulation.  In addition, the safety and tolerability, and the PD 
parameters of the new formulation were compared with those of the reference 
formulation.  
 
Based on the clinical data, single administrations of caplacizumab  (up to 12 mg for i.v. 
administrations and up to 10 mg for s.c. administrations) and multiple administrations of caplacizumab  (6+4+4+4 mg q6h i.v.)
 were well tolerated in healthy volunteers and PCI 
patients. In general, incidence of treatment -related AEs was low  after single dose 
administration and  administration did not result in clinically significant signs of bleeding. 
After multiple dose treatment (7 a nd 14 days), more treatment- related AEs were observed 
including an increase in the number of bruises and bleeding, all being of mild intensity.  
 
In the Phase I studies, n o treatment -emergent (TE) anti-drug antibodies (ADA) have been 
observed after single or multiple administrations of caplacizumab .  
 The PK profile is determined by [CONTACT_232798]- mediated drug disposition since only drug bound to 
the target vWF is retained in circulation with a half -life (90% confidence interval [ CI]) of 
10-30 hours, and excess drug is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_513496] ( 28 kDa). 
Consequently, after i.v. and s.c. administration, non -linear kinetics were observed: 
exposure does not increase proportionally to the dose and an increase in clearance can be noted. This PK behavior is expected to translate into a low overdosing potentia l for 
caplacizumab . 
 
In the study evaluat ing bioequivalence  of s.c. administration of the reconstituted new 
lyophilized formulation and the reference liquid formulation  of caplacizumab (study 
ALX0681- C102) , the geometric mean for C
max_D, AUC 0-last_D and AU C0-∞_D were similar 
following of 10 mg reconstituted lyophilized solution and 10 mg of the reference liquid 
formulation. The formal statistical analysis confirmed that the se PK parameters were 
bioequivalent at the 10% significance leve l. Also t he median t max and t1/2 was similar for 
both formulations.  
 
The PD properties of caplacizumab  are: 
• Inhibition of vWF mediated platelet activation assessed via complete inhibition of ristocetin induced platelet aggregation (RIPA and RICO).  Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

Phase II studies  
One Phase II study has been completed  in the development of caplacizumab for the 
treatment of acq uired TTP. An additional Phase II study was completed in an additional 
development path for acute coronary syndrome (which is no longer being pursued for 
strategic reasons) : 
• Study ALX -0681- 2.1/10 was a Phase II, single -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled  
multicenter trial to study the efficacy and safety of anti -von Willebrand factor Nanobody 
caplacizumab (ALX- 0081) administered as adjunctive treatment to plasma exchange to 
patients with acquired TTP.  
• ALX-0081- 2.1/09 , a Phase II trial was conducted to com pare caplacizumab and 
abciximab (ReoPro®) in high risk PCI patients.   
 
Study ALX -0681- 2.1/10 (TITAN trial) in acquired TTP  
 
The efficacy and safety of caplacizumab in the treatment of acquired TTP have been 
evaluated in trial ALX -0681- 2.1/[ADDRESS_665255]- daily PE period. The trial was terminated early due to recruitment 
challenges, with a total of 75  subjects enrolled and included in the intent -to-treat ( ITT) 
analysis, but nonetheless demonstrated a statistically significant treatment effect as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_53229] “time to confirmed platelet count normali zation”, with a 
hazard rate ratio (95% CI) for the caplacizumab versus placebo groups of 2. 2 (1.3, 3.8), 
p-value for the stratified log -rank test of p=0.0048. This corresponded to a reduction in 
median time to confirmed platelet count normali zation from 4.8 (3.6, 5.9) days in the 
placebo treatment group to 3.0 (2.8, 3. 9) days in the caplacizumab treatment group.  
 The secondary endpoints illustrate the potential protective effect of caplacizumab treatment 
in the acute phase of TTP.  
• Complete remission following initial daily PE was observed in a much higher number and proportion of subjects who received caplacizumab compared with the placeb o group  
(29 [80.6%] subjects versus 18  [46.2%]  subjects, respectively) . 
• A lower proportion of subjects with an exacerbation during treatment of 8% (n = 3) for 
caplacizumab compared to 28% (n = 11) for placebo.  
• When the 1 -month FU is also considered, a simi lar number and proportion of subjects 
had an exacerbation of TTP and/or a relapse of TTP (10 [27.8%] subjects in the 
caplacizumab  treatment group and 11 [28.2%] subjects in the placebo treatment group).  
This suggests that in a number of subjects, the underlying auto -immune activity had not 
sufficiently resolved. Immunosuppressive treatment was not standardized and the 
shorter duration of PE in the caplacizumab arm may also have impacted the timing of the resolution of the underlying auto -immune disorder.  Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

caplacizumab group compared with the placebo group  (5.9 versus 7.9, respectively ), as 
was the mean total volume of PE administered  ([ZIP_CODE] mL versus  [ZIP_CODE] mL, 
respectively ). 
 
Results from the caplacizumab arm suggest that ADAMTS13 activity data could identify subjects who were at risk for early relapse. In [ADDRESS_665256] 
month, it occurred within 4 -10 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_513497]. All 7 subjects had 
ADAMTS13 activity values <10% at baseline, during and near the end of the treatment period, indicating unresolved underlying disease activity. In the [ADDRESS_665257], the relapse 
event occurred at 30 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_513498]. This subjec t had 
normalization of ADAMTS13 activity during and near the end of the treatment period. However at the time of the relapse, ADAMTS13 activity was again suppressed <10%, which 
suggests a de novo TTP event. Conversely, [ADDRESS_665258] 
an exacerbation or relapse, with ADAMTS13 activity data available near the end of the treatment period for 16/22 patients. In 13 of 16 subjects without exacerbation or relapse, ADAMTS13 activity had returned to values ≥10% near the end of the trea tment. ADAMTS13 
activity results from the placebo treated subjects supported the potential predictive value of the marker: for 14 of  16 placebo subjects without exacerbation or relapse (ADAMTS13 data 
available for 16/23 placebo subjects), ADAMTS13 activity  values were ≥10% near the end 
of the placebo treatment period. A total of 11 placebo subjects had an exacerbation during the treatment period, and ADAMTS13 activity data were available for 8 of them. Seven of 
8 placebo subjects with an exacerbation had AD AMTS13 activity <10% around the time of 
the exacerbation, while the [ADDRESS_665259] had a borderline ADAMTS13 activity value of 11%.  In 
summary, the data support  ADAMTS13 activity as a potential  marker to identify patients at 
risk for exacerbation or relapse, specifically patients with signs of ongoing active disease 
during the treatment period who are at risk of relapse early after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_513499].  
 
No significant unanticipated safety concerns were raised for treatment with caplacizumab in 
this study. The results were as expected for the population of patients with acquired TTP. The overall duration of exposure to study drug was similar in the two treatment arms.  
No subjects in the caplacizumab treatment group died during the study.  Two subj ects in the 
placebo treatment group died between the end of study treatment up to and including 
1 month FU: one subject had a  treatment emergent adverse event ( TEAE) of cerebral 
hemorrhage which  was assessed as related to TTP ; the other placebo subject died from the 
serious TEAE of refractory TTP.  
 
A total of 574  TEAEs were reported in 34  (97.1%)  subjects in the caplacizumab treatment 
group compared with 545 TEAEs in 37  (100%)  subjects in the placebo treatment group.  A 
comparable number of subjects was also observed between the two treatment arms with

any TEAE leading to discontinuat ion of study drug was low in both treatment groups  (4 and 
2 in the caplacizumab and placebo groups , respectively ). 
 
The proportion of subjects with any bleeding -related TEAE was higher in the caplacizumab 
treatment group (54.3 % of  subjects) than in the placebo treatment group (37.8%  of 
subjects); most bleeding -related TEAEs were mild ( 83% of  events) or moderate (14 % of 
events ) in severity. Amongst the bleeding -related TEAE , epi[INVESTIGATOR_513500] ( 31% of  subje cts for ALX -0081 and 11% of  subjects for placebo (all mild or 
moderate). Two subjects in each treatment arm experienced serious bleeding related 
TEAEs. The TE bleeding AEs did not lead to emergency measures. Furthermore, no vWF or 
Factor VIII supplementati on was administered during the trial.  
 Treatment -emergent  ADA were detected in 9% of the subjects in the ALX -0081 treated 
group and in no placebo  treated subjects. These had no apparent influence on PK and PD 
parameters. There was also n o association foun d between the ADAs and safety findings .  
 Study ALX -0081- 2.1/09   
This study evaluated caplacizumab in patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention. Caplacizumab was given as a 6 mg i.v. injection prior to the intervention and with 4 mg i.v. injections every 6 hours afterwards for 3 doses. The primary endpoin t of the 
study was a composite of all bleeding events according to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial 
Infarction (TIMI) classification and was designed to detect a relative risk reduction of 0.4 
(caplacizumab  versus abciximab [ ReoPro® ]). Both caplacizumab and abciximab  showed 
comparable bleeding profiles: 36 (19.9%) patients in the caplacizumab  treatment group and 
28 (15.3%) patients in the abciximab  treatment group reported bleeding events. Only 3 
(1.7%) caplacizumab  treated patients and 2 (1.1%) abciximab  treated patients showed a 
major bleeding event during the 30 day period following the PCI procedure. The safety 
profile of caplacizumab and abciximab was similar in this study. There were no notable 
differences in the AE profile between the treatment groups. The proportion of SAEs was low 
in both treatment groups and the number of deaths was low at Day 30 with only 1 patient in the abciximab group. At 1 year FU, the number of deaths was even at 5 in each treatment 
arm. All but one of the deaths were considered  to be unlikely/not related to the study drug. 
This other death in the caplacizumab treatment group was considered as possibly related.  
 
In this Phase II study, t reatment -emergent antibodies were detected in 10.9% of the 
caplacizumab -treated subjects. No neutralizing antibodies were detected.  
 
The PD assessments showed an immediate drop in RICO activity 5 to 10 minutes after the 
caplacizumab  bolus injection. Clinically relevant RICO inhibition (< 20%) was maintained for 
[ADDRESS_665260]- bolus in the caplacizu mab group which was accompanied by [CONTACT_513536].  Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

The benefit and risk assessment for administration of caplacizumab , as detailed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, supports  initiation of the proposed clinical trial.  
 
Overall, the TITAN trial  provide d evidence for the clinical efficacy of caplacizumab  as 
potential  treatment for patients with acquired TTP who were receivin g standard of care 
therapy , with respect to reducing the time -to-response (based on confirmed recovery in 
platelet counts) and reducin g the incidence of exacerbation  during treatment . These findings 
are expected to be predictive of tangible clinical benefits in terms of reduced 
mortality/morbidity. The higher incidence of r elapse soon after discontinuation of 
caplacizumab  appeared to be associated with persistent  low ADAMTS13 activity (<10%), 
suggesting unresolved underlying auto -immune activity. The curren t study will evaluate  
whether such patients would benefit from continuing treatment with caplacizumab  for a 
longer period after discontinuation of PE.  
 
The safety results in study ALX -0681- 2.1/10 revealed no unexpected findings in relation to 
adverse events. The main safety finding associated with caplacizumab  treatment was an 
increase in bleeding -related adverse events, which was consistent with findings in previous 
studies and is an e xpected consequence of the pharmacological activity of the drug.  
Notwithstanding this, the majority of bleeding events in the study were mild to moderate in severity, and an equal number of subjects in each treatment arm ([ADDRESS_665261] s per arm) had 
a serious  bleeding related TEAE. Hence, bleeding risk appears to be acceptable in the 
context of the anticipated clinical benefits of caplacizumab  in the TTP indication. 
Nonetheless,  vWF can be used as antidote for caplacizumab  if needed . vWF and FVIII 
preparations as combination products are commercially available.  
 
With regard to immunogenicity, taking into account patient, product and disease related 
factors, caplacizuma b was assigned a low risk class designation. In the TITAN trial, drug 
induced TE antibodies were detected in 9% of caplacizumab treated subjects. No 
immunogenicity related safety findings were reported.  
 Regarding the Reference Safety Information to be considered for ICH E2A, E2B, E2F 
reporting obligations relative to Pharmacovigilance guidelines, the AEs that would be 
considered as “Expected” include mild bleeding (very common), as well as decreases of Factor VIII and/or vWF not requiring supplementation with exogenous factor VIII and/or vWF (very common). As such, all  other AEs fulfilling the conditions for Serious Adverse 
Reactions (SAR) are to be considered as unexpected, and therefore reported as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) according to the guidelines stated above.  
 Subjects with acquired T TP may have a treatment benefit with caplacizumab in the form of 
a faster normalization of platelet count, potentially leading to shorter duration of tissue Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

Estimated Study Duration  
The anticipated study duration  per subject  is approximately [ADDRESS_665270] to the time to  platelet co unt response (initial platelet  count 
≥ 150×10
9/L with subsequent stop of daily PE within 5 days ). The required sample size is 
calculated to obtain a power of at least 80% to detect a significant reduction in time to 
platelet count response using a two -sided Log-rank test, at a significance level of 5%. The 
accrual period is taken to be 2.5 years and the time -to-event period is set at 45 days. An 
estimated reduction of time to platelet count response for subjects in the caplacizumab arm 
of 40% is assumed. With a median time to response in the placebo arm assumed to be

4.2 days. In addition, an expected drop -out rate of 10% in the  first [ADDRESS_665271] 
administration of study drug is taken into account in the calculations. Based on these 
assumptions a total sample size of 132 subjects (121 events) will provide a power of 80%. 
A total sample size of 132 subjects will also provide approximately 83% power to detect a 
20% reduction in the first key secondary endpoint, using a two -sided chi -squared test with 
a large sample approximation and a 5% significance level. This assumes an incidence of 
30% and 10% in the placebo and caplacizumab arms, respective ly. 
 Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
 
The sponsor will appoint a DSMB consisting of an independent group of clinical experts, who 
are not participating in the study. They will be supplemented by [CONTACT_55467]. The objective of the DSMB will be to review unblinded safety data on SAEs with a focus on 
mortality rate. Acquired TTP is still associated with a mortality rate of 10 – 20% and an 
efficacious treatment may reduce this.  The first DSMB meeting will be convened a s of 
[ADDRESS_665272] completed the study drug treatment period, whichever 
occurs earlier. This is to review the SAE and mortality information (including the overall number of subjects  treated up to that point, rates, and subject -level details) and determine 
if there is an imbalance in the treatment arms with respect to these events, based on clinical judgment of the DSMB. Subsequent meetings will be determined by [CONTACT_513539], and incidence of SAE s, particularly death. The DSMB 
will advise the sponsor concerning continuation, modification or termination of the study after every meeting.  
 The composition, objectives, and role and responsibilities of the independent DSMB will be described in a DSMB charter, agreed with the DSMB members and Sponsor. The DSMB 
charter will also define and document the content of the safety summaries, and general 
procedures (including communications).  
 
3.1.2.  STUDY RATIONALE  
 
Preclinical studies demonstrate tha t (i) caplacizumab is able to immediately halt ULvWF 
platelet string formation in in vitro flow chamber experiments and (ii) caplacizumab 
prevents the progressing formation of platelet aggregates as demonstrated through 
histological measurement of vessel occlusion in a bab oon model of acquired TTP [26]. These 
results provide evidence for the prevention of further microthrombi formation upon administration of caplacizumab. Given the pathophysiology of acquired TTP whereby [CONTACT_513540], it is reasonable to infer that the 
recovery of platelet counts is an indirect measure of prevention of further microthrombi 
formation. The morbidity and the acute mortality associated with acquired TTP is a result of Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

July 20, 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 54/[ADDRESS_665273] to both the organ systems involved and the extent of involvement.  
 
Rationale for choice of primary endpoint  
Platelet count is considered to be a  valid measure of (potential) morbidity caused by 
[CONTACT_513541] a direct and/or feasible measure of the latter. 
Thrombocytopenia is present in all patients by [CONTACT_108]. Platelet count normali zation is the 
primary factor in th e decision to stop daily PE treatment [19, 27]. The increase in platelet 
counts is a lso an important measure for the responsiveness to standard of care treatment. 
The diagnosis of a patient as having primary refractory TTP is based on an ‘inadequate 
platelet response’ over a variable observation period (e.g. , 4 – 10 days) which depends on  
local clinical practice  [28]. For example, a  single cente r retrospecti ve review of 64 patients 
with a clinical diagnosis of TTP identified a platelet count response rate of 5 x 10
9/L per 
[ADDRESS_665274] 3 days of PE treatment to be a predictor of sustained remission after 
PE and of survival [29]. The results of the TITAN trial demonstrated a more rapid return to 
normal platelet counts when caplacizumab was given in conjunction to daily PE, compared 
to placebo plus daily PE (approx. 40% improvement in time to confirmed platelet normalization)  as noted in s ection 1.2.4. 
 Clinical endpoints related to disease presentation such as neurological impairment or 
myocardial ischemia are not suitable as a primary endpoint since they are not sufficiently 
characteristic of TTP. Patients present with a very variable set of signs and symptoms. 
There is also no standardi zed set of criteria or scoring system to measure the clinical 
severity of the disease presentation on which a clinical endpoint could be based. Biomarkers of tissue ischemia are similarly also variable in TTP patients: LDH may be seen as an overall 
marker of tissue ischemia, serum creatini ne of renal impairment and cardiac troponin levels 
for cardiac ischemia but not all patients will have each biomarker elevated, further reducing 
the patient population if this were to become an eligibility criterion.  These elements are 
nonetheless all important in understanding the overall treatment effect and are therefore 
included as secondary endpoints.  
 
This also highlights the challenges of conducting a clinical trial in a very rare condition which 
is further complicated by [CONTACT_513542]. Previous randomized trials in TTP were terminated prematurely due 
to low recruitment rates , including the TITAN trial  which was terminated early for this  after 
enrolling 75 subjects out of a planned 110, at 32 of 56 approved  sites in 13 countries 
worldwide  over a period of 3  years. The STAR study enrolled 3 patients of the planned 220 
from April 2009 to February 2010 after which it was terminated due to low recruitment at Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

planned 100  subjects.  
 
Dose Selection Rationale  
The pharmacology of caplacizumab is two -fold. Caplacizumab affects the functionality of 
vWF, leading to inability  of vWF to bind to platelets. It also  affects the disposition of vWF, 
leading to transient reductions of total vWF:Ag levels during treatment .  
 A population PK/PD model was developed using total vWF:Ag levels as PD endpoint on data 
pooled from the different clinical trials performed in healthy volunteers and in patients. This model adequately describes the PK  and PD observations in the TITAN trial. In vitro 
experiments identified a correlation between target inhibition and target occupancy, which is 
similar across a wide range of vWF:Ag levels.  These in vitro  results support that a 
population PK/PD approach which assesses the effect of caplacizumab o n free and total 
levels of vWF is suited to define adequate dos e levels  in acquired TTP patients.  
 
The dose of 10 mg used in the TITAN trial was proposed based on the information available 
on the suppression of vWF by s.c. administration of caplacizumab i n healthy volunteers  as 
measured ex vivo (ALX -0681- 1.1/08).   
 
The efficacy and safety results from the TITAN  trial confirm the appropriateness of the 
[ADDRESS_665275] on target neutralization  was measu red 
through the RICO assay and this demonstrated the desired sustained suppression of  RICO 
activity to < 20% throughout the treatment period.  
 
A PK/PD model was additionally used to evaluate the expected exposure and corresponding 
effect on total, free and  complexed vWF levels for different dosing scenarios in a virtual TTP 
patient population, through simulations. A virtual population of TTP patients (n=500), with 
characteristics based on the population from the TITAN study, was created by [CONTACT_513543] (mean 81.9 kg ±  22.[ADDRESS_665276] deviation [SD] , 
range 47.5 -150 kg) and model -estimated baseline vWF in the TTP population of the TITAN 
trial as well as  gender  distribution  (M:F 40:60).  
 Simulated scenarios included an ini tial 8 days daily PE procedure with a concomitant s.c. 
daily administration of caplacizumab 1h after the termination of each PE at doses of 2.5, 5, 10, 20 mg (period 1). Subsequently , caplacizumab was assumed to be administered at the 
same dose levels/regi men for additional 30 days in absence of any other PE procedure 
(period 2).

July 20, 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56/112 The % change of the free vWF from baseline increases with the dose, but less than 
dose-proportional. A large inter- individual variability, mainly related to the large variability  
of target expression  (vWF) at study entry, is predicted at all the dose levels. The two lower 
doses (2.5 and 5  mg once daily) lead to a sub -optimal target  inhibition, whereas a higher 
daily dose of caplacizumab than the one tested in the TITAN study (20 m g) does not 
substantially benefit the overall simulated TTP population. Figure 4 shows the 
model -predicted % decrease from baseline of free vWF :Ag levels at the end of period 2 as a 
function of the dose level , including patients treated with placebo .

profiles, 5th and 95th percentiles are shown.  
 
Next to change in levels  of the free vWF as marker for target neutralization, the change in 
levels of total vWF as marker for bleeding risk was evaluated. A threshold of 0.4 IU/mL (or 16 nM) was used, observed in von Willebrand’s disease type I  [31]. Panel D shows  that total 
vWF levels for the proposed dose of 10 mg once daily  would remain above th is threshold 
considered for risk of bleeding events [31].  
 
Based on the previous in vitro  study results and model -predicted levels of biomarkers for 
efficacy (free vWF) and safety (total vWF), the dosing regimen used in the TITAN trial and 
proposed for this study  (10 mg daily) is considered as adequate for reaching the desired 
suppression of t he platelet -binding capacity of (UL)vWF in TTP patients.

assigned by [CONTACT_10966]/IVRS .  
 At randomization, subjects will be randomized to a caplacizumab or placebo  arm in a 1:[ADDRESS_665291] prior to study drug administration  
according to the randomization scheme.  
 
Randomi zation will be stratified by [CONTACT_513551] ( GSC ≤ 12 vs. 
GCS=13 -15). Stratification is foreseen to ensure balanced treatment arms for the key 
secondary endpoints related to neurological involvement and not for the primary endpoint 
for which the stratification parameter is not known to be relevant.

3.3.5.  STUDY DRUG ADMINISTRATION  
 Detailed instructions for study drug administration are available in the manual concerning 
study drug.  
 
Daily PE period  
• Loading i.v. dose: s ubjects will receive a single loading dose of 10 mg study drug by i.v. 
bolus injection from 6 hours to 15 minutes prior to PE (i.e., prior to the first session in 
case PE is given over multiple sessions within  24 hours ) by a health professional ; also  i.v. 
bolus of 10 mg caplacizumab (open label) will be given prior to the [ADDRESS_665293] relapse during the 
treatment extension period (without a prior exacerbation).  
• Daily s.c. dose: From Day 1 and throughout the daily PE period, study drug is to be 
administered daily s.c.  within 2 hours after end of PE (i.e., after the last session in case 
PE is given over multiple sessions within 24 hours ). In case of tapering, study drug 
should be administered as specified above on days PE is done and at approximately the 
same time as on  the day before on days when there is no PE.  Tapering of PE after 
platelet count normalization, defined as reducing its frequency to less than once per day, is strongly discouraged and if considered, should be discussed with the Medical Monitor.  
 
It is exp ected that subjects are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_513504]. 
Exceptions should be discussed with the Medical Monitor.  
At the clinical site, s ubjects will be observed in order to assess adverse reactions.  Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

After subjects are discharged  from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , subjects should self- administer study drug 
(training will be given during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_513506] s.c. inject the study 
drug). Subject s will be i nstruct ed to administer  study drug at approximately the same time 
during the day  and will be requested to be accompanied by a second person during  
administration  and for a period of [ADDRESS_665295] is unable or 
unwilling to self -administer, study drug may be administered by a caregiver who has been 
trained at the site.  
 For all study drug injections , study drug administrations  should occur approximately 
24 hours apart with a minimum of  12 hours apart.   
 Note: On days a visit to the study site is planned, subjects should not self-administer study 
drug prior to their visit. Study drug administration will be done after all visit assessments have been performed.  
 
Subcutaneous injection s are to be performed  in the abdominal region. As injections  are to 
be performed daily, injections need to be performed in a different quadrant than the 
quadrant in which study drug was injected the previous days. Also  note that the area of 
administration needs to be evaluable for local skin reaction. The location  used for the 
administrations  will be noted as a guide/memory aid for the site and for the subject for 
appropriate rotation of next dose administration .  
 In case of an injection site reaction, it should  be followed -up and documented in which 
exact quadrant the skin reaction appears.  
 Information with regard to study drug administration to be recorded in the eCRF will 
include: time of administration, kit number, route of administration . 
 Of note, subjects will be provided with an “In case of emergency card” , which  will contain at 
least following information:  study number , indication of  study drug as “anti -vWF agent”, 
Investigator name  [INVESTIGATOR_201664]/site emergency contact [CONTACT_8972]. 
 
Missed Doses  
For missed doses during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], study drug should be administered as soon as 
possible after the protocol -defined time window and  separated by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_665296] 12  hours of the next Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

July 20, 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 70/112 administration . If the next administration is due within the next 12 hours, then the missed 
dose should not be given.  The next administration should be given at the usual time.  
 
Management of Overdose  
Given the rapid clearance by [CONTACT_513554] ( 28 kD a), the risk of overdose is considered (partially ) self-limiting. In case of 
overdose, there is a potential for  increased risk of bleeding based on the pharmacological 
action of study drug. Subjects should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of clinically relevant bleeding  in case of actual or suspected overdose. In case of clinically 
relevant bleeding associated with (suspected) overdose, appropriate treatment for bleeding accordin g to standard practice should be initiated and treatment with study drug must be 
interrupted. In addition, plasma levels of vWF:Ag and FVIII :C may be determined  locally  to 
assess possible need for treatment with FVIII or FVIII/vWF concentrates. Treatment w ith 
study drug should only be restarted when the bleeding has stopped . The PE treatment, if 
applicable, should continue as clinically indicated.  In case of (suspected) overdose with no clinically relevant bleeding observed, study drug 
administration may c ontinue after the next PE or next daily dose as applicable.  
 Note that permanent discontinuation of study drug should be considered for subjects who 
develop a severe bleeding requiring urgent medical and/or surgical intervention which is accompanied by [CONTACT_513555] :Ag and/or FVIII :C levels which are slow to respond to 
study drug interruption and replacement therapy  (also see section 3.2.3). 
 
3.3.6.  OTHER TREATMENT /MEDICATION 
ADMINISTERED IN THE STUDY  
 
Standard of care treatment:  
• PE with plasma (e.g., fresh frozen plasma, solvent detergent/viral -inactivated plasma, 
cryosupernatant) at 1 to 1.5 x estimated plasma volume daily as of randomization . PE 
[see section  3.1.1 ] should have been started  prior to randomization with volume and  
intensity  at the discretion of the Investigator . PE duration and whether desired volume is 
exchanged in one or more sessions within [ADDRESS_665297] PE (i.e., PE administered prior to randomization) and the start 
of the first PE after randomization  (i.e., the  first on -study PE ) is 24 hours.  
• Once the platelet count is ≥ 150 x 109/L, daily PE should continue for at least 2  days.  
• Tapering of PE after platel et count normaliz ation is strongly discouraged  and if 
considered, should be discussed with the Medical Monitor .

L and in multiple of total plasma volume), plasma produ ct name, plasma exchange 
technique, and specification with regard to single or pooled donor.  
 
Corticosteroid treatment : 
Corticosteroid treatment should  be initiated/continued with  (methyl)prednisolone or 
(methyl)prednisone regimen of at least 1 mg/kg/day  i.v. or p.o. during the daily PE period 
and continued for the 1st week after end of daily PE. Afterwards corticosteroids may be 
tapered at the discretion of the Investigator, with the aim of being corticosteroid -free by 
[CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_665298]-daily PE period, corticosteroid tapering should be reassessed based  on ADAMTS13 
activity data of the previous 2 visits and other clinical signs of underlying disease.  
 
Other immunosuppressive treatment:  
The use of other immunosuppressive treatment (e.g., rituximab) is allowed per standard 
site practice  but should be considered in light of protocol required corticosteroid treatment.  
 
3.3.7.  CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
 
Disallowed medication : desmopressin promotes the release of vWF and is not indicated in 
patients with TTP as it may worsen the condition.  
 Throughout the study, the Investigator may prescribe any concomitant medication needed 
as supportive care , except for desmopressin . Medications associated with the occurrence of 
TTP such as but not limited to clopi[INVESTIGATOR_513507], and should be used with 
caution.  
 
Note that existing  use of a nticoagulant treatment (such as vitamin K antagonists , heparin or  
LMWH , or non-acetyl salicylic acid non -steroidal anti -inflammatory molecules ) needs to be 
stopped prior to the subject’s inclusion in the study but i f need ed can be re- started  at the 
discretion of the Investigator  and should be  used with caution (due to an increased bleeding 
risk). 
 
Any concomitant medication taken during the study (i.e., from signing of ICF until the 
subject’s last visit) must be recorded in the eCRF. Items to be re corded concerning 
concomitant medication include: dose and units of dose, start and end date, administration 
frequency, route of administration, therapeutic indication, brand name (or generic name [CONTACT_513580]) .

Female subjects of childbearing potential (excluding postmenopausal women, sterilized, 
ovariectomized, and hysterectomized women) must agree to use a generally accepted 
adequate contraceptive method  or should agree upon continuous abstinence from 
heterosex ual contact [CONTACT_513556] [ADDRESS_665299] study drug 
administration .  
No additional contraceptive method is needed in case of surgical sterilization (at least 3 months prior to screening), hysterectomy, or a partner who has been vasectomized (at 
least 3 months prior to screening).  
 
Male subjects are not obliged  to use a contraceptive method  specifically for this study .  
The influ ence of caplacizumab treatment on male reproductive  organs has been studied in 
non-human primates and no influence was seen on parameters tested including 
histopathology and sperm quality. Caplacizumab is a biotherapeutic and is not expected to 
pass the blood -sperm barrier or enter cells, therefore a risk to genetic material 
(genotoxicity) can be excluded. 
 
If additional local regulations apply, contraceptives should be used consistent with these.  
 
3.3.8.  TREATMENT COMPLIANCE  
 
To ensure treatment compliance, study drug will be administered by a health care 
professional  (or under supervision of a health care professional in case of training for self -
administration)  during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] , except for ambulatory study drug administration . 
 
For study drug administrations  at the clinical site, t he exact times of study drug 
administration  will be recorded in the eCRF. If a dose is missed , the reason  for the 
not-dosed  IMP should be recorded  in the eCRF . Compliance will be further confirmed by 
[CONTACT_513557].  
 For ambulatory study drug administration , each subject will be provided with a patient diary 
to collect information (e.g., the timing , kit number,  location  of injection ) of each study drug 
administration . For more information on the study patient diary , please refer to  
section  3.3.3 .  Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

 AEs and concomitant medications will be recorded from the study inclusion date (ICF 
signed) to the subject’s last visit.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  ELIGIBILITY PROCEDUR ES 
 A signed and dated ICF , must be obtained before any study -specific procedures are 
performed.  The ICF will foresee retrospective collection of certain data related to the 
diagnosis of the TTP epi[INVESTIGATOR_513508]  (including results of 
ADAMTS13 activity tests performed as per standard of care upon admission ). These 
observations will have preceded the ICF signing.  
 
The screening process begins when the subject or his/her representative signs the ICF and 
continues until  randomization .  
At screening, subjects wil l be screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
(section  3.2) and have other assessments performed as specified in the Schedules of 
Assessments. The results from the screening procedures needed to evaluate eligibility must 
be available prior to randomization . Results from standard of care procedures performed 
before sig ning of the ICF may be used for screening.   
 
Subjects discontinuing, for any reason, without completing all screening evaluations 
successfully and all subjects completing all screening evaluations successfully but who discontinue prior to randomization, will be considered “screen failures”.  
 Data of all subjects screened will be collected in the eCRF in order to assess the numbers 
and characteristics of the excluded subjects, and the reasons for their exclusion.  
 For details with regard to randomization, please refer to section 3.3.1. 
 
Assessments and procedures should be performed as outlined in the Schedules of 
Assessments.  
Screening and baseline can be on the same day as long as the above applies.

Appendix  9.1. 
 
At all other  time p oints defined in the Schedules of Assessments , the neurologic al status of 
the subjects will also be ass essed by [CONTACT_513558] 
(including severity) or not of the following: coma, stupor, seizures, disorientation/confusion, 
hemiparesis/ -plegia, focal deficit, agitation, and dysarthria  (primarily physical examination 
and as per standard of care:  electroencephalogram  [EEG], magnetic resonance imaging 
[MRI], …). 
In case coma or stupor are present, the GCS needs to be completed.  
 The Investigator will determine whether the observed abnormality is to be considered as a 
clinically significant TTP event.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT  
 
The cognitive  status of the subjects will be assessed using the SMMSE [32] according to the 
time points defined in the Schedules of Assessments . 
 The SMMSE is  a validated test used  to examine the cognitive mental status of a subject. It 
can be used to screen for cognitive impairment, to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment a t a given point in time and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an 
individual over time . The SMMSE measures various domains of cognitive functions including 
orientation to time and place; registration; concentration; short- term memory; naming 
familiar items; repeating a common expression; and the ability to read and follow written 
instructions (write a sentence, construct a diagram and follow a three -step verbal 
command).  The SMMSE is a brief 30 -point question naire which  can be completed in  
approxi mately 10 min utes. Scores between 26 -30 are considered normal in the general 
population; subjects with scores between [ADDRESS_665304] mild cognitive impairment; those 
who score between [ADDRESS_665305] moderate cognitive impairment; scores between [ADDRESS_665306] the SMMSE. Therefore, the normal value is corrected for degree of schooling and age (patient -specific norms on the 
basis of age and educational level are available). If the subject is unable to  complete the 
test due to a physical handicap (e.g. blindness) , the value of the questions which cannot be 
completed is subtracted from 30, and the resulting number is used as the denominator for 
the test score. If a denominator of less than [ADDRESS_665307] is unconscious, the score is 0/30.

July 20, 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 81/112 [IP_ADDRESS].  ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
General information on evaluation and reporting of AEs is provided in section  3.5. 
 
All AEs occurring between the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until completion of 
the subject’s last visit  must be documented in the source documents and the eCRF.  For 
adverse events related to injection site reactions, documentation must also include the 
location  of the event . 
 
Criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding (e.g., laboratory, vital 
signs), a complication of a protocol mandated procedure (e.g., b lood draw, injection of 
study drug), or a change in physical examination findings should be reported as an AE are 
as follows, but not limited to:  
 1. Result/finding is associated with accompanying clinical signs and symptoms (new onset 
or aggravated in severi ty of frequency from baseline condition), and/or  
2. Result/finding requires extra diagnostic testing (other than diagnostic exclusion tests) 
or medical/surgical intervention, and/or  
3. Result/finding would require a change in study drug dosing or discontinuation  from the 
study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy, and/or  
4. Result/finding leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of an SAE, and/or  
5. Result/finding is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_737].  
 
Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error and merely repeating an 
abnormal test does not require reporting as an AE.   
 Adverse Event of Interest  
In the AE record, t he Investigator will need to indicate whether the AE is considered an 
event indicative of  an increased bleeding tendency , manifesting as e.g., overt bleeding, 
bruising, petechiae, etc . 
 Exacerbations/Relapses  
All exacerbations and relapses must be considered covered by [CONTACT_941]  “another medically 
important serious event” criterion  and must be reported as SAE .

REPORTING  
 
3.5.1.  ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
AE definitions will be followed as stated in the “Note for Guidance on clinical safety data 
management: definitions and standards for expedited reporting” (International Conference 
on Harmonization [ICH] topic E2A).  
 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a 
medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have 
a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can  therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product, whether or not 
considered related to that medicinal ( investigational or non -investigational) product.  
 
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency 
from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities.  
 In differentiating between medical history and AEs, the following points will be considered: 
• Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms or 
treatment are present up to the timing of signing of informed consent are recorded as medical history (e.g., seasonal allergy without acute complaints).  
• Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or treatment are present after signing of informed consent, but with unchanged severity, 
are rec orded as medical history (e.g., allergic pollinosis).  
• Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be documented as AEs.  
 
All AEs will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until completion of 
the su bject’s last visit.  
 
A TEAE is any AE temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether considered 
related to the study drug or not. TEAEs are recorded from the start of study drug 
administration, until completion of the subject’s last visit.  
 It is the responsibility of the Investigator to collect all AEs (both serious and non -serious) 
derived by [CONTACT_19702], unsolicited reports of subjects, by [CONTACT_4171], and by [CONTACT_513562]: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

July 20, 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 87/112 open questioning (e.g., “How have you felt since I saw you last?”; “Is there  anything new 
that you wish to discuss?”).  
 
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_513563]. AE entry should indicate time of onset and end time and rating of the seriousness (see section  3.5.2), severity (see section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), and outcome (see 
section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) of the AEs, relationship to study drug, PE, and corticosteroids  (see 
section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), action taken regarding study drug (see section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), and conco mitant 
therapy taken for the AE.  
 The Investigator will judge upon the severity of the AEs and relation to study drug and study procedures.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  AE SEVERITY  
 
The severity of AEs will be rated on a 3 -point scale:  
• Mild: discomfort noticed but no disr uption of normal daily activity   
• Moderate: discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
• Severe: incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activity   
 It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: a severe AE i s not 
necessarily serious. For example, itching for several days may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious. 
 
Please refer to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0) as 
guidance for assessment of severity of laborator y abnormalities. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  OUTCOME  
 
The outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows:  
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recovering/resolving  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
• Not recovered/not resolve d 
• Fatal 
• Unknown

July 20, 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 88/112 [IP_ADDRESS].  RELATION TO DRUG OR STUDY 
PROCEDURES 
 
The assessment of the  causal relationship between an AE and the administration of 
treatment is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the 
completion of the eCRF.  
 The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal 
relationship” to the study treatment in question. Possible answers are:  
• Unlikely/Not related  
• Possibly related  
• Related

3.5.2.  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS 
 
An SAE is any untoward medical  occurrence that at any dose meets any of the following 
conditions:  
• Results in death.  Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

July 20, 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 89/112 • Is life -threatening: the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe.  
• Requires in -patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
an AE associated with a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_513513]:  
- The admission re sults in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 12 hours.  
- The admission is pre -planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to the 
start of the study).  
- The admission is not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_513514]). 
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_471426] “medically important” and as such may be reportable as an SAE dependent on clinical judgment. In addition, where local regulatory authorities s pecifically 
require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability means a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s functions.  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is another medically important serious event as judged by [CONTACT_737], or is defined 
as requiring intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above 
(including suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product should be 
reported as an SAE). Other examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; o r development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Any AE is considered an SAE if it is associated with clinical signs or symptoms judged by 
[CONTACT_95334] a significant clinical impact.  
 
All exacerbations and relapses must be considered covered by [CONTACT_941] “another medically 
important serious event” criterion  and must be reported as SAE . 
 
A treatment -emergent SAE is any SAE temporally associated with the use of study drug, 
whether considered related to the study drug or not.  
 The Investigator or clinical site personnel should notify the contract research organization 
(CRO) of all SAEs, regardless of relationship to the study drug, within 24  hours of clinical 
site personnel becoming aware of the event (see Investigator Site File ).  
The Investigator will provide the initial notification by [CONTACT_29658] a completed “SAE Notification Form”, which must include the Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the event to 
study drug, and must be signed by [CONTACT_737].

The SAE should also be recorded in the eCRF. Any medications necessary for the treatment 
of the SAE must be recorded on the concomitant medication section of the eCRF. 
 
SAEs that begin after the subject’s participation in the study is complete, but that the 
Investigator considers to be related to study drug, should be reported to the CRO/Sponsor 
at any time.  
 
3.5.3.  SUSPECTED UNEXPECTED  SERIOUS 
ADVERSE REACTIONS  
 
Unexpected adverse reactions are adverse reactions of which the nature or severity is not 
consistent with the applicable product information (as described in the Reference Safety 
Information, provided in the Investigator’s Brochure).  
 
The CRO will report expedited the following S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the IEC/IRB on behalf of the 
Sponsor:  
• S[LOCATION_003]Rs that have arisen in the current clinical study that was assessed by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB.  
• S[LOCATION_003]Rs that have arisen in other clinical studies of the same Sponsor and with the same 
study drug and that could have consequences for the safety of the subjects involved in 
the current clinical study that was assessed by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB.  
 
The CRO will report expedited all S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the relevant CA on behalf of the Sponsor.  
 
The Sponsor (or the CRO on behalf of the Sponsor) will also report to all concerne d 
Investigators all SAEs that are unlisted (unexpected) and associated with the use of the 
drug.  
 
The expedited reporting will occur no later than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor (or the 
CRO on behalf of the Sponsor) has first knowledge of the adverse r eactions.  
 For fatal or life -threatening cases the term will be maximal 7 calendar days for a preliminary 
report with another 8 days for completion of the report.

AEs reporting, including S[LOCATION_003]Rs, will be carried out in accordance with applicable local 
regulations. For reported deaths, the Investigator should supply the Sponsor and the 
IEC/IRB with any additional requested information (e.g., autopsy reports and terminal 
medical reports).  
 
After termination of the clinical study  (last subject last visit in the study), any unexpected 
safety issue that changes the risks benefit analysis and is likely to have an impact on the subjects who have participated in it, will be reported by [CONTACT_513564] a uthority(ies) concerned together with proposed actions.  
 
3.5.5.  FOLLOW -UP OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
AEs will be handled according to common clinical practice. If necessary, in order to obtain additional information to ensure safety to the subject, additional blood and u rine samples 
may be taken at the discretion of the Investigator. Information relative to other means of investigational diagnostics used in relation to the AE will also be communicated.  
 AEs are recorded from signing the ICF until completion of the subject ’s last visit . TEAEs are 
recorded from the start of study drug administration, until the subject’s last visit .  
 All AEs occurring at any time during the study (including the FU period) will be followed until 
stable  outcome .  
 
3.5.6.  OTHER REPORTABLE INF ORMATION  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  PREGNANCY   
 The Investigator must report to the Sponsor any pregnancy occurring in a study subject, or 
in his partner, during the subject’s participation in this study and within  2 months after final 
study drug dose.  
 
All pregnancies  will be documented on the Pregnancy Report provided to the Investigator. 
The report should be submitted within the same timelines as an SAE, although a pregnancy 
per se is not considered an SAE. The progression of the pregnancy and the eventual birth (if 
applicable) must be  followed- up using the Pregnancy Report in which the Investigator has to  
report on the health of the mother and of the child. The health of the child must be followed 
for 30 days after birth for any significant medical issues.

[IP_ADDRESS].  ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY EFFICACY 
ENDPOINT  
 
Time to platelet count response  in the caplacizumab  arm and placebo arm will be compared  
by [CONTACT_14664] a  two-sided stratified Log-rank test  (significance level of 5%)  based on a 
Kaplan -Meier (KM) analysis, with severity of neurological involvement as stratification 
factor.  Time to platelet count response  will be measured from  the time of the first i.v. 
loading dose of study drug after randomization . In the KM analysis an observation will be 
censored if the defined time interval of [ADDRESS_665324] administration of study drug is not 
met, due to any cause  (e.g., endpoint not being reached within this time interval or subject 
lost to follow -up). The censoring plan will be detailed in the SAP. The analysis will be 
performed on the mITT population (ICH E9 guidance), which comprises all randomized 
subjects who have received at least one study drug dose. Subjects will be analyzed 
according to the treatment to which they were assigned. Crossover of subjects who 
experience a recurrence of TTP during the study to open -label caplacizumab  will not  affect 
the primary efficacy endpoint analysis as an exacerbation can only occur after the primary endpoint has been reached.

July 20, 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 96/112 sequence approach will be applied. The key secondary endpoints are hierarchically ordered. 
This allows statistical testing for these endpoints at the same nominal significance level of 
5% without adjustment, as long as the tests occur in the pre -defined sequential order, and 
given that all null hypotheses to be tested for e ndpoints with a higher rank (including the 
primary endpoint) are rejected. As soon as a test is not statistically significant for a certain 
endpoint, i.e. as soon as the sequence breaks, no confirmatory testing will be done for remaining endpoints lower in  the ranking. Statistical comparison between the two treatment 
arms for the key secondary endpoints will be done by [CONTACT_513565] (in hierarchical order):  
1. Proportion of subjects with TTP-related death, a recurrence of TTP, or at l east one 
treatment -emergent major thromboembolic event ( e.g., myocardial infarction, 
cerebrovascular accident, pulmonary embolism or DVT ) during the study drug 
treatm ent period (including  extensions): Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test with 
adjustment for severi ty of neurological involvement (stratification factor used in 
randomization).  Subjects who have crossed over from placebo to caplacizumab will 
be evaluated in the initial treatment arm (placebo) only.  
2. Proportion of subjects with a recurrence of TTP  in the overall study period (including 
4-week FU period): Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test with adjustment for severity of 
neurological involvement (stratification factor used in randomization). Subjects who 
have crossed over from placebo to caplacizumab will be eval uated in the initial 
treatment arm (placebo) only.  
3. Proportion of subjects with refractory TTP, defined as absence of platelet count 
doubling after [ADDRESS_665325] treatment, and LDH >ULN: Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test with adjustment for severity of neur ological involvement (stratification 
factor used in randomization). Subjects who have crossed over from placebo to 
caplacizumab will be evaluated in the initial treatment arm (placebo) only.  
4. Time to normalization of all three organ damage marker levels: stratified Log -rank 
test based on a KM analysis with adjustment for severity of neurological involvement and for an additional factor defining whether the subject has abnormal values at 
baseline for LDH only (not for cTnI or for serum creatinine) or not. S ubjects who 
have crossed over from placebo to caplacizumab before having reached the endpoint 
will be censored at time of crossover.  
 In addition to the confirmatory statistical tests, standard summary statistics will be provided 
for all key secondary endpoints. Both  (a) proportion of subjects with TTP-related death, a 
recurrence of TTP, or at least one treatment -emergent major thromboembolic event (e.g., 
myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, pulmonary embolism or DVT)  during the

PHARMACODYNAMIC PARAMETERS  
 
The procedures for obtaining caplacizumab  plasma  concentrations are found in 
section  3.4.3 . 
 
Evaluation of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  
Individual study drug concentrations will be listed. In addition a listing of the actua l

 PK/PD  Model 
vWF:Ag concentration data from the current study will be analyz ed as well as caplacizumab 
concentration data using  a population PK/PD model. This  analysis will be performed on the 
mITT population  (data  will be  pre-processed to ensure consistency in the dataset  for doses, 
dosing times and PE  procedure ). The generated d ata from the current study will be pooled 
with clinical data previously used for developi[INVESTIGATOR_513515] /PD modeling dealing with the three  
phase I studies  and the two phase II study on high risk PCI patients and TTP patients . The 
final PK/PD model previously de veloped for describing the PK of caplacizumab, administered 
as adjunctive treatment to PE in TTP  patients will be validated and eventually adjusted 
based on the new available data in TTP patients.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_513516] l be estimated together  with the inter -individual variabilit ies. Effects of 
subject demographics, laboratory parameter  values, and other covariates on the PK of 
caplacizumab  and on PD parameters  will be explored. ADAMTS13 data will be investigated 
as a mar ker of the disease status. An additional model will be also developed for describing 
platelet count data. The results of the population PK /PD analysis will be reported in an 
independent Modeling and  Simulation report.

The DSMB will evaluate the safety data periodically (see section 3.1). 
 The following analyses will be performed to assess the safety of subjects in  this study.  
• The incidence and type of AEs.  
• The incidence and type of SAEs.  
• The incidence and type of related AEs (including bleeding -related AEs, PE -related AEs, 
and corticosteroid -related AEs ). 
• The laboratory parameters and change from baseline in these laboratory parameters.  
• The incidence of antibodies to caplacizumab . 
 
All safety and  immunogenicity analyses will be performed using the Safety Population of all 
subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_665327] actually received.  
 AEs will be fully described and coded ac cording to the Medical Dictionary for regulatory 
Activities  (MedDRA). A treatment -emergent analysis of AEs will be done. Frequency of 
subjects presenting AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, adverse drug reactions, and SAEs will 
be tabulated for each treatment group by [CONTACT_6657].  AEs of 
special interest will be analyzed separately.  
 For laboratory parameters, descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, and maximum) will be computed on the actual values and the change from 
baseline for each parameter. All laboratory values will be categorized according to their normal ranges as below, within or above normal. A shift table versus baseline will be 
created.  
 
Vital signs variables will be fully depi[INVESTIGATOR_441218] (for actual values and 
changes from baseline) and shift tables according to their normal ranges. ECG findings will 
be reported . 
 Abnormal findings in physical examinations will be listed.  
 Immunogenicity will be assessed through listing of individual results by [CONTACT_513567].  Immunogenicity data will be correlated with PK and PD readout. In 
addition, immunogenicity will be correlated with possible safety findings.

4.3.  SUBJECT INFORMATION AND 
CONSENT  
 
Each subject must give written consent according to local requirements after the nature of 
the study h as been fully explained. The consent form must be signed before performance of 
any study -related activity. The consent form that is used must be approved by [CONTACT_513569]/IRB. The informed consent should be in accord ance with principles that originated in the Declaration of Helsinki, current ICH and 
GCP guidelines, applicable regulatory requirements, and Sponsor policy.  
 
Before undertaking any study -related procedure in the study, the Investigator or an 
authorized member of the investigational staff must explain to potential subjects or his/her 
legal representative the aims, methods, objectives, potential clinical benefits , and potential 
hazards of the study, and any discomfort participation in the study may entail. Subjects or 
his/her legal representative will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that the 
subject may refuse to participate or withdraw from the study, at any time, without penalty 
or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled and that all data collected up to 
the point of withdrawal will be used and reported in an anonymized way. Finally, they will 
be told that the Investigato r will maintain a subject identification register for the purposes 
of long -term follow -up if needed and that their records may be accessed by [CONTACT_19397], authorized Sponsor staff, and Sponsor representative without violating the confidentiality of the subject, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_6983](s) or 
regulations. By [CONTACT_513570]/her legal representative is authorizing 
such access, and agrees to allow his/her study physician to recontact [CONTACT_513571], if needed.  
 
If a subject is unable to read or if a legally acceptable representative is  unable to read, an 
impartial witness should be present during the entire informed  consent discussion. After the 
written ICF and any other written  information to be provided to subjects is read and 
explained to the subject or the  subject’s legally acceptable representative, and after the 
subject or the subject’s legally acceptable representative has orally consented to  the 
subject’s participation in the trial, and, if capable of doing so, has signed and personally 
dated the  ICF, the witness should sign and personally date the consent form. By [CONTACT_404169], the witness attests that the information in the  consent form and any other 
written information was accurately explained to, and  apparently understood by, the subject Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

given by [CONTACT_513572]’s legally accepta ble representative.  
 
Subject ICF: The language used in the oral and written information about the study, 
including the ICF, should be as nontechnical as practical and should be understandable to the subject or the subject's legal representative. The subject will be given sufficient time to read the ICF and given the opportunity to ask questions. After this explanation and before 
entry into the study, consent should be appropriately recorded by [CONTACT_19720]'s 
personally dated signature [CONTACT_19731] [CONTACT_513573]. After 
having obtained the consent, a copy of the ICF must be given to the subject. The other 
original of the ICF will be retained by [CONTACT_226054] “Investigator Site File”.  
 
Subject's legal representati ve ICF: In emergency situations, when the subject is not able to 
personally provide inform consent , the consent of the subject's legally acceptable 
representative, if present, should be  requested. The subject´s legally acceptable 
representative consent mus t be addressed to the representative and provided in a separate 
document. When prior consent of the subject is not possible, and the subject’s  legally 
acceptable representative is not available, enrollment of the subject should  require 
measures described in the protocol and/or elsewhere, with documented  approval/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1686]/IEC, to protect the rights, safety, and wellbeing  of the subject and to 
ensure compliance with applicable regulatory  requirements. The subject or the subject's 
legally a cceptable representative should be informed about the trial as soon as possible and 
re-consent to continue  must be given . 
 In this clinical study,  the following Patient Information Consent Form  will be used, prepared 
and applicable in the different participating countries, according with their local normative:  
• Patient ICF (for re -consenting after subject  becomes conscious) and Legal Acceptable  
Representative consent – for initial consenting for unconscious subjects .  
• Independent Physician Authorization Form : Form signed by [CONTACT_513574] .  
Summary of the procedure:  
The Investigator or a designee is to explain the study and ICF to the subject  or the subject’s 
legally-acceptable  representative and answer any questions. The ICF is to be signed by [CONTACT_402266]’s legally -acceptable  representative , before any study -related 
procedures are performed. A copy of the ICF is to be provided to the subject  or the subject’s 
legally -acceptable  representative. In some countries the consent may be signed by [CONTACT_513575], including but not limited to independent physicians qualified to provide consent for subjects who are unable to provide 
consent for themselves.  
 
The person concerned must be duly informed about the research project as soon as this becomes possible and must re -consent once possible. He or she may subsequently give or Document ID: 25_A0068_15_0010          ADMS Version Number: 3.0          Printing Date: 22/Jul/2016

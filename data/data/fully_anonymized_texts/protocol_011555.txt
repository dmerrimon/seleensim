Ethics Board (REB) and Health Canada, respectively]. Following appropriate informed consent 
procedures, subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility before 
randomization. 
Prior to surgery, each subject will have baseline information collected which will include medical 
history, injury/disease etiology, diagnosis, clinical laboratory assessments (including serum for 
anti-B2A antibody analysis), pain and disability assessments, in addition to radiographic 
1magmg. 
At the screening/pre-oper ative visit anterior/posterior (A/P), lateral and oblique X-rays will be 
collected. Historical X-rays, taken up to 24 weeks prior to the planned date of surgery, will also 
be accepted provided they are inclusive of A/P, lateral and oblique views and are available in a 
readily copi[INVESTIGATOR_764326] [e.g., electronic images on Compact Disc (CD)]. These pre-operative X­
rays will be the baseline for subsequent safety evaluation. 
As part of eligibility determination, the Investigator will review any relevant diagnostic imaging 
results and comorbidities to ensure that subjects meet the appropriate eligibility criteria and that 
ankle or hindfoot arthrodesis surgery with supplemental graft material is indicated. Eligible 
subjects will be randomized as close to the procedure as possible, preferably on the day of the 
surgery. 
Approximately 480 subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups in a 2: 1 ratio 
(320 AMPLEX: 160 ABG). 
Surgeries will be performed by [CONTACT_17685]-certified/board eligible orthopedic surgeons. Perioperative 
prophylactic antibiotics will be administered before surgical incision in accordance with 
investigational site guidelines. Standard anesthesia procedures will be used. Standard surgical 
technique will be employed to gain access to each fusion site and to ensure rigid fixation of the 
fusion site. The joint will be exposed and prepared as per standard practice (please refer to the 
Surgical Manual for more details). The graft material should be placed in the joint space to 
minimize the chance of extrusion while maximizing bone-on-bone contact. Once the graft is 
placed, internal fixation screws will be placed across the joint. At least one ( 1) and up to three 
(3)screws can be used per joint. Supplemental pi[INVESTIGATOR_764327], as well as
supplemental screws and plates external to the fusion site(s). The surgical site will be closed in

on the case report form (CRF).
Subjects will be followed for [ADDRESS_1047170] discharge clinical visits will include visits at 2, 6, 
12, 24, 52, and 78 weeks. Adverse event data will be collected throughout the study. The 
primary endpoint will be assessed at 52 weeks.

A Pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment will be conducted to assess the amount of B2A in blood 
(plasma) after surgery, on Days 1, 2, 4, 7, and 15, and will include a baseline, pre-procedure 
evaluation. The PK assessment will include a sub-set of up to approximately [ADDRESS_1047171] 20 AMPLEX subjects. Both genders 
will be represented. Blood samples will be collected and processed to plasma for laboratory 
evaluation (plasma B2A concentration). Data will be descriptive in nature and report, to the 
extent possible, the following for plasma: AUC, AUCt, % AUC extrap, Cmax, Tmax, tYi, lamda 
z, CVF, Vz/F.

AMPLEX, B2A Enhanced Ceramic Granules (AMPLEX), is the Investigational Device supplied 
in kit form and must be used as a system. When fully prepared according to the IFU, AMPLEX 
consists of osteoconductive granules (BVF) with bound synthetic B2A peptide. 
The AMPLEX kit contains two sterile, non-pyrogenic components that must be used as a system: 
•Part I: Bone void filler (BVF); I to 2 millimeter (mm) diameter granules, 5 cm3/vial,
two (2) vials per kit
•Part 2: Lyophilized B2A Peptide Powder, 2.8 mg/vial
Part 1: BVF consists of two (2) vials of 5 cc, sterile, ceramic granules. The granules are 
composed of 20% HA and 80% P-TCP. 
Part 2: Lyophilized B2A Peptide Powder, is formulated as a sterile product containing 2.8 mg 
B2A with mannitol and glycine as excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and is lyophilized in borosilicate glass vials. Each 
vial contains a white to off-white caked powder composed of highly purified B2A (acetate salt), 
mannitol (USP), and glycine (USP) under an atmosphere of nitrogen (nitrogen headspace gas). 
The vials are closed with a Daikyo VIO RB2-TR FluroTec® coated stopper and with an 
aluminum-based, flip-top closure. 
For preparation of implant-ready AMPLEX by [CONTACT_764358], the lyophilized 
drug product (DP) is reconstituted in sterile water for injection (WFI). In-use stability of the 
reconstituted drug product has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_764359] a six (6) hour period. After reconstitution, a defined volume of B2A solution 
is wiithdrawn, added to the granules (BVF) and mixed according to the IFU. Implant-ready 
AMPLEX, with 0.225mg B2A/cm3 granules should be used within four (4) hours of preparation. 
The control materiial, ABG, is harvested at the discretion of the surgeon from a location other 
than the graft site, for example, the calcaneus, proximal tibia, distal tibia or iliac crest and 
administered by [CONTACT_764360]. 
The aggregate volume of graft material (AMPLEX or ABG) utilized in index joints will be at the 
discretion of the surgeon, provided the joint space(s) can be adequately filled with graft material 
according to the following parameters: 
•Single hindfoot joint fusion: up to 5 cm3
•Double or triple hindfoot fusion: each individual joint up to 5 cm3, but overall, not
more than 10 cm3 for the full complement of joints

STATISTICAL METHODS 
Sample Size: 
Assuming true success rates of tbe primary endpoint to be 60% for ABG and 62% for AMPLEX 
groups, respectively, 396 subjec ts are needed to maintain 85% power to demonstrate non­
inferiority of AMPLEX to ABG with a non-inferiority margin of -12% (AMPLEX minus ABG) 
at a type I error rate of I-sided 5% in a 2:1 randomization (264 for AMPLEX and 132 for ABG). 
To account for approximately 15% lost to follow-up, a total of 480 subjects (320 for AMPLEX 
and 160 for ABG) will be randomized. 
Analysis Set: 
Modlified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) analysis set: The mITT analysis set will include all randomized 
subjects who have an attempted fusion of the index joint(s).

Page l l of 91 
Per-protocol (PP) analysis set: The PP analysis set will consist of all randomized subjects that: 
[1]complete the fusion procedure and receive either AMPLEX or ABG as assigned, [2] meet
critical study eligibility criteria, and [3] have no significant protocol deviations.
Efficacy Analysis: 
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the mITT population. A sensitivity analysis will 
be conducted for the PP population. In the analysis on the mITT population, subjects who do not 
receive the assigned treatment will be analyzed as randomized. 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of subjects who meet all of the following 
criteria for the SPC at 52 weeks: 
•Improvement in pain on weight-bearing at fusion site k 20 mm reduction from
baseline on 100 mm VAS)
•Absence of significant graft harvest site pain ( < 20 mm on 100 mm VAS)
•Improvement in Foot and Ankle Ability Measure Activities of Daily Living subscale
(FAAM-ADL) (�8 points improvement from baseline)
•Absence of device related or procedure related SAEs (up to W,eek 52)
•Absence of secondary surgical or nonsurgical interventions intended to promote
fusion (up to Week 52)
The key secondary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of subjects who meet the following 
criteria for the CT radiographic fusion success at 52 weeks: 
•Radiographic evidence of fusion by [CONTACT_3610] (� 50% bone bridging across the joint
space for the full complement of joints in the absence of secondary surgical or
nonsurgical interventions intended to promote fusion)
The primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed by a fixed-sequence 
procedure according to the following order to maintain the overall Type 1 error rate to a one­
sided 5% for non-inferiority and a one-sided 2.5% for superiority testings. 
1.Non-inferiority of AMPLEX to ABG in the primary efficacy endpoint
2.Non-inferiority of AMPLEX to ABG in the key secondary efficacy endpoint
3.Superiority of AMPLEX to ABG in the key secondary efficacy endpoint
4.Superiority of AMPLEX to ABG in the primary efficacy endpoint
Testing procedure will begin with the non-inferiority in the primary efficacy endpoint, and each 
test will be conducted without adjustment of multiplicity as long as all preceding tests are 
significant. The non;inferiority will be claimed if the lower bound of the 2;sided 90% confidence 
interval (CI) for the difference in the proportions (AMPLEX minus ABG) is greater than -12.0%.

The superiority will be claimed if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI is greater than zero. 
The CI will be constructed with the normal approximation to the binomial. 
For the primary and key secondary analyses, the last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
approach will be U!sed for subjects with missing SPC endpoint at 52 weeks.

1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background Trial Code: 000226 Date: 14Mar2018 
E-Protocol Amendment-[ZIP_CODE]; Ver. 1.0
Supersedes: Ver. Protocol Amendment 1.[ADDRESS_1047196] work in concert to enable normal ambulation and 
movement. In some individuals, either from traumatic injury or due to the degenerative effects of 
arthritis, motion at one or more of these joints becomes markedly painful, resulting in impaired 
function and quality of life. 1 When non-operative measures are no longer effective, arthrodesis is an
accepted operative treatment option for patients with severe pain or disability caused by [CONTACT_764361]. 
Approximately 110,000 foot and ankle arthrodesis were performed in tbe [LOCATION_002] in 2009 and 
this number is increasing annually because of both an aging population and the continued 
prevalence of contributory comorbidities. 2 Arthrodesis is designed to relieve pain and restore 
function associated with the numerous maladies that cause joint destruction, including trauma, 
diabetes, inflammatory arthridities, seronegative arthropathy, instability, malalignment, and 
congenital.3"[ADDRESS_1047197] common 
complications resulting in morbidity and disabi lity.9•[ADDRESS_1047198], there are a number of factors 
associated with a higher risk for a nonunion result, including: age::: [ADDRESS_1047199] use, etc., which often requires the use of bone grafting to improve 
fusion rates and, ultimately long-term clinical outcomes.12 
The biological process involved in bone regeneration requires (i) osteogenic potential that is 
capable of directly providing cells to the newly forming bone, (ii) osteoinductive factors that are 
able to cause the osteoblastic differentiation of osteogeprogenitor stem cells and (iii) 
osteoconductive scaffold that facilitate the neovascularization and supports the ingrowth of bone. 
Successful fusion surgery must engage the bone regeneration process to produce new bone to 
bridge the area previously occupi[INVESTIGATOR_764331]. To enable this 
process, orthopedic surgeons often will harvest bone, known as autologous bone graft (ABG), from 
elsewhere in the body to fill the joint. 
ABG provides an effective osteoconductive scaffold for new bone formation and contains 
appropriate growth factors and cells to potentiate new bone formation (osteoinductive). The 
availability of local ly-harvested bone in ankle or foot arthrodesis can be limited, therefore, a second 
harvest site is often required from either the iliac crest, proximal or distal tibia to facilitate the 
acquisition of enough bone to support the graft substitute application. Harvesting ABG, however, 
is associated with both short- and long-term morbidity. Complications of autograft harvest include 
blood loss, postoperative pain, fracture, infection, other non-infec tious wound complications, 
heterotopic bone formation, hernia, and nerve injury.13"16 Baumhauer and colleagues recently

reported the results of a prospective randomized study of patients undergoing ankle and hindfoot 
fusion procedures U1sing ABG harvested from one of four sites (iliac crest, proximal tibia, distal 
tibia, and calcaneus). Clinically significant pain at the bone graft harvest site was reported by 35% 
of patients 3 weeks postoperatively and 18% had persistent pain up to 1 year.17 A review of the 
literature suggests that the overall complication rate from tibial graft sites, although it has become a 
favored source for autograft material for foot and ankle surgery, is 5.5%.[ADDRESS_1047200] ications 
range in severity from hematoma/seroma and paresthesia to infection, fracture and invas ion of the 
joint space. 
Though advances have been made in improving the safety and efficacy of foot and ankle 
arthrodesis procedures by [CONTACT_764362], more recent emphasis has been placed on 
the biological aspects of bone healing and the development of alternatives that eliminate the need to 
harvest bone graft to augment fusion.19 AMPLEX is in development as an alternative to ABG in 
hindfoot and ankle fusion procedures that require supplemental graft material, including tibiotalar, 
talocalcaneal, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid fusions. This investigational bone graft substitute 
is comprised of two parts: 1) bone void filler (BVF) granules made from hydroxyapatite (HA) and 
beta tricalcium-phosphate (PTCP) that functions as an osteoconductive scaffold and 2) the synthetic 
peptide B2A that augments local osteodifferentiation. Clinical studies on AMPLEX demonstrated 
benefit as a bone SU1bstitute without the need for a second procedure and the resulting morbidity 
associated with that second procedure. In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_764332] 24 subjects comparing 
AMP LEX to ABG, bone fusion was similar in both groups, and the AMPLEX group demonstrated 
improvements in bone density, healing and patient functional capacity.20 No device-related 
complications were reported. 
1.2 Scientific Justification for Conducting the Trial 
AMP LEX is an investigational medical device supplied in kit form (AMPLEX kit) and must be 
used as a system. When fully prepared, AMPLEX consists of osteoconductive ceramic granules 
(BVF) mixed with synthetic B2A peptide. The principal mode of action of the device is based on 
the osteoconductive granules that act as a scaffold for cellular ingrowth; B2A augments that action. 
The sterile ceramic granules, supplied by a third party vendor, are currently cleared for use as a 
BVF for bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system (e.g., extremities, spi[INVESTIGATOR_203571]) that are not 
intrinsic to the stability of the bony structure. These defects may be surgically- or traumatically­
created osseous defects to the bone (K063527, MBCP+).[ADDRESS_1047201] cells, the basis of bone repair. B2A, a synthetic peptide, 
complements the action of the granules by [CONTACT_764363] (BMPRs), augmenting the cell response to local bone 
morphogenetic proteins (BMPs).27·32

Page 23 of 91 
The growth and differentiation of pre-osteoblasts on the ceramic granules is assisted and 
complemented by B2A in a cooperative process with the native osteoinductive proteins generated 
as a part of normal bone healing. B2A therefore acts primarily as a selective positive receptor 
modulator, increasing the sensitivity of cells to natural (endogenous), physiologically-active levels 
of BMP-2, and thereby [CONTACT_764364]. The augmentation of osteodifferentiation 
can only occur, however, when B2A and BMP-[ADDRESS_1047202] fashion. 
1.3 Benefit / Risk Aspects 
Arthrodesis remains the most common surgical procedure for patients with debilitating ankle and 
hindfoot arthritis. Average nonunion rates remain high (10-15%) but can be substantially higher in 
patients with co-morbid factors such as diabetes and other metabolic diseases, obesity, smoking, 
age� [ADDRESS_1047203] that a major differentiator is the lack of pain, dysfunction and morbidity 
related to graft donor sites when bone graft replacement products are utilized. 
The inclusion of patient reported outcomes, functional evaluations and quality of life assessments is 
therefore important in evaluating the differences between these approaches. The current clinical 
trial was designed with this in mind, incorporating both radiologic assessment of fusion rate and 
validated scales to assess pain and functional outcome_34-4o 
1.4 Clinical Benefit 
The proposed clinical study is designed to demonstrate that AMPLEX is non-inferior to ABG for 
bone fusion in a population indicated for single, double, or triple hindfoot arthrodesis or ankle 
arthrodesis surgery with supplemental graft material. The potential benefit to AMPLEX subjects is 
successful fusion of the ankle or hindfoot via an operation that is smaller in magnitude and devoid 
of the risks and additional pain associated with the harvesting of autogenous bone graft. Subjects 
who receive AMPLEX may experience the following potential benefits:

1.Similar rate of fusion compared to autograft without the additional risks of the
autograft procedure (i.e., harvest site pain, longer anesthetic and longer procedure,
harvest site infection, harvest site fracture, or other complications)
2.Higher rate of fusion compared to autograft without the additional risks of the
autograft procedure
3.Similar or higher rate of fusion at earlier time points than auto graft without the
additional risks of the autograft procedure
4.Similar or larger extent of fusion as measured by [CONTACT_764365].
1.5 Analysis of Increased Risks to Treatment Subjects 
Pre-dinical testing and pi[INVESTIGATOR_764333]. However, until this is proven in a prospective, randomized clinical 
trial ll!tilizing a concurrent control group comprised of subjects undergoing ankle or hindfoot 
fusions, subjects receiving AMPLEX may experience increased risk of: 
1.Allergic reaction (local or systemic response)
2.Ectopic bone growth (bone forming outside of normal bone growth areas)
3.Abnormal cell growth (growth of tissue or cells beyond the norm )
4.Negative effects on pregnancy or fetus
5.Immune response (bodily response against foreign material)
6.Significant increase in liver enzyme measures
Table 1. Below describes these increased risks to treatment subjects and their mitigation. 
Additional descriptions of procedure and study related risks are provided in Appendix I, 
Anticipated Adverse Events.

efficacy. If these groups identify any new or unforeseen risks 
they will notify the Sponsor and render an opi[INVESTIGATOR_764334]/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
An extensive prechnical battery of in vitro and in vivo animal 
testing of AMPLEX and PREFIX did not identify an impact 
on tumor cell growth, tumor promotion, or metastatic 
behavior, thus minimizing the potential for such an event to 
occur with the treatment device. The study enrollment criteria 
include an exclusion for subjects with a prior history of active 
malignancy with the exclusion of basal cell carcinoma of the 
skin. 
Monitoring of study conduct and safety data will be 
conducted on an ongomg basis by [CONTACT_764366], governed by a Charter. If these 
groups identify any new or unforeseen risks they will notify 
the Sponsor and render an opi[INVESTIGATOR_764335]/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
The preclinical testing has projected that the B2A component 
of AMPLEX is completely eliminated within six weeks of 
implantation and during that time that circulating B2A levels 
are quite low. Therefore, the risk of an effect on a fetus is 
unlikely. 
However, to avoid this potential risk, female subjects are 
excluded from the trial if they are pregnant or lactating, or 
intend to become pregnant during the course of this study. 
Monitoring of study conduct and safety data will be conducted 
on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_764367], governed by a Charter. If these groups identify any 
new or unforeseen risks they will notify the Sponsor and render 
an opi[INVESTIGATOR_764336]/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
Pre-clinical and clinical immunogenicity testing during 
PREFIX and AMPLEX development have not demonstrated 
any immune reactions nor development of significant anti-B2A 
antibody formation.

Treatment and Follow-up: 18 months 
Study Closeout: 4 months 
Total Duration: 46 months 
3.2 Planned Number of Trial Sites and Subjects 
The study will be conducted at up to a total of 50 centers; 35-40 US centers and 10-15 Canadian 
centers, following approval by [CONTACT_764369] 
[Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Food and Drug Administration, [LOCATION_003] (FDA) or the local 
Research Ethics Board (REB) and Health Canada, respectively] with informed consent obtained 
from all subjects. 
Approximately 480 subjects will ibe randomized in a 2: 1 ratio (Treatment: Control) with 
approximately [ADDRESS_1047209] as 
the Clinical Events Committee (CEC). The CEC will be responsible for the review and 
adjudication of Investigator-reported events and events identified in the monitoring process. Any 
potential device, ancillary device or procedural related AEs, all events associated with secondary 
surgical intervention, and any other AEs specified in the CBC Charter will be adjudicated. 
Subsequent to Investigator determination of severity and relatedness of the event, the CEC shall 
classify each of these adverse events based on severity and association to the device and/ or 
procedure. During the review of the events, the CEC will be blinded to the clinical site and 
treatment. The CEC Charter will be developed upon identification of committee members and shall 
include consistent definitions for each type of event and shall outline the review process. 
3.3.2 Data Monitoring Committee 
An independent panel of medical and biostatistics experts will serve in the capacity of Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC). The DMC will periodically review clinical study data to ensure 
patient safety, trial integrity, and scientific rigor. DMC members will have relevant orthopedic 
experience and medical knowledge of the product under investigation. The DMC will develop and 
ratify a Charter that provides guidelines for oversight of trial safety. The Charter will define the 
scope and DMC's responsi bilities, quorum, operating guidelines, sample template for required data 
analyses, pre-defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], communication pathway to the study Sponsor, and frequency 
of meetings.

An independent imaging core laboratory will be utilized for assessment of radiographic images at 
each follow-up visit in which a radiographic image is obtained. A comprehensive description of the 
imaging methodology will be detailed in an imaging core lab Radiographic Evaluation Protocol 
(REP) provided in the Site Reference Manual (SRM). All radiographic imaging shall be performed 
in accordance with this protocol. 
Prior to development of the REP, the imaging core laboratory conducted a Radiographic Image 
Review and Validation Assessment to determine the impact of any potential confounding factor 
(i.e., metallic screws in the graft site, radio-opacity of the graft material) on the ability of readability 
of the images and utilized the information to develop the REP. 
The assessment of fusion status and device condition shall be performed by [CONTACT_764370]. Results of these assessments will not 
be adjudicated by [CONTACT_15741], 
3.4 Discussion of Overall Trial Design and Choice of Control Groups 
3.4.1 Trial Design 
This is a prospective, multi-center clinical trial in subjects (2:18 and <75 years of age) undergoing 
tibiotalar (ankle) arthrodesis or single, double, or triple hindfoot (talocalcaneal-, calcaneocuboid- or 
talonavicular-joint) arthrodesis with supplemental graft material and internal fixation with up to [ADDRESS_1047210]-discharge clinical visits will include visits at 2, 6, 12, 
24, 52 and 78 weeks. Adverse event data will be collected throughout the study. The primary 
endpoint will be assessed at 52 weeks. 
The objective of the trial is to demonstrate that AMPLEX is non-inferior to ABG for bone fusion in 
a population indica ted for ankle arthrodesis or single, double, or triple hindfoot arthrodesis surgery 
with supplemental graft material. The study will be declared successful if non-inferiority of 
AMP LEX compared to ABG in the primary efficacy endpoint is demonstrated in the mITT analysis 
population within a non-inferiority margin of -12.0% at a type I error rate of I-sided 5%.

E-Protocol Amendment-[ZIP_CODE]; Ver. 1.0
Supersedes: Ver. Protocol Amendment 1.[ADDRESS_1047211] site pain, functional 
improvement, absence of device related SAEs or procedure related SAEs and absence of secondary 
surgical or non-surgical interventions intended to promote fusion. This endpoint is considered to 
provide relevant assessment to determine the benefit/risk profile of the investigational device 
(AMPLEX) compared to the control material (ABG) used in arthrodesis surgery involving hindfoot 
or ankle. 
Functional improvement will be measured by [CONTACT_764371]-ADL. It is a reliable and valid self­
assessment instrument that was specifically developed to measure physical function for subjects 
with foot and ankle disorders (Martin, Irrgang, Burdett, Conti, & van Swearingen, 2005). The 
validity evidence for test content, internal structure, score stability, and responsiveness was 
demonstrated in 243 subjects including 51 (21 % ) subjects who underwent foot and ankle related 
surgery (Martin, Irrgang, Burdett, Conti, & van Swearingen, 2005). The reliability and 
responsiveness were further demonstrated in 311 subjects who underwent elective surgery for a 
foot or ankle related disorder (Hung, Baumhauer, Brodsky, & al., 2014). The minimal detectable 
change (MDC) and minimal clinically important difference (MCID) were identified as 5. 7 and 8 
points (Martin, Irrgang, Burdett, Conti, & van Swearingen, 2005). 
Both harvest site pain and pain on weight bearing at fusion site will be measu red by [CONTACT_941] 100 mm 
VAS. The 100mm VAS is a reliable self-assessment instrument commonly used in the assessment 
of pain. The VAS has been widely used in the clinical arena and research setting (Hawker, Mian, 
Kendzerska, & French, 2011) and is frequently employed in patients with musculoskeletal disorders 
(Tubach, et al., 2012). Minimal clinically important improvement in pain has been reported for 
knee and hip osteoarthritis at 19.9 mm and 15.3 mm respectively (Tubach, et al., 2005, p. 31). 
Additionally, improvement in baseline weight-bearing pain of >[ADDRESS_1047212] performance composite endpoint in other studies of ankle and hindfoot 
fusion. (FDA Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices Division, 2011 [May]) (Daniels, et al., 2015, 
pp. 743-746) (Baurnhauer J. et al, 2014, p. 107). 
CT imaging is logistically feasible, is a meaningful endpoint and has been used in past FDA 
studies. It reflects the proposed benefit of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the underlying clinical condition and has 
precedence for use. Its use is also independent of the assigned randomization and would therefore 
represent an objective measure of efficacy. Consistent interpretation in these complex anatomies is 
important in obtaining unbiased assessments, supporting the use of an independent imag ing core lab 
with expertise in this area for image interpretation. The blinding of radiographic reviewers from 
clinical information further adds to the validity of the assessments. Although there may be 
radiographic differences observed in the treatments, the blinding of the reviewers in this trial is 
consistent with the current draft guidance on imaging in clinical trials.44

treatment assignment. In addition, PK assessment will not be performed in a blinded manner. 
Blinding of the subjects is not possible due to the need for a surgical incision at a secondary site in 
the control group. Since subjects may not be blinded due to the presence of a second surgical site 
for the ABG Control treatment, subjects will be blinded until after the procedure to mitigate the 
impact of unblinded randomization and potential subsequent withdrawal of consent prior to 
treatment. In this process and following appropriate informed consent procedures, subjects will 
undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility before randomization. Eligible subjects will 
then be randomized! as close to the procedure as possible. 
3.4.4 Trial Population 
Subjects will be 2'.:18 and< 75 years of age and candidates for tibiotalar (ankle) arthrodesis or 
single, double, or triple hindfoot (talocalcaneal-, calcaneocuboid- or talonavicular-joint) arthrodesis 
with supplemental graft material. Subjects shall be screened prior to randomization to ensure they 
meet inclusion/exclusion criteria. The screening will include a review of all imaging and critical 
comorbid risk factors for nonunion by [CONTACT_737]. 
A Pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment will be conducted in a sub-set of subjects to assess the amount 
ofB2A in blood (plasma) after surgery, on Days 1, 2, 4, 7, and 15, and will include a baseline, pre­
procedure evaluation. The sub-set of subjects will include up to approximately [ADDRESS_1047214] 20 AMPLEX subjects. Both genders will 
be represented. Blood samples will be collected and processed to plasma for laboratory evaluation 
(plasma B2A concentration). 
3.4.[ADDRESS_1047215] will be discontinued from participation in the study if: 
•The Investigator feels that the subject can no longer fully comply with the requirements of
the study or if any of the study procedures would not be in the best interest of the subject.
•The subject is lost to follow up. A subject will be considered "lost to follow-up" and
terminated from the study when all of the following criteria have been met:
oFailure to complete the remainder of the scheduled study visits without due cause;
and
oDocumentation of three unsuccessful attempts to contact [CONTACT_764372].
•The subject wishes to withdraw their consent for participation in the study.

their designee of each potential subject. The coordinator win assign each consented subject a 
subject identification number in consecutive, ascending, and chronological order. This number will 
serve as a subject's identifier on all study-related documentation. 
All subjects screened for the trial will be recorded on a screening log, including subject age, sex, 
race and ethnicity. The reason of non-eligibility for all subjects who are deemed ineligible by [CONTACT_422205]. The screening log serves as a 
method for Ferring or their authorized designee to ensure that there is no selection bias in the trial. 
Screening logs will be periodically examined to evaluate reasons for non-enrollment of women or 
other key demographic groups. 
Once it is determined that the subject is eligible for the study, the site will inform the Perring 
representative or designee of the surgery date. The subject will be randomized according to the 
randomization schedule for each site as close to the time of surgery as possible, with the 
recommendation that the randomization be performed on the day of the surgical procedure. The 
subject randomization number will then be recorded on the relevant CRF. The randomization 
number will be assigned prior to surgery in a sequential, chronological order. Randomization 
numbers will not be reassigned. 
Evaluations performed at each study visit are summarized in Section 6: Trial Procedures. If a 
subject misses a visit, all reasonable efforts should be made to reschedule tlhe missed visit within 
the allocated visit window. If the visit cannot be rescheduled within the allocated visit window, the 
site should schedule a visit with the subject as soon as possible.

AMPLEX, the investigational device, is a synthetic bone graft substitute comprised of two parts; I) 
a synthetic bone void filler (BVF) that functions as an osteoconductive scaffold and 2) a synthetic 
peptide (B2A) that augments osteodifferentiation. 
The principal mode of action of the device is based on the osteoconductive granules that act as a 
scaffold for cellular ingrowth; B2A augments that action. The sterile ceramic granules, supplied by 
a third party vendor, are currently cleared for use as a BVF for bony voids or gaps of the skeletal 
system ( e.g., extremities, spi[INVESTIGATOR_203571]) that are not intrinsic to the stabili ty of the bony 
structure. These defects may be surgically- or traumatically-created osseous defects to the bone 
(K063527, MBCP+).21
AMPLEX is supplied in kit form (AMPLEX kit) and the components must be combined and 
utilized in accordance with the Instructions for Use (IFU). 
AMPLEX, B2A En hanced Ceramic Granules (AMPLEX), is the Investigational Device supplied in 
kit form and must be used as a system. When fully prepared according to the IFU, AMPLEX 
consists of osteoconductive granules (BVF) with bound synthetic B2A peptide. 
The AMPLEX kit contains two sterile, non-pyrogenic components that must be used as a system: 
•Part I: Bone void filler (BVF); 1 to 2 millimeter (mm) diameter granules, 5 cm3/vial, two
(2)vials per kit
•Part 2: Lyophilized B2A Peptide Powder, 2.8 mg/vial
Part I: BVF consists of two (2) vials of 5 cc, sterile, ceramic granules. The granules are composed 
of 20% HA and 80% P-TCP. 
Part 2: Lyophilized B2A Peptide Powder, is formul ated as a sterile product containing 2.8 mg B2A 
with mannitol and glycine as exciipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and is lyophilized in borosilicate glass vial. Each vial 
contains a white to off-white caked powder composed of highly purified B2A (acetate salt), 
mannitol (USP), and glycine (USP) under an atmosphere of nitrogen (nitrogen headspace gas). The 
vials are closed with a Daikyo VlO RB2-TR FluroTec® coated stopper and with an alum inum­
based, flip-top closure. Each vial contains sufficient B2A to prepare both vials of Part 1 ceramic 
granules.

All study (investigational) device accountability records will be maintained by [CONTACT_648738], stored in a secure location and reviewed during monitoring visits by [CONTACT_764377] (CRA)/monitor. If AMPLEX is prepared, but not implanted or used for 
whatever reason, it will be discarded per the Institution's policy and the circumstances recorded in 
the device accountability log/form(s). 
5.3.2 Non-lnvestigational Material (ABG) 
As ABG is being used as an active control reference in the clinical trial and is obtained during 
surgery, there is no packaging or labeling. 
5.4 Conditions for Storage and Use 
The Investigator will ensure that the investigational device will be stored in appropriate conditions 
in a secure location with controlled access. The storage compartment shall be monitored regularly 
and the temperature shall be documented. 
5.4.1 Investigational Device Storage 
The investigational device will only be dispensed to subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and 
are randomized to a treatment group in the trial. 
AMPLEX should be refrigerated (2-8 degrees Celsius / 36-46 degrees Farenheit) in a secure room 
(e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_764342]). A temperature log should be maintained to confirm temperatures have 
not been exceeded. If stored as instructed, AMPLEX is stable for up to 1 year. 
5.5 Treatment Compliance 
5.5.1 Dispensing and Accountability 
AMPLEX will only be dispensed to subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and are randomized to 
the treatment group in the trial. The Investigator ( or his/her designated personnel, e.g. trial nurse) 
will maintain a device accountability log/form(s) detailing the dates and quantities of the 
investigational devices dispensed to, and used by, each subject, as well as the batch numbers. The 
monitor will verify the device accountability during the trial. 
Access to investigational devices shall be controlled and the investigational devices shall be used 
only in the clinical investigation and according to the protocol. The Sponsor shall keep records to 
document the physical location of all investigational devices from shipment of investigational 
devices to the investigation sites until return or disposal. The principal Investi gator or an 
autho rized designee shall keep records documenting the receipt, use, return and disposal of the 
investigational devices, which shall include:

Graft material will be prepared during surgery using either autogenous bone or the AMPLEX 
material assigned through randomization. Graft materials are to be placed ONLY within the joint 
space. 
•AMP LEX, Jnvestigational Treatment. AMPLEX should be prepared following the IFU
accompanying the kit. If the subject is assigned to receive AMPLEX, the lyophilized B2A
powder will be reconstituted in sterile WFI and mixed with the granules at the time of
surgery as per the IFU. Once reconstituted and mixed with granules, implant-ready
AMPLEX must be used within four hours.
•Autogenous Bone Graft, Control Treatment. The harvested bone (calcaneus, proximal tibia,
distal tibia, iliac crest, etc.) will be cleaned of soft tissue and morselized. The volume of
ABG harvested for treatment should be measured using a syringe.

instructions will include prescriptions for pain management. Sites should provide standard-of-care 
prophylaxis for thromboembolic disease and this may include ASA up to 325 mg bid. With the 
exception of ASA up to 325 mg bid for either cardiovascular protection and/or DVT prophylaxis, 
subjects will be instructed to avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and 
corticosteroids for the first 6 weeks following surgery. Subjects will be advised that the use of 
NSAIDs or systemic steroid therapy (not including topi[INVESTIGATOR_110830]) may interfere with bone 
healing. This also applies to limited use of NSAIDs for headache, dysmenorrhea, etc. 
Electromagnetic, ultrasound or osteobiologic treatments stimulating bone growth are not allowed. 
Subjects will be instructed to remain non weight-bearing for six (6) weeks, then allowed to 
progressively increase weight-bearing. During the progressively increased weight-bearing 
timeframe, a removable cast/splint or boot is worn, which is subsequently weaned after full 
weight-bearing is achieved. It is recommended that all subjects are directed to participate in a post­
operative rehabilita tion program consistent with the guidelines provided in Table 2. Subjects will 
be advised against the use of tobacco products for at least six (6) months after surgery. Tobacco 
products will be defined as all tobacco products (cigarettes [including e-cigarettes], cigars, and 
chewiing tobacco) and will include gum or patches that contain nicotine. Subjects will be advised 
that njcotine may increase the chances of wound infection, pseudarthrosis (nonu nion) and other 
complications.

7.2 Assessments Related to Endpoints 
7.2.1 Radiographic Assessments 
The collection and assessment of radiographic information will follow a pre-defined imaging core 
laboratory protocol. The radiographic assessments (X-ray and CT) will be read by a central core 
imaging laboratory. The assessments will be made by [CONTACT_764380]-certified radio logists. 
The reviewers will be blinded to treatment arm and will not have access to clinical outcomes data 
when conducting the assessments. 
More specifically, radiographic assessments of osseous bridging will be performed by [CONTACT_764381] (the "primary reviewers") blinded to each other's assessments. 
A third independent reviewer (the "adjudicator") will resolve disagreements between the primary 
reviewers. Each reviewer will be a US-based, board-certified, licensed and practicing radiologist 
with subspecialty training in musculoskeletal radiology. 
[IP_ADDRESS] X-rays 
At the screening/pre-operative visit, A/P, lateral and oblique X-rays will be collected (historical X­
rays taken up to 24 weeks prior to the planned date of surgery will also be accepted). These pre­
operative X-rays are the baseline for subsequent safety evaluation. After surgery A/P, oblique and 
lateral X-rays will be collected at the following visits: Day of Procedure (e.g., after implant or 
within I week following surgery), and 12, 24, [ADDRESS_1047237]-surgery. The core imaging 
laboratory will provide qualitative (safety) assessments of screw loosening and radiolucencies 
around the screws, (new) fractures, subsidence, device migration, radiographic nonunion, osteolysis 
and/o r heterotopic ossification in the area surrounding the implant site. A radiographic nonunion is

defined on x-ray as radiographic evidence of nonunion (as defined in the REP) and the absence of 
radiographic progression of healing bone (as defined in the REP). The assessment will be 
conducted at Weeks 52 and 78. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Computerized Tomography (CT) and fusion success 
CTs will be collected at I 2, 24, and [ADDRESS_1047238] slices in sagittal or coronal reconstructions. A joint will 
be considered successfully fused if there is evidence of bridging bone over 2:50% of the joint. If a 
subject undergoes fusion at more than one site, each fusion site will be assessed independently. A 
subject will be considered fused if all fusion sites (full complement of joints) independently have 
evidence of bridging bone over at least 50% of the joint in the absence of secondary surgical or 
nonsurgical interventions intended to promote fusion. By [CONTACT_108], immediately after surgery 
there is 0% bridging bone in the target joint. The progression of fusion over time will be assessed in 
each subject by [CONTACT_764382].

The Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (F AAM) is a subject self-assessment questionnaire comprised 
of the separately scored 21-item Activities of Daily Living ADL (FAAM-ADL) and 8-item sports 
subscales.45 Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale anchored by 4 (no difficulty at all) and 0 
(unable to do), with higher scores representing a higher levels of function. 
In consideration of its target arthrodesis population, this study will utilize the FAAM-ADL sub­
scale as a measure of functional improvement in the composite endpoint. The FAAM-ADL 
questionnaire (included in Appendix 2) will be utilized at screening and at 12, [ADDRESS_1047240]-surgery. The questionnaire and its instructions for use will be provided in the SRM. Prior to 
administering the F AAM-ADL, subjects will be instructed on how to complete the questionnaire. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Weight-bearing Pain VAS 
Weight-bearing pain at fusion site will be assessed using a VAS. Subjects will mark the location on 
a JOO-millimeter line corresponding to the amount of pain they experienced with O mm being "no 
pain" and 100 mm being "the worst pain imaginable". The weight-bearing pain VAS will be 
completed at screening and at 12, [ADDRESS_1047241] procedure. The assessment and its 
instructions for use will be provided in the SRM.

applicable to ABG subjects only. Subjects in the ABG group will be asked to assess the pain 
associated with their graft site. ABG subjects will assess the pain using a VAS. Subjects will mark 
the location on a 100-millimeter I ine corresponding to the amount of pain they experienced with 0 
mm being "no pain" and 100 mm being "the worst pain imaginable". This questionnaire will be 
completed at 2, 6, 12, [ADDRESS_1047244] be

7.3.3 Clinical Laboratory Testing 
Routine clinical laboratory tests (hematology and chemistry, including AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, 
bilirubin and hemaglobin Al c levels), will be performed at screening (Visit I) and follow-up 
through [ADDRESS_1047245] urine pregnancy tests 
performed at the screening (Visit 1) and within 24 hours of the procedure (Visit 2). At the 
discretion of the Investigator, additional blood samples may be taken for safety reasons to analyze 
other clinical laboratory endpoints. All blood samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory.

will assess if it is clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS). Clinically 
significant laboratory abnormalities are defined as abnormal results requiring treatment or medical 
interv ·ention and should be recordled as adverse events. The severity of a clinically significant 
laboratory finding should be recorded as described; however, abnormal laboratory observations 
classified as NCS do not require an adverse event to be filed.

for blood, leukocytes or nitrite, microscopic urinalaysis will be performed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunological Testing for HBV, BCV and HIV 
Serological testing for HBV, HCV and HIV will be performed at screening (Visit 1). Negative 
results are required for study admission. 
7 .3.4 Antibody Monitoring 
The presence of anti-B2A antibodies will be evaluated using a tiered approach consistent with FDA 
guidance. This evaluation consists of screening and confirming for B2A-specific antibodies with 
use of a ligand bindling immunoassay. Following confirmation of the "positive" screening result an 
antibody titer will be determined. Subsequently, in confirmed ani-B2A antibody positive samples 
the BMP-2 cross-neutralization potential will be determined by a cell-based assay. Blood for 
immunogenicity testing will be collected at pre-operative/ screening visit, at 6 weeks and at 12 
weeks after surgery. For subjects testing positive for antibodies to B2A, additional blood samples 
will be obtained at each subsequent follow-up visit and analyzed until antibody titers return to 
baseline or until the end of the study. Samples will be analyzed at a GLP-compliant laboratory 
under the responsibility of the Department of Bioanalysis, IPC, Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S. 
7 .4 Human PK Assessment 
A Pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment will be conducted in a sll.lb-set of subjects to assess the amount 
of B2A in blood (pla sma). Blood for assessment will be collected pre-procedure (baseline) and after 
surgery on Days 1, 2, 4, 7, and 15. Visit [ADDRESS_1047246] of Days 2, 4 and 7, for which there will 
be an option for blood to be collected at home by a mobile laboratory unit. From the plasma 
concentration-time data of B2A, the following parameters will be estimated, if possible: AUC, 
AU Ct,% AUC extrap, Cmax, Tmax, tYi, lamda z, CL/F, Vz/F. The sub-set of subjects will include 
up to approximately [ADDRESS_1047247] 20 
AMPLEX subjects. Both genders will be represented. Subjects included in the PK sub-set will 
provide written informed consent prior to the fusion procedure.

An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical 
trial. It includes: 
•Any unfavorable and unintended sign, s.ymptom or disease temporally associated with the
use of the investigational device or control material, whether or not considered to be caused
by [CONTACT_764383]
•Adverse events commonly observed and adverse events anticipated based on the effect of
the investigational device or control material

appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or subject and may require
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is defined as any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, graft material (either 
AMPLEX or ABG in the context of this protocol), if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application 
(including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a medical device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
An anticipated adverse device effect is any adverse device experience, reported in this protocol, 
contained in a report of prior investigations, Informed Consent Form and, or general investigational 
plan.

implant configuration, with or without replacement of a component. A revision may also
include adjusting the position of the original configuration.
•Removal. A procedure where all of the original system configuration is removed with or
without replacement due to, for example, mechanical failure of the graft material, pain, or
infection.
•Reoperation. Any surgical procedure tbat does not include removal, modification, or
addition of any components to the system (e.g., drainage of a hemat:oma at the surgical site).
•Supplemental fixation. A procedure in which additional instrumentation not under study
in the protocol is implanted.

•Probably: R.easonable probability event might be caused by [CONTACT_764386]. The event has a
temporal relationship to the study procedure(s), and follows a known pattern ofresponse
and an alternative cause seems unlikely.
•Possibly: Reasonable possibility event is caused by [CONTACT_764386]. The event has a
temporal relationship to the study procedure(s) and follows a known pattern of response, but
a potential alternative cause may be present.
•Unlikely: Evidence that there may be other causes and the relationship to the graft material,
although cannot be completely ruled out, is remote.
•Unrelated: Cause of the event is known and the event is in no way related to any aspect of
the graft material.
•Unknown: Causality cannot be determined.
The causality of AEs will be determined by [CONTACT_737], and the CEC will adjudicate it. 
In addition to the graft material, the relationship to the following will also be determined for each 
AE, if possible: 
•Ancillary Device Adverse Event: An adverse event which is determined to be a
consequence of an ancillary device and is not specifically related to the use of graft material,
but could be related to the placement of the graft material. An ancillary device is defined as
an approved medical device used in conjunction with the graft material, and used during the
study procedure (e.g., internal fixation screws, etc.)
•Procedure-Related Adverse Event: An adverse event which is determined to be a
consequence of the arthrodesis or harvest procedure and is not specifically related to use of
the graft material or ancillary devices, but could be related to the placement of the graft
material or ancillary devices.
Every effort should be made to assess the causality of all events. If the causality cannot be 
determined, it should be classified as unknown. Events classified as "unknown" causality will be 
considered related for reporting purposes.

DetaiJs of the statistical methodology will be provided in a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP). 
9.1 Determination of Sample Size 
Assuming true success rates of the primary endpoint to be 60% for ABG and 62% for AMPLEX 
groups, 396 subjects are needed to maintain 85% power to demonstrate non-inferiority of 
AMPLEX to ABG with a non-inferiority margin of -12% at a type I error rate of I-sided 5% in a 
2: 1 randomization (264 for AMPLEX and 132 for ABG). To account for approximately 15% lost 
to follow-up, a total of 480 subjects (320 for AMPLEX and 160 for ABG) will be randomized. 
In this calculation, the true success rate for AMPLEX is assumed to be slightly higher than that for 
ABG because of the potential benefit for AMPLEX on the absence of significant graft harvest site 
pain component. The assumption on the true success rate for ABG is made based on the clinical 
endpoint results in DiGiovanni et al. (2013) and the Augment SSED (2015). These data indicate 
relatively high success rates for each component at Week 52, and the success rate as a composite 
endpoint is estimated as approximately 60% under the independence assumption among 
components. 
In the determination of the non-inferiority margin, retaining at least 80% of the assumed success 
rate in ABG is considered clinically meaningful, because it is inherently linked with substantial 
benefit of eliminating risks associated with ABG. Therefore, the non-inferiority margin is set to -
12%. 
In addition, the CT radiographic fusion success rate at 52 weeks for ABG is assumed to be 70% to 
75% based on 24 and 36 weeks data available in FDA Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices 
Division (2011). Assuming that the true CT radiographic fusion success rate for AMPLEX is the 
same as for ABG, the power to demonstrate the non-inferiority in the CT radiographic fusion 
success as an independent test with 396 subjects is 79% to 83% at 1-sided 5% significance level 
using the non-inferiority margin of -12%.

will be conducted without adjustment of multiplicity as long as all preceding tests are significant. 
All other secondary endpoints will be presented with the point estimate ofthe treatment group 
difference and the corresponding 2-sided 90% confidence interval. 
9.6.2 Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of subjects who meet all of the following 
criteriia for the SPC at 52 weeks: 
oImprovement in pain on weight-bearing at fusion site (2: 20 mm reduction from
baseline on 100 mm VAS)
oAbsence of significant graft harvest site pain ( < 20 mm on 100 mm VAS)
oImprovement in Foot and Ankle Ability Measure Activities of Daily Living subscale
(FAAM-ADL) (2: 8 points improvement from baseline)
oAbsence of device related or procedure related SAEs (up to Week 52)
oAbsence of secondary surgical or nonsurgical interventions intended to promote
fusion (up to Week 52)
Non-inferiority of AMPLEX to ABG will be claimed if the lower bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for 
the difference of the proportions (AMPLEX minus ABG) is greater than -12.0%. The superiority 
will be claimed if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI is greater than zero. The CI will be 
constructed with the normal approximation to the binomial. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the mITT analysis set. A sensitivity analysis will be 
conducted for the PP analysis set. In the analysis on the mITT analysis set, subjects who do not 
receive the assigned treatment will be analyzed as randomized. 
For the primary analysis, the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach will be used for 
subjects with missing SPC endpoint at [ADDRESS_1047257] will be considered not meeting the criteria.

9.8 Pharmacokinetic Assessment 
The PK analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_764395], Ferring 
Pharmaceuticals A/S. The PK parameters will be calculated by [CONTACT_105]-compartmental analysis (NCA) 
using the software WinNonlin®Phoenix v. 6.4 (Pharsight Corporation, US). Plasma concentration 
values below LLOQ and missing values (e.g. no blood sample collected or no value obtained at 
analysis) will be excluded from the NCA and the number of observations adjusted accordingly. No 
formal analysis of '°outliers" is planned. 
PK parameters will be estimated based on measurements Pre procedure (baseline) to the last day of 
assessment Day 15 after fusion procedure. From the plasma concentration-time data ofB2A, the 
following parameters will be estimated, if possible: AUC, AUCt, % AUC extrap, Cmax, Tmax, tYi, 
lamda z, CL/F, V z/F. 
Actual sampling time points relative to dosing will be used for the NCA and on the individual plots 
of plasma concentration versus time. Values below LLOQ will be represented as LLOQ/[ADDRESS_1047262] deviation, median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean, and coefficient of variation (CV 
[%]) on geometric mean (for AUC and Cmax). For tmax the geometric mean and the CV(%) will 
be omitted. 
9.9 Handling of Missing Data 
For the primary and key secondary analyses, the imputation method of LOCF will be used in 
subjects with an unknown outcome. 
Sensitivity analyses of missing data will be performed by [CONTACT_764396]:

the two arms will be considered, and the point at which significance is no longer achieved
will be identified.
The planned sensitivity analyses for the primary and key secondary endpoints will be described in 
further detail in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
All data collected on safety or adverse events will be reported to the extent it is availa ble, regardless 
of the active/withdrawn status of participants. 
9.10 Pooling of Site Data 
The primary analysis will be based on the pooled results. However, the homogeneity of study 
outcomes across study centers will be examined. The primary justification for pooling is that study 
centers will be following the same protocol, using the same device system, and following the same 
Instruc tions for Use/Surgical Manual. Additionally, frequent contact [CONTACT_764397] a reliable and reproducible manner. It is not anticipated that any individual study center 
will dominate the study results. Therefore, it is considered that these procedures will ensure that 
the data from these study centers can be combined and analyzed. 
To evaluate differences among centers in the study, a summary of important baseline variables, 
such as demographics, medical history and baseline clinical variables, will be presented by [CONTACT_384]. 
Additionally, variables related to procedures will also be summarized by [CONTACT_384]. 
Poolability across study centers will be tested for the primary endpoint. Details of the method will 
be specified in the SAP. 
It is also noted that the evaluation of center effect will consider OUS ( outside U.S.) versus U.S.­
based centers. Thus, another analysis of the center effect wiH consider the comparison between the 
results for these two geographical regions. 
Further explanation on poolability analyses will be described in the SAP.

Supersedes: Ver. Protocol Amendment 1.[ADDRESS_1047283] on the primary efficacy assessment , Device-relatedness will be 
determined by [CONTACT_764402]. However, the relatedness of a number 
of AEs and SAEs are known. This table is provided as a guidance in assessing the better-known 
complications of arthrodesis surgery. 
Adverse events associated with any surgical procedure could include: 
Likely: 
•pain (not reported as an AE if related to graft site or harvest site)
•swelling
•adverse reaction to anesthesia including nausea, confusion, vomiting and elevations in
liver enzymes
Less Likely: 
•soft tissue injury (swelling, warm to touch and/or pain to affected area)
•surgical site wound infection (drainage or pus at surgical site)
•cellulitis (inflammation of the soft tissue, especially below the skin characterized by
[CONTACT_411], swelling, redness and pain)
•failure of the tissue to heal properly ( wound breakdown or opening)
•other wound problem (fluid pocket formation)
•other infection (fever, aches and/or pain)
•hemorrhage (severe bleeding)
•nerve damage (weakness, tingling, and or numbness)
•muscular damage
•swelling, pain and/or redness at affected area
•arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm)
Rare but serious: 
•anesthesia complication (drug allergy, difficulty breathing, cardiac (heart) or systemic
effect that could be life threatening)
•heart attack
•stroke
•pulmonary (lung) complications
opneumonia, (lung inflammation caused by [CONTACT_80601])
oatelectasis (shortness of breath caused by [CONTACT_764403])
orespi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] (shortness of breath or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399])
opulmonary edema ( excess water in the lung)
•pulmonary embolus (clogging of lung blood vessels by a blood clot)
•need for blood transfusion (risk of disease transmission)

•bad reaction to blood transfusion (fever, itching, heart failure or systemic illness)
•septicemia (life-threatening infection in the blood)
•seizures/convulsions
•changes in mental status
•death
Adverse events associated with foot/ankle fusion surgery include: 
Liikely: 
•pain ( evaluated as an efficacy assessment, not reported as an AE)
•swelling
Less likely: 
•nerve injury (numbness sensation, tingling of affected area, decreased strength)
•adjacent joint degeneration ( degeneration of the joint(s) next to the fusion at a later time
requiring surgery)
•lack of pre-operative pain/symptoms reduction (signs and symptoms that were present
before surgery remain the same after surgery)
•failure to achieve desired or any foot/ankle fusion (incomplete fusion of the bone)
•heavy surgical or post-surgical bleeding
•deep vein thrombosis (swelling or pain in the legs from a blood clot)
•paraesthesia (sensation of pricking, tingling and/or creepi[INVESTIGATOR_764356])
•muscle and/or ligament injury
Rare but serious: 
•fracture (bone breaks) of the tibia (leg), or bones of the foot
•osteolysjs (resorption and/or dissolution of bone tissue)
Adverse events associated with foot/ankle instrumentation include: 
Liikely: 
•pain and discomfort associated with implanted instrumentation ( only of it can be
differen tiated from graft site pain)
Less Likely: 
•misplaced, wrong sizing, loosened, broken or migrated implants (screws)
•implant displacement or migration ( change of position)
•wear debris ( accumulation of fragments)
Rare but serious: 
•foreign body reaction to the implant (fever, swelling, and or discomfort)
•local or systemic allergic reaction (fever, aches and/or pain)
•damage to local structures

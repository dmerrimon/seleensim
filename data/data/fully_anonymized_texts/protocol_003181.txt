 I. Introduction  
1.1 Background and rationale  
Adequate maternal nutr ition is important for maternal health and wellness and is a major determinant 
of pregnancy outcomes  [1]. In low -and middle -income countries (LM ICs), maternal and child 
malnutrition  is a public health concern  resulting in increases of morbidity and mortality  [2]. Poor 
maternal nutrition is associated  with adverse pregnancy outcomes  such as low birth weight  (LBW) , 
preterm birth , large - and small -for-gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction, cesarean delivery 
and gestational diabetes mellitus  [1, 2] . In the long  term , maternal undernutrition is associated with  
chronic diseases (e.g., glucose intolerance, coronary heart disease, obesity, and increased risk of breast 
cancer) , less schooling and reduced economic productivity  in offspring  exposed to undernutrition during 
fetal life [1-3]. 
Routine antenatal care (ANC) offers opportunities to receive a broad range of health promotion and 
prevention services  including support for adequate nutritional care for pregnant women  and their 
newborns , and any required medica l treatment  [4]. However, it has been shown that in LM ICs half of 
women did not receive the four ANC visits  (recommended until 201 6) and the quality of ANC was 
suboptimal for those who met the recommendation [5, 6] . In 2016, World Health Org anization (WHO) 
updated it s guidelines on ANC with a high priority placed on nutrition interventions. The se new 
guidelines recommended increasing the number of ANC from four to at least eight contacts to improve 
women’s positive experience of care and to reduce  perinatal morbidity and mortality  [7]. Following 
these new recommendations, the government of Burkina Faso is working with WHO and other partners 
to revise the national guidelines on ANC and eventually te st elements of the essential core package of 
routine ANC needed by [CONTACT_817062].   
In Burkina Faso, d espi[INVESTIGATOR_817054] , the adjusted maternal mortality rat io (371 deaths per 
100,000 live births) [8] and the neonatal mortality rate (25 deaths per 1,000 live births ) remain high [9]. 
Anemia  and severe acute malnutrition are among the ten principal causes of death among  children 
under five years , in he alth facilities [10]. According to the findings from the 2017 Performance 
Monitoring and Accountability (PMA) [ADDRESS_1131375] two  years, 83% visited a qualified ANC  provider . Among those who sought prenatal 
care, 70% of women reported attending at least four visits [11]. However, i nformation on nutritional 
status shows that undernutrition is highly prevalent amo ng women and children. According to the 2010 
DHS, 16% of women of child -bearing age were undernourished (BMI <18.5kg/m2) , and 58% of pregnant 
women were anemic  [12]. There is still a high prevalence of LBW ( 14%) and  stunting among under five 
year s of age  (33%) [8]. All this suggests the need to reinforce  nutrition interventions  provided during 
pregnancy and enhance coverage and utilization of ANC services .  
Alive and Thrive ( A&T ) is an initiative that supports the scaling up of nutrition interventions to save lives, 
prevent illnesses, and contribute to healthy growth and develop ment through improved maternal 
nutrition, breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices in several countries . Since 2014, A&T has 
worked with the Burkina Faso Ministry of Health  (MOH)  to scale up breastfeeding nationally and is now 
working to support t he MOH  and various international and local partners to scale up interventions to 
address a full range of maternal, infant, and young child nutrition (MIYCN) practices.  
6 
 In Burkina Faso, A&T will develop and test the integration of an intensive package of maternal nutrition 
interventions into existing ANC services delivered through government health facilities that will align 
with the latest global evidence  [7]. These include  intensified counseling and support on dietary diversity 
and quality  during pregnancy, iron -folic acid (IFA) supplements  consumption , importance of ANC and 
increasing the number of visits,  adequate weight -gain monitoring, and early initiation of and exclusive  
breastfeeding . The International Food Policy Research Institute ( IFPRI) will carry out a research study to 
assess the feasibility of integrating th is package of maternal i nterventions into existing ANC services and 
to identify enabling factors and challenges.   The findings of this evaluation study  will provide the MOH 
and its partners with important information needed  to scal e up interventions to achiev e the new ANC 
recommend ations . 
1.[ADDRESS_1131376] of integrating locally relevant 
maternal nutrition interventions into existing ANC services on diet quality  and utilization of nutrition 
interventions during pregnancy . 
Research questions for the evaluation include:  
1) Is it feasible  to integrate locally relevant maternal nutrition interventions based on the WHO 
ANC guidelines into existing ANC services delivered through government h ealth facilities?  
2) Can the coverage and utilization  of key nutrition interventions  (nutrition counseling, weight 
gain monitoring, IFA supplement consump tion) be improved by [CONTACT_817063] -focused 
social and behavior change communication (SBCC; commun ity mobilization and interpersonal 
communication) and systems strengthening  approaches into existing ANC services?  
3) Can the quality of diets  (dietary diversity and adequate intake of micronutrients, protein, and 
energy) among pregnant women and early breast feeding practices (early initiation  of and 
exclusive breastfeeding) be improved by [CONTACT_817064] -focused SBCC interventions?  
4) What are the barriers and opportunities  for completing 8 ANC contacts?  
 
1.3 Trial design  
The present  study is design ed as a two-arm cluster -randomized , non-masked trial , consisting of two 
cross -sectional surveys  at baseline and endline . The unit of randomization is the health and social 
promotion center ( CSPS ) catchment area. The  study is designed to have sufficient power  to estimate 
differences between study group s across regions  (Figure  1). A baseline cluster/facility -level and 
household survey will take place  in November -December  2019.  As soon as the baseline survey is 
completed , the intervention will be implemented at the CSPS  and in the villages of the intervention 
group  for up to [ADDRESS_1131377] of the 
maternal nutrition interventions on currently pregnant and recently delivered women.

 II.  Methods: Participants, Interventions and Outcomes  
2.1 Study setting  
The study will be conducted in Boucle du Mouhoun and Haut s-Bassin s, two of the 13 regions of Burkina 
Faso  (Figure 2), often referred to as the country’s breadbasket . Their capi[INVESTIGATOR_817055] 273 km 
and 360 km respectively, from Ouagadougou  (the capi[INVESTIGATOR_817056] ). The regions were selected with 
the Government of Burkina Faso based on regional -level engagement and ownership , presence of 
community health worker s and functioning community -women’s groups known as Groupes  
d'Apprentissage et de Suivi des Pratiques  Optimales  d'Alimentation du Nourrisson et du Jeune Enfant  
(GASPA) , size of the region, ANC attendance and security concerns .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In Burkina Faso, t he health care system is organized in to three administrative levels: central, 
intermediate and peripheral [10]. Health facilities are also organized in three levels as follows: the first 
level known as health district includes medical centers with surgical services (CMA), health and social 
promotion center s (CSPS) and isolated maternity unit s; the second level w ith regional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (CHR) ; 
and the third level includes university/national hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (CHU). At the district level, CMA represents the 
referral center for health centers of the first level. In Boucle du Mouhoun, two out of six health districts 
and two o ut of eight in Hauts -Bassin  were selected as part of the study .  
ANC coverage with at least one ANC visit is very high  in Burkina Faso. About 9 7% of recently -pregnant 
women reported attending ANC at least once during their last pregnancy in 2017 [13]. The majority of 
women who received ANC also received it from a skilled provider, most ly from a midwife (71.3 % in 
Boucle du Mouhoun, 85.8 % in Hauts -Bassins) or nurse (19.1 % in Boucle du Mouhoun, 17.9 % in Hauts -
Bassins)  [13]. Most women attend ed ANC at least twice during their pregnancy, and roughly one -third of 
women in Boucle du Mouhoun and half of women in Hauts -Bassins are within their first trimester at the 
time of their first ANC visit. At national and regional level s, approximatively one-third of women 
attended at least four  ANC visits  (as recommended until 2016)  during pregnancy  [12]. 
IFA consumption is nearly universal in Burkina Faso [13]. Current WHO guidelines recommend daily IFA 
supplementation (30-60 mg elemental iron and 400 mcg folic acid) for women during pregnancy, 
 
 Figure 1: Study regions  
9 
 beginning as early as possible  to prevent maternal anemia, puerperal sepsis, low birth weight, preterm 
birth, maternal anemia and iron deficiency  [14]. Ideall y, pregnant women should receive IFA tablets no 
later than the first trimester, corresponding to 6 months (180 days) of supplementation. Ninety -seven 
percent of women in Boucle du Mouhoun and Hauts -Bassins reported taking  at least one IFA or iron 
tablet du ring their most recent pregnancy, with 70.6 % and 86.0 % of women taking at least 90 tablets, 
respectively  [13].  
According to the 2017  PMA2020 nutrition survey, c alcium supplementation is not common  [13]. WHO 
currently recommends daily calcium supplementation (1.5 -2.0 g oral elemental calcium) in populations 
with low dietary calcium intake to reduce the risk of pre -eclampsia. However, in Burkina Faso calcium 
supplementation during pregnancy  is not  yet recommended  until further evidence becomes available .  
Women’s d ietary diversity is poor . The mean dietary diversity score (out of 10 food groups) among 
recently -pregnant women is 3.9 in both regions , slightly higher than the national average of 3.4 [13]. 
Health providers  are nearly twice as likely to provide women information on the importance of diet 
quality (such as eating a variety of foods and high iron foods) during pregnancy than the importance of 
quantity (i.e. eating extra food) during ANC services  [13]. 
ANC services are provided in n early all health facilities , and ANC serv ices are offered, on average, 5 -6 
days per week [11]. Weighing, nutrition counseling, and IFA supplementation are routine ANC services. 
Weight gain monitoring during pregnancy i s important as body mass index and gestational weight gain 
are indicators of maternal nutrition  and are associated with pregnancy outcomes . Among women who 
attended ANC during their most recent pregnancy during the past two years, nearly all of them were 
weighed at least once. However, among them,  only  62% of women reported receiving  information 
about their weight gain. This proportion was 72.7% in Hauts -Bassin, higher than in Boucle du Mouhoun.  
[13]. Roughly half of all facilities support community health worker s to provide nutrition services.  
 
Breastfeeding is a common practice: in 2017, 97.4%  of Burkinabe women have ever breastfed  [13]. Early 
initiation breastfeeding (within one hour) was 60.2 % in Boucle du Mouhoun and 60.3 % in Hauts -
Bassins. About  91% and 74% of women  reported receiv ing information on breastfeeding immediate ly 
after birth  in Boucle du Mouhoun and Hauts -Bassins, respecti vely.  Among those who received 
information about breastfeeding their newborn, 59% reported breastfeeding within one hour of birth , 
and 55% of  women reported exclusively breastfeeding their baby .  
 
In the two health districts in  Boucle du Mouhoun  and two in  Hauts -Bassin  selected as potential 
intervention areas, a n exhaustive list of  all CSPS  was prepared  (total of 223 CSPS  in Boucle du Mouhoun 
and 182 CSPS in Hauts -Bassins ).  Areas with high security risk, physical inaccessiblity, and presence of 
similar intervention programs were excluded from the study.  The final list of 80 CSPS  catchment areas 
included in the study is  provided in Appendix 1 . 
2.2 Eligibility criteria

At the health center level, h ealth staff  particularly the nurse -midwife responsible for providing ANC, and 
community health workers  are eligible to  participate in one -to-one interviews after providing informed 
consent.  
2.3 Interventions  
The package of maternal nutrition interventions will include intensified counseling  on diet quality during 
pregnancy, distribution of and counseling on IFA supplement s for better adherence , counseling on early 
initiation of and exclusive breastfeeding, weigh t-gain monitoring , systems strengthening through

 2.4 Outcomes  
The primary outcome  indicator s of the study are focused on diet quality and IFA supplementation. These 
include:  
1) Maternal dietary diversity among pregnant women  
i. Mean number of food groups consumed by [CONTACT_37111]  
2) Use of iron -folic acid (IFA) supplements  among RDW  
i. Mean number of IFA tablets consumed during pregnancy  
The secondary outcomes relate to exposure to and utilization of key maternal nutrition , weight gain 
monitoring,  and early  breastfeeding interventi ons, as well as health worker knowledge and capacities at 
the points of service delivery . These include : 
3) Maternal diet quality: p roportion of pregnant women who achieve minimum dietary diversity ; 
and m icronutrient, protein and energy adequacy among pregnant women compared to the 
recommended dietary intake  
4) Proportion of women who received 90+ IFA supplements during pregnancy  
5) Early initiation of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding  practices  of children  
6) Use of ANC services (total number of ANC vis its/contacts  at facility and community level s and 
timing of the first ANC visit)  
7) Exposure to nutrition interventions  during ANC , including weight gain monitoring (proportion of 
women who are weighed and counselled about adequate weight gain, total number o f times 
women are weighed during pregnancy)   
8) Exposure to nutrition information from community health workers  (proportion of women who 
were visited at home during pregnancy, total number of times visited ), community groups, and 
other sources  
9) Health worker k nowledge on benefits and service provision for IFA supplementation, dietary  
diversity counselling, weight gain monitoring , and breastfeeding counsellin g 
10) Availability of service supports  (IFA supplies, records/registers, weight measurement equipment, 
counse ling materials, and training and supervision for health workers ) 
2.5 Sample size  
The two main samples for the primary outcomes are: 1) p regnant women (PW) as this sample allows the 
assessment of diet quality during pregnancy ; and 2) recently delivered women (RDW) who have children 
under [ADDRESS_1131379] opportunity to assess the primary outcome 
related to intervention exposure throughout pregnancy (i.e., IFA consumption) . Based on an initial mean 
dietary divers ity score of 3. 52 food groups across both regions and intra -cluster correlation of 0.110 
from the 2019 baseline  data (Kim et al., 2020)  , a significance level of 5%  and power of 80%, the sample 
size of [ADDRESS_1131380] a difference of 0.37 in the mean dietary diversity score 
after intervention .  
13 
 For RDW , using an initial mean of 108.64  IFA tablets consumed across both regions and intra -cluster 
correction of 0.206 at baseline  (Kim et al., 2020) and the same assumptions above for statisti cal 
significance,  the sample size of [ADDRESS_1131381] a difference of 15 tablets in the 
mean IFA tablets consumed after intervention . If husbands of RDW  are present at the time of the 
survey, they will also be interviewed briefly  about their health and nutrition knowledge  and any support 
provided during pregnancy . Approximately half of the expected sample size of husbands was available at 
baseline.    
Outside of these two main samples,  nurses -midwives  (1 per CSPS) and community hea lth workers  
(within 3 villages per CSPS) will be interviewed. In addition,  direct observations of ANC visits (2 per CSPS) 
to assess service quality, followed by [CONTACT_817068] s to assess client satisfaction, will be conducted 
among a  subgroup of pregnant w omen attending ANC  at the time of survey . 
The overall study samples sizes are presented in Table 2.

2.6 Recruitment  
In the catchment area of the pre-selected CSPS , a census will be conducted in three randomly selected 
villages represent ing the CSPS catchment area to identify PW and RDW . From two separate lists (for PW 
and RDW), women will be randomly selected by [CONTACT_653146]. At least 10 and 24 households per cluster need to be visited in the villages to identify PW 
and RDW , respectiv ely.  
At each CSPS, the n urse -midwife mainly responsible for providing ANC services will be invited participate 
in the study.  In each surveyed village, the co mmunity health worker (ASBC) mainly responsible for 
ANC/care for pregnant women or, in the case t hat more than one ASBC is responsible, with the longest 
duration in that position  will be invited to participate in the study.  In addition, at each CSPS, two  ANC 
sessions that take place during the time of the survey will be observed , with prior permissio n and 
consent for observation and post -observation exit interview .

 III. Methods: Assignment of interventions   
3.[ADDRESS_1131382] , we divided clusters/CSPS by [CONTACT_817069]. Then we stratified 
clusters into 2  strata using available data on a set of criteria :  
• Type of catchment area  
• Number of villages covered  
• Total population size  
• Total number of pregnant women and total number of children <6 months  
• Number of ANC admissions and p roportion of ANC attended

4.1.7 Multi -pass 24h -recall  
Dietary intake data of pregnant women will be collected in women’s homes using multi -pass 24 -hour 
recall interviews (Gibson and Ferguson 2008), which have been validated in many low -income countries 
(Gibson et al. 2017). Standardized quality -control proced ures will be implemented to mitigate potential 
underreporting of energy and nutrient intake and other reporting errors (Alemayehu et al. 2011).  
The multi -pass 24 -hour recall approach uses a special method to help individuals remember what they 
consumed. E numerators will review the pregnant woman’s food and drink taken over the past 24 -hours 
several times. Each time, or “pass”, more detailed information is collected, thus reducing the probability 
that foods and drinks are omitted. To help estimate portion s izes, respondents will be visited prior to the 
24-hour recall and provided with standardized dishes (e.g. cups, bowls and spoons) to use for consuming 
and preparing food the following day (the anticipated day of recall). Descriptions of each pass are 
prese nted in Table 10. 
Table 10: Description of the four passes for the multi -pass [ADDRESS_1131395] operating procedure (SOP) on improved 
hygiene that enumerator  staff  will be trained on du ring survey training and must sign as part of a 
contract amendment. As part of the SOP, all enumerators and  study participants will wear masks 
(provided to them) and wash or sanitize their hands before and after each interview. Enumerators will 
maintain tw o meters of distance between themselves and respondents during the interview. When 
[ADDRESS_1131396] three 
symptoms, they will be considere d high risk and additional precautions will be observed.  
Testing enumerators for COVID -19 before starting data collection is unlikely given the scant resources 
available for testing in Burkina Faso.  However, all survey staff will be assessed for COVID -19-related 
symptoms (including fever , dry cough, extreme fatigue , body aches, sore throat, etc. ) each day before 
enumerator training begins, and f ield supervisors will assess enumerators each day before starting data 
collection.  In addition, C o- and Principal Investigators of the project  will be in daily contact [CONTACT_817071]é and in -country partners during data collection to assess the changing risks and government 
measures.  
4.3 Data management  
A secure data file structure will be established in an IFPRI -server -based Dropbox Professional folder for 
use by [CONTACT_653148]. Original, sensitive (non -anonymized) data 
files and documents will be stored in a folder with access restricted to senior IFPRI researchers. A do  file 
will be written to anonymize survey data files and export the anonymized data to a shared Dropbox 
folder for data cleaning and analysis by [CONTACT_817072].  
All changes to the raw data output files from the Comput er-Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI) software 
will be recorded. Formatting, reshapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and labeling of data will be documented using detailed and 
well-annotated do files.  
4.4 Statistical methods  
Descriptive analyses will be used to describe characteristi cs of the two groups.  Testing of differences 
between the two groups will be done using a random effects regression, accounting for the clustering of 
errors within and across health center catchment areas.  
The randomized study design allows for the identif ication of causal effects of the maternal nutrition 
intervention through comparisons of mean outcomes between the treatment and control groups.  Key 
indicators will include dietary diversity (among pregnant women), IFA consumption, weight gain 
monitoring, a nd breastfeeding practices (early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding). Impacts will be 
assessed using difference -in-difference (DID) estimation. Data management, data cleaning and statistical 
analyses will be conducted using Stata version 15 (Statacorp , [LOCATION_003]).  
 
V. Methods: Monitoring  
5.[ADDRESS_1131397]  (IRB) based in Washington, DC. In  Burkina Faso , ethical clearance will be 
obtained  from  a local IRB,  Centre Muraz in Bobo -Dioulasso . 
A COVID -19 country risk assessment system was developed by [CONTACT_653149]’s IRB 
assess COVID -19 risk in countries where fieldwork is planned. In function of the level of COVID -19 risk 
identified in country, data collection methods will  be adapted to minimize the transmission risk of 
COVID -19. Justification for resuming fieldwork with in -person contacts will be provided and accepted  by 
[CONTACT_1201].   
6.2 Protocol amendments  
All amendments to the protocol will be reported (by [CONTACT_653150] -Investig ators) to and agreed upon with 
Alive & Thrive. Any modifications to the protocol which may impact the safety of participants or the 
scientific validity  including changes of study objectives, study design, participants, sample sizes, and 
study procedures will be reviewed by [CONTACT_817073] .  
Version control using protocol version identifiers and dates will be used to track the history of 
amendments and identify the most recent protocol version.  
6.3 Consent  
After explaining the study’s objecti ves and procedures, enumerators will seek and obtain written 
informed consent from eligible study participants. Participation in the study is completely voluntary. 
Participants are free to withdraw at any time by [CONTACT_817074] . 
All COVID -19 transmission risks to study participants (including close contact [CONTACT_817075]) and the precautionary measures that will be followed during data 
collection to limit the risk of transmission will be included in the informed consent.   
24 
 6.4 Risks and benefits  
Close-range contacts between enumerators and household members present a particular risk for 
transmission of  COVID -19 in communities with vulnerable populations.  Precautionary measures to 
mitigate th is risk are outlined  in section 4.2 . 
For their time spent being interviewed, survey respondents will receive a monetary compensation. 
Pregnant women, recently delivered women, husbands of recently delivered women, nurse -midwives, 
ASBCs, and the heads of CSPS (who assist with the health facility observation checklist) will receive 1,[ADDRESS_1131398] access to depersonalized data —located in a separate IFPRI -server -based Dropbox Professional 
folder —where direct identifiers have been replaced by [CONTACT_817076].  
Data that is made publicly available will be carefully screened to remove any indirect and geographic 
identifiers which may breach the confidentiality of respondents.  
6.[ADDRESS_1131399] access to data that has had all personally identifiable information removed.  
In compliance with donor (Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) open access policy requirements, fully 
anonymized datasets will be made publicly available one year after the end of the project. Metadata and 
other  documentation of data collection procedures (such as the codebook, data collection instruments 
and interviewer guides/protocols) will also be made publicly available.  
6.[ADDRESS_1131400]. The A&T 
Burkina Faso team will be working in close partnership with government entities on strengthening 
maternal health systems at the national and regional levels throughout the duration of the project. 
Findings will be disseminated through in -country events, presentations, and conferences.  
Within the research community, we aim to have the research peer -reviewed and published in high 
quality journals. Preliminary r esearch findings may be presented at international conferences and 
internal IFPRI seminars.

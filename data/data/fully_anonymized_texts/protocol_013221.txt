PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 3 
Original Protocol Date:  11 January 2017  
Amendment 1 Date:  07 February 2017  
Amendment 2 Date:  12 June  2017  
Administrative 
Amendment 1 Date:  13 July 2017  
Amendment 3 Date:  20 September 2017  
Rationale  Herein is a summary of the major changes made to the protocol 
dated 13 July 2017  and reflected in Amendment 2 dated 12 June 
2017:  
•The donor inclusion and exclusion criteria have been
simplified.  Our goal was to ensure that the donor was high
quality. This is best done by [CONTACT_794985] (the kidney donor profile index) at 0.65.  We have
removed other criteria as t hey are actually captured in the
KDPI (which takes into account age, donation after cardiac
death, race, comorbidities, terminal creatinine).
•We now allow recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794958] -dialysis as long as  their
GFR is low enough at the screening visit
(<15mL/min/1.73m2) to suggest that dialysis is imminent
without a transplant.
•We have extended the amount of accrued wait -time to [ADDRESS_1096625] if they are blood type B or O
(between 5 -6years).  This is because these blood types have
substantially longer wait times than blood type A (between
3-5 years)

Version 4.1 Dated: 20 September 2017, inclusive of administrative amendment 1  •We have modified the patient education session in response
to feedback from our Nephrology Patient Advisory
Committee to make the session  more patient -friendly
•We have increased the total number of subjects that can be
screened for this study from [ADDRESS_1096626]
found that so far many of the patients who are screened end
up being ineligible for transplant after they undergo
“trans plant readiness evaluation” by [CONTACT_794986]. This is typi[INVESTIGATOR_794959]. Thus we expect to need to screen 40 patients to
find 11 that are able to under go transplant
•We now clarify that the “second visit” in the screening
period is either a phone or in -person visit per patient
request.  This allows the investigators an opportunity to
answer all questions and confirm patient eligibility, but
allows for fle xibility in regards to where this visit takes
place, it can be done by [CONTACT_794987]. This has been clarified in the informed consent
I. Background and Significance
Currently in the [LOCATION_002], there are 133,[ADDRESS_1096627], with only 13,299 
donors in total for that year.  Thus, there is a definite shortage of transplant viable organs in the 
U.S. In a survey  of kidney donations between 1995 and 2009, of the 93,825 HCV -positive 
deceased donors (potentially 187,650 kidneys), over 50% were discarded. In Region 1, which 
encompasses the New England states and 4,[ADDRESS_1096628] ra te 
of HCV -positive kidneys is 36% (data per New England Organ Bank). Furthermore, for the past 
decade, total kidney donors per year in the U.S. have reached a plateau of approximately 13,[ADDRESS_1096629] -transplant

 outcomes. Therefore, it is of paramount importance and  in accordance with the OPTN Final Rule 
that available resources are used efficiently;8 namely, that all potentially transplantable organs are 
recognized for their enormous value as scarce resources and should be utilized to their maximum 
potential for the  maximum benefit (the principle of Utility).9  
Transplantation of HCV -positive donor kidneys to HCV -positive  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794960] -term safety; some argue that it is an 
underutilized option.  O ne major advantage is a decrease in wait time and the potential to decrease 
waitlist mortality. However, a major concern with donor HCV -positive to HCV -positive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794961] d rate of post -
transplant diabetes. However, it is important to note that the above risks associated with 
transplantation of HCV -positive kidneys were all determined prior to the current era of HCV 
treatment.   
In contrast, traditional anti -HCV therapy depe nded on Interferon as the linchpin of single or 
combination therapy. Not only has Interferon been generally poorly tolerated, the risk of serious 
systemic side -effects has limited its use. When used in combination with transplant 
immunosuppression, acute H CV flare -ups have been reported including acute fulminant 
hepatitis.16 In addition, Interferon can elicit induction of class II antigen expression on renal 
tubules, which theoretically can lead to acute kidney rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (AR). Induction of AR and 
the requirement for a further increase in net immunosuppression to treat AR can cause an increase 
in viral replication, setting off a vicious cycle. This concern about AR has been one of the most 
formidable arguments against Interferon use in the immediate post-transplant setting. Finally, 
previous treatments with Interferon -based HCV regimens have been prone to complications, as 
enumerated above, even after a [ADDRESS_1096630] produced underwhelming cure rates of 
approximately 50% (genotype 1).[ADDRESS_1096631] -acting an tiviral (DAA) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_794962].  DAAs have dramatically improved treatment options for patients with 
HCV. A recent study of kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794963] [ADDRESS_1096632] -transplant were cured and treatment was well tolerated in all cases except 
for one.18 Modern DAAs offer exceedingly high cure rates (upwards of 95% for genotype 1), with 
minimal side -effects as compared to previous forms of treatment, especia lly those that were 
Interferon -based.19 
Grazoprevir, an inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A protease and elbasvir, a NS5A inhibitor, in 
combination have been shown to be highly effective and well tolerated in patients with advanced

Version 4.1 Dated: [ADDRESS_1096633] extensively studied in renal failure, with 99% SVR12 (sustained virological 
response at 12 weeks), but also because of its minimal side ef fect profile, with only 2% of patients 
discontinuing the regimen due to adverse effects. This regimen is able to powerfully suppress viral 
load – with no on -treatment virologic breakthrough at [ADDRESS_1096634] transplant is determined based on data from 
the phase III C -EDGE trial, which assessed the efficacy and safety of elbasvir/grazoprevir fo r 12 
weeks in treatment -naïve adults (genotypes 1, 4, and 6). The sustained virologic response rate (cure 
rate) at 12 weeks (SVR12) was 92% in genotype 1A, 99% in genotype 1b (129/131) patients 
receiving 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir. When genotype 1A w as evaluated more closely, it 
became clear that patients who had baseline high level resistance associated variant (RAVs) had 
lower rates of cure, this was overcome by [CONTACT_537143] -based ribavirin (1000 mg [<75 kg] to 
1200 mg [≥ 75 kg]) and extending the treatment course to 16 weeks. NS5A RAVs were identified 
at baseline in 12% (19/154) of genotype 1a -infected patients enrolled in the C -EDGE study of 
which 58% (11/19) achieved SVR12 compared to an SVR12 rate of 99% (133/135) in patients 
without these RAVs receiving 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir. It is now recommended that 
patients with high -level baseline RAVs prolong duration of treatment to 16 weeks and add 
ribavirin; this is based on extrapolation of data from the C -EDGE TE trial. In this phase III op en-
label trial of elbasvir/grazoprevir that enrolled treatment -experienced patients, among 58 genotype 
1a patients who received 16 weeks of therapy with elbasvir/grazoprevir plus ribavirin, there were 
no virologic failures. Subsequent analysis of the elbas vir/grazoprevir phase II and III trials have 
demonstrated SVR12 rates of 100% (6 of 6 patients) in genotype 1 patients with pre -treatments 
NS5A RAVs treated with elbasvir/grazoprevir for 16/18 weeks plus ribavirin. Because of this we 
will perform NS5A resi stance testing for any donor with genotype 1a infection to determine 
treatment duration and need for addition of ribavirin to treat the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. If baseline RAVs are 
present, i.e., polymorphisms at amino acid positions 28, 30, 31, or 93, treatment will b e extended 
16 weeks with the addition of weight -based ribavirin to decrease the likelihood of transmission.  
In light of these recent advances in HCV therapy, we believe that elbasvir/ grazoprevir have the 
potential to play an important role in curtailing t he cur rent high discard rates for HCV -positive  
kidneys, an antiquated and wasteful practice, and one antithetical to the Final Rule.  We 
hypothesize that elbasvir/grazoprevir therapy could prevent or eliminate HCV infection that could 
occur after transplan tation of a HCV -positive kidney into a HCV naïve host.  
If this approach proves successful, it has the potential to result not only in a large increase in the 
number  of organs available in the kidney donor pool but also an overall increase in the quality  of 
organ offers. The reason for this is that, unfortunately, many potential donors who are HCV

II. Specific Aims  
Primary Objective  
• Determine if the administration of grazoprevir and elbasvir (with or without ribavirin) for 
12-16 weeks after kidney transplantation prevents the spread of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infection from a donor kidney with known Hepa titis C genotype [ADDRESS_1096637]

Secondary Objectives  
• Evaluate the safety and tolerability of grazoprevir and elbasvir (with or without ribavirin) 
in patients undergoing kidney transplantation  
• Determine the proportion of subjects with undetectable serum HCV RNA at study day 7, 
14, 28, 56, 84, 112, 168, 252, and 365 in kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794964] (with or without rib avirin) in combination with a kidney transplant from an 
HCV infected donor.

information about HCV, current treatments, current role in kidney tran splantation, and have the 
opportunity to ask questions. After the session patients will be given the informed consent 
information to review at home.  If interested they will return for a screening visit (Visit 1).  
A study physician investigator will obtain  informed consent. The consent form and protocol will 
be reviewed with the potential subject and any questions will be answered. The subject may be 
seen in a private area located on Renal Associates Clinic, [ADDRESS_1096650] an informa tion session and screening visit conducted by a different physician

Version 4.1 Dated: 20 September 2017, inclusive of administrative amendment 1  
  
Plan For Intensive Monitoring  
Three situations will prompt beginning an intensive monitoring study visit schedule.  
1. Medical need to begin a medication with known interaction with Zepatier ™ 
2. Need to begin a transplant medication that has not been studied in co mbination with 
Zepatier ™ 
3. Any patient experiencing a study drug related side -effect  
If, for example, an azole is needed, tacro levels will be monitored twice weekly until stability is 
established, as is clinically indicated whenever an azole is added to a t acrolimus level. Co -
administration with mTOR inhibitors has not been studied to our knowledge. We would adhere to 
the best standard -of-care currently practiced, which entails frequent monitoring of drug levels on 
this or any class of immunosuppressant, in addition to monitoring eGFR. Any patient with 
unforeseen need for a medication with a known interaction with elbasvir/grazoprevir (including 
azoles) would be subjected to a change in study visit schedule and would come weekly for the 
duration  of Zepatier ™ treatment .   
 
Plan For Management of Patient Requesting Early Termination From the Study  
If a subject  decide s to stop taking part in the study  after the treatment period for any reason, we 
will ask them  to make a final study visit, called t he Early Termin ation Visit.  They  will need to 
return all unused study drug at this visit.  The final study visit will take about 30 minutes.  At this 
visit, we will:  
• Give  a physical exam and check on any new sympto ms or new medications since their  last 
visit 
• Measure their weight  
• Record their  vital signs  
• Draw some blood samples to measure if there is any Hep C virus  in their  blood, and the 
amount of  anti-rejection medicine in their  body, and for routine lab tests  
If the patient decides to stop taking part in the study during Zepatier ™ treatment, we have the 
following plan in place:  
Although we would attempt to avoid this by [CONTACT_794992], including an information session, detailing the immediate and downstream risks 
inherent  in potential HCV transmission if medication is stopped, should a patient request 
study drug termination:  We would immediately convene an intervention group that included 
the following to make sure that all attempts are made to address any potential issue s that are 
leading to patients wanting to drop out of the study.  
1. A study MD investigator  
Protocol: 2016P002051  
Compound: Elbasvir -grazoprevir                                                                                                             Final  
Raymond Chung, MD                                                                               Amendment 3: 20 September  2017  
 
Version 4.1 Dated: 20 September 2017, inclusive of administrative amendment 1  
 2. A Non -study related treating MD (ie the patients primary MD or Nephrologist)  
3. The patients family member or close personal friend  
4. A patients advocate/social worker  
Finally, if the worst -case scenario was to play out and they were to get HCV, we now know that 
HCV is a treatable disease, no longer a death sentence. If transmission occurred, we would re -
group and determine a successful therapeutic strategy to eradicate HCV.  Although complications 
of HCV take decades to develop, we would help the patient become quickly connected to 
appropriate HCV care providers.  
In the event of a possible HCV Seroconversion. We will pair sofosbuvir and ribavirin with 
elbasvir and grazoprevir  for a repeat course. With established HCV infection, we would apply to 
the insurer for coverage of course of antiviral therapy.   
Sofosbuvir use has not been well studied with eGFR < 30. At this point the patient would be > 
[ADDRESS_1096671] persistent severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30). Chances 
of eGFR < 30 at 12 weeks given the excellent kidney quality being selected for this study (see 
inclu sion criteria) is < 10% at 3mo mark. Additionally, there are other regimens that are not 
renally excreted that could be used  for this population soon available on the market (by 2017) 
that could be applied for through their insurance.    
Plan for Patients That Develop a HCV Infection  
The primary investigator, [CONTACT_697178], will advocate on behalf of the subject using his expertise to 
advise the appropriate salvage therapy. Every effort will be made with the insurer first and then 
the drug companies to secure e ffective treatment in this situation.  
Plan for Waitlisted Patients After Study Completion  
If the enrollment for this study closes (i.e. [ADDRESS_1096672] been participated and received a 
transplant), then patients will be notified that this protocol is over  by [CONTACT_25600].  We expect that 
with positive results from this study and others that there would be new larger studies of this 
technique (treating post transplant) with this and other anti -HCV regimens.  
 
 
VI. Biostatistical Analysis  
Variables/Time Points of Interest  
The primary variable of interest will be HCV RNA at the multiple time -points assessed during and 
after treatment.  
Protocol: 2016P002051  
Compound: Elbasvir -grazoprevir                                                                                                             Final  
Raymond Chung, MD                                                                               Amendment 3: 20 September  2017  
 
Version 4.1 Dated: 20 September 2017, inclusive of administrative amendment 1  
  
The primary efficacy outcome “Prevention of HCV Transmission” will be determined by a 
negative HCV RNA  
 
The safety outcomes includ e summation of treatment related adverse events and transplant 
rejection or patient mortality. On treatment eGFR, proteinuria, hemoglobin, and liver function tests 
will be summarized to assess safety.  
 
Statistical Methods  
The first case will be described a s a case report.  Should HCV transmission be prevented with this 
protocol then a cohort of 10 patients will be recruited.  
 
Patient characteristics for the follow -up cohort (N=10) will be presented with summary statistics 
for baseline demographics, clinical  variables.  The SVR12 rate will be presented and 95% CI 
constructed with the exact test.  Mean and standard deviation for on -treatment laboratory values 
will be presented to analyze safety.  
 
Power/Sample Size:  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  The first patient wil l be enrolled and complete the protocol as a proof of 
concept. Provided transmission does not occur, N=10 more patients will be enrolled in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480].  
 
VII. Risks and Discomforts  
Psychological risk  
 
Participation in research may result in undesired chan ges in thought process or emotion (epi[INVESTIGATOR_794976], stress, guilt). Patients may experience discomfort when being asked questions about 
their medical history that they deem to be private.  
 
Risks related to transplantation with a HCV  kidney  
 
Liver problems  
 
It is possible that Zepatier ™, which cured > 95% with HCV , will not work as well after a kidney 
transplant as it has worked in patients who did  not have a transplant. It is also possible that after 
kidney transplant, a HCV infection could cause  serious health problems, including liver failure or 
death. HCV  can cause a rare but severe liver inflammation in the first few  weeks to months after  
transplant. In the short term, infection with HCV  can cause a flu -like illness that includes fatigue, 
nausea , fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, joint pain, and yellowing of the skin (jaundice). Although 
Protocol: 2016P002051  
Compound: Elbasvir -grazoprevir                                                                                                             Final  
Raymond Chung, MD                                                                               Amendment 3: 20 September  2017  
 
Version 4.1 Dated: 20 September 2017, inclusive of administrative amendment 1  
 it is very rare, infection with HCV  can cause severe inflammation of the liver or even liver failure, 
including a condition called fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis . The risk of this complication in patients 
without HCV  who receive a transplant from a donor with HCV  is unknown. This complication can 
be treated and cured in some cases with the HCV  medications that the study  will be providing . 
 
Cirrhosis of the liver can cause someone to experience leg swelling, yellow skin, skin itching, 
abdominal bleeding, shortness of breath, and the abdomen to fill with fluid (ascites). Liver failure 
can also cause death. Based on the limited data available, it would be extremely rare for someone in 
the study to experience liver failure in the first few months after transplantation because the study  
will be giving HCV  treatment right away. However, because l iver failure is possible, the study is  
only enrolling individuals in this study who would potentially be eligible to receive a liver transplant 
if they developed liver failure after a kidney transplant, which is why the screening process for this 
study requires that you have good heart functio n on the echocardiogram you underwent as a part of 
your transplant workup.  
 
If the patient  develop s HCV  infection despi[INVESTIGATOR_794977] ™, and it cannot be cured with the 2nd 
line treatment gi ven through this trial, over time, there may be continued i nflammation and scarring 
of the  liver that over many years (10 -30) can lead to cirrhosis. If HCV causes cirrhosis, the patient 
is at increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_794978], liver failure requiring a liver transplant, or death.  
 
Additional risks of HCV :  
HCV  can cause oth er types of inflammation in the  body, such as arthritis, rash, anemia, nerve pain 
and inflammation damage to your kidney transplant. These problems are rare, and affect < 2% of 
people who have HCV . These problems should respond to effectiv e treatment for the HCV . 
 
Risks of the test used to determine the HCV  virus genotype  
The study  intend s only to transplant organs from patients with HCV  – genotype 1 or 4 . There is less 
than a 1% chance that the test the study  uses to identify the virus mig ht not be accurate. If the tes t 
gives the wrong result and the patient receives  a kidney that has a different genotype of virus in it, 
the patient will still be treated , but the chances of cure  may be lower.  
 
Risks Related to Study Medications  
 
Risks of Zepatier ™ 
Elbasvir/grazoprevir is an FDA approved regimen for treating HCV  infection and thousands of 
patients have received this medication. Based on the type of HCV  the donor was infected with, 
some patients will also need to take ribavirin.  Ribavirin i s also approved by [CONTACT_794993].  
 
In patients receiving elbasvir/grazoprevir for [ADDRESS_1096673] common side effects were fatigue, 
headache and nausea (occurring in approximately 1 in 10 patients). Only [ADDRESS_1096674].  
 
Protocol: 2016P002051  
Compound: Elbasvir -grazoprevir                                                                                                             Final  
Raymond Chung, MD                                                                               Amendment 3: 20 September  2017  
 
Version 4.1 Dated: 20 September 2017, inclusive of administrative amendment 1  
 In patients treated with elbasvir/grazoprevir plus ribavirin for [ADDRESS_1096675] was anemia (8 in 100) and headache (6 in 100). Three in 100 patients had to stop treatment 
due to side effects.  
 
The safety and tolerability of Zepatier ™ after kidney transplantation have also not been studied. It 
is possible that taking immunosuppressant medications needed after kidney transplant may change 
the effectiveness or side effects of  Zepatier ™.  
 
This drug regimen was chosen as first -line therapy for this study rather than other approved agents 
because this investigational agent is unique in that it can be safely used in patients with abnormal 
kidney function. The  cure rates for patie nts with known HCV  and chronic kidney disease (including 
being on dialysis) are similar to rates of patients without kidney disease. As a resul t, if kidney 
function has not fully recovered when treatment is initiated after transplant, the investigational 
agents can be safely given to you eve n if it takes some time for the  kidney transplant to start 
working properly.  
 
Risks of Ribavirin (Applies only to the minority with genotype 1a and positive resistance testing)  
 
Ribavirin has been marketed for the treatment of HCV infection administered in combination with 
other HCV drugs (ribavirin is not effective against HCV infection when given by [CONTACT_5071]). Side 
effects which may be experienced with RBV include: Nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, 
dyspepsia, ab dominal pain, insomnia and rash. Hemolytic anemia  can occur. The breakdown of 
red cells may lead to increased levels of bilirubin, and uric acid. The hemolytic anemia may cause 
worsening of heart disease which may lead to heart attacks and, sometimes, deat h.  
 
A small percentage of patients may need ribavirin ( expected to be 6.7% of all study participants, 
since 67% expected to be genotype 1A and 33% expected to be genotype 1B  and only 10% of 
genotype 1A recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794979] ). In this small percentage,  there is 
a risk of worsening anemia, particularly those with delayed graft function. Erythropoetin 
stimulating agents will be continued in the post -transplant period if needed.  In general, anemia in 
the setting of delayed graft funct ion (DGF) does not have to be treated in the short term. Because 
the anticipated graft function in this cohort of donors is expected to be quite robust, we would not 
expect DGF to endure longer than one to two weeks post -operatively.  
 
Significant birth de fects if pregnancy occurs while taking the drug or pregnancy occurs up to 6 
months after taking the drug.  
 
Risk of allergic reaction  
Protocol: 2016P002051  
Compound: Elbasvir -grazoprevir                                                                                                             Final  
Raymond Chung, MD                                                                               Amendment 3: 20 September  2017  
 
Version 4.1 Dated: 20 September 2017, inclusive of administrative amendment 1  
 As with any drug, an allergic reaction can occur. Allergic reactions can be mild or serious, and can 
even result in death  in some cases. Common symptoms of an allergic reaction are rash, itching, 
skin problems, swelling of the face and throat, or trouble breathing.  
 
Risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_794980] ™ does not prevent  HCV infection , there is a risk that the virus will develop resistance to 
Zepatier ™ and other similar  drugs. This could limit  treatment options for the patient in the future.  
 
Risks Related to Study Procedures  
 
Risk of Stored Samples  
 
Storing research samples can potentially become a confidentiality risk. If future studies involve 
genetic testing, then there is a chance that this genetic information could get out.  
 
Risks of Blood Draws  
 
The patient  may have a bruise (a black -and-blue mark) or pain where resear chers  take the blood 
samples. There is also a small risk of feeling lightheaded, fainting, or infection.  
   
 
Risks to an Embryo or Fetus, or to a Breastfeeding Infant  
 
Because the effect, if any, of Zepatier ™ on an embryo or fetus  is not known, the patient  may not 
participate in this study if they  are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant .  The 
patient  must agree not to get pregnant during the study and for [ADDRESS_1096676] rate.

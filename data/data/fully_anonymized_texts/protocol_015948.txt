 STUDY SYNOPSIS  
 Study Objectives  
Using opi[INVESTIGATOR_611750], while minimizing potential adverse consequences, 
is an important goal. Appriss Health has developed the “Narcotic Score,” referred to as the “NS 
metric” hereafter, which uses Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) data on opi[INVESTIGATOR_611751] (e.g., multiple providers, pharmacies, etc.) to 
compute a score quantifying the extent of the patient’s risk fo r opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related adverse events  in 
relation to all prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155]. The association between the NS metric and other 
indicators of opi[INVESTIGATOR_611752], and hence, the degree to which this metric 
is a useful  clinical screening tool is unknown. In addition to the NS metric, the Tobacco, Alcohol, 
Prescription medication and other Substances (TAPS) tool is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_611753] a high-quality substance use screening measure  for outpatient health care settings. Given the 
somewhat limited opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- using sample in the TAPS tool validation study (≤5% for prescription 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]; <4% for heroin
1), the current study provides the opportunity to (1) to better assess the 
validity of the TAPS Tool as it would be used in clinical practice in community pharmacy  settings  
(including rural locations), and (2) to provide more clinically useful information for the use of the 
TAPS To ol by [CONTACT_386901] . The present study has two objectives : 
1) Evaluate the concurrent validity of the NS metric as a clinical measure of high risk opi[INVESTIGATOR_611754] -level thresholds relative to the widely validated gold 
standard of the World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement 
Screening Test (WHO ASSIST).2  
 
2) Collect TAPS tool data in a large sample of individuals filling opi[INVESTIGATOR_611755].  
 Study Design  
This study is a one group, cross -sectional, health assessment study . Participants who enroll in 
the study will complete on-line surveys  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_611756], overdose history, substance 
use, mental health, and physical health at a single time point. Appriss Health will provide NS 
metric scores for all participants. These data will also be used to 1) validate and to identify clinical 
cut-off values for the NS metric  and 2) to further validate the TAPS tool .  
 Study Population  
Approximately 1,[ADDRESS_811195] one  prescription(s) for potentially eligible participants , of the survey 
opportunity. Interested patients will complete  an encrypted electronic “interest survey ,” which  will 
trigger REDCap to email the patient a link to a secure web- portal contai ning e-consent (i.e., an 
electronic information sheet that is submitted by [CONTACT_611820]) and self -screening assessment forms. Following submission of the e -consent and 
successful qualification on the sel f-screening assessment , the health survey  will be  made 
available to participants for completion . The REDCap audio features will be enabled to allow 
participants with any reading difficult to request specific items be read out lou d.   
 Assessment s 
The key as sessments are: 1) The NS metric , obtained from Appriss  Health , which is a continuous 
indicator on a 000- 999 scale (higher scores indicate increased risk for adverse opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related 
 NIDA CTN -0093 Version 2.0

7 
 outcomes) ;3,4   2) The WHO ASSIST ; and (3) the TAPS Tool. The WHO ASSIST and TAPS Tool  
will be completed by [CONTACT_611821] a secure REDCap- hosted web portal. Other 
assessments to be captured via self -report through the  secure REDCap -hosted web portal 
include:  1) opi[INVESTIGATOR_611757] (POMI) ;5 
2) pain severity assessed by  [CONTACT_7854]  (BPI) ;6 3) general health status measured 
with a 1-item subscale from the Short Form (SF)-12;7 4) depression assesse d with the Patient 
Health Questionnaire (PHQ) -2;8 and 5) overdose frequency history assessed using the Overdose 
Experiences, Self and Witnessed (OESW -D)—Drug instrument .[ADDRESS_811196] and  to identify cutoff thresholds . A priori 
analyses will involve conducting Receiver Operating Curve Analyses ( ROC; i.e., sensitivity and 
specificity, area under the curve [AUC]) to identify clinical cutoff values for the NS metric and low, 
moderate, and high WHO ASSIST scores.  We will also conduct correlational, regression, and 
Cohen’s Kappa statistical analyses to evaluate the relationship between the NS metric and the 
WHO ASSIST .   
 
We will also conduct exploratory  correlational and regres sion, and Cohen’s Kappa statistical 
analyses to validate the relationship between the NS metric and measure s of opi[INVESTIGATOR_611758]. Exploratory ROC, c orrelational, regression, and 
Cohen’s Kappa statistical analyses between the WHO ASSIST and the TAPS Tool will also be 
conducted.

 NIDA CTN -[ADDRESS_811197] year,10 with 
approximately 36% obtaining opi[INVESTIGATOR_611762] a 
prescriber.[ADDRESS_811198] -year heroin use.10 Fatal overdose deaths involving prescription 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] , heroin, and synthetic opi[INVESTIGATOR_611763] —continuing to 
increase in 35 states from 2013 -2017.23 Given these persistent trends for adverse opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related 
outcomes in populations across the US, it is critical to work to  identify those who are at risk, deliver  
appropriate care that will help prevent progression to more severe opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related outcomes , and 
provide referral and treatment resources  to those who suffer from opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] ( OUD ). 
Therefore, it is necessary to expand the continuum of care to health care settings that previously 
may have been underutilized.   
One underutilized resource for addressing the current opi[INVESTIGATOR_611764]. In the US, 93% of individuals live within 5 miles
24 of the >60,000 community pharmacies that 
employ >170,000 pharmacists.25 National data show that >40% of community pharmacies have 
private counseling rooms where pharmacists can discretely and confidentially provide care.[ADDRESS_811199] trusted professionals in the US,27 with research 
showing patients are willing to receive behavioral health information from these professionals.28  
Previous research among pharmacists has further provided support for possible identification and intervention by [CONTACT_611823][INVESTIGATOR_611765].  Results of a survey in 
2 states (N=739) about opi[INVESTIGATOR_611766] (90%) wanted to help patients who misuse opi[INVESTIGATOR_611767] (81%) and tools (80%) to effectively do so.
29,30  Furthermore, results 
from 333 patients (response=71.2%) screened in 4 community pharmacies receiving  opi[INVESTIGATOR_611768] 15% of patients.31 Among those with misuse, 
98% had ≥1 comorbid health condition known to increase risk for misuse or overdose, including 
depression, posttraumatic stress, risky alcohol use, and poor health and pain exceeding US 
norms. Patients  in this sample were agreeable to pharmacists screening their opi[INVESTIGATOR_611769] (70.9%) and discussing medication use if pharmacists had a concern (82.1%; with no 
differences between misusing and non -misusing respondents, p>.05).32,[ADDRESS_811200] available to identify possible misuse of opi[INVESTIGATOR_611770] (PDMP),34-41 which capture patient -level 
prescription dispensing information to inform monitoring, dispensing decisions, and possible 
intervention.35,36,38,41 These tools are available in all US states  (Missouri relies on a county -
administered program)  and have the potential to enable pharmacists to identify patients at -risk for 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related adverse events, such as addiction and overdose. Appriss Health is the largest 
PDMP platform vendor in the US, providing PDMP services statewide in [ADDRESS_811201]  on “best judgment” to 
provide patient care and referrals with a limited evidence base.  Appriss Health has developed an 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_611771], the NS metric, which could support community pharmacists’ decision- making 
regarding interventions for  opi[INVESTIGATOR_362466]. However, the validity of the NS metric has not been 
evaluated.  
 Rationale  
In light of the continued escalation of  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_611772] , combined with the promising 
opportunities afforded by [CONTACT_611824][INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related risk, it is important to evaluate whether  current PDMP risk metrics  
correlate with clinically validated opi[INVESTIGATOR_611773] . The present  study will accomplish two important objectives.  
 
First, the NS metric  has not been empi[INVESTIGATOR_611774]. This 
formative research projec t will leverage  public/private part nerships among the OVN , University of 
Cincinnati, University of Utah, Purdue University,  Appriss Health, and Kroger Pharmacies to 
validate and identify risk thresholds for the NS metrics through comparison with the widely 
validated gold standard WHO ASSIST. Successfully completing this objective is the first important 
step in understanding the validity of current PDMP metrics  and establishing clinically meaningful 
risk tools for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], which would allow community pharmacists to accurately and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_611775]. These results will provide foundational data that will allow our team to continue 
this line of research and further collaborate with Appriss Health to identify  and test a PDMP -based, 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-f ocused,  decision support tool for community pharmacies.   
 
The second  objective of this study is  to further validate the TAPS tool. Mentioned previously , the 
TAPS tool is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_611753] a high- quality  substance use screening measure for 
outpatient health care settings.  1  The recent validation study for this tool, conducted  with primary 
care patients , showed high levels of sensitivity and specificity for tobacco and heavy alcohol use 
(>0.79), and adequate sensitivity and specificity for illicit and prescription drug use ( >0.63).1 Given 
the somewhat limited opi[INVESTIGATOR_611776] (≤5% for prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]; 
<4% for heroin1), the current study provides the opportunity (1) to better assess the validity of the 
TAPS Tool as it would be used in clinical practice in community pharmacy settings  (including rural 
locations) , and (2) to provide more clinically useful information for the use of TAPS Tool by 
[CONTACT_386901] . 
 Significance to the Field  
 
The first study objective builds on previous research from our team that has focused on 
understanding the needs and opportunities available for identification of , and intervention for, 
problematic opi[INVESTIGATOR_611777].29,30,45- [ADDRESS_811202] objective 
is achieved, the results from this study would enable rapid identification of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related risk 
utilizing data from a widely -available PDMP platform vendor (Appriss Health).  
 
The second study objective also builds on previous research from CTN investigators1,[ADDRESS_811203] information ( e.g., name, address, phone number) as well as information regarding the 
location of the pharmacy and time/dates for when the study interest form was completed and 
submitted into REDCap .  
 Duration of Study and Visit Schedule  
Enrollment is expected to take place over a period of approximately 6-[ADDRESS_811204] include, the: University of Cincinnati, University of 
Utah, and Purdue University. Recruitment sites for the study include approximately [ADDRESS_811205] one of the definitions of rural 
using the “Am I Rural” online tool ( https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/am -i-rural).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Recruitment Site Characteristics  
Study site characteristics reflect  the need to recruit community pharmacy patients receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_611778]. 
For study feasibility, it was determined that each recruitment site also needed to be a Kroger 
pharmacy in the state of Ohio or rural Indiana that filled an adequate number of patients’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_611779]. The Kroger Pharmacy chain was selected as the partner for this project based on 
4 primary reasons:  
 
1. Sites selected will dispense and average of  ≥300 patients’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_486572] a 
6-month period, resulting in a patient pool of approximately  ≥4,500 potential participants; 
 
2. Kroger and Appriss  Health  have a long history of collaboration, and therefore partnering 
on this project will be familiar to both companies. Kroger also has a long history of 
collaboration with University of Cincinnati and Purdue University.   
3. Kroger is the 5th largest pharmacy chain in the US, and thus represents a possible scalable service setting if the primary objective of the current study is successful.  
 
 NIDA CTN -[ADDRESS_811206] pharmacy locations within ethnically and racially diverse populations to 
promote the recruitment of a diverse study sample.   
  Participant Selection  
This study will enroll  approximately 1,523 patients who w ill complete a web -based health survey .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Inclusion Criteria  
Potential participants must : 
1. be dispensed ≥1 opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536] (including tramadol ) by a participating Kroger 
Pharmacy ; 
 
2. be ≥18 years of age according to Kroger Pharmacy  data and self -report  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Exclusion Criteria  
Potential participants must not self -report : 
1. solely filling buprenorphine or buprenorphine combination products i.e., patients receiving OUD treatment with no other opi[INVESTIGATOR_96185]; 
 
2. currently receiving treatment for cancer ; 
 
3. having  previously completed the survey ( this will be re -verified by [CONTACT_611825]);  
 
4. having current involvement with the criminal justice system that has, or could, lead to 
incarceration  
Mentioned above, we will enable REDCap audio features to allow participants with any reading difficult to request specific items be read out loud.   
 NIDA CTN -[ADDRESS_811207] digit representing 
number of active opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155] (those with ≥9 prescriptions coded as 9) and the first two 
numbers representing a composite risk score. Higher scores indicate increased risk for adverse 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related outcomes (e.g., overdose). The first two digits of the score are based on 
deterministic calculations3,4 and use well -known indicators associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related 
adverse events.49-52 These calculations are produced through t he following steps:  
1) For a given patient, raw indicators of five risk factors are extracted from PDMP data: (a) 
morphine milligram equivalents (MME) dispensed, (b) lorazepam milligram equivalents 
(LME) dispensed, (c) overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_611780], (d) number of prescribers, and (e) numbers of pharmacies.  
2) Each raw indicator is converted to a scaled value between 0 and 99 (based on percentiles 
from a large PDMP reference population), for four time periods: (a) past 2 months, (b) past 6 months, (c) past 12 months, and (d) past [ADDRESS_811208]; for example, having [ADDRESS_811209] 2 months has a greater scaled percentile score (i.e., 85) than having [ADDRESS_811210] 2 years (i.e., 30).  
3) Scaled values for each of the five indicators are averaged across their four respective time 
periods.  
4) A weighted sum of the five averaged values is calculated: MME is given a weight of 3; 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_611781] a weight of 2; and LME, number of prescribers, 
number of pharmacies are each given a weight of 1. This sum is divided by 8 to produce a 
weighted average, yielding a two- digit composite risk score; these are the first two digits of 
the NS metric.  
5) The total number of active opi[INVESTIGATOR_611782]- digit composite risk 
score, to form the final three- digit NS metric.  
  WHO ASSIST  
The WHO ASSIST  will be used as the gold standard to which the NS metric will be  compared. 
The WHO ASSIST  was constructed in a large -scale multi- country study, which demonstrated 
criterion, construct, concurrent, discriminant validity.[ADDRESS_811211] 3 months and lifetime: tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, 
amphetamine, inhalants, sedatives, hallucinogens, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and other drugs.  
In addition to the WHO ASSIST, we will capture [ADDRESS_811212].  
  TAPS  Tool 
Substance use will also be captured using TAPS 1/2 tool , which has demonstrated concurrent 
validity. 1 This assessment contains between 5- 14 items regarding a respondent’s substance 
use in the last [ADDRESS_811213] analytical models, and perform exploratory 
analyses .  
  Prescription Opi[INVESTIGATOR_611783], which 
has demonstrated criterion validity.5 This measure contains 6 yes/no items about an individual’s 
current use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_611784], taking more than prescribed, doctor shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and using the medication to cope with problems. This assessment will require 5 minutes or less to compete.  
  Overdose E xperiences, Self and Witnessed —Drug  
Overdose frequency history will be assessed using the overdose frequency item from the  
criterion -valid Overdose Experiences, Self and Witnessed—Drug instrument.[ADDRESS_811214] experienced a drug overdose. This assessment will require 1 minute or less to compete.  
  Brief Pain Inventory  
Pain severity will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI ), a well -validated, reliable 
instrument that consists of a [ADDRESS_811215] -valid Short 
Form -12.7 This Likert scale item asks respondents to rate their general health from excellent to 
poor. This assessment will require 1 minute or less to compete.  
  Patient Health Questionnaire 
Depression will be captured using the criterion- valid  Patient Health Questionnaire- 2.8 This 2 -
item assessment asks respondents to rate on a Likert scale (ranging from ‘n ot at all’ to ‘nearly

 every day’ ) their interest or pleasure in doing things and feeling of being down or depressed  in 
the last two weeks. This assessment will require 1 minute or less to compete.  
 Safety Measures  
This study  will not involve  the use of any clinical interventi on or medi cations.  The only expected  
risk to participants  is a loss of confident iality, which wi ll be minimized by  [CONTACT_611826].  Any breach of confidentiality  will be reported on a protocol  deviation  form. 
Data security will also be ensured for transferring data files to and from Appriss Health by 
[CONTACT_14662] a HIPAA compliant, encrypted, and secure data storage cloud site.   
 Other Measures  
  Recruitment/ Screening Assessments  
Recruitment  – Kroger Pharmacy staff will aid in track ing which patients have been provided with 
information about the study  and how that information was shared.    
 
Interest form  – Participants interested in learning more about the study will complete an electronic 
“interest form” in which they provide their contact [CONTACT_611827] (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity). Kroger pharmacy staff will be available to answer 
participant questions regarding the interest form. If completing the interest form remotely, study 
staff’s contact [CONTACT_611828].  
 
  Self-screening assessment  
Following e -consent, participants will complete a self -screening assessment , which will include 
questions about opi[INVESTIGATOR_611785] (including Kroger Pharmacy at which the 
qualifying prescription was filled), whether they are being treated for cancer, have involvement with the criminal justice system, and whether they have participated in the study previously. 
Study staff’s contact [CONTACT_611829] e- consent form , self-screening 
assessment, and the health survey. They will be available to answer any questions the 
participant may have.  
  Additional  PDMP Data  
Appriss Health may also provide, in addition to the NS metric, other related data that possibly 
will be informative for the objectives of this study. Examples of these other data elements could 
include non- opi[INVESTIGATOR_611786], prescribing information, and/or di spensing 
information.

 Participant  Recruitment and Consent   
A convenience sample of adult patients being dispensed opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155]  (including tramadol 
and not solely receiving buprenorphine or buprenorphine combination products) at any of the 
participating Kroger Pharmacy locations  will be recruited.  Recognizing the busy nature of the 
Kroger Pharmacy environment, we have intentionally  designed the recruitment process to require 
minimal pharmacy staff involvement, requiring staff to only assess the patients’ ages and 
prescription information to target potentially eligible participants.  Trained Kroger Pharmacy staff 
will inform potentially eligible participants of the survey opportunity. Interested patients will be 
handed a study flyer and an electronic device (e.g., tablet, etc.) with an electronic “interest survey.” 
Study flyers may also be given to customers pi[INVESTIGATOR_611790] -[ADDRESS_811216] survey.  Interested patients will complete the encrypted 
electronic “interest survey,” which will trigger REDCap to email the patient a link to a secure web-
portal containing the e-consent (i.e., an electronic informed consent information sheet t hat is 
submitted by [CONTACT_611820]) .  
 
The IRB will be asked to waive the written informed consent  requirement  because this is a minimal 
risk study . This study, which includes participants completing on -line self -assessments, could not 
be practicably carried out if written consent were required. The IRB-approved e-consent  
information sheet  will include a description of all significant elements of the study: what 
participation entails; risks and benefits of study procedures; alternatives to participation in the study; confidentiality; $50 payment for participation information ; a statement that participation is 
voluntary and that the participant may withdraw at any time; and information about whom to 
contact [CONTACT_38450]. The e- consent form will also indicate that the decision to participate will in 
no way influence other aspects of the participant’s  treatment , and participants’ data will not be 
shared with their clinicians .  
  
 Screening  
Following submission of the e -consent, the participant will complete  the screening self -
assessment , and  if qualified, the participant will be given access to the health survey.  
 Premature Withdrawal of Participants  
All participants  are allowed  to withdraw  consent at any stage  of the study.  In addition , 
the Ll, or designee,  can remove  the participant  from the study  when  there  is evidence  that 
the study  might  be harmful  to the participant.  
 Study Halting Rules  
Given that this study is low risk and does not provide a clinical  intervention of any type, it is not 
anticipated that study will be halted at any time. However, if for an unforeseen reason the study 
is prematurely terminated or temporarily suspended, the LI, or designee,  will promptly inform the  
respective IRB and sponsor and provide the reason(s) for the termination or temporary 
suspension. If the study is suspended, the investigative team will work with the appropriate parties to resolve the existing issue in order to reinitiate the study. 
 Follow -Up  
Participants who complete the e- consent  and are eligible for the study  but do not compl ete the 
health survey  within 3 business days will be contact[CONTACT_611831].  
 Participan t Reimbursement   
Following submission of the completed survey and research staff verifying data are complete with valid answers (valid indicated by [CONTACT_611832])  and are 
not a duplicate participant submission, partici pants will be provided with a $[ADDRESS_811217] data on the TAPS tool in a large sample of individuals filling opi[INVESTIGATOR_611791] a novel outpatient setting, community 
pharmacy . 
 Study Hypothes es  
Similar to the “ The TAPS Tool: Screen and Brief Assessment Tool Validation  Study , CTN-
0059”,  this study will not test any intervention or hypothesis .54 This study will focus on the level 
of agreement between the NS metric and participants' responses to opi[INVESTIGATOR_611792]. The goal of the project is to validate and identify risk cutoffs between the NS metric 
and the  WHO ASSIST. As such, the study is a measurement validation project and so has no 
primary outcome variables.[ADDRESS_811218] risk categories. See CTN 0093 Statistical Analysis Plan f or details.  
 Rationale for Sample Size and Statistical Power   
  Projected Number of Sites   
This study will involve 15 participating Kroger Pharmacies. Sites will include 12 Kroger 
Pharmacies in Ohio and 3 rural Kroger Pharmacies in Indiana.  
  Projected Numb er of Participants per Site  
Survey sample size power estimates are based on the allocation ratio of the national rate of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (POUD) among those prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_611793] (2.1%,
55 i.e. 46.6/1). Thus, the sample is powered to the least prevalent but most severe 
condition among potential patients . We calculated an array of sample sizes powered to achieve 
≥80% power (α=0.05) and 0.70 (“fair”) Area Under the Curve value, 56,57 using a conservative null 
hypothesis assumption of 0.5 for discrimination power (Table 2).58 Therefore, to ensure the 
maximum power for the study, we will target recruitment to 1,523 total patients.  
 
Table 2. Power Analyses (AUC=0.70, Discrimination Power=0.5)  
Power  N

0.85 714 
0.90 809 
0.95 1,047  
0.98 1,523  
 
Each Kroger pharmacy site will be responsible for approaching approximately 207 patients 
(~3,105 collectively). Of these, we anticipate 70% will be interested and agree to share their 
contact [CONTACT_3031].31 Of these, based on our current research among this population 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), we anticipate 70% will actually provide e- consent and complete the survey. 
Therefore, each site will refer approximately [ADDRESS_811219] and to identify cutoff thresholds. A priori 
analyses will involve conducting Receiver Operating Curve Analyses (ROC; i.e., sensitivity and 
specific ity, area under the curve [AUC]) to identify clinical cutoff values for the NS metric and 
low, moderate, and high WHO ASSIST scores. We will also conduct correlational, regression, and Cohen’s Kappa statistical analyses to evaluate the relationship between the NS metric and 
the WHO ASSIST.   
 We will also conduct exploratory correlational, regression, and Cohen’s Kappa statistical 
analyses to validate the relationship between the NS metric and measures of opi[INVESTIGATOR_611758]. Exploratory ROC, correlational, regression, and Cohen’s Kappa statistical analyses between the WHO ASSIST and the TAPS Tool will also be 
conducted. Considerations in determining the statistical approach can be found in the CTN -
[ADDRESS_811220] with a type I error rate of 5%.  
 Missing Data and Dropouts   
This study  does  not include follow -up assessments,  and all study  assessments wi ll be 
completed  during  the electronic health assessment survey . Missing  data and dropouts  are 
expected to be relatively  minimal. Nonetheless,  the analysis  will determine the extent  of 
missing  data for all study  variables  and explore di fferences  in miss ing data by [CONTACT_654], gender,  
and race/eth nicity. The completer population, defined as participants who complete opi[INVESTIGATOR_611794], will be used for the 
main analysis. Completers also must have NS metric scores. Multiple imputation will be 
conducted for missing covariates , but missing key outcome data will not be imputed.  See CTN 
0093 Statistical Analysis Plan for details.  
 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline demographic and clinical variables will be summarized for enrolled participants. 
Descriptive summaries of the distribution of continuous baseline variables will be presented, 
with measures of central tendency. Categorical variables will be summarized in terms of 
frequencies and percentages.  In addition, analyses will be conducted on the primary and 
exploratory aims for male and female gender subgroups. See CTN-0093 Statistical Analysis 
Plan.

 REGULATORY COMPLIANCE, REPORTING AND 
MONITORING  
 Regulatory Compliance   
This study will be conducted in full conformity with the ethical principles outlined in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, the Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects codified in the 
International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines, and all other 
applicable regulatory requirements. Written approval for the study protocol, e -consent form, 
other supporting documents, and any advertising for participant recruitment will be provided to 
the participating University sites and Kroger recruitment  sites by [CONTACT_4707] 
(IRB) of record prior to participation in the study. Any amendments to the protocol or e- consent 
materials must be approved by [CONTACT_421716]. Unanticipated 
problems involving risk to study participants will be promptly reported to and reviewed by [CONTACT_268633], according to its usual procedures. Annual progress reports will be submitted to 
the IRB, according to its usual procedures.  
 
This study will be registered and updated as needed in ClinicalTrials.gov . 
 State ment of Compliance   
This study will be conducted in accordance with the current version of the protocol, in full conformity with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, the Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects codified i n the International Council for Harmonization Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines, and all other applicable regulatory requirements. Institutional Review Board Approval   
 Per NOT -OD-16-094, the University of Cincinnati IRB (UC IRB) will be the IRB of r ecord for the 
protocol and will provide study oversight in accordance with [ADDRESS_811221] entered into reliance/authorization 
agreements for Protocol CTN 0093 . The University  of Cincinnati  will follow written procedures for 
reporting its findings and actions to appropriate officials at each participating institution , see Single 
Site IRB (sIRB) Plan .  
 Prior to initiating the study, university site investigators will obtain written IRB approval to conduct 
the study at their respective site, see sIRB Plan . If changes to the study protocol become 
necessary, protocol amendments will be submitted in writing by [CONTACT_354355]. In addition, IRBs will approve the e- consent form, recruitment materials, 
and any materials given to the participant, and any changes made to these documents throughout study implementation. For changes to the e- consent form, a decision will be made regarding 
whether previously enrolled participants need to be re- enrolled. IRB continuing review will be 
performed annually, or at a greater frequency contingent upon the complexity and risk of the study. Each site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_611795], IRB -approved e- consent documents, and approval for all protocol modifications. 
These materials must be received by [CONTACT_413579], and must be available at any time for audit.  
 Informed Consent   
The consent process is a means of providing study information to each prospective participant and provides an opportunity  for an informed decision about participation in the study.  Because 
this study is minimal risk, in volving  on-line completion of a survey at one time point, an altered 
 NIDA CTN -0093 Version 2.0 
 PharmScreen  May. 25, 21  
 
22 
 consent process will be utilized. Specifically, participants will access an IRB -approved electronic 
informed consent information sheet  (i.e., e -consent)  and indicate their consent to participate by 
[CONTACT_20683] “continue” at the end of the sheet. The e-consent information sheet  must be updated or 
revised whenever important new safety information is available, or whenever the protocol is 
amended in a way that may affect participants’ participation in the study . The rights and welfare 
of the participants will be communicated  by [CONTACT_611833].  The 
participant will be informed that their participation is voluntary and they may withdraw from the 
study at any time, for any reason without penalty. Individuals who refuse to participate or who 
withdraw from the study will be treated without prejudice.  
 Quality Assurance M onitoring  
In accordance with federal regulations, the study sponsor is responsible for ensuring proper  
monitoring of an investigation and ensuring that the investigation is conducted in accordance with 
the protocol. Qualified local monitors will oversee participating University sites to ensure they are  
operating within the confines of the protocol  and in accordance with GCP.  Monitoring includes , 
but is not limited to , protocol compliance, documentation auditing, and reporting  safety  events . 
Non-conformity  with protocol and federal regulations can be reported as a protocol deviation and 
submitted to the study sponsor and study IRB for further review.  Reports will be prepared following 
monitoring reviews and forwarded to the investigative team and NIDA CCTN.  If the monitor’s  
review indicates that additional training of site study personnel is needed, QA personnel will undertake or arrange for that training. Monitoring will occur not more than quarterly  and not less 
than annually. Details of QA and data monitoring are found in the study QA Monitoring Plan.  
 Participant and Data Confidentiality   
Confidentiality will be maintained in accordance with all applicable federal regulations and/or 
state/Commonwealth law and regulations. By [CONTACT_200877] , the investigator 
affirms that information furnished to the investigator by [CONTACT_611834]/Privacy Board, Ethical Review Committee, or similar 
expert committee; affiliated institution; and employees only under an appropriate understanding of confidentiality with such board or committee, affiliated institution, and employees.  
 
To further protect the privacy of study participants, the lead investigator will obtain a federal 
Certific ate of Confidentiality (CoC)  from NIH , which protects identifiable research inf ormation from 
forced disclosure  and will distribute it to all sites when received. This protect s participants against 
disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., drug use) . The C oC allows the investigator and others 
who have access to research records to permanently refuse to disclose identifying information on 
research participation in any civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, 
whether at the federal, state, or local level, excepting certain circumstances . 
 
By [CONTACT_413580], CoCs  help achieve the research objectives and promote 
participation in studies by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_21783].  The NIH office 
that issues the CoC will be advised of changes in the CoC application information. Participating 
sites will be notified if CoC revision is necessary. Participant records will be held confidential by 
[CONTACT_611835]  (eCRF), secure 
storage of any encrypted documents that have participant identifiers, and secure computing 
procedures for entering and transferring electronic data.

 Financial Disclosure /Conflict of Interest  
All investigators will comply with the requirements of [ADDRESS_811222] met their instit utional financial disclosure requirements. 
 Performance Monitoring 
OVN and University of Utah leadership  will develop a Performance Monitoring Plan. This plan 
will detail, according to the study timeline, progress the study will make to accomplish its goals . 
The plan will include the development  of performance metrics  and will likewise detail procedures 
and guidance for underperforming recruitment sites. Performance metrics will be assessed in 
regularly scheduled study meetings  (not to occur more than weekly  and less than monthly ). For 
these meeting s, a performance summary report will be made available to the research team. By 
[CONTACT_416310], the report will include information such as:  
 Number of initiated vs. completed interest surveys  
 Number of completed interest surveys vs. expected by [CONTACT_611836]  
 Number of initiated vs. completed e- consent forms  
 Number of competed e- consent forms vs. expected by [CONTACT_611836]  
 Number of initiated vs. completed self -screening forms  
 Number completed self -screening forms v s. expected by [CONTACT_611836]  
 Description of reasons potential participants are screened as ineligible 
 Number of initiated vs. completed health assessment surveys  
 Number of completed health assessment surveys vs. expected by [CONTACT_611837]’s regular comparison of these metrics by [CONTACT_611838], low 
performing sites will be identified. Procedures for improvement of low performing sites will include actions such as:  
 Discussion of the site’s performance with Kroger  Corporate, Regional, and local 
management.  
 Performing on -site visit s to discuss performance issues, identify barriers, and make 
plans to increase performance.  
 Discussion and planning with research staff regarding outreach to participant s with 
initiated  and uncompleted forms .  
 Identification of possible additional Kroger pharmacy sites for outreach advertisement  
 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
The study sites should aim and take steps to enroll a diverse study population. Noted in section 
2.3 of the study appendix, based on our previous research on this topic, we anticipate 57% of our 
sample will be female, and 43% will be male.  Assessments captured (i.e., TAPS Tool alcohol 
subscale) are specified for male vs. female respondents.  We also anticipate our study sample will 
approximate the racial/ethnic distributions of the local areas in which the recruitment stores 
operate. If difficulty is encountered in recruiting an adequate number of women and/or minorities, 
the difficulties involved in recruitment will  be discussed in national conference calls and/or face -
to-face meetings  and plans to correct these difficulties will be put into place .  
 
 
 
 NIDA CTN -[ADDRESS_811223]  of a study  and the quality  of the data produced.  These  documents  serve  to demonstrate 
the compliance of the investigator, sponsor, and monitor with the standards of Good Clinical Practice and with all applicable regulatory requirements. The regulatory files should contain all 
required regulatory documents, study -specific documents, and all important communications. 
Regulatory files will be checked at each participating University site for regulatory document 
compliance prior to study initiation, throughout the study  according to regularly agreed upon 
schedule (not more than quarterly  and less than annually ), as well as at study closure by [CONTACT_611839], see section 10. 4.  
 Records Retention and Requirements   
Research records for all study participants are to be maintained by [CONTACT_611840] a secure location for a minimum of [ADDRESS_811224] or outcome of the study  or increase risk to s tudy 
participants. Safety reporting will occur as previously described. At the completion of the study , 
the Lead Investigator will provide a final report to the Sponsor.  
 Audits   
The Sponsor has an obligation to ensure that this study  is conducted according to good research 
practice guidelines and may perform quality assurance audits for protocol compliance. The LI and 
authorized staff from the participating research institutions; the National Institute on Drug Abuse 
Clinical Trials Ne twork (NIDA CTN, the study sponsor); and other agencies such as the 
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Office for Human Research Protection 
(OHRP) , and the Institutional Review Board of record may inspect research records for verification 
of data, compliance with federal guidelines on human participant research, and to assess 
participant safety.  
 Study Documentation  
Each participating University site will maintain appropriate study documentation (including 
research records) for this study , in compliance with ICH E6 and regulatory and institutional 
 NIDA CTN -[ADDRESS_811225] correspondence, and approved e- consent document . As 
part of participating in a NIDA -sponsored study, each site will permit authorized representatives 
from NIDA and regulatory agencies to examine (and when permitted by [CONTACT_2371], to copy)  records for 
the purposes of quality assurance reviews, audits, and evaluation of the study safety, progress, 
and data validity.  
 Protocol Deviations   
Any departure from procedures and requirements outlined in the protocol will be classified as 
either a major or minor protocol deviation. The difference between a major and minor protocol 
deviation has to do with the seriousness of the event and the corrective action required. A minor 
protocol deviation is considered an action (or inaction) that by [CONTACT_200884], rights, or welfare of a study 
participant. Major protocol deviations are departures that may compromise the participant safety, participant rights, inclusion/exclusion criteria or the integrity of study data and could be cause for 
corrective actions if not rectified or prevented from re- occurrence. Sites will be responsible for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_611796] a 
reasonable period of time following their discovery. Those corrective action plans may be 
reviewed/approved by [CONTACT_611841]. All protocol 
deviations will be monitored at each site for (1) significance, (2) frequency, and (3) impact on the 
study objectives to ensure that site performance does not compromise the integrity of the study .  
All protocol deviations will be recorded in a REDCap form developed for this project.  
 
Additionally, each site is responsible for reviewing the IRB  of record’s definition of a protocol 
deviation or violation and understanding which events need to be reported. Sites must recognize 
that the CTN and IRB definition of a reportable event may differ and act accordingly in following 
all reporting requirements for both entities.  
 Safety Monitoring  
 Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)   
This study is not an intervention trial and will not require a Data and Safety Monitoring Board. The Lead Investigator along with the Co- Lead Investigator and sub- investigators are 
responsible for adhering to the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.  
 Training  
The CTN -0093 study staff will be trained as specified in the study Training Plan. Training will 
include Human Subjects Protection (HSP) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) as well as protocol -
specific training on assessments, study procedures, data management, quality assurance, etc.  
 
 NIDA CTN -[ADDRESS_811226] with the pharmacy recruitment 
sites, limited responsibilities  are designated to these sites. However, one important note regarding 
the Data Management Plan is that it will include procedures, for example, regarding how Kroger 
staff will capture: if  patients were informed about the study and how  they were informed about the 
study . The Plan will also discuss, for example, how these data will be shared on a scheduled 
basis  with OVN and the University of Utah for assessing sampling bias.  
 Data Center Responsibilities   
The OVN and University of Utah  will collaborate to 1) develop a Data Management Plan and will 
conduct data management activities in accordance with that plan, 2) provide guidance for  eCRFs 
for the collection of all data required by [CONTACT_1758], 3) develop data dictionaries for each eCRF that 
will comprehensively define each data element, 4) conduct ongoing data monitoring activities on 
study data from all participating sites, 5) conduct  any preliminary analysis data cleaning activities 
as needed, and 6) conduct  final study data cleaning.  
 Data Collection   
The data collection process consists of direct data entry at the recruitment pharmacies  and/or by 
[CONTACT_611842]. Data entry into REDCap  should be completed 
according to the instructions provided and project specific training. Assessments programmed in REDCap will use validation rules, integrity checks, and hard stops as needed to ensure that data 
are as complete and accurate as possible.  For instance,  validity checks will employ skip logic to 
ensure certain item sets are not available to respondents once initial responses are given (e.g., alcohol consumption questions will not be available to those who report they do not drink). Regarding completeness of responses , all survey response sets will require every item to be 
answered in order to complete the survey. However, to preserve participants’ rights to not respond to any item they wish, the response set will include an option that will allow the participant to 
indicate they wish to not respond to the item.  This process will ensure survey data completion 
with minimal missing values.  Furthermore, given that data are entered directly into the REDCap 
survey by [CONTACT_611843], we 
anticipate a high level of validity and accuracy  (absence of data entry errors)  in this project.  
 Data Merge  
Data collected in  the health survey from study participants will be regularly  merged with NS 
metric data from Appriss Health. OVN and University of Utah staff will securely share participant 
contact [CONTACT_3031], dispensing pharmacy, and demographic information with Appriss who will 
deterministically link NS metric data. Linked data will be returned from Appriss to the OVN  and 
the University of Utah.  
 NIDA CTN -[ADDRESS_811227] 
access to eCRFs.  
 Data Transfer/Lock  
Data will be transmitted by [CONTACT_611844]. The OVN and University of Utah  will conduct final data quality assurance 
checks and “lock” the study database from further modification. The final analysis dataset will be 
returned to NIDA, as requested, for storage and archive.  We will comply with the following policy 
regarding the pr eparation and transfer of the study data: 
 
“Data from CTN trials are  posted [ADDRESS_811228]. All of the data are de-identified, and only raw data (i.e., no analysis  datasets or derived variables) are 
provided. Data documentation, consisting of all annotated case report forms 
(CRFs), the data dictionary, and de- identification notes, is provided to users to 
assist in data interpretation. Protocol documentation, including a brief study description, the study protocol, and a link to the primary manuscript, is also 
provided, and users are encouraged to consult these documents for insight 
regarding proper interpretation of the data .” 
 Data Training  
The Training Plan for res earch  staff includes provisions for training on assessments, eCRF 
completion guidelines, data management procedures, and the use of REDCap.  
 Data Quality Assurance  
To address the issue of data entry quality, the OVN and University of Utah  will follow a Dat a 
Management  Plan. Data quality summaries will be made available during the course of the 
protocol , and acceptable quality level prior to study lock or closeout will be established as a part 
of the Data Management Plan. Data quality will be assessed in regularly scheduled study 
meetings  (not to occur more than weekly and less than monthly) . For these meeting s, a data 
quality summary report will be made available to the research team. By [CONTACT_416310], the report will include information, such as:  
 
 Number of interest forms with missing data  
 Description of missing data on the interest form  
 Number of health assessment surveys with missing data  
 D escription of missing data on health assessment surveys  
 Number of surveys linked to the NS metric  
 Description of surveys/participants with unlinked surveys

 APPENDIX: DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
1.0 BRIEF STUDY OVERVIEW  
Using opi[INVESTIGATOR_611750], while minimizing potential adverse consequences, 
is an important goal. Appriss Health has developed the NS metric , which uses PDMP  data on 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_611815] (e.g., multiple providers, 
pharmacies, etc.) to compute a score quantifying the extent of the patient’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_611816]. The association between the NS metric and other indicators of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related risk  has not been evaluated, and hence, the degree to which this metric is a 
useful screening tool is unknown.  
 
The primary objective of this one group, cross -sectional, validation study is to evaluate the 
concurrent validity of the NS metric as a clinical measure of opi[INVESTIGATOR_611817], Smoking, 
and Substance Involvement Screening Test (WHO ASSIST). A secondary objective of the study 
is to collect  validity data on the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication and other Substances 
(TAPS) tool in a large sample of individuals filling opi[INVESTIGATOR_2454].  
 
Participant Inclusion Criteria  
Potential participants must : 
1. be dispensed ≥1 opi[INVESTIGATOR_433697] (including tramadol) by a participating Kroger 
Pharmacy;  
 
2. be ≥[ADDRESS_811234] not self -report : 
1. not solely filling buprenorphine or buprenorphine combination products i.e., patients receiving OUD treatment with no other opi[INVESTIGATOR_96185]; 
 
2. currently receiving treatment for cancer;  
 
3. having previously completed the survey (this will be re -verified by [CONTACT_611825]);  
 
4. having current involvement with the criminal justice system that has, or could, lead to 
incarceration  
Sample Size  
This study will recruit  approximately  1,[ADDRESS_811235] of participating enrolling clinics or data collection centers: All potential participants will be 
Kroger community pharmacy patients dispensed  opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007].  
2. Project timetable: This study will take approximately 24 months to complete. Data collection 
will require 6 -8 months and data analysis will require approximately 3-6 months . 
 NIDA CTN -0093 Version 2.0 
 PharmScreen  May. 25, 21  
 
35 
  
3. Target population distribution: As noted above, based on our previous research, we anticipate 
57% of participants will be women (n=868). In terms of racial distribution, we anticipate the 
population will generally reflect that of the states where participants are recruited.  The 
following estimates assume an even distribution of participant recruitment across study sites. For Ohio, we anticipate 82.2% (n=1002) will be white, 12 .9% (n=157) black or African 
American, 2.3% (n=28) Asian, and 2.3% (n=28) from two or more races. Of these, we anticipate 3.8% (n=46) will be Hispanic or Latino. For Indiana, we anticipate 83.9% (n=256) will be white, 9.3% (n=28)  black or African American,  2.1% Asian (n=6), and 2.3% from two 
or more races (n=7). Of these, we anticipate 6.7% (n=20) will be Hispanic or Latino.  
3.0 DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS  
1. Data acquisition and transmission: Information for study  participants  will be obtained from two 
sources.  The first source will be from s elf-reported responses on REDCap forms, including 
contact [CONTACT_3031], demographics, and health information. The second source will be Appriss 
Health , who will provide the NS metric for all patients enrolled in the study. All research staff 
will be trained in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. In addition, demographic information about all patients informed about the study  will be obtained from the participating 
Kroger pharmacies. Only research staff members directly involved with the study will have 
access to identifying information for the participants.  
 
2. Data entry methods: Demographic and clinical data for study participants will be managed in 
REDCap, a software toolset and workflow methodology for collection and mana gement of 
clinical research data developed by [CONTACT_50222], in collaboration with institutional partners including the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center. Only the necessary 
study personnel will have access to the database. 
 
3. A priori statistical  analysis plan: Our a priori analyses to identify clinical cutoff values will 
involve assessing the ability of the NS metric to discriminate between low, moderate, and 
high-risk opi[INVESTIGATOR_611818] (ROC) 
analyses. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) values will be used to determine the accuracy of discrimination threshold levels, and we will identify sensitivity and specificity values balancing 
low false positive and low false negative rates to determine the NS metric thresholds that 
classify the specified use thresholds from these opi[INVESTIGATOR_611819]. Cohen’s Kappa Coefficient s 
59,[ADDRESS_811236] using: Spearman’s rho correlation analyses and logistic regression models. 
61-64  Statistical significance values (p<0.05) and magnitudes of correlation and agreement will 
be used to assess association between indicators.  Detailed specifications of study variables 
and a priori  and exploratory  analytical procedures are described in the CTN- [ADDRESS_811237] (DSMB)  
This study  is not an intervention trial and will not require  a Data  and Safety  Monitoring Board.  
The Lead  Investi gator  along with the Co-Lead Investigator  and sub-investigators  are 
responsible for adhering  to the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Plan. 
C. Quality Assurance (QA) Monitoring  
Study  monitoring will be conducted on a regular basis using local QA monitor s. QA monitor s will 
assess compliance with the protocol,  GCP requirements , and other applicable regulatory 
requirements, as well as  document the integrity of the study  progress. Areas of particular concern 
will be protocol adherence, IRB reviews and approvals,  and regulatory documents. The monitors 
will interact with the participating University site staff to identify issues and re -train the site as 
needed to enhance research quality.  QA Reports will be prepared by [CONTACT_611845].  These reports will be sent to the investigative team  and NIDA CCTN. The investig ative 
site will provide direct access to all study related sites (e.g., research office), source 
data/documentation, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_611846], as well as inspection by [CONTACT_3482].  See protocol sections 10. 4, 
10.10, 10.11,  and 10.13.  
D. Management of Risks to Participants  
Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of participant records will be ensured by [CONTACT_611847]. No identifying information will be disclosed in reports, 
publications , or presentations.  
Information That Meet s Reporting Requirements 
The e-consent document will specify the types of information that are required for reporting and 
that the information will be reported as required. These include suspected or known sexual or 
physical abuse of a child or elders, or threatened violence to self and/or others.  
Pregnancy  
As there is no medication intervention, pregnancy will not be excluded within the context of this 
study.  
5.0 STUDY SAFETY  
Risks:  
Breach of confidentiality: As with any study, there is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality. To 
maintain participant confidentiality, study records and data will be stored in compliance with the 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. Participant -reported data will be 
collected through REDCap, which is HIPAA -compliant and [ADDRESS_811238] confidentiality, including: We will 1) 
 NIDA CTN -0093 Version 2.0 
 PharmScreen  May. 25, 21  
 
37 
 assign a unique ID number to each patient, instead of patient names  and 2) restrict access to the 
key linking names and ID numbers to key staff and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12758]. Participants will be told 
that agents of the IRB and QA monitors will be allowed to inspect research records related to this 
study, if requested.  
Emotional Di scomfort : The participants may experience some emotional discomfort from 
answering sensitive and/or personal questions. There is the possibility that the participant will feel 
bored. The patient’s ability to respond to study assessments in the privacy of his/her own home 
should help in reducing potential emotional discomfort.  
Benefits :  
Participants may not experience a benefit from participating in this study. Potential benefits include the chance to contribute to a scientific investigation which may benefit other patients like 
themselves in the future. The risk/benefit ratio is favorable and conduct of the research well 
justified.  
6.0 REGULATORY ISSUES 
Reporting of safety concerns to the IRB ad NIDA: The only expected risk to participants is a loss 
of confide ntiality, which will be minimized by [CONTACT_611848]. All breaches 
of confidentiality  will be reported to and reviewed by [CONTACT_611849] (not to occur more than weekly and less than monthly).  
Report ing of IRB action to NIDA : All communications with and actions of the IRB will be kept in a 
regulatory binder specific for this study. Any protocol changes, amendments, or deviations will be submitted to the IRBs and NIDA and the IRB’s actions will then be reported to NIDA. Any other 
IRB actions will be submitted to NIDA.  
Report of changes or amendments to the protocol: All changes and amendments to the protocol 
will be submitted to the IRBs and NIDA. Only after IRB and NIDA approvals are granted will the 
changes and amendments be implemented.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]: Individual study participants will be informed of their right to discontinue study 
participation at any time during the study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_147140] a participant from the study  if 
deemed clinically appropriate. NIDA has the right to discontinue the investigation at any time.            
Disclosure of conflict of interest : The investigators have no conflicts of interest.  
7.0 DATA MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES  
This protocol will utilize a cent ralized REDCap data capture program. This electronic data capture 
system ( REDCap ) will be developed in collaboration by [CONTACT_611850].  Assessments programmed in REDCap will use validation rules, integrity 
checks, and hard stops as needed to ensure that data are as complete and accurate as possible.  
See Protocol section 11.4 for additional details .  
8.0 DATA AND STATISTICS RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE OVN and UNIVERSITY OF 
UTAH  
The OVN and the University Utah  will: 1) develop and apply data management procedures to 
ensure the collection of accurate and good -quality data, 2) eCRFs for the collection of all data 
 NIDA CTN -0093 Version 2.0 
 PharmScreen  May. 25, 21  
 
38 
 required by [CONTACT_1758], 3) develop data dictionaries for each eCRF that will comprehensively define 
each data element, 4) prepare instructions for the use of REDCap  and for the completion of 
eCRFs, 5) conduct ongoing monitoring activities on study data collected from all participating sites, and 6) perform data cleaning activities prior to the final study database lock.  
9.[ADDRESS_811239] research leadership and staff . 
11.0 DATABASE LOCK AND TRANSFER  
At the conclusion of data collection for the study, the OVN and University of Utah will perform final 
data cleaning activities and will “lock” the study database from further modification. The final 
analysis dataset will be transferred to the Lead Investi gator or designee. De- identified versions of 
these datasets will also be provided to the NIDA CCTN -designated parties for posting on 
Datashare, as well as storage and archiving. We will comply with the following policy regarding the preparation and transfer of the study data:  
“Data from CTN trials are  posted [ADDRESS_811240]. All of the data are de-
identified, and only raw data (i.e., no analysis datasets or derived variables) are provided. Data documentation, consisting of all annotated case report forms 
(CRFs), the data dictionary, and de- identification notes, is provided to users to 
assist in data interpretation. Protocol documentation, including a brief study desc ription, the study protocol, and a link to the primary manuscript, is also 
provided, and users are encouraged to consult these documents for insight 
regarding proper interpretation of the data.”

BACKGROUND  
 Identification of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13808] a change in pressure from one 
tissue plane to another. This drop of pressure, called “loss of resistance” (LOR), across a band of 
connective tissue into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13809] a needle -syringe apparatus. The 
operator applies pressure to the p lunger of the syringe until the drop in pressure is identified 
when the plunger collapses. The epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810], a small tube that is inserted in to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13811], is then advanced using the needle as a guide. Confidence in 
locating the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13812].  
 When there is difficulty in advancing the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13813], several man euvers are performed in order to correct the problem. These include: 
injecting saline through the needle to “expand” the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814], advancing the needle tip 1 -2 
mm, inserting a new flexible epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810], inserting a new non -flexible epi[INVESTIGATOR_13815], 
rotating the needle bevel, changing a patient’s posture, pulling the needle back to re -engage the 
ligamentum flavum  and then preforming a second LOR technique, and removing the needle 
entirely and preforming a new placement at the same or different i nterspace (1).  Each time a new 
maneuver is preformed, this is considered a new attempt at threading the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13816] . Not succeeding on threading the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13817] a “failure to thread,” however  these maneuvers are 
performed until adequate labor analgesia is established  in all patients . Establishing labor 
analgesia on the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_13818]. A “more successful” 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13819] a decrease in the time required to thread the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13820] . 
 Difficulty to thread an epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810] i s distinct from  a far more serious complication, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13821] ( 2). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13822]. Per internal data review, there is no statistically significant difference between 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13823] ( 2) and the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13824] 
(9th floor)  of the University of Michigan v on Voitlander Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 Two different epi[INVESTIGATOR_13825], Arrow FlexTip Plus® Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13826] 
(Arrow® International, Cleveland, OH) and Perifix® FX Springwound Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13827] 
(B.Braun Medical Inc., Bethlem, PA) are currently in use on the Labor and Delivery floor (9th 
floor) of the University of Michigan von Voitlander Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Both kits are standard of 
care and are routinely used to place epi[INVESTIGATOR_13828].  
  
OBJECTIVES  
 The a im of the study is to assess if there is a  difference in ability to thread the  epi[INVESTIGATOR_13829] (measured in time to thread)  from two different pain management kits: Arrow® and 
B.Braun®. In order to improve patient care at U of M, if there is a difference in t he time to thread 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13830] (i.e. one epi[INVESTIGATOR_13831]),  we would like to use the kit  with decreased time to thread in the future. We would like to 
make this comparison based on data.  
 Our hypothesis is that there is no difference in the average time required for clinicians to 
thread the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13832] m the Arrow® and B.Braun® pain management kits.  
 The primary outcome is to compare the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13833]® and B.Braun® pain management kits.  
 Secondary objectives of this study are to compare the difference in average time required 
to advance the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810], the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13834], the incidence of unintended dural puncture s, the incidence of 
paresthesia, and the incidence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13835].   
 Our findings may not be generalizable to other facilities due to local practices (presence 
or absence of trainees, training l evel of the residents, obesity of patients, etc.) but data will be 
made publically available. This project is primarily intended to improve patient care at U of M 
via scientific level analysis.  
 
  
METHODS  
Type of Study  
 Comparative effectiveness study via  an open label alternate treatment design with 
randomized scheduling.  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
The Arrow® and B.Braun® epi[INVESTIGATOR_13836].  
All patients requesting or requiring epi[INVESTIGATOR_13837] 9th floor (Labor and Delivery) of the 
University of Michigan von Voigtlander Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   
 
Exclusion Criteria  
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13838] . 
 
Randomization Procedure  
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13839] 9th 
floor who are requesting labor analgesia. Approximately 30 epi[INVESTIGATOR_13840]. These epi[INVESTIGATOR_13841], faculty, and fellows in a sharable and equitable number. No group of individuals are  
specifically targeted.  
 A prospective alternating  intervention  study design with randomized weekly scheduling 
will allow for equal use of the two epi[INVESTIGATOR_13842]. In weeks randomized to Arrow®, only Arrow® 
kits will be available. In weeks randomized to B.Braun®, only B.Braun® epi[INVESTIGATOR_13843]. In order to target a sample size of 240 epi[INVESTIGATOR_13844] (n=120/group), and 
assuming that every week [ADDRESS_13330] -secure computer (www.randomization.com) by [CONTACT_13916]. The two available kits are:  
1) FlexTip Plus® Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13826] (Arrow® International, Cleveland, OH).  
OR 
2) Multi -orifice epi[INVESTIGATOR_13845]: Perifix® FX Springwound Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13846] r Kit (B.Braun 
Medical Inc., Bethlem, PA).   
However, the alternate pain management kit will remain accessible during the study if it is 
deemed necessary for a particular patient.  
 This study design is in consideration of the fact that retrospective analy ses of large 
databases or patient records are subject to unknown biases, thus causation is difficult to assign. 
(3) (4)  
 
Prestudy Data Collection and Training  
 All anesthesiologists’ level of expertise (post -graduate year or training) will be collected 
before starting the study as shown in Table 1. Patients’ demographics will be collected and 
selected  patient data will be recorded by [CONTACT_13917]  (see Table 2). This ensures that there are  no 
confounding factors in the difference in perceived ability to advance the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13847] (i.e. morbid obesity or presence of known spi[INVESTIGATOR_13848]) . This will be done in a 
coded  manner, using a numerical code to be assigned to each individual study case. The master 
file will be kept in a locked fil ing cabinet in the principal investigator’s office. All data will be 
analyzed in a coded fashion. Attention to strict confidentiality will be maintained; no attempts 
will be made to identify individual study subjects.  
 
Equipment, Technique and Study Data C ollection  
 There will be two epi[INVESTIGATOR_13849]:  
1) The FlexTip Plus® Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13850] a 17 Gauge Tuohy 
needle, 8.9 cm long and a single open end hole FlexTip Plus® 19 Gauge flexible 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810] (Arrow Interna tional, Cleveland, OH).  
2) The Perifix® FX Springwound Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13851] a 17 Gauge 
Espocan® Tuohy needle, 8.9 cm long and a closed tip multiport Perifix® FX 
Springwound 19 Gauge flexible epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810] (B.Braun Medical Inc., 
Bethlem, PA).     
Both the Arrow® and B.Braun® epi[INVESTIGATOR_13852].  
 All patients will be in a sitting position. After standard sterile prep and drape, a wheal of 
local anesthetic will be applied to the interspace.  An epi [INVESTIGATOR_13853] . A syringe with saline will be attached to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13854] a drop in syringe 
pressure will be noticed  (LOR ).  
 Each time a skin wheal of local anesthetic is injected in patients’ lumbar area, this will be 
counted as one epi[INVESTIGATOR_13855]. In addition, once loss of resistance has been established, if the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13856], redirected and re -advan ced in order to get loss of resistance again 
because the clinician is not able to advance the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810], this will be considered as an 
additional epi[INVESTIGATOR_13855].  
 Once, the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13857], the clinician will app ly 
negative pressure to the catheter through a syringe in order to rule out blood or cerebro -spi[INVESTIGATOR_13858] (CSF) aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. If aspi[INVESTIGATOR_13859], the patient will be given our 
standard medications consisting of 2 ml Lidocaine 1.5% wit h epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1:200,[ADDRESS_13331] loading b olus of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.125% with fentanyl 3 mcg/ml will be 
administered in three fractionated doses of 5 ml each, through an epi[INVESTIGATOR_13860]. All patients will 
be then connected to a programmed intermittent epi[INVESTIGATOR_13861]: 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.125% with fentanyl 3 mcg/ml, programmed intermittent bolus 6 ml every 45 
minutes. Patient’s demand bolus 6 ml every 15 minutes, without baseline infusion.   
 If the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13862], one o r 
more of the following maneuvers will be adopted: additional saline will be administered through 
the Tuohy needle; alternatively, a new flexible epi[INVESTIGATOR_13863]; if the catheter 
advances following one of these afore -mentioned maneuvers, the thread will be considered 
successful with minor adjustments. Conversely, if the needle is rotated, re -angled, redrawn and 
re-advanced or advanced blindly, these will all be considered as major needle manipu lations and 
recorded as failure of that attemp t to advance the  epi[INVESTIGATOR_13864]. Further attempts are made 
until proper epi[INVESTIGATOR_13865].  
 Establishment of successful labor analgesia will be defined at a verbal analogue score 
equal to or less than [ADDRESS_13332] not  requested. Currently, this written 
consent  to an epi[INVESTIGATOR_13866]’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13867] a consent  to have an epi[INVESTIGATOR_13868]® or 
B.Braun® pain management kit , depending on availability .  
 By [CONTACT_13918], this would not be a significant deviation from the 
provider’s choice of pain management kits. The pain management kit available to place an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13869] a given time is subject to different influences that do not make it much different from 
random.  Most of the time, the provider uses whatever currently available is in the closet, whether 
the Arrow or BBraun kit.  
 There are logistical difficulties of obtaining informed consent from this vulnerable 
population (pregnant women in all stages of labor) : (5)  
(1) Patients in labor (particularly the later stages of labor) are temporarily incapacitated 
and unable to give true informed consent.  
(2) Placing an epi[INVESTIGATOR_13870] (particularly the later stages of labor) occurs under 
time constraints where patient com fort is paramount to any research interests. We 
want to prevent any time delays in the anesthesiologist’s administration of the 
requested epi[INVESTIGATOR_13871].  
(3) Approaching laboring patients and requesting that they participate in a research study 
has the pot ential to incur significant distress in this patient p opulation, especially as 
many are temporarily incapacitated due to labor pain.  
We request a waiver of consent only as we feel that all patients  will have received an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13872] , and 
that this study does not endanger patient safety.  Furthermore, should the provider feel that 
participating in this study is not in a patient’s best interest, the provider can proc eed using 
whatever pain management kit they feel is best.  
 We also want to a void bias. Recruitment sampling of patients in only the early stages of 
labor (rather than all stages of labor) would increase the risk of bias in the study . By [CONTACT_13919] p atients who request an epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873], our sample would be an ideal sample since women 
who want to get any form of neuraxial analg esia or anesthesia often decide  when they are 
experiencing pain during labor. (6) As labor advances and the laboring parturient expe riences 
more pain, it becomes more difficult to p lace an epi[INVESTIGATOR_13874]:  
- find it  difficult to sit in the ideal posi tion for threading an epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]  
- find it difficult to remain still for the time required to place the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13875], all which necessarily involve threading an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13876].  
 
Study Size  
In order to determine the study  size, we looked at 114 consecutive epi[INVESTIGATOR_13877]® Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13878]. We found that in 11% (n=12) of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13879], the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13880] f irst attempt. In a separate quality assurance check we retrospectively reviewed 100 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13881] 1% (n=1) of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13879], the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13882].  A sample -size analysis for the primary outc ome shows that 107 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13883] a power of 80% to detect a difference in proportion 
between the two techniques of 0.10 at the 0.05 level. Considering an attrition of 10 -20% for 
follow -up and data missing, a total number of 24 0 epi[INVESTIGATOR_13884].  Power 
calculations were computed using PASS 14.  
 
Statistical Analysis  
Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The 
primary outcome will be the success rate of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13885], 
which will be compared by [CONTACT_13920] a chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.  
The secondary outcomes will be analyzed as follows: the difference in number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13886] e Mann -Whitney test; the difference in time to perform the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13887]’s 
skin to the end of the catheter thread will be compared using the Student’s t -test; the difference  
in the incidence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13888] -Square or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate; the difference in 
incidence of unintended dural puncture, paresthesia, and intrava scular cannulations will be 
compared using the chi -square or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. In addition, the difference in 
unsatisfactory labor analgesia with Arrow® and B.Braun® kits will be compared through the chi -
square or Fisher’s exact test, as  appropriate,  by [CONTACT_13921] a verbal analogue pain score equal or less than 10 (scale 0 to 100) at 30 
minutes following epi[INVESTIGATOR_13889]. A p -value of 0.05 throughout will be 
considered s tatistically significant.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  
 
Minimizing the Risk for Subjects  
 This project is a comparison of standardized epi[INVESTIGATOR_13890]. There is no hypothesized difference in the ability to thread the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13891]. The research involves no risk to the patient  subject 
beyond risk inherent to epi[INVESTIGATOR_13892].  
 Waiver of informed consent will not affect the rights, welfare, or pain management of the 
subject, given that in either scenario, they will receive a standard of care epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873].   
 No identifiable inform ation will be collected and retained about the subjects after 
completion of the patient’s vaginal or cesarean delivery. All data will be recorded using a 
numerical code to be assigned to each individual study case. The master file will be kept in a 
locked filing cabinet in the pr incipal investigator’s office. All data will be analyzed in a coded 
fashion. Attention to strict confidentiality will be maintained; no attempts will be made to 
identify individual study subjects.  
 
Potential Risks of Participation  
The risk of participation is the same as the risks of receiving an epi[INVESTIGATOR_13893]. This study design includes clinical procedures already 
being performed, with the risks the same as standard epi[INVESTIGATOR_13894]. The overall goal for both study groups 
remains the same: adequate and timely management of labor pain.  
For placement of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13895], risks include:  
- Inadequate  pain control; likely , but it is not serious as it can be managed with 
additional pain control interventions  
- Persistent headache; infrequent , but it could be more serious and require follow 
up with anesthesiologist  
- Infection; rare, and is serious, requ iring additional care by [CONTACT_13922]  
- Temporary hip/leg discomfort; likely , but can be managed with additional pain 
control interventions and should go away on its own  
- Low blood pressure; common , but can be treated with additional interventions  
- Decreas e in the baby's heart rate; infrequent , but it could be serious and require 
additional interventions  
To minimize any risks, the research team will place epi[INVESTIGATOR_13896]:  
- Ask patients and monitor their p ain control and clinical status, performing other 
interventions if needed  
- Use aseptic technique  
Additionally, there may be a loss to confidentiality and privacy. See Minimizing the Risk 
for Subjects for how the study team will minimize these risks.  
As wi th any procedure, there may be additional risks that are unknown or unexpected but 
rare. 
 
Equitable Selection of Subjects  
All patients receiving epi[INVESTIGATOR_13897]. There are no 
patient factors that would be grounds for exclus ion. No groups of persons based on gender, race, 
or any other distinction will be specifically targeted or excluded. Both epi[INVESTIGATOR_13898], thus there is no additional risk incurred due to participation in the study.  
 
Costs  
No add itional cost will be incurred for the study.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
There are no plans for an independent data and safety monitoring board for this study. 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_13899] -investigators will review analysis of all source data for each 
study subject when approximately half (n=120) of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13900]. The 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_5773] -investigator will determine whether the research should be 
altered or stopped on an ongoing basis.  
 
Adverse Event Reporti ng 
 The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_13901]’s guidelines.   
 
Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
 The accuracy and completeness of all documents will be monitored on an on -going , 
weekly basis by [CONTACT_13923] -investigator.  All data will be collected at the time of each 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13892], analyzed for completeness, and filed.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -
investigators will follow the validity and integrity of the da ta and adherence to the IRB approved 
protocol.

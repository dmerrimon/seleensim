RESOLU TE Onyx 2.[ADDRESS_13197] been enrolled in this subset.  Subjects 
may receive treatment in up to two lesions, if the lesion s are located in separate target vessels.  
Core size lesions should be treated with the currently approved Resolute Integrity stent.   
The trial will be conducted at a maximum of 25 investigational sites within the [LOCATION_002] 
(US) and Japan.  Sites are allowed to enroll a maximum of [ADDRESS_13198] is three years.  
1.6.1  Key Inclusion Criteria 
• Subject has clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease.  For single vessel disease: stable 
or unstable angina alone is sufficient.  For multi -vessel treatment: a positive functional 
study or FFR to demonstrate functional need in 2.0 mm small vessel.  
• Subject has either a single target  lesion suitable for treatment with a Resolute Onyx

Version 5 
March  26, 2015  Page 8 of 76 • Angiography should be performed for any post -procedure clinical event (e.g., MI) to 
determine if the event is attributable to the target vessel or a non -target vessel. The reason 
for any repeat angiography (either clinically driven or non -clinically driven) must be 
documented on the CRF.  
Revascularization should only be conducted when ischemic symptoms are found by [CONTACT_13725]. 
1.8 Statistical Methods 
The primary safety endpoint of Target Lesion Failure (TLF) at [ADDRESS_13203] -procedure will be 
compared to a performance goal derived from outcomes of other Drug Eluting Stents (DES). The 
TLF performance goal of 19% at 12 -months is based on US approved 2.25 mm drug -eluting 
stent data.  The RESOLUTE ONYX 2.0 mm Study  design with 100 subjects yields more than 
80% power, assuming a one -sided type 0.05 level of significance and 10% loss to follow up.

RESOLU TE Onyx 2.[ADDRESS_13204] with tissues or body fluids, can be found in the ‘Inst ructions for Use’ 
(IFU).  
The Medtronic Resolute Onyx Zotarolimus -Eluting Coronary Stent System is comprised of four 
main components:  
1. Stent Platform-  Onyx Bare Metal Stent  
2. Stent Delivery System -  Resolute Onyx Delivery System RX  
3. Zotarolimus – Anti -prolife rative drug component/active pharmaceutical ingredient  
4. Polymer – BioLinx™ Polymer System  
2.2.1  Stent  
The Resolute Onyx stent is similar in design to the Resolute Integrity stent and utilizes the same 
continuous sinusoid manufacturing technology.

Material 
Composition  Cobalt  Alloy -shell 
Platinum/Iridium - core 
Appearance  
 
The stent is manufactured from a composite wire which has an outer shell and an inner core. The 
outer shell which is in contact [CONTACT_13726]. The inner core material is a Platinum/Iridium alloy intended to 
enhance radiopacity. The stent design has been modified slightly to provide a lower crossing 
profile and thus, improved deliverability over predicate products. 
2.2.2  Stent Delivery System 
The Medtronic Resolute Onyx Zotarolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System consists of a balloon-
expandable intracoronary drug- eluting stent pre -mounted on a Rapid Exchange (RX) stent 
delivery system. The delivery system has two radiopaque markers to aid in the placement of the 
stent during fluoroscopy and is compatible with 0.014 inch (0.36 mm) guidewires and 5 Fr (1.42 
mm/0.056 in) minimum inner diameter guide catheters. The Resolute Onyx RX delivery system 
(Figure 1) has an effective length of 140 cm.  
 
 
Figure 1: Resolute Onyx RX Delivery System (with Stent)  
 
2.2.3  Zotarolimus Drug Substance 
The therapeutic agent utilized in the Medtronic Resolute Onyx Zotarolimus -Eluting Coronary 
Stent System is zotarolimus, a licensed proprietary chemical entity from Abbott Laboratories, 
and is also identical to the predicate Endeavor Resolute and Resolute Integrity products. 
Zotarolimus is a tetrazole -containing macrocyclic immunosuppressant.  The suggested 
mechanism of action of zotarolimus is to bind to FKBP12, leading to the formation of a trimeric 
complex with the protein kinase mTOR (mammalian target of  rapamycin), inhibiting its activity.  
Inhibition of mTOR results in the inhibition of protein phosphorylation events associated with 
translation of mRNA and cell cycle control.  The zotarolimus drug in the Resolute Onyx Stent is 
intended to reduce the incidence of restenosis in coronary interventions.  The Resolute Onyx

Version 5 
March  26, 2015  Page 11 of 76 Stent has a nominal drug dose of approximately 1.6µg zotarolimus per mm2 of the stent surface, 
which is identical to that of Endeavor Resolute and Resolute Integrity.  
2.2.4  BioLinx Polymer  
The Resolute Onyx stent is comprised of a bare metal stent with a Parylene C primer coat and a 
coating that consists of a blend of the drug zotarolimus and the BioLinx polymer system. 
BioLinx is a blend of the Medtronic proprietary components C10 (a copolymer of  butyl 
methracrylate and vinyl acetate) and C19 (a terpolymer containing hexyl methacrylate, vinyl 
pyrrolidinone, and vinyl acetate), and PVP (polyvinyl pyrrolidone). The Resolute Onyx stent 
uses the same drug coating formulation, drug dose density and spr ay processing steps as the 
predicate Resolute Integrity product.  
2.3  Intended Use  
The Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm Stent System is intended to improve coronary luminal diameters in 
subjects with symptomatic ischemic heart disease due to de novo stenotic lesion(s) co ntained 
within a vessel diameter that allows the use of a 2.0 mm diameter stent.

 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN   
RESOLU TE Onyx 2.[ADDRESS_13208] 20 subjects will be enrolled to receive an angiographic 
follow up at 13 months .   
Subjects may receive treatment of one or two lesions, one lesion per target vessel, for a 
maximum of two target vessels.  Only one lesion may be treated in a single target vessel. All 
treatment with the study stents is to be performed during a single index procedure. Refer to 
Table 2 for additional stenting criteria.  
In the event of one lesion to be treated with a 2.0 mm study stent and another lesion to be treate d 
with a core size (2.25 mm -  4.0 mm) Resolute Integrity stent, the subject should be treated first 
with the core -sized stent. If the treatment of the first lesion fails or if the subject becomes 
unstable before  a 2.0 mm study stent is attempted (stent introduced into guide catheter), the 
subject will not be enrolled, will not be followed, and will not be included in the primary 
analysis of this trial.  Another subject should be enrolled to replace this subject for the primary 
analysis. If the treatment with the 2.0 mm study stent is attempted (stent introduced into guide 
catheter) but not implanted, the subject will be considered part of the Intention- to-Treat 
population (ITT) and will be followed through the [ADDRESS_13209] (IRB) 
approved informed consent and subsequently fulfill all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria 
will be enrolled in the trial.

5.1.1  Screening  
All patients evaluated for potential PCI of the coronary arteries should be screened for trial 
eligibility.  A qualified member of the investigational site’s research team will review the 
patient’s medical history and screen for trial eligibility. A screening failure c ase report form 
(eCRF) will be provided to the site to maintain a record of each patient screened by [CONTACT_13731](s) for trial exclusion.   
5.1.[ADDRESS_13229] 
(IRB) appr oved Subject Informed Consent Form. During the consent discussion the investigator 
or his/her designee (only in geographies where allowed) must fully inform the subject of all 
pertinent aspects of the trial. If a subject is illiterate, an impartial witness  must be present during 
the entire informed consent discussion. All items discussed in the Subject Informed Consent 
Form must be explained. The language used shall be as non- technical as possible and must be 
understandable to the subject and the impartial witness, where applicable. Consent forms should 
be made available in subject’s native language.   
Neither the investigator, nor the investigation site staff shall coerce or unduly influence a subject 
to participate or to continue to participate in the clin ical trial. The informed consent process shall 
not appear to waive the subject’s rights. 
When the subject decides to participate in the clinical trial, the site’s current IRB and Medtronic 
approved Informed Consent Form must be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_423] (or their 
legally authorized representative) and investigator/or designee. If applicable, the witness shall 
also sign and personally date the consent form to attest that the information in the Subject 
Informed Consent Form was accurately exp lained and clearly understood by [CONTACT_423], and that 
informed consent was freely given.

informed consent proces s as described above needs to be repeated.  
5.2 Clinical Laboratory Procedures & Tests  
The clinical procedures that must be performed and laboratory tests that must be drawn for all 
subjects prior to the stenting procedure are listed below and in Table 3. The results for the 
procedures and tests required to assess subject eligibility for enrollment (white blood cell (WBC) 
count, platelet count, creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), Troponin, ECG and pregnancy test (if 
applicable)) must be obtained and reviewed prior to enrollment.

5.3 Medication  
All subjects will receive aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (a minimum of 75 mg daily, within 24 hours prior to the 
procedure) and a market approved antiplatelet loading dose within [ADDRESS_13235] procedure (within [ADDRESS_13236] catheter removal). If the 
subject has taken at least 3 doses of antiplatelet/thienopyridine within [ADDRESS_13237] 
of care.  A GP IIb/IIIa receptor blocker may be administered at the Investigator’s discretion.  
The use of low molecular weight heparin (e.g., Enoxaparin) is not allowed during the index 
procedure for this trial and/or at a ther apeutic dose (1 mg/kg) within 24 hours prior to 
procedure.  
Following the procedure, subjects will receive a minimum of 75 mg of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_13705] a market approved thienopyridine daily for a minimum of 6 months in all subjects, and up to 
12 months in subjects who are not at high risk of bleeding, per the ACC/AHA/SCAI 
guidelines49. 
A market approved antiplatelet (clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], prasugrel, ticagrelor, ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325], etc) should be 
administered to the subject.  
It is important that the subject is compliant with the post- procedural antiplatelet 
recommendations. Premature discontinuation of prescribed antiplatelet medication could result in 
a higher risk of throm bosis, myocardial infarction or death. Prior to enrollment in this trial, if a 
surgical or dental procedure is anticipated that would require early discontinuation of antiplatelet 
therapy, the Investigator and subject should carefully consider whether part icipation in the trial 
and the associated recommended antiplatelet therapy is the appropriate choice. Following 
enrollment, should a surgical or dental procedure be recommended, the risks and benefits of the 
procedure should be weighed against the possible  risk associated with interruption or premature 
discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy.  
Subjects who require interruption or premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy secondary 
to significant active bleeding, should be monitored carefully for cardiac events and, once 
stabilized, have their antiplatelet therapy restarted as soon as possible, per the discretion of their 
treating physicians.  
All antiplatelet/anticoagulant, proton pump inhibitors, beta blockers, ace inhibitors, cox 2 
inhibitors, glycoprotein inhibitors, statins, diabetic medications will be documented on the CRF 
from 24 hours pre -procedure through the 12 month follow -up assessment.  Use of 
antiplatelet/anti- coagulant therapy will be documented throughout the 3 year follow -up period, 
including any interruptions (temporary stop and restart). 
Table 4 summarizes the trial required regimen for antiplatelet medication for subjects enrolled in 
the trial.

3. Following an intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin, baseline ang iography of the 
vessel(s) will be performed in at least 2 near -orthogonal views that show the target 
lesion(s) free of foreshortening or vessel overlap, using a 6 French or larger guide 
catheter (see Appendix 7).  
5.4.2  Target Lesion Pre-Treatment  
The target lesion(s) must be pre -dilated with standard percutaneous transluminal balloon 
angioplasty. In accordance with the Instructions for Use, this trial does not allow for dire ct 
stenting of the target vessel(s).  
Attention must be paid to the pre -dilatation technique in order to avoid balloon injury to any 
segment of the vessel that will not be entirely covered by [CONTACT_13732] (“geographical miss”).  
Pre-dilatation must be performed  using a balloon with the following three characteristics:  
1. For lesions treated with a 2.[ADDRESS_13245] be ≤ 1.75 mm 
in diameter.  
2. A length matching or shorter than the lesion length to be dilated (to avoid dilatation of the 
vessel wall adjacent to the stent)  
3. A length shorter than the stent to be implanted 
The use of other therapy (e.g., cutting balloons, atherectomy, laser, thrombectomy, etc.) is not 
allowed.  
5.4.[ADDRESS_13246] been met: 
1. The signed informed consent has been obtained  
2. The study stent (Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm stent) is introduced into the guide catheter  
In cases where the procedure is stopped prior to the study stent being delivered into the guide 
catheter (e.g., subject becomes unstable, power outage, equipment issues, etc.), the subject will 
not be considered enrolled and will be replaced.  
Subject enrollm ent and stent use information will be submitted to the sponsor on the eCRF 
within 1 working day or as soon as source documents are available.  
5.4.4  Stenting Procedure  
The aim is to maintain a homogeneous treatment strategy, and therefore all lesions should be 
treated with Resolute Integrity (2.25 mm -  4.0 mm) or Resolute Onyx (2.0 mm) stents. Potential 
interaction with other drug -eluting stents or coated stents has not been evaluated, and should be 
avoided.    
 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN   
RESOLU TE Onyx 2.[ADDRESS_13247] be ≥ [ADDRESS_13248] injections. Deployment of the stent should then be 
performed in accordance with the IFU.  
Available Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm stent sizes are listed in Table 5.

Post-dilatation may be performed at the Investigator’s discretion with appropriately sized (length 
and diameter) non- compliant balloon to assure that the stent is in full contact [CONTACT_13733].  Do not use the stent delivery balloon for post -dilatat ion. 
For subjects with planned treatment of two lesions, the first lesion must be treated successfully 
and the subject must be clinically stable before treatment of the second lesion is attempted.     
Successful treatment of the first lesion is defined as: 
• <10% residual diameter stenosis result is achieved (visual assessment)  
• TIMI [ADDRESS_13249] treatment  
• No evidence of dissection (NHLBI Type C, D, E or F), thrombus or distal embolization at 
the first study lesion site post- treatment.  
Prior to attemp ted treatment of the second study lesion, subjects must be clinically stable without 
angina or ECG changes consistent with coronary ischemia.  If the subject is not clinically stable, 
or shows signs or symptoms of possible coronary ischemia following treat ment of the first study 
lesion, treatment of the second lesion should be deferred, if possible.  Subsequent treatment of 
the second lesion should be with a study stent if performed during the trial index procedure.  If 
the second lesion requires treatment after the index procedure, a non -study stent must be used. 
For subjects with planned treatment of only one lesion but during the procedure a second lesion 
meeting trial criteria is identified, a Resolute Integrity (2.25 mm -  4.0 mm) or Resolute Onyx 
(2.0 m m) stent should be used if stenting is needed and treatment cannot be deferred.  If the 
lesion does not meet trial criteria, a non -study stent should be used if stenting is needed and the 
lesion will be considered a non- target lesion for purposes of analys is.   
 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN   
RESOLU TE Onyx 2.[ADDRESS_13250] in the trial experiences a major dissection or an occlusive complication  (as evidenced 
by [CONTACT_13734], chest pain, or ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes which 
do not respond to standard rescue techniques), bailout procedures may be performed.  For these 
events occurring during the study procedure, additi onal stenting with Resolute Integrity (2.25 
mm -  4.0 mm) or Resolute Onyx (2.0 mm) stents may be employed as a bailout treatment.  
In this trial, the target lesion(s) is/are to be selected with the intent to cover each lesion with a 
single stent.  If incomplete coverage occurs during the procedure, additional stenting with study 
stents may be employed to provide complete coverage.  
It is recommended to overlap the Resolute Onyx stents 1- [ADDRESS_13251] enrollment, study stent(s) that enter the guide catheter and fail to be implanted 
at the intended location are considered treatment failures and will be recorded in the eCRF.  In 
the event of a failure to implant at least one study stent, the  Investigator may choose to treat the 
target lesion(s) with any approved stent.  Treatment failures will be followed -up for safety 
purposes through 12- months and will be included in the intent -to-treat (ITT) population.  The 
subject will undergo the follow -up assessments listed in Section 5.6 through the 12 month 
follow -up assessment.    
Note:  Damaged or failed Resolute Onyx Stent Systems (including ancillary 
devices) must be returned to the Medtronic Product Experience Management 
Department per instructions pr ovided by [CONTACT_13735].  
5.4.[ADDRESS_13252] be administered 
and final angiography of the vessel(s) performed in the same two near -orthogonal views that 
were taken at baseline, showing the target lesion(s) free of foreshorten ing or vessel overlap, 
using a 6 French or larger guiding catheter (see Appendix 7).  
The end of the procedure is defined as the time the guide catheter is removed from the subject. If 
the subject is returned to the procedure room and a guiding catheter is reinserted and a dilatation 
is performed, this should be considered a repeat intervention.  
All adverse events that occur during the procedure must be recorded on t he eCRF, including but 
not limited to dissections, acute closures, etc.  
 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN   
RESOLU TE Onyx 2.[ADDRESS_13253] Management 
Immediately after the procedure the following will be performed:  
1. Heparin or bivalirudin (as market approved by [CONTACT_13736]) should be discontinued 
2. Vascular sheaths should be removed according to standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13707]  
3. Approved vascular closure devices may be used at the discretion of the Investigator in 
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions  
5.5.2  Clinical and Laboratory Procedures  
The following clinical and laboratory procedures will be performed:  
1. Qualified study staff at the investigational site will assess the subject’s clinical status 
(including angina) prior to discharge and record any adverse events.  
2. Qualified study staf f at the investigational site will review the follow -up requirements 
with the subject to help ensure compliance with the follow -up schedule. Telephone 
numbers and/or e -mail address should be obtained from the subject to ensure the ability 
to contact [CONTACT_13737] -up times. These phone numbers should 
include all home numbers, work numbers and primary physician numbers. A phone 
number of a relative or friend should also be requested. 
5.5.3  Cardiac Biomarkers  
Creatine Kinase (CK) enzyme and tropo nin will be measured post -procedure following removal 
of the last catheter as follows:  
• 1st  draw: >3 hours, <[ADDRESS_13254] procedure  
• 2nd  draw: >[ADDRESS_13255] draw, <[ADDRESS_13256] procedure  
Cardiac enzymes/biomarkers will be collected if they are relat ed to a trial primary or secondary 
endpoint, including but not limited to death, (suspected) MI or stent thrombosis.  These may 
include creatine kinase (CK) enzyme, creatine kinase myocardial -band (CK -MB) isoenzyme and 
troponin. 
If it is not standard hospi [INVESTIGATOR_13703], CK -MB values are sufficient.  All 
subjects should have Troponin values.

A trial subject has the right to  discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of 
benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. A withdrawn subject will be treated according 
to standard of medical care and will not be replaced. Subjects will be included in the anal yses up 
to the time that consent was withdrawn.  
If a subject decides to withdraw from the trial, the investigator will document the reason for 
withdrawal and indicate any rationale for the withdrawal from the trial in the subject’s file. 
Subjects may decid e to withdraw from study follow up visits/contacts but consent to continue to 
allow data collection from their medical records.  
Subject Lost -To-Follow -Up (LTFU) should be avoided as much as possible and investigators are 
urged to do their utmost best to ma intain subject follow -up compliance. Contact[CONTACT_13742]’s 
general practitioner or referring cardiologist should be considered in case the subject cannot be 
reached in order to obtain information about the subject’s health status and documented in the 
subject’s file. Continuous attempts throughout the three year follow -up period should be made to 
contact [CONTACT_423], the subject’s family or referring physician before documenting a subject

The primary safety endpoint of Target Lesion Failure (TLF) at [ADDRESS_13270]-procedure will be 
compared to a performance goal derived from outcomes of other Drug Eluting Stents (DES).  
Since a 2.[ADDRESS_13271]-procedure with different 2.25 mm DES stents are  selected from literature. The weighted 
average of TLF rate in those stents is 7.9%. 
It is expected that a 2.[ADDRESS_13272] a slightly higher TLF rate because smaller lesions 
will be treated.  Therefore, the expected TLF rate for a 2.0 mm DES is 9.4% .   
The performance goal is set at 19%, which is approximately 100% above the expected TLF rate 
for DES 2.0 mm stent subjects.  
7.2 Sample Size Justification 
If the 12- month TLF rate of the Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm stent is shown to be significantly less 
than 19%, then the trial will be considered to have met its primary objective. In other words, the 
assessment of TLF is a testing with the following null and alternative hypotheses:  
H0: π ≥ 19% vs. H 1: π < 19%,  
where π is the true Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm stent 12- month TLF rate.   
The assessment of the null hypothesis will be carried out at the one -sided 0.05 level of 
significance.  Rejection of the null hypothesis indicates the Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm stent 12-
month TLF rate is significantly below 19%.  
Accounting for a  10% clinical loss to follow -up and one -sided 0.05 level of significance, a 
sample size of 100 subjects yields more than 80% power to reject the above null hypothesis in 
favor of the alternative, assuming the true Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm stent 12- month TLF ra te is 
9.4%.

8.1  Adverse Events  
8.1.1  Definition  
An adverse event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or 
untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other 
persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.  
Note 1.  This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device or 
the comparator. 
Note 2.  This definition includes events related to the procedures involved..  
Note 3.  For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to 
investigational medical devices.  
A device related  AE is defined as any AE for which a causal relationship between the event and 
the device implantation procedure, the presence of the device, or the performance of the device 
system, is at least a reasonable possibility (i.e., the relationship cannot be excluded). 
A procedure related  AE is as any AE associated with the initial placement of the device or any 
necessary secondary interventions. This includes morbidity associated with either anesthesia or 
the procedure. This also includes inappropriate subject selection and errors attributed to 
inappropriate operator techniques, measurements, or judgment.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_13275]’s medical record and reported on the adverse event 
eCRF within [ADDRESS_13276] of AEs that may be associated with the use of the study device and/or the interventional 
procedure is provided in the IFU. Each AE must be evaluated to determine if the event meets the 
definition of serious adverse event (see Sectio n 35). Event, date of onset, duration, and 
relationship to device will be recorded on the eCRF. AEs will be followed until the e vent has 
resolved (in the case of permanent impairment, the event will be followed until it stabilizes and 
the overall clinical outcome has been ascertained). The AEs must also be reported to the IRB per 
the institution’s policy for reporting AEs.  
8.2  Seriou s Adverse Events  
8.2.1  Definition  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse medical occurrence that:  
a) led to death  
OR 
b) led to a serious deterioration in the health of a subject that either resulted in  
1) a life -threatening illness or injury, or

3) in-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or  
4) medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to body structure or a body function 
OR 
c) led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.   
Note: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing or a procedure required by [CONTACT_13746], is not considered a serious 
adverse event.  
The secondary endpoint, MACE (death, Q - or non -Q-wave myocardial infarction, emergent 
CABG or clinically -driven repeat target lesion revascularization by [CONTACT_13747]), is considered "serious" by [CONTACT_13748].  
All serious adverse events (SAE) will be reported for the duration of the trial.   
8.2.[ADDRESS_13277] also be reported to the IRB 
per the institution’s policy for reporting SAEs.  
8.[ADDRESS_13278] (UA DE) is defined as any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence i n the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to 
the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
8.3.2  Reporting Requirements  
All SAEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_13749] (MCO 
Safety) to determine if the SAE meets the definition of a UADE. As outlined in Section 8.2, the 
guideline for reporting all SAEs to Medtronic is within [ADDRESS_13279] report device- related deaths, serious injuries and malfunctions to the FDA 
and other geography authority whenever they become aware of information that reasonably

Definition  
ACUTE CLOSURE  
Acute Closure:  Defined as the occurrence of new (during the procedure) severely 
reduced flow (TIMI grade 0 -1) within the target vessel that persisted 
and required rescue by [CONTACT_13774], or resulted in 
myocardial infarction or death. Abrupt closure requires proven 
association with a mechanical dissection of the treatment site or 
instrumented vessel, coronary thrombus, or severe spasm. Abrupt 
closure does not mean “no reflow” (due to microvascular flow 
limitation), in which the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13714]. Abrupt closure also does not mean transient closure with reduced 
flow in which the index treatment application does reverse the closure.  
Subacute Clo sure:  Defined as abrupt closure that occurred after the procedure is 
completed (and the subject left the catheterization laboratory) and 
before the 30 -day follow -up evaluation.  
Threatened Acute 
Closure:  Defined as a grade B dissection and ≥ 50% diameter s tenosis or any 
dissection of grade C or higher.  
ACUTE SUCCESS  
All acute success data will be reported per Medtronic historical protocol definitions and current 
definitions listed below.  
Device Success:  
Medtronic historical definition: attainment of < 50 % residual stenosis of the target lesion using 
only the study device.  
Current definition: the attainment of < 30% residual stenosis by [CONTACT_13775] (or < 20% by [CONTACT_13776]) AND TIMI flow 3 after the procedure, using the study device only. These 
measurements will be made by [CONTACT_13777]. If the core 
laboratory is unable to assess the % residual stenosis, the investigator's assessment as recorded in 
the CRF will be used for the statistical analysis.  
Lesion Success:  
Medtronic his torical definition: attainment of < 50 % residual stenosis of the target lesion using 
any percutaneous method.  
Current definition: the attainment of < 30% residual stenosis by [CONTACT_13775] (or < 20% by [CONTACT_13776]) AND TIMI flow 3 after the procedure, using a ny percutaneous method. These 
measurements will be made by [CONTACT_13777]. If the core 
laboratory is unable to assess the % residual stenosis, the investigator's assessment as recorded in

ADVERSE EVENT  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, 
whether or not related to the investigational medical device.  
  
Note 1.  This definition includes events related to the inve stigational medical device or the 
comparator.  
Note 2.  This definition includes events related to the procedures involved..  
Note 3.  For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to investigational 
medical devices.  
 
ANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENT  
Any undesirable experience (sign, symptom, illness, abnormal laboratory value, or other medical 
event) occurring to a subject, whether or not considered related to the investigational product(s) 
or drug regimen prescribed as part of the clinical protocol, predefined in the clinical protocol 
and/or IFU, that is identified or worsens during a clinical study.  
BINARY ANGIOGRAPHIC RESTENOSIS  
Defined as ≥ 50% in- stent diameter stenosis at the follow -up angiogram. If an in- stent 
measurement is not available, the in- lesion diameter will be used.  
CALCIFICATION 
Calcification is defined as readily apparent radiopacities within the vascular wall at the site of the 
stenosis and is classified as none/mild, moderate (radiopacities noted only during the cardiac 
cycle before contrast injection), and severe (radiopacities noted without cardiac motion before 
contrast injection generally compromising both sides of the arterial lumen).

All deaths are considered cardiac unless an unequivocal non- cardiac cause can be established. 
Specifically, any unexpected death even in subjects with coexisting potentially fatal non- cardiac 
disease (e.g. cancer, infection) should be classified as cardiac.  
Cardiac death  Any death  due to imm ediate cardiac cause (e.g. MI, low-output  failure,  
fatal arrhyth mia). Unwitnessed  death  and death  of unknown cause  will 
be classified  as cardiac death.  This  includes all procedure  related  
deaths  including  those  related  to conco mitant treat ment. 
Vascular death  Death due to cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary embolism, ruptured 
aortic aneurysm, dissecting aneurysm, or other vascular cause.  
Non-cardiovascular 
death  Any death not covered by [CONTACT_13780], including death due to 
infection, sepsis, pulmonary causes, accident, suicide or trauma.  
DEVICE RELATED ADVERSE EVENT  
A device related adverse event is defined as any adverse event for which a causal relationship 
between the event and the device implantation procedure, the presence of the device, or the 
performance of the device system, is at least a reasonable possibility (i.e., the relationship cannot 
be excluded).

Attainment of < 50 % residual stenosis of the target lesion using only the study device.  
DEVICE SPECIFIC PROCEDURE SUCCESS  
Device success and no in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13715].  
DIABETES MELLITUS11 
Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by [CONTACT_13781], insulin action or both. 
Three ways to diagnose diabetes are possible, and each must be confirmed, on a subsequent day, 
by [CONTACT_13782]:  
1. Symptoms of diabetes plus casual plasma glucose concentration > 200 mg/dl (11.1 
mmol/l). Casual is defined as any time of day without re gard to time since last meal. The 
classic symptoms of diabetes include polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss.  
2. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l). Fasting is defined as no caloric 
intake for at least [ADDRESS_13309] -load glucose (PG) > 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) during an oral glucose 
tolerance test (OGTT). The test should be performed as described by [CONTACT_13783] 2.0 mm  Clinical Study

not recommended for routine clinical use.  
Medtronic working definition of diabetes mellitus: For the purposes of this trial a subject is 
considered to have a history of diabetes mellitus if he/she: is taking insu lin, is taking oral 
antidiabetic agents, is on a modified diet to control diabetes mellitus, or has a diagnosis of 
diabetes mellitus documented in the medical record but is untreated, prior to the index procedure. 
Subjects who are taking insulin, or both i nsulin and oral agents, will be classified as insulin 
dependent. Subjects who are taking oral agents only, a modified diet only, both oral agents and a 
modified diet, or are currently untreated, will be classified as non- insulin dependent.  
DISSECTION, NHLB I (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) CLASSIFICATION13 
Grade A  Small radiolucent  area within the lumen of the vessel disappearing  with  the 
passage  of the  contrast  material.  
Grade B  Appearance of contrast  medium  parall el to the lumen of the vessel 
disappearing  within  a few cardiac c ycles. 
Grade C  Dissection protruding outside the lumen of the vessel persisting after passage 
of the contrast material.  
Grade D  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_13716]- off of the contrast 
material in the antegrade flow.  
Grade E  Persistent luminal filling defect with delayed run -off of the contrast material

March  26, 2015  Page 66 of 76 STENT THROMBOSIS  
All stent thrombosis data will be reported per the Academic Research Consortium (ARC) 
definitions. 
Academic Research Consortium (ARC) Definition:  
Stent thrombosis should be reported as a cumulative value over time and at the various 
individual time points as specified below. Time [ADDRESS_13316] has left the catheterization lab.  
Timing:   
Acute stent thrombosis * 0 – [ADDRESS_13317] stent implantation 
Subacute stent thrombosis * > 24 hours – [ADDRESS_13318] stent implantation  
Late stent thrombosis  > 30 days – [ADDRESS_13319] stent implantation  
Very late stent thrombosis  > [ADDRESS_13320] stent implan tation  
* Acute or subacute stent thrombosis can also be replaced by [CONTACT_13796].  
Three categories of evidence define stent thrombosis: Definite, Probable, Possible  
1. Definite (either  by [CONTACT_13797]):  
a. Angiographic  confir mation  of stent  thrombosis  is considered  to have occurred  if: 
i. Thro mbolysis In Myocardial  Infarction  (TIMI) flow is:  
1. TIMI flow grade  [ADDRESS_13321]  one of the  following  criteria  has been fulfilled  within  a 48 hour 
time window:  
1. New onset  of ischem ic symptom s at rest (typi[INVESTIGATOR_13717] >20 
minutes)  
2. New ischemic ECG changes  suggestive  of acute  ischem ia 
3. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_13718]  (refer to  definition  non- procedural  
related  MI).  
Note: The incidental  angiographic  docum entation of stent  occlusion in  the 
absence  of clinical signs or sy mptoms  is not con sidered  a co nfirmed stent  
throm bosis  (silent occlusion).  
b. Pathologic  confir mation  of stent  thrombosis:  
Evidence  of rece nt thrombus within  the stent deter mined at autopsy  or via 
exam ination  of tissue  retrieved  following  thrombecto my. 
2. Probable:  
Clinical definition  of probable  stent  thrombosis is considered  to have occurred  after 
intracoronary  stenting  in the followi ng cases:  
a. Any unexplained  death  within  the first 30 days.

unexplained death  from  [ADDRESS_13322] 
the trial according to the investigational plan, applicable laws or regulations, or the Investigator 
Agreement.  
STUDY STENT  
A study stent is defined as the Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm stent.  
TARGET LESION  
Any lesion treated or attempted to be treated during the study procedure. The target lesion is the 
treated segment starting 5 mm proximal to the stent and ending 5 mm distal to the stent.  
TARGET LESION FAILURE (TLF)  
Defined as cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction (Q wave and non -Q wave), or 
clinically -driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) by [CONTACT_13798] (TLR)  
Repeat PCI or CABG to the target lesion. See also clinically -driven target lesion 
revascularization.  
TARGET VESSEL  
The arterial segment and any branches and/or parent vessel that possess the target lesion.  For 
this study, the target vessel can on ly be the left main (protected), LAD, Cx, RCA. Side branches 
less than 2.0 mm in diameter will not be considered ‘significant’ and therefore the disease in 
these vessels will not be considered significant.

The composite endpoint  comprised of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or 
clinically -driven target vessel revascularization by [CONTACT_13724]. 
Target vessel failure will be reported when ANY of the following events occur:  
• Recurrent MI occurs i n territory not clearly attributed to a vessel other than the target 
vessel.  
• Cardiac death not clearly due to a non- target vessel endpoint. 
• Target vessel revascularization is determined.  
TARGET VESSEL MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (TVMI)  
Target -vessel MI is defined as a MI that occurs in a territory that cannot be clearly attributed to a 
vessel other than the target vessel.  
TARGET VESSEL REVASCULARIZATION (TVR)  
Repeat PCI or CABG of the target vessel. See also clinically -driven target vessel 
revascularization . 
THROMBOLYSIS IN MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (TIMI) CLASSIFICATION15 
TIMI [ADDRESS_13323] opacifies the entire coronary bed distal to the 
stenosis. However, the rate of entry and/or clearance is slower in the coronary 
bed distal to the obstruction than in comparable areas not perfused by [CONTACT_13799].  
TIMI [ADDRESS_13324] equally rapid in the 
coronary bed distal to stenosis as in other coronary beds.

March  26, 2015  Page 69 of 76 THROMBUS (INTRACORONARY)16 
Non-occlusive thrombus:  Intracoronary thrombus is defined as a (spheric, ovoid or 
irregular) non -calcified filling defect or lucency surrounded by 
[CONTACT_13800] (on three sides or within a coronary stenosis) 
seen in multiple projections, or persistence  of contrast material 
within the lumen, or a visible embolization of intraluminal 
material downstream.  
Occlusive thrombus:  TIMI [ADDRESS_13325] adjacent proximal side branch or main branch (if 
originating from the side branch).  
TOTAL OCCLUSION  
A total occlusion is defined as a lesion with no flow (TIMI 0). Total occlusions are usually 
classified as persisting less than or more than 3 months (chronic total occlusion). 
TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK (TIA)  
A TIA is de fined as a focal neurological abnormality of sudden onset and brief duration (lasting 
less than 24 hours) that reflect dysfunction in the distribution of the effected artery. TIAs include 
transient monocular blindness (e.g., amaurosis fugax defined as a tr ansient epi[INVESTIGATOR_13719], or partial blindness, lasting ten minutes or less) and transient hemispheric attacks.  
UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECT (UADE)  
An UADE is defined as any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life- threat ening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan  or 
application (including a supplementary plan or appli cation), or any other unanticipated serious 
problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
UNSTABLE ANGINA  
Per the ACC/AHA 2002 Guideline Update for the Management of Subjects with Unstable 
Angina and Non–ST -Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction there are three (3) principal 
presentations of unstable angina (UA)17: 
1. Rest Angina. Angina occurring at rest and prolonged, usually >[ADDRESS_13326] CCS Class III Severity.  
3. Increasing Angina. Previously diagnosed angina that has become distinctly more 
frequent, longer in duration, or lower in threshold (i.e., increased by [CONTACT_13801] [ADDRESS_13327] CCS Class III severity).

Medicare Beneficiaries  
The results of this study are expected to be applicable to a significant number of Medicare 
beneficiaries based on incidence of cardiovascular dise ase, number of percutaneous coronary 
interventions, and number of patients with relevant luminal reference diameters of the culprit 
coronary artery in this population.  
A 2010 report published by [CONTACT_13802] (CDC) found that coronary he art 
disease was the most common subtype of heart disease hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], representing 42.0 % of all 
Medicare heart disease hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].(1) 
Analyses of percutaneous coronary interventions among Medicare beneficiaries showed the 
following number of PCI  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (both admission and non- admission) from 2008 to 2012 (2):  
• 2008: 423,789 PCI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  
• 2009: 426,518 PCI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  
• 2010:  434,134 PCI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  
• 2011: 417,963 PCI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  
• 2012:  401,929 PCI epi[INVESTIGATOR_13720] 15 years based on the baby [CONTACT_13803], as well as the current incidence of cardiac revascularizations 
performed on Medicare beneficiaries. (2) 
With regard to the specific popul ations that may benefit from the Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm, 
diameter device, the Journal of the American College of Cardiology published a study showing 
that among a study of 2,306 patients, 35% (n=813 patients) with a mean age of [ADDRESS_13328] a lumina l reference diameters of less than or equal to 2.5 mm. (3)

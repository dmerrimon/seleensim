 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
1.1 Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma  
 
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer. Fifty 
thousand new cases are diagnosed each year. Most patients present with locally advanced disease stage (III, IVa, and IVb) and are treated with multimodality therapy. Human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV; p16+ )-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) 
represents 15% of all new  cases of HNSCC. Such patients have an excellent prognosis with 
recurrence rates of only 10- 20%. However, patients with HPV -unrelated  (p16-)/smoking-
induced HNSCC have a substantially poorer prognosis, and 50% or more of these patients 
will experience death due to disease recurrence.  Patients with incurable HNSCC have a 
poor prognosis and limited therapy options, resulting in major unmet need.  
1.[ADDRESS_1254717] a median overall survival (OS) of 
10.1 months, median progression- free survival ( PFS) of 5.6 months, and an overall 
tumor response rate (RR) of 36% when treated with the current standard first line chemotherapy regimen of cis/carboplatin, 5- FU, and cetuximab.
1,2 This was 
established in  a landmark study called the EXTREME trial, during which 
Vermorken et al randomly assigned patients with untreated incurable HNSCC to receive a regimen of PF (platin [ cisplatin 100 mg/m
2 or carboplatin AUC 5 ] on Day 
1 plus 5- FU 1000 mg/m2/day for 4 days) on a 3 -week cycle either alone or with 
concurrent cetuximab for a maximum of 6 cycles.1  The trial showed a significant 
improvement in all major efficacy parameters including OS (7.4 vs 10.1 mos), PFS (3.3 vs 5.6 mos), and RR (20% vs 36%) with the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy. In addition to promoting the institution of the new standard of care 
therapy for incurable HNSCC , the EXTREME trial  led to a new Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approved indication for cetuximab. 
 
1.2.[ADDRESS_1254718]  line treatment of incurable 
HNSCC with tumor RR of 40% .3,[ADDRESS_1254719] line treatment in 
incurable HNSCC with RR of 42% .4 However, the efficacy of doce taxel in patients 
with incurable HNSCC that progressed with platin, 5 -FU, and cetuximab is 
unknown. 
 Methotrexate has been used in the treatment of incurable HNSCC; however, the 
Protocol Version:  03/09/23  Page 9 of 43 
 efficacy of this agent in patients with HNSCC that progressed with platin, 5- FU, 
and cetuximab is also unknown. 
 
1.2.3 PD-L1 in HNSCC  
 
Expression of PD -L1 is frequent (80%) in HNSCC.[ADDRESS_1254720]. The tumor 
response rate of these agents was 13 -18%,5,[ADDRESS_1254721] option in the  
treatment of  incurable HNSCC, there is a body of dat a supporting its efficacy in  
preclinical  experiments7 and in combination with radiation as a  radiosensitizer for  
curable disease and in combination with other chemotherapy in incurable disease.8  
 
Preclinical experiments demonstrated repression of E6 expression and induction of apoptosis in HPV SCC cell lines exposed to mitomycin C.

[ADDRESS_1254723] combined 
mitomycin C with other chemotherapy; however, the independent effect of 
mitomycin C is not clear.[ADDRESS_1254724] treated two patients with incurable HNSCC with m itomycin C. Each 
patient’s cancer had progressed on prior platin, 5- FU, cetuximab, and taxane. 
Mitomyc in C was administered at either 20 mg/m
2 (Case 1) or 10 mg/m2 (Case 2) 
q6 wks. Both patients’ cancer responded to mitomycin C. Case 1 is shown below: 
                Pre -Treatment                                   Post -Cycle [ADDRESS_1254725] Cycle-2 
  
 Case 1 was given 20 mg/m
2 of mitomycin C q6 weeks; however, this patient 
experienced prolonged grade 4 thrombocytopenia after Cycle 2 during which the 

Protocol Version:  03/09/23  Page 11 of 43 
 patient’s cancer progressed. Therefore, a lower dose of mitomycin C (10 mg/m2) 
was used for Case 2. This patient did not experience grade [ADDRESS_1254726] established the critical importance of 
mitomycin C in the CRT regimen. RTOG 87- 04/ ECOG 1289 demonstrated that 
mitomycin C/5 -FU/RT was superior to 5-FU/RT alone .11 RTOG 98 -11 
demonstrated that m itomycin C/5 -FU/RT was superior to cisplatin/5 -FU/RT .12,[ADDRESS_1254727] included mitomycin C in the treatment of incurable cervical SCC; however, the independent 
effects of mitomycin C in these studies is unclear.
[ADDRESS_1254728] second line therapy exists following disease progression on platin/5- FU/cetuximab , although most would deliver a taxane , even though no 
prospective data exists to support the bene fit of this approach.  
 No agent is known to have efficacy in patients with incurable HNSCC that progressed with prior platin, 5- FU, cetuximab and taxane. Herein lies the unmet need to be addressed by 
[CONTACT_429794]. Based on the preclinical and clinical data presented, w e propose that mitomycin 
C will have anti-tumor activity in these patients. Since the biology of p16 positive OPSCC 
and p16 negative HNSCC are distinctly different, we will stratify patients into two groups based on p16 status.  A two stage Simon schema will be used for each group (p16+ OPSCC and p16- HNSCC). The primary endpoint is tumor response rate as assessed by [CONTACT_393]  
1.1 criteria.  
 Amendment  #7: As of October 2020, a ccrual to the p16+ cohort continues based on activity 
observed in Simon Stage 1; the p16- cohort was closed after Simon Stage 1 due to 
inactivity. However, accrual to the trial has been slower than expected. Since the trial 
opened, a key impediment to accrual was  the interim FDA approval of immunotherapy for 
HNSCC, adding an additional line of standar d treatment prior to patients going on to this 
trial. In an effort to increase the pace of accrual to this trial, we propose changing the 
current inclusion requirement of disease progression on prior platinum, cetuximab, taxane 
Protocol Version:  03/09/23  Page 12 of 43 
 and 5- FU to disease progression on prior platinum and immunotherapy. The rationale for 
this amendment is that platinum and immunotherapy are the only agents that improved OS 
when given as monotherapy; whereas, monotherapy with either cetuximab, taxane, and 5-
FU do not yield an OS benefit  and have a low response rate (<5%) in this setting.   
 
1.5 Correlative Studies Background  
 
Tumor biopsies and blood will be obtained, if possible, for planned 
immunohistochemistries of smad4, B RCA1, and Rad51, which are known to be reduced in 
HNSCC and whose loss confers sensitivity to mitomycin C. Other studies may be 
performed as indicated.

8.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
8.1 Mitomycin C  
 
8.1.1 Mitomycin C Description  
 
Mitomycin (also known as mitomycin- C) is an antibiotic isolated from the broth of 
Streptomyces caespi[INVESTIGATOR_895101] . The 
compound is heat stable, has a high melting point, and is freely soluble in organic 
solvents. 
 
Mitomycin is a blue -violet crystalline powder with the molecular formula of 
C15H18N4O5, and a molecular weight of 334.33. Its chemical name [CONTACT_832] 7- amino -9α-
methoxymitosane and it has the following structural formula. 
 
8.1.2 Clinical Pharmacology 
 
Mitomycin selectively inhibits the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).  The 
guanine a nd cytosine content correlates with the d egree of mitomycin -induced 
cross- linking.  At high concentrations of the drug, cellular RNA and protein 
synthesis are also suppressed.  
 
In humans, mitomycin is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_895102].  Time required to reduce the serum concentration by 50% after a 30 
mg bolus injection is 17 minutes.  Clearance is effected primarily by [CONTACT_895109], but metabolism occurs in other tissues as well.  The rate of clea rance is 
inversely proportional to the maximal serum concentration because, it is thought, 
of saturation of the degradation pathways. 
 
Approximately 10% of a dose of mitomycin is excreted unchanged in the urine. 
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_1254744] 
a pH between 6.0 and 8.0. 
 
8.1.5 Storage and Stability  
Protocol Version:  03/09/23  Page 20 of 43 
  
Mitomycin C should be  stored at controlled room temperature at 15°C -30°C and 
protected from light.  Reconstituted mitomycin C should be used within 24 hours. 
 
8.1.6 Administration  
 
Mitomycin C will be given IV at a dose of 10 mg/m2 on Day 1 Q5 weeks.  
 
 
9.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
9.1 Archived Tumor Tissue 
 
9.1.1 Collection of Specimen(s)  
 
Previously collected formalin -fixed paraffin embedded tissue (15 slides per case) 
will be requested for immunohistochemical analyses.   This may be archival tissue 
from a previous pre -treatment diagnostic biopsy, tissue collected under HRPO# 
201102323 (“Analysis of Histological, Genomic, Molecular, and Clinical Factors 
in Head and Neck Cancer: The Tissue Acquisition Protocol (TAP)”) to w hich 
participants in this study will be encouraged to enroll, or tissue collected under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_895103].  If biopsies are performed as part of this protocol, collection will be performed as follows.  Tissue samples will be obtained by [CONTACT_895110] (1- 2 cm
3 portion of 
tissue) or 4 mm or greater dermatology biopsy punch.  Specimens should be fixed 
in 10% buffered formalin. 
 Tissue for p16 testing is required. Tissue collection is high ly encouraged for 
correlative testing, but is not required for trial participation.  
 
9.1.2 Handling of Specimen(s)  
 
Archived tissue should be delivered to the study team at Campus Box 8056. 
 
9.2 Blood for Future Research  
 
For patients not enrolled in HRPO# 201102323, 20 mL of anticoagulated blood will be collected in three EDTA purple top tubes prior to initiation of treatment and again at progression/recurrence.  Samples will be spun and processed for peripheral white blood cells.  Residual red blood cells will be removed by [CONTACT_895111].  Nucleated cells will be washed in phosphate buffered saline, divided into approximately 20 x 10
6 cells/aliquot, 
spun down, and the supernatant removed.  Cell pellets will be labeled with a unique specimen ID number, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored under liquid nitrogen vapor in an inventoried storage unit at the Siteman Cancer Center Tissue Procurement Core Facility.

12.0 DATA SUBMISSION SCHEDULE 
 
Case report forms with appropriate source documentation will be completed according to the schedule listed in this section.  
Protocol Version:  03/09/[ADDRESS_1254746] be captured in the Toxicity Form.    Participant death due to disease progression should be reported on the Toxicity Form as grade 5 disease progression.  If death is due to an AE (e.g. c ardiac disorders: cardiac 
arrest), report as a grade [ADDRESS_1254747] – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated  for response at the end of 
every even -numbered cycle ( every 10 weeks) .  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory 
scans should also be obtained not less than 4 weeks following initial documentation of 
objective response.  Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228- 247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diamete r 
Protocol Version:  03/09/23  Page 25 of 43 
 (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case 
of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. 
 
13.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_1254748] x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_1254749] scan, or >[ADDRESS_1254750] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 Malignant lymph nodes :  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_1254751] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.  Non-measurable disease:   All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non- measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should 
not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since 
they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the long est diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but 
in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baselin e sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short 
axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 Non-target lesions :  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the 
Protocol Version:  03/09/23  Page 26 of 43 
 presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up.  
 
13.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a rule r or calipers.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 Clinic al lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_895112], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.   Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.   Conventional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1254752] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optim ized for the evaluation of the 
type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should 
be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath -hold 
scanning techniques, if possible.  PET- CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET- CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurem ents.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -
CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  
Protocol Version:  03/09/[ADDRESS_1254753] introduces additional data which may bias 
an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 Ultrasound:   Ultras ound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be  guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation exposure  
at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 Tumor markers:   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [JNCI 96:487- 488, 2004; J Clin Oncol 17, 3461- 3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol 26:1148-1159, 2008].  
In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_1254754] -line trials  in 
ovarian cancer [JNCI 92:1534-1535, 2000].  
Cytology, Histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, wh ere known residual benign tumors can remain). 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 FDG -PET:   While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning  to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow-up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
• No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this 
is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT, additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is 
truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the 
Protocol Version:  03/09/23  Page 28 of 43 
 initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
• FDG- PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiog raphic abnormality is thought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both 
approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and 
biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
 
13.4 Response Criteria  
 
13.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as ref erence the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more ne w lesions is also considered progressions).  
 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
 
13.4.2 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
Protocol Version:  03/09/23  Page 29 of 43 
  
Progressive Disease (PD):   Appearance of one or more  new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.      Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_36408], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_1254755] response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatmen t started).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment

deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.

category when no lesions can be measured is not advised  
  
13.4.4 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of ove rall response:   The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for  progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 Duration of stable disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_1254756]. 
 
13.4.6 Response Review  
 
For trials where the response rate is the primary endpoint, it is strongly recommended that all responses be reviewed by [CONTACT_13461](s) independent of the study at the study’s completion.  Simultaneous review of the patients’ files and radiological images is the best approach.  
  
14.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
14.1 Hypothesis  
 
A novel regimen of mitomycin C w ill result in tumor responses in patients with incurable 
p16+ OPSCC and p16- HNSCC. 
 
Protocol Version:  03/09/23  Page 31 of 43 
 14.2 Study Endpoints  
 
The primary endpoint is tumor response rate  in p16+ OPSCC and p16- HNSCC. Secondary 
endpoints are progression free survival ( PFS), occurrence of grade 3- 4 adverse events by 
[CONTACT_3989] 3.0, and overall survival ( OS). Exploratory endpoints  of quality of life  measured 
by [CONTACT_51222]- QLQ-30 and Cognitive Fail ures Questions ( CFQ).  
 
14.3 Statistical Design  
 
Tumor response rate (TRR) will be evaluated separately in p16- HNSCC  patients and in 
p16+ OPSCC patients using two optimal two -stage Simon designs. In both cases, t he 
expected TRR is 10% .  A TRR of 30% is consider ed a clinically significant increase. In 
each study arm a  maximum of [ADDRESS_1254757] stage is . 66 if the true TRR is 10%.  Power is .[ADDRESS_1254758] 2 tumor responses in the p16- HNSCC group, so there will not be a 
second stage of enrollment for that patient population.  
14.4 Analysis Plan for Time to Event and Adve rse Events Endpoints  
 
All grade AEs, all serious (Grades 3 -4) AEs, and all Grade 5 (treatment -related deaths) 
AEs will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and compared to historical controls using one-sample tests for difference of proportions.  PFS a nd OS will be described in each study group using Kaplan- Meier or Cox proportional 
hazards models to estimate medians and hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals.  
 
14.5 Analysis Plan for Quality of Life Endpoints  
 
The exploratory quality of life endpoints w ill include the EORTC -QLQ -C30, which has a 
total score, one general QOL and one “within the last week” subscale, as well as a single 
general health item and a single overall QOL item. The CFQ has 3 subscales describing perception, memory and motor function.   Mean or median quality of life will be documented in the two study groups. Patient -specific 
and clinical significance of observed differences will be a matter for discussion at the end of the study; the study does not intend to determine a minimal important difference. The study does use current empi[INVESTIGATOR_895106] -QLQ- [ADDRESS_1254759] deviation will be considered a perceptible difference.   
Protocol Version:  03/09/23  Page 32 of 43 
  
Tables and histograms will be used to explore change in the subscales and summary scales in each study group. Scale and subscale scores may be used as independent variables in models of TRR, OS or PFS using chi- square, Kaplan -Meier and Cox proportional hazards 
methods. Spearman’s rank correlation or, where there are a large number of tied scores, Kendall’s tau -b will be used to explore correlation (redundancy) between QOL (sub)scales 
prior to modeling.

 APPENDIX D: Definitions for Adverse Event Reporting 
 
A. Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  
 
Definition:  any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug- related.  
 
Grading:  the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website.  
 Attribu tion (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the 
terms listed that should be used are those provided by [CONTACT_9092]’ Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of this guidance can be found on OHRP’s website:  
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html
 
 
B. Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  
 
Definition:  any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
C. Life-Threatening Adverse Event / Life Threatening Suspected Adverse 
Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  
 
Definition:  any adverse drug event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of the investigator, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse 
reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 D.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  
 
Definition:  an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” 
if, in the view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
Protocol Version:  03/09/[ADDRESS_1254781] normal life functions  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
o Any other important medical event that does not fit the criteria above but, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
 
E. Protocol Exceptions  
 
Definition:  A planned change in the conduct of the research for one participant.  
 
F. Deviation 
 
Definition:  Any alteration or modification to the IRB -approved research without 
prospective IRB approval.  The term “research” encompasses all IRB -approved 
materials and documents including the detailed protocol, IRB application, consent 
form, recruitment materi als, questionnaires/data collection forms, and any other 
information relating to the research study.  
 A minor or administrative deviation is one that does not have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of 
the study.  
 
A major deviation is one that does have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.

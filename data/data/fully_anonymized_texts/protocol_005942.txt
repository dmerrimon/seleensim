Study  
Assessments:  Safety Evaluations:  
Patient safety will be evaluated based on the incidence of AEs and serious AEs 
(SAEs), physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure [systolic and diastolic], heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], weight, and body temperature), electrocardiogram (ECG) 
parameters  (Safety lead -in and Part 1) , and clinical laboratory tests (hematology, 
clinical chemistry, coagulation and urinalysis).  
All AEs will be evaluated according to NCI -CTCAE 4.03 and will be captured from 
the time of informed consent and continue until  the safety follow -up assessment 
([ADDRESS_638240] administration of study treatment). For the purpose of this study, 
fluctuations of pre -existing conditions that do not represent a clinically significa nt 
exacerbation or worsening need not be considered AEs.  In addition, p rogression of 
the cancer of target disease under study is generally not considered an AE.  
 
Safety lead -in: 
In the Safety lead -in, triplicate 12 -lead ECG will be performed on Cycle 1 Day 1 and 
Cycle 1 Day 8 at the following time points  and will be analyzed by a Core ECG 
Laboratory : 
• Cycle 1 Day 1: [ADDRESS_638241] -dose 
• Cycle 1 Day 8 : [ADDRESS_638242]- dose Day 22 (Cycle 2 Day 1) and 
onwards every cycle  while the subject remains in the study. The [ADDRESS_638243] 10 minutes in a quiet environment. Detailed instructions will be described in the ECG manual. The ECG machines supplied by [CONTACT_496503], and the digital files of each tracing will be archived.  
 
Part 1:  
The primary electrocardiographic analysis of the protocol will be from the time -based 
ECG analysis  performed in Part  1 at baseline, Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 8, and the 
safety follow -up visit . Triplicate ECGs will be collected with a PK sample collected 
immediately following ECG acquisition.  ECGs will be analyzed by a Core ECG Laboratory.  
Collection time points:  
• Cycle 1 Day 1: [ADDRESS_638244] -dose.  Concomitant PK samples will be collected immediately 
after the ECG collections, except for the 45 minutes pre -dose time points 
where no PK sample will be collected.  
• Cycle 1 Day 8: [ADDRESS_638245] -dose.  Concomitant PK samples will be collected immediately 
after the ECG collections, except for the 45 minutes and 5 minutes pre -dose 
time points. One pre -dose PK sample will be collected at the 20 minutes pre -
dose time point.  
• End of Study after full drug washout ([ADDRESS_638246] dose) a set of 
triplicate ECGs will be collecte d 3 hours after a light snack .

safety data; the first DSMB will occur after the first [ADDRESS_638252] completed the 21 days of follow -up and the second DSMB will be at a selected 
time point to be confirmed during Part 1 of the study. Additional DSMB meetings 
may occur if needed. Details will be specified in the DSMB  Charter.  
 
Efficacy Evaluations : 
Tumor evaluations will be performed to e valuate the efficacy of treatment according 
to RECIST v1.1. Tumor response will be assessed by [CONTACT_496505] 
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and every 6 weeks until EOT 
(Safety Lead -in) or disease progression  (Part 1 and Part 2). All tumor responses 
should be assessed at every assessment time point using the same methods (contrast -
enhanced CT or MRI) used to characterize lesions identified at baseline.  
 
Safety Lead -in 
Radiological images collected in the Safety lead -in will be assessed by [CONTACT_779].  
 
Part 1  
Radiological images collected in the Part 1 of the study will be assessed by a n ICR. 
Patients cannot be randomized into Part 1 of the study until the ICR  has confirmed  
eligibility. Central radiological reading will not interfere with the Investigator’s 
judgment on disease progression.

Varlitinib may cause a drug -drug interaction with other medications that are 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, CYP2C8, or CYP2C9 inducers, inhibitors, or 
substrates. CYP3A4 is the major metabolic enzyme of varlitinib, and CYP2C8 only 
a minor enzyme. Due to the potential for drug interactions based on in vitro screens, 
concomitant use of moderate C YP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and P -gp inducers or  
inhibitors will be recorded during the entire clinical  study . 
Statistical 
Analysis:  Safety lead -in 
All safety data will be listed and summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics. Full details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP ). 
The pharmacokinetic endpoints of varlitinib, capecitabine and 5 -FU will be plotted 
and summarized using descriptive statistics.  
QTcF exposure response modeling, along with time -based central tendency effects 
and categorical QTc analyses will be evaluated.  Both the Bazett and Fridericia 
correction  (primary correction method)  formulae will be used to estimate QTc. 
 
Parts 1 and 2  
For Part 1 and 2, all primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) using an intention -to-treat principle. Patients 
who were randomized but did not subsequently go on to receive study treatment will be included in the FAS.  Analyses performed in the protocol -defined “ Evaluable for 
Response set (EFR)” will be supportive.
 
Objective response rate will be analyzed using a stratified exact binomial test (Mehta 
et al, Emerson) which extends Fisher’s Exact test to more than one strat um. The 
analysis will be stratified by [CONTACT_496508] (GB/non -GB).  The 2 -sided

Breslow method to handle ties (Breslow, 1974). The analysis will be stratified by [CONTACT_496508] (GB/Non -GB).  
Overall survival  will be analyzed using the methods outlined above for PFS.  For Part 
1, OS will be analyzed twice. A preliminary analysis of OS will be performed at the 
time of the primary analysis of ORR and PFS. It is anticipated that the OS data at this 
time will be immature, thus a second analysis of OS is planned for when 
approximately 95 patients (approx. 79%) have an OS event. The second analysis of 
OS will be considered the primary analysis of OS for Part [ADDRESS_638267] experienced an 
OS event . Further details will be provided in the study SAP.  
Duration of response will be listed and summarized descriptively for the duration of 
response in responding patient s, including the associated Kaplan -Meier curves.  
Disease control rate will be analyzed using the methods described above for ORR.  
Tumor size is a secondary endpoint in Part 1 and will be used to assess the exploratory 
objective of evaluating the role of HER family expression levels as predictors of benefit to varlitinib. Tumor size will be a nalyz

Plasma sampling will be conducted for population PK evaluation in Parts [ADDRESS_638268] , and Sta tistician prior to unblinding or any analyses 
being performed.  
 
ECG/QT Analysis (Safety Lead -in and Part 1)  
General Principles  
Baseline will be defined as the mean of the triplicate ECG readings performed pre-dose on Day 1. On Day 1, pre -dose is defined as  2 sets of triplicate ECGs taken 
45 minutes and 5 minutes prior to dosing. The ECG values from these 2 sets of ECGs 
will be averaged to create the baseline value. Similarly, for all other time points, for each ECG parameter, each patient’s mean will be cal
culated from the triplicate 
readings and the mean value will be used.  
 
The final ECG assessments (including interval measurements) will be made by [CONTACT_496509]. The Part 1 electrocardiographic Core ECG Laboratory 
assessments constitute the study’s primary assessment of ECG/QTc. Any analysis of 
ECG data from the Safety lead -in is considered exploratory.  
 
Due to the non -randomized, open label design of the Safety lead -in, data from the 
Safety lead -in will be p resented separately from data from  Part 1 of the study. 
Furthermore, ECG/QT o utputs will be made available to the DSMB for consideration 
when determining whether the study should progress to Part 1.

QRS intervals.  
 
For Part 1, a multi -step approach will be applied to evaluate the effect of capecitabine 
alone and varlitinib in combination with capecitabine on the ECG parameters at different time points post -dose. The comparisons will be done between ECG values 
at each time point post -dose and baseline and between treatment arms with and 
without varlitinib for each time point individually. The evaluation of the 
cardiodynamic effects of capecitabine and varlitinib may be explored using exposure-
response modeling if  there appears to be a meaningful effect of varlitinib when added 
to capecitabine  on the ECG parameters including QTcF.  This will be further 
described in the SAP. 
 
Central Tendency Analysis  
For both the Safety lead -in and Part 1, the change from baseline in QTcF, PR, QRS, 
QTcB, and heart rate, will be summarized by [CONTACT_7206] (and treatment arm for Part 
1) using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, min, median, max, 90% confidence 
intervals).   
 
Categorical Analyses  
For both the Safety lead -in and Part 1, the following will be summarized: 
• The proportion of patients obtaining treatment -emergent absolute QTcF values >  
450 msec and ≤ 480 msec; > 480 msec and ≤ 500 msec; and > 500 msec  
• The proporti on of patients obtaining a QTcF increase from baseline values ≥ 30 
and <60 msec and ≥ 60 msec  
• The proportion of patients obtaining a QRS change from baseline >  25% 
resulting in QRS >  120 msec  
• The proportion of patients obtaining a PR interval change from b aseline >25% 
reaching a value >220 msec  
• The proportion of patients obtaining a > 25% decrease from baseline in heart rate

1. ANOVA mixed effects comparison of the absolute values of ECG parameters at 
each time point vs baseline using treatment as a fixed effect in order to evaluate 
the contribution of circadian fluctuation and to determine how treatment 
differences contribute to the changes. The ECG parameter values will be log -
transformed and the resulting output will include the geometric mean ratio for test vs reference with the corresponding confidence interval and p -value. 
Interaction term, time point x treatment, will be also evaluated if the data allow.  
2. ANOVA comparison of the absolute values of ECG parameters as well as change from baseline (ΔECG) between treatments for each post -dose time point assessed 
separately in order to separate the varlitinib effect from that of capecitabine. The ECG parameter values will be log -transformed and the resulting output will 
include the geometric mean ratio for test vs reference with the corresp onding 
confidence interval and p -value.  ΔECG will be tested as untransformed and log-
transformed parameters to avoid bias from discarding 0 ΔECG values from the comparisons.  
3. Exposure -Response Analysis:  Linear mixed effect model between ΔQTcF and 
time mat ched concentrations of varlitinib and other potential metabolites if 
measured and as appropriate.  Other ECG variable may be similarly analyzed and 
other models used, if appropriate.  
3.1. ΔQTcF will be calculated as the difference between each time point value 
and the average baseline value for each arm with the combination 
varlitinib/capecitabine treatment.  
3.2. ΔΔQTcF will be calculated for each patient in the combination arm 
individually as the difference between the ΔQTcF value for the arm with 
combination varli tinib/capecitabine treatment and the average value of all 
patients in the capecitabine alone arm matching time point. Other ECG 
parameters may also be used in the analysis including QTcB, heart rate, etc to provide supporting information.  
3.3. Base linear mixed  effect model will include patients as a random effect.  
3.4. The total dose of capecitabine may be included as a fixed effect in the model to account for differences in total doses received by [CONTACT_496510].  
4. Linear mixed effect model  between ΔQTcF parameters and time matched 
concentrations of capecitabine and 5 -FU (metabolite of capecitabine) and other 
potential metabolites if measured and as appropriate  
4.1. ΔQTcF will be calculated for all patients in both arms as the difference between each time point value and the average baseline value.  
4.2. Base linear mixed effect model will include patients as a random effect and treatment (capecitabine alone or in combination with varlitinib) as a fixed effect; the total capecitabine dose may also be used as a fixed effect.  
5. Different covariates may be included in the complex models in addition to the 
base model as fixed effects such as time point in order to ensure the model 
feasibility and to evaluate covariates influential to ECG parameters.  
The result s of the fitted models will be presented using statistical parameters such as 
the geometric mean ratios and corresponding confidence intervals (for ANOVA) and estimates of the slope, and associated confidence interval for the linear mixed effect models.  
In addition, graphic exploration of the exposure -ECG relationship may be performed:

Sample Size:  Part 1:  
The study is designed with co -primary endpoints, ORR , and PFS. In order to maintain 
an overall 1-sided 10% type I error rate for the study , a Hochberg procedure will be 
used, such that the trial will be deemed to have met its primary objective if either endpoint is significant at the 1-sided 5% level or if both endpoints are significant at 
the 1-sided 10% significance level.  
To ensure that adequate data are available to evaluate the effects of varlitinib on both co-primary endpoints, the DCO for the primary analysis will be the later of [ADDRESS_638272] patient in or when 70% of the patients (84 patients) have experienced a 
PFS event.  Based on a minimum of [ADDRESS_638273] a minimum of 80% power to detect a true Hazard Ratio (HR) of 
0.58 for PFS, based on a 1-sided 5% significance level.  
Furthermore,  if the primary objective of the study is met, the following approach to 
type I error control will be applied in order to support marketing approval:  
• The overall type I error rate for marketing approval will be controlled at the two-sided 5% level, using a Hochberg procedure  
• Using this approach, statistical significance may be claimed if either  ORR or 
PFS is significant at the two -sided 2.5% significance level or if both ORR 
and PFS are significant at the two -sided 5% significance level.   
One hundred and twenty patients will provide approximately 80% power to detect a 
true difference of 20% in response rate, based on a 2-sided 5% significance level and 
assuming a 10% response rate for the placebo/capecitabine group and a 30% response rate f or the varlitinib/capecitabine group.  
A total of 84 PFS events provides 80% power to detect a true HR of 0.54 , based on a 
two-sided 5% significance level. Assuming a n 8-month non- linear recruitment period, 
a 2.67- month median PFS for capecitabine alone, and a true HR of 0.[ADDRESS_638274] patient is randomized into the study ( first patient  in). 
 
Part 2 : 
Part 2 is designed with a primary endpoint of OS. Approximately 350 patients will be 
randomized (1:1) to obtain 247 OS events. If the true OS HR for the comparison of varlitinib + capecitabine vs. placebo + capecitabine is 0.7, the study  
will have 
approximately 80% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference for varlitinib, based on a 2-sided 5% significance level.  
Assuming a 24- month non -linear recruitment period whereby [CONTACT_496511] s recruited by [CONTACT_496512] i is (i/24)^2, a median OS of 6 months for

a. Vitals (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature) to be collected in a standardized manner in a sitting position after the patient has rested 
comfortably for 5 minutes.  
b. Part 1: Triplicate 12 -Lead ECG using the Core Laboratory -supplied ECG machines will be performed as close as  possible and within 25 minutes prior 
to PK sampling at selected time points on  
• Cycle  1 Day 1: [ADDRESS_638290] -dose. Concomitant PK samples will be collected 
immediately after the ECG collections, except for 45 minutes pre- dose time point where no PK sample will be collected.  
• Cycle 1 Day 8: [ADDRESS_638291] -dose.  Concomitant PK samples will be collected 
immediately after the ECG collections, except for the 45 minutes and 5 minutes pre- dose time points.  One pre -dose PK sample will be 
collected on Cycle 1 Day 8 at the 20 minutes p re-dose time point.  
• End of Study after full drug washout (at [ADDRESS_638292] dose) a set of triplicate ECGs will be collected 3 hours after a lig ht snack. A 
concomitant PK sample will be collected immediately after the ECG collection.  
• In addition, triplicate safety ECGs will be collected [ADDRESS_638293] -dose on Day 22 (Cycle 2 Day 1), Day 64 (Cycle 4 Day 1) and every [ADDRESS_638294] 10 minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_496461] 12 -Lead ECG assessment. There should 
be no significant external stimulation (TV, radio, interaction with other subjects).  
 
Part 2: Triplicate safety ECGs will be collected at screening, baseline (before a snack), and [ADDRESS_638295] -dose on Day 22 (Cycle 2 Day 1) and Day 64 
(Cycle 4 Day 1) and every [ADDRESS_638296] remains in the study.  These ECGs will not be analyzed by [CONTACT_496513].  
c. Adverse event recording will commence from the time of consent and continues until the safety follow -up assessment with the patient. 
d. Varlitin ib tablets 300 mg administered orally, BID, every da y with food.  Patients should avoid a high -fat meal. Note: Cycle 1 Day 1 , Cycle 1 Day 8  
(Part 1 only),  and Cycle 2 Day 1 morning dose can only be administered under supervision of the Investigator (or designee), following collection of 
pre-dose PK sample and ECG.  
e. Capecitabine tablets 1000 mg/m2 administered orally, BID with food for [ADDRESS_638297] to be performed at the screening visit for all females except those surgically sterile or 2 years  postmenopausal. Serum or urine 
pregnancy tests will be performed at EOT. Unscheduled  serum or urine pregnancy tests will be performed at the Investigator’s discretion.  
g. Screening clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis and coa gulation) must be completed ≤ [ADDRESS_638298] be completed ≤ 21 days prior to Day 1. Serology tests include Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C Virus antibo dy and human 
immunodeficiency virus antibody tests.

During the study treatment period, blood is to be collected for the analysis of CA19.9 and CEA at every 6 weeks (±5 days) from Cycle [ADDRESS_638299]/MRI . The final collection of blood for these analyses should occur at EOT.  If the reason for EOT is due to radiological disease progressions 
and CA19.9/CEA ha ve already  been assessed  with the most recent scans, then CA19.9/CEA at EOT can be omitted.  
k. Archival paraffin -embe dded tumor tissues will be collected during screening for future analysis (the minimum archival tumor tissue to be collected is 
19 unstained slides of 5 microns ). 
l. Biopsy will be performed dur ing screening for those patients who did not have enough archival tumo r tissue if the patient has provided the optional 
tumor tissue consent.  
m. Blood samples for PK analysis of varlitinib and any relevant circulating metabolites will be collected as follows:  
Part 1 (All Patients):   
• Cycle 1 Day 1: [ADDRESS_638300] -dose. PK samples will be collected immediately after the ECG collections.  
• Cycle 1 Day 8: [ADDRESS_638301] -dose.  PK samples will be collected immediately after the ECG collections.  
• End of study after full drug washout:  [ADDRESS_638302] dose at the patient’s safety follow -up visit . PK samples will be collected within 25 
minutes after ECG evaluation . 
Part 2:  
Sparse plasma sampling will be conducted for the population PK evaluation by [CONTACT_496514] : 
• Cycle 1 Day 1: [ADDRESS_638303] -dose 
• Cycle 2 Day 1: [ADDRESS_638304] -dose.  
Part 1 & Part 2: In addition, u nscheduled PK samples will be collected at least 7 days following dose reduction  of varlitinib at any cycle of treatment: 
up to [ADDRESS_638305]/MRI imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis images to be performed every 6 weeks (±5 days)  from Cycle 1 Day 1 . Brain and/or bone lesions 
may be scanned if applicable. Radiological assessments should continue unt il the patient experiences disease progression, regardless of whether the 
patient discontinues randomized therapy or starts a subsequent anti -cancer therapy.  
p. Baseline CT/MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis images must be performed within 21 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, brain and/o r bone lesions may 
be scanned if applicable.  The CT/MRI image obtained as per site standard clinical p ractice prior to consent is a cceptable for baseline image if it meets 
the protocol required CT/MRI image acquisition guidelines and time window.  
q. Additional weekly liver function test  (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin)  will also be 
performed for all patients on Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 1 Day 15.  
r. No other additional study -related activities or assessments are mandated during follow -up visit; however, patient data available from the assessments 
done as part of their routin e follow -up visits will be collected by [CONTACT_456].  If the patient needs to start a new anti -tumo r treatment within [ADDRESS_638306] EOT and PD until death to find out the survival status, 
new chemotherapy or biological treatments and the outcome of any ongoing adverse events.  
u. EOT assessment s should be performed be fore the start of new anti -tumo r treatment .

Varlitinib (also known as ASLAN001) is a small -molecule, adenosine triphosphate 
competitive inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases -epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR), 
human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506]  (HER)2 , and HER 4, developed by [CONTACT_496515].   
ASLAN Pharmaceuticals Pte. Ltd. (ASLAN) has in -licensed va rlitinib  (ASLAN001) as 
of July 2011, and is responsible for future clinical development of the molecule. In August 
2015, varlitinib  was granted orphan- drug designation status for the treatment of 
cholangiocarcinoma by [CONTACT_414344] S tates (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , 
Office of Orphan Products Development. 
3.[ADDRESS_638318] cancers  (BTCs)  are heterogeneous and highly lethal malignancies including 
a spectrum of invasive carcinomas arising in the gallbladder and bile ducts (intrahepatic 
and extrahepatic), and variably, ampullary carcinoma. These tumo rs are very uncommon, 
representing less th an 1% of all cancers in the developed countries. Approximately [ADDRESS_638319] patients 
are often diagnosed at an advanced stage when surgical resection is not feasible and treatment options are limited. The 5 -year overall survival  rates are 5 % to 10% for 
gallbladder  cancers and 10 % to 40% for cholangiocarcinomas.
1,2,[ADDRESS_638320] for cure in patients with unresectable perihilar or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The benefit of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in quality of resection as well as survival is limited. Thus, systemic therapy, largely relied on cytotoxic chemotherapy, remains a necessary component of treatment both for recurrent disease or for tumor s advanced at 
diagnosis.
2 Currently, the FDA  approved agents that are used to treat  cholangiocarcinoma 
include gemcitabine , capecitabine, cisplatin , oxaliplatin , fluoropyrimidines (including 5-
Fluorouracil [5- FU]), or a combination of these. However, it is important to note that none 
of these agents is FDA approved primarily  for use  in biliary tract cancers.[ADDRESS_638321] treatment for advanced or metastatic BTC. A randomized Phase 2 study was conducted in 410 patient s with locally advanced or 
metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer and ampullary cancer to receive cisplatin (25 mg/m
2) followed by [CONTACT_35421] (1000 mg/m2) on Days 1 and 8 every 
21 days or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. A significant 
benefit in both response rate and progression free survival (PFS) was seen favoring the gemcitabine/ cisplatin arm. Furthermore, median overall survival (OS) was 11.7 months 
in the gemcitabine /cisplatin group compared with 8.1 months in the gemcitabine -only

events (AE s) for the combination arm when compared with the single -agent.  
While cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are useful in the treatment of biliary tract 
cancers, the magnitude of their beneficial effects is less than desired. Targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_496463]. Targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], perhaps in 
combination with cytotoxic agents , may be the most promising advancement in this tumor 
type.

The human EGFR family consists of four members: HER1 (EGFR), HER2 (c -erbB -2), 
HER3 (c -erbB -3) and HER4 (c -erbB -4). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] , HER2, and 
HER4 are single -pass transmembrane glycoprotein receptors, members of the type I 
receptor tyrosine kinase family. Upon ligand binding, their activation induces the homo- 
or hetero -dimerization  and subsequent phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosines, which 
lead to both cell proliferation and survival and therefore cancer development and progression. Aberrations in EGFR family members play a role in the development and progression of many human cancers.
5,6,7,[ADDRESS_638322] 
demonstrated clinical efficacy in cancer treatment. Thus, a simultaneous inhibition of EGFR, HER2 , and HER4 represents a new therapeutic approach for broadly targeting

Varlitinib is a potent, small-m olecule, adenosine triphosphate -competitive inhibitor of the 
receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR, HER2, and HER4. ASLAN believes that varlitinib  is a 
compound that may be beneficial to patient s with cancer by [CONTACT_496516].

was seen with twice daily (BID) doses of 100 mg/kg and once daily doses of 200 mg/kg 
in the EGFR- driven A431 tumor xenograft model of epi[INVESTIGATOR_131715].  
Toxicity studies have been conducted in Sprague -Dawley rats (acute and repeat dose) and 
cynomolgus monkeys (repeat dose). The main observed adverse effects in both species were gas trointestinal disturbances, soft stools, weight loss, mild clinical chemistry, and 
hematology changes and partially reversible histopathological alterations.  
The administration of varlitinib  at doses up to 60 mg/kg was tolerated in most animals in 
an extensive panel of safety studies. The overall conclusion from safety studies is that varlitinib  has an acceptable safety profile for administration in human cancer patients at 
the proposed doses. 
Details of the full varlitinib nonclinical program are presented in the IB.

of 31 December 2016, a total of 345 patients with solid tumors had been administered 
varlitinib  at total daily doses ranging from 50  mg to 1200 mg.  
Completed single -agent studies of varlitinib include a Phase 1 dose -escalation and 
expansion study of the ditosylate salt capsule (Clinical Study ARRY -0501), a Phase 1 
dose- escalation study of the free base tablet (Clinical Study ARRAY -543- 103), and a 
Phase 2a study of the tolerability and biological activity of the free ba se tablet (Clinical 
Study ASLAN001 -001). Completed combination studies of varlitinib as a free base tablet 
include a Phase 1 dose -escalation combination study with docetaxel (Clinical Study 
ARRAY-543- 104), a Phase 1 dose -escalation combination study with c apecitabine 
(Clinical Study ARRAY -543- 204), and a Phase 1 dose -escalation combination study with 
gemcitabine (Clinical Study ARRAY -543- 206). The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) has 
been determined for varlitinib as a single agent and in combination with [ADDRESS_638326] chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (docetaxel, capecitabine, and gemcitabine) in patients with advanced solid tumors. Ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_638327] cancer, and gastric cancer.  
Evaluation of the efficacy of varlitinib in the clinical studies conducted to date has demonstrated that partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), as defined by [CONTACT_496517] (RECIST ) has been observed with varlitinib in each 
clinical study to date. In one study (ARRAY -543- 103), the incidence of stable disease 
was higher in the varlitinib 500 mg BID cohort than the varlitinib 300 mg or 400 mg BID 
cohorts.

Adverse events of diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting have been reported frequently across 
all studies conducted with varlitinib. The time of onset of these AEs has been variable with the majority of epi[INVESTIGATOR_496465] -emetic and anti -diarrheal 
medicatio ns. Dermatological AEs have been reported during varlitinib therapy including 
rash, erythematous rash, papular rash, macular rash, maculopapular rash, exfoliative rash, skin exfoliation, dermatitis acneiform, and acne. If symptoms are not adequately controlled with symptomatic treatment, a dose holiday (either with or without subsequent dose reduction) may be required.  
Elevation in serum liver transaminases ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] and/or aspartate 
aminotransferase [ AST ]) and cases of hyperbilirubin emia have been observed in some 
patients receiving varlitinib. Levels of ALT, AST, conjugated and total blood bilirubin as 
well as signs and symptoms of liver toxicity should be monitored during varlitinib treatment.  Cases of increased serum creatinine hav e been observed particularly when 
varlitinib is administered with platinum- based chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Appropriate monitoring 
of renal function is recommended. 
Prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) by >  60 milliseconds (msec) from 
baseline has been observed in [ADDRESS_638329] in the observed QTc prolongation events.

3.2.3 Known or Potential Risks of Varlitinib 
Varlitinib has demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in nonclinical toxicology studies 
and in the completed Phase  1 and Phase 2A studies in humans. However, as with any new 
investigational drug, unexpected AEs may occur with the use of varlitinib. The following is a summary of potential risks ; additional details are presented  in the IB
10: 
• Varlitinib must not be admin istered to pregnant or nursing women 
• Varlitinib exposure is negatively influenced by [CONTACT_3252] -administration of  proton pump 
inhibitors, H2 antagonists, and co- medications that increase gastric pH  
• Varlitinib may cause a drug -drug interaction with other medication s that are 
CYP3A4, CYP2C8, or CYP2C9 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates. Due to the potential for drug interactions based on in vitro screens, concomitant use of

recorded during the entire clinical study 
• Signs of gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting) should be 
monitored in patient s receiving varlitinib. However, prophylactic anti -emetics are 
usually not required with varlitinib administration  
• ALT, AST, and bilirubin along with signs or symptoms of liver toxicity should be monitored during varlitinib treatment 
3.2.4 Known or Potential Risks of Capecitabine 
In this study, varlitinib will be co -administered with capecitabine. Refer to the XELODA

alternatives. First- line therapy is often a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin, as 
recommended in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN ) guidelines. A 
standard second- line therapy for BTC has not been established and no drug is currently 
approved in the US for this indication. In the ABC -02 study, approximately 15% of the 
patients were treated with 5 -FU-based chemo¬therapy as second -line treatment after 
progression from the gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) regimen, with a median OS of 
11.2 months (Valle et al. 2010). There is data suggesting that the 5- FU principle may be 
useful in BTC, such as the S -[ADDRESS_638331] been conducted to directly compare the second -line chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_496466] (supportive therapy) and it is necessary to investigate whether the second -line chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_496467]. The NCCN  
recommend s monotherapy or combination of the following agents indicated for 
unresectable biliary cancer: gemcitabine, capecitabine, cisplatin, oxaliplatin , and 
fluoropyrimidine (including 5-FU). These agents, however, are not prioritized agents for biliary cancer approved by [CONTACT_1622].  
The second- line a gents for biliary cancer differ  in each country, but capecitabine is one 
of the common options at the present. Capecitabine is an oral fluorouracil prodrug that undergoes enzyme conversion to 5-FU in the body and is use d for advanced biliary cancer 
off-label in accordance with the NCCN guideline, because of the limited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_496468]. From the above, ASLAN consi ders that v arlitinib in combination 
with capecitabine can provide even more benefits to patients with biliary tract cancer . 
Varlitinib has demonstrated tumor shrinkage responses and durable disease stabilization in BTC in ongoing Phase IB safety and tolerability studies in Singapore (ASLAN001 -
002SG) and Taiwan (ASLAN001-002).

its approvability for marketing. The control will be capecitabine plus placebo. 
The proposed dose of var litinib is 300  mg BID.  The MTD of varlitinib in combination 
with capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 BID was determined to be 400 mg BID based on previous 
studies of the combination therapy ( ARRAY-543-204). Considering that patients with 
BTC who have failed one line of systemic therapy are usually frail with multiple co -
morbidities, the dose of varlitinib selected for this study is 300 mg BID in combination 
with capecitabine.  
The dosing schedule of capecitabine selected for this study will be capecitabine at 
1000 mg/m2 BID for [ADDRESS_638343] period in 3 -week cycles. The 
dosage, PK, and safety of capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 BID, Day [ADDRESS_638344] period) ha ve been established in the ARRAY -543- [ADDRESS_638345] cancer (ASLAN001 -003) and in a study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) where 
capecitabine was used in combination with lapatinib in metastatic breast cancer .11,13 
Study ASLAN001-009 is anticipated to be conducted worldwide with approximately 20% 
of the patients from US sites.  
This study will commence initially with a Safety lead -in group designed as a single arm, 
open label study to assess the safety of varlitinib plus capecitabine i n a small set of 
patient s (12 to 20) prior to commencing Part 1 in a larger study population  (n=120) . A 
DSMB will review safety data on 2 occasions (refer to Section  7.2) to monitor the safety 
of patient s. Part 2 (n=350) of the study will not commence until the results of Part [ADDRESS_638346] been used to support health authority decisions on drug approvability. 
In Part 1 of the study, for the purpose of marketing approval, a Hochberg proc edure will 
be used to control the overall type I error rate associated with the co -primary endpoints, 
ORR and PFS, at the two- sided 5% level. Using this approach, statistical significance can 
be declared if either  ORR or PFS is significant at the two -sided  2.5% level, or if both 
endpoints are significant at the two- sided 5% significance level.  For significance at the 
2-sided 5% level, the study  has approximately 80% power to detect a 20% difference in 
ORR, assuming a 10% response rate for the control arm. S imilarly, for significance at the 
two-sided 5% level, 84 PFS events would provide approximately 80% power to detect a 
true HR of 0.54 (approximately an 84% prolongation in PFS). If statistical significance is 
demonstrated, ASLAN believe s that th ese effect sizes  represent a clinically meaningful 
improvement in efficacy relative to the current care options. This improvement would 
represent a step -change in the treatment options for patients with second line BTC. To 
enable a further illustration of the clinica l benefit realized through the improvement in 
ORR, DoR will be included as a secondary endpoint in the study and will help 
characterize the durability of the observed responses. All radiological data collected in

Patient s who do not comply with the protocol or who withdraw consent will be replaced 
in the Safety lead -in part only. Patient s who stop study drug for any other reasons will not 
be replaced. Withdrawn patient s will not be replaced in Part 1 and Part 2. The reason(s) 
for withdrawal will be documented in the case report form (CRF). 
The sponsor also has the right to terminate the study at any time in case of serious adverse 
events (SAEs) or if special circumstances concerning the study medicat ion or the 
company itself occur, making further treatment of patient s impossible. In this event, the 
Investigators will be informed of the reason for study termination. All patient s receiving 
active treatment and who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], may benefit from continued 
varlitinib treatment, will be offered participation in an open- label extension s tudy where 
only varlitinib will be provided by [CONTACT_496522] a compassionate use 
program governed by [CONTACT_496523] e respective countries.  
Withdraws from participation (follow- up permitted): Patient s withdrawing from the 
study treatment will be encouraged where possible to return to the site for a study follow -
up visit , particularly  for safety evaluations , tumor assessments, and survival follow -up. 
In Part 1 and Part 2 of the study, patient s will be followed up for survival when they 
withdraw from the study treatment every 12 weeks after the end of treatment (EOT) visit until death or up to data cut- off (DCO) of t he study, whichever occurs first.  
In this instance, it is important to note that the patient is ceasing participation, NOT withdrawing consent. 
Radiographic disease progression : Sites should continue to perform radiological 
assessments until disease progression (or death in the absence of progression) in 
accordance with RECIST v1.1. Patient s will be withdrawn from the treatment if there is 
radiological evidence of disease progression as defined by [CONTACT_393] v1.1. Additional 
radiological assessments of disease will not be undertaken unless there is a clinical 
indication (such as additional symptoms or signs). If radiological  progression is equivocal, 
for example within the bounds of measurement error, it is recommended to continue 
randomized study treatment until the next scheduled assessment and reassess. Once permanently discontinued, randomized study medication  cannot be re- started.  
Unacceptable toxicity : If th e symptoms are not controlled with standard treatments and 
are considered to be clinically significant, study therapy will be stopped and the patient

dose interruption/resumption/modification. Patient s removed from study treatment for 
unacceptable toxicity will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the AE.  
Patient s who  are withdrawn from treatment prior to radiographic disease progression 
should continue to be followed until progression in accordance with the study plan. 
Consent Withdrawal : Patient s may withdraw from the study at any time at their own 
request. The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records 
by [CONTACT_496524]. Details of withdrawal 
should indicate whether the withdrawal is from further treatment with study medication  
only or also from study procedures and/or post treatment study follow -up. Patient s who 
request to withdraw from further treatment and study procedures may be followed up for OS (if consented by [CONTACT_4676] s). 
The Investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal  and request that the 
patient  return all unused study medication . The Investigator should also ask the patient  to 
return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow -up with the patient  regarding any 
unresolved AEs. 
Lost to follow -up: If a patient  does not  return for a scheduled visit, every effort should 
be made at least once every month to contact [CONTACT_496525], including 
mandatory telephone contact [CONTACT_496526]; as well as on a case- by-case basis patient  
visit.  All efforts sho uld be documented in the patient ’s medical source record. Patient  is 
considered lost to follow -up if patient  cannot be reached after [ADDRESS_638357] administration of study medication , 
where possible. If the Investigator is unable to complete the safety follow -up visit 
assessments, the reason(s) must be recorded in the eCRF. All AEs/SAEs will be collected 
until [ADDRESS_638358] agree to use adequate contraception (as listed in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 3

ASLAN001 -009 Version  6.0 Page  56 of 140  
 
Confidential © 2018 ASLAN Pharmaceuticals Pte. Ltd., all rights reserved  No special procedures for the safe hand ling of varlitinib are required.  
Capecitabine  
It is recommended that capecitabine is stored , as per the instruction on the package 
insert, at 25 °C (77 °F); excursions permitted to 15 to 30°C (59  to 86°F) . 
The storage area of the study center  has to be a secure, temperature controlled, locked 
room with restricted access.  Study centers will be required to keep a temperature log 
to establish a record of compliance with these storage conditions.  
Accurate records must be kept regarding dispensing  and return of study medication for 
each individual patient  in the study. Reasons for inconsistency from the expected 
dispensing or return of study medication must be recorded. The Sponsor will be 
permitted upon request to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing procedures and records.  
5.4.4 Packaging and Labeling 
All packaging and labeling operations will be performed according to Good 
Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products and the relevant regulatory requirem ents. 
Varlitinib , matching placebo and capecit abine tablets  (Part 1 and 2 only*)  are packaged 
in 
DosePak wallet with Child-Resistant ATSM Index class XIIIA re -closable semi rigid 
blister packaging . 
*Since  each site’s pharmacy will be suppl ying their own capecitabine  in the Safety lead -in 
part of the study and after the Part 1 DCO, the packaging and labeling will be dependent on 
their selected brand.  
5.4.5 Method of Assigning Patient s to Treatment Groups  
Safety Lead- in: 
The Safety Lead -in part of the study has a non-randomized single arm design. All eligible 
patient s will receive varlitinib 300 mg BID, every day plus capecitabine 1000  mg/m2 BID, 
Day [ADDRESS_638363] period (21- day cycle).  
Each patient ’s eligibility will be reviewed by [CONTACT_496529]. Patient s will be sequentially enrolled after being screened for eligibility and 
providing consent. 
At screening, potential patient s will be assigned a unique screening number that starts 
with “S” and 4 digits (i.e., S1001) manually or by [CONTACT_496530].  
In the case of discontinuation of chemotherapy due to toxic effects, varlitinib or placebo 
therapy will be continued until disease progression, the development of unacceptable 
toxicities , or withdrawal of consent or death .

Lead -in and who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], may benefit from continued varlitinib 
treatment, will be offered participation in an open- label extension study where only 
varlitinib will be provided by [CONTACT_456]; or be managed under a compassionate use 
program governed by [CONTACT_496531]. 
Parts 1 and 2: 
At the initial screening visit, the Investigator or suitably trained delegate will: 
1. Obtain signed ICF (main study) from the potential patient  before any study 
specific procedures are performed.  
2. Potential patient s will be assigned a unique screening number that starts with “S” 
and 4 digits (i .e., S1001) by [CONTACT_496530]. This screening number 
will be sequential from S afety lead -in, and will not be repeated. 
3. Determine patient  eligibility. See Section  5.3.2 and Section  5.3.3.  
4. Once the patient  is confirmed to be eligible, the Investigator or suitably trained 
delegate will a ssign eligible patient  a unique randomization number via 
Randomization and Trial Supply Management (RTSM) system. Randomization 
numbers will start with “R” followed by 4 digits (i .e., R1001 for part 1, R2001 for 
part 2 ) and will be assigned strictly sequentially by [CONTACT_496532] (starting at R1001, 
R2001 in part 1 and 2, respectively ), as patient s are eligible for randomization. 
This number is the patient ’s unique identifier and is used to identify the patient  
with the assigned treatment. This randomization number will be available to th e 
Investigator in the electronic data capture system.  
5.4.[ADDRESS_638364] been met.  For Part 1 
only, this includes receiving eligibility confirmation from the ICR.  
Patient s who satisfy all the entry criteria will be centrally assigned to study treatment by 
[CONTACT_496533], according to the randomization scheme generated by [CONTACT_1701].  
Patient s will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either varlitinib or placebo, both on a 
background of capecitabine (n=120 for Part 1 and n=350 for Part 2). The randomization scheme will be stratified by [CONTACT_716] 2 covariates:  
• Geographical region - US or ROW  
• Primary tumor location – gallbladder (GB) or non -GB 
The actual treatment given to patients will be determined by [CONTACT_496534]. The randomization scheme will be produced using SAS® version 9.4, which  
incorporates a standard procedure for generating randomization numbers. One randomization list will be produced containing sufficient random numbers for each of the [ADDRESS_638365] in order to minimize any imbalance in the number of patient s assigned 
to each treatment group. 
The dose and regimen of randomized therapy to be administered is as follows:

• Placebo BID, every day  
Patient s in both arms will receive background chemotherapy with capecitabine 
1000 mg/m2 BID , Day [ADDRESS_638366] peri od (21- day cycle).  
Patient s will be identified to the Centralized Randomization Center  using site number, 
screening number, randomization number, gender, and date of birth. Patient s will be 
randomized strictly sequentially within each stratum, as patient s are eligible for 
randomization. The RTSM will inform the Investigator of the Kit ID number to be 
allocated to the patient  at each dispensing visit via electronic data capture (EDC).  
Study medication should only be dispensed to each  randomized patient  at the Cycle [ADDRESS_638367] only be administered in the morning of Cycle 1 Day 1 after 
pre-dose assessment (e .g., safety laboratory sampling, electr ocardiogram [ECG], PK 
sampling) are completed . The day on which a patient takes the first dose of study 
medication  will be considered Cycle 1 Day 1 .  
The Kit ID number dispensed at each visit will correspond to the treatment to which the 
patient  was origin ally randomized.  
If a patient discontinues participation in the study, then their screening/randomization number cannot be reused.  
5.4.7 Selection of Doses in the Study  
Varlitinib  
The MTD of varlitinib in combination with capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 BID was 
determined to be 400 mg BID  in a previous stud y of the varlitinib/capecitabine 
combination therapy ( Study ARRAY -543-204). Considering that patients with BTC who 
have failed one line of systemic therapy are usually frail with multiple co -morbiditie s, the 
dose of varlitinib selected for this study is [ADDRESS_638368]  12 patient s in the S afety lead -in, prior to randomization of patient s 
in Parts 1 and 2 of the study.  
Capecitabine  
In this study capecitabine will be administered as 1000 mg/m2 BID for [ADDRESS_638369].  Refer to Table 5  for the dose calculation.  Capecitabine tablets are 
available in 2 dosage strengths, 500mg and 150mg. In order to allow improved patient compliance and to be in line with routine clinical prac tice, it is allowed for patient to be 
dosed with ± 5% deviation from the Dose per administration (mg) listed in  Table 5 to 
reduce number of c apecitabine tablets used.

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Toxicities 
Management of Gastrointestinal Toxicities attributable to Varlitinib  
Diarrhea:  
For the management of diarrhea  for patient s in this study, routine loperamide prophylaxis 
as a standby  [INVESTIGATOR_198379]. The recommend dose of loperamide is 2 mg three times a 
day (TID). Buscopan or a similar antispasmodic agent is recommended for management 
of acute symptoms. The recommended initial dose of Buscopan is 20 mg T ID and can be 
escalated to 20  mg QID . 
The pharmacologic interventions for treatment emergent diarrhea should include: 
First line therapy – loperamide 
• If receiving routine loperamide prophylaxis, increase dose to a maximum of 
16 mg/day . 
• If new -onset diarrhea, take loperamide [ADDRESS_638381] bout of diarrhea followed 
by 2 mg every 4 hours or after every unformed stool (maximum 16 mg/day). 
Continue until diarrhea-free for 12 hours. 
• With recovery to < Grade 1, take loperamide 2 mg TID.  
As a second line therapy for the treatment of diarrhea refer to Table 8 .

Nausea/Vomiting: 
Both varlitinib and capecitabine are considered to have low to minimal emetic risk. 
Routine prophylaxis for nausea/vomiting is not recommended . Anti -emetic medications 
can be used on an as -needed basis (PRN). If nausea/vomiting recur in later cycles of 
treatment, prophylactic medications can be used on the discretion of Investigator. Several 
anti-emetic drugs have QT prolongation effe cts and therefore are not allowed in the Safety 
lead-in part of this study , which will assess the QTc prolongation effect of study 
medications.  The recommended management of nausea/vomiting is listed in Table 9 .  
*Metoclopramide, dolasetron, g ranisetron , and ondansetron are prohibited in the Safety 
lead-in (Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 2 Day 1 ) and Part 1 (C ycle 1 Day 1 to C ycle 2 Day 1) of

Varlitinib  
Varlitinib may cause a drug -drug interaction with other medications that are cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) 3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates. 
Human CYP3A4 is the major route of metabolism of varlitinib, whereas CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 are minor routes. Due to the potential for drug interactions based on in vitro screens, concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and P -gp inducers 
or inhibitors will be recorded during the entire clinical study. Refer to the FDA ’s Drug 
Developmen t and Drug Interactions: Table of Substrates, Inhibitors and Inducers.
14 
Examples of CYP2C8 substrates are:  
• amodiaquine (antimalarial, anti- inflammatory)  
• serivastatin (statin)  
• paclitaxel (chemotherapeutic)  
• repaglinide (antidiabetic)  
• torasemide (loop diuretic) 
• sorafenib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) 
• rosiglitazone (antidiabetic) - converted to active metabolites  
Examples of strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (one that causes a > 5 -fold increase in the plasma 
area under the plasma concentration -time curve  (AUC ) values or more tha n 80% decrease 
in clearance ) are:  
• gemfibrozil (hypolipi[INVESTIGATOR_901])

ASLAN001 -009 Version  6.0 Page  70 of 140  
 
Confidential © 2018 ASLAN Pharmaceuticals Pte. Ltd., all rights reserved  Examples of moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (one that causes a > 2- fold increase in the 
plasma AUC values or 50 % to 80% decrease in clearance):  
• trimethoprim (antibiotic)  
Examples of CYP2C8 inhibitors with unspecified potency: 
• thiazolidinediones (antidiabetic) 
• montelukast (leukotriene receptor antagonist) 
• quercetin (anti -inflammatory) Examples of CYP2C8 inducer: 
• rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513] (antibiotic)  
Varlitinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 with an IC50 of  3.2 µM and 10.6  
µM, respectively. Its plasma protein binding is higher than 99% so the free fraction of 
varlitinib in the blood is not likely to reach that concentration. 
In the Safety Lead -in and Part 1 of the study, non- excluded drugs that are associated with 
torsade de pointes and QTc prolongation ( Appendix 14.4) or QT Prolongation without 
torsade de pointes ( _Drugs_that_Prolong Appendix 14.5 ) should be at steady -state dosing 
for at least [ADDRESS_638393] 
dose to up to and including Cycle 2 Day 1, the dose of such drugs should not be increased , 
and new drugs in either group should not be initiated without approval from medical 
monitor. 
In addition to the above, in the Safety lead -in and Part 1 of the study, from  Cycle 2 Day 
2 onwards, the dose of drugs associated with torsade de pointes and QTc prolongation 
(Appendix 14.4) or QT prolongation without torsade de pointes ( Appendix 14.5) ideally 
should not be increased. E very attempt should be made to minimize the initiation  of such 
drugs ( Appendix 14.4 or Appendix 14.5). The initiation of any such drugs 
(Appendix 14.4 or Appendix 14.5) requires the medical monitor’s approval.

7.1.1 Safety Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
Adverse Event D efinition  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study patient  
administered a medicinal product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not it is related to the 
medicinal (investigational) product. This includes an exacerbation of pre- existing 
conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction or the significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded elsewhere in the CRF under specific efficacy assessments . Fluctuations of pre -existing conditions that do not 
represent a clinically significant exacerbation or worsen ing need not be considered  AEs.  
Surgical procedures planned before enrol lment of the patient  in the study are not 
considered AEs if the condition(s) was known before study inclusion. In the latter case, the medical condition should be reported in the patient ’s medical history.  
Progression of the cancer of target disease under study is generally not considered an AE. 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to document all AEs that occur during the study . 
AEs will be elicited by [CONTACT_99020]  a non- leading question; for example, “Have you 
experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?” Adverse event s should be reported on t he appropriate page of the CRF.  
Serious Adverse Event Definition  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that, at any dose,  
• Results in death. 
• Is life -threatening (an AE is life -threatening if the patient  was at immediate risk 
of death from the event as it occurred, i .e., it does not include a reaction that might 
have caused death if it had occurred in a more serious form).  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. (Complications occurring during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68430] .) 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacit y. (An AE is incapacitating 
or disabling if it results in a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the patient ’s ability to carry out normal life functions).  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

Confidential © [ADDRESS_638420], or precaution that may be associated with the use of the study medication . 
Events related to disease progression will not be reported as SAEs unless the events lead 
to death , and the death will be reported as an SAE. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496471]: 
• Reasons described in the protocol (i.e., drug administration, protocol required 
procedures); 
• Surgery or procedure planned prior to entry into the study; 
• Surgery or procedure planned for pre-existing conditions that do not worsen after 
entry into the study; 
• Social/administrative reasons (i.e., due to distance between home and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496472], etc.). 
Assessment of Severity  
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study using the CTCAE 4.03 criteria. The a ssessments will be based on the 
Investigator’s clinical judgment. The severity of each AE and SAE recorded in the CRF 
should be assigned to one of the categories: 
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated 
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231320]; disabling; 
limiting self -care activities of daily living  
Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
Grade 5:  Death related to AE  
All changes in severity must be recorded in the eCRF. 
Assessment of C ausality 
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_209214], if any, 
to the  investigational product  (varlitinib/placebo) and the background therapy

Confidential © 2018 ASLAN Pharmaceuticals Pte. Ltd., all rights reserved  (capecitabine) . For both investigational product and background therapy , causality should 
be assessed using the categories presented as follows : 
Definitely  Related:  A clinical  event,  including clinical  laboratory test abnormality,  
occurring in a plausible time relationship  to the medication  
administration,  and which  cannot  be explained by [CONTACT_496541].  The response to withdrawal  of the drug  
should be clinically  plausible.  
Probably  Related:  A clinical  event, including clinical laboratory test abnormality, with 
a reasonable time sequence to the medication  administration,  
unlikely to be attributes  to concurrent disease  or other drugs or  
chemicals,  and which  follows a clinically  reasonable response on  
withdrawal.  
Possibly  Related:  A clinical  event, including clinical laboratory test abnormality, with 
a reasonable time sequence to the medication  administration,  but 
which  could  also be explained by [CONTACT_496542].  Information  on the drug withdrawal  may be lacking  
or unclear.  
Unlikely  Related:  A clinical  event, including clinical  laboratory test abnormality, with 
little or no temporal relationship  to medication  administration,  and 
which  other  drugs, chemicals  or underlying disease  provide  
plausible explanations.  
Not Related:  A clinical  event,  including clinical laboratory test abnormality  that 
has no temporal  relationship  to the medication  or has more  likely  
alternative etiology. 
NOTE: AEs listed as ‘possibly , probably or definitely’ related to the investigational 
product are considered to have a suspected ‘reasonable causal relationship’ to the 
investigational product. A dverse event s listed as ‘unlikely  or unrelated ” are considered 
have a suspected “un related” causal relationship to the investigational agent/intervention.  
Action Taken  
The Investigator will describe the action taken in the appropriate section of the CRF, as 
follows: 
• None 
• Varlitinib/placebo permanently withdrawn  
• Capecitabine permanently withdrawn 
• Varlitinib/placebo  temporarily interrupted  
• Capecitabine tempor arily interrupted  
• Varlitinib/placebo dose modified  
• Capecitabine dose modified  
• Concomitant medication /therapy  
• Other, specify.

the allowable window of time to complete the ECGs , will be described in the ECG manual.  
The ECG machines supplied by [CONTACT_496546] , and  the digital files of each tracing will be archived . 
General Principles ( Safety Lead -in and Part 1) 
The following parame ters will be assessed: heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, QT cF (Fridericia’s 
formula), and QTcB (Bazzett’s formula) . While the Investigator (or a qualified observer 
at the investigational site) will interpret the ECG using one of the following categories: within nor mal limits, abnormal but not clinically significant, or abnormal and clinically 
significant, the final ECG assessments (including interval measurements) will be made 
by [CONTACT_496547].  
Baseline will be defined as the mean of the triplicate QT/QTc readings performed pre-
dose on Day 1. On Day 1 , pre-dose is defined as 2 sets of triplicate ECGs taken 45 minutes

to create the baseline values.  Similarly, for all other time  points, for each ECG parameter,  
each patient ’s mean will be calculated from the triplicate readings and the mean value 
will be used . 
 
Safety Lead -In 
Any analysis of ECG data from the Safety lead -in is considered exploratory.  
On Cycle 1  Day 1 and Day 8, the following parameter will be determined at the following 
time points:  
- Absolute heart rate, pulse rate, QRS, QT/QTc values at [ADDRESS_638427] dose  
- Heart rate, pulse rate, QRS, QT/QTc change from baseline at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
8.5, and [ADDRESS_638428]-dose 
 
QTc will be reported for both Fridericia and Bazett’s corrections . 
Triplicate ECGs will also be collected [ADDRESS_638429]- dose Day 22 (Cycle 2 Day 1)  and 
onwards every cycle  while the subject remains in the study. 
Due to the non-randomized, open label design of the Safety lead- in, data from the Safety 
lead-in will be presented separately from data from Part 1 of the study. Furthermore, 
ECG/QT out puts will be made available to the DSMB for consideration when 
determining whether the study should progress to Part 1. 
Part 1  
The Part 1 electrocardiographic Core ECG Laboratory assessments constitute the study’s primary assessment of ECG/QTc.  The time -based electrocardiographic analysis  will be 
performed in Part 1  at baseline, Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 8, and safety follow -up visit.

The PK of varlitinib (and any relevant circulating metabolites) , capecitabine and 5 -FU 
(active metabolite) will be determined at selected time points. The following PK parameters will be evaluated where possible:  
Cycle 1 Day 1, Day 8 , and Day 14: 
• maximum plasma concentration (C
max) 
• time to C max(tmax) 
• plasma concentration before next dose (C trough) 
• area under the plasma concentration -time curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC 0-τ) 
• half-life (t 1/2) 
• apparent clearance (Cl/F)  
• apparent volume of distribution (V z/F) 
• apparent volume of distribution at the steady state (V ss/F) 
where τ = 12 hours (dosing interval)  
 Cycle 1 Day 8  
• accumulation ratio of AUC
0- τ (RacAUC 0- τ) (Day 8/Day 1)  
• accumulation ratio of C max RacC max (Day 8/Day 1)

Using appropriate PK software depending on whether comprehensive PK sampling or 
sparse PK sampling is obtained in practice, the PK data will be used to derive PK parameters such as, but not restricted to, C
max, AUC , and t 1/2 for varlitinib.  
Population PK evaluation in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study will be performed by [CONTACT_496550] (NLME) using NONMEM program version VII (Globomax LLC, Ellicott City, MD, US ) and SAS
® Version  9.2 or higher (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North 
Carolina, US). Actual elapsed time from dosing  will be used for final plasma PK 
parameter calculations.  
The final PK analyses will be the responsibility of the CRO. Pharmacokinetic analyses 
will be conducted according to CRO Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for PK analyses unless otherwise specifi ed. The actual PK sampling times will be used in the PK 
calculations.  
The varlitinib concentration- time profiles, along with the derived PK variables, will be 
listed for each patient  per dose and dosing day and summarized appropriately. Population 
PK mode ls may be used to derive the PK parameters and will aim to characterize 
variability in the population by [CONTACT_496551], age, smoking status and/or concomitant medications. In addition, if the data are suitable, potential relationships between plasma varlitinib and efficacy or safety endpoints will be investigated using a graphical approach and/or appropriate PK/PD modeling techniques.

8.1 General Statistical Considerations 
All statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_1701] , using SAS®, version 
9.3 or higher.  
Unless specified otherwise, data from the Safety lead -in, Part 1, and Part 2 of the study 
will be presented separately in the tables , figures , and l istings . Patient s whose data 
contributed to the Part 1 analysis will not be included in the Part 2 analysis. For Parts 1 and 2, for the purpose reporting all FAS and EFR --based endpoint s (efficacy 
data and demography), Study Day  1 is defined as the date of randomization to study 
treatment. For visits (or events) that occur on or after randomization, study day is 
defined as (date of visit [event] -date of randomization + 1). For visits (or events) that 
occur prior to randomization, study day is defined as (date of visit [event] - date of 
randomization). There is no Study Day 0.  For Parts 1 and 2, for the purpose of reporting all safety set based endpoints (e.g. AEs, laboratory findings, vital signs, ECG, exposure and dose intensity) and PK set- based 
endpoints, Dose Day  [ADDRESS_638451] dose of study treatment (referred to 
in the protocol as Cycle 1 Day 1). For visits (or events) that occur on or after first dose, dose day is defined as (date of visit [event] -date of first dose of study treatment + 1). For visits (or events) that occur prior to first dose, dose day is defined as (date of visit [event] -date of first dose of study treatment). There is no Dose Day 0. For listings (such 
as for AEs) that include the derivation of “days since last dose,” this is defined as (event date -date of last dose). Events that occur on the same day as the last dose of study drug 
will therefore be described as occurring zero days from the last dose of study drug.  The database for the Safety  lead-in will be locked at the  time of the Part [ADDRESS_638452] Patient i n or when 
70% of the patient s (84 patient s) have experienced a PFS event. The primary analysis of 
all primary and secondary endpoints, with the exception of OS, will be performed at this 
time.  
For Part 1, a  preliminary analysis of OS will be performed at the time of the primary 
analysis of ORR and PFS. It is anticipated that the OS data at this time will be immature, 
thus a second analysis of OS is planned for when approximately 95 patients (approx. 79%) have an OS event. The second analysis of OS will be considered the primary analysis of 
OS for the trial.

including ORR, PFS and DoR, will be reported at the time of the prim ary analysis of OS.  
8.2 Sample Size Derivation  
8.2.1 Safety Lead- in Sample Size  
The Safety lead -in is not formally powered to assess any statistical hypotheses. In this 
part, 12 to 20 eligible patient s (6-12 from US, 6-8 from ROW) will be enrolled to receive 
varlitinib plus capecitabine. 
Patient s in this group will be replaced if study medication  compliance is < 85% in the 
first 14 days. 
8.2.2 Part 1  Sample Size  
Part 1 is designed with co- primary endpoints ORR and PFS. In order to maintain an 
overall, 1- sided 10% type I error rate for Part 1, a Hochberg procedure15 will be used, 
such that the study will be deemed to have met its primary objective if either endpoint is 
significant at the 1-sided 5% level or if both endpoints are significant at the 1-sided 
10% significance level.  
One hundred and twenty patient s provide approximately 80% power to detect a true 
difference of 17% in response rate, based  on a 1-sided 5% significance level and assuming 
10% response rate for the placebo group and a 27% response rate for varlitinib. To ensure 
the adequate data are available to evaluate the effects of varlitinib on both co -primary 
endpoints, the DCO  for the primary analysis will be the later of [ADDRESS_638454] patient  
in and when 70% of patient s (84 patient s) have experienced a PFS event.  Based on a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_638455] a 
minimum of 80% power to detect a true HR of 0.58 for PFS based on a 1-sided 5% 
significance level.  
Furthermore,  if the primary objective of the study is met, the following approach to type 
I error control will be applied in order to support marketing approval: 
• The overall type I  error rate for marketing approval will be controlled at the two -
sided 5% level, using a Hochberg procedure  
• Using this approach, statistical significance may be claimed if either  ORR or PFS 
is significant at the two -sided 2.5% significance level or if both ORR and PFS are 
significant at the two -sided 5% significance level.   
One hundred and twenty patient s provide approximately 80% power to detect a true 
difference of 20% in response rate, based on a 2-sided 5% significance level and assuming 
10% response rate for the placebo group and a 30% response rate for varlitinib.

ASLAN001 -009 Version  6.0 Page  100 of 140  
 
Confidential © 2018 ASLAN Pharmaceuticals Pte. Ltd., all rights reserved  A total of 84 PFS events provides 80% power to detect a true HR of 0.54, based on a two-
sided 5% significance level. Assuming a 8-month non- linear recruitment period, a 2.[ADDRESS_638456] 
patient  is randomized into the study ( first patient  in). 
Overall Survival is a secondary endpoint in Part 1. A preliminary analysis of OS will be 
performed at the time of the primary analysis of ORR and PFS. It is anticipated that the OS data at this time will be immature, thus a second analysis of OS is planned  for when 
approximately 95 patients (approx. 79%) have an OS event. Due to the number of OS events expected at the time of the first analysis, this initial analysis of OS will be considered exploratory only. Although a p- value may be presented, for the purpose of 
marketing authorization, no claims of statistical significance will be based on the initial analysis. For the purpose of type I error control across the two analyses of OS in support 
of marketing authorization, the OS update analysis will be considered the primary analysis of OS for Part 1 of the study, and statistical significance will be assessed at the 
two-sided 5% significance level.  
8.2.3 Part 2  Sample Size  
Part 2 is designed with a primary endpoint of OS. Approximately 350 patient s will be 
randomize d into Part 2 to obtain 247 death events (70% maturity). If the true OS HR for 
the comparison of varlitinib+capecitabine versus placebo+capecitabine is 0.7 (likely to correspond to a 43% prolongation of OS), the study has 80% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference for OS, assuming a 2-sided 5% significance level.  
Assuming non- linear recruitment of [ADDRESS_638457] 1 dose of randomized therapy (or study medication in the Safety lead -in) and will be the primary analysis set for the assessment of safety and 
tolerability in the study.  
For the purpose of data summaries, patient s will be included in the safety population 
according to the treatment arm and dose level initially received, regardless of any 
subsequent dose adjustments.

ASLAN001 -009 Version  6.0 Page  101 of 140  
 
Confidential © 2018 ASLAN Pharmaceuticals Pte. Ltd., all rights reserved  8.3.2 Full Analysis Set  
For each part of the stud y, the  full analysis set is based on the intention- to-treat principle 
and includes all randomized patient s (or treated patient s for the Safety  lead-in) analyzed 
in accordance with the intended treatment arm, regardless of the treatment actually 
received.   
With the exception of Part 1, Tumor Size which is not considered a key secondary 
endpoint (See Section 8.4.6 and [IP_ADDRESS]), for all study parts, the primary analysis of all 
primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, will be based on the full analysis set  (FAS).  
8.3.3 Evaluable for Response Set  (Part 1 only) 
The EFR set is defined as a subset of the FAS and includes patients with measurable disease at baseline, as determined by [CONTACT_496552], version 1.1. For Part 1 only, a sensitivity analysis of ORR and DCR will be performed in the evaluable for response (EFR) set to investigate the impact of patients without measurable disease on the primary endpoint. Since measurability is an inclusion criteria, all patients  in Parts [ADDRESS_638458] measurable disease at baseline. Thus, if no 
patients were randomised in error, results in the EFR set will not be presented.  
Since tumor size is an endpoint based on patients’ tumor measurements, it can only be 
defined for the subs et of the FAS with measurable disease at baseline. Thus the EFR set 
will be the primary analysis set used for the assessment of tumor size for Part 1 (See Section 8.4.6). 
8.3.4 Per Protocol Analysis Population 
The per protocol (PP)  analysis population is defined for Part 1. Efficacy is not the focus 
of the S afety lead -in and Part 2 will be assessed on an intention- to-treat basis only . Thus 
PP analyses are not required for the S afety lead -in and Part 2 of the study. 
The PP analysis p opulation will include all randomized patient s according to the 
treatment actually received, and excluding any patient s with major deviations.  Major 
deviations that would lead to exclusion from the PP  analysis population include:  
• Patient s who did not have the intended disease (failure of inclusion criteria 2)  
• Subjects who did not have the intended indication, i.e. were not second line 
patients (failure of inclusion criteria 3)  
• Patient s who did not received any randomized therapy  
• Patient s with baseline radiological scan performed before the start of 
protocol- specified in terval prior to randomization  
• Patients who did not have measurable disease at baseline as determined by [CONTACT_89169]  
• Subjects who have not received at least six doses of gemcitabine in a first line 
setting (i.e. failure of inclusion criteria 4, protocol version 4.0 onwards)

ASLAN001 -009 Version  6.0 Page  102 of 140  
 
Confidential © 2018 ASLAN Pharmaceuticals Pte. Ltd., all rights reserved  • Subjects with multiple ( ≥2) peritoneal metastases at baseline or ascites at baseline 
which cannot be attributed to a non- malignant cause (i.e. failure of exclusio n 
criteria 3, protocol version 4.0 onwards), based on ICR review 
• Subjects with baseline albumin <3 g/dL (failure of the albumin component of 
inclusion criteria 9c)      
In addition to the programmatic determination of the major deviations, monitoring notes or summaries will be reviewed to determine any important post entry deviations that are not identifiable via programming, and to check that those identified via programming are correctly classified.  The final classification will be made blinded, prior to d atabase lock.  
Patient s who received the incorrect randomized therapy should be included in the PP 
analysis set according to the therapy actually received.  Similarly, subjects who were mis -
stratified at randomization will be included in the PP analyses acc ording to the correct 
stratification levels, regardless of the levels declared at randomization.  
Failure of an inclusion/exclusion criterion will not automatically be classified as a major 
deviation. 
The PP analysis population will be the used to assess the sensitivity of the Part [ADDRESS_638459] one usable PK profile. All PK data will be analy zed according to treatment 
received.  
For the Safety lead -in, this population will comprise all data patient s who receive study 
treatment as per protocol (300 mg BID) and did not violate or deviate from the protocol 
and planned dosing regimen (300 mg) in ways that would significantly affect the PK 
analyses (for example skippi[INVESTIGATOR_49837], or taking reduced doses or taking concomitant medications with the potential to cause a drug -drug interaction) during the PK sampling 
period. Patient s who did deviate from the planned dosing regimen may still provide some 
data for inclusion in the PK set if they have at least one usable PK profile. The population, and decisions regarding which profiles are usable, will be defined by [CONTACT_496553], Pharmacokineticist, and Statistician prior to any analyses being performed.  
PK sampling of all patients is planned for Part  [ADDRESS_638460] , and Statistician. Since the PK sample analysis may be performed 
following the primary analyses of efficacy, the CRO responsible for the analysis of the

8.4 Study Endpoints  
8.4.1 Objective Response Rate 
Objective response r ate is a co -primary endpoint in Part 1 and a secondary endpoint in 
Part 2, and the S afety lead -in cohort. 
Objective response rate is defined as the number (%) of patient s with at least o ne visit 
response of CR or PR. Data obtained up until progression, or last evaluable assessment

irrespective of whether or not patient s discontinued treatment or received a subsequent 
therapy prior to progression. For a ll study parts, ORR will be evaluated based on the FAS 
set (Section  8.3.2).  
8.4.2 Progression -Free Survival  
Progression- free survival  is a co -primary endpoint in Part 1, and is a secondary endpoint 
in Part 2. 
Progression- free survival  is defined as the time from randomization (or start of treatment 
in the Safety lead -in) until the date of objective disease progression or death (by [CONTACT_31617] c ause 
in the absence of disease progression) regardless of whether the patient  withdraws from 
randomized therapy (study treatment in the Safety lead -in) or receives another antitumor 
therapy  prior to disease progression. Patient s who have not experienced di sease 
progression or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date 
of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST assessment. However, if the patient  
progresses or dies after [ADDRESS_638462] version  1.1 assessment. 
The PFS time will always be derived based on the scan/assessment dates rather than visit dates and the following rules will be applied: 
• Date of disease progression will be determined based on the earliest  of the dates of 
the component that triggered the disease progression, i .e., if both the target lesions 
and the non-target lesions indicate disease progression but were scanned on different 
days, the earlier of the 2 dates would be applied. 
• When censoring a patient  for PFS , the patient  will be censored at the latest  of the dates 
contributing to a partic ular overall visit assessment.  
For Part 1, the co- primary endpoint, PFS, will be derived programmatically using  data 
from the ICR. To support sensitivity analyses, PFS will also be derived programmatically using the site assessments of the Part 1 radiological data.  
For Part 2 and the Safety lead -in, PFS will be derived programmatically using the site 
radiological d ata.  
Further detail s will be provided in the SAP. 
8.4.3 Overall Survival 
Overall survival is a secondary endpoint in Part 1, and the primary endpoint in Part 2 of 
the study.

response. 
8.4.5 Disease Control Rate 
Disease control r ate is a secondary endpoint in all study parts. 
Disease control rate is defined as the number (%) of patient s with at least one visit 
response of CR or P R, or with stable disease for a minimum o f twelve weeks (±  5 days) 
from randomiz ation (Parts 1 and 2) or starting treatment (Safety lead- in only). Data 
obtained up until progression, or last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, 
will be inclu ded in the assessment of DCR. This will be irrespective of whether or not 
patient s discontinued treatment or received a subsequent therapy prior to progression. For 
all study parts, DCR will be evaluated based on the FAS set ( Section  8.3.2) . For Part 1, 
DCR will be calculated based on the ICR data. For Part 2 and the Safety lead -in, DCR 
will be calculated from the site radiological data.

Confidential © 2018 ASLAN Pharmaceuticals Pte. Ltd., all rights reserved  8.4.6 Tumor Size  
The percentage change from baseline in tumor size at Week 12 (%ΔTS Wk12) is a 
secondary endpoint for Part 1, and will be used to help evaluate the exploratory objectives 
of investigating the possible role of baseline biomarker levels a s predictors of clinical 
benefit. It will be evaluated using the Evaluable for Response set (EFR) ( Section  8.3.3). 
Tumor size is not considered to be a key secondary endpoint; for the purpose of marketing authorization, no statistical claims will be made based on tumor size.   
The %ΔTS
Wk12 will be defined as follows: 
• Baseline tumor size: defined as the sum of longest diameters of target lesions at 
baseline  
• Week 12 TS: defined as the sum of longest diameters of target lesions at week 12

An increase from baseline of 20% will be imputed for any patient s who die by [CONTACT_55544], 
or withdraw from the study due to symptomatic disease  progression prior to Week 12. 
Any patient s who withdraw from the study due to radiological disease progression prior 
to Week 12 will be included in the analysis, and will be assigned a percentage change 
from baseline of 20%, or the value that was observed at the time of disease progression 
(whichever is larger). Full details of data imputation rules will be provided in the SAP. 
8.4.7 Safety Endpoints  
Patient  safety will be evaluated based on physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure 
[systolic and diastolic], heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature), ECG 
parameters, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), and AEs.

[CONTACT_134210] 1-sided p- value.  
The conditional maximum likelihood estimate of the odds ratio will be presented together 
with its exact 2 -sided 95% confidence  limit, which excludes one if and only if the 
stratified exact binomial test is significant at a  2-sided 5% level. Corresponding 
significance levels and confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated using tests performed 
at a 1 -sided 10% level. The 1- sided  p-value will also be presented.  
To test for heterogeneity across strata, the exact test of Zelen18 will be  performed testing 
whether the treatment effect differs between the 2 strata included in the primary analysis.  
For Part 1 only, subgroup analyses will be conducted comparing ORR between treatments in the subgroups of the FAS set defined by [CONTACT_496555], Region (US/Non- US) and primary tumor location (GB/Non -GB), plus the 
following factors:

negative)  
• Any HER positivity ( positive defined as + or higher by [CONTACT_69153]1, HER2,  
HER3, HER4 , or otherwise negative) 
Note: The sub-group analyses based on IHC biomarker data will be reported outside of 
the main CSR.  
 Other baseline variables may also be included if there is clinical justification or an imbalance is observed across the treatment arms. For each sub -group, the odds ratio and 
corresponding 80% CI will be presented on a forest plot including the odds ratio and 80% 
CI from the overall population. Additionally, if the primary analysis of ORR is significant at the 2-sided 5% level in the overall population, the forest plot will be replicated using 
95% CI . 
No adjustment to the significance level for testing will be made since all these analyses will be considered supportive of the primary analysis of ORR.

by [CONTACT_496558], with one that excludes the interaction terms and will be assessed at the 2 -sided 10% significance level. If the fit of the model is not significantly 
improved then it will be concluded that overall the treatme nt effect is consistent across 
the subgroups. 
If the global interaction test is found to be statistically significant, an attempt to determine 
the cause and type of interaction will be made. Stepwise backwards selection will be performed on the saturated model, whereby (using a 10% 2- sided level throughout) the 
least significant interaction terms are removed one -by-one and any newly significant 
interactions re -included until a final model is reached where all included interactions are 
significant and all ex cluded interactions are non -significant. Throughout this process all 
main effects will be included in the model regardless of whether the corresponding interaction term is still present. This approach will identify the factors that independently alter the treatment effect and prevent identification of multiple correlated interactions.  
Any quantitative interactions identified using this procedure will then be tested to rule out any qualitative interaction using the approach of Gail and Simon .

8.5.2 Secondary Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Endpoints 
Progression -free survival based on site assessments  
In all study parts, PFS based on the site review of radiological data is a secondary endpoint. 
PFS based on site data will be analy zed using the same model and methodology as 
described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for PFS based on ICR. 
Further details will be provided in the SAP. 
Duration of Response 
The DoR will not be formally analyzed. Duration of response  will be listed and presented 
using KM curves. Descriptive statistics, based on the KM estimates, will be presented by 
[CONTACT_1570].  
Overall Survival (Part 1) In Part 1, OS will be analy zed using the methods described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for PFS. 
OS will be analyzed twice. The initial analysis of OS will be performed at the time of the 
primary analysis of ORR and PFS. Due to the number of OS events expected at the time of the first analysis, this initial analysis of OS will be considered exploratory only. 
Although a p- value may be presented, for the purpose of marketing authorization, no 
claims of statistical significance will be based on the initial analysis. A further OS upda te

stratified exact binomial test is significant a 2 -sided 5% level. Corresponding significance 
levels and CIs will be calculated using tests performed at a 1 -sided 10% level. The 1-
sided p-value will also be presented. 
To test for heterogeneity across strata, the exact test of Zelen will be performed testing 
whether the treatment effect differs between the 2 strata included in the primary analysis.  
Tumor Size  
The percentage change from baseline in tumor size at Week 12 ( %ΔTS Wk12) is a 
secondary endpoint for Part 1. Tumor size is not considered to be a key secondary 
endpoint; for the purpose of marketing authorization no statistical claims will be based on tumor size. 
Tumor size will be presented graphically using waterfal l plots for each treatment arm, 
presenting each patient ’s Week [ADDRESS_638472] decrease.  Reference lines at the 
+20% and –30% change in tumor size levels will be added to the plots, which correspond 
with the definitions of disease progression and PR, respectively. In these waterfall plots, 
the patient s whose Week [ADDRESS_638473] percentage change from baseline will also be presented, as 
described above for the Week 12 percentage change from baseline.  
Tumor size will also b e used to help evaluate the exploratory objectives of exploring 
relationships between baseline biomarker levels and clinical outcomes (e .g., baseline 
HER2 status and clinical outcome, and other HER family statuses and clinical outcomes).  
In line with the exploratory objectives of the study , the statistical analysis of tumor size 
in Part 1 will be also be used to help evaluate the role of HER family expression levels

3. For each biomarker sub- group, or combination of biomarkers identified on the 
prospectively defined list (step 1), if at least  15 patients  in the EFR population are 
determined to be expressors, then the role of that biomarker as a predictor of 
clinical outcome (tumor size) will be evaluated as descr ibed below. 
For each biomarker of interest (or combination of biomarkers), the absolute values at baseline and Week 12, along with the percentage change from baseline target lesion size at Week 12 will be summarized using descriptive statistics and presented by [CONTACT_496559].  
The number and percentage of patient s in each treatment arm whose Week 12 data is 
imputed will also be presented ( split by [CONTACT_496560] -group). 
The effect of varlitinib on percentage change in tumor size  will be estimated from an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model fitting the Week 12 percentage change from 
baseline as the response variable, and treatment, primary tumor location (GB/Non -GB),  
baseline biomarker status (positive or negative), the interaction treatment x baseline biomarker status, baseline tumor size, and the time from the baseline scan t o 
randomization as covariates. 
The significance of the interaction term will be evaluated at the 1-sided 10% level to 
determine whether there is evidence of a treatment by [CONTACT_496561]. Regardless 
of the significance of the interaction term, the number of patient s, unadjusted mean and 
adjusted least squares (LS) means for each treatment arm will be presented for each level 
of biomarker status factor  (positive or negative), together with the difference in adjusted 
LS means between treatment arms for each level of the biomarker status factor and 
corresponding p-value and 80% and 95% CI s for the difference.  
If the interaction term is not significant at the 1-sided 10% level, the number of patient s, 
unadjusted mean and adjusted least squares (LS) means for each treatment arm will also be presented together with the difference in adjusted LS  means between treatment arms 
and corresponding p-value and 80% and 95% CI s for the difference.  
If, at blind review, it is judged that the data do not adequately follow a normal distribution 
assumption, then a log- transformation may be used. Specifically in place of percent 
change in Week 12 value the AN COVA model will use loge (Week 12/baseline). In this

 Central Tendency Analysis will be performed for both the Safety lead -in and Part 1  of the 
study , the change from baseline in QTcF, PR, QRS, QTcB, and heart rate, will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_7206] (and treatment arm for Part 1) using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, min, median, max, 90% confidence intervals).   For both the Safety lead- in and Part 1, the following categorical data will be summarised : 
- The proportion of patients obtaining treatment -emergent absolute QTcF values > 450 
msec and ≤ 480 msec; > 480 msec and ≤ 500 msec; and > 500 msec 
- The proportion of patients obtaining a QTcF increase from baseline values ≥ 30 and <60 msec and ≥ 60 msec 
- The proportion of patients obtaining a QRS change from baseline > 25% resulting in 
QRS >  120 msec 
- The proportion of patients obtaining a PR interval change from baseline >25% reaching a value >220 msec  
- The proportion of patients obtaining a >  25% decrease from  baseline in heart rate

corresponding confidence interval and p- value. Interaction term, time 
point x treatment, will be also evaluated if the data allow.  
 
2. ANOVA comparison of the absolute values of ECG parameters as well as change from baseline (ΔECG) between t reatments for each post -
dose time point assessed separately in order to separate the varlitinib effect from that of capecitabine. The ECG parameter values will be log-transformed and the resulting output will include the geometric 
mean ratio for test vs re ference with the corresponding confidence 
interval and p -value.  ΔECG will be tested as untransformed and log-
transformed parameters to avoid bias from discarding 0 ΔECG values from the comparisons. 
 
3. Exposure- Response Analysis:  Linear mixed effect model b etween 
ΔQTcF and time matched concentrations of varlitinib and other potential metabolites if measured and as appropriate.  Other ECG variable may be similarly analyzed and other models used, if appropriate. 
3.1 ΔQTcF will be calculated as the difference between each time point value and the average baseline value for each arm with the combination varlitinib/capecitabine treatment.  
 
3.2 ΔΔQTcF will be calculated for each patient in the combination arm individually as  the difference between the ΔQTcF value for 
the arm with combination varlitinib/capecitabine treatment and the average value of all patients in the capecitabine alone arm matching time point. Other ECG parameters may also be used in the analysis including QTcB, heart rate, etc to provide supporting information.

5. Different covariates may be included in the complex models in addition to the base model as fixed effects such as time point in order to ensure the model  feasibility and to evaluate covariates influential to ECG 
parameters.  
The results of the fitted models will be presented using statistical parameters such as the geometric mean ratios and corresponding confidence intervals (for ANOVA) and estimates of the  slope, and associated confidence interval for the linear mixed effect 
models.  In addition, the following graphic exploration of the exposure -ECG relationship may be 
performed:  
• Residual plots to predict results  
• Double Y plots with time on the X axis and time matched values of PK 
concentrations for varlitinib and capecitabine on the Y1 axis, ΔECG on the Y2 axis to determine the possibility of hysteresis between drug concentration and cardiodynamic effects  
• Regression/scatter plots with time matched co ncentrations of varlitinib and 
capecitabine on the X axis and ΔECG on the Y axis • Regression/scatter plots with varlitinib or capecitabine non -compartmental PK 
parameters of C
max, Ctrough,  AUC tau and others on the X axis and maximum ΔECG on the

Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228- 247, 2009]. Changes in the largest diameter  
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.   A sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions  will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph 
nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any 
objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.

ABSTRACT 
Patients with recurrent osteosarcoma have a very poor prognosis and limited treatment options. It is a 
priority to identify novel agents with evidence of clinical activity in osteosarcoma. This is a prospective 
single arm, open-label, pha se 2 trial of RANKL antibody, denosumab, in recurrent osteosarcoma with 
osteosarcoma-specific cohorts and osteosarcoma-specific endpoints. Patients will enroll on either the 
measurable disease cohort or the completely resected disease cohort. All patients will receive subcutaneous 
denosumab every 4 weeks with a loading dose on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1. Endpoints for the cohort with 
m
easurable disease (Cohort 1) are the disease control rate at 4 months as compared to historical COG 
experience or objective response rate . The endpoint for the fully resected cohort (Cohort 2) is the disease 
control rate at 12 months as compared to historical COG experience. Secondary objectives include 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability of denosumab in patients with recurrent 
osteosarcoma. Biological markers, particularly RANK and RANKL expression will be explored.

2.0 BACKGROUND 
 
The 5-year and 10-year overall survival for patients with localized osteosarcoma is 
approximately 70% and 65% respectively.1-[ADDRESS_617162] 
therapy with high-dose methotrexate, adriamycin and cisplatin. The Children’s Oncology 
Group (COG) Bone Tumor Committee plans to continue to investigate the impact of the 
addition of targeted agents to standard osteosarcoma chemotherapy in patients with 
localized osteosarcoma. The primary challenge is a paucity of pre-clinical and clinical data 
for targeted agents with demonstrated activity against osteosarcoma. The COG phase [ADDRESS_617163] decade 
include ADVL0122 (imatinib), ADVL0421 (oxaliplatin), ADVL0524 (ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575]) and 
ADVL0525 (pemetrexed). Unfortunately, there was no evidence of objective drug activity 
in the osteosarcoma str atum for any of these trials. That being said, objective radiographic 
responses are rare in osteosarcoma for agents with known activity against osteosarcoma in 
the neoadjuvant setting. The lack of objective anti-tumor activity is likely due to the nature 
of the intratumoral stromal tissue that contains calcified bone matrix. Consequently, in this 
phase 2 trial of denosumab, an additional end point, believed to be more appropriate for 
as
sessment of activity in osteosarcoma will be utilized. 
 
Prognosis for patients with recurrent osteosarcoma is poor. Subjects enrolled on 
INT-0133 who experienced recurrence had an overall survival rate of 20% at 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1321 
Version date: 10/22/[ADDRESS_617164] surgical approach to resection given that in 50% of cases more nodules 
are discovered on surgical exploration than were present on radiographic imaging. 
However, the rarity of this disease process, coupled with differing institutional 
biases and retrospective reviews on thoracic surgical management have 
contributed to a lack of unity in surgical approach. There are no prospectively 
collected data regarding management of pulmonary metastases in recurrent 
osteosarcoma.   
 
In order to determine the historical disease control rate in patients with recurrent 
osteosarcoma enrolled on COG  phase 2 trials a retrospective analysis of data for 
all eligible patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma enrolled on A09713, 
ADVL0122, ADVL0421, ADVL0524, ADVL0525, CCG-0962, P9761 and P9963 
was performed. For each patient identified, event-free survival (EFS), defined as 
time from study enrollment until date of last contact, date of disease progression 
or detection of disease at a previously uninvolved site, or date of death was 
ca
lculated. Patients who died or experienced disease progression were considered 
to have experienced an EFS event; otherwise, the patient was considered censored 
at the date of last follow-up. EFS as a function of time since study enrollment was 
estimated according to the method of Kaplan and Meier. The equality of the hazard 
rate for EFS-event across studies was tested using the log-rank test. The potential 
prognostic factors for risk of EFS-event that were examined included: (1) study; 
(2) age; (3) number of prior chemotherapy regimens; (4) sex; and (5) race.  
 
Ninety-six (96) patients were identified for inclusion in this dataset, 95 of whom 
with some follow-up for EFS, and 93 with an EFS event. Two (2) patients were 
reported as alive and without EFS-event at 8 and 46 months after enrollment. Both 
were enrolled on ADVL0421. The EFS for patients with recurrent osteosarcoma 
enrolled on these seven closed phase 2 studies from the COG or its predecessor 
groups was 12% at 4 months with a 95% C.I. of 6-19%. There was no significant 
difference in the EFS across the different studies. The characteristics such as age, 
gender, race, and the number of prior chemotherapy regimens did not have any 
effect on EFS.  
 
In addition, in an attempt to gain some insight into how our analysis of COG data 
might compare to data for relapsed osteosarcoma outside of COG we have 
evaluated a report from the Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group (COSS). In a 
2005 analysis, Bielack et al presented data for patients with relapsed 
osteosarcoma.6 Although the overall survival was very poor for patients with 
unresectable disease, overall survival at 2 years of 4%, it is not possible to make a 
valid comparison of this data to the COG data due to the differences in the data 
including a different start time (time of recurrence vs. time of enrollment on a 
phase 2 trial) and different reported outcome (overall vs. event-free survival). The 
COG data are more relevant to the patient population to be enrolled to Cohort 1 of 
this study (measurable disease).   
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1321 
Version date: 10/22/18  Page 11  
 
For patients with fully resected disease (Cohort 2 of this study), the EFS data of 
patients enrolled on AOST0221, a phase [ADDRESS_617165] possible outcome. 
The intervention in AOST0221 (inhaled GMCSF) was determined to lack activity 
on the basis of the primary outcome measure. An improvement in outcome above 
the baseline determined by [CONTACT_480271]0221 would likely represent denosumab activity. 
Forty-two patients were enrolled on AOST0221. The 12 month EFS was 20% with 
a 95% confidence interval of 10-34%. In an attempt to gain some insight into how 
our analysis of COG data might compare to data for relapsed osteosarcoma outside 
of COG we have evaluated the 2005 report from the COSS. Two-year EFS in 
patients who achieved a second complete resection was 33%. Again it is not 
possible to make a valid comparison of this data to the COG data due to the 
difference in start time (time of recurrence vs. time of enrollment on a phase 2 
trial). The COG data are more relevant to the patient population to be enrolled to 
Cohort 2 of this study.   
 
Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to the receptor activator of 
nuclearfactor-κB ligand (RANKL). It is approved by [CONTACT_480272]-related events in adults with solid tumor bone metastases (Xgeva) and for 
adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumor of bone that is 
unresectable or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity and 
treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy refractory to bisphosphonate therapy. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Denosumab PK/PD 
Denosumab is administered subcutaneously and has a long half-life. The 
bioavailability following subcutaneous administration is 62%. The FDA 
approved dose for skeletal related events in patients with bone metastasis 
is 120 mg every 4 weeks. In phase 1 studies of denosumab in adults 
wei
ght based doses up to 3 mg/kg were well tolerated. Subsequent 
studies utilized a fixed dose as high as [ADDRESS_617166] stage of 
Cohort 1 (Stratum 1) will be required to be less than 18 years of age at 
enrollment. As discussed in Section 2.1.2 , analyses of a group of patients

Version date: 10/22/[ADDRESS_617167] cancer 
and bone metastases, the median reduction in urinary N-
telopeptides/creatinine (uNTx/Cr) was 82% within [ADDRESS_617168] cancer receiving concurrent chemotherapy, the 
median duration of time to achieve > 65% reduction in uNTx/Cr was 9-
13 days depending on the denosumab dose.15  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Denosumab Toxicity 
Denosumab-associated toxicity is limited. At the [ADDRESS_617169] common adverse effects are hypocalcemia and 
hypophosphatemia with incidences of 18% and 32%, respectively. 
Serum calcium concentrations of < 7 mg/dL occurs in 3.1% of adults . 
Hypocalcemia is observed particularly during the first [ADDRESS_617170] marketing setting, severe symptomatic 
hypocalcemia has been reported, including fatal cases. In clinical studies 
of subjects without advanced cancer with varying degrees of renal 
function (including patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine 
clearance < 30 mL/min] or receiving dialysis), there was a greater risk 
of developi[INVESTIGATOR_480260], 
and in the absence of calcium supplementation. Therefore, pre-existing 
hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with 
denosumab [ADDRESS_617171] 
weeks of initiating therapy. In addition, a transient increase in bone 
remodeling associated with significant hypercalcemia following 
discontinuation of denosumab has been reported to occur. This off-
treatment hypercalcemia has been observed up to 8 months after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_480261].19,20 
 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been observed at a rate similar to that seen 
with bisphosphonates (2.2%). ln three phase 1 active-controlled clinical 
trials in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone, ONJ was 
confirmed in 1.8% of subjects in the denosumab 120 mg group (median 
exposure of 12.0 months; range 0.1 -40.5) and 1.3% of subjects in the 
z
oledronic acid group. The trials in subjects with breast or prostate 
cancer included a denosumab 120 mg extension treatment phase (median 
overall exposure of 14.9 months; range 0.1-67.2). The subject-year 
adjusted incidence of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first year of 
treatment and 4.1% thereafter. The median time to ONJ was 20.6 months 
(range: 4 - 53). In clinical trials, the incidence of ONJ was higher with 
longer duration of exposure. Poor oral hygiene, invasive dental

Version date: 10/22/[ADDRESS_617172] also been reported in patients with certain 
comorbid conditions (e.g. vitamin D deficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, 
hypophosphatasia) and with use of certain pharmaceutical agents (e.g. 
bisphosphonates, glucocorticoids, proton pump inhibitors). These events 
have also occurred without antiresorptive therapy.  
 
Hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, has been identified as 
an adverse drug reaction. Musculoskeletal pain, including severe cases, 
has been identified as an adverse drug reaction based on data from the 
postmarketing setting. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Data Regarding Long-term Denosumab 
Studies of longer-term denosumab administration are just reaching 
maturity. Safety data are now available for a phase 3 study (vs. 
zolendronic acid) of prevention of skeletal-related events. In contrast to 
zoledronic acid, denosumab did not require monitoring or dose 
modification/withholding based on renal status, and was not associated 
with acute-phase reactions. Hypocalcaemia was more common for 
denosumab. Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred at a similar rate 
(P = 0.13). The median number of denosumab doses received by 
[CONTACT_480273] 13, equal to 52 weeks of treatment. Rates 
of
 adverse events were not increased in the denosumab group.23  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Data Regarding Denosumab in children and adolescents 
Denosumab (120 mg) has been administered to 10 skeletally mature 
adolescents with giant cell tumor of bone in a prospective open-lable 
phase 2 study and in children.24 In this open label phase 2 study, in Giant 
Cell Tumor of Bone, including 10 adolescents, adverse events were 
consistent with the known safety profile of denosumab. In addition there 
are case reports of 2 children who received denosumab: one with 
metastatic giant cell tumor of bone and one with McCune-Albright 
syndrome.19,20  
 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1321 
Version date: 10/22/[ADDRESS_617173] precursors 
differentiate and become activated resulting in bone resorption.25  
 
Osteosarcoma expresses both RANK and RANKL. In one set of studies, RANK 
was expressed in 57% of human osteosarcomas, most human osteosarcoma cell 
lines and 70% of canine osteosarcomas including [ADDRESS_617174] form 
showed little to no RANK expression in human osteosarcoma tumor cells, though 
> 50% of tumor associated osteoclasts or osteoclast precursors expressed RANK.28 
This same study identified osteosarcoma tumor cell RANKL expression in 65-75% 
of human osteosarcoma samples. Expression was generally less intense compared 
with positive control samples from giant cell tumors of bone. Another study 
reported that RANKL is expressed in 75% of human osteosarcoma tumor 
specimens and the strength of expression is associated with prognosis.[ADDRESS_617175] in 
osteosarcoma is provided by a transgenic mouse model of osteosarcoma. In this 
mouse model, expression of the SV40 T/t antigen from the osteocalcin promoter 
results in highly penetrant osteosarcoma. In this model, heterozygous deletion of 
Prkar1a  accelerates development of osteosarcoma via increased RANKL gene 
expression. A subset of human osteosarcomas have low Prkar1a expression and 
high RANKL expression.[ADDRESS_617176] 
utilized other approaches to inhibit RANKL activity including osteoprotegerin 
(OPG), a decoy receptor for RANKL, RANK-Fc, a chimeric protein that 
efficiently binds RANKL, or SiRNA directed against RANKL. In a murine 
orthotopic osteosarcoma model, OPG gene therapy decreased primary and 
metastatic tumor burden: Mice receiving OPG gene transfer did not develop 
osteosarcoma lung metastases while 80% of control mice developed lung 
metastases.34 A study by [CONTACT_480274]-Fc confirmed these original 
findings.35  
 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1321 
Version date: 10/22/[ADDRESS_617177] contradictory results. 
In one experiment, gene therapy with RANK-Fc did not seem to improve survival 
from lung metastases in mice following retro-orbital injection of osteosarcoma 
cells.35 However, experiments by [CONTACT_480275]-Fc 
decreases migration and invasion in vitro and leads to a decreased metastatic tumor 
burden in vivo.36 In addition, in transgenic mice that develop ed osteosarcoma 
following deletion of Rb, p53 and Prkar1a  administration of RANK-Fc resulted in 
improved survival (R. Khokha, unpublished data). In these two in vivo models, 
there is evidence of activity of RANKL-directed therapy in osteosarcoma that has 
metastasized to extra-skeletal locations. It is not clear which tumor model or which 
method of interfering with RANKL will be representative of denosumab activity 
in osteosarcoma metastatic to extra-skeletal locations in humans. Because of the 
limitations mentioned above, additional in vivo  testing of denosumab by [CONTACT_480276] (PPTP) or other investigators is unlikely to 
proceed. Consequently, the Bone Tumor Committee feels the existing pre-clinical 
data are sufficient to support a phase 2 study of denosumab in patients with 
recurrent osteosarcoma with extra-skeletal metastases.  
 
In summary, a breadth of pre-clinical data demonstrates a role for RANK-RANKL 
signaling in osteosarcoma and supports a potential benefit of denosumab for 
patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma. The pre-clinical studies in 
murine models are summarized in the table below:

4.0 TREATMENT PLAN 
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established 
standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from prot ocol directed therapy 
and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family 
logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable (except 
where explicitly prohibited within the prot ocol).  
 
All subjects will receive denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks. Two additional 
loading doses will be given on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 (Weeks 2 and 3) only. In the 
absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity denosumab may be continued for 
up to [ADDRESS_617194]. 
 
O
ther therapy: Although not encouraged, subjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_617195] 2 weeks after surgery. Denosumab 
therapy will be held during radiation and may be resumed upon completion of the radiation 
treatment course. If the patient has not recovered from surgery within 6 weeks the patient 
will go off protocol therapy. Surgery or radiation performed in a patient who does not 
achieve a confirmed  complete or partial response will render the patient inevaluable for 
disease control assessment and the patient will go off protocol therapy. 
 
Please note: Avoid invasive dental procedures during treatment with denosumab 120 mg. 
For patients in whom invasive dental procedures cannot be avoided, the clinical judgment 
of the treating physician should guide the management plan based on individual 
benefit/risk assessment. In addition, administration of denosumab will be withheld 30 days 
prior to any elective invasive oral/dental procedure and until documentation of complete 
mucosal healing following any invasive oral/dental procedure.

7.0 EVALUATIONS/MATERIAL AND DATA TO BE ACCESSIONED  
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established 
standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy 
and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family 
logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable (e xcept where 
explicitly prohibited within the protocol).  
 
Subjects who discontinue investigational product will have an End of Treatment visit 
approximately [ADDRESS_617217] (see below). 
Thereafter, they will complete safety follow-up visits approximately every month for the 
first year off protocol therapy. Serum calcium should be checked at each safety follow-up 
visit due to possible occurrence post-treatment hypercalcemia. Reporting of adverse events 
observed at safety follow-up visits is as per Section 11.[ADDRESS_617218] X

9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Cohort 1 (Evaluation of Aim 1.1.1): A maximum of [ADDRESS_617220] response evaluable patients 
will be enrolled. Only those patients enrolled in Stratum 1 will be considered eligible for 
Stage 1 of Cohort 1. 
 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1321 
Version date: 10/22/18  Page 36  
Each patient will be evaluated for both outcome measures: (1) disease control success; and 
(2) RECIST response (CR or PR v. not CR or PR). If [ADDRESS_617221] responses are observed, we will conclude 
denosumab is not associated with sufficient activity for further single-agent investigation. 
Otherwise, we will conclude denosumab is associated with sufficient activity for further 
single-agent investigation.   
 
Each patient enrolled will be evaluated for: (1) complete or partial response as defined by 
[CONTACT_480280] (denoted as R below); or (2) stable disease four months 
after study enrollment (denoted as S below). We will not be interested in promoting the 
agent for further investigation if the probability of response in any particular individual is 
less than or equal to 0.05 (P(R)≤0.05) and the probability of remaining analytic event free 
in any particular individual is less than or equal to 0.20 (P(S)≤0.20). We will be interested 
in promoting the agent for further investigation if the probability of response in any 
particular individual is at least 0.20 (P(R)≥0.20) or the probability of remaining analytic 
event free in any particular individual is at least 0.40 (P(S)≥0.40).

Cohort 2 (Evaluation of Aim 1.1.2):  The primary outcome measure is disease control 
during the first [ADDRESS_617222] 12 months of enrollment, if the patient’s protocol therapy is terminated 
for reasons other than death or disease progression prior to the completion of 12 months of 
therapy (‘evaluation period’).  
 
Each patient enrolled will be evaluated for stable disease after 12 cycles of study therapy. 
We are not interested in promoting the agent for further investigation if the probability of 
remaining analytic event free in any particular individual is less than or equal to 30%. We 
will be interested in promoting the agent for further investigation if the probability of 
remaining analytic event free in any particular individual is at least 50%. The statistical 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1321 
Version date: 10/22/18  Page 37  
analysis of prior phase 2 COG studies demonstrates that the current point estimate of the 
12 month EFS is 0.2 with an upper 95% confidence bound of approximately 30%, so the 
target [ADDRESS_617223]. If 15 or fewer of th e 
planned 39 patients in this cohort demonstrate disease control at 12 months, denosumab 
will not be considered for further development in this cohort, otherwise, denosumab will 
be considered of sufficient activity to warrant further study. If all 39 patients are enrolled 
and the true 12 month disease control probability is 30%, the therapy will not be considered 
for further development with probability 0.91. If all 39 patients are enrolled and the true 
12 month disease control probability is 50%, the therapy will be considered for further 
development with probability 0.90. Enrollment will be terminated in this cohort with the 
conclusion that denosumab will not be considered for further development if, at any time, 
more than [ADDRESS_617224] recurrence, initial 
diagnosis of metastatic disease and site of initial recurrence (lung only, bone only, lung 
and bone, other). For categorical characteristics, we will estimate the relative hazard rate 
and 95% confidence interval associated with the various categories using the proportional 
hazards regression model with the characteristic of interest as the only variable in the 
model. The logrank statistic will be used to quantify statistical significance. Age at 
enrollment will be treated as a continuous variable and we will also survey the peer-
reviewed literature and test age cutoffs reported in reliable publications. 
 
Cohort 1:  A review of enrollment on COG single-agent phase [ADDRESS_617225] for patient sex or age can be expected 
for enrollment. An assessment of enrollment to ADVL0421, ADVL0524 and ADVL0525 
indicates more than 65% of enrollments conformed to the age and sex requirements for 
AOST1321. More recently, enrollment on AOST1322 was 4.75 patients per month. 58% 
or 2.75 patients per month were under age 18. We assume that as in the predecessor studies, 
only 65% of the enrollees on AOST1321 would meet the developmental age requirements 
of AOST1321. Thus, we expect at least 1.5 patients per month to be enrolled. A maximum 
of 41 outcome evaluable patients will be required in this cohort. Providing for possible 
i
neligible and inevaluable patients, the maximum enrollment will be 46 patients. 
 
With these entry rates, the probability we will accrue 46 patients in 36 months is in excess 
of 93%. The study will likely require at most 3 years to enroll sufficient patients. A 
maximum of 46 patients is anticipated for this cohort. 
 
Cohort 2 : A maximum of [ADDRESS_617226] 1.6 patients per month to be enrolled on study, thus 
enrollment to this cohort is expected to be completed within 2.5 years of opening the study.

Version date: 10/22/18  Page 38  
Evaluability 
Response (Cohort 1 Patients Only): Any eligible patient who receives at least one dose of 
denosumab will be considered evaluable for response with the following exception: if a 
patient receives non-protocol anti-cancer therapy during the response evaluation period 
after the patient is considered as having a partial or complete response but prior to 
confirmation of this status by [CONTACT_293858], the 
individual will be considered inevaluable for the response endpoint. The exception to this 
exception is patients who stop denosumab after the 1st evaluation due to toxicities or death, 
and these patients will be considered evaluable for the response evaluation.  
 
Disease Control (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 Patients): Any eligible patient who receives at 
least one dose of denosumab will be considered evaluable for disease control, with the 
exception noted above for “Response Evaluation”. Only patients who are inevaluable for 
the response endpoint may be replaced for the purpose of the statistical rule.  
 
Aim 1.2.1: To investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 
denosumab in subjects with recurrent osteosarcoma. 
All eligible patients who receive at least one dose of denosumab and for whom at least one 
PK or PD sample is submitted will be considered evaluable for PK or PD, respectively. 
The presentation of PK values will be segregated according to time point at which the 
denosumab was administered. Sample means, medians and variances will be calculated. 
Clearance and volume of distribution will be determined. PD will be characterized by 
[CONTACT_480281]/Cr ratio and c-telopeptide levels. Both of these characteristics will be modeled 
ac
cording to a repeated measures linear regression model. Depending on the fit of the 
quadratic model, additional terms in powers of time since enrollment may be added to 
explore how the PD parameters vary with time. 
 
Aim 1.2.2: Evaluating the Tolerability of Denosumab  
Tolerability of Denosumab - An eligible patient will be considered for toxicity monitoring 
if one of the following occurs: (1) complete one cycle of denosumab prior to receiving non-
protocol anticancer therapy; (2) die on protocol therapy for a reason considered possibly, 
probably or likely related to denosumab; or (3) are removed from protocol therapy because 
of an adverse experience possibly, probably or likely related to denosumab. A toxicity-
evaluable patient will be considered in the analysis during the interval from study 
enrollment until the termination of protocol therapy. A toxicity-evaluable patient will be 
considered to have experienced an excessive toxicity event if: (1) the patient dies on 
protocol therapy for a reason considered possibly, probably or likely related to denosumab; 
or (2) experiences a dose-limiting toxicity. DLTs will be: any ≥ Grade 3 event not 
considered attributable to osteosarcoma except hypocalcemia ≥ Grade 3 corrected with 
medical therapy, hypophosphatemia ≥ Grade 3 corrected with medical therapy, 
≥ Grade [ADDRESS_617227] who previously received Adriamycin and ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_617228] who previously received cisplatin. Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) 
and fractures (excluding pathologic fracture at the site of an osteosarcoma bony metastasis) 
will be considered DLTs and will require cessation of therapy. Serum calcium, magnesium 
and phosphate will be monitored at the start of every cycle and weekly during the first [ADDRESS_617229] to routine AE reporting while on protocol therapy and for up to 30 days off protocol 
therapy. Expedited reporting of serious adverse events according to Section 11  of the 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1321 
Version date: 10/22/18  Page 39  
protocol will continue as long as a patient is considered on study according to Section 8  of 
the protocol. 
 
The analytic unit for monitoring for excessive toxicity will be the patient-cycle: Each cycle 
where the patient receives denosumab and does not receive non-protocol anticancer therapy 
will be considered in the analysis. We will use a Bayesian rule to monitor for excessive 
toxicity. We will assume a beta prior distribution with α=0.6 and =1.4. If this posterior 
probability of the chance of DLT is at least 30% exceeds 80%, we will identify the regimen 
to the COG DSMC, Bone Tumor leadership and CTEP as associated with a toxicity profile 
that may require modification of the regimen. Descriptive analyses of this safety 
information will be performed and will include the incidence of adverse events, severe 
adverse events, serious adverse events, and fatal adverse events. Type, frequency, and 
severity of laboratory abnormalities will also be analyzed. Safety analyses will be 
performed in aggregate, by [CONTACT_9084], and by [CONTACT_551] (≤ 18 years and in patients > 18 years 
of age). The safety of denosumab in adults and adolescents will be compared. In addition 
a subset analysis of the safety of denosumab in patients ≤ 15 years and in patients > 15 years 
of age will be performed.

10.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
 
This study will utilize version 4.0 of the CTCAE of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for 
toxicity and performance reporting. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded 
from the CTEP website  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). 
Additionally, toxicities are to be reported on the appropriate case report forms. 
 
Please note: ‘CTCAE v4.0’ is understood to represent the most current version of CTCAE 
v4.0 as referenced on the CTEP website (ie, v4.02 and all subsequent iterations prior to 
version 5.0). 
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be evaluated for response prior to Cycle 3, 
Cycle 5 and every odd cycle thereafter.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) 
guideline (version 1.1).[ADDRESS_617231] diameter (unidimensional measurement) 
of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are 
used in the RECIST criteria. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable for objective response : See Section 9.3  
 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1321 
Version date: 10/22/18  Page 41  
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable disease : Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_617232] x-ray, as ≥ [ADDRESS_617233] scan, or 
≥ [ADDRESS_617234] 
be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_617235] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 
5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-measurable disease : All other lesions (or sites of disease), including 
small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease. 
Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as 
non-measurable. 
 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither 
measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple 
cysts. 
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered 
as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability 
described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same 
patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions : All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should 
be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline. 
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance 
the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included 
in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any 
objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-target lesions : All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be 
identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1321 
Version date: 10/22/18  Page 42  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, 
absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be 
noted throughout follow-up.  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment. 
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. 
Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_99237](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical lesions : Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable 
when they are superficial (eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) 
and  10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (eg, skin nodules). In 
the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including 
a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Chest x-ray:  Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, 
CT is preferable.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Conventional CT and MRI : This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 
[ADDRESS_617236] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (eg, for body 
scans). 
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, 
and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition 
variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion 
conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is 
variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical 
specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for 
the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, 
the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at 
baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse 
sequence. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe 
specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and 
diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior 
scans. Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning 
techniques, if possible. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ultrasound : Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and 
should not be used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1321 
Version date: 10/22/[ADDRESS_617237] in selected instances. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Endoscopy, Laparoscopy : The utilization of these techniques for 
objective tumor evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques 
may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies 
are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following 
complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cytology, Histology : These techniques can be used to differentiate 
between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare 
cases (eg, residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, 
where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that 
appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met 
criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate 
between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have 
reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum 
diameters. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on 
study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase 
of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of 
one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression). 
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.

Version date: 10/22/18  Page 44  
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph 
nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm 
short axis). 
 
Non-CR/Non- PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal 
limits. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non-target 
lesions. Unequivocal progression  should no t 
normally trump target lesion status. It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, not a 
single lesion increase. 
 
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions 
only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_62484], and 
the progression status should be confirmed at a later 
time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of 
the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on 
the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

11.[ADDRESS_617238] be reported 
in an expedited manner to allow for timelier monitoring of patient safety and care. The 
following sections provide information about expedited reporting. 
 
To ensure compliance with these regulations/this guidance, NCI requires that AEs be 
submitted according to the timeframes in the AE reporting tables assigned to the protocol , 
using the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP-AERS). 
 
Any AE that is serious qualifies for expedited reporting . An AE is defined as any 
untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse drug event 
(experience) occurring at any dose that results in ANY of the following outcomes: 
 
1) Death. 
2) A life-threatening adverse drug experience. 
3) An adverse event resulting in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929] (for ≥ 24 hours). This does not include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6718]. 
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience 
when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition. 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1321 
Version date: 10/22/[ADDRESS_617239] 
administration of the investigational agent/intervention and has an attribution of a 
possible, probable, or definite relationship to the study therapy must be reported 
according to the CTEP-AERS reporting tables in this protocol.  
 
Any AE that results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functions (formerly referred to as disabilities) , 
congenital anomalies or birth defects, must be reported via CTEP-AERS if it 
occurs at any time following treatment with an agent under a NCI, COG, or 
industry sponsor IND/IDE since these are considered to be serious AEs. 
 
Reportable Categories of Death  
o Death attributable to a CTCAE term.  
o Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_31948] 
28 days of life.  
o Sudden Death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the 
onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed 
to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
o Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associated with Grade 5.  
o Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “ Disease 
progression ” in the system organ class (SOC) “ General disorders and 
administration site conditions .” Evidence that the death was a manifestation 
of underlying disease ( e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or 
progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be 
submitted.  
 
Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_617240] dose, regardless of attribution to 
the investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within [ADDRESS_617241] dose of the investigational 
agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational agent/intervention. 
 
A secondary malignanc y is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (eg, treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or 
chemotherapy). A metastasis of the initial neoplasm is not considered a secondary 
malignancy.  
 
All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment need to be reported via 
CTEP-AERS. Three options are available to describe the event:  
Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  
Myelodysplastic syndrome  
Treatment related secondary malignancy  
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1321 
Version date: 10/22/18  Page 48  
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) must 
also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in this protocol. 
 
A second malignancy  is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and 
is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require 
ONLY routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified.  
 
NOTE : When submitting CTEP-AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, 
or “Neonatal loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form, available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/Pregna
ncyReportForm.pdf , needs to be completed and faxed along with any additional 
medical information to ([PHONE_8613]. The potential risk of exposure of the fetus 
to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be documented in 
the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP-AERS report. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy 
Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the 
fetus to agents that may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy needs 
to be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP-AERS as Grade 3 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions -  Other 
(pregnancy )” under the “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
condi
tions ” SOC. 
 
Pre
gnancy needs to be followed until the outcome is known . If the baby 
[CONTACT_170727] a birth defect or anomaly, then a second CTEP-AERS report 
is required. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Loss (Fetal Death) 
Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “ Death in utero. ” Any pregnancy 
loss should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “ Pregnancy loss ” 
under the “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions ” SOC . 
Do NOT report a pregnancy loss as a Grade 5 event since CTEP-AERS 
recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Death Neonatal  
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “ Newborn death occurring during 
the first 28 days after birth ” should be reported expeditiously as Grade 
4 “Death neonatal ” under the “General disorders and administration ” 
SOC when the death is the result of a patient pregnancy or 
pregnancy in partners of men on study . Do NOT report a neonatal 
death resulting from a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men 
on study as a Grade 5 event since CTEP-AERS recognizes any Grade 5 
event as a patient death.

Version date: 10/22/18  Page 49  
 
Although a pertinent positive finding identified on baseline assessment is not an 
AE, when possible it is to be documented as “Course Zero” using CTCAE 
terminology and grade. An expedited AE report is not required if a patient is 
entered on a protocol with a pre-existing condition (eg, elevated laboratory value, 
diarrhea). The baseline AE must be re-assessed throughout the study and reported 
if it fulfills expedited AE reporting guidelines. 
 
a. If the pre-existing condition worsens in severity, the investigator must 
reassess the event to determine if an expedited report is required. 
b. If the AE resolves and then recurs, the investigator must re-assess the event 
to determine if an expedited report is required. 
c. No modification in grading is to be made to account for abnormalities 
existing at baseline. 
 
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between 
treatment cycles/courses.  
ROUTINE reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade 
becomes more severe in a subsequent course. If the grade becomes more severe 
the AE must be reported again with the new grade. 
EXPEDITED reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade 
becomes more severe in the same or a subsequent course. 
 
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves during a cycle/course of therapy 
and then reoccurs in a later cycle/course. 
ROUTINE reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent 
cycle/course must be reported by [CONTACT_293862]. 
EXPEDITED reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent 
cycle/course does not require CTEP-AERS reporting unless: 
1) The grade increases OR 
2) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99205]. 
 
An expedited report may not be required for a specific protocol where an AE is 
listed as expected. The exception or acceptable reporting procedures will be 
specified in the protocol. The protocol specific guidelines supersede the NCI 
Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines. These special situations are listed under the 
CTEP-AERS reporting Table A for this protocol. 
 
Clinical investigators in the treating institutions and ultimately the Study Chair have the 
primary responsibility for AE identification, documentation, grading, and assignment of 
attribution to the investigational agent/intervention. It is the responsibility of the treating 
physician to supply the medical documentation needed to support the expedited AE reports 
in a timely manner.  
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1321 
Version date: 10/22/18  Page 50  
 
Note: All expedited AEs (reported via CTEP-AERS) must also be reported via routine 
reporting. Routine reporting is accomplished via the Adverse Event (AE) Case Report 
Form (CRF) within the study database.   
 
 
The reporting methods described below are specific for clinical trials evaluating 
agents for which the IND is held by [CONTACT_6744], an investigator, or a pharmaceutical 
company. It is important to note that these procedures differ slightly from those used 
for reporting AEs for clinical trials for which CTEP holds the IND.

CTEP-AERS Medical Reporting includes the following requirements as part of the report : 
1) whether the patient has received at least one dose of an investigational agent on this 
study; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade  (severity), the 
relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), and the prior experience  (expectedness) of

by [CONTACT_2005]’s Oncology Group, the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) reviews reports of interim analyses of study toxicity and outcomes prepared by 
[CONTACT_4305], in conjunction with the study chair’s report. The DSMC may 
recommend the study be modified or terminated based on these analyses.  
 
Toxicity monitoring is also the responsibility of the study committee and any unexpected 
frequency of serious events on the trial are to be brought to the attention of the DSMC. The 
study statistician is responsible for the monitoring of the interim results and is expected to 
request DSMC review of any protocol issues s/he feels require special review. Any COG 
member may bring specific study concerns to the attention of the DSMC.  
 
The DSMC approves major study modifications proposed by [CONTACT_431474] (eg, termination, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_293832], increasing target sample size, etc.). The DSMC determines whether and to whom 
outcome results may be released prior to the release of study results at the time specified 
in the protocol document.

associated with RANK / RANKL expression. 
 
 
16.0 IMAGING STUDIES REQUIRED AND GUIDELINES FOR OBTAINING 
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established 
standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy 
and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family 
logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable (except where 
explicitly prohibited within the protocol).

reference to the atlas of Greulich & Pyle (GP) . Bone age is calculated by 
[CONTACT_480286], which are standard for different ages 
provided in the atlas.  
 
The hand radiographs are quite safe to obtain as the effective dose of radiation 
received during each exposure is between 0.0001-0.[ADDRESS_617262] bones with normal age levels. The method

based on “The Radiographic Atlas of Skeletal Development of the Hand and 
Wrist” , by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. William Walter Greulich and [CONTACT_480292], its last edition 
published in 1959, is still one of the most commonly used atlas for bone age 
measurement. It contains reference images of male and female standards of the left 
wrist and hand from birth till [ADDRESS_617263] image.  
 
MDP bone scintigraphy  
 Whole body bone scintigraphy should be performed and include 
planar images of the skeleton, including anterior and posterior views 
of the axial skeleton. Anterior and/or posterior views should be 
obtained of the appendicular skeleton. 
 Delayed (skeletal phase) images should be performed in all cases with 
flow and blood pool images as per local custom and clinical need. 
 Dose Administration: Dose administered should be according to 
standard weight-based protocols. Injection site should be away from 
lesion extremity or contralateral extremity if flow imaging is to be 
performed. Three-phase imaging is not required unless warranted by 
[CONTACT_293867] a focal lesion to assess hyperemia. 
 Imaging Parameters: Whole body delayed imaging is acquired 2-
3 hours after injection of the radiopharmaceutical. Spot views should 
be 
acquired of specific sites of symptoms or of any sites of 
abnormality as warranted by [CONTACT_293868]. 
 Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is 
recommended, but not required, particularly in cases with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_293834]. 
 SPECT Imaging: SPECT should be performed of the lesion site. 
SPECT imaging should be performed as recommended by [CONTACT_293869]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_293835] 360° 
circular orbit, 60–120 stops, 64 ´ 64 ´ 16 or greater matrix, and 10–
40 s/stop. An equivalent total number of counts should be acquired if 
continuous acquisition is used. 
 Special Consideration: Imaging of pelvis can be difficult due to 
overlying bladder activity. To lessen this problem, repeat imaging can 
be performed immediately after patient voiding. Bladder 
catheterization may be used, but should be reserved for patients in 
whom visualization of the pelvis is essential. For SPECT acquisition 
of the pelvis: “Single or multiple rapid (5-10 min/acquisition) SPECT 
acquisition(s) are preferred to avoid artifacts caused by [CONTACT_293870]. Bladder artifacts are exaggerated in the plane 
in which the SPECT acquisition begins and ends. Beginning SPECT 
acquisition with the camera heads in the left and right lateral positions 
(for dual-head camera) or posterior position (for single-head camera) 
will help reduce bladder filling artifact.

APPENDIX II:  YOUTH INFORMATION SHEETS 
 
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY AOST1321 
(for subjects from 11 to 17 years of age) 
 
A trial using denosumab to treat osteosarcoma that has not responded to treatment or that has come back  
 
 
1. We have been talking with you about your illness, osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is a type of cancer that 
grows in the cells that produce bones. Recurrent means that the cancer has come back after treatment . 
After doing tests, we have found that you have this type of cancer.  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have recurrent osteosarcoma. A research 
study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who are sick. In this study we 
are trying to learn more about how to treat osteosarcoma that has come back. We will do this by [CONTACT_91959] 
a new drug to treat recurrent osteosarcoma. We do not know how well the new drug will work in 
children, teens and young adults. That is why we are doing this study.  
 
3. Children and teens and young adults who are part of this study will be given a new drug. You will also 
have imaging tests to see if the cancer is getting worse, staying the same or getting better. There is a 
possibility that you will also have surgery or radiation therapy (high energy X-rays) while you are part 
of this study. Surgery and radiation therapy are often used to treat osteosarcoma and they are not 
experimental. 
 
4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things are 
called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is that you are able to get rid 
of the cancer. But we don’t know for sure if there is any benefit of being part of this study. 
 
5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things are 
called “risks.” Being in this study may involve special risks, which your doctor will discuss with you. 
Other things may happen to you that we don’t yet know about. 
 
6. You or your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being 
in this study at any time once you start. Please talk this over with your parents. Together you can decide 
if you want to take part in the study or not. There may be other treatments for your illness that your 
doctor can tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that you have.  
 
7. We are trying to learn how child and teenage bodies handle the new drug denosumab. We also want to 
see if there are ways to tell how the cancer will respond to treatment. To do this, we will collect extra 
blood, urine and tumor samples from you for research tests. Most of these samples will be taken when 
other standard blood draws, urine collection or tumor surgery are being performed but there may be 
extra blood draws. These additional blood tests may help children, teens and adults who receive this 
drug in the future.

 1. Overview  
 
1.1 Study Rationale and Design  
The nutritional status of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) has a profound impact on their 
mortality and morbidity.  Optimal nutrition in the early years of life has a positive influence on 
long-term growth, development and improved pulmonary status later  in life.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_704435], high calorie diets, and supplementation of fat -soluble vitamins, many 
children with CF fail to achieve optimal growth. In CF, intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis 
contribute to impaired digestion, abso rption, and nutrient utilization. CF caregivers have 
emphasized the importance of achieving good nutritional status with routine evaluation and 
aggressive nutritional interventions very early in life. Reducing intestinal inflammation may be a 
crucial facto r in achieving this goal.  
 
Among the interventions studied to combat the underlying mechanisms of malnutrition are anti -
oxidants, including glutathione. Early studies have shown that people with CF have decreased 
systemic levels of glutathione.  It is not known whether this is the r esult of inflammatory 
mediators suppressing production or secretion of glutathione, or involves loss of a possible 
function of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductive regulator (CFTR) to transport glutathione 
across the cell membrane. Glutathione has both  antioxidant and mucolytic properties in patients 
with CF. In two pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], orally administered glutathione improved growth in people with 
CF.  One of these studies evaluated the effect of reduced glutathione on the growth of 44 patients 
with CF in a single center placebo -controlled, randomized, double blind clinical trial.  
Participant s receiving supplemental glutathione over a six -month period experienced an average 
increase of 0.67 SD in weight -for-age z -score compared to an average of 0.1 SD improv ements 
in weight -for-age z -score in participant s receiving placebo.  Furthermore, improvements in body 
mass index (BMI) and height as well as reduced fecal calprotectin were also observed.  These 
encouraging results emphasize the need to study the impact o f oral glutathione on growth in CF 
patients in a larger, multi -center study.   
 
The purpose of this randomized, placebo -controlled (Phase II) study will be to further evaluate 
the effects of oral glutathione on growth in children with CF.  
 
The GROW study i s a prospective, multi -center, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, 
Phase II clinical trial.   Approximately sixty pancreatic insufficient (PI) participants  with CF who 
are ≥ 2 and < 11 years of age will be enrolled to receive either L -Glutathione  Reduced (GSH) or 
placebo given orally three times a day for 24 weeks. Each participant  will be seen for four study 
visits: Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 2 (Baseline/Randomization, Day 0), Visit 3 (Week 12) and Visit 
4 (Week 24).  At Visit 2, participant s wil l be randomized to receive either active treatment or 
placebo. Visit [ADDRESS_957242] of 24 weeks of treatment with oral 
glutathione on change in weight -for-age z-scores.  The secondary objectives are to e valuate

 changes in other clinical outcomes (growth, lung function, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], antibiotic utilization and pulmonary exacerbations [PE])  as well as to e valuate 
changes in blood and fecal inflammatory markers . 
 
 
1.2 Interim  Data Monitoring Committee Reviews  
Oversight for this trial is provided by a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) with members from 
the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics (CFFT) Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).   
Abbreviated data summaries are provided to the DMC in periodic interim saf ety reports, and one 
more comprehensive interim report.  
 
The purpose of the interim reviews is to monitor enrollment and feasibility, as well as patient 
safety.  The abbreviated safety reports will include a summary of screening, enrollment metrics, 
baseli ne characteristics, participant withdrawals and study drug discontinuation, drug compliance 
(for completed participants), protocol violations, and AEs and SAEs tabulated by [CONTACT_6490].  
 
The comprehensive interim report expands on the contents of the abbreviated safety reports to 
include efficacy summaries.  The emphasis of the comprehensive  report is primarily on safety;  
however, formal group sequential monitoring of the primary endpoint will be conducted.  Please 
note that informal comparisons of the data between treatment arms must be carefully interpreted 
in this report given that complete follow up data is not available for all partic ipants.   
 
 
2. Report Generation  
 
2.[ADDRESS_957243] all observation s and other pertinent data for each participant  who signs informed consent.  
 
Study personnel at each site will enter data from source documents corresponding to a 
participant ’s visit or assessment into the protocol -specific electronic Case Report Form (eC RF). 
Participant s will not be identified by [CONTACT_350609] (or designee), but will be identified by a site number, participant  
number , and initials. If a correction is required for an eCR F, the time and date stamp will track 
the person entering or updating eCRF data and an electronic audit trail  is created .  
 
The data will be entered into a validated database. The DCC will be responsible for data 
processing, in accordance with procedural d ocumentation. All procedures for the handling and 
analysis of data will be conducted using good computing practices for the handling and analysis 
of data for clinical trials.  
 
Once data have been entered into the study database, a system of computerized d ata validation 
checks will be implemented and applied to the database on a regular basis. Queries are entered, 
CF Therapeutics Development Network Coordinating Center  Confidential  
GROW -IP-[ADDRESS_957244] 
current version of R. All programs used to produce this report will be documented, tested, and 
archived and all tables, figures and listings will be validated before considered final.  
 
 
2.3 Data Sets Analyzed  
All analyses will be performed usi ng a modified intent -to-treat (m -ITT) population, which is 
defined as all randomized subjects who took at least one dose of the study drug.  Subjects who are 
discontinued from study drug temporarily or permanently are encouraged to complete all 
remaining st udy visits and will remain in the analysis population according to ITT.  Subjects will 
be analyzed according to the treatment arm to which they were randomized. The safety 
population will be used to summarize all safety measures and is identical to the m -ITT 
population. The primary efficacy analysis will be repeated in the per -protocol population, which 
is defined as subjects having completed >70% of study drug doses based on subject diary and 
having incurred no major protocol violations. The per -protocol an alyses will analyze subjects 
according to the treatment they received.

3. Overview of Planned Analyses  
 
 
Unless otherwise noted, P oisson regression  models  with an offset for log of observation time will 
be used to derive rate ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals comparing treatment 
groups . Confidence intervals for differences  in proportion s between treatment groups will be  
calculated using the Newcombe -Wilson method without continuity correction and, w here 
applicable, p -values for differences in proportions will be obtained  from Fisher’s exact tests.  
 
 
3.1 Enrollment and Withdrawal

Study drug compliance  will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] . Participants  who d iscontinued 
study drug will be evaluated according to their assigned dose at randomization.  Compliance 
percentage will be  calculated for each participant as the number of doses reported taken divided 
by [CONTACT_704445] , multiplied by 100.  The average drug compliance will be  
summarized in each treatment group. Also shown is the number and per centage of participants 
with > 7 0% compliance.  Mean compliance percentage and proportion of participants with > 70% 
compliance will be compared between tre atment groups  
 
A listin g of all protocol violations will be provided.  The number of participants included in th e 
per-protocol population will be  provided by [CONTACT_704446]. The p er-protocol population is defin ed as all randomized participants having completed 
> 70% of doses of study drug ( oral glutathione or placebo) and having incurred no major

The corresponding descriptive summaries are outlined in Appendix A, Section A. 3. 
 
 
3.4 Primary Endpoint  
Weight -for-age z -score, the primary outcome measure, will be calculated using CDC reference 
equations based on age, sex, and weight. The number and percent of expected and observed 
measurements of weight -for-age z -score across visits will be tabul ated by [CONTACT_1570], along 
with reasons for missingness and the number and perce nt of participants with both b aseline and 
end of study measurement.  
 
The primary endpoint is the difference between the GSH and placebo groups in the change in 
weight -for-age z-score from Visit 2  (Baseline)  to Visit 4 (Week 24). The difference between 
treatment groups will be estimated using a linear mixed effects model which will incorporate 
Visit 3 (Week 12) weight -for-age z -score measurements. The model will adjust for 
randomization strata, i.e., sex (male, female), baseline age (< 6 years, ≥ 6 years), baseline 
weight -for-age z -score category (< -0.52, ≥ -0.52), and historical fecal elastase (<200 μg/g, ≥200 
μg/g, unavailable)  and assume, if estimable, an unstructured cova riance structure. Least squares 
mean changes at each visit and the estimated treatment differences with corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals from the model will be presented. The  model -based  p-value for the Visit 4 
(Week 24) treatment difference  will be evaluated against a two -sided 0.05 level of significance. 
Graphical dis plays will be used to show unadjusted mean changes in weight -for-age z -score 
across visits for the two treatment groups.  
 
Sensitivity analyses of th e primary endpoint will include:  
▪ Performing the primary efficacy analysis on the per -protocol population.  
▪ Performing the primary efficacy analysis on the sub population of subjects  determined to 
be pancreatic insufficient (defined as fecal elastase < 200  μg/g).  
▪ Least favorable  treatment group imputation, which imputes missing values with the mean 
change from the  treatment group  with the worst chang e in the observed case analysis,

 conservatively assuming that any participants who dropped out of the study had a less 
than favorable result . 
 
Model-based m ean changes in weight -for-age z -score from baseline to Visit 4 and treatment 
differences with corresponding 95% confidence intervals and p-values from the sensitivity 
analyses will be tabulated. The treatment difference for 24-week change in weight -for-age z -
score and corresponding 95% confidence intervals based on the primary efficacy analysis as well 
as those from the sensitivity analyses will be graphical represented.

differences with corresponding 95% confidence intervals and p -values from the subgrou p 
analyses will be shown . The treatment difference for Visit 4 weight -for-age z -score and 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals based on the subgroup analyses will be graphical ly 
represented.  
 
Summary statistics will be tabulated by [CONTACT_704448]-for-age z -score at baseline, 
Week 12, and Week 24. Both absolute and relative changes from baseline will be presented for 
Week 12 and Week 24. Treatment differences and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will

Date: 22October 2020
Development Phase: 1/[ADDRESS_1069595] 2014- 002610- 23
Study Design: This is a Phase 1/2 open- label, non- randomized, multicenter 
study  consisting of two phases.  A Phase 1, or 
dose-escalation portion, which will evaluate the safet y and 
pharmacokinetic profile of venetoclax 
(ABT -199/GDC -0199) administered orally  in combination 
with low -dose cy tarabine (LDC) with the objective of 
defining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and generating 
data to support the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) in 
treatment -naïve subjects with Acute Myelogenous 
Leukemia (AML) who are ≥60years of age and who are 
not eligible for standard induction therap y due to 
co-morbidity  or other factors.  A subsequent initial Phase 2 
portion will evaluate if the RPTD has sufficient efficacy and 
acceptable toxicity  to warrant further development of the 
combination therap y.  Subsequently, within Phase 2, 
Cohort C will evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) for 
subjects allowed additional supportive medications (strong 
CYP3A inhibitors) if medically indicated.

Protocol Title:   A Phase 1/2 Study of Venetoclax in Combination with Low -Dose Cytarabine in 
Treatment Naïve Subjects with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Who Are ≥ [ADDRESS_1069604] Anthracycline -Based Induction Therapy
Objective s:  
Prim ary Objectives:
The primary objectives of the Phase 1 portion are to assess the safety profile, characterize 
pharmacokinetics (PK), determine the dose schedule, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) of venetoclax (AB T-199/GDC -0199) in combination with 
LDC in treatment -naïve subjects with AML who are ≥ [ADDRESS_1069605] induction therapy due to co -morbidity or other factors.
The primary objectives of the initial Phase 2 portion of th e study are to evaluate the preliminary 
estimates of efficacy including the overall response rate (ORR) and to characterize the toxicities of 
the combination at the RPTD.
The primary objective of Phase 2 Cohort C is to evaluate the ORR for subjects allowed additional 
supportive medications (strong CYP3A inhibitors) if medically indicated.
Secondary Objective:
The secondary objectives of the initial Phase 2 portion and Phase 2 Cohort C are to evaluate 
leukemia response (rates of CR, CRi, PR, and MLFS), durat ion of response (DOR) and overall 
survival (OS).
Exploratory Objective:
Additional exploratory objectives of both phases of the study may be evaluated to find biomarkers 
that may serve as surrogates or predictors for clinical outcomes in future studies of venetoclax in 
AML.
Investigators:   Investigator information on file at [COMPANY_013]
Study Site s:  Approximately 10 sites globally
Study Population:   Adult subjects ≥ [ADDRESS_1069606] induction 
therapy is not appropriate due to age, co -morbidity, or other factors.  Additionally, in Phase 2 Cohort C 
only, subjects aged 60 –[ADDRESS_1069607] specified co -morbidities that preclude treatment 
with anthracycline -containing induction chemotherapy.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Up to 42 subjects w ill be enrolled in the Phase 1 portion.  
Approximately 50 subjects w ill be enrolled in the initial Phase 2 portion.  In addition, approximately 
20subjects w ill be enrolled in Phase 2 Cohort C.

Methodology:
This is a Phase 1/2, open -label, multicenter study that will evaluate the PK, safety and preliminary 
efficacy of venetoclax combined w ith LDC in treatment -naïve subjects w ith AML ≥[ADDRESS_1069609] portion of the study is a Phase 1, or 
dose-escalation portion, that will evaluate the safety and PK profile of venetoclax administered with 
LDC with the objectives of defining the MTD and generating data to support a RPTD.  A subsequent 
initial Phase 2 portion w ill evaluate whether the RPTD has sufficient efficacy and acceptable toxicity to 
warrant further development of the combination therapy.  Subsequently, a cohort of subjects, Phase 2 
Cohort C, will be enrolled permitting a broader range of supportive medication (strong CYP3A 
inhibitors) co -administration.  Age entry criteria for these subjects will be ≥ 60 years.
For the Phase 1 portion, a classical 3 + [ADDRESS_1069610] 
from the subsequent cohort should not begin their intended dosing regimen until it is declared b y the 
sponsor that no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) have occurred during Cycle 1 of the previous dose level.  
For this trial, a DLT is defined as experiencing a Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) grade [ADDRESS_1069611] 25,000/μL and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to 500/μL within 
14days of the last dose of venetoclax unless such cytopenias are due to residual leukemia effect.  Should 
[ADDRESS_1069612] experience a DLT, an additional 3 subjects will be enrolled at the same dose level (a total of 
6subjects at this dose level).  Should [ADDRESS_1069613] experiences a 
DLT to define the MTD.
Biomarkers (such as cytogenetics, molecular markers, characterization of Bcl -[ADDRESS_1069614] samples) that may be predictive of venetoclax will be assessed 
throughout the trial and may be used to enrich for subjects likely to respond to venetoclax.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Efficacy (Continued):
CR: absolute neutrophil count ≥ 103/µL, platelets ≥ 105/µL, red cell transfusion independence, 
and bone marrow  with < 5% blasts.
CRi: bone marrow  with < 5% blasts, and peripheral neutrophils of < 103/µL or platelets 
<105/µL.
PR: all of the hematologic values for a CR but with a decrease of at least 50% in the percentage 
of blasts to 5% to 25% in the bone marrow  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].
MLFS: less than 5% blasts in an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or bone marrow core sample.  There should be no 
blasts with Auer rods or persistence of extramedullary disease.  The presence of a unique 
phenotype (by [CONTACT_4133]) identical to what was found in the pretreatment specimen 
(e.g., CD34, CD7 coexpression) sh ould be viewed as persistence of leukemia.
RD: failure to achieve CR, CRi, PR; only including subjects surviving at least 7 days following 
completion of initial treatment cycle, with evidence of persistent leukemia by [CONTACT_278618]/or 
bone marrow  exam ination.
PD: one or more of the following:  ≥ 50% decrement from maximum response levels in 
neutrophils or platelets, a reduction in hemoglobin by [CONTACT_2669] 2 g/dL, or transfusion 
dependence not due to other toxicities and bone marrow  blast ≥ 5%.
In addition to t he response determination using the above IWG AML response criteria, each subject w ill 
also be evaluated for Hematologic Response (HR) and complete remission with partial hematologic 
recovery (CRh).
CR = complete remission; CRi = CR with incomplete blood c ount recovery; PR = partial remission; 
MLFS =morphologically leukemia free status; RD = resistant disease; PD = progressive disease
Pharm acokinetic:
Venetoclax PK samples will be collected at [ADDRESS_1069633] venetoclax dose 
administration and for each new escalated dose in all subjects enrolled in the study.  Intensive PK 
samples will be collected for venetoclax in Phase 1.  Sparse PK samples will be collected for venetoclax 
in both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of the stu dy.  For the intensive PK days of venetoclax, values 
for the PK parameters including the maximum observed plasma concentration (C max), the time to C max
(peak time, T max), the area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) from [ADDRESS_1069634] measurable concentration (AUC t) and AUC over a 24 -hour dose interval (AUC 0-24) will be 
determined using noncompartmental methods.  Intensive PK samples will be collected for cytarabine in 
the dose escalation phase.  For the intensive PKdays of cytarabine , values for the PKparameters 
including C max, Tmax, half -life (t 1/2), AUC t, AUC from 0 to infinity (AUC∞) and clearance (CL/F) will be 
determined using noncompartmental methods.  Additional analyses may be performed if useful in the 
interpretati on of the data.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Pharm acodynamic and Predictive Biom arker Analysis:
A reduction in leukocytosis or blast counts may be evaluated as a measure of venetoclax -induced 
pharmacodynamic activity.  Exploratory research may als o be conducted to find biomarkers that may 
serve as surrogates for clinical endpoints in future venetoclax studies or that may be predictive of 
venetoclax activity.  Peripheral blood and bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_778632].  Biomarker assays may include, but are not limited to, BH3 profiling and ex vivo 
sensitivity testing.  Subject sub -populations (e.g., based on parameters such as cytogenetics, mutation 
profiles or ex vivo venetoclax sensitivities) may be enriched in Phase 2 of the study to increase the 
potential for response to venetoclax.  If necessary, aliquots from PK samples will be utilized for 
biomarker analyses.  Exploratory research analyses may not be included in the clinical study report.
Pharm acogenetic s:
DNA samples may be analyzed for genetic factors contributing to the disease or the subject's response to 
venetoclax in terms of pharmacokinetics, tolerability and safety.
Safety:
Adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital signs, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
laboratory values will be assessed.  Guidelines for Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) management are 
provided.  Note:  All subjects will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_778633] -up and longer as needed, per 
investigator judgment, for bone marr ow recovery or for management of disease complications during the 
escalation from each subjects starting dose through at least [ADDRESS_1069636] receiving their 
maximal venetoclax dose level.  Chemistry labs pertinent to TLS (including potassium , calcium, uric 
acid, phosphorus, and creatinine) will be performed at pre -dose, 6, and [ADDRESS_1069637] venetoclax dose level.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
Analyses of ORR as defined by [CONTACT_240316] + CRi + PR, CR rate, CRi rate, CRh rate, CR + CRi rate, CR + CRh 
rate, duration of response (DOR), event free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), the exploratory 
analysis of the proportion of all subjects who achieve minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity, the 
proportion of subjects who are transfusion independent post baseline, and the proportion of subjects who 
undergo subsequent stem cell transplant will be performed for subjects who received study drugs.
Pharm acokinetic:
Plasma concentrations and PK parameter values of venetoclax and cytarabine will be tabulated for each 
subject, visit, and dose regimen, and summary statistics will be computed for each sampling time and 
each parameter.
The dose proportionality of venetoclax and the potential interaction betw een venetoclax and cytarabine 
will be assessed using linear mixed effect model.
Safety:
A safety analysis will be performe d for all dosed subjects unless otherwise indicated.  For the study as a 
whole, adverse events will be evaluated and summarized.  Laboratory test results and vital signs will be 
explored for trends and summarized as appropriate.

3.0 Introduction
Venetoclax Activity and Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Profile
Hematologic malignancies are highl y dependent upon the anti -apoptotic protein Bcl -2 for 
survival.  Over -expression of Bcl -2 is associated with tumor initiation, disease 
progression, and drug resistance, and is thus a com pelling target for anti -tumor therapy .  
Venetoclax (ABT- 199/GDC -0199) is a potent, selective and orally  bioavailable small 
molecule inhibitor of Bcl -2 that binds with > 1,000 -fold higher affinity  for Bcl -2 (K i
<0.010 nM) than for Bcl -XL(Ki–48 nm) or Mc l-1 (K i> 444 nM).[ADDRESS_1069657] patient -deriv ed chronic l ymphocy tic 
leukemia (CLL) cells and a variet y of l ymphoma and leukemia cell lines, including acute 
myelogenous leukemias (AML).[ADDRESS_1069658] Non- Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL) cell lines expressing high levels of Bcl -2 protein due to the t(14;18) 
chromosome translocation, amplification of the Bcl-2gene locus, or aberrant ly activated 
signaling mechanisms.  Venetoclax also demonstrated potent killing of multiple myeloma 
(MM) cell lines and primary  tumor samples bearing the t(11;14) translocation, which tend 
to express high levels of Bcl -2 relative to Mcl -1.
Bcl-2 over -expression has been implicated in the maintenance and survival of AML cells 
and has been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutics.  In addition, high levels of 
Bcl-2 were associated with poor survival in a subset of patients with this disease.4,5  The 
Bcl-2/Bcl -XLinhibitor ABT -737 has been shown to kill AML  cells, including leukemic 
stem/progenitor cells, as both a single agent and in combination with cytarabine4or 
azacitidine.5To further define the role of Bcl -2 in this disease, panels of AML cell lines 
and primary  patient samples were cultured in the presence of venetoclax.  Twelve of 
24AML  cell lines tes ted were sensitive to venetoclax, with cell killing I C50values of 
<1.0µM ( Appendix G).  The sensitivity  of primary  AML patient samples was 
compa rable to that observed for primary  CLL samples, with a median I C50= 0.010 µM 
(n= 57) for AML6(Appendix G) versus a median IC 50= 0.003 µM (n =35) for CLL 
([COMPANY_013] R&D/10/1025, [COMPANY_013] R&D/12/538).  Venetoclax has also demonstrated killing 
of AML leukemic stem/progenitor cells ex vivo and antitumor efficacy in vivo, inhibiting 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -[ADDRESS_1069659] combinations resulted in additive cell killing, 
venetoclax c ombined with cy tarabine or azacitidine showed s ynergistic effects on several 
AML  cell lines (Appendix G).  These data suggest that Bcl -[ADDRESS_1069660] been observed between ABT -737 and 
cytarabine or azacitidine, and thus provides a rationale for testing these combinations with 
venetoclax in patients with AML .  In mouse, rat, monkey , and dog, the venetoclax PK 
profile was characterized by  [CONTACT_778680] (CLp = 0.02 to 0.27 L /hr•kg) and low 
volumes of distribution (Vss = 0.3 to 1.1 L /kg).  Half -lives ranged from 2.[ADDRESS_1069661] defined the behavior of the amorphous solid 
dispersion (ASD) for both toxicology  and first -in-human evaluation.  Plasma 
concentrations obtained from fed dogs were 30% to 50% higher than th ose obtained from 
fasted animals.
Venetoclax is not a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, or 
CYP2D6 (I C50>30 μM).  At concentrations of 1, 3, and 10 μM, venetoclax did not 
induce CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 expression in vitro.  Venetoclax was meta bolized by  
[CONTACT_097]3A4; thus its exposure could be affected when potent inhibitors or inducers of 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -[ADDRESS_1069662] 2014 -002610 -23

CYP3A4 are co -administered.  Venetoclax is a substrate for P -gp and BCRP.  Active 
uptake of venetoclax or M27 was not observed in cells overexpressing OATP1B1, 
OAT P1B3 or OCT1.  Venetoclax is a P -gp, BCRP and OATP1B1 inhibitor in vitro.
Venetoclax Preclinical Toxicology
The primary  toxicities associated with repeat -dose oral administration of venetoclax were 
effects on the hematologic sy stem (decreased ly mphocy tes and red blood cell mass) in 
mice, rats, and dogs, the male reproductive s ystem (testicular germ cell depletion) in dogs, 
and embry o-fetal toxicity  in mice.  Other noteworthy  findings in dogs were epi[INVESTIGATOR_778634].  I n 
general, the primary  toxicities and other noteworthy  findings were consistent with the 
expected pharmacologic effects of venetoclax, a selective Bcl -2 inhibitor.
In mice, rats, and dogs, venetoclax produced decreases in lymphocy tes in the peripheral 
blood (up to – 75% in mice, – 64% in rats, and – 81% in dogs) and in ly mphoid tissues, 
generall y following 2 to 4 weeks or more of dail y dosing (but after a single dose in dogs).  
Lym phocy te decreases were expected on the basis of venetoclax pharmacology  and, when 
sustained over periods of 6 to 9 months in chronic venetoclax toxicity  studies, were not 
associated with opportunistic infections.16
In mice, total ly mphocy te counts at the high dose of 600 mg/kg/day  after 4 weeks of 
dosing were minimally  decreased –21% to – 26% relative to concurrent controls at the end 
of the 4- week recovery  period, indicating partial recovery .  In dogs, the recovery  of 
peripheral blood decreases in total ly mphocy tes and ly mphocy te subsets (CD4+ T -cells, 
CD8+ T- cells, and CD21+ B -cells) was prolonged, requiring up to [ADDRESS_1069663] sensitive ly mphocy te sub type 
based on the magnitude of decrease (> –90%) and/or the length of time required for 
recovery .  Lymphocy te decreases in l ymphoid tissues were reversible in mice and dogs ; 
but, as with peripheral blood ly mphocy tes, required up to 18 weeks in dogs.

Veneto clax produced dose -related decreases in red blood cell (RBC) mass due to altered 
hemoglobinization and decreased RBC production in mice, rats, and dogs.  Based on a 
criterion of hemoglobin decreases of ≥ –20% as compared to control and/or baseline, 
these e ffects were considered adverse at the highest dosages in the 4 -week mouse and dog 
studies (observed decreases of – 21 to –23%) but were reversible following a [ADDRESS_1069665] dose levels for possible carcinogenicity 
assessment, RBC mass decreases were also observed in rats and were generally  more 
severe (hemoglobin decreases to – 49%) than in mice or dogs.
Venetoclax produced adverse, non dose -related microscopic findings of testicular germ 
cell depletion (spermatogonial loss with maturation depletion) in dogs at all doses tested.  
Reversibility  was assessed after 4 weeks of dosing and a 4 -week recovery  period; there 
was no evidence of reversibility .  Testicular germ cell loss may  be related to venetoclax 
pharmacology , asBcl-[ADDRESS_1069666] dosage administered 
(150 mg/kg/day ); the no -observed -adverse -effect -level was defined at the mid -dose of 
50mg/kg/day .  In mice and rabbits, venetoclax was not teratogenic, and there were no 
other effects on development or fertility .
Additional noteworthy  effects of venetoclax included minimal to mild single cell necrosis 
in multiple epi[INVESTIGATOR_27771] (gallbladder, exocrine pancreas, epi[INVESTIGATOR_26612], prostate, and 
stomach) in dogs and a change in the hair coat towards white in dogs (occurring after 
approximately  3 months of dosing in the 9 -month study ).  None of these effects was 
considered to be adverse.  Hair follicle melanocy tes are critically  dependent on Bcl -[ADDRESS_1069667] of Bcl -2 inhibition.19  In regards to single -
cell ne crosis, Bcl-2 is expressed in epi[INVESTIGATOR_778635].20-22  Venetoclax appears to increase the rate of normally

occurring apoptosis without adversely affecting the normal tissue architecture or functions 
of these tissues .
There was no evidence of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity  of venetoclax, nor was there 
evidence of phototoxicity  (tested in vivo in hairless mice).  In a juvenile toxicity  study , 
mice were administered venetoclax at 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day  by [CONTACT_778681] 7 to 
60 day s of age.  Clinical signs of toxicity  included decreased activity , dehydration, skin 
pallor and hunched posture at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day .  Mortality  and bod y weight decreases 
occurred at 100 mg/kg/day .  Other venetoclax -related effects were reversible decreases in 
lymphocy tes at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day ; these findings were consistent with those in adult mice 
and considered non adverse.
The major human metabolite of venetoclax, M27, was characterized at steady -state in R/R 
CLL patient plasma with an average metabolite to paren t AUC ratio of 0.[ADDRESS_1069669], ss plasma levels of M27 in mice and dogs were 
≤5.1% of human exposure, making M27 a disproportionate human metabolite.  The 
safet y of M27 was evaluated by [CONTACT_778682].  M27 was negative in Ames 
and chromosome aberration in vitro assays, has at least 58 -fold less in vitro potency  than 
venetoclax, and demonstrates low off -target toxicity  potential based on in vitro secondary  
pharmacology  assay s.  Additionally , no adverse effects were observed in a 4 -week mouse 
toxicity  study  in which M27 was orall y administered at dosages up to 300 mg/kg/day, 
achieving M27 AUC plasma exposures at or above those observed clinically.
Dogs at the high dosage of 150 mg/kg/day  (AUC 572 µg•h/mL) in the 4- week toxicity  
study  had clinical signs of swelling of the skin on the ears, head (cranial area), and 
forepaws and/or hind paws.  Most but not all animals (8 of 10 dogs) were affected, and in 
[ADDRESS_1069670] dose.  The clinical signs were 
limited to the 150 mg/kg/day  dosage, were mild to moderate in severity  and transient and 
sporadic in occurrence, and were absent during the 4- week recovery  period.  A 
mechanistic basis for the swelling reactions wa s not established, but a histamine -like 
reaction to copovidone, a primary  excipi[INVESTIGATOR_547557], is possible.23  There were 
no signs of anaph ylaxis.

Venetoclax was tested in a battery  of safet y pharmacology  assay s, and produced no 
effects in the CNS/neurobehavioral or respi[INVESTIGATOR_778636] 600 mg/kg.  To assess cardiovascular safet y, venet oclax was 
tested in an in vitro human ether -a-go-go related gene (hERG) assay  and in both 
conscious and anesthetized dogs.  InhERG, a 50% inhibition constant (I C50) could not be 
calculated due to limited solubility  (1.5 µg/mL ).  Only minimal effects on QT interval 
corrected for heart rate (QTc) were observed up to a maximum plasma concentration of 
46 µg/mL  in dogs.  In conscious dogs, venetoclax did not produce an y cardiovascular 
effects up to and including the highest oral dose of 150 mg/kg (C max= 16 µg/ mL).  In the 
anesthetized dog at higher plasma concentrations, venetoclax produced mild reductions in 
myocardial contractility  (–6% to – 13%) and cardiac output ( –11% to – 19%) at plasma 
concentrations of ≥ 16 µg/mL and ≥ 32 µg/mL , respectively .  These conce ntrations are 
greater than the plasma concentration of venetoclax in humans (geometric mean 
Cmax=3.46 µg/mL  at the 1200 mg dose).
On the basis of nonclinical safet y pharmacology and toxicology evaluations of 
venetoclax, and on the basis of nonclinical an d human studies of related anti -apoptotic 
Bcl-[ADDRESS_1069672] identified a fetal toxicity  risk.  Thrombocy topenia has not been observed in 
toxicology  studies in mice and dogs.  These findings are consistent with venetoclax as a 
Bcl-2 specific (Bcl -XLsparing) inhibitor.  Consequently , thrombocy topenia is not 
expected to be a DLT clinically .  Overall, the toxicities observed in animals administered 
venetoclax are consistent with the expected pharmacologic effects of Bcl- 2 inhibition.

available with venetoclax administration, important identified risks are tumor ly sis 
syndrome (TLS), neutropenia, and serious infection.  Tumor ly sis sy ndrome is a risk 
associated with venetoclax treatment and it is highest in CLL and MCL.  Other adverse 
events commonly  observed with venetoclax include nausea, diarrhea, an d other 
hematological effects (including, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and l ymphopenia).  Events 
of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocy topenia are also commonly  observed with the 
underly ing hematologic malignancies.  Infections, including serious infections, a lthough 
also common with the underly ing malignancies, have been reported with venetoclax

treatment and their incidence is higher with combination treatments.  Co -administration 
with CYP3A inducers and inhibitors can cause changes in venetoclax exposure.  
Decreased spermatogenesis has been observed in nonclinical studies with dogs.  
Embry ofetal toxicity  was observed in nonclinical studies; thus, venetoclax should not be 
used during pregnancy .  In addition, as venetoclax is being evaluated in subjects with R/ R 
disease who had previously  been treated with various cy totoxic agents, second primary  
malignancies are closel y monitored.  Following multiple -dose administration, the 
maximum plasma concentration of venetoclax was attained 5 to 8 hours after dosing.  The
harmonic mean terminal phase elimination half -life (t 1/2) ranged from 17 to 41 hours 
following a single oral dose of venetoclax.  I n subjects with CLL, venetoclax showed 
minimal accumulation, and steady -state AUC increased proportionally over the dose 
range of 150 to 800 mg.  Venetoclax has been administered with food in all clinical 
studies, as food increased the bioavailability  of venetoclax by  [CONTACT_3450]  3-to 5-fold.  
Venetoclax is highl y bound to plasma proteins with unbound fraction (fu) < 0.01, a nd it is 
primarily  eliminated as metabolites in feces with negligible renal elimination (< 0.1%).  
Drug -drug interaction (DDI) studies of venetoclax with ketoconazole, rifampin, warfarin, 
ritonavir, azithromy cin, and digoxin were conducted to provide dosin g recommendations 
for patients concomitantly taking CYP3A and/or P -gp inhibitors, inducers, and/or 
warfarin.  Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in healthy Chinese subjects and in 
Japanese subjects to provide dosing recommendations for those specific p opulations.  
Additionally , a dedicated study  to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of venetoclax in subjects 
with hepatic impairment was conducted.  Based on the population pharmacokinetic 
analysis, age, sex, race, weight, and mild and moderate renal or hepatic impairment do not 
have an effect on venetoclax clearance.

diagnosed with AML.29,30
3.1 Study Rationale
Currently , there is no consensus as to a single optimal therap y for older patients with 
AML  who are not candidates for conventional induction treatment though subcutaneous 
low-dose cy tarabine (LDC) is a common therapeutic approach.  A common approach that 
hemato- oncologists utilize to determine fitness for intensive induction therapy  is to 
conduct a thorough clinical evaluation including history taking, phy sical examination, and 
review of pertinent laboratory and clinical tests.  This "clinical judgment" approach was 
supported by  [CONTACT_259495] a prospective study  of 157 subjects with hematological 
malignancies that found "clinical judgment" to be the stron gest prospective predictor of 
survival and was superior to formalized geriatric assessment without clinical judgment.31  
Another approach, suggested by  [CONTACT_778683],32,33incorporates specified co -
morbidity  criteria in addition to clinical judgment.  Conceptual criteria proposed to define 
subje cts unfit for conventional intensive chemotherap y32are:
1. Advanced age (over 75 years)
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -[ADDRESS_1069680] 2014 -002610 -23

2. Severe cardiac c omorbidity
3. Severe pulmonary  comorbidity
4. Severe renal comorbidit y
5. Severe hepatic comorbidity
6. Active infection resistant to anti -infective therap y
7. Cognitive impairment
8. Low performance status (ECOG functional scale)
9. Any other comorbidit y that the physician judges to be incompatible with 
chemotherap y
Low-dose cy tarabine is a standard treatment option for patients with AML who are 
ineligible for intensive induction therap y due to comorbidities.  I nitial studies from the 
Acute Leukemia Group B, over 40 years a go, reported that 15% –20% of patients with 
AML  receiving LDC at dose of 10 – 30 mg/m2achieved a CR.31  Subsequently, a meta -
analysis including 293 previously  untreated patients with newly  diagnosed acute non -
lymphocy tic leukemia reported a CR rate of 32% with L DC.35More recently , a large, 
international trial for newly diagnosed patients ages 65 years and older with A ML and 
poor prognostic features reported a combined CR rate (CR + CR with incomplete blood 
count recovery ) of 11% for those patients receiving LDC using modern and more 
sensitive methods to determine the depth of clinical response.30
Though LDC has been available for decades, the low response rate and associated short 
expected survival leaves a significant unmet medical need for patients with treatment -
naïve AML who are ≥ [ADDRESS_1069681], 
high dose, anthracy cline -based induction chemotherap y.  Single -agent clinical activity  
observed in other advanced hematologi c malignancies (Study  M12 -175) and AML  
(Study M14- 212), along with activity  demonstrated using venetoclax alone and in 
combination with cy tarabine in AML  cell lines and primary  patient samples, suggest the 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -[ADDRESS_1069682] study  of venetoclax in combination with L DC for subjects with AML .  
Venetoclax was tested in Phase 2 trial (Study  M14 -212) in subjects with relapsed, 
refractory  AML or in a frontline setting in subjects who are unfit for intensive therap y to 
examine preliminary  activity  and safet y as monotherap y.  A Phase 1b/2 trial 
(Study M14- 358) was also initiated testing the combinations of venetoclax with either 
azacitidine or decitabine in subjects with naïve AML who are aged 65 and older and not 
eligible for intensive induction chemotherap y.  Clinical trials in other indications which 
employ  venetoclax monotherapy  include a Phase 1 clinical trial to ascertain the safet y, 
PK, maximum tolerated dose, RPTD of venetoclax in subjects with relapsed or refractory  
CLL and NHL (Stud yM12- 175) and a Phase 2 trial of venetoclax in subjects with 
relapsed/refractory  CLL harboring 17 p deletion (Study  M13 -982).

neoplasm progression, (25.0%), hypokalemia, and pneumonia (21.9% each).  Serious 
adverse events were reported for 27 (84.4%) subjects, including febrile neutropenia (9 
subjects), malignant neoplasm progression (8 subjects), pne umonia (5 subjects), 
abdominal pain, sepsis, urinary  tract infection, failure to thrive, renal failure acute, and 
hypotension (2 subjects each).  All other events occurred in [ADDRESS_1069686] each.
Study  M14 -212 has completed with efficacy  data available for 32 s ubjects, the majority  of 
them (30, 94%) with R/R AML .  The ORR was 19% (6 of 32 subjects), with CR in 2 (6%) 
and CRi in 4 (13%) subjects.  Anti -leukemic activity  was observed in an additional 
6(19%) subjects.
For additional safet y and efficacy data please refer to the current Investigator Brochure.25
Considering the coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to subjects 
participating in this study has been re -evaluated. Subjects receiving venetoclax may  be at 
an increased risk for COVID- 19 infection or experience serious illness if infected. 
Management of these adverse events will be made on a case -by-case basis with 
consideration of benefit/risk. However, based on the population and disease being studied 
and the anticipation that COVID -19 related risks are not expected to differ substantially  
between stud y subjects and the broader population of subjects receiving treatment for 
AML , no change to the benefit/risk balance for subjects in this study  is expected.
4.0 Study  Objective
The primary  objectives of the Phase 1 portion are to assess the safet y profile, characterize 
PK, determine the dose sche dule, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) of venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199) in combination 
with L DC in treatment -naïve subjects with AML who are ≥65years of age and who are 
not eligible for standard induction therap y due to co- morbidity  or other factors.
The primary  objectives of the initial Phase 2 portion of the study  are to evaluate the 
preliminary  estimates of efficacy  including the overall response rate (ORR), and to 
characterize the toxicities of the combination at the RPTD.
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -[ADDRESS_1069687] 2014 -002610 -23
35
The primary  objective of Phase 2 Cohort C is to evaluate the ORR for subjects allowed 
additional supportive medications (strong CYP3A inhibitors) if medically indicated.
The secondary  objectives of the initial Phase 2 portion and Phase 2 Cohor t C are to 
evaluate leukemia response (rates of CR, CRi, PR, and MLFS), duration of response 
(DOR) and overall survival (OS).
Additional exploratory  objectives of both phases of the study  may  be evaluated to find 
biomarkers that may  serve as surrogates or predictors for clinical outcomes in future 
studies of venetoclax in AML .
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 1/2, open- label, non- randomized, multicenter study  that will evaluate the 
PK, safet y and efficacy of o rally administered venetoclax combined with LDC in 
treatment -naïve subjects with AML  ≥ [ADDRESS_1069688] 
induction therap y due to co -morbidity  or other factors.  This study  is sponsored b y 
[COMPANY_013] in collaboration with Genen tech/[COMPANY_002].
This study  will consist of three distinct portions.  The first portion of the study is a 
Phase 1, or dose -escalation portion, that will evaluate the safet y and PK profile of 
venetoclax administered with L DC with the objective of defining the MT D and generating 
data to support a RPTD.  A subsequent initial Phase 2 portion will evaluate if the RPTD 
has sufficient efficacy  and acceptable toxicity  to warrant further development of the 
combination therapy.  Subsequently, Phase 2 Cohort C, will evalua te the ORR for subjects 
allowed additional supportive medications (strong CYP3A inhibitors) if medically 
indicated.
The study  is designed to enroll up to approximately  [ADDRESS_1069689] s will be treated at the RPTD and schedule

defined in the Phase 1 portion of the study.  Phase 2 Cohort C will enroll approximately  
20subjects.
All efforts will be made to adhere to these specified enrollment numbers; however, 
recognizing the acute nature of the disease, it might not be possible to deny treatment to 
subjects in screening for ethical reasons or maintain individual subjects on therap y 
sufficiently  long to evaluate safety  or efficacy .
Figure 1. Overall Study Design
Biomarkers (such as cy togenetics, molecular markers, characterization of Bcl -[ADDRESS_1069691] samples) that may be predictive of 
venetoclax activity will be assessed throughout the trial and may  be used to enrich for 
subjects likely  to respond to venetoclax.
Dosing Schedule Overview – Venetoclax – Phase 1 Portion
Venetoclax will be administered orall y once dail y (QD) on Day s [ADDRESS_1069692] 
monitoring.  The dosing regimen will also enable interruptions, reductions (if necessary) 
and a slower intra -subject dose escalation if rapid tumor ly sis or other toxicities are 
observed.

The initial period, approximately  one week, of ther apy until the target dose of venetoclax 
is achieved is considered the venetoclax ramp -up period (Day  1 through Day  4, 6 or 7 of 
Cycle1, based on the escalation steps in the cohort).
Dose modifications of venetoclax in the ramp- up period may  be implemented for 
individual subject(s) at risk for TL S or any  new adverse events > Grade 2.  Dose 
reductions must follow original dosing schema.  If the subject requires dose reductions or 
dose holds during the venetoclax ramp -up period, a discussion with the [COMPANY_013] m edical 
monitor is required.
To mitigate the potential risk of TL S,36subjects will receive TLS proph ylaxis prior to any  
venetoclax dose escalation in combination with LDC (See Appendix Efor specific 
allopurinol and IV fluid dosing guidance).  Subj ects will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_778637], with confinement recommended to begin by  [CONTACT_633380]  –1, and must occur b y 
at least Day  1, through at least 24 hours after completion of the ramp -up period 
(e.g., Day –1 through Day  5 of C ycle 1 based on t he escalation steps in Cohort C).  Tumor 
lysis sy ndrome prophy laxis will be initiated in all subjects starting at least the day before 
the first dose of venetoclax.  Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Management of Tumor Ly sis 
Syndrome, for the details on TL S prophy laxis, Appendix E–Recommendations for Initial 
Management of Electrol yte Imbalances and Prevention of Tumor Ly sis Syndrome for 
procedures to follow, and Appendix Hfor information regar ding how to recognize 
laboratory  and clinical TLS.
If a subject develops an y laboratory  changes suggestive of TL S within the first [ADDRESS_1069694] dose or during dose escalation, venetoclax dose escalation should be 
withheld or the dose sho uld be reduced.  Dose reductions and dose holds during the 
ramp -up period require notification of the [COMPANY_013] medical monitor as do any  occurrence 
of clinical TL S.

change s in the dosing increments may  be implemented.  The initial dose in subsequent 
cohorts may  be lowered based on the tolerability , including the presence of signs of 
clinically  significant laboratory  or clinical tumor ly sis.  Dose escalation to the target do se 
may then occur in smaller increments.  Decisions to modify  the ramp -up period will be 
made b y [COMPANY_013] following discussion between the investigators and [COMPANY_013] medical 
monitor.  Historically , subjects receiving treatment for AML are at risk for developin g 
TLS and accordingl y TLS is an AESI  in this protocol.  If a subject experiences clinical 
TLS while receiving protocol therap y, [COMPANY_013]'s medical monitor and safet y team will 
review safet y data (both pertaining to the individual subject and in aggregate) to
determine if modifications to the first week dose escalation schedule or TLS prophy laxis 
are warranted.

12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A single 12- lead resting ECG will be obtained at Screening, Final Visit, and as clinically 
needed.  The Final Visit ECG may  be obtained within ± [ADDRESS_1069769] 5 minutes.  Subjects will be instructed to remain completel y stationary (no talking, 
laughing, deep breathing, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or swallowing) for approximately 10 seconds during 
the ECG recording.  While ECGs are being acquired, subjects and staff are prohibited 
from having devices (e.g., cellular tel ephones, fans, heaters, etc.) that emit radiofrequency  
signals in the room.
COVID -[ADDRESS_1069770].
ECG Safety Review
Each ECG will be printed and evaluated b y an appropriatel y qualified ph ysician at the 
study  site (the "lo cal reader") who will determine if an y findings outside normal 
physiological variation are clinically  significant.  The local reading of the ECG will be 
used by  [CONTACT_197778], including adverse event 
determination and mana gement, and decision on whether a subject will be discontinued 
from the study .
The local reader will sign and date the safet y ECG and provide a global interpretation 
using the following categories:
●Normal ECG
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -[ADDRESS_1069771] 2014 -002610 -23
68
●Abnormal ECG – Not clinically  significant (NCS)
●Abnormal ECG – Clinically  significant (CS)
●Unable to evaluate
All local reader evaluations of the ECGs will be entered into the electronic case report 
form (eCRF).  If the global interpretation is Abnormal (NCS or CS), the local reader will 
provide furth er information (e.g., sinus brad ycardia, arrh ythmia).  The QT interval 
measurement will be documented in the eCRF only  if a "prolonged QT" is observed.  
Correction b y the Fridericia formula (QTcF) is preferred; however, correction by [CONTACT_778686] a cceptable based on discussion with the [COMPANY_013] medical monitor.  The 
original ECG tracing will be retained as source documentation in the subject's records at 
the study  site.
Multiple Gated Acquisition Scan (MUGA)/2D Echocardiogram with Doppler
Assessment o f ejection fraction will be made at Screening b y either a MUGA (preferred 
method) or 2D echocardiogram with Doppler provided that such assessment would not 
inappropriatel y delay  therapy  per discretion of the investigator.  Subsequent evaluation 
will be mad e as clinically  indicated for subjects who develop signs of cardiac compromise.  
It is preferred that the same method of assessment is used for a given subject.

a. At room temperature, rasburicase causes enzymatic degradation of the uric acid in blood/plasma/serum samples 
potentially resulting in spuriously low plasma uric acid assay readings.  The following special sample handling 
procedure must be followed to avoid ex vivo uric acid degradation.
Uric acid must be analyzed in plasma.  Blood must be collected into pre -chilled tubes containing heparin 
anticoagulant.  Immediately immerse plasma sa mples for uric acid measurement in an ice water bath.   Plasma 
samples must be prepared by [CONTACT_26795] a pre -cooled centrifuge (4°C).  Finally, the plasma must be 
maintained in an ice water bath and analyzed for uric acid within [ADDRESS_1069776] value outside the reference range that the investigator considers 
clinically  significant:

Transfusion dependence is defined as having received ≥ 2 units of RBCs and or platelets 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -[ADDRESS_1069804] met until recurrent or progressive disease is 
documented.
Criteria for Evaluation is as follows:
●CR:  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 103/µL, platelets ≥ 105/µL, red cell 
transfusio n independence, and bone marrow with < 5% blasts.
●CRi:  bone marrow with < 5% blasts, and peripheral neutrophils of <103/µL or 
platelets < 105/µL.
●PR:  all of the hematologic values for a CR but with a decrease of at least 50% 
in the percentage of blasts t o 5% to 25% in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].
●MLFS:  less than 5% blasts in an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or bone marrow core sample. 
There should be no blasts with Auer rods or persistence of extramedullary 
disease. The presence of a unique phenot ype (b y flow cy tometry ) identical to 
what was found in the pretrea tment specimen (e.g., CD34, CD7 coexpression) 
should be viewed as persistence of leukemia.
●RD:  failure to achieve CR, CRi, PR; only  including subjects surviving at least 
7 day s following completion of initial treatment cycle, with evidence of 
persistent leukemia b y blood and/or bone marrow examination.
●PD:  one or more of the following:  ≥ 50% decrement from maximum response 
levels in neutrophils or platelets, a reduction in hemoglobin by [CONTACT_2669] 2 g/dL , 
or transfusion dependence,* not due to other toxicities and bone marrow blast 
≥5%.
In addition to the response determination using the above I WG AML response criteria, 
each subject will also be evaluated for hematologic response and complete remission with 
partial hematologic recovery  (CRh).
●HR:  improvement in peripheral blood counts with all of the following:  fewer 
absolute peripheral blood blasts than prior to initiating study treatment for 
subjects presenting with peripheral blood blasts, ANC ≥ 500 (cells /μL),

●CRh:  all of the following criteria are met:  Bone marrow with < 5% blasts, 
peripheral neutrophils of ≥ 0.5 × 103/µL, and peripheral pla telets 
≥0.5×105/µL**
* Transfusion independence is defined as the absence of any RBC or platelet transfusion during any consecutive 
8weeks during the treatment period.39
** For a bone marrow sample collected before the last cycle of study treatment, the hematology lab results collected 
from the date of bone marrow sample collection up to Day [ADDRESS_1069806] the potential to define either remission 
status or potential progression of leukemia.  NOTE:  For subjects who achieve CR or CRi, 
MRD status may  be determined.
Subjects will be assigned to one disease state for best I WG response assessment, 
achievement of protocol defined hematologic response, and minimal residual disease 
positivity  at the time of the best response.

efficacy , tolerability , and safet y.  Such genetic factors may  include genes for drug 
metabolizing enzy mes, drug transport proteins, genes within the target pathway , other 
genes believed to be related to drug response, or genes related to the disease state.  Some 
genes currentl y insufficiently char acterized or unknown may  be understood to be 
important at the time of analy sis.  The samples may  be anal yzed as part of a multi -study  
assessment of genetic factors involved in the response to venetoclax, drugs of this class, 
or the disease state.  The samples may  also be used for the development of diagnostic tests 
related to venetoclax, drugs of this class, or the disease state.  The results of 
pharmacogenetic anal yses may  not be reported with the study  summary .
5.3.7 Pharmacody namic Variables
Several putative biomarkers of efficacy  and response may  be evaluated in this protocol 
with the goal of defining the relationship between drug concentration and disease status.  
Samples taken may  be used for the assessment of specific biologic markers, including 
proteins an d/or nucleic acids not currently known to be prognostic, in order to better 
understand the biology  of AML and disease prognosis, to predict response to treatment

M14 -[ADDRESS_1069810] development.  [COMPANY_013] (or a designated 
laboratory ) will store the samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to 
protect confidentiality .  The samples will be retained while research on venetoclax (or 
drugs of this class) continues but no longer than [ADDRESS_1069811] counts may be evaluated as a measure of 
pharmacod ynamics activity  to venetoclax.  Measurement of relevant nucleic acids and 
proteins (including but not limited to the Bcl -2 family  members) in tumor cells in the 
blood, pre -treatment, and at time of disease progression, may  be examined for putative 
stratification markers for correlation with efficacy.
For the stud y to be comprehensive, a determination o f whether the cellular context 
influences response to this drug will need to be made; therefore both subject bone marrow 
and peripheral blood collections may  be evaluated for a subset of the biomarker anal yses 
which are planned.  Overall, the goals of the biomarker anal yses described in this section 
are to 1) determine the relationship between drug concentration and disease status 
(pharmacod ynamics) and 2) identify responsive subject populations (based on subject 
characteristics at baseline and relapse).
Venetoclax inhibits the ability  of cancer cells to evade cell death, or apoptosis, by  
[CONTACT_778690] -apoptotic protein Bcl -2.  Preclinical studies have 
demonstrated a pattern of response to venetoclax based on the levels of Bcl -2 family  
proteins.  High levels of Bcl -2 and low levels of Mcl -1 and Bcl -XLare generall y 
predictive of response to this drug in vitro.  The measurement of relevant DNA, RNA and 
proteins (including those in the Bcl -2 family  and those related to AML disease biology )in 
leukemic blood and bone marrow as well as serum and protein may be examined 
pre-treatment, on therapy, and at the time of progression for putative stratification markers 
and correlation with efficacy .  In addition, blood and bone marrow samples will be

profiling and/or b y treatment with venetoclax (I C50values) to evaluate if response to 
venetoclax can be predicted in vitro.  These methods may  be further used along with 
subject cy togenetics and mutational profile to enrich for subjects likel y to respond to 
venetoclax in the second portion of the study .  Based on the ongoing assessment of data, 
the criteria for subject enrichment will be defined.

6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An adverse event is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily  have a causal relatio nship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not th e event is considered causally  related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity  of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse 
event.  Laboratory  abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only if they  result in discontinuation from the study , necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, meet protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.8 regarding toxicity  
management), and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during a stud y will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and 
the surgery /procedure has been pre -planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedl y during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the conditio n for which the elective 
surgery /procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
A treatment -emergent adverse event is defined as any adverse event reported by a subject 
with onset or worsening from the time that the first dose of study drug i s administered 
until [ADDRESS_1069842] elapsed following discontinuation of study  drug administration.

[IP_ADDRESS] Serious A dverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse 
event:
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_778663] y 
length of time or prolongs the subject's hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] .  This 
does not include an emergency  room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility .
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes 
with the activities of daily living of a stud y subject.  Disability  
is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor 
medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained 
ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based 
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life -threatening, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital 
anomaly , or persistent or significant disability /incapacity ).  
Additionally , any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth 
is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such 
events include allergic bronchospasm r equiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dy scrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse

For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.  Deaths related to disease progression will 
not be recorded as serious adverse events (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] a subject to allow observation and management (e.g., for IV h ydration) 
for the purpose of TLS prophy laxis will not be captured as a serious adverse event (SAE), 
unless there is an additional reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_778664] (e.g., abnormal post -dose TL S laboratories that 
necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, etc.).  Additional criteria for defining TLS 
are in Appendix H.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Commonly  Associated with A cute 
Myelogenous Leukemia Study  Population and/or 
Progression of A cute My elogenous Leukemia
Certain adverse events are anticipated to occur in the study  population (AML) at some 
frequency  independent of drug exposure.  Such events include known consequences of the 
underly ing disease or condition under investigation (e.g., s ymptoms, disease progression) 
and events unlik ely to be related to the underl ying disease or condition under investigation 
but common in the study  population independent of drug therap y (e.g., cardiovascular 
events in an elderly  population).
These events are listed in Appendix F(Adverse Events Commonly  Associated with AML 
Study  Population or Progression of AML).
These adverse events may occur alone or in various combinations and are considered 
expected for reporting purposes for this protocol.
Cytopenias (anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocy topenia) are part of the natural history  of 
AML .  Persistent cy topenias at the same CTCAE grade as at baseline are not to be 
reported as adverse events, unless they fulfill a seriousness criteria, result in perm anent 
discontinuation of a study drug, or the investigator had an identifiable cause other than the 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)

underly ing disease.  However, all laboratory  data should be entered regardless of whether 
an adverse event is reported.
Although exempted from expedited rep orting to Health Authorities and IRBs as 
individual cases, if an event commonly associated with AML  or progression of AML 
meets seriousness criteria (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) it must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.  For deaths 
related to disease progression, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the 
appropriate case repo rt form, but the death will not be expedited as an individual case 
safet y report (ICSR) to regulatory authorities.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severit y of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Termin ology  Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE 
Version 4.0).[ADDRESS_1069846] an y changes due to the increase in severity .
For adverse events not captured by [CONTACT_416992], the following

6.1.3 Adverse Events Expected Due to Study  Related Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
For this protocol, overall survival is an efficacy endpoint.
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see 
Section 6.1.5) that are attributed by [CONTACT_778694] y on the Study  Completion and Death eCRF.  All other on -study  deaths, 
regardless of relationship to study  drug, must be recorded on the Adverse E vent eCRF and 
immediately  reported to the Sponsor (see Section 6.1.6).
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generall y, only  one such event should be reported.  
The term "sudden death" should only  be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and 
unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without pre -existing 
heart disease, within [ADDRESS_1069852] seen alive and stable.  If the 
cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, 
"unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the cause of 
death later becomes available (e.g., after autops y), "unexplained death" s hould be replaced 
by [CONTACT_25749].
[IP_ADDRESS] Lack of Efficacy  or Worsening of Disease
Events that are clearl y consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underly ing disease are also considered an expected outcome for this study  and w ill not be 
subject to expedited reporting.
6.1.4 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of stud y drug:

Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors includ ing timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there 
is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there 
is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal 
relationship.
For causality  assessments, events ass essed as having a reasonable possibility  of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, when the inv estigator has not reported causality  or deemed it not assessable, 
[COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_237421], an "Other" cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator for the serious 
adverse event.

6.1.8 Toxicity  Management
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition –Dose Limiting Toxicity
Dose limiting toxicities (DL Ts) for dose -escalation purposes will be determined during 
Cycle 1 (4 weeks) of study  treatment.  Adverse events that occur after the first cy cle will 
also be evaluated b y the investigator and the [COMPANY_013] medical monitor and may be 
considered as dose limiting.
Any of the following events, which cannot be attributed by  [CONTACT_43073] a clearl y 
identifiable cause such as tumor progression, underlying illness, concurrent illness, or 
concomitant medication, will be considered a DLT:
●Grade [ADDRESS_1069861] possibly  related to 
the study  drug, except those listed in Appendix F.
●Grade 4 or 5 pancy topenia with a hy pocellular bone marro w and no greater 
than or equal to 5% marrow blasts lasting for 42 days or more.
Any DLT will require an interruption and possible discontinuation of venetoclax or L DC.  
Venetoclax and LDC therap y ma y be reintroduced at a reduced dose, if the toxicity  grad e 
returns to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_1069862] 
tolerated dose level.  All decisions regarding continued dosing for individual subjects will

[IP_ADDRESS] Prophy laxis and Management of Tumor Lysis Sy ndrome 
(TLS)
There is a potential for TLS for patients with AML receiving induction therap y, especiall y 
for those with elevated pretreatment LDH levels, elevated leukocyte count, renal 
dysfunct ion, and deh ydration.  To mitigate the risk for TL S,36subjects will receive tumor 
lysis proph ylaxis, including h ydration (e.g., oral, intravenous) and treatment with an agent 
to reduce the uric acid level (e.g., allopurinol, rasburicase).36,[ADDRESS_1069864] new escalated dose.

TLS, no additional venetoclax doses should be administered until resolution.
Refer to Table 10(footnote "a") for a special sample handling procedure that must be 
followed to avoid ex vivo uric acid degradation in the presence of rasburicase.
Drug interruption for up to 72 hours following transient (i.e., lasting < 48 hours) chemica l 
changes and laboratory  TLS may  be allowed and will not require a dose reduction.  If the 
TLS has not resolved within 72 hours, then a dose reduction should be considered.
If TL S requires a dose hold or dose modifications, after resolution of electroly te 
imbalances ( Appendix E), venetoclax may  be continued at the same dose per discussion 
between the investigator and the [COMPANY_013] medical monitor.
Tumor Lysis Syndrome Prophylaxis and Management in Phase 2 Cohort C –

All subjects enrolled into Phase 2 Cohort C will need TLS proph ylaxis and monitoring.  
Below are the minimum requirements for TL S prophy laxis and management for subjects 
enrolled into the expansion phase.  All other prophylaxis and monitoring proce dures for 
TLS will be done as per institutional/regional standards:
●All subjects will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_778666]  [ADDRESS_1069870] for 24 hours after reachi ng the final dose of venetoclax . TLS chemistry  
tests should be confirmed 24 hours after reaching the maximal dose of 
venetoclax.
●Administration of uric acid reducing agent, adequate oral and intravenous 
hydration while monitoring the fluid status of the subject prior to and during 
the ramp- up of venetoclax will be based on regional standards or institutional 
guidelines.
●Tumor Ly sis S yndrome chemistry tests to be drawn (calcium, inorganic 
phosphorus, potassium, uric acid, and creatinine) on the first day  of venetoclax 
dosing and each day  of a new dose at 0 (within 4 hours prior to dosing) and 6 –
[ADDRESS_1069871] dose.* Add itional laboratory  assessments may  be performed, per 
investigator discretion, post -dose during ramp -up and up to 48 hours after 
reaching final dose if clinically  indicated.
●Abnormal chemistry tests should be corrected promptly .
●If a subject meets criteria for clinicall y significant laboratory or clinical TLS, 
no additional venetoclax dose should be administered until resolution.
○Prophy lactic r eductions of potassium, inorganic phosphorus and/or uric 
acid above normal range are recommended prior to beginning stud y 
treatment and continue based on the ongoing risk of TL S.
* Chemistry samples (calcium, inorganic phosphorus, potassium, uric acid, and creatinine) must be reviewed by [CONTACT_778696]'s next dose to ensure appropriate subject management.  Based upon 
the results, subjects may need further monitoring or may need additional post- dose labs.  Refer to Appendix E
(Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrolyte Imbalances and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome

For continued dosing of venetoclax, monitor for evidence of TLS during treatment, and 
manage abnormalities in serum creatinine, uric acid and electrol ytes promptly .  For 
subjects at higher risk (e.g., circulating blasts), more intensive measures should be 
considered.
Refer to Table 10(footno te "a") for a special sample handling procedure that must be 
followed to avoid ex vivo uric acid degradation in the presence of rasburicase.
Drug interruption for up to 72 hours following transient (i.e., lasting < 48 hours) chemical

TLS has not resolved within 72 hours, then a dose reduction should be considered.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of My elosuppresion (Cy topenias)
Venetoclax
Myelosuppression and the related adverse events (thro mbocy topenia, anemia, neutropenia, 
and febrile neutropenia) are common in both treated and untreated subjects with AML .  
Subjects with baseline neutropenia or have significant bone marrow involvement may  be 
particularl y at high risk.  If a participant achi eves a CR or CRi or is found to have a 
morphologicall y leukemia free bone marrow, and has Grade 4 neutropenia or 
thrombocy topenia, venetoclax should be held from Day  28 until ANC ≥500 –1000/µL  
and platelets ≥ 25 –100 × 105/μL.  At the investigator's dis cretion, subjects may  resume a 
subsequent cy cle of therapy  after a [ADDRESS_1069873] in CR presents with new onset Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia for more 
than 1 week, unless it is due to the unde rlying disease, venetoclax dosing may  be 
interrupted until ANC recovery  to ≥500 – 1000/µL or platelets ≥ 25 –100 × 105/μL per 
investigator discretion in consultation with the [COMPANY_013] medical monitor.  Venetoclax may 
be re -initiated at a lower dose per dis cussion with the [COMPANY_013] medical monitor.

Administration of venetoclax in subjects with ly mphoproliferative disorders has been 
associated with clinicall y significant l ymphopenia (B and T l ymphocy te subty pes).  If 
clinically  indicated in AML  subjects treated in this study , anti -infective prophy laxis 
should be implemented at the investigator's discretion, including appropriate proph ylaxis 
for viral, fungal, bacterial or Pneumocystis infections.  Potential for drug -drug interactions 
should be considered.  Pleas e refer to Table 1and Appendix Cfor a d escription of 
excluded and cautionary  medications.
If a subject is continuing to respond based on the bone marrow assessment beyond 
Cycle2 of treatment but has persistent neutropenia or thrombocy topenia venetoclax dose 
may be reduced as follows:

factors).
Myelosuppression caused by  [CONTACT_778697].  Comple te blood and platelet counts 
should be performed regularly, as clinicall y indicated and prior to each treatment cycle.  
In the presence of my elosuppression or its complications, treatment with LDC may  be 
interrupted or supportive measures instituted.
LDC d ose reductions are not ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y recommended.  If a dose reduction is believed to be 
necessary  a discussion with the [COMPANY_013] medical monitor is required.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Decreased Spermatogenesis
Based on findings in a preclinical study  of venetoclax, there i s a potential for decreased 
spermatogenesis.  Male subjects should consider sperm banking before treatment with 
venetoclax if they  are considering preservation of fertility .
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Other Toxicities
If other events occur that are related to venetocla x or LDC the investigator, in consultation 
with the [COMPANY_013] medical monitor, may  interrupt or dose reduce venetoclax and/or 
reference therap y, as appropriate.  Grade 3 or greater nonhematologic toxicity 
(e.g., nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea when additional supportive care fails), that is related 
to venetoclax or LDC will require interruption and possible discontinuation of dosing.  
Venetoclax or LDC may  be reintroduced, but only at a reduced dose, (in consultation with 
the [COMPANY_013] medical monitor) if the toxi city returns to ≤ Grade 1 or to baseline if Grade 2

computed for each sampling time and each parameter.
[IP_ADDRESS] Model and Tests
All analyses will be perform ed on the Phase 1 portion subjects only .
Dose Proportionality and Covariate Selection of Venetoclax 
The following anal ysis will be performed separately  on C ycle 1 Day 10 and Cycle 1 
Day 18 venetoclax PK parameters.
An anal ysis will be performed for dose -normalized C max, AUC 24, and other PK parameters 
provided that they  can be adequatel y determined from the data.  The model used for the 
statistical analy ses will include designated cohort dose level.  This may  be done by  
[INVESTIGATOR_27792] (ABT -199/GDC -0199)

classify ing subjects by  [CONTACT_778698], if appropriate, using dose level as a continuous 
variable.  Covariates such as age, bod y weight, body surface area, gender, and perhaps 
others that might explain some of the variabilit y in the population will be included in the 
model initially .  However, a covariate may  be dropped from the model if the regression 
coefficient is not significant at alpha level 0.10.  The natural logarithmic transformation 
will be employ ed for C maxand the AUC's unless the data clearl y indicate that other 
transformation or t he untransformed variable provides more nearly  symmetric probability  
distributions and/or more nearly homogenous variances across dose levels.  Within the 
framework of the model, tests that have good power for a trend with dose will be 
performed on the eff ect of designated cohort dose level.
Venetoclax Effect on Cytarabine Pharmacokinetics Parameters
A linear mixed effects analy sis will be performed for C max, AUC tand AUC ∞, to compare 
cytarabine PKparameters when co- administered with venetoclax (Cycle 1Day 10) 
relative to cy tarabine a dministered alone (C ycle 1 Day 1).  For C maxand AUC, the 
logarithmic transformation will be used unless the data indicate that the logarithm has 
significant non- normality.  The model will include effects for visit (Cy cle 1 Da y 1, 
Cycle1 Day  10).  To account for the correlation among visits, the repeated statement for 
the visit effect will be specified under SAS procedure mixed.  The relative bioavailability 
of cy tarabine co -administered with venetoclax relative to cy tarabine alone will be 
estimated and a 90% confidence interval will be provided for each of C maxand AUC.  The 
confidence intervals will be obtained b y the antilogarithm of the endpoints of confidence 
intervals for the difference of mean logarithms obtained within the mixed modeling 
framework.
Cytarabine Effect on Venetoclax Pharmacokinetics Parameters
A similar anal ysis to venetoclax effect on cy tarabine PK parameters will be performed on 
Cycle 1 Day  10 and C ycle 1 Day  18 venetoclax PK parameters.

[IP_ADDRESS] Missing Values and Model Violations
All available data will be included the mixed effect analyses.  Data exclusion, if any, will 
be documented and justification provided.
Normally  distributed values of PK variables (C max, AUC, etc.) will be determined without 
replacing mis sing individual concentration values, simply  using the available data, and if 
necessary  doing the analy sis with some missing values for a PK variable.  However, if a 
missing individual concentration results in a value of a PK parameter that may be too low 
or too high to a meaningful degree, the value of the PK parameter will tentatively be 
considered missing.  In this case, a value for the missing individual concentration may be 
imputed so that an appropriate value of the PK parameter can be included in the analysis.  
The imputed value will be obtained using appropriate methodology that takes into account 
the individual characteristics of the subject.
If an outlier is identified and/or a pronounced non -normal probability  distribution is 
observed (after logar ithmic transformation for C maxand AUC), then a non -parametric 
analysis may  also be performed.  Such a model violation may  be identified by  [CONTACT_778699], measures of non -normality  (e.g., skewness, kurtosis) or other appropriate 
methods.  If the regime ns have unequal variances to the extent that conclusions might be 
affected, then approximate methods that allow for unequal variances will be used.
8.1.3 Efficacy  Summaries
Efficacy  will include analyses of ORR as defined by  [CONTACT_240316] + CRi + PR, CR rate, CRi rate, 
CRh rate, CR + CRi rate, CR + CRh rate, DOR, EFS, OS, the exploratory analysis of the

[IP_ADDRESS].1 Overall Response Rates
CRh (Complete remission with partial hematologic recovery) is a derived response based 
on bone marrow blast cou nt and hematology  lab values.  A response of CRh is achieved 
when the following criteria are met:
●Bone marrow with < 5% blasts and 
●peripheral blood neutrophil count of ≥ 0.5 × 103/µL* and
●peripheral blood platelet count ≥ 0.5 × 105/µL.*
*For a bone marro w sample collected before the last cy cle of study  treatment, the 
hematology  lab results collected from the date of bone marrow sample collection up to 
Day [ADDRESS_1069885] cycle of stud y treatment, the hematology 
lab results collected within 14 days after bone marrow sample collection date will be used 
for CRh anal ysis.
CR + CRh rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR or CRh at 
any time point during the study .  Subjects who never achieve CR or CRh or have not had 
IWG disease assessment will be considered to be non -responders in the calculation of 
CR+ CRh rate.
Overall response rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a CR, CRi,

8.2 Determination of Sample Size
This is a Phase 1/2 study  where the Phase 1 portion is a dose escalation study  and the 
Phase 2 portion is a dose expansion study .
For the Phase 1 portion of the study, the sample size is dependent upon the dose levels 
utilized and whether toxicities require and allow enrollment of 3 or 6 subjects to dose 
levels.
For the initial Phase 2 portion, approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled.  With 
50subjects, the 95% confidence intervals for estimation of ORR would have a margin of 
error not exceeding ± 15%.  Clopp er and Pearson 95% confidence intervals for expected 
observed rates for a sample size of 50 subjects are shown in Table 13.  With 50 subjects,

For Cohort C, approximately  20 subjects will be enrolled to assess the experience of 
dosing venetoclax with LDC to evaluate if the efficacy  of the combination is still 
consistent with that observed in previously treated subjects.  These factors include mor e 
objectively  defined criteria with a lower age limit, modification to the venetoclax dose to 
account for strong CYP3A inhibitors, and potential reduction in liver/kidney function 
allowed for enrollment.  With 20 subjects, the ORR and Clopper and Pearson 9 5% 
confidence interval are specified in Table 14.

Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, an y protocol 
amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of 
subject information related to the study  (e.g., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and
any other necessary  documents be reviewed by [CONTACT_18369]/IRB.  The IEC/IRB will review the 
Venetoclax (ABT -199/GDC -0199)
M14 -[ADDRESS_1069901] 2014 -002610 -23

ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  
IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or 
advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a 
study  site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/I RB approval prior to implementation 
of an y changes made to the study design.  The investigator will be required to submit, 
maintain and archive study  essential documents according to ICH GCP.
Serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated b y local regulations, 
will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencie s as 
required b y local regulations.  During the conduct of the study, the investigator should 
promptly  provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports or any additional reports 
required b y local regulations) to the IEC/I RB of any  changes that affect t he conduct of the 
study  and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the 
IEC/IRB should also be provided to [COMPANY_013].
9.[ADDRESS_1069902] of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonization (I CH) GCP guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing 
clinical study  conduct and ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  
In the event a significant disaster/crisis (e.g., epid emic/pandemic, natural disaster, 
conflict/combat) occurs leading to difficulties in performing protocol -specified procedures, 
[COMPANY_013] may  engage with study  site personnel in efforts to ensure the safety of subjects, 
maintain protocol compliance, and minimiz e risks to the integrit y of the study while 
trying to best manage subject continuity  of care.  This may  include alternative methods for 
assessments (e.g., phone contacts or virtual site visits), alternative locations for data 
collection (e.g., use of a loc al lab instead of a central lab), and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_17168]/or supplies direct to subjects to ensure continuity of treatment where allowed.

Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in Appe ndix A.
9.[ADDRESS_1069904] Information and Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study  to the subject, 
and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any stud y-related screening 
procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be 
reviewed and signed and dated b y the subject, the person who administered the informed 
consent, and an y other signatories according to local requirements. A copy  of the 
informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the 
subject's medical record.  An entry  must also be made in the subject's dated source 
documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to an y study -related 
procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation 
in the study  can be found in the informed consent form.
In the event a subject withdraws consent to participate from the stud y, stored 
pharmacogenetic and pharmacod ynamic samples will continue to be used for research and 
analysis.  In the event that a subject would like to withdraw consent for research using 
these samples, the subject may  request that their samples be withdrawn.  Once [COMPANY_013] 
receives the request, remaining samples will be destroy ed.  If the subject changes his/her 
consent, and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as part of 
the overall research data.
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, it is possible that additional protocol modifications not 
outlined in this protocol may become necessary .  If this situation arises, in addit ion to the

Potassium ≥ 0.5 mmol/L increase from 
prior value (even if potassium within 
normal limits [WNL])Recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and 
creatinine in 1 hour STAT.  If further ≥ 0.2 mmol/L increase in 
potassium, but still < upper limit of normal (ULN), manage as 
per potassium ≥ ULN.  Otherwise recheck in 1 hour.
Resume per protocol testing if change in potassium is 
<0.2mmol/L, and potassium < ULN, and no other evidence of 
tumor lysis.
At discretion of investigator, may recheck prior to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  If stable or decreased, and still within normal 
limits (WNL), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_778671].  Potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and 
creatinine must be rechecked within 24 hours.
Potassium > upper limit of normal Perform STAT ECG and commence telemetry
Nephrology (or other acute dialysis se rvice) notification with 
consideration of initiating dialysis.
Administer Kayexalate 60 g (or Resonium A 60 g).
Administer furosemide 20 mg IV × 1.
Administer calcium gluconate 100 – 200 mg/kg IV slowly if 
there is ECG/telemetry evidence of life-threatening arrhythmias.
Recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and 
creatinine in 1 hour STAT.
If potassium < ULN 1 hour later, repeat potassium, phosphorus, 
uric acid, calcium and creatinine 1, 2 and 4 hours, if no other 
evidence of tumor lysis.
Potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L (6.0 mEq/L) 
and/or symptomatic (e.g., muscle cramps, 
weakness, paresthesias, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea)Perform STAT ECG and commence telemetry.
Nephrology (or other acute dialysis service) assessment with 
consideration of initiating dialysis.
Administer Kayexalate 60 g (or Resonium A 60 g).
Administer furosemide 20 mg IV × 1.
Administer insulin 0.1 U/kg IV + D25 2 mL/kg IV.
Administer sodium bicarbonate 1 –2 mEq/kg IV push.
o If sodium bicarbonate is used, rasburicase should not be 
used as this may exacerbate calcium phosphate 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332].
Administer calcium gluconate 100 – 200 mg/kg IV slowly if 
there is ECG/telemetry evidence of life -threatening arrhythmias.  
Do not administer in same IV line as sodium bicarbonate.

Section 3.3  Benefits and Risks
Add:  new last paragraph
Considering the coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to subjects 
participating in this study has been re -evaluated. Subjects receiving venetoclax may  be at 
an increased risk for COVID- 19 infection or experience serious illness if infected. 
Management of these adverse events will be mad e on a case -by-case basis with 
consideration of benefit/risk. However, based on the population and disease being studied 
and the anticipation that COVID -19 related risks are not expected to differ substantially  
between stud y subjects and the broader popul ation of subjects receiving treatment for 
AML , no change to the benefit/risk balance for subjects in this study  is expected.

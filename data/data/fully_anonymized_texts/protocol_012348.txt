 Background 
Women V eterans  are a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_521331].  While entitled to receive care equivalent 
to their male counterparts, achievement of this goal is often complicated by a VA primary care workforce that 
has limited exposure to caring for women and , for patients in community -based outpatient clinics (CBOCs), 
significant  distance s to sour ces of women’s health (WH) expertise.  This p roposal aims to test a provider 
education and interactive communication intervention  for improving WH care in CBOCs.    
It is particularly challenging to deliver comprehensive WH care (i.e. the full spectrum of primary, specialty, and 
mental health care, both gender -specific and gender -neutral) in CBOCs.  CBOCs were developed to improv e 
access to VA primary care (PC), reducing distances Veterans need to travel to receive basic services .1 They 
were never set up to handle the complexity of services needed by [CONTACT_521361][INVESTIGATOR_521332] (e.g, reproductive health care, post traumatic stress disorder, sequelae of military 
sexual trauma).
[ADDRESS_676188] wom en’s health specialty clinics and 
struggle to offer on- site PC  services specific to women’s needs.5-[ADDRESS_676189] travel 
significant distances to VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) or use healthcare settings outside the VA to access WH 
expertise.9  They also experience care fragmentation due to provider and site discontinuity.  Further, with 
CBOC PC providers’ (PCPs) small caseloads of women Veterans, and therefore limited ongoing exposure to a 
depth and breadth of WH issues, it is difficult for CBOC providers to maintain their WH knowledge and skills.10 
Recent data demonstrates that women Veterans  give lower ratings for the WH skills of PCPs  at small caseload 
CBOCs, compared with PCPs  at large VA sites with WH centers.8 
Although we know that improved provider knowledge and skills are essential for provider behavior change (and therefore, improved care), we also know that they generally are not sufficient.
[ADDRESS_676190] been shown t o be effective in promoting and supporting provider 
behavior change.26  One such mechanism is interactive communication, defined as the “timely, two- way 
exchange of pertinent clinical information, directly between primary care and specialist physicians.”[ADDRESS_676191] interaction with specialists (rather than communication via chart notes).
28   When such 
interactions are done informally, they are referred to as “curbside consultations.”  A cross -sectional survey of 
PCPs found that 70% had participated in at least one curbside consultation in the previous week.[ADDRESS_676192], the VA established “Designated Women’s Health Providers” (DWHPs) in 
CBOCS to consolidate the care of CBOC women Veterans to 1- 2 providers, thereby [CONTACT_521362]’ WH caseloads.  Second, the VA instituted intensive one- time training opportunities —“WH mini -
residencies” —for DWHPs.[ADDRESS_676193] an intervention for DWHP Support  to improve CBOC delivery of comprehensive WH care.  
DWHP Support  will be a combination of: 1) advanced WH serial patient -based education that exposes 
DWHPs, over time, to a depth and breadth of WH cases and issues; and 2) interactive communication 
between CBOC DWHPs and VAMC -based WH specialists for “just in time” support of  DWHP WH care.  It will 
be technology -supported and delivered non- face- to-face.    
This proposal features Electronic Consults  and DWHP -Specialist Clinical Tele -Videoconferencing (CTV), two 
potential mechanisms for improving and maintaining DWHP know ledge and skills and increasing 
communication between CBOC -based DWHPs and WH specialists.  Technology -based care models have been 
proposed as being potentially efficient, cost -efficient (or even cost -reducing) mechanisms of overcoming 
specialty physician s hortages in certain geographic regions (e.g., rural areas), providing continuing medical 
Version 12-15-15  3 
 education, and improving care quality.29-31   Two such models, electronic -consults (“e- consults”) and grouped 
PCP-Specialist Clinical Tele-Videoconferencing (CTV ), are foci of this proposal.   
Electronic consults  (“e-consults) are asynchronous PC –specialist communication via an electronic medium 
(e.g., secure messaging, e- mail, or computerized note entry).32  It formalizes and all ows for  long- distance 
“curbside consultations .”  E-consults allow PCPs to obtain access to the clinical expertise of a specialist 
without the patient having a separate appointment with the specialist, thereby [CONTACT_521363]. The PCP sub mits a consultation request for a defined clinical question pertaining to a patient. The 
specialist reviews the patient’s chart, as needed, and provides an answer electronically, requests more 
information , or advises that the patient should receive an in- person consultation (so that the specialist can 
perform an enhanced examination or perform a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention).   
Another complementary approach that has been used successfully to build PCP knowledge and skills and enhance 
provider com munication is group PCP -specialist clinical tele -videoconferencing (CTV) sessions. These sessions 
provide participating PCPs with serial patient -based advanced education by [CONTACT_521364], over time, to a depth 
and breadth of cases and issues within a defined clinical area. Prior to each session, PCPs submit data on patients 
about whom the PCPs are seeking diagnostic and/or therapeutic management advice from a multidisciplinary 
specialist team.  The team reviews the submitted information prior to the session.   During the scheduled session, a 
specialist team at a “hub” facility and PCPs at multiple “spoke” locations see and hear each other (via CTV) and 
engage in a real -time discussion about the management of the submitted patient cases.  The specialist team,  in 
addition to giving recommendations, discusses the evidence and/or rationale behind the recommendations, thereby 
[CONTACT_521365]’s educational value.  The PCP who submitted the consult, as well as other PCPs participating 
in the session, interact  with the specialist team, asking clarifying questions.  The specialist team also provides a 
brief didactic relevant to the cases discussed.  Such sessions have been shown, in one setting and condition, to 
improve PCP capacity to manage complex patients and positively affect patient care outcomes.  Specifically, 
University of New Mexico implemented such a  program for management of patients with hepatitis C , and, in a 
controlled trial, showed that PCPs who engaged in group CTV sessions with hepatologists improved patient access 
and achieved clinical outcomes  comparable to those of the hepatologists.38,39 
We hypothesize that DWHP Support will improve the quality and efficiency of WH care in CBOCs.  
Our specific aims are :   
Aim #1 : To evaluate the effect of DWHP Support  on WH  care quality and efficiency, using a 
stepped wedge design;  
Aim #2 : To explore the impact  of DWHP Support  in chang ing DWHP  behavior  and self-rated 
WH knowledg e, skills, and self -efficacy;  
Aim #3:  To assess attitudes about DWHP Support  and its use, specialist time for its 
implementation, and other features that could influence DWHP Support ’s effectiveness, 
sustainability and spread;  
Aim # 4: To develop tools to measure quality of WH care in VA.  
This proposed research project  was developed in partnership with VA Patient Care Services’ Women’s  Health 
Services (WHS ) and Specialty Care Services (SCS), VISN 22, and VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare 
System.  It will i mpact VA practice  and policies in women Veterans’ health care, access, and q uality  (HSR&D 
priority areas) as well as other specialty areas.  Further, it w ill advance science in both WH care quality 
measurement and the delivery of health care through non- face- to-face interactions.   
 
Research Design and Methods  
 Study Design and Overview : We propose to conduct a prospective, modified stepped wedge trial of DWHP  
Support  for DWHPs in healthcare systems that participate in Gynecology SCAN -ECHO and have gynecology 
e-consults. To accommodate facility and VISN needs , we will work with our facility and women’s health 
partners to stage the assignments for the stepped wedge rollout  (i.e., it will not be randomized).  We will 
introduce the intervention throughout one healthcare system  at each step, with the intervention being directed 
to all DWHPs in that healthcare system .
 
 
 We will use a mixed methods analytic approach to measure the intervention’s effect, while also evaluat ing the 
Version 12-15-[ADDRESS_676194] implementation in VA, as well as inform future trials.  An advantage of our modified stepped wedge 
approach is that our intervention will occur in the “ real world” , i.e., not in  a highly controlled experimental 
setting ; this enhances the potential external validity of the intervention and thereby [CONTACT_521366] t o other VISNs, should it prove effective.  
 
Setting  and Participants: DWHP  Support  will be implement ed in healthcare systems  in VISN  22 and at other 
VA sites  nationally . VISN 22 encompasses Southern [LOCATION_004] and the Las Vegas area. It has a racial ly and 
ethnic ally divers e women Veteran population, with 68% non- Hispanic White, 5% non- Hispanic Black, 21% 
Hispanic, and 6% other racial/ethnic groups.45  The participants will be DWHP s in th ose settings .   
DWHP Identification: We will identify DWHPs  in two ways .  First, we will contact [CONTACT_97607]’s Health Medical 
Director for each healthcare system, to obtain a current list of DWHPs.  Second, i n FY12, with funding from the 
WHS (the national WH strategic planning group) , the Women ’s Health Evaluation Initiative (WHEI; PI : [INVESTIGATOR_521333]) 
is generating and validating a list of DWHPs by [CONTACT_521367]. To identify our sample of DWHPs, at  the start of this 
study, we will use these data sources  to obtain the list of  participating site  DWHPs and their provider ID 
numbers . We will adhere to VA policy regarding secure data transfer to obtain this list.  
Patient Identification:  To identify patients who received care from  participating site  DWHP s, we will use  the 
Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW ) – national patient -level administrative data for VHA -provided health care 
encounters  This was data previously contained in the  VHA Medical SAS (MedSAS) Outpatient Events (SE) 
and Visits (SF) datasets .47 We will obtain this data through VINCI, VA’s platform for accessing CDW for 
research.  
 
Intervention : DWHP  Support  will be comprised of two components. [1] Gynecology (Women’s Health) E -
consult s: This is asynchronous PC consultation primarily via electronic communication;  the telephone may also 
be used if needed . The  DWHP  will electronically message a gynecologist for expert guidance  on WH issues 
that are within the scope of practice for the PC setting ( i.e., medical  and gynecologic in the Handbook 
1330.01), but about which the DWHP  needs additional guidance.  The PC  consultation component, adapted 
from the SCS’s e-consult program, formalizes and allows for long -distance “curbside” consultations that are 
often used by [CONTACT_521368], multi -disciplinary settings. All e -consults will be answered within three  business 
days. The gynecologists , who will have dedicated time protected, through clinical funds, to answer these 
consults, will  review the patient’s chart as needed, and provide an answer electronically . The DWHP is 
responsible for acting on the recommendations and/or submitting a request for an in- person consultation,  if this 
is the recommendation or they are not comfortable implementing the care plan.  The DWHP can also 
electronically  ask the gynecologist clarifying  or additional questions, if needed.  If necessary, phone calls 
between the DWHP and gynecologist will be arranged.  [2]  SCAN -ECHO :  In these monthly group interactive 
case consultation conferences, held via CTV , cases are submitted  to the multidisciplinar y team  by [CONTACT_521369] , with defined clinical questions pertaining to a patient . Cases will be select ed by [CONTACT_521370]; those not selected will be  answered electronically or by [CONTACT_756]  (and 
thereby [CONTACT_521371] e -consults) . The gynecologist  discusses the case with the patient’s DWHP , with other DWHP s 
observing. For each session, the gynecologist  also gives a 15 -minute didactic related to the discussed case. 
Each tele- video conference thereby, in addition to providing expert consultation for the care of that patient, 
educates all the participating DWHP s on their care of patients with similar conditions. Participants receive 
continuing medical education (CME) credits  for each SCAN -ECHO session.   
 Usual Care: Usual care in VA CBOCs includes availability of patient referral for in- person specialist  
consultation (typi[INVESTIGATOR_521334] ); access to web -based tools such as UpToDate,
50 a clinical decision 
support system  to which the VA subscribes ; and access to  monthly WH cyber -seminars .

collection time points , and key measures  to achieve our specific aims are discussed by [CONTACT_298632], and

Specific Aim #1 : To evaluate the effect  of DWHP Support  on WH care quality and efficiency  using a stepped 
wedge design with sites participating in DWHP Support .  
We hypothesize that DWHP Support will improve the quality and efficiency of WH care in CBOCs . We expect 
that these effects may be influenced by [CONTACT_521373] (e.g. , time in practice), patient 
conditions and characteristics, and practice characteristics,  as well as DWHPs’ use of the intervention.  For this 
aim, our analytic sample will be limited to sites participating in DWHP Support  outside of GLA, given that 
DWHP s upport was pi[INVESTIGATOR_521335] a recent “control” period (i.e., GLA was 
contaminated by [CONTACT_32360][INVESTIGATOR_2268]).  We will, however, use GLA data to pi[INVESTIGATOR_521336] (EMR) data 
abstraction procedures . We will also collect GLA e -consult data because this data were not contaminated by 
[CONTACT_32360][INVESTIGATOR_521337]- ECHO at GLA.   
 
Dependent Variables : The main outcome measures will be  quality  of care defined  by [CONTACT_521374] . We will assess quality  of care  and efficiency  of care using  the VA electronic medical records (EMR) 
of all female patients seen by [CONTACT_521375]. With the modified stepped wedge 
design, each participating site healthcare system is contributing data to both intervention and control periods , 
thereby  [CONTACT_521376] .  We expect to identify multiple epi[INVESTIGATOR_521338] , where w e define an epi[INVESTIGATOR_521339] a WH condition, irrespective of whether it occurs over one or multiple encounters, and is face -to-face or 
not.[ADDRESS_676195] (EMR) data abstraction : To assemble the relevant data from the EMR using the VHA 
Health Information Access (HIA) program’s Data Use Agreement protocols, we will  use the Corporate Data 
Warehouse (CDW ), accessed through VINCI and discussed above and, as needed, the Compensation and 
Version 12-15-[ADDRESS_676196] Interchange (CAPRI) , which provides direct access to VistA medical records ( Computerized 
Patient Record System, CPRS ) from multiple VistA systems with a single access/verify code51-53 Through the 
VINCI system, we will obtain from CDW lists of all patients seen within participating s ite healthcare systems 
within our data collection periods.   We will maintain these lists in VINCI workspace.   From these lists, we will 
identify patients  seen by [CONTACT_521377].  We will 
then identify the subset of DWHP female patients with the study tracer conditions  for quality assessment . To 
do this, w e will use ICD9 codes, CPT codes, and, for some conditions , consult requests, medications 
prescribed, and/or laboratory tests ordered,  in combination with the previously described DWHP list .   For 
these patients, w e will collect  patient demographics, provider(s) associated with each encounter , clinic stop 
codes (which identifies the clinic type), and all EMR  notes , orders, consult requests, and test results (e.g., 
laboratory, pathology, radiology)  for our data collection periods . This data will be downloaded to the VA GLA 
Research Server . 
EMR de-identification for blinded review : Nurse abstractors and implicit reviewers will be blinded to whether the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_521340] . During an initial training 
period, all records will be reviewed by [CONTACT_521378]. After this initial training period, for the 
duration of the data collection period , records will be randomly spot -checked to verify adherence to the 
protocol.  
Quality of Care –  Guideline- adherent care classification  procedure : We will conduct medical record abstraction 
to identify a sample of epi[INVESTIGATOR_521341].  We will categorize care as guideline-
adherent versus not guideline- adherent. The tracer  conditions will be evaluation/ managemen t of: abnormal 
uterine bleeding;55-58 menopause management,  and urinary incontinence .69 To determine if the care is or is not 
guideline- adherent, we will develop quality measurement tools.  The methods we will use to develop these 
tools are described below  in Specific Aim # 4. 
Trained  chart  abstractors will review each char t to complete the chart abstraction templates with the 
information requested. They will not be making a direct determination of care quality or efficiency, but rather 
obtaining the information for a computeriz ed algorithm that will do this.   A WH specialist  will be available to 
them  to answer questions that may arise. We will develop a database (using REDcap software)  so that data  
may be entered directly into REDcap via a study computer . Senior research staff who are clinicians will 
randomly spot -check chart  abstraction data , throughout  the data collection period, to verify adherence to study 
protocols.  
 
Independent Variables: DWHP  characteristics  may influence the quality and efficiency of the care that they 
provide, as well as their response to t he intervention. We will extract DWHP  characteristics from the Personnel 
and Accounting Integrated Data System (PAID ) Master File, which contains the hum an resources data for all 
VA employees, including provider gender, age, education and licensure (MD, NP, PA), and  medical specialty.71   
We will obtain characteristics of patients  seen by [CONTACT_521379].  
This data will include: female caseload (# of uniques) and workload (# of encounters), female percent  of total 
caseload and workload. We will derive percent of female workload by [CONTACT_67579] (<45, 45- 64, 65+ , 
corresponding to  reproductive age group, age for emergence of chronic conditions, and older).  
 
Aim #1 Statistical Analysis: We will calculate  descriptive statistics of the proportion of CBOC women’s 
primary care that is guideline -adherent . We will examine each of these de scriptive statistics by [CONTACT_228235], and conduct z -tests for differences in proportions between conditions. We will also evaluate a series 
of logistic regression s to test for association of the composite measure of quality with each of the various 
independent variables in order to build a predictive model. Because of the hierarchical nature of the data 
(epi[INVESTIGATOR_521342]), a generalized linear model (GLM) approach  using a  logit link  will 
be used to estimate and test  the significance of the regression coefficients.  
For the analysis of the intervention effect over time, we will conduct a modified stepped -wedge analysis. This 
analysis takes into account the hierarchical natur e of the data, with epi[INVESTIGATOR_521343], and 
being nested within DWHPs. In the stepped wedge analysis, calendar time is divided into steps, corresponding 
to the time periods when providers are initially exposed to the intervention.  
Version 12-15-[ADDRESS_676197] e Size and Power Calculations : The power calculations are predicated on the goal of evaluat ing the 
performance of DWHP s through the epi[INVESTIGATOR_521344]. There  are tw o levels of clustering: DWHP s 
within healthcare systems  and epi[INVESTIGATOR_521345] s. We are making the  assumption that there is 
little or no correlation between the DWHP s. As a result, we performed the calculations via the single level of 
clustering within DWHP s, with the epi[INVESTIGATOR_521346]. We will assume two values for the 
intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC): 0.[ADDRESS_676198] been reported in the literature.72 The calculations assume a two -tailed 5% significance level and power of 
80% to detect a difference between the study arms  (with the study arm referring to intervention versus control, 
and including all data collection in each of those study periods, respectively) . The st atistical test involved is a 
simple z -test for the comparison of two proportions, but the actual analysis will be more sophisticated using 
covariates and adjusting for the actual number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_521347] a given DWHP .  Thus, it can be assumed 
that the sa mple size calculations presented here are conservative.  
With a baseline estimate from our preliminary data that 67% of epi[INVESTIGATOR_521348] , then with 
[ADDRESS_676199] small to medium effects of the intervention  (see Table 2). If 
the baseline proficiency was 80%, then we could detect a medium size intervention effect, whereas if the 
baseline proficiency was 50%, we could detect a very small effect. If we increased the number of eligible 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_521349] 50 per DWHP , then w ith a baseline proficiency of 67%, 
we could detec t a small intervention effect. T he number of available DWHP s (approximately 20 per study arm) 
and epi[INVESTIGATOR_521350] >80% power.

Aim #2 :   
We hypothesize that DWHP Support  will increase DWHPs ’ practice expertise, and thereby [CONTACT_521380] , resulting in improved  quality and efficiency (the focus of Aim 1) . To test this hypothesis, w e 
will collect process outcomes  for the components of the intervention and their effect s on patient care with a 
SCAN/e -consult referring provider survey  (here after referred to as e -consult survey) .  
 
Provider Behavior : e-consult referring DWHP brief surveys : We will obtain the names of participating  
providers who initiat e gynecology e-consults by [CONTACT_521381], through VINCI, a list of all participating 
site gynecology  e-consults .  After each e -consult  has been completed , we will email a request for  the providers 
who initiated the consult to complete a brief survey about the  encounter, including if and how  it impacted their 
management  plan. More specifically, we will ask: to what extent the consult altered the diagnostic , patient 
counseling, and/or treatment plans for this patient; the provider’s confidence in their ability to implement the 
recommended  diagnostic, patient counseling and/or treatment plans; how much, if at all , the provider learned 
something from the consult ; and how, if at all, the consult affected the provider’s plans to refer the patient for 
an in- person consulta tion. For the referring provider surveys, w e will use the  question about effect on the 
provider’s plans to refer the patient to separately estimate number of avoidable consults averted by [CONTACT_521382]  e-consults . An open- ended question, asking for additional comments, will also be included. The 
e-consult referring provider  survey will  be administered online (using Inquisite software ) and responses will be 
confidential .

 Self-rated WH knowledge, skills, and self -efficacy : DWHP self -assessment tool : Prior to the start of DWHP 
Support , or early in its implementation,  and again after  at least  12 months of use  by [CONTACT_172338], we will 
administer a self -assessment tool to all DWHPs  to assess their  self-rated WH knowledge, skills, and self -
efficacy in delivery of WH care.   The self -efficacy assessment is modeled after the WVHSHG mini -residency 
self-evaluation tool, which examined 15 clinical content areas using a 5- point Likert scale.  The 12- month self -
efficacy assessment will be expanded to add items for clinical content areas covered during the SCAN 
sessions. We will also assess perceived change in self -efficacy in WH delivery, and perceptions about 
influences  on this change. We will generate summary descriptive statistics for each of the data fields assessed.  
 
Aim # 3: To assess attitudes about DWHP Support and its use, specialist tim e for its implementation, and other 
features that could influence DWHP Support’s effectiveness, sustainability and spread.   
Because we are interested in affecting CBOC DWHP behavior —as well as knowledge, skills, and self -
efficacy —it is necessary to develop an understanding of the context in which the changes are to occur and the 
resource needs that could impact maintenance of D WHP Support . Accordingly, our evaluation includes 
baseline assessment of DWHP providers, a process evaluation of the intervention, and a post -intervention 
assessment. We do so guided by [CONTACT_39505] -AIM framework  – a comprehensive framework designed to evaluate 
the impact of multilevel interventions in real -world settings .[ADDRESS_676200] of an intervention is due to a combination of its  reach, effectiveness, adoption,  implementation, and 
maintenance . Aim 3 examines reach, adoption, and implementation of DWHP Support . Reach refers to the 
participation rate among those approached , which we will document . Barriers to participation (e.g., scheduling) 
may impact reach, and will be assessed. Adoption concerns the percentage and representativeness of settings 
that will conduct a given program. A doption is impacted by [CONTACT_521383], e.g., level of 
resources and expertise required, and how similar the proposed intervention is to current practices. We will measure potential variables influencing adoption of practice standards . Hypothesized effects of DWHP Support  
include reduced need for in- person specialty consultation, and fewer in- person visits associated with specialty 
consultations; therefore, we will calculate the number of SCAN/e- consults needed to avert one in- person 
specialist visit. Implementation refers to intervention integrity, or the q uality and consistency of delivery. We will 
conduct a process evaluation to provide a context for the effectiveness findings, and to define resources and 
other factors that influence implementation.  
Semi -structured interviews  will be conducted with all DWHP s to assess their attitudes and beliefs regarding the 
proposed intervention (platforms and content), and motivation and opportunity for its use.  Use of other care 
delivery and educational supports and participant characteri stics will be assessed during the interview. We will 
also assess prior exposure to SCAN -ECHO clinics  and electronic consultations  for other clinical areas.  All 
interviews will be digitally recorded and professionally transcribed. For respondents who are i nterviewed after 
the start of the intervention, we will  ask about exposure to SCAN and e- consults for other clinical areas.  With 
an eye toward potential maintenance of the intervention, participants will be asked to provide recommendations for sustainabil ity and spread.   
 
Qualitative Data Analysis: All digital recordings of semi -structured interviews will be sent to Keystrokes, a VA -
approved medical transcription company, via a secure website for verbatim transcription. Transcripts will be 
reviewed and edited for accuracy by [CONTACT_464]. Analysis of the qualitative data will be conducted using 
ATLAS.ti, a qualitative data analysis software program that allows for fluid “interaction” of data across types 
and sources. Initially, a top -level codebook will be developed for the baseline interviews based on the interview 
guide.75  Using a constant comparison analytic approach, this codebook will be elaborated upon based on 
emergent themes, and it will be adjusted as each round of interviews is reviewed. Interviews will be compared 
across  DWHPs , and over time.  
In the pre- intervention transcripts (i.e., baseline assessment ), we will identify commonly shared knowledge, 
attitudes, and beliefs related to the intervention’s potential for effectiveness  as well a s motivation and 
opportunity to use the intervention. We will synthesize this information to create baseline summaries . In post-
intervention interview data, we will assess adoption, focusing on factors facilitating and impeding 
implementation of the interv ention, and strengths and weaknesses of the intervention as implemented. In 
conjunction with logs that will be maintained during the intervention, we will assess the extent to which the 
Version 12-15-15  9 
 intervention was utilized by [CONTACT_20898] (i.e., “reach”), and we will identif y which components and/or content was 
most salient for participants. We will examine whether (and why) this differs among DWHPs.  
 
 
Aim # 4: To develop tools to measure quality of WH care in VA .  
To complete the work in Aim 1, we will need to develop tools to measure the quality of WH care i n VA.  VA 
monitors two gender -specific quality indicators as part of its annual External Peer Review Program 
performance monitoring –  timely receipt of breast and cervical cancer screening. Though relatively easy to 
measure, there is little variation in these quality indicators across VA sites. [ADDRESS_676201] for each of the selected tracer conditions ( abnormal uterine bleeding;55-58 counseling in patients 
prescribed teratogenic medications, contraception counseling and management ;60,61 preconception 
counseling;66-68 menopause management, and urinary incontinence.69). The goal of Aim 4 is to operationalize 
these guidelines into quality measurement tools.  The process for achieving this aim consists of four steps –  
translating guidelines, defining CPRS data sources and elements, developi[INVESTIGATOR_521354], and 
creating computer progr ams based on specifications. 77  Serial testing and revising will be done within each 
step.   
 
Translating Guidelines:   We will first construct, modify, or augment the algorithm for each guideline.  Next, 
we will translate each guideline into a series of bi nary “if/then” statements.78 We will also define terms as 
needed for clarifying these if/then statements . Two investigators will independently draft these “if/then” 
statements for each guideline and then  reconcile their statements, discussing differences, to form  for each 
guideline one draft series of if/then statements. To validate these if/then statements, these drafts  and the 
guidelines and algorithms associated with them  will then be given to members of our quality measurement tool 
validation, who will comment on our interpretation of the guidelines (to create the algorithm and specify terms) 
and our if/then statements , and then  back -translate them to reconstruct quality guidelines.79 If there are 
discrepancies between the versions reconstructed by [CONTACT_521384], and the actual guidelines, we will 
investigate the source of these discrepancies and modify/clarify our if/then statements as needed. We will do 
this serially until we have a final set of v alidated if/then statements and associated definitions.   
 
Defining CPRS data sources and elements:  We will next define the data sources and elements  for each  
if/then statement.[ADDRESS_676202] .  To reduce the co mplexity of the 
quality assessment process, we will choose a subset of if/then statements for selected aspects of care with 
data sources that are more easily assessable in the electronic medical record (rather than attempt to collect 
data sources for the universe of if/then statements). Once we define all the data sources and elements for 
each if/then statement within a series, we will test them by [CONTACT_521385] a sample of approximately 
10-20 patients with the conditions to verify ou r data sources and elements, revising as needed.  In order to 
identify a sample of 10- 20 patients with each selected  condition, the VINCI data manager will pull the 
electronic medical records of VA Greater Los Angeles women patients from  FY09 to FY13 (approximately 
40,000 records) , as described above. These records will be stored on the VINCI server. Using ICD -9 and CPT 
codes, while working on the VINCI server platform, we will identify the 10 -20 patients with the conditions and 
download these electronic medical records to the VA GLA Research Server  to develop the chart abstraction 
forms.     
 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_521355]: We will then develop chart abstraction forms for each guideline.80  We 
will develop a series of questions that query for these data elements, specifyi ng data sources. We will d evelop 
rules for each question.  For example, again referring to figure 4 , we wil l develop a rule for what needs to be in 
the chart to indicate that the provider “ referred the patient to a surgeon ” (e.g ., submitted a consult request to 
General Surgery).   The form , and its data elements, and abstraction process instructions  will be  developed 
iteratively    with two nurse abstractor s, we will test our  form, rules and guidelines.  With this test, we will ask the 
nurse abstractor s to first review the form and guidelines , letting us know where it needs to be revised f or 
Version 12-15-[ADDRESS_676203] data from 
the EMRs of 10 -20 patients  (identified via the same process as the initial 10- 20 patients, using ICD 9 and CPT 
codes while working on the VINCI server platform) , asking questions when needed and noting difficulties.  We 
will revise the form based on this feedback and then re -test serially until all problems are resolved.    We will 
also develop training materials for our nurse abstractors.  
 
Creating computer programs to operationalize specifications : Finally, we will create a program, using 
STATA 11, to operationalize the specifications and algorithms. As needed by [CONTACT_521386]/then statements, this will 
include variable construction, such as converting linear variables (e.g. age) to bivariates/categorical (e.g., >30 
years of age or < 30). Then we will develop programs to operationalize the algorithms formed with the if/then 
statements to make a final determination of whether or not the care was guideline adherent (as a yes/no 
determination).  For each epi[INVESTIGATOR_9694], all relevant if/then statements must reflect the guideline- adherent 
action in order for that epi[INVESTIGATOR_521356]- adherent.  For cases in which the program 
deter mines the care to not be adherent, the program will also specify where in the algorithm the care failed to 
be guideline adherent. We will test and validate this program for a sample of [ADDRESS_676204] and the 
completed chart abstraction form, to determine if all of the pertinent information is in the form to allow him/her 
to make an accurate decision.      
 
Implicit review forms:  Guided by [CONTACT_521387]’s implicit review form , we will develop a structured 
implicit review form that elicit s judgments from reviewers for defined items for each non- tracer condition 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_9694] . An example of an item is “ rate the quality of care for this epi[INVESTIGATOR_521357] a 5 -point scale.”   
Baseline encounter data will be available at the start of the project for use in developi[INVESTIGATOR_521358].   This form 
will also request informati on about the factors that influenced the quality rating, and this will be coded for all 
implicit review forms .

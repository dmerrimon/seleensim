Version 4.[ADDRESS_460990] launched  similar  length pen 
needles with thinner gauge  needles , such as 33G and 34G.  The intent of this comparative use  
study is to determine whether patient experiences are different when using the BD  Nano ™ PRO  
4mm x 32G extra thin wall , 5-bevel  pen needle (herein referred to as BD Nano ™ PRO) vs 
competitive thinner pen needles  - Artsana Insupen® Extr3me 4mm x 33G, Artsana Insupen® 
Extr3me  3.5mm x 34G and the Simple Diagnostics Comfort EZ ™ 4mm x 33G Pen Needles  
(herein  referred to as comparators ). These experiences include  injection  pain, force to deliver 
dose , bending,  and ability to deliver full dose  (leakage) .  
2.0 OBJECTIVES  
 Primary  Objective  
Demonstrate non -inferiority of the BD Nano ™ PRO  pen needle compared to each  of three (3) 
commercially available comparators (33G and 34G) for injection pain .  
 Secondary Objectives  
Demonstrate superiority  of BD Nano™ PRO  vs each of 3 comparator  pen needle s for the 
following : 
 Leakage from the needle tip and the injection site (measurements combined) after 
removal from body  
 Subject  perceived force required to deliver dose  
 Patient end needle bending after removal from body  
 If primary outcome demonstrates non -inferiority then eval uate for superiority of BD 
Nano™ PRO  vs each comparator.  
 Exploratory Objectives  
Compare BD Nano™ PRO vs each of 3 comparator pen needles  for the following : 
 Injection t ime  
 Patient  end needle breaking at any time  
 Survey responses pertaining to subjective assessments of pen needle characteristics  
3.[ADDRESS_460991]  partially blinded, block randomized, prospective, single -visit, multi -center

Insupen Extr3me  34G and the Simple Diagnostics Comfort EZ ™ 33G Pen Needles) . The 
study will include up to  [ADDRESS_460992] s via a reusable insulin pen device . All pen needles 
will be attached by [CONTACT_368352].  Subjects are to perform 12 injections  into the abdomen  (6 pairs of injections ). 
Pairs of injections will be evaluated  and each pair will contain one BD Nano ™ PRO  and one 
comparator pen needle . Within the [ADDRESS_460993] will experience 2 of each of the following pairs : 
BD Nano™ PRO pen needle vs Artsana Insupen  Extr3me 4mm x 33G x 2  
BD Nano™ PRO pen needle  vs Artsana Insupen  Extr3me 3.5mm x 34G x 2  
BD Nano™ PRO pen needle  vs Simple Diagnostics Comfort EZ ™ 4mm  x 33G x [ADDRESS_460994].  The BD Nano™ PRO  has a distinct configuration and subjects will most likely notice 
the difference vs the comparators .  Subje cts will not be informed of the BD’s or the 
comparator’s  pen needle brand, length or gauge.  
The pen needle order within the pairs of injection s will be randomized  for each s ubject  and 
the pairs will be randomized to various abdominal injection sites  within each subject .  
Besides being informed of the requirement to insert the pen needles ‘straight -in’ 
(perpendicular), subjects will be instructed to use their usual injection technique . 
 Specification of Study Endpoints  
3.2.1  Primary Endpoints  
 Injection Pain  
o Each Subject  will evaluate pain after completion of each pair of injections 
using a 15  cm relative Visual Analog Scale (VAS) .   
3.2.2  Secondary Endpoints  
 After each injection:  
o Leakage   
 After saline delivery equivalent to 30U of U100 insulin (0.3mL) 
and Subject  removal of pen needle from body, Study Staff will 
use the provided materials and scale to absorb leakage from the 
pen needle tip and injection site to measure the amount of 
leakage.  
 Leakage will be considered to be present if measurement is 
equivalent to ≥ 5% of dose ( equivalent to ≥1.5U  of U100 insulin  
- equivalent to ≥0.01 5g) 
o Bending  - patient -end cannula  
Protocol Number: DBC –18PENDL02  
Version 4.0 25FEB201 9 
 
 
BD CONFIDENTIAL    Page 10 of 36 
 Study Staff will use a provided needle  bend scale and visually 
inspect pen needles to determine the presence  of bending .  If 
present, study staff will determine and document degree of bend 
with the provided scale . For the purpose of answering the study 
objective, needle bend will be considered  > 2 on the bend rating 
scale.  
 After each pair of injections : 
o Injection  force  
 Each Subject  will evaluate perceived injection  force after each 
pair of injections using a 5-point Likert scale (from 1st injection 
required much less force to deliver medication to 2nd injection 
required much less force to deliver medication ). 
Which pen needle required less force or effort to deliver the dose ?

3.2.3  Exploratory Endpoints  
 Injection time – includes the following time periods for each injection  
1) Time from when subject 1st pushes injection button to time button fully 
depressed  
2) Time from when injection button fully depressed to when pen needle 
removed from body  
3) Total injection time – the 2 time periods above combined  
 
 After each injection :  
o Breaking  
 Study Staff will record any patient end needle  breakage .  
Breakage is defined a s the patient -end metal cannula separated 
into two pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928] . 
 
 After all injections completed : 
o Survey responses  
 Subject  completes the following 5-point Likert scale survey 
(from Disagree to Agree ).  Subject  will be instructed to respond 
to the questions based on their usual (in -home use) injection 
experience.  Subject responses to survey questions  will be 
tallied .

5.0 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY  PRODUCTS  
Pen needles are a component of pen -based injection systems routinely utilized for parenteral 
administration of medicaments such as insulin. A pen needle consists of a doubled ended cannula 
that is assembled int o an injection -molded plastic hub using adhesive. The hub has threads, which 
allow it to be screwed onto the pen -injector device. This allows the Non-Patient  (NP) end of the 
needle  to penetrate through the rubber septum of the pen cartridge to create the f luid flow path. 
The pen needle device interfaces with the delivery site providing a conduit for delivery into the 
subcutaneous tissue space. Pen needles will be attached and primed per manufacturer’s 
instructions with 0.9% sterile saline.

If a site cannot confirm which pen and pen needle (gauge and length) the subject is currently 
using, the Subject must bring their injection delivery system(s) (pen and pen needle) with them to 
the Site . Subjects will also be asked to wear comfortable clothes to the Site on study day to enable 
easy accessibility to injection site area.  
 
Prior to study  participation, every potential Subject must provide  written informed consent  and will 
be assigned a Subject number . After being presented with an overview of the study procedures, 
each Subject will be given ample time to review the consent form and ask an y questions about 
the procedures.  If the Subject agrees to participate in the study he or she will sign the Informed 
Consent.  
This study requires one subject visit of approximately 60-[ADDRESS_461003] meets the eligibility requirements.

 Study Procedures  
6.2.1   Injections:  
 Subjects will be informed that “these pen needles are to be inserted ‘straight -in” 
(perpendicular)  
 Subjects will be provided with an Insulin Reusable Pen  with saline cartridges in place 
and the pen needles attached, primed, and set to 30U.   (A new  ClikSTAR® Insulin 
Reusable Pen will be used for each subject at specific sites; subjects at remaining 
sites may use a new or cleaned ClikSTAR ® Insulin Reusable Pen ). 
 Each pair will include:  
o 1 pen with the BD Nano™ PRO pen needle  
o 1 pen with one of the comparator  pen needle   
 Using their usual injecti on technique, Subject s will  inject saline with the 
pair of pens into their abdomen  per Study Staff instruction  and 
according to the randomization schedule .  
 If subject inserts at an acute angle or uses a skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_368343], it is 
allowable under this study protocol but should be documented on the 
study source.  
o The location of the injection sites will b e randomized   
o Each injection  will be  at least 1 inch from the previous injection  
 During needle injection , Study Staff will record two times:  
o From initial pressing of injection  button  (dose set knob) , to button fully 
depressed   
o From initial pressing of injection  button to the removal of needle from body   
 
Immediately after each injection the following evaluation will be performed:  
 
 Study Staff will use the provided materials and scale to absorb leakage from the pen  
needle tip and injection site to measure the amount of leakage  (refer to Appendix 18.1  
for leakage measurement procedure) . If any bleeding is observed, this will be noted 
and leakage measurement will  only be collected from the pen needle tip. .   Leakage 
measurements must be blinded to the Subject.  
 Study Staff will visually inspect each needle for the p resence of  bending and/or 
breakage.   If no bending is visually observed, Site Staff will record a score of “0” and 
the pen/needle  will be placed i n the pen needle disposal fixture .   
 
Protocol Number: DBC –18PENDL02  
Version 4.0 25FEB201 9 
 
 
BD CONFIDENTIAL    Page 18 of 36 
 
 
 If bending is visually observed, the pen/pen needle will be placed on the bend scale  
(refer to Appendix 18.2).  The degree of bending will be assessed and scoring 
recorded by  [CONTACT_127009].  Post scoring, the pen/need le will be placed in the pen needle 
disposal fixture  and the pen needle will be removed and properly disposed of.  
 The Subject  will then inject the subsequent pen/pen needles  into the site according to 
randomization schedule  for a total of six pairs (total of t welve  injections)  
 
After each pair of injections : 
 Subjects will complete a  15 cm relative VAS for injection pain and Likert -scale 
assessment for perceived  injection force  
 
After all injections completed injections:  
 Additional survey questions to be completed  
  
Study staff will follow the same pro cedures for each pen/pen needle set  as noted above . 
 End of Visit and Study Completion  
 The s ubjects will be discharged from the Site following completion of the study procedures, 
when their in jection sites show no evidence of bleeding, and when they are comfortable 
leaving the site.  
 Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_368344].  

Protocol Number: DBC –18PENDL02  
Version 4.0 25FEB201 9 
 
 
BD CONFIDENTIAL    Page 19 of 36 
 All adverse events occurring with S ubjects during the study will be recorded and followed 
until resolution as appropriate.  
7.0 INTERRUPTION OR DISC ONTINUATION OF PARTI CIPATION /TESTING   
 Discontinuation of Study Subject s 
Subject s may request withdrawal from the  study at any time or may be withdrawn at the discretion 
of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_225428]:  
 Adverse Event/Concurrent Illness  
 Noncompliance with study requirements or restrictions  
 Failure to meet ongoing inclusion criteria, or d evelopment of an excluding condition  
 Protocol deviation  
 Withdrawal of consent  
 Subject  is lost to follow up  
 Administrative issues  
 Any other reason which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_17439], makes the Subject ’s participation in the 
study not in his or her best inte rest. 
 Discontinuation Visits and Follow -up Procedures  
For Subject s discontinued due to adverse events, the clinical course of the event will be followed 
according to accepted standards of medical practice until the event resolves, stabilizes, or in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], is no longer considered clinically significant.  
 Replacement of Discontinued Subject s/Specimens  
Recruitment of [ADDRESS_461006] s/Specimens  
No data will be collected from Subject s/specimens after the point of discontinuation except as 
needed to follow ongoing adverse events.  All study data collected from the Subject  up to the 
point of discontinuation will be recorded on the Case Re port Form, entered into the study 
database, and included in subsequent analyses, as appropriate.  
8.0 RISK / BENEF IT ASSESSMENT   
 Potential Risks  
The risks to the Subject  are non -significant and the findings may reveal information that may 
improve medical care f or persons with diabetes. The potential benefit to medical practice 
outweighs the non -significant differential risk experienced by [CONTACT_368355]. As a result of inserting a pen needle, Subject s may experience pain, 
bleeding, or local infection. However, given the size of the  investigational  pen needles (4mm x 
32G or smaller ) and the procedures being used in disinfecting the skin and pen devices prior to 
inserting the pen needle , these risks are negligible.  
Protocol Number: DBC –18PENDL02  
Version 4.0 25FEB201 9 
 
 
BD CONFIDENTIAL    Page 20 of 36 
Risks associated with a pen needle injection may include:  
• Discomfort or pain  
• Fainting  
• Bleeding  
• Bruising  
• Redness  
• Infection  
 Potential Benefits  
There are no direct benefits to the Subject  for participation in this study.  The findings may reveal 
information that will allow for a better understanding of pen needle s, and thus may improve 
medical care fo r persons with diabetes . 
9.0 SAFETY  
 Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE):  Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom or disease in a Subject  that is temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product or procedures , even if the event is not considered to be related to the  study 
product or procedures.  
This includes events not seen at baseline and events that have worsened if present at baseline.  
The term AE will refer to all adverse events (serious and non -serious) occurring during 
participation in a study of either inves tigational devices and/or drugs.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  An SAE is any AE occurring during study participation that 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 Life Threatening (refers to any event in which the Subject  was at risk of death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if 
it were more severe)  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 Persistent or significant disability or incapacitation (re fers to any event which results in a 
substantial and/or permanent disruption of the Subject ’s ability to carry out normal life 
functions)  
 Required intervention to prevent permanent impairment/damage  
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Important medical event t hat may require intervention to prevent one of the preceding 
conditions.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE):  Any serious adverse effect on health or safety 
or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a dev ice that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare 
Protocol Number: DBC –18PENDL02  
Version 4.[ADDRESS_461007] s (21CFR -812.3(s) ). Refer to Protocol Section 8.1 (Potential Risks) for a list of 
anticipated  adverse events, signs or symptoms.  
 Adverse Event (AE) Management  
Each  Subject s will be questioned in an open -ended manner throughout the conduct of the study 
as appropriate for any new or worsening undesirable signs or symptoms they may have 
experience since being exposed to the study product. Elicited signs and symptoms must be 
comprehensively documented on the appropriate source documentation.  
Each  sign, symptom, disease or illness reported must be evaluated by [CONTACT_368356].  
The clinical course of the event will be followed according to accepted standards of medical 
practice until the event resolves, stabilizes, or in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], is no longer 
cons idered clinically significant.  The Investigator must supply the Sponsor with information 
concerning the follow up and/or resolution of the AE.   
Some reported or observed signs and symptoms are inherent to subcutaneous  injection and are 
likely to occur transiently for nearly all Subject s in this study.   Such signs or symptoms will not be 
considered AEs as long as they are mild (transient , easily tolerated, no interference with daily 
activities ) and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_49202].  The following will not be not be considered AEs:  
 Mild, self -limited pain, swelling at the injection site  and presence of wheals  
 Mild bruising at the injection site  
 Mild self -limited bleeding at the injection site  
 
However, these signs and symptoms must be considered AEs and documented on the Adverse 
Event CRF   should any of them occur in such a way that the extent or nature of the experience 
exceeds that normally associated with the procedure, as judged by [CONTACT_368357], bruising or bleeding.  
All needle breaking  that results in a cannula remaining in the body either partially or fully,  must 
be considered an AE and documented on the Adverse Event CRF.  
 
 Assessment of Adverse Events (AEs)  
All AEs must be assessed for Seriousness, Severity, and Relationship. All AEs, regardless of 
classification, must be comprehensively documented in the CRF and on the SAE form, if 
applicable, and reported to BD.  This includes AEs related to marketed study product s. The 
following information about the event is to be reported on the AE CRF:  
 Seriousness, classified as: Non -Serious or Serious  
 Severity,  classified as:  
o Mild: Transient symptoms, easily tolerated, no interference with daily activities  
o Moderate: Marked sy mptoms, moderate interference with daily activities, tolerable  
o Severe : Considerable interference with daily activities, intolerable  
 Relationship  to the study product or study procedures:  
o Not Related:  Evidence suggests absolutely no possible causal relationship 
between the event and the investigational study device (or procedures).  
Protocol Number: DBC –18PENDL02  
Version 4.0 25FEB201 9 
 
 
BD CONFIDENTIAL    Page 22 of 36 
o Unlikely Related:  Evidence suggests that other possible causes or contributing 
etiological factors may have caused the event other than the investigational study 
device (o r procedures).  
o Possibly Related:  Evidence suggests a causal relationship between the event and 
the investigational study device (or procedures) cannot be ruled out  
o Related:  Evidence suggests a reasonable causal relationship between the event 
and the device  (or procedures) is likely  
In addition, the following should be recorded for each AE:  
 Action(s) taken to remedy the AE, including change in study treatment or participation, or 
medical/surgical treatments  
 Duration of the AE from onset through resolution, a s applicable  
 Cause (including suspected product/procedure and/or other cause)  
 Outcome of the event, including resolution and sequelae, as applicable  
 Additional Procedures for Assessing & Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
SAE criteria are specified in Section 9.1.  All SAEs must also be assessed by [CONTACT_368358]. An adverse 
event will be considered unexpected or unanticipated if the nature, severity or frequency of the 
event is not consistent with the risk information previously described in the protocol, Info rmed 
Consent, or Investigator’s Brochure (if applicable).  
Any adverse event meeting the criteria for ‘Serious’, regardless of the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_225430], must be reported to BD within [ADDRESS_461008] also submit a completed 
SAE form to the BD Trial Safety Dept. via fax or email listed below within 24 hours  of receipt of 
the information.

 Case Report Forms (CRF)  
The case report forms (CRF) will be provided by [CONTACT_1034].  The term “CRF” as used in this 
protocol may refer to traditional paper CRFs,  or electronic case report forms for electronic data 
capture (EDC), as determined by [CONTACT_1034].   
The Investigator may delegate CRF completion to study personnel.  However, the Sponsor must 
be apprised in writing of the name [CONTACT_368368].  The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_368346], an electronic signature.  An individual record will be kept for each 
Subject  that provided infor med consent.  
All entries to a paper CRF should  be made clearly in black or dark blue indelible ballpoint pen to 
ensure the legibility of self -copying or photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_225435]. Corrections are made by [CONTACT_1299] a 
single horizontal line through the incorrect entry , so that the original entry can still be seen, and 
placing the revised entry beside it. The revised entry must be initialed and dated by a member of 
the Investigator's research team authorized to make CRF entries. Correction fluid must not be 
used.  
CRF entries will be compared to source documents by [CONTACT_225451]. 
Unless specified otherwise, all information on the CRFs must be traceable to original source 
documents.   
12.2.1  CRF as Source Document  
In this study, the following  CRFs may serve as original source documents:     
 Visual Analog Scale for pain  
 5-Point Likert for thumb force  
 Demographics/Diabetes History  
 Subject  Questionnaire (s) 
12.2.2  CRF/Data  Transmittal

13.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
Statistical met hods will be detailed in a Statistical Analysis Plan. Any deviations from the original 
statistical plan will be justified and described in an amended statistical analysis plan and/or the 
protocol, or  in the final statistical report and clinical study repor t. 
 Sample Size Determination  
 
Pain:  Assuming  the SD for relative VAS is ~ 50mm (based on DBC -17NUCLS07 ), a sample size 
of 266 pairs  per each comparator has >90% power of passing a -10mm NI criteria, assuming no 
true difference in  pain  (based on a 2-sided 95% CI for the mean).  
Leakage: Based on previous study data (BDT -2P00116) where leakage ≥1.5U was observed in 
66/298 ( 22.1%) of injections performed with Artsana 34 G, in 25/299 (8.4%) of injections 
performed with Comfort EZ 33G , in 19/296 (6.4%) of injections performed with Artsana  33G  and 
in 3/297 (1%) of injections performed with BD Nano ™ PRO , a simulation was performed (code 
found in SVN repository under DBC -18PENDL01 \Stat\Sample Size \ Bayesian prior proportion R ) 
indicating that 798 injections with BD Nano ™ PRO and 266 injections per each comparator  would 
provide >90% power to show BD Nano ™ PRO superiority to each comparator .   
A 10% buffer was added (to compensate for subject attrition or unusable data), leading to a 
planned enrollment number of  146 subjects.

 Data Evaluability  
All data collected will be analyzed  and review ed for possible exclusion based on protocol 
deviations.

BD CONFIDENTIAL    Page 27 of 36 
Analyses of relative data will only include pairs where both injections were completed.  
 
 Statistical Methods  
Descriptive statistics (number of observations, mean, and standard  deviation, minimum  and 
maximum) will be calculated and presented for all quantitative responses. Frequency tables with 
number of observations, percentage of total and 95% confidence interval (score method) for the 
percentage (as applicable) will be created for discrete responses.  
Analysis for relative VAS pain:  For each comparator PN, a two-sided 95% confidence interval  
will be calculated for the average rating.  A modeling approach may be used to adjust for the pair 
order effect, BD order effect  within pair  (due to  the often -obse rved b ias towards favoring the last 
pen needle  used  in a pair ), abdomen site effect and random subject effect .  Results will be tested 
for non -inferiority, followed by [CONTACT_225452] :   
If the lower bound of the CI is > -10mm, we can conclude in non-inferiority  
If the lower bound of the CI is > 0mm, we can conclude in superiority  
 
Analysis for thumb force via 5-point Likert  scale : For each comparator PN, the responses will be 
converted to ratings of -2 – 2 (where positive ratings favor BD) and a two-sided 95% confidence 
interval  will be calculated for the average rating .   A modeling approach may be used to adjust for 
the pair order effect, BD order effect  within pair,  abdomen site effect and random subject effect .  
Results will be tested for supe riority:   
If the lower bound of the CI is > 0, we can conclude in superiority    
 
Responses will also be converted to 3 categories: favoring comparator  (negative ratings), no 
difference (0 ratings) and favoring BD  Nano™ PRO  (positive ratings) and the diffe rence in 
percentage of responses with a preference for BD vs each comparator  needle calculated , 
adjusting for the “no preference” category .  
 
Analysis for needle  bending and leaking :  analysis will be performed using a binary logistic 
regression with random subject effect and fixed pen needle effect , pair order effect, PN order 
effect within pair  and abdomen site effect. The average difference in percentage of occurrence 
with BD PN and each comparator  PN will be calculated with 95% confidence interval and 
assessed for statistical significance.  The upper bound of the confidence interval will be compared 
to 0:  superiority  will be concluded given that the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for 
the difference in proportions is < 0%. 
 
Analysis for time to deliver  and dwell time :  A mixed effect model will be used (fixed effects of pen 
needle type, abdomen site, order of pair, order of pen needle within pair and random Subject  
effect) to estimate average difference (BD PN – each Comparator  PN) in time to deliver  and dwell 
time.  The upper bound of the confidence interval will be compared to 0:  superiority  will be 
concluded given that the upper bound of the 95% interval for the average difference is < 0 
seconds . 
 
Other e xploratory endpoints will be  summarized.

The Sponsor will maintain records that document the shipment, receipt, disposition, return and /or 
destruction of study products.  
 Monitoring  
BD, the study sponsor, will designate trained and qualified personnel to monitor the progress of 
this clinical study in accordance with BD Monitoring SOPs and the study -specific Monitoring Plan.  
A pre -study S ite qualification visit will be conducted  to asses s the adequacy of the S ite facilities 
and staff with respect to study requirements.  
Prior to study start, a study initiation visit will be conducted to provide training to site staff with 
regard to the protocol, the completion of study documentation and C ase Report Forms (CRFs), 
the monitoring schedule, and all regulatory requirements. During the study, routine monitoring 
visits w ill be conducted to assure the S ite continues to adhere to the protocol, the investigator 
Protocol Number: DBC –18PENDL02  
Version 4.[ADDRESS_461015] s’ protection and safety, when relevant, as well as the quality, completeness, 
and integrity of the data. The Study Monitor will assist the investigative Site with query resolution 
and will perform Site close -out activities once all queries have been resolved.  
Additional visits may  be carried out depending upon S ite activity and performance. The 
Investigator must agree to the inspection of all study related records and give direct ac cess to 
source documents for verification of data on CRFs.  
The Investigator is res ponsible for ensuring that any S ite-owned equipment required for use in 
the study is properly installed and maintained (e.g., inspected, calibrated, alarmed). 
Documentation of equipment maintenance procedures must be available for review by [CONTACT_179648].   
 Audits and Inspections  
If the st udy is selected for audit by [CONTACT_368364], then the Investigator and his team will make themselves available during the 
visit.  The Investigator must agree to the inspection of all study rel ated records and give the 
auditor/inspector direct access to source documents for verification of data on CRFs.  The 
Subject ’s anonymity must be safeguarded and data checked during the audit remain confidential.  
As soon as the Investigator is aware of an u pcoming inspection/audit by [CONTACT_217928], 
he/she will promptly inform BD.  As agreed with the Investigator, BD personnel may be present 
at the Site during the inspection.   
 Protocol Deviations  
Protocol deviations are not permitted and should be im plemented prospectively as a protocol 
amendment whenever practical or appropriate, unless required to protect the safety and well -
being of the Subject .  The Investigator must notify the Sponsor immediately of any such deviation 
resulting from the need to p rotect a Subject .   
Protocol deviations (other than those required to protect the safety and well -being of a Subject ) 
may impact the evaluability of study data, and may place Subject s at risk.   If the Investigator or 
their staff inadvertently deviates fro m the study plan, the Investigator should implement 
appropriate corrective and preventive procedures, and should notify the Sponsor at their earliest 
convenience.  Significant deviations may also need to be reported to the IRB/ EC and local health 
authority .   
The Study Monitor will evaluate records of study conduct at the Site to identify any deviations, 
and will also report them to the Sponsor.  Upon evaluation by [CONTACT_1034], actions may be 
required to prevent additional deviations, such as retraining of the Site, implementation of 
additional Site procedures, and more frequent monitoring.  If these steps fail, more serious 
measures, up to and including termination of the Site and withdrawal of study product may be 
necessary.   
15.0 ETHICA L AND  REGULATORY S TANDARDS   
 IRB/EC  
An appropriate IRB/ EC must review this protocol, the Informed Consent Form  (if applicable) , and 
any other supporting study documents which affect Subject  or study personnel safety, prior to 
Protocol Number: DBC –18PENDL02  
Version 4.0 25FEB201 9

study initiation at an investigational Site. No investigational Site may begin the study until the 
IRB/EC has given its written approval, signed by [CONTACT_1201]/ EC chairperson or authorized personnel, 
and a copy of the approval letter and the approved Informed Consent Form (if applicable) has 
been provided t o the Sponsor.  
 Informed Consent  
Prior to giving informed consent, each candidate will have the opportunity to review the study 
procedures, risks and benefits and ask any questions he or she may have regarding the study. 
Before enrollment , each Subject  must give informed consent, documented by [CONTACT_2960] a written 
form, created and approved in compliance with [ADDRESS_461016] party without the express written consent of the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Site.  
The Study Monitor or other authorized representatives of BD may inspect all documents and 
records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_737].  The Site will permit access to such records.   
BD and the Site may be required to provide regulatory agencies access to clinical study  data and 
records, as well as source documents.  
All other agreements as to confidentiality by [CONTACT_225447], the Pr incipal Investigator, and the Site may be 
found in the Confidential Disclosure Agreement and the Clinical Trial Agreement.  
 Protocol Modifications   
Amendments to the protocol will not be implemented without agreement from the Sponsor and 
prior submission to  and written approval from the governing IRB/ EC, except when necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to the Subject . Notice of an emergency modification shall be given 
to the Sponsor and the reviewing IRB /EC as soon as possible, but in no event later th an five 
working days after the emergency occurred. Protocol amendments may affect Informed Consent 
Forms for current and future Subject s. 
Minor changes to the protocol, such as correction of typographical errors or changes in personnel 
names (other than th e PI) or contact [CONTACT_117856]. 
Administrative changes will be submitted to the governing IRB/ EC but implementation of the 
administrative change may proceed without prior IRB/EC approval, unles s so required by [CONTACT_5040]/EC or S ite SOPs .

 Study Discontinuation  
BD reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely dis continue the study at a single S ite 
or at all Sites at any time and for any reason.  If such action is taken, BD will discuss the reasons 
with all In vestigators (the Investigator).  If the study is terminated or suspended due to safety 
reasons, the Sponsor  will inform the health authorities as required, and provide the reason(s) for 
the action.  Investigator(s) must inform their IRB/ EC promptly and pro vide the reason(s) for the 
suspension or termination.  
 Clinical Study  Registration   
In compliance with Title VIII of Public Law [ADDRESS_461017] of 2007 
(FDAAA), BD will register all applicable studies and disclose study results in a publicly accessible 
database, e.g. the Clinical Trials .gov web site.  Applicable studies will be registered no later than 
[ADDRESS_461018]  visit for collection of primary outcome data, or after 
health authority approval for previously unapproved devices.  BD has responsibility for 
determining whether this study qualifies as an “applicable” study  under the law, and if so, will take 
responsibility for registration and disclosure as required by [CONTACT_2371].  
 Publication of Results   
BD believes that results of applicable clinical studies  of our products should be published in peer -
reviewed literature in a timely, accurate, complete and balanced mann er, regardless of study  
outcomes. BD is committed to making information public whenever it relates to the safety and 
efficacy of its marketed products.  
Any formal presentation or publication of data collected from this study will be considered as a 
joint p ublication by [CONTACT_093](s) and the appropriate personnel of BD. Authorship will be 
based on generally accepted criteria of the ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal 
Editors) and determined by [CONTACT_11402]. For multi -center studies, t he first publication will 
be based on data from all centers, analyzed as stipulated in the protocol by [CONTACT_225453], and 
not based on data from  a single Site or a subset of Sites. Investigators participating in multi -center 
studies agree not to present  data gathered from one center or a small group of centers before the 
full, initial publication, unless formally agreed to by [CONTACT_225454] (the sole 
exception being an unanticipated adverse event that is product -related and which might ha ve 
clinically significant safety implications for a marketed product or a class of products).  
BD must receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_368347]. In a timely manner, BD will review th e communications for accuracy 
(thus avoiding potential discrepancies with submissions to health authorities), verify that 
confidential information is not being inadvertently divulged and to provide any relevant 
supplementary information to the investigator s. 
 Record Retention  
If the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_368348], custody must be transferred to a person or entity who will accept the responsibility.  
BD must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_1640].  
Federal regulations require that a copy of all essential study documents (e.g., IRB/ EC approvals, 
signed informed consent forms, source documents, CRF copi[INVESTIGATOR_014], safety reports, test article 
dispensing records, etc.) , must be retained in the files of the responsible Investigator for a

The purpose of this amendment is to allow the collection of progression biopsies from 
subjects who are withdrawn from the LCCC 1128 study for a variety of reasons 
including, but not limited to, a lack of tolerability, need  to receive other therapy or 
completio n of 3- years o f study treatment without progression. The subset of the 
aforementioned subjects who are later re-challenged with dab rafenib and trametinib  
combination therapy and then progress while on this treatment, may be biopsied at the time of their clinical or radiological progression. These subjects are required to consent to this biopsy collection  prior to being placed back on the LCCC 1128 clinical trial. 
Previously in protocol amendment #3, subjects who were withdrawn from study treatment due to an  inability to tolerate the combination regimen, but who continued on 
BRAF inhibitor targeted therapy, were able to be consented, at the time of progression from single agent therapy, to undergo the a progression biopsy. As the protocol’s objectives focus on combination therapy, the protocol is also currently being amended to remove this scenario. No subjects were biopsied who progressed solely on single agent therapy  and thus this amendment will not affect previously collected data. 
 The following modifications were made to this protocol for amendment #5:  
Editorial, Administrative Changes: 
• Minor spelling grammar and formatting changes throughout the protocol 
• Removal of Co-Investigators from the Face Page of the protocol 
• Addition of the IND # to the Face Page of the Protocol  
• IRB Reporting Requirements were updated in accordance with the UNC IRB 
SOPs  (Section 7.3.3) 
• FDA Expedited Reporting language was updated to better capture FDA guidance provided in 21CFR312.32 (IND Safety Reporting) (Section 7.3.3) 
• Required documentation (Section 9.2) was updated to include financial disclosures 
• Single Patient/Subject Exceptions (Section 9.5.2) was updated in accordance with Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Single Subject Exceptions Policy.  
 
Scientific Changes:  
• Updated the study synopsis, study schema, biopsy section, Time and Events Table 
and correlative study procedures  to indicate that former LCCC [ADDRESS_1150585] of care dabrafenib/trametinib off study are eligible for a progression biopsy (Section 1.1, 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 6.1 and 6.7) 
• The biopsy, duration of follow-up, Time and Events Table and follow-up assessments sections of the protocol were updated to indicate that subjects wo are placed back on study for the purposes of a progression biopsy will remain on study for safety monitoring, in relation to the biopsy procedure, for [ADDRESS_1150586] an ongoing ≥grade 2 or serious AE (SAE) related to the study procedure at 30 days will continue to be followed until the event is resolved or deemed irreversible by [CONTACT_093] (Section 4.2 , 4.7, 6.1 and 6.5).  
• The assessment of primary endpoint and efficacy section  (Section 6.9) was 
updated to clarify that analysis of progression biopsies from subjects placed back on stud y after progressing on standard of care dabrafenib/trametinib will be 
included in the analysis of the primary and correl ative secondary objectives . 
• The section on sample size and data analysis plans was updated to clarify that tumor samples from patients w ho progress on study and those who are removed 
from study and later progress on the combination treatment will be analyzed as one data set (Section 8.1).    
Eligibility Criteria:  
• Addition of inclusion criteria for off-study subjects who may be consented to come back on study for the purposes of a progression biopsy when they progress on standard of care dabrafenib and trametinib treatment (Section 3.3).  
o Subjects must have currently progressed while receiving trametinb and dabrafenib combination therapy. 
o Subjects must be willing to undergo a research biopsy 
o Subjects must have a tumor amenable to research biopsy 
o Subjects must provide informed consent 
o Subject must have been previously enrolled on the LCCC 1128 protocol.

The following modifications were made to this protocol for amendment #4: 
 1) This amendment adds a requirement for annual ophthalmic exams while on treatment (see section 6.3.4 and time and events table) 
2) Clarification of the duration follow-up period (see section 4.7 and 6.6). Regardless, of the reason that a patient comes off treatment, dermatologic exams will continue every 
[ADDRESS_1150587] 6 months following discontinuation from dabrafenib, and may be done by a physician local to the patient . Only after these dermatologic exams are 
complete is the patient considered off follow-up, even if they do not require survival follow-up for this entire 6 month period. 
3) This protocol amendment also clarifies that whether or not a subject enrolls in LCCC 1108, they will be asked to provide a single blood sample (approximately 8 mL) for research purposes. This blood sample may be collected at any point in the study, including during follow-up. 
4) Section 7.3.3 has been updated with the new language in regards to [COMPANY_001] reporting re quirements. 
5) Robert G. Dixon, MD, Hyeon Yu, MD, and Kathleen Gordon, MD have been added as co -investigators to the protocol title page

The following modifications were made to  this protocol for amendment #3: 
Eligibility criteria were modified to refine the definition of hypertension in exclusion 
criterion  3.2.6   
1) At progression biopsy wording was changed to allow for attainment of biopsies in subjects withdrawn from study treatment due to lack of tolerability of the combination regimen and continued on BRAF inhibitor targeted therapy.   These 
subjects should be re-consented so that progression biopsy can be obtained at the time of relapse on BRAF inhibitor targeted therapy (i.e., dabrafenib  or vemurafenib). 
(Sections 4.2 and 6.7 and footnote #11 to Time and Events Table in section 6.1) 
2) The frequency of tumor assessment scans was reduced to every 12 weeks for subjects 
responding to combination therapy after cycle 9 
      AND  
 The frequency of tumor assessment scans was reduced to every 6 months for subjects 
responding to combination therapy for > 2 years (Section 6.3.2 and footnote b added to Time and Events Table in Section 6.1) 
3) The frequency of ophthalmic exams was reduced a nd are now only required at 
Screening and as clinically -indicated due to the presence of ocular symptoms (Section 
6.3.2 and Time and Events Table in Section 6.1) 
4) Sponsor changed from GlaxoSmithKline to [COMPANY_001] 
5) Blood Sample :  
 For those patients who do not co -enroll into LCCC1108, we will ask for a blood sample 
(~8mLs) to ensure sufficient germline DNA in the event tissue samples are insufficient or 
request blood samples collected under LCCC9001 with IRB # 90-0573. This change is 
reflected in section 1.6, section 6.1 footnote #13, and 6.7 
6) In anticipation of the pending switch from investigative product to commercial supply by [CONTACT_829194]: Trametinib/Dabrafenib commercially available 
product with auxiliary labeling will be provided by [CONTACT_5343].  The study drug should be 
administered and stored as per the instructions specified on the label (refer to the label, the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_829142]). In addition, MSDS will now be available upon 
request from [COMPANY_001] and not [COMPANY_004] (See sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.2.1, and 5.2.2

The main driver for this amendment was to increase the window of time for screening for all but 
the laboratory evaluations  and baseline tumor biopsy from 1 week to 3 weeks, to 
expand/reorganize the T&E table so that we each study visit for the first 6 months is included in 
the table, to clarify the timing of the biopsies at progression, and to include specific information for affiliate sites as the study is changing to multicenter.   These changes are reflected in sections 
4.2, 6.0 (Time and Events table), and sections 6.2-6.7.  
In addition, the 2 medications included in the study were FDA approved as of May 2013, and this 
information has been incorporated into the study.  These changes are reflected in sections 1.1, 1.3, 
and 1.4.   
Safety and drug interaction i nformation : Since this trial was initially approved in 2012, new 
IBs for each individual agent were issued by [CONTACT_3455].  In addition, a new IB for the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib was issued in May of 2013.  Updated safety 
information ( including drug interaction information) from each of these documents was 
incorporated into the protocol. These changes are reflected in sections 1.4.1, 1.5, [IP_ADDRESS]., 4.4.3, 
4.4.4, 4.4.7, 4.5.2, 5.1.5, 5.2.5, 5.2.7, and 5.2.8, and Appendix C section 11.3.  
 
Eligibility  
Section 3.1.7 was revised to indicate that the pre-treatment biopsy required by [CONTACT_829196]. 
 
Section 3.1.8: females of child-bearing potential must continue effective contraception until 16 
(not 4 weeks) post the last dose of study medication.  Men with a female partner of childbearing 
potential must agree to effective contraception from D1 of study treatment (not 14 days prior to D1 as written previously). 
 
Biopsies:  
Section 4.2, Time and Events footnote 11, and sections 6.4, 6.7.: These sections were revised to 
indicate that tissue at baseline does not have to be from the original diagnostic specimen, but from any site.  If tissue is not available, a core biopsy can be obtained from any site, not restricted 
to target lesions.  Repeat biopsies were already required at progression. However, the timing was clarified with amendment #1 to indicate they should be performed within 7 business days of 
documented progression, a nd optimally within 4 hours of that day’s study medication.  Post-
treatment biopsies will be not required for patients removed from the study for reasons other than 
LINEBERGER COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER                                                            LCCC [ADDRESS_1150593] progression biopsy is performed. 
 
Section 6.9.3 Evaluation of Target lesions: 
A note was added to this section NOTE:  Whenever possible, a biopsied lesion should not be 
considered a target lesion  for RECIST tumor assessments.  If the biopsied lesion is the only site 
of measurable disease, it may only be followed as a target lesion if a core biopsy was 
performed.  Lesions that have been completely removed or subjected to excisional biopsy should 
not be followed as target lesions.   
 
Time and Events:  
In addition to the logistical changes and details on biopsies noted above, the footnotes were revise 
to specify that the end of treatment visit should be performed [ADDRESS_1150594]- baseline unless clinically ind icated.   
 In addition, the following editorial changes were made:  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_829143], MD to Carrie Lee MD, MPH.  [CONTACT_829238] remains 
as a co -investigator.   
 Section 4.3: This section was revised to indicate that if a patient misses a dose of dabrafenib, they may make this dose up, provided it is >6 hours until the next dose.  If a patient misses a dose of 
trametinib, they may make this dose up, provided it is >12 hours until the next dose.   
 Sections 4.8 and 4.9 (Removal of Patients, Patient Replacement, and Study Withdrawal) were 
added to reconcile with the newest LCCC protocol template.  
 
Section 6.[ADDRESS_1150595] be available to render a 
patient evaluable for the primary endpoint.  The following statement was added: If a patient drops 
out of the study prior to progression, they may be replaced.

1 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Study Synopsis  
This multicenter phase II study in 20 patients with BRAFV600mutant disease 
(specifically BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K designated as BRAFV600E/K), unresectable 
stage III/IV melanoma is designed to explore the mechanisms by [CONTACT_829197] a B RAF inhibitor (dabrafenib;Tafinlar®) 
and MEK inhibitor (trametinib;Mekinist® ).  Tissue will be collected at baseline  
and at progression. If a subject is removed from the study for one of a variety of 
reasons including, but not limited to, an  inability to tolerate the combination of 
dabrafenib and trametinib, a need to receive other therapy or completion of 3-
years of study treatment without progression, and the subject later receives, as part of his/her standard of care, the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib and progresses on the standard of care regimen, then the subject may be contact[CONTACT_829198] [ADDRESS_1150602] common malignancy in the [LOCATION_002] and its incidence is increasing faster than any other cancer [1, 2].  Patients with 
metastatic melanoma have a median life expectancy of only 8 months.  In the extension cohort from a recent phase I trial of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib , 
81% (2 6 of 32) of patients with BRAF
V600E /K melanoma experienced at least 30% 
tumor shrinkage by [CONTACT_829199] a complete response seen in two patients [ 3].  
However, resistance to PLX4032 emerged after response durations of [ADDRESS_1150603] been described and warrant further investigation.  These mechanisms include new functional mutations in one of five established resistance genes (BRAF, NRAS, MEK1, MAP3K8 or COT, and PTEN).    MEK is a key protein integral to the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. In BRAF mutant melanoma, MEK activation drives disease proliferation.  Therefore, it is hypothesized that the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibition is likely to 
have less downstream resistance than BRAF inhibition alone.   
1.3 Trametinib  
Trametinib is a reversible and highly selective allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/MEK2.  These characteristics, along with its long half -life, small 
peak/trough ratio and limited inter -subject variability in its pharmacokinetic (PK) 
profile, render it an excellent MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor to evaluate in human trials. [4]  Trametinib is approved as monotherapy and in combination with

Amendment [ADDRESS_1150604] of trametinib in subjects with a variety of cancers has been evaluated in a number of studies, and additional studies are ongoing.[ 4]  Trametinib has been 
administered as monotherapy in at least [ADDRESS_1150605].   Preliminary trametinib pharmacokinetics (PK) was determined after single - and 
repeat dose oral administration of trametinib tablets in subjects with solid tumors. 
Trametinib is absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_735861] 1-3 hours after oral administration of trametinib under fasting conditions. Following repeat -dosing the mean area under the curve (AUC0-τ ) and maximum 
concentrations (Cmax) increased in an approximately dose proportional manner. 
Trametinib accumulates with repeat dosing with a mean effective half -life at a 
dose of [ADDRESS_1150606] been conducted to evaluate human cytochrome P450 (CYP)  enzyme -mediated dru g interactions with trametinib. Co -administration of 
trametinib (2mg per day) with the CYP3A 4 inducer dabrafeninb (150mg BID) resulted in no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug interactions (trametinib package insert; January 2014). This protocol prohibits or cautions against the use of medications with the potential for drug interactions with dabrafenib.  See section 4.5 (Concomitant Medications) and section 11.2 (Appendices) for the categories of medications that are prohibited and/or to be used with caution.  
 
Based on the adverse events (AEs) observed in the dose escalation phase of the 
first-time-in-human (FTIH) study MEK111054, the maximum tolerated dose was 
established at 3.0 mg once daily (QD), and the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of tramet inib was identified as 2.[ADDRESS_1150607]- (day 15) treatment tumor biopsies were performed for evaluation of 
pharmacodynamic (PD) markers in patients with metastatic melanoma in the first monotherapy trial of trametinib conducted (MEK111054).   Doses remained stable for the 15 days of treatment and were 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0mg/day.  PD markers evaluated included percent change from baseline of pERK, Ki67, and p27.  Trough levels of trametinib were also obtained at day 15.   PD responses in this 
study were dose- related, with minimal PD effects seen at 0.5mg/day, and  robust 
changes reported at 2.0mg/day. The median change observed at a dose of 2 mg

3 daily was 62% inhibition of pERK, 83% inhibition of Ki67, and a 175% increase 
in p27, confirming inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway.   Correlations were also reported between PD response and trough concentrations of trametinib on day 15.  Monte Carlo simulations predict that 86% of subjects will exceed the target concentration of 10ng/mL at the 2mg/day dose.   Trametinib 2.[ADDRESS_1150608] of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a known prognostic marker in subjects with melanoma, subjects with exposure above the median value had longer progression-free survival (PFS) than those below the median ex posure with hazard ratio (HR) <1. The relationship with exposure was 
more pronounced in the Phase II study compared to the Phase III study which may be related to the lower  exposure observed in subjects enrolled in the Phase II 
study. The higher exposure in the Phase III study may suggest that the drug response is starting to plateau and data are less likely to show /an exposure-response.[ 4]   
 
Safety and Efficacy  
The most common adverse reactions in the trametinib arm (n=211) from the randomized, open- label study of trametinib versus chemotherapy in patients with 
BRAF
 V600E or V600 K mutation –positive melanoma  included the following:  rash 
(57%),  dermatitis acneiform (19%), dry skin (11%), pruritus (10%), paronychia 
(10%),  diarrhea ( 43%), stomatitis (15%), abdominal pain (13%), lymphedema 
(32%), hypertension (15%), and hemorrhage (13 %). 
 See section 5.1 and the trametinib Investigator’s Brochure for additional safety information on trametinib and section 1.5 for safety and efficacy data when trametinib is combined with dabrafenib in BRAF mutant melanoma.  
1.4 Dabrafenib  
Dabrafenib is a potent and selective inhibitor of BRAF kinase, and  inhibits phosphorylation of MEK and ERK in vitro , inhibits cell proliferation, and 
achieved tumor regression in xenograft cancer models that encode BRAF
V600E.[5]  
Dabrafenib is approved as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E mutatio ns, and in 
combination with trametinib  for the treatment of patients with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600 K mutations 
 
Dabrafenib is under development for the treatment of advanced cancer subjects with BRAF mutant tumors, which have been identified at a high frequency in specific cancers including approximately 40 -60% of melanoma, 30 to 50% of 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_368617], 5 to 20% of colorectal cancer, and approximately 30% of ovarian cancer.

Pharmacokinetics  
Two metabolites of dabrafenib were characterized and may contribute to the 
clinical activity of this drug. [COMPANY_004]2285403 (hydroxy- metabolite) 
pharmacokinetics paralleled that of parent while the desmethyl - ([COMPANY_004]2167542) 
metabolites exhibited a longer half -life and accumulated following rep eat dosing. 
Similar to parent concentrations, exposure for all metabolites showed a less than dose proportional increase with repeat dosing.  Results following single dose administration showed a total recovery of radioactivity of 93.8 % of the dose with f ecal excretion being the major route of 
elimination, accounting for 71.1% of the dose.  The current recommendation is to administer dabrafenib under fasting conditions, either one hour before or [ADDRESS_1150611] study showed a decrease in dabrafenib Cmax and AUC(0-
∞) after single 
dose administration. 
 Preliminary results of the effect of repeat dose administration of dabrafenib 150 mg BID on the single dose pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a CYP3A4 probe, showed a decrease in midazolam exposure, indicating that dabrafenib induces CYP3A4 -mediated metabolism (moderate to potent).  It may also induce 
other 
enzymes such as CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, as well as UDP 
glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) and transporters.  Co-administration of dabrafenib 
and drugs that are affected by [CONTACT_829200]. In preliminary studies, dabrafenib 
was a substrate for human P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and murine breas t cancer resistant 
protein 1 (Bcrp1) in vitro . However, these transporters have minimal impact on 
dabrafenib oral bioavailability and elimination, and the risk of a drug- drug 
interaction is minimal. [5] 
 In addition, CYP2C8, CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are involved in the oxidative metabolism of dabrafenib. In vitro , selective inhibitors 
of CYP 2C8 and CYP3A4 reduced the intrinsic clearance of dabrafenib. These results suggested that dabrafenib has the potential of being a victim of drug- drug 
interactions upon co- administration with  strong CYP2C8  and CYP3A4  inhibitors 
and inducers.[ 5]

Pharmacodynamics  
Based on results from the dose escalation part of Study BRF112680 (Part 1) in patients with V600 mutant-positive melanoma, 150mg BID is predicted to provide, on average, adequate inhibition of pERK (80%). [ 5]  
 
Safety as Monotherapy

Most of the safety data (as summarized in the June 2014 Investigator’s Brochure of this combination) are from the randomized phase III double blind placebo controlled trial comparing this combination (n=209) to dabrafenib monotherapy (n=211), and study BRF113220.  Study BRF 113220 is designed to 
investigate the safety, PK and PD of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib in patients with BRAF V600 mutation positive solid tumors.  The study consists of 4 parts: Part A evaluated the effect of repeat doses of trametinib on the PK of single -dose dabrafenib;  Part B was a dose- escalation phase to determine the 
safety, tolerability and range of tolerated doses for the drugs in combination; Part C is a randomized phase II study to determine the clinical activity of the 
combination in patients with BRAF mutation positive melanoma ; and Part D 
evaluated the PK of dabrafenib administered in combination with trametinib. Administration of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of trametin ib or of dabrafenib relative to 
administration of either compound alone. [ 6]

and uveitis) associated with dabrafenib. When all ocular events were considered together (blurred vision, dry eye, visual impairment and RPED ), the incidence 
was 25%.  With the exception of the single case of grade 3 RPED , all ocular 
events were grade 1 or 2. [6] In the MEK115306 study, ocular events occurred in 
11% of patients in each arm, with no cases of RVO reported. Two subjects in the combination therapy arm had grade 3 ocular events (uveitis and iridocyclitis) considered related to study treatment.  
 
Cutaneous s quamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC)  
In vitro  experiments have demonstrated a paradoxical activation of MAP -kinase 
signaling  in kerationcytes and potentially other cells harboring a wild- type BRAF  
kinase but a mutated RAS kinase upon exposure to a BRAF inhibitor. This paradoxical  MAP -kinase pathway activation is potentially associated with a 
higher risk for the development of cu SCC induction. 
 Cases of cuSCC have been reported in patients treated with dabrafenib in 
combination with trametinib. In BRF113220 Part C, cuSCC occurred in 7% of 
subjects combination therapy arm at the dose used in LCCC1128 compared to 
19% of subjects receiving dabrafenib monotherapy. In patients who received the 
combination dose of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib, events occurred later t han with dabrafenib monotherapy with the median time to onset of 22 
weeks. All patients on combination therapy who developed cuSCC continued on dabrafenib treatment without dose modification.   In the phase II I study (MEK115306), the BRAF and MEK inhibitor combination 
was found to significantly reduce the incidence of secondary cuSCC  which 
occurred in  9% of patients receiving dabrafenib monotherapy compared with 2% 
with the combination. The median time to onset of the first occurrence of cuSCC 
was 222 days in the combination arm and 57 days in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm. 
 
Non-cutaneous secondary/recurrent malignancy  
In vitro  experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP -kinase 
signalling  in BRAF wild type cells with RAS mutations which are exposed to 
BRAF inhibitors, which may lead to increased risk of non- cutaneous 
malignancies in patients treated with  dabrafenib. Cases of RAS -driven 
malignancies have been seen with BRAF inhibitors  including dabrafenib, and 
with dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Patients  should be monitored as

Rash  
In Part C  of BRAF113220, 65% of subjects at the doses used in LCCC1128 
experienced at least one event of skin- related toxicity. This incidence of skin -
related events reported with the combination  regimen appears to be lower than  
what has been observed in the t rametinib  monotherapy trials  (~88%). The  most 
frequent skin- related toxicities affecting over  10% of subjects in Part C were rash, 
dermatitis acneiform, erythema, and generalized rash. The incidence and severity of the majority of skin -related toxicities  and especially those most often seen with 
either trametinib   or dabrafenib  therapy appear to b e reduced when both 
compounds are combined.[ 6] In study MEK115306, the percentage of rash was 
similar between treatment arms (34% in the combination (none grade 3) and 30% (~20% grade 3) in the dabrafenib monotherapy arms). Dermatitis acneiform occurred with increased frequency in the combination arm (8%) as compared to 3% in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm.

 Pancreatitis  
Six subjects in BRF113220 had acute pancreatitis or pancreatitis, 3 of which were 
grade 4 and considered related to study treatment. [6] The time to onset to 
pancreatitis occurred at a median of 138 days. One event of pancreatitis was 
reported in each treatment arm of study MEK115306.  
Hemorrhage 
Combination t reatment  resulted in an increased incidence and severity of 
hemorrhagic events: 16% (9/55) of patients treated with the combination compared with 2% (1/53) of patients treated with dabrafenib alone. Intracranial hemorrhage was fatal in two (4%) patients receiving the combination.

1.5.5 Efficacy of Combination 
The dose ranging trial (Part B  of BRF113220) evaluated the safety and efficacy of 
150mg dabrafenib twice daily plus trametinib (at d oses of 2mg QD or 1 mg BID) 
versus dabrafenib150mg BID. A total of 162 patients with advanced melanoma 
and BRAF V600E/K  mutations were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio, with 54 patients 
in each arm who had not previously received BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Primary efficacy outcome was investigator –assessed ORR; median duration of follow-up 
was 14 months.  In the trametinib 2 mg once daily arm, ORR was 76% versus 54% for dabrafenib monotherapy. Thus, the recommended combination dose is 150 mg dabrafenib twice daily plus 2mg trametinib once daily. The median duration of response was 10.5 months for combination therapy versus 5.6 months for patients on single-agent dabrafenib. See the package insert for further information.     In January 2014, the FDA approved the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib for treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. This indication is based upon demonstration of durable response rate.

Tumor samples from patients who co-enroll in LCCC1108 will also be sequenced for approximately 150-[ADDRESS_1150622] accessible disease and are good candidates for re -biopsy at the time of progression.  At the time of consent, patients enrolled

1.6.[ADDRESS_1150623] developed a chemical proteomics approach to define the activity of a significant percentage (60%) of the expressed kinome in cells and tumors.[ 7] The technique involves the use of pan kinase inhibitors 
immobilized on beads to capture a large percentage of expressed kinases in cells and tumors. The activation state of more than 60% of the expressed kinome, defined by [CONTACT_16638]- seq, can be analyzed using mass spectrometry analysis of the 
captured kinases.   This technique has been used to study, and then rationally design a kinase inhibitor combination therapy for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Analysis of a patient TNBC tissue sample showed activated RAF -MEK1/2 -ERK1/2 
signaling, supporting MEK as a target in TNBC. In TNBC cells and tumors of a genetically engineered C3Tag mouse model (GEMM) of TNBC, MEK inhibition with the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 led to rapid reprogramming of the expression and activity of a group of Tyr and Ser/Thr kinases.  This reprogramming by[CONTACT_829201] -ERK inhibition and demonstrated the resilient nature of the 
kinome.  Mechanistically, we showed that acute MEK in hibitor treatment caused 
MEK -ERK activity loss resulting in rapid c -Myc degradation, inducing the 
expression of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and ERK reactivation.  RNAi knockdown of c-Myc induced RTK expression similarly to MEK

combination therapy of MEK inhibitor and sorafenib for TNBC. The combination 
synergistically caused apoptosis and tumor regression in the C3Tag GEMM of basal -like/claudin -low TNBC, wherea s the single agents of MEK inhibitor or 
sorafenib were largely ineffective.  [7] 
 The research described above, along with siRNA screens of the kinome in cell lines, is identifying previously untargeted kinases essential for tumor growth and survival.  Our belief is that the approach can be extended to human tumors.

optimization.   At UNC in the Clinical Sequencing Program (UNC seq
TM), we are 
applying this technology to patients suffering from a diverse variety of malignancies with funds provided by [CONTACT_829202].   UNC seq allows us to tailor therapy to a patient’s cancer 
based on the tumor’s molecular genetics, thereby [CONTACT_829203] a gents.  
 We have an extensive unpublished experience in melanoma.   For example, we 
have performed UNCs eq on 52 melanoma samples with a capture approach 
restricted to 75 genes previously reported to harbor somatic mutations in this disease. These samples were run through a UNC-developed sample preparation and informatic pi[INVESTIGATOR_829146].  This process was informed by [CONTACT_11604]’s efforts in the far-larger tumor sequencing program, the Cancer Genome Atlas, of which UNC is one of [ADDRESS_1150625] Sanger sequencing.   For 
example, we identified all validated BRAF V600 and NRAS Q61 codon mutations found by [CONTACT_174960]: (BRAF 46% of tumors; NRAS 17%).   Deep sequencing also allowed identification of pathogenic mutations in 
many additional genes reported to be mutated in melanoma (KIT, CDKn2a, PTEN, LKB1); and identified novel functional mutations of BRAF and other kinases. In one BRAF/NRAS wild- type melanoma, we found a clear codon 12 
activating KRAS mutation (Fig 1), which is reported to be present in ~1% of melanoma.   KRAS mutation is not routinely assayed in melanoma at any major 
center, but would have clear implications for the testing of BRAF and MEK inhibitors.   Additionally, we found numerous frameshift (Fig 2), missense, nonsense and large deletion mutations in tumor suppressor genes (PTEN, CDKN2A, p53, LKB1). These mutations, found in many regions along the coding sequence,

used normalized read counts to identify somatic Copy Number Variations (CNVs = deletions and amplifications) and potentially structural variation like chromosomal translocations without any modifications to the sample preparation pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189].  Data comparing X chromosome dosage in normal male and female tissues indicates that our approach can detect single copy loss with high statistical precision, suggesting most pathogenic CNVs will be obvious by [CONTACT_162383].  UNC seq offers a powerful new tool to assay known genetic factors for therapy 
and also to discover novel clinically relevant somatic mutations. The technique can effectively assay the diverse mutations that disable tumor suppressor genes, allowing an expl oration of the clinical consequences of these genetic events 
which to date have been poorly characterized in other contexts. We expect this system will become indispensable to all stages of clinical care, including diagnosis, prognosis, treatment prediction, and drug discovery.

1.7 Rationale 
BRF113220, the phase I/II trial of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib  in combination 
with the MEK inhibitor trametinib  in metastatic melanoma establish ed the safety 
of this combination, and identified the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) for 
each agent.  Expansion cohorts at the RP2D for these drugs in combination were 
included in the phase I to characterize the safety in  more detail, and to explore the 
efficacy of this combination.  The combination was well tolerated as described in section 1.5, with decreased frequency of rash compared to either agent alone. [5, 
8]   This study will utilize the RP2D determined in the Phase I/II study: trametinib  
2mg QD and dabrafenib  150 mg BID.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a very promising overall response 
rate of 81%, these patients will also likely go on to develop resistance as a result of new resistance mutations , and given the cooperative signaling network of 
kinases that sense inhibition of key nodal kinases and induce compensatory responses that offset pharmacological intervention.    The present phase II study in 20 patients with BRAF
V600E /K mutant, unresectable 
stage III/IV melanoma is designed to explore the mechanis ms by [CONTACT_829204].  Overall 
response rate and duration to this combination will also be assessed.    Tissue will be collected at baseline and at progression  (clinical or radiological)  or 
beyond progression  pending the availability of sufficient tissue and considerations 
of patient safety .  Patients may remain on treatment after progression (at the 
discretion of the investigator) as long as they are still experiencing clinical benefit , as targeted therapy post-progression may extend survival. A recent

Epi[INVESTIGATOR_829150].  Guidelines for management of HFSR, and dose modifications for study treatment for HFSR potentially related to study treatment are listed in  the table below.  
Management can differ from the guidelines below based on the clinical judgment of the investigator.  The investigator should contact [CONTACT_28778]  [INVESTIGATOR_829151].   Dermatologic exams should be performed by [CONTACT_829207], or may be referred to a dermatologist, at the discretion of the investigator.  If possible, the same physician should perform each exam for the duration of the study (i.e. if the subject is referred to a dermatologist for the screening exam, the dermatolo gist should do all follow up 
dermatologic assessments) to ensure consistency between evaluations.  
A full -body skin examination and a removal of pre- existing calluses and keratotic 
skin is recommended prior to initiation of study treatment.    
Life-style ch anges  recommended for any grade of HFSR include the following:  
• Reduce exposure of hands and feet to hot water,  
• Avoid traumatic activity including vigorous exercise especially in the first 4 weeks after start of study treatment  
• Avoid constrictive footwear  
• Avoid excessive friction on the skin, when a pplying topi[INVESTIGATOR_12969]

Symptomatic t reatments  suggested for any grade of HFSR include the 
following:  
• Use moisturizing creams frequently and especially on hands and feet 
• Consider topi[INVESTIGATOR_477365]: urea 20-40 % cream, or salicylic acid 6%, or tazarotene 0.1% cream , or fluorouracil 5% cream

Increases in blood pressure have been observed in subjects receiving trametinib. Recommendations for blood pressure monitoring and management are provided below.   
Monitoring of Hypertension  
All blood pressure assessments should be performed under t he following optimal 
conditions for the study subject: 
• has been seated with back support, ensuring that legs are uncrossed and flat on the floor 
• is relaxed comfortably for at least 5 minutes  
• restrictive clothing has been removed from  the cuff area and the right cuff size has been selected

• remain s quiet during the measurement 
 
In subjects with an initial blood pressure reading within the hypertensive range, a 
second reading should be taken at least 1 minute later, with the 2 readings averaged to obtain a final blood pressure measurement. The averaged value should be recorded in the eCRF.  Persistent hypertension is defined  as an increase of systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) > 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 90 mm Hg in three consecutive visits with blood pressure assessments from two readings collected as described above. Visits to monitor increased blood pr essure can be scheduled 
independently from the per-protocol visits outlined in the Time and Events Table (see section 6.1). Ideally, subsequent blood pressure assessments should be performed within one week.   Asymptomatic hypertension is defined as an increase of SBP  to >140 mm Hg 
and/or DBP >90 mm Hg in the absence of symptoms including headache, light -
headedness, vertigo, tinnitus, epi[INVESTIGATOR_829152].

Pyrexia accompanied by [CONTACT_27913], dehydration requiring IV fluids, or severe rigors/chills should be reported as an SAE (see section 7.3.3).   Subjects should be instructed on the importance of immediately reporting febrile epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  In the event of a fever, the subject should be instructed to take non- steroidal anti- pyretics  (e.g., ibuprofen),

(including blood pressure) for signs and symptoms of infection or hypersensitivity is required; laboratory work-up should include full blood count, electrolytes, creatinine, BUN, CRP, liver function tests, blood culture, and urine culture. For subjects experiencing pyrexia complicated by [CONTACT_483021], severe chills, etc., a clinical evaluation and laboratory work-up is mandatory for each event; anti- pyretic 
treatment should be started immediately at the first occurrence and prophylactic anti-pyretic treatment is recommended.  This prophylactic treatment may be

palmetto, or ginseng).  
• Antiretroviral drugs.  Subjects with known HIV are ineligible for study participation.   
• Drugs that are clinically relevant strong in hibitors or inducers of CYP3A, 
CYP2 C8, p-glycoprotein (Pgp) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)  
transporter because they may alter dabrafenib and/or trametinib  
concentrations.  These include but are not limited to those listed in section 11.2 (see Appendices); consider therapeutic substitutions for these medications.  This list may be modified based on emerging data.  
4.5.2 Drugs to be used with Caution 
The following medications should be used with caution as their concentrations 
may be altered by [CONTACT_829219] (see section 11.2.2 in appendices): 
 
• Drugs that are mild/moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A, CYP2C8, or Pgp or BCRP transporter. 
• Drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 that are 
highly sensitive to inhibitors or that have a low therapeutic index . 
Dabrafenib has been shown to induce CYP3A4 in vivo and may induce 
CYP2B6.  Other enzymes such as CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and 
UGT  may also be affected. Onset of induction is likely to occur after [ADDRESS_1150682] few days of treatment. Upon 
discontinuation of dabrafenib, concentrations of these sensitive substrates may increase and subjects should be monitored for toxicity and dosage of these agents may need to be adjusted .[6] 
•  Co-administration of dabrafenib and medications that  are affected by [CONTACT_829220] (including warfarin, hormonal contraceptives, dexamethasone, antiretroviral agents or immunosuppressants ) may result 
in loss of efficacy.  If co -administration of these medications is necessary, 
investigators should monitor subje cts for loss of efficacy or consider 
substitutions of these medication s. 
• Drugs that alter the pH of the upper GI tract (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, antacids) may alter the solubility of dabrafenib 
and reduce its bioavailability. However, no formal clinical trial has been conducted to evaluate the effect of gastric pH -altering agents on the 
systemic exposure of dabrafenib. When dabrafenib is coadministered with a proton pump inhibitor, H2-receptor antagonist or antacid, systemic exposure of dabrafenib may be decreased and the effect on its efficacy is unknown. 
4.5.3 Dabrafenib and Radiation 
Radiation skin injury has been reported with concurrent use of dabrafenib and 
radiation. To reduce this risk, it is recommended that dabrafenib be held for seven

45 days before and two days after radiation in subjects receiving dabrafenib in 
combination with trametinib.   
4.6 Duration of Therapy 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue 
until:  
• Disease progression * (*Some patients may remain on treatment after 
progression (at the discretion of the investigator) as long as they are still experiencing clinical benefit  
• In patients without progression, therapy may continue up to 3 years 
• Inter -current illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, OR  
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigato r. 
4.7 Duration of Follow Up 
Patients who come off therapy due to progression will enter the follow-up phase 
every 3 months for up to 1 year from study entry to document survival (no tumor measurement per study protocol will be necessary after progression).   
 Patients who come off therapy for reasons other than progression will enter the follow-up phase every [ADDRESS_1150683] not yet 
experienced progressive disease (PD), these evaluations will be documented in the 
eCRF until PD is confirmed. Regardless, of the reason that a patient comes off 
treatment, dermatologic exams will continue every [ADDRESS_1150684] 6 months 
following discontinuation from dabrafenib, and may be done by a physician local 
to the patient. Only after these dermatologic exams are complete is the patient considered off follow-up, even if they do not require survival follow- up for this 
entire 6 month period.  Patients who come off therapy for reasons other than progression, later receive the dabrafenib/trametinib off-study and then progress on the combination therapy may be re-consented to undergo a progression biopsy. These subjects will then 
remain on study for safety monitoring, in relation to the biopsy procedure, for [ADDRESS_1150685] an ongoing ≥grade 2 or serious AE (SAE) related to the 
study procedure at 30 days will continue to be followed until the event is resolved or deemed irreversible by [CONTACT_093].  
4.8 Rem oval of Patients from Protocol Therapy 
Patients will be removed from study treatment when any of the criteria listed in Section 4.6 apply.  Notify the Principal Investigator, and document the reason for 
removal from study treatment and the date the patient  was removed in the

46 electronic Case Report Form  (eCRF) .  The patient should be followed-up per 
protocol.     
 In case a patient decides to prematurely discontinue protocol therapy (“refuses  
treatment”), the patient should be asked if she or he may still be  contact[CONTACT_690110]. The outcome of that discussion should be documented in both the medical records and in the eCRF.  Excessive patient  withdrawals  from protocol therapy or from the study can render 
the study un- interpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of  patients should 
be avoided. 
4.9 Patient Replacement  
If a patient drops out of the study prior to progression, they may be replaced after consultation with the manufacturer of trametinib and dabrafenib, [COMPANY_004].  We anticipat e that ≤3 patients will fall into this category. 
4.10 Study Withdrawal  
If a patient decides to withdraw  from the study (and not just from protocol 
therapy)  all efforts should be made to complete and report study assessments as 
thoroughly as possible. The investigator should contact [CONTACT_76409] a responsible relative by [CONTACT_353197] a personal visit to establish as completely as  possible the reason for the study withdrawal. A complete final 
evaluation at the time of the  patient’s study withdrawal  should be made with an 
explanation of why the patient is  withdrawing from the study. If the reason for 
removal of a patient from the study is an  adverse event, the principal specific 
event will be recorded on the eCRF.

5.1.5 Adverse Events (AEs) Associated with Trametinib  
The data and guidance presented in this section is based on the nonclinical data 
and the safety profile seen in clinical studies involving trametinib to date, described in the trametinib  Investigator’s Brochure s.[4]   
 Based on available AE data from the clinical studies to date, the most common toxicities ≥ 20% at the 2.0 mg/day dose are rash, diarrhea, fatigue, pe ripheral 
edema, nausea, vomiting, constipation, anemia, decreased appetite, dyspnea, pruritus, and abdominal pain. Rash and diarrhea are common, class- effect 
toxicities for MEK inhibitors. In addition, visual impairment and left ventricular ejection fracti on (LVEF) reduction, although observed at lower frequencies, are 
also considered class effect toxicities as they have been observed with trametinib as well as other MEK inhibitors.  Other very common toxicities (≥10% up to 19%) 
include alopecia, dermatitis acneiform, dry skin, pyrexia, hypertension, cough, 
and dry mouth; common toxicities (≥1% to <10%) include pneumonitis, dehydration, periorbital edema, blurred vision, vision impairment, left ventricular dysfunction, lymphedema, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], stomatitis, eryth ema, palmar -plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, chapped skin, skin fissures, asthenia, facial edema, mucosal inflammation, cellulitis, folliculitis, paronychia, pustular rash, increases in ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and serum creatinine, and decreas ed ejection 
fraction. Uncommon toxicities include hypersensitivity (which may present with symptoms such as fever, rash, increased LFTs, and visual disturbances), chorioretinopathy, papi[INVESTIGATOR_59411], retinal detachment, retinal vein occlusion, cardiac failure,  pneumonitis, and interstitial lung disease.  
 
The following Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions apply:  
 
Contraindications: Pregnancy:  
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of [COMPANY_004]1120212 in pregnant 
women. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity. In repeat dose studies

Amendment [ADDRESS_1150687] to the fetus should be explained to the patient and partner (as applicable). Safety and efficacy in the elderly or pediatric populations have not been investigated.  
Lactation 
It is not known whether trametinib  is excreted in human milk. Because many  
medicinal  products are excreted in human milk, a risk to the nursing infant cannot 
be excluded. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to 
discontinue  
Hypersensitivity  
Any known hypersensitivity to the constituents of the vehicle would 
contrain dicate trametinib use.  Hypersensitivity to trametinib was reported by [CONTACT_829223] 7 days after starting trametinib who experienced fever, asthenia, visual disturbance, and symptoms suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction described by [CONTACT_1694] “vascularity.” This subject also developed LFT elevations, 
lower limb nodules that by [CONTACT_377494] “dermo -hypodermatitis with 
plasmocyte and lymphocyte infiltrate.”  
 
Precautions:  
Pediatric Use  
Trametinib should not be administered to pediatric populations and should be administered to elderly populations with caution. 
 
Skin toxicities: Rash was a common toxicity in the FTIH study, and occurred at 
doses as low as 0.5 mg. At the 2.0 mg dose level in the FTIH study, 87% of the subjects experienced rash; most cases were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity; rash occurred as early as the first week of dosing, with the median onset on Day 15 of study treatment.  In clinical studies overall, rash has been observed in about 60% 
of subjects. The majority of these cases was  Grade 1 or 2 and did not require any 
dose interruptions or dose reductions.

Gastrointestinal toxicities: Diarrhea was a common toxicity, and occurred 
throughout the dose range. At the 2.0 mg dose level in the FTIH study, 56% of the subjects experienced diarrhea; most events were either Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity.  
 
Visual impairment:  
Visual impairments,  including chorioretinopathy, retinal vein occlusion (RVO), 
retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_6678] (RPED) and papi[INVESTIGATOR_829170].  
 
Subjects with a history of RVO or risk factors of RVO should not receive trametinib. Exclusion criteria based on these risk factors, comprehensive stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418], dose modifications, and ocular effects management guidelines have been incorporated into this protocol.[ 4] 
 
Cardiomyopathy:  
Cardiomyopathy, defined as cardiac failure, l eft ventricular dysfunction , or 
decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)  has been reported with 
trametinib as well as with other MEK inhibitors in clinical development. Subjects with a history or evidence of cardiovascular risk including current ≥ Class II congestive heart failure as defined by [CONTACT_829224]. Subjects must have a normal LVEF on screening assessment. Comprehensive stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418], dose modifications, and left ventricular dysfunction management guidelines have been incorporated into this study. In addition, there have been [ADDRESS_1150688] reported across the trametinib program.  See the trametinib IB .[4]

50 compared to fasted conditions. The recommendation is to administer trametinib 
on an empty stomach.  
 
Renal Impairment  
No dosage adjustment is required in subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment. There are no data in subjects with severe renal impairment; therefore, trametinib should be used with caution in subjects with seve re renal  impairment.  
 
Hepatic Impairment  
No dosage adjustment is required in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. There 
are no clinical data in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, trametinib should be used with caution in subj ects with moderate or  
severe hepatic impairment.  
  Potential for Abuse and Dependence: Not known. 
 
Overdose:  
 In BRF113220 study, 12 subjects experienced fourteen events of trametinib  
overdose as defined by [CONTACT_760] (trametinib doses > 2mg in a day). All 
overdoses lasted for one day only. Five of these subjects took 2 tablets (4mg) trametinib  and experienced 12 AEs, all within 3 days of taking the overdose. The 
adverse events were primarily  grade 1 (chills, hot flash, diarrhea, low back pain, 
changes in  hair texture, vomiting, weakness, and cough), with grade [ADDRESS_1150690] experienced mesenteric artery thrombosis identified as due to disease progression. No subjects required dose reduction or discontinuation. All subjects resumed trametinib treatment at the assigned dose.  In the event of a trametinib overdose, defined as administration of more than 3mg once daily (the maximum tolerated dose defined in the MEK111054 study), the investigator should contact [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_829171]/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities. The investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose.   Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by [CONTACT_829225]  [INVESTIGATOR_829172].  
 There is no specific antidote for an overdose with trametinib. In the event of a suspected overdose, it is recommended that the appropriate supportive clinical care should be instituted, as dictated by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical status.  Hemodia lysis 
is not expected to enhance the elimination of trametinib as it is highly bound to plasma proteins. The most likely results of acute overdose with trametinib may include rash, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

5.2.6 Contraindications 
Drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A or CYP2C8, Pgp or B CRP  
transporters, are contraindicated.  See appendices and sections 4.5 and 11.2.1.  
Any known hypersensitivity to the constituents of the vehicle would contraindicate dabrafenib use.  
5.2.7 Special Warnings and Special Precautions for Use  
Dermatological effects:  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_85783] (acanthosis) and hyperkeratosis of the skin was seen in dogs and in rats. In clinical trials rashes have been observed, and in the monotherapy studies hyperkeratosis (29%), skin lesions including actinic keratosis  (7%) and seborrheic keratosis (7%), hand -foot skin reactions (13%), 
rash (18 %) and cutaneous SCC 
including keratoacanthomas (KA) (9%) have been 
observed. Approximately 70% of events occurred within the first 12 weeks of treatment with a median time to onset of 8 weeks. More than 90% of patients who developed cutaneous SCC continued on dabrafenib treatment without dose modification. 
Most events were Grade 1 with the exception of cutaneous squamous 
cell carcinomas, which were predominantly Grade 3. Dermatological changes are

Amendment [ADDRESS_1150692] been provided in the protocol.
  
 
Non-cutaneous secondary/recurrent malignancy  
Cases of RAS -driven malignancies have been seen with BRAF inhibitors. 
One case of RAS -mutation positive non-cutaneous malignancy (bile duct 
adenocarcinoma) has been identified to date in a subject receiving dabrafenib monotherapy. Patients should be monitored as clinically appropriate.  
Ophthalmology effects: 
Eye effects i ncluding blurred vision (2), uveitis/iritis (<1%) , eye pain (<1%), 
visual impairment (<1%)  and
 reduced visual acuity (<1%) have been infrequently 
observed in clinical studies to date, with events generally grade 1 or 2. An 
ophthalmologic consult is required for subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_482949], eye pain or erythema.
  
 
Pyrexia: 
In clinical studies, pyrexia was one of the most frequently occurring AEs (27%), 
most of which (64%) were considered to be related to study treatment. Events were primarily Grade 1 (55%) or Grade 2 (39%) in severity. The majority of events occurred early  
during study treatment, with a median time to onset of first 
occurrence of [ADDRESS_1150693] cases (74% of first occurrences) were of short 
duration (5 days). The majority of subjects with pyrexia were managed without dose interruption or dose reduction.  
 
Subjects should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of infection and work up 
considered as clinically indicated. Drug must be held for fever of 38.5°C or higher, and an absolute neutrophil count, serum creatinine and BUN  must be 
drawn in the setting of fever. Subjects with fever should have a medical evaluation including measurement of blood pressure. Cases of fever with rigors or fever with hypotension should be reported as SAEs (regardless of whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124889]); see section 7.1.4. 
 
Glucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase:  
Subjects with a history of known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) 
deficiency may develop non-immune hemolytic anemia in response to dabrafenib 
which contains a sulfonamide, a potential risk factor for subjects with this 
deficiency (NOTE: patients with history of s ulfa allergies do not need to be 
excluded from studies incorporating dabrafenib).  
Hyperglycemia: 
Hyperglycemia requiring an increase in the dose of, or initiation of insulin or oral 
hypoglycemic agent therapy can occur with dabrafenib .  The incidence of grade 3 
hyperglycemia based on laboratory values was 6% in patients treated with 
dabrafenib  compared to 0% in the dacarbazine group in the phase 3 randomized 
LCCC1128   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_829144], MD MPH  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment [ADDRESS_1150694] or any increase in the 
volume or frequency of urination. 
 
Acute renal failure:  
Acute renal failure/renal failure has been rarely reported (<1%) in patients receiving dabrafenib, and a case of granulomatous interstitial nephritis has also been reported in a clinical trial. In some cases complicated pyrexia may be associated with renal insufficiency/renal failure, possibly secondary to dehydration or hypotension. Renal function should be monitored carefully, especially in patients with pyrexia. Dab rafenib should be interrupted in patients 
with significantly elevated serum creatinine (creatinine rise > 0.5 mg/dL [44 μmol/L] above baseline or creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL [177 μmol/L]).   
Pancreatitis:  
Pancreatitis (<1%) and/or increased lipase/amylase (2%) have been reported at 
low frequency with dabrafenib, typi[INVESTIGATOR_117384] 14 days of starting therapy. For adverse events of abdominal pain or suspected pancreatitis, amylase and lipase laborato ry samples should be monitored locally.  
 
New primary melanoma:  
New primary melanomas have been reported in patients treated with dabrafenib. 
These were identified within the first 5 months of therapy and did not require treatment  modification other than excision. Monitoring for skin lesions should 
occur as described  for cuSCC . 
 
Hypersensitivity:  
There has been a report of hypersensitivity (blisters), occurring on the same day 
as the 1st dose of study drug as well as upon rechallenge. Grade 1 AEs of bliste rs 
on limbs (4 subjects) and drug hypersensitivity (rash, [ADDRESS_1150695]) have been reported in previous studies with dabrafenib. However, the precise etiology of these events is unclear.  
 
Drug interactions:  
Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A or CYP2C8 are prohibited sinc e they may 
increase or decrease d abrafenib concentrations. Mild or moderate 
inhibitor/inducers of these enzymes/transporters should be used with caution. 
Dabrafenib has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, and,may induce CYP2C8, CYP2B6 , CYP2C19 and UGT. Co-administration of dabrafenib and 
medications affected by [CONTACT_829227]. If co- administration 
of these medications is necessary, investigators should monitor subjects for loss of efficacy or consider substitutions of these medications. 
LCCC1128   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_829144], MD MPH  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment [ADDRESS_1150696] gastric pH:  
Drugs that alter the pH of the upper GI tract (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, 
H2-receptor antagonists, antacids) may alter the solubility of dabrafenib 
and reduce its bioavailability. However, no formal clinical trial has been conducted to evaluate the effect of gastric pH -altering agents on the 
systemic exposure of dabrafenib. When dabrafenib is coadministered with a proton pump inhibitor, H2-receptor antagonist, or antacid, systemic exposure of dabrafenib may be decreased and the effect on its efficacy is unknown. 
 
Drug -food i nteractions:  
Administration of dabrafenib with a high-fat, high- calorie meal reduced the oral 
bioavailability of dabrafenib when compared to the fasted state with a decrease in Cmax and AUC of 51% and 31%, respectively, and delayed its absorption.  The recommendation is to take dabrafenib on an empty stomach.  
Pediatric population:  
Safety and efficacy in the pediatric population has not been established, therefore,  
dabrafenib should not be administered to this population. 
5.2.8 Other Considerations 
Renal impairment  
There are limited clinical data for dabrafenib in subjects with renal impairment. In 
clinical studies, 3% of subjects had baseline Grade [ADDRESS_1150697] on dabrafenib pharmacokinetics given the low renal excretion of dabrafenib and metabolites. There are currently no data on which to base a dosing recommendation in subjects with severe renal impairment or end -stage renal 
disease.
 Dabrafenib should be administered with caution in this setting.  
 
 
Hepatic impairment  
There are limited clinical data for dabrafenib in subjects with hepatic impairment. 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, dabrafenib oral clearance and thus exposure was not signif icantly different in  subjects with mild hepatic impairment 
compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. There are no PK data in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, the potential need 
for starting dose adjustment cannot be determined . 
In clinical studies, mild 
elevations in AST or ALT were observed in 9% and 13% of subjects, respectively, at 
baseline. Based on preclinical and in vitro studies, hepatic metabolism and biliary 
secretion are likely to be the primary route of eli mination. Dabrafenib 
concentrations may  be increased in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment. Dosage adjustment may be required, particularly in subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment .

Amendment [ADDRESS_1150698] the potential for 
cardiovascular effects, including cardiac valve effects in the 28 day dog study, 
coronary vascular effects in the 7 day dog study, hepatic vascular effects in a 10 day rat study, increased incidence of minimal car diomyopathy in male rats and 
mild increases in heart rate in single dose studies in dogs and rats. In addition, preliminary histological assessment of hearts from a 13 -week oral toxicity study 
in dogs with dabrafenib revealed treatment- related right atrial  wall thickening 
characterized microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_829174] (transmural granulation tissue) associated with the right atrium/appendage.  Dabrafenib clinical protocols did not exclude subjects with risk factors for or known atherosclerotic coronary artery disease if cardiac function was stable, thus these conditions were frequently present at study entry, consistent with the expected incidence in the general population. Subjects with clinically significant baseline cardiac abnormalities wer e excluded from the studies. In the Phase III 
study BREAK -3 in which subjects with unresectable BRAFV600E mutation-
positive melanoma received either dabrafenib or dacarbazine (DTIC) chemotherapy, none of the individual cardiac AEs of potential concern including decreased LVEF, valvular abnormalities, conduction abnormailities, or myocardial effects was seen at a higher incidence relative to DTIC than  
expected, when viewed in context of the 3:1 randomization and the longer exposure of dabrafenib treated patients (4.9 vs 2.8 months). Therefore, the preclinical findings regarding potential cardiovascular AEs have not been confirmed by [CONTACT_252251].   
 
Reproductive effects  
In embryofetal development studies in rats, developmental toxicities including 
reduced fetal body weight, embryo -lethality, cardiac ventricular septal defect 
malformations, delayed skeletal development and variation in thymic shape have been observed. In pregnant rats given dabrafenib, dose-dependent reductions in 
ovarian corpora lutea have been observed. Animal studies with dabrafenib have shown embryofetal developmental toxicities, including teratogenic effects. Dabrafenib must not be administrated to pregnant women or nursing mothers. Female subjects of childbearing potential are required to use effective methods of contraception from the time of a negative serum pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_1150699] dose of study medication.

No pattern of specific events was observed; all adverse events in the integrated safety population (ISP) occurred at a frequency of <1% with the exceptions of cough (11%), dyspnoea (5%), oropharyngeal pain and productive cough (1% each).  
 
Overdose  
There has been a single report of dabrafenib overdose in study BRF112680 in which the patient ingested 300 mg three times daily (TID) (900 mg cumulative daily dose) instead of the intended dose of 100 mg TID (300 mg cumulative daily dose), for a period of [ADDRESS_1150703] in BRF112680 who mistakenly took 225mg BID of dabrafenib for 11 days (22 doses) along with trametinib 2mg from study day 58 through day 68; this event was identified as an overdose by [CONTACT_779]. On study day [ADDRESS_1150704] reported AEs of Grade 1 diarrhea and Grade 1 seasonal allergies; neither  
resolved, the dia rrhea was considered related to study treatment. There were no  
vital signs, laboratory studies, or cardiac assessments obtained during the event of overdose. The subject discontinued treatment on study day 226 due to disease progression. 
 
In the event of a dabrafenib overdose, defined as administration of more than 300 mg as a single dose or 600 mg daily (the highest dose tested in clinical studies to date), the investigator should contact [CONTACT_28778] [INVESTIGATOR_829176]/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities. Hemodialysis is not expected to enhance the elimination  of dabrafenib as it is 
highly bound to plasma proteins. The investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose.

1Radiological assessments, physical, dermatologic and ophthalmic exams, EKG and ECHO , as well as laboratory evaluations including 
hematology, serum chemistries, and LFTs may be performed up to 3 weeks prior to day 1 of treatment.  Screening labs performed within 48 hours 
prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 do not need to be repeated on C1D1.  
 
2Treatment cycles are defined as every  21 days ; study site visits are every other cycle after cycle 9 . The study window f or cycle 9  and beyond is 
+/-5 days. Please note: patients may remain on treatment after progression (at the discretion of the investigator) as long as they are still 
experiencing clinical benefit (see section 4.1). Patients may continue on study and receive treatment for up to 3 years or death (whichever occurs 
first) with clinic visits and tumor evaluations as noted in table.  
 
3 a Repeat ophthalmic exams annually while on treatment and if clinically -indicated due to the presence of ocular symptoms. The exams will be 
performed one year after the day 1 cycle 8 visit +/ - 2 months and every year thereafter until the patient is off treat ment. See Appendix G (section 
11.7) for Ophthalmic Exam Worksheet.   
 
4The end of treatment visit should only occur when patients permanently stop study treatment and should be performed 30 days (+/-7 days) after 
the last dose of study medication. All adverse events and concomitant medications should be followed up until the 30-day End of Treatment (EOT) 
visit.  Patients who have an ongoing ≥grade 2 or serious AE (SAE ) at the EOT will continue to be followed until the event is resolved or deemed 
irreversible by [CONTACT_093]. See section 6.5 for follow -up schedule for patients who discontinue study treatment due to progression or for other 
reasons.  
 
5Complete histo ry at baseline only, thereafter focused history on symptoms/toxicity; physical exam to include height (baseline only), weight, and 
vital signs  
 
6Dermatologic exams will continue every [ADDRESS_1150707] 6 months following discontinuation from dabrafe nib, and should include 
monitoring for cutaneous and non- cutaneous secondary/recurrent malignancies.  
 
7Serum B -HCG within [ADDRESS_1150708] dose of study medication for WOCBP; serum B- HCG will be repeated only if clinically appropriate.  
 
8Hematology : CBC with differential, Hgb, and platelet count; Serum chemistries : creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, 
phosphorus , LDH and albumin. Liver function tests:  total bilirubin, AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT). Also see sections [IP_ADDRESS] and 11.4 4 for 
required monitoring in event of liver toxicities, including possibility of blood draw for pharmacokinetics.  If screening evaluations of these tests are performed within 48 hours prior to Day 1 of treatment, they do not need to be repeated.

11Tumor imaging should remain consistent throughout study, and will include contrasted computed tomography (CT) scan of chest, abdomen and 
pelvis. These tests may be performed  within 7 days prior to the study visit . At screening, a scan of the brain is required; MRI unless 
contraindicated, in which case a CT scan with contrast may be substituted. Beyond screening, a scan of the brain is not required but should be 
repeated if clinically ind icated. For patients removed from treatment for reasons other than diseas e progression, follow- up tumor assessments (if 
available) should be documented until PD is confirmed.

Cardiac monitoring:  12- lead ECG, ECHO (preferred) or MUGA  
Concomitant medications : Documentation of all concomitant medications, and in 
particular any prohibited drugs and drugs to be used with caution as listed in the appendices (see section 11.2).  NOTE : Patients will be given  a list of medications 
that are prohibited and/or should be used with caution as a separate document.  Patients will be informed that these drugs may interact with trametinib or dabrafenib, and ma y increase or decrease their toxicity.   
Patient Diary: Patients will be provided diary (as separate document) and 
instructed to record the time and date of each dose of study medication.  Diary will be reviewed during study  visits.  See Appendices, section 11.6, for a model 
diary.  
Toxicity assessment:  Using NCI CTCAEv4 for baseline documentation 
Tissue acquisition: Sufficient frozen tissue remaining from diagnostic biopsy or willing 
to undergo biopsy for research purposes.  See section 6.7 and laboratory manual. 
Tumor measurement:  Tumor measurement or imaging should remain consistent 
throughout study, and will include contrasted computed tomography (CT) scan of 
chest, abdomen and pelvis.  These tests may be performed ±7 days of the 
scheduled day.  At screening, an MRI of the brain is required. 
Brain scan: At screening, a scan of the brain is required; MRI unless

6.7 Correlative Stud y Procedures  
For both those patients who do and do not co-enroll into LCCC1108, we will ask 
for a blood sample (~8mLs in a yellow -top ACD tube) to ensure sufficient 
germline DNA in the event tissue samples are insufficient.  This request and 
collection may take place at any point during the study, including during follow-up.  At baseline, if patient does not have frozen tissue available, fresh tissue must be obtained by [CONTACT_9256].  B iopsy of tumor will be repeated at or after progression 
(clinical or radiological)  whether patient continues treatment post progression or 
not.  If possible, biopsies at progression should be performed within 7 business days of documented disease progression, and optimally within 4 hours of taking that day’s study medication. Please note that drug may be extended post progression (see section 4.1), and there is no need to hold drug for any length of time prior to the biopsy.  In fact, patients wi ll be requested to remain on study 
medication until the biopsy at progression is performed. If the treating physician 
decides to continue treatment at progression because the patient exhibits continued clinical benefit from therapy, the biopsy may be delayed until the investigator deems the biopsy feasible as long as patient safety is not compromised Post-treatment biopsies will not be required for patients removed for reasons other than disease progression. See laboratory manual.  
 
Note : For subjects who a re withdrawn from study treatment, but are later placed 
back on the trametinib/dabrafenib combination therapy, a biopsy may be collected from the former study subject at the time of progression from the standard of care trametinib/dabrafenib therapy.   The se subjects must be re-consented and placed

may be performed by [CONTACT_829228].  The number of - passes made through tumor per biopsy will be 
determined by [CONTACT_829229] .  The tissue collected will be 
divided into aliquots (depending on size of collection, up to 4 aliquots per collection).  For patients who co-enroll into LCCC1108 for NextGen sequencing, enough tissue will be collected for both kinomining and NextGen sequencing by

samples are available to achieve both kinomining and NextGen sequencing, priority will be given to kinomining.    Additional details r egarding processing, 
storing and handling tissue will be provided in a separate laboratory manual.     Biological samples collected for the study will be stored at the research laboratories at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC), University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC until the completion of the study.  With patient consent, any remaining tumor tissue after protocol specific studies are complete will be stored for future research concerning melanoma.  
6.7.1 Biopsy Risks 
The risks of these procedures are associated with a small risk of pain, bleeding, 
infection, and damage to adjacent organs.  The magnitude of this risk depends somewhat upon the site of the procedure.   
 
Potential risks according to site are:  
Skin/chest wall (punch biopsy or surgical excision ):  
Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding.  Less likely: moderate or major bleeding, or infection  
 
 Lymph node or soft tissue (punch biopsy or surgical excision ): 
Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding.  Less likely: moderate or  major bleeding, need for blood transfusion, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190747], infection, pneumothorax, damage to adjacent organs. Additional risks may be present if intravenous conscious sedation (IVCS) is required  (see below) . 
 
Liver (core needle biopsy): 
Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding  
Less likely: moderate or major bleeding, need for blood transfusion, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190747], infection, bowel perforation or damage to adjacent organs Additional risks may be present if IVCS is required  (see below) . 
 
Breast (core biopsy): punch biopsy or surgical excision  
Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding.  Less likely: moderate or major bleeding, need for blood transfusion, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190747], infection, pneumothorax, damage to adjacent organs.  In order to minimize the risk of a biopsy, only qualified personnel will perform these procedures.  Prior to the procedure, the physician performing the procedure will discuss the risks with each study participant, answer any questions, and obtain a separate procedure consent.  For biopsies of lesions that are not superficial and clearly palpable, imaging studies such as CT or ultrasound will be

69 used to guide the biopsy in order to minimize the risk of damage to adjacent 
structures.  Patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation, and patients with abnormal coagulation studies, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia will not undergo biopsy until and unless these resolve because o f the increased risk of potential 
complications under these circumstances.  After lymph node biopsies, patients will be observed for approximately 2 hours (range 2-4 hours) after the procedure, or per institutional standard guidelines.  After liver biopsie s, patients will be 
observed for approximately 4 hours (range 4-6 hours) after the procedure, or per institutional standard guidelines.  Less than the goal quantity of tissue is acceptable for each type of biopsy, and will be left to the clinical judgment of the physician performing the procedure.   
6.7.[ADDRESS_1150718] had previous allergic reactions to local anesthetics.   
 
Intravenous Conscious Sedation  (IVCS)  
Certain biopsy procedures, such as lymph node or liver biopsies, may require 
IVCS.  IVCS is a minimally depressed level of consciousness that retains the patient’s ability to maintain a patent airway independently and continuously and respond appropriately to physical stimulatio n and verbal commands.  The 
medications used to induce conscious sedation include the benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_829178], as per standard of care.  IVCS is performed once over a [ADDRESS_1150719] longer 
than 60 minutes.    
Midazolam : 
See http://www.drugs.com/pro/midazolam-injection.html  for complete prescribing 
information on midazolam, including complete information on risks associated with its use.   
 The risks of midazolam include respi[INVESTIGATOR_692846], especially when used for sedation in non- critical settings.  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_829179].  In very rare cases, when this was not recognized promptly and treated effectively, death or hypoxic encephalopathy has resulted.  Other serious cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_829180], including airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, apnea, and cardiac ar rest, rarely resulting in death or permanent neurologic injury.  There 
have also been rare reports of hypotensive epi[INVESTIGATOR_254758],

Prolonged sedation may also be seen midazolam is administered concomitantly with drugs known to inhibit the P450 3A4 enzyme system such as cimetidine, erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, ketoconazole and itraconazole.   
 Adverse effects reported after intravenous administration of a single dose when used as a sedative include the following (percentage is percentage of adult patients with adverse events): hiccoughs (3.9%), nausea (2.8%), vomiting (2.6%), coughing (1.3%), “oversedation” (1.6%), headache (1.5%), and drowsiness (1.2%).  In addition, the following local effects at the site of the injection have been reported: tenderness (5.6%), pain during injection (5.0%), redness (2.6%), induration (1.7%), and phlebitis (0.4%).   Additional rare (<1.0%) adverse events occurring when midazolam is used as a sedative include:  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]  (laryngospasm, bronchospasm, dyspnea, hyperventilation, wheezing, 
shallow respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520], airway obstruction, tachypnea ); 
Cardiovascular  (bigeminy, premature ventricular contractions, vasovagal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], 
bradycardia, tachycardia, nodal rhythm ); 
Gastrointestinal (a cid taste, excessive salivation, retching ); 
CNS/Neuromuscular ( retrograde amnesia, euphoria, hallucination, confusion, 
argumentat iveness, nervousness, anxiety, grogginess, restlessness, emergence 
delirium or agitation, prolonged emergence from anesthesia, dreaming during emergence, sleep disturbance, insomnia, nightmares, athetoid movements, seizure- like activity, ataxia, dizziness,  dysphoria, slurred speech, dysphonia,

Amendment [ADDRESS_1150721] also been reported with fentanyl; rarely, these have been strong enough to pose patient management problems.  Fentanyl may also produce euphoria, miosis, bradycardia and bronchoconstriction, as seen with other narcotic analgesics.  The most common serious adverse reactions reported with fentanyl include respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], apnea, rigidity, and bradycardia.  If these remain untreated, respi[INVESTIGATOR_13374], circulatory depression or cardiac arrest could occur.  Other adverse reactions that have been reported are hypertension, hypotension, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, emesis, laryngospasm and diaphoresis.    The risks of IVCS  also include inhibition of the gag reflex and concomitant risk 
of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_829181].  The chances of serious risks from IVCS are small but real; for example, in a prospective study of 14,149 patients undergoing IVCS during upper gastrointestinal endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the rate of immediate cardiopulmonary events was 2 in 1000.  The 30-day mortality was 1 per 2,000 cases.  In this study, there was a strong association between lack of monitoring and use of high-dose benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_313822].  There was also an association between the use of local anesthetic sprays to the oropharynx and the development of pneumonia.  In order to minimize the risk of IVCS , only qualified personnel (M.D. and R.N) 
will be responsible for conscious sedation.  A minimum of two individuals will be involved in the care of patients undergoing conscious sedation—the physician performing the biopsy procedure, and the individual (R.N.) who monitors the patien ts and his/her response to both the sedation and the procedure, and who is 
capable of assisting with any supportive or resuscitative measures.  The room where the procedure utilizing IVCS takes place in the interventional radiology 
suite will have adequate equipment to provide supplemental oxygen, monitor vital 
signs, and maintain an airway should this be necessary.  An emergency cart will also be immediately accessible to the room where the procedure is to take place, and emergency support services will be available on page.  Patients will be 
screened and evaluated for their fitness to undergo conscious sedation by a trained physician.  Patients with active cardiac disease are excluded from this study.  No local anesthetic spray to the oropharynx will be ne cessary, given that endoscopy 
is not a planned procedure.  Following the procedure, patients will be observed closely in the recovery room according to standard institutional guidelines.   
 
Risks of Imaging Studies 
Some biopsy procedures require imaging studies, either to plan or guide the 
procedure.  Imaging studies that may be used in obtaining tissue samples include CT scans and ultrasound.  CT scans will expose study participants to controlled amounts of radiation.  The total dose of radiation from thes e tests is not 
anticipated to cause any adverse effects.  There is also a risk of an allergic reaction to the intravenous contrast dye used during CT imaging, as well as a risk

subjects who are withdrawn from study treatment, but are later placed back on the trametinib/dabrafenib combination therapy , a biopsy may be collected from the

measurable).  
• [ADDRESS_1150726] be ≥15mm in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.    All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions, will be considered non-measurable.  Lesions considered truly non-measurable include leptom eningeal disease; ascites; pleural/pericardial 
effusion; inflammatory breast disease; lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_87415].  All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should 
be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesions is recommended.  
6.9.2 Baseline Documentation of Target and Non- Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.   
 Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longer diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those 
that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
 A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.

NOTE:  Whenever possible, a biopsied lesion should not be considered a target 
lesion for RECIST tumor assessments.  If the biopsied lesion is the only site of

Complete response (CR)− Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph node (LN) target or no must have decreased in short axis to <10mm.

target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started including baseline if that is the smallest on study.  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm.  The appearan ce of one or more new lesions also constitutes PD. 
 
Stable disease (SD)−Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.

7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Definition s  
7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an abnormal 
laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug) in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.   
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129297] (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE.  Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable by [CONTACT_353202].

76 7.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility  that the dr ug is the cause.   Reasonable possibility  means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  A 
suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
 
Causality assessment to a study drug is a  medical judgment made in consideration 
of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study t reatment, other recent 
or concomitant drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions.  Other factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE: 
• Single occurr ence of an uncommon event known to be strongly associated 
with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) 
• One or more occurrences of an event not commonly associated with drug exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon rupture); often more than once occurrence from one or multiple studies would be needed before the sponsor could determine that there is reasonable possibility  that the drug caused the event.   
• An aggregate analysis of specific events obser ved in a clinical trial that 
indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group 
7.1.[ADDRESS_1150730] information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of 
product characteristics for an approved product).  Unexpected also refers to AEs 
or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.   
7.1.4 Serious AE or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (>24 hours) or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];*  
• Results in  congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct nor mal life functions;

 FDA Expedited Reporting requirements  for studies conducted under an IND : 
A sponsor must report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and 
unexpected and related to the cellular product to the FDA. The sponsor must report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the cellular product and the adverse event, such as: 
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with cell infusion exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome); 
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with cellular product exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the cellular product (e.g. tendon rupture); 
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of cellular product therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the cell infusion treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group.  
The sponsor must submit each IND safety report on a MedWatch  form.  Each 
notification to FDA must bear prominent identification of its contents, i.e., “IND 
Safety Report,” and must be transmitted to the review division that has the responsibility for review of the IND. For this study, the review division is the Center for Drug  Evalu ation and Research . In each IND safety report, the sponsor 
must identify all IND safety reports previously submitted  to FDA concerning a 
similar suspected adverse reaction, and must analyze the significance of the suspected adverse reaction in light of previous, similar reports or any other relevant information.

but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information . The sponsor must be notified of the SAE by [CONTACT_19452] 24 
hours of the event. If the results of a sponsor’s investigation show that an adverse 
event not initially determined to be reportable is reportable, the sponsor must report such suspected adverse reaction in an IND safety report as soon as possible, but in no case later than [ADDRESS_1150740] be identified as such, i.e., “Follow -up IND Safety 
Report.” Additionally, upon request from FDA, the sponsor must submit to F DA 
any additional data or information that the agency deems necessary, as soon as possible, but in no case later than [ADDRESS_1150741] notify all participating investigators (i.e., all investigators to whom the sponsor is providing cell infusion under its INDs or under any investigator’s IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting.   
Process  
If the sponsor deems that an event is both a serious adverse reaction (SAR) AND unexpected, it must also (in addition to Oncore) be recorded on the MedWatch Form 3500A as per 21 CFR 312.32. Unexpected adverse events or adverse reaction refers to an event o r reaction that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed 
at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or if an investigator’s brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigation plan or elsewhere in the current IND application.    The MedWatch form should be submitted on MedWatch by [CONTACT_9137].   The MedWatch 3500a form can be accessed at: http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/default.htm

8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Sample Size and Data Analysis Plans 
Our sample size justification is based on the primary objective to identify kinases 
which are differentially expressed between pre ( just prior to treatment initiation ) 
and post treatment (patients who developed resistance) after treatment with 
BRAF+MEK inhibition  in melanoma patients.  
 The kinases will be profiled using Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs) coupled with mass spectrometry. We anticipate this technique to capture between 50 – 100 
kinases in melanoma patients. The kinase activity is reported as a quant ratio between the experimental and control samples. The Paragon algorithm[ 10] 
automatically  identifies high confidence peptides that will contribute to the 
average quant ratio of a kinase. O ur sample size justification is based on our 
ability to detect a meaningful difference in the kinase activity between pre and 
post treatment.  The inherent matching of tumor by [CONTACT_829232] a potential source of positive correlation that may be exploited to improve statistical power (e.g., using a paired t-test).  However, in order to be conservative, we compute our statis tical power using a two -tailed 
independent Mann -Whitney test in which the kinase activity is compared in the 
two groups. Based on preliminary data, we assume that 100 kinases are captured, of which 10% of them are truly differentially expressed between pre and post treatment and a common standard deviation of 0.95 (in log
2 scale).

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_829144], MD MPH  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment [ADDRESS_1150747] adjustment. Since multiple kinases 
work in concert to regulate their functions, prediction analysis of microarrays (PAM) based on nearest shrunken centroid [9] will also be carried out to identify a subset of kinases that predicts resistance to BRAF+MEK inhibition. We also plan to utilize the kinome pathway as prior information in the analysis for 
identifying functionally related kinase sets to improve statistical power.  Focusing 
on kinase sets  may yield more reproducible and interpretable results.  
 Fisher’s exact test will be carried out to test for association between the mutations  
at baseline to mutations upon the development of resistance to BRAF + MEK inhibition in each oncogene/tumor suppressor gene. Tumor samples from patients  
who progress while  on study and those who are removed from study and who 
later progress on the combination treatment will be analyzed as one data set. The p-values will be adjusted via FDR to account for multiple comparisons.  
 The response rate will be estimated and 95% confidence interval will be computed. Progression- free survival will be evaluated using the Kaplan -Meier 
method.  All demographic and analytic d ata will be summarized by [CONTACT_84814].   Categorical data will be summarized using frequency tables whereas 
summary statistics such as means, medians, standard deviation and range will be provided for continuous data.

94 11.4 Appendix D Liver Events  
11.4.1 Liver Event Follow Up Assessments   
For subjects meeting  any of the liver chemistry criteria 1 – 5 listed in Section 
4.4.8, make every attempt to carry out the liver event follow up assessments  
described below:  
 
• Viral hepatitis serology including:  
o Hepatitis A IgM antibody 
o Hepatitis B surface antigen  
o Hepatitis B Core Antibody (IgM)  
o Hepatitis C RNA  
o Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody   
o Epstein -Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if unavailable, 
obtain heterophile antibody or monospot testing)   
o Hepatitis E IgM antibody.  
• Blood sample for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, obtained within [ADDRESS_1150757] the date/time of the PK blood sample draw and the 
date/time of the last dose of study treatment prior to blood sample draw on 
the eCRF.  If the date or time of the last dose is unclear, provide the 
subject’s best approximation.  If the date/time of the last dose cannot be 
approximated OR a PK sample cannot be collected in the time period indicated above, do not obtain a PK sample.  If a PK analysis is required 
in the event of liver toxicity, [COMPANY_004] should be contact[CONTACT_829234]. 
• Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).  
• Fractionate bilirubin, if total bilirubin ≥2xULN.  
• Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess eosinophilia.  
• Record the appearance or worsening of clinical symptoms of hepatitis, or hypersensitivity, such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash or eosinophilia as relevant on the AE eCRF. 
Please note that treatment with trametinib often associates with rash which is usually acneiform and affects the scalp, face, neck, chest, and upper back. Discuss with study PI  [INVESTIGATOR_81730].  
• Record use of concomitant medications, acetaminophen, herbal remedies, 
other over the counter medications, or putative hepatotoxins, on the concomitant medications report form. 
• Record alcohol use on the liver event alcohol intake eCRF

95 • The following assessments are required for subjects with ALT ≥3xULN 
and bilirubin ≥ 2xULN (>35% direct) but are optional for other abnormal 
liver chemistries:  
o Anti-nuclear antibody, anti -smooth muscle antibody, and Type 1 anti-
liver kidney microsomal antibodies 
o Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computerized 
tomography) to evaluate liver disease.  
11.4.2 Drug Restart/Rechallenge Following Liver Events that are Possibly Related to Study Treatment  
Approval by [CONTACT_305702] [INVESTIGATOR_829189]: 
• The subject is receiving compelling benefit, benefit of drug res tart exceeds 
risk, and no effective alternative therapy is available.  Institutional Review Board approval of study treatment restart/rechallenge must be obtained.  
• If the restart/rechallenge is approved by [CONTACT_1201], the subject must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of drug administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death.   
• The subject must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the study treatment restart/rechalle nge.  Documentation of informed consent 
must be recorded in the study chart.   
• Subjects must then return to the clinic twice a week for liver chemistry 
tests until stable, liver chemistries have been demonstrated and then 
laboratory monitoring may resume as per protocol.  
11.4.3 Drug Restart Following Transient Resolving Liver Events Not Related to Study Treatment  
Approval by [CONTACT_115158] [INVESTIGATOR_829190]: 
• Liver chemistries have a clear underlying cause (e.g., biliary obstruction, 
hypotension and liver chemistries have improved to normal or are within 
1.5 x baseline and ALT <3xULN).  Institutional Review Board approval of study treatment restart/rechallenge must be obtained, as required.  
• If restart of study treatment is approved by [CONTACT_1201], the subject must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of drug administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death.   
• The subject must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the restart.  Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study chart.   
• Subjects must return to the clinic once a week for liver chemistry tests until stable liver chemis tries have been demonstrated, and then laboratory 
monitoring may resume as per protocol. If protocol defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_482980], study treatment must be stopped.

Type of Care  Action  
Prevention/Prophylaxisa 
 • Avoid unnecessary exposure to sunlight  
• Apply broad- spectrum sunscreen (containing titanium dioxide or zinc 
oxide) with a skin protection factor (SPF) ≥[ADDRESS_1150758] twice daily.  
• Use thick, alcohol- free emoll ient cream (e.g., glycerine and 
cetomacrogol cream) on dry areas of the body at least twice daily.  
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_829191] [ADDRESS_1150759], and upper ba ck.  
 
• Use mild -strength topi[INVESTIGATOR_27560]  (hydrocortisone 1% cream)  
or 
• topi[INVESTIGATOR_11978] (e.g., clindamycin) or oral antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline 100 mg BID, minocycline 100 mg BID)  
Symptomatic Careb  • Pruritic lesions: cool compresses and oral antihistamine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
• Fissuring lesions: Monsel’s solution, silver nitrate, or zinc oxide cream 
 
• Desquamation: thick emollients and mild soap  
• Paronychia: antiseptic bath, local potent corticosteroids in addition to oral antibiotics; if no improvement, consult dermatologist or surgeon 
 
• Infected lesions: appropriate bacterial/fungal culture -driven systemic 
or topi[INVESTIGATOR_829192]:  BID = twice daily; SPF = skin protection factor  
a. Rash prophylaxis  is recommended for the first 6 weeks of study treatment  
b. Subjects who develop rash/skin toxicities should be seen by a qualified physician and should receive evaluation 
for symptomatic/supportive care management

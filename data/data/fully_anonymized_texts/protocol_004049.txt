ABSTRACT  
 
Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortali ty in patients undergoing 
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Over 50% of infectious -related deaths in this population 
are attributable to IFI. These dismal numbers are despi[INVESTIGATOR_640636]. The failure of these strategies to impact morbidity and mortality from IFI makes a strong 
case for the exploration of preventive strategies. This study will utilize a [ADDRESS_857374] from an unrelated or mismatched related donor. The study agent will begin following at the time of transplant and continue through Day +42 or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. This study also 
seeks to evaluate the usefulness of the Fungitell beta- D glucan Assay in early diagnosis of IFI. ACCL1131 
will also  explore the relationship between proven or probable IFI and single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNP) of genes involved in immunity.

Version Date: 11/16/[ADDRESS_857383] adopted voriconazole or an echinocandin, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a paucity of data to 
support this practice (details below). Fluconazole is the trial -proven gold standard due to good tolerability and 
reasonable coverage of many Candida spp.1,2 However the emergence of fluconazole- resistant Candida , plus 
the risk of Aspergillus spp. (not covered by [CONTACT_251186]) in high -risk patients, makes the identification of a 
superior agent a priority. While voriconazole does have exce llent anti -Aspergillus  activity, it has failed to show 
superiority to fluconazole post HCT,[ADDRESS_857384] some anti -Aspergillus  activity, an excellent safety 
profile, few drug interactions, and an IV formulation (important for children with post -HCT mucositis and an 
inability to tolerate or a bsorb oral medications). The one randomized trial of an echinocandin for post -HCT 
prophylaxis showed promise at decreasing the need for empi[INVESTIGATOR_105481] -fungal agents, but enrolled few pediatric 
patients and many low -risk patients, making it difficult to defin itely determine the utility of echinocandins in 
high-risk pediatric HCT patients.[ADDRESS_857385] survival.  
 The study has been designed as an open -label comparison of an echinocandin (caspofungin) vs. an azole (local 
center determination of fluconazole or voriconazole). This open -label randomized trial will test the 
effectiveness of our intervention in a setting that will mirror usual clinical practice and thus, this more pragmatic 
design  can better inform decision -making.
17,[ADDRESS_857386] population, echinocandins and azoles (esp. voriconazole) have significant and dramatic differences relative to their interactions with concomitant medications. This is most important and relevant for 
the calcineurin inhibitors (CIs; cyclosporine and tacrolimus) and sirolimus. Caspofungin has no apparent effect 
on the lev els of CIs.
10 On the other hand, fluconazole is an inhibitor of several CYP enzymes and therefore 
causes an approximate 16 -21% increase in the levels of CIs.11 Furthermore, voriconazole is a major inhibitor 
of CYP2C9, which causes significant interactions with these crucial transplant medications. The FDA label 
reports that concomitant use of voriconazole can cause a 1.7 to 3- fold increase in cyclosporine or tacrolimus 
levels, and recommends that the dosing of cyclosporine be decreased by 50% and the dosing of tacrolimus be 
decreased by 66% of the normal dose. A recent study demonstrated in a cohort of 27 adult BMT patients receiving voriconazole, 100% of patients required multiple tacrolimus dose reductions to achieve a safe target 
level.
[ADDRESS_857387] recommended droppi[INVESTIGATOR_640637] 90% of original dosing at 
the time of initiation of voriconazole.12 Given these drug- drug interactions, it is not safe and likely not possible 
9 
Version Date: 11/16/[ADDRESS_857388] et al.  in which 7.8% of the fluconazole arm and 11.5% of the voriconazole 
arm received simultaneous off -study use of other mold -active agents.[ADDRESS_857389], there was no difference in IFI rate based on the underlying condition ( p = 0.967).
[ADDRESS_857390] reports do not distinguish the rates of IFI between various donor types. One series of retrospective data (primarily in adults) showed that the risk of IFI at 1 year in alternate donors was 
~2% higher than seen in matched -siblings.
[ADDRESS_857391] recent pediatric -specific paper by [CONTACT_640695]. , 
there was a non -significant difference in IFI rate between MSD (9.3%) vs. MUD (10.5%) vs. UCB (14.3%) (p 
= 0.3). Given the similar IFI risk across donor sources , all allogeneic donor types will be considered eligible 
for enrollment on this trial. There will be no limitatio ns to trial enrollment based on race or gender as there is 
no data to support differences in the incidence or outcomes of IFIs due to race or gender.  
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_857392] population 
has been reported to be as high as 13 -20%, with 58- 83% mortality.26-[ADDRESS_857393], ranging from 8.7% (first 28 days)26, to 4.1% (first 30 days)27, to 6.5% (first 40 days, Aspergillus  
only).[ADDRESS_857394] are those 
who undergo transplant from either an unrelated donor (including umbilical cord  blood) or a partially- matched 
related donor, for treatment of a malignancy, bone marrow failure syndrome, or congenital immunodeficiency.
15,28,[ADDRESS_857395] been developed by [CONTACT_640696] (EORTC/MSG) to standardize the definitions of proven, 
probable, and possible IFI.[ADDRESS_857396]. 
Because IFI rep resents a major source of morbidity and mortality, this would improve overall outcomes and 
10 
Version Date: 11/16/[ADDRESS_857397] diagnostic tests; therefore much attention has been focused on developi[INVESTIGATOR_640638]. Serum beta -D glucan (found in all fungi except Crytpococcus 
spp. and Zygomycetes) can be detected using an approved diagnostic serum assay (the Fungitell Assay) and 
has been found to have high specificity and high positive predictive values for the detection of I FI in adults.
[ADDRESS_857398] in identifying patients 
particularly susceptible to IFIs so that they can receive early targeted interventions. There is considerable 
evidence that there is a genetic component to the susceptibility and outcome of infection in both normal and 
immunocompromised populations. A recent study suggests an association between the donor TLR4  haplotype 
S4 and the risk of invasive aspergillosis (IA) among recipi[INVESTIGATOR_640639].[ADDRESS_857399] risk for the 
development of an IFI, which in the future may allow for enhanced prophylaxis efforts in these patients, while 
allowing less stringent prophylaxis (with less toxicity) for patients at low gen etic risk for IFI development. 
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_857400] trial was 
performed by [CONTACT_640697]. , who conducted a double -blind, randomized, multicenter trial in which patients 
greater than 12 years of age receiving autologous  or allogeneic HCTs were randomly assigned to receive 
prophylactic fluconazole (400 mg daily) versus placebo from the start of the conditioning regimen until one of 
the following: the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovered >1000/µL, toxicity was suspect ed, or a systemic 
fungal infection was suspected or proven.1 Systemic fungal infections occurred in 15.8% patients who received 
placebo as compared with 2.8% who rec eived fluconazole ( P < .001). There was no significant difference in 
overall mortality between the groups. 
 Slavin et al.  also performed a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled trial and assessed the efficacy and 
toxicity of 400 mg/day fluconazole i n preventing fungal infections during the first 75 days after autologous or 
allogeneic marrow transplantation in patients greater than 12 years of age.
2 During prophylaxis, systemic fungal 
infections oc curred in 7% of 152 fluconazole -treated patients compared with 18% of 148 placebo -treated 
patients ( P = .004). The probability of survival was improved in fluconazole recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], in whom 20% expi[INVESTIGATOR_640640] 110 after transplantation compared with 35% mor tality in placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] ( P = .004). Fluconazole 
also appeared to protect from severe GVHD of the gut, possibly from decreased intestinal antigenic stimulation.
[ADDRESS_857401] been either 6 mg/kg/day
3 or 8 mg/kg/day.14 The pediatric fluconazole dose which is equivalent to the 
dose recommended for adults in the source guideline (400 mg/day) ranges from 6- 12 mg/kg/day depending 
on patient age and weight.37-[ADDRESS_857402] a higher volume of distribution and faster elimination rate compared to

Version Date: 11/16/15 

  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACCL1131   
adults.37,38,40 From a safety standpoint, fluconazole is b elieved to be safe and well tolerated in doses up to 
12 mg/kg/day.39 This dose range is higher than the ASBMT recommendation of 3- 6 mg/kg/day.15 However, 
we feel that the higher dose is justified given the available information outlined above and the adequate 
safety data. The dose of 12 mg/kg/day also unifies our approach with that of COG ACCL0933.  
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_857403] co mpared it to mold- active 
agents. Wolff et al.  randomized patients undergoing allogeneic or autologous marrow or peripheral stem cell 
transplantation to receive fluconazole (400 mg/day PO or IV) or amphotericin B (0.2 mg/kg/day IV) beginning 
1 day prior to stem cell transplantation and continuing until recovery of ANC > 500/μl.42 Amphotericin B was 
significantly more toxic than fluconazole. Proven fungal infections occurred in 9.1% and 14.3% of  related 
allogeneic marrow recipi[INVESTIGATOR_640641] B, respectively. Given the lack of significant benefit and the higher adverse event rate, low -dose amphotericin B has failed to supplant 
fluconazole as standard -of-care prophylaxis . 
 
Extended- spectrum azoles such as itraconazole do possess anti -Aspergillus  activity. Marr et al.  performed a 
randomized trial of 304 patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplant to receive either fluconazole (400 mg/day) or itraconazole (oral solut ion 2.5 mg/kg 3 times daily, or 200 mg IV daily) for 180 days after 
transplantation, or until 4 weeks after discontinuation of GVHD therapy.
19 More patients in the itraconazole 
arm developed hepatotoxicity, and more patients were discontinued from itraconazole because of toxicities or gastrointestinal intolerance (36% vs. 16%, P < .001). Fewer patients in the itraconazole arm developed IFI 
while  on study drug (fluconazole 15% vs. itraconazole 7%, P = .03); however there was no difference in overall 
or fungal -free survival. Because of its poor tolerability, itraconazole prophylaxis has generally been abandoned.  
 
A multi -center, randomized, double -blind trial was performed in 600 patients to compare fluconazole (400  mg 
daily in adults) versus voriconazole (200 mg twice daily in adults) for the prevention of IFIs in standard risk 
allogeneic HCT patients receiving full -intensity conditioning re gimens.3 The cumulative rates of proven, 
probable and presumptive IFI were similar in the tw o arms: 11.2% for fluconazole and 7.3% for voriconazole 
at 6 months ( P = .12) and 13.7% and 12.7% at 12 months ( P = .59), respectively. Event -free and overall survival 
rates also were similar in both arms at [ADDRESS_857404], although its use has been adopted by [CONTACT_640698]. Possible reasons cited by [CONTACT_640699]: 1) that a significant fraction of patients treated 
with standard dosing of voriconazole may have had sub -therapeutic levels5; and 2) t hat voriconazole is possibly 
an inferior anti -Candida drug than fluconazole, with primarily fungistatic effects.[ADDRESS_857405]  
Echinocandins are a novel class of antifungal age nts that target β -(1,3)-D-glucan synthase and interrupt 
biosynthesis of the glucan polymers that make up fungal cell walls. Because mammalian cells do not possess 
cell walls, echinocandin administration to human patients has resulted in minimal toxicity. E chinocandins 
possess fungicidal activity against Candida spp. (including Candida krusei  and Candida glabrata , which 
possess significant degrees of fluconazole resistance) and Pneumocystis jirovecii,  as well as fungistatic activity 
against Aspergillus spp. The echinocandins may be superior to fluconazole45 or amphotericin B46 for treatment 
12 
Version Date: 11/16/[ADDRESS_857406], and compared 50 mg of micafungin (1 mg/kg 
for patients weighing <  50 kg) versus 400 mg of fluconazole (8 mg/kg for patients weighing  < 50 kg) 
administered once per day.14 Success was defined as the absence of suspected, proven, or probable IFI through 
the end of therapy and as the absence of proven or probable IFI through the end of the 4 -week period after 
treatment. Micafungin was extremely well -tolerated (discontinuation of study drug because of an adverse  
event: 4.2% in micafungin arm versus 7.2% in fluconazole arm). The overall efficacy of micafungin was superior to that of fluconazole as antifungal prophylaxis during the neutropenic phase after HCT (80.0% in the micafungin arm vs. 73.5% in the fluconazol e arm; P = .03). This trial was the first antifungal agent to 
demonstrate superior efficacy and tolerability compared to fluconazole. However, the number of pediatric subjects enrolled was small (n = 84). Also, micafungin was most effective at preventing t he need for empi[INVESTIGATOR_640642], which is a less clinically important endpoint, and did not reduce the incidence of proven or probable IFI. The lack of impact on IFIs may have been because the incidence of breakthrough IFIs in both 
groups was very l ow, likely due to the inclusion of low -risk patients (46% autologous HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) and very 
few patients undergoing umbilical cord blood transplant (n = 30), a population of significant interest to pediatric 
transplant physicians. A retrospective evaluat ion of [ADDRESS_857407] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_640643] 35- 50 mg/day for up to 100 days after transplantation as primary antifungal prophylaxis 
demonstrated that 7.3% developed breakthrough IFI in the first [ADDRESS_857408] and that it is only 
available in parental form. Thus, it is more difficult to administer once the patient has recovered from the neutropenic period and is ready for discharge from inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
2.3.4  Summary of the Two Azole Contr ol Design 
On January 26, 2011 ([ADDRESS_857409] et al.3), we initiated 
a survey of the 80 COG Transplant Centers in North America and Australia/New Zealand in order to determine local standard -of-care anti -fungal prophylaxis for patients undergoing alternative donor (unrelated or 
mismatched related) HCT. The response rate was 80%, similar to the 83% seen in a survey of COG centers 
regarding anti -infective prophylaxis in patients with AML.
[ADDRESS_857410] (including umbilical  cord blood), 56% of centers continue to use fluconazole, while 28% of centers 
have adopted voriconazole, 11% of centers utilize an echinocandin, and 5% administer a lipid formulation of amphotericin B. The data were very similar for patients undergoing mi smatch related donor HCT (57%, 27%, 
8%, and 8%, respectively). These results indicate that the profound lack of data for this patient population has led to a clinical situation where there is no clear universal agent of choice. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_640644], fully 89% of respondents indicated that 
they would be willing to participate in a trial of an echinocandin vs. an azole (center choice of fluconazole or voriconazole), as we have pro posed for this trial. Even if all of the non -responding centers refused to participate, 
this would still be 71% of COG Transplant Centers. Finally, centers willing to participate were asked which azole they would choose as the comparator, and interestingly the pediatric HCT community was split almost 
evenly between fluconazole (54%) and voriconazole (46%), further justifying our two -azole design.  
 
Therefore, our study is designed so that the local institutions will be allowed to choose what their standard- of-
care anti -fungal prophylactic azole is for the study population in question. This practical study design reflects 
the real -world situation in which different agents have been adopted by [CONTACT_640700]. Furthermore, this design mirrors the Phase III trial in which posaconazole was compared to 
either fluconazole or itraconazole (two agents with different spectrums of activity) in non -transplant patients 
with neutropenia.[ADDRESS_857411] agents with and without mold activity in orde r to optimize acceptability of the trial.  
 
13 
Version Date: 11/16/[ADDRESS_857412], fluconazole’s spectrum of activity is limited primarily to Candida  
spp. It has been demonstrated in two pi[INVESTIGATOR_640645], but no patients under the age of 12 
years were included in either trial.1,2 Therefore, while fluconazole has  been adopted as the “gold standard” for 
prophylaxis, for young children this is not based on any data. Voriconazole has the attractive feature of possessing activity against Aspergillus  spp., as well as certain fluconazole -resistant strains of Candida, 
however, with the small trade -off that it is potentially less effective than fluconazole against fluconazole -
susceptible strains of Candida , where it is fungistatic, rather than fungicidal.
43 More importantly, the 
pharmacokinetics of voriconazole are not simple. In adults and children over the age of 12  years (the subjects 
of most trials to date), voriconazole has non -linear properties with relatively well- established dosing regimens. 
Even in adults however, recent studies have called into question the “standard” dosing, and have proposed 
dosing based on serum drug levels due to ~25% of patients found to have extremely low voriconazole levels.
4,5,49 Part of this variability may be due to polymorphisms of the gene encoding for CYP2C19, which can 
result in an increase or decrease in voriconazole me tabolism.5 In children, the situation is even more 
problematic due to linear kinetics. In children between the ages of 2 and 12 years, the optimal dose may be 7 
mg/kg twice daily,7,9 while in children <  2 years of age, it may be as high as 8.5  mg/kg/dose twice daily.[ADDRESS_857413] Aspergillus  spp., its use has been adopted for primary prophylaxis  at many 
institutions, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a paucity of data to support this practice.  
 In the only head -to-head prospective trial of fluconazole vs. voriconazole, although there was a trend towards 
less IFI in the voriconazole arm, the difference was not statistical ly significant ( P = .12).
3 Furthermore, while 
patient s over two years of age were eligible for this trial, in reality the number of pediatric patients enrolled 
was very small (n = 51), and in fact, no patient under the age of [ADDRESS_857414] community (89% of respondents indicating that th ey wished to 
participate in the trial). As noted above, this potential issue has been dealt with before in other trials, such as the non- blinded randomized comparison of posaconazole to the institutional choice of fluconazole or 
itraconazole, which led to its wide acceptance by [CONTACT_165721].

4.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are 
based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care. Minor 
unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed t herapy and/or disease evaluations (and 
up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility, procedure and/or 
anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG administrative Policy 5.14 (except where explicitly 
prohibited within the protocol).  
 
4.1 Overview of Treatment Plan  
 
This is a randomized open- label clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy of caspofungin for preventing 
IFI (including IA) compared to antifungal prophylaxis with an azole (fluconazole or voriconazole), the standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_640646]. 
 
At the time of enrollment, the enrolling center will declare whether the comparator arm will be fluconazole or voriconazole based upon that institution’s standard of care and the choice of comparator should remain 
constant for the duration of the study. 
 
Patients who consent to participate in ACCL1131 will be randomly assigned to antifungal prophylaxis with 
either an azole or caspofungin. Treatment with any antifungal prophylaxis initiated prior to enrollment must 
be terminated prior to starting protocol -directed antifungal therapy. Protocol prophylaxis will be started 
within 24 hours of transplant (Day 0). Administration of antifungal prophylaxis wi ll continue until (a)  HCT 
Day +42; OR (b) Day of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3849]; OR (c) Patient meets any off -protocol criteria (Section 8.1). 
Following discontinuation of study medications, institutions may revert to local standard of care for post -
engraftment antifu ngal prophylaxis. 
 If other systemic antifungal therapy is initiated for empi[INVESTIGATOR_640647], then protocol prophylaxis should be held and assigned prophylaxis should resume when other systemic 
antifungal therapy is discontinued if this occurs prior to Day +42, Day of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3849], or at the time 
a patient is taken off-protocol therapy (see Section 8.1). 
 Fluconazole and voriconazole may be administered either intravenously (IV) or orally. Caspofungin is only available as an IV formulation. 
 
4.1.1 Randomization 
At the time of enrollment, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment regimens:  
 
i) Azole Arm:  This group will receive fluconazole or voriconazole, and represents the standard arm . 
 
ii) Caspofungin Arm : This group will receive caspofungin and represents the experimental arm . 
 Randomization will be stratified into groups based on: 
i)    Center choice of azole: 1) fluconazole vs. 2) voriconazole. 
ii) Age: 1)  ≥12 years vs. 2)  < 12 years  
iii) Type of transplant: 1) Umbilical cord blood (UCB) donor vs. 2) Non- UCB donor with ex vivo 
T-cell-depletion vs. 3) Non-UCB donor with standard pharmacologic GVHD prophylaxis.

for IFIs and initiation of empi[INVESTIGATOR_129285].51 Amphotericin B (lipid products) is a reasonable 
option based on its broad spectrum of activity as empi[INVESTIGATOR_640648]. The type, 
dose, and duration of non- assigned antifungal agent usage will be tracked. Assigned antifungal prophylaxis 
should be held during administration of these other systemic antifungal agents. 
 
4.1.3 Concomitant The rapy Restrictions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Fluconazole 
Some azoles, including fluconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval by 
[CONTACT_53402]. Drugs known to prolong the QT interval should be used with caution or avoided with 
fluconazole. The a dministration of terfenadine with high dose fluconazole (≥ 400 mg adult dose) and 
cisapride with any dose of fluconazole is contraindicated. A list of drugs that prolong the QT interval can 
be found at http://www.azcert.org . 
 
Clinically or potentially significant drug interactions with fluconazole and the following agents have been 
observed: oral hypoglycemics (tolbutamide, glyburide, glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130]), c oumarin- type anticoagulants (e.g., 
warfarin), phenytoin, cyclosporine, rifampin, theophylline, rifabutin, tacrolimus, short -acting 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (more pronounced with oral fluconazole), and oral contraceptives. Since rifampin enhances the metabolism of concurrently administered fluconazole and the dose of fluconazole may need 
to be increased, the use of rifampin in this study should be avoided. Careful monitoring is required when 
fluconazole is administered with the other drugs. Careful monitoring of calcineurin inhibitor levels is highly 
recommended on this pr otocol.  
 
Co-administration of oral fluconazole with combination contraceptives has resulted in an overall mean 
increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels. However, in some patients, levels of ethinyl estradiol 
and levonorgestrel decreased by [CONTACT_8622] 47% and 33%, respectively. While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, there is no evidence that fluconazole can induce the metabolism of these drugs. The clinical significance of the ab ove effects is currently 
undetermined and may simply be a product of inter-individual variation in metabolism. 
 
Fluconazole inhibits several cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzymes and may increase the serum level of 
drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]450 especially at high doses (> 200
 mg adult dose). For a list of drugs 
metabolized by [CONTACT_2750]450 system see http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Voriconazole 
Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval by 
[CONTACT_53402]. Drugs known to prolong the QT interval should be used with caution or avoided with 
voriconazole. The administration of terfenadine and cisapride with any dose of voriconazole is 
contraindicated . A list of drugs that prolong the QT interval can be found at http://www.azcert.org . 
 
Clinically or potentially significant drug interactions with voriconazole and the following agents have been 
observed: oral hypoglycemics (tolbutamide, glyburide, glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130]), c oumarin- type anticoagulants (e.g., 
warfarin), phenytoin, cyclosporine, rifampin, theophylline, tacrolimus, short -acting benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and 
oral contraceptives. Since rifabutin enhances the metabolism of concur rently administered voriconazole 
and the dose of voriconazole may need to be increased, the use of rifabutin in this study should be avoided. 
Careful monitoring is required when voriconazole is administered with the other drugs. Currently, the co-
administr ation of voriconazole and sirolimus is contraindicated due to significant elevation in sirolimus 
levels. It is also to be expected that the co -administration of voriconazole and a calcineurin inhibitor 
19 
Version Date: 11/16/15 

  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACCL1131   
(cyclosporine or tacrolimus) will result in a 1.7 to 3 fold increase in cyclosporine or tacrolimus levels. The 
FDA label recommends that the dosing of cyclosporine be decreased by 50%, and the dosing of tacrolimus be 
decreased by 66%, of the normal dose when given with voriconazole. Careful monitoring of calcineurin 
inhibitor levels is highly recommended on this protocol.  
 
Voriconazole inhibits several cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzymes and may increase the serum level of drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]450. For a list of drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_2750]450 system see 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart
.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Caspofungin 
Co-administration of caspofungin with certain inducers of drug clearance and/or mixed inducer/inhibitors 
(e.g., efavirenz, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, rifampin, dexamethasone, and carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) may result in 
clinically important reductions in plasma caspofungin concentrations. Therefore, the use of these interacting 
drugs should be avoided if possible.  
 
Cyclosporine increases the caspofungin area under the concentration curve (AUC) which may result in a 
transient elevation of ALT/SGPT and AST/SGOT. Liver function tests should be closely monitored in 
patients receiving caspofungin and cyclosporine. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests should be monitored and the risk/benefit of continuing concomitant therapy should be evaluated. The manufacturer 
of caspofungin recommends that concomitant use with cyclosporine should only occur in those patients for 
whom the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. Centers comfortable with the use of tacrolimus for 
GVHD prophylaxis may consider utilizing this agent in place of cyclosporine.  For COG Supportive Care Guidelines see:

Hemodialysis  PO: 100% after each dialysis  
Avoid IV dosage form*  Per Section 4.2.3  
*Parenteral formulation of voriconazole contains the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_640650] -cyclodextrin sodium 
which accumulates in patients with renal impairment, and can worsen renal impairment. If a patient with 
renal failure cannot t ake the oral formulation of voriconazole, then voriconazole should be held until either 
the renal failure or inability to tolerate oral medications improves, at which point it may be restarted.  
 
Caspofungin:  
Adjustment of the dose is not needed in the setting of impaired renal function. Caspofungin is not dialyzable 
and supplementation is not required following hemodialysis . 
 
5.2 Impaired Liver Function  
 
Fluconazole:  
Fluconazole should be held in patients who develop signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease or 
elevations in hepatic function tests as defined by [CONTACT_640703] > [ADDRESS_857431] or serum total bilirubin 
> [ADDRESS_857432] are <  2.[ADDRESS_857433] for age and the serum total bilirubin is < 1.[ADDRESS_857434] 
for age, the fluconazole can be re -started at the calculated dose (no dose adjustment). More frequent 
monitoring (2- 3 times per week) of ALT, AST, and total bilirubin should be considered upon resumption 
of fluconazole. If the ALT, AST, or total bilirubin again become elevated past these criteria (ALT or AST 
> [ADDRESS_857435] or serum total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_857436]), then fluconazole should be discontinued (the patient will 
be removed from protocol therapy ).  
 
Voriconazole: 
Voriconazole should be held in patients who develop signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease or 
elevations in hepatic function tests as defined by [CONTACT_640703] > [ADDRESS_857437] or serum total bilirubin

Caspofungin may be restarted or increased if liver function (and Child-Pugh score) improves.  
5.3 Other Toxicities  
Fluconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin can be held (for up to a seven day window) in patients who 
develop any toxicity that the local investigator believes may be related to the drug. If the protocol agent is 
ultimately deemed to not be responsible for the toxicity, the agent can be re- started at the calculated dose.  
If the toxicity returns, then the agent should be discontinued (the patient will be removed from protocol therapy). Other systemic antifungal prophylactic agents should not be utilized during this potential toxicity 
window.

. 
 
6.1 CASPOFUNGIN (caspofungin acetate, Cancidas )   (01/25/13)  
Source and Pharmacology:   
Caspofungin acetate, a semisynthetic lipopeptide synthesized from a fermentation product of Glarea 
lozoyensis , is an echinocandin antifungal agent. It inhibits the synthesis of beta (1, 3) -D-glucan, an essential 
component of filamentous fungal cell wall that is not present in mammalian cells. Caspofungin has been 
shown to be active both in vitro and in clinical infections against most strains of the following organisms: 
Aspergillus (A) fumigatus, A flavus, A terreus, Candida (C) albicans, C glabrata, C  guilliermondii,  C 
krusei, C parapsilosis, C tropi[INVESTIGATOR_251131]. Following an intravenous infusion, the plasma concentration of 
caspofungin declines in a polyphasic manner. A short alpha -phase that occurs immediately post -infusion is 
followed by a beta -phase (half -life of 9 to 11 hours) and an additional, longer half -life phase, gamma -phase 
(half -life of 40- 50 hours). Caspofungin is extensively (about 97%) protein bound to albumin and is cleared 
mainly by [CONTACT_143116] (rather than excretion or biotransformation). Caspofungin is slowly metabolized in 
the liver via hydrolysis and N-acetylation. Following a single intravenous dose, 35% of the parent drug and 
metabolites was excreted in feces and 41% was excreted in the urine. After multiple doses of caspofungin 
50 mg/day were given in travenously to adults, the total body clearance was 10.6 ± 3.8 mL/min. When a 
dose of 50 mg/m2/day was given intravenously to children and adolescents, the total body clearance was 
12.6 ± 5.5 mL/min in adolescents (12 to 17 years of age), 6.4 ± 2.6 mL/min in children 2 to 11 years and  
3.2 ± 0.4 mL/min in children 3 to 23 months. 
 
Caspofungin is not a substrate for P- glycoprotein and is a poor substrate for, and does not inhibit or induce, 
cytochrome P -450 isoenzymes in vitro . However, co- administration of caspofungin with certain inducers 
of drug clearance and/or mixed inducer/inhibitors (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, rifampin, 
dexamethasone, and carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) may result in clinically important reductions in plasma caspofungin 
concentrations. Cycl osporine increases caspofungin area under the curve (AUC) which results in a transient 
elevation of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) and co -administration with 
tacrolimus may decrease tacrolimus AUC.

Unknown 
Frequency 
and Timing:  U.S. Food and Drug Administration's P regnancy Category: Category C. It is not known if 
caspofungin crosses the placenta in humans.  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with 
the use of caspofungin in pregnant women.  
In animal studies, caspofungin acetate has been shown to be embryotoxic. Abnormalities in rats, 
treated with caspofungin doses comparable to the human dose, included incomplete ossification 
of the skull and torso and increased incidence of cervical rib. In rabbits, incomplete ossification s 
of the talus/calcaneus were noted. In rats and rabbits caspofungin crossed the placenta and was 
evident in fetal plasma.  
Formulation and Stability:  
Caspofungin is available as a lyophilized white to off -white powder/cake as a single -use vial in two vial 
sizes (50  mg and 70 mg). Only the 50 mg vials will be provided for use in this study. Each vials contains 
an intentional overfill. The 50 mg vials con tain 54.6  mg. The 50 mg vials also contain 39 mg of sucrose 
and 26 mg of mannitol. The pH is adjusted during manufacturing with glacial acetic acid and sodium 
hydroxide. The lyophilized powder vials should be stored refrigerated at 2 ° to 8° C (36 to 46° F). 
 
Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment and Dose Modification sections of the protocol.  
 
Preparation instructions in this monograph apply only to the [COMPANY_006] [LOCATION_003] product as supplied for 
this study.  
 
Prior to reconstitution, equilibrate the refrigerated vial to room temperature. Aseptically add 10.8 mL of 
0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, Sterile Water for Injection, Bacteriostatic Water for Injection with methylparaben and propylparaben, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection with 0.9% benzyl alcohol to the 
vial. Use diluents without  benzyl alcohol for neonates and infants <  2 years of age or patients with 
hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol.  
 
The concentration of the reconstituted solution depends on the vial size and is listed in the table below:

The white to off -white cake will dissolve completely. Mix gently until a clear solution is obtained. Visual ly 
inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter or discoloration during reconstitution and prior to 
infusion. Do not use hazy, precipi[INVESTIGATOR_135162], or discolored solutions. The reconstituted solution may be stored 
for up to 1 hour at ≤ 25°C (≤ 77°F). Since caspofungin vials are for single use only; the remaining solution 
should be discarded.  
 
Dilute the appropriate volume of reconstituted caspofungin in 0.9%, 0.45% or 0.225% Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringers Injection. The final concentration should not exceed 0.5 mg/mL. The stability 
of the diluted solution for administration is 24 hours if stored at ≤ 25°C (≤ 77°F) or 48 hours if stored 
refrigerated at 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F). Since the infusion solution contains no preservatives and as with all 
parenteral drug products, aseptic technique must be used during the pr eparation of the infusion bag. 
Institution guidelines should be followed to determine the expi[INVESTIGATOR_640651]. The 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_640652] 24 hour s at ≤ 25°C (≤ 77°F) and 48 hours refrigerated.  
 Caspofungin is administered by [CONTACT_640704] 1 hour. Do not mix or co -infuse 
caspofungin with other medications, as there are no data available on the compatibility of caspofung in with 
other intravenous medications. DO NOT USE DILUENTS CONTAINING DEXTROSE since caspofungin 
is not stable in diluents containing dextrose. The infusion line should be flushed with 0.9% sodium chloride 
before and after drug administration.  
Supplier:  Caspofungin will be supplied by [CONTACT_640705] & Company, Inc., [LOCATION_003].  The University 
of Pennsylvania School of Medicine will distribute the study medication to the study sites through their Investigational Drug Service Pharmacy. Drug ordering and drug destruction information can be found on the 
study website. Drug receiving and accountability records should be maintained and performed according to 
local institutional procedures. Commercial supplies of caspofungin may be utilized in place of the study -

6.2 FLUCONAZOLE (Diflucan )     (08/12/11)  
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
Fluconazole is a triazole antifungal agent. It is structurally related to imidazole -derivative azole antifungal 
agents (e.g., clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole) however, imidazoles have 2 nitrogens in the azole 
ring (imidazole ring) and fluconazole and other tria zoles (e.g., itraconazole, terconazole) have 3 nitrogens 
in the ring (triazole ring). In addition, fluconazole contains a second triazole which makes it a bistriazole 
derivative and a halogenated phenyl ring. Replacement of the imidazole ring with a triazole ring apparently results in increased antifungal activity and an expanded antifungal spectrum of activity. Presence of the two 
triazole rings may contribute to fluconazole’s resistance to first- pass metabolism and the drug's low 
lipophilicity and protein binding. Presence of a halogenated phenyl ring increases antifungal activity and 
contributes to the aqueous solubility which make fluconazole suitable for IV formulation. 
 
 
Fluconazole is a highly selective inhibitor of the fungal cytochrome P -[ADDRESS_857443] strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: 
Candida (C) albicans, C. glabrata (Many strains are intermediately susceptible), C parapsilosis, C 
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_251131], and Cryptococcus neoformans. Candida krusei is considered to be resistant to fluconazole. 
Resistance to fluconazole may arise from a modification in the quality or quantity of the target enzyme 
(lanosterol 14 -α-demethylase), reduced access to the drug target by [CONTACT_640706],  or 
some combination of these mechanisms.  
 
The pharmacokinetics of fluconazole are similar following IV or oral administration. In healthy adults 
receiving 50 - or 100- mg doses of fluconazole given once daily by [CONTACT_12781] 30 minutes, serum 
concentrations of the drug 1 hour after dosing on the sixth or seventh day of therapy ranged from 2.14-2.81 
or 3.86- 4.96 mcg/mL, respectively. In a multiple- dose study in children 5- 15 years of age, IV administration 
of 2- , 4-, or 8- mg/kg doses of fluconazole resul ted in mean peak plasma concentrations of 5.5, 11.4, or 14.1 
mcg/mL, respectively. Fluconazole is widely distributed into body tissues and fluids following oral or IV 
administration. In adult humans with normal renal function, concentrations of the drug in urine and skin 
may be 10 times higher than concurrent plasma concentrations. Concentrations in saliva, sputum, nails, blister fluid, blister skin, and vaginal tissue
 are approximately equal to concurrent plasma concentrations.  
Fluconazole , unlike some azo le-derivative antifungal agents (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole), distributes 
readily into the CSF following oral or IV administration.  Another difference from other  azole -derivative 
antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole), is that fluconazole is only 11 -12% bound to 
plasma proteins while the other azole derivatives are highly protein bound.

The plasma elimination half -life of fluconazole in adults with normal renal function is approximately 
30 hours (range: 20- 50 hours). The mean plasm a half -life of fluconazole in children 5 to 15 years of age 
after multiple IV doses is at the range of 15 -18 hours. In healthy adults, fluconazole is eliminated mainly 
by [CONTACT_640707] 80% excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Small amounts of the 
drug are excreted in feces.  Metabolism accounts for only 11% of total drug excreted. The renal clearance 
rate in adults is 0.27 to 0.63 mL/min/kg and in children age 5 to 15 years it is 0.4 to 0.66 mL/min/kg.  
 Some azoles, including fluconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the 
electrocardiogram. Fluconazole should be administered with caution to patients with this potentially 
proarrhythmic condition. Clinically or potentially significant drug interactions between fluconazole and the 
following agents/classes have been observed: oral hypoglycemics (tolbutamide, glyburide, glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130]), 
coumarin- type anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), phenytoin, cyclosporine, rifampin, theophylline, terfenadine, 
cisapride, astemizole, rifabutin, tacrolimus, short -acting benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (more pronounced with oral 
fluconazole). Co-administration of oral fluconazole with combination contraceptives has resulted in an 
overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels. Ho wever, in some patients, levels of 
ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel decreased by [CONTACT_8622] 47% and 33%, respectively. The clinical significance 
of the above effects is currently undetermined and may simply be a product of interindividual variation in 
metab olism.

Formulation and Stability:  
Fluconazole injection is an iso -osmotic, sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of fluconazole in a sodium chloride 
or dextrose diluent. Each mL contains 2 mg of fluconazole and 9 mg of sodium chloride or 56 mg of 
dextrose. The pH ranges from 4.0 to 8.0 in the sodium chloride diluent and from 3.5 to 6.5 in the dextrose 
diluent. Injection volumes of 100 mL and 200 mL are packaged in glass or in polyvinylchloride (PVC) 
bags.  Specific storage requirements may vary among manufacturers. In general, fluconazole injection in 
glass bottles or PVC bags should be stored between 5 -30°C (41 -86°F) or between 5-25° C (41 -77°F), 
respectively. Brief exposure to 40 °C (104°F) does not adversely affect the product in the PVC container. 
Fluconazole solution should be protected from freezing. The overwrap moisture barrier should not be 
removed from the PVC bags until ready for use. The solution should not be used if it is  cloudy or 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_135162].  
Fluconazole is available as 50, 100, 150, or 200 mg tablets that may contain lactose. Fluconazole for oral 
suspension contains 350 mg or 1400 mg of fluconazole powder in bottles which may contain sucrose and 
sodium benzoate. The t ablets and dry powder of fluconazole for oral suspension should be stored between 
68-77°F (20-25°C).   
CANADIAN SITES : 
Fluconazole injection is only available as 200 mg/[ADDRESS_857444] specifications are similar. 
 
Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment and Dose Modification sections of the protocol.  
 
Injection:  
Fluconazole injection is provided as a 2 mg/mL solution in NS or D 5W that is ready to infuse without further 
dilution. To prepare the infusion, the calculated dose volume in NS or D 5W is transferred to an evacuated 
PVC infusion bag or to an evacuated glass bottle. Since fluconazole solution con tains no preservatives, and 
as with all parenteral drug products, aseptic technique must be used during the preparation of the dose. 
Institution guidelines should be followed for determining the expi[INVESTIGATOR_640651].  
 
Oral:  
To mix the oral suspension tap bottle until all the powder flows freely. To reconstitute, add 24 mL distilled 
water or Purified Water (USP) to the fluconazole 350 mg or 1400 mg powder in bottle and shake vigorously 
to suspend the powder. The concentration of the reconstituted suspension is 10 mg/mL for the 350 mg bottle 
and 40 mg/mL for the 1400  mg bottle with a total volume of 35 mL of suspension per bottle. The 
reconstituted suspension should be stored between 86°F (30°C) and 41°F (5°C). Protect from freezing. 
Disca rd unused portion 2 weeks after reconstitution. Patients should be instructed to shake the oral 
suspension well before using. Oral fluconazole should be administered with or without food at 
approximately the same time each day and can be taken at any time during the day.

6.3 VORICONIZOLE (Vfend )       (06/24/11)  
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
Voriconazole is a triazole antifungal derived from fluconazole with the aim of enhanced potency and 
spectrum of activity. Voriconazole has been studied in a variety of fungal infections and has demonstrated 
efficacy in those caused by [CONTACT_207106], Candida  sp, Cryptococcus neoformans , and Fusarium  sp.; 
conversely, voriconazole has demonstrated poor in vitro  activity against Zygomycetes and Sporothrix 
schenckii . Voriconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis by [CONTACT_237683] 14- alpha demethylase, a 
cytochrome P450 enzyme necessary for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. Inhibition of ergosterol 
synthesis results in increased cellular permeability and subsequent leakage of intracellular contents. Several 
other antifungal mechanisms have been proposed in certain yeast and filamentous fungi.  
 
The oral bioavailability of voriconazole is around 96%; peak plasma levels occur 1 to 2 hours after an oral 
dose. Steady- state concentrations are achieved within 24 hours after an oral loading dose; in the absence of 
a loading dose, 6 days of accumulation are required to reach steady state. The absorption of voriconazole is not affected by [CONTACT_640708], however, the mean Cmax and AUC are reduced by 34% and 24%, 
respectively, following a high fat meal. Voriconazole is widely distributed, with a volume of  distribution 
of 4.6 L/kg. Approximately 58% of a dose of voriconazole is bound to plasma proteins. Voriconazole 
concentrations in human CSF are between 40% and 70% of the concentrations in the plasma.  
 Voriconazole displays nonlinear pharmacokinetics due  to saturation of its metabolism in adult patients. It 
is metabolized by [CONTACT_640709] P450 enzymes 2C19, 2C9 and 3A4. Significant 
interpatient variability exists as a result of polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, resulting in varyi ng 
rates of metabolism. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19 may result in approximately 4- fold higher 
voriconazole exposure in poor metabolizers vs. extensive metabolizers. Approximately 85% of a single 
dose appears in the urine with < 2% as unchanged drug. T he elimination half -life has been reported as 6 
hours; in patients receiving prolonged therapy it may take up to 6 days to recover 90% of the drug in the 
urine and feces.  
 Children < [ADDRESS_857445] a larger volume of distribution and a faster clearan ce of voriconazole than 
adolescents and adults. A pharmacokinetic analysis in 35 children age 2 to 12 years revealed that a maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg every 12 hours resulted in a similar steady state concentration compared to 
adults receiving 3 mg/kg eve ry 12 hours. Unlike adult patients, voriconazole elimination was found to 
follow a linear model throughout the dosage range studied. The median (5th and 95th percentiles) terminal 
half- life was 7.5 (3.5 and 21.4) hours. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed in a 
retrospective evaluation of 108 voriconazole serum concentrations from 40 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_237502]. The mean oral bioavailability in the study was 75% in children < 12 years and 81% in patients  ≥ 12 years. 
Simulations of fixed ora l doses (200  mg twice daily) demonstrated a consistent increase in concentration 
by 520 ng/mL for a 1 mg/kg increase in dose; this is consistent with Michaelis- Menten kinetics. The authors 
concluded that 7 mg/kg IV every 12  hours is likely to achieve an ap propriate voriconazole trough 
concentration in the majority of pediatric patients up to 12 years of age.

Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Voriconazole was 
teratogenic in rats at doses 0.3 times the adult recommended dose and embryotoxic in rabbits at 
6 times the recommend ed adult dose. Reduced fetal weight, skeletal abnormalities, and 
embryomortality were also reported in animal models. Additionally, plasma estradiol levels were 
reduced in pregnant rats at all dose levels of voriconazole.  
 
Formulation and Stability:  
Injec tion 
Voriconazole for injection is available in a single use vial as a sterile lyophilized powder without 
preservatives equivalent to 200  mg voriconazole and 3200 mg sulfobutyl ether beta -cyclodextrin sodium 
(SBECD). The powder for injection should be stored at 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). Reconstituted solutions are stable for up to 24 hours under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). 
 
Tablets  
Voriconazole 50 mg tablets are white, film -coated, and round; voriconazole 200 mg tablets are white, film-
coated, and capsule shaped. Both tablet types are debossed with “[COMPANY_007]” on one side and either “VOR50” 
or “VOR200” on the reverse, for the 50 mg and 200 mg tablets, respectively. Tablets should be stored at 
15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). 
 
Powder for Oral Suspension 
Voriconazole for Oral Suspension is supplied in 100  mL high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with an 
accompanying 5 mL oral dispenser and press- in bottle adaptor. Each bottle contains 45 g of powder for oral 
suspension. Following reconstitution, the bottle contains 40 mg voriconazole per mL in a usable volume of 70 mL and approximately 5 mL of overfill. The powder for oral suspension should be stored at 2°C to 8°C 
(36°F to 46°F). Once reconstituted, the oral suspension should be stored at 15°C  to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).

Powder for injection  
Aseptically reconstitute one 200 mg vial with 19  mL of sterile water for injection; the use of an automated 
syringe is not recommended. The resulting product is a clear, particle- free solution in a concentration of 
10 mg/mL (20  mL total volume). This product should be further diluted with NS, LR, D 5WLR, D 5W1/2NS, 
D5W, D 5W with KCl 20 mEq, 1/2NS, or D 5WNS to a fi nal concentration of 0.5 to 5 mg/mL prior to 
administration. Do not dilute with 4.2% sodium bicarbonate infusion; slight degradation of voriconazole 
can occur.  
 
Voriconazole powder for injection does not contain preservatives. The manufacturer recommends using the 
reconstituted solution immediately. Chemical and physical in -use stability has been demonstrated for 
24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Any unused solution should be discarded. The final voriconazole solution should be infused over 1 to 2 hours at a rate not to exceed 3  mg/kg/hr.

8.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL THERAPY AND OFF STUDY 
CRITERIA 
 
8.1 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy  
 
a) Development of proven or probable IFI including IA according to the institutional diagnosis.  
b) Refusal of further protocol therapy by [CONTACT_4676]/parent/guardian. 
c) Completion of planned therapy (Day 42 or Day of Discharge).  
d) Physician determines it is in patient’ s best interest.  
e) Repeat eligibility studies are outside the parameters required for eligibility (if applicable, see Section  3.2 – only for patients that have not yet started protocol therapy).  
f) Intolerable toxicities as outlined in Section 5.2  and Section 5 .3. 
 Patients who are off protocol therapy are to be followed until they meet the criteria for Off Study (see below). 
Follow -up data (including IFI checklist) will be required unless consent was withdrawn.  
 
8.2 Off Study Criteria  
 
a) Death. 
b) Lost to follow -up. 
c) Withdrawal of consent for any further data submission. 
d) Completion of Day 100 evaluation.

from an unrelated donor or mismatched family donor. Patients will be randomized at the time of enrollment 
to receive caspofungin or an azole comparator (fluconazole or voriconazole). Each participating institution will choose the comparator based upon institution standard of care and the choice of comparator should 
remain constant for the duration of the study. Randomization will be stratified by : 1) the comparator of 
choice: fluconazole or voriconazole ; 2) Age: ≥12 years vs. < 12 years; 3) Type of transplant: Umbilical 
cord blood (UCB) donor vs. Non -UCB donor with ex vivo T -cell-depletion vs. Non- UCB donor with 
standard pharmacologic GVHD prophy laxis . Protocol -specified anti -fungal prophylaxis will start with 24 
hours of Day 0 and continue until Day +42, day of discharge, or withdrawal from study for any reason. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate whether the caspofungin arm has a lower incidence of 
proven/probable IFI than the azole arm during the first [ADDRESS_857452]. 
 
9.2 Patient Accrual and Expected Duration of Trial  
In North America, from 2006- 2008, an average of 688 patients per year were transplanted at COG centers  
that fit the eligibility criteria for this trial (CIBMTR, personal communication). Presuming constant 
numbers and a 20% participation rate, this trial would accrue about 138 patients per year and require 4.5-5 
years (including an estimated 6 months delay for IRB approvals) to complete the accrual of 560 eligible 
patients, with a maximum enrollment of 590 patients to account for up to 5% ineligible enrollments. 
Because we will allow institutions to choose the comparator (fluconazole or voriconazole), we ant icipate a 
high acceptance of this trial by [CONTACT_30572], and indeed, our survey of the COG Transplant Centers indicated that 89% of the centers who responded would enroll patients on this trial, with a survey response 
rate of 80%. 
 
 
9.3 Statistical Analysis Methods  
 
9.3.1 Study Endpoints 
 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint is the development of proven or probable IFI defined according to criteria developed 
by [CONTACT_290530]/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC /MSG) (from which time to IFI will be computed).
[ADDRESS_857453] prolonged 
inpatient stays, but in order to obtain a relatively homogenous duration of study drug administration, Day +42 was chosen as the maximal period of administration, as was done in the micafungin trial. Based on intent -to-
treat principle, the at- risk period will be the same for patients who terminated protocol prophylaxis prior to 
Day +42 (due to withdrawal or discharge) as long as data regarding IFI are available. For the primary 
endpoint, deaths that occur in the absence of proven/probable IFI will be counted as censoring events; as a 
comparison, for the exploratory endpoint of fungal -free-survival (see below), deaths without 
proven/probable IFI will be counted as events. 
  
41 
Version Date: 11/16/[ADDRESS_857454], which the data currently do not 
support undertaking.  
   
Exploratory Endpoints 
Endpoints for the exploratory objectives include: development of proven or probable IFI during the first 
[ADDRESS_857455], fungal -free-survival which is defined as time to death or 
proven/probable IFI during the first [ADDRESS_857456], and onset and severity of 
acute GVHD , and results from beta- D glucan assay for the diagnosis of IFI.  
 
9.3.2 Central Committee Review  
In order to ensure consistent and accurate application of the EORTC/MSG guidelines across all study 
patients, a Central Review Committee including Pediatric Oncologists and Pediatric Infectious Disease 
Specialists will be assembled. Through consensus meetings, committee members will review all data 
pertinent to the EORTC/MSG guidelines and determine whether a patient sustained a possible, probable or 
proven IFI during the study period. The following data for each study patient will be collected and available 
at the time of the review: pathology reports, all CT scan and MRI reports, fungal Gram stain and 
microbiology culture results, non- culture mycology testing results (i.e., Histoplasma urine antigens, 
cryptococcal CSF and serum antigens), ophthalmology exams, bronchoscopy reports, and dosing and 
duration of steroid exposures. 
 
All reviewers will be blinded  to the patient’s antifungal exposures in order to limit any bias in determining 
the prima ry and exploratory endpoints. 
 
9.3.[ADDRESS_857457] represented less than 10% of the subject population in all but one prospective trial to date.
3,14,19,20,29,54 
And every prospective trial to date has had  > 50% of their patients undergoing lower -risk forms of 
transplantation, including matched sibling donor HCTs, and even autologous HCTs in some cases. Given 
these limitations, the incidence of IFI on these trials has ranged dramatically, from as low as 2.4% at 70 days,
14 to as high as 25% at [ADDRESS_857458].20 A simple calculation achieved by [CONTACT_640710] 3 trials with 180 day endpoints demonstrates that, in patients receiving fluconazole prophylaxis, there 
is an approximately 14.5% incidence of IFI at 180 days, while in those receiving mold -active prophylaxis 
(itraconazole or voriconazole) there was an approximately 9.1% incidence of IFI at 180 days.3,19,20 If there 
was an even split between the number of patients receiving fluconazole vs. a mold -active azole, then a very 
rough estimate of the IFI incidence at 180 days would be 10.9%. Since the distribution of IFIs post -
42 
Version Date: 11/16/[ADDRESS_857459] roughly half of this, or ~6% to occur during the first 42 days.  
 
Other reports support the hypothesis that roughly half of the “early” (< [ADDRESS_857460]) IFIs occur 
within the first [ADDRESS_857461] et al.  demonstrates a cumulative incidence curve of IFI; 
while only the number at [ADDRESS_857462] occurred by [CONTACT_2006]  42.
3 
Three  retrospective reports show similar conclusions. Hovi et al.  reported that 5 of 11 (45%) IFI that were 
found in pediatric allogeneic HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_640654] -HCT occurred during the first [ADDRESS_857463].27 Dvorak et al. reported that 10 of 12 (84%) cases of IFI occurred in the first month after 
pediatric allogeneic HCT.[ADDRESS_857464] (the population in question in this trial), the number of patients with Aspergillosis or 
Candidiasis (the [ADDRESS_857465] common IFIs) was [ADDRESS_857466], 25 from Days 31 -100, and only 
5 from Days 101-365.55 Thus, in Benjamin et al. 22 of 52 (42%) t otal IFIs occurring within the first year 
post- HCT happened within the first [ADDRESS_857467] that 39 of 77 (51%) of IFIs during the first year post -HCT actually occur within the 
first 4-[ADDRESS_857468]. Eight of these (57%) occurred by [CONTACT_2006] 42, 2 between Days 43 and 100, and 4 from Days 
101 to 180 (William Steinbach, personal communication). This data provides justification of the use of one -
half of the reported Day [ADDRESS_857469] et al.  
 
However, it should be strongly stressed that these numbers were generated from trials involving a lower -
risk patient population in which <  50% of the patients underwent alternative donor HCT, which is the study 
population proposed for this trial. None of the prospective trials report whether alternative donors demonstrated a higher incidence of IFI than matched- siblings, but based on the largest available series of 
retrospective data the risk of IFI at 1 year in alternate donors is ~2% higher than seen in m atched -siblings.
56 
Benjamin et al.  report a greater difference between matched sibling donor recipi[INVESTIGATOR_640655] 16% vs. 22% (at 100 da ys),55 but we will use the more conservative 2% estimate. Once again, 
based on a bimodal distribution, we would expect approximately half of that increased IFI incidence to occur early post- transplant, thus increasin g our overall estimate to ~7%.  
 Another source of data to inform this estimate is the various retrospective studies that have been performed, 
although these have inherent biases. There have been three pediatric- specific studies, which unfortunately 
have used different end -point times and methods.
26,27,55 One study demonstrated an 8.7% incidence of IFI 
at 30 days in a m ixed- risk patient population utilizing fluconazole prophylaxis.26 Another demonstrated a 
10.9% incidence of IFI at [ADDRESS_857470] population of high- risk patients, but utilizing low -dose 
amphotericin B as prophylaxis.55 Another informative study involved a very high number (>  2500) of 
primarily adult patients undergoing transplant from alternative donors and demonstrated an approximately 
8% risk of IFI at [ADDRESS_857471].56 However, this population included ~30% non- myeloablative HCTs, 
which have a very different pattern of IFI than those undergoing myeloablative transplant57 (the study 
population for this trial), making it difficult to fully utilize this data. Another group of patients who appear 
to be at high -risk for the development of IFI post -HCT are those undergoing HCT utilizing an umbilical 
cord blood (UCB), likely due to the extended period of neutropenia commonly seen in thes e patients. A 
report by [CONTACT_640711]. demonstrated that 12.4% of their UCB HCT patients had developed an IFI by [CONTACT_2006] 
30, and 22.6% by [CONTACT_2006] 100.[ADDRESS_857472] et al.3 Finally, a report analyzed the infectious complications 
of high- risk (unrelated donor) HCTs done on the NHLBI -funded trial of ex vivo  T-cell depletion vs. standard 
cyclosporine and methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis.30 The methodology of this study did not report an 
IFI incidence at 180 days, but at the time of data censoring, 31% of patients had ultimately gone on to

develop an IFI. This highlights the elevated risk of IFI in this population of patients, and underscores the 
danger of utilizing data generated from a lower -risk population to inform an IFI estimate for this trial.  
 We determined the magnitude of absolute IFI risk reduction by [CONTACT_640712] 4% seen in the trial 
by [CONTACT_640713].
[ADDRESS_857473] period only 2 infections were due to organisms other 
than Candida and Aspergillus , (which would thus also not be covered by [CONTACT_447351]). There are several 
theories why patients receiving a mold -active agent developed breakthrough Aspergillus or Candida. One 
possible reason is the inherent variability in voriconazole pharmacokinetics (as noted above), which may 
have led to inadequate serum levels in a significant number of patients.5,[ADDRESS_857474] a similar 
problem utilizing caspofungin, which has very predictable pharmacokinetics,59 even in the setting of renal 
or hepatic insufficiency. Another possible reason is that 36% of the IFIs occurred after premature withdrawal of voriconazole.
[ADDRESS_857475] that caspofungin’s magnitude of benefit will be slightly higher than seen in trials of other 
mold -active agents.  
 Therefore, we assume that the incidence of IFI during the period at risk for the primary objective (Day 0 to Day 42) is 7% in the control patients (with fluconazole or voriconazole) and that the incidence of IFI is 2% 
with caspofungin prophylaxis, which is a clinically important decrease in the risk of IFI.  
 
Sample Size and Estimated Power 
Assuming the incidence of IFI during the period at risk for the primary objective (Day 0 to Day 42) is 7% 
in the control patients (with fluconazole or voriconazole) and t hat the incidence of IFI is 2% with 
caspofungin prophylaxis, we will require 560 randomized patients (approximately 280 per arm) to achieve 80% power at 2- sided alpha level of 0.05. The power consideration is based on a 2- sample log rank test 
comparing the  time to (first occurrence of proven/probable) IFI. Time to IFI is assumed to follow an 
exponential distribution. The observation period for the primary endpoint is from Day 0 till Day +[ADDRESS_857476] evenly during the at -risk period; for each one- third of at -risk period 
(~14 days), the incidence of IFI is 2. 3%-2.4% for patients on the azole arm and is 0.66%-0.67% for patients 
on the caspofungin arm. A 5% exponential loss -to-follow- up during the at -risk period is also included in 
the power consideration. Considering up to 5% of the enrolled patients might be deemed ineligible, the maximum enrollment number is adjusted to 590. The e xpected number of IFI among [ADDRESS_857477] descriptive statistics will be used to describe subjects’ baseline characteristics and study outcome measures overall and within each  treatment group. Summary statistics such as means, standard deviations, 
medians, and ranges will be produced for all measured variables. The balance of baseline measures across the treatment groups will be examined using appropriate two- sample tests.  
 
Analysis for Primary Objective  
For the primary endpoint, the at -risk period for IFI is from Day 0 until Day +42. Events that will shorten 
the at -risk IFI observation period (including death, withdrawal consent for data submission, or patient loss 
to follow -up) prior to Day +42 are expected to be rare. Since death (a true competing risk event) prior to 
Day +[ADDRESS_857478] survival data methods will be performed. The primary analysis will be based on the principle of intention to treat (i.e., by [CONTACT_640714], regardless of subsequent

compliance with the assigned treatment). All eligible and randomized patients with availa ble IFI data will 
be included in this analysis. A modified intention to treat analysis which only includes patients who 
complied with the randomized treatment will also be performed as an exploratory analysis to evaluate 
whether its result differs from tha t of the intention to treat analysis . Kaplan- Meier curves will be used to 
estimate the time to onset of proven/probable IFI for patients randomized to the [ADDRESS_857479] will be used to compare the incidence of IFI between the 2 randomized arms duri ng the at -risk period up to Day 
+42. The primary analyses will be performed at overall 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05, with two planned interim 
efficacy analyses (see Section 9.3.5).  Cox proportional hazards models will also be used to explore the 
treatment d ifference between the [ADDRESS_857480] will be performed comparing the incidence of proven/probable IFI between the 2 randomization arms by [CONTACT_640715] +100. For exploratory objective 2 & 3, log rank test will be used to 
compare the incidence of proven/probable IFI of patients randomized to caspofungin within the particular 
randomization stratum defined by [CONTACT_640716] (fluconazole or voriconazole) to that of patient s 
randomized to the comparator within the same stratum. For exploratory objective 4 on fungal -free-survival, 
failures for this endpoint will include death or proven/probable invasive fungal infection. Log rank test will be used to explore any treatment dif ferences between the [ADDRESS_857481]. Logistic regression models (for the binary GVHD incidence data) or proportional 
odds models (for the ordinal GVHD data by [CONTACT_640717]) will also be used to explore the treatment difference between the [ADDRESS_857482] a difference in IFI incidence 
of 7% (comparator) vs. 2% (caspofungin) will be only abo ut 51%. The power for a difference in IFI 
incidence of 7% (comparator) vs. 1% (caspofungin), 8% (comparator) vs. 2% (caspofungin), and 9% (comparator) vs. 2% (caspofungin) are 71%, 62%, and 71% respectively. These power considerations 
follow the same assum ptions as those for the primary objective. For the exploratory objective on comparing 
the incidence of IFI during the first [ADDRESS_857483] using the entire study 
population, assuming IFI incidence of 12% (with fluconazole or voriconazole) vs. 5% (caspofungin), the 
power to detect the difference is 81%. The incidence of IFI during this longer at -risk-period might be 
bimodal with the main peak during neutropenic period immediately after HCT; however due to lack of good estimate fo r such bimodal distribution, this power consideration is still based on exponential models and 
the incidence is distributed roughly evenly under these incidence assumptions. The power consideration for IFI up to Day 100 also includes a 15% exponential loss -to-follow- up. When only comparing patients 
randomized between caspofungin and one comparator (fluconazole or voriconazole), again with about half 
of the sample size (about 140 per arm), the power to detect IFI incidence during the first 100 days of 12% 
(comparator) vs. 5% (caspofungin) is only 52%. The power will be about 78% if the IFI incidence during 
the first 100 days is 14% (comparator) vs. 3% (caspofungin).

adjustment for multiple testing. If a significant difference between the 2 arms is found ( P < .05), the study

10.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA 
 
10.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
This study will utilize version 4.0 of the CTCAE of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for toxicity and 
performance reporting. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). Additionally, toxicities are 
to be reported on the appropriate data collection forms. 
 
Please note:  ‘CTCAE v4.0’ is understood to represent the most current version of CTCAE v4.0 as 
referenced on the CTEP website (i.e. v4.02 and all subsequent iterations prior to version 5.0). 
 
10.[ADDRESS_857488] : Submission & Central Review  
Institutions wil l be provided with CRA worksheets (IFI Checklist) to complete which will help to identify 
whether patients had an IFI. Biopsy and imaging reports are requested rather than report interpretation in 
order to minimize the work load for sites. An independent data review committee including infectious 
disease and oncology experts who are unaware of treatment assignments will review and classify all cases 
of proven/probable IFI by [CONTACT_152853]/MSG criteria .[ADDRESS_857489] materials will be submitted ( via the Document Imaging System:   
(626) 447- 2204) as of Day 42 and as of Day 100, only if they were performed to investigate an IFI according 
to local physician discretion:  
 
• Pathology reports (including au topsy reports), 
• CT scan and MRI reports, 
• Fungal Gram stain an d microbiology culture results,  
• Non-culture mycology testing results (i.e. Histoplasma urine antigens, cryptococcal CSF and serum 
antigens),  
• Ophthalmology exams, and 
• Bronchoscopy reports. 
 
In addition, dosing and duration of steroid exposure will be collected and entered via eRDE S. All reviewers 
will be blinded to the patient’s antifungal exposures in order to limit any bias in determining the primary 
and secondary endpoints.  
 
10.3 Acute GVHD  
The staging of acute GVHD will follow National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) guidelines 
(Appendix III).

11.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
11.1 Purpose  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to 
ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using 
similar agents.  
 
11.2 Determination of Reporting Requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) the characteristics of the adverse event 
including the grade  (severity); 2) the relationship to the study therapy  (attribution); and 3) the prior 
experience (expectedness) of the adverse event.  
  
Commercial agents  are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a commercial 
source. In some cases an agent obtained commercially may be used for indications not included in the 
package label. In addition, NCI may on some occasions distribute commercial supplies for a trial.  Even in 
these cases, the agent is still considered to be a commercial agent and the procedures described below should be followed.  
 
Determine the prior experience Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting 
from administration of the agent. An adverse event is considered unexpected,  for reporting purposes only, 
when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not  listed in:  
• the c urrent known toxicities for each commercial agent as provided in the Drug 
Information for Commercial Agents Used by [CONTACT_2005]’s Oncology Grou p posted on 
the COG website; or  
• the drug package insert. 
 
Secondary Malignancy  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (eg, treatment with 
investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A metastasis of the initial neoplasm is not 
considered a secondary malignancy.  
 All secondary malignancies that o ccur following treatment need to be reported via CTEP -AERS . Three 
options are available to describe the event:  
• Leukemia seco ndary to oncology chemotherapy 
• Myelodysplastic syndrome  
• Treatment related secondary malignancy  
 
11.[ADDRESS_857490] use CTEP- AERS (Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System), accessed via 
https://eapps-ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers  
 Commercial reporting requirements are provided in Table B. The commercial agent(s) used in this study 
are listed in the front of this protocol immediately following the Study Committee roster.  
 
• COG requires the CTE P-AERS  report to be submitted within 7 calendar  days  of learning 
of the event.  
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided during trial 
registration on all reports.

11.4 Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
Note:  The guidelines below are for routine reporting of study specific adverse events on the COG case 
report forms and do not affect the requirements for CTEP -AERS  S reporting.  
 
The NCI defines both routine and expedited AE reporting. Routine reporting is accom plished via the 
Adverse Event (AE) Case Report Form (CRF) within the study database. For this study, routine reporting will include all toxicities reported via CTEP -AERS  and all Grade 4 and higher non-hematological Adverse 
Events.  
 
 
12.0 RECORDS AND REPORTING  
 
See the Case Report Forms posted on the COG web site with each protocol under “ Data 
Collection/Specimens ”. A submission schedule is included.

clinical trial described above will compare the efficacy of an azole agent (voriconazole or fluconazole) to 
that of caspofungin. Thi s study will potentially define the appropriate antifungal prophylactic agent.  
 
Regardless of the antifungal agent ultimately chosen, prophylaxis will not prevent all IFI. In those patients with a breakthrough IFI, a modification to the antifungal regimen will be necessary. The challenge is to 
identify those patients sustaining breakthrough IFI at the earliest possible point. The recent Infectious 
Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for fever and neutropenia suggests a pre- emptive therapeutic 
approach.
[ADDRESS_857493] patients receiving antifungal prophylaxis. Knowledge of the operating characteristics of the Fungitell Assay under these study conditions 
is necessary to inform its potential future utility.  
 
13.1.2 Traditional diagnostic studies to identify patients with suspected IFI 
Traditional diagnostic moda lities for IFI are limited to radiologic imaging and blood or tissue culture 
techniques. Radiologic studies may show visceral involvement but an invasive biopsy procedure is necessary to differentiate between a fungal or non -fungal infectious process. Although blood cultures may 
be used to isolate Candida spp. during candidemia, they are not helpful in the setting of invasive candidiasis 
without fungemia. Furthermore, traditional blood cultures are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_640656]. Cultures of tissue specimens can be definitive but require invasive 
techniques for sample procurement.  
 
13.1.3 Beta-D Glucan (Fungitell) Assay  
The testing approach of this ancillary study involves the serial evaluation of a patient’s serum for the 
presence of BG. The Fungitell Assay is a commercially available kit from the Associates of Cape Cod, Inc. 
for the identification of BG, present in a vast majority of pathogenic fungi, in the serum of patients with 
IFI. This assay received FDA appro val for use in adults in May of [ADDRESS_857494] 
IFI (including IA). The operating characteristics of the assay have been elucidated in two separate adult 
cohorts and are reassuring.63,[ADDRESS_857495] included adult patients with newly diagnos ed AML or 
myelodysplastic syndrome undergoing initial induction chemotherapy and receiving fungal prophylaxis with either caspofungin or itraconazole.
64 The assay was performed in 283 patients twice a week for the 
duration of neutropenia resulting in sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for diagnosing proven or probable 
IFI of 100%, 90%, 43%, and 100%, respectively. More importantly, a positive Fungitell Assay result was

identified at a median of 10 days prior to the clinical diagnosis of IFI in this cohort. The second study 
evaluated 95 adult patients with fever and neutropenia down to 16 years of age. Thirty- eight patients with 
proven, probable or possib le IFI were identified. The resultant sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 
97.4%, 28.6%, 55.2%, and 92.3%. The specificity reported was reduced as compared to results from the 
prior publication as they included possible as well as probable and proven  cases of IFI. Positive Fungitell 
Assay results preceded clinical diagnosis of IFI by a median of 5 days.63 More recently, a m eta-analysis 
including 16 prospective and retrospective studies evaluating BG levels reported a combined sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 85%.

13.2 Specific Aims and Hypotheses  
 
Specific Aim:  To define the test characteristics of weekly Fungitell beta-D- glucan Assay testing for 
identifying IFI in pediatric HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_640657]- transplant 
neutropenic period.  
 
Hypothesis : The Fungitell beta -D-glucan As say will have a sensitivity that is >  90% for identifying IFI in 
this population of pediatric HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Alternatively stated, more than 90% of patients that ultimately are diagnosed with an IFI will have at least one positive Fungitell beta -D-glucan  Assay prior to the actual 
IFI diagnosis.

concurrently enroll patients from the parent trial with a goal of enrolling 400 patients.  
 
13.5  Sample Collection and Testing Procedures ( For Con senting Patients Only ) 
 
13.5.1  Sample:   
In order to perform the  Fungitell® beta-D- glucan Assay  5 mL of whole blood will be collected in a gold top 
serum -separator tube and labeled with the site number, COG ID number, and date (labels will be provided 
with the sample shippi[INVESTIGATOR_205970]). Although the above volume of blood testing will likely represent a s mall 
fraction of the blood testing performed on a HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_640658] 1 week, it may result in an 
important increase in certain patients (e.g., smaller children or anemic children). Therefore, we have set the 
following maximum limits per kilogram for blood draws related to this ancillary study: 3 mL of blood/kg 
body weight in an 8- week period.  
 
13.5.2  Specimen processing:  
Each specimen should be processed as follows prior to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: 
1. Allow the blood to clot for 30-60 minutes at room temper ature 
2. Centrifuge the specimen for 15 minutes at 1,000 – 1,[ADDRESS_857499] it into the provided polypropylene storage tube and label 
the tube.  
4. A total minimum volume of 1.8 mL of serum is required to run the Fungitell® beta -D-glucan Assay .  
 
13.5.3  Storing specimens: 
1. Specimens should be frozen at -70°C the day of collection after following the above processing 
steps.  
2. Specimens can be stored at -70°C until shipment. Specimens stored at -70°C may be stored 
indefinitely.  
 
13.5.4  Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_115104]:

 Testing will be performed by [CONTACT_640719]’s clinical information. Test results will 
not be made available to treating physicians since the utility of t hese tests is not yet established in 
children and because we will not be conducting testing in real time. Thus, results will not be utilized for clinical decision -making.  
 To our knowledge BG testing is not routinely performed at many pediatric centers but may be performed 
at some of the COG sites. Regardless of the number of institutions offering such BG testing, we anticipate that such testing will be ordered by a subset of treating physicians. The local BG results will not be included 
in our final analy sis of the biomarker assay’s operating characteristics. However, these results may effect a 
change from fungal prophylaxis to preemptive or empi[INVESTIGATOR_640664] a proven or probable IFI in a ny given patient. This in turn may falsely 
influence our evaluation of the Fungitell beta -D-glucan Assay’s operating characteristics. For each patient 
we will identify whether local BG testing has been performed and, via a sensitivity analysis, explore whether such a practice influences the operating characteristics. The plans for this sensitivity analysis are 
described in more detail in Section 13.9.4 below.  
The Fungitell beta-D- glucan Assay is reported in pg/ mL of patient’s serum. The manufacturer 
recom mendation for a single positive Fungitell Assay result of > 80 pg/mL will be used to define a 
positive test.  
 
 
13.6  Gold Standards for IFI Infections  
The criteria established by [CONTACT_51222]/MSG for proven or probable IFI IA will be used as the gold standard. 
These definitions have been used as the primary endpoints for prior studies validating the Fungitell beta -
D-glucan Assay.  
 
13.6.1  Methodology to Identify IFI:  
The EORTC/MSG guidelines incorporate clinical, microbiologic, histopathologic, and radiographic data for classification of proven or probable IFI. Therefore, in order to establish these diagnoses, the following 
data will be obtained on the IFI checklist (S ection 10.2): pathology reports (including autopsy reports), CT 
scan and MRI reports, fungal gram stain and microbiology culture results, non- culture mycology testing 
results (i.e. histoplasma urine antigens, cryptococcal CSF and serum antigens), ophthalmo logy exams, and 
bronchoscopy reports. An independent data review committee including infectious disease and oncology 
experts who are unaware of treatment assignments will review and classify all cases of fungal infection as 
proven, probable, or possible, a ccording to the consensus criteria of the EORTC/MSG.

13.7  Justification of Methodologic Choices 
 
13.7.1  Justification for Chosen Threshold for the Fungitell beta -D-glucan Assay:  
IFI outcomes are often devastating; thus it is desirable to optimize sensitivity at the potential expense of 
specificity. Furthermore, a highly sensitive test will likely result in few false negatives. Clinicians caring 
for patients with positive tests would then have a heightened concern for IFI while a negative test result 
woul d reassure them that no further modifications to antifungal therapy are necessary at that time. It was 
with these intentions that the following threshold value was chosen to conclude negative and positive 
results.  
 The Fungitell beta -D-glucan Assay threshold result of ≥ 80 pg/mL was chosen based on manufacturer 
recommendations and available data. For two adult studies that evaluated this test, the cut -off for a positive 
test was lowered to > 60 pg/mL.
63,64 Lowering of the manufacturer threshold in these two studies resulted 
in high sensitivity, which is consistent with the goals of our study. However, analysis of BG levels in 120 
healthy children revealed that 22% of them had BG levels greater than 60 pg/mL.66 Although this level 
would optimize sensitivity, the likelihood for false positivity is too high. There were still 15% of healthy children in this study that had a level of ≥ 80 pg/mL. This suggests that even at a level of ≥ 80 pg/mL, 
sensitivity of this assay in children would be preserved. Therefore, the manufacturer threshold of ≥ 80 pg/mL was chosen. A post hoc analysis of various cutoffs as well as assessment of sequential positive testing will be performed in an attempt to identify the most ideal cut- off for future use of this assay (please 
see statistical analysis below).  
 
13.7.[ADDRESS_857501]: 
We have chosen to use EORTC/MSG d efined proven or probable IFI as the gold standard. The ideal gold 
standard to compare the biomarker would be a positive culture of a fungal organism from blood or infected 
tissue. However, there are significant challenges to establish the presence of fung al infection based on just 
the isolation of the fungal organism itself. Certain molds such as Aspergillus do not grow routinely in blood cultures, the ability to obtain tissue for culture can be impacted by [CONTACT_640720] a visceral lesion, 
and t he clinical status of a patient may preclude invasive procedures to obtain cultures. Therefore, an 
alternate endpoint to identify all patients who truly have IFI is necessary. This issue has been addressed by 
[CONTACT_51222]/MSG. This group of experts initially created criteria based on clinical, radiographic and culture 
data to define possible, probable and proven IFI in [ADDRESS_857502] reason to be exposed to a number of these medications, infusions and/or medical interventions. Additionally, Pneum ocystis jiroveci  infection is 
also considered a cause of a “false positive” BG test. Technically this is not a true false positive as the Fungitell Assay is detecting BG from the cell wall of Pneumocystis jiroveci  as it would for other fungal 
infections. H owever, in this instance it is considered a “false positive” as the treatment of choice for this 
infection is trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole as opposed to a typi[INVESTIGATOR_900] -fungal agent. A sensitivity analysis 
(as described in Section 13.9.4 below) will be per formed to investigate the impact of these false positive 
inducing factors on the operating characteristics of the [ADDRESS_857503] clinically relevant and thus they will be focused on.

13.9  Statistical Design  
 
13.9.1  Sample Size and Estimated Event Rates:  
The parent trial comparing prophylaxis with an azole (fluconazole or voriconazole) to caspofungin in newly 
diagnosed AML patients anticipates enrollment of at least [ADDRESS_857504] pathogenic fungi (with the exception of 
Mucorales species and Cryptococci) and thus a majority of the probable or proven IFIs will be considered 
as true events.  
 It is challenging to establish an estimate of the event rate for IFI in this patient population as a prospective 
trial of anti -fungal prophylaxis in pediatric HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_640665]. There have been 
three retrospective pe diatric -specific studies that have attempted to define these event rates.
26,27,55 The 
cumulative incidence of IFI in these three studies ranged from 8 - 13%. It should be noted that these st udies 
varied in follow -up time, in the types of transplants included, in the antifungal prophylaxis utilized and in 
the definition for IFI used to define the outcome. More recently an adult randomized and double blind controlled trial compared the efficacy  of fluconazole prophylaxis to that of voriconazole in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].
3 
Within 180 days from  transplantation, 8.1% of patients on fluconazole and 4.6% of patients on voriconazole 
developed a breakthrough IFI. This patient population had almost no unrelated umbilical cord blood transplant patients making it a much lower risk group for IFI than our proposed patient population. 
 In the proposed parent trial included patients will be the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_640666] (bone marrow, 
peripheral blood stem cells, or umbilical cord blood). These HCT patients are those at high -risk for an IFI 
and thus  the anticipated incidence rate of IFI may be higher than that reported in the above referenced adult 
trial. Alternatively, the proposed trial will only follow patients for 100 days from transplantation and thus later onset IFI will not be identifiable. Co nsidering the data presented above and the proposed study 
parameters, the COG parent trial has conservatively estimated that the IFI incidence rate will be 7% (20 events) in the azole treatment arm and 2% (6 events) in the caspofungin study arm. Because this ancillary 
study plans to enroll 70% (400 patients) of the parent trial patients over a three -year period the estimated 
event rates for the azole and caspofungin arms are 14 and 4 respectively (table 3).

13.9.2  Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, and NPV:  
The validity of a biomarker is based on whether the study appropriately categorizes patients with and  
without the illness in question (sensitivity and specificity). Alternatively the validity of a test can be measured by [CONTACT_640721] (PPV and NPV). Collectively, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and  NPV are often referred to as the test’s operating 
characteristics. Each component of the operating characteristics will be calculated based first on the entire cohort. As indicated in the estimates above, the incidence of is expected to vary between the t wo study 
arms. It is well documented that variations in the incidence/prevalence of a disease will impact the operating characteristics of a diagnostic test specifically for the PPV and NPV. Therefore, each assay’s sensitivity, 
specificity, PPV and NPV wil l also be calculated separately for each study arm.  
 
The operating characteristics for the Fungitellbeta -D-glucan Assay will be computed as follows: 
• Outcome of all IFI defined as a single positive test for the Fungitell beta -D-glucan Assay as  
compared to t he EORTC/MSG criteria for all proven or probable IFI. 
 Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV and their accompanying 95% confidence intervals will be calculated using STATA statistical software version 12.0 (College Station, TX). As noted above, these parameters 
will first be calculated for the entire cohort an d then for each study arm separately. A patient with multiple 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_640667] a single IFI. As would be expected in the setting of low incidence, we anticipate that the results will show a low PPV and high NPV. This  will not be an 
indication that the assay is not useful. The intended goal of the assay is to identify all patients with IFI at 
the earliest time point. In order to identify all such patients there will need to be a tolerance for a certain 
number of false positive results. Thus in this clinical setting the sensitivity of these assays is the most 
relevant parameter assuming the number of false positive results is not excessive.  
 
13.9.3  Receiver Operator Characteristics Curve:  
In addition to understanding t he operating characteristics of a diagnostic test at a single defined threshold, 
it is also important to understand how variations in the test’s threshold can alter the test’s operating 
characteristics. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve is a useful approach to illustrate how 
these operating characteristics will change as the threshold changes. Therefore, a receiver -operating- 
characteristics (ROC) curve will be generated with a series of sensitivities and specificities derived from various cutoff values. For the Fungitell Assay cutoffs of ≥ 60, ≥ 80, ≥ 100, and ≥ 120 pg/mL will be used 
to create the ROC. The ROC curve will be displayed graphically (sensitivity vs. 1 -specificity) and evaluated 
numerically (c- statistic). The c- statistic (also referred to as the area under the curve (AUC)) varies from 0.[ADDRESS_857505]’s ability to discriminate between patients with and without the gold 
standard diagnosis.
[ADDRESS_857506]’s sensitivity while maintaining a reasonable specificity. 
The identified thresholds will be used to categorize each patient as “likely to have IFI ” and “not likely to 
have IFI ”. Once these 2 sub -groups are defined we will calculat e the incidence rates of IFI for each sub -
group and compare them. Because the anticipated incidence for IFI may be variable between the two study Table 3.  Estimated IFI and IA event rates

arms (those receiving an azole and those receiving caspofungin) this approach will have to be done at the 
level of each study arm. The incidence rates will be compared statistically using Pearson’s Chi -square 
analysis.  
 
Finally, to further explore the ideal utility and interpretation of each biomarker, serial testing results will be 
explored. For this analysis the  Fungitell beta -D-glucan Assay will be considered positive when a patient 
has [ADDRESS_857507] results ≥ 80 pg/mL. Operating characteristics and ROC curves will be constructed in 
a similar manner as discussed above.  
 
13.9.4  Sensitivity Analysis:  
Sensit ivity analyses will be explored for the reasons expressed in Section 13.7.[ADDRESS_857508] 
sensitivity analysis will attempt to identify the direction and magnitude of the bias resulting from the availability of clinical BG testing performed outside o f the ancillary study. Such testing has the potential to 
change the treating clinician’s approach for diagnosing an IFI. It is possible that these test results could result in more or less investigation (e.g. radiologic imaging) to identify an IFI, which could ultimately 
impact on the incidence of identified IFI. Therefore, in addition to calculating the operating characteristics 
for all patients enrolled, the same operating characteristics will be calculated after excluding all patients 
that had at least [ADDRESS_857509] 
the final interpretation of sensitivity and PPV for each of the assays. However, it is also possible that one 
of the factors listed in Table 2 is present in a patient that truly has an IFI. Therefore, we plan to still include all pati ents in the primary analysis for calculation of the assay’s operating characteristics. In this sensitivity 
analysis, we will eliminate all patients with a positive test that correlates in time with at least [ADDRESS_857510] for future pediatric patients being treated under 
similar circumstances. It is important to realize that the results of this study (either to support or not support 
the routine clinical use of the biomarker ) will have an important impact on the provision of future clinical 
care. If the results support the biomarker as an adjunctive diagnostic tool for identifying IFI, then clinicians 
will be better informed on the clinical application of the assay results. However, if the assay does not 
perform well in identifying IFI, then clinicians will know that this assay is not useful in this clinical scenario 
and thus will not order the test. This would result in the conservation of finite resources and redirect the 
focus of researchers to other modalities for diagnosing fungal infections.

INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY ACCL1131  
(for children from 7 through 12 years of age) 
 
A Research Study Comparing Drugs Used To Prevent Serious Fungal Infections In Children Receiving a 
Stem Cell Transplant  
 
1. We have been talking with you about your likelihood of getting Invasive Fungal Infections. 
Invasive Fungal Infections are infections which occur in people whose natural infection -
fighting ability (also called immunity) have been reduced. The strong cancer fighting drugs (called chemotherapy) and radiation used in stem cell transplants reduce your immunity and 
make you more likely to get invasive fungal infections.  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because you are at risk of invasive fungal infections. A research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people 
who are sick.  In this study, we are trying to find better ways to prevent invasive fungal 
infections in children receiving a stem cell transplant.  
 
3. Children who are part of this study will be given medicines that help prevent invasive fungal 
infections. These drugs are called antifungal agents. In this study, one group of children will get the usual antifungal  drugs called fluconazole or voriconazole. The other group will get a 
newer antifungal agent called caspofungin. Your doctor will tell you which group you are in. 
We do not know if the newer antifungal agent will be better than the usual treatment. That is 
why we are doing this study.  
 
4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good 
things are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is a better 
chance of avoiding invasive fungal infections during your stem cell transplant, but we don’t 
know for sure if there is any benefit of being part of this study. 
 
5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad 
things are called “risks.” There is a risk that you will have bad effects from the newer antifungal 
agent or that it will not be better at preventing you from getting invasive fungal infections 
during your stem cell transplant. Other things may happen to you that we don’t yet know about.  
 
6. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being in this study at any time once you start. There may be other treatments that your doctor 
can tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that you have. 
 
7. We are asking your permission to collect additional blood for some  special test s. We want to  
collect  extra blood samples to s ee if doctors can detect fungal infections as early as possible, 
and better than the usual tests used. We also want extra blood samples to look at your genes 
for an y changes that may make a person more likely to get invasive fungal infections. Samples 
for these tests would be taken when other standard blood tests are being performed, so there 
would be no extra procedures. You can still take part in this study even if you don't  allow us 
to collect the extra blood samples for research.

3. Children who are part of this study will be given medicines that help prevent invasive fungal infections. These drugs are called antifungal agents. Children and adolescents that are part of this 
study will be placed into 1 of 2 treatment groups by a process called randomization. Randomization 
means that the study treatment groups are assigned by [CONTACT_3364], and is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin, only it is done by a computer. In this study, one group of children will get one of the usual antifungal drugs, 
called fluconazole or voriconazole. The other group will get a newer antifungal agent called caspofungin. Your doctor will tell you which group you are in. We do not know if the newer

7. We are asking your permission to collect additional blood for some  special test s. We want to see if 
a new blood tests can help doctors detect fungal infections as early as possible, and better than the 
usual tests used. This new test is called beta- D glucan. We also want extra blood samples to look 
at your genes for any changes that may make an individual more likely to get invasive fungal infections. This is called single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) a nalysis. Blood  for these tests 
would be taken when other standard blood tests are being performed, so there would be no extra procedures. You can still take part in this study even if you don't allow us to collect the extra blood samples for research.

APPENDIX III: COG STEM CELL COMMITTEE CONSENSUS GUIDELI NES FOR 
ESTABLISHING ORGAN STAGE AND OVERALL GRADE OF ACUTE GRAFT VERSUS 
HOST DISEASE (GVHD)  
 
Reporting Requirements for Acute GVHD in COG Studies 
In an attempt to standardize reporting of acute GVHD, the COG Stem Cell Transplantation Committee has adopted a modification of guidelines that were originally developed at the University of Michigan.  
 
Table [ADDRESS_857516] criteria for GVHD organ staging. However, confounding clinical syndromes (such 
as non- GVHD causes of hyperbi lirubinemia) may make staging GVHD in a given organ difficult. In 
addition, timing of organ specific symptoms affects whether that symptom is more or less likely to be true GVHD. Please refer to Tables [ADDRESS_857517] Disease  
 
Table 1. Organ Staging (See tables and text below for details) 
Stage  Skin  Liver (bilirubin)  Gut (stool output/day)  
0  No GVHD rash  < 2 mg/dL  Adult: < 500 mL/day  
Child: < 10 mL/kg/day  
1  Maculopapular rash  
< 25% BSA  2-3 mg/dL  Adult: 500 -999 mL/day  
Child: 10 -19.9 mL/kg/day 
Or persistent nausea, 
vomiting, or anorexia, with 
a positive upper GI biopsy .  
2  Maculopapular rash  
25% – 50% BSA  3.1-6 mg/dL  Adult: 1000 -1500 mL/day 
Child: 20 -30 mL/kg/day  
3  Macul opapular rash  
> 50% BSA  6.1-15 mg/dL  Adult: >1500 mL/day  
Child: > 30 mL/kg/day  
4  Generalized 
erythroderma plus 
bullous formation and 
desquamation > 5% BSA  >15 mg/dL  Severe abdominal pain with 
or without ileus, or grossly bloody stool (regardless of 
stool volume).

Version Date: 11/16/15 

  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACCL1131   
For GI staging: The “adult” stool output values should be used for patients > 50 kg in weight. Use 
3 day averages for GI staging based on stool output. If stool and urine are mixed, stool output is 
presumed to be 50% of total stool/urine mix. 
 
For Stage 4 GI: the term “severe abdominal pain” will be defined as:  
(a) Pain control requiring institution of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], or an increase in on-going opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], PLUS (b) Pain that significantly impacts performance status, as determined by [CONTACT_87333].  
 
If colon or rectal biopsy is +, but stool output is < 500 mL/day (< 10 mL/kg/day), then consider as 
GI Stage 0.  
 
There is no modification of liver staging for othe r causes of hyperbilirubinemia  
 
Overall Clinical Grade (based on the highest stage obtained):     
Grade 0:  No Stage 1 -4 of any organ  
Grade I:  Stage 1 -2 skin and no liver or gut involvement  
Grade II:  Stage 3 skin, or Stage 1 liver involvement, or Stage 1 GI  
Grade III:  Stage 0 -3 skin, with Stage 2-3 liver, or Stage 2- 3 GI  
Grade IV:  Stage 4 skin, liver or GI involvement  
 
Table 2. Evaluating Liver GVHD in the Absence of Biopsy Confirmation 
 
Establishing liver GVHD with no skin or GI GVHD  
No Skin/GI GVHD  
Day 0 -35 Assume no liver GVHD unless proven by [CONTACT_175748]/GI GVHD  
Day 36-100  If NO other etiology identified, NO 
improvement with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_640675]/TPN: 
Stage as liver GVHD  If other etiology identified or 
improves with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_175693]/TPN: 
 
Do not stage as liver GVHD  
Establishing liver GVHD with skin or GI GVHD and other cause of hyperbilirubinemia  
Skin and/or GI GVHD 
present  Worsening bilirubin level (includes 
worsening just prior to onset of skin or GI tract GVHD) OR stable 
elevated bilirubin despi[INVESTIGATOR_640676]- GVHD cause of increased 
bilirubin:  
Stage as liver GVHD  Stable or improving bilirubin after 
diagnosis of ski n or GI GVHD, 
irrespective of treatment:  
 
 
Do not stage as liver GVHD 
  
Changing liver GVHD stage with other cause of hyperbilirubinemia  
Skin and GI GVHD 
stable, improving, or 
absent  Liver GVHD staging is carried forward without increase in stage until other 
disease process resolves (e.g., if TTP is diagnosed in the presence of Stage [ADDRESS_857518] despi[INVESTIGATOR_640677]. If there is no liver GVHD – Stage 0 – 
and new onset TTP, the Stage [ADDRESS_857519] until TTP is resolved).  
65 
Version Date: 11/16/15 

  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACCL1131   
Skin and/or GI GVHD 
worsening  Liver GVHD is staged according to the Glucksberg criteria. The 
elevated bili is attributed to GVHD alone . 
 
Thus, when skin or GI GVHD is worsening, there is no downgrading of 
liver GVHD staging for other causes of hyperbilirubinemia. (e.g., if TTP is 
diagnosed in the presence of Stage 2 liver GVHD and worsening skin or GI 
GVHD, the liver is staged according to the actual bilirubin level even if 
some of the rise in bilirubin is attributed to TTP). 
 
Similarly, even if there is no liver GVHD at onset of a new process, (such 
as TPN cholestasis), but skin or GI GVHD worsen during that process, then 
liver GVHD is diagnosed and staged according to the height of the 
bilirubin. 
 
There is one exception to this: the diagnosis of TTP, with high LDH and unconjugated bilirubin precludes the diagnosis and staging of new liver 
GVHD in the absence of a confirmatory liver biop sy. 
 
 
Table 3. Evaluating GI GVHD in the Absence of Biopsy Confirmation  
 
Establishing GI GVHD with new onset diarrhea and no skin or liver GVHD  
No Skin/liver GVHD

Day 100  NO other etiology of diarrhea

worsening just prior to onset of skin 
or liver GVHD) OR persistent 
diarrhea despi[INVESTIGATOR_175694]-
GVHD cause: 
Stage as GI GVHD  Improving diarrhea after the 
diagnosis of skin or liver GVHD (irrespective of treatment) OR 
persistent diarrhea without resolution of underlying non- GVHD cause: 
Do not stage as GI GVHD  
 
Differentiating Acute GVHD, Chronic GVHD, and Overlap Syndrome  
There is often confusion differentiating acute from chronic GVHD, e specially in the setting of reduced 
intensity transplants, DLI and new prophylactic treatments. The NIH Working Group recently published 
new classifications for GVHD:  
  
66 
Version Date: 11/16/[ADDRESS_857520] or DLI  Presence of Acute 
GVHD features  Presence of Chronic 
GVHD features  
Acute GVHD     
Classic acute GVHD  ≤100 d  Yes  No  
Persistent, recurrent, or 
late-onset acute GVHD  >100 d  Yes  No  
Chronic GVHD     
Classic chronic GVHD  No time limit  No  Yes  
Overlap syndrome  No time limit  Yes  Yes  
 
• Scoring of acute GVHD may need to occur past Day 100. In particular, patients should continue to 
be scored for acute GVHD when classic acute GVHD symptoms (maculopapular rash, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, profuse diarrhea - particularly if bloody and ileus) persist past Day [ADDRESS_857521] Day 100. 
• Those patients being scored as having acute GVHD should NOT have diagnostic or distinctive 
signs of chronic GVHD. 
• Patients with both acute and chronic symptoms should be diagnosed as having Overlap Syndrome and scored according to their chronic GVHD score.  
Further Explanat ion of Criteria presented in Tables 2 and 3  
Assessment of Skin GVHD   
Presence or Absence of Skin GVHD:  Skin GVHD will be considered present if a rash characteristic of 
acute GVHD develops after allogeneic marrow transplantation involving more than 25% of the body surface not clearly attributable to causes such as drug administration or infection. The extent of the body 
surface area involved can be estimated by [CONTACT_941] “Rule of Nines”. In estimating the extent of skin GVHD, the area involved is calculated for individual anatomic areas, such as the arm or leg, and then the total is 
derived from a simple summation. Areas that are non -blanching should not be considered involved 
regardless of the overlying color of the rash (red, brown, etc.). Limited distribution er ythema (with the 
exception of palms and soles) in the absence of associated rash elsewhere on the body will not be 
considered GVHD.  
 
Assessment of Liver GVHD   
Assessing for the Presence or Absence of Liver GVHD  
A. Hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin  ≥ 2.0 mg/dL) in the absence of other signs of acute GVHD in 
the skin or GI tract:  
i) Day 0 -35: If hyperbilirubinemia alone is present with no other signs of acute GVHD in other 
organ systems, acute GVHD will not be diagnosed based solel y on laboratory abnor malities. 
Acute GVHD will be diagnosed if findings on histopathology studies of liver from a biopsy or autopsy are confirmatory.  
67 
Version Date: 11/16/15 

  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACCL1131   
ii) Day 35 -100: If hyperbilirubinemia (must be conjugated bilirubin) is not improving or is 
exacerbated (especially if serum alkaline phosphatase is increased), in the absence of acute 
GVHD in other organ systems, no other etiologies are identified, and does not improve with 
discontinuation of hepatotoxic drugs, acute GVHD will be diagnosed. However, it is 
distinctly unusual to develop ascites or a coagulopathy in the early stages of acute GVHD of 
the liver alone. In the absence of histopathology studies of liver from a biopsy or autopsy specimen, ascites or a coagulopathy secondary to liver dysfunction will be considered to 
indic ate the presence of another disease process (e.g., veno -occlusive disease). 
Recommended non-invasive studies to define an etiology for hyperbilirubinemia are:  
a. Imaging of liver (CT or ultrasound)  
b. Hepatitis screen (only if ALT is elevated)  
c. PT  
d. Blood cultures  
e. Review of medication list for potentially hepatotoxic drugs  
f. Review of risk factors for viral liver infection (HSV, CMV, VZV, adenovirus, EBV, HBV, HCV)  
g. Hemolysis screen  
 
B. Pre-existing hyperbilirubinemia clearly attributed to an etiology other than acute GVHD in the 
presence of signs of acute GVHD in other organ systems.  
i) If pre -existing non- GVHD liver disease (documented clinically, by [CONTACT_640730], or by 
[CONTACT_20521]) is stable or improving at the onset of signs of ac ute GVHD in other organs, 
then acute GVHD of the liver will not be considered to be present unless proven by [CONTACT_175751].  
ii) If hyperbilirubinemia worsens several days before or at the time of onset of signs of acute GVHD 
in other organ syste ms, GVHD will be considered to be present unless histopathology studies 
of liver are available and negative on a biopsy during that time interval or autopsy results exclude GVHD.  
iii) If hyperbilirubinemia persists and is not improving after resolution of a pre- existing non- GVHD 
liver disease process (e.g. localized infection of liver, systemic sepsis, biliary tract obstruction) 
when signs of acute GVHD are present in other organ systems or no other intervening cause 
has been diagnosed, then acute GVHD will be considered to be present in the absence of a new, 
clearly identifiable cause of non -GVHD liver disease or unless a liver biopsy or autopsy 
specimen is negative.  
 
C. Prior acu te GVHD in liver with new onset of a disease process that exacerbates pre- existing or 
recently resolved hyperbilirubinemia:  
i) If an etiology other than acute GVHD is clearly identified as causing or exacerbating 
hyperbilirubinemia and acute liver GVHD has been diagnosed and has been stable, improving, or 
resolved, then the liver will not be restaged for acute GVHD until the resolution or stabilizing of 
the concurrent disease process (i.e., the liver stage prior to the onset of the new disease process will  
be carried forward until the new disease process resolves). Example: Acute GVHD of the liver and gut is diagnosed on Day 20. Treatment of acute GVHD results in falling bilirubin levels to liver 
Stage 1. Sepsis or TTP develops with transient worsening of t he hyperbilirubinemia. The liver stage 
is not increased, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a higher bilirubin level, because the cause of worsening hyperbilirubinemia 
is attributed to sepsis or TTP.  
68 
Version Date: 11/16/15 

  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACCL1131   
ii) If an etiology other than acute GVHD is clearly identified as causing or exacer bating 
hyperbilirubinemia in the presence of already worsening acute liver GVHD or GVHD of the skin 
or GI tract is simultaneously worsening, then the liver GVHD will be staged according to the actual 
bilirubin level, even though another cause of hyperbilir ubinemia is present.  
 
Assessment of GVHD of the Gastrointestinal Tract  
Assessing for the Presence or Absence of GVHD of the Gastrointestinal Tract  
A. Diarrhea (≥ 500 mL/day in adults or > 10  mL/kg in pediatric patients) in the absence of other signs 
of acute GVHD in other organ systems  
i) Day 0 -engraftment: If diarrhea alone is present without other signs of acute GVHD in other 
organ systems, acute GVHD will not be considered present. Diarrhea will be attributed to acute 
GVHD if histopathology studies o f gastrointestinal tract from a biopsy or autopsy are 
diagnostic.  
 
ii) Engraftment -Day 100: If diarrhea persists and is not improving, is exacerbated, or develops de 
novo in the absence of acute GVHD in other organ systems, histopathology studies of gut 
biopsies or from autopsy specimens are not available, and no other etiologies are clearly 
identified, acute GVHD will be considered to be the cause. A stool specimen should be 
examined to rule out infectious causes (e.g., rotavirus, adenovirus, and C. difficile toxin). It is 
recommended, if at all possible, that biopsies be obtained for diagnostic purposes.  
B. Pre-existing diarrhea clearly attributed to an etiology other th an acute GVHD in the presence of 
signs of acute GVHD in other organ systems:  
i) If pre -existing diarrhea caused by a process other than GVHD has been documented clinically 
or by [CONTACT_640731], then acute GVHD of the intestine will not be considered to be present in the absence of biopsy confirmation or autopsy report.  
ii)  If diarrhea or gastrointestinal symptoms are already present, but worsen significantly at the 
time o f onset of signs of acute GVHD in the skin or liver, GVHD will be considered present, 
unless biopsy or autopsy are negative.  
iii) If diarrhea persists after resolution of a pre -existing disease process with signs of acute GVHD 
present in other organ syste ms, GVHD will be considered present, unless biopsy or autopsy are 
negative.  
C. Prior or present acute GVHD in other organ systems with new onset of diarrhea:  
If diarrhea is clearly  attributable to an etiology other than acute GVHD (e.g., infection) and a  
history of acute GVHD exists or acute GVHD is present in other organ systems and is stable, then the gastrointestinal tract will not be evaluable for acute GVHD until the resolution or stabilizing of 
the other disease process (e.g., infection) in the absence of biopsy or autopsy confirmation.  
D. Persistent anorexia, nausea or vomiting in the absence of signs of acute GVHD in other organ 
systems:  
Persistent anorexia, nausea or vomiting in the absence of other known causes of these symptoms will be conside red Stage 1 acute GVHD if confirmed by [CONTACT_175753].  
69 
Version Date: 11/16/15 

  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACCL1131   
 
If a biopsy is not possible (e.g., secondary to thrombocytopenia) but the clinical findings are 
compatible with acute GVHD, then the patient will be treated and recorded as having acute 
GVHD.  
Staging of the Gastrointestinal Tract for the Severity of Acute GVHD  
The severity of gastrointestinal tract GVHD will be staged according to modified Glucksberg criteria. To minimize errors caused by [CONTACT_640732] -to-day variation, diarrhea volume is measured as an average 
over [ADDRESS_857522] observation. Abdominal cramps are considered significant for staging if the severity results in a 
clinical intervention (e.g., analgesia, fasting, etc.). Blood in the stools is considered significant if the blood is visible or hematochezia/melena is present and not clearly attributed to a cause other than 
GVHD (e.g. epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]/hemorrhoids).

SAMPLE RESEARCH INFORMED CONSENT/PARENTAL PERMISSION FORM –FOR 
INSTITUTIONS WITH STANDARD USE OF FLUCONAZOLE  
ACCL1131  
 
A Phase III Open- Label Trial of Caspofungin vs. Azole Prophylaxis for Patients at High -
Risk for Invasive Fungal Infections (IFI) Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell 
Transplantation (HCT)   
 
If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child who may take part in this study, permission from you is required. The assent (agreement) of your child may also be required. When we say “you” 
in this consent form, we mean you or your child; “we” means the doctors and other staff. 
 
Why am I being invited to take part in this study?  
 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are about to undergo a stem 
cell transplant (SCT). More information about SCT can be found in the COG  Family Handbook 
for Children with Cancer . Patients undergoing SCT are at risk of getting an invasive fungal 
infection.  
 
Invasive fungal infections are infections caused by [CONTACT_640734]. Treatment with high doses of chemotherapy and radiation, which are used as part of SCT, severely reduces the body’s natural infection fighting 
ability. In patients who died from infections while receiving SCT, an invasive fungal infection was 
the cause in more than half of the cases. Preventing invasive fungal infections is therefore very important for the treatment success of people receiving SCT.   
 
This study is called a clinical trial. A clinical trial is a research study involving treatment of a disease in human patients. This study is organized by [CONTACT_63779]’s Oncology Group (COG). COG is an international research group that conducts clinical trials for children with cancer. More than [ADDRESS_857529]/NCI and is the official consent 
document for this study. Institutions should use the sections of this document which ar e in bold type 
in their entirety. Editorial changes to these sections may be made as long as they do not change 
information or intent. If the local IRB insists on making deletions or more substantive modifications 
to any of the sections in bold type, they must be justified in writing by [CONTACT_439275].  
79 
Version Date: 11/16/[ADDRESS_857530] of treatment for this disease? 
 
The current standard preventive treatment for people who are at risk of invasive fungal infections 
due to SCT is the use of fungi fighting drugs (called antifungal therapy). The current standard antifungal drugs are called fluconazole and voriconazole. Fluconazole and voriconazole are part of a group of agents called azoles . The azole utilized by [CONTACT_640735].  
 
Why is this study being done?  
 Current standard antifungal therapy agents  (fluconazole and voriconazole) have been shown to 
be equally effective in preventing invasive fungal infections in people receiving a SCT; especially those caused by [CONTACT_640736]. However, previous studies have shown that they do not fully 
prevent infections caused by [CONTACT_640737] . Aspergillus is a type of 
filamentous fungi . 
 In this study, researchers want to find out if using a newer antifungal drug called caspofungin will be better than the current standard antifungal drugs at preventing invasive fungal infections when given to people receiving SCT.  
 The drug caspofungin was chosen because a drug very similar to caspofungin has been shown 
to be effective in the prevention of various fungal infections, including Candida and Aspergillus  in 
a study for adult patients. Caspofungin is an antifungal drug that has been approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for use in children as well as adults.  
 The use of caspofungin to prevent invasive fungal infections is experimental.  
 
The overall goal of this study is to:  
 
• Compar e the effects, good and/or bad, of caspofungin vs azole antifungals on 
people receiving SCT, who are at risk of getting invasive fungal infections, to find 
out which is better. In this study, you will get either caspofungin or an azole antifungal (fluconazole or voriconazole). You will not get both . 
 
What will happen on this study that is research ? 
 
Before you take part in this study, you will first get the SCT conditioning regimen (high doses of 
chemotherapy or radiation).  Taking part in this study will not change the cancer treatment plan 
you get.  
 
Treatment on this study involves antifungal drugs used to prevent invasive fungal infections. In this study you will get 1 of 2 treatment plans. The 2 treatment arms are called: 
 • Azole Antifungal Arm – Current standard treatment; patients will get therapy with 
fluconazole. The azole utilized by [CONTACT_640738].  
 
• Caspofungin Arm – Experimental treatment; patients will get therapy with caspofungin.   
 
80 
Version Date: 11/16/[ADDRESS_857531] an equal chance of being on either the 
caspofungin arm or the azole (fluconazole) arm. The randomization process is described in the COG Family Handbook for Children with Cancer.  
 
Subjects (people who agree to be part of this study) will receive their planned SCT conditioning 
regimen. Before the SCT conditioning regimen is completed, some subjects will be randomized 
to receive fluconazole while others will get caspofungin. On the day of the SCT (called Day  0) you 
will begin receiving the assigned antifungal treatment to prevent you from developi[INVESTIGATOR_640686].

developed from research done on your specimens. 
 
At the end of this consent, there are questions for you to indicate if you want to take part in these 
optional research tests.  
 
Serum Beta– D Glucan Testing - Biomarker Study  
Researchers would like to see if they can identify certain biomarkers  in the blood. Biomarkers are 
substances in the blood produced from the fungal organisms that cause invasive fungal infections. The biomarker  that will be measured in your blood is called beta- D glucan. Findings from this 
research will help researchers know more about fungal infections, as well how to diagnose and 
treat them better  in future patients . 
 If you agree, about a teaspoon of blood will be taken from you once a week while you are receiving 
antifungal treatment. This will be drawn from your central line when other routine blood tests are 
being performed.  
 
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) Analysis – Genetic Study  
Researchers would like to look for genetic changes that may put subjects at an increased risk of 
invasive fungal infections. This test is called single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. Information learned from this study may be useful in the future for identifying pat ients that are 
more likely to have invasive fungal infections.  
 If you agree, about a teaspoon of blood will be collected at 2 time points for SNP analysis. The samples will be collected prior to transplant and about 100 days  after transplant  when other 
routine blood tests are performed.

Future Studies : 
If you agree, we would like to store (bank) any leftover blood for future studies. The research that 
may be done with the samples is not designed to help you during your present treatment. It might 
help people who have cancer and other diseases in the futu re.  
 
Research on the banked specimens is very unlikely  to discover results that are important to your 
current or future health. However, if it does, COG will try to contact [CONTACT_640739]. Only the doctor will be notified and the information will not become 
part of your medical record. Your doctor will decide whether to discuss the results with you. Your 
doctor may recommend repeat testing, meeting with a genetic counselor, or no further action.  
  
 
 
What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?  
 
Treatment Risks  
You may have side effects while on this study. All people taking part in this study will be 
carefully monitored for side effects. Side effects may be mild or very serious; and you may be given care to lessen side effects. Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking 
the drug  causing the side effects, but in some cases, may last longer or never go away.  
 
The risks of the individual drug given as standard treatment are listed in Attachment #2 .  
 
Reproductive risks: Women should not become pregnant and men should not father a 
baby [CONTACT_640740](s) in this study can be bad for an unborn baby. 
If you or your partner can get pregnant, it is important for you to use birth  control or not 
have sex while on this study. Check with your study doctor about what kind of birth control 
methods to use and how long to use them. Some birth control methods might not be 
approved for use in this study. Women should not breastfeed a baby [CONTACT_56035]. 
Also check with your doctor about how long you should not breastfeed after you stop the 
study treatment(s).  
 
Risks of Study  
The use of caspofungin may cause more complications than the use of fluconazole.  
 
The caspofungin treatment that is being studied could be less effective than the current 
standard treatment with fluconazole.  
 In addition to the risks described above, there may be unknown risks, or risks that we did not anticipate, associated with being in this study.

Risks and side effects reported or expected with caspofungin include:  
 
 COMMON, SOME MAY BE SERIOUS  
In [ADDRESS_857534]:  
• Reaction during or following infusion of the drug which may cause fever, chills, rash, 
low blood pressure  
 
OCCASIONAL, SOME MAY BE SERIOUS  
In [ADDRESS_857535]:  
• Low blood pressure which may cause feeling faint  
• High blood pressure which may cause dizziness, blurred vision  
• Swelling of the body  
• Blood clot  
• Abnormal heartbeat  
• Rash, itching  
• Pain in the belly  
• Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting  
• Anemia which may require blood transfusion  
• Damage to the liver which may cause belly pain, bleeding  
• Severe blood infection  
• Headache  
• Kidney damage which may require dialysis  
• Cough  
• Damage to or fluid around the lungs which may cause shortness of breath  
• Low levels of certain salts in the body which may require you to take another medicine 
to correct the salt level  
 
RARE, AND SERIOUS  
In [ADDRESS_857536]:  
• Severe skin rash with blisters and peeling which can involve mouth and other parts of 
the body  
• Allergic reaction which may cause rash, low blood pressure, wheezing, shortness of 
breath, swelling of the face or throat  
 
Although caspofungin has the potential risks noted above, it may be better at preventing invasive 
fungal infections caused by [CONTACT_640741], but there is no proof of this 
yet. 
 
For the optional studies, the greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health 
records. We will do our best to make sure that your personal information will be kept private. The 
chance that this information will be given to someone else is very small.

Are there benefits to taking part  in the study?  
 
We hope that this study will help you personally, but we do not know if it will.   
 
Potential benefits to you could include a better chance of preventing invasive fungal infections 
during treatment with a SCT.  
 We expect that the information learned from this study will benefit other patients in the future.  
 
What other options are there?  
 
Instead of being in this study, you have these options: 
 
• Current standard therapy even if you do not take part in the study. Standard therapy is described on page 1. It is the Azole (fluconazole) Arm of this study.  
 
• Receiving no prevention against fungal infections.  
 
• Taking part in another study  
 
Please talk to your doctor about these and other options.  
 
How many people will take part in the study?  
 
The tota l number of people enrolled on this study is expected to be 590.  
 
How long is the study?  
 
Subjects in this clinical trial are expected to receive treatment on this study for up to [ADDRESS_857537]. They will 
help you stop safely.  
 
Your doctor or the study doctor may decide to take you off this study: 
• if he/she believes that it is in your best interest  
• if your disease comes back during treatment  
• if you experience side effects from the treatment that are considered too severe 
• if new information becomes available that shows that another treatment would be better for

What are the costs?  
 
Taking part in this study may lead to added costs to you or your insurance company. There are 
no plans for the study to pay for medical treatment. Please ask about any expected added costs or insurance problems. Staff will be able to assist you with this.  
 In the case of injury or illness resulting from this study, emergency medical treatment is available but will be provided at the usual charge. No funds have been set aside to compensate you in the 
event of injury. However by [CONTACT_3368], you are not giving up any legal rights to seek to 
obtain compensation for injury.  
 
You or your insurance company will be charged for continuing medical care and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
The drug company that makes  caspofungin is supplying the drug at no charge for subjects on this 
study. Therefore, if you are randomized to the caspofungin arm, you or your insurance company will not be charged for the caspofungin. The drug company does not cover the cost of getting the 
caspofun gin ready and giving it to you, so you or your insurance company may have to pay for 
this. Please direct any questions related the cost of getting caspofungin ready and giving it to you 
to _________________ [please insert contact [CONTACT_640742]].  
 Fluconazole is a standard antifungal drug and would most likely be given to you if you did not take 
part in the study. Therefore, if you are randomized to the azole antifungal arm, you or your 
insurance company will be charged for the fluconazole.

You will get a copy of this form. You may also ask for a copy of the protocol (full study plan).  
 
Specimens for optional research tests  
 
This section of the informed consent is about samples for the optional research tests ( biomarker 
and SNP studies).  
 
The choice to let us use specimens for research is up to you. No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care. You can still be a part of the main study even if you say ‘No’ to taking 
part in any of these optional research studies. 
 
There are few risks to you from the genetic research studies, either from the SNP studies 
described above or other potential genomic studies performed if  you consent to bank your 
samples for future research. The greatest risk is the release of information from your health 
records, but the tissue bank will protect your records so that your name, date of birth, and other 
identifiable information will be kept  private. The chance of these personal facts being given to 
someone else is very small. Special precautions will be taken with studies that involve genetic information about the normal cells in your body. Studies of this type will only be performed on 
samples that have a second de -identified number (instead of your name [CONTACT_640752]).  
 Researchers will only be allowed to have access to your genetic information if they sign a special 
agreement and certify that they will keep all records confidential. Those researchers will not 
receive any personal information about you such as your name, date of birth, address, or phone 
number. This type of genetic research is also protected by a recent federal law in the [LOCATION_002] called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which generally makes it 
illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate 
against you based on genetic information.  
 Some of your genetic and health information may be placed in a central database along with information from many other people. This database will be available only to those with authorized 
access. There is a risk that someone could trace the information in the controlled-access 
database back to you. Even without your name [CONTACT_39648], your genetic information is  
unique to you. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_640690], we cannot guarantee that your identity will never become known. Although your genetic information is unique to you, you do share some genetic information with your children, parents, brothers, sisters, and other blood 
relatives. Consequently, it may be possible that genetic information from them could be used to 
help identify you. Similarly, it may be possible that genetic information from you could be used to 
help identify them.  
 
The researchers believe the chance that someone will identify you is very small, but the risk may 
change in the future as people come up with new ways of tracing information.

Certificate of Confidentiality  
 
The Children's Oncology Group has received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal 
government, which will help us protect the privacy of our research subjects. The Certificate 
protects against the involuntary release of information about subjects collected during the course 
of our covered studies. The researchers involved in the studies cannot be forced to disclose the 
identity or any information collected in the study in any legal proceedings at the federal, state, or 
local level, regardless of whether they are criminal, administrative, or legislative proceedings. 
However, the subject or the researcher may choose to voluntarily disclose the protected 
information under certain circumstances. For example, if the subject or his/her guardian requests 
the release of information in writing, the Certificate does not protect against that voluntary 
disclosure. Furthermore, federal agencies may review our records under limited circumstances, 
such as a DHHS request for information for an audit or program evaluation or an FDA request 
under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act.  The Certificate of Confidentiality will not protect against 
the required reporting by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_366007], reportable 
communicable diseases, and/or possible threat of harm to self or others.

SAMPLE RESEARCH INFORMED CONSENT/PARENTAL PERMISSION FORM –FOR 
INSTITUTIONS WITH STANDARD USE OF VORICONAZOLE  
ACCL1131  
A Phase III Open- Label Trial of Caspofungin vs. Azole Prophylaxis for Patients at High -
Risk for Invasive Fungal Infections (IFI) Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell 
Transplantation (HCT)   
 
If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child who may take part in this study, permission from 
you is required. The assent (agreement) of your child may also be required. When we say “you” in this consent form, we mean you or your child; “we” means the doctors and other staff. 
 
Why am I being invited to take part in this study?  
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are about to undergo a stem cell tran splant (SCT). More information about SCT can be found in the COG  Family Handbook 
for Children with Cancer . Patients undergoing SCT are at risk of getting an invasive fungal 
infection.  
 
Invasive fungal infections are infections caused by [CONTACT_640734]. Treatment with high doses of chemotherapy and radiation, which are used as part of SCT, severely reduces the body’s natural infection fighting 
ability. In patients who died from infections while receiving SCT, an invasive fungal infection was 
the cause in more than half of the cases. Preventing invasive fungal infections is therefore very important for the treatment success of people receiving SCT.   
 
This study is called a clinical trial. A clinical trial is a research study involving treatment of a 
disease in human patients. This study is organized by [CONTACT_63779]’s Oncology Group (COG). COG is an international research group that conducts clinical trials for  children with cancer. More than 
[ADDRESS_857545]/NCI and is the official consent 
document for this study. Institutions should use the sections of this document which are in bold type 
in their entirety. Editorial changes to these sections may b e made as long as they do not change 
information or intent. If the local IRB insists on making deletions or more substantive modifications to any of the sections in bold type, they must be justified in writing by [CONTACT_640743].  
94 
Version Date: 11/16/[ADDRESS_857546] of treatment for this disease? 
The current standard preventive treatment for people who are at risk of invasive fungal infections 
due to SCT is the use of fungi fighting drugs (called antifungal therapy). The current standard antifungal drugs are called fluconazole and voriconazole. Fluconazole and voriconazole are part of a group of agents called azoles . The azole utilized by [CONTACT_640744].  
 
Why is this study being done?  
Current standard antifungal therapy agents (fluconazole and voriconazole) have been shown to be equally effective in preventing invasive fungal infections in people receiving a SCT; especially those caused by [CONTACT_640736]. However, previous studies have shown that they do not fully 
prevent infections caused by [CONTACT_640737]. Aspergillus is a type of 
filamentous fungi.  
 In this study, researchers want to find out if using a newer antifungal drug called caspofungin will be better than the current standard antifungal drugs at preventing invasive fungal infections when given to people receiving SCT.  
 The drug caspofungin was chosen because a drug very similar to caspofungin has been shown 
to be effective in the prevention of various fungal infections, including Candida and Aspergillus  in 
a study for adult patients. Caspofungin is an antifungal drug that has been approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for use in children as well as adults.  
 
The use of caspofungin to prevent invasive fungal infections is experimental.  
 
The overall goal of this study is to:  
 
• Compare the effects, good and/or bad, of caspofungin vs azole antifungals on 
people receiving SCT, who are at risk of getting invasive fungal infections, to find 
out which is better. In this study, you will get either caspofungin or an azole antifungal (fluconazole or voriconazole). You will not get both . 
 
What will happen on this study that is research ? 
Before you take part in this study, you will first get the SCT conditioning regimen (high doses of 
chemotherapy or radiation).  Taking part in this study will not c hange the cancer treatment plan 
you get.  
 
Treatment on this study involves antifungal drugs used to prevent invasive fungal infections. In this study you will get 1 of 2 treatment plans. The 2 treatment arms are called: 
 • Azole Antifungal Arm – Current standard treatment; patients will get therapy with 
voriconazole. The azole utilized by [CONTACT_640745].  
 
• Caspofungin Arm – Experimental treatment; patients will get therapy with caspofungin.   
95 
Version Date: 11/16/[ADDRESS_857547] an equal chance of being on either the 
caspofungin arm or the azole (voriconazole) arm. The randomization process is described in the COG Family Handbook for Children with Cancer.  
 
Subjects (people who agree to be part of this study) will receive their planned SCT conditioning 
regimen. Before the SCT conditioning regimen is completed, some subjects will be randomized 
to receive voriconazole while others will get caspofungin. On the day of the SCT (called Day  0) 
you will begin receiving the assigned antifungal treatment to prevent you from developi[INVESTIGATOR_640691].

developed from research done on your specimens. 
 
At the end of this consent, there are questions for you to indicate if you want to take part in these 
optional research tests.  
 
Serum Beta– D Glucan Testing - Biomarker Study  
Researchers would like to see if they can identify certain biomarkers  in the blood. Biomarkers are 
substances in the blood produced from the fungal organisms that cause invasive fungal infections. The biomarker that will be measured in your blood is called beta- D glucan. Findings from this 
research will help researchers know more about fungal infections, as well how to diagnose and 
treat them better  in future patients . 
 If you agree, about a teaspoon of blood will be taken from you once a week while you are receiving 
antifungal treatment. This will be drawn from your central  line when other routine blood tests are 
being performed.  
 
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) Analysis – Genetic Study  
Researchers would like to look for genetic changes that may put subjects at an increased risk of 
invasive fungal infections. This test  is called single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. 
Information learned from this study may be useful in the future for identifying patients that are more likely to have invasive fungal infections.  
 If you agree, about a teaspoon of blood will be collected at 2 time points for SNP analysis. The samples will be collected prior to transplant and about 100 days after transplant  when other 
routine blood tests are performed.

Future Studies : 
If you agree, we would like to store (bank) any leftover blood for future studies. The research that 
may be done with the samples is not designed to help you during your present treatment. It might 
help people who have cancer and other diseases in the future.  
 
Research on the banked specimens is very unlikely  to discover results that are important to your 
current or future health. However, if it does, COG will try to contact [CONTACT_640746]. Only the doctor will be notified and the information will not become 
part of your medical record. Your doctor will decide whether to discuss the results with you. Your 
doctor may recommend repeat testing, meeting with a genetic counselor, or no further action.  
 
 
What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?  
Treatment Risks  
You may have side effects while on this study. All people taking part in this study will be 
carefully monitored for side effects. Side effects may be mild or very serious; and you may be given care to lessen side effects. Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking the drug  causing the side effects, but in some cases, may last longer or never go away.  
 
The risks of the individual drug given as standard treatment are listed in Attachment #2 .  
 
Reproductive risks: Women should not become pregnant and men should not father a 
baby [CONTACT_640740](s) in this study can be bad for an unborn baby. 
If you or your partner can get pregnant, it is important for you to use birth control  or not 
have sex while on this study. Check with your study doctor about what kind of birth control 
methods to use and how long to use them. Some birth control methods might not be 
approved for use in this study. Women should not breastfeed a baby [CONTACT_640747]. 
Also check with your doctor about how long you should not breastfeed after you stop the study treatment(s).  
 
Risks of Study  
The use of caspofungin may cause more complications than the use of voriconazole.  
 
The caspofungin treatment that is being studied could be less effective than the current 
standard treatment with voriconazole.  
 
In addition to the risks described above, there may be unknown risks, or risks that we did 
not anticipate, associated with being in this study.

medicine to correct the salt level  
 
RARE, AND SERIOUS  
In [ADDRESS_857552]:  
• Severe skin rash with blisters and peeling which can involve mouth and other 
parts of the body  
• Allergic reaction which may cause rash, low blood pressure, wheezing, shortness 
of breath, swelling of the face or throat  
 
Although caspofungin has the potential risks noted above, it may be better at preventing invasive 
fungal infections caused by [CONTACT_640748], but there is no proof of this 
yet. 
 
For the optional studies, the greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health 
records. We will do our best to make sure that your personal information will be kept private. The chance that this information will be given to someone else is very small.  
 
Are there benefits to taking part in the study?  
We hope that this study will help you personally, but we do not know if it will.   
 
Potential benefits to you could include a better chance of preventing invasive fungal infections 
during treatment with a SCT.  
We expect that the information learned from this study will benefit other patients in the future.

What are the costs?  
Taking part in this study may lead to added costs to you or your insurance company. There 
are no plans for the study to pay for medical treatment. Please ask about any expected added 
costs or insurance problems. Staff will be able to assist you with this.  
 
In the case of injury or illness resulting from this study, emergency medical treatment is available 
but will be provided at the usual charge. No funds have been set aside to compensate you in the 
event of injury. However by [CONTACT_3368], you are not giving up any legal rights to seek to 
obtain compensation for injury.  
 
You or your insurance company will be charged for continuing medical care and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 The d rug company that makes  caspofungin is supplying the drug at no charge for subjects on this 
study. Therefore, if you are randomized to the caspofungin arm, you or your insurance company 
will not be charged for the caspofungin. The drug company does not cover the cost of getting the 
caspofungin  ready and giving it to you, so you or your insurance company may have to pay for 
this. Please direct any questions related the cost of getting caspofungin ready and giving it to you 
to _________________ [please insert contact [CONTACT_640742]].  
 Voriconazole is a standard antifungal drug and would most likely be given to you if you did not 
take part in the study. Therefore, if you are randomized to the azole antifungal arm, you or your 
insurance company will be charged for the voriconazole.

Specimens for optional research tests  
This section of the informed consent is about samples for the optional research tests ( biomarker 
and SNP s tudies).  
 
The choice to let us use specimens for research is up to you. No matter what you decide to do, it 
will not affect your care. You can still be a part of the main study even if you say ‘No’ to taking 
part in any of these optional research studies.  
 
There are few risks to you from the genetic research studies , either from the SNP studies 
described above or other potential genomic studies performed if you consent to bank your 
samples for future research.  The greatest risk is the release of information from your health 
records, but the tissue bank will protect your records so that your name, date of birth, and other identifi able information will be kept private. The chance of these personal facts being given to 
someone else is very small. Special precautions will be taken with studies that involve genetic 
information about the normal cells in your body. Studies of this type will only be performed on 
samples that have a second de -identified number (instead of your name [CONTACT_640752]).  
 
Resear chers will only be allowed to have access to your genetic information if they sign a special 
agreement and certify that they will keep all records confidential. Those researchers will not 
receive any personal information about you such as your name, date of birth, address, or phone 
number. This type of genetic research is also protected by a recent federal law in the United 
States called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which generally makes it 
illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate 
against you based on genetic information.  
 
Some of your genetic and health information may be placed in a central database along with 
information from many other people. This database will be available only to those with authorized 
access. There is a risk that someone could trace the information in the controlled-access 
database back to you. Even without your name [CONTACT_39648], your  genetic information is 
unique to you. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_640690], we cannot guarantee that 
your identity will never become known. Although your genetic information is unique to you, you 
do share some genetic information with your children, parents, brothers, sisters, and other blood 
relative s. Consequently, it may be possible that genetic information from them could be used to 
help identify you. Similarly, it may be possible that genetic information from you could be used to 
help identify them.  
 The researchers believe the chance that someon e will identify you is very small, but the risk may 
change in the future as people come up with new ways of tracing information.  
 If you decide now that your specimens can be used for research and banking you can change 
your mind at any time. Just contact [CONTACT_585790]. Then, any specimens that we have will be destroyed.  
 If you want to learn more about tissue research with banked specimens, the NCI website has an 
information sheet called "Providing Your Tissue For Research: What You Need To Know.” This 
sheet can be found at: http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/resources/providingtissue

Treatment and Procedures Common to all Patients at Risk of IFI  
 
Method for Giving Drugs 
• IV - Drug is given using a needle or tubing inserted into a vein. Drugs can be given rapi[INVESTIGATOR_36670] a few minutes (“push”) or slowly over minutes or hours (“infusion”).  
• PO- Drug is given by [CONTACT_238085].  
 
Central Line  
Your doctor may recommend that you get a special kind of IV called a “central line.” This is a kind 
of IV placed into a big vein in your chest that can stay in for a long time. The risks associated with 
central lines will be explained to you and all of your questions will be answered. If you are to have 
a central line inserted, you will be given a separate informed consent document to read and sign for this procedure. A description of the types of central lines is in the COG Family Handbook for 
Children with Cancer.

Certificate of Confidentiality  
 
 
The Children's Oncology Group has received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal 
government, which will help us protect the privacy of our research subjects. The Certificate 
protects against the involuntary release of information about subjects collected during the course 
of our covered studies. The researchers involved in the studies cannot be forced to disclose the 
identity or any information collected in the study in any legal proceedings at the federal, state, or 
local level, regardless of whether they are criminal, administrative, or legislative proceedings. 
However, the subject or the researcher may choose to voluntarily disclose the protected 
information under certain circumstances. For example, if the subject or his/her guardian requests 
the release of informati on in writing, the Certificate does not protect against that voluntary 
disclosure. Furthermore, federal agencies may review our records under limited circumstances, 
such as a DHHS request for information for an audit or program evaluation or an FDA request  
under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act.  The Certificate of Confidentiality will not protect against 
the required reporting by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_366007], reportable 
communicable diseases, and/or possible threat of harm to self or others.

subsidiary of [COMPANY_005] Pharmaceutical Company LimitedCompound:
TAK -079
Title of Protocol: A Phase 1/2a ,Open -label, 
Dose -Escalation Study to Investigate the Safety and 
Tolerability, Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics, and 
Immunogenicity of TAK -079 A dministered Subcutaneously 
as a Single Agent in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory 
Multiple Myeloma 
Study Number: TAK -079-1501 Phase: 1/2a
Study Design:
This is a multicenter, open -label, dose-escalation, single -arm, phase 1/2a study designed to determine the safety and 
tolerability of TAK -079 monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) multiple myeloma ( MM), and to 
provide a preliminary assessment of its activity against r/r MM. 
Once enrolle d into the study, patients will receive TAK -079 via subcutaneous ( SC)administration in each 28 -day 
cycle of treatment , administered as once weekly for 8 weeks (8 doses), once ever y 2 weeks for 16 weeks (8 doses), and 
once ever y 4 weeks thereafter until di sease progression (PD) . Patients willreceive ongoing treatment with TAK -079 
until PD , unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal due to other reasons. 
The phase 1 portion of the study will evaluate administration of TAK -079 for dose -limiting toxicit y(DLT) t o 
determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD ) or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for further assessment in 
phase 2a. A recommended dose below the MTD may be identified based on the review of safety , pharmacokinetic 
(PK) , ,and clinical data from the phase 1 portion of the study . 
The safety and tolerability of TAK -079 will be assessed by [CONTACT_618512] -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs), dose modifications, treatment discontinuations, vital signs , physi cal examination s, serum chemistry 
and hematology, urinalys is, electrocardiogra ms, and concomitant medications. In phase 1, approximately 5 doses of 
TAK 079 will be evaluated in ascending cohorts of 3 to 6 patients per cohort. Cohorts may be expanded by [CONTACT_618513]2D. 
It is expected that approximately 39 patients will be enrolled in the study. The estimated duration of the study is 
approximately 48 months (ie, 4 years).
Primary Objectives:
Phase 1
Todetermine the safety ,tolerability , and the MTD/RP2D of TAK -079 monotherapy in patients with r/r MM.
Phase 2a
To provide a preliminary evaluation of the clinical activity of TAK -079 monotherapy in patients with r/r MM.
Secondary Objectives:
Phase 1
To investigate a potential MTD/RP2D of TAK -079.
To evaluate the immunogenicity of TAK -079.
To characterize the PK of TAK -079.
To provide a preliminary evaluation of the clinical activity of TAK -079.
Phase 2a
To further evaluate safety at the MTD/ RP2D.
To fur ther evaluate the immunogenicity of TAK -079.
To further characterize the PK of TAK -079.

Protocol 12 October 2017
For each dose level, the posterior probability of having DLT rates that fall into the following intervals will be 
estimated:
[0, 0.16): un derdosing.
[0.16, 0.33): target toxicity.
[0.33, 1.00]: excessive toxicity.
The selection of the next recommended dose will be determined from BLRM, along with consideration of other safety, 
clinical, PK,  data. Dose -escalatio n cohorts may  be expanded to include additional patients to 
obtain a more comprehensive assessment of disease response befor e the phase 2a portion of this study is opened to 
enrollment. Approximately 5 dose levels are planned. For phase 1, the number of patients is planned to be 
approximately 21. 
In phase 2a, approximately 18 additio nal patients will be treated to provide a pr eliminary estimate of the ORR in 
patients with r/r MM. All patients with MM must show clear evidence of PD with anti-CD38 therapy. 
Phase 2a of the study will also provide a more robust estimate of the safety profile at the MTD/RP2D.
No prospective calcula tions of statistical power have been made; however, the following table shows the width 
of the 80% CI, based on the observed ORR in a cohort size of 18 patients, for a range of observed response 
rates. An observed ORR greater than 20% would be of interest in this r/r population.

[IP_ADDRESS] Severe Cytokine Rele ase Syndrome 
Severe cytokine release syndrome (SCRS) is characterized by [CONTACT_4140], often acco mpanied 
by [CONTACT_4141], in addit ion to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria, and angioedema. This 
syndro me may be associ ated wi th som e features of tumor lysis syndrom e such as hyperuricemia, 
hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, acute renal failure, and elevated lactate 
dehydrogenase, and may  be associ ated wi th acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_618462]. The acute 
respi [INVESTIGATOR_33078] m ay be accom panied by [CONTACT_618516] a, visible on a chest x -ray. The syndrom e frequent ly manifests wi thin [ADDRESS_821703] dosing interrupted immediately and should receive 
aggressive symptomat ic treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematologic Effects
Reducti ons in platel ets, lymphocy tes, and RBCs occurred in nonclinical studies in some animals 
administered doses of TAK -079 higher than the NOAEL. Subjects in clinical studies of TAK -079 
shoul d be m onitored cl osely, including testing of hematology  parameters. 
The important potential risk of these hematologic changes will be m onitored throughout this 
clinical study , as described in Section 9.4.13 and Appendix A .
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Infections
In a GLP -compliant 13 -week toxico logy study , bacteri al and/or vi ralinfection secondary  to 
immune suppression was observed in cyno molgus mo nkeys at IV doses of 3, 30, and 80 mg/kg 
administered once every  2 weeks. The NOAEL dose of 0.3 mg/kg, administered IV once every  
week, was not associated with infect ions.
Subjects wil l be monitored for any  signs and symptom s of the important potential risk of serious 
infect ions throughout this clinical study  (see Sect ion 8.8.3).
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug Interactions
Nonclinical drug interaction studies have not been conducted with TAK -079. However, as a fully 
human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), the risk of drug-drug i nteracti ons is l ow.
[IP_ADDRESS] ADA Interactions
ADA responses were detected in most monkeys in the single -dose PK stud iesand the 4 -week
(non-GLP) and 13 -week (GLP) toxicologystudies. Strong posit ive ADA responses were generally 
associ ated wi th lower serum  concentrati ons of  TAK -079, and this was especially notable in the 
13-week repeat -dose toxi city studi esand at lower doses .

4.4 Rationale for the Proposed Study
Although mult iple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_618463] , thisdisease remain sincurable ; 
thus, significant unmet medical need exists for this patient population . Frequent relapses highlight 
a need for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_78937] m prior treatm ents have failed . 
TAK -[ADDRESS_821710] epi[INVESTIGATOR_265166]38 and possesses a different bind ing profile than 
the approved cy tolytic anti -CD38 therapeuti c ant ibody  daratum umab . Unlike daratum umab, 
TAK -079 does not bind to RBCs and platel ets. Therefore , TAK -079 may possess higher 
tumoricidal  activity than daratum umab because cy tolytic effector acti vity is focused on CD38+ 
leukocy tes/tum ors and is not misdirected to RBCs and platelets. Consequent ly,TAK -079 m ay 
demonstrate higher potency ( ie,activit y at lower doses a nd exposures) and activit y in

daratum umab -refractory  tumors (i e, tum ors expressing lower levels o f CD38) and thus be more 
efficient at eliminat ing tum ors.
In the FIH study  (TAK -079_101) , TAK -[ADDRESS_821711] s (ie, cytolysis 
of NK cel ls and PBs) following single -dose administration, with no unexpected and unwanted 
clinical or hematologic effects observed.
In summary , it is feasible to invest igate administration of TAK -079 in pat ients with relapsed or 
refractory  (r/r) MM.
4.4.1 Rationale for the Starting Dose of TAK -
079
In the FIH study  (TAK -079_101) , TAK -079 was well tolerated after SC administration o f 
single- doses ranging fro m 0.03 to 0.6 m g/kg.
To avoi d unnecessary  exposure of patients to sub -therapeut ic doses while preserving safet y, the
starting dose for this study  in pati ents wi th r/r MM will be 45 mg, the fixed -dose equivalent of 
0.6mg/kg (assuming a body weight of 75 kg), which was the highest SC dose administered in 
Study TAK -079_101. The 0.6 m g/kg dose was well tolerated in healthy human subjects in 
Study TAK -

expressed on plasma cells, PBs, and NK cells, and is induced on activated T cells and B cells [7]. 
Therefore , the ant icipated eliminat ion routes for TAK -079 are via proteoly tic catabo lism and 
intracellular degradation after binding to its target. Both of these c learance m echanisms are not 
thought to be significant ly influenced by [CONTACT_18559]. Addit ionally , the distribut ion volume of 
mAbs is generally  limited to the vol ume of the bl ood and extracellular fluids, such that body  
composition is a l ess important determ inant of di stributi on vol ume as com pared withsmall  
molecule drugs [

effect on the disposit ion of TAK -079, thereby  [CONTACT_618517] -dose 
administration.
The 45 m g starting dose of TAK -
079 willbe tested in 3 patients with r/rMM to assess the safet y 
and tol erabilit y of TAK -079 after multiple dose administration. TAK -079 will be administered 
using the same dosing schedule as the ant i-CD38 ant ibody , daratum umab, which is appro ved for 
the treatment of patients with MM [5].Specifically, TAK -079 will be administered once weekly 
for 8 weeks (8 doses ), once every  2 weeks for 16 weeks ( 8 doses ), 
then once every  4 weeks until 
the pati ent experi ences disease progression ( PD), unacceptable toxicit ies, or wi thdrawal  due to 
other r easons .The subsequent planned dose levels are 135, 400, 1200, and [ADDRESS_821713] cy cle of the

6.0 STUDY DESIGN
6.1 Overview of Study Design
This is a mult icenter, dose-escalat ion, open -label, single -arm, phase 1/2a study  designed to 
determine the safet y, tolerabili ty, efficacy, PK, and immunogenicit y of TAK -079 monotherapy  in 
patients wi th r/rMM, and to provide a preliminary assessment of its activit y against MM.
The phase 1 portion o f the study will evaluate administration of TAK -079 for DLT (s)to determine 
the MTD /RP2D for further assessment in phase 2a. A recommended dose below the MTD may be 
ident ified based on safety, clinical, PK,  data. The safet y and tol erabilit y of 
TAK -079 will be assessed by  [CONTACT_618520], dose m odificat ions, treatment 
discontinuat ions, vital signs, physical examinat ions, serum  chemistry  and hematol ogy analyses , 
urinalyses, ECGs , and review of conco mitant m edicati ons.
Thepreliminary  efficacy  of TAK -079 will be evaluated by  [CONTACT_618521] , defined as the 
proporti on of  patients who achieved a PR or better during study, as defined by [CONTACT_42294]
(Appendix E;
 [9,10 ]). Inaddition, the efficacy of TAK -079 will be assessed by [CONTACT_618522] , 
DOR , and OS ; TTR will also be measured.
Once enrolled into the study, patients will receive TAK -079 via SC administration in each 28 -day 
cycle of  treatm ent, administered as once weekly for 8 weeks (8 doses), once every 2 weeks for 
16weeks (8 doses), and once every  [ADDRESS_821715] of the fo llowing phases/periods: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up:

Treatment period (visit 2/ongoing): Once -weekly  treatm ent for 8 doses (Cy cles 1 and 2), 
starting on Day 1, fo llowed by [CONTACT_618523] 2 weeks for 8 doses (Cycles 3 -6), followed 
by [CONTACT_618524]  4 weeks thereafter (Cy cle 7 and bey ond), continuing unt il patients 
experience PD, unacceptable toxicit ies, or wi thdrawal  due to other reasons. 
Follow-up Peri od (f ollow-up visit): Patients who discontinue for PD will be fo llowed for [ADDRESS_821716] dose of study  drug or until the start of subsequent alternat ive anticancer 
therapy  to m onitor saf ety/AEs. Patients who discont inue treatment for reasons other than PD 
will continue to be fo llowed for PFS every [ADDRESS_821717] dose 
(last pati ent, l ast dose [LPLD]) .All pat ients will be fo llowed for OS every [ADDRESS_821718] after review of the available safet y, efficacy ,

Table 8.a Dose Modification Recommendations for TAK -079 Toxicitie s
Criteria Action
Grade 1 AEs No dose reductions or interruptions.
Grade 2 AEs Treat according to local practice. Whether to hold treatment or to continue it 
at the same or a reduced dose is at the discretion of the investigator.
Patients experiencing Grade 2 AEs considered related to study treatment that 
are not easily manage d or corrected and are not tolerable to the patient, or 
AEs that are not acceptable in the investigator’s judgment, should have study 
treatment interrupted until the AE resolves to Grade ≤1 or baseline ,then 
restarted at the same dose or, depending on the toxicity, at the previous safe 
dose level or below.
Grade 3 AEs Hold TAK -079until resolution to Grade ≤1 or baseline , then resume 
treatment at either the same dose or a reduced dose level at the discretion of 
the investigator.
Grade 4 (life -threatening) AEs Consider permanently withdrawing the patient from the study, except when 
the investigator determines that the patient is receiving clinical benefit and 
has discussed this with the sponsor. Treatment may be restarted at a reduced 
dose level or below wh en toxicity recovers to Grade ≤1 or baseline.
AEs of all grades If treatment has been held for >14 consecutive days without resolution of the 
toxicity (to baseline or Grade ≤1), consider permanently discontinuing study 
treatment unless there is clinical b enefit for the patient as assessed by [CONTACT_158176]’s approval. Treatment can be resumed at a 
reduced dose level after resolution of AEs to Grade ≤1 or baseline.

Modification)
TAK -[ADDRESS_821750] igator considers that re -treatm ent of  the pati ent coul d be dangerous. For 
Grade 4 (life-threatening) TEAEs, consider permanent ly withdrawing the pati ent from the study ,

TAK -[ADDRESS_821751] igator determines that the patient is receiving c linical  benefi t, there are 
opportunit iesto provi de supportive care to mit igate risk for the Grade 4 event to reoccur, and this 
approach (ie, the specific situa tion and mi tigation plan) has been discussed with the sponsor. In 
these circumstances, treatment may be restarted at the previously safe dose level or below when 
toxicity recovers to Grade ≤1 or baseline.
If the next cycle of TAK -079 is delayed for >14 days because of TAK -079–rel ated toxi cities, then 
the pati ent shou ld have study  treatment di scont inued unless the invest igator considers that the 
patient will receive benefit from continuing in the study. If treatment discont inuat ion occurs, the 
end of treatment (EOT)/early terminat ion visit should be co mpleted and the f ollow

10.1.[ADDRESS_821785]; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship wit h this 
treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnorma l 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal 
(invest igational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any 
newly occurring event, or a previous condit ion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the 
administration of study  drug.
An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuat ion or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervent ion, or is considered 
by[CONTACT_564797] a clinically significant change from baseline.
10.1.[ADDRESS_821786] medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death.
Is life -threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the time o f the 
event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe).
Requi res inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_4071] (see

development of drug dependency or drug abuse; any organism, virus, or infectious particle 
(eg,prion protein transmitt ing transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or 
nonpathogenic, is considered an infect ious agent.
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any lab abnormalit y, will be determined using the 
NCI CTCAE, Versi on 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010 [12].Clarification should be made 
between an SAE and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms 
serious and severe are notsynonymous. The general te rm severe is often used to describe the 
intensity (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may  be of  relatively minor 
medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is notthe same as serious , which is based 
on pati ent/event outc ome or acti on cri teria described above, and usually associated with events 
that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to functi on. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not 
necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, a white blood cell count o f 1000/mm3to 
<
2000 mm3is considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not 
intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory  reporting obligations.
10.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_53341]/or in response to an open question fro m study  
personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examinat ion, or other diagnostic procedures will be 
recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section 10.3 for the period of observat ion). Any 
clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an 
AE. Wh en possible, signs and symptoms indicating a commo n underlying patho logy shoul d be 
noted as 1 comprehensive event.

15.2 Patient Information, Informed Consent, and Patien t Authorization
Written consent documents will embody  the elements of informed consent as described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. The ICF, patientauthori zation form (if applicable), and patient
inform ation sheet (if applicable) describe the planned and permitted uses, transfers, and 
disclosures of the patient ’s personal and personal health informat ion for purposes of conducting 
the study. The ICF and the patientinformat ion sheet (if applicable) further explain the nature of the 
study , its obj ectives, and potential risks and benefit s, as well as the date informed consent are 
given. The ICF will detail the requirements of the participant and the fact that he o r she is free to 
withdraw at any  time wi thout giving a reason and without prejudice to his or her further medical 
care.
The invest igator is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the ICF 
and if applicable, the patientauthorizat ion form. The ICF, patient authorizat ion form (if 
applicable), and patient information sheet (if applicable) must be approved by [CONTACT_178059].
The ICF, patientauthorization form (if applicable), and patientinformat ion sheet (if applicable) 
must be written in a language fully co mprehensible to the prospective patient. It is the 
responsibilit y of the invest igator to explain the detailed elements of the ICF, patient authori zation 
form (if applicable), and patientinformat ion sheet (if applicable) to the patient. Information should 
be given in both oral and wr itten form whenever possible and in the manner deemed appropriate by 
[CONTACT_4186]. In the event the patientis not capable of rendering adequate written informed 
consent, then the patient’s legally acceptable representative may provide such consent for the 
patientin accordance with applicable laws and regulat ions.
The patient, or the patient’s legally acceptable representative, must be given ample opportu nity to: 
(1) inquire about details of the study and (2) decide whether or not to participate in the study. If the 
patient, or the patient’s legally acceptable representative, determines he or she will part icipate in 
the study , then the ICF and patientauthorization form (if applicable) must be signed and dated by 
[CONTACT_102], or the patient’s legally acceptable representative, at the time o f consent and prior to the 
patiententering into the study. The patientor the patient’s legally acceptable representat ive should 
be instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknames, using blue or black ballpo int ink. The 
investigator must also sign and date the ICF and patientauthorization (if applicable) at the time o f 
consent and prior to patient entering into the study; however, the sponsor may allow a designee o f 
the invest igator to sign to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_1289].
Once signed, the original ICF, patientauthorizat ion form (if applicable), and patientinformat ion

If the serum and urine M -protein are not measurable, a ≥50% decrease in the difference 
between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M -protein criteria.
If serum and urine M -protein are not measurable, and serum FLC is als o not measurable, ≥50%

(b) For relapse -refracto ry myeloma only .
(c) These categories do not contribute to the ORR.
Before the institution of any new therapy, sCR, CR, an d VGPR categories require serum and urine 
studi es regardl ess of whether disease at baseline was measurable on serum, urine, both, or neither. 
Radiographic studi es are not requi red to sati sfy these response requirements. Bone marrow 
assessments need not be conﬁrmed.
PD is defined as an increase of ≥25% from  lowest response value in any  of the f ollowing:
a)Serum  M-protein (absolute increase must be ≥0.5 g/dL); serum M component increases 
≥1g/dL are sufficient to de ﬁne relapse if starting M component is ≥5 g/dL ), and/or
b)Urine M -protein (abso lute increase must be ≥200 mg/24 hour), and/or
c)Only in pat ients without measurable serum and urine M -protein levels: the difference between 
involved and uninvo lved FLC levels (abso lute increase must be >10 mg/dL).

b)Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium >11.5 mg/dL) that can be attributed 
solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder.
A diagnosis o f PD m ust be confi rmed by 2 consecutive assessments.
Clarificat ions to IMWG criteria for coding PD: Bone marrow criteria for PD are to be used only in 
patients wi thout m easurable disease by M -protein and by  [CONTACT_128759] l evels; “25% increase” refers to 
M-protein, FLC, and bone marrow res ults, and does not refer to bone lesio ns, soft tissue 
plasmacy tomas, or hy percalcemia, and the “lowest response value” does not need to be a 
confirmed value.

Study Number: TAK -079-1501 Phase: 1/2a
Study Design:
This is a multicenter, open -label, dose -escalation, single -arm, phase 1/2a study designed to determine the safety and 
tolerability of TAK -079 monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) multiple myeloma (MM), and to 
provide a pr eliminary assessment of its activity against r/r MM. 
Once enrolled into the study, patients will receive TAK -079 via subcutaneous (SC) administration in each 28 -day 
cycle of treatment, administered as once weekly for 8 weeks (8 doses), once ever y 2 weeks for 16 weeks (8 doses), and 
once ever y 4 weeks thereafter until disease progression (PD). Patients will receive ongoing treatment with TAK -079 
until PD, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal due to other reasons. 
The phase 1 portion of the study will eva luate administration of TAK -079 for dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) to 
determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for further assessment in 
phase 2a. A recommended dose below the MTD may be identified based on the review of safety, pharmacokinetic 
(PK), , and clinical data from the phase 1 portion of the study. 
The safety and tolerability of TAK -079 will be assessed by [CONTACT_618512] -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs), dose modifications, treatment discontinuations, vital signs, physical examinations, serum chemistry 
and hematology, urinalysis, electrocardiograms, and concomitant medications. In phase 1, approximately [ADDRESS_821838] 10 enrolled patients and then ever y 10 patients
thereafter .
It is expected that approximately 42 patients will be enrolled in the study. The estimated duration of the study is 
approximately 48 months (ie, 4 years).
Primary Objectives:
Phase 1
Todetermine the safety ,tolerability , and the MTD/RP2D of TAK -079 monotherapy in patients with r/r MM.
Phase 2a
To provide a preliminary evaluation of the clinical activity of TAK -079 monotherapy in patients with r/r MM.
Secondary Objectives:
Phase 1

Sample Size Justification:
Phase 1 of the study will follow a 3+3 dose escalation schema.
The selection of the next recommended dose will be determined based on safety, clinical, PK,  
data. Dose -escalatio n cohorts may  be expanded to include additional patients t o obtain a more comprehensive 
assessment of disease response before the phase 2a portion of this study is opened to enrollment. Approximately 
6dose levels are planned. For phase 1, the number of patients is planned to be approximately 24. 
In phase 2a, ap proximately 18 additio nal patients will be treated to provide a preliminary estimate of the ORR in 
patients with r/r MM. All patients with MM must show clear evidence of PD with anti -CD38 therapy. 
Phase 2a of the study will also provide a more robust esti mate of the safety profile at the MTD/RP2D.
No prospective calculations of statistical power have been made; however, the following table shows the width of the 
80% CI, based on the observed ORR in a cohort size of 18 patients, for a range of observed resp onse rates. An 
observed ORR greater than 20% would be of interest in this r/r population.

[IP_ADDRESS] Severe Cytokine Release Syndrome 
Severe cytokine release syndrome (SCRS) is characterized by [CONTACT_4140], often acco mpanied 
by [CONTACT_4141], in addit ion to fever, chills, rigors, urtic aria, and angioedema. This 
syndro me may be associ ated wi th som e features of tum or lysis syndrom e such as hyperuricemia, 
hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, acute renal failure, and elevated lactate 
dehydrogenase, and may  be associ ated wi th acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_618462]. The acute 
respi [INVESTIGATOR_33078] m ay be accom panied by [CONTACT_618516] a, visible on a chest x -ray. The syndrom e frequent ly manifests wi thin [ADDRESS_821847] dosing interrupted immediately and shoul d receive 
aggressive symptomat ic treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematologic Effects
Reductions in platelets, lymphocy tes, and RBCs occurred in nonclinical studies in some animals 
administered doses of TAK -079 higher than the NOAEL. Subjects in clinical studies of TAK -079
shoul d be m onitored cl osely, including testing of hematology  parameters. 
The important potential risk of these hematologic changes will be m onitored throughout this 
clinical study , as described in Section 9.4.13 and  Appendix A.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Infections
In a GLP -compliant 13 -week toxico logy study , bacteri al and/or vi ral infecti on secondary  to 
immune suppression was observed in cyno molgus mo nkeys at IV doses of 3, 30, and 80 mg/kg 
administered once every  2 weeks. The NOAEL dose of 0.3 mg/kg, administered IV once every  
week, was not associated with infect ions.
Subjects w ill be monitored for any  signs and symptom s of the important potential risk of serious 
infect ions throughout this clinical study  (see Sect ion 8.8.3).
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug Interactions
Nonclinical drug interaction studies have not been conducted with TAK -079. However, as a fully 
human IgG1 monoclonal antibody
 (mAb), the risk of drug-drug i nteracti ons is l ow.
[IP_ADDRESS] ADA Interactions
ADA responses were detected in most monkey s in the single -dose PK studies and the 4- week 
(non-GLP) and 13 -week (GLP) toxicology studies. Strong posit ive ADA responses were generally 
associ ated wi th lower serum  concentrati ons of  TAK -079, and this was especially notable in the 
13-week repeat -dose to xicity studi es and at l ower doses.
In the single -dose healt hy subject study  (TAK -079_101), 5 of 54TAK -
079–treated subj ects were 
positive for ADA (3 subjects with transient ADA and 2 subjects with persistent ADA). Of these,

TAK -[ADDRESS_821848] was treated in the 0.0 6 mg IV cohort and the remaining 4 subjects were treated with 
either 0.03 mg/kg (2 subjects), 0.1 mg/kg ([ADDRESS_821849]), or 0.6 mg/kg ([ADDRESS_821850]) SC TAK -079.
Immunogenicit y was not associ ated wi th clinically si gnificant AEs, even in the [ADDRESS_821851] ent immunogenicit y.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy and Lactation
TAK -[ADDRESS_821852] not been conducted with TAK -079. 
However, there were no TAK -079–r elated changes in organ weights or microscopic findings noted 
in the male and female reproductive tract of monkeys following administration for up to 13 weeks. 
Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) may be enrolled in clinical trials with appropriate

4.4 Rationale for the Proposed Study
Although mult iple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_618463] , thisdisease remain sincurable ; 
thus, significant unmet medical need exists for this patient population . Frequent relapses highlight 
a need for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_78937] m prior treatm ents have failed. 
TAK -[ADDRESS_821855] epi[INVESTIGATOR_265166]38 and possesses a different binding profile than 
the approved cy tolytic anti -CD38 therapeuti c ant ibody  daratum umab . Unlike daratum umab, 
TAK -079 does not bind to RBCs and platel ets. Therefor e, TAK -079 may possess higher 
tumoricidal  activity than daratum umab because cy tolytic effector acti vity is focused on CD38+ 
leukocy tes/tum ors and is not misdirected to RBCs and platelets. Consequent ly,TAK -079 m ay 
demonstrate higher potency ( ie,activit y at lower doses and exposures) and activit y in 
daratum umab -refractory  tumors (i e, tum ors expressing lower levels o f CD38) and thus be more 
efficient at eliminat ing tum ors.

In the FIH study  (TAK -079_101) , TAK -[ADDRESS_821856] s (ie, cytolysis 
of NK cells and PBs) following single -dose administration, with no unexpected and unwanted 
clinical or hematologic effects observed.
In summary , it is feasible to invest igate administration of TAK -079 in pat ients with relapsed or 
refractory  (r/r) MM.
4.4.1 Rationale for the Starting Dose of TAK -079
In the FIH study  (TAK -079_101) , TAK -079 was well tolerated after SC administration o f 
single- doses ranging fro m 0.03 to 0.6 m g/kg.
To avoi d unnecessary  exposure of patients to sub -therapeut ic doses while pres erving safet y, the
starting dose for this study  in pati ents wi th r/r MM will be 45 mg, the fixed -dose equivalent of 
0.6mg/kg (assuming a body weight of 75 kg), which was the highest SC dose administered in 
Study  TAK -079_101. The 0.6 m g/kg dose was well to lerated in healthy human subjects in Study 
TAK -
079_101 and demonstrated depletion o f peripheral blood PBs, a surrogate for tumor cells.
TAK -[ADDRESS_821857] itutively 
expressed on plasma cells, PBs, and NK cells, and is induced on activated T cells and B cells [7]. 
Therefore , the ant icipated eliminat ion routes for TAK -079 are via proteoly tic catabo lism and 
intracellular degradation after binding to its target. Both of these clear ance m echanisms are not 
thought to be significant ly influenced by [CONTACT_18559]. Addit ionally , the distribut ion volume of 
mAbs is generally  limited to the vol ume of the bl ood and extracellular fluids, such that body  
composition is a l ess important determinan t of distributi on vol ume as com pared withsmall  
molecule drugs [
8]. For these reasons, body weight is not expected to ha ve a clinically significant 
effect on the disposit ion of TAK -079, thereby  [CONTACT_618517] -dose 
administration.
The 45 m g starting dose of TAK -
079 willbe tested in 3 patients with r/rMM to assess the safet y 
and tol erabilit y of TAK -079 af ter mu lt iple dose administration. TAK -079 will be administered 
using the same dosing schedule as the ant i-CD38 ant ibody , daratum umab, which is approved for 
the treatment of patients with MM [5].Specifically, TAK -079 will be administered once weekly 
for 8 weeks (8 doses ), once every  2 weeks for 16 weeks ( 8 doses ), then once every  4 weeks until 
the pati ent experi ences disease progression ( PD), unacceptable toxicit ies, or wi thdrawal  due to 
other reasons . The subsequent planned dose levels are 135, 300, [ADDRESS_821858] cy cle of the 
previous (sequent ial) cohort has co mpleted.
Addit ional details for dose escalat ion are provi ded in Secti on8.3.

6.0 STUDY DESIGN
6.1 Overview of Study Design
This is a mult icenter, dose-escalat ion, open -label, single -arm, phase 1/2a study  designed to 
determine the safet y, tolerabili ty, efficacy, PK, and immunogenicit y of TAK -079 monotherapy  in 
patients wi th r/rMM, and to provide a preliminary assessment of its activit y against MM.
The phase 1 portion o f the study will evaluate administration of TAK -079 for DLT (s)to determine 
the MTD /RP2D for further assessment in phase 2a. A recommended dose below the MTD may be 
ident ified based on safety, clinical, PK,  data. The safet y and tol erabilit y of 
TAK -079 will be assessed by  [CONTACT_618520], dose modificat ions, treatment 
discontinuat ions, vital signs, physical examinat ions, serum  chemistry  and hematol ogy analyses , 
urinalyses, ECGs , and review of conco mitant m edicati ons.
Thepreliminary  efficacy  of TAK -079 will be evaluated by  [CONTACT_618544] e ORR , defined as the 
proporti on of  patients who achieved a PR or better during study, as defined by [CONTACT_42294]
(Appendix E; [9,10] ). Inaddition, the efficacy of TAK -079 will be assessed by [CONTACT_618522] , 
DOR , 
and OS ; TTR will also be measured.
Once enrolled into the study, patients will receive TAK -079 via SC administration in each 28 -day 
cycle of  treatm ent, administered as once weekly for 8 weeks (8 doses), once every 2 weeks for 
16weeks (8 doses), and once every  [ADDRESS_821860] of the fo llowing phases/periods: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up:

8.2 Definitions of DLT
Toxicit y will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effective 14 June 2010 
[12]. These criteria are provided in the Study  Manual . DLTs will be defined as any  of the 
following events regardless of relat ionship, except those events that are clearly due to e xtraneous 
causes.
Grade 4 laboratory abnormalit ies, except those events that are clearly due to extraneous causes, 
will be defined as a DLT. 
Nonhematologic TEAEs of NCI CTCAE Grade 3, except those events that are clearly due to 
extraneous causes, and oc curring during the first cycle will be considered DLTs (see Sect ion 
10.2 for relatedness guidance), with the fo llowing exceptions:
–Grade 3 nausea/vo miting that can be managed subsequent ly wit h antiemetics (Grade 3 
nausea or vomit ing that persists beyo nd 48 hours with or without appropriate medical 
intervent ion will be considered a DLT).
–Grade 3 fatigue lasting less than 72 hours.
–Grade [ADDRESS_821882] that resolves to Grade ≤1 or baseline wit hin 7 days.
–Grade 3 IR that responds to symptomat ic treatment (eg, antihistamines, nonsteroidal 
anti
-inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs), narcotics, IV fluids), without recurrence of Grade 3 
symptoms .
Hem atologic TEAEs of NCI CTCAE Grade ≥4, except those events that are clearly  due to 
extraneous causes, and occurring during the first cycle will be considered DLTs, with the 
following except ions:
–Grade ≥3 hemo lysis, except those events that are clearly due to extraneous causes (eg, 
negat ive direct Coombs test) ,will be included in the definit ion of DLT.
–Grade 3 low platelet or higher count with clinically  meaningful bleeding will be included 
in the definit ion of DLT.
An incomplete recovery  from treatm ent-related toxicit y causing a >2 -week del ay in the next
scheduled in jection before the init iation of Cycle 2 will be considered a DLT .
For the purpose of dose escalation, DLTs are those events meeting the criteria above that occur 
before Cycle 2 Day  1 admini strati on. TEAEs meeting DLT definit ions occurring in later cy cles 
will determine the suitabilit y of the MTD as the RP2D.

of the next injecti on, a ndsubacute toxicit y (for example ,neutropenia) that might be worsened 
upon another in jectionif it is not ona clear recovery  path. If the dose cannot be administered 
on the scheduled day , the pati ent can be reviewed at the investigator’s discret ion in the 
following 48 hours. If TAK -079 cannot be administered within a cycle in this 48 -hour

Modification)
TAK -[ADDRESS_821893] igator considers that re -treatm ent of  the pati ent coul d be dangerous. For 
Grade 4 (life-threatening) TEAEs, consider permanent ly withdrawing the pati ent from the study , 
except when the invest igator determines that the patient is receiving cli nical  benefi t, there are 
opportunit iesto provi de supportive care to mit igate risk for the Grade 4 event to reoccur, and this 
approach (ie, the specific situa tion and mi tigation plan)has been discussed with the sponsor .In 
these circumstances, treatment may be restarted at the previously safe dose level or below when 
toxicity recovers to Grade ≤1 or baseline.
If the next cycle of TAK -079 is delayed for >14 days because of TAK -079–rel ated toxi cities, then 
the pat ient should have study  treatment di scont inued unless the invest igator considers that the 
patient will receive benefit from continuing in the study. If treatment discont inuat ion occurs, the 
end of treatment (EOT)/early terminat ion visit should be co mpleted and the fo llow

Imaging tests as specified in Appendix Aare to be performed as defined below or when there is a 
need to document a response or a disease progression. Response and relapse categories are 
described in Appendix E.
 Imaging tests will be taken during the screening phase prior to treatment 
and every  6cycles thereafter until PD or intolerance. Addit ional surveys (x -ray, CT, or MRI) will 
be perform ed at the invest igator’s discretion (eg, in case of bone pain) to document a response or 
progressive disease. The same imaging technique should be used throughout the study to facilitate 
consistent disease assessment. 
CR shoul d be confirmed with follow-up assessments of SPEP, UPEP, immunofixat ion of blood 
and urine, and serum FLCs as outlined in Appendix A. One BMA assessment has to occu r to 
docum ent CR; no second bone marrow confirmation is needed.
Note that to determine a response of sCR, BMA immunohistochemistry  or immuno fluorescence 
for kapp a:lambda rati o, as well as serum FLC assay , shoul d be perform ed for all  patients 
suspected to b e in CR to m eet this response category ’s requi rements.
PD m ay be confirmed per standard clinical pract ice at the site. Local lab oratory  resul ts may be 
used to confirm PD.

tomography -computed tomography (PET -CT) scan , com puted tom ography  (CT) scan (includes 
low-dose CT) , or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be performed at screening (if the 
patient has adequate im age test performed within [ADDRESS_821916] dose of study  drug, 
that image be used as baseline and does not need to be repeated as part of screening) as needed for 
evaluat ion of disease. If disease is documented, then a repeat PET -CT scan, CT sc an, or MRI scan 
shoul d be perform ed as requi red to docum ent response or PD.
Scans will be performed at screening and at the EOT/early termination visit. All treatment phase 
and fo llow-up scans should use the same imaging modalit y used at screening.
Surveys (x-ray, CT, or MRI) m ay also be performed at the invest igator’s discret ion, eg, in case of

development of drug dependency  or drug abuse; any  organism , virus, or infecti ous parti cle 
(eg,prion protein transmitt ing transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogeni c or 
nonpathogenic, is considered an infect ious agent.
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  lab abnormalit y, will be determined using the 
NCI CTCAE, Versi on 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010 [12].Clarification should be made 
between an SAE and an AE that is considered sever e in intensit y (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms 
serious and severe are notsynonymous. The general term severe is often used to describe the 
intensity (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may  be of  relatively minor 
medical significan ce (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is notthe same as serious , which is based 
on pati ent/event outcome or action criteria described above, and usually associated with events 
that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to functi on. A severe AE (Gra de 3 or 4) does not 
necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, a white blood cell count of 1000 /mm3to 
<
2000 mm3is considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not 
intensity) serves as a guide for defining regul atory  reporting obligations.
10.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_53341]/or in response to an open question fro m study  
personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examinat ion, or other diagn ostic procedures will be 
recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section 10.3 for the period of observat ion). Any 
clinically relevant det erioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an 
AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a commo n underlying patho logy shoul d be 
noted as 1 comprehensive event.
Regardless of causalit y, SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Section 10.1)
 must be 
reported (see Section 10.3 for the peri od of  observati on) by [CONTACT_231941] (contact [CONTACT_51259]). This should be

and the causalit y of the event in rel ation to study  procedures.
Severit y (toxicit y grade) for each AE, including any lab abnormalit y, will be determined using the 
NCI CTCAE, version4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010 [12]. The criteria are provided in the Study 
Manual.
Relationship of the event to study  drug administratio n (ie, its causali ty) will be determined by  [CONTACT_4175] y es (rel ated) or no (unrelated) to this quest ion: “Is there a reasonable 
possibilit y that the AE i s associ ated wi th the study  drug?”
10.3 Monitoring of AEs and Period of Observation
AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be mo nitored throughout the study  as fo llows:
AEs will be reported from the signing of informed consent through [ADDRESS_821929] dose of study  drug and recorded in the eCRFs. 
SAEs:
Serious pretreatm ent events will be reported to the [COMPANY_005] Global Pharmacovigilance 
departm ent or desi gnee fro m the time of the signing of the ICF up to the first dose of study  
drug, and will also be recorded in the eCRF.
Related and unrelated treatment -emergent SAEs will be reported to the [COMPANY_005] Global 
Pharmacovigilance department or designee fro m the first dose of study  drug through 30days 
after administrati on of  the l ast dos e of study drug and recorded in the eCRF. After this period, 
only related SAEs m ust be reported to the [COMPANY_005] Global Pharmacovigilance department or

15.2 Patient Information, Informed Consent, and Patien t Authorization
Written consent documents will embody  the elements of informed consent as described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. The ICF, patientauthori zation form (if applicable), and patient
inform ation sheet (if applicable) describe the planned and permitted uses, transfers, and 
disclosures of the patient ’s personal and personal health informat ion for purposes of conducting 
the study. The ICF and the patientinformat ion sheet (if applicable) further explain the nature of the 
study , its obj ectives, and potential risks and benefit s, as well as the date informed consent are 
given. The ICF will detail the requirements of the participant and the fact that he o r she is free to 
withdraw at any  time wi thout giving a reason and without prejudice to his or her further medical 
care.
The invest igator is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the ICF 
and if applicable, the patientauthorizat ion form. The ICF, patient authorizat ion form (if 
applicable), and patient information sheet (if applicable) must be approved by [CONTACT_178059].
The ICF, patientauthorization form (if applicable), and patientinformat ion sheet (if applicable) 
must be written in a language fully co mprehensible to the prospective patient. It is the 
responsibilit y of the invest igator to explain the detailed elements of the ICF, patient authori zation 
form (if applicable), and patientinforma tion sheet (if applicable) to the patient. Information should 
be given in both oral and wr itten form whenever possible and in the manner deemed appropriate by 
[CONTACT_4186]. In the event the patientis not capable of rendering adequate written informed 
consent, then the patient’s legally acceptable representative may provide such consent for the 
patientin accordance with applicable laws and regulat ions.
The patient, or the patient’s legally acceptable representative, must be given ample opportunit y to: 
(1) inquire about details of the study and (2) decide whether or not to participate in the study. If the 
patient, or the patient’s legally acceptable representative, determines he or she will part icipate in 
the study , then the ICF and patientauthorizat ion form (if applicable) must be signed and dated by 
[CONTACT_102], or the patient’s legally acceptable representative, at the time o f consent and prior to the 
patiententering into the study. The patientor the patient’s legally acceptable representative should 
be instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknames, using blue or black ballpo int ink. The 
investigator must also sign and date the ICF and patientauthorization (if applicable) at the time o f 
consent a nd prior to patient entering into the study; however, the sponsor may allow a designee o f 
the invest igator to sign to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_1289].
Once signed, the original ICF, patientauthorizat ion form (if applicable), and patientinformat ion
sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the investigator’s site file. The investigator must document 
the date the patientsigns the informed consent in the patient’s medical record. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_4082], the si gned patient authorizat ion form (if applicable), and patientinformation sheet (if

15.3 Patient Confidentiality
The sponsor and designees affirm and upho ld the principle of the patient’s right to protecti on 
against invasio n of privacy. Throughout this study , a patient ’s source data will only  be linked to 
the sponsor’s clinical study  database or documentation via a unique ident ificat ion number. As 
permitted by [CONTACT_86001], limited patient attributes, such as sex, age, or date 
of birth, and patientinitials may be used to verify the patientand accuracy o f the patient’s unique 
ident ificat ion number.
To com ply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify co mpliance with this protocol , the sponsor 
requi res the investigator to permit its monitor or designee’s monitor, representatives fro m any 
regul atory  authori ty (eg, the FDA, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory  Agency ,

DLT.
Rationale for Change:
This change was made in response to an FDA request for all AEs of specified grades to be counted 
as DLTs, regardless o f investigator attribut ion or relatedness.
Change 10: The dose escalat ion schema was changed to a 3+3 design fro m a Bayesian logisti c 
regression model.
The primary  change occurs in Section 8.3.2 Escal ation Schema :
Initial 
wording:The Bayesian Logist ic Regression Modeling (BLRM) method with overdose con trol 
will be used to inform dose escalat ion decisio ns and MTD/RP2D estimat ion. Init ially, 
3 pati ents will be enrolled at the starting dose level.
The follow ing rules will apply only for this initial dose level:
If none of the patients in a cohort of 3 patients exhibits a DLT during the 28 -day 
cycle, then the dose m ay be escalated for the next cohort of 3 patients.
If 1 patient in a cohort of 3 patients exhibits a DLT, then that cohort will be 
expanded to a total of 6 patients.
–If no addit ional pat ient in the expanded cohort of 6 exhibit s a DLT, then the 
dose m ay be escalated for the next cohort of 3 patients (pending approval 
following review of available safet y data).
–If a second (or more) patient in the expanded cohort of [ADDRESS_821987] exceeded the MTD, and dose escalation 
will be stopped (pending BLRM approval fo llowing review of available safet y 
data).
If [ADDRESS_821988] co hort.

Initial 
wording:Grade 3 AEs Hold TAK -079 until resolution to Grade ≤1 or baseline, then resume 
treatment at either the same dose or a reduced dose level at the 
discretio n of the investigator.
Grade 4 (life -threatening) AEs Consider pe rmanently withdrawing the patient from the study, except 
when the investigator determines that the patient is receiving clinical 
benefit and has discussed this with the sponsor. Treatment may be 
restarted at a reduced dose level or below when toxicity reco vers to 
Grade ≤1 or baseline.
Amended 
or new 
wording:Grade [ADDRESS_821993] study 
treatment interrupted until the AE resolves to Grade ≤1 or 
baseline, then resume treatment at either the same dose or a reduced 
dose level at the discretion of the investigator .
Grade 4 (life -threatening) AEs Consider permanently withdrawing the patient from the study, except 
when the investigator determines that the patient is receiving clinical 
benefit and has discussed this with the sponsor. Treatment may be 
restarted at a reduced dose level or below when toxicity recovers to 
Grade ≤1 or baseline. Patients with Grade 4 AEs considered 
related to s tudy treatment should permanently discontinue 
treatment.
Rationale for Change:
This change was made in response to an FDA request for the dose modificat ion gui delines to be 
changed such that for Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicit y, after resolut ion of the toxicity to Grade ≤1 
or baseline, TAK -079 shoul d be reduced by 1dose level, and for Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicit y, 
TAK -079 shoul dbe permanent ly discont inued.

The primary  change occurs in Section 8.8.1 Handling of I Rs:
Added text: In case of Grade 1 or 2 infusion reactions: 
Withhold t herapy (also administration of remaining SC injections when full 
dose was not yet reached) until resolution to Grade 1 or maximum to Grade 2 
as per the investigator’s discretion. 
In case of Grade 3 infusion reactions: 
Withhold therapy (also administration of remaining SC injections when full 
dose was not yet reached and therefore skip remaining dose) until next 
scheduled TAK -[ADDRESS_821994] recovered to Grade ≤1 at the moment of the next scheduled TAK -079 
dose .

2.0 STUDY SUMMARY
Name [CONTACT_790]:
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of [COMPANY_005] Pharmaceutical Company LimitedCompound:
TAK -079
Title of Protocol: A Phase 1/2a, Open -label, 
Dose -Escalation Study to Investigate the Safety and 
Tolerability, Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics, and 
Immunogenicity of TAK -079 Administered Subcutaneously 
as a Single Agent in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory 
Multiple Myeloma 
Study Number: TAK -079-1501 Phase: 1/2a
Study Design:
This is a multicenter, open -label, dose -escalation, single -arm, phase 1/2a study designed to determine the safety and 
tolerability of TAK -079 monotherapy in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multi ple myeloma (RRMM), and to 
provide a preliminary assessment of its activity against RRMM. 
Once enrolled into the study, patients will receive TAK -079 via subcutaneous (SC) administration in each 28 -day 
cycle of treatment, administered as once weekly for 8 weeks (8 doses), once ever y 2 weeks for 16 weeks (8 doses), and 
once ever y 4 weeks thereafter until disease progression (PD). Patients will receive ongoing treatment with TAK -079 
until PD, unaccepta ble toxicities, or withdrawal due to other reasons. The maximum duration of treatment will be 12 
months; however, patients with clinical benefit (per investigator and as agreed upon by [CONTACT_456]’s study clinician) 
can continue on treatment beyond 1 year with the explicit approval of the sponsor’s study clinician (see Section 6.3).
The phase 1 portion of the study will evaluate administration of TAK -079 for dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) to 
determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for further assessment in 
phase 2a. A recommended dose below the MTD may be identified based on the review of safety, pharmacokinetic 
(PK), , and clinical data from the phase 1 portion of the study. 
The safety and tolerability of TAK -079 will be assessed by [CONTACT_618512] -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs), dose modifications, treatmen t discontinuations, vital signs, physical examinations, serum chemistry 
and hematology, urinalysis, electrocardiograms, and concomitant medications. In phase 1, approximately [ADDRESS_822011] 10 enrolled patients and th en ever y 10 patients 
thereafter.
It is expected that approximately 42 patients will be enrolled in the study. The estimated duration of the study is 
approximately 36 months (ie, 3 years). 
Primary Objectives:
Phase 1
To determine the safety and tolerabili ty of TAK-079 mo notherapy  in patients with RRMM.
Phase 2a
To provide a preliminary evaluation of the clinical activity of TAK -079 monotherapy in patients with RRMM.
Secondary Objectives:
Phase 1
To investigate a potential MTD/RP2D of TAK -079.
To evaluate the immunogenicity of TAK -079.
To characterize the PK of TAK -079.
To provide a preliminary evaluation of the clinical activity of TAK -079.

TAK -[ADDRESS_822019] -in-human (FIH) study  
(TAK -079_101) . Only mild or moderate AEs were observed in the FIH study  in healt hy subjects. 
Therefore, clinical benefits and risks have not been assessed in the disease setting. 
A summary o f findings is discussed in Section 4.3.[ADDRESS_822020] ions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion and Injection Site Reactions
IRs are potentially dose -limit ing AEs, not uncommonly associated with IV administration of 
biologic agents aimed at treating hematologic malignancies [5]. IRsare less frequent ly associated 
with SC inject ion of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The ‘true’ clinical hypersensit ivity react ions, 
antibody -
mediated occur after repeat exposure. Symptoms of hypersensi tivity range from mild 
skin rash to more severe reactions, wheezing, hypotension, poor perfusio n, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4047], and 
rarely  death. Non -anaphylactic clinical hypersensitivit y occurs wi thin the fi rst hour; however 
delayed responses were reported. Sympto ms of anaphylaxis, a potentially life -threatening 
condi tion, range from  swelling, angioedema, bronchospasm, respi[INVESTIGATOR_36645], and shock [9]. 
There are limited nonclinical and clinical data to date for TAK -079 (Section
 4.2.1 ). Local inject ion 
site abnormalit ies have not been observed in monkey and rat nonclinical studies after SC and/or IV 
administration of TAK -079. In the clinical study  of healthy subjects (TAK -079_101), an 
infusio n-related reacti on was defined as a TEAE occurring within 2 hours of the start of an 
infusio n; there were no IRs in this study ,as no allergic or cytokine release reactions were observed 
within this t ime period. Mild inject ion site AEs were reported; AEs were Grade [ADDRESS_822021] ion, management may include discont inuat ion of SC administration of 
TAK -079 and/or the administration of appropriate medical therapy . 
See addi tional details for m anaging infus ion and inject ion site reaction s in Sect ion
 8.8.1 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Cytokine Release Syndrome
CRS represents an important IRoften associ ated wit h the use of monoclonal ant ibodies used in 
anti-inflammatory  and ant itumor therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014]. CRS may  occur early in therapy , and often after the 
first infusi on of the drug due to a high -level o f activat ion of the immune system and engagement 
and proliferat ion of T -cells that can result in increased cytokine release. The CRS hallmark is

TAK -[ADDRESS_822022] ions throughout this clinical study 
(see Section 8.8.4 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug Interactions
Nonclinical drug interaction studies have not been conducted with TAK -079. However, as a fully 
human IgG1 monoclonal antibody  (mAb), the risk of drug- drug i nteracti ons is l ow.
[IP_ADDRESS] ADA Interactions
ADA responses were detected in most monkeys in the single -dose PK studies and the 4- week 
(non-GLP) and 13 -week (GLP) toxicology studies. Strong posit ive ADA responses were generally 
associ ated wi th lower serum  concentrati ons of  TAK -079, and this was especially notable in the 
13-week repeat -dose toxicit y studi es and at l ower doses.
In the single -dose healt hy subject study  (TAK -079_101), 5 of 54TAK -
079–treated subj ects were 
positive for ADA (3 subjects with transient ADA and 2 sub jects wi th persistent ADA). Of these, 
1subject was treated in the 0.06 mg IV cohort and the remaining 4 subjects were treated with 
either 0.03 mg/kg (2 subjects), 0.1 mg/kg ([ADDRESS_822023]), or 0.6 mg/kg ([ADDRESS_822024]) SC TAK -079. 
Immunogenicit y was not associ ated with clinically si gnificant AEs, even in the 2 subjects with 
persistent immunogenicit y.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy and Lactation
TAK -[ADDRESS_822025] not been conducted with TAK -079. 
However, there were no TAK -
079–related changes in organ weights or microscopic findings noted 
in the male and female reproductive tract of monkeys fo llowing administration for up to 13 weeks.

4.4 Rationale for the Proposed Study
Although mult iple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_618463] , this disease remains incurable; 
thus, significant unmet medical need exists for this patient population. Frequent relapses highlight 
a need for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_78937] m prior treatm ents have failed . 
TAK -079 binds to unique amino acids of CD38 and possesses a different binding profile than the 
approved cy tolytic ant i-CD38 therapeutic ant ibody daratumumab. 
In the FIH study (TAK -079_101), TAK -079 demonstrat ed pharmacodynamic effects (ie, cytolysis 
of NK cells and PBs) fo llowing single -dose administration, with no unexpected and unwanted 
clinical or hematologic effects observed. For example, NK cells were reduced >90 % fro m ba seline 
levels in all healt hy subjects receiving a single 0.06 mg/kg IV dose of TAK -079 and exhibited a 
mean C maxof 0.1 ug/m L (TAK -079_101). Com parable deplet ion of NK cells by [CONTACT_618561] a populat ion of patients with refractor y MM [
12]required doses of >24 mg/kg 
and a mean C maxof >500 ug/m L [13,14] . Consequent ly, TAK -[ADDRESS_822028] as higher activit y on tum or 
cells (ie ,activit y at lower doses, low -volume 
SCadministration ,and less frequent adm inistrati on), 
including activit y on daratumumab -refractory  tumors. The potential act ivity of TAK -[ADDRESS_822029] igated in patients with relapsed and/or refractory mult iple myelo ma (RRMM ).
4.4.1 Rationale for the Starting Dose of TAK-079
In the FIH study  (TAK -079_101), TAK -079 was well tolerated af ter SC administration o f 
single- doses ranging fro m 0.03 to 0.6 m g/kg.
To avoi d unnecessary  exposure of patients to sub -therapeut ic doses while preserving safet y, the
starting dose for this study  in pati ents with RRMM will be 45 mg, the fixed -dose equivalent of 
0.6mg/kg (assuming a body weight of 75 kg), which was the highest SC dose administered in 
Study  TAK -079_101. The 0.6 m g/kg dose was well tolerated in healthy human subjects in Study  
TAK -079_101 and d emonstrated >90% deplet ion of peripheral blood PBs, a surrogate for 
myelo ma cells in each subject (n=6).
TAK -[ADDRESS_822030] itutively 
expressed on plasma cells, PBs, and NK cells, and is induced o n activated T cells and B cells [15]. 
Therefore, the ant icipated eliminat ion routes for TAK -079 are via proteoly tic catabo lism and 
intracellular degradation after binding to its target. Both of these c learance m echanisms are not 
thought to be significant ly influenced by [CONTACT_18559]. Addit ionally , the distribut ion volume of 
mAbs is generally  limited to the vol ume of the bl ood and extracellular fluids, such that body  
composition is a l ess important determ inant of di stributi on vol ume as com pared wi th small  
molecule drugs [
16]. For these reasons, body weight is not expected to have a clinically significant 
effect on the disposit ion of TAK -079, thereby  [CONTACT_618562] -dose 
administration.
The 45 m g starti ng dose of TAK -079 will be tested in 3 patients with RRMM to assess the safet y 
and tol erabilit y of TAK -079 after m ultiple dose administrati on. TAK -079 will be administered 
using the same dosing schedule as the ant i
-CD38 ant ibody , daratum umab, which is appr oved for

the treatment of patients with MM [5]. Specifically, TAK -079 will be administered once weekly  
for 8 weeks (8 doses), once every  2 weeks for 16 weeks (8 doses), then once every  4 weeks unt il 
the pati ent experi ences disease progression (PD), unacceptable toxicit ies, or wi thdrawal  due to

6.0 STUDY DESIGN
6.1 Overview of Study Design
This is a mult icenter, dose -escalat ion, open -label, single -arm, phase 1/2a study  designed to 
determine the safet y, tolerabili ty, efficacy, PK, and immunogenicity of TAK -[ADDRESS_822032] MM. 
The phase 1 portion o f the study will evaluate administratio n of TAK-079 for DLT(s) to determine 
the MTD/RP2D for further assessment in phase 2a. A recommended dose below the MTD may be 
ident ified based on safety, clinical, PK,  data. The safet y and tol erabilit y of 
TAK -079 will be assessed by [CONTACT_618563], 
physical examinat ions, serum  chemistry  and hematol ogy analyses, urinalyses, ECGs, review of 
concomitant medicat ions, dose modificat ions, and treatment discont inuat ions.
The preliminary  effic acy of TAK -079 will be evaluated by  [CONTACT_618521], defined as the 
proporti on of  patients who achieved a PR or better during study, as defined by [CONTACT_42294] 
(Appendix E; [17,18] ). In addit ion, the efficacy of TAK -079 will be assessed by  [CONTACT_618564], 
PFS, DOR, and OS; TTR will also be measured. 
Once enrolled into the study, patients will receive TAK -079 v ia SC administration in each 28 -day 
cycle of  treatm ent, admin istered as once weekly fo r 8 weeks (8 doses), once eve ry 2weeks for 
16weeks (8 doses), and once every 4 weeks thereafter unt il PD. Patients will receive ongo ing 
treatm ent wi th TAK -079 until they  experi ence PD, unacceptable toxicit ies, or withdrawal due t o 
other reasons (see Section
 6.3).
Phase [ADDRESS_822033] of the fo llowing phases/periods: screening, treatment, and follow-up:
Screening period (visit 1): Days -21 to Day  -1.
Treatment period (visit 2/ongoing): Once -weekly  treatm ent for 8 doses (Cy cles 1 and 2), 
starting on Day 1, fo llowed by [CONTACT_618524] 2 weeks for 8 doses (Cycles 3 -6), followed 
by [CONTACT_618524]  4 weeks thereafter (Cycle 7 and beyo nd), continuing unt il patients 
experience PD, unacceptable toxicit ies, or wi thdrawal  due to other reasons. 
Follow-up peri od (EOT visit): Patients who discontinue study  treatm ent will be fo llowed for 
approximately  [ADDRESS_822034] d ose of  study  drug or until the start of subsequent 
alternat ive anticancer therapy to monitor safet y/AEs. Pati ents who discont inue treatment for 
reasons other than PD will cont inue to be fo llowed for PFS every  [ADDRESS_822035] after review of the available safet y, efficacy , 
PK,  data obtained fro m the phase 1 portion of the study .

8.2 Definitions of DLT
Toxicit y will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effective 14 June 2010 
[20]. These criteria are provided in the Study  Manual . DLTs will be defined as any  of the 
following events regardless of relat ionship, except those events that are clearly due to extraneous 
causes.
Grade 4 laboratory abnormalit ies, except those events that are clearly due to extraneous causes, 
will be defined as a DLT. 
Nonhematologic TEAEs of NCI CTCAE Grade 3, except those events that are clearly due to 
extraneous causes, and occurring during the first cycle will be considered DLTs (see Sect ion 
10.2 for relatedness guidance), with the fo llowing exceptions:
–Grade 3 nausea/vo miting that can be managed subsequent ly wit h antiemetics (Grade 3 
nausea or vomit ing that persists beyo nd 48 hours with or without appropriate medical 
intervent ion will be considered a DLT).
–Grade 3 fatigue lasting less than 3 day s (approximately 72 hours).
–Grade 3 elevation of alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase that resolves 
to Grade ≤1 or baseline within 7days.
–Grade 3 IR that responds to symptomat
ic treatment (eg, an tihistamines, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs), narcotics, IV fluids), without recurrence of Grade 3 
symptoms. See Section 8.8.1 for handling of IR swith systemic signs and symptoms.
Hem atologic TEAEs of NCI CTCAE Grade ≥4, except those events that are clearly  due to 
extraneous causes, and occurring during the first cycle will be considered DLTs, with the 
following except ions:
–Grade ≥3 hemo lysis, except those events that are clearl y due to extraneous causes 
(eg,negative direct Coombs test), will be included in the definit ion of DLT.
–Grade ≥3 low platelet count with clinically meaningful bleeding, defined as a blood loss of 
>100 cc or the requirement ofa blood transfusio n, will be included in the definit ion of 
DLT.

An incomplete recovery  from treatm ent-related toxicit y causing a >2 -week del ay in the next 
scheduled in jection before the init iation of Cycle 2 will be considered a DLT.
For the purpose of dose escalation, DLTs are those events meeting the criteria above that occur 
before Cycle 2 Day  1 administrati on. TEAEs meeting DLT definit ions occurring in later cy cles 
will determine the suitabilit y of the MTD as the RP2D.
Patients who experien ce a DLT shoul d be wi thdrawn from  study  treatm ent unl ess the sponsor 
approves subsequent treatment in a lower dose cohort; such patients will not count as a patient in 
that lower d ose cohort for escalat ion decisio ns. 
In phase 1, patients who do not receive 4 full doses of TAK -079 wi thin the 28 -day (±2) treatm ent 
window or the Day  29 (i e, Cycle 2 Day  1) assessment for reasons other than a DLT will be 
replaced. Pati ents experiencing a DLT shoul d not be replaced.
Dose and schedule modificat ions for toxi city are described in Section 8.4.
8.3 Dose- Escalation Design and Criteria
8.3.1 Dose L evels

8.4 Dose Modification Guidelines
Dose m odificat ion gui delines for toxi cities are described below for TAK -079 on the basis o f the 
type and severit y of AEs and causalit y determinat ion by [CONTACT_431] (see Section 8.4.2 ). Further 
clarificati on can be obtai ned in consultat ion with the sponsor clinician (or designee).

Absolute neutrophil count must be ≥1000/mm3.
Platelet coun t must be ≥75,000/mm3.
For therapy  to resum e, toxi city considered to be related to treatment with TAK -[ADDRESS_822061] 
resolved to Grade [ADDRESS_822062] igator, 
with agreement by  [CONTACT_456]’s m edical  monitor. 
For TAK -[ADDRESS_822063] ions wit hin the same cycle, the decisio n of ho lding treatment is left to the 
investigator’s discret ion based on clinical and analyt ical data, and also based on the toxicit y 
that the patient experienced wit h previous inject ions in the same cycle. The invest igator should 
different iate between acute toxici ty (like an IR) from which the patient is recovered at the time 
of the next injection, and subacute toxicit y (for example, neutropenia) that might be worsened 
upon another inject ion if it is not on a clear recovery  path. If the dose cannot be administered 
on the scheduled day , the pati ent can be reviewed at the investigator’s discret ion in the 
following 48 hours. If TAK -079 cannot be administered within a cycle in this 48 -hour 
window, the dose will be missed and the patient scheduled for the next administra tion per the

Criteria Action
Grade 1 AEs No dose interruptions.
Grade 2 AEs Treat according to local practice. Whether to hold treatment or to continue it 
at the same dose is at the discretion of the investigator.
Patients with Grade 2 AEs considered related to study treatment that are not 
easily  managed or corrected and are not tolerable to the patient, or AEs that 
are not acceptable in the inve stigator’s judgment, should have study 
treatment interrupted until the AE resolves to Grade ≤[ADDRESS_822068] 
study treatment interrupted until the AE resolves to Grade ≤1 or baseline, 
then resume treatment at the same dose level. (Note S ection 8.2for AEs of 
short duration and/or that respond to medical management .) 
Note in phase 1, nonhematologic AEs Grade ≥3 may meet DLT criteria and 
as such patients should be withdrawn from further dosing unless the sponsor 
approves subsequent treatment in a lower dose cohort.
Grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia with bleeding should result in a dose 
interruption until the AE resolves to Grade ≤1 or baseline, then resume at the 
same dose. Medical considerations should eliminate Coombs positivity 
before restarting ( note Table 8.b).
Grade 4 (life -threatening) AEs Patients with Grade 4 AEs considered related to study treatment should 
permanently discontinue treatment. Grade 4 hematologic toxicity should 
result in study treatment interruption until the AE resolves to Grade ≤1 or 
baseline, then resume at the same dose. Medical consideration should 
eliminate Coombs positivity before restarting ( note Section 8.4.3 and 
Table 8.b).
AEs of all grades If TAK -079 administration does not commence within the prespecified 
window ( Table 8.b) of the scheduled administration date, then the dose will 
be considered a missed dose. Administration may resume at the next planned 
dosing date upon recover y as described above.
AE=adverse event ; DLT=dose -limiting toxicity .
If initial dose interruption does not provide sufficient relief, the dose of TAK -079 shoul d be 
considered for permanent discont inuat ion.

Dose s of TAK -079 during every -4-week sdosing may  be del ayed (interrupted) up to 4 weeks. If a 
dose i s delayed (interrupted), then the dates of all subsequent doses and assessment smust be 
adjusted accordingly. Any AE deemed to be related to TAK -079 that requir es a dose del ay 
(interruption) of more than 28 days should result in permanent discontinuation of TAK -
079, unless 
both the investigator and the sponsor study clinicia n believe the patient is deriving clinical benefit.
8.4.3 Criteria for Discontinuing TAK -
079in Individual Patients (When Considering Dose 
Modification)
TAK -079 shoul d be discont inued in pat ients experiencing an AE in Cycle 1 that meet sthe criteria 
for a DLT, unless the investigator considers that re-treatm ent of the patient not to be dangerous and 
the sponsor approves subsequent treatment in a lower dose cohort. For Grade 4 (life -threatening) 
TEAEs, consider permanent ly wit hdrawing the patient fro m the study , except when the 
investigator determines that the patient is receiving clinical benefit, there are opportunit ies to 
provi de supportive care to mit igate ri sk for the Grade 4 event to reoccur, and this approach (ie, the 
specific situati on and mit igation plan)has been discussed with the sponsor . In these circumstances, 
treatm ent m ay be restarte d when toxicit y recovers to Grade ≤1 or baseline (see Table 8.aand 
Table 8.b).
8.5 Excluded Concomitant Medications and Procedures
The fo llowing m edicat ions and procedures are prohibited during the study :
Chem otherapy  and radi ation therapy  for the disease under study . Local  radiotherapy  for bone 
pain is permi tted after agreement with the sponsor’s medical mo nitor and once PD is ruled out.

tomography -computed tomography (PET -CT) scan, computed tomography (CT) scan (includes 
low-dose CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be performed as outlined in 
Appendix A. The screening scan may be performed up to [ADDRESS_822094] dose of TAK -079; 
however, if the patient has adequate image test performed within [ADDRESS_822095] scan, or MRI scan should be 
perform ed as requi red to document response or PD.
Addit ional surveys (x -ray, CT, or MRI) may also be performed at the invest igator’s discret ion, eg, 
in case of bone pain. Radiographs will  be analyzed locally and reports maintained wit h the pat ient

Local  Laboratory  Eval uations
Disease Assessment
A BMA will be obtained at screeni ng for disease assessment (if a standard BMA was drawn wit hin 
5 weeks before consent, that BMA can be used as baseline and does not need to be repeated as part 
of screening unless cy togeneti c evaluat ion is not available ). A BMA will also be obtained at any
time to assess CR or as needed to invest igate suspected PD. Requirements for BMA assessments to 
confirm disease responses are defined above and will be analyzed locally (see Section 9.4.14 ). 
Cytogenetics
Patients who do not have historically documented cy togeneti c resul ts for the hi gh-risk 
abnorm alities of del (17), t(4:14), and t(14:16) will have cy togeneti c evaluation performed on the 
BMA sample at screening. Cy togeneti c evaluat ion may be performed using fluorescence in situ 
hybridizat ion or conventional cytogenetics (karyotype). At a minimum, cytogenet ic markers must 
include the 3 high -risk abnormalit ies of del(17), t(4:14), and t(14:16). Addit ional abnormalit ies 
(ampl 1q, del 13, or del 1p) m ay also be tested. Cy togeneti cs will  be analyzed l ocally, according to

10.1.[ADDRESS_822100]; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship wit h this 
treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal 
(invest igational) produ ct whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any 
newly occurring event, or a previous condit ion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the 
administration of study  drug.
An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuat ion or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervent ion, or is considered 
by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change fro m baseline.
10.1.[ADDRESS_822101] medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death.
Is life -threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the

more severe).
Requires inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_4071] (see

development of drug dependency  or drug abuse; any  organism , virus, or infecti ous parti cle 
(eg,prion protein transmitt ing transmissible spongiform  encephalopathy), pathogenic or 
nonpathogenic, is considered an infect ious agent.
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  lab abnormalit y, will be determined using the 
NCI CTCAE, Versi on 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010 [20].Clarification should be made 
between an SAE and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms 
serious and severe are not synonymous. The general term severe is often used to describe the 
intensity (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may  be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is not the same as serious , which is based 
on pati ent/event outcome or action criteria described above, and usually associated with events 
that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to functi on. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not 
necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to 
<2000 mm3is considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not 
intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory  reporting obligations.
10.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_53341]/or in response to an open question fro m study  
personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examinat ion, or other diagnostic procedures will be 
recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section
 10.3 for the period of observat ion). Any 
clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an 
AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a commo n underlying patho logy shoul d be 
noted as 1 comprehensive event.
Regardless of causality, SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Section
 10.1) must be 
reported (see Section

15.2 Patient Information, Informed Consent, and Patient Authorization
Written consent documents will embody  the elements of informed consent as described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. The ICF, patient authorizat ion form (if applicable), and patient 
inform ation sheet (if applicable) describe the planned and permitted uses, transfer s, and 
disclosures of the patient’s personal and personal health informat ion for purposes of conducting 
the study. The ICF and the patient informat ion sheet (if applicable) further explain the nature of the 
study , its obj ectives, and potential risks and be nefits, as well as the date informed consent are 
given. The ICF will detail the requirements of the participant and the fact that he or she is free to 
withdraw at any  time wi thout giving a reason and without prejudice to his or her further medical 
care.
The invest igator is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the ICF 
and if applicable, the patient authorizat ion form. The ICF, patient authorizat ion form (if 
applicable), and patient information sheet (if applicable) must be app roved by [CONTACT_178059].
The ICF, patient authorization form (if applicable), and patient informat ion sheet (if applicable) 
must be written in a language fully co mprehensible to the prospective pat ient. It is the 
responsib ility of the invest igator to explain the detailed elements of the ICF, patient authorizat ion 
form (if applicable), and patient informat ion sheet (if applicable) to the patient. Information should 
be given in both oral and wr itten form whenever possible and in the manner deemed appropriate by 
[CONTACT_4186]. In the event the patient is not capable of rendering adequate written informed 
consent, then the patient’s legally  acceptable representati ve m ay provi de such consent for the 
patient in accordance with ap plicable laws and regulat ions.
The patient, or the patient’s legally acceptable representative, must be given ample opportunit y to: 
(1) inquire about details of the study and (2) decide whether or not to participate in the study. If the 
patient, or the pat ient’s legally acceptable representative, determines he or she will part icipate in 
the study , then the ICF and pat ient authorizat ion form (if applicable) must be signed and dated by 
[CONTACT_102], or the patient’s legally acceptable representative, at the time o f consent and prior to the 
patient entering into the study. The pat ient or the patient’s legally acceptable representative should 
be instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknames, using blue or black ballpo int ink. The 
investigator must als o sign and date the ICF and patient authorization (if applicable) at the time o f 
consent and prior to patient entering into the study; however, the sponsor may allow a designee o f 
the invest igator to sign to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_1289].
Once sig ned, the ori ginal  ICF, pati ent authori zation form (if applicable), and pat ient informat ion

15.3 Patien t Confidentiality
The sponsor and designees affirm and upho ld the principle of the patient’s right to protection 
against invasio n of privacy. Throughout this study , a pati ent’s source data will only  be linked to 
the sponsor’s clinical study  database or doc umentation via a unique ident ificat ion number. As 
permitted by [CONTACT_39823], limited patient attributes, such as sex, age, or date 
of birth, and patient initials may be used to verify the pat ient and accuracy  of the pati ent’s unique 
ident ificat ion number.

with applicable laws, regulat ions and guidance, [COMPANY_005] will, at a minimum register intervent ional 
clinical trials it sponsors anywhere in the world on ClinicalTrials.gov or other publicly accessible 
websites on or before start of study , as defined in [COMPANY_005] Policy/Standard . [COMPANY_005] contact 
[CONTACT_71126], along wi th invest igator’s cit y, state (for America’s invest igators), country , and 
recrui ting status will be registered and available for public viewing. 
As needed, [COMPANY_005] and invest igator/site contact [CONTACT_618572]. In certain situations/registries, [COMPANY_005] may assist 
participants or potential participants to find a clinical trial by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_618497], address, and phone number via email/phone or 
other m ethods callers requesting trial informat ion. Once pat ients receive invest igator contact 
[CONTACT_71126], they  may call the si te request ing enro llment into the trial. The inves tigative sites are 
encouraged to handle the trial inquiries according to their established patient screening process. If 
the caller asks addit ional questions beyo nd the topic of trial enro llment, they should be referred to 
the sponsor. 
Any invest igator wh o objects to [COMPANY_005] providing this informat ion to callers must provide [COMPANY_005]

Molecular CR CR as de ﬁned, plus negative allele -speci ﬁc oligonucleotid e polymerase chain reaction (sensitivity 10-5).
VGPR Serum and urine M -protein detectable by [CONTACT_117169], or ≥90% reduction 
in serum M -protein plus urine M -protein <100 mg/24 hours; in patients for whom only measurable 
disease is by [CONTACT_618542], >90% decrease in difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels, 
in addition to VGPR criteria, is required; 2 consecutive assessments are needed (c).
PR ≥50% reduction of serum M -protein and reduction in 24 -hour urina ry M -protein by ≥90% or to 
<200 mg/24 hours.
If the serum and urine M -protein are not measurable, a ≥50% decrease in the difference between involved 
and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M -protein criteria.
If serum and urine M -protein are not measurable, and serum FLC is also not measurable, ≥50% reduction 
in bone marrow plasma cells is required in place of M -protein, provided the baseline percentage was 
≥30%.
In addition to the above criteria, if present at baseline, ≥50% reduction in the size of soft tissue 
plasmacytomas is also required.
Two consecutive assessments are needed (a) no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if 
radiographic studies were performed.
Minimal response 
(MR) (b)≥25% but ≤49% reduction of serum M -protei n and reduction in 24 -hour urine M -protein by 50% to 89%.
In addition to the above criteria, if present at baseline, 25% to 49% reduction in the size of soft tissue 
plasmacytomas is also required.
No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions (develo pment of compression fracture does not exclude 
response).
SD (c) Does not meet the response criteria for CR (any variant), VGPR, PR, MR, or PD; no known evidence of 
progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed.

ORR=overall response rate; PR=partial response; sCR=stringent complete response; SD=stable disease; VGPR=very good partial 
response.
(a) Clonality should be established by [CONTACT_30432] κλ light -chain restriction on ﬂow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, or 
immuno ﬂuorescence. Bone marrow plasma cell percentage should preferably be estimated from a core biopsy specimen; in case of 
a disparity between the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_170037], the highest value should be used.
(b) For relapse -refractory myeloma only.
(c) These categories do not contribute to the ORR.
Before the institution of any new therapy, sCR, CR, and VGPR categories require serum and urine 
studi es regardl ess of whether disease at baseline was measurable on serum, urine, both, or neither. 
Radiographic studi es are not requi red to sati sfy these response requirements. Bone marrow

b)Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium >11.5 mg/dL) that can be attributed 
solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder.
A diagnosis o f PD m ust be confi rmed by 2 consecutive assessments.
Clarificat ions to IMWG criteria for coding PD: Bone marrow criteria for PD are to be used only in 
patients wi thout m easurable disease by M -protein and by  [CONTACT_128759] l evels; “25% increase” refers to 
M-protein, FLC, and bone marrow r esults, and does not refer to bone lesio ns, soft tissue 
plasmacy tomas, or hy percalcemia, and the “lowest response value” does not need to be a 
confirmed value.

(chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radi ation therapy ) to NCI CTCAE Grade ≤1 or 
baseline , excluding al opecia .
Rationale for Change :
This change was made to clarify that alopecia is not a clinically significant toxicit y that pati ents 
need to recover fro m before entering the study ,
Change 18:DLT assessments and wit hdrawal/replacement of patients were clarified.
The primary  change occurs in Section 8.2Definit ions of DLT :
Added text: Patients who experience a DLT should be withdrawn from study treatmen t 
unless the sponsor approves subsequent treatment in a lower dose cohort; such 
patients will not count as a patient in that lower dose cohort for escalation 
decisions. 
In phase 1, patients who do not receive 4 full doses of TAK -079 within the 28 -day 
(±2) treatment window or the Day 29 (ie, Cycle 2 Day 1) assessment for reasons 
other than a DLT will be replaced. Patients experiencing a DLT should not be 
replaced.
Rationale for Change :
These changes were made to clarify  the study  procedures.

provide sufficient relief, the dose of TAK -079 should be considered for 
permanent discontinuation. 
[New Table 8.b TAK -079 Related Toxicity Management]
A TAK -079 dose held for more than 3 days from the per -protocol administration 
date for any reason other than AEs should be brought to the attention of the 
sponsor/designee as soon aspossible. Subjects missing ≥3 consecutive planned 
doses of TAK -079 for reasons other than AEs should be withdrawn from 
treatment, unless, upon consultation with the sponsor/designee and review of 
safety and efficacy, continuation is agreed upon. A miss ed dose will not be made 
up. Doses of TAK- 079 during every -4-week sdosing may be delayed 
(interrupted) up to 4 weeks. If a dose is delayed (interrupted), then the dates of

1.3 Protocol Amendment 03 Summary of Changes
Rationale for Amendment 03
This document describes the changes in reference to the protocol incorporating Amendment 03. 
The primary  reason for thi s amendment is to allow for an increase in the number of patients 
enrolled to the phase 1 period to further evaluate the safet y, pharmaco kinet ics(PK),  
, to further inform the reco mmended phase 2 dose (RP2D) on the basis o f
available data fro m the dose Escalation Cohorts. Addi tionally , a cohort of pati ents i s being added 
to evaluate TAK -079 combined wit h the backbone regimen of po malidomide and dexamethasone 
(Pom Dex) in patients with relapsed and/or refractory  multiple myelo ma(RRMM )who have 
received at least [ADDRESS_822200] been exposed or are refractory  to 
lenalido mide because of its increase use as init ial therapy. Pom Dex is approv ed for this patient 
popul ation and adding an ant i-CD38 m onoclonal antibody  to it, especially one that is given 
subcutaneously (SC) , coul d be beneficial and convenient for patients. As a result of adding the 
cohort of TAK- [ADDRESS_822201] Risk Evaluation and Mit igation Strategy  (REMS) ,have 
been added. 
Other minor changes were made throughout the protocol for clarificat ion and to ensure 
consistency wit h the majo r changes described above.
Minor grammat ical, editorial, formatting, and administrative changes not affect ing the conduct of 
the study  are included for clarificat ion and administrative purposes only.

TAK -079
Title of Protocol: A Phase 1/2a, Open -label, 
Dose -Escalation Study to Investigate the Safety and 
Tolerability, Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics, and 
Immunogenicity of TAK -079 Administered Subcutaneously 
asa Single Agent in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory 
Multiple Myeloma 
Study Number: TAK -079-1501 Phase: 1/2a
Study Design:
This is a multicenter, dose -escalation, open -label, single -arm, phase 1/2a study designed to determine the safety, 
tolerability, efficacy, PK, and immunogenicity of TAK -079 monotherapy in patients relapsed and/or refractory 
multiple myeloma (RRMM), and to provide a preliminary assessment of its activity against multiple myeloma (MM).
Once enrolled into the study, patients will receive TAK -079 via subcutaneous (SC) administration in each 28 -day 
cycle of treatment, administered as once weekly for 8 weeks (8 d oses), once ever y 2 weeks for 16 weeks (8 doses), and 
once ever y 4 weeks thereafter until disease progression (PD). Patients will receive ongoing treatment with TAK -079 
until PD, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal due to other reasons. 
The phase 1 por tion of the study will evaluate administration of single agent TAK -079 for dose -limiting toxicity  
(DLT) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for further 
assessment in phase 2a. A recommended dose below the MT D may be identified based on the review of safety, 
pharmacokinetic (PK), , and clinical data from the phase 1 portion of the 
study. 
Study Schema Figure :
Dara: daratumumab; PomDex: pomalidomide and dexamethasone; PD:progr essive disease; disease progression;
RP2: recommended phase 2; SC:subcutaneous.
The safety and tolerability of TAK -079 will be assessed by [CONTACT_618512] -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs), dose modifications, treatment discontinuati ons, vital signs, physical examinations, serum chemistry 
and hematology, urinalysis, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and concomitant medications. In phase 1, approximately 6

Protocol Incorporating Amendment 03 02 April 2019
Duration of Treatment:
TAK -079 will be administered until the patient experiences 
PD, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal due to other 
reasons. The maximum duration of treatment is expected to 
be 12 months for patients receiving monotherapy and 
approximately 18 months for patients in the combination 
cohort; however, patients with clinical benefit (per 
investigator and as agreed by [CONTACT_456]’s study clinician) 
can continue on treatment with the explicit approval of the 
sponsor’s study clinician .Period of Evaluation:
21 days screening, ongoing treatment to PD. 
Patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other 
than PD will continue to be followed for 
progression -free survival (PFS) every [ADDRESS_822211]. 
Overall survival (OS): Patients will be followed ever y 
12 weeks until death, loss to follow -up, consent

[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion and Injection Site Reactions
IRs are potentially dose -limit ing AEs, not uncommonly associated with IV administration of 
biologic agents aimed at treating hematologic malignancies [5]. IRs are less frequent ly associated 
with SC inject ion of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The ‘true’ clinical hypersensit ivity react ions, 
antibody -mediated occur after repeat exposure. Symptoms of hypersensit ivity range from mild 
skin rash to more severe reactions, wheezing, hypotension, poor perfusio n, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4047], and 
rarely  death. Non -anaphylactic clinical hypersensitivit y occurs wi thin the fi rst hour; however 
delayed responses were reported. Symptoms of anaphyl axis, a potenti ally life -threatening 
condi tion, range from  swelling, angioedema, bronchospasm, respi[INVESTIGATOR_36645], and shock [
9]. 
There are limited nonclinical and clinical data to date for TAK -079 (Section
 4.2.1 ). Local inject ion 
site abnorm alities have not been observed in monkey and rat nonclinical studies after SC and/or IV 
administration of TAK -079. In the clinical study  of healthy subjects (TAK -079_101), an 
infusio n-related reacti on was defined as a TEAE occurring within 2 hours of the start of an 
infusio n; there were no IRs in this study, as no allergic or cytokine release reactions were observed 
within this t ime period. Mild inject ion site AEs were reported; AEs were Grade 1 and included 
primarily ery thema or tenderness wit h palpi [INVESTIGATOR_332]. All  injecti on si te reacti ons reso lved within a 
few days. 
In thi s study  (TAK -079- 1501) in pat ients with RRMM at doses up to 600 m g (given wi th [ADDRESS_822226] ions), 
no injection site react ions have been reported. 
Patients in clinical trials receiving TAK -[ADDRESS_822227] ion, management may include discont inuat ion of SC administration of 
TAK -079 and/or the administration of appropriate medical therapy . 
See addi tional details for m anaging infusion and inject ion site reactions in Sect ion 8.11.1 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Cytokine Release Syndrome
CRS represents an important IR often associated wit h the use of monoclonal ant ibodies used in 
anti-inflammatory  and ant itumor therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014]. CRS may  occur early in therapy , and often after the 
first infusi on of the drug due to a high -level o f activat ion of the immune system and engagement 
and proliferat ion of T -cells that can result in increased cytokine release. The CRS hallmark is 
fever. CRS also presents with rash, urticaria, headache, chills, fatigue, nausea, and/or vomit ing 
[
10,11] . 
Severe cytokine release syndrome (SCRS) is characteri zed by [CONTACT_4140], often acco mpanied 
by [CONTACT_4141], in addit ion to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria, and angioedema. This 
syndro me may be associ ated wi th som e features of tum or lysis syndrom e such as hyperuricemia, 
hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, acute renal failure, and elevated lactate 
dehydrogenase, and may  be associ ated wi th acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_618462]. The acute 
respi [INVESTIGATOR_33078] m ay be accom panied by [CONTACT_618580] n or

commo n AE reported was upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_103415] (n =3); all were grade [ADDRESS_822230] ions throughout this clinical study 
(see Section 8.11.4 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug Interactions
Nonclinical drug interaction studies have not been conducted with TAK -079. However, as a fully 
human IgG1 monoclonal antibody  (mAb), the risk of drug- drug i nteracti ons is l ow.
[IP_ADDRESS] ADA Interactions
ADA responses were detected in most monkeys in the single -dose PK studies and the 4- week 
(non-GLP) and 13 -week (GLP) toxicology studies. Strong posit ive ADA responses were generally 
associ ated wi th lower serum  concentrati ons of  TAK -079, and this was especially notable in the 
13-week repeat - dose toxi city studi es and at l ower doses.
In the single -dose healt hy subject study  (TAK -079_101), 5 of 54TAK -079–treated subj ects were 
positive for ADA (3 subjects with transient ADA and 2 subjects with persistent ADA). Of these, 
1subject was treated in t he 0.06 mg IV cohort and the remaining 4 subjects were treated with 
either 0.03 mg/kg (2 subjects), 0.1 mg/kg ([ADDRESS_822231]), or 0.6 mg/kg ([ADDRESS_822232]) SC TAK -079. 
Immunogenicit y was not associ ated wi th clinically si gnificant AEs, even in the 2 subjects with 
persistent immunogenicit y.

However, there were no TAK -

stabilization in others. Though addit ional data are needed to characterize the clinical benefit of this 
drug, the emerging data supports the ongoing development of TAK -079.
4.4 Rationale for the Proposed Study
Although mu ltiple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_618463] , this disease remains incurable; 
thus, significant unmet medical need exists for this patient population. Frequent relapses highlight 
a need for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_78937] m prior treatm ents have fa iled. 
TAK -079 binds to unique amino acids of CD38 and possesses a different binding profile than the 
approved cy tolytic ant i-CD38 therapeutic ant ibody daratumumab. 
In the FIH study (TAK -079_101), TAK -079 demonstrated pharmacodynamic effects (ie, cytolysi s 
of NK cells and PBs) fo llowing single -dose administration, with no unexpected and unwanted 
clinical or hematologic effects observed. For example, NK cells were reduced >90% fro m ba seline 
levels in all healt hy subjects receiving a single 0.06 mg/kg IV dos e of TAK -079 and exhibited a 
mean C maxof 0.1 ug/m L (TAK -079_101). Com parable deplet ion of NK cells by [CONTACT_618561] a populat ion of patients with refractory MM [12] required doses of >24 mg/kg 
and a mean C maxof >500 ug/m L [13,14] . Consequent ly, TAK -[ADDRESS_822238] as higher activit y on tum or 
cells (ie, activit y at lower doses, low -volume SC administration, and less frequent administration), 
including activit y on daratumumab -refractory  tumors. The potential a ctivity of TAK -[ADDRESS_822239] igated in patients with relapsed and/or refractory mult iple myelo ma (RRMM).
4.4.1 Rationale for the Starting Dose of TAK
-079
In the FIH study  (TAK -079_101), TAK -079 was well tolerated after SC administration o f 
single- doses ranging fro m 0.03 to 0.6 m g/kg.

TAK -079
Study No. TAK -079-1501 Page 30of 160
Protocol Incorporating Amendment 03 02 April 2019
To avoi d unnecessary  exposure of patients to sub -therapeut ic doses while preserving safet y, the
starting dose for this study  in pati ents wi th RRMM will be 45 mg, the fixed -dose equivalent of 
0.6mg/kg (assuming a body weight of 75 kg), which was the highest SC dose administered in 
Study  TAK -079_101. The 0.6 m g/kg dose was well tolerated in healthy human subjects in Study  
TAK -079_101 and demo nstrated >90% deplet ion of peripheral blood PBs, a surrogate for 
myelo ma cells in each subject (n =6).
TAK -[ADDRESS_822240] itutively 
expressed on plasma cells, PBs, and NK cells, and is induced on activated T cells and B cells [15]. 
Therefore, the ant icipated eliminat ion routes for TAK -079 are via proteoly tic catabo lism and 
intracellular degradation after binding to its target. Both of these clearance mechanisms are not 
thought to be significant ly influenced by [CONTACT_18559]. Addit ionally , the distribut ion volume of 
mAbs is generally  limited to the vol ume of the bl ood and extracellular fluids, such that body  
composition is a l ess important determinant of distribution volume as compared with small  
molecule drugs [
16]. For these reasons, body weight is not expected to have a clinically significant 
effect on the disposit ion of TAK -079, thereby  [CONTACT_618517] -dose 
administration.
The 45 m g starting dose of TAK -079 will be tested in 3 p
atients with RRMM to assess the safet y 
and tol erabilit y of TAK -079 after m ultiple dose administrati on. TAK -079 will be administered 
using the same dosing schedule as the ant i-CD38 ant ibody , daratum umab, which is approved for 
the treatment of patients with MM [5]. Specifically, TAK -079 will be administered once weekly  
for 8 weeks (8 doses), once every  2 weeks for 16 weeks (8 doses), then once every  [ADDRESS_822241] cy cle of the 
previous (sequent ial) cohort has co mpleted.
Addit ional details for dose escalat ion are provi ded in Secti on8.3.
The dose used in the Confirmat ion Cohort and the Combinat ion Cohorts is the expected RP2D 
from the dose Escal ation Cohorts, based on preliminary PK and PD results fro m the dose 
Escalat ion Cohort.
Relevant to the Combinat ion Cohort, l enalidomide is established therapy  in NDMM [
17,18]
therefore patients for whom lenalido mide is no longer a treatm ent opti on, b ecause of previous 
exposure, intolerance, or are refractory  to lenalidomide, represent a clinically relevant populat ion 
with unmet need. Nonclinical studies demonstrate that pomalido mide inhibit s proliferat ion of 
lenalido mide -resistant cells [
19]. Clinically, PomDex, an all oral regimen, is approved for patients 
who have previously receive d lenalido mide [
20]. Adding an anti -CD38 monoclonal ant ibody  to it, 
especially  one that is given SC, coul d be beneficial and convenient to patients as compared withIV 
administered ant i
-CD38 m onocl onal ant ibodies. PomDex will be given at the dose and schedule 
recommended in the product informat ion (Pomalyst USPI [INVESTIGATOR_618504] 14.1) while TAK -079 
will be g iven at the RP2D in the revised schedule described in Section 6.1.

6.0 STUDY DESIGN
6.1 Overview of Study Design
This is a mult icenter, dose -escalat ion, open -label, single -arm, phase 1/2a study  designed to 
determine the safet y, tolerabili ty, efficacy, PK, and immunogenicity of TAK -[ADDRESS_822242] MM. 
The phase 1 portion of the study will evaluate administration of single agent TAK -079 for DLT(s) 
to determine the MTD/RP2D for further assessment in phase 2a. A recom mended dose below the 
MTD may  be ident ified based on safet y, clinical, PK,  data. The safet y and 
tolerabilit y of TAK -[ADDRESS_822243] ivity of the TAK -079 RP2D based on preliminary 
PK/ data. 
More pati ents now receive combinat ions of l enalidomide, bortezomib , dexamethasone wi th or 
without daratum umab as first -line treatment, yet their disease still progresses . Most devel op 
lenalido mide -resistant di sease ;thus,alternat ives to lenalidomide arerequi red in later lines of 
therapy . Pom alidomide wi th dexamethasone is approved for patients fo llowing therapy  with 
lenalido mide and a proteasome inhibitor; however, the duration of response is short 
(7.4months)[20]. Evidence is emerging that adding an IV administered ant i -CD38 agent to 
PomDex can help prolong response duration [23]. TAK -079, a SC administered anti -CD38 
monocl
onal antibody , is showing early signs of antimyelo ma activit y as a monotherapy in pat ients 
with advanced RRMM. Adding TAK -079 to the Pom Dex backbone coul d provi de bene fit to 
patients both in terms of improved antimyelo ma activit y over each agent alone, and would be more 
convenient to patients as co mpared withadministrati on of IV administered ant i-CD38 agents (ie, a 
TAK -079, a SC agent, added to the all oral PomDex regi men). Hence a new cohort will open to 
evaluate this co mbinat ion. Informat ion about the dose, safet y, and act ivity of TAK -[ADDRESS_822244] therapy  will 
be co llected.

better during study , as defined by [CONTACT_42294] ( Appendix E; [ 21,22]). In addit ion, the efficacy of 
TAK -079 will be assessed by [CONTACT_618564], PFS, DOR, and OS; TTR will also be measured. 
Once enro lled into the phase 1 Dose Escalation phase, patients will receive TAK -079 via SC 
administration in each 28 -day cycle of treatm ent, administered as once weekly  for 8 weeks 
(8doses), once every 2 weeks for 16 weeks (8 doses), and once every 4 weeks thereafter until PD. 
Patients will  receive ongoing treatment with TAK -079 until they  experi ence PD, unacceptable 
toxicities, or wi thdraw due to other reasons (see Section 6.3). 
In the phase 1 Confirmation Cohort Phase, patients will receive TAK -079 via SC administration in 
each 28 -day cycle of treatment, administered at a dose of 300 mg once weekly for 8 weeks (8 
doses), once every  2 weeks for 16 weeks (8 doses), and then once every  4 weeks therea fter until

PomDex until they experience PD as defined by [CONTACT_311327]. The maximum durat ion of 
treatm ent is expected to be 12 months for patients receiving monotherapy  and approximately 
18months for patients in the combinat ion cohort; however, patients with clinical benefit (per 
investigator and as agreed by  [CONTACT_456]’s study  clinician) can cont inue on treatment with the 
explicit approval of the sponsor’s study  clinician ( see Secti on 6.3.5 for Posttrial Access). 
Patients will  be evaluated 30±[ADDRESS_822256] dose of TAK -079 (fo llow-up visi t) or before 
initiating subsequent systemic ant icancer the rapy, for detecti on of  any delayed TEAEs.
6.3.2 End of Study/Study Completion Definition and Planned Reporting

to Grade ≤1 or baseline within 7 days.
–Grade 3 IR that responds to symptomat ic treatment (eg, antihistamines, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs), narcotics, IV fluids), without recurrence of Grade 3 
symptoms. See Section 8.11.1 for handling of IRs with systemic signs and symptoms.
Hem atologic TEAEs of NCI CTCAE Grade ≥4, except those events that are clearly  due to 
extraneous causes, and occurring d uring the first cycle will be considered DLTs, with the 
following except ions:
–Grade ≥3 hemo lysis, except those events that are clearly due to extraneous causes 
(eg,negative direct Coombs test), will be included in the definit ion of DLT.
–Grade ≥3 low plate let count with clinically meaningful bleeding, defined as a blood loss of 
>100 cc or the requirement of a blood transfusio n, will be included in the definit ion of 
DLT.
An incomplete recovery  from treatm ent-related toxicit y causing a >2 -week del ay in the ne xt 
scheduled injection before the init iation of Cycle 2 will be considered a DLT.
For the purpose of dose escalation, DLTs are those events meeting the criteria above that occur 
before Cycle 2 Day  1 administrati on. TEAEs meeting DLT definit ions occurring i n later cycles 
will determine the suitabilit y of the MTD as the RP2D.
Patients who experience a DLT should be withdrawn fro m study  treatm ent unl ess the sponsor 
approves subsequent treatment in a lower dose cohort; such patients will not count as a patient in 
that lower dose cohort for escalat ion decisio ns. 
In phase 1, patients who do not receive 4 full doses of TAK -079 wi thin the 28 -day (±2) treatm ent 
window or the Day  29 (i e, Cycle 2 Day  1) assessment for reasons other than a DLT will be 
replaced. Pati ents experiencing a DLT should not be replaced.
Dose and schedule modificat ions for toxi city are described in Section 8.6.

8.6 Dose Modification Guidelines
Dose m odificat ion gui delines for toxi cities are described below for TAK -079 on the basis o f the 
type and severit y of AEs and causalit y determinat ion by [CONTACT_431] (see Section 8.6.2 ).Further 
clarificati on can be obtai ned in consultat ion with the sponsor clinician (or designee).
8.6.[ADDRESS_822290] m eet the following criteria:
Absolute neutrophil count must be ≥1000/mm3.
Platelet coun t must be ≥75,000/mm3.
For therapy  to resum e, toxi city considered to be related to treatment with TAK -[ADDRESS_822291] 
resolved to Grade [ADDRESS_822292] been met. If there is a 
delay of a subsequent cycle lo nger than 28 days because o f a drug -related AE, the patient may 
be wit hdrawn fro m treatment unl ess there i
s clinical  benefit as assessed by  [CONTACT_34462], 
with agreement by  [CONTACT_456]’s m edical  monitor. 
For TAK -[ADDRESS_822293] ions wit hin the same cycle, the decisio n of ho lding treatment is left to the 
investigator’s discret ion based on clinical and analyt ical data, and also based on the toxicit y 
that the patient experienced wit h previous inject ions in the same cycle. The invest igator should 
different iate between acute toxicit y (like an IR) from which the pat ient hasrecovered at the 
time of the next inject ion, and subacute toxicit y (for exam ple, neut ropenia) that might be 
worsened upon another inject ion if it is not on a clear recovery  path. If the dose cannot be 
administered on the scheduled day, the patient can be reviewed at the investigator’s discretio n 
in the fo llowing 48 hours. If TAK -079 cannot be administered within a cycle in this 48 -hour 
window, the dose will be missed and the patient scheduled for the next administration per the 
Schedule of Events (SOE; Appendix A).

resolves to Grade ≤[ADDRESS_822296] wit h administration o f monoclonal 
antibodies as a means to reduce dose intensit y [5,26,27] . Patients experie ncing a DLT (defined in 
Secti on
 8.2) should be withdrawn fro m study  treatment unless the sponsor approves subsequent 
treatm ent in a l ower dose coho rt.
See details for managing specific AEs in Sect ion
 8.11.
Table 8.a Dose Modification Recommendations for TAK -079 Toxicities
Criteria Action
Grade 1 AEs No dose interruptions.
Grade 2 AEs Treat according to local practice. Whether to hold treatment or to continue it 
at the same dose is at the discretion of the investigator.
Patients with Grade 2 AEs considered related to study treatment that are not 
easily  managed or corrected and are not tolerable to the patient, or AEs that 
are not acceptable in the investigator’s judgment, should have study 
treatment interrupted until the AE resolves to Grade ≤[ADDRESS_822297] 
study treatment interrupted until the AE resolves to Grade ≤1 or baseline, 
then resume treatment at the same dose level. (Note Section 8.2for AEs of 
short duration and/or that respond to medical management.) 
Note in phase 1, nonhematologic AEs Grade ≥3 may meet DLT criteria and 
as such patients should be withdrawn from further dosing unless the sponsor 
approves subsequent treatment in a lower dose cohort.
Grade 3 or higher thr ombocyt openia with bleeding should result in a dose 
interruption until the AE resolves to Grade ≤1 or baseline, then resume at the 
same dose. 
Grade 4 (life -threatening) AEs Patients with Grade 4 AEs considered related to study treatment should 
permanentl y discontinue treatment. Grade 4 hematologic toxicity should 
result in study treatment interruption until the AE resolves to Grade ≤1 or 
baseline, then resume at the same dose. 
AEs of all grades If TAK -079 administration does not commence within the pres pecified 
window ( Table 8.b) of the scheduled administration date, then the dose will 
be considered a missed dose. Administration may resume at the nex t planned 
dosing date upon recover y as described above.

If initial dose interruption does not provide sufficient relief, permanent discont inuat ion of 
TAK -079 shoul d be considered.
Table 8.b TAK - 079–Related Toxicity Management
Dosing Frequency Dose Missed Dosing Resumption
Weekly (QW) >3 day s Skip dose, move to next planned weekly dosing date
Biweekly (Q2W) >7 day s Skip dose, move to next planned biweekly dosing date
Every 4 weeks (Q4W) >21 day s Skip dose, move to next planned ever y 4 weeks dosing date
A TAK -079 dose held for more than 3 days from the per- protocol  administrati on date for any  
reason other than AEs should be brought to the attent ion of the sponsor/designee as soon as 
possible. Subjects missing ≥3 consecut ive planned doses of TAK -079 f or reasons other than AEs 
shoul d be wi thdrawn from  treatm ent, unl ess, upon consul tation wi th the sponsor/desi gnee and 
review of safet y and efficacy, continuat ion is agreed upon. A missed dose will not be made up. 
Doses of TAK -079 during every -4-weeks dosing may be delayed (interrupted) up to 4 weeks. If a 
dose i s delayed (interrupted), then the dates of all subsequent doses and assessments must be 
adjusted accor dingly. Any AE deemed to be related to TAK
-079 that requires a dose delay  
(interruption) of more than 28 days should result in permanent discontinuation of TAK -079, unless 
both the investigator and the sponsor study clinicia n believe the patient is derivin g clinical benefit. 
8.6.3 Criteria for Discontinuing TAK -079 in Individual Patients (When Considering Dose 
Modification)
TAK -[ADDRESS_822298] igator consider s re-treatment of the patient not to be dangerous and the 
sponsor approves subsequent treatment in a lower dose cohort. For Grade 4 (life -threatening) 
TEAEs, consider permanent ly wit hdrawing the patient fro m the study , except ifthe invest igator 
determines that the pati ent is receiving clinical benefit, there are opportunit ies to provide 
supportive care to mit igate risk for the Grade 4 event to reoccur, and this approach (ie, the specific 
situation and mi tigation plan)has been discussed with the sponsor. I n these circumstances, 
treatm ent m ay be restarted when toxicit y recovers to Grade ≤1 or baseline (see Table 8.aand 
Table 8.b).
8.7 Dose Modification Considerations f or Patients in the Phase 1 Combination Cohort 
(TAK -079–PomDex Cohort) Only 
TAK -079 (study  drug) will be given as noted in Section

PomDex will be procured by  [CONTACT_618586].
8.7.[ADDRESS_822299] of Care Agents
All toxicit ies that occur during the study will be actively managed fo llowing m edical standard 
of care unless otherwise specified in the protocol.
Toxicit ies should be attributed, whenever possible ,to a specific drug (TAK -[ADDRESS_822300] chemotherapy agents pomalidomide or dexamethasone, as applicable ) so that dose 
modificati ons can be made rationally. Reduct ion of 1 agent and not others is appropriate if 
toxicity is considered to be related primarily  to one of the agents. If m ultiple toxi cities are 
attributed to an individual agent (study  drug or stan dard chem otherapy  agent), dose 
adjustm ents shoul d be made according to the guidelines for the most severe toxicit y. 
Toxicit ies attributed to pomalido mide or dexamethasone, as applicable, should be managed 
according to the relevant guidelines in the respec tive product informat ion [20,28] .
Once dose reduction has been implemented, unless otherwise stated specifically in the relevant  
product informat ion and after discussio n with the Sponsor Study  Clinician (or designee), dose 
re-escalation should not occur. 
8.8 Excluded Concomitant Medications and Procedures
The fo llowing m edicat ions and procedures are prohibited during the study :
Chem otherapy  and radi ation therapy  for the disease under study . Local  radiotherapy  for bone 
pain is permitted after agreement with the sponsor ’s medical mo nitor and once PD is ruled out.
Systemic corti costeroi d use >10 m g/day  (prednisone or equivalent). 
Live vaccines.
Any invest igational agent other than TAK -079, including agents that are commercially 
available for indicat ions other than MM tha t are under invest igation for the treatment of MM.
8.9 Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures 
All necessary  supportive care consistent with optimal patient care will be available to patients 
as necessary . During study  treatm ent, all bl ood products a nd concomitant medications 
received unt il 30 days after the final dose will be recorded in the electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs) (note addit ional informat ion in Section
 9.4.9 and Appendix A) .
The fo llowing m edicat ions and procedures are permitted while the patient is receiving the 
study  drug:

antig
lobulin test (Indirect Coombs test). A daratumumab -mediated posit ive indirect antiglo bulin 
test m ay persist for up to [ADDRESS_822302] daratumumab infusio n. Daratumumab bound to 
RBCs masks detecti on of ant ibodies to minor ant igens in the patient’s serum. The determination o f 
a patient’s ABO and Rh blood type are not affected. It is possible TAK -[ADDRESS_822303] the results 
of these blood tests ;this is being evaluated. Until those tests are kn own, i t is recommended that 
baseline ty pe and serol ogical screening be established before starting TAK -079. Pati ents shoul d 
keep these results in case future transfusio ns are needed. Blood transfusio n centers should also be 
inform ed of this interference wi th serol ogical testing as necessary .
Fluid deficit sshoul d be corrected before init iation of treatment and during treatment.
NSAIDs should be avo ided with impaired renal funct ion given the reported NSAID -induced rena l

8.11 Management of Specific Adverse Reactions
8.11.1 Handling of IRs
Patients shoul d be carefully  observed during TAK -079 injections. Trained trial staff at the clinic 
shoul d be prepared to intervene in case of any  systemic IRs and resources necessary  for 
resuscitat ion (eg, agents such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_618468]; also medical 
equipment such as oxygen tanks, tracheostomy equipment, and a defibrillator) must be available at 
bedside.
In case of an IR (a ny grade), blood draws should be performed for central evaluat ion of 
 
, ADAs, . These draws must not interfere with patient care and 
blood tests necessary for the acute care of the patient. 
For addi tional details, re fer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Grade 1 or 2 IR
In case of Grade 1 or 2 IRs (sy stemic signs or symptoms): 
Withhold therapy (also administration of remain ing SC inject ions when full dose was not yet 
reached) until reso lution to Grade [ADDRESS_822307] igator’s 
discreti on. 
oIf a patient experiences a Grade [ADDRESS_822308] igator’s 
discreti on, resum e SC inject ions to achieve the full dose level. The remaining 
inject ions must be given [ADDRESS_822309] igator’s discretion, resume SC inject ions to achieve the full dose 
level. The r emaining injections must be given 30 minutes apart, and the patient will be 
evaluated for IRs after each SC injection.
–Patients who experience IRs must be treated according to the investigator’s judgement and 
best clinical practice. Subsequent doses may ha ve individual SC inject ions administered 
more frequent ly at the invest igator’s discret ion with appropri ate premedicat ion and 
postm edicati on.

Grade 3 IR
In case of Grade 3 IRs (sy stemic signs or symptoms): 
Withhold therapy (also administration of remaining SC inject ions if full dose was not y et 
reached and therefore skip remaining injection[s]) unt il next scheduled TAK -079 SC 
administration, providing that the IR has recovered to Grade ≤[ADDRESS_822310] be treated accordi ng to the 
investigator’s judgement and best clinical pract ice. At the time o f the next dose after an IR, 
patients at a dose level requiring more than [ADDRESS_822311] ion 
30minutes apart. If no further IR, subsequent injections may  be given m ore frequent ly at the 
investigator’s discret ion with appropri ate premedicati on and postmedicat ion.
Perm anent ly discontinue treatment after the third occurrence of Grade 3 IRs.
Grade 4 IRs
In case of Grade 4 IRs (sy stemic signs or symptom s): 
Perm anent ly discontinue treatment.
8.11.2 Injection Site Care
Prophylactic postinjection site care:
Apply corticosteroid cream topi[INVESTIGATOR_618491](s) and apply ice locally for 
approximately  10 to 15 minutes (report the corticosteroid cream as a concomitant medicat ion).
Addit ional inject ion site care may be provided on the basis o f signs and symptoms per invest igator 
discreti on (report any  actions as a concomitant medicat ion).
8.11.3 Handling of Low Platelet Counts
Treatment dec isions will be based on patient platelet coun ts assessed before any transfusio n. Low 
platelet counts (Grade 4) should cause scheduled treatment to be postponed or to be permanent ly 
discontinued if recovery  is delayed m ore than 14 days (see Table 8.a). If at any  time the platelet 
count i s less than 10×109/L, or if the patient shows a bleeding tendency considered to be due to 
thrombocy topenia occurring aft er init iation of TAK -[ADDRESS_822312] are recommended. These pat ients (that 
is, th ose who have platelets <10×109/L if recovery is delayed more than [ADDRESS_822313]) should be considered as

development of drug dependency  or drug abuse; any  organism , virus, or infecti ous parti cle 
(eg, prion protein transmitt ing transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or 
nonpathogenic, is considered an infect ious agent.
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  lab abnormalit y, will be determined using the 
NCI CTCAE, Versi on 4. 03, effective date 14 June 2010 [25].Clarification should be made 
between an SAE and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms 
serious and severe are not synonymous. The general term severe is often used to describe the 
intensity (severi ty) of a specif ic event; the event itself, however, may  be of  relatively minor 
medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is not the same as serious , which is based 
on pati ent/event outcome or action criteria described above, and usually associated with even ts 
that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to functi on. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not 
necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to 
<2000 mm3is considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be co nsidered serious. Seriousness (not 
intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory  reporting obligations.
10.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_53341]/or in response to an open question fro m study 
personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examinat ion, or other diagnostic procedures will be 
recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section
 10.3 for the period of observat ion). Any 
clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an 
AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a commo n underlying patho logy shoul d be 
noted as 1 comprehensive event.
Regardless of causality, SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Section
 10.1) must be 
reported (see Section
 10.3 for the peri od of  observati on) by [CONTACT_231941] (contact [CONTACT_51259]). This should be

and the causalit y of the event in rel ation to study  procedures.
Severit y (toxicit y grade) for each AE, including any lab abnormalit y, will be determined using the 
NCI CTCAE, version 4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010 [25]. The criteria are provided in the Study 
Manual.
Relationship of the event to study  drug administratio n (ie, its causali ty) will be determined by  [CONTACT_618587] y es (rel ated) or no (unrelated) to this quest ion: “Is there a reasonable 
possibilit y that the AE is associated with the study  drug?”
10.3 Monitoring of AEs and Period of Observation
AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be mo nitored throughout th e study  as fo llows:
AEs will be reported from the signing of informed consent through [ADDRESS_822346] dose of study  drug and recorded in the eCRFs. AEs ongoing at EOT should be monitored 
until they are resolved, return to baseline, are cl early  determined to be due to a patient’s stable or 
chronic condit ion or intercurrent illness(es), the start of next-line subsequent anticancer therapy, or

15.2 Patient Information, Informed Consent, and Patient Authorization
Written consent documents will embody  the elements of informed consent as described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. The ICF, patient authorizat ion form (if applicable), and patient 
inform ation sheet ( if applicable) describe the planned and permitted uses, transfers, and 
disclosures of the patient’s personal and personal health informat ion for purposes of conducting 
the study. The ICF and the patient informat ion sheet (if applicable) further explain the nature of the 
study , its obj ectives, and potential risks and benefit s, as well as the date informed consent are 
given. The ICF will detail the requirements of the participant and the fact that he or she is free to 
withdraw at any  time wi thout giving a rea son and wi thout prej udice to hi s or her further m edical 
care.
The invest igator is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the ICF 
and if applicable, the patient authorizat ion form. The ICF, patient authorizat ion form (if 
applic able), and patient information sheet (if applicable) must be approved by [CONTACT_178059].
The ICF, patient authorization form (if applicable), and patient informat ion sheet (if applicable) 
must be written in a language fully comprehensible to the prospective pat ient. It is the 
responsibilit y of the invest igator to explain the detailed elements of the ICF, patient authorizat ion 
form (if applicable), and patient informat ion sheet (if applicable) to the patient. Information sho uld 
be given in both oral and wr itten form whenever possible and in the manner deemed appropriate by 
[CONTACT_4186]. In the event the patient is not capable of rendering adequate written informed 
consent, then the patient’s legally  acceptable representati ve m ay provi de such consent for the 
patient in accordance with applicable laws and regulat ions.
The patient, or the patient’s legally acceptable representative, must be given ample opportunit y to: 
(1) inquire about details of the study and (2) decide whethe r or not to participate in the study. If the 
patient, or the pati ent’s l egally acceptable representative, determines he or she will part icipate in 
the study , then the ICF and pat ient authorizat ion form (if applicable) must be signed and dated by 
[CONTACT_11581] t, or the patient’s legally acceptable representative, at the time o f consent and prior to the 
patient entering into the study. The pat ient or the patient’s legally acceptable representative should 
be instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknam es, using blue or black ballpo int ink. The 
investigator must also sign and date the ICF and patient authorization (if applicable) at the time o f 
consent and prior to patient entering into the study; however, the sponsor may allow a designee o f 
the invest igator to si gn to the extent permitted by  [CONTACT_1289].
Once signed, the original ICF, patient authorizat ion form (if applicable), and pat ient informat ion 
sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the investigator’s site file. The investigator must document 
the date the patient signs the informed consent in the patient’s medical record. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_4082], the si gned patient authorizat ion form (if applicable), and pat ient information sheet (if

15.3 Patient Confidentiality
The sponsor and designees affirm and upho ld the principle of the patient’s right to protection 
against invasio n of privacy. Throughout this study , a pati ent’s source data wil l only  be linked to 
the sponsor’s clinical study  database or documentation via a unique ident ificat ion number. As 
permitted by [CONTACT_39823], limited patient attributes, such as sex, age, or date 
of birth, and patient init ials may be used to verify the pat ient and accuracy  of the pati ent’s unique 
ident ificat ion number.
To com ply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify co mpliance with this protocol, the sponsor 
requi res the investigator to permit its monitor or designee’s monitor, rep resentatives fro m any 
regul atory  authori ty (eg, the FDA, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory  Agency ,

Molecular CR CR as de ﬁned, plus negative allele -speci ﬁc oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (sensitivity 10-5).
VGPR Serum and urine M -protein detectable by [CONTACT_117169], or ≥90% reduction 
in serum M -protein plus urine M -protein <100 mg/24 hours; in patients for whom only measurable 
disease is by [CONTACT_618542], >90% decrease in difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels, 
in addition to VGPR criteria, is required; 2 consecutive assessments are needed (c).
PR ≥50% reduction of serum M -protein and reduction in 24 -hour urinary M -protein by ≥90% or to 
<200 mg/24 hours.
If the serum and urine M -protein are not measurable, a ≥50% decrease in the difference between involved 
and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M -protein criteria.
If serum and urine M -protein are not measurable, and serum FLC is also not measurable, ≥50% reduction 
in bone marrow plasma cells is required in pl ace of M -protein, provided the baseline percentage was 
≥30%.
In addition to the above criteria, if present at baseline, ≥50% reduction in the size of soft tissue 
plasmacytomas is also required.
Two consecutive assessments are needed (a) no known evidence o f progressive or new bone lesions if 
radiographic studies were performed.
Minimal response 
(MR) (b)≥25% but ≤49% reduction of serum M -protein and reduction in 24 -hour urine M -protein by 50% to 89%.
In addition to the above criteria, if present at baseline, 25% to 49% reduction in the size of soft tissue 
plasmacytomas is also required.
No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of compression fracture does not exclude 
response).
In this study, in patients that have myeloma measurable by [CONTACT_320272], MR will be defined as 
a reduction of ≥25 but ≤49% in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels.
SD (c) Does not meet the response criteria for CR (any vari ant), VGPR, PR, MR, or PD; no known evidence of 
progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed.

[IP_ADDRESS] Hematologic Effects
Reductions in platelets, lymphocy tes, and RBCs occurred in nonclinical studies in some animals 
administered doses of TAK -079 higher than the NOAEL of 0.3 mg/kg . The NOAEL was based 
on occurrence of thrombocytopenia in 1 of 14 monkeys and is believed to be species specific. 
In the TAK -079 FIH (TAK -079_101) and RRMM (this study TAK -079- 1501) at doses up to 
600 mg, no decrease in platelet counts below the lower limit of normal related to TAK-079

mitigate the inherent risks in clinical studies of TAK -079, patients will be carefully 
monitored closely for signs and symptoms of systemic and injec tion site reactions with 
appropriate management of these events. Guidance for the management of AEs are 
provided in Section 8.11. Depending on the severity of the reaction, drug dosage can be 
reduced by [CONTACT_203841] (holding or delaying) of the schedu led treatment within a cycle 
as provided in Section 8.6, and may include discontinuation of TAK -079.

4.4.1 Rationale for the Starting Dose of TAK-079
…..
The dose used in the Confirmation Cohort and the Combination Cohorts is the expected 
RP2D from the dose Escalation Cohorts, based on preliminary PK and PD results from the 
dose Escalation Cohort.
Relevant to the Combination Cohort, lenalidomide is established therapy in NDMM [17,18] 
therefore patients for whom lenalidomide is no longer a treatment option, because of 
previous exposure, intolerance, or are refractory to lenalidomide, represent a clinically 
relevant population with unmet need. Nonclinical studies demonstrate that pomalidomide 
inhibits proliferation of lenalidomide -resistant cells [19]. Clinically, PomDex, an all oral 
regimen, is approved for patients who have previously received lenalidomide [20]. Adding 
an anti -CD38 monoclonal antibody to it, espe cially one that is given SC, could be beneficial 
and convenient to patients as compared with IV administered anti -CD38 monoclonal 
antibodies. PomDex will be given at the dose and schedule recommended in the product 
information (Pomalyst USPI [INVESTIGATOR_618508] 14.1) while TAK -079 will be given at the 
RP2D in the revised schedule described in Section 6.1.

6.0 STUDY DESIGN
6.1 Overview of Study Design
...
The phase 1 portion of the study will evaluate administration of single agent TAK -079 for DLT(s) 
to determine the MTD/RP2D for further assessment in phase 2a. A recommended dose below the 
MTD may  be ident ified based on safet y, clinical, PK,  data. The safet y and 
tolerabilit y of TAK -[ADDRESS_822406] not 
progressed following daratumumab, in an effort to more fully understand the activity of 
TAK -079 in patients who represent the highly heterogeneous po pulation seen in current 
clinical practice. Before enrolling into the phase 2a phase of the study, additional patients 
will be enrolled in a dose Confirmatory Cohort to better understand the safety and clinical 
activity of the TAK -079 RP2D based on prelimi nary PK/  data. 
More patients now receive combinations of lenalidomide, bortezomib, dexamethasone with 
or without daratumumab as first -line treatment, yet their disease still progresses. Most 
develop lenalidomide -resistant disease; thus, alt ernatives to lenalidomide are required in 
later lines of therapy. Pomalidomide with dexamethasone is approved for patients following 
therapy with lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor; however, the duration of response is 
short (7.4 months) [20]. Evidenc e is emerging that adding an IV administered anti -CD38 
agent to PomDex can help prolong response duration [23]. TAK -079, a SC administered 
anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, is showing early signs of antimyeloma activity as a 
monotherapy in patients with advan ced RRMM. Adding TAK -079 to the PomDex backbone 
could provide benefit to patients both in terms of improved antimyeloma activity over each 
agent alone, and would be more convenient to patients as compared with administration of 
IV administered anti -CD38 ag ents (ie, a TAK -079, a SC agent, added to the all oral PomDex 
regimen). Hence a new cohort will open to evaluate this combination. Information about the 
dose, safety, and activity of TAK- [ADDRESS_822407] backbone regimen of PomDex in 
Property of [COMPANY_005]: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use
TAK -[ADDRESS_822408] therapy will be collected. 
The preliminary efficacy o f TAK-079079, as monotherapy and when added to PomDex, will be 
evaluated by m easuring the ORR, defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a PR or 
better during study , as defined by  [CONTACT_42294] (Appendix E; [ 17,18 21,22 ]). In addit ion, the efficacy o f 
TAK -079 will be assessed by  [CONTACT_618564], PFS, DOR, and OS; TTR will also be measu red. 
Once enro lled into the studyphase 1 Dose Escalation phase , pati ents will receive TAK -079 via 
SC administration in each 28 -day cycle of treatm ent, administered as once weekly  for 8 weeks (8 
doses), once every  2 weeks for 16 weeks (8 doses), and once e very 4 weeks thereafter until PD. 
Patients will  receive ongoing treatment with TAK -079 until they  experi ence PD, unacceptable 
toxicities, or withdrawal withdraw due to other reasons (see Section 6.3). 
In the phase 1 Confirmation Cohort Phase, patients will receive TAK -079 via SC 
administration in each 28 -day cycle of treatment, administered at a dose of 300 mg once 
weekly for 8 weeks (8 doses), once every 2 weeks for 16 weeks (8 doses), and then once every 
4 weeks thereafter until PD.
In this cohort, up t o 6 patients that are refractory to an anti -CD38 agent will be enrolled.
Further in this cohort, approximately [ADDRESS_822409] RRMM disease (per prior 
therapy inclusion criteria Section 7.0) and are naïve to an anti -CD38 agent will be 
enrolled.
Inthe Combination Cohort, patients will receive TAK- 079 via SC administration in each 
28-day cycle of treatment, administered at a dose of 300 mg once weekly for 8 weeks (8 
doses), once every 2 weeks for 16 weeks (8 doses), and then once every [ADDRESS_822410] labeling (Pomalyst UPSI, 
including Section 14.1).
 In this cohort, up to 6 patients will initially be enrolled. Safety in Cycle 1 will be 
reviewed in accordance with DLT definitions in S ection 8.2.
 If 0 of 6 or 1 of 6 patients develop a DLT an additional 12 patients will be tested at the 
initial dose of TAK -079 [[ADDRESS_822411] been exposed to a prior anti
-CD38 agent], for an overall total of 18 patients.
 If [ADDRESS_822412] (See details in Section 8.5).

8.6.2 8.4.2 Criteria for Dose Modification
....
Table 8.a Dose Modification Recommendations for TAK -079 Toxicities
Criteria Action
Grade 1 AEs No dose interruptions.
Grade 2 AEs Treat according to local practice. Whether to hold treatment or to continue it 
at the same dose is at the discretion of the investigator.
Patients with Grade 2 AEs considered related to study treatment that a re not 
easily  managed or corrected and are not tolerable to the patient, or AEs that 
are not acceptable in the investigator’s judgment, should have study 
treatment interrupted until the AE resolves to Grade ≤[ADDRESS_822437] 
study treatment interrupted until the AE resolves to Grade ≤1 or baseline, 
then resume tr eatment at the same dose level. (Note Section 8.2 for AEs of 
short duration and/or that respond to medical management.) 
Note in phase 1, nonhematologic AEs Grade ≥3 may meet DLT criteria and 
as such patients should be withdrawn from further dosing unless the sponsor 
approves subsequent treatment in a lower dose cohort.
Grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia with bleeding should result in a dose 
interruption until the AE resolves to Grade ≤1 or baseline, then resume at the 
same dose. Medical considerations should eliminate Coombs positivity 
before restarting (note Table 8.b).
Grade 4 (life -threatening) AEs Patients with Grade 4 AEs considered related to study treatment should 
permanently discontinue treatment. Grade 4 hematologic toxicity should 
result in study treatment interruption until the AE resolves to Grade ≤1 or 
baseline, then resume at the same dose. Medical consideration should 
eliminate Coombs positivity before restarting (note Section 8.4.3 and Table 
8.b).
AEs of all grades If TAK -079 administration does not commence within the prespecified 
window (Table 8.b) of the scheduled administration date, then the dose will 
be considered a missed dose. Administration may resume at the next planned 
dosing date upon recover y as described above.
AE=: adverse event; DLT =: dose-limiting toxicity.
8.7 Dose Modification Considerations for Patients in the Phase 1 Combination Cohort 
(TAK -079–PomDex Cohort) Only
TAK -079 (study drug) will be given as noted in Section 8.5 through 8.6.3.
Dexamethasone administered IV or orally at 40 mg/day on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, or 20 
mg/day given on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for patients over 75 years of age (Pomalyst USPI, 
Section 14.1).

Pomalidomide is a standard of care agents and will be given in accordance with 
product labeling ( Pomalyst USPI).
Treatment cycle will be [ADDRESS_822438] labeling until PD or unacceptable 
toxicity.
PomDex will be procured by [CONTACT_51233].
8.7.[ADDRESS_822439] of Care Agents
All toxicities that occur durin g the study will be actively managed following medical 
standard of care unless otherwise specified in the protocol.
Toxicities should be attributed, whenever possible, to a specific drug (TAK -[ADDRESS_822440] chemotherapy agents pomalidomide o r dexamethasone, as applicable) 
so that dose modifications can be made rationally. Reduction of 1 agent and not others is 
appropriate if toxicity is considered to be related primarily to one of the agents. If 
multiple toxicities are attributed to an indivi dual agent (study drug or standard 
chemotherapy agent), dose adjustments should be made according to the guidelines for 
the most severe toxicity. 
Toxicities attributed to pomalidomide or dexamethasone, as applicable, should be 
managed according to the r elevant guidelines in the respective product information 
[20,28].
Once dose reduction has been implemented, unless otherwise stated specifically in the 
relevant product information and after discussion with the Sponsor Study Clinician (or 
designee), dose re-escalation should not occur. 
8.9 8.6 Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures 
All necessary  supportive care consistent with optimal patient care will be available to 
patients as necessary. During study treatment, all blood products and concomitant medicat ions 
received unt il 30 days after the final dose will be recorded in the electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs) (note addit ional informat ion in Section 9.4.9 and Appendix A).
The fo llowing m edicat ions and procedures are permitted while the patient i s receiving the 
study  drug:
– For patients in the Combination Cohort (TAK-
079–PomDex) only: patients 
must adhere to the pregnancy prevention program (Pomalyst REMS).

8.10 8.7 Precautions and Restrictions
An interference with serological testing has been described with the anti -CD38 antibody 
daratumumab [23]. Daratumumab binds to CD38 on RBCs and results in a positive indirect 
antiglobulin test (Indirect Coombs test). A daratumumab -mediated positive indirect 
antiglobulin test may persist for up to [ADDRESS_822441] daratumumab infusion. 
Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the 
patient’s serum. The determination of a patient’s ABO and Rh blood type are not affected. 
It is possible TAK -[ADDRESS_822442] the results of these blood tests; this is being evaluated. 
Until those tests are known, it is recommended that baseline type and serological screening 
be established before starting TAK -079. Patients should keep these results in case future 
transfusions are needed. Blo od transfusion centers should also be informed of this 
interference with serological testing as necessary.
Fluid deficit deficits shoul d be corrected before init iation of treatment and during treatment.

IMWG Uniform Criteria for Response [ 17,18,2421,22,33 ]
Category of 
Response Response Criteria
sCR Criteria for CR as defined below, with the addition of a normal FLC ratio, and an absence of clonal plasma 
cells by [CONTACT_128756] 2- to 4-color flow cytometry; 2 consecutive assessments of laboratory 
parameters are needed (a).
CR Negative immuno fixation of serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and <5% 
plasma cells in bone marrow; bone marrow; in patients for whom only measurable disease is by [CONTACT_618573], normal FLC ratio of 0.26 to 1.65 in addition to CR criteria i s required; 2 consecutive 
assessments are needed (b).
Immunophenotypic 
CRsCR as defined, plus absence of phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_598376] (clonal) in bone marrow with 
minimum of 1 million total bone marrow cells analyzed by [CONTACT_618543] ﬂow cytome try (with >4 
colors).
Molecular CR CR as de ﬁned, plus negative allele -speci ﬁc oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (sensitivity 10-5).
VGPR Serum and urine M -protein detectable by [CONTACT_117169], or ≥90% reduction 
in serum M-protein plus urine M -protein <100 mg/24 hours; in patients for whom only measurable disease 
is by [CONTACT_618542], >90% decrease in difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels, in 
addition to VGPR criteria, is required; 2 consecutive assessments are needed (c).
PR ≥50% reduction of serum M -protein and reduction in 24 -hour urinary M -protein by ≥90% or to <200 
mg/24 hours.
If the serum and urine M -protein are not measurable, a ≥50% decrease in the difference between involved 
and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M -protein criteria.
If serum and urine M -protein are not measurable, and serum FLC is also not measurable, ≥50% reduction 
in bone marrow plasma cells is required in pl ace of M -protein, provided the baseline percentage was 
≥30%.
In addition to the above criteria, if present at baseline, ≥50% reduction in the size of soft tissue 
plasmacytomas is also required.
Two consecutive assessments are needed (a) no known evidence o f progressive or new bone lesions if 
radiographic studies were performed.
Minimal response 
(MR) (b)≥25% but ≤49% reduction of serum M -protein and reduction in 24 -hour urine M -protein by 50% to 89%.
In addition to the above criteria, if present at baselin e, 25% to 49% reduction in the size of soft tissue 
plasmacytomas is also required.
No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of compression fracture does not exclude 
response).
In this study, in patients that have myeloma measurable by [CONTACT_320272], MR will be 
defined as a reduction of ≥25 but ≤49% in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC 
levels.
SD (c) Does not meet the response criteria for CR (any variant), VGPR, PR, MR, or PD; no known evidence of 
progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed.

CR=: complete response; FLC =: free light chain; IMWG =: International Myeloma Working Group; MR =:minimal response; 
ORR =: overall response rate; PR =: partial response; sCR =: stringent complete response; SD =: stable disease; VGPR =: very good 
partial response.
(a) Clonality should be established by [CONTACT_30432] κλ light -chain restriction on ﬂow cytometry, immunohisto chemistry, or 
immuno ﬂuorescence. Bone marrow plasma cell percentage should preferably be estimated from a core biopsy specimen; in case of 
a disparity between the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_170037], the highest value should be used.

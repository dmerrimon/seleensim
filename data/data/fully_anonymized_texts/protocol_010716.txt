Research Summary Version Date: 1/8/2018 1.  Protocol Title:   Femoral Peri-arterial Local Anesthetic Injection Decreases Tourniquet Associated Ischemic Hypertension.  2.  Purpose of the Study:   The goal of this prospective randomized double-blind study is to determine if an ultrasound guided peri-arterial injection of local anesthetic around the femoral artery decreases ischemic hypertension associated with prolonged lower extremity tourniquet time.  Efficacy will be determined by [CONTACT_740977], defined as >30% increase in systolic blood pressure, associated with tourniquet inflation times greater than [ADDRESS_1012976]-operative numerical pain scores (NRS 11) and perioperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556].  English speaking ASA 1-3 patients ages 18-75 years old undergoing total ankle arthroplasty (TKA) will receive both popliteal-sciatic and adductor canal nerve blocks with perineural catheters with 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_740968]. Patients will then undergo femoral peri-arterial injection with either 1.5% mepi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 1:400,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_73803] 0.9% saline. Data will be analyzed on an intent to treat basis using a two-sided t-test (parametric) or Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxson (non-parametric) with a p-value <0.05 as significant.    3.  Background & Significance:  The use of pneumatic tourniquets to provide a bloodless field is a common technique in orthopedic surgery. Although typi[INVESTIGATOR_740969], prolonged tourniquet duration over 60 minutes often leads to marked increases in both heart rate and blood pressure [1]. This phenomenon has been referred to as tourniquet hypertension. Incidence varies depending on tourniquet time, location, and site of tourniquet [1] . In a retrospective study of 699 patients undergoing surgery with a pneumatic tourniquet, the general anesthesia subgroup had an incidence of 66.7% [2]. Through these studies, tourniquet hypertension has been defined as an increase in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure (SBP or DBP) 30% above baseline. Etiology of tourniquet hypertension is controversial and not completely understood.  Tourniquet pain is thought to arise from uninhibited C fiber activation in the context of decreased inhibition from A-δ fibers. A-δ fibers are inhibited by [CONTACT_740978] [3]. Some authors have argued tourniquet pain comes from compression of skin and have shown subcutaneous local infiltration and EMLA cream can improve tolerance of tourniquet [4, 5].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_740970], tourniquet pain and hypertension can be present even with adequate sensory levels during spi[INVESTIGATOR_561138] [6].  Another study has shown that combined femoral and proximal sciatic nerve blockade does not reduce incidence of tourniquet hypertension when compared to femoral and popliteal sciatic nerve blocks in surgeries utilizing a below knee tourniquet [7].   A possible reason for tourniquet pain and hypertension despi[INVESTIGATOR_740971], including C fibers, which are carried on the femoral artery [8].  For this reason, we propose an injection of local anesthetic between the femoral artery and femoral vein would block perivascular sympathetic nerve fibers. In a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 10 patients undergoing TKA who received 
 
Research Summary Version Date: 1/8/2018 periarterial local anesthetic, we found that tourniquet hypertension, which we define as an increase in SBP of 30% above baseline, was prevented in all patients.          4.  Design & Procedures:   Preoperatively, patients will be given 975mg acetaminophen by [CONTACT_1966].  This medication may be altered or omitted depending on patient comorbidities or extenuating factors such as allergy/intolerance. Study interventions will begin preoperatively. Patients will receive up to 2mg midazolam IV and 100mcg fentanyl IV.   As standard of care at Duke Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], patients will then undergo ultrasound guided adductor canal and popliteal sciatic peripheral nerve blocks with 20 mL of 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_740972]-operative analgesia.   Patients will be randomized into either femoral peri-arterial block or sham group with an online randomization program by [CONTACT_9154] (WMB) prior to any patient enrollment.  Patients will be given a unique study number (1-30), and the randomized numbers will be given to a key study personnel member (JG) that will be unblinded. The intervention drug, either 10mL 1.5% mepi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 1:400,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_740973] 10mL 0.9% saline for sham group, will be drawn up by a key personnel member of the study team who is unblinded and will not be involved in the femoral peri-arterial block or post-operative analysis.  This person will supply the regional anesthesiologist with the intervention, however, both the regional anesthesiologist performing the block and the patient will be blind as to the contents of the syringe.  Patients will then be taken to the operating room where they will undergo general anesthesia for the surgical procedure.  General anesthesia is the standard of care for foot and ankle surgery.  Induction will consist of 1-2mg/kg IV propofol after which a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) will be placed.  Maintenance will be achieved with sevoflurane.  A bispectral index (BIS) monitor will be used and sevoflurane will be titrated to a BIS value between 40 and 60. After induction, a bolus of 10mg IV dexamethasone (will not be given in diabetic patients) will be administered.    Presence of tourniquet hypertension, defined as an increase in systolic or diastolic blood pressure by 30% or more during tourniquet inflation will be recorded. Esmolol will be given in 20mg boluses if SBP rises >30% baseline, and will be given until SBP returns to normal (<20% baseline).  At conclusion of the case, LMA will be removed and the patient will be taken to post-operative care unit (PACU).  In PACU, patients will have post-operative orders for supplementary pain control that include 0.2mg IV hydromorphone for pain scores 5-7 and 0.4mg IV hydromorphone for pain scores 8-10. Subjects’ verbal pain scores and opi[INVESTIGATOR_740974].  Additionally, gross motor function for both quadriceps will be assessed 1 hour after extubation.  These scores will be entered into a Duke REDCap database.  5.  Selection of Subjects:

Research Summary Version Date: 1/8/[ADDRESS_1012978]:  Subjects will not incur any additional costs to participate in the study.  A MaestroCare build will be created to ensure that any subjects are not charged for researched related procedures, equipment, or medications.  12. Data Analysis & Statistical Considerations:  A double blinded randomized trial of 30 subjects (15 per group), assuming a rate of hyperextension of 20% in the placebo group, will provide 82% power to detect a 50% decrease in the rate of tourniquet hypertension in the treatment group in a chi-square test at alpha level 0.05. Sample size and power calculations were performed using PASS v15 (NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah).   Patient and surgical characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_740983] t-tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, chi-square tests, or Fisher exact tests as appropriate. A chi-square test and logistic regression models will be used to assess the effect of treatment on rate of hyperextension. We will report odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values to assess significance and clinical importance of the observed treatment effect.  Additional measures of treatment efficacy (range of motion, pain scores, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]) will be summarized overall and between groups to further characterize the treatment effect in this population.  Randomization schedules will be prepared using mixed block sizes in nQuery and significance will be set at 0.05 for all analyses.   13. Data & Safety Monitoring:   In accordance with federal regulations the PI [INVESTIGATOR_147427], review, and promptly report to the IRB, appropriate institutional officials, sponsor, coordinating center and the appropriate regulatory agency head all unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others that occur in the course of a subject’s participation in a research study (45 CFR 46.103(b)(5)(i) and 21 CFR 56.108(b)(1)), all AE reports will be reported per the DUHS IRB policies. PI [INVESTIGATOR_740975].  14. Privacy, Data Storage & Confidentiality  Potential subjects and their families will be approached in private rooms.

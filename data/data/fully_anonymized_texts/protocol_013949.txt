2 STUDY DESCRIPTION
2.1 Study Design
This is a mult i-center, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind study  of cont inuous 48 -hour 
intravenous (IV) infusio ns of  BMS- [ADDRESS_1031408] to 
clinically relevant hy potensi on. 
The study  consists of 2 parts, each with a unique cohort of subjects. 
Subjects that are randomized in Part I of the study  will not be allowed to participate in Part II. 
In Part I (Cohort 1) of the study , approximately 100 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 rati o to 
placebo or an escalat ing dose of BMS-986231 (3g/kg/min for 4hours, then 6g/kg/min for 
another 4 hours, then 12 g/kg/min for the remaining 40 hours).

986231 6g/kg/min and BMS -986231 12 g/kg/min, will be administered. Approximately  210 
subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the 2 active doses o f BMS -
986231 or placebo.
If BMS -986231 12 g/kg/min is not considered to be a tolerated dose in Part I, then BMS -986231 
3g/kg/min and BMS -986231 6g/kg/min will be evaluated in Part II. In the event that neither 6 
g/kg/min nor 12 g/kg/min are tolerated, the protocol will require modification.
The study  design schemat ic is presented in Figure 2.1-1for Part I (Cohort 1) and Figure 2.1-2for 
Part II (Cohort 2).

2.2 Treatment Assignment
At the time of screening for both Part I (Cohort 1) and Part II (Cohort 2), each subject will be 
assigned a unique sequent ial subject number by [CONTACT_753417] (IRT). The IRT 
will be available [ADDRESS_1031412] of a unique 
5digit number which is assigned sequent ially within a study  (starting with [ZIP_CODE]) by [CONTACT_6606]. 
This number will be us ed for ident ificat ion throughout the study and will not be used for any other 
subject. Subjects screened for Part I, (Coh ort 1) will be assigned sequential  study numbers 
beginning with [ZIP_CODE], and subjects screened for Part II, (Cohort 2) will be assigned sequent ial 
study  numbers beginning wit h [ZIP_CODE].
Randomization schedules will be generated by [CONTACT_753418]. Subjects who 
meets the inclusio n/exclusio n criteria will be randomly assigned by [CONTACT_753419]-986231 (3 - 6 - 12 μg/kg/min) in a 1:1 ratio for Part I (Cohort 1) and 
placebo or 1 of the 2 active dose levels of BMS- 986231 in a 1:1:1 ratio for Part II (Cohort 2).
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_433784]: North America, Europe, and Latin 
America (Argent ina only) .
2.3 Blinding and Unblinding
The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC; see Sect ion 2.5.1) will assess safet y on an ongoing basis, 
and will have access to unblinded treatm ent codes for individual subjects. An analysis team , 
including a reporting statistician and programming support, who are not invo lved with the conduct  
of the study , will  provide analyses to the DMC.
Two interim analyses will be performed in this study (see
 section 7.11).
The first unblinded interim analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_753420] 120 in Part I (Cohort 1). This analysis will be reviewed by [CONTACT_753421] (see Secti on 2.5) and Sponsor 
representatives. The rationale for a fully unblinded review by [CONTACT_753422] 12 μg/kg/ min is an appropri ate dose to study  in Part II.
The second interim analysis will  be perf ormed following complet ion of the last visi t at Day  32 in 
Part II (Cohort 2). The study  analysis team  will then provi de top -line results to the project team.

2.5 Data Monitoring Committee and Other External Committees
2.5.1 Data Monitoring Committee
An independent DMC will review safet y data to ensure safetyof subjects in the trial . The full role 
of the DMC will be defined in a separate DMC charter. The DMC will review unblinded 
accumulat ing data on a regul ar basis and make recommendat ions to BMS and the Execut ive 
Committee regarding subjects current ly enrolled and yet to be enrolled in the trial. T he DMC ma y 
recommend suspensio n of enrolment or early t erminat ion of the trial for safet y reasons. See Section
 
7.11 for addi tional information.
The DMC will consider available endpo int information, in addition to safet y events, before making 
any study  stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_753407], as per gui delines 
set forth in the DMC charter.
2.5.2 Executive Committees
The executive committee will be a small body comprised of academic leaders . The executive 
committee will provide advice on overall design, study  endpo ints and reco mmendat ions for study 
sites, and will review results from interim and final analyses with Sponsor .

5 SAMPLE SIZE AND POWE R
For Part I (Cohort 1), approximately 50 subjects per group will be randomized to placebo or an 
incremental dose of BMS-986231 (3 - 6 - 12 μg/kg/min). Under a sample decisio n rule (eg, 
observed doubling wit h more than a 4% difference) and assuming clinically relevant hypotension 
incidences of 5% or 10% in the placebo group, the posterior probabilit ies of detecting an increa se 
of 4-fold or 3-fold in incidence, respectively, are 86% and 80%, respectively. If there is no increase 
in clinically relevant hypotensi on, then the posterior probabili ties of  falsely detecting an increase 
are 11 -12%.
For Part II (Cohort 2), approximatel y 70 subjects per group will be randomized to placebo or one 
of the two active dose levels of BMS -986231. Under a sampledecisio n rule (eg, observed 1.8 -fold 
increase with more than a 3% difference) and assuming clinically relevant hypotension incidences 
of 5% or 10% in the placebo group, the posteri or probabili ties of detecting an increase of 3-fold 
or 2.5-fold in incidence, respectively, are 82% and 80%, respectively. If there is no increase in 
clinically relevant hypotensio n, then the posterior probabili ties of falsely detecting an increase are 
13-15%. These probabilit ies do not reflect mult iple com parison.
With regards to overall performance for selection of a maximally  tolerated dose, a sam ple size of 
50 per group for Part I (Cohort 1), alongwith 70 
per group for Part II (Cohort 2) will ident ify a

7.5 Efficacy
7.5.1 Primary E fficacy Analysis
There is no primary efficacy  analysis for this study.The primary safet y analysis is discussed in 
Secti on 7.6.1 .
7.5.2 Secondary Efficacy Analysis
NT-proBNP will be summarized descript ively for all treated subjects by [CONTACT_753427], as well as change from baseline. Geometric mean and coefficient of variation (%CV) will 
also be presented for the ori ginal  values and percent of baseline .
The NRS is an ordinal scale of 0 to 10. A score of 0 represents “ I am not breathl ess at all ” and 10 
represents “ I am the m ost breathl ess I can possibly imagine ”.
To incorporate the correlations among NRS assessments at different time points and an appropriate 
representation of effect of baseline assessments, the change from baseline at time point t(Hour  
24, 48, and 72) in NRS assess ments will be analyzed using a longitudinal repeated measures 
method. The model will include treatm ent, regi on and time as fixed effects and baseline value as 
covari ate. Furthermore, interaction terms of time by [CONTACT_3148], time by [CONTACT_244945] n and time by [CONTACT_753428]. An unstructured variance -covari ance matri x for the NRS assessments 
within same subject will be used (Autoregressive structure will be used if the model does not 
converge wit h unstructured matrix.). The SAS®procedure PROC MIXED w ill be used.
After obtaining the estimates of mean change from baseline at time point t in NRS assessments, 
the mean change in AUC within a treatment group or difference in mean change in AUC between 
treatm ent groups will be estimated within the framework of the mixed model, using the formula 
based on the Trapezoidal rule:
where ytiis the estimate of mean change from baseline at target time tiin a treatm ent group for 
estimat ion of mean change in AUC within treatment group, and for estimat ion of difference in 
change in AUC between treatment groups, ytiis the estimate of mean difference between treatment

The incidence of clinically relevant hypotension from  the start to 6 hours after the end of study 
drug infusio n will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148]. Point estimates and 95% confidence interval ( CIs)
for event rates will be presented by [CONTACT_3148], together with point estimates and 95% CIs for the 
risk difference and relative risk between each BMS -[ADDRESS_1031428] method. The 95% confidence intervals for the relative 
risk and risk difference will beobtained using an exact procedure that inverted the 2-sided test 
statist ics (Agrest i and Min, 2001)1.
The event rate is calculated as the number of subjects experiencing at least one clinically relevant 
hypotension from the start to 6 hours after the endof study drug infusion, divided by [CONTACT_753429].
The incidence of symptom atic hypotension up to 6 hours  after the end of study drug infusio n, as 
well as the incidence of SBP < 90 mm Hg (confirmed by a repeated measure) will be analyzed and 
presented in the same manner as the primary  endpoint.
7.6.2 Other Safety Analyses
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
All reported deaths after a subject is enrolled (i.e., has signed the informed consent) will be listed 
separately  by [CONTACT_1130].
Percentage of subjects who have died (all-cause and CV related) through Day [ADDRESS_1031429] heart failure hospi [INVESTIGATOR_753412] y through Day 
32 will be analyzed and presented in the same manner as the primary  endpoint , respectively .
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
All reported serious adverse events (SAEs) will be listed by [CONTACT_79075] (SOCs) and 
Preferred Terms (PTs) for all enrolled subjects. SAE s with onset time from the start of study 
treatm ent, up to and including 32 days after the start of study treatment will be included in the 
summary tables . 
SAEs will be coded and grouped into PT by [CONTACT_2946] (see sect ion [IP_ADDRESS] ).

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
All AEs will be coded and grouped into PT by  [CONTACT_2946], using current versio n of Medical Dict ionary 
for Regul atory  Activit ies (MedDRA). All AEs will be summarized and listed by [CONTACT_753430].
Non-serious AEs with onset time from the start of study  treatm ent, up to and including [ADDRESS_1031430] igator’s assessment of severi ty and relati onship to study drug. Addit ional 
listings will be provided for adverse events leading to discontinuation and adverse events without 
recorded resol ution. Summaries of adverse events will include adverse events, adverse events by 
[CONTACT_753431].  
Where a subject has the same adverse event, based on preferred termino logy, reported multiple 
times in a single analysis period, the subject will only be counted once at the preferred termino logy 
level in adverse event frequency tables.
Where a subject has mult iple adverse events within the same system  organ class in a single analysis 
period, the subject will only be counted once at the system organ class level in adverse event 
frequen cy tables.
When a subject has the same adverse event, based on preferred termino logy, reported multiple 
times in a single analysis period, the following criteria, in order of precedence, will be used to 
select the event to be included in summary tables:
Relationship to study  medicat ion
Intensit y of event
Onset date and time
When reporting adverse events by [CONTACT_243696] y, in addition to providing a summary table based on the 
event selection criteria detailed above, summary tables will also be provided based on the most 
intense event during the analysis period -independent of relationship to study  medicat ion. For 
these tables, the following criteria, in order of precedence, will be used to select the event to be 
included in summary tables:

unplanned visits in a mo nitored healthcare setting with a le ngth of stay < [ADDRESS_1031435] visit at Hour 120 in Part I (Cohort 1). The analysis will include 
data for all Cohort [ADDRESS_1031436] Hour 120. The DMC, Executive Commit tee and 
representatives from the Sponsor will assess hypotensio n, as well as addit ional safet yinformat ion, 
in addit ion to any available endpo int events. The outcome will determine whether 12 μg/kg/min is 
a sufficient ly tolerated dose to be used in Part II (Cohort 2). The dose select iondecisio n for Part

8 CONVENTIONS
8.1 Safety Data Conventions
Except as noted in Section 7.6, safety  data will be handled according to the BMS safet y data 
convent ions. This docum ent includes descript ions on how to analyze AE data as well as how to 
handle partial dates, missing dates, and unknown end dates when analyzing safet y data. If onset 
time of AEs is missing or inco mplete, the onset date of AEs will be used to determine if the AEs 
will be included in the AE summary  tables as foll ows.
Non-serious AEs will be included in summary  tables if the onset date is on or after the start 
date of study  treatm ent and not later than the date of Hour 120.
Serious AEs will be included in summary tables if the onset date is on or after the start date of 
study  treatm ent and not later than the date of Day 32.
Clinically releva nt hypotension defined in the primary endpo int consists of two components which 
are further clarified as fo llow:
The component of “SBP < 90 mmHg (confirmed by a repeated value < 90 mmHg)” will be 
ident ified by a SBP measurement < 90 mm Hg with confirmato ry SBP measurement < 90 mm 
Hg within 30 minutes after the initial qualifying value. If a confirmatory  SBP is missing, the 
initialSBP will be treated as confirmed if no SBP measurement ≥ 90 mm Hg wit hin 30 minutes 
exists. The assessment time of the initialSBP < 90 mm Hg will include time fromstart of 
infusio n, up to and including 6 hours after end of infusio n.
The confirmatory  measurement shoul d be within 15 minutes; however, a window of up to 30 
minutes will be applied, to determine if a qualifying confirmatory value is obtained .
The component of “symptoms of hypotension” will be identified by [CONTACT_753438] m 
(other than“low blood pressure ”)from the CRF page collect ing signs and symptom s of low 
blood pressure with onset time fromstart of infusion, up to and including 6 hours after end of 
infusio n
This clarificat ion is also applied to the safet y endpoints “The incidence of symptom atic 
hypotension up to 6 hours after the end of study drug infusio n, as well as the incidence of SBP 
< 90 mmHg (confirmed by  a repeated value) ”.
Subjects counted in the endpo int “Percentage of subjects with discont inuation due to symptomat ic 
hypotension” are those who have “Hypotensi on” as the reason for discont inuat ion and have a 
symptom  (other than “lowblood pressure ”)from the CRF page collecting signs and symptoms of 
low blood pressure with onset time on or before the time of dose discont inuat ion. 
Subjects counted inthe endpoint “Percentage of subjects with down -titrations, interruptions or 
disconti nuations as a result of low blood pressure, either protocol specified clinically relevant  
hypotension, or asymptomat ic decreases” are those who have ‘Hypotension’ as the reason for rate 
reducti on, infusio n interruption ordiscont inuat ion.

Vital signs (bl ood pressure and heart rate) are assessed at Hours 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 5 (fo rPart I only), 
6, 8, 9 (forPart I only), 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 96, 
120, and Day 32. The hour ranges for the analyses of vital signs are defined in the same manner
as in Table 8.3-1to Table 8.3-4. The hour ranges around planned measurement times are based on 
themidpoin t between planned measurement times , for example , Hour Ranges for Hour 24 is ≥ 
Hour 23 to < Hour 26.Hour Ranges for Hour 120 are ≥ Hour 108 to ≤ Hour 132. The value
collected at the Day [ADDRESS_1031440] to 
the target day for that nominal visit will be used; in the case o f a tie, the measurement obtained on 
the earlier day will be used in the analyses.

31For tabul ations of incidence o f marked abnormalit ies (e.g. ALT > 3xULN), if mult iple laboratory 
measurements are obtained wit hin the same no minal visit, the n the worst measurement within the 
nominal visit window nominal visit will be used.
Vital Signs and ECGs
If multiple vital sign or ECG measurements are obtained within the same nominal visit, then the 
measurement obtained on the day closest to the target day for that nominal visitwill be used; in 
the case of a tie, the measurement obtained on the earlier day  will be used in the analyses.
8.5 Pharmacokinetic Summaries
In-text Tables
For in -text pharmacokinet ic tables, coefficient of variation (%CV) will be repo rted as integers. For 
other statist ics except for standard deviat ions, values of 100 or higher will be presented as integers, 
values of 10 -<[ADDRESS_1031441], and values o f 1 -< [ADDRESS_1031442] asma concentrati on-time data, concentrations that are less than the lower 
limit of quant ificat ion (LLOQ) shoul d be di splayed as “< LLOQ” in the list ings and be treated as 
missing in summary  tables and pl ots.  
All available plasma concentrati on-time data will be included in the PK data set and listed 
accordingly.
Treatment of Outliers
Individual plasma concentrati ons, if deemed to be anomalous, may  be excluded from  the analysis 
following a review o f available documentation (e.g., bioanaly ticalreport, clinical data). Any  such 
exclusio n will be clearly listed in the study  report alo ng with just ificat ion for exclusion.
Entireplasma concentrati on-time profiles for a subject may be excluded following review of 
available docum entati on (e.g., bioana lytical report, clinical data). However, resul ts of analysis with 
and without the excluded profiles may be presented in the study  report. Any such exclusi on will 
be clearly  listed in the study  report al ong wi th justificat ion for exclusio n.
PK Exclusio ns2
PK Analysis, Reporting, and Exclusio n criteria shoul d follow the BMS PK Harm onizat ion 
docum ent Versi on 3.0. 
9 CONTENT OF REPORTS
Statistical components for the clinical study  report will be based on the content of this statistical 
analysis plan (SAP). Detai ls of the tabl es, list ings, and figures to be prepared for interim analyses 
and the final CSR will be included in a study -specific Data Presentation Plan (DPP).

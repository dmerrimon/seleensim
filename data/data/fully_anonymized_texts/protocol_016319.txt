 BACKGROUND  
The number of subcutaneous implantable cardio verter -defibrillator s (S-ICD) being 
implanted is steadily increasing; however , an important limitation to ado ption of this 
technology is the perception for the need to admit patients overnight for pain management 
after device implantation.[ADDRESS_355450] implemented an 
institutional protocol to allow same- day discharge following S -ICD implantation, and S -ICD 
implantation is currently performed on an outpatient basis. The purpose, therefore, of this 
protocol is to complete a prospective evaluation of an outpatient analgesia protocol in 
consecutive patients undergoing S -ICD implantation.   
 
STUDY OBJECTIVES A ND ENDPOINTS  
Objectives  
To prospectively evaluate the same day discharge protocol for patients undergoing S -ICD 
implantation . 
Primary Endpoint  
1. Rate of successful completion of S -ICD implantation and discharge of the patient on 
the same day the  device is implanted using the analgesia proto col. 
4 
 Secondary Endpoints  
1. Procedure complication (failed implantation, infection, hematoma/bleeding, etc…) 
within 30 days of procedure . 
2. Serial assessment of patient perception of pain using the graded integer pain scale of 
0-10 
3. Side effects related to medical therapy of protocol . 
4. Time from beginning of recovery (defined as when the patient enters the recovery 
room) to the time of discharge from the recovery unit.  
5. [ADDRESS_355451] discharge.  
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
The primary endpoint is rate of successful completion of device implantation and discharge 
of the patient on the same day that the S -ICD device is implanted .  The estimated success of 
the protocol is ≥85%.  
Although it is anticipated that the patient will be discharged about [ADDRESS_355452] procedure, if the patient requires a longer period of time but then is discharged on the same day, this 
outcome would be consid ered a successful completion of the protocol.  Time from entry into 
the recovery area to the time of discharge will be collected.  Patients who are enrolled in the study and begin the protocol but then transition to being admitted overnight  will be 
conside red a failed protocol, even if the patient is discharged within 24 hours of the 
5 
 procedure. The enrollment rate is expected to be 2 - 3 patients per month for 18 months, with 
enrollment completed at the Ohio State University  Wexner Medical Center  (OSUWMC).  
In addition to the data collated to complete the primary and secondary endpoints, other data 
to be collected by [CONTACT_291204]: age, gender, body mass index , creatinine, etiology of cardiac disease, indication for 
S-ICD therapy ( primary vs secondary prevention) , epi[INVESTIGATOR_291193], epi[INVESTIGATOR_291194], [LOCATION_001] Heart Association ( NYHA )  Heart 
Failure Classification, left ventricular ejection fraction, th e American Society of 
Anesthesiologists ( ASA)  classification, Mallampati score, presence of other comorbidities 
(valvular disease and if so which type, presence of congenital heart disease and if so which 
type, sleep apnea , pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
requirement for oxygen supplementation, chronic kidney disease, Eisenmenger's syndrome, 
atrial fibrillation/flutter , diabetes, hypertension, stroke, liver disease), and ambulatory 
medical therapy (beta  blockers,  calcium channel blockers, ACE I or ARBs , antiplatelet, 
anticoagulants and use of Class I, II I antiarrhythmics or amiodarone, and pain medications ).   
Intraoperative parameters to be collated are vital signs, oxygenation and carbon dioxide every 5 minutes f rom prior to induction until the patient leaves the implantation / 
electrophysiology laboratory following extubation, and duration of intubation.  Anesthestic 
parameters to be recorded are methods of induction, type and doses of inhaled and 
intravensous anesthetics and analgesics, as well as dose and type of local anesthetic.   The 
number of defibrillation testing and energy utilized will also be recorded.

STUDY PROTOCOL  
Patient Identification & Consent  
Patients will be approached for participation in the study once they have been consented for 
implantation of the clinically indicated S -ICD.  Patients will be approached for participation 
by [CONTACT_291205], electrophysiology research team or by [CONTACT_291206].  The protocol will be reviewed with the patient and if agreed, the 
patient will sign consent and begin the protocol before initiation of therapy for the S -ICD 
implantation.   As clinically indicated, a transthoracic echocardiogram or cardiac MRI will be 
reviewed for each patient.  
Study Protocol  
A multi -modal approach to analgesia is needed for timely discharge of p atients after S -ICD 
implantation . The main criteria for discharge will be a combination of hemodynamic stability 
and adequate analgesia in the post- implantation period .

 Assessment of Pain  
Pain assessment will be completed at defined points of care using the peer -reviewed pain 
perception scoring system, the 0 -10 Numerical Pain Rating Scale (N PRS).2 The N PRS grades 
pain on a scale of 1  to10.  A  pain score  of 1 equates to mild pain, a pain  score of 5 equates to 
moderate pain,  and a pain score of 10 equates to severe pain score .2 Notably, the N PRS pain 
scoring system  has been adopted for the assessment of pain after surgery at Ohio State 
University.   The pain perception tool is provided below:  
 
 
The Pain Perception Assessment questionnaire will be completed:  
1. Baseline – defined as completion of the pain perception scale on a day prior to the 
procedure or on the day of the procedu re but before placement of an intravenous 
catheter.  
2. Within [ADDRESS_355454] implantation (phone call)  
4. [ADDRESS_355455] implantation (phone call)  
5. [ADDRESS_355456] implant (phone call)  

[ADDRESS_355457] implantation (in -person device check) at OSU device clinic  
 
Pre- Procedure  
Patients will arrive to the pre- / post - procedure preparation and recovery area ( “IPR unit” ) 
about [ADDRESS_355458] 
proced ure.  If these parameters are not met and cannot be arranged before discharge, then 
the patient will not complete the study protocol and will be deemed a primary endpoint 
failure.  
If not already compliant with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361], a history and physical will be completed by [CONTACT_291207] (CBC, Chem 6 and INR). A 
peripheral IV will be placed.  IV antibiotics in accordance with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_291199].   
Pre-procedure analgesia will be given to each patient as follows:  
1. Acetaminophen [ADDRESS_355459]: monitored anesthesia care versus  general anesthesia care.1,4,[ADDRESS_355460] assessment and oxygenation/carbon dioxide will be monitored 
and documented every [ADDRESS_355461].  
Local Anesthesia:  The ideal local anesthetic for S -ICD implantation is yet to be determined. 
Most clinicians use 1% lidocaine with has a very rapid onset but a very short duration of 
action,  and offers minimal post- procedure analgesia. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_14072] a very long -acting local 
anesthetic  which will provide significant post- implantation analgesia (6-8 hours); however, 
due its delayed onset of action of ~ [ADDRESS_355462] local 
anesthetic solution for S -ICD implantation to ensure rapid onset of anesthesia and prolonged 
analgesia.8,9 This com bination of local anesthetics  (lidocaine/bupi[INVESTIGATOR_211749])  has a 
proven efficacy and safety margin.8,9 
- Create a 50: 50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]; which will 
result in a concentration of 1% lidocaine and 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].8,9 
Administer 2.5 mg/kg (equivalent to 1 ml/kg) of the 50:50 solution of 2% 
11 
 lidocaine and 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_291200] a field block at the pulse generator can and 
the parasternal lead tunneling sites. Considering that the maximum allowed 
dose of lidocaine is 4.5 mg/ kg whereas the maximum allowed dose of 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_14072] 3 mg/kg, the study patients  will be dosed with 2.5 mg/kg which 
will allow a safety margin of 0.5 mg/kg for bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] 2.0 mg/kg for 
lidocaine.[ADDRESS_355463] will assess 
patients for hemodynamic stability and adequate analgesia (pain score less than 5  or return 
to preoperative pain level in patients with chronic pain)  before discharge. Vital signs will be 
documen ted approximately every [ADDRESS_355464].  
 
Preparing for Discharge  
Starting at ≈ [ADDRESS_355465] procedure, the patient will then enter the “ Preparation for 
Discharge ” phase. The modified Aldrete scoring system will be used to determine eligibility 
for discharge home.10 Patients with an Aldrete score ≥ 9 (score system described below) will 
be deemed eligible for discharge home.  
[ADDRESS_355466] ambulatory discharge criteria per the OSUWMC postanesthesia care 
policy statement will be applied by [CONTACT_291208], akin to all ambulatory surgery patients 
at OSUWMC . If the above discharge parameters (DP)  are not meet, the patient will be 
reassessed every 30 minutes until parameters are satisfied. Once the patient satisfies the DP, the patient will complete the Pain Perception Questionnaire and be assessed for ambulation, 
eating/drinking and for understanding of post discharge instructions.  The electrophysiology 
device nursing staff will review management of the S -ICD incision, device and post discharge 
care instructions with the patient and with the accompanying family member(s)/friend.  The patient will be given instructions regarding management of pain and will be provided the 
following prescription for outpatient pain control:  
1. Percocet 5mg/325 mg (1 tablet every 6 hours). A 2- day supply will be given.  
Also, the patient will be provided a phone number to contact [CONTACT_291209]/concerns.   

[ADDRESS_355467] S -ICD implantation.  At our OSUMC, 
S-ICD implantations are already routinely performed on an outpatient basis without 
mandatory overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Same -day discharge p atients are  managed for pain 
control as an outpatient in a similar manner as an inpatient.  Additionally , the 
hemodynamic parameters and the Aldrete score ≥ 9 are demonstrated to result in safe 
discharge of patients undergoing surgical procedures at OSUMC.  
 
The study protocol will be stopped early if: (1) the rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_291201] 30 days of 
the procedure is >15%; and,  (2) rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_291202] a complication 
from the S -ICD procedure attributable to being discharged on the same day of device 
[ADDRESS_355468] device implantation.  
Publications  
The goal of this study is to produce 2 manuscripts.  One manuscript will focus upon the same day discharge protocol and will be submitted to an electrophysiology journal.  The second 
manuscript will focus upon the anesthesia aspects of care with data stratified by [CONTACT_291210] (general vs monitored anesthesia care), and this manuscript will be submitted to an anesthesia journal.

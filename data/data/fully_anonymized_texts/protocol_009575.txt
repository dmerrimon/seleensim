A. SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is defined as “a bump, blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that 
disrupts the normal function of the brain.”1 Each ye ar, more than 2.7 million U.S. people sustain a TBI.1 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_358079], there are no U.S . standards of care for patients with 
moderate- to-severe TBI discharged home from acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358080].2 Research 
suggests up to 65% of patients with moderate- to-severe TBI (age < 65 years) nationwide are discharged home 
from acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358081] a fragmented environment that does not integrate healthcare, community, and 
social services.[ADDRESS_446689] difficulty managing t he patient’s care and needs.4–9  
 
Transitional care is defined as actions in the clinical encounter designed to ensure the coordination and continuity of healthcare for patients transferring between different locations or levels of care in close 
geographic proximity.
10 There are many factors that contribute to gaps in the transition from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21104], 
including inadequate planning, insufficient patient/family education, and limited and fragmented access to 
essential services.[ADDRESS_446690] -discharge care coordination, and c ommunity -
based service referrals.14–16 Currently , there are no transitional care standards for TBI.  The discharge 
home from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358082] ;10–12,16 –18 however, the current state of “usual care”  has limited provider support 
or engagement to help patients and families navigate and access fragmented health and community -based 
services,19,20 is ineffective in improving functional outcomes ,21 and does  not incorporate family needs.22–24  
 
Thus, t he purpose of our study is to develop, examine the feasibility and acceptability, and assess the 
preliminary efficacy of a patient - and family -centered TBI transitional care intervention to support patients with 
moderate- to-severe TBI and their family caregivers during the transition home from acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422].  
 
The proposed specific aims are:  
 
Specific Aim 1 : To develop and refine a patient - and family -centered TBI transitional care 
intervention . The intervention will aim to improve functional status for patients with TBI , reduce strain for 
family caregivers , and direct patients and families to appropriate resources and care that is concordant with 
their health- related goals . We will use a combination of existing clinical guidelines, our  prior and ongoing 
research,  and a scopi[INVESTIGATOR_358083] . We will 
create a manualized, intervention protocol that will undergo iterative user -testing with 6 focus groups (total 
45-60 people) of  patients with TBI, famil ies, and healthcare providers to determine acceptability  and to 
refine to ensure the intervention meets specific needs and preferences  of patients with TBI and families . 
 
Specific Aim 2 : To examine the feasibility and acceptability  and assess the preliminar y e fficacy of 
the TBI transitional care intervention . The intervention will be tested with [ADDRESS_446691] -
discharge (using Functional Status Examination) .[ADDRESS_446692]’s focus on repair and recovery 
of function in patients with TBI and behavioral modifications of patients with TBI and families. As directed by 
[CONTACT_358124], the preliminary data generated from this proposed research will guide 
our team in designing and conducting an NIH R01 implementation- effectiveness clinical trial of the TBI 
transitional care intervention. Our team’s program of research has the potential to enhance the standard of care for patients with TBI discharged home from acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358084].    
RESEARCH STRATEGY  
 
B. SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Devastating Effects of TBI.  Annually, more than 275,000 people sustain a moderate or severe TBI 
that requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272]  >2 days immediately after injury.1 For those receiving TBI acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422], 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_358085], s killed nursing facilities, or home.31 After acute 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422], patients with TBI would ideally receive interdisciplinary, inpatient rehabilitation before returning 
home.3 Yet, up to 65% of patients with moderate- to-severe TBI nationwide are discharged directly home from 
acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358086].[ADDRESS_446693] are 
racial/ethnic minorities.[ADDRESS_446694] significant 
physical, mental, and social challenges that prevent return to pre- injury levels of functioning6: 43% have long -
term disabilities,37 55% become depressed,38 and 60% never return to work.[ADDRESS_446695] tremendous 
implications for families of patients with TBI, especially for patients who were in school or working, may not yet be financially secure, and/or have small children.
[ADDRESS_446696] TBI is also very expensive at multiple 
levels: the annual cost of TBI care is $76.5 billion,1 of informal caregiving is $6.[ADDRESS_446697] productivity 
due to low rates of return to work equates to $521 million.42 Recovery from TBI is a significant public health 
problem with harmful effects at multiple levels.  
Unmet Family Needs after TBI. Family members of patients with TBI play a maj or role in supporting 
patients after discharge,43 yet, families report 30- 60% of their needs after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358087]7–[ADDRESS_446698] substantial unmet mental health needs.4,47 
However, there is limited knowledge on family needs during the transition from acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358088], 
which is needed to provide guidance on how to manage the person with TBI’s care and support their family.  
Gaps in Clinical Guidelines on Discharge and Follow- Up of Patients with TBI. There are gaps in 
clinical guidelines related to transitional care of patients with TBI, regardless of severity, discharged home from 
acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422]. Although m ultiple  U.S. g uidelines have been published on care of patients with mild, 
moderate, or severe TBI ,48–[ADDRESS_446699], clinical guidelines from the [LOCATION_008] (U.K.) do address transitional care needs related to discharge and follow -up of patients with 
TBI; the U.K. National Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines on discharge and follow -up of 
children, young people, and adults with head injury provide detailed guidance for  healthcare providers involved 
in caring for patients with TBI in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358089].
53 The terms head injury 
and TBI are often used interchangeably.54 Although there are differences in health systems in the U.S. and the 
U.K., the patient population described in the U.K. NICE clinical guidelines are similar to the U.S. patients with 
moderate- to-severe TBI that are the focus of our study; the NICE clinical guidelines can provide a foundation 
for development of TBI transitional care interventions.  
Limitations of Current  Transitional Care Research . Effective trans itional care can bring important 
benefits to patients and families. Transitional care interventions tested with patients with stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure have been effective in improving health outcomes and reducing disability and readmissions.
12,55 However, the transition needs of patients with TBI discharged home from acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358090]: patient cognitive functioning, complex medical needs, and limitations in activities of daily living; 
family difficulty in managing care; and fragmented care and services with limited provider support.2,7,19,20,56  The 
few available TBI transitional care interventions were ineffective in improving functional outcomes for all 
patients with TBI;21 these interventions also did not include family needs or address patient and family behavior 
change or self -efficacy.21–24 In addition, the strength of evidence on TBI transitional care interventions is low 
due to shortcomings in study design and analysis, like : 1) lack of sufficient power to determine effectiveness12 
and 2) use of multiple primary outcomes, which increases risk of false- positive errors.57 The transition from 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358091] e is a critical period where appropriate supports and resources are necessary 
to increase the likelihood of successful recovery;[ADDRESS_446700] interventions to improve the TBI transition from acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358092].  
Preliminary Research Related to Transitional Care of Patients with TBI and Their Families. Our 
team’s research provides evidence of the need for interventions to support the unique issues12,15 of patients 
with TB I and families in the transition home from acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422],4, 47 as well as effectiveness of transitional 
care interventions in improving functional s tatus and quality of life in other patient populations.12,15 Table 1 
summarizes the 12 studies our research team has conducted, design/analytic approaches used, and key 
findings. Our team’s research shows patients with TBI and families could benefit from interventions during the 
transition home that address issues with: 1) patient safety, independence, cognition, and communication; 2) 
management of the patient’s mental health, over all health and wellness, and medications; 3) family needs; 4) 
access to community resources; and 5) behavior change and health- related goal  activation . However, we have 
not yet developed or assessed  the feasibility, acceptability, or preliminary efficacy of a transitional care 
intervention that addresses the above -listed areas , and research is limited on these topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] .

Ongoing Research Related to TBI Transition al Care . [CONTACT_358135] (PI [CONTACT_4007] R03) is currently PI [INVESTIGATOR_358095] [co- investigator [CONTACT_358136] ] funded by [CONTACT_358126]. The aim of the study is to 
obtain perspectives of patients with TBI, families, and providers on needs and goals during the transition from 
acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358088]. Findings will inform development of the TBI transiti onal care intervention. [CONTACT_358138] is currently co- investigator of  the Comprehensive Post -Acute Stroke Services (COMPASS) study, a [ADDRESS_446706] -
acute care model on patient -centered outcomes for patients with stroke.16 Patients with stroke discharged from 
intervention hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358096] a 2- day telephone follow -up; a comprehensive clinic visit within 2 weeks that 
includes a neurological evaluation; assessments of social and functional determinants of health; and an individualized care plan integrated with community -specific resources. Findings from [CONTACT_358136]’s study will be 
used to inform the patient -centered portion of the TBI transitional care intervention. [CONTACT_180101][CONTACT_358127] [CONTACT_4007] 
a retrospective study of factors contributi ng to cognitive- communication needs of adults with TBI. Findings will 
inform the patient -centered cognitive, communication, and social aspects of the TBI transitional care 
intervention. [CONTACT_68857] is currently PI [INVESTIGATOR_358097] -FIVES, an evidence- based skills training program for family 
caregivers of veterans referred to home care services, funded by a VA HSR&D grant, which is currently 
undergoing an 8- site RCT. HI-FIVES includes group classes for family caregivers to learn clinical, 
psychological, and support -seeking skills to improve caregiver functioning. Findings from [CONTACT_68857]’s 
study will inform the family -centered key processes of the TBI transitional care intervention.  
 
Impact of Proposed Research.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_358098], we are without data to inform 
development and testing of a TBI transitional care intervention that addresses specific needs and preferences 
of patients with TBI discharged home from acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358099] y caregivers.  Input from patients, 
families, and providers on the acceptability of an intervention of this nature is critical , as is data on the 
intervention’s feasibility and preliminary efficacy . With this  proposed work, by 2021, we will have assessed  the 
feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a TBI transitional care intervention that  aims to improve 
patient functional status , decrease caregiver strain , and direct patients and families to appropriate resources 
and care that is concordant with their health- related goals . 
 
C. INNOVATION  
 
 Our proposed work aims to develop a transitional care intervention to improve patient functional status 
and decrease caregiver strain. This research is novel as very little transitional care research addresses 
functional status or incorporates the needs of family caregivers. In addition, there is low strength of evidence 
for transitional care interventions to support patients with TBI dis charged home from acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358100] ; our research aims to address the unique needs and preferences of this patient population.  Finally, this 
study seeks to shift the paradigm of how care is provided to patients with TBI and families as they transition 
home, from interventions that separately focus on discharge preparation or on community needs to 
interventions that optimize and coordinate pre - and post -discharge care and needs to enhance care continuity.  
 
 
E. APPROACH  
 
 Setting and Population. All patients with TBI meeting inclusion criteria admitted to Duke University 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (DUH) neuro units 8W and 4100 and the 6 DUH medical -surgical/trauma units will be invited to 
participate in studies for aim [ADDRESS_446707] agreed to facilitate recruitment from their respective areas (see letters of support).  
 
Inclusion Criteria. Patients with TBI  will be eligible if they meet the following requirements : a) age 18-
64 years; b) diagnosed with moderate or severe TBI [admission Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3- 12];74 c) 
admitted to a DUH inpatient unit; d) plans to be discharged home from DUH; e) sufficient cognitive functioning 
to participate (i.e., able to follow 2- step commands) , as determined by [CONTACT_358128] (score > 76 eligible);75 f) sufficient oral communication skills  to participate , as determined by [CONTACT_358129] -Revised (score > 93.8 eligible);76 and g) English speaking (see Appendix A).  [CONTACT_358139] has successfully interviewed patients with TBI pre-  and post -discharge with these criteria.61,62 Family 
members  of patients with TBI  will include biologi cal relatives and friends77 and are eligible if they: a) are an 
anticipated primary caregiver after discharge (i.e., plans to live in same home as person or  have direct contact 
[CONTACT_358130] >10 hours/week);78 b) age > 18; and c) English speaking. Healthcare providers  will be eligible if 
they: a) self -identify as a licensed provider and b) provide care to patients with TBI during the transition home 
(in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358101] 8 weeks of discharge). All participants must be able to consent to participate.  
 
Sample Size Justification (Aim 1 and 2) . In Aim 1, we selected 45 to 60 total participants across 6 
focus groups, guided by [CONTACT_64367] 1 of the NIH Stage Model for Intervention Development guidelines of including 
15-30 participants per interviewee group (i.e., patients with TBI, family caregivers, providers) .79 In accordance 
with historical qualitative research, we will hold > [ADDRESS_446708] 12 participants  per group for 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602].81 Our desired sample size for Aim 2 is 30 total participants (15 patient/family dyads) who 
complete the full interventi on. Based on prospective TBI studies with follow up to one year, attrition can be up 
to 33% attrition.5 To be conservative, w e plan to enroll 40 total participants (20 patient/family  dyads), expecting 
33% attrition, to reach our desired sample size of 30 total participants (15 patient/family dyads). We will recruit males and females and racial/ethnic minorities to explore sex - and racial/ethnicity -based differences.  In 2018, 
DUH admit ted 663 patients with TBI and discharged 380 patients with moderate- to-severe TBI (age < 65 
years) home from acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422].82 Based on DUH estimates, a similar number should receive care 
annually.82 Typi[INVESTIGATOR_358102] >50%,83 leaving >190 patients/year and > 15 
patients/month to recruit.  DUH does not collect family data, but research suggests family recruitment is 
>50%.83 [CONTACT_358135]’s re search shows pre- discharge recruitment of patients with TBI and family caregivers 
in another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358103] > 60%.61,62 DUH also employs > 100 healthcare providers that care for patients 
with TBI during the transition ( in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358101] 8 weeks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345])  for recruitment.82  
 
Recruitment and Informed Consent (Aim 1 and 2) . DUH staff identified by [CONTACT_358131], family members, and healthcare providers and ask if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_358104].84 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_358105] m them about the study. If the potential  participant  is interested in participating in 
the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_358106], clearly explaining 
the study purpose and planned activities and will answ er all questions. Finally, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_358107] a signed informed consent and will provide the participant with a copy for their own records.  The primary 
threat to attrition in this study is loss to follow -up.83 To reduce and prevent attrition, participants will receive $15 
each after completion of each interview and each data collection time point.  
 
 Aim 1 Study Overview. We will use a combination of existing clinical guidelines, our  prior and ongoing 
research,  and a scopi[INVESTIGATOR_358108] . Potential 
intervention components are described below in the section titled “Developi[INVESTIGATOR_358109] (Aim 1).” We will 
create a manualized intervention protocol, which we will then refine with focus groups with patients with TBI, families, and healthcare providers . A trained research assistant will assist with intervention development and 
refinement.  Intervention development (3 months) and refinement (6 months) will take 9 total months.  
 
Description of U.K.’s NICE Clinical Guidelines on Discharge and Follow -Up of Patients with TBI . 
We will use the U.K. NICE clinical guidelines specific to discharge and follow -up of  children, young people,  and 
adults  with head injury53 as a guide for developi[INVESTIGATOR_358110]. The U.K. NICE clinical 
guidelines  were initially developed for patients with head injury discharged home from the emergency 
departm ent or observation wards (also known as an inpatient unit s) without inpatient rehabilitation.[ADDRESS_446709] attended the emergency department w ith a head injury, w rite to their GP [general practitioner]  w ithin [ADDRESS_446710] been organized.  
6. When a patient w ho has undergone imaging of the head and/or been admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358111] , refer  
from primary care to an outpatient appointment w ith a professional train ed in assessment and management of brain injury . 
7. Patients w ho return to an emergency department w ithin [ADDRESS_446711] scan.  
 
 Developi[INVESTIGATOR_358109] (Aim 1). We will first use the NICE clinical guidelines53 as a s tarting point 
to develop our TBI transitional care intervention. Then, we will combine our prior and ongoing research and a 
scopi[INVESTIGATOR_358108]. Our prior research indicates that 
patients with TBI  and their families could benefit from a transitional care intervention that addresses issues 
with: 1) patient safety, independence, cognition, and communication; 2) management of the patient’s mental 
health, overall health and wellness, and medications; 3) family needs; 4) access to community resources; and 
5) behavior change and health- related goal  activation . The intervention will be built to address these issues. In 
addition, t he AHRQ funded evidenced synthesis generated the Transition of Care Taxonomy , a framework 
describing [ADDRESS_446712]. Bettger (co -investigator) and 
colleagues , will be used to guide intervention development.  Table 3 lists the Taxonomy domains with pre-
selected components for our intervention (based on our prior/ongoing research). It is important to note that, to 
date, clinical guidelines and resea rch (such as that of the NICE guidelines53 and Transition of Care 
Taxonomy12) address system structural components and processes but does  little to explore behavioral 
mechanisms that empow er families and patients to follow -through with training and treatment plans . Drawing 
on [CONTACT_358137]’s (co- investigator) expertise in behavioral modifications, the intervention we develop will 
incorporate behavioral change mechanisms to increase the likel ihood that patients and families follow -through 
with training and treatment plans.  The intervention’s key processes will aim to improve patient functional 
status, caregiver strain, and to direct patients and families to appropriate resources and care that is concordant 
with their health- related goals.  We will create a manualized, intervention protocol, which will take 3 months.  
 
 Refining the Intervention  (Aim 1). The manualized intervention protocol  will undergo i terative user -
testing to determine acceptability.85 
The 6 focus groups (6- 10 participants 
each) will use a stratified, purposive 
sample to obtain informational 
representation.86 Focus groups will  
be organized concordantly based on 
insurance status and group 
membership (patient, family, or 
healthcare provider ). We will have 
one group with patients with TBI  and 
family members with insurance and 
one group without; one group with 
only patients with TB I and one group with only family members; one group with healthcare providers who care 
for patients in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358112]. 
Individual interviews will be used if availability for a focus group becomes challenging. At each focus group, we 
will talk through the protocol and describe and show what the intervention could entail.87 We will ask 
participants to discuss if intervention components address thei r transition needs  and goals  (discharge process 
and first months at home) and components that are missing or need revision.87 We will also explore individual, 
cultural, and social factors that may influence transition needs such as individual experiences in the clinical 
encounter; cultural beliefs about healthcare, interaction with providers, and communication preferences; and 
social determinants such as economic stability after TBI, neighborhood environment, community resour ces, 
and access to post -TBI education, training, and providers. We will also establish, from the perspectives of the 
patients and families, additional secondary outcomes that matter the most to them . At the completion of the 
focus group, participants will complete a demographic questionnaire (Appendix B ), including questions about 
age, sex , race/ethnicity, and education and employment; patients and families will also answer questions about 
the patient’s injury cause and date, health insurance status , self-identified social economic status , pre- and 
post-injury living arrangements, and post -discharge support . Each focus group will be [ADDRESS_446713]. Oyesanya (PI [CONTACT_4007] R03) is a qualitative expert with over 10 years ’ of experience in qualitative research 
methodologies  and data collection, including conducting focus groups and analyzing focus group data. She will 
conduct all focus groups and analyze all qualitative data with assistance of  a trained research assistant. The 
focus groups will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative data from the focus groups will be analyzed using directed content analysis. Directed content analysis is defined as using existing research to confirm, validate, or extend knowl edge in an area where more research is needed.

analysis, prior research on the needs  and goals  of persons with TBI discharged home from acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358113]7,8,89–[ADDRESS_446714]. Oyesanya  and 
the research assistant  will keep all codes, their definitions, and corresponding quotation  exemplars  in a 
codebook .88 The analysis will integr ate all participants’ perspectives, including analyzing patient and family 
member data together (where available) and incorporating healthcare providers’ perspectives.92 Findings from 
the focus group will be used to refine the intervention. Intervention refinement will take 6 months.  Table 3. Transition of Care Taxonomy (TCT) Domains and Intervention Components

TBI set to be discharged home from Duke University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358115] , 
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the TBI transitional care intervention. The intervention will be delivered 
by a multi -disciplinary team. Data will be collected at baseline (discharge), intervention midpoint ([ADDRESS_446716] -
discharge) and intervention endpoint ([ADDRESS_446717] -discharge). The research assistant will assist with 
recruitment, consent, enrollment, and data collection. As sessing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary 
efficacy of the intervention will take [ADDRESS_446718] for each follow up time point: 1) number of patients and family members called 
and reached; 2) number of call attempts per patient and family member; 3) number of patients and family 
members reached but unable to provide information; 4) completeness of data collected; 5) length of phone call; 
and 6) day of week and time of day patients and family members participated. Fidelity  will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_358133]. Our team will review recruitment and f ollow -up rates weekly and identify strategies to improve recruitment, enrollment, and 
data collection.  We will assess acceptability  of the intervention using a survey we develop. The outcome data 
we collect will be used to assess preliminary efficacy. To assess the preliminary efficacy  of the intervention, we 
will collect data on our primary outcome [patient functional status (Functional Status E xamination)25].

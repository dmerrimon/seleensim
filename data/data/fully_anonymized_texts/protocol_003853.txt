2. Abstract  
Critical asthma is disease of immune dysregulation that is acu tely treated with inhale d beta -agonists 
and systemic corticosteroids. Steroid agents are chosen at the discretion of clinical providers based upon a 
child's capacity to tolerate enteral medications and the specific clinical setting (outpatient vs. general 
inpatient vs. critical i npatient). Intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) is unanimously used in the critical 
care (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]) literature and population s but little data exists comparing MP to other potent intravenous 
corticosteroids such as dexamethasone (DM). Both dr ugs have been F DA approved for the acute treatment 
of inflammatory disorders including asthma, but no superiority trials have been conducted in the inpatient 
setting for this specific population.  
 
Our research group has conducted a retro spective study over a [ADDRESS_327333] prospectively study  individuals 
enrolled into an inte rventional arm ( DM) during their PI[INVESTIGATOR_269129] a parallel g roup, standard care  arm (MP). 
This research will provide much  needed epi[INVESTIGATOR_269130] b asic comparative data required to power and 
conduct a definitive, trials of DM vs. MP  assessing other clinical efficacy en dpoints  
 
3. Study Endpoints : 
Primary  endpoints include (1) length of stay , (2) continuous albuterol duration , (3) a composite 
outcome including frequency  of critical asthma adjunctive pharmacologic  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -based 
interventions, and (4 ) corticosteroid -related adverse events  
 
4. Background  
As the pathophysiology of an critical  asthma  is dysregulated inflammatory pathways, standard 
treatment includes the prompt initiation of intravenous systemic corticosteroids. Glucocorticoids are the 
mainstay of therapy for children treated for critical asthma  (Taylor, 1993). Furthermore, corticosteroids 
 
JHMIRB Modifie d eFormA  
Version 1 Dated:   01/30/2019  
Page 3 of 7 
 improve the efficacy of beta -2 agonists, such as albuterol (Svedmyr, 1990), a nebulized medication used for 
bronchodilation in acute asthma exacerbations. There remains an o ngoing dialogue among the expert 
medical community regarding the superiority of specific IV corticosteroid, dosing, route and delivery. This 
debate continues secondary to a lack of definitive comparative data in the literature. While the benefits of 
receiv ing systemic corticosteroids has been demonstrated in multiple studies (Scarfone, 1993; Ho, 1994; 
Connett, 1994; Sto rr, 1987; Younger 1987; Gleeson, 1990; Kattan, 1980), to date, no superiority trials have 
been conducted comparing IV systemic corticostero ids in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_269131] .  
While many  systemic corticosteroids are FDA approved for the treatment of asthma exacerbation 
including prednisone, prednisolone, MP and DM, standard care in management o f critical asthma is IV MP  
1mg/kg/dose (max 60mg)  every [ADDRESS_327334] there is equipoise in use of dexamethasone as an alternative for methylprednisolone due to 
its increased glucocorticoid (anti -inflammatory) potency  and long  elimin ation half -life (Keeney, 2 014; 
Paniagua, 2017). Steroid s are chosen at the discretion of clinical providers based upon a child's capacity to 
tolerate enteral medications and clinical setting (outpatient vs. general inpatient vs. critical inpatient).   
Our research  group has conducted a retrospective study over a [ADDRESS_327335] in cohorts defined by [CONTACT_269142]. Our 
data revealed no dif ferences, but many  children were switched to MP durin g their PI[INVESTIGATOR_269132]. We 
seek to prospectively consent individuals to receive DM (intervention arm) during their PI[INVESTIGATOR_269133]  a standard care arm (MP) . The JH-ACH admits approximately 150 asthmatics per 
year in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_269134] 90 subjects  ([ADDRESS_327336] care) to detect a 1 -day 
change in length of stay with a power of 0.8 and alpha set at 0.05. Primary outcomes include (1) length of 
stay, (2) continuous nebulized albuterol duration , (3) a composite outcome including rate of critical asthma 
adjunctive pharmacologic  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_269135] , and ( 4) rates for corticosteroid -related adverse 
events. We plan to use the  finding s of our study to inform the methodology of upcoming superiority trials 
to better understand  how choice of corticoste roid may impact clinical, mol ecular, physiology efficacy  
endpoin ts.  
 
5. Study Procedures  
a. Study design : After IRB approval, we will conduct a prospective , parallel -arm, non -randomized , 
open labe l, single-cente r, cohort  study  in children 5 to 17 years of age admitted to the JH -ACH 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_269136] . Children consented  to the int erventional arm will receive  intravenous 
(IV) DM 0.25 mg/kg/ dose (max dos e 15 mg per dose ) every [ADDRESS_327337] care arm will receive  IV MP 1 mg/kg/dose (max dose 60mg  per dose ) 
every 6 hours for  up to  5 days .  
b. Study duration : Up until 30 -days a fter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] d ischarge  following study enrollment .  
c. Blinding : None . 
d. Justification of why participants wil l not receive routine care or will have current therapy 
stopped . DM has an  FDA approved indication for asthma  exacerbation  management . The use of 
DM has been adopted in the emergency room  and inpatient  acute care setting as standard care.  
e. Definition of treatment failure or participant removal criteria .: As the half -life for DM is such 
that 2 days of dosing is the  equivalent of 5 days of steroid exposure, at the completion of day 4, 
if a child is still  severely ill (at the discretion of the clinical provider  in consultation with 
pediatric Pulmonlogy  as part of standard care ) was define d as treatment failure. Standard care 
would dictate further steroid administration at this time with either IV or PO corticosteroids 
beyond  5 days with planned taper in the inpatient/outpatient setting . If treatment failure occurs 
and IV steroids are elected to be continued b eyon d the pres pecified duration, the cli nicians 
could choose  the corticosteroid type at their discr etion.

 f. Description of what happens to participants receivi ng therapy when study ends or if a 
participant’s participation in the study ends prematurely : After children receive up to [ADDRESS_327338] care managemen t (MP). If a child enrolled into the 
intervention  arm (D M) receives < 2 days of  IV DM but are ready to initiat e enteral medications , 
then they will be switch to enteral  DM 0.5mg/kg/dose daily  for a total  duration  of exposure not 
to exceed 2 -days during protocolized treatment . 
g. Inclusion/E xclusion Criteria : Inclusion criteria are  children 5 to 17 years of age with primary 
admission diagnoses of  critical asthma (including both  acute asthma exacerbation or st atus 
asthmaticus  in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_269131]) . Exclusion criteria are children with existing tracheostomy, 
cystic fibrosis, malignancy, transplantat ion status, and pulmonary hypertension .

8. Risks  
a. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and min or risks and expected frequency : 
i. There always exists a potential risk for data leak, loss of privacy and breach of 
confidentiality.  All measures (described below) will be taken to minimize these risks.  
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks : 
i. Patient data will be stored for res earch purposes as a HIPAA defined limited data set in a 
secure, password protected electronic database and analyzed with Stata v15.1.  Each 
patient will be assigned a unique Participant ID number in the system.  Access to the 
system will be restricted to r esearch team members listed above.  Data extractions as 
well as modifications or edits to data will be logged.  
 
JHMIRB Modifie d eFormA  
Version 1 Dated:   01/30/2019  
Page 6 of 7 
 ii. Serio us adverse events will be followed throughout study , officially reported within 24 -
hours, and adjudicated within the co -investigator and steering committee. In the even t 
that > 5% of children have a serious adverse event  during enrollm ent, trial enrollment 
will be halted to prevent potential harm .  
c. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations : 
i. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_269138] a monthly  basis with study members either face -
to-face or via telecommunications to discuss study management, education / re -
education of team members and mentorship. This will include any discussion related to 
unanticipated problems or study deviations. This will n ot exclude team members from 
meeting with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_269139] y protocol. These meetings will be confidential and take place in a secure 
meeting room in the Johns Hopkins All Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_269140] 702.  Any deviations from the study protocol will be 
logged and im mediately reported to the local JH -ACH IRB for review.  
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach o f confidentiality : see above.  
e. Financial risks to the participants : none  
 
9. Benefits  
a. This research will provide the needed epi[INVESTIGATOR_269141] a definitive, head -to-head trial of DM vs. MP. As a result of the se data, 
definitive study with a randomized, RCT could be conducted to confirm superiority or non -
inferiority of DM vs MP  as well as assessment of other rel evant endpoints.   
b. We expe ct that given  the shorter treatment duration and  potent glucocorticoid activi ty, DM will 
offer poten tial advan tages related to patient compliance . 
 
10. Payment and Remuneration : None  
 
11. Costs : None  
 
12. Discontinuation of Study Intervention and Participant Withdrawal:  
a. If a patient has a serious or non -serious adverse event thought to be associated with DM, then 
the IRB, subject, and family will be notified of an y adverse events immediately .  
b. A participant may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request  (or 
consenting fam ily member’s request) .  
 
13. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations:  
a. The investigator will be responsible for the foll owing:  
i. Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/IEC annually or more 
frequently in accordance with the requirements, p olicies, and procedures established by 
[CONTACT_1201]/IEC  
ii. Notifying the IRB/IEC of SAEs or other significant safety find ings as required by 
[CONTACT_1744]/IEC procedures  
iii. Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to requirements 
of 21 CFR, ICH  guidelines, the IRB/IEC, European regulation 536/2014 for clinical 
studies (if applicable), and all other applic able local regulation s

14. Informed Consent Process : 
a. The investigator or his/her authorized designee  will explain the nature of the study to the 
participant or his/her legally authorized representative and answer all questions regarding the 
study.  
b. Participant s must be informed that their participation is voluntary. Participants or their legally 
authorized representative will be required to sign a st atement of informed consent that meets the 
requirements of [ADDRESS_327340] (HIPAA) requirements, where applicable, and the IRB/IEC or study center.  
c. The medical record must in clude a statement that written informed consent was obtained before 
the participant was enrolled in the study and  the date the written consent was obtained. The 
authorized person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the informed consent form 
(ICF). 
d. Participants must be re -consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their 
participation in the s tudy.  
e. A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the participant or the participant’s legally authorized 
representative.  
 
15. Protocol Deviations  
a. A protocol deviation is any departure from the defined procedures and treatment plans as 
outlined in the protocol ve rsion submitted and previously approved by [CONTACT_1201]. Protocol 
deviations have the potential to place participants at risk and can also undermine  the scientific 
integrity of the study thus jeopardizing the justification for the research.   
b. The JHM IRB requir es the prompt reporting of protocol deviations which are:  
i. Emergency deviations (when immediate deviations are required to protect the life or 
physical well -being of a participant)  
ii. Major (representing a major change in the approved protocol), non -emergent d eviation 
occurring without prior IRB approval  
c. Minor or administration deviations, which do not affect the scientific soundness of the research  
plan or the rights, safety, or welfare of human participants, are reported to the JHM IRB at the 
time of continu ing review.

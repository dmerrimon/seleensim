oral administratio n under fast ed conditions  in male and female healthy subject s. 
Approximately [ADDRESS_57275] will be randomized to receive one of two treatment sequences (RT 
or TR; R =10 mg  of NORVASC® and T =5 mg of levamlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_53538] ) 
according to a randomization schedule prepared prior to the start of the study. All 
study drugs will be administered following an overnight fast for approximately 10 
hours. 
Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical research center (CRU) within 
24 hours before baseline assessments in Period One and will stay at the CRU for 3 
nights . A single dose of s tudy drug should be taken orally with 240 ml ( about 8 fluid 
ounces) of water at site after being fasted overnight, and meal will be allowed around 
1 hour after dosing . Subjects should return to the CRU  on Days 4 till 8  to provide PK 
samples and to receive study assessments.  Serial blood samples will be obtained at 
defined time points for 7 days after dosing  in each treatment for the measurement of 
plasma (S)amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_20793] (R)amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_53539] .  
After a wash -out period for at least 14- days since  the last dosing , subjects will enter 
into Period Two to receive alternative reference or test d rug. Thus, subjects who 
receive levamlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_53540]®

11.1.1.   Medical History  
Demographic characteristics (age, sex, race and ethn icity) will be collected at screening visit.  
Medical his tory will be reviewed and collected at  screening visit . 
11.1.2.   Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including blood pressure, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oral temperature, will be 
measured at the screening and other  visits . Subjects  should be resting  for at least 5 mi nutes prior  
to measurement. Vital signs  will be measured in sitting  position.  
Vital signs may be repeated for clinically significant abnormal vital signs at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  
11.1.3.   Physical Examination  
Physical examinations will be performed by  [CONTACT_53598] . At the  screening visit, height (centimeters) and weight (kilograms) will be measured and 
BMI will be calculated. All abnormal findings will be documented in the source documentation 
and the CRF . 
11.1.4.   Electrocardiogram  
Standard resting 12- lead ECGs will be performed at multiple visits.  All ECGs will be performed 
after the subject has  rested for at least [ADDRESS_57321] be evaluated for safety by [CONTACT_21438]/her designee. The final  
conduc tion intervals entered i nto the CRF  will be those generated by [CONTACT_6632], unless  
deemed significantly inaccurate by [CONTACT_53599]. In 
these cases, the over -read intervals will be documented in the CRF . The Investigator will als o 
record an overall assessment of the ECG.  Clinically significant abnormal ECGs may be repeated 
at the discretion of the Investigator.  
CSPC Ouyi Pharmaceutical Co . Ltd                                             Protocol #:  LAM -US-[ADDRESS_57322]’s eligibility for participation in the  study. The Investigator 
should signify review of the labor atory reports by [CONTACT_53600]. If subjects’ 
values are out of range  and the Investigator  deems the out of range value is clinically significant, 
the Investigator  must discuss and agree upon individual cases with CSPC  Pharma’s Medical 
Monit or prior to enrollment. 
Any significant abnormalities should be fully investigated. Whenever possible, the etiology of  
the abnormal findings will be documented on the CRF . Laboratory results with clinically  
significant abnormal values may be repeated f or verification. Additional tests and other  
evaluations required to establish the significance or etiology of an abnormal result or to monitor  
the course of an AE should be obtained when clinically indicated. In particular, if a clinically  
significant abnormal result is observed that is not resolved by [CONTACT_53601], repeat tests  
will be performed if possible and resolution or stability of the abnormality will be recorded in the  
source documentation. 
Any clinically  significant laboratory abnormalities that are either serious  (e.g., require medical 
intervention or result hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063])  or unexpected will be promptly  reported to the CSPC  
Pharma’s representative. Any additional relevant laboratory  results obtained by [CONTACT_53602].

must be negative to qualify enrollment . 
Drug  and alcohol tests will be conducted at the screening visit and on Day - 1. Results must be 
negative to qualify enrollment  prior to dosing.  
Serum  pregnancy test will be performed at screening visit, and urine pregnancy test on Day - 1 
for female subjects only.  
11.2. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be recorded beginning immedia tely after the ICF is signed. Subjects will be  
instructed to report AEs during the study and staff will query subjects  regarding AEs throughout 
the study. The Investigator (and/or designee) must document all AEs reported by [CONTACT_53603] -of-Treatment visit. Any 
subject who is withdrawn from the study due to an AE shall be followed until the event has 
CSPC Ouyi Pharmaceutical Co . Ltd                                             Protocol #:  LAM -US-[ADDRESS_57323]’s source  documentation and CRF . 
11.2.1. Definitions of Adverse Events  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of medicinal (investigational) product,  
whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An AE is any symptom, sign, 
illness, or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study. 
Adverse events reported after consent but before the first dose of study drug are still to be  
documented by [CONTACT_53604]- treatment -emergent AEs. Adverse 
events will be considered treatment emergent if the onset date is after the first dose of study drug.  
The severity of each AE will be gr aded by [CONTACT_25311]:  
• Mild: awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  
• Moderate: discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities  
• Severe: incapacitating, with inability to perform normal ac tivities  
Inter -current illnesses or injuries should be regarded as AEs. Abnormal results of laboratory tests  
or diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the abnormality:  
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Is considered by [CONTACT_53605]  
• Results in study withdrawal 
• Fulfills any of the criteria for an SAE, as described in this section  
• Requires intervention or further evaluation to determine the etiology of the abnormality 
and/or assess the risk to the subje ct 
• Requires treatment  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a medically important event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above  
The term “life threatening” in the definition of “serious ” refers to an event in which the subject  
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might  
have caused death if it were more severe. Death is an outcome of an event. The event that  
resulted in death should be recorded and reported on the SAE form and documented in the CRF . 
CSPC Ouyi Pharmaceutical Co . Ltd                                             Protocol #:  LAM -US-[ADDRESS_57324] assess the relationship between the AE and the study drug by [CONTACT_53606]:  
• Probably related: The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the medication; OR the AE follows a known pattern of or response to the study drug; OR 
an alternative explanation (e.g., concomitant disease, environmental factors, and/or 
concomitant medication) is less likely than attribution to th e study drug; OR the AE 
diminishes or disappears upon cessation or reduction of dose of medication; OR the AE 
reappears upon re -administration of the medication.  
• Possibly related: The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the med ication; OR an alternative explanation (e.g., concomitant disease, environmental 
factors, and/or concomitant medication) is inconclusive, thus the causal relationship 
cannot be excluded; OR the AE diminishes or disappears upon cessation or reduction of 
dose of medication.  
• Not related: The AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the medication; OR the AE does not follow a known pattern of or response to the study 
drug; OR the AE can be attributed to another factor (e.g., conc omitant disease, 
environmental factors, and/or concomitant medication).

consent  to the End- of-Treatment visit are to be recorded in the  subject’s source documents and 
on the corresponding page(s) in the CRF . Wheneve r possible, symptoms, signs, and laboratory 
abnormalities should be grouped as a single syndrome or  diagnosis. The Investigator should 
specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect  to study drug, corrective 
treatment/therapy given, outcom e and his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_53578] a reasonable 
possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_5257], according to the  definitions noted in 
Section 11.2.1. All medications administered to treat an AE must be  recorded in the subject’s 
source docum entation and documented in the CRF . 
11.2.4. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Reporting of SAEs will be conducted in accordance with the appropriate regulatory guidelines. 
All SAEs that occur from the time of consent  to the End- of-Study  visit must be reporte d, whether 
or not the event is considered associated with the study drug. The Investigator must complete the 
SAE Reporting Form and submit it by [CONTACT_53608] [ADDRESS_57325] also provide with urgent priority (upon receipt of a request) other relevant  
documentation (e.g., copi[INVESTIGATOR_53579], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], and/or 
autopsy  report) and send this information by [CONTACT_53609].  
All SAEs must be recorded in the subject’s source documentation and documented in the CRF . 
Medications administered in association with the SAE must be documented in the CRF  and in 
the subject’s source documentation. The Investigator must also promptly noti fy the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) /Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of SAEs, including any follow -up 
information, in accordance with local institutional policy and applicable regulatory requirements.

additional information may be requested.  
Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator within 30 days after cessation of study drug  
and considered by [CONTACT_12552]/her to be caused by [CONTACT_53610] a reasonable possibility, should 
be reported through the SAE reporting process.  
 
12. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  
12.1. Sample Size Determination  
Based on an approximate CV B of 20%, a CV W is calculated to be 14% for C max and 11% for 
AUC 0-∞, respectively . Thus, an N value of approximately 18 completed subjects for AUC (%CV 
rounded off to 10%), an N value (interpolated) of approximately 27 completed subjects would be 
required for the proposed bioequivalence study. With an estimated drop- out rate of 20% in this 
cross -over study, approximately [ADDRESS_57327]  non-
compartmental methods and validated software. Individual and mean (SD) concentration time

CSPC Ouyi Pharmaceutical Co . Ltd                                             Protocol #:  LAM -US-[ADDRESS_57334]’s legally authorized representative, as applicable, in accordance with local practice and  
regulations. Written informed consent must be obtained from all subjects participating in a  
clinical study conducted by [CONTACT_53615].  
The background of the proposed study, the procedures, the benefits and risks of the study, and 
that study participation is voluntary for the subject must be explained to the subject. The subject  
must be given sufficient time to consider whether to participate in the study.  
A copy of  the ICF, signed and dated by [CONTACT_423], must be given to the subject. Confirmation of 
a subject’s informed consent must also be documented in the subject’s source documentation 
prior to any testing under this protocol, including screening tests and asse ssments.  
Each consent form should contain an authorization allowing the Principal Investigator(s) and 
CSPC  Pharma to use and disclose patient health information (PHI) in compliance with  local law.  
The original signed consent form will be retained with the study records.  
 
16. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] 
16.1. Data Collection  
All data obtained for analysis in the clinical study described in this protocol will be documented 
in the CRF . Data reported in the CRF s should be consistent with and substantiated by  [CONTACT_1560]’s medical record and original source documents. Any discrepancies must be explained.  
Unless explicitly allowed in the CRF  instructions, blank data fields are not acceptable. If a field 
is blank because the item was not done, the field will  be marked “Not Done”. If the item is  
unknown, the field will be marked “Unknown” . 
Prior to the start of the study, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_53586] a Delegation of Authority  
form (Site Signature [CONTACT_53633]), showing the signatures and hand written initials of all 
individuals and the delegation of responsibilities, such as identifying those individuals who are  
authorized to make or change entries on CRF s. 
16.2. Case Report Form Completion  
Data within the CRF  will be monitored by [CONTACT_53618] l Research Associate according to the 
Monitoring Plan. Queries will be generated based on discrepancies found while monitoring. Site  
personnel will review and respond to these queries appropriately. Additionally, the CRO  and 
CSPC Ouyi Pharmaceutical Co . Ltd                                             Protocol #:  LAM -US-[ADDRESS_57335] be 
signed and dated by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_53587].  
16.3. Database Management, Data Clarification, and Quality Assurance 
A designated CRO will be responsible for data management. Data Management will develop a  
Data Management Plan (DMP) document an d provide it to CSPC  Pharma for  approval. The 
DMP document will define all activities in the data collection and cleaning  process. The detailed 
DMP will be based on the protocol, work scope, contract, analysis plans, data- flows, CRF s, data 
cleaning pro cedures, other supporting documents, and data management  standards and practices.  
The programmed data validations will be run to check for database completeness and 
consistency, and queries will be generated upon data entry or via review by a Clinical Data  
Manager after entry. The site will respond to the data queries in a timely manner.  
Concurrent medications entered into the database will be coded using a WHO Anatomical  
Therapeutic Chemical dictionary. Coexistent diseases and AEs will be coded using MedD RA. 
Quality control procedures will be conducted prior to database lock according to the designated 
CRO SOPs.  
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked. Any  changes 
to the database after that time will only be made by [CONTACT_53619], the Trial Statistician, the Data Manager, and the Quality Assurance Auditor according to 
designated CRO SOPs.  
16.4. Inspection of Records/Source Documents  
According to the ICH guidelines for GCP, the sponsor or des ignee must verify data entered in  
the CRF  against the source documents, except for the pre -identified source data directly  
documented in the CRF  (if applicable). The ICF will include a statement by [CONTACT_53620]’s duly author ized personnel, the IRB/IEC, and the regulatory authorities to 
have direct access to source data that supports the data in the CRF  (e.g., subject’s medical file,  
appointment books, and original laboratory records). These personnel, bound by [CONTACT_53621] l 
secrecy, must keep confidential all personal medical information.  
The objective of source document verification (SDV) is to comply with GCP and international  
regulatory requirements and to reduce the risks of fraud. Source document verification means  
ensuring that the source documents are an accurate and verifiable reflection of the subject’s  
participation in the study and that all relevant information that is recorded in the source  
document is accurately entered into the CRF . 
Where source documents s erve as the basis for deriving data for the trial, SDV should ensure that  
these documents are correctly labeled and filed and that the data derived from them are correct.  
CSPC Ouyi Pharmaceutical Co . Ltd                                             Protocol #:  LAM -US-[ADDRESS_57336] be dated and signed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_53588]- Investigator at the time of the 
visit.  CSPC  Pharma reserves the right to terminate  the study for refusal of the Investigator to 
supply orig inal source documentation for this clinical  study.  
The Investigator will note in a source independent from the CRF  the following information:  
1. Information to confirm that the subject exists (e.g., initials, date of birth, sex)  
2. Confirmation that the subj ect satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
3. Confirmation that the subject is taking part in the clinical trial 
4. Confirmation of the informed consent process  
5. Visit dates and documentation of protocol assessments and procedures  
6. Information concerning all A Es 
7. Details of concomitant and investigational medications  
Source document verification is not a substitute for clinical trial monitoring, the purpose of  
which is to ensure that the protocol has been followed correctly, the CRF  has been fully and  
accurately completed, SDV has been carried out, and the study timelines and enrollment goals  
and requirements have been met.  
16.5. Retention of Records  
The Investigator must maintain all study documentation as confidential, and take measures to 
prevent accidental or p remature destruction of these documents.  
The Investigator must retain the study documents at least [ADDRESS_57337] approval of a  
marketing application/new drug application for the indication investigated or at least [ADDRESS_57338] (e.g., the Investigational New Drug application is withdrawn). These documents should 
be retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_8146] s or 
by [CONTACT_53622].  
The Investigator must notify CSPC  Pharma prior to destroying any study essential documents. 
If the Investigator can no longer ensure archiving, he/she shall inform CSPC  Pharma.  The 
relevant records shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee . 
 
17. CONFIDENTIALITY 
All information disclosed or provided by [CONTACT_53615] (or designee) or produced  during the 
trial including, but not limited to, the protocol, the CRF s, the IB, and the results  obtained during 
the co urse of the trial (if applicable), are confidential. The Investigator or any  person under

any third party without the prior written approval of CSPC  Pharma.  
However, submission of this protocol and any other necessary documentation to the IRB/IEC is  
expressly permitted, the IRB/IEC members having the same obligation of confidentiality.  
All information generated in this study must be considered highly confidenti al and must not be  
disclosed to any persons not directly concerned with the study without written prior permission 
from CSPC  Pharma. However, authorized regulatory officials and sponsor personnel  (or 
designee) will be allowed full access to inspect and cop y the records. The copi[INVESTIGATOR_53589].  
All study drug s, subject bodily fluids, and/or other materials collected shall be used solely in 
accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by [CONTACT_53623](s) or regulatory authorities.  
Subjects will be identified only by [CONTACT_53624] s. Their full names may,  
however, be made known to a regulatory agency or  other authorized officials in the event of  
inspections. Documents containing the full name [CONTACT_53634]. This information will not be transferred to CSPC  Pharma nor 
be contained in r egulatory filings. In the event of inspections by [CONTACT_53625], this subject 
identification may be disclosed.  
17.1. Subject Data Protection 
Prior to any testing under this protocol, including screening tests and assessments, candidates  
must also provide a ll authorizations required by [CONTACT_1769] (e.g., PHI authorization in North 
America).  
The subject will not be identified by [CONTACT_53626]. CSPC  Pharma, its partner(s) and  designee(s),  and 
various government health agencies may inspect the records of this study. Every effort will be 
made to keep the subject’s personal medical data confidential.  
CSPC  Pharma will protect individual subject information to the fullest extent po ssible  during this 
trial. At no time will a subject become identified in any publication or presentation.  
However, the subject may have to become identified in the event of a regulatory authority 
auditor inspection in order to verify the accuracy of the da ta. Access to subject information is at 
the discretion of CSPC  Pharma and cannot occur prior to database lock or other specified events 
as determined solely by [CONTACT_53627].

Confidential    Page 47 18. STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
The Investigator will not make any changes to this protocol without prior written consent from 
CSPC  Pharma and subsequent approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC. Any permanent change to the protocol, 
whether it is an overall change or a change for specific study center(s), must be  handled as a 
protocol amendment. Any amendment to the protocol that appears necessary as the  study 
progresses will be fully discussed by [CONTACT_737](s) and CSPC  Pharma. If  agreement is 
reached regarding the need for an amendment, it will be written by [CONTACT_53615]. The written 
amendment must be submitted to the chairman of the IRB/IEC  identified with this responsibility. 
Except for administrative amendments, Investigators must  await IRB/IEC approval of protocol 
amendments before implementing the change(s).  
Administrative amendmen ts are defined as having no effect on the safety of the research  
subjects, scope of the investigation, or quality of the trial. However, a protocol change intended 
to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects should be implemented immediately, and  
the IRB/IEC notified within 5 days. CSPC  Pharma will ensure submission of any  protocol 
amendments to the appropriate regulatory agencies.  
When, in the judgment of the chairman of the local IRB/IEC, the Investigators, and/or CSPC  
Pharma, the amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design and/or  increases the 
potential risk to the subject, the currently approved written ICF will require similar  modification. 
In such cases, the Investigator will obtain repeat inform ed consent from subjects  enrolled in the 
study before expecting continued participation.

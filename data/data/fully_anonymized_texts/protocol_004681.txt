Clinical Investigational Plan #US-[ADDRESS_402586] lesion. Device intervention Magseed and Sentimag® by [CONTACT_326310], Inc. Study Purpose The purpose of this post-marketing study is to provide prospective evidence that the Magseed and Sentimag® is effective for lesion localization in patients undergoing surgical excision of a breast lesion and to summarize measures of product safety and performance. Method of Use The Endomag Magseed® magnetic marker is intended to be placed percutaneously in the breast under imaging guidance (ultrasound or mammography) to mark temporarily (< 30 days) a lumpectomy site intended for surgical removal.  The Magseed® magnetic marker is localized using the Sentimag® handheld probe and surgically removed with the target tissue.   Study Design This is a post-market, prospective, open label, single arm study of Magseed and Sentimag in patients undergoing surgical excision of a breast lesion. Eligible subjects have breast lesions requiring excision. Subjects will have the Magseed marker deployed under imaging guidance up to thirty days prior to surgery.   The Magseed marker will be localized using the Sentimag system during surgery and removed with the lesion. After the lumpectomy procedure, subjects will be evaluated up to [ADDRESS_402587] 18 years old at the time of consent, and be scheduled for a lumpectomy1 procedure (which also includes excisional biopsy) of the breast; and meet all other inclusion and exclusion criteria. Planned Number of Subjects At least 100 subjects will be enrolled. Investigational Sites [LOCATION_002]: MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX. Study Duration The expected duration of enrolment is approximately [ADDRESS_402588]’s participation lasting 1-[ADDRESS_402589] lesion.  Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is the percent retrieval rate of the index lesion and Magseed in the initial excised specimen.  This is defined as the number of subjects in whom the index lesion and Magseed are retrieved in the initial excised specimen divided by [CONTACT_326311]. Other Endpoints Safety • Rates of device-related adverse events and device-related serious adverse events  Radiological Placement • Radiologist rated ease of marker placement • Success rate of Magseed placement (placement accuracy): <5mm to lesion; 5-10mm to lesion; >10 mm to the target. • Duration of Magseed placement (lesion localization) procedure                                                                     [ADDRESS_402590] and will include partial mastectomy, segmental mastectomy, wide local excision, and excisional biopsy.

Clinical Investigational Plan #US-[ADDRESS_402593] common cancer among American women, except for skin cancers. About 1 in 8 (12%) women in the US will develop invasive breast cancer during their lifetime.  The American Cancer Society's estimates for breast cancer in the [LOCATION_002] for [ZIP_CODE] are:  • An estimated 246,[ADDRESS_402594] cancer are expected to be diagnosed in women in the U.S. • 61,000 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer will also be diagnosed • About 40,[ADDRESS_402595] conserving surgery (BCS) being performed. With the increased rate of mammographic screening and improved imaging techniques the numbers of nonpalpable breast lesions detected is also increasing. In addition, lesions not yet proven to be cancers by [CONTACT_326312][INVESTIGATOR_326299] a definitive diagnosis to be made.                                                                      2 https://cancerstatisticscenter.cancer.org 
Clinical Investigational Plan #US-[ADDRESS_402596], with positioning of the wire tip at the centre of the lesion. The surgeon estimates the position of the wire tip and excises a margin of tissue around it.  However, this procedure has a number of limitations3 including: • Wire localization must be performed on the day of surgery to minimize risk of wire migration or dislodgement, a significant possibility due to the external section of wire left protruding from the breast.  • Same-day appointments demand excellent coordination between radiological and surgical departments to ensure that disruption to procedure scheduling is minimized.  • Wires have also been associated with higher re-operation rates2,3.  • From the patient perspective, wire placement necessitates a sometimes painful extra procedure on the day of surgery, which can increase stress levels2.   • The position of the surgical incision can be influenced by [CONTACT_326313]4. This can lead to excessive dissection and suboptimal cosmetic results due to resection of uninvolved breast tissue. 3.2 Radioactive Seed Localization Radioactive seed localization (RSL) is a newer technique which overcomes some of the limitations of guidewires5. A radioactive seed is inserted to mark the lesion prior to surgery, thus eliminating the requirement for radiology appointments on the day of surgery. The seed is detected in the operating room using a handheld gamma probe. With RSL, there is no distraction from external projections of wire, and the surgeon is guided purely by [CONTACT_326314].  Where available, RSL potentially offers improved scheduling and improved surgical outcomes over wires6.  However, implementing and running an RSL system is challenging because of the stringent regulatory regime for the use of radioactive materials, in particular: • An on-site nuclear medicine facility is required; • A total chain of custody of radioactive material at the site (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) must be maintained, and loss of a seed can result in closure of the program; • Regulations govern the safe disposal of radioactive waste7. As a result, significant planning, training and administration across multiple departments is required to implement RSL, and this has limited its wider uptake. 3.[ADDRESS_402597] 20 (2011) 246-253  4 P.J.

In addition, Ahmed et al. tested localization of cancerous lesions using a magnetic tracer injection9. The tracer successfully localized all tumors and resulted in appropriate excisional margins, without excess tissue excision; thus demonstrating the feasibility of magnetic tracer localization of tumors. 3.[ADDRESS_402602]. The marker is similar to a biopsy clip and can be detected using a handheld magnetometer called Sentimag. The Sentimag probe emits an alternating magnetic field that detects the magnetic response of the Magseed marker. The magnetometer produces an audible response and numerical display when held close to the Magseed marker, and can be used by [CONTACT_326315]. Magseed is indicated for implantation up to 30 days before surgery. 3.5 Summary of Localization Techniques The scheduling difficulties and the patient inconvenience encountered in wire guided localization, alongside the logistical and regulatory issues of radioisotope usage, highlight a requirement for further innovation and acquisition of new localization technologies. Magnetic marker localization offers an alternative that can overcome the limitations of these existing technologies. This study will evaluate a magnetic marker called Magseed and its accompanying handheld magnetic probe called Sentimag.  4 DEVICE DESCRIPTION 4.1 Device Name  [CONTACT_326336]® and Magseed by [CONTACT_326310], Inc. 4.2 Device Description  The Sentimag® and Magseed intra-operative magnetic sensing system (Figure 1) comprises a magnetic marker, Magseed, and a sensitive handheld magnetometer attached to a base unit, Sentimag®. The magnetometer and magnetic marker have been FDA cleared (K153044) for the following intended use: The Endomag Magseed Magnetic Marker is intended to be placed percutaneously in the breast to mark temporarily (< 30 days) a lumpectomy site intended for surgical removal. Using imaging guidance (such as ultrasound or radiography) or aided by [CONTACT_105]-imaging guidance (Endomag Sentimag® System) the Endomag Magseed® Magnetic Marker is located and surgically removed with the target tissue.  The Endomag Sentimag® System is intended for the non-imaging detection and localization of the "Endomag Magseed Magnetic Marker" that has been implanted in a lumpectomy site intended for surgical removal.  The Magseed device is a small (5 x 0.9 mm) metallic magnetic marker that has soft magnetic properties. This means that when exposed to a magnetic field it becomes magnetic. The magnetic signature [CONTACT_326337] a magnetometer and probe which gives an audible and visual signal of the strength of response from the marker, and as it is directional, this can accurately guide the user to the site of the magnetic marker. The marker is deployed by a radiologist into the center of the lesion planned for                                                                     [ADDRESS_402603] Cancer Patients: A Meta-analysis., Ann Surg Oncol. 2016 May;23(5):1508-[ADDRESS_402604] cancer (MagSNOLL Trial), Br J Surg. 2015 May;102(6):646-52

  Needle delivery system Seed (Nominal size: 0.9mm diameter x 5mm) Figure 3: Magseed magnetic marker needle delivery system and marker   4.3  System Operation The Magseed magnetic marker is deployed under, either ultrasound or mammography (x-ray) imaging guidance.  The needle delivery system and the marker are visible under both these modalities.  Magseed is not suitable for MRI guided deployment as the needle delivery system is not MRI compatible.  Using the delivery system, the marker is placed percutaneously in the breast up to [ADDRESS_402607].  During surgery the marker facilitates magnetic localization of the target lesion using the Sentimag® probe, initially to allow the approximate location to be identified and an incision made, and then post-incision within the surgical site to detect and localize the lesion for excision.  For some lesions, the position of the incision can be determined by [CONTACT_11174], for example a skin mark.  The Sentimag probe generates an alternating magnetic field that temporarily magnetizes the marker. The magnetic signature [CONTACT_326338] [CONTACT_326316] a sensitive magnetometer in the probe.

Using imaging guidance (such as ultrasound or radiography) or aided by [CONTACT_105]- imaging guidance (Endomag Sentimag® System) the Endomag Magseed® Magnetic Marker is located and surgically removed with the target tissue.

Clinical Investigational Plan #US-[ADDRESS_402609]-marketing study is to provide prospective evidence that the Magseed and Sentimag® is effective for lesion localization in patients undergoing surgical excision of a breast lesion and to summarize measures of product safety and performance. 5.[ADDRESS_402610] lesions has been largely unchanged for thirty years despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a number of drawbacks, including: • Guidewire placement must happen on the day of surgery to reduce the risk of wire movement and to minimize the risk of infection.  This can make scheduling between radiology and surgery departments difficult10,13. • Wires can become displaced or transected during surgery, making accurate lesion localization more difficult10,11. • The position of the surgical incision can be influenced by [CONTACT_326313]10,13. • The use of guidewires has been associated with high re-excision rates11,12,13. • The additional procedure on the same day is stressful for some patients10. More recently, the introduction of RSL offers scheduling benefits to surgeons and radiologists and the potential for improved surgical outcomes.  However, use of radioactive materials is closely regulated, and in order to set up a seed program, significant multi-disciplinary investment in training and implementation of radioactive materials handling processes is required.  This means that in practice, RSL is limited to the larger healthcare institutions where this administrative overhead is more readily justifiable.  The Sentimag and Magseed system overcomes the limitations of guidewires and offers the benefits of RSL without the administrative burden of dealing with nuclear medicine regulations. This post-marketing study will assess the effectiveness of the Sentimag and Magseed system for breast lesion localization, in particular the % retrieval rate of the index lesion and Magseed in the initial excised specimen. In addition, other measures of device performance and device safety will be recorded. As the focus of this study is a new surgical tool, and not a change to the treatment pathway, it is not considered necessary to include a cohort control or to randomize the study.  In any case, it would not be possible to mask the radiologists or surgeons who perform the localization procedure due to the packaging and shape differences between the Magseed product and any commercially-approved control product.  Therefore, this study will be considered an open-label, single arm study.  [ADDRESS_402611]’s participation lasting 2-[ADDRESS_402612] 20 (2011) 246-[ADDRESS_402613] 22 (2013) 383-388 12 P.J.

All inclusion criteria must be met and no exclusion criteria can be met in order to be enrolled in the study. Enrollment and Baseline (Visit 1) Prior to any study-specific procedures, the subject’s written informed consent and HIPAA authorization will be obtained. A subject will be considered enrolled in the study after granting written informed consent. The informed consent process must be documented in the subject’s medical records (Section 15: Informed Consent and Confidentiality). A Subject Identification (ID) Log which captures subject identifiers, for subjects enrolled in the study, will be completed by [CONTACT_326317]. Following the informed consent process, a baseline evaluation will be completed. The baseline evaluation will be performed prior to the Magseed placement procedure and will include the following assessments: • Demographics: age, gender, height, and weight • Breast history, menopausal status, tumor size, stage, and how detected • Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy 10.2 Marker Placement Procedure (Visit 2) All eligible subjects will have the Magseed marker deployed under imaging guidance up to thirty days prior to surgery.  All women of child-bearing potential will undergo standard of care pregnancy evaluation prior to the marker deployment.  If a single Magseed is placed, the marker will be deployed close to the center of the lesion, and the position of the marker relative to the lesion recorded from the post-placement mammogram.  In the beginning of the study (first 20 subjects), only one Magseed will be placed. More than one marker can be deployed to bracket a larger lesion, and the position of the markers relative to the lesion recorded from the post-placement mammogram.

Proctoring is permissible to train additional investigators. The site staff responsible for completing the eCRFs will be instructed on the proper procedure for completing the forms and ensuring that all data are collected. They will be trained by [CONTACT_326325]’s clinical staff or nominated representatives. All site personnel (Investigator(s) and site staff) will be instructed on the protocol, including all follow-up requirements, adverse event reporting, trial product handling and accountability, good clinical practices, HIPAA regulations, regulatory requirements and instructions for obtaining consent. All site personnel involved in investigational product use will also be trained on product use.  In addition, Investigator Responsibilities (Section 17.4) training will be conducted with the responsible Investigator.  All training will be documented. 15 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 15.1 Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is the % retrieval rate of the index lesion and Magseed in the initial excised specimen.  This is defined as the number of subjects in whom the Magseed is localized and the index lesion and Magseed are retrieved in the initial excised specimen, divided by [CONTACT_326326] a breast lesion following placement of Magseed in the lesion. 
Clinical Investigational Plan #US-[ADDRESS_402643] 95% confidence interval14 with maximum width ±0.[ADDRESS_402644] 80%. At the anticipated success rate of 90% the confidence interval precision will be ±0.076. Up to 120 patients will be enrolled to ensure excision data for 100 patients. 15.3 Statistical Methods Statistical analysis is the responsibility of the sponsor’s designated statistician. A full statistical analysis plan will be written prior to any data analysis. 15.3.1 Analysis Sets All subjects who undergo the lumpectomy with Magseed excision procedure as part of the study will be included in all analyses of safety. Specific endpoints related to Magseed placement and excision will be based on the total number of subjects undergoing the procedure.  15.3.2 Control of Systematic Error/Bias Selection of subjects will be made from the Investigator's usual subject load. All subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and having signed the ICF will be eligible to enroll in the trial. Consecutively eligible subjects should be enrolled into the study to minimize selection bias.  15.4 Data Analyses 15.4.1 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Baseline data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, n, minimum, maximum) for continuous variables and frequency tables for discrete variables.  15.4.[ADDRESS_402645] deviations, sample sizes, minimums, and maximums. Point estimates will be provided for rates and mean values along with 95% confidence intervals. Rates of serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported by [CONTACT_326327], and rates of adverse events related to the device will be reported. Any unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) will be listed and summarized as appropriate. No formal tests of hypotheses are proposed for the other endpoints.  15.4.[ADDRESS_402646] confidence intervals using Clopper-Pearson method as expected proportion is high. 
Clinical Investigational Plan #US-[ADDRESS_402647] the scientific soundness of this study.  If there are missing data (i.e. data for Magseed has not been recorded or has been lost), a sensitivity analysis will be carried out for the primary endpoint.  Both the worst case and the best case proportions will be calculated. For the worst case analysis, subjects with missing data will be assumed to have no magnetic marker detected and retrieved. For the best case analysis, subjects with missing data for will be assumed to have a magnetic marker detected and retrieved. No other imputations for missing data are planned. 15.4.[ADDRESS_402648] to the same risks shared by [CONTACT_326328].   Please refer to the Sentimag and Magseed Instructions for Use (IFU) for warnings and contraindications for the devices. There are no specific additional risks to the subject over and above the risk mentioned in this section related to participation in the study. 16.1.[ADDRESS_402649]'s physiologic status during research procedures and/or follow-ups and by [CONTACT_326329]. 16.2 Potential Benefits All subjects participating in this study may benefit from the use of Magseed and Sentimag for localizing a lesion.  The Sentimag®, used in conjunction with Magseed, assists the surgeon in the localization of the target lesion.  This technique avoids the need for the use of guidewires and the drawbacks of this technique for patients: wire placement can be painful; the additional procedure on the day of surgery can be stressful15; and there is a risk of wire migration16.  In centers where RSL is used, Magseed offers the benefit of reduced exposure to radiation. 16.3 Risk to Benefit Rationale  16.3.1 Risks associated with the procedure/implant Subjects enrolled in this post-market clinical study are subject to the same risks shared by [CONTACT_326330] a routine procedure with a Magseed, implanted guidewire or radioactive seed.  Please refer to the instructions for use (IFU) for the list of risks.                                                                     [ADDRESS_402650] 20 (2011) 246-253 16 P.J.

Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
Data analysis will be  performed using the statistical software SPSS ( IBM SPSS Statistics for 
Windows, Version 2 6.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). The primary outcome will be  tested using an 
independent samples t-test. To assess for any differences in VAS scores based on demographic data, 
independent t-tests will be  utilized.  To assess for normal ity of distributions in the sample's continuous 
demographic and clinical characteristics, z -scores will be  formed by [CONTACT_726409].  This is  performed to ensur e that parametric measures can  be used for the two 
groups. A Fisher's exact test will be  used to  assess the lower dose for a difference in adverse effects. 
During analysis, it was determined that t he pain reduction variables could be  compared by [CONTACT_726410] . Additionally, the pain red uction variables will be  compared by 
[CONTACT_547], duration of pain (≤ 24 hours vs. > 24 hours) , and location of pain (back/neck vs. other locations 
and small vs. large joints) using independent t -tests .

 I. Background and  Aim 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_45478] -established health benefits of physical activity (PA), [1-7] less than 10% of people aged 
60+ years meet national PA guidelines. [8] Barriers to PA that  contribute to this bleak statistic include 
factors such as feeling “too old,” [9] inadequate support ,[10-12] and low self -efficacy .[13] Unfortunately, 
after completing home -based, group, or educational  interventions, older adults’  PA improvements are 
minimal and short -lived. [7, 14, 15]  In light of these challenges, it is important to investigate alternative 
interventions for elders that improve PA.  
 
Attention has recently turned toward using smartphone applications (apps) to improve health behaviors. [16] 
Such  technology extends healthcare beyond in -person clinical visits due to its versatility, portability, and 
potential cost -savings. However,  few health apps are scientifically evaluated [17-19] and even fewer are 
tailored to the specific needs of older adults. This research gap has prompted the Centers for Disease 
Control to call for studies that link mobile health (mHealth) solutions to healthy aging agendas. [20]  
 
In the proposed study, we will develop, test, and optimize a core  app and set of attached specialty features 
that are designed to facilitate  older adults’  PA. This package, termed the Moving Up  suite,  is distinct from 
generic fitness apps because it blends evidence -based behavior change techniques (e.g., self -regulation 
via activity monitoring)  in the core app with  a set of  special ized components  that reflect empi[INVESTIGATOR_520952] [21, 22]  and stereotype embodiment theory. [23] Specialty 
features include: (a ) implicit and explicit messag ing to promote positive aging views; (b ) sedentary activity 
(SA) monitoring with motivational messaging and p eer suggestions; and (c ) data -driven, automated remote 
coaching and support. To date, no other app has offered a comparable suite that has been systema tically  
optimized to address inactivity in older people , justifying the need  to scientific ally evaluate this type of tool . 
In the clinical trial phase of the study, we will u tilize a highly efficient, innovative methodological approach —
Multiphase Optimization Strategy ( MOST )[24, 25] —to provide an experiment al context for evaluating each 
of the Moving Up  suite’s specialty features . The MOST procedure originated from the field of engineering 
and is explicitly designed to facilitate selection of intervention components by [CONTACT_520968] (a key gap i n health app research).  
 
The specific aim  of the clinical trial phase  of this study is to conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_520953]-tracking  core app  and its three specialty features. This will  
include the MOST Screening Phase: theory -guided experimentation to identify viable components within a 
multifaceted preliminary  intervention plan.[24] Using a factorial design as specified in MOST procedures, 
100 underactive older people  (i.e., those accumulat ing <[ADDRESS_675731] moderate  intensity 
activity/ week) [8, 26]  will be randomly assigned to one of eight conditions which reflect all possible 
combinations of presence vs. absence of the three respective specialty features , given usage of the core 
PA-tracking app. At the end of a four -month intervention period, for the core app as well as for each 
specialty feature we will examine changes from baseline in objective PA , SA time , self-reported PA , and 
functional mobility . We will also test the association between  the app component features and theoretically 
postulated mediating constructs ( self-efficacy , self -regulation, outcome expectation, social support, aging 
self-perception, and views of aging ). In addition, we will document usage rate and satisfaction with t he app .  
II. Approach & Methods  
A. Clinical Trial  Design  
This two-part study initially involves a two -week field test of the PA-tracking app s uite followed by a focus 
group and then a four -month trial of the refined suite. This later segment is the focus of this clinical trial 
protocol description . A description of the app suite  and details of the trial design are  provided in the 
subsequent section s. 
Version date: 10/09/[ADDRESS_675732] [21, 22]  
and SET [23] as its theoretical framework. SCT posits four 
determinants of health -promoting behavior: self -regulation, 
self-efficacy, social support, and outcome expectation .[21, 
22] SET describes the process and consequences of 
internalizing age stereotypes, such that aging sel f-
perceptions and general views of aging are associated with 
health and survival. [27, 28]  Each construct above has been 
linked empi[INVESTIGATOR_520954]. [29-32] 
Figure [ADDRESS_675733] 
or SET considerations and are tailored to overcome elder PA barriers: (1) Proof Positive , as motivated by 
[CONTACT_520969], capi[INVESTIGATOR_520955].[29, 33]  When activated, users (a) receive texts describing how old age does not equate 
to physical inab ility, (b) obtain information about the benefits of growing older, and (c) are presented with a  
variety of  positive aging stereotype task s modeled after priming activities commonly used in the field (e.g., 
word scrambles, [34] pi[INVESTIGATOR_152679], [35], computerized series  [33, 36 -38]). This last example  exposes 
users to blocks of “positive priming words”. [33] Primers are quickly flashed to allow perception without 
awareness [36] while users focus on an image of activ ity—a step that builds on Levy’s wor k by 
[CONTACT_520970].  (2) On Your Feet  is designed to reduce SA —a 
health risk factor largely independent of insufficient PA [39]—by [CONTACT_504654] -regulatory and behavior change 
techniques including goal -setting, progre ss feedback, and prompting. [40] Accumulated sedentary time is 
displayed alongside self -selected goals; audible, vibratory, or text -based reminders to stand are sent at a 
user-specified frequency; and general tips as well as previously  compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602], older adult -identified strategies 
to reduce SA [6] are texted. Additionally, messages about the benefits of reducing SA and overcoming 
barriers (e.g., fatigue) are also sent. (3) Coach Me includes daily messages designed to assist older adults 
in (a) discovering practical ways to i ntegrate brief bouts of PA into their daily routines and (b) overcom ing 
common PA barriers. [41, 42] Blending PA with productive activity has been identified as a key facilitator of 
PA engagement in older people .[43, 44]  In Coach Me , suggestions on how to intensify common daily 
activities are tailored based on user selections fro m an activity inventory stored within an individual’s 
Moving Up  profile. For example, if a user identif ies “laundry” on the inventory, Coach Me may suggest  “heel 
raises while holding onto the dryer before placing clothing in a basket.” This app feature is intended to help 
older adults become  more active in a minimally intrusive way, while allowing for simultaneous engagement 
in productive and meaningful activities. Coach Me asks users to select obstacles to PA encountered in the 
previous week. Based on thos e selections, the app sends strategies  on how to overcome those barriers in 
the future , thereby [CONTACT_520971] -efficacy .  
 
A.2. Clinical Trial  Design Details  
We will utilize the MOST procedure to assess  the app suite  specialty features ’ efficacy  and other 
performance aspects . MOST is explicitly designed to disentangle the effects of multiple components that 
make up  an intervention26,105—a key project goal given our intent to appraise  the merit of novel, previously 
untested app features. Traditionally, multi -component interventions are subjected to efficacy pi[INVESTIGATOR_520956], but in the absence of systematic evaluations of singular  components.  However, in 
such cases: (a) the intervention may contain inert ingredients that contribute to subpar or cost -inefficient 
results; or (b) difficulties may arise in determining which intervention aspects contribute to efficacy, due to 
the presence of multiple components which have not been individually tested. In contrast, following 

Version date: 10/09/[ADDRESS_675734] factors, corresponding to the presence vs. absence of each specialty feature, will be 
manipulated in a completely crossed design, given each participant’s utiliza tion of the core app.  Following 
random assignment (using a computer algorithm designed for this purpose) to the eight conditions, 
participants will undergo a four -month intervention interval. Experimental outcomes will consist of pre -to-
post change scores on PA -related and mediating variables , and documentation will also be provided for 
parameters such as usage frequency and user satisfaction that are pertinent to subsequent efforts to 
achieve optimization.  
 
Each specialty featur e will be provided to half of the participants, leading to respective comparative 
assessments that involve  45 vs. 45 (feature present vs. absent) participants . Accor dingly, it is incorrect to 
conceptualize this design as a test of outcome differences between eight  separate inadequat ely powered 
cells; rather, the intent is to collapse information across cells so as to obtain a reasonably large sample 
size when examining each component’s performance. [24] Further, because the specialty features would be 
inexpensive to download if used in large -scale distributions of the app , and because they have been 
carefully designed to reflect empi[INVESTIGATOR_398637], it is important to avoid premature elimination of 
features on the basis of non -significant experimental effects which in actuality may stem from sample size 
limitations. C onsequently, in evaluating intervention components we will downplay the importance of 
(though still include) significance testing of PA outcomes, and instead will incorporate the total array of 
relevant information (e.g., effect sizes, u sage rates, satisfa ction ratings)  in the final component selection 
and fine -tuning process . 
 
B. Participants, Recruitment, and Consent  
For Aim 1, a  convenience sample of 15 elders  will be recruited from independent -living communities within 
FPCIW ’s 2,000 -member senior network  in Los Angeles (LA)  and local senior venues . An estimated 1,300 
FPCIW  members use smartphones. [45] Iterative phases of product development  require  only five to seven  
representative users  per prototyp e iteration, [46] justifying our sample  size of 15 (five per  app suite  specialty 
feature).  
One-hundred  community -living older adults  who are served by [CONTACT_520972]  (FPCIW) will be primarily recruited from FPCIW’s [ADDRESS_675735], an adequate number of participants will be available to enable 
meaningful analyses ( final N=90) given a four-month attrition rate of 10% (estimate based on  averaging 
interval -adjusted study completio n rates in five studies of mHealth  or web -based PA interventions for adults 
aged >40 years [47-52]. Second , the expected overall (N=90) and per -feature (n=45) sample sizes well 
exceed the number of participants previously described as necessary to determine if a larger trial is 
warranted. [53] Third, the stipulated sample size is easily achievable and represents roughly the maximum 
number of participants attainable given available funding resources.   
Persons w ill be deemed eligible based on the following criteria . Inclusion criteria : men or women , 65–84 
years old; English speaking; reside in LA  or in Pacific Time Zone if participating remotely ; score ≥5 on a 6 -
item cognitive screener [54]; report <150 minutes of moderate -to-vigorous PA/week as per a  single -item 
screener; [55] ambulatory; ability to safely participate in PA as determined by [CONTACT_6270]-report of ability to 
regularly walk safely ; smartphone owner for ≥ 1 month ; observed ability to reliably access and operate a 
smartphone during orientation ; available by [CONTACT_520973] . Exclusion criteria : 
unwillingness to meet at local community venues  and/or via online meetings to  comply with study  
procedures for the length of ea ch study . Although not an eligibility criterion per se, access to a computer 
and webcam, and sufficient computer skills to participate in virtual orientation  is necessary if in -person 
orientation is not feasible.  
Version date: 10/09/[ADDRESS_675736] responded to 
advertisements or presentations will be initially screened for eligibility over the phone or in person by 
[CONTACT_80282] . After initial screening, informed consent materials will be sent or handed to 
prospective participants for pre -review. Authorized research  personnel will then perform the consent 
process for qualifying participants at local community venues that are convenient to the pa rticipants . If an 
in-person meeting for enrollment (including consenting) is not feasible, we will conduct enrollment activities 
virtually through phone calls or vide oconferencing, and will send consent forms electronically to participants 
using DocuSign o r a REDCap eConsent form to review and complete . Only key personnel who are HIPAA 
and CITI certified, trained in consenting procedures, and do not have a conflict of interest will conduct the 
consent process. The consenter will explain the study procedures  and describe in detail what will be 
expected of participants. Participants will have ample time to ask questions about the study and their role in 
it. If the individual is interested in participating, they will sign the consent form. If participants are n ot 
comfortable with the study, they may choose not to participate.  Following consent, an assessment battery  
would be held next.   
C. Procedures  & Measurement  
Participants will  complete an orientation , either in -person or online,  that includes activation of and training 
to use select app features on their personal phones . They will be encouraged to carry their phones during 
activity, a behavior we will reinforce by [CONTACT_520974] (e.g., waist pouch) and monthly 
telephone check -ins beginning in w eek one. Participants will be shown how to manually enter PA data that 
cannot be captured automatically (e.g., due to water -based sports). During check -ins, participants will be 
offered technology support, and will be questioned about events that may have altered their phone usage 
or activity patterns (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). Additionally, a troubleshooting asynchronous hotline will be made 
available to participants during the intervention.  
 
Study measures (apart from the four -meter walk test and collection  of usage data) will be either (1) mailed  
or dropped off/pi[INVESTIGATOR_520957], including paper -based 
instructions or a link to video -based instructions and a pre -addressed/postage pre -paid envelope —
telephone assistanc e will be made available to complete requested study tasks; (2) emailed with 
instructions for electronic completion —telephone assistance will be made available to complete requested 
study tasks; and/or (3) administered by a condition -blind tester at a FPCI W or other community venue at 
baseline and/or post -intervention.  A combination of remote plus in -person assessment session contact [CONTACT_520975]. The most likely scenario for this hybrid contact [CONTACT_520976]-person support to don their activity monitor appropriately. This will be decided on a 
case -by-case basis and is unlikely to be necessary for more than a few participants.  
 
In-person  sessions will typi[INVESTIGATOR_84688] 2–8 participants, with the assessment b attery lasting approximately 
1.5 hours. Objective PA level  (primary targeted outcome) and objective SA time will be assessed during a 
three -day monitoring period pre - and post -intervention the activP AL (Pal Technologies Ltd) , a thigh -worn 
monitor that is considered the gold -standard for tracking sedentary behavior  in free-living conditions .[56-58] 
Proprietary algorithms available from activPAL  software analysis program will be used to aggregate PA - 
and SA -related data. (Although the PA -tracking core app  provides useful intervention -facilitating PA 
feedback, [59] app-based PA records will not be used as outcome  data because they have not been 
validated for this purpose and do not include useful baseline information.) Auto-calculated times identified 
by [CONTACT_520977]/wake times, with participant report s of 
these  periods  as manually entered into the device  for the purpose of corroboration.   
 
Self-reported PA  will be measured via the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). [60] PASE is a ten -
item instrument designed to assess engagement in PAs commonly encountered by [CONTACT_21140], including 
those related to leisure, household, and occupational tasks. The tool is a valid  and reliable measure of PA 
engagement in older populations. [60, 61]  For assessment sessions conducted in -person, Function al 
mobility  will be assessed through a four -meter walk test, [62-65] a commonly used, validated measure of 
physical and functional performance in older adults.

 The potential mediators PA self-efficacy , self-regulation , outcome expectation , and social support  will be 
measured using the 78 -item PA scale of the Health Beliefs Survey. [66, 67]  Subscales demonstrate 
sufficient internal consistencies (Cronbach’s α= 0.68–0.90)  and are predictive of PA. [32] Aging self -
perceptions will be assessed by [CONTACT_520978] .[68, 69] This five -question tool captures the subjective aging experience, shows 
moderate internal consistency (Cronbach’s α= 0.61–0.64) , and predicts mortality risk .[27] Views of aging 
will be measured using the A ttitudes to Ageing  Questionnaire, [70] a 24-item tool that assesses subjective 
views about age -related psychosocial, physical, and psychological changes; is cross -culturally valid; and is 
psychometrically sound (Cronbach’s α= 0.68–0.84).[70] Usage behavior  (e.g., frequency of opening the 
app) will be captured via the app platform , and perceived usefulness  of assigned features will be meas ured 
via the the Mobile App Rating Scale – Adapted  user version  [uMARS] , as well as the post-study phone 
interview  (included to inform optimization beyond information gleaned from the clinical trial ).

III. Data Management, Analysis, & Statistical Considerations  
 
Our biostatistician will secure and archive data, and will oversee all data analytic functions. Usage data for 
each participant will be obtained from storage within the app and downloaded manually at in -person 
assessment sessions. Data will be transferred to the  biostatistician for analysis and storage on the USC 
secure network . activPAL  data will be downloaded and cleaned. Using proprietary  algorithm s supplied by 
[CONTACT_520979],  waking -hour wear periods will be identified for use in analysis . 
 
Data analy sis will be organized around the goal of providing multiple sources of information useful for 
future efforts to optimize the Moving Up  app suite. We will calculate descriptive statistics  at baseline and/or 
post-intervention for demographic, app usage  behavior  [proportion of days opening the app ≥1 time], user 
satisfaction  [perceived app quality, physical activity -related ( objective physical activity  [primary outcome; 
daily steps], sedentary activity time  [daily sitting time], self-reported physical ac tivity, functional mobility  
[gait speed]), and mediational (i.e., self-efficacy for physical activity, self -regulation for physical activity, 
family social support for physical activity, outcome expectation for physical activity, aging self -perceptions, 
views of aging)  outcome variables, both for the overall sample and by [INVESTIGATOR_2394]/off status of each of three 
specialty features (i.e., Proof Positive , Coach Me,  and O n Your Feet).

 Indicator variables w ill be created to code whether or not the participant had each of the specialty features  
installed on their phone as part of the intervention. Results regarding outcomes and hypothesized 
mediators will be  calculated overall and by [CONTACT_520980]. The feature subgroups are not mutually 
exclusive since a participant c an be randomized to receive 0, 1, 2, or all 3 of the features.  
 
Specialty feature condition effects on the objective physical activity  (change in daily steps) primary 
outcome will be analyzed using a mixed effects linear regression model  adjusted for conf ounders (including 
presence/absence of other specialty features, between -feature interactions, select demographic variables 
[age, sex, race/ethnicity, education]),  and baseline daily steps . Although significance testing will provide 
merely one source of in formation in driving app optimization decisions, the anticipated sample size (N=90) 
was chosen to  enable 80% power (given α=.[ADDRESS_675737] ) in testing experimentally based pre -post physical activity increases 
associated with a specialty feature (given an effect size of .45, a feasible value bas ed on prior tests of 
technology -based physical activity intervention components).  Using change -from-baseline scores for 
objecti ve physical activity , we will derive Cohen’s d effect sizes stratified by [CONTACT_139785]. absence of each 
specialty feature. For secondary physical activity -related outcomes and proposed mediators, we will 
conduct multiple one -tailed t -tests ( α=.10) to furthe r explore the potential viability of the specialty features. 
To facilitate later RCT planning, we will also calculate single group pre -post change effect sizes for the full 
sample . Correlation  coefficient s will be calculated to assess associations between the primary outcome 
(change in daily steps)  and proposed mediators. To analyze app usage behavior and user satisfaction , for 
each intervention feature considered separately, we will perform one -tailed t -tests to examine mean 
differences in eac h variable  based on whether or not the participant was assigned to receive that feature .  
 
After participants conclude the clinical trial phase, they will take part in an interview about their experience. 
Interview  responses will be audio -recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded, and analyzed using qualitative 
data analysis software. All qualitative data analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_978] , Co-investigators, and/or 
authorized  Research Assistant s. Initial thematic analysis will incorporate codes suggested from the Health -
ITUEM .[71] Additional codes will be identified as they arise in the data. Rigor will be achieved through peer 
review of themes and by [CONTACT_520981].  
IV. Protection of Human Subjects  
A. Risks to Human Subjects   
A.1. Human Subject Involvement, Characteristics, and Design   
A total of 1 00 underactive older adults  (accounting for 10% attrition)  will participate in the clinical trial phase  
to accomplish the aims of the study. Subjects will be between the ages of 65 and 84 years old, and will be 
users of smartphones for ≥ 1 month. Underactive individuals will be targeted (i.e., those who accumulate 
<[ADDRESS_675738] moderate intensity physical activity per week) due to their high risk for chronic 
disease resultant from lack of physical activity engagement and sedentar y behavior. Additional inclusion 
criteria for entrance into the study includes  ability to reliably access and operate basic features of a 
smartphone (ascertained by [CONTACT_520982] -hour orientation and demo session). Exclusion criteria 
are unwillingn ess to meet at local community venues or comply with study  procedures for the length of 
each study.  
A four -month intervention period will take place . On a randomized basis, the research participants (N=100) 
will be assigned to one of eight conditions where by [CONTACT_520983]. Intervention dosage is consistent with small pi[INVESTIGATOR_520958]. They will complete an orientation session, either in perso n or 
online. Check -in phone calls will be made by [CONTACT_520984] 1, 2, and 3,  for purposes of 
troubleshooting and gleaning initial impressions of app usage. A short interview covering usability and 
feasibility will be conducted during the fina l phone check -in just after completion of the [ADDRESS_675739] -intervention, each participant will complete a battery of self -report assessments 
and clinical measures and complete a three -day physical activity monitoring period using a wearable  
accelerometer. These assessments will be either (1) mailed to participants  or dropped off/pi[INVESTIGATOR_520959]: 10/09/2020

 through contact[CONTACT_520985] , including paper -based instructions or a link to video -based instructions 
and a pre -addressed/postage pre -paid env elope —telephone assistance will be made available to complete 
requested study tasks; (2) emailed with instructions for electronic completion —telephone assistance will be 
made available to complete requested study tasks; and/or (3) administered by a conditi on-blind tester at a 
FPCIW or other community venue. A combination of remote plus in -person assessment session contact 
[CONTACT_520986]. The most likely scenario for this hybrid contact [CONTACT_520976] -person su pport to don their activity monitor appropriately. This will be decided on a 
case -by-case basis and is unlikely to be necessary for more than a few participants. If the full assessment 
session is held in-person , each  session (excluding the three -day physical activity monitoring component) is 
anticipated to take approximately one hour to complete. Total length of enrollment will be four months and 
approximately two week s to accoun t for pre - and post -testing. There are n o collaborating sites in this 
proposed study.   
A.2. Sources of Materials   
Data will be collected from participants by [CONTACT_520987] (pre - and post -
intervention)  or via US mail , contact[CONTACT_520985]/pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up, or secure email  for digital completion , two 
three -day activity monitoring periods (pre - and post -intervention), and during a four -month intervention 
period. Data to be gathered at the pre - and post -intervention assessment sessions include demographic 
and background infor mation, health beliefs regarding physical activity, self -reported physical activity, and 
sedentary time. If assessment sessions are held  in-person, f unctional mobility will be assessed during a 
four-meter  walk test administered by [CONTACT_59856]. Upon completion of assessment 
sessions, data coding forms and materials will be delivered to the study center at USC and kept in locked 
file drawers. During each of the three -day activity monitoring pe riods, participants will wear a research -
grade  accelerometer. Activity patterns and wear patterns tracked through this device will be manually 
downloaded to and stored on a secure database. During the four -month intervention period, participants 
will be ut ilizing the PA-tracking core  app/mechanical pedometer  and specified specialty features on their 
smartphones. Data automatically captured through the app such as activity patterns (e.g., minutes 
engaged in moderate intensity activity) and app usage behavior s (e.g., frequency of accessing various app 
features) will be gathered through the in -app tracking software. These data will be downloaded from the 
app database  and transferred to a  secure USC server in coded format as described above. Participants will 
be educated (verbally and via a written SOP [“Information Collected in App”]) when they install the app, 
about data that will be collected within the app, what will happen to those data at the end of the study.  A 
short interview to collect usability and fea sibility data will be conducted during the final phone check -in just 
after completion of the [ADDRESS_675740] (i.e., the four-
meter  walk test) during the pre - and post -intervention assessment sessions.  As with any walking task, 
there is always the potential risk of falling. It is unlikely that participants will become fatigued during this 
task given the short distance the test requires to travel.  
Physical activity monitoring using accelerometers. The ri sks associated with wearing the activPAL 
accelerometer are minor. The device s are  small (51 X 34 X 8 mm) and lightweight, about the size of a 
Version date: 10/09/2020  
 
10 
 men’s wristwatch. They are  designed for long -term activity monitoring and for use in sleep studies. 
Individuals ma y report, though unlikely, discomfort from the cloth strap s available .   
Physical activity engagement . Engagement in physical activity poses a low risk of physical discomfort to 
participants. As with any intervention that encourages participants to increas e physical activity levels, 
participants may experience fatigue or minor muscular discomfort that may accompany increased physical 
activity levels. This discomfort typi[INVESTIGATOR_520960]. There is also a risk for injury related to 
engaging i n PA in a non -supervised setting.  
Exposure to explicit and subliminal positive aging stereotype messages . There is a slight  risk that exposure 
to positive messages (both explicit and implicit) about aging may have a neutral or negative influenc e on 
partici pants’ views about aging and engagement in PA . For instance, a message that is paired with an 
image of an older adult playing tennis may discourage someone who is unable to engage in sports due to 
physical disabilities.  
Confidentiality. There is a slight  risk that people who are not connected with this study will learn a 
participant’s identity or personal information.  During interviews and focus groups , which are audio recorded 
in a private room, participants will be identified by a false name [CONTACT_520997] t heir identity on the audio 
transcripts. If audible personally identifying information is recorded during the focus group, this information 
will be deleted from the written transcriptions. Audio recordings will be listened to in a private setting and 
stored  on a secure server at USC until the transcription process and qualitative data analyses are 
complete. Pseudonyms and real names will only be connected through one password -protected file on the 
Division of OS/OT secure server, in a separate location from the original data and transcribed files. An 
audio recording release form will be required for signature [CONTACT_520998].   
There is also a slight  risk for a potential security breach of the app that stores participants’ smartphone 
usage p atterns and information or the USC server where participant data are finally stored for analysis. To 
mitigate this risk, data auto -collected from the tracking features of the app will be in coded format (i.e., no 
participant personal identifiers will be in cluded with these data) as will be the case for any data collected 
during the assessment session. Additionally, the USC servers are password -protected and include network 
restrictions. Access rights to the servers will be terminated when authorized study p ersonnel leave the 
study.   
Other risks . Participants may choose to use their smartphones in unsafe ways (e.g., accessing an app 
while crossing the street). Though this behavior is not necessarily isolated to our study, to mitigate the risk 
we will distribute a safe handling of phones informati on sheet following the informed consent process.     
Overall burden.  The level of burden for subjects is a concern in any research study, though we feel 
participant burden is relatively low for this study. The most identifiable burden is associated with su bjects’ 
time devoted to completing the assessment sessions , interviews , or focus groups , and energy and effort 
involved with utilizing the smartphone app in daily life for four -months. Use of the app is on a voluntary 
basis for the four-month testing perio d. Participants may use the app and assigned specialty features as 
often or as infrequently as they choose. Participants are also free to withdraw at any time should they 
decide that the burden becomes too great.   
B. Adequacy of Protection against Risks   
B.1. Recruitment and Informed Consent   
We will use a multi -faceted recruitment approach for the proposed research. Participants will be recruited in 
the following ways: (a) telephone contact [CONTACT_520988]; and (b) study opportunity presentations delivered at local 
Front Porch -affiliated community senior centers  or outside networks . A Front Porch Project Coordinator will 
be responsible for contact[CONTACT_520989]. If the individual is 
agreeable, contact [CONTACT_520990]-up and further screening.   
Version date: 10/09/[ADDRESS_675741] format to ensure that all require d elements are introduced. 
Explanations will cover all aspects of the intervention, the testing requirements, participants’ rights, and 
other relevant information. Individuals will have an opportunity to ask questions about the study and, if they 
choose to  enroll, will sign a printed or electronic consent form. They will be provided with a printed or 
electronic copy of the consent form and the Research Subject’s Bill of Rights.   
B.2. Protections against Risk   
A number of safeguards will be in place to mini mize risk. All interactions with participants will be performed 
by [CONTACT_9260]. Prior to performing their duties, all study staff who will interact with 
participants will undergo specific training for their research tasks, with attention bein g devoted to issues 
surrounding risk to  human subjects. Toward this end, all staff members will be required to complete HIP AA 
and IRB certification, and will be informed of potential pi[INVESTIGATOR_520961] s. Intervention delivery content sent through the automated remote coach will be 
overseen by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_63124] a licensed occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_520962] -I Sarkisian who is a medical doctor. At 
the outset of the study and at subsequent three -month intervals, a p roject staff meeting will be held in 
which all study personnel will discuss the safety and proper treatment of research participants. These 
meetings will be mandatory for all project personnel who have contact [CONTACT_520991] m the study. [CONTACT_520999] will be present at these meetings, as well as furnish advice regarding 
the medical safety of the intervention and how to deal with any medically relevant problems that arise.   
Self-report information. Subjects may refrain from a nswering any questions without prejudice. We also 
have subjects complete their surveys in our presence  when possible . This serves two purposes: 1) we can 
answer questions that arise regarding individual items, and 2) we can provide immediate assistance if 
necessary. While severe reactions to answering personal questions are rare; we will offer counseling and 
emergency resources available to those in need. Participants who complete mailed  or digital  assessments 
independently will be provided with a phone num ber to call with any questions or concerns.  
Functional mobility testing. In order to minimize risks associated with functional mobility testing (i.e., the 4-
meter gait speed test ), participants who attend in -person assessment sessions are instructed to wal k a 
self-selected normal pace.  A study team member will be nearby [CONTACT_520992]. For those individuals who deem any discomfort or instability too extreme, there is the option of 
discontinuing the testing procedures.   
Physical activity monitoring using accelerometers. We will offer the option of weari ng a terry cloth thigh -
band underneath the accelerometer if participants are experiencing discomfort from strap s or adhesive . 
The additional layer between the skin and  acce lerometer eliminates any discomfort associated with the 
device skin contact  [CONTACT_520993]. If this option is not acceptable to the 
participant, the subject may be excluded from further participation in the study.  
Physical  activity engagement.  To mitigate the risk of engaging in increased levels of physical activity, we 
have included self-reported screening question that asks individuals if they believe they are safe to 
regularly walk . Co-I Sarkisian —a medical doctor and ge riatrician —has deemed this screening question 
sufficient given the low -risk and non -prescriptive nature of the intervention.  If an individual answers “no” to 
this question , then he/she will be excluded from the study. Activity engagement during the interve ntion 
period is voluntary. We will recommend moderate intensity walking, a low risk physical activity for older 
adults, during the intervention period (i.e., as part of the goal -setting and remote coaching components of 
the app ). The medical doctor and phy sical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_520963]. We will ask about adverse events whenever our 
Version date: 10/09/[ADDRESS_675742] all been reviewed by [CONTACT_50783]’s social  psychologist, [CONTACT_521000], who has expertise 
in older adult stereotype threat. She has confirmed that the messages do not present negative stereotypes 
that could adversely affect older adults’ views on aging. Because the explicit messages may be paired wit h 
images of older adults, our team has carefully selected images that reflect a wide range of daily activity 
capabilities; images reflecting engagement in extraordinary activities (e.g., skydiving) were avoided. The 
final assessment session , led by a resea rch assistant,  will conclude with a careful and detailed debriefing 
conversation about aging stereotypes and their effects on health and wellness in older adults.  
Confidentiality. All information obtained from the participants will be kept confidential am ong appropriate 
members of the study group. During computerized data analysis, anonymity of all study participants will be 
assured by [CONTACT_520994] a single log, to be maintained and 
stored in a password -protected and HIPAA -compliant REDCap database . Access to the study ID log will 
only be g ranted to users that need this information to follow -up with the participant . With respect to study 
personnel who will interact with participants, we will maintain strict s tandards that forbid the leakage of 
information about study participants to unauthorized individuals either within or outside the study team. 
These strategies are likely to succeed in eliminating any possible harm to participants due to leaking of 
personal  information. A description of mitigating the risks of being audio recorded during the  interviews is 
included in s ection IV. A.3: Confidentiality. Each of the above safeguards is expected to substantially 
reduce the participants’ study participation risks.   
C. Potential Benefits to Human Subjects and Other   
All individuals who complete the four -month intervention will have access to specialty features of a physical 
activity -based smartphone app not yet commercially available. Because the risks are minimal, and because 
the study promises to generate knowledge about optimizing a smartphone app to encourage physical 
activity in older individuals, the benefits of the study outweigh the risks. For all participants, it is likely that 
the opportunity to participate  in a potentially successful mobile health intervention for older adults and the 
knowledge that one is aiding in the quest to develop improved mobile health interventions will benefit the 
participants to a degree that outweighs the risks.  
D. Importance of  Knowledge to be Gained   
The knowledge that will result from the study is expected to have important benefits for society. Older 
adults represent the most physically inactive age group, which places them at high risk for chronic, 
disabling conditions. The proposed PA  app suite is a unique mobile health tool that shows promise in 
improving older adults’ PA and overall health. A feasibility study of this app shows that older adults are 
willing to utilize a PA -tracking app  and find it easy to use and potential ly beneficial for health. The proposed 
study will provide valuable information on how to design and develop an acceptable and usable 
smartphone app intervention with maximal potential to improve physical activity and overall health in the 
ever-growing popu lation of older adults. This project will also support future development and testing of the 
PA-tracking app suite  compared to alternative mobile health interventions that target elders and thereby 
[CONTACT_520995]. The cumulati ve value of this knowledge far outweighs the 
risks identified in the previous section.

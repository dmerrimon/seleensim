The objectives of the study, conducted in subjects with cognitive impairment associated with 
schizophrenia, are the following:
Primary Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy of ASP4345 on cognitive impairment compared to placebo using change 
from baseline in MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) neurocognitive composite 
score (excluding social cognition domain) . The primary estimand will use a Hyp othetical Strategy 
and compare patients as though they had continued on the assigned treatment.

University of [LOCATION_004] San Diego Performance -based Skills Assessment -2 Extended Range 
(UPSA -2-ER) total score.
To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of ASP4345 and its metabolites, if necessary
Exploratory Objectives
To evaluate the effects of ASP4345 compared to placebo using:
○the 16 -item version of the Negative Symptom Assessment Scale (NSA -16)
○the individual domains of the MCCB 
○the assessment of general clinical symptoms with the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale 
(PANSS)
○the assessment of the Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale (CGI -S)
To evaluate the relationship between the CGI-S and MCCB neurocognitive composite score
To evaluate the relationship between the number of cognitive training levels, including repeat 
levels, completed (as a measure of compliance with cognitive training) and MCCB neurocognitive 
composite score

Version 2.0 Incorporating S ubstantial Amendment 1Statistical Methods:
Sample Size :
A total sample size of 210 subjects will be randomized in 3:2:2 ratio ( approximately 90 placebo and 
60 subjects each per active study arm) into 1 of 2 doses of ASP4345 or matching placebo. The sample 
sizewill provide approximately 82% power for the pairwise comparisons to placebo to detect an 
effect size of at least 0.43, assuming a 1 -sided 5% significance level, with statistical significan ce 
achieved at an effect size of approximately 0.[ADDRESS_1060194] sizes rather than statistical significance.  The number of subjects planned for this 
clinical study are considered sufficient to achiev e the clinical study objectives.
Efficacy :
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted on the full analysis set (FAS) and Intent -
to-Treat (ITT) set. The interpretation of results from statistical tests will be based on the FAS. The 
ITT will be used to assess the robustness of the results from the statistical tests based on the FAS. 
Analysis of the secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints will be done on the FAS.
A 2-sided significance level of 0.10, unless otherwise specified, will be us ed for all statistical tests on 
efficacy endpoints without multiplicity adjustment.
Based on the estimand, the primary endpoint will be analyzed using a Mixed Models Repeated 
Measures (MMRM) approach, with the corresponding score at baseline used as the co variate. Other 
continuous endpoints will be analyzed using either a MMRM or Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), 
depending on the schedule of events, with the corresponding scores at baseline used as a covariate.  A 
2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the treatment difference in least squares (LS) mean changes 
between ASP4345 and placebo will be provided.
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint and selected secondary/exploratory endpoints 
will be performed based on duration since the first ps ychotic break, smoking status, subject age, 
biotype and background antipsychotics. 
Pharmacokinetics :
Population pharmacokinetic model will be developed based on ASP4345 plasma concentration data 
obtained from subjects who have at least 1 pharmacokinetic s ample. Population pharmacokinetics 
and/or pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_772340]. All details of the population pharmacokinetic analysis will be described in a separate 
analysis plan and a separate population pharmacokinetic modeling report will be written.
Pharmacogenetics :
The pharmacogenetic parameters, mentioned under exploratory endpoints, will be analyzed using 
either an MMRM or ANCOVA model, as used for the analysis of the primary and some of the 
secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints.
Safety :
To characterize the safety profile, descriptive statistics will be provided for AEs, vital signs (body 
temperature, pulse rate and sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_9204]), clinical laboratory evaluations 
(hematology and biochemistry [including serum prolactin]), routine 12 -lead ECG recordings, 
C-SSRS, indices of metabolic syndrome, movement disorder, for each ASP4345 treatment and pooled 
placebo, where applicable.

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 11 INTRODUCTION
Protocol 4345 -CL-0015 is a proof -of-concept study  to examine the effects of ASP4345 in 
subjects with cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia on stable doses of risperidone, 
quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], ziprasidone, aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], paliperidone or lurasidone .
1.1 Back ground
Schizophrenia is a chronically  debilitating s yndrome that affects approximately 1% of the 
global populat ion and is accompanied by  [CONTACT_772341] 
[Awad & Voruganti, 2008].  The 3 primary  clinical sy mptom domains of schizophrenia 
include positive sy mptoms (delusions andhallucinations), negative s ymptoms (apath y, 
blunted affect, anhedonia, avolition, alogia, social and emotional withdrawal) and a wide 
range of cognitive sy mptoms, in addition to a general disorganization of thinking and 
behavior [Tandon et al, 2009]. Cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia ( CIAS) 
includ es significant deficits (approximately  [ADDRESS_1060199] deviation [ SD]below performance of 
healthy  control subjects) in attention/vigilance, processing speed, working memory , 
reasoning, problem solving, verbal memory , visual memory  and social cognition that are
present both in patients on antipsy chotics ,as well as drug -naïve patients [Fatouros -Bergman 
et al, 2014; Schaefer et al, 2013]. These impairments have been shown to be associated with 
several key  functional outcomes [Shamsi e t al, 2011; Green et al, 2000 ].
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter play ing a key  role in the central nervous s ystem (CNS) 
[Sny der et al, 1970].  The phy siological actions of dopamine are mediated by  [CONTACT_772342], which belong to the G protein -coupled receptor superfamily . On the bas is of their 
structural, pharmacological and biochemical properties, dopamine receptors are classified 
into either the D 1-class ( dopamine receptor t ype 1 [D 1]and dopamine receptor ty pe 5 
receptors) or the D 2-class ( dopamine receptor t ype2, dopamine recept or type3 and dopamine
receptor ty pe 4 receptors). Among them, D 1receptors are expressed at a high level of densit y 
in the dopamine rich area of the forebrain and play a crucial role in a variet y of cognitive 
functions [Zhang et al, 2009]. I t is reported that abnormal neurotransmission, especiall y the 
dopamine and glutamate (Glu) s ystem, play s a critical role in the pathoph ysiology  of 
schizophrenia. One of the therapeutic targets for CI AS is the activation of D 1receptors 
[Tamminga, 2006; Goldman -Rakic et al, 2004].  The hy peractivity  of dopamine in 
subcortical structures is thought to be associated with positive sy mptoms; whereas, D 1
receptor h ypoactivit y in the frontal cortical area has been suggested to be associated with 
negative s ymptoms and impaired c ognitive function [Laruelle, 2014]. Indeed, D 1receptors in 
the frontal cortex are reported to be involved in working memory  expression [Arnsten et al, 
1994].  These findings indicate that the stimulation of the D 1receptor is a promising target 
for improv ing CIAS; however, no D 1receptor agonist has been identified as a drug candidate 
for CIAS because of their powerful hy potensive effect [Blanchet et al, 1998; Duncker et al, 
1997].
Increased activation of D 1receptors remains a compelling mechanism of acti on to treat 
CIAS, as identified b y a consensus of academic and industry  experts during the Measurement 
and Treatment Research to I mprove Cognition in Schizophrenia initiative [Buchanan et al,

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment [ZIP_CODE]; Tamminga , 2006].  However, this mechanism has not been ade quately  tested in the 
clinic due to limitations of available D 1receptor agonists. Positive allosteric modulators 
(PAMs) are an alternative option for stimulating receptor function.  They  positively  modulate 
the effect of the agonist, which binds to the or thosteric site, without directly  stimulating the 
receptor [May  et al, 2004] and are therefore expected to exert agonist -like activity  with a 
lower incidence of undesirable side effects.  ASP4345 is an orally  available, small -molecule 
and selective D 1receptor PAM discovered b y Astellas Pharma Inc.  ASP4345 is expected to 
effectivel y ameliorate CIAS without side effects such as h ypotension.
1.[ADDRESS_1060200] of ASP4345 on the human D 1receptor was investigated using in vitro 
studies.  I n a cy clic adenosine monophosphate assay  using human D 1receptor -expressing 
cells, ASP4345 enhanced the potency  of dopamine in a concentration -related manner. In a
binding study , dopamine hydrochloride concentration -relatedl y inhibited binding o f 
[3H]SCH23390, a D1receptor antagonist radioligand, to D 1receptors.  ASP4345 (10 μmol/L) 
positively  modulated the dopamine -induced inhibitory  activity . This result suggests that 
ASP4345 enhances the binding activit y of orthosteric D 1receptor ligands. ASP4345 at a 
concentration of 10 μmol/L  had no appreciable affinity  (less than 50% inhibition 
displacement of specific binding) to the D1receptor orthosteric site or [ADDRESS_1060201] at the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was assessed in neonatally  1-(1-phen ylcyclohexy l) 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_119510] (PCP) -treated mice. Oral treatment with 1 mg/kg ASP4345 enhanced the c -fos 
expression in ( ±)-SKF38393 hy drochloride (1 mg/kg) -treated mice.
It is widel y accepted that cognitive deficits, including cognitive inflexibility  are a core feature 
of schizophrenia.  Cognitive flexibility  may  be assessed in rodents using the attentional 
set-shifting tas k (ASST).  The effect on extradimensional (ED) shift deficits using the ASST 
was evaluated in subchronic PCP -treated rats.  ASP4345 significantl y ameliorated ED shift 
deficits at doses of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg. 
The effect of ASP4345 on the release of neurotrans mitters at the mPFC was assessed in 
subchronic PCP -treated rats using an in vivo microdialy sis technique. Treatment of ASP4345 
increased the γ -aminobuty ric acid level at 1 and 30 mg/kg doses and dopamine efflux at the 
1 mg/kg dose.  Oral treatment of ASP4 [ADDRESS_1060202] glutamate efflux at any  dose.
In summary , results of both the in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that ASP4345 is an orally  
active D 1receptor PAM and a promising candidate for use in treating CIAS.
The preclinical toxicology studies a re reviewed in detail in the ASP4345 I nvestigator’s 
Brochure.  ASP4345 is considered a PAM with important findings noted below, including 
1rat death associated with renal toxicity  at the highest dose in a toxicological study  and 
while the reversibility  ofthe renal toxicity  was noted in survival animals.  In dogs, vomiting, 
salivation, blood pH/electroly te changes were observed but the histological changes in the 
kidney  observed during the 1 -week study  were not replicated in the 4 -week or 13 -week

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 1studies. Overall, the available toxicology  data indicate that the target organs are the liver, 
kidney s, adrenal glands, ovary , gastrointestinal (vomiting and salivation) and possible 
embry o-fetal toxicity .
Safety , tolerability ,and pharmacokinetics of ASP4345 have been evaluated in healthy  male 
and female subjects in a single ascending oral dose escalation study  (SAD; 4345 -CL-0001 )
and further, in male and female subjects with schizophrenia in a multiple ascending oral dose 
escalation s tudy (MAD; 4345 -CL-0002 ) in p hase 1 .  The mean exposure limit (AUC 24no 
greater than [ZIP_CODE] h•ng/mL ) for the SAD and MAD studies were based on the no -observed -
adverse -effect -levels (NOAELs) from the preclinical toxicology  studies.  A total of 
92subjects were treated with ASP4345 up to 900 mg single doses and 150 mg repeated doses 
during the phase 1 studies of 4345 -CL-0001 and 4345 -CL-0002.
ASP4345 was well -tolerated in the SAD study , consistent with the failure to identify  a 
maximum tolerated dose and an y clinicall y significant a dverse reactions with single doses up 
to 900 mg (Study  4345 -CL-0001).  There were no deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs) or 
study  discontinuations, and there were relativel y few treatment -emergent or dose -related 
adverse events (AEs).  Furthermore, there were not any  apparent dose -related effect on the 
incidence of total or an y specific AEs, laboratory  results, electrocardiograms (ECGs) or vital 
signs.
ASP4345 was well -tolerated in the MAD study , also consistent with the failure to identify  a 
maximum tole rated dose with multiple doses up to 150 mg/day  over 14 days.  In the MAD 
study (4345 -CL-0002), mean stead y-state conditions were reached by [CONTACT_772343] 5 of 
dosing across ASP4345 treatment groups, although 1 to 2 patients in each treatment group 
hadmore variability  due to the length of time it took for these patients to reach stead y-state. 
Mean stead y-state AUC taudid not exceed the mean exposure limit (AUC 24, day14 no greater 
than [ZIP_CODE] h•ng/mL) for any  ASP4345 treatment group, including the [ADDRESS_1060203] mean value observed in the 
50mg ASP4345 treatment group. Rac (AUC) was s imilar across ASP4345 treatment groups 
and was approximately  1-to 2-fold at stead y-state. There was no dose -dependency  observed 
for rate of absorption (t max), lag time (t lag) or half -life (t ½). There was no evidence of time 
variant pharmacokinetics (e.g., auto-induction or -inhibition).
Based on the results of the slope estimates for the dose range tested (3 to 150 mg ASP4345), 
both C max and AUC taufailed to achieve dose proportionality  at stead y-state due to an 
unknown pharmacokinetic variable. The amount of ASP4345 excreted in urine was small 
with < 1% of the dose excreted unchanged.
Phamacod ynamic effects of ASP4345 were also explored in the MAD trial by [CONTACT_772344]. The f ollowing tests were selected to cover a broad
spectrum of cognitive domains thought to be modulated by  [CONTACT_772345] y subtle 
changes in cognition as part of the specific CogState panel for schizophrenia: Detection

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 1Tasks (ps ychomotor function and information processing), Identification Tas k (visual 
attention) and One Back Task (attention and working memory ).
While the study  was not powered to see significant differences (including the 90% confidence 
interval [ CI]), the direction and magnitude of effect sizes for cognitive testing suggests t hat 
treatment with ASP4345 was associated with a benefit of ps ychomotor function, information 
processing and visual attention. For all doses of ASP4345, performance on the Detection Task 
wasnumerically  superior to baseline and placebo on day  14with effec t sizes ranging from 
0.577 to 0.993 . Once treatment “stopped ”these positive effects remained although they  were 
reduced in magnitude. For all doses of ASP4345, performance on the Identification Task was 
numericall y superior to placebo on day 14. There was no trend as compared to placebo for the 
One Back Task.
Neuroph ysiological E EGtesting in this study  included the Auditory  Steady -state Response 
(ASSR), Mismatch Negativity (MMN) and P300 assessments (P3a -FZ, P3b -CZ, P3b -PZ) that 
were performed over a 2-hour period. Regarding the EEG results, ASSR show ed a positive 
response as compared to placebo on day  [ADDRESS_1060204] medical history .
In multiple ascending dose s tudy (4345 -CL-0002), t he more common TEAEs occurring in 
>10% of patients in either the respective placebo group vs the ASP4345 group were 
headache (33.3%, 4/12 vs 25.0%, 9/36), somnolence (8.3%, 1/12 vs 19.4%, 7/36), dizziness 
(16.7%, 2/12 vs 5.6%, 2/36), insomnia (25.0%, 3/12 vs 8.3%, 3/36 ), back pain (none vs 
11.1%, 4/36), abdominal pain (16.7%, 2/12 vs none) and constipation (none vs 13.9%, 5/36). 
Therefore, with respect to TEAEs there was no clear pattern of tolerability  issues for 
ASP4345 compared with placebo in this study  with a limit ed sample size and duration of 
treatment.
Given nonclinical evidence of potential renal toxicity , laboratory  tests directly  assessing renal 
function were evaluated. Cy statin C values were monitored for changes in kidney  function
throughout and after the end-of-treatment ( EoT). In multiple ascending dose s tudy (4345 -CL-
0002), n o patients in an y ASP4345 dose group had changes from baseline to day  14 in 
cystatin C values > 30% compared to baseline.   There were no apparent dose -related effects 
on cy statin C val ues.
There were no clinicall y significant changes in hematology  or other chemistry  laboratory
analytes. This included an absence of patients with a potentially  clinically  significant value
for liver enz ymes or total bilirubin. With respect to vital sign fi ndings, there were no time -or 
dose-dependent changes apparent for pulse rates, sy stolic blood pressure or diastolic blood

During stud y 4345 -CL-0002, f rom a cardiac standpoint, no patient had a clinically  
significantl y abnormal ECG result at baseline or any  postbaseline time point through day 18 
([ADDRESS_1060206] dose). No patient had a QT interval using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF )
value > 480 msec through day  14 or a > [ADDRESS_1060207] to a 14 -day treatment
duration with daily  doses up to 150 mg.

cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia ( CIAS).  Therefore, the actual benefit of 
ASP4345 in the treatment of CIASis unknown. There are no known risks unambiguousl y
identified with this mechanism of action, as ASP [ADDRESS_1060210] -in-class compound for the 
proposed indication .Based on the safety profile from the phase 1 clinical studies and 
especiall y with subjects w ith schizophrenia , proceeding to phase 2 trials appear to be justified 
from a risk benefit assessment. 
An overview of the risk benefit of ASP 4345 can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure , 
including monitoring and mitigation steps taken to maintain safe ty of the subjects while on 
study treatment. Routine risk minimization procedures are planned in this study along with 
weekl y visits, including laboratory  assessments, so that increases in cy statin C suggesting renal 
toxicity  can be detected if a longer du ration of treatment is related to the risks. Due to the 
known effects of the antipsy chotic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_772307] a potential interaction with 
ASP4345, prolactin will also be monitored. Other risks are monitorable and reversible (liver 
toxicity  by [CONTACT_772346]; adrenal gland vacuolation b y adrenocorticotropic hormone).  Additional 
potential risks are reversible (vomiting and salivation) , therefore, no additional safet y 
monitoring is required. Other potential risks such as changes in blood pH/blood chlor ide were 
likely  due to the salt load for the administered dose and are unlikel y to be of relevance for 
human studies associated with lower drug exposures. Changes in blood pH/blood chloride 
were not observed during phase 1 studies.   Therefore, only  chlorid e will be monitored in this 
study  but for general monitoring of renal function as described above.

●Double -blind treatment period (12 weeks/84 day s)
●Follow -up period ([ADDRESS_1060212] dose)
Approximately  [ADDRESS_1060213] of approximately  90 placebo subjects and 60 subjects

matching placebo daily  (QD) for 12 weeks. Study treatment assignments will be according to 
the fo llowing table:

28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, [ADDRESS_1060216] with him/her or persons previously  authorized by  [CONTACT_772347].
Pharmacokinetic trough samples will be collected prior to dosing at day s 7, [ADDRESS_1060217] rument, cognitive testing will be 
performed at each screening visit, on day s 1 (prior to first dose), 42, and 84.  All MCCB 
assessments following randomization should be performed within a [ADDRESS_1060218] of nic otine and caffeine on cognitive testing, 
smoking and intake of coffee will not be allowed approximately  30minutes before the MCCB
assessment.
Study  day 84/EoT visit completes the treatment period for the subject. Subjects will return to 
the clini c for a follow -up visit on day  [ADDRESS_1060219] this PoC trial with separate 50 and 150 mg AS P4345 dose 
groups. This decision is based on the pharmacokinetic data and positive results for the 
apriori chosen electroencephalogram (EEG) evoked response and improvements in cognition 
(based on a specific CogState panel for schizophrenia) that were ob tained for the ASP4345 
50and 150 mg dose groups as compared with placebo in 4345 -CL-0002. An additional 
reason is not having observed safety  or adverse events of concern in the of the multiple 
ascending oral dose study (4345 -CL-0002). Further reasoning behind these dose choices 
follows.
ASP4345 is a D 1receptor PAM and it is standard to evaluate [ADDRESS_1060220], 
especiall y for a target where there is nonclinical data for both nonhuman primates and rodents 
suggesting potential inverted U do se (exposure) -response relationships. Both doses are within 
the presumptive nonclinical efficacious exposure range and evidence has been observed for 
Sponsor:  APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1060221] dose to the 150 mg dose 
and data from the 50 mg dose will be valuable if safet y data with the 150 mg dose are found 
to be inadequate.
Since the mean half -life of ASP4345 is approximately  10to 20 h and patients achieved 
steady -state in the ongoing study  by [CONTACT_4475] 14, the pharmacokinetic parame ters in a 12 -week 
study  are expected to be similar to the pharmacokinetic parameters observed on day 14 in 
Study  4345 -CL-0002.
The ability  of ASP4345 to improve cognitive impairment in subjects with schizophrenia will 
be assessed at doses of 50 mg and 150 mg QD over a period of 12 weeks.

The M.I.N.I. International Neurops ychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I. 7.02) is a short, structured 
diagnostic interview administered by  [CONTACT_21724] . The instrument captures the maj or 
Axis I  psychiatric disorders in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th 
edition (DSM -V)and ICD -10, and has demonstrated equivalent reliabilit y, validity , and 
decreased interview time when compared to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -V
diagnoses (SCID -P). Each module begins with screening questions that are answered yes or 
no. A negative response in the screening algorithm advances the interview to the next 
module, whereas a positive response will prompt additional questions t hat ask patients to 
characterize behavior with “y es” or “no” responses . Some questions contain a recall period 
(e.g., “Past Two Weeks ,”“Past Epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]” and “Current Epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]”) . After completion of the 
additional questions, the clinician indicates whether or not the diagnostic criteria have been 
met, based on the instrument scoring criteria [Amorim et al, 1998; Sheehan et al, 1998; 
Lecrubier et al, 1997; Sheehan et al, 1997] .

[IP_ADDRESS] University of San Diego Performance -based Skills Assessment -[ADDRESS_1060250] with schizophrenia in 
6 domains: household management, communication, financial skills, transportation, 
comprehension/planning and medication management.  The assessment is performed as a role -
play with the rater in which participants are asked to utilize props to demonstrate how well they  
perform every  day activities.  The UPSA -2-ERcontains additional questions to increase the level 
of difficulty  for each subscale .
As part of the MATRICS Coprimary and Translations (MATRI CS-CT) initiative, the Validation 
of Intermediate Measures (VIM) stud y established that the UPSA -2demonstrated good test -
retest reliability ,was not burdensome to patients and was adequate for repeated measurements .  
The VIM stud y also demonstrated that performance -based measures were strongl y correlated to 
cognition interview -based measures.  Based on the available evidence, the MATRI CS-CT 
initiative concluded that the UPSA -2was suitable as a coprimary  measure [Green et al, 2011].   
Additional evidence has demonstrated correlation with the MCCB battery  [Keefe et al, 2011 ].  In 
a study  reported b y Patterson and colleagues [2001], the UPSA -2performance correlated 
significantl y with the severity  of negative s ymptoms and symptoms of co gnitive impairment .  As 
described above, the UPSA -2-ER contains additional questions to increase the level of difficulty  
for each subscale and has been used in previous CIAS trials.
The UPSA -2-ER scoring will be completed by  [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_772312] s 1 and 84/EoT.
[IP_ADDRESS] Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
The PANSS was developed based on patient interviews [Kay  et al, 1987] and has been 
widely  used in schizophrenia trials. The validit y and reliability of the PANSS has bee n 
extensively  studied and established [L indenmay er et al, 1995], including its ability  to assess 
positive and negative s ymptoms in subjects with recent onset of schizophrenia [Emsley et al, 
2003].  The PANSS contains 30 -items rated on 7 -point L ikert scales and is scored to assess 
3subscales:  positive symptoms, negative s ymptoms and psy chopathological sy mptoms.  A 
5-factor structure has also been identified to explore changes in the traditional subscales, and 
also those that may  align with disorganized (or cognitive) factors, as well as excited and 
depression/anxiety  factors [L indenmay er et al, 1995].
Data from the PANSS is enhanced when subjects identify  a person who can serve as an 
informant for its completion.  Although not required for inclusion, sites and subjects are 
highl y encouraged to identify a reliable subject (e.g., family member, social worker or case

The SAS [Simpson & Angus, 1970] is a 10- item scale used to rate adverse neurological effects 
of antipsy chotic medications mo re broadl y. It involves direct observation and a brief
neurological examination. Rating requires the investigator to observe the patient’s gait and check 
for tremor, excessive salivation and rigidit y in the arms, shoulder and neck. Each item is rated 
from 0 to 4 and a total score can be obtained. Assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_1961] [INVESTIGATOR_772320]  42 and 84/EoT visits.
When possible continuity  of raters should be maintained across scales f or each patient.

In order to identify  any events that may  be associated with study  procedures and could lead to 
a change in the conduct of the study , Astellas collects AEs even if the subject has not 
received study  drug treatment. AE coll ection begins after the signing of the informed consent 
and will be collected until [ADDRESS_1060264] dose of study  drug.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Findings
Any abnormal laboratory test result ( e.g., hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinal ysis) or 
other safet y assessment (e.g., ECGs, radiolographic scans, vital signs measurements , phy sical 
examination ), including those that worsen from baseline, which is considered to be clinicall y 
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator andnot related to 
underly ing disease ,is to be reported as a serious adverse event or a nadverse event ([S]AE).
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  finding or other abnormal safet y assessment 
which is associated with the underl ying disease does not require reporting as an (S)AE , 
unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subjec t’s condition.
Repeating an abnormal laboratory  test or other safety  assessment , in the absence of an y of the 
above c riteria , does not const itute an AE.  Any  abnormal test result that is determined to be 
an error does not require reporting as an AE.

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 15.5.2 Definition of Serious A dverse Events
AnAEis considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes:
●Results in death
●Is life -threatening (an AEis considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AEthat, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death)
●Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  or substantial dis ruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions 
●Results in congenital anomaly , or birth defect
●Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (except for planned procedures as allowed per study) or 
leads to prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (except if prolongation of planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77745] b y an AE). H ospi[INVESTIGATOR_2476]/observation/examination caused b y 
AE is to be considered as serious .) 
●Other medicall y important events (defined in paragraph below)
Medical and scientific judgm ent should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77746] 1of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. These events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacity , usuall y are
considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or 
at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
The sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events.  I f an AEis 
reported that is considered to be an event per this classification as “alway s serious”, 
additional information on the event may  be requested.  
5.5.3 Criteria for Causal Relati onship to Study Drug
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the study  drug and the
occurrence of each (S)AE . The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the 
relationship. The investigator should also use theInvestiga tor’s Brochure (IB) . The 
investigator is requested to provide an explanation for the causality  assessment for each SAE 
and must document this on the SAE worksheet . The causalit y assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory  reporting r equirements. The investigator may  revise
his/her assessment of causality  in light of new information regarding the SAE and shall send 
an SAE follow -up report and update the eCRF with the new information and updated 
causality  assessment.
Following a review of the relevant data, t he causal relationship between the study  drug and 
each (S)AE will be assessed by  [CONTACT_49419] ‘ yes’ or ‘ no’ to the question “Do you consider 
Sponsor:  APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1060265] been caused by [CONTACT_50464] ”.
When making an assessment of causalit y, the following factors are to be considered when 
deciding if there isevidence and/or arguments to suggest there is a ‘reasonable possibility ’ 
thatan (S)AE may  have been caused by  [CONTACT_5257] (rather than a relationship cannot be 
ruled out ) or if there is evidence to reasonabl y deny a causal relationship:
●Plausible t emporal relationship between exposure to the study  drug and (S)AE onset 
and/or resolution. Has the subjec t actually  receive dthe study  drug? Did the (S)AE occur 
in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the study drug? 
●Plausibil ity; i.e., could the event been caused by  [CONTACT_24384]? Consider biologic 
and/or pharmacologic mechanism, half -life, literature evidence, drug class, preclinical 
and clinical study  data, etc.
●Dechallenge/ Dose reduction/ Rechallenge :
○Did the (S)AE resolve or improve after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_77747]? Also consider the impact of treatment for the event when evaluating a 
dechallenge experience. 
○Did the (S)AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been 
stopped?  
●Laboratory or other test result s; a specific lab investigation supports the assessment of 
the relationship between the (S)AE and the stud y drug (e.g., ba sed on values pre -, during 
and post -treatment)
●Available a lternative explanations independent of study  drug exposure ; such as other 
concomitant drugs, past medical history , concurrent or underl ying disease, risk factors 
including medical and family  history , season, location, etc. and strength of the alternative 
explanation
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor . However, it is very  important that 
the investigator alway s make an assessment of causality  for every  event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor. With limited or insufficient information about 
the event to make an informed judgment and in absence of any  indication or evi dence to 
establish a causal relationship, a causalit y assessment of ‘no’ is to be considered. In such 
instance, the investigator is expected to obtain additional information regarding the event as 
soon as possible and to re -evaluate the causality  upon rece ipt of additional information. 
5.5.4 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity  of each AE:
●Mild: No disruption of normal daily  activities
●Moderate: Affect normal dail y activities
●Severe: Inability  to perform dail y activities

5.5.7 Special Situations 
Certain Special Situations observed in association with the stu dy drug(s) , such as incorrect 
administration (e.g., wrong dose of study drug, comparator, or background therapy ) are 
collected in the eCRF , as Protocol Deviation per[Section 8.1.6 Protocol Deviations] or may 
require special reporting, as described below. These Special Situations are not considered 
AEs, but do require to be communicated to Astellas as per the timelines defined below .
If a Special Situation is associated with, or results in, an AE, the AE is to be assessed 
separately  from the Special Situation and captured as an AE in the eCRF. If the AE meets the 
definition of a SAE, the SAE is to be reported as described in [Section 5.5.5 Reporting of 
Serious Adverse Events ]and the details of the associated Special Situation are to be included 
in the clinical description on the SAE worksheet .
The Special Situations are:
●Pregnancy
●Medication Error, Overdose and “Off label use”
●Misuse/abuse
●Occupational exposure
●Suspected Drug -Drug interaction
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study  dosing period or within 28days from 
the discontinuation of dosing, the investigator is to report the information to the sponsor
according to the timelines in [Section 5.5.5 Reporting of Se rious Adverse Events ] using the 
Pregnancy  Reporting Formand i n the eCRF .
The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy  information on any  female partner of a male 
subject who becomes pregnant during the stud y dosing period or within 90days from the
Sponsor:  APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1060269] menstruation, 
estimated conception date, pregnancy  result and neonatal data etc., should be included in this 
information.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any  pregnancy  complication or 
termination (including elective termination) of a pregnancy  is to be reported for a female 
study  subject as an AE in the eCRF or SAE per Section 5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse 
Events. F or (S)AEs experienced b y a female partner of a male subject, (S)AEs are to be 
reported via the Pregnancy  Reporting Form.
Additional inform ation regarding the outcome of a pregnancy  when also categorized as an 
SAE is mentioned below :
●"Spontaneous abortion "includes miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion.
●Death of a newborn or infant within 1 month after birth is to be reported as an SAE
regardless of its relationship with the study  drug.
●If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, is to be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study  drug is judged as "possible "by 
[CONTACT_093].
●Congenital anomal y (including anomal y in miscarried fetus)
Unless a congenital anomaly  is identified prior to spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, the 
embry o or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects by  [CONTACT_77791]. (S)AEs 
experienced b y the newborn/infant should be reported via the Pregnancy  Reporting Form. 
Generally , follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery  
date.
[IP_ADDRESS] Medication Error, Overdose and “Off -Label Use”
If a Medication Error, Overdose or “Off lab el Use” (i.e. ,use outside of what is stated in the 
protocol) is suspected, refer to Section 8.1.6 Protocol Deviations . Any associated (S) AEs are 
tobe reported in the eCRF. Ifthe AE meets the definition of a SAE, the SAE is also to be 
reported as described in Section 5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events together with the 
details of the medication error, overdose or “Off -Label Use.”
In the event of suspected ASP [ADDRESS_1060270] should receive supportive care and 
monitoring. The Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_772353].

[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analysis
Consistent with the Hy pothetical Strategy  used for the estimand which is to compare patients 
as though they  had continued on the assigned treatment, MMRM w ill use all available on -
treatment data to inform end of treatment mean treatment effect estimates without requiring 
explicit imputation for missing data (i.e., for discontinued subjects). The primary  endpoint of 
change from baseline in MCCB neurocognitive composite score will be analy zed using a 
Mixed Models Repeated Measures (MMRM) approach. The model will contain terms for 
treatment group, pooled site, visit, and treatment by [CONTACT_765], with the MCCB score at baseline 
used as a covariate. Least squares (LS) means (± standard error [SE]) and 2 -sided 90% CI s 
for the LS mean treatment differences between each dose of ASP4345 and placebo will be 
presented for the primary endpoint. There will be no adjustment made for multiple 
comparisons. The primary  analy sis wil l use the FAS.
There will be two h ypotheses tested. H ypothes is 1 is given as follows:
H0A: The LS mean change from baseline at week 12 for Group A (50 mg ASP4345)

obese h yperlipoproteinemic and/or diabetic patients ,and may  be associated with 
fluctuating AT levels.  The investigator should ensure that the medical hist ory form 
captures an y illness that predates stud y enrollment that may be relevant in assessing 
hepatic function. 
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recre ational drug use and 
special diets.  Medications, is to be entered inthe (e) CRF .  Information on alcohol, other

●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agent s.
●Based on the subject ’s history ,  other testing may  be appropriate including: 
○Acute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious agents) ,
○Ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease ,
○Other laboratory  tests including INR, direct bi lirubin .
●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations .
●Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an

Study Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFT’s, such as vi ral hepatitis, preexisting or 
acute liver disease ,or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury, the subject may  
be discontinued from the study . The investigator may  determine that it is not in the subject’s 
best interest to continue study  enro llment. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered 
if:

Version 2.0 In corporating Substantial Amendment 112.5 Retrospective Pharmacogenetics Sub-Study
INTRODUCTION
Pharmacogenetics ( PGx)research aims to provide information regarding how naturall y 
occurring changes in a subject’s gene and/or expression based on genetic variation may 
impact what treatment options are best suited for the subject. Through investigation of PGx 
by [CONTACT_77815][INVESTIGATOR_007], gene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome -Wide 
Association Studies, the relationship between gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, efficacy  or 
toxicity  may  be better understood. As many  diseases may  be influenced by  1or more gen etic 
variations, PGx research may  identify  which genes are involved in determining the way  a 
subject may  or may  not respond to a drug.
OBJECTIVES
The PGx research that may  be conducted in the future with acquired blood samples is 
exploratory . The objective of this research will be to analy zeor determine genes of relevance 
to clinical response, pharmacokinetics and toxicity /safety  issues.
By [CONTACT_77816], it may  be possible to predict an individual subject’s response 
to treatment in terms of efficacy  and/or toxicity .
SUBJECT PARTICIPATIO N
Subjects who have consented to participate in this study  may participate in this PGx sub -
study . As part of this sub -study , subjects must provide written consent prior to providing an y 
blood samples that may  be used at a later time for genetic analy sis.
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE
Subjects who consent to participate in this sub -study  will provide one 4 mL tube of whole 
blood per Astellas’ instructions. Each sample will be identified by  [CONTACT_772364] 
(first code). Samples will be shipped frozen to a designated banking CRO either directly  from 
site or via a central laboratory  as directed by  [CONTACT_77818].
PHARMACOGENETICS ANALYSIS
Details on the potential PGx analy sis cannot be established y et. Astellas may initiate the PGx 
analysis incase evidence suggests that genetic variants may  be influencing the drug’s 
kinetics, efficacy  and/or safety. 
DISPOSAL OF PHARMACOGENETICS SAMPLES/DATA
All PGx samples collected will be stored for a period of up to [ADDRESS_1060311]’s withdraw notification is received, the PGx sample will be 
destroy ed. The results of any  PGx anal ysis conducted on a sample prior to its withdrawal will 
be retained at Astellas indefinitely .

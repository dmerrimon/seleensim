weeks and DLco, FRC  & TLC by [CONTACT_451995] 1 .5 
years (Week 76) and 2.5 years (Week 128).  
Safety  Assessments:  
Treatment Period: Tolerability/Safety -Related  Assessments  
Safety will be evaluated from reported adverse events  (AEs) , scheduled physical 
examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory test results.  Adverse events and concomitant 
medications will b e assessed at all study visits.  In addition, information regarding 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], emergency depar tment visits, and unscheduled or urgent care visits to a 
health care provider due to a deterioration in respi[INVESTIGATOR_451920].   
Statistical Methods:  
The primary analysis is planned after last subject  comple ted W28 assessment.   Continuous 
variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_451996] ( e.g., number of 
observations, number of missing observations, mean, SD, median, interquartile range, 
maximum, and minimum). Categorical variables will be tabulated by [CONTACT_451997] , and percentages will be calculated using the number of available observations as 
the denominator (i.e. excluding missing values) . Efficacy evaluations will be performed using 
the Full Analysis Set (FAS) , defined as all subjects with a Baseline and at least [ADDRESS_576169]-Baseline 
observation for the primary  efficacy endpoint.  A per -protoco l analysis will also be  carried out 
on the Per Protocol (PP) set, a subset of the FAS composed of all subject s treated with the 
IMP, having received at least the planned IMP infusions on days 1, 3, 5, and weeks 4, [ADDRESS_576170], for the FAS and Safety analysis 
datasets.  (Additional details will be included in the SAP.)  
 
This study is randomized with a 2:[ADDRESS_576171]’s  baseline treatment 
status: baseline pi[INVESTIGATOR_451921]. The 
randomization system will also ensu re that at least 25% of the subject s in the final study 
population are on no other therapy for IPF at baseline.  
 
The comparison of PRM -151 with placebo will be carried out via 2 -sided statistical tests at 
alpha=0. 10. The primary endpoint  will be tested with analysis of variance (ANOVA), with 
change from Baseline to week 28 in FVC% predicted as dependent variable (outcome), and 
treatment  and stratum, as explanatory variables.  FVC% predicted will also be analyzed  
separately for each level o f the stratum variable (in subjects on a stable dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_451922]) using analysis of variance 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151-202  Version 4.0 
 
10 
 (ANOVA), with change from Baseline to week 28 in FVC% predicted as dependent variable 
(outcome), a nd treatment  as the explanatory variable.  In case of missing Week 28 assessment 
of FVC% predicted, the last available observation will be carried forward.  
 
A similar analysis will be done for the secondary and exploratory endpoint s, replacing FVC % 
predic ted with the other endpoint s as appropriate.  Analyses over time will use a three -way 
ANCOVA with time (nominal study week) as the third factor, including all interactions.  The 
analysis will adjust for correlated errors over time.  
For all secondary and ex ploratory efficacy endpoint s, the a nalyses will be based on observed 
data only; no data will be imputed.  
 
AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_451998] (MedDRA) and summarized by [CONTACT_9313], pre ferred term, and treatment 
group for the number and percent of AEs reported, the number of subjects reporting each AE, 
and the number of subjects with any AE.  A by -subject  AE data listing including onset and 
resolution dates, verbatim term, preferred term , treatment, severity, relationship to treatment, 
action taken, and outcome will be provided.   
 
Safety data, including laboratory evaluations and vital signs assessments, will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_451999].  In addition, change from Baseline to any 
post-dose values will be summarized for vital signs and clinical laboratory results.  The 
frequency of subjects with abnormal safety laboratory results will be tabulated by [CONTACT_3148].  
 
Sample Size Considerations:  
The primary objective is not to formally demonstrate  the superiority of PRM -[ADDRESS_576172] of  PRM -151 on change from 
baseline to 28 weeks in mean FVC% predicted, hereafter referred to as the p rimary endpoint . 
Nevertheless, the sample -size has been calculated to ensure a sufficient power to demonstrate 
the efficacy of PRM -[ADDRESS_576173] sizes in the two groups and on the variability o f the primary endpoint. The primary 
endpoint  will be tested in a model taking into account the stratification variable ( two types of 
subjects: subjects on a stable dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735], and subjects not on other treatment for IPF ). 
The sample size calculati on is based on the following assumptions:  
 Primary endpoint  is normally distributed . 
 Homogeneity of variance, i.e. the standard deviation is the same in both arms, and 
for both types of subjects.  
 Randomization  ratio PRM -151: placebo  equals 2:1.  
 Expected value of the primary endpoint  for subjects on pi[INVESTIGATOR_451923] -1.5. 
 Expected value of the primary endpoint  for subjects on no other treatment will be -
3. 
 Expected value of the primary endpoint  for subjects on PRM -151 will be ≥ 0.75. 
 Standard deviation of the primary endpoint  is 5. 
 75% of subjects will be on a stable dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16365] . 
PRM -151

11 
  25% of subjects will not be on other treatment for IPF . 
 Significance level ( α) = 0.10. 
 Desired power to demonstrate superiority is 80%. 
A sample size of one hundred and two  (102) evaluable subjects in total ( 68 PRM -151 and 34 
placebo) is enough to demonstrate superiority at p < 0.10 with a power of 80%  under the 
above assumptions . Assuming a non -evaluability rate of about 15%, 117 subjects in total (78 
PRM -151 and 39 placebo) are to be enrolled. Stratified randomization will ensure a balance  of 
PRM -151: placebo  in subject s on pi[INVESTIGATOR_451924].

 1. INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE 
1.1. I
diopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis 
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare, specific form of chronic, fibrosing, 
inte
rstitial pneumonia limited to the lung.  In the [LOCATION_002] (US), IPF is estimated to 
affect up to 135,000 individuals, with approximately 50,000 cases being diagnosed 
annua
lly (Raghu, Weycker et al. 2006). It is estimated that each year, 40,000 people in 
the US die due to IPF or complications thereof (Raghu, Weycker et al. 2006), the same as 
for breast cancer.  There is limited information regarding the incidence and prevalence of 
IPF in the European Union (EU); however, it is estimated that up to 40,000 individuals 
are
 affected, with 5,000 cases diagnosed annually in the [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006]) alone 
(Navaratnam, Fleming et al. 2011). IPF incidence and prevalence increase with age and 
are higher among males (Nalysnyk, Cid-Ruzafa et al. 2012).  Overall, it is estimated that 
worldwide, 5
 million individuals may be affected (Melt zer and Noble 2008).  Although 
rare, the incidence of IPF is increasing, likely due to an increasing understanding of the 
disease and the recent development of uniform diagnostic criteria (Nalysnyk, Cid-Ruzafa 
et al. 2012)
 
IPF is a progressive disease with significant morbidity and mortalit y. The precise 
initi
ating injury is unknown, and the clinical course of IPF is variable.  The fibrosis that 
develops in IPF follows a similar path to normal wound healing, but is progressive and 
without resolution.  A loss of control of the mechanisms halting the normal wound 
healing process leads to persistence of inflammatory cells (particularly monocyte-derived 
cell populations such as macrophages and fibrocytes), elevated levels of cytokines, 
chemokines, growth factors and other signaling molecules, excessive deposition of 
collagen types 1 and 3, and inhibition of enzymes that degrade extracellular matrix 
(ECM) proteins (Lupher and Gallatin 2006).  Over time, continuing insults result in 
progre
ssive lung fibrosis (pathologic accumulation of excessive ECM), and increasingly 
compromised lung function due to thickening/stiffening of the alveoli.  Signs and 
symptoms that develop over time include exertional dyspnea and cough as well as 
fatigue, weight loss, myalgia, and clubbing of the fingers and toes. 
Ultimately, IPF leads to death, with a median survival after diagnosis of 3 years and a 
5-year survival rate of 20% to 40% (Gomer and Lupher 2010). Estimates are that IPF is 
the prim
ary cause of death for 60% of subjects with IPF, with death commonly occurring 
afte
r an acute exacerbation of the disease. When an acute exacerbation of IPF is not the 
ca
use of death, other common causes include acute coronary syndromes, congestive heart 
failure, lung cancer, infection, and venous thromboembolic disease (Frankel and Schwarz 
2009). 
No c
ure currently exists for IPF. There are two approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_451927]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_451928] 28, 2011, for 
treatm
ent of mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), based on a statistically 
significant reduction in the decline of percent predicted FVC from Baseline at Week 72 
(p=0.001) in subjects receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_451929]. 
PRM -[ADDRESS_576183]
bo in change in % FVC from baseline to Week 52, with the proportion of subject s 
dec
lining being lower on pi[INVESTIGATOR_451930].  Nintedanib was approved in the 
US on October
 15, 2014, for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, based on a statistically 
significant reduction in the annual rate of decline of FVC (in mL) in subjects receiving 
nintedanib compared to subjects receiving placebo in [ADDRESS_576184]’s medical 
history and clinical condition.  Such treatments may include long-term oxygen (O 2) 
thera
py; pulmonary rehabilitation; opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]; anti-reflux therapy; and low dose 
corticosteroids to treat cough.  Although such therapi[INVESTIGATOR_451931]’ 
symptoms and improve comfort, they do not slow the progression of the disease or 
prolong survival.  One exception is lung transplantation, which may be considered for 
subjects at increased risk of mortality, leads to an improvement in 5-year survival post-
transplantation to 50 to 56 % (Raghu, Collard et al. 2011).However, transplantation is 
ge
nerally recommended for subjects aged <60 years and, given that IPF is primarily a 
disease of the elderly with a mean age at diagnosis of 74 year s (Fernandez Perez, Daniels 
et al. 2010), most subjects do not fall into a group for which transplant is a likely option. 
1.2. PRM-151  
Pentraxin-2 (PTX-2), also called serum amyloid P (SAP), is an endogenous protein that 
circ
ulates in the bloodstream.  Recent discoveries about the biology of tissue repair and 
fibrosis have elucidated the important role that PTX-[ADDRESS_576185] that binds to Fc 
gamma receptors on monocytes and promotes their differentiation into regulatory 
macrophages (Mreg), which function to promote epi[INVESTIGATOR_451932].  PTX-2 also prevents the differentiation of monocytes into 
M2 pro-fibrotic macrophages and fibrocytes, preventing the formation of fibrosis.  Both 
increased fibrocyte numbers in circulation (Moeller, Gilpin et al. 2009) and decreased 
levels of c
irculating PTX-2 (Murray, Chen et al. 2011) have been characterized in IPF 
subje
cts relative to healthy subjects. 
PR
M-151 is a recombinantly-expressed version of human pentraxin-2 (hPTX-2). Like the 
nati
ve human protein, PRM-151  is expressed and purified as a non-covalent, homo-
pentameric glycoprotein. Each monomer in the pentamer is comprised of 204 amino 
acids with one N-linked glycosylation site at Asn32 possessing a typi[INVESTIGATOR_451933]. There is one intramolecular disulfide bond between the only 2 
cysteine residues in each monomer: Cys36-Cys95. The average molecular weight of the 
fully glycosylated, sialylated pentamer is [ADDRESS_576186] to support the investigation of PRM-151 in the 
treatment of fibrotic diseases.  
1.2.1. Preclinical Pharmacology 
Following the initial in vitro  discovery by [CONTACT_452000][INVESTIGATOR_451934]-2 may 
regulate monocyte differentiation into spi[INVESTIGATOR_451935] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_17378], Buckley et al. 
2003), they, with others, published several studies on the activity of species-specific serum-derived PTX-2 in preventing fibrosis in models of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in rats and mice and also in a model of ischemia reperfusion injury to mouse heart  (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_17378], Roife et al. 2007),(Haudek, Xia et al. 2006). Promedior and its 
collaborators have expanded the animal fibrosis model data using human serum-derived 
PTX-2 and PRM-151 to demonstrate potent anti-fibrotic activity in models of lung injury, 
skin injury, kidney injury, liver injury, radiation-induced injury, and a rabbit trabeculectomy model of eye injury. 
1.2.2. Nonclinical Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics 
The half-life (t
1/2) of IV-dosed PTX-2/PRM-151 (2-7 mg/kg) has been calculated for 
multiple species, with the following results: mouse (4-8 hr) < rabbit (7.3 hr) < monkey 
(6-15 hr) < rat (13-23 hr) < human (30 hr, [human t 1/2 from Promedior single, ascending 
dose study, PRM151A-11EU; 10 mg/kg dose in healthy volunteers])(Hawkins, Wootton et al. 1990). 
Toxicokinetics (TK) in the rat and monkey 14-day repeat IV-dose studies showed dose-
proportional increases in systemic exposure, with slight to moderate increases in 
exposure with multiple dosing. Anti- PRM-[ADDRESS_576187] the TK parameters in these studies.  In a 6 month toxicology study in rats, Cmax and AUC were dose proportional at baseline but not at later time points.  Investigation of this phenomenon indicates that AUC at later time points is falsely low due to interference by [CONTACT_74939]-Drug Antibodies/ Anti-Pentraxin 2 antibodies ( ADA) in the PK assay. 
Following IV administration of radiolabeled PRM-151, the highest percentage of the administered dose was measured in the systemic tissues at [ADDRESS_576188]-dose; the highest values were in the liver, kidneys, lung, and spleen. A CYP450 inhibition/stimulation study showed no inhibition of the 5 enzymes tested. 
1.2.3. Toxicology 
No adverse toxicological effects were observed in 14-day IV daily dose studies in 
Sprague Dawley rats at doses ranging from 10 to 200 mg/kg/day or in cynomolgus monkeys at doses ranging from 12 to 120 mg/kg/day.  The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 14 daily IV doses of PRM-151 was set at ≥ 200 mg/kg in rats and ≥ 120 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys.  Six-month toxicology studies were initiated in 
Sprague Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys employing weekly dosing, and acute infusion reactions, some resulting in death, occurred in both studies beginning on Day 15. et al. 1990).

month toxicology study in rats, Cmax and AUC were dose proportional at baseline but 
not at later time points.  Investigation of this phenomenon indicates that AUC at later

antibodies ( ADA) in the PK assay. 
Following IV administration of radiolabeled PRM-151, the highest percentage of the 
administered dose was measured in the systemic tissues at [ADDRESS_576190]-dose; the highest 
values were in the liver, kidneys, lung, and spleen. A CYP450 inhibition/stimulation 
study showed no inhibition of the 5 enzymes tested. 
1.2.3. Toxicology 
No adverse toxicological effects were observed in 14-day IV daily dose studies in 
Sprague Dawley rats at doses ranging from 10 to 200 mg/kg/day or in cynomolgus 
monkeys at doses ranging from 12 to 120 mg/kg/day.  The no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) of 14 daily IV doses of PRM-151 was set at ≥ 200 mg/kg in rats and 
≥ 120 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys.  Six-month toxicology studies were initiated in 
Sprague Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys employing weekly dosing, and acute 
infusion reactions, some resulting in death, occurred in both studies beginning on Day 15. 
PRM -[ADDRESS_576191] dose from 200 to 150 mg/kg, and the study continued to completion, with a NOAEL of 100 mg/kg based on a death of one rat unrelated to an acute infusion reaction at the 150/200 mg/kg dose.  There were also adverse findings of liver fibrosis at the 150/200 mg/kg dose level.  The monkey study was terminated early after a death at the lowest dose level due to an infusion reaction.  The acute infusion reactions were determined to be secondary to complement activation by [CONTACT_14181]-drug antibodies to PRM-151, a human protein foreign to both test species. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with 
PRM-151.  Increased testes weights were observed in a mouse dose range-finding study, but the relationship to test article administration could not be determined due to the small 
number of animals in the study.  However, no treatment-related findings (organ weights 
or histopathology) were identified in the reproductive organs of rats or cynomolgus monkeys in the 14-day or rats in the 6-month IV dose toxicology studies.  Women of childbearing potential will be required to take precautions to prevent pregnancy in the current study. 
As noted above, PRM-151 is immunogenic in non-human species.  Phenotypes of 
deficient or knockout mice may identify potential consequences of PRM-151-induced neutralizing or depleting antibodies to hPTX-2. To date, there has been no toxicity associated with complete deficiency of PTX-2 in mice (Gillmore, Hutchinson et al. 2004), and therefore the toxicity risks due to generation of depleting or neutralizing antibodies to PRM-151 or hPTX-2 are considered low. 
PRM-151 is dose equivalent in humans and non-human species, and the dose of 10 
mg/kg selected for the current study has a safety margin of 10 compared to the rat NOAEL of 100 mg/kg.  Moreover, the NOAEL in rats was based on 10 mg/kg every week with a total of 2600 mg/kg in 26 weeks, whereas humans are being dosed at 10 mg/kg days 1, 3, and 5 and then every 4 weeks for a total of 90 mg/kg in 24 weeks. 
1.2.4. Clinical Experience in Healthy Subjects and Subjects with IPF and 
Myelofibrosis ( MF) 
PRM-[ADDRESS_576192] 36 weeks of treatment in a study extension.  
In a single ascending dose study (PRM151A-11EU), there were no dose limiting 
toxicities and no serious adverse events (SAEs) were noted. The most frequent (≥15%) 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) for the PRM-151-treated subjects were fatigue (38%) and headache (19%). Overall, the data indicate that single doses of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg were safe and well tolerated. The t
1/[ADDRESS_576193] dose from 200 to 150 mg/kg, and the study continued to completion, with a 
NOAEL of 100 mg/kg based on a death of one rat unrelated to an acute infusion reaction 
at the 150/200 mg/kg dose.  There were also adverse findings of liver fibrosis at the 
150/200 mg/kg dose level.  The monkey study was terminated early after a death at the 
lowest dose level due to an infusion reaction.  The acute infusion reactions were 
determined to be secondary to complement activation by [CONTACT_14181]-drug antibodies to PRM-
151, a human protein foreign to both test species. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with 
PRM-151.  Increased testes weights were observed in a mouse dose range-finding study, 
but the relationship to test article administration could not be determined due to the small 
number of animals in the study.  However, no treatment-related findings (organ weights 
or histopathology) were identified in the reproductive organs of rats or cynomolgus 
monkeys in the 14-day or rats in the 6 -month IV dose toxicology studies.  Women of 
childbearing potential will be required to take precautions to prevent pregnancy in the 
current study.
As noted above, PRM-151 is immunogenic in non-human species.  Phenotypes of 
deficient or knockout mice may identify potential consequences of PRM-151-induced 
neutralizing or depleting antibodies to hPTX-2. To date, there has been no toxicity 
associated with complete deficiency of PTX-2 in mice (Gillmore, Hutchinson et al.

 In a multiple ascending dose study (PRM151F-12GL), 21 subjects with IPF were 
enrolled in successive cohorts of 7 subjects each, randomized 5:2 to receive either 
PR
M-151 or placebo. Each cohort was assigned a progressively increasing dose level of 
P
RM-151 : 1, 5,  or 10 mg/kg administered IV on Days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 15.  Subjects in all 3 
PRM-151 dose groups demonstrated improvement in FVC% predicted at Day 57 after 
rec

T data that has not been modified by [CONTACT_452002].  Previous studies have shown that quantification of lung 
parenchyma by [CONTACT_452003] (Zavaletta, Bartholmai et al.), that these parameters correlate 
with known marke
rs of disease severity such as  FVC%, DLCO, 6MWT² and GOLD 
classification (Raghunath 2014) and that changes in ILA features over time are predictive 
of mortalit
y in U IP (Maldonado, Moua et al.). The Lung Texture Analysis software was 
previousl
y utilized for quantitative evaluation of HRCT data in greater than 4000 ILD 
and COPD subjects within the NHLBI/NIH-funded Lung Tissue Research Consortium 
effort. This technique was used in a retrospective analysis of PRM-[ADDRESS_576199] scans were ≥ [ADDRESS_576200] or measured by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_038].  Lung Texture Analysis results were 
reported as change from screening to Day 57 in % total lung volume occupi[INVESTIGATOR_451938] (ground glass, reticular or honeycombing) and non-ILA (normal 
parenchyma or mild LAA).  Areas of moderate or severe LAA that are characteristic of 
emphysema were excluded from the analysis.  Quantitative imaging data was analyzed in 
16 subje
cts who had ≤ [ADDRESS_576201] and Day 1 PFTs. There was a 
strong negative correlation between baseline FVC % predicted and percent of lung 
volume identified as ILA by [CONTACT_452004]. Non-ILA lung 
decreased in all placebo subjects and was stable or increased in 5 PRM-151 treated 
subjects, all of whom had stable or increased FVC % predicted. There was no clear 
correlation between the magnitude of change in FVC% predicted and %Non-ILA, 
possibly due the limitations inherent to retrospective analysis of the HRCT data.  The 
analysis was confounded in [ADDRESS_576202] been 
performed at TLC on the Day 57.  
1.4. Rationale for Current Study 
IPF is a progressive disease that leads to significant morbidity and mortality, with a 
median survival after diagnosis of 3 years and a 5-year survival rate of 20 to 40% (Gomer 
and Lupher 2010).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_451939], no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_451940]. IPF remains a progressive disease with no cure other 
than lung transplant in selected subjects. Thus, there is still a significant unmet medical 
need for subjects with IPF, particularly those with severe disease (Nalysnyk, Cid-Ruzafa 
et al. 2012). 
As summ
arized previously, encouraging efficacy data were obtained in a Phase 1 study of 
PRM-151 in a relatively small number of subjects with IPF (n=15) who received 
PR
M-151 administered via 30-minute IV infusion at doses of 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg on 
Day
s 1, 3, 5, 8, and 15, with all 3 groups demonstrating improvement in FVC % 
predicte
d at Day 57.  Furthermore, [ADDRESS_576203] 5% from Baseline in FVC % predicted.  These results 
seen a
t [ADDRESS_576204] result with pi[INVESTIGATOR_451941] a reduction in the rate of decline rather than improvement in FVC (King, Bradford et 
al.; Richeldi, du Bois et al.).  Improvements from Baseline were also observed in FVC 
measure
d in milliliters and in 6MWT distance for PRM-151-treated subjects.  Review of 
safe
ty data from this study demonstrated that PRM-151at doses up to 10 mg/kg were safe 
and we
ll tolerated in subjects with IPF. No SAEs were observed over 57 days, and 
simil
ar types and number of TEAEs were reported in both PRM-151- and placebo-treated 
subje
cts. 
Ba
sed on these encouraging data in a small cohort of subjects with IPF, Promedior has 
planned to i
nvestigate the effects of PRM-151 in the proposed study involving a larger 
population of subj
ects with this condition. 
1.5. R
isk/Benefit Assessment 
PRM-151, a recombinant form of an endogenous human protein, has been well tolerated 
in 
preclinical toxicology studies and Phase [ADDRESS_576205] been completed, 
with no SAE
s reported and no other safety signals seen. The single ascending dose study 
(PRM151A-
11EU) tested dose levels as high as 20 mg/kg. The multiple ascending dose 
study
 (PRM151F-12GL) demonstrated that PRM-151 administered by 30-minute IV 
infusion on Da
ys 1, 3, 5, 8 and 15 at up to 10 mg/kg was safe and well tolerated in 
subje
cts with IPF, with no SAEs noted in 57 days; similar types and number of TEAEs 
were
 reported in both PRM-[ADDRESS_576206] s 
(median a
ge 67 years) with a serious, life threatening disease. 
Risks associated with PRM-[ADDRESS_576207] that was 
rechallenged; anti-drug antibody was detected in one of them. 
PRM-[ADDRESS_576208] benefit 
fr
om participation in studies; the potential benefits of PRM-[ADDRESS_576209] is typi[INVESTIGATOR_451942].   The protocol's radiation dose 
is "as low as reasonable achievable" (ALARA) to obtain the quality of images necessary 
for imaging of lung abnormalities and quantification by [CONTACT_452005].  
The main potential risk from exposure to radiation is cancer. The relative risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_451943], such as future development of radiation-
induced malignancy, is exceedingly small compared to the risk of mortality inherent to

 IPF.  From currently available data, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has 
adopted a risk value for an occupational dose of 1 rem (0.01 Sieverts) Total Effective 
Dose Equivalent (TEDE) of approximately [ADDRESS_576210] of less than 3 
mill
iSieverts (0.003 Sieverts) per scan.  Dose will be adjusted appropriately to assure 
consistent image quality, based on subject size.  No populations at potentially higher risk 
for ra
diation exposure such as young children or pregnant women will be involved in the 
study.

 4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
4.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
The current study is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pi[INVESTIGATOR_451950]-151 administered through Week 24 
to subjec
ts with IPF. Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria for the study will be 
randomized to PRM-151 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks or placebo.  Efficacy will be evaluated 
through pulm
onary function tests (PFTs), high resolution CT (HRCT), 6-minute walk test 
(6MWT)
, and Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs). 
 
Subjec
ts will be evaluated for study eligibility during Screening within 4 weeks before 
enrollment and Baseline assessments.  Subjects who are determined to be eligible, based 
on Screening assessments, will be enrolled in the study and randomly allocated to 
treatm
ent with PRM-151 or placebo.  Subjects will receive study drug treatment for 24 
weeks. 
Approximately 117 subjects will be randomly assigned on a 2:1 basis to treatment with 
PR
M-151 or placebo, as follows: 
 PRM-151 10 mg/kg IV infusion over 60 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5, then one 
infusion ever
y 4 weeks  
 P lacebo IV infusion over 60 minutes on Week days 1, 3, and 5, then one infusion 
every 4 weeks 
The randomization will use a 2:1 ratio (PRM-151: placebo). The randomization will also 
be stra
tified according to other treatments for IPF (subjects receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_451951]). 
After
 completion of study treatment through Week 24, all subjects may receive PRM-151 
10 mg/k
g IV infusion over 60 minutes Days 1, 3, and 5, then once every 4 weeks for an 
indefini
te period of time in an open label study extension.  Dosing will be administered 
on Day
s 1, 3, and 5 will be repeated once every 28weeks during the extension. 
4.1.1. Treatment Period: Efficacy-related Assessments 
Subjects undergo testing on an every 4-week basis after randomization (occurring at 
We
eks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28) for efficacy and safety.   
During
 treatment, PFTs, 6MWT, and PROs will be performed on an every 4-week basis.  
HRCT w
ill be performed on Day [ADDRESS_576216] be done on the same day.  PFTs will be reviewed centrally by

6.1. Investigational Product 
All study drugs are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context 
of this study.  All study drugs will be supplied by [CONTACT_452013].   
6.2. Trea
tment(s) Administered 
Subjects will be randomized to receive the study drug PRM-151 or placebo.  Subjects 
randomized to placebo will receive intravenous (IV) infusions of sterile saline solution 
over 60 minutes. Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for more detail. 
Subjects randomized to study drug will receive intravenous (IV) infusions of 10 mg/kg 
PR
M-[ADDRESS_576233]’s baseline weight.  Refer to 
the Pharmac
y Manual and the Investigator’s Brochure for detailed instructions on special 
precautions and handling and requirements for weight based dose recalculations.  
On all
 dosing days, dosing will occur after  all safety and efficacy assessments scheduled 
for that vis
it are completed 
Medical personnel authorized by [CONTACT_452014]. 
Subjects should be observed for one-hour post infusion to monitor for infusion related 
rea
ctions. 
In the case of occurrence of signs and symptoms consistent with infusion related reaction, 
follow institutional protocol and reduce the rate of infusion of PRM-151 to half the initial 
rate; consider discontinuing infusion of PRM-151 if symptoms do not respond 
immediately to medical intervention.  If signs and symptoms do not resolve immediately 
by
 [CONTACT_452015], discontinue infusion of PRM-151. If signs and symptoms resolve 
with inter
vention including discontinuation of PRM-151, PRM-151 infusion may be 
restarted at half the initial rate. 
In the event of an infusion related reaction (IRR) beginning after treatment on Baseline, 
an ECG is performed and a blood sample for cytokines is  collected as soon as possible 
afte

 PRM-151 resulted in an infusion related reaction, during a prior administration, use the 
following premedication for all subsequent PRM-151 administration: 
 Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV or clemastine 2 mg IV or an equivalent dose of an 
a
ntihistaminic drug 
 Dexamethasone 10 mg IV or an equivalent dose of long-acting corticosteroid 
No othe
r dose modifications are required per protocol.  The investigator should use 
his/her medical judgment in the case of adverse events that may require a dose 
interruption. If the subject is not able to adhere to the original dosing schedule, the 
subject should be dosed as soon as possible within [ADDRESS_576234] dosing is >[ADDRESS_576235]'s treatment by [CONTACT_452016]'s study treatment is necessary for clinical management. In such cases, the 
Investigator should use his/her best judgment as to whether to unblind without first 
att
empting to contact [CONTACT_452017]
. If the Investigator determines that it is not necessary to unblind immediately, 
he/she
 will first attempt to contact [CONTACT_452018]. If the Investigator has tried but is unable to reach the Medical Monitor, 
he/she
 should use his/her best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical 
situa
tion, and may proceed with unblinding without having successfully reached and 
discussed the situation with the Medical Monitor.

area.  The disposition of all investigational product delivered to a Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_451957] a subject- by-subject basis by [CONTACT_452019].  The date and time of administration of the investigational product 
must be
 documented on the appropriate eCRF. 
The unblinded pharmacist must ensure that all documentation regarding investigational 
produc
t receipt, storage, dispensing, loss/damaged and return of used/unused product is 
complete, accurate, and ready for review at each monitoring visit and/or audit.  The sites 
must ensure that the investigational product is available for the monitor to inventory and 
prepare for return shipment to the Sponsor or designee, if required. 
All packing slips and other shipment documentation must be retained as well as any 
investigational product return forms.  See the Pharmacy Manual for additional details. 
6.8. Rationale for the Dose(s) Selected 
In a multiple ascending dose study (PRM151F-12GL), PRM-151 administered IV on 
Days 1, 3, 5, 8, and 15 to subjects with IPF was well tolerated at doses up to 10 mg/kg.  
Plasma
 levels of PRM-151 (C max and AUC) were dose proportional across the range of 
doses from 1 to 10 mg/kg.  PRM-151 had a half-life of 21 to 44 hours.  The study did not 
demons
trate a dose response, but was not intended to do so.  Based on these findings, a 
PR
M-151 dose of 10 mg/kg was selected for investigation in the current study.  
Pre
clinical dose ranging studie s and in vitro potency assays indicate that the effective 
dose range in humans may be .2-10 mg/kg.  Ten mg/kg was selected for this study 
bec
ause it was safe and resulted in a reduction in bone marrow fibrosis in 11 out of 24 
subjects with myelofibrosis treated with PRM-151 10 mg/kg either weekly or every [ADDRESS_576237] evaluations required for this protocol are described in this 
section.  These evaluations will be performed during the indicated days and weeks of the 
study
 as described in Section 7 and in the Schedule of Events (Appendix A).  
All data c
ollected are to be recorded on source documents and entered into the 
approp
riate eCRF page. 
The Investigator at the clinical trial site is responsible for maintaining a record of all 
subjects pre-screened, screened, and enrolled into the study. 
All subjects must provide written informed consent before the performance of any study 
proce
dures. 
7.1. Informed Consent 
Prior to conducting any study-related procedures, written informed consent must be 
obtained from the subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative. 
The nature, scope, and possible consequences, including risks and benefits, of the study 
will be explained to the subject by [CONTACT_452020] 9.1.  Documentation and filing of informed consent 
documents shoul
d be completed according to Section 10.5. 
7.2. Study
 Entrance Criteria 
At Screening, each subject assessed for eligibility against the study entrance criteria.  
Subjec
ts who do not meet the study entrance criteria will not be allowed to participate in 
the study.  The reason(s) for the subject’s ineligibility for the study will be documented. 
7.3. Demographics 
Subject demographic information including gender, age, date of birth, race, ethnicity and 
number of 
years since diagnosis of IPF will be collected prior to the subject receiving the 
first dos
e of PRM-151.   
7.4. P
ast Medical History 
Medical history will be recorded in the eCRF.  Any relevant and/or significant previous 
or e
xisting medical condition(s) that occurred within 5 years prior to time of informed 
consent) should be reported as medical history. Prior and current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_451958].

7.6.2. ECG and Cytokines 
 
ECG and cytokines will be collected at baseline prior to PRM-151 dosing.  Following the 
base
line assessment, ECG and cytokines will only be collected in the event of an infusio n 
related reaction (IRR) as soon as possible after stabilization of the subject. 
 
7.6.3. Pregnancy Testing 
Serum pregnancy testing is required for female subjects of child-bearing potential.  A 
female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who has not undergone a 
hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation or is not naturally 
postmenopausal (i.e., has had menses at any time within the previous 24 months). 
Pregnancy testing is to be performed during Screening.  Pregnancy testing should be 
repe
ated during treatment any time pregnancy is suspected.   
During Screening, results must be reviewed and confirmed to be negative for the subject 
to be eligible for enrollment in the study.  If positive pregnancy test results are obtained 
after the start of study drug treatment, study drug is to be unblinded and discontinued.  
Pregnancies are to be reported and followed as described above. 
7.7. P
hysical Examination 
A complete physical examination is to be performed during Screening and an abbreviated 
physical exam thereafter.  The complete physical examination is to include measurement

F
ull physical examinations are to be performed at screening ; Abbre viated physical exams 
are to be performed thereafter. 
The findings of each examination are to be documented in the eCRF. 
If an abnormality noted on physical examination is considered by [CONTACT_313417], then the abnormality is to be recorded as part of the subject’s 
medical history if occurring prior to start of dosing and as an AE occurring if after the 
start of study drug administration at Week 0, where the finding represents a change from 
Baseline.  Any worsening of a baseline medical condition during the study should be 
recorded as an adverse event. 
7.8. Vital Signs 
Vital signs, including measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, heart 
rate, and O 2 saturation, are to be measured in the sitting position as per the schedule of 
eve
nts (Appendix A). At dosing visits, vital signs will be measured pre-dose as well as [ADDRESS_576238]’s medical history if occurring 
prior to start of dosing and as an AE occurring if after the start of study drug 
administration at Week 0, where the finding represents a change from Baseline. 
7.9. Concurrent Medications

On all dosing days, dosing will occur after all safety and efficacy assessments scheduled 
for that visit are complete.   
7.10.1. Pulmonary Function Tests 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_451962] (Miller, Crapo et al. 2005a), as 
per the
 schedule of events (Appendix A). 
DL CO is to be measured using the single-breath technique according to ATS/ERS 
guidelines 
(MacIntyre, Crapo et al. 2005) at Screening, Baseline and at Week 28, and 
wee
ks [ADDRESS_576240]. 
Lun

2005) will be performed at Screening, Baseline and Week 28, and weeks [ADDRESS_576241] 
Exercise tolerance will be evaluate during the 6MW T ac cording to ATS guidelines (ATS 
2002) (Appendix B) as per the schedule of events (Appendix A). If possible, 6MWT 
PRM -[ADDRESS_576242] 
6MWT measured every twelve weeks.   
7.10.3. High-resolution Computed Tomography 
High-resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) will be performed at the Baseline and 
Weeks 28, and weeks [ADDRESS_576243] is at 
Total Lung Capacity (TLC). 
HRCT is to be performed with the subject in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_451963].  
Conti
guous CT volumetric acquisition will be obtained according to a specified protocol.  
HRCT scans will be compared using a standardized reading protocol and software to 
assess treatment-related changes in lung fibrosis. 
7.10.4. Patient Reported Outcomes 
Kings Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire (K-BILD) (Patel, Siegert et 
al.)(Appendix D ) is a disease specific questionnaire validated to look at the health status 
of 
subjects with a variety of forms of interstitial lung disease (ILD). It consists of 15 
ite
ms.  The K-BILD questionnaire will be performed as per the schedule of events 
(Appe
ndix A). If possible, the questionnaire should be the first assessment completed by 
[CONTACT_452022].   
Leicester Cough Questionnaire (Birring, Prudon et al. 2003) (Appendix E ) a self-
c
ompleted health related quality of life measure of chronic cough. The LCQ total score 
ranges from 3 to 21 and from 1 to 7 for physical, psychological and social domains; a 
higher score indicates a better health-related quality of life. The LCQ questionnaire will 
be pe
rformed as per the schedule of events (Appendix A). If possible, the questionnaire 
should be
 the first assessment completed by [CONTACT_748].   
7.10.5. Pentraxin-2 Levels 
Blood samples for determination of pentraxin-2 levels are to be collected pre-dose as per 
the schedule of events (Appendix A).  
7.10.6. Anti-Pentraxin 2 antibodies / Anti -Drug Antibodies (ADA) 
Blood samples for determination of ADA levels are to be collected pre-dose as per the 
schedule of events (Appendix A). 
7.11. Biomarker Assessments 
7.11.1. Baseline Genetic Status 
The subject’s baseline genetic status for TLR3, L412F polymorphism, and MUC5B 
promoter pol
ymorphism will be collected at Baseline, if available.  If the subject has not 
previously been tested for these genetic characteristics, a blood sample for this analysis 
should be drawn at baseline. 
PRM -[ADDRESS_576244] a causal relationship with this treatment.  An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study 
drug, whether or not related to study drug.  
All AEs from signing of informed consent until last study visit will be entered in the 
database.  For those subjects prematurely withdrawn, TEAEs  will be monitored until, at 
least, [ADDRESS_576245] study treatment dose or resolution of AE, whichever is earlier 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Re
spi[INVESTIGATOR_451964], such “respi[INVESTIGATOR_375521]” events are defined as follows: 
 Unscheduled visits to a healthcare professional for respi[INVESTIGATOR_451910]. 

 Urgent care visits for respi[INVESTIGATOR_451910]. 

 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54692] a worsening or exacerbation of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]. 
 
All “r
espi[INVESTIGATOR_375521]” events will be further characterized according to the definitions 
of IPF-related acute exacerbation, as proposed by [CONTACT_452023] 
(NHLBI) (Collard, Moore et al. 2007) and applied by (Collard, Yow et al. 2013) 
 Acute onset of symptoms (< 30 days in duration) 

 New radiographic abnormalities (bilateral ground glass or consolidation on HRCT 
with no pneumothora

[IP_ADDRESS]. Infusion related reactions 
In the event of acute hypersensitivity or other infusion reaction, institutional protocol 
should be initiated, ECG should be performed, and a blood sample drawn for cytokines. 
Signs and symptoms of an infusion reaction may include the following: headache, fever, 
facial flushing, pruritis, myalgia, nausea, chest tightness, dyspnea, vomiting, erythema, 
abdominal discomfort, diaphoresis, shivers, hypertension, hypotension, lightheadedness, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], urticaria and somnolence.  Although unlikely, serious allergic reactions (e.g., 
anaphylaxis) may occur at any time during the infusion. 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151-202  Version 4.0 
 
48 
 In the case of Grade 2 occurrence of signs and symptoms consistent with infusion related 
reaction, follow institutional protocol and reduce the rate of infusion of PRM-151 to half 
the initial rate; consider discontinue infusion of PRM-[ADDRESS_576246]. 
If PRM-151 resulted in signs and symptoms consistent with Grade 2 or 3 Infusion related 
reaction, infuse PRM-151 over 120 minutes and use the following premedication for all 
subseque
nt PRM-151 administration: 
 Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV or clemastine 2 mg IV (or an equivalent dose of an 
a
ntihist
aminic drug) 
 Dexamethasone 10 mg IV (or an equivalent dose of a long acting corticosteroid) 
 
In
fusion related reactions must be reported to Promedior as described in section [IP_ADDRESS], 
Re
porting of Adverse Events of Special Interest. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Drug Reaction 
A suspected adverse drug reaction (ADR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibil
ity that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Health Authority safety 
reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Unexpected Adverse Event 
An unexpected AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not 
listed in t
he Investigator Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has 
been observed; or, if an Investigator Brochure is not required or available, is not 
consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or 
elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event 
An AE or suspected ADR is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator 
or S
ponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death. 
 A life-threatening AE.  Life-threatening means that the subject was at immediate 
risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction 
PRM -[ADDRESS_576247] caused death had it occurred in a more severe 
form. 
 In-subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_451965]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during 
the study
 period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered AEs if the 
illness or
 disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided 
that it did not
 deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the study (e.g., surgery 
perf
ormed earlier than planned). 
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
a
bility to conduct normal life functions.   
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
An importa
nt medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs.  Examples of such medical 
e
vents include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in -subject 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.   
7.12.2. Adverse Event Assessment 
All AEs from signing of informed consent until last study visit will be entered in the 
database, but only AEs occurred from the time of first study treatment dose administered 
to the
 subject (TEAEs) until last study visit will be analysed (see 7.12.1).  This includes 
AEs the subject reports spontaneously, those observed by [CONTACT_737], and those 
eli
cited by [CONTACT_139667]-ended questions during scheduled study 
ce
nter visits. 
Each AE  is to be assessed by [CONTACT_452025]. 
Serious/Non-Serious 
Adverse events that meet the criteria specified above are to be considered serious. 
Relation
ship to Study Drug 
Relationship of an AE or SAE to investigational product is to be determined by [CONTACT_452026] 7-1.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Protocol Deviations Due to an Emergency or Adverse Event 
In the event of an emergency, the investigator or other physician should use their medical 
judgment and do what is best for the subject, regardless of protocol requirements. The Investigator or other physician in attendance in such an emergency must contact [CONTACT_256221]. 
The Medical Monitor, in conjunction with the Investigator, will decide whether the 
subject should continue to participate in the study.  All protocol deviations and reasons 
for such deviations must be documented.  
7.12.5. Reporting Pregnancies 
Pregnancy itself is not considered an AE. If a subject becomes pregnant or the partner of 
a subject participating in the study becomes pregnant during the study or within [ADDRESS_576249]/partner should be followed by [CONTACT_452028]. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy.

absolute change from baseline to 28 weeks in mean FVC% predicted, hereafter referred 
to as the primary endpoint. Nevertheless, the sample-size has been calculated to ensure a 
sufficient power to demonstrate the efficacy of PRM-[ADDRESS_576251] sizes in the two groups and on the variability 
of the prima
ry endpoint.  
 
The primary endpoint will be tested in a model with two types of subjects: subjects on a 
stable dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16365], and subjects not on other treatment for IPF. 
The sample size calculation is based on the following assumptions: 
 Primary endpoint is normally distributed 

 Homogeneity of variance, i.e. the standard deviation is the same in both arms, 
a
nd for both types of subjects. 
 Randomization ratio PRM-151: placebo equals 2:1. 
 Expected value of the primary endpoint for subjects on pi[INVESTIGATOR_451966] -1.5. 
 Expected value of the primary endpoint for subjects on no other treatment will 
be
 -3. 
 Expected value of the primary endpoint for subjects on PRM-151 will be ≥ 
0.75. 
 Standard deviation of the primary endpoint is 5 

 75% of subjects will be on a stable dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16365] 

 25% of subjects will not be on other treatment for IPF 

 Significance level (α)=0.10 two-sided. 

 Desired power to demonstrate superiority is 80% 
A sa
mple size of one hundred and two (102) evaluable subjects in total ([ADDRESS_576252]
bo) is enough to demonstrate superiority at p<0.10 with a power of 80% under 
the above
 assumptions. Assuming a non-evaluability rate of about 15%, 117 subjects in 
tota
l (78 PRM-151 and 39 placebo) are to be enrolled. Stratified randomization will 
ensure a balance of PRM-151: placebo in subjects on pi[INVESTIGATOR_451967]
y other therapy, with at least 25% of subjects on no other therapy. 
8.2. General considerations for statistical analysis 
8.2.1. Statistical Analysis Plan 
The statistical section of the protocol presents the main features of the planned statistical 
analysis. A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared by [CONTACT_452029], validated by [CONTACT_452030]. 
Any change to the planned statistical methods will be documented in the clinical study 
report. 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151-202  Version 4.0 
 
54 
 8.2.2. Descriptive statistics 
Quantitative variables will be described by [CONTACT_452031]: 
number of available data, number of missing values, mean, standard deviation, median, 
Q1, Q3, minimum and maximum values. When relevant, confidence intervals will also be 
computed. 
Qualitative variables will be described by [CONTACT_452032], number of missing values, frequency counts for each category and corresponding 
percentage. Percentages will be calculated using the number of available data as the 
denominator (i.e. not including missing values). When relevant, confidence intervals will 
also be computed. 
8.2.3. Inferential statistics 
For the primary efficacy analysis, the overall type-one error rate will be set to 0.[ADDRESS_576253] to be interpreted bearing in mind the issue of multiplicity and the 
increased risk of erroneously obtaining statistically significant results. Missing, Unused, 
and Spurious Data 
Except for the use of LOCF for the analysis of the primary criterion as described below in 
Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS] , all other analyses will be based on observed data only; no 
da
ta will be imputed. 
8.2.4. Interim Analyses 
There is no interim analysis planned. 
8.2.5. Software used for statistical analyses 
The SAS software, version 9.2 or higher, will be used for the statistical analysis. 
8.3. Protocol deviations 
Major protocol deviations are defined as deviations liable to prevent or change the 
interpretation of the results of the primary efficacy analysis of the study. The following 
deviations will be considered as major (this list is not exhaustive and will be reviewed at 
the time of the blind review meeting): 
 noncompliance with the inclusion or non-inclusion criteria 

 noncompliance with study treatment 
 no post-baseline data for the primary efficacy endpoint 
 intake of forbidden medication 
PRM -[ADDRESS_576254] data sets: 
The F
ull Analysis Set (FAS) will consist in all randomized subjects having received at 
least one administration of the study medication with at least one post-baseline 
assessment of
 FVC% predicted (primary efficacy criterion) available 
The full ana
lysis set will be the primary population for the efficacy analyses in this trial. 
The Per Protocol (PP) set: a subset of the FAS composed of all subjects treated with the 
IMP, having received at least the planned IMP infusions on days 1, 3, 5, and weeks 4, 8 
and 12 and who did not present any major protocol deviations.  
The pe
r-protocol set will be used for secondary analyses of the primary efficacy criterion 
and for the analysis of some selected secondary efficacy criteria. 
The Safety (SAF) dataset: composed of all randomized subjects having received at least 
one dose of study drug. This data set will be used to perform the analysis of safety. 
8.5. P
lanned Statistical analyses 
8.5.1. Efficacy Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary analysis of efficacy 
The primary efficacy criterion is change from baseline to Week 28 in FVC% predicted 
The c
omparison of PRM-[ADDRESS_576255] 
with a ty
pe-one error rate of 0.10.  
The two tre
atment arms will be compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA), with 
cha
nge from baseline to Week 28 in FVC% predicted as dependent variable (outcome), 
and tre
atment and stratum, as explanatory variables.  
In 
case of missing measurement of FVC% predicted at week 28, the last available post 
base
line measurement will be carried forward. 
The following statistical hypotheses will be tested: 
•H0:Absence of difference between the treatment groups. 
•H1:A difference exists between the treatment groups. 
Le
ast square means for changes from baseline to Week 28 in FVC% predicted, together 
with their 2-sided 95% confidence interval will be presented for both treatment groups. 
The mean diff
erence between the two groups will also be presented with its 2-sided 90% 
confidence interval. 
Due to the number of sites planned to recruit and randomize subjects in the study, it is 
expected that each site will include too few subject s to allow the inclusion of study site as 
a c
ovariate in the stratification and the analysis,  
PRM -151

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Sensitivity analyses on the primary endpoint: 
Sensitivity analyses on the FAS: 
The mean changes from baseline to Week 28 in FVC% predicted will be compared 
between treatment groups on the FAS using an ANOVA model with treatment group and 
stratum as main effects and with a treatment by [CONTACT_452033]. This analysis will use the same method of data imputation for missing data 
(Last Observation Carried Forward, LOCF) as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
In 
case of a significant qualitative treatment by [CONTACT_452034], the data will be 
care
fully examined searching for a potential explanation and the conclusions of the 
primary efficacy analysis will have to be interpreted cautiously. 
Potential differences in treatment effect according to study site will be addressed by 
[CONTACT_452035], but it is expected that due 
to the small number of subjects within each site no precise estimates of within site 
treatment effect will be obtained for most of the sites. 
Sensitivity analyses on the PP set: 
The ANOVA model described above (see Section [IP_ADDRESS])  for the primary efficacy 
a
nalysis will be used for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint on the PP analysis 
set. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary efficacy analyses: 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Analyses of quantitative secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints: 
A similar
 analysis as described for the primary endpoint in Section [IP_ADDRESS] will be done 
for the se
condary and exploratory efficacy variables, replacing FVC % predicted with the 
other variables as appropriate.  These analyses will be conducted on the FAS and Per 
Protocol set. 
 
FVC% predicted will also be analysed separately for each level of the stratum variable (in 
subjects on a stable dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_451968]) using analysis of variance (ANOVA), with change from Baseline to 
week 28 in FVC% predicted as dependent variable (outcome), and treatment as the 
ex
planatory variable. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Analyses of quantitative primary, secondary and exploratory efficacy 
endpoints evolution over time: 
The evolution of each efficacy variable with time will be compared between the two 
groups using a likelihood-based Mixed effects Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) 
including treatment, stratum and time as fixed factors, the time by [CONTACT_9866], 
the base
line (Day 1) measurement as covariate and the subject effect as a random effect 
to adjust for
 correlated errors over time. This analysis will be conducted on the FAS for 
all
 secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints and on both the FAS and PP set for 
FVC % predicted. 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151-202  Version 4.0 
 
57 
 [IP_ADDRESS].3. Analyses of categorical secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints: 
Percentages of subjects in each category will be computed per treatment group.  
The two tre
atment groups will be compared using a stratified statistical test (Cochran-
Mantel-
Haenszel general association test in SAS Freq procedure), adjusting for the 
Stratum
 effect.  I f the assumptions underlying the use of the asymptotic test are not met, 
the e
xact version of the test will be used. 
8.5.2. S
afety Analyses 
AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_452036] (MedDRA) and summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, 
and treatment group for the number and percent of AEs reported, the number of subjects 
reportin
g each AE, and the number of subjects with any AE.  A by-subject AE data 
listing including onset and resolution dates, verbatim term, preferred term, treatment, 
severity, relationship to treatment, action taken, and outcome will be provided.   
Safety data, including laboratory evaluations and vital signs assessments, will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_451999].  In addition, change from 
Baseline to any post-dose values will be summarized for vital signs and clinical 
laboratory results.   
The frequency of subjects with abnormal safety laboratory results will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_3148]. 
8.5.3. Other Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Subject Disposition 
A listing
 and table of proportions of subjects discontinuing the study for each reason will 
be provided by [CONTACT_3148] / dose group.  Details will be included in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Summary statistics will be provided for the demographic and baseline characteristics; 
details will be in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Subject  Adherence 
Compliance with study drug will be computed for each subject as proportion of 
presc
ribed study drug actually taken.  Details will be included in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan.

Written informed consent in compliance with 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 50 
and/or ICH will be obtained from each subject prior to undergoing any protocol-specific 
tests or proc
edures that are not part of routine care. 
Promedior will provide an informed consent form (ICF) template to the Investigator for 
use in developi
[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study center-specific ICF.  Prior to submission of the study center-
specific ICF to the IRB/EC, the study center-specific ICF must be reviewed and approved 
by [CONTACT_452013].  Any changes requested by [CONTACT_1201]/EC must also be approved by 
[CONTACT_452037].  The final IRB/EC- approved ICF must be provided to Promedior.  Revisions 
to the ICF required during the study must be approved by [CONTACT_452013], and a copy of the 
revised ICF provided to Promedior. 
Be
fore recruitment and enrollment, each prospective subject (or legal guardian) will be 
given 
a full explanation of the study and be allowed to read the ICF.  After the 
Investigator or Sub-investigator is assured that the subject/legal guardian understands the 
commitments of participating in the study, the subject/legal guardian will be asked to sign 
and date the ICF.   
A copy of the fully signed and dated ICF will be given to the subject.  The original will 
be maintained in the subject’s medical record at the study center.  All active subjects will 
sign a
n updated ICF if revisions are made to the ICF during the course of the study. 
9.3. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee 
The IRB/EC will review all appropriate study documentation in order to safeguard the 
rights, safety, and well-being of the subjects. The study will only be conducted at study 
centers where IRB/EC approval has been obtained. The protocol, Investigator’s 
Brochure, informed consent, advertisements (if applicable), written information given to 
the subjects (including diary cards), safety updates, annual progress reports, and any 
revisi
ons to these documents will be provided to the IRB/EC by [CONTACT_737]. 
The final study protocol, including the final version of the Informed Consent Form, must 
be approved or given a favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_3952]/EC as appropriate. The 
Investigator must submit written approval to Promedior or designee before he or she can 
enroll any subject into the study. 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151-202  Version 4.0 
 
59 
 The Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/EC of any amendment to the 
protocol in accordance with local requirements. In addition, the IRB/EC must approve all 
advertising used to recruit subjects for the study. The protocol must be re-approved by 
[CONTACT_941] I
RB / EC upon receipt of amendments and annually, as local regulations require. 
The Investigator is also responsible for providing the IRB/EC with reports of any 
reportable serious ADRs from any other study conducted with the investigational 
product. Promedior will provide this information to the Investigator. 
Progress reports and notifications of reportable serious ADRs will be provided to the 
IRB/EC according to local regulations and guidelines. 
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, Promedior or 
designee may conduct a quality assurance audit.  
9.4. Amending the Protocol 
Any changes in this research activity, except those to remove an apparent immediate 
hazard to the subject, must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_452038]/E C that 
a
pproved the study.  Amendments to the protocol must be submitted in writing to the 
Investigator’s IRB/EC for approval prior to subjects being enrolled into the amended 
protocol.
 
Promedior may make administrative changes (i.e., changes that do not significantly affect 
subje
ct safety or the study’s scope or scientific quality) without any further approvals.   
9.5. C
onfidentiality 
All study findings and documents will be regarded as confidential.  The Investigator and 
other study personnel must not disclose such information without prior written approval 
from Promedior. 
Subjec
t confidentiality will be strictly maintained to the extent possible under the law.  
Subject names must not be disclosed.  Subjects will be identified in the eCRFs and other 
documents subm
itted to Promedior or its designated representative, by [CONTACT_73976], birth 
date, a
nd/or assigned subject number.  Documents that identify the subject (e.g., the 
signe
d ICF) should not to be submitted to Promedior or its designated representative, and 
must be
 maintained in confidence by [CONTACT_737].  
9.6. Publication Policy 
It is anticipated that the results of this study will be presented at scientific meetings 
and/or published in a peer reviewed scientific or medical journal.  A Publications 
Committee comprised of Investigators participating in the study and representatives from 
Prome
dior, as appropriate, will be formed to oversee the publication of the study results, 
which will reflect the experience of all participating study centers.  Subsequently, 
individual Investigators may publish results from the study in compliance with their 
agreement with the Sponsor. 
PRM -[ADDRESS_576256].  It is the Investigator’s responsibility to 
ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject’s 
eCRF.  Source documentation supporting the eCRF data should indicate the subject’s 
participation in the study and should document the dates and details of study procedures, 
AEs, and subject status.   
The I
nvestigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF as soon as 
possible after information is collected.  An explanation should be given for all missing 
data.
 
The Investigator must electronically sign and date the Investigator’s Statement at the end 
of the eCRF to endorse the recorded data.   
10.2. Monitoring 
During the course of the study, the CRA will make study center visits to review protocol 
compliance, compare eCRFs and individual subject’s medical records, assess drug 
accountability, and ensure that the study is being conducted according to pertinent 
regulatory requirements in respect to Good Clinical Practice.  eCRFs will be verified with 
source documentation.  The review of medical records will be performed in a manner to 
ensure that subject confidentiality is maintained. 
10.3. Inspections 
Regulatory authorities and/or quality assurance personnel from Promedior or its 
desig
nated representative may wish to carry out such source data checks and/or in-center 
audit
 inspections.  The investigator assures Promedior of the necessary support at all 
times.  
In the event of an audit, the Investigator agrees to allow the Sponsor’s 
representatives and any regulatory agencies access to all study records.  
10.4. Financial Disclosure Reporting Obligations 
Investigators and Sub-investigators are required to provide financial disclosure 
information to the Sponsor to permit the Sponsor to fulfill its regulatory obligation.  
Inv
estigators and Sub-investigators must commit to promptly updating the information if 
any relevant changes occur during the study and for a period of one year after the 
completion of the study. 
10.5. Archiving Study Records 
Essential documents should be retained for a minimum of two years after the last 
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least two years have elapsed 
since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product.

TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE 6MWT 
(A
TS 2002) 
Location 
The 6MWT should be performed indoors, along a long, flat, straight, enclosed corridor with a 
hard sur
face that is seldom traveled. If the weather is comfortable, the test may be performed 
outdoors. The walking course must be [ADDRESS_576266] is, therefore, required. 
The length of the corridor should be marked every 3 m. The turnaround points should be marked 
with a cone
 (such as an orange traffic cone). A starting line, which marks the beginning and end 
of ea
ch 60-m lap, should be marked on the floor using brightly colored tape. 
 
REQUIRED EQUIPMENT 
1.  Countdown timer (or stopwatch) 
2.  Mechanical lap counter 
3.  Two sm
all cones to mark the turnaround points 
4.  A chair that can be easily moved along the walking course 
5.  Workshe
ets on a clipboard 
6.  A source of oxygen 
7.  Sphygmomanometer 
8.  Telephone 
9.  Automated electronic defibrillator 
 
PATIENT PREPARATION 
1.  Comfortable clothing should be worn. 
2.  Appropriate shoes for walking should be worn. 
3.  Pa
tients should use their usual walking aids during the test (cane, walker, etc.). 
4.  The pa
tient’s usual medical regimen should be continued. 
5.  A light meal is acceptable before early morning or early afternoon tests. 
6.  Patients should not have exercised vigorously within [ADDRESS_576267]. 
 
MEASUREMENTS 
1. Repeat testing should be performed about the same time of day to minimize intraday 
varia
bility. 
2. A “ warm-up” period before the test should not be performed. 
PRM -[ADDRESS_576268] baseline heart rate and 
ox
ygen saturation (SpO2) and follow manufacturer’s instructions to maximize the signal and 
to minimize motion artifact (56, 57). Make sure the readings are stable before recording. 
Note pulse r
egularity and whether the oximeter signal quality is acceptable.   The rationale for 
measuring oxygen saturation is that although the distance is the primary outcome measure, 
improvement during serial evaluations may be manifest either by [CONTACT_452046]
d symptoms with the same distance walked (39). The SpO2 should not be used for 
constant monitoring during the exercise.  The technician must not walk with the patient to 
observe the SpO2. If worn during the walk, the pulse oximeter must be lightweight (less than 
2 pounds), batt
ery powered, and held in place (perhaps by a “fanny pack”) so that the patient 
does not
 have to hold or stabilize it and so that stride is not affected. Many pulseoximeters 
have
 considerable motion artifact that prevents accurate readings during the walk.  
5. Have the patient stand and rate their baseline dyspnea and overall fatigue using the Borg 
sc
ale (see APPENDIX E for the Borg scale and instructions). 
6. Set the lap counter to zero and the timer to 6 minutes. Assemble all necessary equipment (lap 
counter, timer, clipboard, Borg Scale, worksheet) and move to the starting point. 
7. Instruct the patient as follows: 
“
The object of this test is to walk as far as possible for [ADDRESS_576269] without hesitation. Now I’m going to show 
you. Please watch the way I turn without hesitation.” 
Demonstrate by [CONTACT_114037]. Walk and pi[INVESTIGATOR_113988] a cone briskly. 
“Ar
e you ready to do that? I am going to use this counter to keep track of the number of 
laps y
ou complete. I will click it each time you turn around at this starting line. 
Re
member that the object is to walk AS FAR AS POSSIBLE for 6 minutes, but don’t run 
or jog. 
Star
t now or whenever you are ready.” 
8. Position the patient at the starting line.  You should also stand near the starting line during 
the te
st. Do not walk with the patient. As soon as the patient starts to walk, start the timer. 
9. Do not talk to any one during the walk. Use an even tone of voice when using the standard 
phrase
s of encouragement.  Watch the patient. Do not get distracted and lose count of the 
laps. Each time the participant returns to the starting line, click the lap counter once (or mark 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151-202  Version 4.0

 the lap on the worksheet). Let the participant see you do it. Exaggerate the click using body 
langu
age, like using a stop- watch at a race. After the first minute, tell the patient the 
following (in e
ven tones): “You are doing well.  You have 5 minutes to go.” When the timer 
shows 4 minut
es remaining, tell the patient the following: “Keep up the good work. You 
have
 4 minutes to go.” When the timer shows 3 minutes remaining, tell the patient the 
following:  “Y
ou are doing well. You are halfway done.” When the timer shows 2 minutes 
remaining, t
ell the patient the following: “Keep up the good work. You have only2 minutes 
left.” When the timer shows only 1 minute remaining, tell the patient:  “You are doing well.  
You ha
ve only 1 minute to go.”Do not use other words of encouragement (or body language 
to speed up).
 
If the 
patient stops walking during the test and needs a rest, say this:  “You can lean against 
the wa
ll if you would like; then continue walking whenever you feel able.”  Do not stop the 
timer
.  If the patient stops  before the 6 minutes are up  and  refuses to continue (or  you  
dec
ide   that  they should  not continue), wheel the chair over for the patient to sit on, 
discontinue the walk, and note on the  worksheet the distance, the time stopped, and the 
rea
son for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_278127]- maturely. 
When the timer is 15 seconds from completion, say this: “In a moment I’m going to tell you 
to stop.  W
hen I do, just stop right where you are and I will come to you.” 
When the timer rings (or buzzes), say this: “Stop!” Walk over to the patient. Consider taking 
the cha
ir if they look exhausted. Mark the spot where they stopped by [CONTACT_1299] a bean bag or a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_451974]. 
10. Post-test: Record the post walk Borg dyspnea and fatigue levels and ask this: “What, if 
anything, kept you from walking farther?” 
11. If using a pulse oximeter, measure SpO2 and pulse rate from the oximeter and then remove 
the sensor.
 
12. Record the number of laps from the counter (or tick marks on the worksheet). 
13. Record the additional distance covered (the number of meters in the final partial lap) using 
the markers on the wall as distance guides. Calculate the total distance walked, rounding to 
the nearest meter, and record it on the worksheet. 
14. Congratulate the patient on good effort and offer a drink of water.

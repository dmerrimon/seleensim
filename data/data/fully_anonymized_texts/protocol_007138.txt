    5. INTRODUCTION 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. is developi[INVESTIGATOR_118163] -502 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_214217], vitiligo, androgenetic alopecia and atopic dermatitis.  ATI -502 is a potent 
highly selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and Janus kinase 3 (JAK3).  
5.1. Overview of Atopic Dermatitis  
Atopic dermatitis or eczema is an inflammatory skin disorder ch aracterized by [CONTACT_162002], cracked, 
pruritic skin lesions that most often develops in childhood.  Sixty percent of the reported cases 
develop within the first year of life and 85% of the cases develop by [CONTACT_14898] 5 ( Weston, 2017).    
The disorder often follows a pattern of spontaneous remission with intermittent flares of the 
disease and often continues into adulthood.  The symptoms can range from mild to severe a nd 
can interfere with daily activities. While the disease is not a life -threatening illness, atopic 
dermatitis can significantly impact a patient’s quality of life.  In patients with moderate to severe 
disease the symptoms rarely clear without treatment.  There are a number of topi[INVESTIGATOR_214218], calcineurin inhibitors, antihist amines, and antimicrobial agents 
that are used to treat atopic dermatitis however it has been over 15 years since a new topi[INVESTIGATOR_214219] a new me chanism of action has been approved.   
5.2. Rationale for the use of ATI -502 in Atopic Dermatitis  
The pathogenesis and etiology of atopic dermatitis (AD) is not completely understood as AD is a 
multifactorial disease developi[INVESTIGATOR_214220], environmental and 
immun ological factors ( Bissonnette, 2016) .  Basic and translational research studies have 
identified several pathogenic pathways that promote atopic dermatitis.  These studies have 
established that the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis is complex.  It involves a genetic 
predisposition to an impaired epi[INVESTIGATOR_214221], a key Th2 -domiated immune response 
(interferon -γ; IFN -γ), immune changes beyond Th2 associated with IL -22, IL4/IL21, and TSLP 
(thymic stromal lymphopoietin), as well as Th2 allergens (e.g. pollen, house dust mites), 
microbial allergens and self -antigens (Eyerich,  2013) . One commonality among the immune 
pathways is pi[INVESTIGATOR_214222] (JAKs):  IFN -γ (JAK1/2); TSLP (JAK1/2); 
IL-22 (JAK1/TYK2); and IL -4/IL-21 (JAK1/3).  Inhibition of the immune components of atopic 
dermatitis via JAK inhibition has become a leading candidate for a clinic al treatment strategy  
(Alves, 2016) .  Initial clinical studies have confirmed the potential for both oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_214223].   
ATI-502 is a JAK 1/[ADDRESS_257291] JAK1 and 
JAK3, respectively.  At a cellular/physiologic level, ATI -[ADDRESS_257292] ATI -502 to inhibit JAK1/[ADDRESS_257293] be present in the target tissue.  Based upon human skin permeation studies (Franz 
chamber with human skin) using the 0.46% ATI -502 formulation, ATI -502 concentrations in 
were extrapolated to be in range of 10 -20µM in the dermis and epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196].  A 10µM 
concentration, combined with anticipated drug gradients, is anticipated to deliver sufficient drug 
to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_214224]1/3 signaling and 
thereby, diminish immune mediated inflammation  (Levy, 2015)( Bissonnette, 2016) .

    7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is an open label, multicenter,  phase 2 a study designed to evaluate the safety  and tolerability 
of ATI -502 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_28198], 0.46% in male and female subjects with a diagnosis of AD as 
defined by [CONTACT_214239].  Based on the 5 -point Physician’s Global Assessment 
(PGA) scale, subjects must have a score of 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe).  Subjects will be required 
to apply ATI -502 study medication to their identified AD treatment areas twice a day (BID) for a 
total of 4 weeks.   Subjects will be allowed to treat new disease areas with ATI -502 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_118151], 0.46% if they appear after Visit 2.  All subjects will be required to complete a safety 
follow up visit  [ADDRESS_257296] study medication application.     
A total of 30 evaluable subjects who are ≥ 18 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of moderate 
or severe AD will be enrolled to the study.     
Subjects will be required to complete the following treatment visits: 
  Visit 1:  Screening and P hotographs for Study Entry Approval  
  Visit 2:  Study Enrollment and  First  Treatment  with Study Medication  
  Visit 3:  Follow up Visit  
  Visit 4:  Follow up Visit  
  Visit 5:  Follow up Visit  
  Visit 6:  End of Study Visit  
7.2. Number of Subjects  
A total of [ADDRESS_257297] is e nrolled, the maximum duration of study treatment is 
63 days (56 days plus a 7 -day window).   
7.4. Treatment Assignment  
This is an open label study. All subjects will be treated twice daily for 4 weeks with ATI -502 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_28198], 0.46% .   
7.5. Enrollment Procedures  
Prior to a subject being allowed to enroll to the study, investigational sites will be required to 
submit the subject’s baseline photographs to Canfield Scientific’s database.  Once the photos are 
received into the database a panel of three boar d certified dermatologists will review the baseline 
photographs.  The panel will review and approve within 24 hours of receipt of the photographs  
into the Canfield imaging database . In cases where the photographs do not properly characterize 
Protocol:  ATI -502-AD-201 
Version 2.0:  [ADDRESS_257298] 2018  Amendment 1 
 20  
    the disease (d ue to flashback and whitening on the photographs) the subjects will be allowed to 
enroll to the study based upon the Principal Investigator’s clinical assessment of the subject.   .   
7.6. Subject Identifiers  
 
The Investigator will assign a unique five -digit su bject identifier (SI) to each subject at Screening 
(Visit 1).  
The SI format will be NN -NNN, using leading zeroes as appropriate, where:  
• The first 2 digits are the investigational site number assigned by [CONTACT_118226]  
• The final [ADDRESS_257299] number (S N), assigned in ascending numerical order by 
[CONTACT_18370], without omitting or repeating any number, starting with 001.  
For example, the SI for the twenty -third subject that signs an informed consent form at site 
number [ADDRESS_257300] will be identified using the SI in all study 
documentation for the duration of the study.  
7.7. Replacement of Subjects  
Enrolled subjects that do not complete all visits will be replaced to ensure that 30 evaluable 
subjects complete the study.   
7.8. Criteria for Study Termination  
This study may be terminated prematurely in whole or in part due to a change in the benefit/risk 
profile for ATI -[ADDRESS_257301] ( IRB) or the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA).  The Sponsor may also elect to terminate the study if enrollment is 
sufficien tly slow to prevent the completion of the study in an acceptable timeframe, or if ATI -
[ADDRESS_257302] promptly notify all enrolled subjects and the IRB of study 
termination.

    11. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
11.1. Identification of Target Treatment Area  
At Visit 1 and Visit 2, the investigator will identify a target treatment area (s) that meets all 
inclusion criteria (e.g. a diagnosis of AD based on the criteria of  Hanif in and Rajka , BSA 
between 2- 20%,  and a  PGA sco re of 3 or 4 ).  The target treatment area can not include the scalp, 
face, palms of hands , soles of feet , groin or genitalia .  The investigator will record the identified 
target treatment area on  the body map in the subject’s source documents and eCRF.  These target 
treatment areas will be photographed at each specified protocol time point (Refer to Table 2).  
Sites will use colored stickers to mark the treatment areas prior to the photographs being taken.  
(Refer to Section  12.6 for photography instructions)  
If new areas of atopic dermatitis develop while the subject is on study, these areas may be treated 
with the ATI -502 study medication (excluding the face, scalp, soles of feet and palms  of hands) .  
The treating investigator must identify these new treatment areas at a treatment visit (Visit 2, 3 or 
4) to ensure that the area meets the protocol defined treatment criteria.  These new treatment 
areas will be documented in the subject’s sour ce documents and in the eCRF.   
11.2. Application of Investigational Product  
Subjects will be instructed to apply a thin film of ATI -502 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_118152]  0.46%, twice -daily  -
once in the morning and approximately 8- [ADDRESS_257336] wash her/his 
hands thoroughly before and after each study drug application.  If new areas of AD develop 
while the subject is on study, ATI -[ADDRESS_257337]’s home. 
11.3. Study Medication Interruption  
Treatment with ATI -502 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_28198], 0.46%  should be temporarily interrupted in the event 
of severe adverse events considered related to ATI -502 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_28198], 0.46% , or in the event 
of one or more of the abnormal laboratory values in Table 4.

Serum creatinine  >[ADDRESS_257341]  <1.[ADDRESS_257342] or within 10% of Baseline value  
If a subject has one or more of the abnormal laboratory values noted in Table 4, the investigator 
or designee upon receipt and review of the central laboratory report should instruct the subject to 
hold study medication applications. The investigator or designee should ask the subject about 
symptoms, concomitant illness es and medications and repeat the test(s) as soon as possible.  The 
Medical Monitor must be notified of dose interruptions due to SAEs considered related to study 
medication or laboratory abnormalities noted in Table 4.  
If the retest confirms the abnormal laboratory value, then the study medication should continue 
to be held followed by [CONTACT_166544] a week or sooner at the discretion of the investi gator.  
The subject should be followed until the laboratory abnormality(s) returns  to normal or to 
baseline values.  
11.4. Skin Care while on Study  
Prior to the application of the ATI -[ADDRESS_257343]’s  routine cleansing products.  The area should be dried 
completely prior to the application of the study medication.  Subjects must not wash the 
treatment area, go swimming or perform physical exercise that may cause perfuse sweat ing for a 
period of 6 hours after applying the ATI -502 study medication.  While on study, subjects  should 
continue to use their routine cleansing and cosmetic products on study.    
Subjects may  not use a non -therapeutic, bland emollient/moisturizer  or suns creens on the AD 
target treatment area for the duration of the study.  Moisturizers, emollients, and sunscreens may 
be used on NON -AD target treatment areas.  S ubjects must take special precautions to try and 
limit sun exposure to all identified treatment areas by [CONTACT_214242] - AD target treatment areas only.    
11.5. Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_214226] 1 until discharge 
from the study.  
Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_118186] ( e.g., prescription, over -the-counter [OTC]) and non- drug 
(e.g., chiropractic, physical therapy, energy -based treatments) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Subjects will refrain 
from receipt of any therapy in compliance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subject s should 
refrain from changing the use of any concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_226].  
All new or modified concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_214227].  
Any new or modified concomitant therapy must be considered to determine if it is related  to an 
AE. An AE must be reported unless the therapy is modified for non-  medical reasons ( e.g.,

    12. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
12.1. Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA)  
The PGA is the investigator’s assessment of the average overall severity of subject’s AD at a 
particular  point in time.   At every study visit, the investigator will assess the PGA using the scale 
below and report the one integer that best describes the average overall severity of each target 
evaluation area of AD per subject .  One assessment will b e conducted for each  target  treatment 
area.

12.2. Body Surface Area (BSA)  
For this study, 1% Body Surface Area (BSA) is defined as the area of the subject’s hand with 
the fingers and thumb together. The subjects are required to have 2 -20% total BSA  of active AD  
to be enrolled in the study .  Body surface area of each target treat ment area will be assessed at 
each treatment visit.  If new areas of AD develop while the subject is on study, these new areas 
will not be assessed.   
12.3. Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)  
Investigators will use the EASI to assess each subject’s extent and  severity of atopic dermatitis at 
Visit [ADDRESS_257347]’s body down into four body regions:  
• Head and Neck  
− Face occupi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 33% (17% each side), neck 33% (17% front and back) and scalp

sum of the intensity scores for four signs.  The four signs are:  
• Redness (erythema, inflammation)  
• Thickness  (induration, papulation, swelling -acute AD) 
• Scratching (excoriation)  
• Lichenification (lined  skin, furrowing, prurigo nodules -chronic AD) 
The AVERAGE intensity of each sign in each body area is assessed according to the following

    13. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
13.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety will be assessed throughout the study by [CONTACT_1720]  a designated and approp riately 
trained staff member.  
13.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
During the screening visit (Visit 1) , the investigator or designee will interview each subject to 
obtain demographic information including date of birth, sex at birth, Fitzpatrick skin type, race 
and, if appropriate, ethnicity. T he investigator or designee will interview each subject to obta in 
medical history information related to all medical conditions , surgeries  and disease states that, at 
screening : are ongoing , require concomitant therapy  or are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], 
relevant to the subject’s study participation.   In addit ion, the medical history of women who are 
not of childbearing potential should reflect the reason e.g. post -menopausal for [ADDRESS_257358]’s prior treatments or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_214231].   
13.1.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured at each visit during the study . The following items will be 
measured:  
• Body temperature  
• Heart rate  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]  
• Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) after the subject sits quietly for at least 5 minutes  
• Height (at Visit 2 only)  
• Weight (at V isit 2 only)  
Any measure that is, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], abnormal AND clinically significant  (CS) 
must be recorded as history if found prior to the first study medication application, or as an AE if 
found after the first study medication  application  begins.  
13.1.3. Physical Examination  
The investigator or designee will perform a physical examination for all body systems (general 
appearance, examination of head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, res pi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, 
abdominal, neurological, musculoskeletal, lymphatic and skin assessment) at Screening (Visit 1) 
and end of study ( Visit 6 ). 
13.1.4. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Standard 12- lead ECGs will be performed by a qualified staff member at Screening ( Visit 1), 
Day 8  (Visit 3) , Day 15 (Visit 4), Day 29 (Visit 5) and Day 56 (Visit 6/End of Study) .  The 
ECGs must be obtained using a standard 12- lead ECG with a 10mm/mV amplitude, at 25mm/sec 
and a [ADDRESS_257359] 5 minutes prior to performing the ECG.  
Protocol:  ATI -502-AD-201 
Version 2.0:  [ADDRESS_257360] 2018  Amendment 1  
 39  
    A central cardiology laboratory will provide ECG equipment, supplies and site training.  In 
addition, the central cardiology laboratory will process ECGs received by [CONTACT_214246] a secure study portal.  The ECG results will be interpreted by a qualified health 
professional (evaluator) and the interpretation reported either directly on the tracing or in a 
separate report.   The evaluator will interpret the results of every ECG and define the ECG as 
“normal” or “abnormal”.  Variations such as minor ST changes (i.e., <0.5mm depression) and 
early re- polarization are considered normal.  
The investigator must review the evaluator’s interpretation of each subject’s screening ECG prior 
to Visit 2. The investigator will review the evaluator’s interpretation of all ECG reports in a 
timely manner and comment on the clinical relevance of any result that is defined by [CONTACT_118237].  
Any ab normalities that are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], clinically significant, must be 
reported as history if found prior to the start of the first dose of study medication or as an AE if 
found after the start of the first dose of study medication   
13.1.5. Pregnancy Test ing 
Subjects who are WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at Screening (Visit 
1) to continue in the study , and a  nega tive UPT at  Baseline (Visit 2)  prior to study entry.  If the 
result of any post -treatment urine pregnancy test is positive, the subject will be withdrawn from 
the study and the subject’s pregnancy documented and followed.  In addition, t he investigator or 
designee will perform a urine pregnancy test for subjects who are WOCBP at Visit 6 (Post 
Treatment Safety Foll ow Up Visit).   
13.1.6. Laboratory Assessments  
All subjects are required to have a blood chemistry panel performed at Visit 1 (Screening) and at 
each protocol defined visit.  A qualified staff member will collect non -fasting blood samples and 
ship the samples to a  central laboratory for analysis.  The following tests will be performed:  
Chemistry Panel  Complete Blood Count  
Albumin  Hematocrit  
Alkaline phosphatase  Hemoglobin

13.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
13.2.1. Definition of Advers e Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre -
existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or 
not considered casually related to the pr oduct.  In clinical studies, an AE can include an 
undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even 
if no study treatment has been administered.  
The investigator should, when certain, report a diagnosis rather  than the signs, symptoms or 
clinically significant  abnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. Otherwise, signs, 
symptoms or abnormal laboratory values may be used to describe the AE.  
Any C S abnormality discovered prior to the first study medicatio n treatment should be reported 
as medical history, not as an AE.  
All AEs that occur from the time of first study medication application (V isit 2) until [ADDRESS_257362]’s source documents 
and in Aclaris’ EDC  system . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i .e., baseline, treatme nt, 
washout, or follow -up), and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, 
that fulfils one or more of the following:  
• Results in death  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103296]  
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes listed above.  
Protocol:  ATI -502-AD-201 
Version 2.0:  [ADDRESS_257363] 2018  Amendment 1  
 41  
    The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time 
of event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
Important medical e vents are those that may not be immediately life threatening, result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but are clearly of major clinical significance and may jeopardize the subject or 
require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definit ion above. These 
should also usually be considered serious . 
SAEs will be reported from the time of informed consent until [ADDRESS_257364] application of 
study medication, whether or not they are related to the study.  SAEs will be documented on the 
Aclar is SAE report form and in the eCRF.    
[IP_ADDRESS]. Unexpected adverse events  
An AE is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the Investigator ’s Brochure or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed . 
13.3. Recording of Adverse Events  
13.3.1. Adverse event reporting period  
The investigator must start reporting non- serious AEs with the subject’s first study medication 
application and continue reporting until the end of the subject’s last study visit. Reporting for 
SAEs must start when the subject signs the ICF and continue until the end of the subject’s last 
visit.  
13.3.2. Severity  
The investigator is to define the severity of each AE using the following definitions as a 
guideline. The investigator will consider the range of the possible severity of the event and 
identify the severity that is the most appropriate according to her/his medical judgment.  
Mild  – Awareness of signs or symptom, but easily tolerated.  
Moderate – Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity.  
Severe – Incapacitating with inability to perform usual activity . 
13.3.3. Relationship to study medication  
The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study 
medication and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical judgment and 
consider all relevant factors ( e.g., temporal relationship, location of the event, the subject’s 
relevant medical history, concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_118199]) to determine the 
relationship of the AE to the study medication . The investigator will define the relationship of an 
AE to the study medication by [CONTACT_118238]: 
Related  – There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study medication and the 
AE. 
Protocol:  ATI -502-AD-201 
Version 2.0:  [ADDRESS_257365] 2018  Amendment 1  
 42  
    Not Related  – There is not a reasonable causal relationship between the study medication 
and the AE.  
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey in general that there are facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship (International Conference on 
Harmon ization [ICH] E2A).  
13.3.4. Procedures for reporting adverse events  
At each post -enrollment visit, the investigator will question the subject to elicit AEs using a non -
directive question such as “Has there been any change in your health since the previous study 
visit?”  If appropriate, based on the subject’s response to non- directed questioning to elicit AEs, 
the investigator will follow -up with directed questions and appropriate evaluations. 
Any AE noted during the reporting period must be reported in the source documents and on the 
appropriate AE eCRF. AEs that are defined as “Not Related” to the study medications will be 
followed until they are resolved or until the subject’s last study visit. AEs that are defined as 
“Related” to the study medications will be fo llowed until they are resolved or, if not resolved at 
the subject’s last study visit, until in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the AE reaches a clinically 
stable outcome with or without sequelae.  
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on Aclaris pregnancy form.  
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_174509] a contraceptive medication. 
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous misca rriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the patient was 
discontinued from the study.  
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be 
handled as AEs.  
13.3.5. Procedure for reporting a serious adverse event  
Upon becoming aware of a SAE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether or not related 
to the study medications, the investigator must:  
1. Take the appropriate medical action to ensure the subject’s safety . 
2. Immediately inform the Safety Monitor of the SAE by [CONTACT_6968], ensuring that the subject 
information is deidentified (only subject initials and subj ect number) to : ProPharma, 
Email: [EMAIL_2427] . 
3. Print a copy of the email confirmation from ProPharma and place in the study file.  
4. Within 24- hours complete, as fully as possible, an AE eCRF  and an SAE form; e -mail the 
forms and any other relevant information ( e.g., concomitant medication eCRF , medical 
history eCRF , laboratory test results) to ProPharma . 
5. Monitor and document the progress of the SAE until it resolves or, if not resolved after 
the subject’s last study visit, until in the o pi[INVESTIGATOR_118200] a 
clinically stable outcome with or without sequelae AND the investigator and Aclaris

(IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC).  
13.4. Pregnancy  
13.4.1. Definition of Woman of Child Bearing Potential (WOCBP)  
WOCBP includes any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone 
successful surgical sterilization ( e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral  tubal ligation, or bilateral 
oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as ≥[ADDRESS_257367] at screening and a negative UPT at Baseline prior to randomization. 
13.4.2. Highly Effective Methods of Birth Control  
The Investigator or sub -investigator will discuss the potential risk factors associated with 
pregnancy and the importance of maintaining a highly effective method of contraception 
throughout  the study with all WOCBP (for example, those which result in a low failure rate -  i.e., 
less than 1% per year - when used consistently and correctly) .  All WOCBP must use a highly 
effective method  of birth control  during the study and for 30 days after the  final dose of study 
medication in a manner such tha t risk of failure is minimized.   
 
Highly effective methods include:  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation: 
o oral 
o intravaginal  
o transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: 
o oral 
o injectable  
o implantable  
• intrauterine device (IUD)  
• obstruction of fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_118202] (Essure™)  
• intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• vasectomized partner1 
• sexual abstinence2 
1Vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner 
of the WOCBP trial participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the 
surgical success.  
2 Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual

Version 2.0:  [ADDRESS_257368] be on a highly effective method of birth control for the following timeframes prior 
to study entry:  
• Implants (on a stable dose for ≥ 30 days)  
• Injectables (on a stable dose for ≥ 30 days)  
• Patches (on a stable dose for ≥ 30 days)  
• Combined oral contraceptives (on a stable dose for ≥ 30 days)  
• Intrauterine devices (inserted for ≥30 days) . 
Prior to trial enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importanc e of avoiding pregnancy 
during trial participation and of the potential risk factors associated with  pregnancy  while in the 
study .  The subject must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion.  During the 
trial, all WOCBP will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_119112] ( e.g., missed or late menstrual period).  
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study medication 
administration, the study medication mu st be withheld until the results of a pregnancy test are 
available.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study medication and must be 
discharged from the study.  
If, following study medication administration, it is determined that the s ubject  or partner of a 
male subject  may have been or was pregnant at the time of study medication exposure (including 
at least 2 days after study medication administration) the investigator must immediately notify 
the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Medical Mon itor and record the event on a pregnancy surveillance 
form. While not an AE or SAE, the investigator must report every pregnancy using a pregnancy 
surveillance form and follow the reporting procedures described for SAE reporting.  
Protocol -required procedur es for trial discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] ( e.g., x- ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated. In addition, the investigator must re port 
to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.’s Medical Monitor on the pregnancy surveillance form, follow -up 
information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. 
Infants should be followed for a minimum of six weeks.

study initiation to familiarize CRAs with the disease, the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), 
the protocol and other study specific items.  Team organization, communication and operati onal 
issues will also be discussed.  
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. will provide an investigational center file to each center.  
15.2. Data Collection  
The Investigator must maintain required records for all study subjects.  Data for this study will 
be recorded in the subject's source document and on the eCRFs.  All data on these eCRFs should 
be recorded completely and promptly.  A copy of the completed eCRFs for each subject will be 
retained by [CONTACT_118250].  
Records of the subject’s participation in this study will be held confidential except as disclosure 
is required by [CONTACT_2371]. The study doctor, the sponsor, persons working on behalf of the sponsor, and 
under certain circumstances, the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration and the 
Institutional Review B oard will be able to inspect and copy confidential study -related records 
that identify subjects by [CONTACT_2300]. Therefore, absolute subject confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. 
If the results of this study are published or presented at meetings, the subject’s identity will not 
be revealed.  
15.3. Protocol Violations and Deviations 
A protocol deviation is defined as an accidental or unintentional change to, or non- compliance 
with the research protocol that does not  increase risk or decrease benefit or; does not have a 
significant effect on the subject’s right, safety, or welfare; and/or on the integrity of the data.  
Deviations may result from the action of the subject, researcher or research staff.  A protocol 
deviation does not involve inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
A protocol violation is defined as an accidental or unintentional change to, or non- compliance 
with the IRB approved protocol without prior sponsor approval.  Protocol violations generally 
increase risk or decrease benefit, affects the subject’s rights, safety, or welfare, or the integrity of 
the data.   
15.4. Study Monitoring  
 
Protocol:  ATI -502-AD-201 
Version 2.0:  [ADDRESS_257371] igational study site to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  or its 
representatives.  This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between  Aclaris 
Therapeutics, Inc.  and the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. or representative will have regul ar 
contacts with the investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately  recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product 
accountability checks are being performed  
• Perform source data verification.  This includes a comparison of the data in the case 
report forms with the patient’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other 
records relevant to the study.  This will require direct access to all original records for 
each patient (e.g. clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Aclaris Therapeutics, 
Inc. 
• Confirm A Es and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any SAEs 
have been forwarded to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the inve stigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
15.5. Source Documentation  
Investigators must keep accurate separate records (other than the eCRF s) of all subjects' visits 
that include all pertinent study related information.  A statement should be made indicating that 
the subjects have been enrolled in this clinical study and have provided written informed 
consent.  Any AEs must be completely documented. Source documentation includes results of 
any diagnostic tests conducted during the study . 
15.6. Inspection of Records  
 
Aclaris will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigation facilities for the purpose of  
monitoring any aspect of the study. The Investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the 
drug storage area, study medication stocks, drug a ccountability records, subject charts and study 
source documents, and other records relative to study conduct.

conduct and monitoring.  
Audits may be carried out by [CONTACT_118232], Inc. or Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.’s 
representatives, and inspections may be performed by [CONTACT_118247]/ECs before, 
during or after the study.  The investigator will provide the auditing/inspecting group direct 
access to all study records (e.g., eCRFs, subject medical records, study medication dispensing 
records) an d the investigational center study facilities. The investigator and study staff will be 
available and will assist the auditing/inspecting groups as appropriate.  
Protocol:  ATI -502-AD-201 
Version 2.0:  [ADDRESS_257374] -recruiting 
advertisements, and any amendments to these items will receive IRB/EC approval prior to use.  
The IRB/EC must receive a copy of the Investigator’s Brochure, all protocol amendments, safety 
reports and other study related information as required by [CONTACT_214247]/EC procedures.  
17.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The rights, safety and well -being of the subjects are the most important considerations in this 
study and take priority over the interests of society and science.  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles originating from the 
Declaration of Helsinki, the ICH E6 GCP guideline, local regulatory requirements and, at US 
investigational centers, in compliance with the HIPAA. The study will be conducted in 
compliance with the IRB/EC approved version of the protocol and any applicable amendments.  
17.3. Written Informed Consent  
The Principal Investigator(s) at each center will ensure that the subject is given full and adequate 
oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study.  
Subjects must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time.  The 
subject should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the 
informatio n provided.  
The subject’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study 
procedures.  The Principal Investigator(s) must maintain the original, signed Informed Consent 
Form.  A copy of the signed Informed Consent Form must be given to the subject. 
17.4. Study Conduct and Protocol Amendments  
 
With the exception of eliminating an immediate hazard to a subject, the investigator should not 
deviate from the protocol or implement any changes without prior written approval from the 
Aclari s Therapeutics, Inc.’s representative or designee and prior review and documented 
approval from the IRB/EC. 
 
Changes that involve only logistical or administrative changes are allowed.  The investigator 
should document and explain any deviation from the pr otocol.  A protocol deviation is a non-
adherence to protocol -specific study procedures or schedules that does not increase the risk to a 
study subject and does not affect the scientific integrity of the study.   
 
A protocol violation is defined as any dive rgence from the protocol -specific study procedures or 
schedules that may result in an increased risk to a study subject or that affect the scientific 
integrity of the study.  All protocol violations must be reviewed by [CONTACT_214248] t he IRB by [CONTACT_737], as directed by [CONTACT_1201] -specific procedures.

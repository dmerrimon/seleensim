Protocol  
The Senior Companion Program Plus 
Background  
Approximately 6.7 million Americans aged  65 years  and older are currently impacted by 
[CONTACT_135998] s (ADRD) [1]. Given that age is a key risk factor for 
ADRD  and the number of older Americans  continues to grow , it is expected that cases of ADRD 
will also increase  [1]. ADRD is a disease marked by [CONTACT_135999]. Informal  family caregivers provide most of the care to persons with ADRD , 
and they are at greater risk for negative physical and psychosocial outcomes when compared to 
noncaregivers or other types of caregivers [2]. 
Several  intervention  strategies  have been  implemented and evaluated  to alleviate  stressors  
and other negative  outcomes  among  dementia  family  caregiving.  In particular, research 
suggests that  psychoeducational  interventions  may positively  impact  caregive r well -being , 
including burden  [3], perceived health  [4], and mental health  [5,6] . While most 
psychoeducational  interventions  use trained interventionist s, [7,8] peer-led interventions  have  
demonstrated  considerable  promise . For example, research suggests that peer -led interventions 
may enhance family caregivers’ social support and help with the management of chronic
conditions  [9,10,11] . Additionally, the translation potential of peer -led programs is further  
enhanced  because  of the use of lay providers rather than trained interventionists.  
African American ADRD  Caregivers  
Based  on demographic projections, the African American older population will grow to nearly 
11% of the older adult population in the [LOCATION_002] by 2050  [12]. Compared to White people , 
African Americans are about [ADDRESS_154464]  [1] and may live longer with 
ADRD than other races  [13]. However, there  exist  a number  of disparities  in how ADRD  is 
diagnosed  and treated  among  African American  older  adults.  For example,  research  suggests 
that missed  diagnoses  of ADRD  occur more often  among  older  African American adults  than 
Whites [14].  
These disparities also affect African American ADRD family caregivers. Among  this group , 
outcomes related to caregiver burden  are mixed . For example, as reported by  [CONTACT_136000] [15], 
a study presented by [CONTACT_136001]  [16] indicated low scores on the Zarit Burden Scale  [17] in 
African American ADRD family caregivers of persons with moderate to severe ADRD. 
However, the qualitative findings suggested that ADRD family caregivers experienced several 
challenges related to finances, safety concerns such as wanderi ng, and providing physical care. 
Similarly, Brewster and colleagues  [15] reported that in a mixed methods study of African 
American ADRD family caregivers conducted by [CONTACT_136002], participants scored relatively high 
on measures of quality of lif e but qualitatively reported stress and negative aspects related to 
caregiving  [18]. Although  psychosocial interventions  for dementia  caregivers  have shown  
promise,  more research on culturally relevant  interventions for African American ADRD 
caregivers is needed.   
 
 The Senior Companion Program  
The Senior  Companion  Program  (SCP)  is one of 3 core programs  funded  by [CONTACT_136003] . 
The SCP focuses on lower income, older adult volunteers providing assistance  and friendship  to 
other older adults who need support with daily living tasks  [19]. SCP volunteers must be “at least 
[ADDRESS_154465] level of independent living”  [20]. Senior companions ( SCs) serve as 
volunteers for [ADDRESS_154466] hourly stipends  [20]. SCs’ typi[INVESTIGATOR_135974], offering medication reminders, 
accompanying their care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (CR) to social activities and medical appointments, and 
provid ing respi[INVESTIGATOR_135975]  [20]. 
 
The Senior Companion Program Plus  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_135976],  many  ADRD  caregivers  still report  
significant stress , as the SCP does not currently  include  a unique service  to address  caregiver  
stress/burden  for ADRD caregivers  [21]. Augmenting the SCP with ADRD specific training is 
ideal as it extends  the typi[INVESTIGATOR_135977].  
 
Study P urpose  
The Senior  Companion  Program  Plus (SCP  Plus)  is the proposed  intervention  adapted  from  
the work  of Morano  and King  [22]. However,  the SCP Plus differs  from  that work  by 
[CONTACT_136004]  (ie, SCs) rather  than clinical  experts  to deliver  the intervention  to 
increase  its accessibility  and translational  potential.  In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_135978] [23,24] , 
the research  team  held focus  groups  with African American  SCs to refine  the work  of 
Morano  and King  [22] and to adapt  their intervention  for use with the SCP. The SCP Plus 
trains SCs as lay provider “interventionists ” to deliver a [ADDRESS_154467] caregivers. The SCP Plus includes 9 educa tional 
module s that cover topi[INVESTIGATOR_135979], safety, strategies for challenging behaviors, 
communication, copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], finding purpose/meaning in caregiving, and community -based services 
(for an overview of each module, see  Fields et al [23]). 
 
The SCP Plus includes  [ADDRESS_154468]  over a 2-day period  
and reviews  the essential components  of the intervention.  Following  this training,  SCs 
deliver  1 module  of SCP Plus to the  African American  dementia  caregivers  during  a weekly,  
60-minute  meeting  in the caregivers’  or CRs’  homes over  a 3-month  period  (for a total of 9 
hours).  Based  on the success  of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_135978] [23,24] , the proposed  project  
will expand  the program  to [ADDRESS_154469]  a randomized  evaluation  of efficacy . 
For this proposed  study,  the revised  sociocultural  stress  and copi[INVESTIGATOR_135980]  [25,26]  provides  
the conceptual framework  to examine  caregiver  burden  along  with how cultural  values  
affect  the copi[INVESTIGATOR_135981],  social  support, and  well-being  of ADRD  caregivers.  Specifically, the 
aims and hypotheses of the proposed study are listed below:  
 
• Aim 1: We will examine  the specific  effects  of the Senior Companion Program 
Plus (SCP Plus) to increase knowledge about Alzheimer disease, reduce  caregiver  
 
 burden  and stress,  and increase  caregiver  well-being  after the  SCP Plus 
intervention.  
• Hypothesis  1: Participants  will indicate  clinically  significant  and statistically  
significant  (P<.05)  reductions  in caregiver  burden/stress  and increased  caregiver  
well-being  at 3 months  and at a 6-month  postintervention interval.  
• Aim 2: We will examine  the specific  effects  of the SCP Plus to improve  caregiver  
copi[INVESTIGATOR_135982].  
• Hypothesis  2: Participants  will indicate  statistically  significant  (P<.05)  
improvements  in copi[INVESTIGATOR_135983].  
• Aim 3: We will analyze the  specific  effects  of the SCP Plus to increase  caregiver  
satisfaction  with social  support (eg, received  support, satisfaction  with support,  
social  support  network, and negative interactions).  
• Hypothesis  3: Participants  will indicate  statistically  significant  (P<.05)  increases  
social support.  
• Aim 4: We will e xplore  and interpret  the statistical  results  obtained  in the first 
quantitative  phase  to help explain why  participants  who scored  in the lower  and 
upper  quartiles  on caregiver  burden/stress  were  impacted  or not by [CONTACT_136005].  
 
Methods  
 
Study Design  
The proposed  study  is a randomized  control  trial that will assess  the effects  of SCP Plus on 
African American  dementia caregiver  stress  and burden,  copi[INVESTIGATOR_135982],  and social  support . An 
explanatory  sequential  mixed  methods design  [27] will be utilized , involving  first collecting  
quantitative  data and then analyzing  the data to identify  subsamples of  participants  who 
reported  the greatest  and least change  in caregiver  stress/burden.  Of the individuals  in the 
SCP group with the highest  quartile  (n=14 ,  25% ) and lowest  quartile  (n=14 , 25% ) of change,  
we will conduct  follow -up qualitative  interviews to  capture  the details  of their situation  and 
present  a more  comprehensive  analysis  that leverages the strengths of both  methods.  We 
propose  a 3-year study.  The study  will take place  in collaboration  with SCP at sites in 
[LOCATION_007],  Louisiana,  and Arkansas with  approximately  114 SC-caregiver  dyads.  Half of the 
sample  will receive services  as usual  (SAU)  without  the SCP Plus intervention.  The control  
group  will be randomly  selected  after baseline  screening  of all family  caregivers , and all 
measures  will be collected  blind  to group condition. To further prevent selection bias, 
statistical techniques such as mixed factorial analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be 
conducted to adjust for covariate imbalance during data analysis.  
 
Participants and Setting  
Power  analyses  performed  with G*Powe r software (version 3.1.9 ) indicated that  a total of [ADDRESS_154470]  size (f =.12)  and a [ADDRESS_154471]  
size estimate  was generated  from  our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299],  which  indicated  a mean  change  in caregiver  
burden  of 2.82.  
 
 
 Study  participants  will be the SC-caregiver  dyads  that include  the SCs (n=114) recruited  
from  the state-wide  agencies  with SCP as well as the African American  caregvers  (n=114)  
for older  adults with  ADRD  who are currently  enrolled  in a Senior  Companion  Program  in 
[LOCATION_007],  Arkansas,  and Louisiana . Each  dyad  consists  of [ADDRESS_154472]  be (1) currently  participating  in the SCP and (2) 
currently  providing  respi[INVESTIGATOR_135984].  As per the requirements of  the SCP,  
SCs must  be “55 years  of age or older,  be determined  by a physical  examination  to be  
capable  of serving  the frail elderly,  and be able to provide  such service  without  detriment  to 
either themselves  or the clients  served ” [20]. For caregivers  that receive  services  from  the 
SCs, they must  be (1) self-identified  as African  American , (2) 21 years  of age and older , (3) 
providing  unpaid  care for an older  adult  with ADRD,  and (4) cognitively  intact  as measured  
by [CONTACT_941] 6-item screener  [28]. The CRs with ADRD  must  have a physician  diagnosis  of 
ADRD  and live at home  in the community.  Caregivers  who are involved  in another  
caregiver  psychosocial  intervention  study  or have  an acute  illness  that would  prevent  them 
from  participating  for at least [ADDRESS_154473] . Participant dyads who are interested in participating 
will be guided through the informed consent process, administered a baseline survey via phone, 
and randomized to one of two groups: (1)  the SCP Plus group that will receive the intervention 
plus SAU  and (2) the control group that only receives SAU as part of the SC Program.  SAU  
include  providing  respi[INVESTIGATOR_135985]/meal  preparation  for the person  with dementia.   
 
Data Collection  
Quantitative data will be collected at pre intervention , post intervention,  and at the 6-month  
postintervention follow -up. The research team will then analyze the quantitative data in [ADDRESS_154474] change  in caregiver  stress/burden.  Individuals  in the highest  and lowest  
quartiles  of change  in stress/burden  will be recruited  for follow -up interviews  to understand  
their results  in more  depth  through  a qualitative  study  analysis.   
 
SAU  Program  
For SAU, SCs volunteer  with frail,  low-income  older  adults approximately  20 hours  a week . 
SCs’  tasks include helpi[INVESTIGATOR_135986] a ccompanying  them  to health  care 
professional appointments,  accompanying  them  t o  recreation/social  activity/senior  center s, 
providing assistance  with ambulation  and mobility,  dressing,  grooming,  and feeding,  reading,  
writing  letters/forms,  light cleaning,  light meal  preparation,  monitoring  for safety,  peer 
support/companionship,  and general  caregiver  respi[INVESTIGATOR_040].  As part of the  SCP,  all SCs receive  [ADDRESS_154475]  all the SCP Plus training  in person  at each site. The training 
protocol  was developed  to affirm and build on the SCs’ existing knowledge and skills related to 
ADRD caregiving  [23]. The SCP Plus training  is delivered in-person , in a group format that 
includes both didactic approaches and role play experiences. The SCP Plus training  will last 2 
days (6 hours  per day).  To ensure  treatment  fidelity  related  to the training,  manuals  and 
protocols  for the training  were  created  before  the onset  of this study.  The training  material  
will be audio  recorded  and reviewed  by [CONTACT_136006]  a checklist  to quantify  
adherence  to the training  program.   
 
SCP Plus is based  on a dementia  caregiver  program  [22] and adapted  by [CONTACT_136007]  [23,24] . ADRD  caregivers  whose  SCs are randomly  assigned  to the intervention  
group  will receive  the SCP Plus intervention.  The SCP Plus intervention  will be delivered  
face to face  by [CONTACT_941] S C  who is a part of the SC-caregiver  dyad.  The intervention involves  9 
in-home  psychoeducational  sessions  over a 3-month  period  with 1 session  per week . 
Every  week  for 9 weeks,  the SC-caregiver  dyad  will meet  for 1 hour in the home  of the CR 
(ie, person  with dementia).  This allows  the SC to maintain  their duties  while  still 
participating  in the SCP Plus program . This also allows  the ADRD  caregiver  to receive  
intervention  in the home  setting  of the person  with dementia.  Each  week,  the SC will deliver  
1 module  from  the SCP  Plus.  “Icebreaker”  questions  are included  at the beginning  of each 
module  in an effort  to answer  any questions  that the ADRD  may have from  the previous  
module  and to facilitate  a time for informal,  supportive communication  between  the SC and 
the ADRD  caregiver.  At the end of each module,  the SC will ask the ADRD  caregiver  to 
reflect  on the content  of the module,  which  will be written  down  in the  form  of brief notes  
by [CONTACT_16274]. The inclusion  of incentives  (ie, retail  gift cards)  will be used to  reduce  caregiver  
attrition.   
 
Measurements  
The outcome  evaluation  will include  measures  of caregivers’  stress  and burden,  knowledge  
of AD RD, copi[INVESTIGATOR_135982],  social  support  and activity,  caregiver  appraisal,  caregiver  physical  
health,  and cultural  justifications  for caregiving.  Standardized  measures  will be used to 
assess  these  outcome  variables.  The study by  [CONTACT_136008]  [29] contains an illustration  of 
how these  measures  are mapped  onto the conceptual  model  for this study.  
 
Sociodemographic characteristics  of the caregiver and their CRs will be collected at baseline, 
such as age, gender, education, length of caregiving relationship, self -rated health  [30], and 
number of hours spent in caregiving, etc. Information about CRs’ activities of daily living (ADL) 
and instrumental activit ies of daily living (IADL) that require help from caregivers will also be 
collected  [31]. The Global  Deterioration  Scale  [32] will be used to measure  the severity  of 
dementia  of the person  with ADRD.  The f requency  and duration  of weekly  contact  [CONTACT_136009].  
 
Dementia  Caregiver  burden  and stress  will be measured by [CONTACT_136010] (ZBI)  
[17]. The ZBI was developed to measure burden among caregivers of persons with dementia 
living in the community  [33]. The ZBI has 22 items measured with a 5 -point Likert  scale ranging 
 
 from (never ) to 4 (nearly always). Total sum scores range from [ADDRESS_154476] shown that ZBI has good validity and reliability 
among various minority dementia caregivers  [34], particularly African American caregivers  [35].   
 
Knowledge of AD RD will be measured by [CONTACT_136011] (KAD)  scale [36]. KAD 
consists of 4 subscales concerning the  (1) epi[INVESTIGATOR_135987], (2) perceived 
effectiveness of different  and currently available treatments , (3) beliefs regarding the perceived 
threat of AD RD for oneself , and (4) how respondents learned about the disease. KAD has shown 
good reliability and validity in assessing attitudes and beliefs regarding AD RD among dementia 
caregivers  of diffierent ethnic minorities [37]. 
 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_135988]. The Brief 
Cope questionnaire consists of 28 items measuring the ways/strategies caregivers have been 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_135989] a 4-point scale  ranging from 1 ( “I have not been doing 
this at all ”) to 4 (“I have been doing this a lot ”). The Brief COPE scale has shown good validity 
and reliability in caregivers of persons with dementia  [38]. Religiosity copi[INVESTIGATOR_135990]  (RCOPE) scale t o measure  the positi ve and 
negative aspects of religious copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  [39]. All items are measured on a 4-point scale ranging from 
0 (“a great deal ”) to 3 (“not at all ”). This measure has shown good validity and internal 
consistency among racially and ethnic ally diverse populations of ADRD  caregivers  [34], 
including African American participants  [40].  
 
Social support  will be measured with 13 items from four domains: (1) received support  [41,42] , 
(2) satisfaction with support  [42,43] , (3) social support network  [44], and (5) negative 
interactions  [42]. Social support networks  will be measured by a modified Lubben Social 
Network Scale  [44] that use s 3 items on a 6 -point scale (none, 1, 2, 3 or 4, 5 to 8, and 9 or more). 
All other items have a 4 -point scale that ranges from 0 (never ) to 3 (very often ) [45]. Social 
support measures have been proven to be valid and reliable with ethnic minority dementia 
caregivers  [40], including African American dementia caregivers  [40]. 
 
Caregiver appraisal  will be measured with two components: (1) appraisal of problem behaviors 
and (2) appraisal of benefits. For appraisal of problem behaviors, a modified version of the 
Revised Memory and Behavior Problem s Checklist (RMBPC)  [46] will be used to ask caregivers 
whether CRs’ problems occurred during the past week (yes or no). If the answer is yes, 
caregivers will then be asked to rate how much the problem “bothered or upset” them on a 5 -
point Likert scale ranging from 0 ( not at all ) to 4 (extremely). RMBPC has shown in the 
literature to be a valid and reliable measure for different ethnic minority caregivers  [47], 
especially African American caregivers  [48]. For appraisals of benefits from caregiving,  the 
Positive Aspects of Caregiving (PAC) scale will be assessed  [49]. The PAC has 9 statements 
about the caregiver’s mental  affective state in relation to the caregiving experience. Each 
statement begins with “Providing help to the care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_135991]…” followed with specific items 
(eg, made me feel useful, enabled me to appreciate life more). Each statement is rated on a 5 -
point Likert scale ranging from 1  (disagree a lot ) to 5 (agree a lot ). Studies show that the PAC is 
a valid and reliable measure for different ethnic minority dementia caregivers  [34] and especially 
useful for A frican American dementia caregivers  [50]. 
 
 
 Caregiver well -being  will be measured by [CONTACT_941] 12-Item Short -Form Health Survey  (SF-12) [51] 
and the 16-item short version of the Caregiver Well -Being Scale (CWBS -ShortVersion ). The SF-
12 is a frequently  used screening device used to measure physical and mental health  outcomes . It 
asks participants about their health, how they feel, and how well they are able to complete their 
usual daily activities. It has shown to be a valid and reliable measure with African American 
older adults  [52]. The CWBS -Short  Version  was developed to help family caregivers, clinicians, 
and researchers to identify areas of caregiver strength and areas in which additional support is 
needed. All 16 items will be measured by a 5 -point scale ranging from 1  (rarely ) to 5 (usually ). 
The CWBS -Short  Version  has good content and construct validity regardless of the ethnicity of 
the caregivers  [53].  
 
Cultural justifications for caregiving  will be measured by [CONTACT_136012] (CJCS)  [54]. CJCS consists of 10 items designed to assess caregivers’ cultural 
reasons and expectations in providing care. Each item is measured using a 4 -point Likert scale 
ranging from 1  (strongly disagree ) to 4 (strongly agree ). Summed scores range from [ADDRESS_154477] shown 
good reliability and validity score of this scale with African American caregivers  [55].  
 
Qualitative  Questions  
The second  qualitative  phase  will explore  and interpret  the statistical  results  obtained in  the 
first quantitative  phase.  The interview  protocol  will include  a semi -structured  interview  
guide  to explore domains  of difference  (e.g., perceptions of treatment, level of engagement, 
intervention processes).  
 
Data Analysis  
Quantitative Data Analysis  
After  data are collected  and imputed  into statistical  software,  data quality  will be carefully  
reviewed  and then  checked  both automatically  and manually.  These  review  processes  include 
checking the coding of observations, responses, and out -of-range values in SPSS  software ( IBM 
Corp) , adding variable and value labels where appropriate, checking completeness or any errors 
of data entry, double -checking any errors in statistical analyses, and correcting errors made 
during transcriptions. In addition, data will be reviewed for risk of disclosure of research 
participants ’ identities, for sensitive data, and for private information  to ensure confidentiality.  
Since  all the key concepts  in the proposed  study  are measured  with standard  scales,  
reliability  tests for each scale  and test-retest  reliability  across  the [ADDRESS_154478]  scales.  
 
Any missing  data that are random  in nature,  such as those  due to random mistakes  in data 
collection  and entry , and are not related  to research  staff or patient  noncompliance,  will be 
submitted  to maximum  likelihood  estimation  procedures  to estimate  those  missing  values.  
Maximum  likelihood estimation  for random  missing  data is a common  and accepted  
procedure  for missing  data estimation  [56,57] . 
 
We will apply  an intent -to-treat analytic  approach  to the study  data.  For study  outcomes,  
multiple imputation  (using  maximum  likelihood  estimations  referred  to above)  will be 
applied.  Fisher  exact  tests,  Pearson  chi-square  tests,  and independent  sampl e t tests will be 
 
 computed  to test for group  differences  that may be attributable  to caregiver  variables  such 
as gender,  age, ethnicity,  clinical  site, length  of caregiving  relationship,  and number  of hours  
spent  in caregiving.  If the groups  significantly  differ  on any  of these  variables,  the variable  
will be incorporated  into the following  analyses  as a covariate,  thereby [CONTACT_136013].  As noted  in the 
statistical  literature,  large  power  gains  can be achieved  by [CONTACT_136014], ordinary least squares  regression,  and Cox proportional  hazards  
regression  [58]. Moreover,  in the event  that at the culmination  of this study,  our sample  sizes  
are unequal  in the treatment  groups  and our outcome  data are  nonnormal,  we will follow  
through  with appropriate  statistical  corrections  where  necessary.  
 
Mixed  factorial  ANCOVAs  will be computed  to compare  the SCP Plus and SAU  over time 
on caregiver burden  (ZBI),  beliefs  about  dementia  (KAD),  copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  (Brief  COPE ), social  
support,  caregiver appraisal,  well-being  (CWBS - Short  Version ), and cultural  expectations  
(CJCS).  The covariate s will be any significant variable  yielded  from  the univariate  analyses,  
and the dependent variable will be the scores at pretest, posttest, and 6-month follow -up. 
Moreover, 95% CIs will be computed  for each adjusted  mean  difference. The  study  alpha  will 
be set at .05, with no adjustments  for multiple  comparisons  due to the preliminary  nature of  
this study  and the increased  risk of type 2 error s as a result  of alpha  adjustment  [59]. 
  
Qualitative Data Analysis  
Qualitative  interviews  will be recorded  digitally,  transcribed,  and analyzed  using 
conventional  content  analysis  [60]. A constant  comparative  approach  [61] will be used to 
explore  similarities  and differences  in participants  who did and did not benefit  from  the SCP 
Plus.  Multiple  strategies  will be utilized  to address  rigor and credibility including peer 
debriefing and an audit trail.   
 
Ethic s Approval  
The study protocol was approved by [CONTACT_136015] (2017 -0431  on 9/30/2018).  It will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  
 
Results  
This study was funded on September 15, 2018, by [CONTACT_7681] 
(1R15AG058182 -01A1).  Data collection began  on May 16, 2019, and ended on March  31, 2023. 
The study completion date will be June 30, 2023.  
 
The s tudy participants are SC-caregiver  dyads. Due to COVID -[ADDRESS_154479]. There were no missing data, so 
imputation was not necessary.  
 
For the SCs in the 3 sites ( N= 20), all of them were female with a median age of 71  (range 58 -
80) years . More than one -third were either widowed or divorced ( n = 8, 40%). In terms of 
educational status, h alf (n = 10, 50%) of the SCs were high school graduate s or below . All SCs 
 
 reported attending a religious service at least once per month. The participating SCs had taken 
care of their current CR with ADRD for a median of 4.5 ( range 1 -15) years  and provided a 
median of 30 (range 6 -40) hours weekly for their CRs. The majority (n = 17 , 85%) of the SCs 
felt very confident or confident in providing care to their clients with ADRD . Half (n = 10) of 
them reported difficulty in paying for their basic needs ( ie, financial strain). In general, the SCs 
had moderate levels of self -rated heal th (median  3). They helped their CR s with ADL ( median 
2.5, range 0-6) and IADL ( median 7.5, range 4 -8). 
 
For the caregiver participants, the 20 CGs were a median age of 60.5  (41-80) years. The majority 
were female  (n = 17, 85%) , married ( n = 11, 55%), and lived with their CR (n = 16, 80%) for a 
median of 3 (range 0 -48) years . The majority (n = 15, 75%) of the CGs worked outside of home , 
45% (n = 9) were employed full time, and 35% (n = 7) of had to reduce working hours to take 
care of the CRs. The CGs reported that spi[INVESTIGATOR_135992] (media n 3.5, range 1 -4). They 
also regularly attended religious services (media n 3, range  1-5) and often prayed or mediated 
(media n 5, range 1 -5). The majority (n = 13, 65%) of the CGs were children of the CRs. They 
had been taking care of their CRs for a median of 5 (range 1 -26) years and provided a median of 
12 (range 2 -24) hours of care daily . The majority of CGs used formal services “several times a 
week” ( n = 16, 80%) and were “satisfied” or “strongly satisfied” (n = 18, 90%) with the services 
received . The CGs had moderate self -rated health (media n 3, range 1 -5). They reported their 
CRs’ general health as low (media n 1.5, range 1 -4) and their  memory issues as a median of 25 
(range 10 -49). 
 
Next are the key measurements in the pre - and post -tests for senior companions. Knowledge of 
AD/dementia (KAD) ( z = −2.97,  p = 0.003) and preparedness of caregiving ( z = −2.81,  p = 
0.005) were significantly improved for senior companion participants in the intervention group.  
What follows are the key measurements for CGs in pre -, post -, and follow -up tests in [LOCATION_007] and 
Arkansas. Baton Rouge did not complete the intervention due to the SCP programming being 
suspended during the COVID -19 pandemic. Caregiver burden decreased over time ( F(2,10) = 
20.47,  p < 0.001) especially between pre - and post - tests as well as between pre - and follow -up 
surveys. KAD ( χ2(2) = 8.72,  p = 0.01), satisfaction with social support ( χ2(2) = 6.33,  p = 0.04), 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]  F(2,12) = 4.10,  p = 0.04), and P AC (χ2(2) = 11.39,  p = 0.006) also increased 
significantly after the intervention. CJC were marginally significantly improved after SCP Plus 
intervention.  
 
Statistical comparisons were also conducted among key measurements of caregivers between the 
control group and the SCP plus group in [LOCATION_007] and Arkansas. Four key measurements showed 
significant changes for caregivers in the SCP Plus group. Specifically, ca regivers in the SCP Plus 
group reported a significant decrease in caregiving burden ( F(2,6) = 17.65,  p = 0.003), especially 
between pre - and follow -up tests, as well as increase in KAD ( χ2(2) = 6.53,  p = 0.04), 
satisfaction with social support ( χ2(2) = 6.5 3, p = 0.04), and PAC ( χ2(2) = 6.53,  p = 0.04), 
especially between pre - and post-tests as well as between pre - and follow -up tests. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_135993], a finding that approached significance ( F(2,6) = 
4.44,  p = 0.07). Caregivers in the control group did not reveal any significant changes on any of 
the key measurements.  
 
 
 The qualitative analysis led to the emergence of three themes, which contextualize and further 
support the abovementioned quantitative results: (1) learning new skills about caregiving; (2) 
gaining knowledge about ADRD; and (3) benefits for the dyad. These three themes are expanded 
upon below with representative quotes.  
 
The first theme was related to caregivers learning new skills as part of the SCP Plus. Skills 
included CGs’ changing their approach to supporting activities of daily living. For example, one 
caregiver shared:  
 
“Well…[name [CONTACT_4007] a senior companion] had a good suggestion for me that was perfect. …because 
Mom would have all these clothes all in her room and she was still pretty much dressing herself 
and [name [CONTACT_4007] a senior companions] told me to start to kind of remove some of those clothes, but 
to start putting her outfits together, pants and shirt, you know, and then, you know, put it all 
together and that’ll make it easier for her [care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]] to continue to dress herself. And so, 
yes, I learned that from her. I l earned too some little things, especially when she was moving 
towards her dementia things… I say they like to ‘fiddle with things.’ So I learned some little 
traits to have her to do to occupy her fingers and that would would settle her down. So I learned 
some of those things as well.”  (Caregiver, Dallas)  
 
Similarly, another caregiver shared:  
“It turned around a lot of things that I was doing that I found out I was doing incorrectly as far as 
taking care of Mom. For instance. Uh, trying to make her remember things when she couldn’t, 
and I learned in the I learned in the program that that was no t the thing to do. It was more or less 
to allow her to remember it the way that she remembered it and not try to force her to remember 
something that she couldn’t. And so. But I yeah, that was just one of the things that stood out 
with me. So there were se veral things that that I that it helped me with that I changed in taking 
care of her that helped out a whole lot. I mean a whole lot it. It was a a lifesaver. The program 
was a lifesaver.”  (Caregiver, Dallas)  
 
Additionally, one caregiver reported changing their approach to handling challenging behaviors 
of the person with ADRD:  
“A lot of things cleared up and a lot of things learned. How to handle a person with dementia, 
Alzheimer’s. You know, sometimes it takes for you to walk through their delusions for them to 
get to a better place, like even with that.”  (Caregiver, Baton Rouge)  
 
A second theme was related to education, particularly related to knowledge about ADRD. For 
example, one caregiver shared:  
“Ohh man ohh it to be honest with you it was very eye opening about a lot of misconceptions 
about dementia and and honestly not just the misconceptions, but just some things that’s just not 
known., I mean it, it was so much in that that you learn about. De mentia. Alzheimer’s that you 
either ever knew. If it wasn’t that you never knew the the myth and the misconception of it”  
(Caregiver, Baton Rouge)  
 
Another caregiver shared that they learned about other symptoms of ADRD. She shared, “You 
know, we we’re talking about Sundowning. And stuff like that. At night, you know, she [care 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]] was changed completely, completely changed. And I said yeah, th at that that happens 
 
 with me. I told her [Senior Companion] since she completely changes at night.” (Caregiver, 
Baton Rouge)  
 
The final theme was related to the caregivers’’ perspective that the SCP Plus had benefits for the 
dyad. For example, one caregiver shared:  
“I do feel like when we did that [SCP Plus], that it helped us both…I want to say it helped us 
better bond, to talk, to deal with grandmother…It helped us both to be able to talk to somebody 
else…that made a difference…It made a difference for her and I to  be on the same page at the 
same time talking about Grandmother.”  
(Caregiver, Little Rock)  
 
Similarly, a caregiver shared that “she (the Senior Companion) learned very much from the 
training”. (Caregiver, Baton Rouge)

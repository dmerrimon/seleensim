 Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis: 
Participants  
The institutional review board at Columbia University Irving Medical Center  approved 
this study  (AAAR1916). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. We 
enrolled asymptomatic first-degree relatives, hereafter referred to as at-risk parti cipants (ARPs), 
of patients clinically diagnosed with any number of fibrotic lung diseases, including IPF, CHP, 
CTD-ILD, pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) and unclassifiable fibrotic ILD. At-risk 
participants were at least [ADDRESS_993308] year, 
or if they were pregnant. Each ARP was interviewed by [CONTACT_727431]. If the affected individual’s pedigree contained at least two family 
members with pulmonary fibrosis, they were deemed a familial case. Sporadic cases included 
those with no known family history of a fibrotic ILD.  Affected probands with Interstitial  Lung 
Disease, that is, those who were related to the ARPs, were enrolled if alive and available to 
participate in the study.  
Testing  
Each ARP underwent a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the chest 
at full inspi[INVESTIGATOR_157343] a single GE [ADDRESS_993309] machine. The presence of a preclinical ILA, defined 
as non-dependent ground-glass abnormalities, reticulations, non-emphysematous cysts, traction bronchiectasis or honeycombing affecting > 5% of any lung zone
1, was determined by 
[CONTACT_727432]. Focal findings or patterns taking up less than 5% of a 
lung zone were deemed “indeterminate” for ILA and disregarded. If architectural distortion with 
bilateral fibrosis  was present, the radiologists categorized the HRCT pattern per the American 
Thoracic Society criteria (usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern, probable UIP pattern, 
indeterminate for UIP, or suggestive of alternate diagnosis)2. 
We obtained a quantitative assessment of lung attenuation using the Pulmonary 
Analysis Software Suite3,4. High attenuation areas  (HAA) were defined as percentage of the 
lung with attenuation between -600 and -250 HU as previously described5.  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_727429]/European 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_139600]. ARPs completed a 6-minute walk tests  and the cough visual 
analog score.  
We obtained genomic DNA from blood leukocytes using the Gentra Puregene Blood kit 
(Qiagen, Valencia CA). Blood leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was measured using a quantitative PCR assay
6. Age-adjusted LTL percentiles were calculated after comparison with 
normal controls. Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_727430]5B (rs35705950) risk allele was obtained by [CONTACT_727433].  
Statistical Analysis  
We compared clinical characteristics of ARPs with and without ILA/ILD  using chi -
squared tests, Fisher’s exact tests, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests, where appropriate. We used generalized linear models to account for family clustering. Within these models, we included the variable of interest in addition to a random intercept for household number to account for the 
hierarchical nature of the data.

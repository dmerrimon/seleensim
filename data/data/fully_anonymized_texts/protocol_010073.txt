1.1 African Americans, Hypertension, and the Region known as the ‘Black Belt’.   
 
 African Americans have among the highest prevalence of 
hypertension (HTN) in the world.2 Figure 1 shows the areas of 
the US where HTN affects >60% of the US population, based 
on the 30,239-member REasons for Geographic And Racial 
Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study which recruited African American and white subjects from the contiguous [ADDRESS_1091949], overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_791964] (Figure 2). The Black Belt is an agricultural rural region known for its steep poverty and largely African American 
population, and was described by [CONTACT_792015] T. Washington as “ a 
part of the country which was distinguished by [CONTACT_792016]. The part of the country possessing this thick, dark, and naturally rich soil was, of course, the part of the South where the slaves were most profitable, 
and consequently they were taken there in the largest numbers. Later and especially since the (Civil) war, the 
term seems to be used wholly in a political sense—that is, to designate the counties where the black people outnumber the white .”

threat’ to health and longevity.  
 
1.1.a Consequences of HTN in African Americans.  
 
 After a meteoric rise throughout the mid-20th century, cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) mortality plateaued and has had a steady decline since the 1970’s.
[ADDRESS_1091951] experienced the 
same pace of improvement; racial disparities in CVD persist in the 21st 
century,5,[ADDRESS_1091952] stubborn disparities related to HTN 
control.7,8 Although African Americans are now consistently more likely 
to be aware of their HTN and also more likely to be treated, they 
continue to achieve suboptimal control.8 In the 2003-2010 National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 57.0% of African American participants with HTN were uncontrolled.
9 HTN-related 
outcomes that are more prevalent in African Americans than white Americans include stroke, end-stage renal 
disease, heart failure, death at presentation with coronary heart disease (CHD), as well as premature mortality.
2,[ADDRESS_1091953] 50% more likely to die of heart disease or stroke prematurely (i.e., <75 years of age) than White Americans.

In accordance with Patient-Centered Outreach Research Institute ( PCORI) Methodology Standard 1:RQ-
3, which focuses on  identifying “specific populations and health decision(s) affected by [CONTACT_792017], research proposals, 
and protocols,”1 this study will target African American participants.

Foundation estimating 3-8 primary care physicians/10,[ADDRESS_1091955] been reported to be associated with lack of risk factor 
control, both very common in the Black Belt. The 2009-2013 US Census data indicate that of the 30-40% of 
Black Belt residents living below the poverty line, only 1-3% had a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared with 11-12% of individuals living in poverty nationally.
13 Distances are great, with many people traveling an hour or 
more to see the doctor, resulting in fewer visits and less monitoring of risk factors such as blood pressure (BP). 
In the NHANES 2003-10, visit frequency was strongly correlated with BP control (47.8% uncontrolled for those seen >[ADDRESS_1091956] year, 68.0% uncontrolled for those seen once, and 93.3% uncontrolled for those 
never seen). HTN control in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) in AL and NC Black Belt counties is 
shown in Table 1. As can be seen, FQHCs in both the AL and NC Black Belt served greater proportions of 
African Americans than their statewide counterparts, and they also achieved lower HTN control compared with others in their respective states, as well as nationally. Similar data are not available for private practices, but 
national data suggest that their risk factor control rates tend to fall below those of FQHCs.
9 Of note is the larger 
number of FQHC’s in NC relative to AL, demonstrating variability in models of care available for Black Belt residents in the two states.

1.2 Literature Review and Scientific Justification for the Study 
 This proposal advances the science through innovation in the following ways: 
 
1. Black Belt populations have great needs in terms of healthcare innovations, but they are rarely studied. 
 
2. To our knowledge, practice facilitation and peer coaching to improve (HTN), the two interventions to be 
tested here, have not been compared, especially not in rural underserved communities. 
4 
  
3. The study is designed from the beginning for scale-up throughout the Black Belt region, from [LOCATION_007] to 
Maryland. We accomplish this by [CONTACT_792018]-based organizations in AL, with plans to explore a similar community-based 
home in NC. The active involvement on our Community Advisory Boards (CABs) of health insurers and 
the State Departments of Health further strengthen the goal of designing a roadmap for other Black Belt 
communities, should our interventions prove effective and warrant wider scaling. 
 
4. This study is designed as a pragmatic trial, with additional detail provided in section 3.2.  
 
5. We advance methods of community-engaged research for CVD risk reduction, by [CONTACT_792019]. As discussed in section 3.1, we engaged patients, peer coaches, office staff, and practitioners in designing the proposal, and stakeholder will continue to be engaged throughout the project by [CONTACT_792020], CABs, and semi-structured interviews, following a collaborative, stakeholder engaged intervention development and dissemination 
approach. This study represents the culmination of 6 years of community-engaged research, with each 
subsequent study responding to community expressed needs. The study team’s first project in the AL Black Belt responded to community requests for diabetes programs;
14,[ADDRESS_1091957] responded 
to peer coach requests for programs to help individuals with diabetes and chronic pain to be able to 
exercise;[ADDRESS_1091958] in rural primary care practices for help with practice transformation 
and the meaningful use of their electronic health records (EHRs).  
6. The conceptual framework guiding this study is highly innovative, proposing that different types of 
interventions may operate better for clinical situations with high vs. low uncertainty. We will test the concept that structural or procedural interventions, like practice facilitation, may be best suited to improve low uncertainty situations (e.g., algorithms for BP management), and that relationship-based 
interventions like peer coaching may be best suited to improve high uncertainty situations (e.g., 
medication or lifestyle adherence). As such, this study will encourage a paradigm shift for selecting types of interventions based on the level of clinical uncertainty.  
 
7. In response to our prior work with practitioners in the Black Belt, we use functional interventions ideally 
suited to steppi[INVESTIGATOR_412139], since both practices and patients in rural areas have varied needs. Each of 
the interventions will operationalize key functions, encouraging customization at both the practice and 
individual levels, thereby [CONTACT_792021]. While not an 'adaptive trial 
design', which requires a prospectively planned opportunity for modifying the design of the study based on interim data analysis, the functional nature of the interventions permits steppi[INVESTIGATOR_791965]. For example, in a practice that already knows how to construct registries, the approach to 
creating a HTN registry may require less intensive effort than in a practice still using paper records. 
 
8. We have designed the study as an implementation trial using the Reach Effectiveness Adoption 
Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) implementation framework and collecting substantial process data designed to enhance eventual scale-up in a wide variety of practice settings commonly encountered in the Black Belt and other rural areas.  
 
9. The Affordable Care Act provides a sustainability framework, strengthened by [CONTACT_293601] 2015 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announcement for its plans to move rapi[INVESTIGATOR_332936] 85% 
value-based reimbursements within [ADDRESS_1091959] 1:RQ-[ADDRESS_1091960] states: “When evaluating an intervention, the comparator 
5 
 treatment(s) must be chosen to enable accurate evaluation of effectiveness or safety compared to other viable 
options for similar patients. Researchers should make explicit what the comparators are and how they were 
selected, focusing on clearly describing how the chosen comparator(s) define the causal question, reduce the 
potential for biases, and allow direct comparisons. Generally, non-use (or no specific treatment) comparator 
groups should be avoided unless no specific treatment is a likely option in standard care.”[ADDRESS_1091961] century.18-21 Key features of practice 
transformation include shifting the focus from single patients to populations, and from physician-centric to team-based clinical management; it emphasizes self-management support and maximizes the use of EHRs, 
including the creation of registries, audit and feedback programs, and outreach.
22 The National Committee on 
Quality Assurance (NCQA) offers formal recognition for practice transformation that now includes nearly 7000 practices.
18 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced on January 26, [ADDRESS_1091962] 85% of all Medicare fee-for-service payments tied to quality or value by [CONTACT_5638] 2016, with 30% 
of these payments through alternative payment models, such as “advanced” patient centered medical homes.[ADDRESS_1091963] primary care practices make the required structural and 
process changes. Practice facilitation involves a trained, 
certified individual visiting the practice regularly over several months to teach how to work in teams and fully utilize the 
potential of EHRs.  
 
According to Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s 
(AHRQ’s) Practice Facilitation Handbook,  facilitators “support 
change in practices by [CONTACT_297928]… attention on the process of 
change and by [CONTACT_792022].”
[ADDRESS_1091964] with the practice team; help them to assess the 
practice, set goals, and build capacity to gather data to create 
performance metrics; and help the practice monitor its performance, map workflows, and implement plan-do-study-act 
cycles to improve the quality of care (see Table 2). Assumptions behind practice facilitation are that many 
practices are inadequately resourced and lack experience and skills to make transformative changes on their 
own. A key aspect of practice facilitation is the relation ships facilitators develop with the practice staff, similar to 
the Cooperative Extension model, in which agents develop relationships with farming families to facilitate the 
implementation of evidence-based farming practices.
25 By [CONTACT_108], practice facilitation interventions are 
highly tailored, steppi[INVESTIGATOR_791966]. 
 
1.2.b The Effectiveness of Practice Facilitation and Practice Transformation  
 
While the enthusiasm for practice transformation is high, early evaluations of pi[INVESTIGATOR_791967]. For 
example, a 2013 systematic review of 19 studies of prac tice transformation interventions demonstrated that 
practice facilitation increased NCQA recognition, but achieving recognition was associated with only a small Table 2. Facilitator functions and example

[ADDRESS_1091965] on patient experiences, preventive services delivery, and staff experiences, with reduced 
Emergency Department (ED) utilization but no effect on overall costs or clinical outcomes.26 A 2014 report on 
the Southeastern Pennsylvania Chronic Care Initiative, an early and large multi-payer patient centered medical 
home (PCMH) pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], showed that while all of the participating 32 practices achieved NCQA PCMH recognition status and adopted new structural capabilities such as registries, only one of 11 quality measures improved 
significantly with no significant changes in utilization or costs of care.
27 A 2013 report on a Rhode Island pi[INVESTIGATOR_791968].28 A randomized 
controlled trial of 32 practices in NY that included 18 months of practice facilitation, revised payments, and 
embedded care management support improved BP control by 23 percentage points in intervention practices, 
but the final control BP rate was only 36%, and there were very modest additional improvements in only one other of the 11 quality metrics.
29 An evaluation of a 9-year practice transformation in 17 FQHCs in lower NY 
State revealed that mean A1c declined from nearly 11% to below 9% among those diabetes patients with A1c 
>9% as the program was implemented, but mean A1c for those with A1c <9% actually rose slightly, and overall glycemic control remained at 8%, well above the goal of 7% recommended by [CONTACT_11026] (ADA).
[ADDRESS_1091966] effectiveness and possible floor effects.31 Their qualitative study was designed to generate new 
theories to explain why some of their group’s collective studies worked and others did not. They proposed that 
uncertainty may play a central role in the effectiveness of interventions. They concluded that structure or process based efforts, like practice facilitation with its quality improvement (QI) focus, may be most effective for 
situations where required clinical decision-making is relatively simple with low uncertainty (e.g., algorithms for 
BP control, HTN patient who has not been seen for a year should be recalled). On the other hand, relationship based interventions like peer coaching may be more effective for more complex clinical management situations with high uncertainty (e.g., medication adherence, healthy eating). Most practice facilitation evaluations to date 
have focused more on quality, costs and objectively assessed experience of care, and less on the quality of 
the relationships that are established in the PCMH. In fact, high quality, trusting relationships with healthcare providers/teams may be especially challenging for minorities living in low socioeconomic circumstances, 
especially in rural areas.

improve self-management within the context of their own lives, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_791969] a healthy lifestyle and taking medications (Figure 3). First and foremost, they provide social and emotional support and encouragement, but they also assist patients by 
[CONTACT_792023]. They link their clients into community resources and back to the practice, encouraging the development of 
continuous relationships with a usual source of care. The key functions of 
peer coaching interventions are therefore assisting, supporting and linking 
into resources and care. By [CONTACT_6073], peer coaching interventions are multi-level, since they reach into the 
community as well as the he alth system, and multi-component, steppi[INVESTIGATOR_791970]’s 
needs.

[ADDRESS_1091968] discussions with someone like themselves, 
building a supportive relationship while the peer coach assists them in carrying out the healthcare team’s recommendations and in understanding educational materials. At the core of peer coaching 
interventions are the relationships patients forge with the peer coach. 
In our past programs, 96% of participants were either extremely or highly satisfied with working with their peer coach. Many of our peer coaches continue to speak regularly with 
their former clients, even years after the formal program has ended. A participant in one of our studies 
summarized his relationship with his peer coach this way: “ She really cared about me. When we first started 
talking I didn’t really know what to think, but she really helped me. I started growing a garden because of her, 
and now it’s so plentiful I want to share the vegetables with her.” 
 
In preparation for the proposal that led to the current study, we engaged [ADDRESS_1091969].
33 One participant said, “ I just want to get out of there as quickly as possible. You ask too many 
questions they start looking, and then they start finding things.”  Misunderstandings are common; e.g., a 
participant noted, “ They always experimenting on you with those high blood pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], changing up the pi[INVESTIGATOR_791971] I go.” Consistently, participants expressed greater comfort with their peer coach than with members of 
their healthcare team.  
 
1.2.d Evidence of Effectiveness of Peer Coaching for HTN  
 
The evidence of the effectiveness of peer coaches to improve BP control spans over 3 decades. A 2007 
review of 14 studies included 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), many engaging urban African Americans; 
their analysis favored intervention effects ranging from 0-8 mm Hg systolic blood pressure (SBP), and 
improved control ranging from 0-15%.34 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a strong 
supporter of community health workers and has promulgated training materials and policy briefs on how to implement such programs.

Belt region, a knowledge gap this study will fill. 
   “I can talk to her about anything and she 
always be nice. I just love working with 
her, it makes me want to do right. She really understands how hard it can be.”

2. Study Objectives 
 
The central objective of the “ Collaboration to Improve Blood Pressure in the US Black Belt –  
Addressing the Triple Threat ” is to rigorously compare two strategies designed to improve BP control in  
primary care practices serving rural Southeastern African Americans with low socioeconomic status 
(SES).  
The AHRQ Disparities Report identifies individuals with rural residence, minority ethnicity, and low 
SES as
 being at high risk for poor health outcomes. The “Black Belt” region stretches from eastern [LOCATION_007] 
in an arc to  Maryland and includes residents with all 3 of these characteristics – the proverbial triple 
threat. This  traditionally agricultural region is characterized by [CONTACT_792024], low educational attainment, 
scarce resources,  and mostly African American residents. The Black Belt is in the heart of the Stroke Belt, 
a geographic area long  recognized to have the highest CVD mortality in the US. The AHRQ Disparities 
Report also cites that the Southeast has lower quality of care than the rest of the US, thus effective 
strategies to optimize CVD prevention in general and HTN control specifically are urgently needed here. 
 
We draw on the growing evidence that practice facilitation can speed the transition to high quality,  
evidence-based care. Practice facilitation is a highly customized, staged approach to helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a practice to 
implement process  and structural changes to enhance the quality of care and improve patient and staff 
satisfaction , e.g., by  [CONTACT_792025]-driven BP medication management, and creating 
registries and audit and  feedback systems using their EHRs. Evidence that practice facilitation can help 
practices to change  their structure is strong, but evidence on outcomes such as achieving BP control is 
limited. An alternate  approach to improving CVD risk factors that is more relationship-focused and with 
growing evidence of  effectiveness involves the use of peer coaches . We and others have shown that peer 
coaches can be  particularly effective in Black Belt communities, where mistrust of the healthcare system is 
common. Further,  CVD risk reduction through BP control requires challenging behavior modifications that can 
be difficult to  achieve using office-based interventions. Our study responds directly to the need for Black Belt 
communities to  know how much benefit their communities can expect to derive from structural and process 
interventions like  practice facilitation, or from relationship-focused interventions like peer coaching, or from 
both. Using well-established  community-based partnerships and the RE-AIM implementation framework, our 
Specific Aims are: 
 
 2.1 Year 1 
 
Aim 1:  Engage rural primary care practices, HTN patients, peer coaches, and Community Advisory Boards in 
AL and NC to collaboratively finalize a practice facilitation intervention, a peer coaching intervention, and a 
hybrid intervention integrating peer coaching and practice facilitation, all designed to improve BP in African 
Americans.  Aim 2:  Create the data systems for the trial . 
 
 
2.2 Years 2-5 
 
Aim 3: Enroll 80 practices and 25 African American patients with uncontrolled HTN at each practice (total
 
n=2000) in a cluster-randomized, controlled, pragmatic implementation trial to evaluate the three multi-  
component, multi-level functional interventions finalized in the UH2 phase compared with enhanced usual care.  
Our primary hypotheses are that each of the three  interventions will improve BP more than enhanced 
usual care. Our secondary hypothesis is that the hybrid intervention will result in greater 
improvements in BP control than the other interventions. While we aim to  control BP in >75% of 
participating intervention patients overall, the trial is designed to detect >15% difference  in BP control (defined 
as <140/90 mm Hg, the primary outcome) between all three interventions and the enhanced usual care arm.  
9 
 Secondary outcomes will include group mean BP differences between baseline and follow-up; quality of life;  
patient satisfaction; healthcare utilization; and provider and staff satisfaction. The study is designed to  examine 
differences by [CONTACT_4321], age, depression, health literacy, and numeracy.  
 Aim 4. Establish scalability of the intervention throughout the entire Black Belt region using extensive process
 
data intended to facilitate future implementation across a wide variety of practices.  To accomplish this goal,  we 
will utilize practice characteristics, patient characteristics, intervention implementation variables and fidelity  
measures, as well as focus groups and interviews with key stakeholders, including patients, peer coaches, 
facilitators, practice staff, and clinicians. 
  
2.3 Hypotheses 
 The main hypothesis that will be tested in this study is that there will be statistically significant differences among the study groups. Specifically:  
 
1) The practice-levels rates of achieving hypertension control at one year will be higher in the practice 
facilitation  group compared to the enhanced usual care group.  
 
2) The practice-levels rates of achieving hypertension control at one year will be higher in the peer 
coaching  group compared to the enhanced usual care group. 
 
3) The practice-levels rates of achieving hypertension control at one year will be higher in the integrated 
practice facilitation with peer coaching  group compared to the enhanced usual care group.   
 
We will test several secondary hypotheses, including a test of whether the combined interventions are superior 
to either intervention individually, and a series of analyses examining changes at the individual patient level. 
Prespecified subgroup analyses will be conducted at the patient level, including examination of differences by 
[CONTACT_4321], age (above and below age 60), literacy/numeracy, and depressive symptoms. See section 8 for details of the analytic plans.

3. Study Design 
 
 3.1 Research Design and Methodology: Stakeholder Engagement 
 
PCORI Methodology Standard  2:PC-1  is: “Engage people representing the population of interest and 
other relevant stakeholders in ways that are appropriate and necessary in a given research context. People representing the population of interest include individuals who have the condition or who are at risk of the 
condition and, as relevant, their surrogates or caregivers. Other relevant stakeholders may include clinicians, 
administrators, policy makers, or others involved in healthcare decision-making. Stakeholders can be engaged in the processes of:  
• Formulating research questions;  
• Defining essential characteristics of study participants, comparators, and outcomes;  
• Identifying and selecting outcomes that the population of interest notices and cares about (e.g., 
survival, function, symptoms, health-related quality of life) and that inform decision making relevant 
to the research topic;  
• Monitoring study conduct and progress; and  
• Designing/suggesting plans for dissemination and implementation activities.  
When applicable, research proposals should describe how these stakeholders will be identified, recruited, and 
retained. If engagement is not necessary or appropriate in these processes, explain why.”
[ADDRESS_1091971] the study question and we continue to 
engage them throughout the course of the study. Our general approach involves 1) embedding members of the 
stakeholder group on the research team; 2) conducting qualitative research prior to the start of the project planning; 3) conducting additional qualitative research (focus groups, nominal groups, and interviews) during 
the study; and 4) regularly reaching out to CABs for advice.  
 3.1.b Input from Hypertensive African American Residents of the Black Belt   
 
In our past studies, we have embedded members of the targeted patient population into the research team, 
which has resulted in invaluable advice and modifications of our preliminary plans. We will again include on the research team a research assistant (T. Davis) who grew up in Boligee, AL, a Black Belt town with fewer than 
[ADDRESS_1091972] working with a peer coach potentially from their same community (including potential 
concerns), attitudes toward home BP monitoring, as well as specific input on study design questions (e.g., 
preferences for recruitment and informed consenting, preferences for retention activities, input on selection of outcome measures). We recruited patients of area practices and individuals with HTN in the social networks of 
[ADDRESS_1091973] in-person groups in community settings, either 
at the practice or in a community location. A trained moderator led the discussions, in many cases community 
coordinators based at the partnering community non-profit organizations (Health and Wellness Education Center of Livingston, AL, and the West Central Alabama Community Health Improvement League).  
  
3.1.c Input from Peer Coaches   
 
Our two community coordinators [CONTACT_512734] and Ms. E. Johnson are both Black Belt residents and 
experienced peer coaches. They provide ongoing input on the peer coaching perspective, as well as 
supervising the AL peer coaches during the study.   
In preparing the proposal, we conducted 4 focus groups with 24 peer coaches and office staff to learn their 
perspectives on barriers to curbing CVD risk in the Black Belt. Lack of education was cited as the major barrier, followed by [CONTACT_792026]. These results led us to incorporate the Patient Activated Learning System (PALS) as enhanced usual care and as a resource for the peer coaches in the 
intervention (see section 6.3.a). We will continue to engage peer coaches throughout the study period through 
biweekly conference calls to help with intervention development; participant, peer coach, and practice recruitment plans; and data collection plans, among other topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. These meetings occur weekly by 
[CONTACT_792027]. 
 
3.1.d Input from Primary Care Providers Practicing in the Black Belt   
 
Our team includes practicing physician investigators, and [CONTACT_682386] leads the AL Practice Based 
Research Network (PBRN), assuring the physician perspective is represented on the research team. In addition, in preparation for this proposal, we engaged [ADDRESS_1091974] by [CONTACT_792028]. The total number of available votes is then used to generate the percent of available votes to facilitate comparison across groups.

9% of available votes. The CABs had some advice that was similar across the two states, for example, both CABs emphasized that the under resourced and overwhelmed state of many practices will be an implementation barrier for practice facilitation, and that data on the benefit to patients of this type of program will be important for long-term sustainability. On the other hand, the AL CAB members voiced concerns about 
the conservative nature of doctors in the rural Black Belt, whereas the NC CAB members advised that 
numerous projects ongoing in the state may pose a challenge.  
 The advice from the CABs was used to shape the approach to recruiting practices, with a set of talking 
points developed for recruitment discussions. The advice also shaped the type of data collected, emphasizing process and cost data to facilitate implementation.  3.1.g Community meetings 
 
In the final year of the study, we will plan a series of community meetings to share the findings of the study 
and plan for sustainability should the results prove favorable. We will work with our community partners to identify suitable venues for these meetings and feature community members prominently in the presentations.   
3.2 Design of the Study  
 
This study is a  cluster randomized trial with pre-planned subgroup analyses (Figure 4). We will compare 
the effectiveness of [ADDRESS_1091977] one another. Since our conceptual framework posits that a 
structure/process intervention will operate differently than a relationship-based intervention, this design is 
optimal for testing the effectiveness of each type of intervention on BP control.

3.3 Study Population: Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for trial participants are shown in Table 5. Concordant with the 
pragmatic trial context, inclusion and especially exclusion criteria are kept to a minimum to maximize 
generalizability. 
*Uncontrolled hypertension will be determined by a mean systolic blood pressure >[ADDRESS_1091978] in the preceding year AND a value >140/90 mm Hg assessed by [CONTACT_792029].  
 
3.4 Definition of Hypertension  
 
Hypertension (HTN), or high blood pressure, is a common disorder affecting about [ADDRESS_1091979] of health outcomes including stroke, heart attack, kidney failure requiring dialysis, vascular disease, and heart failure, among others.  
 
Hypertension has long been defined as blood pressure that is 140/90 mm Hg or greater. Table 6 shows the 
categories of abnormal BP according to pre-2017 guideline, including pre-hypertension and hypertension. 
Hypertension is commonly categorized into Stage 1 or Stage 2, depending on the degree of elevation.  
 
Table 6. Stages of High BP in Adults . 
Stages of High Blood Pressure in Adults Systolic  Diastolic 
Prehypertension 120-139 OR 80-89 
High Blood Pressure – Stage 1 140-159 OR 90-99 
High Blood Pressure – Stage [ADDRESS_1091980] a second measurement 
within 2 months to confirm the BP elevation. Those with Stage 2 hypertension need not wait for confirmation 
prior to initiation of evaluation and treatment. 
 
As a practical matter, BP even within a single patient is highly variable from visit to visit. The Counseling 
African Americans to Control Hypertension (CAATCH) community based intervention to control hypertension 
enrolled patients with BP >140/90 mm Hg at baseline; the investigators found that >40% of both intervention 
and control subjects were controlled at follow-up39,40. This suggests that unless more stringent criteria are used 
to identify uncontrolled hypertension, the results of this study could also be impacted by a similar regression to 
the mean. However, although at least two trials in pragmatic settings have used higher thresholds of BP higher 
than 140/90 mm Hg as inclusion criteria, none had an empi[INVESTIGATOR_791972]. It is worth noting that in one of these trials, the use of the higher threshold was prompted by [CONTACT_792030].

 Absent an established approach to minimizing regression to the mean in hypertension trials, we examined 
data from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Reduce Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), which 
was a large, pragmatic, hypertension trial in which 50% of participants achieved BP control at [ADDRESS_1091981] whether hypertension would be controlled at one year. Overall we found that approximately 39% of those uncontrolled at [ADDRESS_1091982] important predictor was a mean blood pressure through 9 months of >148 mm 
Hg. This group comprised approximately 60% of those uncontrolled at 9 months but had a lower control rate at 
one year of 30%. To simplify logistics, in this study, uncontrolled hypertension was to be defined as a mean 
systolic blood pressure >[ADDRESS_1091983] a measurement by [CONTACT_792031] 140/90 mm Hg (140 systolic or 90 diastolic) or greater.  
 
In November, 2017, the 2017 ACC /AHA/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/AGS/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA Guideline 
for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure  in Adults was announced. 
This guideline proposed that hypertension should be defined as a blood pressure of >130/80 mm Hg, and that 
blood pressure between 130/80 and 139/89 mm Hg shoul d be defined as Stage 1, with values of 140/[ADDRESS_1091984] a mean systolic blood pressure of 150 mm Hg or higher over the previous year as well as a blood pressure of 140/90 or greater on enrollment day made many of these patients ineligible for the trial. This created confusion in our partnering clinics. In addition, recruitment was not 
completed within the allotted 90 day period at some clinics. These considerations coupled with the new 
definition of hypertension led us to modify the inclusion criteria to require a mean in-clinic systolic blood 
pressure of 140 mm Hg over the previous year (i.e., the 150 mm Hg criterion was lowered to 140 mm Hg). This 
modification resulted in the trial focusing on treatment of Stage 2 hypertension according to the 2017 
guidelines.   3.5 Study Outcomes 
 
3.5.a Primary Outcome Defined  
The RFA for this study required that the primary outcome be the improvement in BP control to less than 
Stage 2 hypertension between baseline and follow-up between practices in any of the intervention arms (A, B, 
or C in Figures 4 and 5) and the enhanced usual care arm (D) (Table 7). We operationalize this as a patient-
level outcome of the proportion of patients with controlled Stage 2 hypertension in the relevant trial arm at the 
one-year follow-up. 
 
3.5.b Secondary Outcomes Defined 
 
Secondary outcomes include the change in systolic BP between baseline and follow-up; quality of life 
(depressive symptoms, physical and mental functioning); and patient and practice team satisfaction.  
Preliminarily, we propose a target of controlled Stage 2 hypertension to mean <140/[ADDRESS_1091985], there 
was considerable controversy following the 2014 Evidence-Based Guideline for the Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults (JNC8) recommendation to relax the BP target for patients with hypertension aged >60 
years. Second, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) was stopped earlier than its projected 
project period due to unexpectedly strong beneficial effects of BP control to a target of 120/[ADDRESS_1091986] 1:RQ-6 , 
we will “provide information that supports the selection of outcomes 
as meeting the criteria of “patient-centered” and “relevant to 
decision makers,”1 such as patient and decision-maker input from 
meetings, surveys, or published studies.” Our discussions with 
patients, providers, peer coaches, practice facilitators, and the 
stakeholders engaged in the CABs shaped the selection of the 
study outcomes, which are both patient-centered and relevant to 
decision makers. As described in the Background and Significance 
(section 1), high blood pressure is a leading killer among African Americans, and leads to significant morbidity. Control of high blood 
pressure is a high priority in our partnering communities, confirming 
that this outcome is patient-centered.  
 
3.6 Pragmatic Elements 
 
This study is designed as a pragmatic implementation trial. The elements which meet the Pragmatic- 
Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary (PRECIS) criteria for pragmatic trials are shown in Table 8.

[ADDRESS_1091989] is our experience implementing RCTs in practice-based and community-based 
research in the Black Belt. Second, we offer enhanced usual care as a comparison condition, which is 
attractive to practices and participants alike, who often wish to avoid being in the “control arm” and “getting nothing.”   
 
3.7.b Practice Randomization 
 
There are some structural differences between practices located in the Black Belt region. For example, 
FQHCs tend to have well developed EMRs and quality reporting systems and interventions, whereas the 
private practices tend to have fewer activities in these areas and are more likely to use a traditional model of care delivery. These structural differences may impact baseline measures and response to the interventions. 
Therefore, at each stage of the implementation, we will actively work to balance allocation across these two 
practice types: FQHC and non-FQHC. We will also work to achieve balance by [CONTACT_54443] (AL and NC). The study’s 
biostatistician, [CONTACT_792135], will use a random number generator to randomize the practices and will be responsible for assuring balance across practice type, state, and study arm using permuted block 
randomization with sizes of [ADDRESS_1091990] phase described 
below in section 6 followed by [CONTACT_792033] (see Figure 5). From among the practices ready for 
randomization by [CONTACT_11713] 2016, we will select 4 as the ‘vanguard.’ The [ADDRESS_1091991] practices will be randomized 
to each of the 4 treatment arms/cells of the trial, such that one practice is in each of the 4 arms/cells.  
 
Randomization assignments for the rest of the trial will be drawn from the remaining pool of recruited 
practices meeting readiness criteria. This second implementation phase will be rolled out in stages as shown in 
Figure 6. Because the pool of recruited practices will change due to recruitment, readiness, and attrition, 
approximately 3-6 months before each stage, that stage’s participating practices will be chosen in groups of 
10-12, with [CONTACT_792135] assuring balance across practice types (FQHC vs not) and also across states (AL vs. 
NC) using a block randomization approach. The goal is to recruit [ADDRESS_1091992]. Richman will be able to ensure balanced allocation without compromising 
random assignment.  
 
 
  
 
   
 
  
 
3.8 Blinding   
Ideally, participants, practices and data collectors as well as any study staff interacting with participants 
should be blinded to the practice’s randomization status in order to minimize biases. However, in many trials of behavior change interventions like this one, this is not possible. Nevertheless, we will implement blinding where feasible. Data collectors will be separated from research team members engaged in intervention 
implementation. Patients in the enhanced usual care and practice facilitation-only arms will be blinded to the Y2       Y3    Y4

 practice’s randomization status. However, it will not be possible to blind practices to their randomization status, 
and it will not be possible to blind patients in the peer coaching arms to the practice’s randomization status.

4. Recruitment of Practices, Facilitators, and Coaches 
 
This study will recruit practices (section 4.1), practice facilitators (section 4.2), peer coaches (section 4.3), 
and participants (section 5). In accordance with PCORI Methodology Standard 2: PC-2  we will “i dentify, 
select, recruit, and retain study participants representative of the spectrum of the population of interest and 
ensure that all data are collected thoroughly and systematically from all study participants.”1 
 
 
4.1 Recruitment of Practices  
4.1.a Number of Practices 
 
We will recruit 50 practices in AL and 30 in NC with a higher target in AL because this region demonstrates 
slightly worse BP control than NC, based on BP control rates reported by [CONTACT_792034]’s Black Belt 
counties (Table 1). AL also contains a larger portion of the Black Belt by [CONTACT_37264] (see Figures 1 and 2), and AL 
has more single physician practices, which have been shown to face considerable challenges to improving BP control in their patients with HTN.
18 We will therefore make special efforts to reach out to single physician 
practices. As part of the proposal phase of this study, we obtained letters of support from over 300 practices 
(Table 9).   
 
As of June 2016, we have received signed letters of 
agreement from 29 practices; the practices cannot be named in this protocol until they have received Federal Wide Assurance numbers, and this application process is in 
progress. These practices were selected for the first wave 
because the recruitment team, led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. T. Michael Harrington, Chair of Family Medicine at UAB and a large 
presence in the Family Medicine community in the 
Southeast, has personal connections with these physicians. The earliest physicians have been engaged to further shape the design of the study, including patient recruitment and 
intervention finalization. 
 
4.1.b Practice Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria  
 
All practices located in counties in either AL or NC 
considered to be part of the Black Belt will be eligible. We recognize that there is no formal definition of the Black Belt, and various sources define the included counties slightly differently, particularly around the borders 
of the Black Belt.
[ADDRESS_1091995], the practice inclusion criteria are: 
• Location in the Black Belt 
• Serve a predominately rural population 
• High proportion of indigent patients 
• High proportion of African American patients 
• Internet access at the practice 
• Willi ngness to sign a Letter of Agreement to participate 
• Willi ngness to identify a Practice Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] 
• Willi ngness to modify structure and processes of care with the help of a practice fac ilitator 
• Willi ngness to work with peer coaches

Practices that do not meet these inclusion criteria will be excluded. 
 Once a practice meets inclusion criteria and commits to participating, a Letter of Agreement is signed by 
[CONTACT_792035], described below 
in section 4.1.e.  
 
4.1.c Practice Engagement Methods  
 
We use several strategies to engage practices in the Black Belt with sufficient numbers in the sampling 
frame to assure feasibility (Table 9). [CONTACT_682386], a respected leader in primary care in the state of AL and 
leader of a PBRN leads the AL team’s practice engagement, and Drs. Halladay and Cummings lead the NC 
team’s practice engagement efforts. [CONTACT_467330] leads a PBRN in NC.  During the proposal development 
phase, we secured letters of interest from over [ADDRESS_1091998]’s team 
engaged over [ADDRESS_1091999]. Harrington will not only approach the AL PBRN practices in the Black Belt, but will also make presentations at local meetings of the Medical Association of the State of AL (see letter of support) and the local chapter of the American 
Association of Family Physicians. Our and the NC AHEC work extensively with primary care practices in their 
regions to place medical students in these practices for their ambulatory medicine training, thus they are 
familiar with many of our targeted practices. They will assist with recruitment as well as providing their 
qualitative assessment which will inform decision-making on individual practice readiness as part of the 
Recruitment and Retention Workgroup deliberations. Of note, demand for assistance with practice transformation in both AL and NC is high, as meaningful use criteria are fully implemented and as CMS moves rapi[INVESTIGATOR_791973]-based reimbursement. 
 
The process of practice engagement is sketched out in Figure 6 and Appendix 1. The process begins with 
a lead letter and an informational sheet providing an overview of the study (see Appendix 1). Within [ADDRESS_1092000] between a study investigator and the practice physician. The feedback from the 
Community Advisory Boards and NC AHECs was used to develop talking points for how to respond to potential resistance. The telephone call is followed by [CONTACT_792036]/or an in-person visit. Once a practice agrees 
to participate, a Letter of Agreement is obtained from the practice physician or other authorized official, and the 
practice’s Champi[INVESTIGATOR_791974] (see 4.1.d below). Once the Letter of Agreement is signed, the study team assists the practice with obtaining a Federal Wide Assurance number if the practice does not already have one, and the practice is assessed for readiness to be randomized, as described below in section 4.1.e. If the 
practice has not previously had a Federal Wide Assurance number, the study team will work with the relevant 
Institutional Review Board to assure that practice staff participating in the research have received training and certification in human subjects in research. 
 
To assess reach in the RE-AIM framework, we will track the number of practices approached (lead letter 
sent, initial telephone call completed), the number eventually agreeing to participate (Letter of Agreement 
signed), the number randomized, and the number completing the intervention period. We will collect 
information about reasons why practices declined to participate, why they did not move forward to randomization, and why they did not complete the intervention period.  
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1092001] need populations in terms of 
uncontrolled HTN and CVD risk receive their healthcare in a wide variety of practices, ranging from single physician practices still using paper records to more sophisticated health center networks actively working on practice transformation. Some variety in practice structure and process is desirable in this implementation 
context, but too much variation can also create threats to validity. Therefore, based on the NC team’s 
extensive experience with practice facilitation and practice transformation, we have developed practice 
readiness criteria to assure that a minimum standard is met prior to moving a practice forward to 
randomization. We have devised a ‘speed to readiness program’ for those practices committing to participating 
but not deemed ready by [CONTACT_3476] (see below). Furthermore, it is likely that some practices that express commitment initially may experience changes over time. Because the study design calls for waves of practices being engaged over a 2-year period, it is likely that some practices may not be approached for randomization 
until several months after they signed. Therefore, we will assess readiness on signing the Letter of Agreement, 
and again just prior to randomization.

In brief, the readiness criteria include: 
• Financial stab ility over the study period and no plans to close the practice in the next 3 years for 
reasons such as retirement  
• Engagement and commitment by [CONTACT_792038] 
• No major disruptions over the study period (e.g., key staff position vacant, key staff member going 
out on family leave, new EHR being implemented) 
 The assessment of practice readiness for making structural practice changes is a very new concept and 
the validation of instruments used to assess various domains of capacity for change is limited. The practice 
readiness assessment includes items from the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC) 
scale,
45 which includes two subscales assessing change commitment and change efficacy. The ORIC has 
acceptable psychometric properties in practices similar to those that will be engaged in the proposed study. A 
copy of the practice readiness survey (along with the survey of practice characteristics) is provided in Appendix 2.  
 
Readiness is assessed by [CONTACT_792039], led by [CONTACT_6283]. Shikany and Cummings. 
The data that are considered in determining readiness include: 
• Results of the Practice Readiness assessment  
• Practice characteristics (assessment tool provided in Appendix 2) 
• Qualitative report by [CONTACT_792040] 
• Area Health Education Center (AHEC) team’s feedback 
• Any additional information known to the study team  
 
These data are considered in making the decision whether to move forward to randomization or whether 
the practice may need to be placed in the “Speed-to-Readiness” program (described next) and reassessed at a 
future date. The main driver of the decision is whether the practice is deemed able to complete the year-long 
intervention, and whether there is agreement or strong agreement on at least [ADDRESS_1092002], etc., to enroll at a 
later date.  
4.1.f “Speed-to-Readiness” program   
 
Because some practices may be implementing electronic record systems, or have internal temporary 
circumstances that may preclude meeting readiness criteria, or have hesitation about participating, we will 
implement a program designed to help practices meet readiness criteria, hence the name “Speed-to-
Readiness”. This program is guided by [CONTACT_347131]’s social cognitive theory, which posits that practice leaders may learn from others like themselves, and modify their own behavior accordingly.
46 Peer testimonials are 
effective in modeling results of actions taken by [CONTACT_2312], a core tenet in social cognitive theory.  
 
In our team’s experience with practice redesign interventions, an important impediment to readiness is 
ambivalence on the part of the practice leaders. Practice leaders are more enthusiastic about peer coaching 
interventions, which are less disruptive to practice flow. Since a practice has a 50% chance of being randomized to receive the practice facilitation intervention, the peer modeling aspect of the Speed-to-
Readiness program will focus on practice facilitation.  
 We will offer academic detailing for practices in the Speed-to-Readiness phase delivered by [CONTACT_6283]. 
Harrington, Cherrington, Oparil, Cene, Halladay, or Cummings. Practices will receive monthly telephone check-
ins by [CONTACT_792041], provide supportive encouragement, and use motivational interviewing 
techniques to help the practice leaders work towards overcoming barriers to participation and increasing their self-efficacy.  
[ADDRESS_1092003] for discussion with ample opportunity for questions.  
 
We may also invite practices in the Speed-to-Readiness phase to join biweekly practice facilitation 
Collaboratory conference calls at which practices enrolled in the study and receiving the practice facilitation intervention confer about their progress and brainstorm solutions to challenges they are facing. (Practices not 
receiving the practice facilitation intervention will not participate in this Collaboratory to avoid contamination.) 
This will permit practices in the Speed-to-Readiness phase to hear first-hand from other physicians and staff similar to themselves about the intervention in near real-time.  Practices in the Speed-to-Readiness phase will also be offered a peer mentor in the form of a participating practice for one-on-one discussions and support. 
 
We will evaluate success of the Speed-to-Readiness program by [CONTACT_792042] 3, which will be 
part of our adoption metric in the RE-AIM framework. We will also track frequency of contacts, participation in 
the Collaboratory teleconferences, and engagement with the peer mentor. The study investigator making the Speed-to-Readiness calls will take notes during the call and immediately afterward provide qualitative 
impressions of progress, reporting back to the study team for input and collaborative problem-solving. 
 
4.1.g Practice Compensation  
 
Each of the 80 participating practices will receive a total of $4000. The first payment ($500) is made upon 
enrollment of the practice, defined as having both a Letter of Agreement signed and randomization completed. 
Another $[ADDRESS_1092004] completed baseline data 
collection, $1000 upon completion of the 6-month follow-up assessment, and $[ADDRESS_1092005] an exception to the recruitment target of the Recruitment and Retention Workgroup. This should be an exception and not the 
rule.  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_791975], in rare cases, fewer than 19 participants may be recruited over the 2-3 
month recruitment period. In such cases, after consultation with the Recruitment and Retention workgroup, 
recruitment can be stopped at the practice and over-recruitment at other practices may be initiated to make up 
the shortfall. The guidelines to operationalize over-recruitment are listed below:  
 
1. If a practice has enrolled fewer than [ADDRESS_1092006] enroll 4 extra patients to address analytic issues related to power, sample size, and intra-class correlation. The 4 extra patients could be recruited from one single practice within the same arm, 
or from more than one practice within the same arm (in fact, the second option is preferred from a 
statistical point of view but not required). 
[ADDRESS_1092007] reached 25 enrolled patients. 
 
Payment for practices that over and under recruit will be modified as follows: 1. A practice that enrolled 19-25 will receive the full payment amount ($1500.00). 
2. A practice that enrolls less than 19 patients will be paid per participant at a rate of $60 per participant. 
3. A practice that enrolls more than 25 patients may be offered an additional $60 for each extra patient 
recruited, depending on the relationship between the study team and the practice and the practice’s expectation. The decision whether to discuss extra payment with the practice will be at the discretion of 
the site’s program manager and site PI. 
 
It is imperative that all practices recruit at least [ADDRESS_1092008] promising practices under the purview of the 
Recruitment and Retention Workgroup.   
 
4.1.i Practice Withdrawal/Dropout Criteria 
An occasional practice may need to be withdrawn from the study for a variety of reasons. Some practices 
may close over the study period, whereas others may modify their structure so that the practice no longer 
meets eligibility criteria, or enrollment is too slow for the pace of the study.  
 When a program manager and site PI [INVESTIGATOR_791976] a randomized practice that they feel warrants 
consideration of withdrawal of that practice, they will present the following to the Recruitment and Retention 
Workgroup with the proposal to withdraw the practice:   
• Description of the change in the practice; e.g., changing to a concierge medicine model, insufficient 
population, practice closure, staff opposition to participation 
• The practice’s original eligibility criteria  
• Study arm practice was randomized to 
• Number of participants enrolled and how far along they are in the study  
 The Recruitment and Retention Workgroup will discuss the case and render a decision on the practice’s 
status. Depending on the study arm, participants at that practice may be managed differently.  
1) Practice Facilitation practices:  The intervention will be terminated and retention activities will cease. 
Participants will be contact[CONTACT_792043]. Data 
already collected may be used in some analyses.   
2) Peer Coaching practices : Participants will be notified that the practice has been withdrawn from the 
study and they will be offered the opportunity to complete the intervention if they would like to. For 
patients electing to complete the intervention, the program manager, site PI, and Peer Coaching 
intervention Workgroup will assist the study team and peer coach in managing high blood pressure 
readings on the home monitor that would normally have been communicated to the patient’s practice. The following guidelines will be followed: 
• SBP >180 or DBP >110, no symptoms: coach encourages patient to reach out to their new 
provider, follows up after the reach out to learn what advice has been given; if patient has not 
followed up, coach reaches out to study team for assistance. 
• SBP >180 or DBP >110, with symptoms: coach follows study protocol and reaches out to study 
team for assistance. 
• Other non-life threatening situations: coach follows study protocol; if the patient has not yet 
identified a new provider, coach reaches out to study team for assistance.  
• Monthly reports that would normally go to the Practice Champi[INVESTIGATOR_791977].  
No follow-up data will be collected, with one exception. Participants will be offered the opportunity to 
join an existing practice in the Peer Coaching arm should one be available nearby. If the participant 
25 
 chooses to join another Peer Coaching practice, the follow-up data collection schedule will be followed 
for that practice, and monthly reports will be sent to the new practice’s Practice Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394].  
  
4.2. Recruitment of Practice Facilitators 
 
4.2.a Number of Practice Facilitators 
 
Practice facilitators typi[INVESTIGATOR_791978]. The ideal number 
of practices is not well defined, but the NC team’s experience indicates that no more than 10-15 practices at once is desirable to achieve full engagement and support for the practice facilitator’s entire portfolio. For this 
study, the intervention implementation is staged across a period of several months (see Figure 6, page 15). 
We will therefore plan on 3.5 FTE facilitators, 2 in AL and 1.5 in NC. 
 
4.2.b Practice Facilitator Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria 
 
Facilitators will have at least [ADDRESS_1092009] a cadre of certified facilitators active 
throughout the state.  
 
4.2.d Compensation of Practice Facilitators 
 
Facilitators will be employees of their hiring institutions with salary commensurate with their experience and 
local hiring practices. 
 
4.3. Recruitment of Peer Coaches 
 
4.3.a Number of Peer Coaches 
 There are a number of peer coaching models, spanning from full-time community health workers who are 
employed by a practice on the one hand to volunteers spending a few hours per month providing education or 
navigation assistance on the other hand. In the Black Belt, FQHC’s may have resources to hire a full-time 
community health worker, but other practices typi[INVESTIGATOR_296551]. For this reason, a model which engages part-time coaches who can work as much or as little as they would like works best. Therefore, the number of peer 
coaches is contingent on the case load each one of them would like to handle. In our team’s past work this has 
ranged from one client at a time to a dozen or more.  
 
We have engaged and trained over [ADDRESS_1092010] in being involved in the proposed study. We anticipate requiring 3-5 peer coaches per clinic, 
thus we will train more in order to assure availability. We plan to recruit peer coaches from each clinic randomized to the peer arm. This is a strength of the program, since for scale-up, a major issue will be how to 
find suitable individuals to be peer coaches if the peer coaching intervention proves to be effective in lowering 
BP and improving BP control.  
26 
  
4.3.b Peer Coach Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria 
 
Peer coaches by [CONTACT_792044]. In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_791979]’s social cognitive 
theory of behavior change, we will seek peer coaches who themselves have high blood pressure, or care for a 
family member or close friend with high blood pressure. However, they must also be willing to accept help from 
the research team and community coordinator, especially regarding intervention fidelity. There are additional realities of participating as a peer coach in a research study, such as commitment to the study’s duration, 
willingness to undergo training such as HIPAA and IRB, and willingness to communicate with their client’s 
doctor or nurse. Therefore, to be invited to participate in the study, peer coach candidates must answer “yes” 
to the following questions: 
1. Do you have the desire to help others? 
2. Are you willing to accept help? 
3. Are you willing to become a ConnectionHealth (AL peer coaches) or Open Water Coaching and 
Consulting (NC peer coaches) employee or contractor? 
4. Do you have high blood pressure or do you help a close friend or family member take care of their high 
blood pressure? 
5. Are you willing to attend and complete the Peer Advisor training? 
6. Are you will to work with approximately 5-7 clients over 12 months, by [CONTACT_756]? 
7. Are you willing to attend weekly group phone calls with other peer advisors and study doctors?  
Of note, the peer coach training and certification programs are excellent filters, with the less committed 
droppi[INVESTIGATOR_791980]. 
  
4.3.c Peer Coach Recruitment Methods 
 
A key aspect that informs peer coach recruitment is the structure that peer coaching programs are likely to 
take in the Black Belt region moving forward, as the Affordable Care Act continues to be fully implemented. An 
important part of this Act is provisions to pay for community health workers, but community health workers are currently not implemented in many practices in the area. In AL, practices are predominately private single or 
two-physician practices or FQHCs. A community coalition meeting on the topic of peer coach implementation 
for chronic disease self-management held in Camden, AL in September [ADDRESS_1092011] their own peer coach, even in the wake of the January 2015 CMS announcement 
about the aggressive timeline for transitioning to value-based reimbursement within 2 years. Community members were supportive of a model in which peer coaches worked under community-based organizations 
(CBO) such as the nonprofit organizations led by [CONTACT_792045] a specific practice. 
This way, practices (or Regional Care Organizations) could reimburse the CBO for peer coaching services without taking on the human resources management aspects of this type of care extender.  
 
Another key insight during the development of the peer coaching intervention was the need to integrate 
peer coach into the practice. The peer coach stakeholders that are assisting with intervention development recommended we make efforts to recruit coaches from each of the practices, from among their pool of 
patients. This increases the likelihood of true integration into the care team, since the person being integrated 
is already well-known to the practice. We estimate that we will need between 3-[ADDRESS_1092012] practices do not currently use a peer coaching model. However, there are a number of 
peer coaching programs in existence in the NC Black Belt region, as we learned from the NC CAB meeting in 
February 2016.  Therefore, we will partner the coaching coordinator in NC with the coordinators in AL in a mentoring relationship to assure that the structure of the coaching programs in the two states are similar. We 
will also actively explore partnerships with existing CBO’s in NC over the course of the study to plan for long-
term sustainability. Coaches will be recruited at the practices as in AL, assuring feasibility of travel to the practice. 
 
4.3.d Compensation for Peer Coaches  
 
Peer coaches in our past studies have expressed strong preferences for a fee-for-service model of 
reimbursement, which will again be used here. As such, compensation for peer coaches will follow the 
schedule below:  
• Peer coach training consists of 8 courses. Peer coaches will receive $50 for completing each 
training course, regardless of passing certification for a total of $400 
• For each participant: 
o $[ADDRESS_1092013] 8 program sessions (~2 months) 
o $150 for completing program session 14 (~6 months) 
o $150 for completing program session 20 (~12 months) 
o $25 per month for each additional calls should the participant’s blood pressure become 
uncontrolled with a maximum of 2 months for a total payment of $[ADDRESS_1092014] the support that they need, especially social support. Peer coaches greatly 
enjoy monthly get-togethers with other coaches and the coordinator to discuss challenges, brainstorm solutions, and socialize. The bonds forged in these programs are an important part of satisfaction for the 
coaches. The coordinator’s role is to assess each coach’s level of functioning and assure that they remain 
enthusiastic and committed to the program. 
 
In AL, we have worked with two community coordinators for over 6 years, and these experienced 
coordinators once again fill this role for the present study. In NC, the coordinator is an experienced peer coach 
who has worked on previous research studies with the NC team. As with the AL peer coaches, the NC peer 
coaches will be situated in a CBO led by [CONTACT_14676]. The coordinators are critical in setting the supportive, 
collaborative tone and maintaining enthusiasm for the program. The mentoring relationship will assure consistency of implementation across the two states. 
 
4.3.f Peer Coaching Program Session Schedule 
  
The Peer Coaching program is designed to provide an intensive intervention phase, followed by a 
maintenance phase with boosters as required to keep the participant’s blood pressure controlled (see Figure 
6A). Because of the implementation context, it is important to recognize that strict adherence to the protocol may not be feasible in some cases. Therefore, we have devised the following goals, which incorporate the real-
world issues that often arise and create delays in program implementation.  
 
• Goal: complete session 1 within 30 days of patient signing informed consent  
28 
 o Peer coach and participant should be matched within 2 weeks of participant is enrolled in the study. 
o Session 1 should be scheduled within 2 weeks of the date that the peer and participant are matched.  
o Sessions 1 – 8 should be scheduled and completed 
every 7 days.  
o Sessions 9 and 12 should be scheduled and completed 
every 14 days. 
o Monthly sessions should be scheduled every 4 weeks 
• Program Goal: complete session 20 by [CONTACT_24473] 12 of 
baseline enrollment  
o Compress monthly sessions no more than to be 3 
weeks apart. If monthly sessions need to be completed <3 weeks apart to keep on schedule, use the following the 
guidelines below to drop sessions:  
/square4 Sessions [ADDRESS_1092015] be completed 
/square4 Sessions 9 – 12 Should be completed 
/square4 If needed - drop sessions 13-18 
/square4 Sessions 19-20 should be completed 
• Goal will be to complete session 20 by [CONTACT_24473] 12.  
o 12-month data collection will be scheduled during the 
30 days after the 12-month date 
If the 20
th session is completed befo re the 12-month date, an 
alert with will send to the data collection team notifying them 
that the pt is ready for data collection. 
 
4.3.g Contact[CONTACT_792046]-Responsive Clients in the Peer Coaching Arm  
 
The goal of this section is to provide guidance regarding participant contacts to peer coaches and program 
staff. This plan should be tailored for each participant by [CONTACT_792047].

1- 2* Peer makes frequent  call attempts, varying days and times. Minimum call attempts: every other day  
2- 3 Community coordinator and program staff begin strategizing ways to reach out to participant (program staff should 
work with clinic to check contact [CONTACT_3031], reach out to participants to assess interest in study and verify 
times/days available, making sure that patient knows t he peer’s number to ensure they are not screening the peer’s 
calls). Participant is flagged as “at risk.” 
3-4* Peer makes frequent  call attempts, varying days and times. Minimum call attempts: every other day  
5-8* Peer makes intermittent  call attempts, varying days and times. Minimum call attempt: once/week.

2. Participant is given back to program staff.  
a. Participant will be cl assified as inac tive and peer c oaches paid $200. 
b. Program staff / data collection staff will call monthly or retention calls  to see if participant can be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. If 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], staff will ask participant if they would like to speak with their peer coach (verifying times available, 
contact [CONTACT_2997], and give peer’s number) 
c. If patient is scheduled for 6-month data collection, staff will ask ppt if they would like to work with peer coach 
(verifying times available, contact [CONTACT_2997], and give peer’s number).  
d. Participants will be retu rned to peer coaches if partici pant requests peer calls to re sume. At this  time, ppt will 
be re-classified as active and peer calls resume. See Revising program session schedule protocol.

Special calls: Intensification calls if client needs additional help during sessions 13-[ADDRESS_1092016] to reach, missing sessions, has suffered a 
significant illness or life event, or other situation which would cause the patient to miss coaching sessions or become unresponsive to coach calls can come from many sources. This information may be obtained from retention calls, six month and 12 month interviews, speaking to peer coaches or coordinators, or coaching monthly reports. The following are guidelines on what to do once an investigator or a research assistant or data collector identifies a peer coach participant who would like to drop out from the peer coach arm:  
1) Program Managers should be notified, and supplied with all the information, including if possible, the 
peer coach call logs showing all the calls the coach made to connect with the patient. This information should be entered into the peer coaching database in ClinvestiGator , and the patient marked “At Risk .” 
 
2) At Risk Participants:  Patients can be considered at risk of not completing the peer coaching program for 
any reason.  It can be a temporary status, or it can lead to eventual peer coaching intervention 
withdrawal. 
1. Program staff should work with coaches and practice champi[INVESTIGATOR_791981].  
2. Peer Coaching protocols should be followed with the minimum number of calls to the patients, 
texting etc… and documented in the peer coach workbooks for that patient.  
3. If a patient continues to be unreachable or tells study staff or their peer coach they wish to 
withdraw from the intervention, the appropriate project manager should be notified.  All Non-
responsive patients should be referred to program managers. Program managers should make 
one last attempt to reach the patient and make sure the patient is aware that they can continue in the study, and withdraw ONLY from the coaching intervention.  As needed the PM will mark patient as Withdrawn from Peer Coaching.  
3) Patients Withdrawn from Peer Coaching  
1. Patients who choose not to participate in peer coaching are still enrolled in the study.  They 
should be continued to be tracked, and attempts to complete the follow-up data collection 
should be made. 
2. In addition, once a patient is withdrawn from peer coaching, the alert banner will automatically 
show up on the patient dashboard each time the patient record is opened in ClinvestiGator . 
3. All staff who have contact [CONTACT_792051], and check to see if the 
‘withdrawal from peer coaching’ event form has been filled out. This form is located at the very bottom of the patient database in ClinvestiGator  called “Withdrawn from Peer Coaching 
Intervention.”  
4. All staff who have contact [CONTACT_792052], or at a 6 month or 12 month interview will try to 
complete the form; only one is needed. 
 
  
 
   
 
  
[ADDRESS_1092017] that are often difficult to recruit into research studies. We preplan subgroup analyses on 1) men, 2) those younger than age 60 years, 3) those with low health literacy/numeracy, and 4) 
those reporting mild or greater depressive symptoms. Past reports have shown that male sex and younger age are associated with higher risk for uncontrolled CVD risk factors, and health disparities are also greatest in 
younger individuals.
2,[ADDRESS_1092018] 10 men and 12 individuals younger 
than 60 years of age at each practice; based on our past trials, we know that mild depressive symptoms are 
present in 50% of this population, and health literacy is also very low. The background prevalence and 
oversampling of men and younger individuals will provide enough power to conduct these pre-specified subgroup analyses (see also Analysis Plan, section 8). 
 
5.1.a Participant Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria 
 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table 10. 
Concordant with the pragmatic trial context, inclusion and especially exclusion criteria are kept to a minimum to maximize 
generalizability. In order to minimize regression to the mean and to 
select patients at highest risk, an important goal for our partnering practices, we will select individuals with uncontrolled hypertension, 
defined as a mean systolic BP over the previous year at least 140 
mm Hg plus an enrollment day BP >140/90 mm Hg as assessed by 
[CONTACT_17033]. 
 
Because the control of BP in people with advanced chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) is more difficult and requires special 
approaches, we focus this study on more average patients with 
estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) greater than 45 
ml/min/1.73 m2. We use 45 as a cut point to maximize reach 
without selecting a population that requires management that is too different than that for more average patients. We considered 60 mL/min/1.73 m
2, which is the threshold for Stage 2 CKD, but this threshold may 
exclude too many individuals in this pragmatic setting. In the national REasons for Geographic And Racial 
Differences in Stroke cohort study comprised of over 30,000 African American and white community dwellers aged 45 and over at baseline, 4.2% of African Americans had eGFR
 mL/min/1.73 m2. However, another 7.1% 
of African Americans had eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_1092019]. Oparil, a well-respected expert in the field of HTN, the threshold of 45 mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_1092020] withdrawal criteria. However, over the course of 
the study, a participant may develop an exclusion criterion (e.g., become pregnant); in this case, the participant 
may be withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_792053].  Table 10. Patient in clusion a nd exclusion

5.3 Participant Recruitment Method 
 Participant recruitment approaches will be adapted to individual practices needs. Recruitment materials 
(posters, pamphlets) are displayed prominently in each practice (see Appendix 3), along with a certificate of 
the practice’s participation. The practice staff led by [CONTACT_549043][INVESTIGATOR_791982]; those who express interest fill out an interest card that includes the patient’s contact [CONTACT_792054].  
 
Our experience shows that despi[INVESTIGATOR_791983], practice staff members rarely refer 
many patients because they have too many competing demands.
[ADDRESS_1092022] in-person recruitment with the help of the practice’s staff in 
accordance with HIPAA regulations and guided by [CONTACT_792055]. In AL, recruitment staff members are African Americans from the Black Belt, lessening mistrust as a barrier to participation, and the NC teams similarly will strive to have African American staff. Since the prevalence of HTN is so high in the 
targeted population, and more than half of African Am ericans are not controlled, each practice is given 1-3 
months to recruit the target number of 25 patients. If a practice is not able to meet the target number of 
patients in the given time period, the site research team should refer to section 4.1.h for guidance.  
 
 
5.4 Participant Screening and Consent 
 The number of patients with uncontrolled HTN approached for participation is tracked as part of the Reach 
metric of the RE-AIM framework by [CONTACT_792056]. 
These data are entered by [CONTACT_792057]’s web-based data system. 
 
 Once a participant has expressed interest, the study research assistant screens the prospective 
participant. For eligible prospective participants, the research assistant then provides an explanation of what participation entails:  
• Completing a baseline in-person assessment at the practice,  
• Completing a baseline telephone interview,  
• Providing several alternative telephone numbers to facilitate contact,  
• Completing 6-month and 12-month follow-up assessments,  
• Using a home BP monitor, and  
• Possibly working with a peer coach.  
 
The research assistant also explains randomization, which occurs at the practice level. Willing participants then 
provide informed consent, which is explained and read to the participants by [CONTACT_17033]. The study 
research assistant answers any question the participant may have, and the participant then signs the informed 
consent (see Appendix 4). A copy of the consent form is provided to the participant. Only trained and quality 
controlled research assistants provide the information required to obtain informed consent. 
 
 
5.5 Participant Compensation  
 
Participants are expected to complete 3 assessment visits over one year. They will receive $40 per visit for 
a total of $120.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1092023] been trained.  
 
In order to address these issues, there will be a 3-month run-in phase after practice randomization and 
prior to participant recruitment, as shown in Figure 7. Practices that meet readiness criteria will be batched into stages for randomization 3-6 months prior to anticipated start of patient recruitment.  
 
Run-in activities for those practices randomized to the coaching intervention include: 
(1) identifying coaches who can travel easily to the practices, followed by  
(2) training any new coaches.  
 
      Run-in activities for those practices randomized to the practice facilitation intervention include:  
(1) establishing rapport,  
(2) conducting the self-assessment,  
(3) providing an overview of the intervention,  (4) helpi[INVESTIGATOR_791984], and  
(5) planning for the implementation of that activity.

practice 
~[ADDRESS_1092025]’s provisions for alternative models of healthcare (like practice transformation and 
community health workers) along with CMS’s recent announcement that they will move to mostly value-based 
reimbursement within 2 years together create a unique opportunity to study these two components alone and 
in combination in a very high-need region of the US from the perspective of HTN. This study will implement 
programs that will be designed with practices, peer coaches, and patients with HTN residing in the Black Belt, 
assuring that the interventions are sustainable and scalable throughout the region.  
 For the multi-level practice facilitation intervention, we draw on Donabedian’s structure-process-outcomes 
paradigm and Wagner’s chronic care model.
53-56 Donabedian proposed that healthcare systems should be 
structured to facilitate the provision of high quality care. This long-standing paradigm has guided quality 
improvement and health system design for decades, and is now being applied at the individual practice level. The chronic care model posits that care should be patient-centered and responsive to individual needs and 
preferences, drawing on community resources to optimize health outcomes. Practice facilitation is specifically 
designed to restructure practices and introduce new processes of care with an emphasis on patient-centered, proactive care. Practice facilitation in this intervention will help practices to fulfill 4 key functions:  
 
1) Team-based care  that engages members of the healthcare team other than the physician for BP 
medication management (structure and process change);  
2) Self-management support  through home BP monitoring and engagement of community resources 
(chronic care model);  
3) Standardized Care Process , for example through telephone management (structure and process                
change);  
4) Providing outreach,  based on audit and feedback reports generated from HTN registries (structure and 
process change).  
 
In this functional intervention, facilitators will assist practices in making highly tailored changes in structure and 
process to accomplish these 4 functional goals, aiming to improve BP control, health, and patient satisfaction.  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_791985]-centered care, practice facilitation focuses on processes of care that address 
low uncertainty clinical situations, such as titrating BP medications when BP is not controlled. However, more 
difficult patient behavior modification may respond more to the relationship-focused peer coaching intervention, since behavior change is complex and filled with uncertainties. Bandura’s social cognitive theory posits that we 
learn by [CONTACT_792058], who are “someone 
like me with problems like mine.”
46 Peer coaching is another functional intervention, fulfilling 3 key relationship-
based functions:  
 
1) Assisting  clients in carrying out the care plan;  
2) Supporting  clients emotionally, establishing meaningful, supportive relationships, and encouraging 
them to take an active role in their healthcare; and  
3) Linking  clients into care and community resources.  
 
Adult Learning Theory posits that adult learners are internally motivated, goal and relevancy oriented, and 
highly practical.[ADDRESS_1092026] with the peer coach for health-related questions, allowing the peer coach to be the link to the 
healthcare team to find answers together. In the peer coaching functional intervention, the relationship is the 
34 
 operator to accomplish the 3 key functions, aiming to improve BP control and satisfaction, but through different 
influences compared with practice facilitation interventions. 
 
        
 
    
 
   
 
 Figure 8. Conceptual framework for the study. BP = blood pressure. EMR = electronic medical record. HBPM = home BP 
monitoring.  
We propose that both structure/process improvement and strong relationships are needed to overcome 
distance, trust, and psychosocial barriers to optimize BP control among African Americans living in the Black Belt region. We anticipate that both practice facilitation and peer coaching will have clinically important effects 
on BP, but that together they will generate a greater improvement in BP control trough their complementary 
pathways of influence (Figure 8). As healthcare reform moves forward, the results of this study will inform 
policy decisions at the regional and local levels to help communities and practices in vulnerable regions like the 
Black Belt to decide which approach is right for them, informed by [CONTACT_792059], and how much benefit they can expect to derive from implementing either practice facilitation or peer coaching, or both. 
 
 
6.2 Implementation Framework: RE-AIM  
 
Because this is a pragmatic trial seeking to test scalable, sustainable approaches to improving HTN control 
in the Black Belt, we use an implementation framework to inform other Black Belt practices as they consider the results of the study and implications for their own patients. A widely used framework is Glasgow’s RE-AIM, 
which stands for Reach, Efficacy/effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance of the intervention 
effects.

 6.3 Intervention Approach/ Description 
 
6.3.a Enhanced Usual Care 
 
Enhanced usual care will be the comparator for the study. All practices receive enhanced usual care 
regardless of randomization status, which includes: 
 1) A laptop computer.  
2) The freely available web-based PALS education system. Patients and practice staff will be able to 
access evidence-based information using the PALS question-and-answer searchable system using a user name/logon ID to track utilization. This system offers short, engaging content including liberal use 
of video clips to provide education.  
3) 25 home BP monitors and BP logs that are theirs to keep on conclusion of the study. 4) A binder of practice tips that will include flow sheets and the same BP medication advancement 
algorithm used in the practice facilitation and peer coaching interventions (Appendix 6).  
 
Past research has shown that education and simply providing practices tools without more intensive 
intervention does little to change outcomes.
61-[ADDRESS_1092028] engaged while preparing 
this proposal requested some sort of program regardless of the arm of the trial, and novel education materials 
plus home BP monitors was acceptable to these stakeholders in this real-world setting. Our experience with community-based interventions also indicates that “control” arm participants strongly prefer some sort of 
program rather than only usual care. Therefore, enhanced usual care directly responds to requests from 
stakeholders while creating little chance of compromising the ability to observe control-intervention differences 
and aligning with PCORI Methodology Standard 1:RQ-6  which suggests that researchers “ select outcomes 
based on input directly elicited from patient informants and people representative of the population of interest, 
either in previous studies or in the proposed research”.[ADDRESS_1092029] 4 core competencies:  
 
1) Interpersonal skills to build support for and facilitate change;  
2) Methods for accessing and using data to drive change;  3) Quality improvement and change management strategies; and  
4) Health information technology optimization.
[ADDRESS_1092030] chances for achieving the desired outcome, in 
this case, improving BP control in their patients. As such, practice facilitation is a functional  intervention that 
naturally steps up efforts based on data-driven feedback reports from the practice itself. Practice facilitation is often focused on improving a key quality metric such as HTN control. Based on the evidence, practices will 
implement 4 key functions, including:  
 
1. Team Management: Medication titration algorithm implemented by a nonphysician. We anticipate that 
many practices will implement telephone-based medication titration using the patient’s home blood pressure measures. Implementing an algorithm that advances intensity of treatment has been shown to improve BP control in a variety of settings and studies, many of which have used nurses or pharmacists to titrate the doses.
41,64,65 Physicians often do not intensify the regimen even after several encounters with 
patients with uncontrolled BP,66,67 practice facilitation will result in another healthcare team member such 
as a nurse taking over algorithm-guided medication titration (Table 11 and Appendix 6). The algorithm used 
36 
 here is guided by [CONTACT_941] 2010 Consensus Statement issued by [CONTACT_792060], the JNC8, the 2017 AHA Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of 
High Blood Pressure in Adults, as well as the recently concluded SPRINT trial algorithm (see Appendix 6).
42,68,69,[ADDRESS_1092031] of this algorithm is the attempt to institute chlorthalidone (CHLD) therapy, which is the 
diuretic used in the major clinical trials of HTN. In practice, physicians more often use hydrochlorthiazide (HCTZ) because it is less expensive and causes less hypokalemia. However, [CONTACT_614952]’s 30+ year 
experience in the UAB Hypertension Clinic show that CHLD is a more effective antihypertensive agent: an 
observation supported by a wealth of literature.  When used in doses of no more than [ADDRESS_1092032] the indiscriminate use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors 
(ACEI) in African Americans, citing an ineffective BP lowering profile and a higher incidence of angioedema 
compared with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB): she recommends that ACEI and ARB only be used for 
the patient subpopulation with chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_1092033] of the trial’s participants will be living in low 
socioeconomic circumstances, and cost will likely be a considerable issue for them. For this reason, we will 
include in the algorithm less expensive alternatives like HCTZ. However, we will recommend the medications with the most robust evidence of efficacy as first line, and those with less robust evidence as 
second line.  
 Similarly, we recognize that pi[INVESTIGATOR_791986]’s participants because of the well-known clustering of cardiovascular risk factors in African Americans, especially those living in low 
socioeconomic circumstances. Therefore, we will encourage the use of fixed-dose combination pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], 
several of which are low in cost. We will also include extensive relative cost information which will be as locally relevant as possible.

37 
 Both Drs. Oparil (in Alabama) and Viera (in North Carolina) run HTN clinics at their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Questions 
about care for truly resistant HTN will be directed at them for tailored care.  
 2. Self-management support has evidence for modest benefit.
[ADDRESS_1092035] benefit (~5 mm Hg reduction) of self-management 
support, and earlier studies supported this conclusion.71 Self-management support can take the form of 
group classes, educational materials for self-administration, one-on-one sessions in the clinic, goal-setting, among others.
72 Practice facilitators will customize self-management support based on the practice’s 
preferences and local feasibility. Practice facilitators will also train practice staff on how to use the PALS 
with their patients; the PALS includes engaging educational materials on HTN, BP medications and side effects, healthy eating in accordance with the DASH diet and modified to Southern culinary tastes, and 
physical activity.  
 
An important multi-level aspect of the self-management support function is tappi[INVESTIGATOR_791987], which include nutrition counseling through the Department of Health and the Cooperative 
Extension. Additional community resources include farmer’s markets, community gardens, walking groups, 
and church-based health programs. To facilitate community linkages, Practice facilitators will train practices how to use mydiabetesconnect.com, a diabetes-related resource bank for the Birmingham area developed 
by [CONTACT_792061]. This site has been expanded into the AL Black Belt counties, and we are further expanding this website for the NC Black Belt communities surrounding our partnering practices, drawing on community resource guides developed by [CONTACT_792062],
73,74 as well as suggestions from patients, peer 
coaches and practice staff (see section 3.1.b above). The web site includes local community resources that 
practice staff will be able to use to help patients with self-management support.  Additional self-management support will be through home BP monitoring. A [ADDRESS_1092036] the practices in developi[INVESTIGATOR_791988]-based management. 
 
4. Outreach through use of the EMR: registries, audit and feedback. Facilitators assist practices in the 
meaningful use of their EMRs, where present, to create a registry of their HTN patients, with audit and 
feedback reports to identify individuals who are uncontrolled, and/or have missed appointments. These reports are used for outreach and to re-engage individuals at high risk for uncontrolled HTN. Visit 
frequency is directly correlated with BP levels.
[ADDRESS_1092037] cycles for improving processes that the practice and the facilitator identify as barriers to achieving the goal of 75% HTN control in their HTN 
patients. 
[ADDRESS_1092038], to implement the algorithm to 
guide BP medication titration (Appendix 6), and to enhance self-management support. Some practices may 
implement several activities under each key function, but all will be asked to implement at least one under each 
key function. 
 
An important aspect of this intervention is the successful engagement and activation of African American 
patients. While all of these practices have extensive experience with African American patients, emerging evidence suggests that even experienced practitioners may not utilize approaches and practices that maximize 
patient engagement. For example, although cost is a barrier to medication adherence, many patients do not 
feel comfortable raising this issue with the provider, and few providers systematically ask about affordability of the treatment regimen. Doing so in a supportive, culturally sensitive manner enhances the practice’s ability to assure that all of its patients are on an affordable medication regimen. Cultural sensitivity will be a key focus of 
practice facilitation training to assure that all of the activities undertaken by [CONTACT_792063] a 
culturally concordant manner.  
 
The current draft of the practice facilitation guide is appended in Appendix 7. 
 6.3.c Peer Coaches 
 
6.3.c.i Peer Coaching Intervention Development  
 
The peer coaching intervention is modeled on lifestyle and medication adherence interventions we have 
developed for diabetes in collaboration with community partners now spanning over [ADDRESS_1092039] that 93% of Encourage study participants chose to work on diet and exercise to improve their diabetes “numbers” rather 
than working on medication adherence. Responding to this request, the intervention includes chapters on 
healthy eating and exercise to enhance engagement. 
 
The intervention is developed iteratively in partnership with existing peer coaches. We draft key evidence-
based content elements for each chapter and our peer coaches provide feedback, which is then incorporated. 
We then create a full draft of the chapter and tape record the interaction between a mock peer coach and a patient. The peer coaches listen to the recording and view the fully developed chapter, and again provide 
feedback. They then practice with each other in pairs until they are ready to be certified on the chapter by 
[CONTACT_792064]. We repeat this process weekly until each peer coach has been certified; for an 8-session program, this takes about [ADDRESS_1092040] once per month for a full year.

 The interventions include engaging video presentations with visual images and few written words instead of 
didactics, and embed community members telling their perspectives and stories to personalize the intervention, 
and to incorporate Adult Learning Theory and Social Cognitive Theory. The educational material is presented 
on DVDs, since many community members do not have access to the internet. Participants are asked to watch the week’s chapter prior to their telephone call with the peer coach. During the call, they discuss the content of the video and the peer coach reinforces key points. The participant is given an activity book, and the peer 
coach has a peer coach manual and a client plan book, both of which are coordinated to facilitate the 
discussion (see Appendix 7 for examples of a chapter in an Activity Book and coordinated coaching manual from an ongoing study that will be adapted here). The participant is given homework at the conclusion of each 
session, which they track in their Activity Book and which is reviewed at the beginning of the next session. The 
peer coach helps the patient to set goals around self-management, including medications, home monitoring, and diet and exercise, and she helps the patient to strategize how to accomplish the goals, using motivational 
interviewing techniques. 
 
Peer coaches may also use the expanded mydiabetesconnect.com website developed at UAB to link their 
clients into community resources. An attractive feature of the website is the peer coach’s (or practice staff’s) 
ability to enter new resources or make corrections to existing listed resources, such as a change in hours or 
location. The website thus serves as a dynamic resource, constantly being updated by [CONTACT_578709]. NC also has 
web-based links to community services that will be emphasized as a resource during training. Furthermore, 
during the peer coach trainings, the peers as a group complete an asset mappi[INVESTIGATOR_791990]’s community. These are added to mydiabetesconnect.com. 
 
An important component of the peer coaching intervention is linking back to the practice about the patient’s 
progress. Each peer coach will meet the Practice Champi[INVESTIGATOR_791991]. Practice Champi[INVESTIGATOR_791992] a synopsis of the evidence supporting peer coaching interventions in HTN. Each practice will tailor their communication approach with 
peer coaches, whether by [CONTACT_792065], assuring timely communication of 
progress and issues that arise during the interactions between the patient and the coach. For example, if the patient discloses that they cannot afford the HTN medication regimen, the peer coach will notify the practiced 
through the agreed upon communication channel, and the physician will review the medications and 
recommend an affordable regimen that the peer coach then assures is received by [CONTACT_102]. The study provides a resource for medication price comparisons for practice staff through the PALS web portal. The coach reaches out to the practice every two weeks during the first 2 months, then monthly, using a structured 
form to report on progress. This form will include home BP readings, which will be used by [CONTACT_792066], reinforce educational messages, reinforce the importance of adherence to medications and lifestyle changes, and during the maintenance phase, they will use these measures to assess the need to 
intensify contacts if blood pressures begin to rise. 
 
6.3.d Hybrid Intervention: Practice Facilitation with Integrated Peer Coaches  
The [ADDRESS_1092042] information and encouraging the patient to keep follow-up 
appointments. For these reasons, it is likely that the combination of the two interventions – practice facilitation 
and peer coaching – will result in an intervention that is more than a simple sum of the two interventions.  
 Practice facilitators and peer coaches will receive the same training for this hybrid intervention, but the 
practice facilitator change packet will add examples of activities that integrate peer coaches such as those 
listed above.  
 
  
6.4 Training 
 6.4.a Facilitator Training  
We will certify facilitators using an AHRQ-funded certificate program available through the State University 
of [LOCATION_001] at Buffalo/Millard Fillmore College. This web-based program spans 13 weeks and includes 1.5 hours/week of webinars, plus [ADDRESS_1092043]’s facilitators, also serving as mentors for the AL AHEC program, which currently 
does not have any certified facilitators. AL facilitators will be part of the AHEC program, building a work force of 
facilitators for the state of AL, and laying the groundwork for a sustainable practice facilitation program. 
 
Once certified, facilitators receive additional training  to provide study-specific skills. They receive training 
on HTN and its treatments, become familiarized with the HTN treatment algorithm (Appendix 6), learn skills 
related to cultural sensitivity, and practice motivational interviewing skills. This training will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_792067] 40-hour practicum that the AL Practice facilitators 
will spend in NC with the NC AHEC team. An important objective of the in-person time spent in NC is to 
establish relationships with mentors who serve as a resource and support throughout the study period. Once trained, facilitators participate in biweekly calls to tr oubleshoot and brainstorm ideas. Practice fac ilitators also 
reach out to their mentors for ongoing help and advice.  
 6.4. b Peer Coach Training 
 
Peer coaches are trained using the programs we have developed in the course of our work in the Black 
Belt.
14,[ADDRESS_1092044] in-person and by [CONTACT_792068]. The goals of the training 
include: peers are confident to implement the program as designed, peers understand ethical obligations of being part of a research study team, and to establish an infrastructure for continued support and education for that clinic’s peer group. Peer coaches are certified for each of the first [ADDRESS_1092045] in community settings. We spend the day covering techniques of motivational interviewing 
and supportive counseling, with live modeling and ample opportunities for role-playing and practice. Coaches 
also learn how to use a BP home monitor. Certifications are scheduled to be completed over the phone after 
41 
 each training course, with opportunities for later telephone remediation for those coaches who do not meet 
minimum standards of motivational interviewing and supportive counseling.  
 
Training continues by [CONTACT_792069] a series of 
conference calls over 4 to 6 weeks. We provide basic information 
about HTN and its consequences, along with basic information on 
medications used to treat HTN along with common side effects and costs. We provide information on self-monitoring and the 
interpretation of BP readings. We familiarize the coaches with the 
same algorithm used in the practice facilitation intervention (Appendix 6), with instructions to reach out to the practice if they 
discover that the patient is not able to tolerate a new dose or newly 
added medication, or if the home BP is consistently above goal. The coaches learn common titration recommendations (e.g., double the dose of this medicine and then fill the new prescription 
at the pharmacy), allowing them to reinforce the plans with 
patients. Our discussions with practicing physicians during practice engagement have revealed that many 
patients have a great deal of difficulty with even the simplest medication titration instructions, and we will be 
sure that coaches understand how to follow these types of instructions.   
 We also teach the peer coaches about healthy eating using the plate method (Figure 9) and emphasizing a 
few key messages in the form of easily remembered “sound bites” (e.g., “respect the border” to reinforce 
portion size control by [CONTACT_792070]; “be sweet on yourself” to avoid sugar sweetened drinks; “one and done” to avoid second helpi[INVESTIGATOR_14839]). This simple approach resulted in weight loss in the Encourage study even though weight loss was not a specific goal of that study. We add specific 
lessons on lowering salt intake, and serve a buffet lunch so that coaches can immediately put into practice 
what they learned. We also have a post-prandial exercise session to reinforce learning about physical activity. We finish the afternoon by [CONTACT_792071], and practicing the first session using a 
buddy system and trainers that float between pairs, providing reinforcement of key skills. Coaches receive their 
manual and review the participant activity books and self-monitoring calendars.  See Appendix 8 for a peer 
coaching training manual that is being adapted for the present study. 
 
Since they are not healthcare professionals, peer coaches are often uncertain about their clients’ questions 
related to health, especially the numerous questions about medications. Therefore, coaches are trained on how to use the PALS, providing a resource for peer coach interactions with their clients designed to give them 
confidence in the reliability of the information they provide. As described above in section 6.3.b.i, the PALS is a 
web-based question-based system with evidence-based, referenced answers that covers basic facts about the pathophysiology of HTN, its long-term consequences, the medications used to treat HTN, and their cost and 
side effects. Answers are short, and when there is a need for didactics (e.g., “what is HTN?”), answers are in 
the form of engaging videos designed to encourage the viewer to watch the segment several times. The PALS will be made available to each practice on the laptop provided by [CONTACT_1758], with the intent of providing factually correct education material for the practice’s patients (and staff). The PALS is also available wherever there is 
an internet connection, thus its use as a resource for the peer coaches provides the opportunity to encourage 
wider use outside the healthcare setting.  
 
After the in-person trainings, coaches meet on weekly conference calls or by [CONTACT_792072], after which they practice the intervention at least twice, once playing the role of the patient and once of the coach. When they feel confident, they schedule a call with the research assistant, who 
plays the role of the patient, and the coach works through the session to become certified. Research assistants 
have the opportunity to reinforce skills over the course of this training program, which takes approximately 8-10 weeks to complete for an 8-session program and booster/maintenance sessions. 
 
The peer coach training is timed to finish close to the start of intervention delivery. This timing resulted from 
requests from the peer coaches to maximize their confidence in their ability to deliver the intervention as

peer coaching intervention

6.6.b Implementing the Interventions at the 80 Participating Practices  
 
6.6.b.i Implementation of Enhanced Usual Care  
At the time that patient recruitment starts at the practice, we will implement the enhanced usual care 
condition at all practices (see also section 6.3.a). Each practice will determine the best location for the laptop with the education system, along with a set of headphones for patient use. All practices will also receive a 
binder of practice tips, including the BP medication management algorithm (Appendix 6). All patient 
participants regardless of study arm will also receive a HPBM at the time of baseline data collection, and the research assistant will instruct each patient in its use.  
 
6.6.b.ii Practice Facilitation Intervention Implementation 
 
For practices randomized to receive the practice facilitation intervention arm, a practice facilitator will 
contact [CONTACT_792074]. 
The practice facilitator will meet with the practice face-to-face within [ADDRESS_1092047] 
Implementation Scale (KDIS). This tool serves dual purposes with roles during recruitment as part of the 
assessment of the practice’s ability to participate as well as during the intervention itself as a kind of barometer Y2       Y3    Y4

   [ADDRESS_1092048] with 
the Practice Champi[INVESTIGATOR_791993]’s transformation efforts. At each monthly visit, practice facilitators will assess the practice’s progress using the KDIS, and compare this assessment with the practice’s self-assessment. This comparison is designed to stimulate conversation, action 
planning, and build rapport. Both the practice facilitator assessment and the practice’s self-assessment serve 
as process measures for the intervention. 
 
The BP titration algorithm is a central focus of practice facilitator activities (Appendix 6). If patients are 
adherent with medications and lowering salt intake, BP can be controlled in upward of 80% of African American patients. However, many may not achieve a BP <140/90 mm Hg despi[INVESTIGATOR_791994]. In 
these cases, Drs. Oparil (in Alabama) will be consulted for tailored advice on medication titration. [CONTACT_614952] is 
a leading clinical trialist in the field of HTN, having served on the [ADDRESS_1092049] of practice facilitation is the management of change fatigue. The practice facilitator 
Collaboratory is designed to provide peer support among practices undergoing transformation.77-81 75-79 The 
practice facilitator Collaboratory is a biweekly conference calls with a short presentation from one of the 
practice facilitators discussing how they overcame barriers in collaboration with the Practice Champi[INVESTIGATOR_60099]/or 
team and succeeded at implementing the 4 key functions. Facilitators are partnered with experienced practice 
facilitator mentors from the NC AHEC, and they are encouraged to reach out to their mentors for help and 
advice. If needed, the study’s physician leaders may be asked to communicate with the practice team to 
provide advice as academic detailers, drawing on their collective experience with practice change interventions. The calls are recorded for those that miss a call. Others bring their challenges to the group for 
brainstorming. In addition to the conference calls, a study specific list serve is being used by [CONTACT_792075]; this messaging capability allows practice facilitation practices to share experiences and successful 
strategies for overcoming barriers. The Practice Facilitation lead investigator, [CONTACT_792136], and the AHEC point person, [CONTACT_792137], are available by [CONTACT_792076]-the-moment consultations. These support 
mechanisms serve as an important source of invigoration, overcoming change fatigue.  
  
6.6.b.iii Peer Coaching Intervention Implementation  
 
Practices assigned to the peer coaching intervention arm have a peer coach assigned to each recruited 
patient. The coaches meet the Practice Champi[INVESTIGATOR_791995]-to-face at the start of the coaching intervention, and 
they firm up communication plans. Peer coaches contact [CONTACT_792077] a structured form that may be placed in the patient’s record at the practice’s discretion. In between these monthly contacts, telephone contact [CONTACT_792078][INVESTIGATOR_791996]’s needs. 
 
At enrollment, each participant receiving the coaching intervention receives a packet with their DVD and 
activity book. We had originally planned to provide study phones to participants but were unable to do so due to financial constraints. All participants will be briefed on the availability of so-called ‘Obama phones’ that are 
available free of charge to individuals with low incomes. 
 
The peer coach contacts the participant within 2-[ADDRESS_1092050] high home blood pressure levels as well as reaching out to practice champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]. For 
patients who cannot be controlled despi[INVESTIGATOR_791997], Drs. Oparil and Viera will advise the practice on alternative approaches to achieving control on a case-by-case basis.  
 
Once the BP is consistently in the controlled range (or as controlled as possible after guidance provided by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Oparil), contacts become less frequent. Coaches are asked to contact [CONTACT_792079]. Should BP 
become uncontrolled, contacts are intensified with reassessment of medication and dietary adherence and 
outreach to the practice for medication titration or medical management, including an additional office visit as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_792080]. The coach assists the client in making arrangements to 
keep any appointments at the practice. Weekly contacts are maintained until the BP is controlled or as 
controlled as possible, where after contacts are again made less frequently, at least once per month until the 
end of the intervention period.  
[ADDRESS_1092051] successful in driving change. The potential change drives and their 
associated outcomes are shown in Table 13. Each of these data elements and the frequency and timing of their assessment is discussed in 
more detail in this section.

assessed in the practices by a trained, quality controlled research assistant following 
standardized protocols guided by 
[CONTACT_792081]. The protocol for these assessments is 
shown in Appendix 10.  
 To measure the BP, the 
research assistant first measures the upper arm to determine the appropriate cuff size. The participant is 
seated with both feet on the ground and asked to rest for 5 minutes prior to assessing the BP using an Omron 
IntelliSense™  digital BP machine. Two measures are taken and the second is used for analyses. Height and 
weight are assessed using a digital scale and a stadiometer.  All research assistants use identical equipment 
for data collection.  
 BP, height, and weight will be assessed at baseline. BP and weight will also be assessed at the 6-month 
follow-up and the 12-month follow-up.  
  
7.3 Patient survey  
 
Quality of life and patient satisfaction are assessed as part of the study’s secondary outcomes. These 
measures meet PCORI Methodology Standard 2:PC-[ADDRESS_1092052] source of information. Where available, 
we use validated instruments with acceptable psychometric properties in the targeted population (Appendix 10) 
The use of validated instruments meets  PCORI Methodology Standard 3: IR-4 (Document validated scales 
and tests  - Studies should include documentation of the name [CONTACT_792132], reference(s), 
characteristics of the scale, and psychometric properties).
1 The instruments included in the patient survey are 
shown in Table 14.  Two questions related to the gender and race of the patient’s primary care provider were 
added to the survey. 
 
Minimizing participant burden is a major emphasis in pragmatic trials. In this study, one of the interventions 
acts through relationships, which can only be assessed through participant report. Further, health behaviors 
are targeted, which are poorly documented in medical records. In our past work we have learned that 
community members value programs targeted at CVD risk reduction that include diet, exercise and stress reduction, thus they are included here.

We recognize that several of the proposed domains are not ideally assessed using brief self-reported 
measures, specifically diet, physical activity, and healthcare services utilization. However, given the pragmatic 
trial context and the main interest in BP, we use brief measures that have been widely implemented in well-
established surveys, minimizing participant burden. Health services utilization has been shown to be reliably assessed through patient report when the interval being assessed is shorter than one year.

If the interview cannot be completed in person, the interview is administered by a research assistant on the 
telephone shortly after the data collection visit in the practice. Research assistants are trained and certified for cultural sensitivity and interviews are recorded for quality control. The elements of the survey collected at 
baseline, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up are also shown in Table 14. The steps to completing the 
6-month and 12-month interviews with enrolled patients are listed below:   7.3.a Completion of 6-month and 12-month interviews with enrolled patients  
 
All enrolled patients will be contact[CONTACT_51095]-up interviews at approximately 6 and 12 months after their 
date of consent.  
 
a. The ‘gold standard’ for all interviews is a ‘face-to face’ meeting where the patient’s BP and weight are 
assessed by [CONTACT_432740]. 
 
b. In special circumstances, data collectors will be allowed to conduct a follow-up survey over the 
telephone, but the patient must meet a data collector and have their BP and weight assessed to receive the $[ADDRESS_1092053] info, and to strategize on 
how to reach these difficult patients. 
iv. If you reach patient: emphasize the $[ADDRESS_1092054] follow-up visits via phone/Zoom to complete the surveys. We also obtained IRB approval to allow participants to 
assess their blood pressure at home at the time of the survey and we recorded those values, but these 
values will not be used in analyses  
7.3.b Timing of interviews 
The schedule for completing interviews is shown in Table 14A and Figure 11.   
a. To complete a 6-month interview on time , conduct the interviews within [ADDRESS_1092055] the interviews within 30 days before or 60 days 
after the date 12 months after informed consent. Note that the 12-month interview is due 12 months 
from the consent date – not six months after the 6-month interview date. 
 
c. Interviews can still be conducted up to [ADDRESS_1092056] their time window should be prioritized to complete late 12-month 
interviews over completing 6-month interviews if resources are too scarce to permit completion of both.

6-Month Follow-Up Within 30 days before and 30 days after 6-month target date 
12-Month Follow-Up Within 30 days before and 60 days after the 12-Month target Date  
*Target date for the interview is determined by [CONTACT_792082]  +6 months for 6-month follow-up or +12 months for 12-
month follow-up. See Figure 11. 
 
 
Figure 11. Ascertainment of windows for follow-up data collection.  
 
For all unreachable patients, Program Managers should be notified.  Program Managers will help strategize 
and change the patient status in ClinvestiGator  to either “non-responsive,” “lost to follow-up,” or “dropped out” . 
The ClinvestiGator  scheduling report automatically calculates interview due dates, and color codes them when 
they are ‘do-able.’  
 
For example, for a patient consented on January 1, the official 6-month mark is July 1 and the official 12-
month mark is January 1 of the following year.   
a. Six month ‘ON TIME’ can be completed as early as June [ADDRESS_1092057] 1. 
b. Six month ‘LATE’ can be completed as late as September 1.   
c. Twelve month ‘ON TIME’ can be completed as early as December 1 and as late as February 1. 
d. Twelve month ‘LATE’ can be completed as late as March 1. 
 
 7.3.c Participant Follow-up Phone Call Attempts 
 
Recognizing that there are constraints on available resources, this section provides guidance on the 
number of calls made to a participant to schedule a follow-up study visit. Up to 15 calling attempts will be made 
for each phone number in the sample. These attempts should be made at various times to increase the 
chances of reaching the participant. For example, 20% of surveys have been completed on weekdays and 
80% on week nights and weekends. Changing the schedule to accommodate holidays and special events is an important strategy. Make weekday calls just after the dinner hour. Make appointment callbacks during hours 
that are not scheduled for other interviews, generally on weekdays.  
 7.3.d Text Messaging   
 
Text messaging is available in ClinvestiGator  for research assistants to assist with follow up scheduling 
and reminders, as well as retention messages. Text messages can be sent from the patient data base in 
ClinvestiGator  with responses recorded within the database to track correspondences. The text messaging 
option is available to all sites under the guidance of the program managers. This is not a requirement but is 
available as an additional resource if desired. The two main purposes of text messaging are:  

49 
 1.  To remind study participants of their upcoming 6 or 12 month follow up appointments to reduce the 
number of “no show” for follow up visits. The approved verbiage is:  
 “You have a UAB visit at [Practice name] tomorro w, [date], at [time]. Call xxxxxxxxx for questions” OR 
   “You have a UAB visit today at [Pract ice name], at [time]. Call xxxxxxxxx for questions”. 
 
2.  To inform study participants in the peer coach arm to expect a phone call from their peer coach. 
Messages include the peer coach’s name, cell phone # (xxx)xxx-xxxx, and the date/time of the 
scheduled call. Participant are more likely to answer the peer coach’s initial contact, if they know the 
number in advance to avoid confusing the call with telemarketing. The intent of this text message is to 
improve participant compliance with the Peer Coaching intervention.  The peer coach cell phones are 
UAB owned. The proposed verbiage is “[name], your peer coach, will call you on [date], at [time] from 
this #: xxx-xxx-xxxx.” 
 
Text messaging will only apply to newly enrolled patients who have read the communications study page 
and gave permission to be contact[CONTACT_792083] [ADDRESS_1092058], 
this communication page will be added to the consent form as an additional page.  
 
Study staff will use the approved verbiage that is embedded in the system to send an alert message from 
the data system and not from  an actual cell phone. 
 
The day of consent: 
1- Make copi[INVESTIGATOR_791999] 
2- Help patient understand it and ask them to initial where indicated (whether yes or no) 3- Enter or update the patient cell phone number at the time of enrollment in the contact [CONTACT_792084] a mobile phone. 
4- Once you do that, a box will appear next to the mobile phone # to include the carrier name (i.e, AT&T, 
Verizon, Sprint……etc.). Enter the carrier name (the carrier name [CONTACT_792133][INVESTIGATOR_792000]). Without the carrier name, a text message can’t be sent.  
 
How to send an alert text message: Go to the patient data base¡ select your patient¡ go to Reports ¡ 
select “send text message via email” report¡ confirm that your patient is selected in the box¡ select approved verbiage¡ update phone number and the peer name [CONTACT_792134]¡ send. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_1092059] Derived Data 
 
Medical records are abstracted for the following data at baseline and follow-up: 
 
• Health insurance  
• Medical conditions  
o Renal function (eGFR, creatinine, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio) 
o Chronic medical diagnoses that are part of the Charlson comorbidity index 
• Medications (name, dose, frequency) 
• Titration of antihypertensive medications in the past year 
• Number of in-office encounters (including outreach and case management efforts by [CONTACT_517533]) 
• Number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792001] 
• Emergency Department (ED) utilization, and telephone outreach 
• For patients at practices randomized to the peer coaching arm: number of peer coaching chart entries 
 
These data are abstracted using a structured abstraction form on the study’s web-based data entry system. 
Abstractors will be trained and certified and quality controlled to assure >95% reliability.
63,83-[ADDRESS_1092060] 3:IR-[ADDRESS_1092061] of care. However, 
although no novel treatments are being tested, we recognize that the efforts to lower BP to <140/[ADDRESS_1092062] (DSMB). 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, 
including any clinically significant abnormal sign (for example, abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research. The burden of collecting and reporting data on every possible AE in this trial would require a great deal of effort, therefore all serious adverse events will be 
reported, and selected non-serious adverse events will be reported. 
Consistent with NHLBI guidelines and OHRP policy, adverse events are events that meet any of the 
following criteria: 
• Fatal 
• Life-threatening (immediate risk of death from the event) 
• Result in significant or persistent disability 
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908] 
• Important medical events that investigators judge to represent significant hazards or harm to 
research participants and may require medical or survival intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], death, persistent disability) 
Any event that meets any of these criteria will be documented and reported as a serious adverse event.

In reports to DSMB, all events will be reported, and a separate assessment will be made whether they are 
considered related or not related to the trial interventions. For DSMB reports, self-report of a stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, side effects, falls, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and ER visits will be combined with data from 
chart review.  
All laboratory values found to be outside the safety range will be brought to the attention of the primary 
care office staff. Adverse events should only be documented in the 6 month and 12 month follow-up at the time 
that all 6 month and 12 month follow-up data are collected for a participant. The only exceptions are as follows:  
• Participant dies  
• Participant withdraws from the study and their reason for withdrawing was an adverse event (example, 
had a stroke or MI).  
For these participants both a withdrawal and an adverse event form should be completed.   7.6 Process Data  
 
7.6.a Process Measures for the Peer Coaching 
Intervention 
 
The study has several sources of data that will be used to 
assess the peer coaching intervention dose and fidelity: cell 
phones, peer coach manuals, monitored interactions, and 
participant report through both spot checks and survey at final followup, as shown in Table 16. Each of these are described in greater detail in the following section. 
 
7.6.a.i Cell Phone Data 
 
Peer coaches will be provided cell phones to collect data on intervention dose. Cell phone data include the 
telephone number of ingoing and outgoing calls, as well as minutes per call. These data are used to total the minutes spent on the telephone for each session and the number of total telephone contacts between peer coach and client as a measure of intervention dose. In addition, minutes spent in contact [CONTACT_792085], providing a measure of intervention fidelity related to frequency of contacts with the 
practice. 
 
These data will be entered into the study’s web-based data collection system. 
 7.6.a.ii Peer Coach Manual Derived Data 
 
Peer coaches use a paper manual for each participant designed for multiple purposes: 
 1) A practical tool for coaches to document details about each client that is used over the course of the 
intervention (such as contact [CONTACT_3031], personal goals, etc.) 
2) A tool to enhance intervention fidelity Table 16. Measures of peer coaching

 3) A tool for process data collection 
 
A copy of a chapter of the manual and client Activity Book are provided in Appendix 7. The coach has a 
separate manual for each client and records process data such as: 
• Completion of each session 
• Goal setting, including advancing the goal over time 
• Adherence to self-monitoring, including home BP monitoring 
• Medication adherence and barriers to medication adherence 
• Adherence to low salt diet, physical activity, stress reduction 
• Clinic outreach frequency and outcome 
• Use of community resources 
• Timing and frequency of booster contacts when BP becomes uncontrolled 
 Manuals are collected at the conclusion of the 1-year intervention period and data will be abstracted into a 
form on the study’s web-based data collection system by [CONTACT_792086]. 
 7.6.a.iii Monitored Telephone Interactions 
 
Intervention fidelity will be assessed by [CONTACT_792087]. 
These sessions will be monitored by [CONTACT_792088], and to retrain coaches if necessary. 
 
7.6.a.iv Participant Satisfaction: Spot Checks and Survey at Follow-up 
 
Two strategies are implemented to assess intervention fidelity based on participant report. First, study 
personnel will make random telephone contacts with participants in the peer coaching intervention arms and assess whether all intervention sessions are being delivered in timely fashion, and also whether the coach is 
being supportive and helpful. Second, the final follow-up participant survey includes questions assessing 
satisfaction with interactions with the peer coach for those participants receiving the peer coaching intervention.  
 
7.6.b Process Measures for the Practice Facilitation Intervention 
 
The process data to be collected to assess intervention fidelity are shown in Table 17. There are measures 
of intervention dose as well as degree of intervention implementation, described next.  
 
7.6.b.i Measures of Intervention Dose 
 
Practice facilitators track frequency of contacts on forms 
that are part of the study’s web-based data collection 
system. These forms serve the dual purpose of allowing the 
practice facilitator to track contacts across multiple practices 
in their caseload and to allow assessment of intervention dose. The total number and type (telephone brief and 
extended follow-up, in-person) of contacts is captured. 
 
7.6.b.ii Measures of the Degree of Intervention Implementation 
 
 A practice assessment tool is used to assess intervention implementation monthly by [CONTACT_792089]. The tool is filled out by [CONTACT_792090]’s web-based data collection system. Separate sections assess the progress of the practice’s transformation in relation to the [ADDRESS_1092063]. Halladay called the Key Driver Implementation Scale (KDIS) which is adapted for the present study and focused on HTN.
37 The adaptation of this tool has been finalized through collaboration with the NC Table 17. Measures of practice facilitation

 AHECs and the AHRQ materials on practice facilitation. In brief, the KDIS assesses progress by [CONTACT_792091], team engagement, use of clinical information systems, standardized care processes, and self-
management support (see Appendix 11). Sections on use of outreach and telephone management are being 
added for this project.  
 In addition, practice facilitators will track specific activities being implemented under each of the 4 key 
functions. Below, we provide some examples of the types of activities the practices may engage in. The facilitator will enter the specific activities into the study data system monthly, along with a qualitative 
assessment of the current stage of implementation (e.g., planning, early implementation, evaluation, etc.). 
 
1) Self-management support 
• Implement a process for using home BP monitors for patients with uncontrolled HTN 
• Implement education on dietary salt restriction in a culturally concordant manner (i.e., use 
customized dietary advice that incorporates the kinds of foods local people eat) 
• Assess medication adherence systematically at every visit 
• Implement a process for supportively helpi[INVESTIGATOR_792003] 
(such as finding the cheapest pharmacy, or switching to a more affordable regimen) 
 
2) Use of the electronic record for population health management (Clinical Information Systems/Outreach)  
• Create a registry of HTN patients in the practice 
• Create a report identifying patients who are overdue for an encounter 
• Create a report of the practice’s HTN control rate, by [CONTACT_113215] 
 
3) Team-based management 
• Implement a protocol for BP titration carried out by a non-physician 
• Implement standing orders for BP titration, laboratory tests, recall appointments 
• Implement processes that permit non-physicians to provide self-management support 
• Implement systematic assessment of medication adherence and barriers to medication 
adherence completed by [CONTACT_105]-physician staff member 
 
4) Standardized Care Processes 
• Work with practices to reach out to HTN patients who have not been seen recently 
• Work with practices to use the medication algorithm to guide medical decision making for their 
patients, specifically their AA population with uncontrolled HTN 
• Implement telephonic BP medication titration based on home BP measures 
• Implement protocol to use reports from the electronic record to recall patients who are overdue 
for visits 
  
It is not expected that each practice implement all possible activities under each key function. However, it is 
expected that each practice attempt to implement at least one activity under each function over the one-year 
intervention period.  
 As discussed above, it is expected that it will take up to [ADDRESS_1092064] get to know one another with ice 
breaker activities. At the next visit, the facilitator and staff members complete the practice self-assessment 
consisting of the KDIS (Appendix 11). They discuss the results and begin to learn basics of quality 
improvement including plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles. Th e first activity centers on using the practice’s data 
to assess their current performance.  The facilitator helps the practice to plan for how to obtain the data, whether from the electronic record or from a limited chart review of [ADDRESS_1092065] systems now include the ability to create registries and create reports such as 
on the practice’s HTN control, but staff often have not had the time to learn how to create such reports. This is 
the role of the facilitator. The facilitator will teach the practice how to estimate their population-level BP control rate by [CONTACT_792092]. Ideally, PDSA cycles would use 30-day 
denominators for estimating population-level BP control rates to assess the success of the QI intervention. 
54 
 However, by [CONTACT_792093], the PF’s work with the practices to use any data that is relevant 
to testing if their changes result in improvement, for instance if barriers to appropriate BP measurement are 
lessened over time, the PDSA data may simply reflect survey data from staff quantifying barriers monthly. Such barriers can include, but are not limited to, broken equipment, lack of right sized cuffs, physical environment not conductive to appropriate patient positions, and others. It may prove difficult in many practices 
to do this without some chart review due to challenges with customizing the data reports available in the EHR. 
Therefore, facilitators will teach practices to identify all patients with HTN (based on ICD-10 codes) seen in the past 30 days. If there are sufficient numbers (90 or more), a random sample of the [ADDRESS_1092066] 
recorded BP. If there are not sufficient numbers (<90), the last [ADDRESS_1092067] PDSA cycle. The firs t activity is carefully selected to be particularly achievable to let the 
practice achieve momentum. The facilitator documents these plans and then contacts the practice Champi[INVESTIGATOR_792004]. The facilitator 
visits the practice in-person monthly, with telephone contacts in between. All contacts are recorded and the 
facilitator completes the KDIS in the study’s data system which includes a graph of BP control data over time 
that can be shared with the practice as part of their QI work. 
 As the practice makes progress, the facilitator assists the practice in selecting another improvement 
activity, encouraging them to eventually select at leas t one activity under each key function. Activities are 
evaluated as part of the PDSA cycles, and adjustments are made until the new process is deemed successful 
and ready for permanent implementation. The facilitator helps the practice to keep adding new activities under each function and documents progress for a total of [ADDRESS_1092068] weekly calls between visits.  
 
 Practice facilitation will be assessed using questions that query general satisfaction with participation, workload, acceptance by [CONTACT_517533], difficulty in carrying out their expected duties, and support by [CONTACT_792094].  
 
7.6.c Measures of Practice Satisfaction 
 
Practices that receive either the practice facilitation or coaching interventions (or both) will be asked to 
complete an assessment of their satisfaction with the interventions. For practice facilitation, this will consist of the Practice Facilitation Provider Satisfaction Survey, recently used in a statewide program evaluation in 
Oklahoma (see Appendix 12). 
 7.6.d Measures of Peer Coach Satisfaction  
 Peer coach satifaction will be assessed using a set of questions used in several past studies that assess 
domains related to support from the coordinators, peer-to-peer mentoring, and ease of communication with the practices as well as how well the coach felt integrated into the practice team. See Appendix 16. 
 
7.6.e Measures of Practice Facilitator Satisfaction 
 
 Practice facilitation will be assessed using questions that query general satisfaction with participation, 
workload, acceptance by [CONTACT_517533], difficulty in carrying out their expected duties, and support by [CONTACT_792094].   
7.6.f Baseline Population-level BP Control Rates 
 
[ADDRESS_1092069] control rates <30%. FQHC’s report higher rates, in some areas as high as 60%. Because practices with 
very low control rates may be more sensitive to intervention effects, we will attempt to estimate baseline population-level BP control rates in the practice’s hypertensive patients for each practice separately. These values will not be used in the main analyses for the study since we will not be able to collect these data in a 
rigorous enough fashion to support more than exploratory analyses. Nevertheless, this will be a highly 
informative view of small private practice-level control rates in the heart of the Stroke Belt’s rural areas, to our knowledge the first in the state of Alabama, as reflected in the Alabama State Department of Health’s request 
to share these estimates as they accrue (advice offered at February [ADDRESS_1092070] 
meeting).    
 In order to obtain these rates, we will first request the past year’s HTN control rate, which may or may not 
be readily available in EHRs. Ideally we will examine the practice-level control rate in the [ADDRESS_1092071] patient recruited at the practice. Preliminary experience indicates this may not be available at many practices. In this case, the practice’s billing and scheduling databases will be queried for a list of all HTN 
patients seen in the [ADDRESS_1092072] patient’s recruitment, using ICD-[ADDRESS_1092073] a random number n from the range (rounded to the whole number) {[D/30] + .1*D}. Every n
th 
patient chart will be reviewed for the last BP recorded until [ADDRESS_1092074] been reviewed. The formula assures that the sample includes patients seen over the entire course of the year. The BP control rate will be calculated automatically in the study’s data system. 
  
 We considered whether to limit these population-level control rates to just African American patients, 
concordant with the emphasis of this study. However, race data are so incompletely captured in these practices’ data systems and medical records that this proved unfeasible. Therefore, population-level control 
rates will be estimated for this purpose on the practice’s entire patient population with diagnosed HTN seen 
over the prior year.  
7.6.g  Collection of Home BP Data at 6-Month and 12-Month Follow-up Visits  
 
All participants in the Southeastern Collaboration Study are asked to use a home BP monitor provided by 
[CONTACT_792095], and are asked to record home BP in logs provided at enrollment, the 6-month, and the 12-month follow-up. While they are not to be used for the main analyses of the study, these data have multiple other uses to our study team, the practice facilitators and coaches, and to practice personnel.  
The research assistants will program each new home BP monitor with the time and date before giving the 
monitor to a patient. This will facilitate accurate retrieval of data over the study period.  
7.6.g.i To program the BP cuff: 
1. Hold down the SET button (with the people and clock) until the year flashes at the bottom of the screen. 
Use the up and down arrows to select the year. 
2. Push SET again to switch to date. Use the up and down arrows to select, hitting SET to switch between 
month and day. 
3. Push SET again to switch to time. Use the up and down arrows to select the hour. Push SET to switch 
between hour and minute. 
4. Hit SET a final time to complete setup. 
7.6.g.ii Collecting BP data at six and twelve-month interviews 
1. REMIND : Remind patients coming in for 6-month and 12-month follow-up visits to BRING WITH THEM 
their home BP monitor, and/or their home BP logs. 
2. Scan/Copy/Secure Fax: If the patient brings in paper home BP logs, please obtain a copy. The 
method used will vary by [CONTACT_792096]. As always, treat patient information as confidential, and secure it in a HIPAA compliant manner.    
56 
 3. UPLOAD: Once back at your university site, please upload the monitor data and/or scanned images 
into a computerized file. Please make sure that there is a patient ID associated with each set of home BP measurements. 
4. REPORT:  Share with the program manager that you have collected this home BP data and uploaded it. 
We will utilize work study students or others to enter this data into ClinvestiGator  or other database. 
7.[ADDRESS_1092075] qualitative data from all study participants – patients, coaches, 
practice facilitators, primary care practitioners, and practice staff to learn their perspectives on the 
interventions. We will develop discussion guides including participant perspectives on what went well and what did not go as well, in addition to their recommendations for long-term implementation and scale-up. These data 
will be collected via discussion groups as well as semi-structured interviews as detailed next (see also 
Appendix 15).  
 
7.7.a Patients 
 
We will conduct semi-structured individual interviews with patients in each of years [ADDRESS_1092076] patients, assuring that we include 
men and individuals aged <60 years in the focus groups. For patients who participated in practices that 
received practice facilitation, we will include their qualitative impressions of the changes in the practice 
structure and how well they believe these changes improved their experience of care. For patients who worked 
with a peer coach, we will include their qualitative impressions of working with a peer coach, both positive and 
negative, and their opi[INVESTIGATOR_792005] a coach for a longer period of time, and how well telephone interactions met their needs and expectations (see Appendix 15). 
 
Program managers at each site will work with their study team to determine which study team member will 
administer the interviews. Most will be administered at the time of the 12-month follow-up by [CONTACT_17033], but to reduce respondent burden, some may be administered within [ADDRESS_1092077] up to 5 participants at each practice for these 
interviews, aiming to achieve similar demographic composition as the study’s overall sampling strategy to obtain insights from sufficient numbers of men and younger patients. Data will be entered into ClinvestiGator .  
 
7.7.b Providers and Practice Staff  
As with patients, we will survey the Practice Champi[INVESTIGATOR_792006] 4 and 5 of the study to obtain their perspectives on the interventions (see 
Appendix 15). The survey is designed for self-administration and includes open-ended questions. Only 
practices that received the intervention will be surveyed. Both provider and staff interviews are distributed via 
paper surveys for self-administration, and the data are entered into ClinvestiGator  on receipt of the completed 
survey at the respective university.  
 
7.7.b.i Post Intervention Survey Implementation  
 
The survey should be fielded approximately [ADDRESS_1092078] consent, not the duration of recruitment.  
 
There may be differences in how the survey is implemented according to intervention arm. In Practice 
Facilitation practices, the Practice Facilitator will notify the site’s program manager via email after the last 
intervention session has occurred and provide the names and contact [CONTACT_792097]. The Practice 
Facilitator will recommend the most involved person, but in some practices, there may be more than one 
[ADDRESS_1092079] been identified by [CONTACT_792098]. These names will be forwarded by [CONTACT_792099]’s program manager for survey administration. 
 
The program manager will send out the survey to the identified personnel at each site and be responsible 
for collecting completed surveys within [ADDRESS_1092080] recruited participant to 365 days after this date. 
The survey will be administered at any time after that date. The intervention period for the Peer Coaching 
intervention is determined by [CONTACT_792100]’s consent date, thus if recruitment is prolonged, the intervention period may be longer than [ADDRESS_1092081] participant’s enrollment to add [ADDRESS_1092082] intervention Semi-Structured Interview Brief Survey and Guide About Practice Facilitation 
was added. This will be complete among Practice Champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458] (see Appendix 12).  
 
7.7.c Peer Coaches 
 
We will have monthly meetings with peer coaches throughout the study period, actively seeking their 
feedback on implementation challenges in an ongoing fashion. We will conduct debriefing discussions with the 
peer coaches in year [ADDRESS_1092083] semi-structured interviews with 
a sample of intervention Practice Champi[INVESTIGATOR_792007]. These interviews will also serve to obtain further insights now that the 
intervention period is more remote. We anticipate that the practice facilitation intervention will result in lasting 
changes at the practice, therefore the sustainability of this intervention is likely to be high. We will ascertain whether practices moved on to NCQA recognition, and if so, which level they achieved. We will ask whether 
further improvements in their patient population’s BP control have been observed in the interim since the last 
data collection was completed.  
 
For the coaching intervention, we anticipate that ACA-related changes may have resulted in wider 
implementation of peer coaching in practices serving communities with a high prevalence of poverty, thus for 
[ADDRESS_1092084] been previously field tested. Second, we create checklists for data collection that 
guide data collectors through the protocol to assure adherence; these checklists are closely monitored with 
appropriate action taken for protocol deviations. Third, the web-based data entry systems have built-in range and quality checks, minimizing the entry of erroneous data. These systems also have robust reporting capabilities, permitting data collectors and their supervisors to track which participant is due for which type of 
follow-up to assure the timely collection of data. Fourth, we monitor the quality of data collected in the field 
through monitoring at the data coordinating center located at Weill Cornell, reaching out to field-based 
research assistants in near real-time to correct problems identified through monitoring (see also section 9). 
Last, we send two research assistants to the same site  to conduct site quality checks (e.g., monitor protocol 
adherence) for 5% of the field data collection days. Quality issues are addressed through retraining and recertification as needed. 
 
 
A major threat to data quality is low retention for the final follow-up, a problem that has challenged several 
studies in similar low income, minority settings, achieving 1-year retention in the 60-65% range.87-[ADDRESS_1092085] 
achieved 85-95% retention in our studies using several strategies. Perhaps most effective is the use of trained 
community members to assist with outreach to participants. We ask for at least [ADDRESS_1092086] 3:IR-3,  
which states that plans for data analysis should be specified a priori and should be designed to correspond to 
the major aims of the study.

8.2 Preliminary Analyses and Data Summaries 
 
All analyses will begin by [CONTACT_792101], and outcomes (e.g., HTN control and BP at both the patient and practice levels). Smoothed 
bivariate plots will be used to examine unadjusted pairwise associations between variables and variability 
among stages of the trial and over time throughout the trial’s duration. Particular attention will be paid to assessing whether distributions appear to be approximately normal within each study group and whether there 
appear to be any secular trends, conspi[INVESTIGATOR_792008], or outlying observations. We will use 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) (potentially with rank-transformation if non-parametric tests are needed) and 
distribution-appropriate bivariate tests for pairwise and overall differences between and among study groups in baseline characteristics. Preliminary analyses will be shared with the DSMB as required by [CONTACT_456]. 
 
 
8.[ADDRESS_1092087] of receiving both interventions will not be additive. For this reason, this trial can be better understood as a four-
arm trial testing three interventions versus a single control group. While the traditional analysis of a factorial 
trial would assume the absence of an interaction (which it would likely be under-powered to detect) and proceed to test main effects, the presence of even a moderate interaction considerably reduces to power to 
detect main effects, even when the effect in the group receiving both interventions is larger than for either 
group receiving a single intervention. However, in this case there will be more than adequate power to detect the larger effect in the group receiving both interventions compared to the enhanced usual care control. The 
analysis plan and design have taken this into account to ensure adequate statistical power for bivariate tests of 
main effects between each the three intervention groups and the enhanced usual care group (control). All analyses will be intention-to-treat. 
 
In this RCT, one of the interventions acts at the practice level (PF) and the other at the patient level (PC). 
Nevertheless, the outcome of interest is patient-level hypertension control. Therefore the main analysis will be at the individual patient level with appropriate modeling to account for the clustering of patients within 
practices. Recognizing that some experts recommend a practice-level analysis when the intervention operates 
at the practice level, secondary analyses will be done with practice-level data. The main hypothesis is that the proportion of patients with controlled hypertension will differ among study groups when analyzed without 
adjustment for covariates with the individual as the unit of analysis. Recognizing the stepped nature of the 
study implementation (see Figure 9), further analyses will also consider adjustment for baseline measures and secular trends. Patient-level analysis will have greater sample size, allowing for much more precise analyses and consideration of heterogeneity of effects among subgroups. For each patient-level analysis we will 
estimate the intra-class correlation (ICC) of patient-level measures within practices. If they are negligible (both 
statistically insignificant with point estimate <0.01), main patient-level hypothesis tests can proceed in the 
60 
 same fashion as the practice-level analysis. If ICCs are non-negligible, unadjusted testing will use regression 
accounting for clustering with generalized estimating equations (GEE) or random effects but with adjustment 
for a limited number of baseline covariates such as age and baseline systolic blood pressure. All further 
patient-level analyses will use distribution-appropriate regression models (linear regression, generalized linear models, or generalized additive models) with additional covariates in addition to accounting for clustering within 
practices. Secondary parallel analyses will be conducted using the practices as the unit of analysis. Although 
likely to have less power, these analyses will not require accounting for clustering and will therefore have fewer assumptions, Unless otherwise specified, all statistical tests will be two-sided, and a p<0.05 will be considered 
to be significant. The analyses described in detail below are specific to changes in the rates of controlled HTN 
at the practice and patient levels. Analyses of all other endpoints will be carried out in parallel form, but with distribution-appropriate tests and regression models. All analyses will be intention-to-treat, regardless of 
intervention fidelity, intensity, and dose. 
  8.4 Testing the Main Hypotheses 
 
By [CONTACT_792102]/multi-arm design, this study will provide evidence for the efficacy of three separate 
interventions, practice facilitation, peer coaching and an integrated hybrid intervention incorporating both 
compared the enhanced usual care control. The main analyses will consider the patient-level outcome of Stage 
2 hypertension control (<140/90 mm Hg) at the 12-month follow-up.  
 
There is thus a single primary hypothesis: that there will be statistically significant differences in rates of 
hypertension control among the study groups using logistic regression with adjustment for a limited number of baseline covariates such as age and baseline systolic blood pressure, and accounting for clustering using generalized estimating equations (GEE).  
 
If the omnibus test is significant, we will proceed to identify which interactions had significant effects, 
testing three subsidiary hypotheses, one for each intervention:  
 
1) that patients in practices randomized to practice facilitation have higher levels of hypertension control at 
one year than patients in practices randomized to enhanced usual care (EUC);  
2) patients in practices randomized to peer coaching will have higher levels of hypertension control at one 
year than patients in practices randomized to EUC; and  
3) that patients in practices randomized to both interventions will have higher levels of hypertension control 
at one year than patients in practices randomized to EUC.  
 
Because patient-level Stage [ADDRESS_1092088] for differences in the proportion of hypertension control between study groups with 
p<0.[ADDRESS_1092089] p-
values, we will also report p-values adjusted for the multiple comparisons using Dunnett’s method.  
 
 
8.5 Patient-Level Analyses 
 All additional unadjusted tests for differences between pairs of study groups will use the Benjamini-
Hochburg approach to control the false-discovery rate at 0.05.  These planned comparisons are1) practice 
facilitation vs. peer coaching, 2) practice facilitation alone vs. the hybrid intervention; and 3) peer coaching vs. the hybrid intervention.   
Having performed the unadjusted analyses we will proceed through several more nuanced analyses 
accounting for particular characteristics of this trial. First, we will repeat the analyses above using linear 
61 
 regression to estimate intervention effects adjusting for patients’ baseline systolic blood pressure to reduce 
variance. We will then include terms representing secular trends, and time from baseline to follow-up of 
patients within each practice. Finally, we will use generalized additive models to explore whether any observed relationships are nonlinear in a statistically meaningful way.   
 
Additional patient level analyses will allow us to use data observed at all time points as well as a much 
more granular analysis of moderating factors and differential efficacy among subgroups of patients. Two sets of patient-level analyses will proceed in parallel, one examining hypertension control as a dichotomous 
outcome (the primary outcome), and the other considering systolic BP as a continuous outcome. Patient-level 
analysis of hypertension control will use logistic regression accounting for clustering as described above. Initial 
analyses will proceed by [CONTACT_792103]. Generalized additive mixed 
models will be used to model the outcomes over time to test for non-linear trends while accounting for the 
clustering of patients within groups and multiple observations per patient. If no evidence for nonlinear trends is seen, generalized linear models will be used in subsequent steps. Further analyses will include indicators for 
phase of the trial and calendar time as well as patient-level factors of explicit interest such as baseline SBP, 
practice type, age, literacy, depression, and gender.    
 
8.[ADDRESS_1092090] likely to be successful. These analyses will be carried out at the patient level. Whether or not there is a significant difference between the group receiving the 
hybrid intervention vs. either alone, we will also be able to explore which of the three interventions is more 
effective for specific patient subgroups. The large number of patients will also allow us to examine this differential effectiveness within and between interventions by [CONTACT_792104] (e.g. low 
literacy) and through analyses stratified by [CONTACT_41396]. The explicitly planned subgroup analyses include 
stratification by [CONTACT_547], health literacy (as measured by [CONTACT_792105]), depressive symptoms (as assessed by [CONTACT_127659]8), and age dichotomized as <60 vs. ≥ 60 years.  An additional patient-level heterogeneity analysis will 
consider an interaction term between each patient’s SBP and the intervention group. 
 
We will formally conduct separate pre-specified heterogeneity of effects among practices by [CONTACT_792106], practice size, and mean practice-level SBP of participants at baseline. These heterogeneity 
analyses will be done at the patient level with the formal test of heterogeneity determined by [CONTACT_792107]-level stratification variable and the intervention. We will also examine associations 
with the variables collected in the practice characteristics questionnaire at baseline.   
 
The planned analysis of the heterogeneity of treatment effects meets  PCORI Methodology Standards 
5:HT-1,2,3, and 4 , which state that the goals of any heterogeneity of treatment effects analysis should be 
stated clearly (HT-1); the analysis plans should be pre-specified and any hypotheses related to heterogeneity 
should be pre-specified with supporting evidence provided (HT-2); all heterogeneity claims must be based on 
appropriate statistical contrasts among groups being compared, such as interaction tests or estimates of 
[ADDRESS_1092091] (HT-3); and for any heterogeneity of treatment effect analysis, all pre-specified 
analyses should be reported as should, at a minimum, the number of post hoc analyses including all 
subgroups and outcomes analyzed (HT-4).[ADDRESS_1092092] that are often difficult to recruit into research studies. We preplan subgroup 
analyses on:  
 
1) Men,  
2) Those younger than age 60 years,  3) Those with low health literacy/numeracy, and  4) Those reporting mild or greater depressive symptoms.  
 
Past reports have shown that male sex and younger age are associated with higher risk for uncontrolled CVD risk factors, and health disparities are also greatest in younger individuals.
2,[ADDRESS_1092093] 10 men and 12 individuals younger than 60 years of age at each practice; mild depressive symptoms are present in 50% of this population, and health literacy is also very low. The 
background prevalence and oversampling of men and younger individuals will provide enough power to 
conduct these pre-specified subgroup analyses. 
 These subgroup analyses meet the recommendations of PCORI Methodology Standard 1:RQ-[ADDRESS_1092094] set will include any 
outlying variables excluded during data cleaning. The next set will trim the upper and lower 5% tails of 
observations with continuous distributions to identify any associations that may be due to or exaggerated by 
[CONTACT_792108], but not spurious, observations. The final set of planned sensitivity analyses will consider process 
measures and measures of intervention fidelity to consider the association between variable exposure and 
outcomes. This will be particularly important both for planning future studies and for efficient resource 
allocation when planning for scale-up and wider implementation. Additional sensitivity analyses may be undertaken if missing data is a serious concern, as discussed below. 
 
Sensitivity analyses are recommended in PCORI Methodology Standards 3:IR-5  (which recommend the 
use of sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of key assumptions) and 4:MD-5  (which recommend that 
the sensitivity of inferences to missing data methods and assumptions should be examined and incorporated 
into the interpretation of the results).

8.10 Sample Size Estimates 
 We plan to recruit 80 practices and 25 patients per practice for a total projected sample size of 2,000 
patients. We estimate patient attrition at 20% (a conservative estimate given our past 85% retention in prior 
Black Belt studies), resulting in a reduced sample of 1,600. Because patients are sampled within practices, we accounted for clustering using a design factor D=1+ρ(n-1), where ρ is the ICC and n is the number of patients per practice. The effective sample size (N
eff) is then N/D. In our Encourage trial the estimated ICC for systolic 
BP was 0.02, although it was not statistically significant. With 2,000 participants, N eff=1351, or 337 per study 
group. We conservatively assume 20% practice-level attrition, resulting in droppi[INVESTIGATOR_86286] 16 practices per group, 
63 
 which decreases power more than reducing the patients per practice; the resulting N eff=[ADDRESS_1092095] that the effective sample size estimate for 20% attrition with ICC=0.[ADDRESS_1092096] to be our minimal detectable differences with 80% power. 
 
  
8.11 Power and Significance Levels 
 
All power calculations are based on two-sided tests with type one error rate of 0.05% and 80% power 
(Table 18). Practice-level analyses will generally rely on t-tests or Wilcoxon tests for differences between the 
change in HTN control between groups. Power calculations are given for pairwise tests assuming the ‘worst 
case’ scenario of a large interaction so that the effect in the group receiving both interventions is the same as the groups receiving a single intervention. For all scenarios presented, the power of the omnibus test is >80%. Given a less extreme interaction power increases rapi[INVESTIGATOR_792009], at follow-up we 
expect to observe that 5% to 35% will be controlled in the control group, and at least  15% more among the 
groups receiving an intervention, e.g. 20% to 50%. Patient-level analyses assumed a standard deviation of [ADDRESS_1092097] deviation (SD) to be lower among the control group, and somewhat higher among the intervention group. Table [ADDRESS_1092098] deviations of 10% and 16% in 
practice-level rates for the control and intervention groups, respectively, and for SD of 8% and 10%, 
respectively. Because the observed SD among practices varies with the number of patients per practice, power 
calculations were based on simulation studies. To further guard against deviations from distributional 
assumptions, simulations also examined the power using Wilcoxon tests, which was found to be very similar.

Power for subgroup analyses: As indicated above, for patient-level analyses of pairwise differences 
between groups we can assume an effective sample size of at least [ADDRESS_1092100] a difference of 5% vs. 20%. The implication is that subgroup analyses, even when limited to a third of the sample, will have sufficient power for the minimum 
anticipated main effect of a 15% difference.  The further implication is that with a sample size [ADDRESS_1092101] 80% power to detect interaction effects as small as 1.[ADDRESS_1092102] taught us many effective approaches for minimizing loss to follow-up even among a disadvantaged and geographically dispersed population. In our Encourage trial 
we maintained over 85% follow-up over the course of nearly two years. In this trial, due to the readiness criteria 
required of participating practices, including data collection combined with routine visits in a known clinical environment with some data obtained by [CONTACT_792109], we anticipate that follow-up will be even higher. 
Nevertheless if any data items are more than 15% missing we will analyze patterns of missingness and, if the 
data is plausibly missing at random, we will repeat analyses using multiple imputation via 10 chained equations to address the missing covariates. This approach results in retention of the sample, and results in less biased 
estimates. A common covariate with missing data is annual household income, which is often missing in 15-
20% of the study sample. The complete case method would drop those without income information from the analysis, introducing biases. We have used multiple imputation with chained equations to retain the sample.  
 
We will also pursue analyses of changes over time that will use data from all available time points, and thus 
make more complete use of the data where a participant’s data are missing only at a few time points.  
 
Unfortunately, in studies of this nature, missingness due to incomplete follow-up cannot often be treated as 
missing and is plausibly related to the study outcome. In these case where there is concern for imbalances in loss to follow-up among study groups, we will conduct sensitivity analyses assuming outcomes for those lost to follow-up that will assess the potential of their loss to have biased findings against the null hypotheses. 
 
Our plans to address missing data meet the recommendations of PCORI Methodology Standards 4:MD-
1,2,3, and [ADDRESS_1092103] 4:MD-[ADDRESS_1092104] 4:MD-[ADDRESS_1092105] 4:MD-[ADDRESS_1092106] 4:MD-5 recommends examining the sensitivity of 
inferences to missing data methods and assumptions and incorporating this information into the interpretation 
of the study’s results.
[ADDRESS_1092107] examine the bivariate association between the dose 
65 
 variables and each outcome measure separately, then we will examine the role of participant characteristics in 
this relationship by [CONTACT_792110] (age, gender, social support) and physiologic variables 
(duration of hypertension, baseline systolic blood pressure, number of antihypertensive medications used at baseline, presence of chronic kidney disease, presence of diabetes, use of insulin, number of comorbid medical conditions) into a multivariable model. We will observe the effect of entry of the covariates on the 
parameter estimate for the dose variable in each of these models. We will first examine each dose variable 
separately, then construct a model in which all dose variables are entered simultaneously, separately for each outcome. We will examine interactions with dose-response variables to explore whether subgroups are more 
or less sensitive to any observed dose-response effects, recognizing that the power for these analyses will be 
limited by [CONTACT_792111]. We will also explore the feasibility of a dose-response score that 
incorporates all dose variables that are bivariately significantly associated with the outcome and weighting 
each variable according to the strength of the association, following the approach of Charlson.

 For the practice facilitation intervention, we will assess intervention dose both quantitatively and 
qualitatively. We hypothesize that greater quantity of interactions, more intensive activity in each of the [ADDRESS_1092108] examined the KDIS as a simple ordinal scale and demonstrated 
associations of higher KDIS scores with better outcomes.
93 This analysis will explore whether intensive activity 
in one of the domains is more strongly associated with outcomes than intensive activity in another domain, for 
example, whether more intensive activity around self-management support is more effective than more 
intensive use of the practice’s data systems. We will use a similar approach as outlined above for the 
66 
 evaluation of a dose response scale for practice facilitation in the peer coaching intervention, following the 
approach of Charlson.92 
 For the hybrid practice facilitation with integrated peer coaching intervention, we will examine all the same 
variables as for each of these interventions separately, in addition to variables that assess the blended 
intervention specifically (see Table 19). The analysis will be analogous to that described for the peer coaching 
and practice facilitation interventions, adding the variables specific to the blended intervention.

[ADDRESS_1092110] efficient manner. This focus has been a factor in the conceptualization of the Triple Threat study as a pragmatic trial, placing minimal burden on participants and practices.  
 
9.3 Documentation  
 
Having clearly written instructions for the trial is a vital component of data quality. The protocol will be the 
guide for the development of a much more dynamic Manual of Procedures (MOP) maintained by [CONTACT_792113], thereby [CONTACT_792114]. The MOP is viewed by [CONTACT_792115], and is subject to review and modification as the study progresses. The DWG will work with the field-based data collectors to ensure that current MOPs are maintained and that study procedures are followed rigorously.   
 
These approaches meet recommendations set forth in PCORI Methodology Standard 1:RQ-2 , which 
recommend developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a formal study protocol.1  
 
9.4 Training 
 
A shared understanding of both the protocol and MOP is critical to ensuring high quality data, and the key 
to this shared understanding is a strong and on-going training program. Each data collector will undergo training and certification in addition to an in person refresher training every 6 months as needed under the direction of each site’s Program Manager, overseen by [CONTACT_792116]. The data collectors will meet weekly by [CONTACT_792117]-training and the development and review of training materials. Training 
activities will include mock exercises, review of the biometrics measurement protocol, BP machine checks, and 
cuff size selection. New data collectors will be trained individually via phone and web-based training programs and in person. All training materials will be available on the trial web site managed at the DCC. 
 
9.[ADDRESS_1092111] been refined over 30 years of field use for the ClinvestiGator  system. Range 
and validity checks (including cross-form checks) are performed as data are keyed, and the AL and NC program managers are informed immediately regarding data that do not meet the pre-defined validations on 
the program manager dashboard. The system allows for restricting data to specific options where violations are not permitted (for example, sex is restricted to either men or women, with no other acceptable options) and validating data that is entered, such as weight, where suspi[INVESTIGATOR_792010] (for example, weights above 400 pounds are possible, but require confirmation by [CONTACT_792118]).  In addition, data can be checked across CRFs to prevent conflicting information from being 
[ADDRESS_1092112] quality data.  Data entered will be assessed for patterns of unlikely options within a participant and practice, e.g., large weight fluctuations within a short period of time. If the DWG 
notice unacceptable error rates (i.e, consistently above 0.5%), we will undertake retraining of the field-based 
staff member.  
 
9.7 Auditing of Data Collectors   
 
Random audits of 10% of each field based staff with data entry activities will be performed to ensure that 
data entered into the computer system matches CRFs and retraining will be undertaken when appropriate.  9.[ADDRESS_1092113] 
additional information from any study unit (e.g., practice sites, facilitators, peer coaching committee, Executive 
Committee), to implement a stepped program to resolve discrepancies, where data collectors are first notified of issues, and then the relevant PI (Drs. Cherrington, Viera, Cummings) is involved to resolve issues with 
retraining or replacement of staff, as warranted. The DWG will provide a standing report to the Executive Committee at each of its meetings. 
 
9.11 Audit Trails  
The DWG will use well established approaches to create data audit trails for data and data entry (e.g., login 
attempts, selection of forms), requests for changes in the system, any changes to servers/software, system tests used in application validation and development, and physical security.  
 
 
9.[ADDRESS_1092114] practices dictate adequate security measures are achieved in a multi-layer approach: physical, electronic, application, detection, and response to breech and training.  
 
 Physical security is maintained through video surveillance of the server room and hallways; two different 
systems of environmental surveillance; electronic locks on all doors providing access to servers; physical 
69 
 securing of desktop PCs; onsite backup media are kept in a secure room and offsite backup media are kept in 
a fireproof safe in a secure room; and PCs and laptops are placed so that they are not publically viewable.  
 
 Electronic security is assured through PGP encryption; firewall Patchlink screensavers and installed 
antivirus packages; required login IDs and strong password authentication with passwords changed every 180 days; “least needed” access granted by [CONTACT_792116]; Event Sentry software to provide secure remote logging and notification of exceptional events.  
 
 Applications are designed following the Clark-Wilson model.  User credentials alone will not possess 
sufficient rights to access study data via any other means than the application provided. Applications containing sensitive data will use Federal Information Processing Standard (140-2) compliant software to 
encrypt/decrypt the data.  Passphrase used to initiate access to secured data is held in memory and not hard coded into the application.   
 
 Detection. Campus IT Security operates twice daily scans of every computer on the network for known 
security risks, such as open ports, missing software patches, weak administrative passwords, and misconfigurations. When a computer is identified, campus security notifies the responsible system administrator and sets a deadline for remediation.  In egregious cases, the network port supporting the computer will be shut off.  Campus IT Security operates network monitoring system which scans network 
packets for signatures of known malware, data streams addressed to known malware or suspect sources, or other anomalous (heuristic detection) network traffic.  In the cases of known malware or known traffic to suspect sources, campus security will shut off the network port supporting the computer and notify the responsible system administrator.  Anomalous network traffic is examined and may result in the shut off of the network port supporting the identified computer. Applications employing decryption mechanisms (as described earlier) will remotely log access attempts to data it manages; logging mechanism will have filters that can be set to send alert messages to responsible administrators if access attempts exceed guidelines and have the ability to completely halt access to secured data. 
 
Security Response to Breech. It is institutional policy that all instances of data security breaches be 
reported to campus IT Security to initiate an investigation to document and determine the nature of the breech, what information is involved, how best to stop further loss, what remediation is necessary and if the breech is reported to authorities.  Campus IT Security staffs an active response unit that provides forensics and maintains a close working relationship with State and Federal authorities.  
 
Training. All DWG employees take part in annual training regarding data security. Application developers 
are required to read the “Application Development Guidelines SOP” and provide signed affirmation. Application 
developers are required to read and stay abreast of the guidelines provided by [CONTACT_792119] ( www.owasp.org ). 
 
9.[ADDRESS_1092115]. James Hollenberg, as its data management 
system (Appendix 13). ClinvestiGator  will provide full service electronic data capture (EDC), data management, 
and reporting. Data management includes: database specification, development and testing; edit check 
programming; data management plan development and maintenance; ongoing manual data review and query management; and data cleaning and locking. ClinvestiGato r will generate monthly reports during the study to 
monitor enrollment and maintain and improve the quality of the study database and will facilitate the ability to:  
  
(1) Collaborate and communicate with the study PIs to review the proposed protocol and contribute to 
finalizing that document;  
(2) Develop case report forms;  
(3) Develop relevant Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs);  (4) Develop and maintain full service EDC and data management that will include a web-based data entry 
system;  
(5) Create and distribute data entry processes;  
(6) Train and certify users in the data entry systems;  
70 
 (7) Receive, collect, process, store, and analyze data collected from the participating clinical practices; and  
(8) Participate in preparing and distributing quality control reports to the participating practices, study 
committees, and the sponsors and Research Coordination Unit. 
 
 
9.[ADDRESS_1092116] included externally funded projects with over $26 
million in funding.  
 
For studies with moderate or heavy activity (such as this proposed trial), a web-based data management 
system, where field-based data collectors are responsible for the entry of their own data, is both cost effective 
(as it removes a large proportion of the query process) and results in higher quality data and a reduced need 
for retraining. At the practice level, participant data will be entered directly into the web-based integrated system.  
 
The integrity of the data is ensured by [CONTACT_114820]. Each is assigned access to 
only the portions of the database they need.  Access is provided under “hard” password protection (at least 8 characters and including both symbols and numbers) that are changed at [ADDRESS_1092117] (data is not transferred out of the system). 
Incremental data back-ups are made on a daily basis, and complete data backups are made on a weekly basis and stored at an off-site repository. As a SQL database, interfaces for reporting with SAS are an ordinary feature of that package. Finally, the system being proposed is FDA audit ready, with appropriate Systems Life 
Cycle Documentation. The functionalities of the system are shown in Table 18.

Establish eligibility Inclusion/exclusion criteria built into system. 
Manage 
participant flow in 
practices System updates data collection schedule at baseline, 6 and 12 months . Scheduling portion of system 
provides “real time” r eports of expected assessments to be delivered for each par ticipant. System 
presents participant-s pecific forms for each enc ounter, ensuri ng that the correct  forms (and only the 
correct forms) are completed with each visit. 
Platform for data 
entry At each participant encounter, CRFs entered into laptops with secure internet access; data keyed 
into database at DCC. System tra cks each CRF through its “life-cycle” from first data entry to 
completion and “locking” (i.e., all data fields co mpleted, all pa ss data range and va lidity checks). 
System includes visual co lor-coded alerts for coordinator to instantly know of forms pending or 
overdue for specific participants.  Once form is locked, data collector can review but not change data 
on form; data changes require DCC request with appropriate justification and approval prior to one-
time use, participant- and form-specific, time-limited unlock code being issued.  
Data quality System enforces participant  schedule with visits entered within windows; also monitors and tracks 
other components of data quality, including missed visits and missed forms and data lag for entry 
(i.e., overdue forms). In addition, system reports st atus of data quality to both local site (both 
summary and participant-level reports) and to the standing Data Work Group. 
Participant safety Tracking system for each AE. All CRFs associated with an AE event generate separate AE form for 
completion at practice site. When AE form entered, study safety monitor at UAB notified of AE 
through automatically generated e-mail. Safety monitor has access to details of AE through separate interface to system; as s/he evaluates AE (determine likelihood of association with BP drug, severity of AE, expected/unex pected nature of AE, resolution of AE), event can be cl osed and locked in 
system.   
AE = adverse event. CRF = case report form. DCC = data coordinating center. 
 
The plans for data management meet  PCORI Methodology Standard 2:IR-[ADDRESS_1092118] planned for a staged process, with only half the total number of practices 
(n=40) ready to be randomized by [CONTACT_792120]. While the emphasis on small practices engages the very practices that most need help, conducting the study in these practices will also be more difficult. We have therefore designed the study to allot no more than [ADDRESS_1092119] therefore minimized the number of patients per practice to 25. The team’s past experience with similar interventions involving both practice facilitation (at UNC and ECU) and peer coaching 
(at UAB and Weill Cornell) permits the interventions to be refined using previously collaboratively developed 
intervention materials, speeding the intervention development timeline.  
 
Once fielded, additional challenges arise. This implementation trial engages real-world interventionists, a 
strategy that enhances long-term sustainability at the potential expense of intervention fidelity. We will 
overcome this challenge by [CONTACT_792121], which serves to empower them and make the study “their” study, enhancing internal motivation to 
adhere to the intervention protocol. We have developed multiple strategies to monitor intervention fidelity as 
detailed above in section 7.  
 
Data quality in real-world settings can be compromised by [CONTACT_792122]. We therefore plan to have all study variables collected by [CONTACT_792123]. This is especially true for BP measurement, which has well documented departures from JNC recommendations in clinical care. Data collection will present additional challenges because patients may 
not be able to attend appointments at the practice. The community coordinators have been successful in 
assisting study participants to overcome barriers to attending study appointments in our past projects, and these same strategies will be employed in the present study.  
 
Data systems for complex data entry and management needs for a study of this nature are challenging to 
create, especially in a relatively short timeframe. We use a well-established data collection system, ClinvestiGator , which has over 30 years of field experience. Data security is a challenge in all trials, but 
especially in trials conducted in real-world settings; the well-established approaches to data security outlined in 
section [ADDRESS_1092120] be appropriately safeguarded from unauthorized 
access. Paper and/or electronic records for study participants will be stored at the Clinical Sites. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_792011]-defined clinical events, including necessary medical records, will be stored at the clinical data management system, ClinvestiGator  
and within the offices of the investigative team. These records will receive the same care as would ordinary 
medical records. They will be stored in locked filing cabinets and/or filing rooms within secure office space. Only study personnel who have completed STUDY training in data handling will have access to study forms.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1092121] be obtained. As 
described in section 5 above, informed consent will be obtained from all participants after a presentation by [CONTACT_792124]. Because low literacy is prevalent in the targeted region, the study will 
provide consent in a video format, an approach that will also standardize the consent process. The consent 
video will be integrated into ClinvestiGator  and will include periodic comprehension assessments (mini 
quizzes) to assure that the content is being understood by [CONTACT_4317]. In the event a significant protocol change occurs, the informed consent will be adjusted appropriately and sites will submit the revised documents 
to their IRB for approval. Local IRB’s will determine whether it is necessary to re-consent participants.  
  
11.[ADDRESS_1092122], the consent forms may be released for internal IRB review. The study will be conducted in accordance 
with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), all applicable subject privacy requirements, and the guiding principles of Helsinki, including but not limited to: 
 
1. Local Institute Review Board (IRB)/Central IRB review and approval of study protocol and any subsequent amendments. 
2. Subject informed consent for the study.  The study consent will contain the six essential elements from 
GCP guidelines that include: 
• Research statement, reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts, reasonably expected benefits 
to subjects or others, appropriate alternatives, extent of confidentiality, compensation or treatment 
for injury. 
• Additional elements where appropriate such as unforeseeable risks to subjects, investigator-
initiated termination of participation, additional costs, significant new findings, authorization for release 
of protected health Information for research purposes. 
3. Investigator reporting requirements.  
 Written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization must 
be obtained from each person prior to enrollment into the study. The study team will provide full details and 
template documents for the above procedures in the MOP and provide training to the investigators and clinical 
staff on regulatory and ethical considerations. All study personnel will be responsible for completing and 
remaining current with all applicable human subjects’ protection, good clinical practice and data security and 
privacy training requirements 
[ADDRESS_1092123] 
and/or an approach involving a person (e.g., a health care professional) who is acquainted with the 
potential peer supporter. Information governance principles need to be adhered to in this process. The selection process for those with, or without, given characteristics needs to be transparent, justifiable 
and fair. Peer supporters need to be trained in confidentiality. Peers have the right to confidentially 
refuse a given peer supporter: this may be more or less common with friends, relatives or neighbors.   
3.   Professional-Lay Boundaries  
Standard professions have delineations for boundaries within which relationships may be ethically practiced. While peer supporters are not professionals, support relationships are breeched when there are conflicting roles that compete with the primary goals of peer support. This means that peer sup-
porters need to carefully negotiate the kinds of contacts and activities they enter into with their peers 
and have appropriate guidelines for support from clinical personnel. 
 
4. Simplified Informed Consent  
The need for full informed consent for peer support interventions is a matter of some debate. Some have proposed that there are two aspects where implied consent may constitute an appropriate standard: intervention and the surrounding research.  Agreeing to pair up with a peer or attend a group 
within an IRB approved framework should imply consent. Similarly, there are research activities where 
an individual gives consent by [CONTACT_792125]/her actions (e.g., completing an IRB approved questionnaire). However, more intrusive research activities (e.g., measurements, recorded activities, 
blood sampling) should require standard consent processes and these will be followed here.  Medical 
record review needs to follow standard information governance procedures.     
 
5. Documentation of Peer Relationship and its Activities  
Formalizing peer relationships requires establishing some basic standards of documentation of the peer relationship and of the activities and outcomes of such a relationship. While documentation in standard professions is elaborate, standards and scope of peer documentation are not well-defined. Certain 
critical cross cutting issues like ensuring completeness and accuracy, confidentiality, avoiding falsifying 
of records, and truth telling must be adhered to.  
 
6. Confidentiality and Privacy of Person’s Records and Information.  
The freedom to be left alone should extend to all peer support relationships. Patients do not have to document a written release in order to voluntarily share their own personal health information with a 
peer supporter.  They can assume that it will be treated confidentially.  They can freely choose whether 
to have a peer supporter and whether or not to share any personal health information. 
 
7. Involvement in Illegal Activities  
Parties involved in peer relationships should not abet or foster crime including involvement with illegal 
drugs. Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a peer partner in crime and covering it up is immoral and should be discouraged.  
74 
  
8. Non-licensure to Practice Medicine  
Peer supporters are not qualified nor licensed to diagnose, give medical advice or recommend medications. Their interventions involve support that in many aspects aids the implementation of the licensed medical practitioner’s recommendations.  
 
9. Payment/Volunteerism  
Any payments made to peer supporters must be carefully considered. A tension exists between the 
benevolence of volunteers and the capacity for health systems to exploit this benevolence which might 
undermine evidence-based (but more costly) structures and system changes. If a health system 
finances peer supporters, then there is an obligation to provide adequate training and support for their 
work.  
 
10. Support for Peer Supporters  
Peer support volunteers must receive emotional support and adequate supervision in order to address 
potential emotional issues and other practical concerns that arise from their activities in working with 
patients.   
 
  
75 
  
12. Publication Policy  
 
The purpose of the policy is to encourage and facilitate the presentation and publication of the study 
background, rationale, design, and analyses; ensure appropriate use of the study data, timely completion of 
manuscripts and presentations, equitable access to authorship, and adherence to established principles of 
authorship; and coordinate the reporting of trial results. The policy applies to all investigators analyzing, presenting, and publishing data from the study. There are several principles underlying this policy:  
 
1. Research questions and hypotheses to be addressed using study data should be formulated a priori 
and clearly stated in a manuscript proposal to reduce the likelihood that study results are attributable to type I error.  
 
2. Publication of scientific findings from the study should proceed in a timely fashion once relevant 
analyses are complete.  
 
3. The publications arising from the study should avoid overlap and conflicting representation of study 
findings. Overlaps are, however, acceptable for review articles.  
 
4. Recognition through authorship will be distributed among the study investigators so that all study 
investigators and team members have equitable opportunity to lead and co-author study publications.  
 
5. The study should promote the career development of trainees and junior faculty by [CONTACT_792126]-authors of study publications, as appropriate.  
 
6. Standards for authorship on study publications will adhere to the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts 
Submitted to Biomedical Journals of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (NEJM 1997;336:309-315) and those established by [CONTACT_747946].  
 
7. The concept, in the form of a proposal, for all manuscripts must be approved by [CONTACT_941] P&P Subcommittee 
prior to preparation. There are three categories of manuscripts and anticipated authorship: 
 
i) Main results developed based on core study data and study aims/hypotheses (which will 
bear the corporate authorship). The design and main baseline papers will also be corporate 
authored. 
 
ii) Manuscripts developed and authored by [CONTACT_792127]. 
 
  
76 
 13. Study organization 
 
The study is a collaborative effort spanning four universities and several community-based organizations. 
This team is organized into an Executive Committee composed of the study investigators and lead staff, supported by [CONTACT_792128], as shown in the organizational chart (Figure 11).  
 
 
  
 
 
 
The study is organized as a multiple PI [CONTACT_3449]. [CONTACT_528582] is the overall scientific lead of the study as the 
submitting PI; [CONTACT_792138] is the co-PI [INVESTIGATOR_792012], since UAB is the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_68909].  
 The internal Steering Committee  meets monthly to obtain input from the group on major study decisions. 
Most of the work is conducted through the Workgroups. The Steering Committee is chaired by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Safford, and 
co-chaired by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cherrington. Drs. Safford, Cherrington, and Andreae set the agenda for the Steering 
Committee. All investigators and the sponsors are invited to the monthly internal Steering Committee meetings. Once the study has begun to collect data, the internal Steering Committee will serve as the Publications and Presentations committee, approving study manuscript proposals, assuring appropriate authorship, and reviewing manuscripts prior to submission. 
 The Work Groups are designed to include investigators and staff from each of the four participating 
universities, and are each led by [CONTACT_210319]. Work Groups meet every two weeks, and create time 
delimited ad hoc Work Groups as needed. For example, an ad hoc work group led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Oparil led the 
development of the BP titration algorithm for the study, which is integrated into both interventions (Appendix 6).  
 
Figure 11. Organizational chart for the study.  The Executive Committee is supported by [CONTACT_792129], peer coaching, 
administrative, data, recruitment and retention, and community engagement work groups. Leads of each work group are underlined.  
The EC is also supported by [CONTACT_792130]. The proposed  study will collaborate with the 
sponsors, Research Coordination Unit and the other funded study. CTSA = Center and Translational Science Award. CHD = Center for Health 
Disparities. MHRC = Minority Health Research Center.  
[ADDRESS_1092124]. Harrington’s retirement and [CONTACT_92787]’s transition to a new institution. This group is responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_792013], recruiting practices, deciding on whether a practice is ready to be randomized, and conducting retention activities. This work group also oversees patient recruitment.  
 
The Practice Facilitation  Work Group  is led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Halladay. This work group is charged with finalizing 
the practice facilitation intervention, overseeing the training of the practice facilitators, and overseeing the ongoing support of the facilitators. It will be responsible for monitoring intervention fidelity and taking corrective action should facilitators demonstrate lack of ability to implement the intervention as designed. The web-based 
data system permits reporting in near real-time, assuring the ability to closely monitor progress. 
 The Peer Coaching Work Group  is led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cherrington. This work group is charged with finalizing the 
peer coaching intervention, assisting with peer coach recruitment, overseeing the training and certification of 
the peer coaches, and monitoring intervention implementation as well as peer coach coordination and support. 
 The Community Engagement Work Group  is led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Safford. This work group is charged with 
engaging stakeholders to obtain input on the design of the study, its implementation, and plans for scaling up. 
This work group coordinates community advisory board meetings, and in addition obtains input from practice facilitators, peer coaches, and practicing primary care physicians.  
 
The Data  Coordination Center  is led by [CONTACT_6283]. Richman and Safford. It is charged with establishing and 
maintaining the study’s data systems and in-servicing study staff in their use. It is charged with providing randomization assignment for each practice, and assuring balance across practice types during the enrollment phase. It is charged with maintaining the integrity of the data, as well as providing interim reports to the DSMB. The Data Coordination Center will analyze the study’s data for scientific manuscripts as well as reports for a wider lay audience. 
 The Administrative Work Group  is led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Safford and includes study program managers from each 
university as well as the leads of the community-based organizations. It is charged with providing meeting 
support, assuring IRB approvals are obtained in timely fashion, creating and updating the study’s protocol and manual of operations, creating reports as required by [CONTACT_456], and managing the budgets and subcontracts.

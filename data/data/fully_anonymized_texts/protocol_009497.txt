Protocol  
 
A. Background  
 
Each year, one million adults in the U.S.A are diagnosed wit h carpal tunnel 
syndrome (CTS)  with 500,000  carpal tunnel release (CTR) procedures .  
Previous  analyses  have  shown very low rates of surgical site infections (SSI) 
overall2,10 with incidence rates of  0.25-0.77% without or 0.21-0.47% with 
surgical prophylactic  antibiotics, but no statistical significance.1,2,9  These 
include populations typi[INVESTIGATOR_56388] “high risk” such as those with 
diabetes mellitus, or history of total joint arthroplasty.2,3  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_766609] 
 
10/10/2018  version 1.6    Page 3 infection in all types of CTR, and recommendations to discontinue habitual 
use of preoperative antibiotics  in clean hand surgery , the behavior is still 
very prevalent  with 30 -60% of hand surgeons still prescribing either 
sometimes or all the time prior to CTR .2,7,9,11,12  Only 2% of British hand 
surgeons prescribe prophylactic antibiotics before CTR.  In C anada CTR 
surgery is considered minor , even being  performed rout inely in the clinical 
office setting , and all without prescribing antibiotics prophylactically.5  
Endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR) procedures are becoming more 
common, and while current evidence supports no significant increased rates 
of complications, without direct visualization and hemostasis there is 
potential for hematoma vulnerable to infe ction.  While there  is some  
appropriately powered,12 prospective8,12 level I evidence regarding the use of 
prophylactic preoperative antibiotics in carpal tunnel surgery  in general , to 
our knowledge  there are  none specifically investigating incidence of SSI 
with and without antibiotics after ECTR . 
 
B. Objective(s)  
 
Establish level I evidence regarding  
• whether prophylactic an tibiotics reduce the incidence  of 
infection in ECTR  
 
C. Study d esign  
 
• Procedures by [CONTACT_766616] -trained hand surge ons.   
• Prospective, randomized, and double blinded.   
o RANDOMIZATION :  Participants will be randomly assigned 
to 1 of 2 groups: 1) Weight -based Ancef (or 1 g of vancomycin 
if penicillin /cephalosporin  allergic ) within 30 minutes of 
incision;  or 2) placebo IV  of normal saline . 
o BLINDING :  Neither surgeon , nor investigator s, nor patient 
will know who d id or did not receive antibiotics  until the end of 
the project .  Randomization generator will be utilized  by [CONTACT_766617] a master copy , with 
subsequent sealed  copi[INVESTIGATOR_766610], 
with Orthopaedic Residency Resear ch Coordinator (Chelsea), 
and the  WSRH pharmacy.   
 
10/10/2018  version 1.6    Page 4 The patient number (P#) list will be held by [CONTACT_766618] , who will not participate in data collection 
nor follow -up.   
The corresponding decoder key of P# with associated 
randomized number will be held by [CONTACT_766619].  
o PRIMARY OUTCOMES : Determine  proportion of patients 
with SSI in antibiotic versus placebo group.  Subjects follow -up 
over six weeks with primary outcomes  being (1) “ any 
supplemental intervention” ( i.e. additional wound care, 
antibiotics, or revision surgery. ); and (2) declaration of 
“complete” healing by [CONTACT_766620] -operative.  
• 2 weeks - clinical wound check .  
• 6 weeks – clinical assessment for completion of 
wound healing.  
• At each visit the attending physician will designate 
as “infecte d” or “not infected” and will be allowed 
to treat each patient accordingly.   Designations 
will be based on either:  
o Clinician experience    
▪ Considerations include  but are not 
limited to painful incision, erythema, 
drainage, or wound dehiscence.  
o Culture confirmed  
▪ deep infections   
• Wounds designated “infected”  by [CONTACT_766621] -divided into:  
o Superficial  (Surface only ) 
▪ Treat ment with local  wound care  
▪ Oral antibiotics only  
o Deep  
▪ IV antibiotics only  
▪ Surgical Irrigation & Debridement 
and IV antibiotics.  
o SECONDARY OUTCOMES : 
▪ Demographic information as well as comorbidities such 
as: acuity  of CTS , time from last cortisone injection, 
diabetes2, smo kers, COPD, anemia, peripheral artery 
disease , history of arthroplasty3, valvular disease,  and 
 
10/10/2018  version 1.6    Page 5 dual or single incision ECTR  will be noted for secondary 
outcome correlations.  
o DURATION:  By [CONTACT_766622] s of 10 CTRs  per week , this 
would require 65 weeks, with another 6 weeks to complete 
observations  of the patients.   
o PROCEDURE:   Dual or single -incision endoscopic carpal 
tunnel release with steri-strip closure  and simple sterile 
dressing, without immobilization.  
o WOUND CARE  & ACTIVITY :  Non-weight be aring on 
affected extremity until [ADDRESS_1051538] -operative day 4, but no submersion.  5 lb. weight 
restriction for 2 weeks, then 10 lbs for 3 weeks.  No physical 
therapy.  
 
D. Study population and recruitment m ethods   
 
• From t he investigator’s private clinical practices, all those who meet 
criteria for carpal tunnel release will be offered to participate in the 
study.   
 
E. Inclusion and exclusion c riteria  
 
o INCLUSIONS:   All patients who meet high probability (>12 points) on the 
Carpal Tunnel -6 (CTS -6) diagnostic aide and recommendation for  carpal 
tunnel release who are capable of giving informed consent, or their legal 
representative on the patients behalf.  
o EXCLUSIONS:   Patients allergic to both penicillin/cephalosporins and  
vancomycin.  Patients immobilized with splint or cast or receiving formal 
physical therapy in initial 6 weeks after ECTR.  Children  under the age of 18 
years old.  Patients or their legal representatives who decline the invitation for 
participation.   
o VUL NERABLE POPULATIONS:   Pregnant females and prisoners will be 
treated with equal and safe fairness and randomization as other participants, 
both pre -procedure as well as post -procedure, due to the double -blinded 
nature of the antibiotic administration.  The y will stand to benefit from the 
investigators clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_766611] . 
 
 
 
 
10/10/2018  version 1.6    Page 6 F. Role of s ubjects  
 
• Participants will agree to follow -up at [ADDRESS_1051539] o f care.   
• Participants will be asked to notify providers if concern for or signs of 
infection arise.  
 
G. Research p rocedures  
 
• Patient identified with score > 12 (80% probability) on the CTS -6 and 
recommended CTR:  (http://www.orthoguidelines.org/ctsdiagnosis)6 
o Symptoms predominantly in medial nerve innervated digi ts 
o Nocturnal numbness  
o Thenar atrophy and/or weakness  
o Positive phalen test  
o Positive tinel sign  
o Loss of 2 -point discrimination  
• Surgeon will discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgical 
intervention.  
• Patients who elect to proceed to scheduling will b e invited to 
participate in the study and informed consent will be obtained prior to 
seeing surgical scheduler.  
o For those who decline participation, they will be directed to 
scheduling without tardiness or punishment.  
• After scheduling surgery, the surgical coordinator will place a patient 
study number (P#  ie. P1, P2, P3, P4… ) sticker  on the patients surgical 
consent  and participation consent and these will be scanned in to the 
Epic Electronic Medical R ecord  (EMR)  under “Media – Study: 
ECTR ” 
Patient will be “tagged” with a study tag on their record banner for 6 
weeks.  
Patient will be added to “ ECTR & ABX” custom patien t list.  
• A “miscellaneous order” to pharmacy will be placed  in the Day of 
Surgery orders indicating need to blind the antibiotic solution as well 
as the P#. 
• Pharmacists at WellSpan Surgical & Rehabilitation Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_766612] a copy correlating randomiza tion number s to each P#  with 
instruction to formulate a placebo  bag of normal Saline for all ODD  
numbers , or an infusion of IV antibiotics  (Ancef or Vancomycin  for 
 
10/10/2018  version 1.6    Page 7 PCN or Cephalosporin allergic ) for all EVEN  numbers on the day of 
surgery.  
-Example - 
Patients p1 ,p4, and p5 (Even) receive  antibiotic . 
Patient s p2, and p3  (Odd) receive placebo . 
 
 
• On the day of surgery, blinding will continue with appropriately 
patient labeled IV bag  without identifying markers of content , to be 
administered within 30 minutes of surgical incision.  
• Surgical prep will be with chlorhexidine gluconate scrub and standard 
sterile drapi[INVESTIGATOR_766613].  
• Patients will undergo routine procedure with dual -or-single incision, 
single nylon closure, and simple adhesive steri-strip cover, without 
immobilization.  
• Wound will be visually evaluated at 2 & 6 week follow -up 
appointments  
o Activity limitations will incl ude: 
▪ [ADDRESS_1051540] two weeks  
▪ 10 lbs maximum for for two to six weeks  
▪ followed by “no restrictions” at 6 week appointment.  
• After the 6 week appointment of every 25th patient, investigators may 
“break the seal” and insert patient information from t he prior 25 
patients into protected collection data tables for final evaluation at 
study completion.  
 
H. Data to be u tilized  
• Demographic information  
• Medical comorbidities and history from clinic notes and Epic EMR.  
• Excel Spreadsheet with de-identified  data collection  
 

 
10/10/2018  version 1.6    Page 8 I. Data a nalysis  
• POWER :  Statistical significance would require n= 92 split evenly 
between trial and control; but clinical significance requires greater 
numbers due to the low incidence (0.25% -1.5% in the retrospective 
literature.)8,9   
o Our goal was calculated using the median incidence of 0.40%,5 
for a calculated power of n=642  split evenly between trial and 
control.  
• STATISTICAL ANALYSES:   
o Data will be analyzed using the statistical analysis program, 
SPSS. Most analysis will be completed by [CONTACT_766623]. Analysis will include 
frequency and percent determinations for all categorical 
parameters and mean and standard deviations for all continuous 
parameters. Appropriat e statistical tests will be employed to 
determine any statistical differences or associations between 
groups or subgroups once they are identified, which may 
involve chi -square, ANOVA, regression, or independent sample 
t-testing.  
 
J. Risks and risk m anagem ent 
• Patients will not be pressured into participation.  
• Grant funding will cover the cost of study drug to which patients are 
assigned. Patients and/or patient insurance will not be responsible for 
the cost of the study drug.  more than the current intermit tent costs of 
occasional antibiotic use.  
• Insurances will be billed as usual for all other ESCR surgical costs.  
• Self-pay patients will be treated equally with insured patients.  
• The risk of disruption to patient life, work, or social risk are low since 
this protocol allows for appropriate intervention at all points along the 
patients 6 week course.  
• An interim data analysis will occur beginning at patient number 25 to 
ensure that study procedures are not causing harm. The data analysis 
will be conducted by [CONTACT_99732]. The co -investigator will 
review the results, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_176337] i f it is safe to continue 
the study.  
K. Benefits  
• Study patients are not expected to directly benefit from participation.  
 
10/10/2018  version 1.6    Page 9 • Patient and societal  benefit s will be related to surgeons doing our part 
to appropriately manage antibiotic  stewardships, and decrease risks of 
antibiotic -resistant organisms.  
• Professional benefits would include support for decisions to eliminate 
unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis in clean hand surgery; OR 
establish the risks and utility of ECTR and antibiotics compared to 
traditional sur gery and preoperative protocols.  
• Economic implications include:  
o 500,000 procedures yearly with around 165,000 receiving 
antibiotics preoperatively, at estimated $50/2grams Cephazolin 
(or $150/1g Vancomycin), could save $8,745,000 yearly 
nationally (est. with Cephazolin).  
o Antibiotics are expected within 30 minutes of incision, and will 
occasionally delay incision in the operating room while the 
antibiotic is administered.  Estimated costs for OR function 
range from $20 -60 per minute.  Thus  even a 3 minute delay for 
rapid IV infusion, during  a 15 minute procedure, wastes another 
$60-180 per procedure . 
o Up to $[ADDRESS_1051541] per procedure for administration of a 
potentially unnecessary treatment.  
 
L. Compensation / i ncentives and research -related c osts 
• Compensations/Incentives: None  
• Costs:  Grant funding has been secured through Lake Erie College of 
Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM) to cover the cost of IV saline and 
antibiotics to avoid additional costs to the patient. Research time and 
product wil l be supplied by [CONTACT_226340] -investigator s and the 
Orthopaedic Surgery Residency research fund.  
 
M. Alternative p rocedures  
• Potential s ubjects are not required to participate in the study and 
refusing to do so will not affect the quality of their treatment.  
 
N. Research materials, records, and c onfidentiality  
• All patient records will be obtained through the secure WellSpan 
Health EMR (Epic).  
 
10/10/2018  version 1.6    Page 10 • Information will be stored external to the system in a non -identifiable 
manner with a P# assigned to i ndividuals on password encrypted 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_766614].  
• No patient information will be accessed outside of typi[INVESTIGATOR_766615] a signed HIPAA authorization form for participation in the 
study is in the patient recor d. 
 
O. Subject informed c onsent  
• CONSENT:   According to both Federal and State of Pennsylvania 
law, t he surgeon of record  will be authorized and trained to  provide 
and obtain informed consent in writing  at the preoperative visit.  
 
P. Intended use of r esearch

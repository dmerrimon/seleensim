Page 6 of 23  1.0 INTRODUCTION 
Surgical Site Infection (SSI) is a major source of morbidity in both colorectal (CRS) and 
hepatopancreatobiliary (HPBS) surgery.  The SSI rate has been published to be between 20- 35% 
[1-3]. Specifically, colectomy for the treatment of colorectal cancer is associated with a SSI rate 
of 10 -30% [1] and hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma has a SSI rate of 15- 25% [4, 5].  
Pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma has a SSI rate of 10 -20% [2, 6]. Taken 
together, up to a third of patients undergoing  these complex abdominal surgeries will suffer the 
additional morbidity of SSI despi[INVESTIGATOR_241980].  This added level of morbidity increases the complexity of patient care during recovery 
from surgery,  lengthens post -operative hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241981]. Given these persistently high rates of SSI despi[INVESTIGATOR_241982], a low morbidity 
intervention such as the incisional wound vacuum assisted closure ( V.A.C ) system is an attractive 
technology to try to further improve SSI rates in these patients.  
 
V.A.C® technology or negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has revolutionized the 
management of complex open wounds but its role in closed wounds remains undefined.  I nitial 
enthusiasm for its potential role in reducing SSI rates in closed laparotomy wounds came from a report in the cardiothoracic literature performed as a collaboration between Duke University 
Medical Center (DUMC) and the Durham VA Medical Center [ 7]
 .  Negative pressure wound 
therapy was applied to closed sternotomy wounds in 57 patients, with a 3% expected SSI rate.  No sternal wound infections were seen in any patients.  Though this initial report had small numbers of patients, the potential for this low morbidity technique to decrease SSI in sternotomy 
wounds was seen.  
 Several reports have investigated the preoperative patient -specific risk factors  as well as 
surgically -related risk factors to predict risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_241983] [ 8].  However, there is no reported 
study in the medical literature indicating the role or efficacy of either conventional wound care with sterile dressings or the application of V.A.C.® to postoperative abdominal i ncisions in 
preventing SSI.  However, both methods of wound care are employed on a daily basis in Duke University  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42619] (DUMC, Duke Raleigh Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241984] ) as well 
as other academic and private hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241985].   The conventional approach to 
postoperative surgical wound care has little evidence- based data to support its practice and 
surgeons have been using incisional V.A.C.® technology for several years in an attempt to curtail 
SSI in high risk patients.     
2.0 NPWT SYSTEMS   
2.1 PREVENA INCISION  MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  
The Prevena Incision Management System (PI[INVESTIGATOR_46427]) is the first battery powered negative pressure 
product designed specifically for management of closed surgical incisions that continue to drain 
following sutured or stapled closure.  The P IMS covers and protects the incision from external 
infectious sources, while negative pressure removes fluid and infectious material from the surgical incision.  
The Prevena System accomplishes its intended purpose by [CONTACT_15276] a dressing that seals the 
area around the incision site.  This dressing is fitted with connections for fluid/air lines that provide the means of communication between the wound and the suction apparatus.  The pump creates

polyurethane film with acrylic adhesive that provides adhesion of the dressing to the skin surrounding the incision and a polyurethane shell that encapsulates the foam bolster and interface layer, providing a closed system.  The polyurethane foam has a pore size of 400- 600 microns 
and a violet colorant.  Additionally, the dressing has a built -in pressure indicator, which shows 
when system pressure is at an acceptable level,  and a skin interface layer with 0.019% ionic 
silver, which wicks fluid from the skin surface.  The silver is not intended to treat infection but to reduce potential for contamination of the skin interface layer with microbes. This type of Prevena™ Incision Management System is a 510(k) – cleared, Class II device (K100821) .

3.0 STUDY RATIONALE  
Patients undergoing colorectal (CRS) and hepatopancreatobiliary (HPBS) surgery  are at high risk 
for postoperative complications such SSI and wound dehiscence.  Such complications increase 
the complexity of patient care during recovery from surgery, lengthen post -operative 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], add significant overall medical cost s and may potentially diminish quality of life  
and economic livelihood. To date, there is no reported study to evaluate the efficacy of either 
conventional wound care with sterile dressings or the application of V.A.C.® to postoperative abdominal incisions  in preventing SSI.  Furthermore, there are currently no identifiable additional 
risks for receiving either conventional wound care or PI[INVESTIGATOR_46427]. Therefore, the proposed study will 
compare SSI rates for subjects receiving NPWT  via PI[INVESTIGATOR_241990].A.C  to conventional wound 
care with sterile dressing.    
 
We hypothesize that incisional NPWT via PI[INVESTIGATOR_241991].A.C.(Kinetic Concepts  [LOCATION_003], Inc., San 
Antonio, TX) compared to conventionally closed laparotomy wounds may decrease the SSI rate 
in these subject populations which are associated with a high rate of postoperative wound 
complications.

4.1 PRIMARY  
• To compare the incidence of SSI rates between conventional wound care versus the 
incisional NPWT via PI[INVESTIGATOR_241990].A.C. within CRS or HPBS -associated laparotomy 
wounds as assessed on postoperative day 4-[ADDRESS_293793] postoperative clinic visit.  
4.2 SECONDARY  
• Characterize the incidence of SSI as superficial incisional, deep incisional, and organ/space as defined by [CONTACT_242008] (NSQIP) guidelines.  
 
• Assess (or compare) the length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241992].A.C .

5.1 STUDY DESCRIPTIO N 
This study is a multi- center, open- label, randomized clinical trial conducted at Duke Cancer 
Institute and Indiana University to evaluate whether incisional NPWT can help reduce the rate of 
SSI in patients undergoing either colorectal or hepatopancreatobiliary surgery. Up  to 170 subjects 
will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either conventional wound care (control group) or the incisional 
NPWT  (experimental group)  to ensure [ADDRESS_293794] -op visits.  Non-evaluable scenarios include aborted 
surgeries , cancelled surgeries, death unrelated to study, and early device removal related to 
device malfunction. Screen failures are defined as those subjects not randomized.   
 
Safety endpoints will be adverse events  related to the device or dressing,  including  the presence 
of any abnormal skin findings (such as blisters or rash). These endpoints will be assessed from 
the day of surgery  through the 30- day follow -up visit .   
 
Subjects randomized to conventional wound care (control group) will have their skin incisi ons 
closed with skin staples , sutures , or surgical glue  (per judgment of the treating physic ian), covered 
with sterile medical gauze and a form of adherent (tape or clear adhesive) for which the subject 
does not have any allergy. This dressing will be removed per the treating physician’s discretion 
or institutional standards.  
 Subjects randomized to the incisional NPWT  (experimental group) will have their skin incisions 
closed with skin staples  or sutures  (per judgment of the treating physician) , a laye r of non-
adhesive dressing (Adaptic: [COMPANY_012], New Brunswick, New Jersey) will cover the skin 
staples  or sutures, followed by [CONTACT_242009] (Benzoin: generic), a Prevena™ Incision 
Management System  peel and place or customizable dressing (KCI [LOCATION_003], Inc , San Antonio, 
[LOCATION_007]) covering only the skin staples  or sutures .  Please note , surgical glue should not be used 
for the experimental group. NPWT will be delivered using either the Prevena pump or the 
ActiV .AC. The incisional NPWT  will then be continued for a minimum of [ADDRESS_293795] of care. Subjects will be assessed during their inpatient stay and at the time of routine postoperative clinic visits  which is 
anticipated to be within 30 days of discharge. Presence or absence of SSI will be determined on postoperative day 4-5 and again at the time of the postoperative clinic visit, which is anticipated 
to be within 30 days of discharge.  Criteria for determination of SSI are listed in Section 8.  Patients who are candidates for a laparoscopic approach will not be recruited. Note: patients 
scheduled for a staging laparoscopy followed by [CONTACT_242010].

8.0 CLASSIFICATION OF SSI BY [CONTACT_242013]: 
Superficial Incisional SSI: Superficial incisional SSI is an infection that occurs within [ADDRESS_293803] one of the following:  
- Purulent drainage, with or without laboratory confirmation, from the superficial incision.  
- Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the 
superficial incision.  
- At least one of the following signs or symptoms of infection: pain or tenderness, localized 
swelling, redness, or heat AND superficial incision is  deliberately opened by [CONTACT_11065], 
unless incision is culture -negative.  
- Diagnosis of superficial incisional SSI by [CONTACT_242014]: Deep Incision SSI is an infection that occurs within 30 days after the 
operation and the infection appears to be related to the operation and infection involved deep soft 
tissues (for example, fascial and muscle layers) of the incision and at least one of the following:  
- Purulent drainage from the deep incision but not from the organ/space component of the 
surgical site.  
- A deep incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened by a surgeon when 
the patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (> 38 ° C), localized 
pain, or tenderness, unless site is culture -negative.  
- An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision is found on direct 
examination, during reoperation, or by [CONTACT_242015].  
- Diagnosis of a deep incision SSI by a surgeon or attending physician.  
- Report infection that involves both superficial and deep incision sites as deep incisional 
SSI. 
Organ/Space SSI: Organ/Space SSI is an infection that occurs within 30 days after the 
operation and the infection appears to be related to the operation and  the infection involves any 
part of the anatomy (for example, organs or spaces), other than the incision, which was opened 
or manipulated during an operation and at least one  of the following:  
- Purulent drainage from a drain that is placed through a stab wound into the 
organ/space.  
- Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue in the 
organ/space.  
- An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the organ/space that is found on 
direct examination, during reoperation, or by [CONTACT_80603].

10.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
Administrative Summary  
Between July 2016 and June 2017, institutional SSI rates were 29% and 9% for Whipple 
procedures and liver resections, respectively.  Based on these lower than expected SSI rates we 
decided to compute the observed, overall infection rate among patients currently enrolled and 
treated on this trial  to assess whether the trial hypotheses were reasonable assumptions . The 
current overall infection rate was estimated to be 11%. In addition, t he observed percent  of 
ineligible/non- evaluable patients was 14%. Consequently, the null and alternative hypotheses of 
the present trial are being amended from the previous null and alternative hypotheses of 30% 
and 15%, respectively to 17% and 5%, respectively, to reflect the  overall, observed infection rate.  
The revised, maximum sample size will be inflated to reflect the observed percent  of inevaluable 
patients , 14% . As of February 2018, 131 patients were randomized; n o statistical analysis of the 
study endpoint has been conducted to date.  
 
Revised Statistical Considerations  
The primary study endpoint is SSI rate. Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_242017] (colorectal vs 
hepatopancreatobiliary) and BMI (<30 vs  ≥30), and randomly assigned to conventional wound 
care group or negative wound pressure group with 1:1 allocation. The hypothesiz ed SSI rate is 
17% for the conventional wound care group (control group)  [1].  We anticipate a reduction of the 
rate to 5% in the negative wound pressure group ( experimental group).   
 
As this is a phase II study, a larger type I error rate of 0.[ADDRESS_293805] comparing two- sample binomial probabilities at a 1 -sided significance level of 0.1, the study 
has approximately 85 % power to detect the difference in SSI rates between 17% in the control

 Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables will be prospectively collected.  
10.1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
The primary analysis will include all randomized and evaluable patients but exclude ineligible patients or patients who are canceled from the study before receiving any wound care. SSI is 
defined as an infection that occurs within 30 days of operation. The primary endpoint is the SSI 
rate.  The primary analysis of comparing the conventional wound care (control group) and the 
incisional V.A.C® (experimental  group) will be conducted using a chi -square test for two- sample 
binomial probabilities with a one -sided significance level of 0.1. The observed SSI rate s and 90% 
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) estimates will be reported. Preoperative, intraoperative, and 
postoperative variables will be tabulated and appropriate summary statistics will be reported. As 
a secondary analysis, comparison of treatment groups for SSI will be adjusted for any significant preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative variables using logistic regression.  
 For secondary endpoints, t he incidence of SSI as superficial incisional, deep incisional, and 
organ/space will be estimat ed along with the 90% UCB s. The secondary endpoint length of stay 
is a continuous variable.  A Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to assess the significance of the 
difference between groups in median length of stay. Median length of stay, its range and quartiles 
will be reported.

to evaluate compliance with the protocol and the principles of GCP. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_242001](s) direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate his/her time and the time 
of the study team to the ORAQ auditor(s) in order to discuss findings and any relevant issues. 
 
ORAQ  audits are designed to protect the rights and well- being of hu man research subjects. 
ORAQ  audits may be routine or directed (for cause). Routine audits are selected based upon risk 
metrics generally geared towards high subject enrollment, studies with limited oversight or 
monitoring, Investigator initiated Investigational Drugs or Devices, federally -funded studies, high 
degree of risk (based upon adverse events, type of study, or vulnerable populations), Phase I 
studies, or studies that involve Medicare populations. Directed audits occur at the directive of the 
IRB or  an authorized Institutional Official.  
 
ORAQ  audits examine research studies/clinical trials methodology, processes and systems to 
assess whether the research is conducted according to the protocol approved by [CONTACT_12638]. 
The primary purpose of the audit/review is to verify that the standards for safety of human subjects 
in clinical trials and the quality of data produced by [CONTACT_12639]. The 
audit/review will serve as a quality assurance measure, internal to the institution. Additional goals 
of such audits are to detect both random and systemic errors occurring during the conduct of 
clinical research and to emphasize “best practices” in the research/clinical trials environment.

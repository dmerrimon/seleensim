23AUG 2018 Confidential  7 Statistical Methodology  This is a single arm phase Ib/II trial of Nivolumab and IL -2 in patients 
with Renal Cell Carcinoma. The phase Ib has a n endpoint of safety and 
the phase II primary endpoint is overall response rate (ORR = CR or 
PR) at 12 weeks.  A r ecently reported trial of Nivolumab after 1 prior 
therapy in RCC reported had an ORR of 25%.  With the addition of IL -2 
treatment to nivolumab, we hypothesize an ORR of approximately 46% 
in this population.   
 
Study Design/Study Endpoints/Sample Size and A ccrual  
For the phase Ib portion of the study: We will accrue an initial cohort of 3 
patients who will be treated with sequential (rather than interspersed) 
treatment. They will receive [ADDRESS_96315] fashion 
(two 5 -day cycles one week apart) followed by [CONTACT_88299] -[ADDRESS_96316] (see 5.2.1) the study will 
stop. The 4th patient will not be enrolled until after the analysis of the 3 
patient cohort is complete and submitted to the regulatory bodies . 
 
If <2 patients suffer a grade 3 or 4 immune related toxicity in the cohort 
of 3 patients, the study will enroll 7 more patie nts treated with 
Nivolumab administered intravenously at 480 mg /dose over [ADDRESS_96317] (as described in section 
5.2.1) we will pause the study and modify/discontinue the protocol in 
consultation with the site principal investigators and applicable 
regulatory authorities.  If [ADDRESS_96318] (see 5.2.1) during the toxicity 
window, then the study will continue to the phase II portion.  We choose 
to examine toxicity after [ADDRESS_96319] a DLT then the 95% exact binomial confidence interval 
will be > 25% and be indicative that there is too high an incidence of 
serious immune mediated toxicities.   
 
The phase II portion of the trial will be a Simon mini -max [ADDRESS_96320] s tage will accrue 12 patients ( INCLUDING  any evaluable 
patients accrued in the phase 1b portion). If more than [ADDRESS_96321] a 
response (CR or PR) out of the 12 patients, then we will accrue 11 more 
patients for a total sample size of 23 evaluable patients. If more than 8 
responses (CR or PR) are observed, then we will recommend further 
study of the combination.  This design has 80% power and 10% type I 
error. If the true ORR of the combined treatment is 25% or less, the 
probability of early termination of the trial is 39%.  If the true ORR is 
46% or greater, then the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_88280] 3.6%.  
Patients accrued in the Phase Ib portion of the trial will also be included 
in the Phase II if they are evaluable as defined below.  
 
Evaluable Patients:   All patients who receive at leas t [ADDRESS_96322] 1 dose of Nivolumab  will be evaluable for the primary 
endpoint of overall response proportion in the phase II portion of the 
Protocol UMCC 2016. 103

patient will be considered a non-responder.

1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Disease Background  
An estimated 64,770 cases of kidney cancer (RCC) were diagnosed in the U.S. in 2012 
with an estimated 13,570 deaths (SEER). There has been a steady 2 -4% per year 
increase in the incidence of RCC since [ADDRESS_96323] common variant of kidney 
cancers comprising up to 80% of RCC. The five -year survival rate for RCC subjects is 
70%, however, this includes the majori ty of subjects with localized disease whose five -
year survival is 91%. At the time of diagnosis approximately 30% of RCC subjects have 
metastatic disease and another 30% of subjects recur, and five -year survival for 
metastatic disease is less than 10%. The refore, there remains an urgent need for 
improvement in the therapeutic management of metastatic clear cell RCC (mRCC).  
 
RCC was one of the first cancers in which immuno -stimulatory therapy, such as 
interleukin -2 (IL-2), was shown to induce durable treatment response including durable 
complete responses (DCR) leading to FDA approval of High Dose (HD) IL -[ADDRESS_96324] -line therapy for 
clear cell mRCC sub jects offering a potential durable complete response, only a small 
minority of subjects exhibits complete response (CR). Strategies for enhancing the 
percentage of subjects exhibiting a DCR and enhancing the overall response rate 
associated with HD IL -[ADDRESS_96325] population.  
1.2 Study Agent(s) Background and Associated Known Toxicities  
Interleukin -2:  
IL-2 is a cytokine that is a potent growth factor for T cells. It exerts its activity by [CONTACT_88300] -2 receptor  (IL-2R) present on the cell surface of T cells and leads to its auto 
phosphorylation via JAK/STAT5 -dependent pathways, eventually leading to activation 
and proliferation of the T cells1. Although the exa ct mechanism by [CONTACT_88301] -[ADDRESS_96326] been demonstrated in multiple pathways required for a successful ge neration 
of adaptive and CTL (cytotoxic lymphocyte) -mediated anti -tumor response. For example, 
IL-2 is produced by [CONTACT_15195] -presenting cells (APCs) after they have phagocytosed 
dying tumor cells (or pathogens), presented their antigen in conjunction wit h MHC class II 
and have bound to their corr esponding T cell receptor (TCR) o n the surface of CD4+ T 
cells. In this setting, IL -[ADDRESS_96327] bei ng TCR recognition of 
antigen in MHC and the second being binding of co -stimulatory molecule CD 28 to B71. 
Similarly, CD8+ CTL function is also critically dependent on IL -[ADDRESS_96328] mechanism of antitumor activity of I L-2 may be mediated by 
[CONTACT_88302] (NK) cells7.  
 
While the exact mechanism of anti -tumor activity of HD IL -[ADDRESS_96329], molecularly targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_88281]. The reported RR for treatment with HD IL -2 (600,000 -800,00 0 
IU/kg q8h x 14 as tolerated) in multiple phase III trials ranges from 20% to 23.2% and the 
Protocol UMCC 2016. 103 
23AUG 2018 Confidential  10 CR ranges from 7% -9%. Among the subjects who achieve CR, >80% remained disease 
free at last follow -up with a median survival over [ADDRESS_96330] 
been tried withou t any improvement in outcome  8,10.  
 
There are significant but manageable toxicities from HD IL -2 affecting multiple organ 
systems. These side effects include hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, metabolic 
acidosis, fever, nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, edema, oliguria and renal  
failure, neurotoxicity, and dermatologic complications, and a mortality rate of less than 1% 
in recent trials.  
 
SELECT Trial:  
 
The Cytokine Working Group (CWG) designed and conducted t he HD IL2 “Select” Trial13. 
The primary objective of this prospective single -arm study was to evalu ate prospectively 
whether an integrated selection model (ISM) based on clear -cell histology and carbonic 
anhydrase -9 (CA -9) IHC staining could identify a group of patients with advanced RCC 
and “good” predictive features who were significantly more likely to respond to HD IL2 -
based therapy than a historical, u nselected patient population . During the course of this 
trial, retrospective analyses identified potential predictors of increased [e.g., programmed 
death -ligand 1 (PD -L1) expression, CA -9 gene SNP] an d decreased (e.g., elevated 
pretreatment levels of fibronectin and VEGF) response to immunotherapy in patients with 
RCC.  
 
One hundred and twenty eligible patients (of any histologic subtype of metastatic renal 
cell carcinoma type and no prior systemic ther apy) were enrolled; 70% were Memorial 
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center ([LOCATION_001], NY) intermediate risk, 96% had clear cell 
RCC, and 99% had prior nephrectomy. The independently assessed ORR was 25% 
(30/120, 95% CI, 17.5% –33.7%, P = 0.0014; 3 complete respons es (2.5%) , 27 partial 
responses  (22.5%)) and was higher than a historical ORR. Thirteen patients (11%) 
remained progression free at 3 years and the median overall survival was 42.8 months. 
ORR was not statistically different by [CONTACT_88303] (“good -risk” 23% vs. “poor -risk” 
30%; P = 0.39).  
 
Overall response rate was not associated with CA -9 SNP status or plasma VEGF or 
fibronectin levels (data not shown). Response was positively associated with tumor 
expression of PD -L1 (P = 0.01) and B7H -3 (P = 0.08; Table 3) by [CONTACT_88304] (23). 
Durable remission (PFS > 3 years) was positively associated with tumor expression of 
PD-L1 (P < 0.01) but not B7 -H3 (P = 0.73) by [CONTACT_88304].  
 
Data from the SELECT trial has led to the hypothesis that IL2 administr ation may be 
more effective in “inflamed” tumors that are infiltrated by [CONTACT_398]8+ T cells and express 
immune inhibitory molecules (e.g., PD -L1 or B7 -H3) but needs to be confirmed in 
prospective trials14.

Nivolumab:  
Tumor immune evasion is the norm in mRCC despi[INVESTIGATOR_88282] (TILs) and indeed is a hallmark of cancer14. The increasing 
understanding of immune checkpoints such as CTLA -4 and PD -1 that attenuate the anti -
cancer immune response has been clinically validated in multiple tumor types including 
RCC with the use of checkpoint inhibitors16-18.  
 
Nivolumab is a PD -1 checkpoint inhibitor, approved by [CONTACT_88305]. It is a fully human IgG4 programmed death 1 (PD -1) immune 
checkpoint inhibitor antibody that selectively blocks the interaction between PD -1, which 
is expressed on activated T cells, and PD -1 ligand 1 (PD -L1) and 2 (PD -L2), which are 
expressed on i mmune cells and tumor cells. Interaction between PD -[ADDRESS_96331] found significant increase in overall 
survival in patients treated with nivolumab, as compared to everolimus, with fewer grade 
3 or 4 adverse events21. 
 
Nivolumab has been investigated in a randomized phase III clinical trial in patients with 
advanced renal cell carcinoma, previously treated with one or two regimens of 
antiangiogenic therapy (N=821). Patients were randomized to receive nivolumab at 3 
mg/kg of body weight intravenously every [ADDRESS_96332] ratio for death with nivolumab versus everolimus was 0.73 (98.5% CI, 0.57 to 
0.93; P = 0.002), which met the pre -specified criterion for superiority (P≤0.0148). The 
objective response r ate was greater with nivolumab than with everolimus (25% vs. 5%; 
odds ratio, 5.98 [95% CI, 3.68 to 9.72]; P<0.001). The median progression -free survival 
was 4.6 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.4) with nivolumab and 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.5) 
with everolimus (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.03; P = 0.11). Grade 3 or 4 
treatment -related adverse events occurred in 19% of the patients receiving nivolumab 
and in 37% of the patients receiving everolimus; the most common event with nivolumab 
was fatigue (in 2%  of the patients), and the most common event with everolimus was 
anemia (in 8%).The results of this trial showed that nivolumab was efficacious in 
improving the overall survival with fewer adverse events, as compared to everolimus in 
patients with renal ce ll carcinoma.  
The following figures and table show the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in metastatic 
RCC.

1) We propose to descriptively profile the circulating T -cell repertoire by  [CONTACT_88307] w hole blood samples  at the time points listed in Section 
6.4 Time and Events T able. These studies will be hypothesis generating and could 
possibly guide timing and combination of immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_88284].  
2) We will archive patient tumor  and serum samples for future testing including but not 
limited to PD -L1 testing  and anti -drug antibody testing.

3.2.[ADDRESS_96344] SCREENING AND REGISTRATION PROCEDURE S 
After informed consent is obtained and PRIOR to the initiation of protocol therapy all patients 
satisfying the inclusion/exclusion criteria must have eligibility confirmed by [CONTACT_48876] . The patient will not be  considered registered and enrolled in the study until all information 
is confirmed by [CONTACT_5081]’s Multi -Site Coordinator .  
 
Patient registration for this trial will be centrally managed as described below:  
 
A potential study subject who has been screened for the trial and who has signed the Informed 
Consent document will be initially documented by [CONTACT_43887] a Screening and 
Enrollment Log.  
 
It is the responsibility of the local site investigato r to determine patient eligibility prior to submitting 
patient registration request to the Coordinating Center . After patient eligibility has been 
determined, a copy of the completed  Eligibility Worksheet together with all the pertinent de -
identified source documents will be submitted by [CONTACT_48836] , 
by [CONTACT_88312] -Onco [EMAIL_1775] .   
Protocol UMCC 2016. [ADDRESS_96345] start within 14 business days of enrollment to the study.  The 
interleukin -2 (Proleukin) and Nivolumab (Opdivo) will be stored and prepared as 
described in the approved labels.  
 
5.1.1 Therapy will start with high dose interleukin -2 (HD IL2) on week1 (day 1 -5) and 
again on week 3 (day 1 -5). Nivolumab will start on week 2 (optimally day 1 but 
can be given up to  3 weeks  after IL -2 start  but NOT  be on the same week as any 
HD IL2 cycle ) and continue every [ADDRESS_96346] fashion at a fixed dose of 600,000 
IU/kg /dose every 8 hours for a total of up to 14 doses (considered as one cycle ) 
over 5 consecutive days (D1-D5), followed by a 9-day break and then another 
cycle at the same dose over another 5 c onsecutive days (D15 -D19). Each HD IL -

the study over the years and will be used for this protocol23.  
 
Pre-medications  and concurrent medications : Per institutional guidelin es at each 
site usually include anti -emetics, anti -histamines, antipyretics/anti -inflammatory 
agents, anti -motility/anti -diarrheal agents, proton pump inhibitors, vasopressors 
as needed, medications for rigors as needed, hydration including boluses and 
maintenance fluids.  It is recommended but not mandated that subjects be given 
anti-emetics for as needed (prn) use after each IL -2 therapy week to treat 
residual nausea. Furosemide (a loop diuretic) may also be given per treating 
investigator’s discretion following each IL2 week. Please see IL -2 guidance 
document for more details.  
 
Subjects will undergo placement of a central venous catheter before each course 
or cycle of therapy per institutional pr eferences.  
 
NOTE: If the treating investigator determines another course of HD IL -[ADDRESS_96348]’s best interests, it is permissible and will be recorded in follow -up. If so, 
nivolumab should be held during IL2 weeks.  No protocol specified assessments 
are required for the repeat course.  
 
5.1.[ADDRESS_96349] dose of 480 mg /dose 
every 4weeks starting on week 2 (ideally  day 1 of week 2 but can be given up to 
3 weeks after IL -2 start but NOT  be on the same week as any HD IL2 cycle ) and 
continued as long as  clinical benefit  continues as determined by [CONTACT_88313]  [ADDRESS_96350] 3 patients will be treated with sequential (rather than interspersed) 
treatment. They will receive [ADDRESS_96351] fashion (two 5 -
day cycles one week apart) followed by [CONTACT_88314] -[ADDRESS_96352] 3 patients are treated and if 2/3 
patients suffer a grade 3 or 4 immune related toxicity, the study will stop. The 4th 
patient will not be enrolled until after the analysis of the 3 patient cohort is 
complete and submitted to the regulatory bodies

5.2 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
Any patient who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity . Each 
patient will be assessed for the development of toxicity ac cording to the Time and Events 
Table ( Section 6.4 ). Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Terminology  
Crite ria for Adverse Events (CTCA E), version 4.0. Dose adjustments should be made 
according to the system showing the greatest degree of toxicity .  
 
Dose modifications  in strength are not permitted for either IL2 or nivolumab.  
 
Dosing delays:  
 DURING IL -2 weeks  
 Individual  doses  of IL-2 within each cycle  may be skipped by [CONTACT_88315] . Skipped  doses will not be made up.  
 
 AFTER IL -2, BEFORE NIVOLUMAB  
 
 All toxicities (with the exception of fatigue ) attributed to IL -[ADDRESS_96354] resolved or recovered to grade 1 or resolved or to baseline prior to starting 
nivolumab  
 
 Fatigue should have recovered to grade 2 or better  
 
 If toxicities have not improved to the levels listed above, nivolumab and the 2nd 
cycle of IL -2 should be held until toxicities improve to the above levels  
 
 If nivolumab  or IL-2 is delayed >[ADDRESS_96355] 
be permanently  discontinued from study therapy with the following exception:  
 
o If a steroid taper (to manage drug -related adverse events) is the reason 
for treatment delay  of >[ADDRESS_96356]’s adverse events 
recover to grade 1 or better, continuation on study c ould be possible if 
approved by [CONTACT_458]  
 
 AFTER NIVOLUMAB, PRIOR TO 2nd  IL-2 CYCLE  
 All immune mediated toxicities should have recovered to grade 1 or better prior 
to starting the second dose of IL -2 and subjects should be off systemic steroids 
or on a dose of ≤ prednisone 10mg (or equivalent alternative steroid) . 
 
 Fatigue should have recovered to grade 2 or better  
 
 If specific toxicities  are of unclear attribution (including for example: diarrhea, 
increased LFTs, cardiovascular disorders, mental status changes, pulmonary 
disorders and rash) they should be treated  as possibly related to nivolumab and 
treated as per the tables in section 5. 2.2. These toxicities must improve to grade 
1 or better prior to proceeding with the second week of IL -2 therapy.  
 
 If toxicities have not improved to the levels listed above, nivolumab and the 2nd 
cycle of IL -2 should be held until toxicities improve to th e above levels

7.[ADDRESS_96393] - Solid Tumors  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) 
Committee [ JNCI  92(3):205 -216, 2000] . Changes in only the largest diam eter 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_96394] their response classified 
according to the definitions stated below . (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective 
disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_96395] one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of 
measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
 
 10mm by [CONTACT_3610] (irrespective of scanner type) for studies with a slice 
thickness of <5mm or twice the slice thickness or MRI 
 10mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be  
             accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as  
             non-measurable)          
 20mm by [CONTACT_13190] X -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776])  
                           
                         All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of     
                         centimeters).  
 
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a  lymph node must be ≥15mm in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_14216] (CT scan slice  thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At 
baseline and in follow -up, only  the short axis will be measured and fo llowed . 
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area are not  
considered measurable . 
 
Non-measurable disease . All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or  <[ADDRESS_96396] scan), are considered non -measurable disease . Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by 
[CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all non -measurable.  
 
Target l esions . All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
and 5 lesions in total should  be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the bas is of their 
size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organ, 
but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  
 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical s tructures 
which may be visible by [CONTACT_33490] . Pathological 
nodes which are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions 
must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥15mm by [CONTACT_3610]. Only the short axis 
of these no des will contribute to the baseline sum. The short axis of the node is 
the diameter normally used by [CONTACT_48861] a node is involved by [CONTACT_48862] . Nodal size is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained ( for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI 
the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal  or coronal). The smaller of these 
Protocol UMCC 2016. 103 
23AUG 2018 Confidential  39 measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node which is reported as 
being 20mm x 30mm has a short axis of 20mm and qualifies as a malignant,  
measurable node. In this example, 20mm should be recorded as the node 
measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10mm but <15 
mm) should be considered non -target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis 
<10mm are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, 
only the short axi s is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be 
used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor  regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease . 
 
Non-target l esions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including patholog ical 
lymph nodes should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should 
be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to foll ow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple non -target 
lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g. 
‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).  
7.1.3  Guidelines  for Evaluation of Measurable D isease  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if 
clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as 
possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the 
beginning of the treatment . 
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination 
unless the lesion(s ) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by 
[CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they 
are superficial and >10mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin 
nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_48863] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As noted above, 
when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_88324], imaging 
evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objecti ve and may also be 
reviewed at the end of the study.  
 
Chest X -ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when 
progression is an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, 
particularly in identifying new  lesions. However, lesions on chest X -ray may be 
considered measurable if they are  clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_14238].  
 
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure 
lesions  selected for response assessment. This guideline has def ined 
measurability of lesions on  CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice 
thickness is  5mm or less . When  CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 
mm, the minimum size  for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness. MRI is also accepta ble in  certain situations (e.g. for body scans).  
 
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not 
be used  as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be 
Protocol UMCC 2016. [ADDRESS_96397] in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor  
evaluation is not advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete 
pathological  response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in 
trials where recurrence  following complete response or surgical resection is an 
endpoint.  
 
Cytology, H istology: These techniques can be used to different iate between PR 
and CR  in rare cases . When effusions are  known to be a potential adverse effect 
of treatment, the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any  effusion 
that appears or worsens during treatment can be considered if the measurable  
tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease in order to differentiate 
between  response (or stable disease) and progressive disease.  
7.1.4  Response Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions, 
deter mined by [CONTACT_43897] 4 
weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions.  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline  
sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD 
of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since 
the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more ne w lesions.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
LD since the treatment started.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappe arance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  
 
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD) : Persistence of one or more 
non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of 
the treatment until disease progression/recu rrence (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
Protocol UMCC 2016. 103 
23AUG 2018 Confidential  41 treatment started) . The patient's best response assignment will depend 
on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of 
disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration” . Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of 
treatment.  
 
Note: If subjects respond to treatment and are able to have their disease 
resected, the patient’s response will be assessed prior to the surgery.  
7.1.5  Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response : The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since  the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively 
documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease : Stable disease is measured from th e start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
7.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from star t of 
treatment to time of progression.

8.2 Adverse Event  Reporting Requirements  
Adverse event  (AE) monit oring and reporting  is a routine  part of every clinical trial  and is 
done  to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those who will 
enroll in future studies using similar agents . Data on adverse events will be collected from 
the time of initial study treatment administration or intervention through [ADDRESS_96400] dose of study treatment  (study treatment here refers to the two possible cycles of  
interleukin -2 and/or last dos e of nivolumab up to 48 weeks of therapy , whichever is  later). 
Any serious adverse event that occurs more than [ADDRESS_96401] also be reported. Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs) will  continue to be followed until : 
 Resolution or the symptoms or signs that constitute the serious adverse event 
return to baseline;  
 There is satisfactory explanation other than the study treatment or intervention  
for the changes observed; or  
 Death.  
The inve stigator is responsible for the detection, docume ntation, grading and assignment 
of attribution of events meeting the criteria a nd definition of an AE or SAE. The definitions 
of AEs and SAEs are given below . It is the responsibility of the principal invest igator to 
ensure that all staff involved in the trial is familiar with the content of this section.  
Any medical condition or laboratory abnormality with an onset date before initial  study 
treatment administration or intervention is considered to be pre -existing in nature . Any 
known pre -existing conditions that are ongoing at time of study entry should be 
considered medical history.  
All events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE , as defined in Section 8.3,  
occurring from the initial study treatment  administration or intervention  through [ADDRESS_96402] dose of the study treatment (study treatment here refers to the two 
possible cycles of interleukin -2 and/or last dose of nivolumab up to 48 weeks of therapy  
whichever is later) or study intervention must be recorded as an adverse event in the 
patient’s source documents and on the CRF regardless of frequency, severity (grade) or 
assessed relationship to the study treatment or intervention.  
In addition to new events, any increase in  the frequency or severity ( i.e., toxicity grade) of 
a pre -existing condition that occurs after the patient begins study treatment or 
intervention  is also considered an adverse event.  
Protocol UMCC 2016. 103 
23AUG 2018 Confidential  43 8.3 Definitions  
8.3.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laborator y finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an experimental intervention, whether or not related to the intervention.  
 
 Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive (i.e. , surgical) 
procedures will not be reported as adver se events . However, the medical 
condition for which the procedure was performed must be reported if it meets 
the definition of an adverse event unless it is a pre -existing (prior to protocol 
treatment) condition.  
 
 Abnormal laboratory values or test results  constitute adverse events if they 
induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy.  They are to be captured 
under the signs, symptoms or diagnoses associated with them.  
8.3.2  Serious Adverse Event  
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator 
or Sponsor -Investigator , it results in any of the following outcomes:  
  
o Death  
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself.  
 
o A life -threatening adverse event  
An adverse even is considered ‘life -threatening’ if, in the view of either the 
investigator [or sponsor], its occurrence places the patient or subject at 
immediate risk of death . It does not include an adverse event that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
o Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88289] > [ADDRESS_96403] normal life functions  
 
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
o Important medical event  
Any event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical 
or surgical in tervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
of “Serious Adverse Event”. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home; convulsions that do not result in i npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4794].  
 
Previously planned (prior to signing the informed consent form) surgeries should 
not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has worsened 
during the course of the study.  
Protocol UMCC 2016. 103 
23AUG 2018 Confidential  44  
Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88290]’s medical history at the time of study enrollment 
should not be considered SAEs.   
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16500] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_88291] (for example, for the administration of study therapy (e.g. HD 
IL2) or other protocol -required procedure) should not be considered SAEs. 
However, if the preexisting condition worsened during the course of the study, it 
should be reported as an SAE.  
 
8.3.3  Expected Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” if:  
 For approved and marketed drugs or devices, those adverse events  are 
described in the approved Package Insert (Label).  
 For investigational new drugs or devices, those adverse events are 
described in the FDA Investigator’s Broc hure.  
 In clinical research studies, information on expected adverse events is 
also summarized in the protocol and in the consent document .  See 
section 9.[ADDRESS_96404] of expected adverse events related to the drug 
under study.  
8.3.4  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “unexpected” if it is not described in the 
Package Insert, Investigator’s Brochure, in published medical literature, in the 
protocol, or in the informed consent document.

23AUG 2018 Confidential  46  
Upon becoming aware of any incident, experience, o r outcome (not related to an adverse 
event) that may represent an unanticipated problem, the investigator should assess 
whether the incident, experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem . The 
incident, experience or outcomes is considered una nticipated if it meets all of the 
following criteria:  
 
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency);  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm  
than was previously known or recognized.  
If the investigator determines that the incident, experience, or outcome represents an 
unanticipated problem, the investigator must report it to the IRB within 14 calendar days  
of the study team becoming aware of t he problem.

11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a single arm phase Ib/II trial of Nivolumab and IL -2 in patients with Renal Cell 
Carcinoma. The phase Ib has a n endpoint of safety and the phase II primary endpoint is 
overall response rate (ORR = CR or PR) at 12 weeks.  A recently reported trial of 
Nivolumab after 1 prior therapy in RCC reported had an ORR of 25%.  With the addition 
of IL-2 treatment to nivolumab,  we hypothesize  an ORR of approximately 46% in this 
population.   
11.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints /Sample Size and Accrual  
For the phase 1b portion of the study : We will accrue an initial cohort of 3 patients who 
will be treated with sequential (rather than interspersed) treatment  as follows:  they will 
receive [ADDRESS_96418] fashion (two 5 -day cycles one week apart) 
followed by [CONTACT_88296] -[ADDRESS_96419] (see 5.2.1)  within  [ADDRESS_96420] dose of nivolumab  (DLT period ) the study will stop. The 4th patient will not be 
enrolled until after the analysis of the 3 patient cohort is complete and submitted to the 
regulatory bodies.  
 
If <2 patients suffer a grade 3 or 4 immune related toxicity in the cohort of 3 patients, the 
study will enroll 7 more patients treated with Nivolumab administered intravenously at 
480 mg /dose over [ADDRESS_96421] dose of nivolumab  (DLT period ). Up to 
[ADDRESS_96422] (as described in sec tion 5.2.1) we will pause the 
study and modify/discontinue the protocol in consultation with the site principal 
investigators and applicable regulatory authorities.  If [ADDRESS_96423] (see 5 .2.1) during the toxicity window,  
then the study will continue to the phase II portion.  
 
We cho ose to examine toxicity after [ADDRESS_96424] a DLT then the 95% exact binomial confidence interval (26% - 88%) will be > 
25% and be indicative that immune mediated toxicity with this regimen is too great.    
 
Dose -Limiting Toxicity  is defined as a grade [ADDRESS_96425] (as 
listed and described in section 5.2.1) . Please note: immune mediated event s of interest 
do not include those that might occur during high dose IL -2 and are reversible.    
 
DLT evaluable patients:  All patients who receive  at least [ADDRESS_96426] stage 
will accrue 12 patients  (including any response evaluable patients accrued in the phase 
1b portion). If more than [ADDRESS_96427] a response (CR or PR) out of the 12 patients , 
then we will accrue 11 more patients for a total sample size of 23 evaluable patients. If 
more than 8 responses (CR or PR) are observed  in the 23 e valuable patients , then we 
will recommend further study of the combination.  This design has 80% power and 10% 
type I error. If the true ORR of the combined treatment is 25% or less, the probability of 
early termination of the trial is 39%.  If the true OR R is 46% or greater, then the 
probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_88280] 3.6%.  Patients accrued in the Phase Ib portion of the 
trial will also be included in the Phase II if they are evaluable as defined below.  
 
Response Evaluable Patients:  All patients who r eceive at least [ADDRESS_96428] accrual to the entire study to be completed over a period of 24 months.  
11.2 Data Analyses Plans  
Primary Endpoint Analysis:   
Phase 1b: DLT count and proportion will be reported.  Type, grade and attribution will be 
described by [CONTACT_88330] 10 DLT evaluable patients.  Number of IL -2 cycles 
and doses and Nivolumab doses will be summarized.  
 
Phase II:  Overall response rate at 12 weeks will be reported with the sample size and 
proportion of evaluable patients and the  corresponding 95% exact binomial confidence 
interval.  
 
Secondary Endpoint Analyses:   
 
 Safety will be defined by [CONTACT_88331] -related grade [ADDRESS_96429] dose with the combination of HD IL2 and nivolumab, 
as assessed by [CONTACT_12134]’s CTCAE version 4.0.   Counts and frequencies will be reported by 
[CONTACT_6764], type and grade.   Cycles  and of each drug and doses/cycle of IL -2 will be 
described using descriptive statistics.  
 
Protocol UMCC 2016. 103 
23AUG 2018 Confidential  53  Survival endpoints are 24 -month Overall Survival (OS) and 24 -month Progression -Free 
Survival (PFS) as assessed by [CONTACT_393] 1.[ADDRESS_96430] -limit estimates from Kaplan -Meier methods will be used to report 
the 24 -month OS and PFS proportions with 95% confidence intervals.  Kaplan -Meier 
figures will be produced.  
 
 
Interim Analysis  for efficacy :  An interim analysis for effic acy is planned after [ADDRESS_96431] been enrolled (total in the phase I b/II portions) .  If [ADDRESS_96432] a response at 12 weeks then the trial will terminate.  . 
 
Analyses for correlative endpoints  
 
Flow Cytometry to profile circulating T cell repertoire including Tregs 
(CD4+/CD25+/FoxP3+) will be described graphically for pre -therapy and post -therapy.  
 
All study information should be recorded in an appropriate source document (e.g. clinic 
chart).  
 
Immunogenicity Analysis:  
Immunogenicity results will be analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_88327] . 
 
The immunogenicity titer and presence of neutralizing ADAs will be reported f or samples 
confirmed positive for the presence of ADAs. The effect of immunogenicity on efficacy, 
and safety will be evaluated, if the data allow.  
 
12.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  (DSM C) of The University of Michigan Rogel  
Cancer Center is the DSM C for this study. This committee is responsible for monitoring the 
safety and data integrity of the trial.  The committee will meet monthly (during the phase Ib  
portion) or quarterly (during the phase II portion) . 
 
 Until the phase Ib portion is completed i.e. the first [ADDRESS_96433] dose of nivolumab , a biweekly phone call/webinar 
involving site Principal I nvestigators/Sub -investigator(s) from each site and relevant 
research staff at each site will be conducted to exchange information about 
toxicity/safety, subject clinical course and discern trends if any. The site investigators 
are highly experienced in th e administration of HD IL2 and also, with nivolumab 
therapy.  
 
 At each site the study team is required to meet monthly (during the  phase Ib portion) or 
quarterly  (during the phase II portion) to discuss matters related to:  
 
o >Enrollment rate relative to expectations, characteristics of participants  
o >Safety of study participants (Serious Adverse Event & Adverse Event reporting)  
o >Adherence to protocol (protocol deviations)  
o >Completeness, validity and integrity of study data  
o >Retention of study participants  
 
 These meetings are to be documented by [CONTACT_88332] (DSMR), signed by [CONTACT_88333] [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -investigator .  Each site is required to submit the completed  DSMR to the 
Multi -Site Coordinator at the University of Michigan Coordinating Center  on a monthly (during 
Protocol UMCC 2016. 103 
23AUG 2018 Confidential  54 the phase Ib portion) or quarterly (during the phase II portion)  basis together with other 
pertinent documents . 
 
 Similarly, protocol deviations are to be documented using the Coordinating Center Deviation 
specified form  and requires the signatures of both the sites data manager or study 
coordinator and the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -investigator . These reports are to be sent 
to the University of Michigan Coordinating Center  within 7 calenda r days of awareness of the 
event and on a monthly (during the phase Ib portion) or quarterly (during the phase II portion)  
basis with the Protocol Specific Data and Safety Monitoring Report.  
 
 The Coordinating Center  is responsible for collating all the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Reports from all the participating sites, and providing the information to the Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee . 
 
13.[ADDRESS_96434] a  ‘for cause’ audit of the trial if the 
committee  identifies a need for a more rigorous evaluation of study -related issues.  
 
A regulatory authority (e.g. FDA) may also wish to conduct an inspection of the study, during its 
conduct or even after its completion. If an inspection has been requested by a regulatory 
authority, the site investigator must immediately inform the Coordinating Center  that such a 
request has been made.  
14.[ADDRESS_96435] be 
conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that are consistent with Good Clinical 
Practices (GCP) and in compliance with other applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
This study will be monitored by a representative of the Coordinating Center . Monitoring visits will 
be made during the conduct of the study and at study close -out. 
 
Prior to subject recruitment, a participating site will undergo site initiation meeting to be conducted 
by [CONTACT_88334] C enter . This will be done as an actual site visit; teleconference, 
videoconference, or web -based meeting after the site ’s IRB approval and fully executed 
subcontract has been received by [CONTACT_37377] -Site Coordinator .  The site’s principa l investigator and 
his study staff should make every effort in attending the site initiation meeting. Study –related 
questions or issues identified during the site initiation meeting will be followed -up by [CONTACT_88335].  
 
Monitoring of this study will include both ‘Centralized Monitoring’, the review of source documents 
at the Coordinating Center and ‘On -site Monitoring’, an actual site visit.  The first ‘Centralized’ 
visit should occur after the first subject enrolled completes first HD IL2 course (consisting of both 
weeks of IL2 ). The study site will send the de -identified source documents to the  Coordinating 
Center for monitoring.  ‘Centralized’ monitoring may be requested by [CONTACT_88336]. The site will send in pertinent de -
identified source documents, as defined by [CONTACT_3433] e Coordinating Center for monitoring.  
 
The first annual ‘On -site’ monitoring visit should occur after the first five study participants are 
enrolled or twelve months after a study opens, whichever occurs first.  The annual visit may be 
conducted as a ‘Centralized’ visit if less than three subjects have enrolled at the study site.  The 
type of visit is at the discretion of the Coordinating Center .  At a minimum, a routine monitoring 
visit will be done at least once a year, or once during the course of the study if the study duration 
is less than 12 months. The purpose of these visits is to verify:  
 
Protocol UMCC 2016. 103 
23AUG 2018 Confidential  55  Adherence to the protocol  
 Completeness and accuracy of study data and samples collected  
 Proper storage, dispensing and inventory of study medication  
 Compl iance with regulations  
 
During a monitoring visit to a site, access to relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88294].  While most 
patient cases will be selected from patients accrued since the previous monitoring visit, any 
patient case has the potential for review.  At least one or more unannounced cases will be 
revie wed, if the total accruals warrant selection of unannounced cases.  
 
The Coordinating Center expects the relevant investigational staff to be available to facilitate the 
conduct of the visit, that source documents are available at th e time of the visit, and that a 
suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related documents. Any issues identified 
during these visits will be communicated to the site and are expected to be resolved by [CONTACT_16547] 
a timely manner.  For rev iew of study -related documents at the Coordinating Center , the site will 
be required to ship or fax documents to be reviewed.   
 
Participating site will also undergo a site close -out upon completion, termination or cancellation of 
a study to ensure fulf illment of study obligations during the conduct of the study, and that the site 
Investigator is aware of his/her ongoing responsibilities. In general, a site close -out is conducted 
during a site visit; however, site close -out can occur without a site visit .  
15.0 DATA MANAGEMENT  
All information will be recorded locally and entered into Case Report Forms (CRFs) on the web -
based data management system of the University of Michigan. Online access will be provided to 
each site by [CONTACT_5081].  
 
CRFs will be reviewed and source verified by [CONTACT_43906]. Discrepant, unusual and incomplete data will be queried by [CONTACT_43907]. The 
investigator or study coordinator will be responsible for providin g resolutions to the data queries, 
as appropriate. The investigator must ensure that all data queries are dealt with promptly.  
 
The data submission schedule is as follows:  
 At the time of registration   
o Subject entry into the database  
 Subject Status  
 Demog raphics  
 During study participation  
o All data should be entered online within [ADDRESS_96436] be entered within the reporting 
timeframe specified in Section 8.5 of the protocol.  
  
Long term da ta will be collected periodically either by [CONTACT_88337].  
 
All study information should be recorded in an appropriate source document (e.g. clinic chart).

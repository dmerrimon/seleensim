3M-SPON -US-11-[ADDRESS_290639] been commercially available since 1998 with the introduction of 
Invisalign® Aligners that are an aesthetic alternative for orthodontic treatment. 3M Oral Care 
Solutions Division plans to expand the orthodontic aesthetic solutions portfolio by  [CONTACT_239532] 3M Clear Aligners for orthodontic treatment.  
 
The 3M™ Clear Aligner System is a series of clear lightweight plastic appliances (aligners) 
indicated for the treatment of tooth malocclusions in patients with permanent dentition (i.e. all  
second molars). By [CONTACT_14662] a series of incremental tooth movements, (torque, tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], rotation, 
bodily movements such as intrusion and extrusion) the 3M Clear Aligners sequentially re - 
position teeth by [CONTACT_239533].  
 
The 3M Clear Alig ner System may include attachments and/or buttons, which offer a solution 
for patients, who want an aesthetic treatment with a set of removable clear aligners that correct 
tooth malocclusions without the use of conventional wire and bracket orthodontic tec hnology.  
 
1.2 Risk/Benefit  Summary  
 
1.2.1 Risks  
 
Listed below are the potential and known risks with wearing the 3M Clear Aligners:  
 
• Gastrointestinal tract obstruction resulting from aligner fragments due to  aligner 
breakage, attachment and button  debond.  
• Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_19860] 3M Clear Aligner fragments resulting from breakage, attachment, 
button  debond.  
• Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_239526].  
• Choking due to 3M Clear Aligner fragments resulting from  breakage.  
• Choking due to atta chment or buttons resulting from breakage or bond  failure.  
• Gingival tissue and teeth may become sore and tender after initial  aligner 
placement and when placing each sequential 3M Clear  Aligner.  
• Speech may be affected when initially beginning treatment but should  be 
minimized in 2 weeks after beginning aligner  therapy.  
• Gums, cheeks, and lips may be abraded or irritated by [CONTACT_941] 3M Clear  Aligners, 
attachments or  buttons  
• Swollen and inflamed gums or tongue while wearing the 3M Clear  Aligners.  
• Enamel damage due to hard debris in aligner or due to removal of tight aligner.  
• Staining of teeth due to poor hygiene, food debris in 3M Clear Aligner, or 
consumption of sugary liquids, or beverages that may cause stains on teeth, i.e. 
coffee,  wine.

• Caries, decalcification periodontal  disease and permanent stains may occur if 
consistent and proper oral hygiene such as brushing and flossing are not 
performed as  recommended.  
• Decalcification, and periodontal disease caused by [CONTACT_239534] d/or drinking  sugary 
foods and beverages while wearing the 3M Clear  Aligner.  
• Tooth  root damage  due to tooth  movement  too fast or beyond  bond  while  wearing 
the 3M Clear Aligner.  
• The bite may change during the course of treatment resulting in temporary 
discomfort.  
• The bite may require additional adjustments at the end of  treatment.  
• Temporary increase in salivation or dryness of mouth may  occur.  
• Temporal -mandibular joint (TMJ) pain, headaches or ear problems may  occur.  
• Existing dental restorations may become dislodged while removal of tight aligner.  
• Failure to wear the appliance for the prescribed number of hours per day or in  the 
prescribed order and/or not using the 3M Clear Aligner as directed may lengthen 
the treatme nt time and affect the final treatment  outcome.  
• Relapse of teeth after treatment due to the failure of not wearing the  retainers.  
• Attachment debonds which will require rebonding the attachment during  an 
additional  appointment  
• Button  debonds  require  rebonding  the attachment  during  an additional 
appointment  
• Aligners may become  damaged  
• Redness,  swelling  to gums,  lips, due to sensitization  to attachment  composite 
material  
• Toxicity from exposure to uncured attachment  material.  
• Cuts to gingiva,  tongue,  lips due to sharp  or rough  surface  of attachment  material.

For children under 18 years of age:  
Prior to entering the study, the Investigator or qualified designee will explain to each legal 
parental custodian the nature of the study, its purpose, procedures, expected duration, and the 
benefits and risks involved in study participation. The study sho uld also be explained to all 
subjects regardless of age to the fullest extent possible. Each legal parental custodian will be 
given an information and consent document and ample opportunity to ask questions. The legal 
parental custodian(s) will be informed  of the subject’s right to withdraw from the study at any 
time without prejudice. Subjects should also be given the opportunity to ask questions and be 
informed of their right to withdraw from the study. After this explanation and before any study - 
specifi c procedures have been performed, subjects may voluntarily assent to enroll in the study 
(the age of assent will be determined by [CONTACT_1201], consistent with local laws, generally 7 years 
of age) and their legal parental custodian(s) may voluntarily sign and  date an informed consent

● Device -related adverse event (adverse device effect)  is an AE considered by [CONTACT_239543]  a reasonable  likelihood  of being associated  with the treatment 
device.  
 
● Serious adverse device effect  is a device effect that has a serious adverse effect on health 
or safety causing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13266], or is life threatening or 
causes  death.  
 
● Adverse drug experience  is an AE that is considered by [CONTACT_95334] a

● Serious adverse drug experience  is an adverse drug experience that is fatal or life - 
threatening,  requires  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40088],

degree of incidence in the Protocol or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that 
relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
All adverse events will be followed until they are resolved or for [ADDRESS_290692]’s 
participation in the study ends.  
 
Recording and Reporting  
 
The Inve stigator records each material -related adverse event on an Adverse Device Effect 
Record . Documentation includes the description, severity, seriousness, date of onset and 
resolution, relationship to the treatment material, action taken and outcome.  
 
The Investigator must promptly report an adverse device effect to the 3M study monitor. If the 
adverse device effect is also considered by [CONTACT_239544]/or unanticipated, 
the Investigator must report it to the IRB as soon as possible and w ithin IRB requirements.  
 
A serious AE involving a non -3M commercialized product is reported to the 3M study monitor 
and IRB of record.  
 
If a subject has no adverse device effect during the study, the absence of such must be recorded 
on the CRF.  
 
9. Statistics  
 
The primary efficacy dataset will include all subjects enrolled who have worn at least one set or 
first stage of 3M Clear Aligners in the study. The primary dataset will be referred to as the full 
analysis set or FAS.  
 
A secondary efficacy dataset will be defined as the per protocol or PP dataset. This PP dataset 
will exclude subjects with major protocol deviations that will affect efficacy assessment of the 
3M Clear Aligners. The major deviations that will lead to exclusion from the PP dataset will  be 
fully documented and justified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) and/or pre -lock data 
meeting minutes. Two major protocol deviations that will lead to PP exclusion include 
significant non -compliance with aligner wear and not completing treatment d ue to non - 
treatment -related reasons (e.g. unexpectedly moving out of state). In general, a subject’s failure 
to complete treatment due to strongly anchored teeth will be considered a treatment failure.

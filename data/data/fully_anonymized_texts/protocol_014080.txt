August 25, [ADDRESS_378936] of Evolocumab on Coronary Endothelial Function [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
  
1.  Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)   
  
To evaluate the effect of the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab on coronary 
endothelial function, systemic biomarkers of inflammation, and LDL cholesterol in people 
living with HIV (PLWH). Potential participants will be asked to undergo a screening MRI 
exam.  Those who have evidence of coronary endothelial dysfunction on the MRI exam 
will receive evolo comab 420 mg sq (the dose that is approved for treatment of 
hypercholesterolemia) following the screening exam and again at one month. The 
evolocumab will be administered by [CONTACT_309229]+ group.  Repeat MRI meas ures of coronary endothelial function, and serum 
markers of endothelial function and inflammation will be obtained at one and six weeks 
following the first administration of evolocumab.    
  
We will test the hypotheses that PCSK9 inhibition improves endoth elial function 
measured non -invasively on MRI and systemic markers of inflammation at one week  
and six  weeks after initiation of the PCSK9 antibody in PLWH.   
  
Primary Endpoint :   
  
Coronary endothelial function at 1 week and 6 weeks following initiatio n of PCSK9 
inhibitor administration; specifically, change in coronary artery cross sectional area 
(CSA) from that at rest to that during isometric handgrip exercise (IHE) stress (as mm2 
and as % rest) at 1 week and 6 weeks. We will be evaluating the change  in endothelial 
function from baseline to one week and from baseline to six weeks.  
  
Secondary Endpoints:   
  
1. Change in coronary blood flow (CBF) from rest to that during IHE stress (% rest 
and as ml/min) from baseline to one week and from baseline to six  weeks.  
2. Change in inflammatory markers (e.g. hsCRP, IL -6, soluble) and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_309223].  
  
  
Also, the relationship between change in inflammatory markers/lipi[INVESTIGATOR_309224].   
  
  
2.  Background (briefly describe pre -clinical and clinical data, current experience 
with procedures, drug or device, and  any other relevant information to justify the 
research)  
  
Increased systemic inflammation and altered lipid metabolism are two factors 
which play important roles in atherogenesis, both in the general population and in HIV+ 
individuals.  Lipid abnormaliti es are common in HIV infected individuals and may 
contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in this population. HIV infection itself and 
its treatment with antiretroviral therapy can alter lipid metabolism and both are associated 
with higher LDL chol esterol and triglyceride levels.  In addition, HIV infection is marked 
by [CONTACT_309230], which correlates with the presence and extent of 
Effect of Evolocumab on Coronary Endothelial Function [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
  
atherosclerosis, and although systemic inflammatory markers are reduced by [CONTACT_309231], they 
are not reduced  to normal levels15-18.  Although statins have antiinflammatory properties 
and lower CV mortality in the general population, their use is often problematic in the HIV 
population due to frequent drug interactions and concurrent liver disease.  Importantly, 
CV event rates remain high in HIV+ patients on statin therapy19, [ADDRESS_378937] to probe the critical early mechanisms contributing to CAD, namely coronary 
endothelial dysfunction.  However, recent advances by [CONTACT_309232] -invasively quantify coronary endothelial function (CEF) and therefore 
better understand the role of inflammation in coronary atherosclerosis.   
  
3. Study Procedures   
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures    
(distinguish research procedures from those that are part of routine care).  
  
  The following are research procedures:  
  
HIV positive subjects:   
  
All of the procedures described below are research procedures.  
  
  Research study of the effect of PCSK9 inhibition in 20 HIV+ subjects ( with LDL 
cholesterol > 70 mg/dl) involving (1) subcutaneous administration of two doses of 
evolocumab, ([ADDRESS_378938] dose).   For 
this population, we had an FDA exemption for the off label use of evolocumab in this 
study, and the medication will be provided and administered by [CONTACT_309233].  HIV+ participants on stable, clinically -guided ART an d 
meeting entry criteria will undergo baseline assessment of serum inflammatory 
mediators, as well as PCSK9 activity, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], MRI quantification of local coronary 
endothelial function (CEF). Those subjects with abnormal CEF, defined by [CONTACT_309234] ≤5% from the resting value, will qualify and enter the study. 
Subjects will then receive evolocumab [ADDRESS_378939] dose (2 weeks after the second administration).  There will be a  
final safety assessment performed at week 10 (6 weeks after final dose given).      
  
Initial evaluation:  A careful history and physical examination will be performed. Blood 
samples will be acquired for complete blood cell count, routine chemistry panel i ncluding 
hepatic transaminases and creatinine, LDL and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. 
Serum markers reflective of  inflammation and endothelial function will include serum 
hsCRP, IL -6, TNF α, IFN -γ, and PCSK9 level. Patients will also be tested for hepa titis C 
Effect of Evolocumab on Coronary Endothelial Function [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
  
(Hepatitis C Antibody test) if Hep C status is unknown from clinical records. If the patient 
is found to have positive reactivity to Hep C Antibody or is previously known to be Hep C  
positive (from clinical chart review using same criteria), then HCV RNA level in blood will 
be quantified as part of research procedure.     
  
MRI methods for Coronary Vasoreactivity: an index of CEF: Patients will undergo a 
detailed baseline MRI study of CEF in the fasting state using MRI methodology at rest and 
durin g continuous IHE as previously described 28. The MRI study will be used to measure 
coronary cross -sectional area (CSA), coronary flow velocity (CFV), and coronary blood 
flow (CBF) changes in response to IHE stress (continuous isometric handgrip for 4 -8 min  
at 30% of each subject’s maximum, determined prior to entering the MRI), as previously 
reported29,28.   
  
Fasting:   Subjects will be asked to fast after midnight and delay eating breakfast and 
taking morning cardiovascular medicines until after the study procedure, which will be 
completed by [CONTACT_18828].   
  
MRI analysis : MR images will be analyzed in blinded fashion without operator knowledge 
of time or treatment group for CEF (e.g. changes in CBF, CBV, and CSA) as previously 
validated and described 28. Baseline , 1-week and [ADDRESS_378940] by [CONTACT_309235].  
  
Blood Draw and Analysis: Blood samples will be o btained from a peripheral vein using 
standard venipuncture techniques and will be sent for routine chemistries (basic 
metabolic panel and liver function tests, CBC) and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].  Biomarkers will be analyzed 
from blood specimens collected into collection tub es without anticoagulant and 
centrifuged within 1 hour after collection (to allow time for clotting) using a centrifuge with 
an integrated refrigeration system at 4°C/1000 g for 15 min and stored at -80°C.  
Analyses will be performed with ELISA or multiple xed ELISA including the following 
biomarkers of inflammation/activation/clotting: hsCRP, IL -6, TNF α, IFN -γ, PCSK9 activity 
and CD163.32 In addition, comprehensive lipid panel will be measured. To minimize 
variability of assays of longitudinal markers, the baseline, 1 - and 6 -week specimens of 
each individual will be analyzed on the same plate.   
  
Safety surveillance : Patients will undergo surveillance safety monitoring at 1 week, 4 
weeks (before 2nd dose of PCSK9 inhibitor is given to HIV+ participants) and  6 weeks 
that will include detailed history, physical exam and complete blood count. In the HIV+ 
group, liver and renal function tests will additionally be performed, and there will be a [ADDRESS_378941] do se of drug is given.  
Members of the research team will review laboratory results from a safety standpoint.   
  
Follow up End -point Evaluation: After [ADDRESS_378942] dose (and two weeks after the second dose) of PCKS9 inhibitor administration, 
subjects will undergo repeat clinical evaluation, lipid and inflammatory biomarker analysis, 
as well as coronary MRI  with the same protocols used at baseline. In terms of MRI follow 
up exams (at weeks 1 and 6) coronary MRI will be repeated with an identical protocol and 
special attention taken to interrogate the same coronary segments as those studied at 
Effect of Evolocumab on Coronary Endothelial Function [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
  
baseline, using  anatomic landmarks of coronary ostia and branch vessels - as we have 
done in the past.  
  
List of study procedures (HIV+ group):   
  
1) Visit 1 (Screening Visit) : includes Informed Consent, History and physical 
examination, vital signs (temperature, blood p ressure, heart rate, weight, height), 
blood draw (CBC, CMP, Lipid panel, Hepatitis C Antibody Test if HCV status is 
unknown, HCV Quant PCR if known HCV positive, serum biomarkers of 
inflammation (above). MRI Screening questionnaire, cardiac MRI, If patient  
qualifies (based on MRI and entry criteria), the subject will receive PCSK9 inhibitor 
(this will be administered by a qualified study team member)  
Visit 2 (Baseline Visit)  Subject will return for medical history reviewed for 
changes, concomitant medicati ons, vital signs, 1st Dose of Evolocumab will be 
given by [CONTACT_15328].  
Visit 3 (1 Week after Evolocumab is started): Subject will return for  physical 
examinations, concomitant medications,  vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, 
heart rate, weight), moni tor for adverse events, blood draw (CBC, CMP, Lipid 
panel, serum biomarkers of inflammation/activation/clotting: hsCRP, IL -6, TNF α, 
IFN-γ, PCSK9 activity), MRI Screening questionnaire, cardiac MRI  
Visit 4 : Subject will return 4 weeks after initial dose for safety assessment and to 
receive 2nd and final dose of evolucomab, review concomitant medications, and 
monitor for adverse events, measurement of vital signs (temperature, blood 
pressure, heart rate, wei ght).  
Visit 5  (6 Weeks after Evolocumab started)  Subject will return 6 weeks after 
initial PCSK9 inhibitor given for physical examination, concomitant medications, 
vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, weight), monitor for adverse 
events, blood draw (CBC, CMP, Lipid panel, serum biomarkers of inflammation), 
cardiac MRI.  Subjects will receive a phone call follow for safety assessment at 
week 10.   
  
Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_309225] s ignificant laboratory 
abnormalities will be evaluated and the scheduled second (final) study drug dose withheld. 
Participants who experience significant symptoms will be evaluated and those or others 
who develop new laboratory abnormalities will be reviewe d and labs possibly repeated.  If 
any of the following criteria are met (CBC<2000, platelets<50,000, Hct<27%, GFR 
<30ml/min or a >50% reduction in GFR compared to baseline values, and LFTs >3x upper 
limit of normal), the test would be repeated. If confirme d on repeat, the second (and final) 
dose of the drug would not be given (HIV+ group). If the abnormality resolves, study drugs 
would be given at the same or lower dose. If the abnormality does not resolve, then the 
case will be reviewed for discontinuation  from the study. Based on the clinical status, 
severity of the problem, and reversal of symptoms/laboratory findings, a decision will be 
made as to whether the study drug (2nd and final dose) can be started under close 
observation (weekly surveillance) or the patient withdrawn from the study. For every study 
participant who withdraws, we plan to recruit an additional subject so that the overall 
sample size of those completing the study is close to [ADDRESS_378943] of Evolocumab on Coronary Endothelial Function [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

5. Study Statistics  
  
a. Primary outcome variable. Change in endothelial function,spe cifically, change 
in coronary cross sectional area (CSA) from rest to that during IHE stress, from 
baseline to one week and from baseline to six weeks.  
b. Secondary outcome variables.   
(i) Change in coronary artery blood flow (CBF) (from rest to IHE 
stress (as ml/min and as % rest) from baseline to one week and 
from baseline to six weeks.  
(ii) Inflammatory markers (hsCRP), LDL cholesterol at 1 and 6 weeks 
and change in these measures between baseline and 1 week and 
baseline and 6 weeks.   
  
To make full use of the data, changes in CEF from baseline to 1 - and 6 -weeks will be 
analyzed, changes in inflammatory biomarkers and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (hsCRP and LDL cholest erol) 
from baseline to 1 - and 6 -weeks. Also, the relationship between change in inflammatory 
markers and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_81059] 1 and to 6 weeks and change in CEF between baseline 
and 1 and 6 weeks will be quantified.   
  
Safety endpoints : metabolic panel  and complete blood count, withdrawal due to 
sideeffects SAEs and all AEs  
  
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and interim data analysis.  
  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_309227], if any, of the initiation of PCSK9 
antibody  on coronary endothelial function (CEF) and the relationship between any change 
in CEF and change in inflammatory mediators.  However, it is possible, based on prior 
studies conducted by [CONTACT_309238] a significant change in CEF will be observed and 
it is very likely that we will observe changes in inflammatory markers and mediators over 
the six week study period.  The principal outcome of this observational study of the effects 
Effect of Evolocumab on Coronary Endothelial Function [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
  
of evolocumab on CEF and inflammatory mediators in subjects with abnormal CEF is the 
change in CSA from rest to IHE at 1 and 6 weeks.  We chose to study the change in CSA 
because it 1.) reflects both macrovascular changes related to the endothelial -dependent 
IHE stressor, 2.) CEF reflected by [CONTACT_309239] d in HIV+ subjects 
compared to healthy subjects 3.) is reproducible over this proposed time period, and 4.) 
because endothelial function is an independent predictor of atherosclerotic progression 
and clinical events 33-37. The [ADDRESS_378946] 
is present. Drugs that improve cardiovascular outcomes improve endothelial function in 
fewer than 8 weeks39. An increase in the IHECSA response in subjects to approximately 
30% of that of healthy subjects does not as sume complete normalization of CEF in 
participants with evolocumab but, instead, an increase that would be biologically 
significant and consistent with the changes in endothelial function observed with 
medications shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes. F or example, a landmark study 
demonstrated that statins improve CEF in CAD patients to approximately half of 
normal/maximal responses 40. In studies of subjects with CAD risk factors, comparisons 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_309228] ~50% or more in 
CAD patients 41-44. A similar 50% increase in endothelial function was also observed in 
HIV+ people treated for [ADDRESS_378947] of established cardiovascular medications (statins, ACE -I) on endothelial 
function and based on our observations of differences in coronary endothelial function 
between HIV+ and HIV - individuals (CSA increas es during IHE in healthy subjects 
+12% ±5% (mean ±SD) and does not increase in HIV+ or CAD patients, change of  -
2%±6% (mean ±SD), we propose that there will be an increase to 4% CSA change with 
IHE (i.e. approximately 33% of the normal 15% increase in CSA with IHE we observe in 
healthy individuals) in the evolocumab -administered subjects.   We assume that at 6 
weeks:   
  
(1) Mean CS A will increase from -2% change from rest to IHE in subjects at baseline 
to +4% CSA change on evolocumab at 1 - and 6 weeks.   
(2) Mean CBF will increase from -3% (CBF change from rest to IHE) in subjects at 
baseline to +15% (from rest to IHE, which represents improvement of CBF to about 
1/3 of normal "healthy" CBF response) in subjects on evolocumab at week 1 and 
week 6.   
(3) Standard deviation (variability) of 6% for study subjects  
  
 The variability is conservatively based on the mean standard deviation in CSA 
response observed in the HIV+ population and in CAD subjects. With a sample size of 18, 
we will have power of 90% (alpha=0.05, two -sided test) to detect such a difference in CSA -
IHE response between the baseline and study follow up time points (1 - and 6 we eks)46. 
We will conservatively assume a 10% dropout rate over [ADDRESS_378948] of Evolocumab on Coronary Endothelial Function [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
  
Participants who experience significant symptoms will be evaluated and those or 
others who develop laboratory abnormalities will have the study drug withheld. Based on 
the clinical status, severity of the problem, and reversal of symptoms/laboratory findin gs, 
a decision will be made as to whether the study drug can be restarted under close 
observation (weekly surveillance) or the patient withdrawn from the study. Participants 
who wish to end participation in the trial at any time may do so upon request with out 
penalty. Because this is a short pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will attempt to recruit an additional subject 
for any that withdraws so that our target sample size of n=18 of those completing the study 
is met.

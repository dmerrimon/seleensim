CASE [ADDRESS_397270] 
procedure today for treatment of localized renal carcinoma is radical nephrectomy. Radical 
nephrectomy involves complete removal of Gerota's fascia and its contents, including the kidney 
and the adrenal gland, and provides a better surgical margin than simple removal of the kidney. 
 
Laparoscopic nephrectomy is a less invasive procedure for the removal of kidneys with a small 
volume of RCC2,3,4. 
 
Radio surgical ablation of renal tumors offers a noninvasive alternative for   treatment of renal 
malignancies. Radiosurgery is precisely delivered pi[INVESTIGATOR_321900]-fractionated high-dose radiation in an attempt to ablate the 
kidney cancer. 
 
In an initial preclinical evaluation, radiosurgery for extracorporeal renal tissue ablation was very 
promising and demonstrated its ability to ablate a targeted area precisely and completely with 
relative sparing of the surrounding tissue5. 
 
C
linical experience with radiosurgery for renal tumors is limited. In a recent report6 20 patients, 
age ranged from 31 to 85 years (mean 62), had 27 cancers treated with a volume ranging from 
2.4 to 1366cc (mean 367cc). Patients were most commonly treated with 8 Gy times 5 fractions. 
The control rate was 93% with follow-up ranging from 2 to 45 months (mean 12 months). The 
survival or regrowth of tumor vasculature has been suggested to be a major determinant of 
radiation responses (Huang 2010 and Du 2012).  
 
To evaluate each patient’s prognostic potential we will measure MIF (both MIF-1 and MIF-2) 
and VEGF levels before and after radiation therapy to determine if these serum markers may 
give a predictive indication of tumor response.  
 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES 
 
Primary objective :  To evaluate and compare the clinical safety of utilizing four different 
schemes of radiosurgical ablative techniques for treating poor surgical candidates with renal 
tumors. 
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol 01.24.2017  Page 6 of 16 Secondary Objective:  To evaluate and compare the clinical and radiographic efficacy of four 
different schemes of radiosurgical ablation of renal tumors in poor surgical candidates. 
 
Serum Blood Marker Objective :  To determine if serum markers collected before and after 
radiation may give a predictive indication of tumor response. 
 
 
3.0 PATIENT SELECTION 
  
  Conditions for Patient Eligibility 
 P atient is considered a poor surgical candidate for removal of renal mass as 
determined by [CONTACT_321912]-operative assessment or the surgical team, or 
medical team.  (No major psychiatric illnesses.) 
 P atient is > 18 years of age. 
 P atient is able to give and sign study specific informed consent. 
 No pr ior radiation to the treatment field.  
 Ne gative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to registration for 
women of childbearing potential. 
 Patient has a radiologically and /or pathologically confirmed diagnosis of a renal 
tumor  
 Karnofsky status of ≥ 60% 
 S igned study-specific informed consent prior to study entry. 
 
All/any clinical, radiological and pathological data for the patient will be reviewed and the study 
investigators will assess suitability for treatment with radio-surgical technique.  If the eligibility 
criteria are met, the patient will be scheduled for a treatment planning session. 
 
Conditions for Patient Ineligibility 
 An y patient not meeting the eligibility criteria. 
 An y patient with active connective tissue disease such as lupus, dermatomyositis. 
 An y patient with active Crohn’s disease or active ulcerative colitis. 
 Ma jor psychiatric illness, which would prevent completion of treatment or 
interfere with follow-up. 
 
 
4.0 PRE-TREATMENT EVALUATIONS 
 
 Hist ory and physical and KPS (Appendix 1).  
 Patients have confirmed renal mass on imaging.  The patients will be registered through 
the Seidman Cancer Center Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) in Oncore.  Preoperative testing 
will be done to assess the patient's eligibility for radio-surgical treatment, locate the 
tumor, and evaluate its accessibility by [CONTACT_321913].   
 Imaging of the kidney will be obtained to evaluate the kidney prior to planning by [CONTACT_321914].  Fiducial markers will be placed 
CASE [ADDRESS_397271] and 
abdomen should be obtained for staging prior to treatment. 
 Mult iple percutaneous needle biopsies of the renal tumor will be obtained under 
radiological guidance. After the biopsies are obtained, 2-3 fiducials may be placed in or 
near the tumor via the 18 gauge needle, for image guidance purposes, alternatively, 
fiducial placement may be performed as a separate procedure in patients having 
pathology confirmed disease at the time of presentation for radiation therapy planning.  
 I t is preferable that the patient have their pathology review done at University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320632]. 
 All clinical, radiological and pathological data for the patient will be reviewed and 
suitability for treatment with radio surgical technique will be assessed.  If the eligibility 
criteria are met, the patient will be registered in the study after obtaining informed 
consent. 
 R adiological work up will be performed to evaluate for metastatic disease if clinically 
indicated. 
 R adiological work up will be performed to evaluate baseline renal function prior to the 
start of radiation therapy if clinically indicated. 
 
 
5.0 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES

of patient immobilization for each radiation treatment will conform to institutional practice.  
 
S
erum Blood Markers: 
Patients will be asked to participate in ELISA blood testing just prior to and immediately 
following each daily radiation therapy session. Approximately 5cc of blood will be collected 
CASE [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol 01.24.2017  Page 8 of 16 within 2 hours prior to and following completion of fractionated radiation therapy to assess the 
levels of MIF (both MIF-1 and MIF-2) and VEGF. This whole blood will be separated into 
plasma and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_321901] -[ADDRESS_397274] for response to therapy 
with new tumor markers. 
 
Radiation Doses : 
Radiation will be delivered in 4 fractions. The initial dose level will be 6 Gy per fraction to a 
total dose of 24 Gy in 4 fractions. Doses will be escalated at 2 Gy per fraction increments to 12 
Gy per fraction to a total dose of 48 Gy. The radiation treatment planning and evaluation details 
are appended.  
 
Series I:   
Twenty patients who are not surgical candidates will be offered treatment with a radio-surgical 
technique.  Four patients will be registered in each dose group.  Treatments will be initiated with 
4 patients utilizing the minimum dose and observe what happens. If no DLTs are observed, then 
escalation to the next set of 4 patients to the next initial dose level will occur. If 1 DLT is 
observed, treatment of the next set of 4 patients at the same dose level will occur. If zero or 1 
additional DLTs are observed, then dose escalation occurs as previously described. However, if 
> 2/4 or > 3/8 are observed at a given dose level the trial stops. On average, this results in 
between 4-5 patients being treated before escalation. The table below shows the probability of 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_321902].

would be used for example in Lung cancer. Given the 90% expectant local control for lung 
CASE [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol 01.24.2017  Page 9 of 16 lesions given 20 Gy in 3 fractions, we are highly anticipating reaching an efficacious dose during 
series II of the trial.  If the 12 Gy x 4 fraction cohort is irradiated without dose limiting toxicities, 
then 12 additional patients will be accrued for further dose escalation following dose toxicity 
criteria defined below:   
Based on the Linear Quadratic Model commonly used for radiobiologic comparisons, each 
subsequent group of four participants will receive further dose escalation using a 3 fraction 
regimen to increase beyond 48 Gy in 4 fractions in 20% dose equivalent increments.  
 
The first group of four patients at this level (Series II) will receive 48 Gy to the target volume 
(tumor) in [ADDRESS_397276] group of four patients will be treated to 60 Gy in 3 fractions of 20 Gy each.    
 
It is important to note that dose to the normal tissues surrounding the target has not been allowed 
to dose escalate.   Tolerance levels selected for these normal organs (see Table I. and Appendix 
I., are consistent with RTOG standards and normal tissue limits approved for UHCMC Protocol 
Case [ZIP_CODE] associated with Prostate Cancer with Cyberknife or Linac based SBRT irradiation.

retreatment, they will be taken off study.     
 
Radiation Toxicity: 
All patients should be seen at 1, 3 and 6 months ± [ADDRESS_397279] SBRT, the patient will be scheduled to be seen in Urology to evaluate their response 
to the therapy with imaging and an optional biopsy. Urinary and bowel irritation manifested as 
urgency, frequency, dysuria, infection and incontinence will be recorded. Medications to treat 
radiation side-effects will be recorded as well as dose and frequency. Acute Radiation Toxicity 
(<180 days from treatment date) will be documented using NCI common toxicity criteria, 
version 4.0. A shorter period of toxicity assessment for the purposes of dose escalation will be 
used. This will be done at the 1, 3 and 6 month follow-up visits after radiation therapy. More 
delayed short-term toxicities would be used in the final determination of the recommended Phase 
II dose. 
  
Dose limiting Toxicity :  
Acute Radiation Toxicity ≥ grade 3 in the Gastrointestinal and renal/genitourinary categories of 
the common terminology criteria for adverse events 4.0 (CTCAE) will be considered dose 
limiting (see above).  The maximum tolerated dose will be one dose level below which the 
adverse event, as described above, occurred (See statistical section).

(regardless of which group the subject is placed into).  Costs for pre-treatment diagnostic scans, 
radiation therapy treatments, and post-operative follow-up are also standard of care and will be 
charged accordingly. Therefore, subjects and their insurers will be fully responsible for the costs 
related to this research evaluating and comparing standard of care procedures.  Subjects will not 
be paid for their participation in this study. 
 
 
11.[ADDRESS_397286] for any individual 
patient as a purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the four options.  
 
The use of radiation in any form is also associated with a small risk of causing another cancer, 
either in the portion of the body directly exposed to radiation during treatment (the target of 
treatment), or in other sites of the body due to low doses of scattered radiation.  Depending on 
which category a subject is assigned, the risk may be greater or smaller for one subject than for 
others in the study. 
 
Because radiosurgery for treating a kidney tumor is a very new approach, there may be other 
risks that we are not yet aware of, some of which could potentially be severe. 
 
All data entered into the computer will be coded and personal identifiers will be removed.  All 
data that can be linked to an individual will be protected and the master list will be stored off-line

S
hould any unanticipated adverse device events occur during the course of the study, the clinical 
research coordinator will ensure that they are documented by [CONTACT_321917][INVESTIGATOR_321908] (UHCMC IRB) per 
its then-current guidelines.  An unanticipated adverse event is defined by [CONTACT_321918]-threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence in the protocol (including a supplementary plan), or any other 
unanticipated serious problem with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects.  If the determination is made that an unanticipated adverse event presents an 
unreasonable risk to subjects, the clinical evaluation will be paused, or if deemed appropriate (to 
enable further investigation), the subject will be withdrawn as soon as safely possible.   
 
Adverse events, grade 2 and above, will be captured in OnCore and will be reported in 
accordance with the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) that is approved by [CONTACT_321919] (and aligned with the NCI-approved plan).  
All monitoring and reporting will be compliant with policies presented in the most current 
version of the CCCC Clinical Trials Operations Manual, so that an independent assessment can 
be made of study activities.  The study will be updated to remain compliant with any changing 
rules/policies of the CCCC. 
  
All 
serious adverse events (SAE’s), and IRB continuing renewals including review of toxicity 
will be promptly submitted to the University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321909].  
 
Tumor measurements will be defined by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_321910] a radiation oncologist or radiologist not associated with this study.  In addition, 
responses will be reported directly to the CCCC Data Safety and Toxicity Committee (DSTC) 
for confirmation of objective responses reported. Submissions will be made within accordance 
with reporting timelines.  The study PI, co-investigators, and/or research staff will monitor all 
patients on the trial, and will evaluate patients at each treatment encounter and in follow-up.  
Serious adverse events are reported to the attending physician, the Principal investigator (PI), the 
DSTC, and the UHCMC IRB per IRB guidelines.

Portal, EMR and paper charts will be used to screen for eligibility. Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_321911] (pathology reports, laboratory results, etc.) will be kept in the shadow charts by [CONTACT_20234]. The shadow charts will be kept in a secure, locked area. Clinical data will be tracked 
in 
Oncore. Other data, such as treatment planning images, will be maintained on a password 
protected computer located in the Department of Radiation Oncology on a secured server.   
 
Response Criteria 
Response will be assessed using tumor measurements (longest dimension) obtained from MRI 
and/or CT with or without contrast, documentation of presence of metastatic disease, results of 
post-treatment pathology (if available).  
Definitions of response: 
 
 S table – no change 
 P rogressive Disease – 20% or more increase in sum of diameters of the target 
lesion. 
 The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of 5 mm or more or 
the presence of a new lesion or lesions.  
 P artial Response - At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters . 
 C omplete Response – no visible target lesions 
 P athological Complete Response – Based on increase or decrease of available 
biops

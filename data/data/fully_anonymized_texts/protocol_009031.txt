 1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR SCHEMA  
This is an open- label single arm  trial of letermovir (LTV,  Prevymis) for  prevention of  recurrent 
CMV  infection in allogeneic hematopoietic cell  transplantation (HCT) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_575171]. The study is being conducted at  MSKCC and at the University of Minnesota.  
Thirty -six HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_575172] ;?:12 years of age, had clinically significant  CMV inf ection 
treated with CMV  antivirals  and are at high risk for recurrent  CMV  infection,  defined as 
receiving  a transplant  from an HLA mismatched  donor  (including cord blood),  acute or 
chronic  graft versus host disease  (GVHD)  requiring either  topi[INVESTIGATOR_220113]/or  systemic steroid 
treatment  within  14 days  prior to  enrollment,  or T cell -depleted (CD34+ -selected) allograft,  will 
be eligible to participate in the study.  
All patients will receive LTV for prevention of recurrent CMV infection (secondary 
prophylaxi s). Secondary prophylaxis will start after completion of antiviral therapy for CMV 
infection. LTV 480 mg (240mg daily for  patients on cyclosporin A) will  be administered daily 
until the patients meet the primary endpoint of clinically significant CMV infec tion or for 
maximum duration of  14 weeks. All  patients will  be followed for  24 weeks  from Day 1 of LTV 
(Figure 1).  
The primary endpoint will  be discontinuation of LTV prior  to week [ADDRESS_755056] of 
care.  
Clinically significant CMV infection is  defined as  either CMV viremia requiring preemptive 
therapy with CMV  antivirals  [(val)ganciclovir  or foscarnet] or  CMV  end organ disease (EOD). 
CMV EOD is defined as pneumonia, gastrointestinal  disease with macroscopi c mucosal 
lesions, hepatitis, neurological disease, cystitis, myocarditis, or  pancreatitis in which  CMV is 
detected in the affected tissue by [CONTACT_126568], rapid culture, immunohistochemical 
analysis, or in situ hybridization; or retinitis with typi[INVESTIGATOR_575173].  
Patients  with either  an undetectable or a low CMV  viral load (defined  as <300 IU/ml)  will be 
enrolled;  this must be documented on  at least  two consecutive measurements at  least  [ADDRESS_755057] recent  value  ::;; 7 days  prior  to Day 1. Patients  with detectable CMV 
viral load  may continue CMV antiviral therapy for 3 days  concomitantly with  LTV to  allow 
LTV to reach steady state. Patients who meet the primary endpoint will discontinue 
letermovir and will b e treated with preemptive therapy per standards of care at each 
Institution.  Whenever possible,  CMV  should  be sent for letermovir  resistance testing  prior 
to initiating preemptive therapy.  A schema of the study design is  shown below:

o Number of  days  free of CMV viremia,  CMV EOD, CMV  antivirals, alive,  and out of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_575174] 14.  
o Utilization  of CMV  antivirals  (type  and duration) through week  24. 
o Number  and reason(s) for  readmissions and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110756] (LOS)through 
week 24.  
o Invasive  procedures  (endoscopy,  bronchoscopy,  etc.) through week  24. 
o All-cause  and non-relapse  mortality  at week  24. 
• To determine the proportion of  patients  who develop  LTV resistance (determined using CMV 
isolates from patients with CMV viremia during the study).  
To assess the occurrence of SAEs  and toxicity  leading  to LTV discontinuation.  
• To assess CMV -CMI at  D +[ADDRESS_755062] clinically significant infection . The percentage of 
patients with positive CMI will be estimated.  
 
 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Cytomegalovirus  (CMV)  remains the  most common clinically significant infection after allogeneic 
hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), occurring in up to 80% of CMV -seropositive HCT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (Ljungman Pet  al. 2010) .Following HCT,  early  CMV reactivation correlates with higher 
non-relap se mortality, with risk ratios ranging from 1.4 to 1.95, depending on the underlying 
hematologic disease and type of transplantation (Teira Pet  al. 2016; Ramanathan M et al.  
2016).Though preemptive therapy with CMV antivirals is  effective in  preventing CMV end organ 
disease (EOD), patients that do not develop CMV -specific immunity following CMV infection are at 
risk for recurrence of  CMV infection after discontinuation of preemptive therapy. To prevent recurrent 
CMV infection, secondary prophy laxis is  routinely used  in these patients, which currently consists of 
a reduced (maintenance) dose of the  same antivirals used for treatment of CMV [(val)ganciclovir or 
foscarnet]. Even at reduced doses, prolonged use of (val)ganciclovir  or foscarnet is a ssociated with 
myelosuppression or nephrotoxicity, respectively  (Emery et al. 2013) . Interruptions or dose 
reductions of anti -CMV antivirals due to  toxicity often lead to sub -therapeutic drug concentrations, 
CMV resistance and potentially CMV EOD (Chou 2015). Thus, improved strategies for secondary 
prophylaxis are needed.  
Letermovir (LTV)  is a new,  highly  potent, CMV -specific terminase  inhibitor that  has shown  in a phase 
[ADDRESS_755063] (primary prophylaxis) (Marty FM et al. 2018).

In this multicenter, double- blind, placebo- controlled trial (P001, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  in adult CMV-  
seropositive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_575175], subjects were  randomized (2:1) to receive either LTV 
at a dose of [ADDRESS_755065] (at any time from Day Oto Day [ADDRESS_755066] - 
transplant) and continued through Week [ADDRESS_755067] -transplant.  Study drug was administered either 
orally or  intravenously;  the latter at  investigators'  discretion in  subjects who were unable  to take oral 
therapy . Subjects were monitored for CMV DNA weekly until post -transplant week [ADDRESS_755068] - 
transplant.  
The efficacy population consisted of 325 subjects who received LTV (including [ADDRESS_755069]  one IV dose) and 170 who received placebo (including [ADDRESS_755070] one IV dose). The  median time to starting study drug was 8 days after transplantation.  Thirty - 
four percent (34%) of  subjects were engrafted at  baseline. The median age was 55 years (range:18 
to 76 years); 57% were  male; 84% were white; 9%  were  Asian; 2%  were Black or  African American; 
and 7%  were Hispanic or Latino. At baseline, 30% of all subjects had  one or more of the  following 
factors associated with increased risk for CMV reactivation (high risk stratum): human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA) -related donor with  at least one mismatch at  one of the  following three HLA -gene loci: 
HLA- A, -B or - DR; haploidentical  donor; unrelated donor with at least one mismatch at one of the 
following four HLA- gene loci: HLA- A, -B, -C and -DRB1; use of umbilical cord blood as st em cell 
source; use  of ex vivo T -cell-depleted grafts; Grade [ADDRESS_755071] disease (GVHD) 
requiring systemic corticosteroids . The remaining 70% of subjects did not meet any of these high-  
risk stratum  criteria and were  therefore included i n the low risk stratum. Additionally, 48%  of subjects 
received a myeloablative regimen (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) . The most common primary reasons 
for transplant were acute myeloid leukemia (38%),  myelodysplastic  syndrome (16%), and lymphoma 
(12%).  
The primary efficacy endpoint of  Trial P001 was the incidence of clinically significant CMV infection 
through week [ADDRESS_755072] -transplant (prophylaxis failure) . Clinically significant CMV infection was 
defined as  the occurrence of either CMV end- organ disease or initiation of  anti-CMV pre -emptive 
therapy based on  documented CMV viremia (using the [COMPANY_002] COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS 
TaqMan® assay, the lower limit of quantitation is  137 IU/ml,  which is  approximately  150 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml). 
The protocol -specified guidance for CMV DNA thresholds for the initiation of pre- emptive ther apy 
during the treatment period was  150 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml or>  300 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml for  subjects  in the high-  and 
low-risk strata, respectively. From week 14 through week 24, the threshold was >300 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml for 
both groups . The non-completer=  failure approach was used, w here subjects who discontinued LTV 
prior to week [ADDRESS_755073] [37.5%] 
compared with patients that received placebo [60.6%] (p<0.001).  Efficacy results were similar 
between high - and low -risk strata for CMV reactivation . 
In November  2017,  LTV was approved by [CONTACT_575219][INVESTIGATOR_840].  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 19- 174 A(8)  
Approval  date: 14-Feb-[ADDRESS_755074] -transplant.  Approximately 10% of patients on LTV developed 
clinically significant CMV infection betw een weeks [ADDRESS_755075] -HGT (after discontinuation of 
LTV). Of these patients, 47%  had >1 baseline risk  factor  for CMV  (HLA -mismatched donor, umbilical 
cord blood as  the stem cell source, or T cell -depleted  graft), and  81% had GVHD (Hodowanec  A et 
al. 2018). Further, 19%  required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_575176], indicating that even post -prophylaxis CMV 
infections can be severe. Thus, even with widespread use of LTV as  primary prophylaxis, the need 
for secondary prophylaxis remains, as certain groups of patients are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_575177].  
 
 
Our hypothesis is that LTV will  be effective as secondary prophylaxis in HGT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_575178]. 
In addition to  those listed above, risk  factors for  CMV recurrence include CMV- seronegative donor , 
lymphopenia,  GVHD, and treatment with corticosteroids at doses >  0.5mg/kg (Boeckh M 2015).  
 
While LTV is currently FDA- approved for  treatment in  patients >18 years, it  is expected to  be safe in 
and to benefit adolescent  (ages 12 to 18 years) HGT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_575179]. Systemic 
exposure and clearance of drugs are generally similar in  adolescent and adult patients after 
considering the  effect of body size on pharmacokinetics (Momper JD 2013). LTV is  transported by 
[CONTACT_448662]1B1/3. In the literature, relative protein expression of OATP1B1  was highly variable among 
individuals, and no statistically significant difference was observed among studied age groups 
[Thomson, M.  M., et al  2016] [Prasad, B.,  et al 2016]. For OATP1B3, protein expression was not 
significantly different between adults and children >1 year. By  [CONTACT_575220], the Phase 3 population PK model suggests that the adult doses of LTV will 
result in comparable  exposures  in ages 12 to <[ADDRESS_755076] few options for 
prevention, given  the side effects  associated with prolonged use of (val)ganciclovir  or foscarnet.  
The long- term immunity against CMV relapse and end- organ disease requires functioning CMV-  
specific CDS+ and CD4+ T -cells (Hakki Met  al 2003; Gabanti E et al, 2014).  Low- level CMV 
replication is  postulated to provide in vivo priming and expansion of  CMV -specific T  cell precursors 
(Li CR et al, 1994).  Thus, effective CMV prophylaxis may hypothetically  hinder CMV immune 
reconstitution through suppression of CMV replication.  In a randomized study of ganciclovir 
prophylaxis  after HGT,  CMV- specific CD4+  proliferative and CDS+  cytotoxic responses  at Day [ADDRESS_755077] that ganciclovir prophylaxis may not completely suppress 
CMV replication and local CMV replication at the graft site (which may not  lead to detectable CMV 
viremia) may be sufficient for triggering CMV -specific immune activation (La Rosa C et al, 2007;  
Hakki Met  al, 2003). LTV blocks viral replication without inhibiting the synthesis of progeny CMV 
DNA or viral proteins. In fact, in  vitro LTV exposure is  associated with cytoplasmic accumulation of 
large amounts of sub- viral, noninfectious  particles termed dense bodies (DB) (Cayatte C et al, 
2013).  It is unknown how  LTV prophylaxis impacts CMV- specific immune  activation . Because of  the

Commercially available assays for functional assessment of CMV cell  mediated immunity 
(CMV-CMI) include ELLISPOT assays measuring IFN -y as spot forming colony  (SFC)/cells 
(T-Track ®  CMV  and T-SPOT.CMV ®),  ELISA based assays measuring IFN- y (Quantiferon 
CMV®), methods to Quantify CMV -specific CD8+ T  cells (Dextramer® CMV Kit  (IVD)) and 
intracellular  cytokine  staining  (CMV -immunity panel,  VIRACOR®)  (Yong MK, Curr Infect  Dis 
Rep 2018).  This CMV  immunity panel  is a flow cytometry assay  developed to determine the 
percentages of  CD4+ and CD8+ T  cells that respond to stimulation with CMV antigens.  
Assessment of  CMV specific response is  based upon the cellular activation surface marker 
CD69 in  conjunction with IFN -y, TNFa, and  IL-2 cytokine production. Three CMV antigens 
are used to assess patient immunity; a whole viral lysate, a peptide pool  of pp65, and a 
peptide pool  of IE-1. The advantage of  Intracellular cytokine staining assays is their ability  to 
detect  multiple  cytokines and cell surface markers  and differentiate T -cell phenotypes (Lileri, 
PLoS One. 2012; Whidmann T PLoS One. 2008; Lilieri DJ  Infect Dis. 2009).  
We propose to evaluate the efficacy of LTV as  secondary prophylaxis in adult and adolescent HCT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_575180]. Patients  may or may not have received LTV  as primary CMV  prophylaxis.  Additionally, we 
will evaluate the effects of LTV on CMV -specific i mmune reactivation at day 100 by [CONTACT_2329] a  flow 
cytometry based, CMV immunity panel on a cohort of patients treated with LTV.

recipi[INVESTIGATOR_575181] . A total of 36 patients will be enrolled to the interventional 
cohort of the study.  
 
Patients  aged 12 years  or older  will be eligible for  inclusion.  
 
Patients enrolled on  the study will  receive oral  LTV 480 mg daily  (240 mg  daily  for patients receiving 
cyclosporine A). Patients that may have inadequate absorption due to vomiting, diarrhea, or  a 
malabsorptive condition or are unable to receive oral medic ations due  to difficulty swallowing will 
receive intravenous LTV at same doses.  
The maximum duration of LTV administration will be 14 weeks. All  patients will  be followed for  a total 
of 24 weeks from start of LTV. The total study duration will be 24 weeks.  All patients  will be 
monitored for CMV infection by  [CONTACT_575221]- PCR of  plasma  ([COMPANY_002]) for  the duration of 
the study (per Institutional standards of  care). Patients will also be interviewed regarding symptoms 
of CMV EOD and will undergo routine laboratory evaluations post -HGT care  (CBC,  metabolic panel) 
(per standards of care). If  symptoms or lab  results suggest potential CMV EOD, appropriate

procedures for  the affected organ  will be performed (see 10.0 Evaluation During  Treatment and 12.0 
Criteria for  Therapeutic Response for details) . Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602],  invasive procedures undergone, 
and bacterial or  fungal infections detected during participation in the study will be recorded.  
 
Patients  who develop clinically significant CMV  infection while taking LTV will  discontinue LTV  and 
will be treated for CMV according to the standards of care at each Institution.  
 
Observational  cohort  
 
CMV  cell-mediated immunity (CMVI) will  be assessed by  [CONTACT_575222] ™ (Viracor -Eurofins)  at 
approximately  [ADDRESS_755081] . A 10 ml blood sample will  be collected for  CMV inSIGHT™ . All 
efforts will be made to coordinate the collection for the CMV inSIGHT™  on the same day that 
immune phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_575182]. Patients who at Day [ADDRESS_755082]  
CMV inSIGHT ™ below the reference range for either CD4 or  CDS, will have a repeat sample 
collected at  approximately  Day [ADDRESS_755083] for repeat testing by [CONTACT_575223]™ . A test is 
evaluable, if  it meets  viability standards and adequate  responses to  positive control (staphylococcal 
endotoxin b).  Patients with missing or  non-evaluable tests will  be replaced until  50 evaluable 
patients are accrued.  
We propose to enroll  70 patients  in order  to accrue 50 evaluable  patients.  
 
4.2 Intervention  
 
Open- label  LTV (oral and intravenous)  will be supplied by [CONTACT_44873] . 
 
Subjects will  initially be  administered the oral (tablet) formulation of  study  therapy  provided they  are 
able to swallow and do not have a condition that  may interfere with gastrointestinal absorption. For 
subjects who cannot swallow and/or have  a condition that may interfere with the absorption of  the 
oral formulation, LTV can be given intravenously  until patients are able to take oral LTV.  
 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
Letermovir  
 
 
5.1 Overview,  Dosage and Administration  
Letermovir (LTV, Prevymis, [COMPANY_006]) is  a potent inhibitor of the CMV terminase complex, which 
cleaves viral  deoxyribonucleic  acid (DNA) into  unit-length genome and packages it  into procapsids. 
TV is approved for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in adult CMV-  
seropositive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_575183]. LTV has been found to be safe and generally well 
tolerated in 14 Phase 1- 3 clinical trials . 
 
The recommended dosage of LTV is  480 mg administered orally or intravenously  (IV) once daily . 
Dosage of LTV should be decreased to 240 mg once daily when  co-administered  with cyclosporine.

Approval  date: 14-Feb-[ADDRESS_755084]  
[LOCATION_001],  [LOCATION_001]  [ZIP_CODE]   
 LTV is  formulated for  oral administration as tablets, which should be ingested whole.  LTV injection, 
which  contains hydroxypropyl  betadex, should be  used only  in patients  unable to take oral therapy, 
and is administered via a peripheral catheter or central venous line at a constant rate over 1 h. 
 
5.2 Contraindications 
• LTV is contraindicated in patients  receiving  pi[INVESTIGATOR_575184]:  
o Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924]: Concomitant administration of LTV in patients  receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_575185] P450 3A (CYP3A) 
by [CONTACT_575224], which may lead to QT prolongation and torsades de pointes.  
o Ergot  alkaloids: Concomitant administration of LTV in patients  receiving ergot  alkaloids 
may result in increased concentrations o f ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and 
dihydroergotamine)  due to inhibition of CYP3A by [CONTACT_575224], which may lead to ergotism . 
• LTV is contraindicated with pi[INVESTIGATOR_575186]- administered with 
cyclosporine.  Concomitant administration of LTV in combination with  cyclosporine may  result 
in significantly increased pi[INVESTIGATOR_575187], which may lead to 
myopathy or rhabdomyolysis . 
 
5.3 Safety of LTV  in Adult CMV -seropositive  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  [R+] of an Allogeneic HCT 
The safety of LTV was evaluated in a Phase 3 randomized,  double- blind,  placebo- controlled trial 
(P001) in which 565 subjects were randomized and treated with LTV (n=373) or placebo(n=192) 
through week [ADDRESS_755085]-transplant.  Adverse events  were those  reported while subjects were on study 
medication or within two weeks of study medication completion/discontinuation.  
The cardiac adverse event rate (regardless of investigator -assessed causality)  was higher in 
subjects receiving LTV (13%) compared with subjects receiving placebo (6%) . The most common 
cardiac adverse events were tachycardia (4% of LTV subjects vs. 2% of placebo) and atrial fibrillation (3% of LTV subjects vs. 1% of placebo). Among t hose subjects who experienced one or 
more cardiac adverse events,  85% of LTV and 92% of placebo subjects had events reported  as mild 
or moderate in  severity. The rate of adverse events occurring in at least 10% of subjects in the LTV 
group and at frequency  at least 2% greater than placebo is outlined in Table 1.

Overall, similar proportions of subjects in  each group discontinued study medication due to an 
adverse event (13% of LTV subjects vs . 12% of  placebo subjects). The most frequently reported 
adverse event that led to study drug discontinuation was nausea, occurring in  2% of LTV subjects 
and 1%  of placebo s ubjects . Hypersensitivity  reaction, with associated moderate dyspnea, occurred 
in one subject following the first infusion of  IV LTV after switching from  oral LTV,  leading to  treatment 
discontinuation.

LTV is a substrate of  organic anion -transporting  polypeptide 1B1/3 (OATP1B1/3)  transporters. Co-  
administration of LTV with drugs that are inhibitors of OATP1B1/[ADDRESS_755089] Other  Drugs  
Co-administration of  LTV with midazolam results in  increased midazolam plasma concentrations, 
indicating that  LTV is a moderate inhibitor of  CYP3A. Co -administration of LTV with drugs that  are 
CYP3A substrates may result in clinically relevant increases in the plasma concentrations  of co-  
administered CYP3A substrates.  
LTV is an inhibitor of  OATP1B1/3  transporters . Co-administration of LTV  with drugs that are 
substrates of  OATP1B1/3  transpor ters may  result in  a clinically relevant increase in  plasma 
concentrations of co- administered OATP1B1/3 substrates . 
The magnitude of  CYP3A-  and OATP1B1/3 -mediated drug interactions  on co-administered drugs 
may be different when LTV is co -administered with cyclosporine.  
 
Drugs  without  Clinically Significant  Interactions  with LTV 
No clinically significant interactions were observed in clinical drug -drug interaction studies of  LTV 
and acyclovir, digoxin,  mycophenolate mofetil,  posaconazole,  ethinyl  estradiol, and levonorgestrel.  
5.5 Use in Specific  Populations  
 
Renal  Impairment  
For patients  with creatinine clearance  (Cler) greater  than 10 ml/min, no dosage adjustment  of LTV 
is required based on renal impairment. There are insufficient data in patients with Cler 10 ml/min or 
less or in patients on dialysis to make LTV dosing recommendations. In patients with Cler less than 
50 ml/min receiving LTV injection, accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, hydroxypropyl betadex, 
may occur. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in  these patients.  
 
Pregnancy  
Risk Summary: No  adequate human data are available to  establish whether LTV  poses a  risk to 
pregnancy outcomes. In a rat pre/post -natal  development  study,  total litter loss was observed at 
maternal LTV exposures approximately  2 times higher than human exposure at the RHO.  
 
Lactation  
Risk Summary: It  is not known whether LTV is present in  human breast milk,  affects human  milk 
production, or  has effects on the breastfed child. When administered to  lactating rats, LTV was 
present in the milk of lactating rats as well as the blood of nursing pups.  
 
Females  and Males  of Reproductive  Potential  
There are no data on the effect of LTV on human fertility. Decreased fertility  due to testicular toxicity 
was observed in male rats .

5.6 Overdosage  
There is  no specific antidote for  overdose with  LTV. In  case  of overdose, it  is recommended that  the 
patient be monitored for adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted.  
It is unknown  whether  dialysis will result  in meaningful  removal  of LTV from systemic circulation.  
 
 
5.7 Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics  
 
The pharmacokinetic  properties  of LTV are displayed  in Appendix  2. 
 
Renal  Impairment  
LTV AUC was approximately  1.9- and 1.4- fold higher  in subjects with  moderate (eGFR  greater than 
or equal to 30 to 59 ml/min/1.73m2) and severe (eGFR less than 30 ml/min/1.73m2) renal 
impairment, respectively, compared to healthy subjects.  
Hydroxypropyl betadex present in the intravenous LTV formulation is  mainly eliminated by 
[CONTACT_575225].  Decreased  elimination  of hydroxypropyl betadex has  been reported in the 
literature in patients with severe renal impairment.  
 
Hepatic  Impairment  
LTV AUC was approximately 1 .6-fold higher  in subjects with  moderate (Child -Pugh Class  B [CP-B], 
score of 7- 9) hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects .

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
Eligible patients will  be identified at  the weekly BMT (Bone Marrow Transplantation)  service 
meeting or referred by [CONTACT_575227]. Eligibility will  be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_575228].  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_575192] a  treatment relationship for  the limited purpose of identifying patients who would be 
eligible to enroll in the study and to record appropriate contact [CONTACT_575229]. During the initial 
conversation between the investigator/research staff and the patient, the patient may be 
asked to provide certain health information that is necessary to the recruitment  and 
enrollment process. The investigator/research  staff may  also review portions of their medical 
records at enrolling institution in  order to further assess eligibility. They will use the 
information provided by [CONTACT_17491]/or medical record to confirm that the patient  is 
eligible and to contact [CONTACT_108541]. If  the patient turns out to be 
ineligible for  the research study,  the research staff will  destroy all  information collected on the 
patient during the initial  conversation and medical records review, except for any information 
that must  be maintained for  screening log  purposes. In  most cases, the  initial  contact [CONTACT_575230], investigator or the 
research staff working in  consultation with the treatment team.  
The recruitm ent process outlined presents no more than minimal risk to the privacy of the 
patients who are screened, and minimal PHI will be maintained as part of a screening log. 
For these  reasons, we seek  a (partial) limited waiver of  authorization for  the purposes of  (1) 
reviewing medical records to  identify potential research subjects and obtain information 
relevant to the enrollment process; (2)  conversing with patients regarding possible

 enrollment; (3)  handling of  PHI contained within those records and provided by  [CONTACT_565937]; and  (4) maintaining information in a screening log of patients approached (if 
applicable).  
The clinical trial will be listed on clinicaltrials.gov. All eligible patients will be approached for 
participation in the study. Patients  will not be paid for participation in the study . All visits for 
the study will occur during visits for routine clinic al care. No  travel reimbursement will be 
provided for  study visits . Patients are free to withdraw from  the study without consequence at 
any time.  
We expect  to reach  our accrual  goal within [ADDRESS_755102] be completed prior to entering the study:  
• Two consecutive CMV tests must confirm low  CMV viral load, or  one CMV test must 
show undetectable CMV viral load providing the prior measurements showed a 
consistent decline in viral load.  The last specimen must  be collected::5  7 days  prior to 
Day 1 . Routine CMV testing will be performed at each enrolling Institution using a 
quantitative PCR assay in plasma (CobasAmpliprep/CobasTaqman (CAP/CTM) 
CMV, [COMPANY_002] Molecular Diagnostics, NJ, [LOCATION_003]). The lower limit of quantification 
(LLOQ) and linear range (range)  are 91 IU/ml  and >137- 9.1x106 IU/ml, respectively.  
• Complete medical  history  will be taken,  focusing on: 
o HCT variables  
o GVHD:  grade,  site(s),  treatment  
o CMV  infection:  viremia,  EOD,  antivirals  
o Use of growth factors  
o Transfusions  
o Kidney  and liver function  
o Pre-HCT infection with  HIV, hepatitis C  virus  and hepatitis B  virus 
Review of concomitant medications  
For the observational cohort  screening will  include confirmation that  no clinically significant CMV 
infection was  present  since  HGT  and at least  one documented test  showing  T cell count  of 2:100 
cells/mcl taken no more than 1 week prior to enrollment.  
 
9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN  
9.1 Study  drugs  
Treatment will  be administered on an outpatient/inpatient  basis. Patients  will receive oral  LTV 
480mg daily (240mg daily for patients on cyclosporine). In patients with conditions affecting gastrointestinal  absorption or who are unable to take oral medications, LTV will be 
administered Intravenously at the same doses until those conditions resolve. Patients

 receiving oral  medication will be administered a pi[INVESTIGATOR_575193]. This 
will be administered and reconciled in clinic.  
9.2 Duration  of therapy  and follow -up 
The maximum duration of  LTV administration will be 14 weeks. LTV will  be discontinued for 
clinically significant CMV infection  or toxicity . Up to 2 interruptions for  a maximum combined 
interruption of 14 days are permitted during the  study. Patients are allowed to  restart LTV if 
toxicity is not deemed to be related to LTV.  
 
All patients  will be followed for a total of 24 weeks  from start of LTV. 
9.3 Concomitant  medications 
Only the following concomitant medications will  be captured from  the baseline visit until  the 
end of study:  
• CMV  antiviral  medications,  including but not limited  to: 
o Ganciclovir  
o Valganciclovir  
o Foscarnet  
o Cidofovir  
• lmmunosuppressants  used for the treatment or  prevention of  GVHD, including but not

each group discontinued study  medication due to an adverse event  (13%  of LTV subjects vs. 
12% of placebo subjects).  
 
11.2 Criteria  for study  drug  discontinuation  
Study  drug will be discontinued if  clinically indicated  for treatment -emergent  adverse events 
that are assessed by [CONTACT_575231].  
 
11.3 Dose delays  
Dosing interruptions (e. g. in the case of moderate, potentially treatment -related adverse 
effects such  as nausea or  vomiting) of  up to 2 interruptions of  maximum of  14 days in  total 
during the 14- week treatment are allowed.  
 
 
12.0 CRITERIA FOR  THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
The primary outcome is  the rate of breakthrough clinically significant CMV infection by [CONTACT_5875] 14. 
Clinically significant CMV infection is  defined as  either CMV viremia requiring preemptive therapy 
with CMV antivirals [(val)ganciclovir or foscarnet or other anti -CMV antiviral] or CMV end organ 
disease (EOD).  Patients  will be monitored  for CMV  viremia weekly throughout treatment (Section  10, 
Evaluation during treatment) . CMV EOD will be defined and scored according to the 
recommendations of the Disease Definit ions Working Group of the Cytomegalovirus Drug 
Development  Forum (Ljungman Pet al. 2017;  Appendix  3). The site(s) and date of diagnosis  of 
CMV EOD will be recorded.  CMV viral load threshold for PET initiation will  be at the discretion of 
primary  caregiver  in a risk adaptive approach.  In general. a single CMV viral load of >500 IU/ml  or

13.0 CRITERIA FOR  REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the US 
FDA Regulations, a  patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason 
without prejudice to  his/her  future  medical  care by [CONTACT_575232]. The Investigator 
also has the right to withdraw patients from the study (see below). A complete end- of-study 
evaluation  will be made at  the time of the patient's withdrawal with an explanation of why  the patient 
is withdrawing, and an attempt should be  made to perform a follow -up evaluation. Patients may be 
removed from the study by [CONTACT_575233]:  
• Significant  noncompliance  on the part of the patient  
• Refusal  of the patient  to continue treatment  or observations  
• Unacceptable  toxicity  (AE at least  probably  related  to LTV)  
• Pregnancy  
• Decision by  [CONTACT_737]

Primary Objective: This is a single -center open- label trial of LTV for prevention of recurrent CMV 
infection in patients undergoing HCT at MSK and participating sites. Patients who receive  3 doses 
of LTV are considered evaluable for the  primary endpoint, which is the rate of clinically significant 
CMV  infection  through week 14.  Patients who  discontinue letermovir after  receiving <3  doses  for any 
reason will be replaced.  
 
A total of 36 evaluable patients will  be included in the primary endpoint analysis. If  left untreated, the 
cumulative incidence of  clinically significant CMV infection in  this population is estimated to be 40% 
(Boeckh M et al. 2015) . Therefore, LTV will be considered pr omising if the incidence decreases to 
20%. Using  these  rates, a single stage  exact design will be employed, and  [ADDRESS_755112] 3 doses of LTV. To align with the cumulative incidence estimate,  which 
treats death and  relapse without CMV infection as  competing risks, patients who die or relapse 
without CMV infection will  be treated as "no CMV infection" for  the primary analysis. Overal l survival 
and non- relapsed mortality for the study population will be evaluated as secondary objectives . 
 
 
The study does not  include an  interim analysis. Letermovir was approved by  [CONTACT_52051] 
2017.  The drug has now been widely used at our Center  on and off label including for secondary 
prophylaxis with encouraging results. This study will  prospectively treat patients and estimate the 
cumulative incidence of CMV infection during letermovir secondary prophylaxis. If an interim 
analysis were  included and  accrual to  this study  were  held, patients would instead receive the study 
drug off -protocol. Therefore, we feel  it is a better approach to  consecutively accrue 36 patients on 
this study, and not hold accrual for an interim analysis . 
 
We will implement a  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_575199] . We will stop accrual in case  10 patients reach the 
primary outcome and develop breakthrough clinically significant CMV infection.  
 
We anticipate  accrual of  approximately 2- 3 patients per  month  and hence accrual should be 
completed in 18 months.  
 
The secondary  objectives  of this study:  
1. The cumulative incidence of  clinically significant CMV  infection at  [ADDRESS_755113] undetectable CMV and detectable CMV at  baseline.  Death 
and relapse are considered competing risks for this analysis.  
 
2. The cumulative incidence of  clinically significant CMV  infection at  24 weeks  will be estimated. 
Death and relapse are considered competing risks for this analysis.  
 
3. Among patients  who develop CMV viremia or  EOD, the  median time  to onset of  CMV viremia 
or EOD will be summarized  
 
4. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the number of well days through week 14 
(well  days: defined as  days  free of CMV viremia, CMV EOD, CMV  antivirals, alive,  and out of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).

the study.  
 
6. The number of  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_575200] 24.  The reason  for 
the readmission along with the duration of stay will also be summarized.  
 
7. Rate  and types  of invasive procedures (endoscopy, bronchoscopy, etc .) during through week 
24 will be summarized.  
 
8. Overall survival at  24 weeks will be estimated using Kaplan- Meier  methods . The cumulative 
incidence of  non-relapse mortality rate  will be estimated at  week 24;  relapse is  considered a 
competing risk . 
The proportion of  patients who  develop  LTV resistance will be estimated through week 24. 
The corresponding exact 95% confidence interval will also be reported.  
 
For the observational cohort:  Descriptive statistics of absolute lymphocyte count and lymphocyte 
subsets  (CD4 and CD8) on 0100 will be reported.  The proporti on of patients who are positive  CMI 
(+) on 0100 will  be reported along with  an 95% confidence interval. With  50 patients, the precision in 
which we can estimate the proportion of patients who are CMI positive is+/ - 0.14.  The odds ratio 
between CMI results on Day100 (positive/negative) and non- clinically significant CMV viremia 
(yes/no) in the study cohort will  be estimated along with a 95% confidence interval. CMI at Day [ADDRESS_755115]. The incidence of CMV infection based on categorizes of absolute lymphocyte count and 
lymphocyte  subsets (CD4 and CD8) will be similarly estimated and compared.  P values lower than  
.05 will be considered statistically significant. To identify predictors of CMI responses on 0100, 
demographics  baseline characteristics and presence of  non-clinically  significant CMV -viremia prior 
to 0100 will be examined in in multiv ariate models . 
 
 
15.0 RESEARCH  PARTICIPANT  REGISTRATION  AND  RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES  
15.1 Research Participant  Registration  
Confirm eligibility as defined in the section entitled Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. Obtain informed 
consent by  [CONTACT_575234] . During 
the registration process registering individuals will be  required to  complete a protocol spec ific 
Eligibility Checklist. The  individual signing the Eligibility Checklist is  confirming whether or  not the 
participant is eligible to enroll in the  study. Study staff are responsible for ensuring that all 
institutional requirements necessary to enroll  a participant to the study  have  been completed. See 
related Clinical Research Policy and Procedure #401 (Protocol Participant Registration) . 
 
15.2 Randomization 
This is a single arm, open-  label  study.  There is no randomization.

Laboratory data will be tabulated and summarized based on MSK  normal  ranges. 
Data collected for this study will be entered in Medidata.  
SAEs will be reported as  described in section 17.2. AEs, including evidence of the relationship 
between the AE and study drug, will be  documented in  the patient's medical records only  if the 
event  is considered at  least  possibly  related  to LTV.  If an event is  reported as  at least  possibly 
related, the Pl or Co- Pl will review the patient's medical records and will grade the relationship 
between the event and LTV on a separate document. Any  event that began before  LTV therapy is 
initiated will be considered as medical history and will only be captured as  an AE if the event 
worsens after LTV treatment is  initiated and is deemed to be at least possible related to LTV. AEs 
will be recorded from LTV treatment initiation through [ADDRESS_755117] of care testing processes for 
CMV T Cell Immunity Panel. Only MSK will  be collecting specimen and sending it to Viractor - 
Eurofins  for analysis . Viracor Eurofins will  receive  PHI (name, DOB,  MRN) as  the test is approved 
for NYS;  it is performed as  institutional st andard of  care and  results are  available to the clinicians . 
Data will be provided when they result each sample throughout the study. The  contact [CONTACT_575235] .

16.1 Quality  Assurance 
Registration reports will be generated on a regular basis to monitor patient accrual and 
completeness of the registration data. Routine data quality reports will  be generated to assess 
missing data and inconsistencies. Accrual rates and extent and accuracy of evaluati ons and follow - 
up will  be monitored periodically throughout the study period and potential problems will  be brought 
to the attention of  the study  team  for discussion and action. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
(MSK) has  established standard procedures for  data safety monitoring of  clinical research (see 16.2 
Data and Safety Monitoring).

16.2 Data  and Safety  Monitoring 
The data and safety monitoring (DSM) plans at MSKCC were approved by [CONTACT_423083] 2001. The plans address the policies set forth by [CONTACT_575236], which 
can be found at http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/clinicaltrials . The DSM plans at MSKCC were 
established and are monitored by [CONTACT_30591]. The MSKCC DSM plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at: 
http://mskweb5.mskcc.org/intranet/html/[ZIP_CODE].cfm . 
 
There are several different mechanisms by [CONTACT_30592], safety, and quality. There are institutional processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., protocol monitoring, 
compliance and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response, and staff education on clinical research 
quality assurance) and departmental procedures for quality control, and there are two institutional 
committees that are responsible for monitoring the activities of our clinical trials programs. The 
committees: 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for Phase I and II clinical trials, and the 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for Phase Ill clinical trials, report to  the MSKCC Research 
Council and Institutional Review Board. 
 
During the protocol development and review process, each protocol will be assessed for its level of 
risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (e .g., NIH sponsored, in- house 
sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative group, etc .) will be addressed, and the monitoring 
procedures will be established at the time of protocol activation.  
  
This protocol  will be monitored  by [CONTACT_575237].  
16.[ADDRESS_755119]/Privacy Board (IRB/PB). There will be one protocol document and each participating site will utilize that document.  
Participating sites that are conducting  specimen  analysis  must  submit  the following  documents  to MSK 
before specimens can be shipped to the site : 
• Participating Site 1572  
• Conflict  of Interest  forms  for Participating  Site Investigators  on the 1572

Benefits:  LTV is effective in  preventing CMV in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] . LTV,  compared  with other  antivirals 
is associated with a lower frequency of adverse events including bone marrow suppression and 
nephrotoxicity.  
Protocol Amendments and  Study  Termination : All protocol  amendments will  be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_245412]'s Institutional Review Board before implementation.  
Incentives: No incentives will  be offered to  patients/subjects  for participation in this study. 
Participation is voluntary.  
Costs: LTV will be provided by  [CONTACT_44873]. Participation in this study will  incur  no direct  costs to patients 
for care.  
Eligibility  Exceptions: There  will be no exceptions to the eligibility requirements for  this protocol 
without the authorization of MSK Institutional Review Board.  
Adverse Event Reporting Requirements: AEs will  be graded per  CTCAE v.5.  The Pl or  Co-Pl will 
attribute the relationship between the event and  LTV. Only those events which are deemed to  be at 
least possibly related to letermovir will be documented and attributed. Any event that began before 
LTV therapy is initiated will be considered as medical history and will only be  captured as an AE if 
the event worsens  after LTV  treatment is  initiated. AEs will  be recorded from LTV treatment initiation 
through [ADDRESS_755121] dose.  
Inclusion of Children in  Research: LTV is  currently FDA -approved for  treatment in patients >18 
years . Adolescent patients (ages 12 to 18 years) wi ll be included in this study because LTV is 
expected to  be safe and of potential benefit in HCT  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_575202]. The protocol does 
not include children younger than 12 years old. Inclusion of  women and minorities: Memorial 
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has filed form HHS 441 (re: Civil  Rights), form HHS 641 
(handicapped Individuals), and form 639- A (re: Sex Discrimination) . In selecting patients for this 
study, we have taken due notice of NIH/ADAMHA policies concerning inclusion of women and 
minorities in clinical research . We expect that  the study population will  be fully representative of the 
range o f patients seen at MSK without exclusion as to age, gender, or ethnic background.  
Alternatives to  the Planned Study:  Alternative treatment options  include  receiving standard  care 
and follow- up. If relevant, other investigational options will also be outlined.  
Confidentiality: Every  effort  will be made to maintain patient confidentiality.  Research  and

 Appendix 3: Definitions  of CMV end organ disease according to the Disease Definitions Working 
Group  of the Cytomegalovirus  Drug  Development Forum. Reproduced from  Ljungman P,  et al. Clin 
Infect Dis 2017.  
 
 
CMV  Pneumonia  
Proven disease requires  clinical symptoms and/or signs  of pneumonia such as new infiltrates  on 
imaging, hypoxia, tachypnea, and/or  dyspnea combined with CMV  documented in lung tissue  by 
[CONTACT_126568], rapid culture, histopathology,  immunohistochemistry, or DNA hybridization 
techniques . 
Probable CMV pneumonia is  defined as  the detection of CMV by  [CONTACT_126567], rapid culture of  BAL 
fluid, or the quantitation of CMV DNA in BAL fluid combined with clinical symptoms and/or signs of 
pneumonia. A  definite cut -off for  CMV DNA load  cannot be  established at  the present time.  The cut- 
off is likely to vary between different patients and according to how the BAL procedure and 
processing are performed and the assay used  for CMV DNA quantitation . Furthermore, CMV DNA 
levels may vary considerably between patients with varying degrees of  severity of  CMV pneumonia, 
which may  impact the  predictive values of any  cut-off. It  should be  recognized that CMV shedding in 
the lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_575212] a low CMV DNA load might well represent 
asymptomatic infection [7] . The likelihood for CMV pneumonia increases with increasing DNA viral 
load. In one study in HSCT patients, CMV viral load >200 -500 IU/mL in BAL fluid was likely (with a 
positive predictive value of approximately  50% based on disease prevalence figures of 
approximately  10% among patients  at risk for CMV  pneumonia undergoing BAL testing)  to represent 
pneumonia in HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (M . Boeckh, unpublished data), while lower levels were likely 
indicating pulmonary shedding. Data from  lung transplant patients suggest that the  viral load in BAL 
fluid in patients with  CMV pneumonia is  approximately 1.5  log10  higher than the viral load in patients 
with detectable CMV DNA in BAL fluid without evidence of  CMV  pneumonia (a cut-off of  5500  IU/mL 
had a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 75%) (Lodding et al, abstract, IDWeek  2015) . On the 
other hand, a negative CMV DNA test  in the BAL fluid has a negative predictive value close to  100% 
and therefore excludes the possibility  of CMV pneumonia.  The use of quantitative PCR on biopsies 
is an evolving field.  Presently, these findings could be defined as possible CMV pneumonia.  
CMV  Gastrointestinal  Disease  
Proven disease requires upper and/or lower gastrointestinal  (GI) symptoms plus macroscopic 
mucosal lesions plus CMV documented in  tissue by [CONTACT_26745], v irus isolation, rapid culture, 
immunohistochemistry,  or DNA  hybridization techniques. Studies  should give information regarding 
the presence or absence of gut graft -vs-host disease (GVHD) in HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] . 
Probable GI  disease requires upper and/or lower GI  symptoms and  CMV documented in tissue but 
without the  requirement for  macroscopic  mucosal  lesions.  Studies  should give information regarding 
the presence or absence of gut GVHD in HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].

CMV doc umented in blood by [CONTACT_140177] (eg, PCR) or  antigenemia or CMV documented by  [CONTACT_575239]. The  use of quantitative PCR on 
gut biopsies is  an evolving field. Presently, these findings could be  defined as possible GI  disease.  
CMV  Hepatitis  
 
Proven disease requires abnormal liver function tests plus CMV documented in tissue by 
[CONTACT_26745],  immunohistochemistry,  virus  isolation,  rapid culture,  or DNA  hybridization techniques 
plus the absence of other documented cause of hepatitis.  
Probable disease is not a recommended category for CMV hepatitis. Due to the risk for other 
confounders such as acute and chronic allograft rejection in  liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_575213], as  well as the common occurrence of  drug- associated liver dysfunction, a probable 
CMV hepatitis category is not defined.  
CMV  Retinitis  
 
Proven disease requires typi[INVESTIGATOR_575214]. If the presentation is  atypi[INVESTIGATOR_575215], it  is recommended that  the diagnosis  be supported by [CONTACT_575240] (such as PCR). A probable disease category should not be used.  
CMV  Encephalitis  and Ventriculitis  
 
Proven disease requires  central  nervous system  (CNS)  symptoms plus  detection of CMV  in CNS 
tissue by [CONTACT_126568], rapid culture, immunohistochemical  analysis, in situ hybridization, or 
(preferably) quantitative PCR.  
Probable disease requires CNS symptoms plus detection of CMV in  CSF without visible 
contamination of  blood  ("bloody  tap")  plus abnormal imaging  results  or evidence of  encephalitis on 
electroencephalography.  
Nephritis  
 
Proven disease is defined by [CONTACT_575241], rapid culture, 
immunohistochemical  analysis, or  in situ hybridization in a kidney  allograft biopsy  specimen obtained 
from a patient with renal dysfunction together with the identification  of histologic features of CMV 
infection.  The detection of CMV in urine by  [CONTACT_575242].  
Cystitis  
 
Proven disease is  defined by [CONTACT_575241], rapid culture, 
immunohistochemical  analysis, or  in situ hybridization in a bladder biopsy specimen obtained from a 
patient with cystitis together with the identification of conventional histologic features of CMV 
infection. The detection of CMV in  urine by  [CONTACT_575243].

 Myocarditis  
Proven disease is  defined by [CONTACT_575244], rapid culture, 
immunohistochemical  analysis, or  in situ hybridization in a heart  biopsy  specimen obtained from a 
patient with  myocarditis together with the identification  of conventional histologic features of  CMV 
infection.  
Pancreatitis 
Proven disease is  defined as the detection of CMV by [CONTACT_126568], rapid culture, 
immunohistochemical analysis, or in situ hybridization in a pancreatic biopsy specimen obtained 
from a patient with pancreatitis together with  the identificat ion of conventional histologic  features of 
CMV infection.  
Other  End-Organ Disease Categories 
CMV can also cause disease in other organs, and the definitions of  these additional disease 
categories include the  presence of compatible symptoms and signs  and documentation of  CMV  by 
[CONTACT_575245], rapid culture, immunhistochemistry, or  DNA hybridization in biopsy 
material.

36Epi[INVESTIGATOR_618666] (EAT) is the visceral fat of the heart. EAT could locally affect 
37the coronary arteries through local secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. EAT plays a 
38role in the development of the coronary artery disease (CAD). EAT is a highly enriched 
39with genes involved in inflammation.  Given its rapid metabolism and simple 
40measurability, as first developed by [CONTACT_874246], EAT serves as target for medications 
41targeting the fat. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1A) are anti-diabetic medications 
42with recently suggested cardio-protective properties.  Liraglutide, a GLP-1A, has recently 
43shown to reduce the cardiovascular risk.  Iacobellis‘group found that EAT thickness 
44decreased by [CONTACT_874247] 36% after 12 weeks of treatment with liraglutide. 
45Remarkably, Iacobellis’group found for the first time that human EAT express GLP-1 
46Receptor (GLP-1R). GLP-1A effects may be therefore visceral fat specific and target EAT. 
47Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that treatment with liraglutide will 
48significantly and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_874227]. Decreased EAT inflammation can 
49reduce the burden of the coronary plaques. We will test our hypothesis in a 12-week 
50randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, interventional study in 40 patients with type 
512 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and CAD, with an acceptable glycemic control on their current 
52diabetes regimen who require elective CABG regardless of their participation in the study. 
53A minimum time frame of 3-week treatment will be considered to detect significant 
54changes in the study endpoints. Inclusion criteria for body fat markers will rule out the 
55confounding effect of different body fast distribution at baseline. Study subjects will be 
56randomized in two groups of 20 patients to receive additional liraglutide or to remain on 
57current treatment/ placebo prior to cardiac surgery. EAT samples will be collected during 
58cardiac surgery and processed for analysis of mRNA and protein expression of EAT 
59inflammatory genes such as Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin 6 (IL-
606), and GLP-1R.

63Background
64EAT Anatomy and Physiology: EAT is the visceral fat depot of the heart. 1-[ADDRESS_1220916] the same embryogenesis and both evolve 
66from brown fat (BAT). EAT is supplied by [CONTACT_874248] 
67coronary arteries and no muscle fascia separates the fat depot and 
68the myocardium (as depi[INVESTIGATOR_874228] 
69EAT).  Hence, as the two tissues share the same microcirculation, 
70a direct cross-talk between the EAT and the myocardium has been 
71highly suggested. Under physiological conditions EAT could serve as a buffer, absorbing 
72fatty acids and protecting the heart against high fatty acids levels, as a lipid storage and 
73local energy source channelling fatty acids to the myocardium and as BAT to defend the 
74myocardium against hypothermia. Under pathological conditions EAT releases factors that 
75promote harmful coronary artery and myocardial changes. EAT is an extremely active 
76organ that produces both pro-inflammatory, such as TNF-α, IL-6, and anti-inflammatory 
77adipokines. 1-[ADDRESS_1220917] locally and 
78modulate the myocardium and coronary arteries through paracrine or vasocrine secretion 
79of bioactive molecules.  EAT transcriptome is also unique when compared to subcutaneous 
80fat. EAT is a highly inflammatory tissue enriched with genes involved in inflammation, 
81endothelial function, coagulation, immune signalling and apoptosis.4 
82EAT and Coronary Artery Disease: EAT plays a significant role in the development and 
83progression of CAD.5-[ADDRESS_1220918],

90largely associated with the severity of CAD and its association with CAD was confirmed 
91in several large population studies. The relationship of EAT thickness and coronary artery 
92disease is driven by [CONTACT_874250]. 
93EAT as therapeutic target: EAT thickness can be visualized and measured with standard 
94echocardiography, as first developed and validated by [CONTACT_874246]. 7-8 (echo-free space 
95within the red dot from the parasternal view). In addition to 
96the easy accessibility and excellent reproducibility, as 
97reported by [CONTACT_874251], 
98echocardiographic EAT independently reflects the intra-
99abdominal visceral fat, measured with Magnetic resonance 
100imaging (MRI) and the intra-myocardial lipid content, 
101calculated with MR-spectroscopy.9 Given its rapid

119interventional case-controlled study in 
120overweight/obese subjects with T2DM on 
121metformin monotherapy.11 Individuals were 
122randomized in two groups to receive 
123additional liraglutide up to 1.8 mg sc once 
124daily or to remain on Metformin. Our results showed that ultrasound measured EAT 
125thickness decreased from 10.2±2 to 6.9±1.9 and 5.8±1.9 mm (p< 0.001) after 12 and 24 
126weeks, respectively, accounting for approximately 40% of reduction at 12 and 24 weeks 
127(graphic on the right), whereas there was no significant EAT reduction in the Metformin 
128group.  EAT shrunk independently of overall weight loss and improved glucose control. A 
129milder, as compared to our results, yet noticeable (-13%), reduction of EAT thickness was 
130recently observed after 12 weeks of treatment either with liraglutide or exenatide in a 
131smaller group of patients with type 2 diabetes. 12 However, EAT results in this study were 
132pooled together making difficult to discriminate differences between the two agents.
133EAT as pro-inflammatory organ: EAT of CAD subjects is 
134enriched with pro-inflammatory genes, as our recent microarray 
135analysis (microarray table on the left) showed. 4 Pro-

146EAT expresses GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R)
147Whether EAT expressed GLP- 1 receptor (GLP-1R) was unknown. 
148We recently performed a RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq analysis) and 
149Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to evaluate the presence 
150of GLP-1R in EAT obtained from [ADDRESS_1220922] GLP-1R. RNA-seq analysis showed 
154that EAT expresses GLP-1R gene. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed 
155GLP-1R expression by [CONTACT_874252]-spanning 
156primers (graphic on the right). Immunofluorescence showed that 
157GLP-1R is present and more abundant in EAT than SAT

185actions of GLP-1 analogues on adipose tissue are still unclear. Liraglutide may improve 
186EAT insulin sensitivity and microcirculation, stimulate EAT thermogenesis and adipocyte

6188Short term effects of Liraglutide on inflammation
189The experimental study by [CONTACT_874253] a rapid effects of liraglutide in reducing 
190TNF-α-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in endothelial cells (25). A rapid anti-
191inflammatory effects of liraglutide on endothelial cells was also reported by [CONTACT_874254]  
192Liraglutide reduced the inflammatory responses to TNFα and LPS stimulation, with a 
193significant reduction of protein expression of the adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and E-
194Selectin, and THP-1 monocyte adhesion in cultured human aortic endothelial cells (26). 
195Additionally, we provided evidence that epi[INVESTIGATOR_874229]-1R protein and 
196mRNA, such as the heart. Hence, liraglutide is more likely to have a direct effect on 
197epi[INVESTIGATOR_874230]. 
198The LEAD trials showed a decrease in mean weight ranging from 1 to 3.2 kg (2.2 to 7.04 
199pounds) over the course of [ADDRESS_1220924] properties that go beyond the glucose-lowering 
226effects, as the recent LEADER trial showed that Liraglutide reduces the risk of major 
227cardiovascular events. Hence, our timely proposal will help the understanding of the

7228mechanisms of the cardio-protective effects of Liraglutide. As our preliminary data are 
229showing that a) EAT is highly inflammatory fat depot affecting the coronary arteries, b) 
230Liraglutide causes a massive and rapid reduction of EAT thickness, c) EAT expresses GLP-
2311R our hypotheses can be likely proven in this study. Our proposal would provide stronger 
232evidences for using GLP-1As in the treatment of CAD. In addition, as EAT is an easily 
233measurable and modifiable risk factor, as we first developed, it can be targeted by 
234Liraglutide. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design will allow for 
235an independent and unbiased effect of Liraglutide on study results. In addition, actions to 
236equalize weight loss and maintain similar glucose control between study arms will rule out 
237the confounding effects of these factors on the study outcomes. 
238Specific Objectives
239Primary Objective: 
240to test the hypothesis that liraglutide can reduce the pro-inflammatory 
241transcriptome profile of EAT of subjects with T2DM and CAD. 
242Secondary Objectives: 
243to assess the hypothesis that liraglutide will reduce the ultrasound measured EAT 
244thickness in subjects with T2DM and CAD. 
245to evaluate the hypothesis that liraglutide can produce more anti-inflammatory 
246effects in the EAT as comparted to SAT of subjects with T2DM and CAD. 
247to test the hypothesis that EAT mRNA and protein expression of GLP-1R will be 
248greater in subjects receiving liraglutide as compared to those continuing their 
249standard therapy
250
251Research Design and Methods
252Study Hypotheses
253Hypothesis for Primary Objective: We hypothesize that EAT inflammatory gene mRNA 
254and protein expression will be lower in subjects receiving additional therapy with 
255liraglutide as compared to those who will continue with their current treatment. 
256Hypothesis for Second Objectives: based on our biomolecular and clinical preliminary 
257data, we hypothesize that a) EAT thickness will respond and decrease more on liraglutide 
258than on standard therapy, b) inflammatory genes and protein expression will be different 
259in EAT vs SAT c) EAT GLP-1R expression will be greater in patients on liraglutide vs 
260those on standard therapy.

272Study Type 
273This is an Investigator Sponsored Study (ISS).
274This will be a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled interventional study 
275in 40 patients with T2DM and CAD with an acceptable glycemic control on their current 
276diabetes regimen who require elective coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806] (CABG) regardless 
277of their participation in the study. 
278A minimum time frame of 3-week treatment will be considered to detect significant 
279changes in the study endpoints. If not all subjects would be able to complete the 12 
280weeks, study outcomes will be evaluated at the 3 week time point. 
281
282Study Design Study subjects will be randomized in two groups of 20 patients to receive 
283additional liraglutide, (L-group) or to remain on current treatment or placebo (D-group). 
284L-group will be started on liraglutide. Liraglutide will be started and administered 
285for 12 weeks prior to CABG with a starting dose of 0.6 mg (after a least one week) 
286and subsequent increments to 1.2 mg (after a least one week) and to 1.8 mg (after

315Rationale for minimum study time line of 3 weeks. 
316The pre-operative clinic schedule may not always allow to wait the full 12 weeks between

12426Adipose tissue collection: EAT biopsy samples (average 0.5-1.0 g) will be taken, before 
427heparin administration, near the proximal tract of the right coronary artery. Each tissue 
428sample will be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until analysis in a freezer. 
429The subcutaneous fat tissue (SAT) will be harvested at the site of the thoracic wound and 
430preserved in the same manner.
431Gene expression: in freshly isolated mature adipocytes (from EAT and SAT), extraction 
432of total RNA, quantification of mRNA, c-DNA generation qRT-PCR will be performed for 
433measuring expression of  the inflammatory genes (TNF-α, IL-6) and GLP-1R. 
434Western Blot: Total proteins will be extracted from frozen EAT and SAT adipocytes and 
435blotted for TNF-α, IL6, as previously described.
436In addition to the mRNA expression of GLP1R, we will also measure protein expression 
437of GLP-1R by [CONTACT_383998]. Total cell lysates from the EAT will be obtained as follows. 
438Cells will be resuspended in M-PER (Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent, Thermo 
439Scientific), incubated on ice for 20 min, sonicated for a few seconds and then centrifuged 
440(14,000 rpm, 15 min, 4°C) to obtain protein lysates which will  be stored at -80°C until 
441use. Protein content will be determined by [CONTACT_874257].

445To confirm GLP-1R protein expression, immunofluorescence will be performed on EAT 
446and SAT samples using Mab 3f52 against GLP-1R, as previously described by [CONTACT_874258] 
[ZIP_CODE]-24. This mouse monoclonal antibody has been extensively validated to show its 
448specificity. Due to the relatively low abundance of GLP-1R the immunofluorescence will 
449be performed using a tyramide signal amplification reagent (TSA kit#26 from Molecular 
450probes) according to the manufacturer instructions. In summary, cryosection of the samples 
451will be performed at -35 °C with 12 μm thickness using a Leica CM1850 UV cryostat 
452(Wetzlar, [LOCATION_013]). The sections will be fixed for 20 min with 4% PFA, washed with PBS 
453and dried at room temperature overnight. Sections will be washed 3 x with PBS and 
454incubated with PBS with 3% BSA and 0.4% triton X for 1 hour. Sections will then 
455incubated with Mab 3f52 (1:50 dilution) antibody overnight in PBS with 3% BSA and 
4560.4% triton X. Sections will be then washed 4 times with PBS and incubated with 
457biotinylated anti mouse IgG for 1 hour at room temperature, washed 4 times with PBS, 
458then incubated at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin for another 
459hour, washed 4 times with PBS and then incubated at room temperature with  alexa fluor 
460647 tyramide  for 10 min. Sections will be further washed 3 times and incubated with DAPI  
461(Thermo fisher, Waltham, MA) for 30 min. The samples will be washed 3 times with PBS 
462and mounted on Mowiol 4-88 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). The tyramide signal can 
463amplify from 10 to 200 times the immunofluorescence signal from low expressed proteins 
464(Molecular probes, Eugene, OR). The fluorescence images will be acquired using a Zeiss 
465LSM 710 confocal microscope (Oberkochen, [LOCATION_013]).

467Echocardiogram for EAT thickness measurement will be performed at baseline and after 
[ADDRESS_1220933] shown that intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of epi[INVESTIGATOR_874233] 
484excellent.  Intra-class correlation coefficients varied from 0.90 to 0.98 and from 0.93 to 
4850.98, respectively indicating good reproducibility and reliability. Both readers will be 
486blinded to the subjects’ clinical data. 
487Anthropometrics and Clinical measures: As standard of care, height (in cm) and weight 
488(in kg) will be measured, and BMI will be calculated. Waist circumference (in cm or 
489inches) will be measured as the minimum circumference between the lower rib margin and 
490the iliac crest. Blood pressure will be also measured. 
491Blood Measurements:Lipid panel, lipase, and amylase are not study end-points and will 
492be collected if made available through a standard of care procedure at baseline and after 4 
493or 12 weeks. 
494Low calorie Diet (LCD) A low calorie diet program will be prescribed to study patients 
495and controls. A RD who will reach out to patients to insure adherence to the dietary 
496program will supervise the LCD. This will help patients to achieve approximately 5% of 
497weight loss between 3 and 12 weeks. 
498Assessments for Safety
499Potential Risks to the Subjects
500The risks of this study are minimal are mainly related to risks associated with the 
501investigational drug liraglutide, echocardiogram, blood draw, and a potential breach of 
502confidentiality.
503Drug therapy: liraglutide, (Victoza®), is a GLP−1A indicated as an adjunct to diet and 
504exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM. Liraglutide is taken once daily 
505at any time of day, without regard to the timing of meals. Liraglutide is injected

14506subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Liraglutide may cause mild and 
507usually well-tolerable gastro-intestinal side effects (5%), such as nausea, constipation. 
508Liraglutide is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary 
509thyroid cancer and in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN). Based on 
510spontaneous postmarketing reports, acute pancreatitis has been observed in patients treated 
511with liraglutide. Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_874259] 
512symptoms on the drugs. In case that an acute pancreatitis will be suspected, lab and imaging 
513tests will be ordered. Marked or severe side effects will necessitate discontinuation of study 
514drug.
515Echocardiography: Diagnostic ultrasound imaging has been used in routine medical care 
516in various forms for over [ADDRESS_1220934] may 
518be experienced, but otherwise there are no known risks.
519Adipose tissue collection: Intra-operative collection of a very small sample of adipose 
520tissue do not represent a clinical relevant risk to the study subjects 
521Blood draw: Bruising at the intravenous puncture site may occur which will clear up in a 
522few days. Rarely the skin or vein at the site can become infected. A total of approximately

534study. We will follow safeguards to minimize the risk to our subjects: a) we will carefully 
535monitor response to medical treatment every [ADDRESS_1220937], b) as standard 
536clinical procedure women of reproductive age who are sexually active will undergo a urine 
537pregnancy tests prior to participation in the study, c) female subjects whom are pregnant, 
538breast-feeding, or not willing to use appropriate contraception at time of enrollment will 
539not be included in the study. Participation in a research study introduces some inherent loss 
540of privacy. However, full measure will be taken to protect the integrity of patient 
541identifying information. All data used in the analysis and reporting of this evaluation will 
542be without identifiable reference to the patient. Data used for reports or publications will 
543never include identifiable information such as name, date of birth, social security number, 
544address, or medical record number and in most cases will not include any identifiers other 
545than sex, age, race, and diagnosis. 
546Scheduling CABG timing
547In patients with stable CAD found to have CAD anatomy that requires CABG, the timing 
548and schedule for revascularization will be determined by [CONTACT_874260]. Patients suitable to 
549wait between 3 and 12 week- period for revascularization will be identified and managed 
550with optimal medical therapy, and scheduled for complete revascularization with CABG. 
551Managing patients becoming unstable or developi[INVESTIGATOR_874234]
552The inclusion and exclusion criteria will limit the possibility of recruiting patients with 
553unstable CAD/angina, as defined before. Study patients showing unstable angina or

555department for evaluation and treatment. If patient status becomes acute and emergent, the 
556adverse event will be reported to the IRB.
557Unblinding 
558The investigator will follow the study’s randomization procedures. The blind should 
559ordinarily be broken for serious and unexpected adverse experiences that are associated 
560with the use of a drug to determine if there is a reasonable possibility that the experience 
561may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641]. Certain adverse events such as known consequences 
562of the underlying disease under investigation or events common in the study population 
563generally should not require unblinding. 
564We feel that in the not likely case (given the inclusion criteria) that a study patient will 
565become unstable or develop acute events during the study, this event would more likely 
566fall in the known consequences of the underlying disease under investigation rather than 
567caused by [CONTACT_5257], and therefore should not require premature unblinding. 
568Nevertheless, it will be upon the principal investigator’s best judgement and discretion to 
- Study #: 20170684        Effective Date: 12/6/[ADDRESS_1220938] Compliance
573We estimate that the majority of the participants who will be considered eligible will 
574complete the study. Attrition can be estimated as lower than 10%.  In the event that 
575participants are lost to follow-up, the research coordinator will contact [CONTACT_7056] 
576participant by [CONTACT_756]. The research coordinator will be trained in effective telephone 
577technique to maximize recruitment success. All groups will receive lifestyle and diabetes 
578education, as part of the standard care, to insure similar glycemic control between arms. 
579Study patients will be advised to monitor their capi[INVESTIGATOR_874236], fasting in the 
580morning and post-prandially.  Glucose profile will be tracked bi-weekly by [CONTACT_53775]

583Statistical Considerations
584POWER ANALYSIS
585The statistical power (two-sided, α=0.05) of the study was calculated to detect statistically 
586and clinically meaningful differences in the primary endpoint between the two study arms.  
587Our preliminary data showed that EAT inflammatory genes, including IL-6 and TNF-α are 
588upregulated in subjects with T2DM and CAD and higher in EAT as compared to SAT 4-17. 
589From our recently published study, we calculated the average coefficient of variance (CV) 
590for differential inflammatory genes to be 42%, but for only 5 T2DM patients. 17 As there 
591are no data on the effects of liraglutide on EAT inflammation, the power analysis was based 
592on our previous data and on the assumption that the difference in EAT TNF-α and IL-6 
593expression between liraglutide treated and placebo treated patients would be clinically 
594meaningful at 33% (approx. 1.3X fold). Based on these data, we propose to sample [ADDRESS_1220939] therapy contributing EAT and SAT samples 
597collected during cardiac surgery. Using the power set at 90% and α=0.05, and given the 
598CV of 42%, this sample size will provide adequate power to detect the clinically significant 
599expected difference (33%) in EAT TNF-α and IL-[ADDRESS_1220940] would likely reduce the variability. To 
607further assure consistency of results, mRNA and protein expression values will be log-

615group very recently showed that additional therapy with liraglutide for 12 weeks caused a 
616reduction in ultrasound measured EAT from 9.6±2 to 6.2±1.5 mm (p< 0.001) in 54 patients 
617with T2DM 11.  Given the reference value and the expected difference in EAT, the 
618statistical power of the study (two-sided, α=0.05) was calculated.

629In those study patients who will not be able to complete the 12-week treatment, we 
630anticipate to see a 15% of EAT reduction after 3 weeks in patients who will be allocated to 
631liraglutide. This anticipated 15% of EAT reduction will remain clinically significant. For 
632example, a EAT thickness of [ADDRESS_1220944] to follow-up.

639Student’s t-test or non-parametric (Mann–Whitney) tests, depending on whether the genes 
640mRNA expression and protein present or not a normal distribution, will be used to compare 
641the effects of treatment (liraglutide versus placebo) on the variables measured.  Student’s 
642t-test will be also used to compare ultrasound measured EAT thickness before and after 
643treatments. Continuous variables will be considered as age-adjusted, sex-adjusted and 
644weight-adjusted means with their SDs or median, if values are skewed.

718during the trial at the investigator’s discretion.  As Iacobellis et al 12 recently showed no 
719significant effects of metformin on EAT, we do not anticipate that metformin dose 
720adjustment may influence the study outcomes.  
721Long acting insulins. Insulin is considered background medication (non-investigational 
722medicinal product) and will not be provided during the trial.  The total daily dose of insulin 
723could be adjusted during the trial at the investigator’s discretion.  Iacobellis’ group recently

20725inadequately controlled patients with type 2 diabetes following basal insulin initiation with 
726detemir vs. glargine. Not significant changes in EAT between detemir and glargine were 
727observed. 21 Based on these findings we do not anticipate that insulin treatment may 
728influence the study outcomes.  
729Sulfonylureas.  Sulfonylurea treatment is considered background medication (non-
730investigational medicinal product) and will not be provided during the trial.  During the 
731study, no up-titration of sulfonylurea dosage will be allowed.  Dose reduction of SU due to 
732hypoglycemia may be allowed at the investigators discretion.  In the event of 
733hypoglycemia, the dose of sulfonylurea can be reduced or the drug can be stopped at the 
734investigator’s discretion.   
735Adverse Events
736In the case of an adverse event (AE), the investigator will comply with all local legal, 
737regulatory, and IRB requirements. The investigator will report to IRB all adverse events 
738including not serious and serious adverse events (SAE), suspected unexpected serious 
739adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs), serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs).  The investigator 
740will report all SAEs, S[LOCATION_003]Rs, and SADRs at the same time such events are reported to 
741regulatory authorities or within [ADDRESS_1220950].
743The investigator will use the approved Updated Prescribing Information for Victoza®. The 
744investigator will collect the following information at minimum for each of these events: 1. 
745Study name2. Patient identification 3. Event (preferably a diagnosis) 4. Drug 5. Reporter 
746identification. 6. Causality 7. Outcome 
747Definitions An AE is any undesirable medical event occurring to a subject in a clinical 
748trial, whether or not related to the trial product(s). This includes events reported from the 
749first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until post 
750treatment follow-up period as defined in the protocol. The following should not be recorded 
751as AEs, if recorded as medical history/concomitant illness at screening:• Pre-planned 
752procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has    worsened from 
753the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent • Pre-existing 
754conditions found as a result of screening procedures
755Clinical Laboratory Adverse Event: A clinical laboratory AE is any clinical laboratory 
756abnormality regarded as clinically significant i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease 
757and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity, which requires active management, (i.e. change 
758of dose, discontinuation of trial product, more frequent follow-up or diagnostic 
759investigation).
760Serious Adverse Event (SAE): A serious AE is an experience that at any dose results in 
761any of the following:
762• Death
763• A life-threatening* experience
764• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
- Study #: 20170684        Effective Date: 12/6/[ADDRESS_1220951] always be considered an SAE
766• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity
767• A congenital anomaly/birth defect
768• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening*, or require 
769hospi[INVESTIGATOR_508453], based upon appropriate medical 
770judgement, they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical 
771intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition
772*The term life-threatening in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject 
773was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which 
774hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.
775SADR: an adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an adverse event for which a causal relationship 
776(Possible/Probable relation) between the study drug and the occurrence of the event is 
777suspected. The ADR should be classified as serious if it meets one or more of the 
778seriousness criteria. 
779Medical Events of Special Interest (MESI): A MESI is (1) a medication error (e.g. wrong 
780drug administration or wrong route of administration) or (2) a suspected transmission of an 
781infectious agent via the product
782Non-Serious Adverse Event: A non-serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the 
783definition of an SAE. Severity Assessment Definitions:
784• Mild: Transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities
785• Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities
786• Severe: Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities, unacceptable
787Relationship to study medication Assessment Definitions:
788• Probable: Good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship
789• Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed
790• Unlikely: The event is most likely related to an etiology other than the trial product
791 
792Outcome Categories and Definitions: • Recovered: Fully recovered or by [CONTACT_874263] 
793surgical treatment the condition has returned to the level observed at the first trial related 
794activity after the subject signed the informed consent• Recovering: The condition is 
795improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. This term should only be 
796used when the subject has completed the trial • Recovered with sequelae: As a result of the 
797AE, the subject suffered persistent and     significant disability/incapacity (e.g. became 
798blind, deaf, paralysed). Any AE recovered with sequelae should be rated as an SAE• Not 
799recovered• Fatal• Unknown
800Collection, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events: All events meeting the 
801definition of an adverse event will be collected and reported from the first trial related 
802activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until the end of the post-
803treatment follow-up period as stated in the protocol. 
804Follow-up of Adverse Events: During and following a subject’s participation in a clinical 
805trial, the investigator and institution will provide adequate medical care to the study subject 
- Study #: 20170684        Effective Date: 12/6/2022

22806for any study-related adverse events, including clinically significant laboratory values 
807related to the study. This medical care for study subjects will be provided regardless of 
808their insurance status. All adverse events classified as serious or severe or 
809possibly/probably related to the trial product will be followed until the subject has 
810recovered and all queries have been resolved. For cases of chronic conditions follow-up 
811until the outcome category is “recovered” is not required, as these cases can be closed with 
812an outcome of “recovering” or “not recovered”. All other adverse events will be followed 
813until the outcome of the event is “recovering” (for chronic conditions), or “recovered” or 
814until the end of the post-treatment follow-up stated in the protocol, whichever comes first, 
815and until all queries related to these AEs have been resolved.
816Pregnancy: Pregnancy test must be negative prior to be enrolled in the study, as per 
817standard care. However, study subjects will be instructed to notify the investigator 
818immediately if they become pregnant. The investigator will report to IRB any pregnancy

[ZIP_CODE] 21CFR 3 12.2 (B) EXEMPTIONS
858 (1)the clinical investigation  of a drug  product that is lawfully marketed in the 
859 united states is exempt from  the requirements of this part if all the following 
860 apply:
861
(i) The investigation is not intended to 
be reported to FDA as a well-controlled 
study  in support of a new indication for 
use nor intended to be used to support 
any other significant change in the 
labeling for the drug;Meets  criteria .
This clinical trial is not intended to be 
reported to the FDA in support of a 
new indication or change  in Victoza 
labeling.
(ii) If the drug  that is undergoing 
investigation is lawfully  marketed as a 
prescription drug product, the 
investigation is not intended to support a 
significant change in the advertising for 
the _product.Meets  criteria .
This investigation is not intended to 
support a significant chan ge in the 
Victoza advertising.
(iii) The investigation does  not involve a 
route of administration or dosage level or 
use in a patient population or other factor 
that significantly increases the risks (or 
decreases the acceptability of the risks) 
associated with the product Meets  criteria .
In this clinical trial liraglutide (and the 
matching placebo) will be administered 
according to the labeled route and dosage 
(Pre-filled, multi-dose pen for subcutaneous 
injection that delivers doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 
mg, or 1.8 mg (6 mg/mL, 3 mL). In this 
clinical trial liraglutide (and the matching 
placebo) will be used according to the 
indications.  Liraglutide will be used in adults 
with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in adjunct to diet 
and exercise advices and not as first-line 
therapy, as study patients will continue their 
standard diabetes therapy. Hence, 
liraglutide/placebo is prescribed under 
inclusion criteria that are the same as for 
marketed Victoza. Exclusion criteria for 
liraglutide are also the same as marketed 
Victoza.  This investigation will not increase 
the risks in the study population. 
(iv) The investigation is conducted in 
compliance with the requirements for 
institutional review set forth in part 56 and 
with the requirements for informed consent 
set forth in part 50;Meets  criteria .
This study will be reviewed and approved  
by [CONTACT_874266]. 
(v) The investigation is condu cted in 
compliance with the requirements of 21 
CFR 312.7.Meets  criteria .
Study Investigator, or any person acting  on 
behalf of the investigator, will not represent 
in a promotional context that  the study drug  
is safe or effective for the purposes  for 
which it is under  investigation or otherwise

This prospective, multi-center, clinical investigation is designed to examine the safety and 
efficacy/performance of the T2 Alpha Tibia Nailing System, in accordance with the approved instructions 
for use, labeling and instrumentation. The potential risks to subjects are described in the approved 
Instructions for Use and Operative Technique manuals. 
Potential benefits resulting from the T2 Alpha Tibia Nailing System over other devices and procedures, 
as demonstrated by [CONTACT_716346] (outlined in section 8), would also suggest affirmative clinical efficacy.  
6. Introduction 
The T2 Tibia Nailing System represented the latest and most comprehensive development of the original 
intramedullary principles presented by [CONTACT_716347] 1940. As an addition to the T2 
Nailing System, Stryker has created a new generation tibial implant that offers an efficient treatment 
option for multiple indications. The T2 Alpha Tibia Nail includes new locking options and the ability to 
utilize the advanced locking screw which creates an axial and angular stable construct. New 
instrumentation offers a combination of innovation, simplicity and efficiency that is designed to suit the 
various needs of surgeons and OR staff.  
7. Clinical Investigation Design

9.3. WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA 
If, during the clinical investigation, a subject must be prematurely withdrawn, the procedures outlined in 
this section must be followed. These procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new 
documented.  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the clinical investigation for any of the following reasons:  
a. Subject Withdrawal: A subject may voluntarily withdraw from the clinical investigation at any 
time and for any reason. The subject should be asked when possible, and without any form of 
coercion, the reason for his/her decision. If the participant withdraws from the clinical 
investigation completely, then data collected up until the point of withdrawal will be included in 
the final analysis. Subjects who decline to continue to take part will be given the opportunity to 
discuss/inform the research team of the reasoning behind their decision not to take part. 
b. Lost to Follow-Up (LTFU): A subject will be considered LTFU after all reasonable efforts have 
been made to contact [CONTACT_716348]/her continued participation in the clinical 
investigation. All attempts to contact [CONTACT_716349] a certified letter. Data collected 
up until the point where the subject is LTFU will be included in the final analysis. 
c. Removal of Device or Adverse Event/Incidentin the clinical investigation due to the removal of the Tibial Nail of the T2 Alpha Tibia Nailing 
System or Adverse Event/incident that prohibits his/her continued participation must be fully 
explained. All available information concerning the removal of the device or Adverse

Event/incident should be provided. Data collected up until the point of removal or Adverse 
Event/incident will be included in the final analysis. 
d. Death: The discontinuation 
must be fully explained. All available information concerning the death should be provided. 
Removal of a subject from continued follow-up in the clinical investigation due to death will not 
be considered a device failure unless the death is directly caused by, or attributable to, the T2 
Tibia Nailing System. Data collected up until the point of death will be included in the final 
analysis. 
e. Other: A subject may be withdrawn by [CONTACT_18611]/she believes that it is in the best 
the clinical investigation represents an unacceptable risk to the subject. The Sponsor must be 
notified immediately if this occurs. All data collected up until the point of withdrawal or IRB/EC 
determination will be included in the final analysis. 
A subject may also be withdrawn if the subject is non-compliant with the clinical investigation 
procedures or visits, or if a selection criteria violation is noted after the subject received the 
clinical investigation treatment and it is determined that the subject should be discontinued. All 
data collected up until the point of withdrawal will be included in the final analysis.

11. Statistical Methods
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) lists all variables/questions within this clinical investigation. 
 
Data will be captured via IBM Merge EDC system and statistical analysis will be performed using IBM 
SPSS. All statistical hypotheses tests will be with confidence levels (1- -

will indicate statistical significance. 
Results will be presented using summary tables and optionally supported by [CONTACT_5267]. For detailed 
information per variable, see SAP. 
11.1. DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
The [ADDRESS_976212]-operative results for subjects implanted with the Tibial Nail of the T2 Alpha Tibia 
Nailing System will be compared to a historical group and results reported by [CONTACT_107748], et al. (2017); 
Sanders, et al. (2014); Sun, et al. (2016); and Chan, et al. (2016) will serve as the control group for the 
T2 Alpha Tibia Nail subjects. 
Hypotheses were developed to allow for a comparison of [ADDRESS_976213]-operative SF-36 Physical 
Component Summary (PCS) results and 12 months effectiveness/performance between these two 
populations.

The results from the sources Chan et al, Sanders et al., and Sun et al. were pooled to determine overall two- sided 
90% confidence intervals of the mean SF-36 PCS (physical) and mean SF-36 MCS (mental) scores.  
Note: The results reported by [CONTACT_38874]. seemed to be based on a different calculation method for the determination of the SF- 36 scores and 
it was not possible to evaluate, what exactly was done by [CONTACT_89588]. The score values reported by [CONTACT_38874]. are much higher compared to 
what was normally reported in the literature and what was defined in country specific weights and coefficients. Wang et al. r eported median 
score values whereas the other authors reported mea ns. As summary score results usually tend to deviate from normality, means and medians 
might differ significantly. Therefore, the results reported by [CONTACT_38874]. were not included into the pooled analysis.

A second goal of this clinical investigation is to estimate the mean in the population. On average, a clinical 
investigation of this design would enable us to report the mean with a precision (95.0% confidence level) of 
plus/minus 2.[ADDRESS_976221] 
deviation (as well as sample size), and in any single clinical investigation will be narrower or wider than this 
estimate.

11.2. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
It is expected, that during this clinical investigation only one population for T2 Alpha Tibia will exist 
and er P
subjects might need to be excluded from the PP population. In this occasion, there will be two groups 
being fully analyzed to ensure transparency and avoid bias.  
The groups are defined as follows: 
 Intent-to Treat Population 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population is defined to be all enrolled subjects. An enrolled subject is a 
subject that has signed informed consent, all screening procedures have been successfully completed, 
is eligible and can receive treatment. The ITT population will not be analyzed for the annual reports 
and will only be included in the final report. 
 Per Protocol Population 
The Per Protocol (PP) Population is defined to be all subjects in the ITT Population with no major 
protocol violations. The protocol violations that will exclude a subject are as follows: 
 The subject does not receive the Tibial Nail of the T2 Alpha Tibia Nailing System 

T2 Alpha Tibia CIP  Version [ADDRESS_976222] outcomes. 
After the clinical investigation has been completed, a review of the data will be conducted to 
determine which subjects are to be excluded from the PP population. 
11.3. ANALYSIS PLAN BY [CONTACT_716352] 
11.3.1.  Statistical Analysis 
Evaluation elements are defined as the questions on the CRF/eCRF. The SAP lists all evaluation 
elements and secondary elements which will be based on calculations between two or more 
evaluation elements.  
All quantitative variables, including those based on calculations (secondary elements), will be 
analyzed with a case summary evaluation before the detailed characteristics and parameter can 
be evaluated. A case summary contains a listing of the number of valid cases/values, missing 
cases/values (if any) and total cases/values in the specific analysis. In general, as central position 
parameter for quantitative variables the mean, median and mode will be analyzed. As variation 
parameter the standard deviation, 95% confidence interval of the mean, interquartile range and 
range (based on maximum and minimum) will be calculated. All quantitative variables will be 
assessed for normality used the Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]-Wilk test. For optional visualization of quantitative 
variables, box-and-whisker plots will be used. Additional analyses like skewness and kurtosis 
measures of standard errors are also optional. 
All qualitative variables, including those based on summaries (secondary elements), will be 
analyzed listing the proportions, frequencies, column and row totals and missing proportion (if 
any). 
The SAP reflects this approach and specifies the variables characteristics (quantitative or 
qualitative) in detail together with the related analysis strategy. This also includes calculation 
and summaries based on primary elements and the required analysis. 
11.3.2.  Primary Analysis / Endpoint 
This analysis is only part of the final report. The primary endpoint analysis will only be executed 
once at the end of the clinical investigation and will not be part of any interim or annual reports 
or presentations given in front of the final report. 
The [ADDRESS_976223]-operative results for subjects implanted with the T2 Alpha Tibia Nailing 
System will be compared to Sanders et al: Semiextended intramedullary nailing of the tibia 
using a suprapatellar approach: radiographic results and clinical outcomes at a minimum of 12 
months follow-up. J Orthop Trauma, 2014; Sun et al: The outcome comparison of the 
suprapatellar approach and infrapatellar approach for tibia intramedullary nailing. Int Orthop, 
2016; and Chan et al: Suprapatellar Versus Infrapatellar Tibial Nail Insertion: A Prospective 
Randomized Control Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]. J Orthop Trauma, 2016Specifically, the SF-36 score results 
reported by [CONTACT_107748], et al. (2017), Sanders, et al. (2014), Sun, et al. (2016) and Chan, et al. (2016) 
will serve as the control groups for the T2 Alpha Tibia group. 
Higher SF-[ADDRESS_976224]-operative SF-36

12 months will be monitored through collection and analyses. Both analyses will be part of the 
annual and final reports. 
Furthermore, device related adverse events/incidents and the time to (earliest) Device Related 
Adverse Events/incidents will be analyzed as well. Considered variables, the level of 
measurement and the planned analysis steps are listed in detail in the SAP. 
11.3.4.  Additional Analyses 
Additional Analyses are outlined in the subsequent sections. Analysis details (variables, level 
of measurement, planned steps) are listed in-depth in the SAP. 
o Weight-bearing status  
The weight bearing status will be evaluated and analyzed at the pre-operative visit and 
at [ADDRESS_976229] changes from visit 
to visit will be analyzed in addition. This analysis will be part of the annual and final 
reports. 
o Mortality  
For analysis of the time to death or mortality, the Kaplan-Meier method will be used. 
The times between the date of surgery and the date of the 12 months assessment will be 
used together with the times between surgery and the date of death. This analysis will 
be part of the annual and final reports. 
o Reoperation  
For analysis of the time to the reoperation, the Kaplan-Meier method will be used. The 
times between the date of surgery and the date of the 12 months assessment will be used 
together with the times between date of surgery and the date of reoperation (earliest 
reoperation in case that one subject experienced more than one reoperation). This 
analysis will be part of the annual and final reports. 
o SF-[ADDRESS_976230] level. This analysis will be part of 
the annual and final reports.  
11.4. MISSING DATA / SAP DEVIATIONS 
The intent  is to collect as complete a dataset as possible. Nevertheless, in some situations missing 
data cannot be avoided. The reports and tables therefore will show the number and percentage 
of missing cases for each analyzed variable in relation to the enrolled cases for each post-
operative assessment 
Any deviations  from Statistical Analysis Plan will be listed in the annual or final reports.

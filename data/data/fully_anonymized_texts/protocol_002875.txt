Amendment 1 ( 26-Apr-2017 )
Amendment rationale
The purpose of this amendment is to revise the extension study  design to align it with changes 
recentl y implemented in the core study  CBYM338E2202 while maintaining and further 
focusing the primary  purpose of the extension study  to evaluat ethe durability  of effect of [ADDRESS_264733] of 24 weeks of bimagrumab treatment would be maintained following treatment 
discontinuation and if a 48 weeks continuous treatment would provi de additional benefit over 
a 24 weeks treatment period. The randomized withdrawal feature of the design reduced the 
sample size of each treatment arm with the risk of not being able to address the questions . 
[COMPANY_001] with this amendment is removing this withdrawal randomization feature and is 
refocusing the study  on one main question: how long the potentiall y observed effect safter [ADDRESS_264734] once the treatment is discontinued? Therefore, 
all newly  enrolled patients in this extension study  will be followed off drug for a period of [ADDRESS_264735] antially  reduce patient burden and facilitate 
study  acceptance. However in order to promote patients ’engagement and adherence to the 
study , there is arequired exercise program and, monthly  phone calls will 
be made to patients.
Patient s active in the study  upon implementation of this protocol amendment will remain on 
the original protocol visit schedule which reflects the randomized withdrawal design . This 
way all patients enrolled in this study  prior to this protocol amendment will have a similar 
journey  and even if the sample is small (estimated to approx. 45 patients) this sub-group of 
patient swill provide valuable inform ation on the effect of prolonged treatment for 49 weeks. 
At the time of this protocol amendment’s implementation it is anticipated that [ADDRESS_264736] of the program. In addition ,following this 
interim analy sis, the global study  team will be unblinded to the individual treatment codes 
from those patients included in this analysis. However, [COMPANY_001] associates in the countries 
and site personnel will remain blinded to the treatment codes until the final study  data base 
lock.
The rational for the changes implemented in the core study  such as the change of primary  
endpoint, the reduction of the cardiac safety  monitoring,  
 
are described in the core protocol amendment #2 (CBYM338E2202).
At the time of this amendment, approximately  45patients have been enrolled in the study . 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page [ADDRESS_264737] (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC) and Health 
Authorities. 
The main changes are the following:
Re-focus of the study  on assessing the durability  of effect of bimagrumab over a 24 week 
period offdrug. As a result the withdrawal randomization design feature is removed and 
all newly  enrolled patient s are followed off drug, while patients previously enrolled will 
complete the study  more or less as per the original visit schedule
Study  is reduced to [ADDRESS_264738]  
other associated feedback from study  participants . 
Addition of a planned interim anal ysis
Theneed for unblinding of core treatment code for newl y enrolled patients will follow the 
core stud y protocol procedure .
All IMP related sections are onl y applicable to those patients enrolled under the original 
protocol version
Inclusion/exclusion criteria wer e simplified as only  patients willing and having full y 
completed the 24 weeks of core stud y treatment are eligible
As part of the alignment between the core and the extension studies, the following key  
changes are implemented in this extension study :
The S PPB replaced the 6MWT as primary  endpoint , the 6MWT changed to a 
secondary  endpoint
The [ADDRESS_264739] was removed 
Echocardiograph y was eliminated and overall cardiac monitoring was reduced from a 
level of intense monitoring to one reflecting standard of care following the results of 
the dedicated profiling cardiac safet y study
Additional safet y monitoring guidance for patients with change in bod y weight since 
the core stud y baseline of +/ - 5%
Removal of certain central laboratory  assessments (i.e. urinal ysis, coagulation 
measurement)
e-devices diaries  are replaced by  [CONTACT_220430]
 
The frequency  of the DXA assessment was reduced to a final one at the E OS only

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page [ADDRESS_264740] of 6 monthly  doses of bimagrumab on skeletal muscle mass, 
strengt h and function in older patients with sarcopenia.
Sarcopenia, the age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and physical function (Cruz-
Jentoft et al 2010 ; Fielding et al 2011 ), is a common geriatric syndrome with approximately  
2-13% of individuals over 65 y ears and up to 30% of adults over 80 y ears affected ( Dam 2014 , 
Volpato 2013 ). While there is no single set of diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia, multiple 
consensus statements all agree that reductions of muscle mass and gait speed (GS) are the key 
patient characteristics of sarcopenia with only subtle differences with respect tothe 
recommended cutpoints for each of these measures. More recentl y, in the first data-driven 
analysis of older adult subjects, cutpoints were recommended for both of these measures as 
well as grip strength (Studen ski 2014 ). 
The most well accepted sarcopenia criteria at this time 
are those from the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older Persons (EWGSOP) and 
the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia , and subjects enrolled in the Phase IIb study  in 
sarcopenia (E22 02) must meet the universal thresholds for gait speed and geographic specific
thresholds for muscle mass for entry  into the study ( Cruz- Jentoft 2010 ).  
Sarcopenia is associated with a myriad of complications, inclu ding mobility  limitations, an 
increased risk of falls, fractures and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], as well as additional healthcare costs, 
and increased mortality (Cruz- Jentoft 2010 , Janssen 2004 , Visser 2011 ). In addition, 
sarcopenic patients frequently  require assistance with basic and instrumental activities of dail y 
living (e.g., bathing, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) and lose independence. The societal cost of sarcopenia was 
calculated at over 18 billion US dollars in 200
0 (Janssen 2004 ).   
Currently , there is no pharmacological treatment for sarcopenia and recommended treatment 
for sarcopenia includes strength training and nutritional optimization (e.g., protein and 
Vitamin D).
As a potent inhibitor of the Activin Type II receptor (ActRII), bimagrumab blocks the effects 
of negative regulators of muscle growth including myostatin, activin A, and GDF11 working 
through thisreceptor. An accelerated loss of muscle mass, strength and physical function in 
the large and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_220408] a substantial, unmet medical 
need and a novel opportunity  for a pharmacotherapeutic that can promote skeletal muscle 
hypertrophy  and improve patient function.
The efficacy  and safety of bimagrumab in sarcopenia is currently being evaluated in the 
CBYM 338E220 2core study . The core study  protocol and the study  design were substantially  
amended in September 2016, including changes tothe primary  and some of secondary  
endpoint s.
To maintain consistency with the core study (CBYM338E2202) , the Short Physical 
Performance Battery  (SPPB) has become the primary  endpoint for this extension trial and
several other pertinent f unctional measures (e.g., [ADDRESS_264741] (6MWT ), gait speed (GS) , 
spontaneous phy sical activity ) will be collected as  secondary   endpoi nts.

1.2 Purpose 
The purpose of this extension study  (CBYM338E2202E1) is to evaluate the durability of 
effect on skeletal muscle mass , strength and physical function following 24 weeks of 
treatment with bimagrumab, in older patients with sarcopenia upon discontinuation of 
treatment. 
The results of this extension study  will support the design of a phase III study  of bimagrumab 
treatment for sarcopenia.

After completing 24 weeks of treatment in the core study  (CBYM338E 2202 End of Treatment 
(EOT )visit) , newl y consenting patients in the extension study  CBYM338E2202E1 will 
continue with the same uniquely  identified patient number that was assigned in the core study
and will be followed for an additional 24 weeks off drug (see Figure 3 -1).  The y willcomplete 
theend of stud y (EOS) at week 49. 
Patients enrolled prior to thisamendment #1, will follow the original study  design described 
below Figure 3-2and will continue to be treated as per the regimen assigned at entry  of the 
extension study . It is anticipated that approximately a total 45 patients will be followed under 
this design and 10 to 15 of them will still be inthe study  at the time of implementing this
amendment #1.

Exercise program
All patients will be requested to continue their home exercise program (2-3 times each week) 
as it was prescribed and performed in the core study , CBYM338E2202. At the patient’s 
request, the study  staff will be able to provide a new set of exercise instruc tions in order to 
encourage stud y participation and adherence.
The exercise program contains activities for muscle strength, endurance, balance and 
flexibility , as well as warm -up (i.e. walking) and cool-down periods to improve comfort, 
prepare the body  for increased effort, and reduce the risk of training injuries. The exercise 
program is described in detail in the CBYM338E2202E1 Outcomes Manual.
 
 
 
Week 25 /EOT –Joined Core and Extension visit
All EOT assessments of the core study  will be performed [ADDRESS_264743] dose of study  
drug as outlined in core study  CBYM338E2 202.  Consenting, eligible patients will start in 
this extension study  on the same day  (i.e., EOT visit of CBYM338 E2202). 
The ability  and willingness of the patient to continue performing the home -based exercise 
program should be re -assessed by  [CONTACT_1720] a team member during this visit. 
For a complete list of assessments, please refer to Section 6 Table 6 -1.

Management of patients enrolled prior to the protocol amendment #1
Patients enrolled prior to the study  amendment #1 will continue to be dosed every  4 w eeks 
until week 49 (EOT) and will then have a 4 weeks follow -up period until week 53 (EOS) . 
These patients will also continue the exercise program described above.
Please refer to Section [ADDRESS_264745] of 
assessments for these patients .
3.2 Rationale of study  design
The aim of developi[INVESTIGATOR_220409] y adults with sarcopenia is to enable 
them to increase their physical function to a certain level that they could afterwards maintain
without any support other than regular exercise and potentially  vitamin D supplementation. 
This extension study  is the natural follow -up of the patients treated for 24 weeks in the core 
study ;it will evaluate the changes in phy sical function of this patient population over 24 week 
off-treatment period as well asassess the ov erall lon g-term safety  of bimagrumab . 
The study  population will be comprised of men and women aged 70 years or older with 
sarcopenia who participated in the core study  CBYM 338E2202. Only  patients who complete 
the 24 weeks oftreatment in the core study  will be eligible for this study  given the purpose to 
evaluate the durability  of 24-week therapy . Of the 293 patients expected to enroll in the core Randomization: Patients randomized to either placebo or continuation of E2202 Bimagrumab dose RTreatment free

#[ADDRESS_264746] astandardize dexercise program . The schedule of two to 
three exercise sessi ons perweek will be maintained throughout the studies (core and 
extension) and will serve as a standard of care together with the vitamin D supplementation .
The code of the treatment received in the core study  will remain blinded to sites and patients 
forthe entire study  duration including this extension study . This will avoid a potential 
reporting bias that patients and site staff may otherwise have when assessing ph ysical function, 
mobility  or reporting safety .
In line with the primary  endpoint used in the core study , the extension will use the SPPB total 
score as the primary  endpoint. The SPPB score and 4-meter gait speed have emerged as the 
predominant measures that characterize impaired lower extremity  function in older adults in 
general and in those with sarcopenia and frailty  (Studenski et al 2014 ). 
As the natural follow -up of the core study  population, a number of efficacy (e.g. SPPB, ) 
or safet y (vital signs, laboratory  measurements, cardiac adjudication) assessments are being 
carried over in the extension study  in order to fully evaluate the patient journey  over 
approximately  a
 1 year period. Given the absence of required monthly  druginfusion, the
frequency  of the visits is reduced in comparison to the core study  in order to limit patients’ 
burden. However, in order to maintain patient’s compliance and avoid under -reporting of 
events such as  monthly phone calls to the patients will be performed.
As patients enrolled prior to the protocol amendment #1 will differ (e.g. placebo effect) from 
patients newl y enrolled in the extension, it was decided to keep them on their 4 -weekl y dosing 
regimen as originall y designed, to maximize theunderstanding oftheseregimen. They  will 
therefore follow a different visit schedule.
3.3 Rationale of dose/regimen, route of administration and duration 
of treatment
This extension study  will assess the durability  of the observed effect of bimagrumab upon 
treatment discontinuation . There is therefore no study  drug administration as part of this study 
for patients enrolled following protocol amendment #1.
3.4 Rationale for choice of comparator
Not applicable .
3.5 Purpose and timing of interim analy ses/design adaptati ons
An interim analy sis will be triggered by [CONTACT_220432] A. This interim analy sis will analyze key efficacy  data . The results from 
the interim analy sis, together with core study  Part Aand any additional data on the rest of the 
program ,will be used for the next step decision making.

The risks of bimagrumab are not fully understood, but in healthy  young, middle aged, and 
older adults and in patients with sporadic inclusion body  myositis (sIBM) up through [ADDRESS_264748] common AEs include a 
transient skin condition (acne) and involuntary  muscle contractions (i.e., twitches/spasms) as 
well as transient diarrhea .  Transient increases in AST and ALT have been observed, 
sometimes in association with CK elevation (suggesting a muscle source) and sometimes not. 
Other observed adverse events (AEs)include arthralgia, muscle strain erythema andrash.  
 
there have been no adverse cardiac findings in humans with current dose levels and regimens. 
Refer to the Investigator ’s Brochure for a thorough evaluation of expected adverse events
observed in clinical studies to date as well as data from in vivo pharmacology , animal 
toxicology , animal and human pharmacokinetic ( PK), immunogenicit y studies. 
Blood draw risks
During the collection of blood samples, patients may experience pain and/or bruising at the 
insertion site of the needle/catheter. Although rare, localized clot formation, infections and 
nerve injury  may occur. Lightheadedness and/or fainting may also occur during or shortl y 
after the blood draw. Patients will be observed following all blood draws and discharged only  
when the Investigator observes stable health status. In addition, liquids by [CONTACT_220433], fruit juice or a similar product will be provided following the blood draw to 
replenish the blood volume removed.
Imaging risks
This clinical study  involves exposure to radiation from a DXA total body  scan. The radiation 
exposure by  [CONTACT_220434] l care but is intended for research purposes only . 
The  total  amount  of  radiation  exposure  per  patient  from  DXA  will  be  about  25  µSv. 
For effective radiation doses under 3 mSv (300 mrem), the risk is considered to be "minimal". 
Therefore, the radiation exposure in this study  involves minimal risk and is necessary  to 
obtain the research information desired (Njeh 1999 ). DXA measures are also described as 
having no observable or biological effect and are similar to natural background levels of 
radiation in most countries. Therefore, DXA scans within the study  period need not be limited 
from a safet y perspective.
Exercise -related injuries
During 
the study , the patients will be required to perform a prescribed set of exercises 2-3
times each week. The exercise program will involve warm -up (i.e., walking) and cool -down 
periods to improve comfort, prepare the body  for increased effort, and reduce the risk of 
injury .

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page [ADDRESS_264749] alread y been participating in the exercise program for the 
full 8 month duration of the core study . In addition, the exercise programs will be tailored to 
each individual’s level of fitness and interest during the evaluation and mid-study  visit with 
the site staff.

2.Written informed consent must be obtained before any  assessment of the extension 
study  is performed ( can be obtained at the EOT visit of the core stud y).
4.2 Exclusion criteria
  This is an extension study  and has the same exclusions as the core study . Because only 
participants who complete the core study  are eligible for inclusion in this study , patients who 
no longer quali fy or should be discontinued from the core study  are excluded from 
participating in this study . Patients fulfilling the following criteri onare not eligible for 
inclusion in this study :
1.Any condition which should have led to treatment di scontinuation per p rotocol in the core 
study
No additional exclusions may be applied by [CONTACT_093], in order to ensure that the study  
population will be representative of all eligible patients, within and across study  sites.
5 Treatment
5.1 Protocol requested treatment
5.1.1 Inves tigational treatment
Patients newly  enrolled after protocol amendment #1will not receive any investigational 
treatment as part of this protocol . 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 22
Clinical Trial Protocol v01 clean Protocol No. CBYM338E2202E1
For patients enrolled prior to protocol amendment #1 the investigational treatment is as follow:
Bimagrumab  prepared by [CONTACT_220435].
Placebo will be a Dextrose 5% in water infusion supplied by  [CONTACT_220436] a separate pharmacy  manual.
5.1.[ADDRESS_264753] 0.8 g protein/kg 
and 20 kcals/kg of body  weight throughout the study . If it is determined to be necessary  from 
one of the planned diet assess ments, patients will be instructed to consume a nutritional 
supplement to ensure adequate protein intake .
Even though patients enrolled based on protocol amendment #1 will not be exposed to 
bimagrumab or placebo, during this extension study, all enrolled patients in this study will receive 
specific study  treatments as part of this protocol:
Vitamin D supplementation
Exercise program
The vitamin D3(or D2 if D3 is not available) supplements will be locally  sourced with a 
recommended dosage :
-daily  administration of 800 IU to 4000 IU vitamin D3 (dose chosen by  [CONTACT_220437]); or,
-equivalent weekl y or monthly  formulation if deemed to be of advantage for the 
individual patient’s compliance.
Exercise program i s presented in more details in Section 3.1 .
5.2 Treatment arms
Patients enrolled following protocol amendment #1 will not receive investigational treatment.
Patients enrolled prior to the protocol amendment #[ADDRESS_264754] been assigned to one of the 
following 2 treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1 to receive i.v. doses of the following and will 
continue with this treatment until their EOT:
1.  Patients on BYM338 70 mg in core study were randomized 1:1 to receive either BYM338 
70 mg or placebo (BYM 70/PBO) for 6 doses in the extension study
2.  Patients on BYM338 210 mg in core study  were randomized 1:1 to receive either BYM338 
210 mg or placebo (BYM 210/PBO) for 6 doses in the ext ension study
3.  Patients on BYM338 700 mg in core study  were randomized 1:1 to receive either BYM338 
700 mg or placebo (BYM 700/PBO) for 6 doses in the extension study

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 23
Clinical Trial Protocol v01 clean Protocol No. CBYM338E2202E1
5.4 Treatment blinding
Patients as well as the site staff will remain blinded to core treatment allocation as well as the 
extension randomizat ion code for patients enrolled prior to the extension protocol amendment 
#[ADDRESS_264755] access to the treatment codes after the interim anal ysis.  Other [COMPANY_001] team members in 
the countries will remain blinded until the final study  data base lock .
The following methods will be used to maintain the blind: (1) Randomization data are kept 
strictly confidential until the time of un-blinding and will not be accessible by [CONTACT_220438]-blinded pharmacist and the  bioanalyst. (2) Any 
potential visible difference in treatments will be concealed by [CONTACT_2224] a n opaque sleeve
(applicable only for patients enrolled prior to amendment#1 . (3)Any potentially  unblinding 
parameters (e.g. DXA results) will not be available to the patient, site or study  team, 
Randomization data are strictly  confidential and will be accessible only to authorized 
personnel until un-blinding as described above . The study  bioanal yst will receive a copy of 
the randomization schedule to facilitate analysis of the samples. Both the un-blinded 
pharmacist and bioanaly st will keep treatment allocation information confidential. Un-
blinding will only occur in the case of patient emergencies (see Section 5.5.13 ) and as 
described above .
IMPORTANT for sites with patients enrolled prior to protocol amendment #1: Due to the 
difference in preparation methods between the active and placebo treatments, an un-blinded 
pharmacist who is independent of the study  team will be required. This un -blinded pharmacist 
will receive the appropriate treatment allocatio n.Appropriate measures must be taken by [CONTACT_220439]-blinded pharmacist to ensure that the study  team remains blinded throughout the course of 
dose administrations and the remainder of the study even in the follow -up epoch.
5.5 Treating the patient 
5.5.1 Patient numbering 
Patients in the extension study C BYM 338E2202 E1 will continue with the same uniquely
identifi ed patient numberthat was assigned in the core study .
As in the core study , the patient number is a combination of a four digit center number, which 
isprovided by [CONTACT_5343], and a three digit sequential number allocated by [CONTACT_093], 
starting with 001. Therefore, if the center number is 1001, the patient numbers will be 
assigned such as 1001001, 1001002, etc. in ascending order. If the center numb er is 1002, the 
patient numbers will be assigned such as 1002001, 1002002, etc.
Patients willbe given the informed consent form ( ICF) during one of the scheduled visit s (e.g., 
Week 25 or at earlier visi t)in stud y CBYM338E2202 to read and understand for their
participation in this extension study. Patients will NOT be signi ngthe ICF before completing
theWeek 25 (EOT ) assessments ofthe core st udy.  
Patients who ar e eligible based on th e inclusion/exclusion criteria wi llbe as kedto sign t he 
ICF. If the patient fails for any reason, he/she should not enter the extension and should 
complete the EoS visit of the core study as per the core study protocol .

For patients enrolled prior to protocol amendment#[ADDRESS_264756] of the shipment and dispensing of study  
drug in a drug accountability  ledger. Drug accountability  will be noted by [CONTACT_220441] -blinded 
Monitor during site visits and/or at the completion of the trial.
All drug supplies are to be used only for this protocol and not for any other purpose. Unless 
specificall y instructed by [CONTACT_5343], the Investigator must not destroy  any drug labels, or any 
used, partl y used or unused drug supply.
At the conclusion of the study , and, if allowed during the course of the study  (e.g.,the un-
blinded monitor), the Investigator will provide a copy  of the drug accountability  ledger to the 
Monitor.
Only  after receiving a written authorization by [CONTACT_5343], the Investigator/designee will send 
all the unused and partly  used drug supplies as well as the empt y containers to the address 
provided at the time of authorization for destruction or have the unused and partly  used drug 
supplies as well as the empty  containers destro yed by [CONTACT_779]’s pharmacist, providing a drug 
destruction certificate ( appropriate local SOP must be in place).
ForALL patients enrolled in the study
As in the core study , to avoid Vitamin D deficiency during the extension study , all patients 
will continue to receive vitamin D3 supplementation (or D2 if D3 is not possible) (800 IU-
4000 IU per day ) from the start of the study  to the EOS visit. The vitamin D supplements will

Forpatients enrolled prior to the protocol amendment#[ADDRESS_264760] discontinuation
The investigator should discontinue study  treatment for a given patient if, on balance, he/she 
believes that continuation would be detrimental to the subject’s well -being.
Investigational treatment must be discontinued under the following circumstances:
Use of prohibited treatment as per Table 5 -1.
Any other protocol deviation that results in a significant risk to the patient’s safety
Breaking of the blind (inadvertently or for emergency reasons)
Severe hypersensitivity  reaction occurs

Liver event definition met as per Appendix 1
Total of t wo(2) doses were miss ed in the entire study
Death
Withdrawal of consent
Sponsor decision to terminate (part of) the study
Investigational treatment may  be discontinued under the following circumstances:
Emergence of one or more adverse events that in the judgment of the inves tigator, taking 
into account the patient’s overall status, prevent the patient from safely continuing in the 
study
Any laboratory  abnormalities that in the judgment of the investigator, taking into 
consideration the patient’s overall status, prevents the patient from safely continuing in the 
study
Patients who discontinue study  treatment should NOT be considered withdrawn from the 
study  UNLESS they withdraw their consent (see Section 5.5.11 ). They  should return as close 
to [ADDRESS_264761] the I RT to register the patient’s discontinuation from treatment.
For patients enrolled after the protocol amendment#1.
Patients have to be discontinued from the study  if they receive any of the prohibited 
medication listed in Section 5.5.9. 
Patient can be discontinued if in the judgment of the investigator, taking into account the patient’s 
overal l status prevent sthe patient from safely continuing in the study .
Patients should then return to the site to perform the EOSvisit as soon as possible and not later

6 Visit schedule and assessments
For patients enrolled after the protocol amendment #1, thefull assessment schedule is
presented in Table 6-1below. Patients enrolled prior to the protocol amendment #1 will be 
followed according to the visit scheduled presented in Table 6 -2.
In order to allow sufficient reflection time for the informed consent process, the extension 
study  may be presented and discussed early enough in the core study  in order to allow the I CF 
signature [CONTACT_220472] 25/core EOT visit. The ICF must not be signed 
before thecore EOT visit to avoid complications in the safet y reporting requirements.
Patients following Table 6-1should be seen for all visits on the des ignatedday within a
recommended‘visit windo w’ of +/- [ADDRESS_264767] be the same day as the EOT visit of 
the core (i.e. the visit date is the date of the EOT visit of the core). 
Patients sh ould arrive to the visit fasted when blood samples for laboratory  assessments will 
be taken at that visit .
Assessments for a particular visit may be split over several days. These may not be 
consecutive day s but should respect the visit window period.
Below are some recommendatio ns for or ganizing and perfor ming the st udy assessments at 
visits with blood sampling .
Assessments should be performed sequentially  in the morning as follows: ECG collection, 
vital signs, blood sampling.
After blood sampling, patients should be offered breakfast.
For patients enrolled prior to the protocol amendment #1, the visits window to be applied is 
+/- [ADDRESS_264768] awtheir consent ( seeSection 5.5.11 ) .They  should return and complete 
the EOS visit. If they fa ilto return fo r these visits for unkno wn reasons, every effort should

investigational drug, a standardi zedprocess for identifi cation, moni toring and evaluation o f 
liver events has to b e f ollowed.
Liver events are divided into two categories:
L
iver events of special interest (AESI) whi ch consist of elevated transa minases and/o r 
bilirubin (elevated li ver function tests (LFTs )).
Medically significant liver events which are considered as serious adverse events
(SAEs ) and which consist of marked elevations of LFTs and / or pre-specified adverse
e
vents. 
Please refer to Table 13 -1-Appendix 1 f or complete d efinitions of li ver events.
Any live r event which m eets the criteria for a “medically s ignificant” event sh ou ld follow the
standa rd procedure s for S AEreportingasdescribedinSection 7.2 .
Every liver event as defined in Table 13-1- Appendix 1s hould be follow edupbyt he

9 Data analy sis 
9.1 Analysis sets 
Full anal ysis set (FAS): The FAS comprises all subjects enrolled in the study ..
Safety  set (SAF): The safety  set comprises all subjects who received at least one dose of study  
drug from the core or extension study  and enrolled in the extension study . 
Per
-protocol set (PP): The Per-protocol set comprises all subjects in the FAS who do not have 
major protocol deviations that could confound the interpretation of analyses conducted on the 
FAS. The following are common examples of such protocol deviations: 
•Subject entered the stud y even though they  did not satisfy the entry  criteria
• Subject developed study/treatment withdrawal criteria during the study  but was not 
withdrawn
• Subject received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose
•Subject took a prohibited concomitant medication
The PP set will be identified and finalized based on blinded review of the data, prior to the 
database lock.
To facilitate different analy sis on patients enrolled before and after the protocol amendment, 
two populations are defined as in below: 
Population Iis defined to include patients enro lled prior to protocol amendment 1, who 
will be continuing the treatment as originally  assigned and follow the original schedule 
until end of the study . 
Population IIis defined to include patients enrolled after protocol amendment 1, who will 
be followed up per schedule defined in this protocol amendment.

Demographic variables taken at screening, including age, sex, child bearing potentia l of 
female subjects, height, weight, body  mass index of baseline, race and ethnicity , will be 
summarized. 
Baseline characteristics may include and are not limited to: nutritional status,  exercise, 
tobacco/alcohol use, quadriceps strength, total and appe ndicular LBM ,SPPB and6MWT.
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum , Q1 and Q3 ) 
will be presented for continuous variables for each treatment group and overall in the FAS. 
The number and percentage of subjects in each category  will be presented for categorical 
variables for each treatment group and overall.

The duration of exposure to study  drug will be summarized by [CONTACT_220457] a 
continuous variable. 
For Population I, prior and concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_220458].  Medications will be presented in alphabetical 
order, by [CONTACT_220459] (the 1stlevel of the ATC codes). Tables will also show the 
overall number and percentage of subjects receiving at least one drug of a particular ATC 
code and at least one drug in a part icular anatomical main group. 
Prior medications are defined as drugs taken and stopped prior to first dose of study  treatment.  
Any medication given at least once between the day of first dose of study  treatment and the 
date of the last study  visit will be a concomitant medication, including those which were 
started pre-baseline and continued into the treatment epoch . Prior or concomitant medication 
will be identified based on recorded or imputed start and end dates of medication taking. If it 
cannot be established that the use of a prior medication has ended prior to the first dose of 
study  treatment due to a missing end date, then it will be considered concomitant.  
For Population II, no exposure will be presented, but concomitant medications will be 
presented.

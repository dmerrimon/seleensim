Protocol Number : VZU0002 5 
Study Phase : Phase 2 
Study Endpoints:  
  The Primary Efficacy endpoint of this study will be to examine the 
extent of reduction in the WOMAC pain  score, relative to baseline, 
provided by [CONTACT_497231], one -hour application of Vehicle 
(CGS-200-0), CGS-200-1, and CGS-200-5 at the following 
assessment times:  
 
Baseline: < [ADDRESS_639361] daily application  
Day 35  31 Days (+/ - 3 days) after fourth daily application  
 
and based thereon to determine whether the responses for treatment 
with CGS -200-1 and CGS-200-05 are significantly different from 
Vehicle (CGS-200-0) and from each other at the primary endpoint 
time.  
 
The Primary Safety  endpoints  will be: 
 
(1) The application of the study drug does not produce skin 
reactions (erythema, scaling, pruritus, or other) to a degree 
that is clinically of concern. Scoring of eryth ema and scaling 
at the application sites and of pruritus will be assessed per the 
scoring systems in  Appendix F. 
 
(2) No SAE’s either possibly, probably, or definitely associated 
with study treatments.  
 
(3) Safety labs (hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis ) do 
not produce other than minimal – mild toxicities (Grade 1 or 
Grade 2). Scoring of clinical, hematological and urinalysis out 
of range fin dings for toxicity grading will be per  Appendix B.

FINAL / Version 5.[ADDRESS_639362] -2018 Page 4  Secondary Efficacy endpoints will be: 
 
(1) To examine the extent of reduction in the WOMAC pain  score, 
relative to baseline, provided by [CONTACT_497231], one -hour 
application of Vehicle (CGS -200-0), CGS-200-1 and 
CGS-200-5 at the following assessment times:  
 
Baseline: < [ADDRESS_639363] daily application  
Day 5   24 hrs (+/- 3) after last of the 4 daily applications  
Day 19  15 days (+/ - 3) after last of the 4 daily applications  
Day 64  60 days (+/ - 3) after the last of 4 daily applications  
Day 94  90 days (+/ - 3) after the last of 4 daily applications  
 
(2) Day 5, 19, 35, 64, and 94 W OMAC scores on the stiffness and 
function subscales as well as total WOMAC score  (including 
the WOMAC pain score).  
 
 
Secondary Safety  endpoints will be:  
 
(1) The distribution by [CONTACT_497232]  
(AEs) (e.g ., local application site reactions, and other AEs 
(inclusive of findings for hematology and serum chemistry )).  
(2) Evaluate the amount of concomitant pain medications used 
overtime 
 
Tolerability  endpoints (which are secondary in nature) will be:  
 
(1) The application of study drug does not produce burning -
stinging pain (“BSP”) at the application site to a degree that is 
not acceptable to the subject. BSP at the application site, this 
will be assessed using a 0 – 10 NRS sca le without guideposts. 
“Acceptability” of BSP will be queried per subject at the end 
of each application period.  
 
(2) The application of the study drug does not produce pruritus 
during application or in the [ADDRESS_639364], cannot be managed by [CONTACT_497233] a cold pack 
or compress

STUDY SYNOPSIS  (continued)  
FINAL / Version 5.[ADDRESS_639365], excluding screening.  
Study Design:  This is a multi -center, randomized, double -blind clinical trial in subjects 
with OA according to the 1986 American College of Rheumatology 
(ACR) criteria. There will be with three study arms:  
 
Arm 1  CGS-200-0 (Investigational Drug Product Vehicle)  
Arm 2  CGS-200-1 (1% Capsaicin in CGS -200 vehicle)  
Arm 3  CGS-200-5 (5% Capsaicin in CGS -200 vehicle)  
 
Each Arm will enroll [ADDRESS_639366] of the knee(s)  once daily on four 
consecutive days. The applications will be at the clinic but by [CONTACT_497234]. Wearing gloves 
supplied by [CONTACT_46683], the subject will apply the study drug on 
and around the knee covering a 10cm by 10cm area. The application 
will be left in place for 60  (up to 65) minutes and then washed off at 
the clinic by [CONTACT_6477].  The amount of Investigational Drug 
Product to be applied is estimated to be approximately 0.13 mL based 
on experience in prior studies. Even though both knee(s) will receive 
application of study test materials, with regard to reduction in 
WOMAC pain and VAS pain score associated with study treatments, 
only one knee will be indicated as the “Study Knee”. This will be the 
knee with the highest WOMAC pain score at baseline. If both knees 
have equal WOMAC pain scores at baseline, then the right knee will 
be considered the “Study Knee” with regard to WOMAC pain and 
VAS pain score reduction.   
 
The Investigators, all site staff, study subjects and Clinical Research 
Organization (CRO) personnel (except for the Medical Monitor 
providing safety oversight) directly involved in the study will remain 
blinded to the treatment assignment throughout the trial.  
 
Estimated No. of 
Subjects:  Total 120 evaluable subjects : 40 subjects will be allocated to each 
study Arm. An allowance of up to 10 subjects per Arm is to be 
provided for dropouts whose withdrawal is not due to lack of study 
drug tolerability).

In 1986, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) published classificat ion 
criteria for OA of the knee.[2] Classification criteria are not diagnostic criteria, although 
they are often used as such by [CONTACT_15098].  The criteria are useful in clinical re search, 
including clinical trials, to provide a uniform population for study.  The classification 
criteria are shown in the table below.

The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) has developed guidelines for the 
diagnosis of OA.[3] During the development of the guidelines, they found that 3 
symptoms (persistent knee pain, morning stiffness, and decreased function) and 3 signs 
(crepi[INVESTIGATOR_72831], restricted movement, and bony enlargement) were most important in the 
diagnosis.  The more symptoms and signs, the more certain is the diagnosis.  While 
diagnostic guidelines are useful in patient care, it will be necessary to use classification 
criteria in this clinical trial.

FINAL / Version 5.[ADDRESS_639390] -2018 Page 19 The pathogenesis of OA remains unclear; however, certain types of OA show familial 
aggregation, and excessive load on joints may play a role.  In addition, over the years, 
there has been some consideration as to whether OA involves inflammation and 
whether it is a primary driver of the development of OA or whethe r trauma or other 
factors produce damage that results in secondary inflammation.  
Whatever the pathogenetic mechanisms may be, OA is a progressive disorder that 
results in disability.  There is a great unmet medical need for more effective treatments 
for OA. Better treatment of the pain of OA has the potential for postponing disability 
and improving health -related quality of life  
Current standard of care for OA may include non -pharmacologic interventions such as 
exercise, weight loss, appropriate insoles, wal king aids, patellar tapi[INVESTIGATOR_10714] a medial 
direction, thermal treatments, tai chi, psychosocial interventions and self -management 
programs .[4] Pharmacologic agents that can be used include acetaminophen, non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAID) given orally or t opi[INVESTIGATOR_897], tramadol, 
duloxetine, and intra -articular hyaluronate, corticosteroids, or injections.  In addition, 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_497188].  
In patients who have failed medical therapy or are not willi ng to undergo surgery, or 
for whom joint replacement surgery is contraindicated, opi[INVESTIGATOR_497189].  
Acetaminophen carries a risk of liver damage.  The use of oral NSAIDs is associated 
with a potential for gastric and intestinal ulcerat ion and high doses of NSAIDs have 
been associated with an elevated risk of cardiac problems.  The intent of topi[INVESTIGATOR_497190] (thereby [CONTACT_497237]-intestinal damage) while providing for a therapeu tically effective level in and 
around the affected area.  However, these products – whether oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] – require 
regular daily use and administration more than once daily.  The use of any opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] -
containing product poses a risk for addiction or diversion .  
There is therefore considerable unmet medical need for a treatment of OA knee pain 
(OAKP) that does not require regular daily use, does not carry the gastro -intestinal risks 
of NSAIDs or the liver risks of acetaminophen or the addiction / diversion risk s of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], and can safely provide long lasting pain relief after a brief course of treatment.

FINAL / Version 5.[ADDRESS_639391] -2018 Page 21 VZU00023 (in the DR) was approximately twice what was seen in VZU00022 (in the 
U.S.). 
This marked difference between the response to  placebo (vehicle), using the same 
vehicle, in the U.S. study compared to the  non-U.S. study, conducted in the Dominican 
Republic, appears to  be consistent with the  known higher rates of placebo  response in 
studies conducted in Latin American countries[5], and which effect is within the well -
known influence of cultural differences in placebo respons es [6]. The differences 
between placebo responses in the same studies conducted in Latin America and Europe 
and the corresponding differences for active treatment response are tabulated below 
(Table 1–1). The data in Table [ADDRESS_639392] that on average, the placebo response in a 
study conducted in a Latin American culture country (such as the Dominican Republic) 
will be circa 2.6 times greater t han in the same study conducted in European countries. 
This, by [CONTACT_66250], suggests that the placebo response in a Latin American study may 
be similarly higher compared to the same study conducted in the U.S., the U.S. culture 
being typi[INVESTIGATOR_497191].  Per Figure 1–3 once daily 
application of vehicle reduced group mean OA pain score to 60% of baseline by [CONTACT_2006] 
28 in the U.S. OTC study whereas the  vehicle reduced group mean OA pain score to 
25% of baseline by [CONTACT_2006] 33 in the Dominican Republic study. Looking at these percent 
of baseline values in a different light, the absolute reduction  of OA pain score 
associated with vehicle treatment was 40% for the U.S. study and 75% for the 
Dominican Republic study. The “absolute reduction” is 100% less the percentage of 
baseline at the assessment time (i.e., the degree of pain relief associated with a 
treatment). So, the placebo (vehicle) effect in the Dominica n Republic study appears 
to be 1.9-times greater than the vehicle effect in the U.S. study. This is well within the 
range of differences reported by [CONTACT_391926]. (2016).[5]

It can be seen, also, from Table 1–1 that the difference in active treatment response in 
Latin America conducted studies and European conducted studies is slight.  One can 
speculate that the large differences noted for placebo re sponses and the small 
differences noted for active treatment responses may be due to a cultural difference in 
the expectations of Latin American subjects compared European subjects. The Latin 
American may tend to believe more strongly that what the doctor or clinic is doing will 
help them, ergo the high placebo responses in Latin America; whereas, the European 
subjects may have lower expectations of obtaining relief, and a lower placebo response 
as a result. For active treatment, if the study treatment is a ctually beneficial, then the 
responses of European subjects and Latin American subjects would be similar, as is 
reported by [CONTACT_391926]. (2016).[5] The role of cultural differences in expectations regarding 
treatment outcomes is well recognized and has been addressed by [CONTACT_497238] (2015).[6] 
In contrast to the magnitude of cultural effects on placebo response, the data presented 
by [CONTACT_391926]. ( 2016) suggest t hat cultural differences in response to active treatment 
appear to be slight . [5] This suggests, in turn, that the pain relief efficacy data for active 
treatment (C GS-200-5) in study VZU00023 will hold up in the U.S. study planned 
under this protocol. Conversely, the large cultural differences in placebo responses, 
along with experience with vehicle response in a U.S. OTC product study, suggest that 
the vehicle response in the clinical study planned under this Investigational New Drug 
(IND) application will be much lower than was observed in study VZU00023 and likely 
similar to what was seen in the U. S. OTC product study.

This was a vehicle -controlled study of safety, tolerability and efficacy of CGS -200 
5% capsacian  in subjects with OA of the knee. Single daily application for four 
consecutive days with 93 days (13 weeks) follow up.  
CGS-200-5 was well tolerated and reduced OAKP at 13 weeks by 93% compared 
to baseline. No SAEs, no AEs resulting in subject discontinuation or subject 
requested withdrawal, only AEs that were possibly, probably or definitely 
treatment related were: (a) loc al at the application site and RCTC toxicity grades 
were generally 1 (mild) and at highest 2 (moderate) and were mostly BSP (in 100% 
of subjects) with less frequent erythema (72% of subjects), and pruritus (56% or 
subjects) ; and (b) coughing / sneezing du ring or following application (RCTC 
Grade 1, mild) which was observed in 20% of subjects. No suggestion of systemic 
toxicities related to treatment was observed.  
In this study, Vehicle control had an unexpectedly high placebo effect, with 
reduction of OAKP s cores by [CONTACT_129743] 83% at 13 weeks. Unusually high placebo 
effects are known from  the literature to occur in studies in Latin American 
countries such as the Dominican Republic.[5] No SAEs, no AEs resulting on subject 
discontinuation or subject requested withdrawal, only AEs that were possibly, 
probably or definitely treatment related were: (a) local at the application site and 
RCTC toxicity grades were generally 1 (mild) and at highest 2 (moderate) and were 
mostly BSP (in 35% of subjects) with less frequent erythema (15% of subjects), 
and pruritus (31% or subjects) ; and (b) coughing / sneezing during or following 
application (RCTC  Grade 1, mild) which was observed in 3.8% of subjects. In this 
study, serum chemistries, hematology and urinalysis data were collected at 
screening but not at a later time point. However, as a reference point, no remarkable 
differences for serum chemistry  and hematology were observed between screening 
values and vales at one month after study start in Study VZU00021. It was, 
therefore, concluded that in Study VZU00023 no remarkable differences in serum 
chemistry and hematology values between screening and one to three months after 
study start would be observed. No suggestion of systemic toxicities related to 
treatment was observed in Study VZU00023.

FINAL / Version 5.[ADDRESS_639408] -2018 Page 31 It can be noted that for the NRS pa in scores ( Figure 1–1) the difference between 
placebo (vehicle) response and active treatment response is less than the difference 
between placebo (vehicle) response and active treatment response as assessed by [CONTACT_497239] (WOMAC) pain 
subscale. Additionally, the placebo (vehicle) response is higher than expected based on 
data from a U.S. clinical study of Sponsor’s OTC Tentative Final Monograph ( TFM) 
capsaicin product (0.025% capsaicin topi[INVESTIGATOR_497201]).  The placebo response in that study 
was in the range of only a  60% reduction in OA knee pain scores relative to baseline 
(using a 100 mm VAS scale for pain assessment).  This is illustrated in  Figure 1–3, next 
page, which superimposes the U.S. vehicle response data onto the VZU00023 response 
data through Day 33.  In the U.S. OTC study the final assessment time was at Day 28 
and the vehicle was applied daily for 7 consecutive days either once daily or twice daily 
(with an application interval time of approximately 12 hrs). The vehicle re sponse data 
shown in Figure 1–3 are for the once daily application of vehicle so as to be comparable 
to the once daily application of vehicle in study VZU00023.  In the U.S. study, twice 
daily application of vehicle pr oduced an approximately 55% reduction of group mean 
pain score relative to baseline.

FINAL / Version 5.[ADDRESS_639409] -2018 Page 32 This marked difference between the response to  placebo (vehicle), using the same 
vehicle, in the U.S. study compared to the  non-U.S. study, conducted in the Dominican 
Republic, appears to  be consistent with the  known higher rates of placebo  response in 
studies conducted in Latin American c ountries [5], and which effect is within the well -
known influence of cultural differences in placebo responses .[6] The differenc es 
between placebo responses in the same studies conducted in Latin America and  Europe 
and the corresponding differences for active treatment response reported in Xu et al. 
(2016) suggest that on average, the placebo response in a study conducted in a Lati n 
American culture country (such as the Dominican Republic) will be circa 2.6 times 
greater than in the same study conducted in European countries.  [5] This, by [CONTACT_66250], 
suggests that the placebo response in a Latin American study may be similarly higher 
compared to the same study conducted in the U.S., the U.S. culture being typi[INVESTIGATOR_497202].  Per Figure 1–3 once daily application of vehicle 
reduced group mean OA pain score to 60% of baseline by [CONTACT_2006] 28 in the U.S. OTC 
study whereas the vehicle reduced group mean OA pain score to 25% of baseline by 
[CONTACT_2006] 33 in the Dominican Republic study. Looking at t hese percent of baseline values 
in a different light, the absolute reduction  of OA pain score associated with vehicle 
treatment was 40% for the U.S. study and 75% for the Dominican Republic study. The 
“absolute reduction” is 100% less the percentage of b aseline at the assessment time 
(i.e., the degree of pain relief associated with a treatment). So, the placebo (vehicle) 
effect in the Dominican Republic study appears to be 1.[ADDRESS_639410] in the U.S. study. This is  well within the range of differences reported by [CONTACT_497240]. (2016).[5]

Babbar et al. (2009) reported that the lower limit of quantification ( LLOQ) for their 
serum capsaicin assay was 0.5 ng/mL, which can be considered a sensitive high-
performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) method.[7] They also report that the 
percentage of subje cts that had serum levels below the LLOQ was, in four different 
studies, respectively: 89%, 99%, 99.5% , and 94%. The median serum C max for all 
subjects in all studies was reported to be circa 2 ng/mL with a time to maximum effect 
(Tmax) of circa 1.5 hrs and with serum levels droppi[INVESTIGATOR_497207] 4 – 5 hrs after patch removal.  
Given that the unit surface area application rate for capsaicin in Protocol VZU00025 
will be only about 12% of that used in the studies repor ted by [CONTACT_497243]., (2009) it 
suggests that there would be no subjects in Protocol VZU00025 who would have 
capsaicin serum levels above an LLOQ of 0.5 ng/mL.[7]  
In Non-Clinical studie s (summarized above), no suggestions of potential systemic or 
site of application toxicities have bee n reported.  
1.4.1 Possible Risks  
All safety data obtained in this trial will be carefully evaluated and used to inform the 
design of any future clinical trials.  The potential risks of study participation include 
those associated with exposure to capsaicin and possible allergic reactions to capsaicin 
or one of the other components of the investigational products.  Effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_497208], edema, papules, scaling, pruritus, stinging and 
burning pain.  These manifestations may also occur in unintended locations through 
transfer of the investigational products from the treatment area to other sites on the 
skin, mucous membranes, and ocu lar surfaces. Inhalation of fumes or aerosolization of 
the investigational products may cause irritation of airways with symptoms such as 
coughing.  A temporary rise in blood pressure (hypertension) or difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_497209] a nd burning is severe.  All subjects will receive a full 
explanation of potential risks and will sign an informed consent form prior to study 
participation.

The objectives of the present study are the following:  
• To develop pain relief dose -response data for OAKP, compared to Vehicle, for 
the following concentrations of Capsaicin in CGS -200 vehicle: 1% and 5% using 
the WOMAC pa in subscale (VAS formatted) as the primary pain index for relief 
of OAKP.   
• To confirm, in a U.S. based po pulation, the high safety profile for CGS -200-5 
that was reported in Studies VZU00021 and VZU00023 in a Dominican Republic 
population.  
• To develop data for relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis using the 
WOMAC subscales for pain, stiffness and function and total WOMAC score.  
• To develop OAKP relief data using the 100 mm VAS scale.

This is a multi -center, randomized, double -blind clinical trial to examine the 
comparative effects on OAKP of CGS-200-1 (1% C apsaicin content) (N= 40), 
CGS-200-5 (5% Capsaicin content) (N= 40), and CGS-200 Vehicle  (no Capsaicin ) 
(N=40) in subjects with OA of the knees according to the 1986 ACR criteria. Assigned 
doses will be applied at the clinic for 60 minutes on each of four co nsecutive days.  
Subjects will be randomized to one of the three Arms in this study: CGS-200-1 or 
CGS-200-5 or CGS-200-0 (Vehicle). All subjects will receive [ADDRESS_639422] of the knee(s)  once daily on four consecutive days. The applications

is estimated to be approximately 0.13 mL based on experience in prior studies. E ven 
though both knee(s) will receive application of study test materials, with regard to 
reduction in  WOMAC pain and  VAS pain score associated with study treatments, only 
one knee will be indicated as the “Study Knee”. This will be the knee with the highe st  
WOMAC pain score at baseline. If both knees have equal WOMAC pain scores at 
baseline, then the right knee will be considered the “Study Knee” with regard to 
WOMAC pain and VAS pain score reduction.  
Data will be collected from Day 1 through Day 5 and t hen again on Days 19, 35, 64, 
and 94 for  efficacy, tolerability, and safety measures.  The Investigators, all site staff 
and Clinical Research Organization (CRO) personnel (except the Medical Monitor 
providing safety oversight) directly involved in the stud y will remain blinded to the 
treatment assignment throughout the trial.

5.1.3 Rationale for Dose Selection  
In a previous clinical investigation with CGS -200 5% and 10% capsaicin 
(Study VZU00021), both strengths gave essentially the same degree of pain relief and 
over essentially the same time course to maximum effect and lasting at least 29 days 
after cessation of t reatment. Both strengths were well tolerated. Based on this, the 
choice of CGS -200-05 as the high dose Arm in this study is seen as rational . For the 
low dose Arm, CGS -200-1 was selected on the basis of being a reduction of 5 -fold 
from the 5% dose, which d egree of reduction is likely to give a lower response than the 
5% dose based on modeling of analgesic responses from 7 days of QD and BID doses

This should result in moistening the skin providing a thin film of medication 
(approximately 0.13 mL [or 0.13 gram] of drug product applied to 100 cm2 of knee 
surface, which represents 1.3 mg of solution per cm2). Areas that were already 
moistened should not be recoat ed. The study medication should not be applied to a knee 
if the subject is still experiencing stinging, burning, pruritus, erythema, or scaling from 
a prior application to that knee.  In the case of a dose that is skipped, the subject should 
return as sched uled for their next visit at which time they may receive the next 
scheduled application of study medication if their symptoms have subsided.  The

FINAL / Version 5.[ADDRESS_639442]’s knees will remain uncovered for 60  minutes (up to 65 minutes)  after 
dosing to allow for assessments and proper absorption of the study medication.  The 
subject must avoid touching the knee area during this time.  The knees will then be 
cleansed by [CONTACT_497251].  After the area is cleansed, 
the subject may cover their knees, but should avoid doing so if possible.  It is 
recommended that the subject wear shorts or a skirt durin g the treatment period rather 
than long pants.  During the four days of treatment, subjects should also avoid exposing 
the knees to any form of heat (hot water, vigorous exercise, direct sunlight, etc.).  If a 
subject experiences intolerable pain or severe i rritation from the study medication, they 
may apply cold water, ice, or a cold pack or cold compress to their knee.  If the subject 
continues to have unbearable pain, they should contact [CONTACT_497252].  In the event of an aller gic reaction or medical emergency, the Medical 
Monitor must be contact[CONTACT_15608].

any subject.  Every effort should be made to maintain the study blind.   
Subjects will be monitored closely during and after application of treatment for any 
signs of acut e adverse reactions.  If an allergic reaction occurs, suggested guidelines are 
as follows:  
• Grade 3 or higher adverse reaction:  
− If treatment is ongoing, it must be immediately and permanently 
discontinued , the study drug should be washed off, and the subject  should 
be treated symptomatically as clinically indicated.  
− The subject will be followed for safety as clinically indicated until the

8.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.1.1 Definitions  
The AE mon itoring period begins with the start of study drug administration on Day 1 
and continues through Day 94. 
ADVERSE EVENT EXPERIENCE (AE) – any unfavorable or unintended sign, 
symptom, or disease that is temporally associated with the use of an investigationa l 
drug but is not necessarily caused by [CONTACT_280607].  This includes worsening 
(e.g.; increase in frequency or severity) of pre -existing conditions.  
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) – an AE resulting in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death 
• Life-threatening (immediate  risk of death)  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Medically important*  
*Important medical events that may not result in dea th, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in a subject’s 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug ab use. 
UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENT – any adverse event, the specificity or severity of 
which is not consistent with the current Investigator Brochure (IB).  Expected means 
that the event has previously been observed with the study drug and is identified and/or

Grade 3: Severe   Causing inability to carr y out usual activities  
Grade 4: Life Threatening*  Potentially life threatening or disabling  
* Note – a severity assessment of Life Threatening is not necessarily the same as Life 
Threatening as a “Serious” criteria.  The latter means that the event is an im mediate 
threat to life as opposed to a potential threat to life.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Seriousness  
Event seriousness will be determined according to the protoc ol definition of SAE in 
Section 8.1.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Severity  
Event severity will be assigned according to the RCTC, v2.0.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is required to provide an assessment of causality or relationship  of 
AEs to the study drug based on 1) temporal relationship of the event to the 
administration of study drug; 2) whether an alternative etiology has been identified; 
and 3) biological plausibility.  The causality assessment categories that will be used for 
this study are described below.  
Note: If a causality assessment is not provided, a possible relationship will be assumed 
for regulatory reporting purposes.

Protocol VZU00025   
 
FINAL / Version 5.[ADDRESS_639470] -2018 Page 61 Causality assessments that are considered Not Related  to study drug:  
None: The event is related to an etiology other than the study drug (the alternative 
etiology must be documented in the subject’s medical record).  
Unlikely: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration which mak es a causal relationship 
improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations.  The event is unlikely to be related to the 
study drug and likely to be related to factors other than study drug.  
Causality assess ments that are considered Related to study drug:  
Possible: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administrations of the drug, but which could also be 
explained by [CONTACT_497256]. Information 
on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Probable:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other dr ugs or chemicals, and which follows a 
clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge).  Rechallenge 
information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
Definite: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to drug administration, and which cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153].  The response 
to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible.  The 
event must be definitive pharmacologically  or phenomenologically, using a 
satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.  
Note – ICH guidelines (3/95) clarify “reasonable causal relationship” to mean, 
“that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.”

9.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
A sample size analysis has  been performed  and suggests that a sample size of 
40 evaluable subjects per each of the three study arms will appropriately power this 
study.  
9.2 RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  
Treatment assignment for all subjects enrolled in this study will be double -blind; the 
subjects and all site personnel and CRO personnel (with the exception of the Medical 
Monitor providing safety oversight) involved in this study will not know the treatment 
given to any subject.  Every effort should be made to maintain the study blind.   
9.3 ANALYSIS  SETS 
The following three analysis sets will be defined for this study:  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) set will be defined as all randomized subjects, whether or not 
they receive study drug.   
The modified ITT (mITT) set will be defined as the subset of the ITT  subjects that 
receive at least one dose of study medication and have at least one evaluable 
post-dosing efficacy endpoint.  The mITT set will be defined based on randomized 
treatment rather than treatment actually received.  All efficacy analyses will be carried 
out using the mITT set.  
The safety (SAF) set will be based on the ITT subjects, but will be based on the 
treatment actually received rather than randomized treatment.  All safety analyses will 
be carried out using the SAF set.

all clinical supplies must be maintained.  Subjects may be withdrawn from the study by 
[CONTACT_66875] -compliance with the protocol.   
9.5.3 Efficacy Analyses  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The group mean LMS difference between each Active Treatment Arm and the Vehicle 
Arm for the WOMAC pain score at Day 35 will be tested for significance of difference 
at a significance value of p < 0.05.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The group mean LMS difference between each Active Treatment Arm and the Vehicle 
Arm for the WOMAC stiffness, function and total  score at Day 35 will be tested for 
significance of difference at a significance value of p < 0.05 
Also, the group mean reduction in OA knee pain sc ore on a 100 mm VAS scale for 
each active treatment arm will be compared to the vehicle arm and tested for 
significance of difference at a significance value of p < 0.05

Efficacy analyses will be carried out on the mITT set.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Response  
Clinical response will be measured by [CONTACT_497258] . In order for a 
subject to be considered to have successfully obtained a clinical response, the following 
criteria must be met:  
WOMAC pain  score reduced to 50% or less of baseline at any of the stat ed 
assessment times.  
The durability of clinical response up to Day [ADDRESS_639480] successfully met the above criteria (reduction of a least 50% in NRS pain 
score) at the Day [ADDRESS_639481] failed to achieve a durable clinical 
response.

Post hoc tests may be performed to test for differences in the eff icacy endpoints 
between the CGS -200-0 (Vehicle), CGS -200-1 and CGS-200-5 treatment groups for 
exploratory purposes.  
9.5.4 Tolerability Analyses  
The primary tolerability endpoint will be tolerability of the formulations on each of 
Days 1, 2, 3, and 4.  On each of these days, subjects will report an N RS score for

9.5.5 Safety Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
The incidence of all reported AEs and treatment -emergent AEs (TEAE) will be 
tabulated.  A TEAE is defined as an event that first occurs or worsens in intensity after 
the administration of study drug.  AEs will be classified by [CONTACT_497259] (MedDRA).  The 
severity of the AE will be graded using the RCTC v2.0 whenever possible.  For AEs 
that are not included in the RCTC v2.0, the grading categories (mild, m oderate, severe, 
and life-threatening) will be used and equated to the respective RCTC grade (Grades 
1, 2, 3, and 4).  For incidence reporting, if a subject reports more than one AE that is 
coded to the same system organ class or preferred term, the subject  will be counted 
only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term.  
An overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of TEAEs, treatment -related 
AEs, severity of AEs, SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, will be 
presented.  For AEs presented by [CONTACT_926], the worst severity during the study will be 
presented for each subject.  The subject incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by

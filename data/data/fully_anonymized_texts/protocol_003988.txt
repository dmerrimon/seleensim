Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March  2022  7 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 1  SUMMARY OF CHANGES TABLE 
Amendment 1 (17 March  2022) 
This amendment is considered substantial / based on the criteria defined in Article 
10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union because it significantly impacts the safety of participants or the 
scientific  value of the study . 
Overall rationale for the current Amendment:   
This protocol has been amended to reflect the following:  
• Following  review of data collected so far from the RSV MAT -[ADDRESS_1161354] been observed in infants born to vaccinated 
mothers who received RSV maternal vaccine versus those who received a placebo. 
The safety signals are being investigated and, although at this ti me a cause has not 
been determined, based on the above observations, [COMPANY_004] has nevertheless decided to 
stop enrolment and vaccination for all actively enrolling RSV MAT studies.  
• There will be no new participants included in this study . However, safety monitoring 
of all 8 study participants  (of the planned 252 study participants)  enrolled and 
vaccinated  in RSV MAT -[ADDRESS_1161355] of the study period.  
• The vaccination planned at visit [ADDRESS_1161356] 2  at Day 38  and 
Visit 3 at Day 61 are not applicable anymore. Visit 4a (Day 181) and Visit 4b (Day 
211) are replaced by a telephone contact [CONTACT_98205] 181 .  
• A blood sample for immunogenicity assessment in the study participants who 
received first dose of RSV Maternal vaccine will continue to be collected  at Visit 2 
only. No other blood samples will be collected.  
• All planned objectives will be analysed and reported in a descriptive manner for the 
8 enrolled participants .

2. INTRODUCTION  (AMENDED 17 MARCH  2022) 
2.1. Study rationale  
GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA ( [COMPANY_004]) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_836563] (RSV) maternal vaccine (RSVPreF3) against RSV disease in infants 
through maternal immunization with the aim of preventing RSV -associated lower 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_836564]. The vaccine 
candidate is an engineered version of the RSV fusion (F) surface glycoprotein, stabilized 
in the pre -fusion conformation. This study will be a Phase 3 randomized, open  label, 
active vaccine -controlled crossover study to the evaluate safety, reactogenicity , and 
immunogenicity  of RSV maternal vaccine in healthy non -pregnant adolescent girls from 
9 to 17 years of age (YOA), and in non-pregnant adult women from [ADDRESS_1161381] 6 months of life thus increasing 
the number of infants who can benefit from this vaccine. RSV prevention is even more 
crucial in this population as babies of adolescent mothers face  higher risks of low birth 
weight, preterm delivery , and severe neonatal conditions [WHO, 2016]. Hence these 
babies also have a higher risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_836565] [CHMP, 2018] which 
justifies the need to vaccinate the pregnant adolescent population  with maternal RSV  
vaccine. 
Because it is not feasible to conduct a study including all age groups of pregnant 
adolescents due to the low occurrence of young adolescent pregnancies this study is 
conducted in non -pregnant girls including a direct comparison to non -pregnant adult 
women in terms of immunological non -inferiority. RS V MAT-039 is part of an approved 
Pediatric Investigation Plan in Europe.  
In the RSV maternal program to date, a Phase 1/2 study (RSV MAT -001; NCT 
03674177) in healthy non -pregnant women 18 -45 years of age to determine the safety 
and immunogenicity of 3 dos e levels of RSV (RSVPreF3) maternal vaccine (30, 60 and 
120 µg) compared to placebo has been completed. No safety concerns have been 
identified.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
217354  (RSV MAT -039) 
Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  21 Based on preliminary results of RSV MAT -001, the 60 and 120 µg dose -levels were 
selected for further evaluatio n in the following 2 additional studies, which are ongoing:  
• RSV-MAT 004 (NCT 04126213): A Phase II observer -blind study to assess safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ investigational RSV 
maternal unadjuvanted vaccine ([COMPANY_004]3888550A ), in healthy pregnant women and 
infants born to vaccinated mothers  
• RSV-MAT 011 (NCT 04138056): A Phase II study of [ADDRESS_1161382] immunogenicity and there were no safety 
concerns. It was, therefore, selected for evaluation in the Phase 3 studies: the ongoing 
trial RSV MAT -009 (NCT 04605159)  which is a  Phase III doub le-blind study to assess 
safety and efficacy  of an RSV maternal unadjuvanted vaccine, in pregnant women and 
infants born to vaccinated mothers . Also ongoing is the RSV MAT -012 trial, that is 
designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity in the high-risk 
obstetric population.  
The objective of this  study is to evaluate the immunogenicity as well as safety and 
reactogenicity of RSV maternal vaccine in healthy non -pregnant girls 9 -17 YOA 
(pediatric study group*) and in non-pregnant adult women 18 -49 YOA (adult study ). 
* For purpose of this study we will classify all females between 9 -17 YOA as “girls” with 
the understanding that this age range includes children (9 -11 year of age) and 
adolescents: (12 to 18 [further dependent on the region]). [ICH E11, 2017] 
In this study, Boostrix will be used as an active vaccine. Two formulations of dTpa 
vaccine, each containing either 300 µg or 500 µg of Aluminum are licensed in the US 
and outside of the US (ex -US), respectively. Boostrix-US formulation (dTpa_300) will be 
administered to participant s in centers located in the US, while the Boostrix-ex-US 
formulation  (dTpa_500) will be administered to participant s in centers ex -US [Christy, 
1995]. Even though two different formulations for Boostrix are available , both have  a 
similar immunogenicity and safety profiles. [Theeten, 2005] 
Objectives and endpoints/estimands of the RSV MAT -039 study are presented in  Section 
3. 
• Following  review of data collected so far from the RSV MAT -[ADDRESS_1161383] been observed in infants 
born to vaccinated mothers who received RSV maternal vaccine versus those who 
received a placebo. The safety signals are being investigated and, although at this 
time a cause has not been determined, based on the above observations, [COMPANY_004] has 
nevertheless decided to stop enrolment and vaccination for all actively enrolling 
RSV MAT studies.  
• There will be no new participants included in this study . However, safety

• The vaccination planned at visit [ADDRESS_1161385] 2 at Day 38 and 
Visit 3 at Day 61 are not applicable anymore. Visit 4a (Day 181) and Visit 4b (Day 
211) are replaced by a telephone contact [CONTACT_98205] 181.  
•  A blood sample for immunogenicity assessment in the study participants who 
received first dose of RSV Maternal vaccine will  continue to  be collected at Visit 2 
only. No other blood samples will be collected.  
• All planned objectives will be analysed and reported in a descriptive manner for  
the 8 enrolled participants.  
2.2. Background  
Please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for background information on 
RSV infection, the rationale for the maternal immunization approach described in this 
protocol, and information regarding pre -clinical and clinical studies of the RSV maternal 
vaccine and epi[INVESTIGATOR_836566] . 
2.3. Benefit/Risk a ssessment  (Amended 17 March  2022) 
[COMPANY_004] has included provisions in this trial to ensure participant’s safety.  Safety monitoring 
has been and will be conducted throughout this study by [CONTACT_836579] (IDMC) and by  [CONTACT_1034].  Measures to suspend the study 
should a potential safety issue be identified are described in Section  8.2.3. 
Following a recommendation from the IDMC, the Sponsor made the decision to pause 
the enrollment, randomization and vaccination of pregnant study participants in our 
active studies based on an  observation of imbalance of the proportion of preterm births 
between the vaccine group and the placebo group in the RSV MAT -009 study in 
pregnant women. This pause was to allow for an evaluation of the available data in 
RSV MAT -009 to better understand th e safety signal observed. Following a review of 
additional unblinded data from RSV MAT -009 trial in which a higher proportion of 
neonatal deaths reported in the treatment group compared to the placebo group was 
also observed, the Sponsor decided to STOP en rollment and vaccination in these 
studies.  
The safety signals are being investigated and, although at this time a cause has not 
been determined, as a precautionary measure [COMPANY_004] stopped active enrollment and 
further vaccination of participants in the RSV MA T studies enrolling both pregnant 
women on February 25, 2022 and non -pregnant women on March 1, 2022. The study 
remains ongoing for safety follow -up. Participants already vaccinated will continue to 
be monitored until the end of the study.

4.2. Scientific rationale for study design  
This study is part of a clinical development plan of the RSV maternal vaccine for the 
protection of infants from RSV lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_836567]. This study will evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity  of 
the RSV maternal vaccine in non-pregnant girls from 9  to 17 YOA in order to s how that 
the humoral immunogenicity is non inferior to the immunogenicity , safety and 
reactogenicity  observed in non-pregnant adult women aged 18 to 49 YOA. 
Following the decision to stop all RSV maternal studies, this study will only explore 
immunogenicity and safety of RSV MAT vaccine in study participants  (who received 
fist dose at Visit 1)  9 to 17 years of age and 18 to 49 years of age  and non-inferiority 
between the groups will not be assessed.  
4.3. Justification for dose  
A single formulation of the investigational RSV maternal vaccine (containing 120 µg of 
the RSVPreF3 antigen) is proposed. Currently available data suggest that the 120 µg 
formulation has an acceptable safety profile and tends to elicit stronger immune 
responses in non -pregnant (RSV MAT -001 and RSV MAT -011) and pregnant (RSV 
MAT-004) women, which is likely to result in higher placental transfer of antibodies to 
the fetus than formulations containing [ADDRESS_1161397] the 
neutralizing antibodies induced by [CONTACT_836582].

6.2. Preparation, handling, storage, and accountabilit y 
The study intervention(s) must be stored in a secured place  within the temperature range 
specified on the study intervention’s label. The storage temperature should be 
continuously monitored and recorded with a calibrated (if not validated) temperature 
monitoring device(s).  
Only authorized study personnel should be allowed access to the study intervention(s) .

6.3. Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding 
(Amended 17 March  2022) 
6.3.1. Participant  identification  
Each participating country and site will have a range of participant identification number 
and enrolled subjects will be assigned to those numbers sequentially.  
6.3.2. Randomisation to study intervention  
A total of 252 participan ts will be enrolled evenly in 2 age groups, (9 -17 YOA and 18 -49 
YOA). Within each age group, approximately 126 participa nts will be 1:1 randomized 
either receiving RSV maternal vaccine followed by [CONTACT_836588] 30 days later or 
receiving dTpa vaccine follow ed by [CONTACT_836578] 30 days later.  Study is 
stopped after enrolling 8 subjects (7 adult and one adolescent) hence no more 
randomization and intervention will be applicable . 
6.3.3. Intervention allocation to the participant  
The randomization algorithm will use a stratification procedure accounting for 
participants age at the time of study intervention administration (9 -17 YOA, 18 -49 YOA) 
and a minimization procedure accounting for (a) Center and (b) Study. Minimization 
factors will have equal weight in the minimization algorithm . 
Once a participant identification number is allocated, the randomisation system will 
determine study group and  will provide the study intervention  number to be used for the 
first dose. The study inter vention number(s) to be used for subsequent dosing will be 
provided by [CONTACT_836589] -based system  (SBIR) 
When an automated, Internet -based system (SBIR) is not available, please refer  to the 
SBIR user guide or SPM for specific instructions.

7. DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY INTERVENTION AN D 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1. Discontinuation of study intervention  
‘Discontinuation’ of study intervention refers to any participant who has not received all 
planned doses of study intervention. A participant who discontinued study intervention 
may continue other study procedures (e.g. safety or immunogenicity), planned in the 
study protocol at the discretion of the investigator.  
The primary reason for premature discontinuation of the study intervention  will be 
documented on the  eCRF as follows:  
• Adverse event requiring expedited reporting to [COMPANY_004]  
• Unsolicited non -serious adverse event  
• Solicited adverse event  
• Not willing to be vaccinated  
• Other (specify).

A participant is considered to have withdrawn from the study if no new study procedure 
has been performed or no new information has been collected for him/her since the date 
of withdrawal/last contact.  
From an analysis perspective, a study ‘w ithdrawal’ refers to any participant who did not 
return for the concluding visit planned in the protocol.  
Investigators will attempt to contact [CONTACT_103706]-up. 
All data and samples collected up to and incl uding the date of withdrawal of/last contact 
[CONTACT_103707].  
The primary reason for study withdrawal will be documented in the  eCRF, based on the 
list below:  
• Adverse events requiring expedited  reporting to [COMPANY_004]  
• Unsolicited non -serious adverse events  
• Solicited adverse event  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_3445], not due to an adverse event*  
• Migrated/Moved from the study area  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Sponsor study termination  
• Other (specify)  
*If a participant is withdrawn from the study because  she/the participant’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s)  has withdrawn consent and the reason for withdrawal was provided, the 
investigator must document this reason in the  eCRF. 
Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of AEs/SAEs must be clearly  
distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigator will 
follow participants who are withdrawn from the study due to an AE/SAE until the event 
is resolved (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
7.3. Lost to follow -up 
A participant will be considered ‘lost to follow -up’ if she fails to return for scheduled 
visits and cannot be contact[CONTACT_9298].  
Please refer to the SPM for a descript ion of actions to be taken before considering the 
participant lost to follow -up.

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  37 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
Protocol waivers or exemptions are only permitted when necessary for the management 
of immediate safety concerns for the participant.  
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor as soon as they occur or 
when the study team becomes aware of them. The purpose of this communication is to 
determine if the participant(s) should discontinue the study intervention.  
Study proc edures and their timing are summarised in the SoA (Section 1.3).  
All screening evaluations must be completed and the results reviewed before confirming 
that potenti al participants meet all eligibility criteria.  
The investigator will maintain a log of all participants screened. All relevant information, 
such as confirmation of eligibility and reasons for screening failure will be mentioned in 
this screening log.  
Procedures conducted as part of routine clinical management (e.g. hematologic profiles), 
and obtained before the participant/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) signed the Informed 
Consent Form (ICF), may be used for screening and/or for establishing a clinical bas eline 
(provided the procedure met protocol  specified criteria and was performed within the 
time frame defined in the SoA (Section 1.3). 
The SPM provides the investiga tor and site personnel with detailed administrative and 
technical information that does not impact participant safety.  
Study Procedures During Special Circumstances  
• During special circumstances (e.g., the COVID -19 pandemic), the specific guidance 
from loca l public health and other competent authorities regarding the protection of 
individuals’ welfare must be applied. Please refer to the SPM for details.  
For the duration of such special circumstances, the following measures may be 
implemented for enrolled participants:  
• Enrollment of additional participants may be placed on hold. Decisions on re -starting 
enrollment to  achieve the planned sample size will be made in a manner consistent 
with guidance from public health and other competent authorities.  
• The following measures may be implemented for enrolled participants:  
− If it is not possible to conduct a protocol -specified, scheduled or event -driven 
visit as described in Section  1.[ADDRESS_1161409] 
conducted by [CONTACT_606484], email, telephone, videotelephony or telemedicine. In such 
cases:

medical records and can be obtained by [CONTACT_6624] (as allowed by [CONTACT_49762]), may  be recorded in the participant’s source document and entered 
into the eCRF.  
− Whenever possible, as appropriate per the judgment of the investigator and as 
allowed by [CONTACT_1769], arrangements should be made for qualified personnel to 
collect any protocol -specified safety data, safety assessment(s), and/or  biological 
samples at an alternate location* within the visit interval (Table 2). 
− Samples should not be collected if they cannot be processed in a timely 
manner and / or appropriately stored until the intended use.  
− Blood samples for central assessment must be collected using [COMPANY_004] -
provided supplies.  
− “Medically attended visits” will include instances where, due to the speci al 
circumstances, the participant cannot seek medical advice for symptoms/an 
illness by [CONTACT_156995] a medical facility or arranging for a home visit, and seeks this 
advice instead via telephone, SMS, email, videotelephony or telemedicine, or 
other means.  
Additional details of how these visits can be conducted are outlined in the SPM.  
Impact on the analysis sets for immunogenicity will be determined on a case by [CONTACT_17878]. 
*It is the investigator’s responsibility to identify an alternate location. The investig ator 
should ensure that this alternate location meets ICH GCP requirements, such as adequate 
facilities to perform study procedures, appropriate training of the staff and documented 
delegation of responsibilities in this location. This alternate location s hould be covered by 
[CONTACT_227251] a site 
other than the designated study site.  
8.1. Immunogenicity assessments  
Biological samples will be used for research planned in the protocol and for purposes 
related to the improvement, development and quality assurance of the laboratory tests 
described in this protocol.  
Findings in this or future studies may make it desirable to use samples acquired in this 
study for research not planned in this protocol. In this case, all participants in countries 
where this is allowed will be asked to give consent to allow [COMPANY_004] or a cont racted partner, 
to use the samples for further research. The further research will be participant  to prior 
IEC/IRB approval, if required by [CONTACT_19666].

Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_1161419]-study AE/SAE is defined as any event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE 
reporting p eriods defined in Table 10. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs 
or SAEs from former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, 
including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and 
he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention, the 
investigator will promptly notify the study contact [CONTACT_836600] 12. 
8.3.2. Method of detecting AEs and SAEs, pregnancies and other 
events 
Detection and recording of AE/SAE /pregnancies are detailed in Section 10.3.8.  
Assessment of AE/SAE intensity, causality and outcome are described  in Section 10.3.9.

parent(s)/LAR(s) is the preferred method of acquiring information related to an 
AE/SAE/pregnancy. 
8.3.3. Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs, pregnancies and 
other events  
Once an investigator (or designee) becomes aware that a study participant has 
experienced an SAE /pregnancy, it must be reported to [COMPANY_004] using the required 
documentation and within the timeframes mentioned in Table 11. This is essential for 
meeting [COMPANY_004] legal obligations and ethical responsibilities f or participant safety and the 
safety of a study intervention  under clinical investigation.  
For SAEs the investigator must always provide an assessment of causality at the time of 
the initial report, as de fined in the Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy for preparation of an investigator 
safety report of Suspected Unexpect ed Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) must be 
followed. These reports will be forwarded to investigators as necessary.  
The sponsor has the legal responsibility to notify local authorities/regulatory agencies 
about the safety of an investigational study inte rvention. The sponsor will comply with 
country-specific regulatory requirements related to safety reporting to the regulatory 
authority, IRB/IEC and investigators.

10.1.9. Study and site start  and closure  
First act of recruitment  
The study start date is the date on which the first subject is enrolled/ randomized and is 
considered the first act of enrollment.  
Study/Site termination   
[COMPANY_004] or its designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at its sole discretion, provided there is sufficient notice given to 
account for all participants safe exit from study.  
Regular closure of stu dy sites will occur upon study completion. A study site is 
considered closed when all required data/documents and study supplies have been 
collected and a study site closure visit has been performed.  
The investigator may initiate study site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable 
cause and enough notice in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_103086]:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with t he protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by [CONTACT_093]  
• Discontinuation of further study intervention development  
• Total number of parti cipants included earlier than expected  
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform

10.2.1. Descriptions of the assays to be performed in the study 
Assay descriptions could be subject to change, due to assay re -development and/or 
qualification.  
RSV-A and RSV -B neutralization assays  
The RSV-A and RSV -B neutralization assays are functional assays that measure the 
ability of serum antibodies to ne utralize RSV entry and replication in a host cell line.  
Virus neutralization is performed by [CONTACT_117838] a fixed amount of RSV  with serial 
dilutions of the test serum. Then, the serum -virus mixture is transferred onto a Vero cells 
culture and incubated for two days to allow infection of Vero cells . Thereafter, RSV-
infected cells are detected by [CONTACT_836606].  
RSVPreF3 IgG ELISA  
The ELISA assay is based on an indirect ELISA allowing the detection and the 
quantification of specific IgG antibodies directed against RSVPreF3 in human serum 
samples and related to reference standard . The optical density of each sample dilution is 
then interpolated on the reference standard. The corresponding antibody concentration, 
corrected for the dilution factor, is expressed in arbitrary ELISA Laboratory Units per 
milliliter (ELU/mL).

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  57 10.3. Appendix 3: Adverse Events: definitions and procedures for 
recording, evaluating, follow -up, and reporting  
10.3.1. Definition of an Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any unt oward medical occurrence (an unfavourable/unintended sign - including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) in a clinical 
study participant that is temporally associated with the study intervention. The AE may or 
may not be considered related to the study intervention.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Events Meeting the AE Definition  
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication 
under study.  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including eit her an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after administration of the study 
intervention even though they may have been present before study start.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug, disease or other 
interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either the 
study intervention or a concurrent medication.  
• Signs or symptoms temporally associated with administration of the study 
interventi on. 
• Signs, symptoms that require medical attention (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], physician visits 
and emergency room visits)  
• Significant failure of an expected pharmacologic or biological action.  
• Pre- or post- intervention events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated 
procedures (i.e. invasive procedures, modification of participant’s previous 
therapeutic regimen).  
• Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments 
that are present at baseline and significantly worsen following t he start of the study 
will also be reported as AEs or SAEs.  
• AEs to be recorded as solicited AEs are described in the Section 10.3.3. All other 
AEs will be recorded as UNSOLICITED AEs.  
• The signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will 
be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
217354  (RSV MAT -039) 
Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  58 [IP_ADDRESS].  Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], admission for routine examination).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the st udy that do not worsen.  
• Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a participant before 
the study intervention. These events will be recorded in the medical history section 
of the eCRF.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31782] a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed before signing the informed consent) that did not worsen from baseline.  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments associated with the underlying disease, unless judged b y the 
investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.  
10.3.2. Definition of an SAE 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life-threatening  
Note: The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer 
to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, had it been more 
severe. 
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836569]: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836570] 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1083]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17954]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836571], the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether 
“hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73256]” occ urred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious . 
d. Results in disability/incapacity  
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include 
experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza like illness, and accidental 
trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions 
but do not constitute a  substantial disruption . 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study participant  
CONFIDENTIAL  
217354  (RSV MAT -039) 
Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  59 f. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g. spontaneous abortion, f oetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy)  
g. Other situations  
Medical or scientific judgement must be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations. Important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836572]. 
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers; intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergi c bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias; and 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] . 
10.3.3. Solicited events  
a. Solicited administration  site events  
The following administration site events will be solicited:  
Table 14 Solicited administration site  events 
All age groups  
Pain  
Redness   
Swelling  
b. Solicited systemic events 
The following systemic events  will be solicited:  
Table 15 Solicited systemic events 
Fever  
Headache  
GI Symptoms (Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea, Abdominal 
pain) *  
Fatigue  
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain are collected individually.  
Note: participants/participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to measure and record 
the axillary or oral temperature  in the evening. If additional temperature measurements 
are taken at other times of the day, participants/participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s)  will be 
instructed to record the highest temperature in the e-diary. 
10.3.4. Unsolicited  adverse events  
An unsolicited adverse event is an adverse  event that was not included in a list of 
solicited events using a Participant Diary. Unsolicited events must have been 
spontaneously communicated by a participant/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) who has 
signed the informed consent. Unsolicited AEs include both serious and non -serious AEs.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
217354  (RSV MAT -039) 
Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  60 Potential unsolicited AEs may be medically attended (i.e. symptoms or illnesses requiring 
a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], or an emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider). The 
participants/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_479727](s), as well as any events that, though not 
medically attended, are of participant/parental/LAR’s concern. Detailed information 
about reported uns olicited AEs will be collected by [CONTACT_377360]’s records.  
Unsolicited AEs that are not medically attended or perceived as a concern by [CONTACT_2416]/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be collected during an interview with the 
participants/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  and by [CONTACT_836607].  
10.3.5. Adverse events of special interest  (AESIs) 
Not applicable  
10.3.6. Clinical laboratory parameters and other abnormal assessments 
qualifying  as AEs or SAEs   
If the investigator considers it necessary to conduct laboratory tests  to rule out any 
SAE/Medically attended SAE during the participation in the study, those results should 
be shared with the central team.  
In the absence of a diagnosis, a bnormal laboratory findings assessments or other 
abnormal results the investigator considers clinically significant will be recorded as an 
AE or SAE, if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE (refer to Sections 10.3.1 and 
10.3.2).  
The investigator must exercise his or her medical and scientific judgement in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding, or other abnormal assessment is clinically 
significant.  
10.3.7. Events or outcomes not qualifying as AEs or SAEs  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy  
Female participants who become pregnant after administration of the study intervention 
may continue the study at the discretion of the investigator.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SA E, any abnormal pregnancy 
outcome or complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will 
be recorded and reported as an SAE. Please refer to Section 10.3.2 for definition of SAE.

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  61 10.3.8. Recording and follow -up of AEs, SAEs , and pregnancies  
The participants/participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_836608].  
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the investigator’s responsibility to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event. The investigator  will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE 
on the eCRF. The investigator may not send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records to [COMPANY_004] instead of appropriately completing the eCRF.  
There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_836573] r ecords for certain cases are requested by 
[CONTACT_23983]. In this case, all participant identifiers will be blinded on copi[INVESTIGATOR_836574].  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event, based on 
signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SAE instead of individual signs/symptoms.  
An electronic Diary ( eDiary) will  be used in this study to capture solicited administration 
site or sys temic events. The participant should be trained on how and when to complete 
the eDiary. 
Anyone who measures administration site or systemic events and who will record the 
event in the eDiary should  be trained on using the eDiary. This training must be 
documented in the participant’s source record.  
Note: eDiary may be completed by a minor participant under the supervision of the 
participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  provided the minor is capable of assessing and reporting 
the information to be recorded on eDiary. The ultimate accountability for completion of 
the eDiary remains with the participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s). The investigator should 
discuss this accountability with the participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s). Please see SPM for 
more detail  
Collect and verify completed eDiary during discussions with the participant/participant’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s) on Visit 2 (Day 31) and Visit 3 (Day 61) . 
Any unreturned  eDiary device will be sought from the participant/participant’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s)  through tel ephone call(s) or any other convenient procedure.   
Refer to the SPM for more information regarding the use of eDiary.

Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  62 [IP_ADDRESS].  Time period for collecting and recording AEs, SAEs, and pregnancies  
All solicited events that occur for 7 days following administration of each dose  (RSV 
maternal vaccine  or dTpa) of study intervention  (Day 1 to Day 7) and (Day 31 to Day 38) 
must be recorded into  the eDiary, irrespective of intensity. All other AEs occurring 
within this time frame should be r ecorded into  the appropriate section of the eCRF , 
irrespective of their intensity or whether or not they are considered related to the study 
intervention.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Follow-up of AEs, SAEs, pregnancies or any other events of interest  
After the initial AE/SAE /pregnancy  or any other event of interest, the investigator is 
required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs  
will be followed until the event is resolved, stabilised, otherwise explained, or the 
participant is lost to follow-up. 
Other non -serious AEs  must be followed until the end of the study  or until the participant 
is lost to follow -up. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Follow-up during the study  
If a participant dies during their participation in the study or during a recognised follow -
up period,  [COMPANY_004] will be provided with any available post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Follow-up after the participant is discharged from the study  
The investigator will provide any new or updated relevant information to [COMPANY_004] on a 
previously reported SAE  using a paper/electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report 
and/or pregnancy report as applicable. The investigator is obliged to perform or arrange 
for the conduct of supplemental clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the SAE as fully as possible.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Follow-up of pregnancies  
Pregnant participants will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. At the 
end of the pregnancy, whether full -term or premature, information on the status of the 
mother and c hild will be forwarded to [COMPANY_004] using the electronic pregnancy report and the 
Expedited Adverse Events Report if applicable. Generally, the follow -up period does not 
need to be longer than [ADDRESS_1161438]-study pregnancy AND it is considered by [CONTACT_836609], he/she must report this information to [COMPANY_004] as described in the

access to the participant’s eCRF  
When additional SAE  or pregnancy information is received after write access to the 
participant’s eCRF is removed, new or updated information should be recorded on the 
appropriate paper report, with all changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_093]. The 
updated report should be faxed to the Study contact [CONTACT_103738] (refer to Section

[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of intensity  
The intensity of the following solicited AEs will be assessed as described:  
Table 16 Intensity scales for solicited events in adults and children of 6 years 
of age or more  
The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the study. The assessment 
will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgement.

CONFIDENTIAL  
217354  (RSV MAT -039) 
Protocol  Amendment 1  Final  
17 March 2022  64 The intensity should be assigned to 1 of the following categories:  
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3  should not be confused with an SAE. Grade 3 
is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets 1 of the pre -defined 
outcomes as described in the Section 10.3.2. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of causality  
The investigator must assess the relationship between study intervention  and the 
occurrence of each unsolicited AE/SAE using clinical judgement. Where several different 
interventions were administered, the investigator should specify, when possible, if the 
unsolicited AE/SAE could be causally related to a specific intervention.  When a causal 
relationship to a specific study intervention cannot be determined, the investigator should 
indicate the unsolicited AE/SAE to be related to all interventions.  
Alternative possible causes, such as the natural history of underlying disease, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study intervention  will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult 
the IB and/or SmPC and/or Prescribing Information for marketed products  to assist in 
making his/her assessment.  
Causality should be assessed by [CONTACT_163586]:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the unsolicited AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_5562]?  
YES : There is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention  contributed 
to the AE.  
NO : There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally related to the 
administration of the study intervention. There are other, more likely 
causes and administration of the study intervention is not suspected to 
have contributed to the AE.  
If an event meets the criteria to be determined ‘serious’ (see Section 10.3.2), addition al 
examinations/tests will be performed by [CONTACT_227274].

record an assessment of causality for every event before submitting the Expedited 
Adverse Events Report to [COMPANY_004].  
The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements. The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_710900].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Medically attended visits  
For each solicited and unsolicited AE  the participant experiences, the 
participant/participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be asked if she  received medical attention 
(defined as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], or an otherwise unschedule d visit to or from medical 
personnel for any reason, including emergency room visits). Only serious medical 
attended visits will be recorded in the eCRF/ Expedited Adverse Events Report , and/if 
solicited in the eDiary.

• Postmenopausal female  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not 
using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in 
the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use a 
non-hormonal, highly effective contraception method if they wish to continue their 
HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation 
of postmenopausal status before study enrolment . 
10.4.2. Contraception g uidance  
• Female participants of childb earing potential are eligible to participate if they agree 
to use a highly effective contraceptive method consistently and correctly according 
to the methods listed in [COMPANY_004]’s list of highly effective contraceptive methods ( Table 
17).

• Medical device AE is any untoward medical occurrence, in a clinical study 
participant, users, or other persons, temporally associated with the use of study 
intervention  whether considered related to a medical device or not. An AE can 
therefore be any unfav orable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the 
use of a medical device. This definition includes events related to the medical device 
or comparator and events r elated to the procedures involved.  
• An adverse device effect (ADE) is an AE related to the use of a medical device. This 
definition includes any AE resulting from:  
− insufficient or inadequate instructions for use (i.e. user error), or  
− any malfunction of a medical device, or  
− intentional misuse of the medical device.

A medical device SAE is any serious adverse event that:  
a. Led to death   
b. Led to serious deterioration in the health of the participant, that either  resulted in:  
− A life-threatening illness or injury. The term ‘life -threatening' in the definition 
of ‘serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at 
the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically mi ght 
have caused death, if it were more severe.  
− A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function.  
− Inpatient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -
existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without ser ious 
deterioration in health, is not considered an SAE.  
− Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function.  
c. Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnor mality or birth defect  
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) definition  
• A SADE is defined as an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
• Any device deficiency that might have led to an SAE if appropriate action had not 
been taken or circumstances had been less fortunate.  
Unanticipated SADE ([LOCATION_003]DE) definition  
• An [LOCATION_003]DE (also identified as UADE in US Regulations 21 CFR 813.3),  is a 
serious adverse device effect that by [CONTACT_5942], inciden ce, severity or outcome has 
not been identified in the current version of the IB.  
10.6.3. Recording and reporting of medical device AE, ADEs, SADEs and 
[LOCATION_003]DE 
• Any device deficiency must be reported to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours after the 
investigator determines that the event meets the definition of a device deficiency.  
• Refer to paper ‘Medical device or combination product with device 
deficiency/incident report form’ for details on transmission of this information to the 
sponsor. 
• [COMPANY_004] will review all device deficiencies, d etermine and document in writing whether 
they could have led to an SAE. These device deficiencies will be reported to the 
regulatory authorities and IRBs/IECs as required by [CONTACT_2091].

Section 1.2  Schema 
Based on all safety information  available from RSV MAT -009 study (following  
administration of RSV MAT vaccine), there will be no further enrollment and 
vaccination of participants in this study.  
There will be no more blood samples collected as part of this study , except the  study 
participant s who has received RSV  maternal vaccine at Visit [ADDRESS_1161443] of care 
and or immunization recommendation and after consultation with their attending 
physician ; the participant ca n always receive any commercially available dTpa vaccine . 
[COMPANY_004] will bear the cost of th e vaccine.  
All participants who receive the first dose of  study interventions ( RSV maternal vaccine  
or dTpa) will be followed for safety and reactogenicity and evaluated for  both solicited 
administration site (local) and systemic events within 7 days of va ccination, unsolicited 
AEs within 30 days of vaccination,  SAEs and pregnancy outcomes throughout the study 
period ([ADDRESS_1161444] dose of  study interventions ). 
All safety data will be reviewed by  a Safety Review Team (SRT) and  an independent 
data monitoring committee  (IDMC). (See Section 8.2.3 for more details)

Section 2.1 Study Rationale  
• Following  review of data  collected so far from the RSV MAT -[ADDRESS_1161446] been observed in infants 
born to vaccinated mothers who received RSV maternal vac cine versus those who 
received a placebo. The safety signals are being investigated and, although at this 
time a cause has not been determined, based on the above observations, [COMPANY_004] has 
nevertheless decided to stop enrolment and vaccination for all actively  enrolling 
RSV MAT studies.  
• There will be no new participants included in this study . However, safety 
monitoring of all 8 study participants (of the planned 252 study participants) 
enrolled and vaccinated in RSV MAT -[ADDRESS_1161447] of the study period.  
• The vaccination planned at visit [ADDRESS_1161448] 2 at Day 38 and 
Visit 3 at Day 61 are not applicable anymore. Visit 4a (Day 181) and Visit 4b (Day 
211) are replaced by a telephone contact [CONTACT_98205] 181.  
•  A blood s ample for immunogenicity assessment in the study participants who 
received first dose of RSV Maternal vaccine will  continue to  be collected at Visit 2 
only. No other blood samples will be collected.  
• All planned objectives will be analysed and reported in a descriptive manner for  
the 8 enrolled participants.  
Section 2.3  Benefit/Risk assessment  
Following a recommendation from the IDMC, the Sponsor made the decision to pause 
the enrollment, randomization and vaccination of pregnant st udy participants in our 
active studies based on an observation of imbalance of the proportion of preterm births 
between the vaccine group and the placebo group in the RSV MAT -009 study in 
pregnant women. This pause was to allow for an evaluation of the ava ilable data in 
RSV MAT -009 to better understand the safety signal observed. Following a review of 
additional unblinded data from RSV MAT -009 trial in which a higher proportion of 
neonatal deaths reported in the treatment group compared to the placebo group  was 
also observed, the Sponsor decided to STOP enrollment and vaccination in these 
studies.

further vaccination of participants in the RSV MAT studies enrolling both pregnant 
women on February 25, 2022 and non -pregnant women on March 1, 2022. The study 
remains ongoing for safety follow -up. Participants already vaccinated will continue to 
be monitored until the end of the study.

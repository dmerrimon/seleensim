 Confidential Property of Genomind, Inc.  1 OVERVIEW AND STUDY P LAN  
This Statistical A nalysis Plan (SAP) provides a prospective plan for data handling and statistical 
analyses  for the Genomind MDD -001 study "An 8 -Week Prospective Randomized, Controlled, 
Double -Blind Trial of the Genecept Assay ™ vs. Treatment -as-Usual to Evaluate Efficacy of Assay -
Guided Treatment in Adults with Major Depressive Disorder ." The SAP adds detail to the statistical 
methods given in the study protocol , and ensure s credibility of study findings by [CONTACT_094] -specifying the 
key statistical approaches prior to study start . As, necessary, SAP amendments clarify and document 
changes to statistical procedures, or align the SAP with protocol amendments.   
1.1 SAP Version s 
SAP Version 2.0  detailed the analyses for the main study (n  300, adult MDD). It was finalized, 
signed, and approved by [CONTACT_617678] .  
SAP Version 3.[ADDRESS_820261] ions  to the main study analyses. Protocol Amendment 2 added a sub -study, the Exploratory 
Elderly MDD Study, a follow -on to main study  of  70 subjects , age  65, utilizing a subset of sites in 
the main study. SAP Version 3.0 was signed and approved by [CONTACT_617679].  
SAP Version 4.0 , this version, aligns the SAP with Protocol Amendment 3, which added details 
regarding the Exploratory Elderly MDD Study , and clarified that this study would be analyzed 
separately from the main study.  SAP Version 4.0, makes no changes to the main study analyses, but 
rather makes changes to the Exploratory Elderly MDD Study analyses consistent with its exploratory 
nature  
1.2 Study Description  
This study compares efficacy and safety outcomes in M ajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) adult 
patients randomized to assay -guided treatment (AGT) or treatment -as-usual (TAU) . The treatment 
duration will be 8 -weeks. Subjects will be assessed at visits at Week 2, 4, 6 and 8. Approximately 300 
subjects will be rand omized 1:1 to the two treatment group (AGT and TAU) . This is a multi -center 
trial, with approximately 25 sites in the US.  
Randomization will be by [CONTACT_10966]. The treating investigator will be unblinded to treatment assignment 
(necessarily). Other site staff, s ponsor staff (including site monitors) and all others will be blinded to 
treatment assignment for the duration of the subject’s participation in the study.  The (blinded) rater 
for the primary endpoint, the SIGH -D-[ADDRESS_820262] such as collection of screening data, follow -up assessments, documentation of adverse 
events, etc. Blinded raters will not discuss subjects with other study staff.  
After recruitment for main study is completed, an additiona l 70 subjects , age 65 years and older will 
be randomized  to the Exploratory Elderly MDD Study . This follow -on sub-study will apply all 
procedures of the main study to this elderly population subset.

 Confidential Property of Genomind, Inc.  1.3 Study Objectives  
Primary Objective  
 To assess efficacy of assay -guided treatment (AGT) versus treatment -as-usual (TAU) in Major 
Depressive Disorder, as measured by [CONTACT_617680] (SIGH -D-17) at 8 
weeks.  
Secondary Objectives  
 To assess efficacy of assay -guided trea tment (AGT) versus treatment -as-usual (TAU) in Major 
Depressive Disorder, as measured by [CONTACT_617681] (QIDS -
SR16) at 8 weeks.  
 To assess the percentage of responders at Week 8, based on SIGH -D-17, QIDS -SR16, and Clinical 
Global Impression –Improvement (CGI -I), respectively . Treatment response will be defined in 3 
different ways:  
- Blinded Rater Assessment: ≥ 50% reduction from baseline of SIGH -D-17 score ;    
- Subject -Rated Assessment: ≥ 50% reduction from baseline of QIDS -SR1 6 ;  
- Unblinded Clinician Assessment: < 3 score on the CGI -I;  
 To assess the percentage of remitters at Week 8, based on the SIGH -D-17 and QIDS -SR16, 
respectively. Remission is defined for the SIGH -D-17 and the QIDS -SR16:  
- Blinded Rater Assessment: ≤ 7 score  on the SIGH -D-17; 
- Subject -Rated Assessment: ≤ 5 score on the QIDS -SR16  
 To assess the impact of the Genecept Assay ™ on adverse events, based on Frequency, Intensity and 
Burden of Side Effects Rating (FIBSER) and Patient -Related Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE), 
frequency and severity of adverse events and Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) 
outcomes.   
 After completion of the main MDD study , to conduct the Exploratory Elderly MDD Study, to 
preliminarily assess the efficacy and safety of AGT vs TAU  in the elderly , age  65. This study will 
provide additional data on this important, Medicare -eligible population, which is sparsely 
represented in the Main Study (<  8% of subjects). As specified in Protocol Amendment 2, after the 
Main Study enrollm ent finishes, approximately 70 subjects, age   65, will be randomized to the 
this add-on study. Except for change in age of inclusion, all study procedures will be identical to 
the Main Study.   Primary efficacy will be measured by [CONTACT_617682] 
(SIGH -D-17) at 8 weeks.

 Confidential Property of Genomind, Inc.  1.4 Randomization  
Approximately 300  for the main study , plus an additional 70 subjects age  65 for the Exploratory 
Elderly MDD Study , will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Assay -Guided Treatment (AGT) or 
Treatment as Usual (TAU). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_3725], using a variable block size 
randomization to minimize bias. Randomization will be completed via IWRS during th e Baseline visit, 
after Screening and Baseline inclusion/exclusion criteria have been satisfied . 
2 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PROCEDURES  
Note: Unless stated otherwise, this section applies to both the Main Study and the Exploratory Elderly 
MDD Study. Procedures, in general, may be adjusted in the Exploratory Elderly MDD Study t o reflect 
sparse sample sizes, eg, substitution of a short listing in place of a full table.  
Summarizations will be provided in tables and figures. S afety and efficacy variables will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_16750]. For continuous variables, this will include the 
number of non -missing values, mean, standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the mean, median, 
minimum, and maximum.  Categorical variables will be  summarized using counts and percentages.  
Unless otherwise stated, the significance level for statistical tests will be two-sided, alpha=0.05, with 
no adjustment for multiple comparisons  
Pooled Investigative Sites: For all statistical analyses, sites with  few subjects (< 7 subjects) will be 
pooled into a single larger site .  "Investigative site" in all statistical analyses will refer to "sites" as 
pooled.  
SIGH -D-[ADDRESS_820263] ings . SIGH -D-17 statistical analyses, summaries, and listings will otherwise rely 
solely on the revised  SIGH -D-17 scores. N ote, SIGH -D-17 inclusion criteria are based on the original 
site rater screening and baseline SIGH -D-17, irrespective of any later revision after central review.   
Note:  No central rater  evaluation will be done for the Exploratory Elder ly MDD Study, as the sites 
enrolling subj ects will continue from the Main Study and already have trained, experienced site raters.  
Data will be reported and analyzed using SAS software, version 9.[ADDRESS_820264] the difference in 
Week 8 outcomes for all subjects, irrespective of attrition or compliance . [Thi s may also be described 
as following the Intent to Treat (ITT) principle, but there is confusion about the use of this term when 
there is missing data, and ITT term inology will not  be used further here.]. Specifying the "estima nds") 
(what is being estimated) , aligned with the study purpose, is the basis for the formal statistical 
methods which follow.

2.4 Analysis Datasets  
All Randomized Set : All randomized subjects . Special handling of patients entering the trial more 
than once: Only the data for the first study participation will be analyzed. Data from the second study 
participation will be reviewed for safety , but not included in any analysis set or analysis.  
Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized subjects with baseline and post -baseline SIGH -D-[ADDRESS_820266] who was treated before randomization (116 -001) will not be included in the 
FAS.  
Safety Analysis Set (SAF) : All randomized subjects who complete the (post -randomization) baseline 
appointment with the treating investigator, i .e., start AGT or TA U treatment.  
The FAS  will be the primary dataset for all efficacy analyses. Note that, as described above, the 
desired estimands are based on all randomized patients.  It is anticipated the percent of patients 
missing post -baseline SIGH -D-[ADDRESS_820267] -
baseline, will particularly be reviewed.  If the number  of FAS subjects is less than 95% of the All 
Randomized Set, the primary and secondary analyses will be conducted on this dataset as sensitivity 
analyses.  
3 STATISTICAL METHODS  
Note: Unless stated otherwise, this section applies to both the Main Study and th e Exploratory Elderly 
MDD Study. In general, in the Exploratory Elderly MDD Study analyses may be adjusted t o reflect sparse 
sample sizes, e.g., substitution of a short listing in place of a full table.  
The efficacy analyses for the Exploratory Elderly MDD Study are specified at the end of the  Efficacy 
Analyses , Section 3.4.

The number of subjects will be summarized by [CONTACT_617683]. Randomized sub jects excluded from the SAF and FAS populations will be listed. 
The number and percentage of subjects per treatment group who prematurely discontinued 
treatment  will be presented by [CONTACT_560225], by [CONTACT_1570], for SAF population.  The number 
and percentage of subjects per treatment group who prematurely discontinued from the study  will 
be presented by [CONTACT_560225], for the SAF and FAS populations. A CONSORT style (Ref) flow chart 
will describe premature study discontinuation fo r the FAS population. The coded Reason for 
Premature Discontinuation will be  summarized (number and percentage) by [CONTACT_617684].  The verbatim Reason for Discontinuation and Additional Information text entries

 Confidential Property of Genomind, Inc.  will be listed. The c oded Reason for Discontinuation and verbatim Reason for Discontinuation and 
Additional Information may be used in sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy analysis.   
3.2 Demographic and Pretreatment Characteristics  
Demographics ( age, race, sex, weight, height, and BMI) , disease severity [including SIGH -D-17 at 
screening and baseline; QIDS -SR16  and CGI -S at baseline ], number of failed , adequate  treatment 
regimens in the current MDD epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]  (1 vs > 1), previous depression treatment /history , and other 
scree ning/baseline visit assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_765]  (Screening, Baseline) and 
treatment group using descriptive statistics.  The n umber of failed, adequate treatments  will be 
considered to be > [ADDRESS_820269] MDD medications (FDA approved for MDD or approved 
by [CONTACT_617685]) are entered in the eCRF as "ATRQ Failed Medications ," 
with daily dose greater than or equal to the minimum MDD dose , and given for at least 6 weeks.  
3.3 Depression Treatment and Concomi tant Medications  
Depression Drug Treatment  
On-study depression drugs (taken between Day 0  and Week 8 visit ) will be summarized by [CONTACT_617686] , for the Safety Population. Treatment Exposure (days) to on-study depression drugs (days) 
from Day 0 to Week 8 will be summarized for the Safety Population by [CONTACT_617687]. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, minimum, medi an, and maximum) will be 
presented .  
Concomitant Medications  
CNS drugs (taken between Day 0 and Week 8 visit) will be summarized by [CONTACT_617688], for 
the Safe ty Population. Multiple medication use by a subject will be counted only once.   
All other c oncomitant medication s use (medication taken between Day 0 and Week 8 visit) will be 
listed.  Additional summarizations may be done to help interpret study findings.  
3.4 Efficacy Analyses  
Note : The Efficacy Analyses for the Exploratory Elderly MDD Study will be given at the end of this 
section.  Generally, the statistical methods for the Exploratory Elderly MDD Study will follow the outline 
of the Main Study, but will be primarily descriptive, and statistical analyses will be simpler, as 
necessitated by [CONTACT_617689].  
Primary Endpoint Analyses  
A Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) analysis will test whether AGT shows greater 
improvement in SIGH -D-17 at Week 8 than TAU. Formally, the analysis tests for a difference in mean 
change from baseline to Week 8 between the treatment groups, in the FAS population.  Compared to 
analyzing All Randomized subjects, this excludes subjects who don't return after the Baseline Visit, 
which is generally acceptable , if this excluded group is small.  
SAP Version 4.[ADDRESS_820270] categorical factors investigative site, treatment 
group (AGT and TAU; 2 levels),  visit (Weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8; 4 levels), and treatment x visit interaction. 
The interaction term will remain  in the model regardless of statistical significance. An unstructured 
covariance pattern will be used to estimate the variance -covariance matrix of the within -subject 
repeated measures (i.e., model within -subject errors). The variance -covariance matrix wil l be 
estimated across both treatment arms. The fixed effects will be estimated by [CONTACT_617690] -Raphson algorithm, based on all available data. 
The denominator degrees of freedom and adjustment of s tandard errors  will use the Kenward -Roger 
method .  
Assignment of SIGH -D-17 assessments to Visit  for primary MMRM analysis : 
Day 7 -20 SIGH -D-17 => Week 2 Visit  
Day 21 -34 SIGH -D-17 => Week 4 Visit  
Day 35 -48 SIGH -D-17 => Week 6 Visit  
Day 49 -70 SIGH -D-17 => Week [ADDRESS_820271] 
squares (LS) means from the treatment x visit intera ction in the MMRM model. The primary analysis 
will test the difference (contrast) between the Week [ADDRESS_820272] p -value and the 95% CI for the difference in Week 8 means will be presented . Comparisons 
between the AGT  and TAU means at Week 2, Week 4 and Week  6 will also be generated. Diagnostics 
for outliers, non -normality and other model assumptions will be run. Findings will be followed up 
with sensitivity analyses , as appropriate . 
To allow comparison with previous SIGH -D-17 studies, two supportive analyses of the primary 
endpoint will be produced. Each will be an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) : 
 1) Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) analysis, and  
 2) Observed Cases (OC) analysis.  
Each ANCOVA will include baseline SIGH -D-17, Investigative Site and Treatment Group as the 
independent variables in the model. The dependent variable for the LOCF analysis will be last 
available SIGH -D-17 change from baseline. The depende nt variable for th e OC analysis will be the 
Week 8 SIGH -D-17 score , with no imputation of missing Week 8 scores . 
Missing Data  
The MMRM analysis may be biased unless the missing SIGH -D-17 visit data are Missing at Random 
(MAR). This is because the MMRM , as well as LOCF and OC ANCOVA  analyses assume the unobserved 
missing data has the same behavior as the observed data  for the same treatment group and 
covariates. [For example, if a computer failure causes loss of some Week  8 SIGH -D-17 scores, this 
missing data should be MAR: the missing data is not informative about the actual Week [ADDRESS_820273] dropout resulting from , (un-measured) worsening depression, 
then these missing scores would likely be Not Missing at Random (NMAR)].  
To address this issue, if there is more than 10% missing Week [ADDRESS_820274] (i.e., p -value <0.[ADDRESS_820275]), fur ther 
analyses may be performed.  LS Mean Difference s for each subgroup factor will be graphically 
displayed.

second pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (Study 3), is more rigorous, adding randomization and rater/subject blinding, 
with ext rapolated Cohen's d = 0.[ADDRESS_820290] study (Study 2) shows a somewhat lower Cohen's d (0.43), a more reliable result due to 
the much larger sample size and the added sensitivity analyses to assess robustness.  Accepting th at 
there remains potential bias due to the non -randomized, open design, this study result was used as 
the best available basis for sample size calculation.  
The sample size is calculated for the two -sided alpha=0.05, 90% power test of two independent 
means of improvement in SIGH -D-17. In this case t he sample size depends only on the postulated 
Cohen's d, and the % dropouts.  Note this should be a conservative estimat ion of sample size, as the 
actual analysis will use a more efficient MMRM method.  However, this conservatism is balanced by 
[CONTACT_617692].  
Using the Trial 2 observed difference in SIGH -D-17 improvement an d variability, with resulting 
Cohen's d=0.43, the resulting sample size is 115 per group, with no dropouts.  If we assume the 
dropout rate somewhat less than the reference (23% vs 27%  reference ), then with the conventional 
dropout correction, the needed sam ple size per group is 150, or 300 total randomized subjects.  The 
table below summarizes the design properties of this size study, under varying assumptions for delta, 
power and % missing Week [ADDRESS_820291] ing significance lev el is two -

All sample size calculations used Stata Version 13 sof tware.  
As reiterated above, the reference study is not a definitive foundation for sample size calculation.  
However, it may be expected the following w ould hold:  
1) The base planning SIGH -D-17 delta, at 3.1, is a high bar for an active vs active treatment 
depression trial. Commonly, the planning delta for placebo controlled depression trials is 3.0 
(SIGH -D-17 units) and active vs active studies can expect delta of 1.5 or less and may often 
designed as non -inferiority studies . It could be argued that a planning delta should be 2.5 or 
less.  
2) We expect the SD for this study should be less than the reference study.   SIGH -D-17 will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_11136], trained SIGH -D-17 raters, centrally monitored by [CONTACT_617693]. 
This reduces bias and improves precision, and should result in the primary endpoint being 
more accurate, with a smaller SD. A reduction of the S D by 15% seems reasonable (SD=6.12).  
3) We expect the 8 -week dropout rate will be considerably less than the reference, as well as the 
nominal 23% used in the base sample size calculation. As discussed in Section 8.1, as this trial 
will institute measures to reduce missing data, consistent with the recommendations by [CONTACT_941] 
2010 NRC Missing Data panel.  This , combined with the observed lower dropout rate in active 
vs active trials, suggests a target of 10% dropouts is realistic.   
Assuming the improved rigor of t he trial conduct reduces the SD by 15% and the dropout rate to 
10%, then with [ADDRESS_820292], the “detectable delta” is more 
realistic: 2.42 with 90% power, and 2.09 with 80% power.

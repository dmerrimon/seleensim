PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
 
Common  use of a group of cancer medications called anthracyclines has dramatically i mproved cancer 
survival number s over the past [ADDRESS_264013] cancer, lymphomas, leukemias, and sarcomas.  Unfortunately, the use of 
anthracyclines is limited due to their poisonous  effects on the heart, including the development of a form 
of heart failure called anthracycline -induced cardiomy opathy (AIC).  These effects can be seen as late as 
IRB NUMBER: HSC-SPH-15-0443
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/13/2017
 
Vsn 1. 5-06/01/[ADDRESS_264014] that the usual medications used to treat heart failure ( e.g. ACE 
inhibitor s, angiote nsin receptor blockers, beta -blockers, and statins) may help treat AIC, there continues 
to be a group of patients that will develop worsening symptoms and end -stage heart failure despi[INVESTIGATOR_219728], with many individuals worsening t o the point of requiring a heart transplant.   Due to 
the small number of donor organs, very few people receive heart transplants when they need one.  
 
Stem cells are cells that do not yet have a specific function in the body.  Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) 
are a type of stem cell that can be grown from bone marrow (the spongy tissue inside of bones). Stem 
cells can develop into other types of more mature (specific) cells, such as blood and muscle cells .  It is 
hoped that by [CONTACT_219743] t, they will allow the heart to work better  and reduce the 
scarred heart tissue associated with heart failure .   
 
Rather than taking these cells from your own bone marrow (which has been exposed to the cancer 
medications  in the past), MSCs can be taken fro m a healthy donor (who has never had chemotherapy).  
This type of stem cell is called allogeneic (or allo for short).   
 
The purpose of this research study  is to determine whether giving allo-MSCs to patients with AIC is safe  
and whether these trea tments i mprove heart function . You are being asked to be in this research study 
because you have been diagnosed with AIC and you have been cancer -free for at least two years .  You 
also have left ventricular dysfunction (your heart does not pump blood as well as it  should) and because of 
this you are experiencing heart failure.  
 
Randomization  
If you agree to take part in this study , you will be randomized (similar to flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) to receive one of 
two study  products : allo-MSCs  or a placebo ( which is a solution that contains no cells, only salt and 
proteins).  It is not known whether the cells will be of benefit.  For this reason, some study participants 
must receive a placebo.  This will allow a careful comparison to study the benefits and side effects of the 
study product containing cells .  One half of the patients will receive allo-MSCs  and one half of the 
patients  will receive placebo.   Neither you nor your doctors treating you will know what study product  
you will receive.  Regardless of which group you are i n, you will otherwise receive the same standard 
treatment for your heart failure.  
 
The allo-MSCs given to you in this study will be taken from the bone marrow of a healthy human donor .  
Giving patients allo-MSCs , is an investigational procedure that has be en authorized by [CONTACT_33438] (FDA) for this study.   
 
STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSOCIATED RISKS  
 
Importantly, your taking part in this research study will not affect the usual treatment of medical therapy 
that all patients with heart failur e receive.   If you agree to take part in this study you will undergo several 
tests and procedures during outpatient visit s and during the follow -up visits  which are in addition to those 
normally performed for patients being treated for heart failure .  To t ake part in this study , you must return 
for all scheduled follow -up visits, as instructed by [CONTACT_4904], until follow -up is no longer necessary. As 
a participant in this study, you agree to keep your doctor  informed of all future changes in your address  
and phone number .   
 
After you sign the informed consent form, you will be asked to have several tests and exams to see if you 
are eligible for the study. You will have up  to [ADDRESS_264015] completed these tests, the results

A needle will be inserted into the vein of your arm and blood will be withdrawn (about 2-3 tablespoons on 
seven  different occasions or about 14-21 tablespoons total for the entire  trial).  If you agree to the optional 
biorepository (described later in this consent form) there will be additional blood draws on five occasions.    
 
As required by [CONTACT_219744] (FDA), your blood will 
be tested for certain viruses such as hepatitis and HIV.  If you test positive for active Hepatitis B, 
Hepatitis C, or HIV you will not be able to take part in this study.  In addition , the lab is required by [CONTACT_219745] <INSERT ALL RELEVANT STATE REPORTING AGENCIES>.  
Reportable data may include: patient name, birth date, ethnicity, race, residence, date of specimen

You will be asked to walk in a corridor (without elevation).  You will be asked to walk at your own pace , 
while trying to cover as much ground as possible in six minutes. You can stop and rest during the test, but 
you will be asked to resume walking as soon as you feel you are able to do so.  After six minutes, you will 
be asked to stop walking.  The total distance walked and symptoms experienced during the walk (e.g., 
chest pain, trouble breathing, a feeling of tiredness, dizziness)  will be recorded.  This testing will be 
completed at the beginning of the study and also at months [ADDRESS_264023] a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  exam  at the beginning of the study  and again at 
the 6- and 12 -month visits . A MRI is used to deter mine how healthy your heart is and how well it works. 
MRI uses large magnets and radio frequency waves to make pi[INVESTIGATOR_219729]; no 
radiation exposure is involved. This test gathers information about the heart by [CONTACT_219746]. The MRI is used to look at the presence of disease in the heart.    
Before this test, you will be asked if you have certain metals in your body .  Additionally, if you have a  
pacemaker/internal cardiac defibrillator (ICD) , the study doctor will check your device by [CONTACT_2329] a 
wand placed on the skin over your ICD. The study team  will be checking you during the test by [CONTACT_2329] a 
blood pressure cuff, heart monitor, and oxygen monitor throughout the scan. The MRI scans take 60 -90 
minut es on average, but may take a little longer (20 -30 additional minutes) if you have one of these 
devices.  
During your MRI exam , you will lie on a padded table. You will have an intravenous (IV) line placed in 
your arm.  A soft padded coil will be placed at the area where the pi[INVESTIGATOR_219730]. The coil is 
necessary to help the MRI machine take pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]. The table will be moved into the center of a long narrow 
tube. If you have a history of claustrophobia (being uncomfortable in an enclosed space), tell the study 
nurse  in advance .  A small dose of medicine <INSERT NAME [CONTACT_219762]> can be given to help 
you feel less anxious .  A large magnet inside the tube will begin taking pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]. When the pi[INVESTIGATOR_219731] , it is normal for the MRI machine to make lo ud banging and clicking noises.  You may be asked to 
wear earplugs or headphones for your comfort during the exam. During the exam, the MRI staff is able to

Cardiac Catheterization/ Left Ventricular  Angio cardio graphy  and NOGA Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_219732], the doctor will insert a long, narrow tube called a catheter , into a 
blood vessel, usually in your leg, and then guide the catheter to your heart with the help of a special X -ray 
machine. X -ray dye is then injected through the catheter so that the X -ray machine can take 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]/movies of the left ventricle (left lower chamber) of your heart. The doctor uses a special device , 
called NOGA,  which  monitors the electrical and mechanical function of your heart. This procedure, 
referred to as NOGA mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], will help your doctor find out which part of your  heart muscle is still 
healthy but is not receiving enough blood and oxygen because this is the part that is most likely to 
respond to the study product injections. This helps the doctor decide where to inject the study product . 
 
Study Product In jection   
Your doctor will use a special catheter with a retractable needle (called a NOGA Myostar catheter) to 
inject the study product into the damaged area of your heart muscle.  This catheter is investigational and 
not approved by [CONTACT_1622]. There will be about 20 injections of a very small amount (a drop) of fluid 
containing millions of cells , or placebo , into your hea rt muscle. Following the procedure, you wil l be 
watched carefully , overnight  in a telemetry (ECG monitored) unit . 
 
Echocardiogram (Echo)  
An echocardi ogram (echo)  is an ultrasound image of your heart.  It is used to see how well your heart is 
working .  First a gel is put on your chest.  A device called a transducer is moved over the surface of your 
chest.  The transducer pi[INVESTIGATOR_219733] a monitor to show a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103].  This test checks the heart size, how well it pumps, and how well the heart  valves look and work.  
There is no exposure to radiation with this test. A dye that helps the echocardiogram device to look at 
your heart  may be injected into one of your veins as part of this procedure.  You will have an echo after 
the study product injection, during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219734].   
 
Stress Echocardiogram (Stress echo) - (NOT ALL PARTICIPANTS)  
During t his test, an echocardiogram is done both before and after your heart is stressed either by [CONTACT_219747] a medicine that makes your heart beat harder and faster  (to imitate exercise) . 
A stress echocardiogram is usually done to find ou t if you might have decreased blood flow to your heart 
(coronary artery disease).   You would only have this test done if the study physician thinks you may 
have coronary artery disease and there are no recent tests  in your medical record that test for it . 
 
Temperature Log  
You will be asked to take and record your temperature two times a day for one  week fol lowing your 
injection procedure.  The purpose of this is to monitor for infection.  You will be given a “Temperature 
Log” before you are discharged  to ke ep track of your temperatures twice a day for 1 week .  Instructions 
for reporting an increase in temperature are on the log.  You will be asked to turn in your log at your one-
week  visit.   Should signs of infection be present, your study  doctor  will ask yo u to return for a physical 
examination, and if necessary you may be started on an antibiotic treatment.

Follow up Visits  
You will be asked to return for follow -up visits at  1 week and  1-, 6- and 12 months after your injection  
procedure.  A brief telephone interview will be conducted at 24 months.  Please refer to the schedule of 
activities for specifics tests and assessments to be performed at each visit.  
 
Time Commitment  
The study elements and time are: (1) Baseline testing and injection visits - about 9 hours over several days; 
(2) overnight stay following injection and day of discharge activities  (about 24 hours); ( 3) follow up visit 
procedures - includes four follow up appointments at 1 week and 1, 6, and 12 months after the inje ction 
procedure (range from 1 -5 hours each, 1 2-15 hours total) ; and ( 4) follow up telephone interview at 24 
months  (about 20 -30 minutes).  The total maximum  number of hours is about [ADDRESS_264025] 
common alternative therapy for you.  
 
RISKS AND/OR DISCOMFORTS  
 
Your doctor will explain all the possible risks of the procedures associated with this study. The specific 
risks and discomforts for each test are described below.  As with any procedure, w hether it is 
investigational or approved, there may be risks which are unanticipated or unknown at this time.   
 
ECG  
It may be necessary to shave small areas of your chest to apply the adhesive patches.  You may 
experience slight discomfort when the adhesiv e patches are removed.  
 
Labs  
Risks associated with drawing blood from your arm include pain, bruising, site swelling, light -headedness 
and, on rare occasions, infection.   
 
Special note to women:  Being part of this study while pregnant may expose the unbor n child to 
significant risks, some of which may be currently unforeseeable.  Therefore, pregnant women will be 
excluded from the study.  If you are a wom an able to become pregnant, a pregnancy test will be done and 
it must be negative before you can contin ue in this study.  If sexually active, you must agree to use 
appropriate contraceptive measures while taking part in this study.  Medically acceptable contraceptives 
include: (1) surgical sterilization (such as tubal ligation or hysterectomy), 2) approved hormonal 
contraceptives (such as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patches, implants or injections), (3) barrier methods (such as a 
condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide, or (4) intrauterine device (IUD).  If you become pregnant 
while taking part in this study or  if you have unprotected se x, you must inform the study doctor 
immediately.  
 
Questionnaire  
Some of the questions on the questionnaire ask you to consider areas of your life which you may not 
commonly think about.  There are no physical risks from completin g the survey, but the questions could 
cause you concern or possibly emotional distress.

Exercise Testing ( Six minute walk test ) 
During this test, you may experience  epi[INVESTIGATOR_219735], fainting, chest discomfort, 
leg cramps, and very ra rely, heart attack.  
 
Stress Echocardiogram (NOT ALL PARTICIPANTS)  
 
Only participants who have no other available imaging in their recent medical history will have this test.  
This test simulates the how the heart works during exercise.  Due to that, you ma y feel a sense of extreme 
tiredness, temporary irregular heartbeat, dizziness, nausea, high blood pressure, chest pain, and in very 
rare circumstances heart attack.    
 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) procedure  
There may be mild to moderate risks and disc omforts with placement of an IV line, administration of 
medications, or the blood draw. The risks of starting an IV and drawing blood include pain, redness, 
minor bleeding, swelling, and bruising at the injection site.  Rarely , lightheadedness, fainting, a nd 
infection might happen.  The nurse will monitor you and appropriate treatments will be given if you 
develop any complications.  
 
You may feel uncomfortable or tired from lying down in the MRI machine.  You will be asked to hold 
your breath.  Each breath hold lasts about [ADDRESS_264026] a history of 
claustrophobia (feeling uncomfortable in small enclosed spaces), you may experience this during the 
MRI; as noted above, medication can be made available to help you relax. Administra tion of contrast dye 
may cause nausea, vomiting, or headache.  Allergic reactions to contrast dye are rare, but there are 
extremely rare instances of reactions causing death.   
 
The contrast dye used in the cMRI procedure is referred to as a gadolinium base d contrast agent 
(GBCAs).  After it is given, GBCAs leave the body mostly through the kidneys.   Recent medical papers 
report some deposits from GBCAs remain in the brains of some patients who have four or more contrast 
MRI scans, long after the last dose is received.     Recent studies conducted in humans and animals have 
confirmed that these deposits can remain in the brain, even in people with normal kidney function. It is 
unknown whether these deposits are harmful or can lead to adverse health effects.  Available information 
does not identify any adverse health effects.  However, this issue continues to be studied by [CONTACT_219748].  
 
The contrast dye may also induce kidney da mage or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a serious and 
potentially fatal disease that involves the skin, muscle , and internal organs. The risk of this is increased 
with patients who already had some evidence of kidney disease or diabetes, or are dehydr ated. In general, 
if a patient has normal kidney function, then the risks of kidney failure caused by [CONTACT_219749]. 
Your kidneys will be tested prior to any dye that would be given.  You should contact [CONTACT_219750], which include: Skin burning or itching, reddened or darkened patches 
and/or skin swelling, hardening and/or tightening; yellow raised spots on the whites of the eyes; joint 
stiffness, limited range of motion in the arms, hands, legs or feet; pain deep in the hip bone or ribs; and/or 
muscle weakness.  
 
There is no radiation (x -ray) exposure from MRIs.  There is a risk of heat injury from radiofrequency 
coils and the cables to the coil and monitoring equipment (heart monitor, oxygen monitor, etc.).  P lease 
report any heating or burning sensation immediately and the scan will be stopped.

Vsn 1. 5-06/01/17  Page 9 of 17 For those with pacemakers and ICDs:  Magnetic resonance imaging works by [CONTACT_57148] a strong 
magnetic field. Both pacemakers and ICDs are devices that contain wires wi th electrodes that are 
connected to one or more of your heart's chambers.  These are designed to restore normal rhythm to the 
heart by [CONTACT_219751].  It is important that you know that some, but not all, 
of these devices are approved by [CONTACT_219752] a MRI scanning environment.  Researchers have 
imaged hundreds of patients with such devices under careful monitoring without incident.   The 
investigators of this study have undergone training in these imaging techniques an d will follow the best 
safety practices from these researchers.  The powerful magnetic fields and radio waves that are part of 
MRI scans could cause the ICD wires to overheat , potentially damaging heart tissue. MRIs can induce 
unwanted currents that would e ither make the heart beat wildly, or in the case of ICDs, cause an 
unnecessary shock.    
Pacemakers and ICDs can be temporarily reprogrammed so they don’t react to an MRI’s magnetic field. 
Reprogramming a pacemaker or ICD can be done noninvasively through the skin with a wand like device. 
Pacemakers can be put into the “inhibited pacing mode,” which means the heartbeat has to get very slow 
before the device activates and starts helpi[INVESTIGATOR_219736]. The part of the ICD that senses a 
racing, irre gular heartbeat (tachycardia) is temporarily disabled.  
If you have a pacemaker/ICD, it will be monitored  during the MRI scan.  Theoretically, the MRI scan 
could interfere with , or possibly damage,  your pacemaker/ICD, but its functioning will be verified 
immediately after the procedure.  During the scan you  are at an increased risk of experiencing an 
arrhythmia, which could be life threatening or fatal (result in death).  A cardiologist or trained registered 
nurse with pacemaker/ICD expertise will check you r device before, during, and after the scan to ensure 
your safety.  Trained life support staff will be present and a crash cart (defibrillator) will be available 
during the procedure should you experience a life threatening arrhythmia.  The staff will keep  in contact 
[CONTACT_219753].  You will be monitored continuously during the 
scan.     
 
Cell Processing Procedure  
If you happen to receive the allo -MSC cell product, it is possible that your body might react and reject  the 
allo-MSC cells . Human clinical research studies with allo -MSCs in heart patients have provided evidence 
against the occurrence of rejection of the transplanted cells and also against the occurrence of graft versus 
host disease (GVHD), where healthy infused cells  recognize the tissues of the person receiving the cells 
as "foreign" and mount an immunologic attack . 
 
Processing the cells is done under strict sterile conditions; however, there is a rare chance that the cells 
could get contaminated while bei ng processed.   Testing will be done on the cells; however, it takes about 
[ADDRESS_264027] 
results are known.  
 
There may be some circumstances where we are unable to give you the processed cells; such as a 
proces sing failure or poor quality of the cells. If events such as these occur, you will not receive the allo -
MSC cells but  we will ask you to continue with follow up in the study as already discussed.   Processes in 
place to prevent these failures include: the u se of standard operating procedures for preparing the allo -
MSC cell product, which will identify any problems with the study product before it is release d, and 
continuous temperature monitoring of the product during shipment to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219737].

hollow tube) goes into your skin, a swelling filled with  blood (hematoma) under the skin, allergic 
reaction to the dye that is injected when the doctor looks at the heart vessels (angiography) either 
during or following the study product injection procedure, or formation of a blood clot (a blockage) at 
the place where the catheter goes into your skin. A blood clot could stop the flow of blood or hurt the 
blood vessel.  If blood flow is stopped or slowed a lot, the body parts that rely on that blood could also 
be damaged , which could lead to loss of function or surgical removal of the body part, or could 
worsen your heart condition and its symptoms.  Other problems that could happen because of this test 
are: local nerve damage (loss of feeling), infection, changes in the how your heart beats, stroke, and 
heart attack. Some temporary problems that might happen are : temporary movements (spasm) of a 
muscle, vein, or artery; pulling apart of blood vessel walls (separation of the layers of the walls of a 
blood vessel); or sudden blockage (closure) o f a blood vessel . A very rare complication could result in 
death or a need for an urgent coronary artery by[CONTACT_9292] (open heart surgery).  Serious 
complications , including death , happen in less than [ADDRESS_264028] underlying ki dney problems.  Your doctor  will 
measure your kidney function before this procedure to find out if your kidneys are working properly.   
 
The possible risks of NOGA mappi[INVESTIGATOR_209259], but are not limited to : damage to blood vessels, 
bleeding, infection, infla mmation of the sac surrounding the heart, damage to kidneys, a small risk of 
heart attack, stroke, damage to the heart valves, perforation (a small hole) in the heart causing blood to 
accumulate around the heart, irregular heartb eats (including ventricular  tachycardia and ventricular 
fibrillation),  possible ICD firing,  decreased blood pressure, dislodgement of material into other 
arteries leading to possible blockage, radiation exposure and a very small risk of death. You will 
receive some radiation as part  of the NOGA study (see the Radiation Risks Section below).  
 
Study Product In jection  
The catheter used to inject the study product is investigational (not yet approved for this use by [CONTACT_1556]). Some problems that might happen include (but others could occu r): decreased blood pressure, 
irregular heartbeats, possible firing of ICD, chest pain or discomfort, damage to the heart muscle, 
perforation of the heart causing blood to accumulate around the heart, bleeding, heart attack, stroke, 
dislodgement of materia l into other arteries (possibly causing blockage), need for emergency surgery 
such as coronary re -vascularization, and death.  It is possible that a small amount of cells will enter the 
bloodstream of the heart rather than the heart muscle.  If the injecti on catheter penetrates through the 
heart (from inside to outside) and cells appear in the fluid filled area surrounding your heart, which

which could c ause an inflammatory response.  Injection directly into the heart muscle also may cause 
inflammation or irritability.  Your medical team will closely monitor you to minimize the chance of 
any problems occurring during the procedure.   
   
Radiation Risks  
The mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/injection procedure  involves exposure to radiation, which is in addition to what you may 
receive as part of your standard care. The benefit from the radiation you receive for your standard care 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_219741]; 
however, the additional radiation “dose” you receive for research purposes may not benefit you 
personally. There are  established annual radiation dose limits for both individuals who work with 
radiation (e.g. x -ray technologists, radiologists, etc.) and those participating in research studies. The 
additional radiation dose you will receive from participating in this study is less than either of those 
limits.  
 
Radiation has been shown to cause cancer and/or leukem ia from doses that are significantly higher 
than the additional annual radiation dose you will receive by [CONTACT_4907]. According to 
the Health Physics Society (an international organization that specializes in radiation protection), the 
increased risk of health effects (i.e. cancer and/or leukemia) from radiation doses of this amount is 
either too small to be observed or nonexistent in a normal population. While there is no evidence that 
any risk exists for humans exposed to such low levels,  it is assumed that the risks rise with lifetime 
accumulated dose from all sources of ionizing radiation, including the doses you receive from medical 
procedures and the environment. You should also be aware that everyone’s sensitivity to radiation is 
not the same and some diseases (e.g. genetic diseases, diseases affecting DNA repair, and immune 
diseases such as HIV) may make you more sensitive to the effects and consequences of the radiation 
exposure than the normal population. Finally, you should know th at even if there is an increased risk 
of an effect, it could be [ADDRESS_264029] would actually occur. Thus, you may want to 
factor in your age, overall health, and the number of medical radiation procedures that you’ve had 
when determining if this risk is acceptable to you. The calculated effective dose resulting from your 
participation in this study is available upon request . 
 
Risks That Are Not Known  
Because cell therapy treatment is investigational, that is  not FDA approved, there may be risks that we do 
not know about at this time.  There are no long -term safety data available.  If we discover new risk 
information during the study, we will share this information with you.   
Participation in more than one research study or project may furt her increase the risk to you.  If you are 
already enrolled in a research study, please tell the person reviewing this consent with you before 
enrolling in this or any other research study or project.  
 
BENEFITS  
 
It is not known whether this procedure is ben eficial. It may improve the way your heart muscle function s. 
This may also help with daily activities (e.g. walking for longer periods without symptoms) which may 
improve the quality of your daily life. T he information gained from the research study will h elp answer 
these questions, not only for you but, for the general population. It  is also possible that you may not 
receive any direct benefit from this research study.  The information learned  in this research study may 
help researchers better understand how safe it is to use stem cells in the heart and may help  advance  
medical knowledge  in general .

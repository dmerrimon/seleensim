BACKGROUND:    
Recently, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15816], opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related fatalities, and overall 
economic burden of treating the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817].  The prescribing patterns of opi[INVESTIGATOR_15818] e pain 
management strategies that have limited opi[INVESTIGATOR_15819].  As orthopaedic surgeons 
account for 7.7% of all dispensed opi[INVESTIGATOR_15820], surgeons have 
investigated multimodal pain management strategies to assess effectiveness in controlling 
postoperative pain as well as limiting opi[INVESTIGATOR_15821].  Currently, 
there remains no clear consensus on the ideal pain management strategy following shoulder 
arthroplasty and the vast majority of strategies are based on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] -driven protocols.  We are  
investigat ing the effectiveness of a n opi[INVESTIGATOR_15822] 
[ADDRESS_15095] c old therapy2,3.  Additionally  we anticipate patients 
randomized to continuous circulating flow cryotherapy multimodal opi[INVESTIGATOR_15823] a 
significantly lower number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]4.  
 
The protection of our patient’s safety and welfare has prompted this investigation.  We believe 
that minimizing a patient’s exposure to opi[INVESTIGATOR_15824], 
nausea, vomiting, constipation, and most significantly, opi[INVESTIGATOR_15825].    
 
PURPOSE:  
To investigate the difference in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores between two protocols 
following shoulder arthroplasty at the 2 week postoperative time point.  The differences 
between opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], postoperative pain scores,  patient satisfaction, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] -of-
care factors (reoperations, readmission, and complications)  will be evaluated at the 12 week 
(90-day) postoperative time point. The two protocols are:  
 
Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Trial of An Opi[INVESTIGATOR_15813] -Based Protocol Following Shoulder Arthroplasty  
 
Version 1. 4 dated January 28 , 2021  Page 2 Group 1  (opi[INVESTIGATOR_15826]) -a multimodal  postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_15827] 2 (opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] -based protocol) -a standard postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] -based pain management 
protocol including standard cold therapy . 
 
HYPOTHESIS:  
A multimodal postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_15828] (Group 1) will be non-inferior  in the [ADDRESS_15096] cold therapy (Group 2).   
 
STUDY DESIGN /DURATION :   
This is a single center, investigator initiated, p rospective, randomized, controlled trial  
conducted among subjects who have given volu ntary consent to participate.  Participation will 
last until the completion of the [ADDRESS_15097] for 2 years . Randomization will occur following signing of the informed consent document.  
No parties i nvolved in the study will be blinded to randomization assignment.  
 
STUDY SETTING:  
Preoperative and postoperative office visits will be conducted at Campbell Clinic Collierville 
([ADDRESS_15098]., Ste. 100, Collierville, TN  [ZIP_CODE]) or Germantown Office ( [ADDRESS_15099]., Germantown, TN  [ZIP_CODE]).  Perioperative care will be conducted at Baptist 
Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -Collierville ([ADDRESS_15100]., Collierville, TN  [ZIP_CODE] ). 
 
SAMPLE SIZE:    
76 subjects  with 1:1 randomization  (38 in opi[INVESTIGATOR_15829] 38  in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] -based)  to account for 
a 20% lost to follow -up.  Group sample sizes of 31 will achieve minimum 80% power to detect a 
one-sided non -inferiority margin of 2 on the VAS scale, where the true difference is assumed to 
be 0, the significance level (alp ha) is set at 5%, and data are drawn from populations with 
standard deviations of 3. The standard deviations of [ADDRESS_15101] comparing the two groups will be allowed  to be 
conducted per The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products Evaluation of 
Medicines for Human Use.6 
 
PRIMARY OUTCOME:  
Primary outcome measure will be VAS pain sc ale at [ADDRESS_15102] 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] -Based Protocol Following Shoulder Arthroplasty  
 
Version 1. 4 dated January 28 , 2021  Page 3  
SECONDARY OUTCOME:  
The secondary outcome measure will be Oral Morphine Equivalents (OME) which will be 
collected  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15830],  POD #[ADDRESS_15103] a superiority analysis comparing OME between the two groups.  Using the observed 
24-hour median difference of 16mg OME observed between the acetaminophen+ibuprofen 
(median=20mg) and ac etaminophen only (median=36mg) group s in the Thybo paper7, along 
with the provided standard deviations of 20mg, a sample size of 26 in each group will achieve 
minimum 80% power using an a lpha of 5%.  Therefore, this secondary endpoint s hould be 
adequately p owered with the planned sample size of [ADDRESS_15104] s in each group.

Version 1. 4 dated January 28 , 2021  Page 7 BENEFITS:  
There are no promises of benefits to taking part in this research.  However, it is possible that 
postoperative pain can be controlled with minimal or no opi[INVESTIGATOR_15834].  
 
RISKS:  
Randomization will expose the subjects to the specific risk associated with either of the 
medication  regimens laid out in this  protocol.  All medications included in the protocol are 
approved by [CONTACT_15847] ( FDA).  The most common side effects of each 
medication (and the continuous circulating flow cryotherapy if applicable) will be 
communicated in the informed consent document.  
 
There is a rare risk of bowel perforation resulting from constipation with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] .  This 
information has been added to the ICF and a bowel regimen was prescribed with discharge 
medications.  
 
A subject may experience uncomfortable or troublesome feelings in conjunction with 
completion of the home diary . 
 
Loss of confidentiality is a pot ential risk.   
 
RISK MINIMIZATION PLAN:  
1. Subject selection based upon inclusion/exclusion criteria to safeguard enrollment of 
medically cleared patients.  
2. A detailed disclosure of the  side effects of each medication is communicated to the 
Subject in the cons ent form.  
3. Emergency contact [CONTACT_4490] a Campbell Clinic Physician 24 hour/[ADDRESS_15107] fourteen (14) days following surger y, the subject will be grouped 
into the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] -based group for analysis of VAS score.  
6. The information requested in the home diary is the minimum required to evaluate study 
outcomes.  
7. All paper and electronic research records are securely stored and accessib le only to 
study personnel.  
SUBECT STIPENDS:  
Subjects will receive a $[ADDRESS_15108] at completion of the 2 week office visit and a $[ADDRESS_15109]

studies conducted at Campbell Clinic.  
  
 
PROTECTION OF PRIVATE HEALTH INFORMATION (PHI):  
Multiple layers of security will be in place to insure protection of confidential information.  All 
paper records will  be locked in the Research Office at Campbell Clinic.  Electronic records will be 
stored within the Campbell Clinic secure server.  Only authorized study team members will have 
access to paper and/or electronic study records.  
 
OPERATIONAL  OVERSIGHT/SAFETY MONITORING:  
All adverse events will be monitored by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_15835].  Appropriate treatment will be give n to protect the rights 
and welfare of all subjects.  
 
PREM ATURE WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS:  
A subject may withdraw his/her consent through a verbal request or by [CONTACT_5583] a letter to the 
Principal Investigator.  This information is included in the informed consent document.  
Participation is voluntary.  Early withdraw al from the study does not result in a  loss of rights or 
privileges.  
 
A subject may  be withdrawn by [CONTACT_15848]/her consent if he/she does not 
show up for visits or does not follow the physician’s instruction.

STATI STICAL ANALYSIS:  
Statistical methodology will consist of summarizing collected data descriptively using 
percentages (numerator/denominator) for categorical outcomes, and means, medians, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum  for continuous variables  over the [ADDRESS_15112].  Return to function using established outcome assessment tools will be used to 
compare the two groups using parametric or nonparametric methods, as appropriate .

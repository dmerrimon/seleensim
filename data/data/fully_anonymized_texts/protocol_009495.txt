 Introduction:  
Obesity prevalence continues to increase worldwide2 and, in the [LOCATION_002], 69% of adults are overweight or 
with obesity3. Estimated costs to the healthcare system are more than $[ADDRESS_1056328] a 22% reduction (13 years) in life expectancy.  
Obesity is defined as the amount of excess of adipose tissue at which health risks increase5. Normal weight, overweight 
and obesity can be measured by [CONTACT_296306] (BMI). BMI is calculated  by [CONTACT_8497] (kg) divided by [CONTACT_769915] (m2). The BMI for an adult healthy weight is from 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2, overweight is from 25 to 29.9 kg/m2 and 
obese is 30 kg/m2 or above. Obesity is considered morbid or severe when BMI is higher than 40 kg/m2  (Guidelines 1998).  
In children, obesity is measured as BMI higher than the 95th percentile related to their age and sex  6,7. Obesity can also 
be measured by [CONTACT_769916] [ADDRESS_1056329] 
circumference are associated with hea lth risks and obesity –related co -morbidities.  
The Obesity Epi[INVESTIGATOR_901] : Obesity has reached epi[INVESTIGATOR_769901]  7. In the [LOCATION_002] of America ([LOCATION_003]), the prevalence  of overweight  adults  is 64% , and obese 
adults  is 30.5%  8. In children and adolescents , the obesity prevalence has increased to 17.1%  6. The World Health 
Organization indicated that globally , in the year 2005 , there were approximately 1.6 billion overweight adults, and of 
those, 400 million were obese  9.  This alarming obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_769902] a heavy burden to the U.S. economy, costing 
more t han $150 billion every year —10 percent of the total health budget —according to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC  2012 ). In 2009, the  U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  reported that overweight and 
obese people spend [ADDRESS_1056330] normal weight  10. 
Treatment for obesity:  
The [ADDRESS_1056331] that to achieve weight loss, an energy deficit is essential. Reducing dietary energy  
intake below that required for energy balance can be achieved through a reduction of daily calories to 1200 -1500 for 
women, and 1,500 -1800 for men (kilocalorie levels are usually adjusted for the individual’s body weight and physical 
activity levels); or estimation of individual daily energy requirements and prescription of an energy deficit of 500 kcal/d 
or 750 kcal/d. Recommendations for young children through adolescence vary in order to support normal growth and 
development occurring during these years .  The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Evidence Analysis Library 
recommends no fewer than 900 kcal/day for 6 -12 year olds who are medically monitored and no fewer than 1200 
kcal/day for 13 -18 year olds (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Weight Manageme nt Position Paper which provides an 
overview of a nutrition assessment: http://www.eatrightpro.org/resource/practice/position -and-practice -
papers/position -papers/weight -management).  Evidence supports greatest long -term success with an individualized, 
structured meal plan in place. A registered dietitian nutritionist can play an important role in designing the nutrition 
intervention tailored to address each patient’s unique needs and circumstances, taking into consideration factors such 
as insulin resistanc e. Any diet program that meets this required energy deficit is appropriate to adopt, and comparative 
trials have shown no long -term superiority between different macronutrient composition or elimination diets. 
Furthermore, it is important to adhere to a ba lanced diet that provides a variety of items from all food groups and limits 
potentially harmful food ingredients like added sugars, sodium and alcohol. Additionally, guidelines recommend limiting 
or avoiding liquid calories (i.e. sodas, juices, alcohol, e tc.). And, finally, the meal plan should be designed in such a way 
that the individual is likely to follow it.  
Along with the prescription for a reduced calorie diet, a comprehensive lifestyle intervention program should prescribe 
increased aerobic physica l activity (such as brisk walking) for ≥150 min/week (equal to ≥30 min/d most days of the 
week), and a goal of >10,000 steps per day. Higher levels of physical activity, approximately 200 to 300 min/wk., are 
recommended to maintain the weight lost or minim ize weight regain in the long term (>1 year) 11. The diet and physical 
activity can be in combination with a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/university or commercial behavior program; these are comprehensive 
 
Page [ADDRESS_1056332] weight, with the addition of frequent (i.e., 
weekly or more frequent) monitoring of body weight12. 
Pharmacotherapy  
In addition to diet, exercise and behavioral modification, pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_769903]. They 
should also be considered in  people whose history or clinical circumstances require expedited weight loss. Medication 
should not be used alone, but in combination with an intensive lifestyle program.  
Pharmacotherapy for the treatment of obesity can be considered if a patient has a bo dy mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 or 
a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 with weight -related co -morbidities such as hypertension, type [ADDRESS_1056333] prescribing 
sympathomimetic agents such as phentermine and phentermine/topi[INVESTIGATOR_298726] (ER).  Lorcaserin and 
orlistat are safer alternatives .  In patients with T2DM, the guidelines suggest antidiabetic agents that promote weight 
loss such as glucagon -like peptide (GLP -1) analogs which reduce hyperglycemia in addition to the first -line agent for 
T2DM, metformin13.

 Phentermine -Topi[INVESTIGATOR_298727]:  When low -dose, controlled -release, phentermine was combined with 
the glutamatergic and GABA -ergic  antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_298728] a large 
phase III study (more than 1400 participants on treatment arms with 
different doses), subjects lost 10.2 kg on  15/[ADDRESS_1056334] common 
adverse events were dry mo uth, paresthesias, constipation, insomnia, 
dizziness, and dysgeusia. Depression - and anxiety -related adverse 
events were also observed. The medication had favorable effects on 
glycemia, including prevent progression to diabetes, improvements in 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], blo od pressure, sleep apnea, and quality of life measures. There 
was also, as previously noted, a small but consistent increase in pulse 
rate 21. The overall rate of adverse effects decreased in weeks 56 –108 
compared to weeks 0 –56; among which dry mouth, constip ation and 
paresthesias were the most prevalent There were 19 pregnancies 
carried to term during these studies none of which resulted in 
congenital abnormalities 21-23. 
In July 2012, the FDA voted for approval of phentermine (3.75 –15mg/d) plus extended release topi[INVESTIGATOR_237511] (23 –92mg/d) 
as an adjunct to diet and physical activity for treatment of obesity among adult individuals with BMI≥30kg/m2 or 
BMI≥27kg/m2 with at least one obesity -related comorbid condition. The drug will carry a warning of potential increased 
risk for orofacial clefts in neonates exposed to topi[INVESTIGATOR_298729] a 
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) that will restrict prescribing to trained clinicians, will require effective 
contraception an d monthly pregnancy tests for reproductive age women, and will restrict dispensing to specific mail -
order pharmacies. The company is also required to carry a long -term cardiovascular outcomes trial. No randomized 
pediatric studies have as yet been reported . Noteworthy, the high dose of PhenTop was associated with a mean weight 
loss of 9.8%; however, only 48% of patients lost >10% of their body weight, and 30% of patients lost <5% of their body 
weight  (Figure 1) .  
 
Wearable Activity Trackers  
Consumer -based wearable activity trackers are now readily available and can provide individuals with the ability to 
objectively monitor their physical activity levels. In addition, when combined with the use of smartphone and computer 
apps, they may assist users through a range of motivational and tracking tools to better manage their personal health24. 
In addition to providing real -time feedback relating to daily steps and energy expenditure, consumer -based wearable 
activity trackers have the potential to provide specific, tailored feedback through specifically designed  algorithms or by 
[CONTACT_201329]. This type of emerging technology may provide an alternative means of providing ongoing support 
and motivation to individuals both looking to increase their activity levels or to maintain activity levels following a 
structured lifestyle intervention25. Moreover, consumer -based wearable activity trackers may assist in reducing the 
resourc e and time burden associated with traditional methods of providing ongoing support. Randomized controlled 
trials have shown that these devices have promise in relation to increasing physical activity participation26,27; however, 
participant numbers in individual studies tend to be low, making it difficult to adequately assess the benefits of these 
devices. Furthermore, there is limited research relating to their long -term adherence and effec tiveness.   
A recent systematic review28 of that aimed to determine the effects of interventions utilizing consumer -based wearable 
activity trackers on physical activity participation and sedentary behavior when compared with in terventions that do not 
utilize activity tracker feedback, showed that t here was a significant increase in daily step count (standardized mean 
difference [SMD] 0.24; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.33;  P<.001), moderate and vigorous physical activity (SMD 0.27; 95% CI 0. [ADDRESS_1056335] 5% and at least 10% weight loss.  1

 0.39;  P<.001), and energy expenditure (SMD 0.28; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.54;  P=.03) and a nonsignificant decrease in sedentary 
behavior (SMD −0.20; 95% CI −0.43 to 0.03;  P=.08) following the intervention versus control comparator across all 
studies in the m eta-analyses. In general, included studies were at low risk of bias, except for performance bias. 
Heterogeneity varied across the included meta -analyses ranging from low (I2=3%) for daily step count through to high 
(I2=67%) for sedentary behavior.  Utilizin g a consumer -based wearable activity tracker as either the primary component 
of an intervention or as part of a broader physical activity intervention has the potential to increase physical activity 
participation. As the effects of physical activity interv entions are often short term, the inclusion of a consumer -based 
wearable activity tracker may provide an effective tool to assist health professionals to provide ongoing monitoring and 
support28. 
Online support system:  VitalCar e (VitalTech Affiliates LLC)  is a digital health platform that allows remote collection of 
date from the wearable tracker and digital wellness devices used as part of this study.  It also will allow subjects to 
document study medication compliance and will  allow the remote visits to be conducted through a video conference 
between subjects and appropriate study team members.  
 
 
FDA-approved medications, devices and surgeries have shown long -term improvements in obesity and diabetes, 
however, their use (population penetrance) remains low  (less than 1% market use) . On the contrary, and despi[INVESTIGATOR_769904], n umerous  wearable  technologies specific to physical activity and diet are widely 
adopted with minimal long -term data or benef its. Little is known about the effect anti-obesity pharmacotherapy among 
patients undergoing lifestyle intervention that includes  a consumer -based wearable activity tracker.

Randomization and Allocation  
A computer generated randomization schedule generated by [CONTACT_4305]’s office will be submitted to the Mayo 
Clinic CCaTS Research Pharmacy. Randomization will be based on guidi ng pharmacotherapy or placebo . Allocations will 
be concealed. This study will be blinded until data are transmitted to the statistician for data lock. All subjects will be g iven 
a verbal explanation of the study, provided time to read and study the written  consent form and its information, given 
opportunities to ask questions and a copy of the consent form.  Participants will be informed of their right to withdraw 
from the study at any time without prejudice to their clinical management now or in the future . Consent will be sought by 
[CONTACT_769917], and consent will be documented by [CONTACT_2299]’s 
signature [CONTACT_75288]. Mayo’s Institutional Review Board will approve the process and protocol. All th e members 
of multidisciplinary team for weight management (i.e. physicians, coordinators, clinical assistants, registered dietitians wi ll 
remain blinded).  
 
If unblinding is needed for subject safety the Principal Investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a Co -Invest igator will con tact a research P harmacist 
or the research pharmacy manager and provide documentation of reason for study unblinding  and the subject will be 
withdrawn from the study .  The study team will document and report the reason for unblinding as required by [CONTACT_299781] o 
Clinic IRB . 
 
Selection Participants  
 We plan to study a cohort of 80 patients with obesity (BMI>30 kg/m2). Participants will be recruited from the 
Mayo Clinic Weight Management and Nutrition Clinic , media advertising , classified ads, and existing databases of 
patients with obesity , including the phenome registry  (Mayo Clinic IRB number ), the Mayo Clinic biobank and

Baseline Characteristic studies:  
All participants will complete the baseline assessment at the Mayo Clinic after an 8 -hour fasting period, and the 
following characteristics will be measured at baseline: Fasting blood collection, body composition, resting energy 
expenditure, gastric emptying with meal for breakfast, behavioral questionnaires, exercise cap acity and performance 
and buffet meal test for lunch. Blood will be collected  for assessment of metabolomic biomarkers, gastrointestinal 
hormones, DNA (blood ). Stool samples for microbiome and bile acid. Participants will return to the CRTU to pi[INVESTIGATOR_769908] , the wearable activity tracker and the digital wellness devices .  
 
If participants have already completed the baseline assessment at the Mayo Clinic within the last 3 years, those 
participants will not need to complete the  full baseline assessment. Participants will complete the baseline assessment 
at the Mayo Clinic after an 8 -hour fasting period again, but only the following characteristics will be measured at 
baseline: Fasting blood collection and body composition. Blood  will be collected for assessment of metabolomics 
biomarkers, gastrointestinal hormones, DNA (blood). Stool samples for microbiome and bile acid. Participants will return 
to the CRTU to pi[INVESTIGATOR_769909], the wearable activity t racker, and the digital wellness 
devices.  
 
Methods of metabolic studies  
 
a) Body composition  will be measured by [CONTACT_112592] ( dual energy x -ray absorptiometry).  
b) Resting energy expenditure  was assessed by [CONTACT_298777] a ventilated hood (Parvo Medics, Sandy, 
UT). 
c) Gastric emptying (GE) of solids by [CONTACT_298754]: The primary endpoint is gastric half -emptying time (GE t 1/2) [3, 
33, 34].  Images will be acquired at 0, 60, 120 and 240 minutes following th e normal clinical gastric 
emptying testing protocol  without a push meal . 
d) Appetite  (hunger level) by [CONTACT_298778] [3]. 
e) Satiation  will be measure b y ad-libitum  buffet meal to measure total caloric intake and macronutrient 
distribution in the chosen food. Satiation will be reported in calories consumed at fullness (satiation) [3]. 
f) Satiety by [CONTACT_769919] f or GE and after to the ad-libitum  buffet meal 
test for every 30 minutes for 2 hours [3]. Satiety will be measured in  length of time of fullness.  
g) Samples collection, handling and storage: Samples will be  collected after an overnight fast (of at least 8 hours) in 
the morning. Plasma w ill be  preserved following standard guidelines and protein degradation inhibitors, 
kalikr ein and DPP -IV inhibitors w ill be  added to preserve the samples. Samples will be  stored at -80ºC in the PI’s 
laboratory. Fasting samples will be collected and measure on subsequent visits (every 3 months).  
a. Fasting Blood  will be collected for basic metabol ic panel, lipid panel, HbA1C, hsCRP  
 
Page 15 of 21 
 b. Plasma hormones and proteomics  by [CONTACT_769920]/or mass spectrometry measured fasting, 
and postprandial 15 , 45,  and 90 minutes, with the primary endpoint being the peak postprandial level 
(test should be done simultaneously to GE). At the end of study visit (Visit 8) , this will be drawn once and 
not at intervals.  
c. Targeted Metabolomics :  We will perform quantitative , targeted metabolomics of salient classes of 
compounds in plasma  samples using mass spectrometry.  
d. Blood DNA  for genome wide association studies  (GWAS ) 
e. Stool  will be collected and stored to study microbiome, short chain fatty acids and bile acids.  
h) Self-administered questionnaires  assessing affect, physical activity levels, attitudes, body image, diet, and eating 
behavior; details of each questionnaire are provided below. Participants will complete a series of questionnaires .  
a) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_769910]: HADS will be used to screen for severe anxiety or depression.   
b) AUDIT -C Alcoholism Screening Test  (33) - The AUDIT -C is a [ADDRESS_1056340] active alcohol use disorders. This 
score will be used in screening by [CONTACT_229493]/nurse coordinator. The AUDIT -C is scored on a scale of 
0-12. Each AUDIT -C question has 5 answer choices. Points allotted are: a=0 points; b=1 point; c=2 points; 
d=3 points; e=4 points. In men, a score of 4 or more is considered positive, optimal for  identifying hazardous 
drinking or active alcohol use disorders. In women, a score of 3 or more is considered positive (same as 
above).   
c) Eating Disorders Questionnaire  - The Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns -Revised (34), is a valid 
measure of screening for eating disorders which has been used in several national multi -site field trials. 
Respondents are classified as binge eating disorder, purging bulimia nervosa, non -purging bulimia nervosa, 
or anorexia nervosa. We have used this instrument to screen for eating disorders in obese populations.  
d) Three Factor eating q uestionnaire  is 21 -item questionnaire, validated, to assess for emotional eating 
disorders and food cravings.  
e) Physical Activity Level  - The four -item Physical Activity Stages of Change Questionnaire (38)will be utilized to 
assess the physical activity level of partici pants. Mayo Clinic investigators, led by [CONTACT_3252] -investigator [CONTACT_102779], 
have used these items to explore the relationship between quality of life and physical activity in an NCI -
funded study on long -term lung cancer survivors (38). 
f) Exercise behavior - The Exercise Regulatio ns Questionnaire (BREQ -3)(39) and its subsequent modifications 
have become the most widely used measures of the continuum of behavioural regulation in exercise 
psychology research. It has been used either as a multidimensional instrument giving separate scores for 
each subscale, or as a unidimensional index of the degree  of self -determination.  
g) SF-12v2 - a common questionnaire used to measure quality of life  
h) STOP -BANG - questionnaire used to screen for obstructive sleep apnea  
i) WOMAC - questionnaire used to assess osteoarthritis of the knee and hip  
 
Intense Lifestyle Intervention and Behavioral Treatment

Subjects in the study will be provided and a wireless scale, automated blood pressure cuff a nd pulse oximeter.   These 
digital wellness devices will be connected by [CONTACT_769922]’s personal Apple iPhone.  
Subjects will be allowed to keep the wearable  activity  track er and the digital wellness devices if they complete the study .  
Subjects who withdraw from the study or are withdrawn from the study will be asked to return the  digital  wellness  
devices.   Subjects will also be provided with a backpack to transport the wellness devices.  
Virtual Care:   
As part of the study subjects wi ll be asked to download the VitalCare (VitalTech Affiliates LLC) application to the subject’s 
personal Apple iPhone from the Apple App Store.  This application will allow the study team to conduct the remote 
study visits.  The application will also be used  to monitor subject compliance with taking the study medication and to 
send reminders to the subject to take the study medication. Additionally this application will record the measurements 
collected by [CONTACT_769923].   The study subjects will not  be 
require d to use the digital  wellness  devices at any set time points , but it will be encouraged .  The digital wellness devices 
will be used at the subject’s discretion.  Any measurements recorde d by [CONTACT_769924]’s  study visits, either in person visits or remote visits.  Study team will not 
monitor the use or results of this study until the next schedule visit or until the p articipant brings it to our attention.  
Medication  
Medication Phentermine -Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237591] e Extended Release and matching placebo will be provide  by [CONTACT_769925], Inc ([LOCATION_004], 
US). See FDA drug information package.  
Pregnancy Testing  
 
Urine pregnancy testing will be  done at visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8  for women of child bearing potential (WOCBP).  
Subjects who are WOCBP will be given urine pregnancy test kits  (QuickVue+ hCG Combo Test (Quidel Corporation) or 
similar) along with instructions  to complete at home.  Subjects will be instructed to complete these home pregnancy test 
kits and report the results during the remote study visits with the study team.   If a subject has a positive urine pregnancy 
test result  at any time  the subject will be withdrawn from the study and instructed to stop use of the st udy 
medication/placebo immediately.  The subject will be given a referral to their primary care provider.  
Statistical Considerations  
 
Primary endpoint:  Total body weight loss at 3 months  
 
Secondary endpoints:  
- Total body wei ght loss at  6, 9 and 12 months  
- number of steps (average per week at 3, 6, 9 a nd 12 months)  
- calories tracked: number times recorded, calories per day (average per week at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months ) 
- number of exercise sessions (average per week at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months ) 
 
Page 17 of 21 
 - hours/week usin g app/tracker (average per week at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months)  
- weight loss difference in clinic vs. Bluetooth scal e (weight loss difference 3, 6 , 9 and 12 months ) 
- Quality of life SF36 (at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months ) 
- improvement in obesity -related comorbidities (diab etes/HbA1c, hypertension/SBP -DBP, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]/TC -LDL-
HDL-Tg, Sleep a pnea/CPAP, Joint Disease/pain)  
 
Design : We propose a randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled trial of 80 participants with obesity to compare 
effects of Phentermine -topi[INVESTIGATOR_769911] 1 year follow up . 
 
Sample size assessment and power calculation:  In our recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] [with Liraglutide 3.0 mg vs. placebo], the 
standard deviat ion (SD) for the overall weight change (pre -post  at12 weeks ) observed was 2.8kg [32] and observed 
weight loss in the control/placebo group was 6.1kg .  
 
Conservatively assuming a standard deviation of 3kg within groups,  
 
Difference to 
Detect (kg) – 
reflects greater 
weight loss in 
active arm vs 
placebo  Sample Size per 
group  TOTAL Sample Size  With 10% dropout 
at 3 months  With 15% dropout 
at 3 months  With 20% dropout 
at 3 months  
1kg (ex: 7 .1 vs 6.1)  143 286 318 338 358 
1.5kg  64 128 142 152 160 
2 kg 37 74 82 88 94 
 
Actual power is anticipated to be higher when accounting for baseline weight using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) 
methods.  
 
 
 
Statistical Analysis:  
The primary analysis will be conducted under intention to treat (ITT) principles.  Since study drug is administered double -
blind, all subjects taking at least one dose of study drug will be included in analyses.  
Primary endpoi nt: The primary endpoint is we ight at 3 months (12 week visit), compared between groups using Analysis 
of Covariance ( ANCOVA ), adjusted for baseline weight.  Subjects without follow up (dropouts) will have  values imputed 
using multiple imputation.  This approach assumes the distributio n of missing data is random after conditioning on 
observed data in the imputation process.  A secondary approach will consider complete case data, though this does not 
generally adhere to ITT principles.  
Weight is recorded longitudinally at several post -baseline timepoints.  A secondary analysis will model these longitudinal 
data using linear mixed effects models, adjusted for baseline weight.  Additional adjustment variables will be included 
based on a priori  determination by [CONTACT_769926].  Thus, 
any dropout is assumed Missing At Random as a function of observed data.  Time after randomization will be included as 
a discrete ordinal variable corresponding to the visit number.  The primary compar ison is a time by [CONTACT_769927], so that contrasts of the variables in the model will allow estimation of the treatment effect at each visit.  
An interim analysis will be performed after 50% of subjects have completed their 3 month visit.  Thi s will allow the study 
team to review data quality and check assumptions related to the power calculation (including the standard deviation 
 
Page 18 of 21 
 above).  Investigators will remain blinded to group comparisons and w hile investigators have no intention of stoppin g 
the study early (regardless of interim results), the analysis at study completion will be  conservatively  adjusted using the 
O’Brien -Fleming boundary (two -sided significance level of 0.0492).  
Secondary endpoints will be assessed similarly.  Steps, calorie s, and hours using the app tracker will be collected by [CONTACT_133238].  These will be aggregated to a weekly total or daily average over the week -long period to smooth out day -to-day 
variation.  Analyses will be performed using linear mixed effects models wit h these weekly total data, separately for 
each endpoint.  Weight loss as recorded by [CONTACT_769928], taking the average of 
assessments over the course of each week as the outcome [recall, the primary endpoint is weig ht loss measured in clinic 
at study visits].  Number of exercise sessions will be evaluated, also as a weekly total number of sessions, using 
generalized linear mixed effects models with the outcome analyzed as a Poisson count.  The distribution of each 
outcome will be assessed and alternative approaches considered as necessary.  Quality of Life questionnaires will be 
assessed at study visits and analyzed using linear mixed effects models to compare between groups.  The primary 
outcome has been pre -specifie d and no adjustment will be made for comparisons of these secondary outcomes.  
An exploratory aim will evaluate adherent vs non -adherent patients – and further the interaction between adherent (vs 
non-adherent) and randomized group, to assess whether there  is a differential response to Phentermine -Topi[INVESTIGATOR_769912].   Adherence will be defined by 80% use during the first 3 months.   
Anticipated results and significance:   
Our study will demonstrate the importance of combining a consumer -based wearable activity tracker with an Anti -
obesity Pharmacotherapy in Obesity.  
 
Potential pi[INVESTIGATOR_30207], precautions taken, and alternative strategies:  
a. Feasibility  - Given high volume of patients interested in weight loss, we are confident we will recruit sufficient 
participants for these studies that involve only noninvasive tests and standard of care treatment.  
b. Statistical power  has been addressed with appropriate  sample sizes to demonstrate a difference in weight change 
vs. placebo.

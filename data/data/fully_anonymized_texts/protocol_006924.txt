 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Background  and Rationale  
 
Currently, the [LOCATION_002] ( US) has far more confirmed COVID -19 cases than any other country. 
The US epi[INVESTIGATOR_614614], with many cities and communities experiencing a 
disproportionately high disease burden and mortality. For example, at present, Minneapolis, Houston , 
Atlanta, and Durham NC , are projected to bear  the brunt of the US epi[INVESTIGATOR_614615], other 
communities may see an increase in the number of COVID -19 cases.  
 
There is an urgent need to address th e COVID -19 pandemic in a multipronged, expeditious manner to 
identify effective interventions for COVID -19 treatment and prevention. The National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has therefore mobilized its major research networks  under 
the banne r of the COVID -19 Prevention Network (CoVPN)  to work together in the rapid evaluation of 
COVID -[ADDRESS_815069] and the Infectious 
Diseases Clinical Research Consortium (IDCRC), will accelerate recruitment, diversify the trial 
cohort s, and build capacity for the conduct of fu ture COVID -19 treatment and prevention studies. In 
this protocol, the terms “clinical research site (CRS)” and “research site” and “site” refer to clinical 
research sites from selected  NIAID networks and “community” refers to the geographic area 
surroundin g each CRS.   
 
The COVID -19 pandemic is evolving, with diverse and dynamic impacts in different regions and 
populations in the US Over the coming months and years, it is likely that different communities will 
experience the epi[INVESTIGATOR_614616], wit h resurgence in other communities. The beginning of 
the US epi[INVESTIGATOR_614617] a nursing home near Seattle, Washington  (1) and 
nursing homes in many other states have had similarly tragic experiences with extremely high 
incidence and mortality rates  (2). The nursing home outbreaks reflect the observation, now noted in 
multiple settings  (2), that COVID -19 is more likely to present as a severe infection among those over 
the age of 65 and those with medical co -morbidities (3) and mortality rates are approximately ten 
times higher for these groups, even among those not living in a skilled nursing facility. These 
morbidity and mortality patterns among older individuals with medical conditions underscore the 
importance of treatment a nd prevention interventions tailored to this population. A ccurate and detailed 
estimates of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_815070] substantially higher attack rates and 
higher mortality compared with any other racial or ethnic group (4) across  the US The communities 
surrounding several NIAID CRSs have suffered from not only longstanding racial inequalities, but 
also socioeconomic disparities in housing and  employment, as well as varied access to health and other 
essential services. These populations also have a high prevalence of co -morbidities associated with 
higher incidence of COVID -19 (5-8) , more severe manifestations of COVID -19 disease (9-11), higher 
mortality from COVID -19 (11), and have p oorer health outcomes from a variety of illnesses overall  
(12). As with the observations among the elderly, these racial and ethnic factors all compel the need 
CoVPN  [ADDRESS_815071] of COVID -19 targeted prevention and treatment studies and provision of access to 
these populations of promising prevention and treatment  interventions.   
 
The proposed research will  provide comprehensive information on communities impacted by [CONTACT_4113] -
19 beyond surveillance studies currently in the field (see Appendix IV for summary of existing 
studies). It will  directly contribute to prepared ness for SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_815072] SARS -CoV -2 infection or evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection (based on results of antibody 
tests, self -report, and medical records). Additionally, data captured through questionnaires about 
participants’ household members with COVID -like illness and deaths, combined with serologic data 
from participants, may also provide information about transmission dynamics within households. 
Questionnaire data will inform estimates of the percent of individuals of different age groups, 
including children, who may have had an asymp tomatic COVID -19 infection. The frequency of 
infection among children and whether infected children play an important role in community 
transmission is poorly understood  (13) . The study  will also provide estimates of the association of 
SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_815073] been associated with more severe 
disease outcomes and will also identify demographic and social risk factors associated with infection  
(10). Finally, this research  will provide important information about SARS -CoV -2 transmission , 
COVID -19 disease, attitudes about  and uptake of  containment and mitigation measures, racial and 
ethnic health disparities, varied access to testing and public health resources by [CONTACT_614629], prospects for new prevention and treatment strategies , and be used to inform mathematical 
models of disease progression and projection of future COVID -19 risk . 
 
Other SARS -CoV -2 studies  that are ongoing in the US use different sampling ap proaches and/or 
assess different populations (see Appendix IV). For example, the NIH’s ongoing “SARS -CoV -2 
Pandemic Serosurvey and Blood Sampling,” ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) will estimate the number of adults over 
the age of [ADDRESS_815074] not had confirmed COVID -19 
or known exposure to COVID -19. The study uses non -probability sampling to assemble a cohort of 
15,000 adults from three locations (Bethesda MD, Birmingham AL and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_68321]). The ongoing 
study has a longitudinal co mponent as participants can re -enroll up to four times if more than [ADDRESS_815075], the current study uses time -location sampling to assess cohorts that are representative of 
the communities near NIAID resea rch sites across the US; includes young children and adolescents as 
well as adults; includes a detailed assessment of older adults with medical co -morbidities, including 
those residing in skilled nursing facilities; estimates the number and proportion with active infection as 
well as both symptomatic and asymptomatic prior infection; and will provide a more detailed pi[INVESTIGATOR_614618].  
 
In summary, this study  will provide critically import ant information on the prevalence of current and 
prior SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_815076] metropolitan areas, one CRS will be 
selected with considerat ion given to the population they serve. For larger metropolitan areas (e.g., New 
York, Chicago, Los Angeles), two or more CR Ss may be selected to gain full representation of the 
region. Adjustments ma y be made to the selected CRSs as the dynamic s of the pa ndemic shift.  
 
The study will begin with community consultations with existing site community advisory boards and 
key stakeholders, including relevant experts from local health departments, local healthcare and social 
service providers, and caregivers for elderly and chr onically ill populations. These consultations will 
help identify specific venues, key community attributes, appropriate social venues, and times and days 
when venues are likely to be well populated. The consultations will also include discussions about how  
best to report results of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_815077] using two strategies: facility -based surveys of senior living facilities  and 
time-location sampling (TLS) surveys o f outpatient clinics and community venues. Facility -based 
surveys will begin with each research site creating a list of nearby [CONTACT_614630]. A census of all participating senior living facilities  will be 
conducted  to recruit  up to 500 individuals per research site . Consent will be obtained from legal 
guardians for participant s who are not able to provide consent .  Medical abstraction will be performed 
for these participants in lieu of administering the study questionnaire.  
 
Adults attending outpatient medical clinics and members of t he general population attending 
community v enues will be recruited through TLS. TLS is a well -established study  methodology that 
uses ethnographically -informed mappi[INVESTIGATOR_614619] a “ clinic -time-day universe” or

 Sampling Design and Recruitment at Community Venues  
 
The initial sampling “universe” – the list of target  venues in the catchment area of the CRS  – is 
comprised of venues routinely frequented by [CONTACT_614634] . A venue could be retail 
businesses (e.g., laundromats, grocery  stores ), cafes and restaurants, health clubs, social service 
providers, schools, places of worship, transit hubs , parks, or beaches. Once this list (the “universe”) of 
potential venues is created, CRS staff will determine the suitability of each venue.  A venue may not be 
suitable for sampling if any of the following are true:  
 
• It would be impossible logistically to recruit, interview and conduct study pro cedures .  
• Venue owner(s) refuse to allow the project staff access to venue attendees.  
 
Project staff will assess venue suitability by [CONTACT_614635]/managers. Time-location sampling will be used to select individuals 
who attend the population of suitable  community venues  in the catchment area  during the overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_614621]. For each catchment area, we first 
create a list of all suitable community venues  and times that each venue  is available in a given calendar 
period, e.g. week. Sampling  will be performed in two stages. The first stage selects a stratified random 
samp le of Venue Day Times (VDTs; approximate 4-hour time block that is available for recruitment at 
a specified venue) . The second stage samples individuals from sampled VDTs (details outlined in the 
SSP Manual ).  
 
 Sampling Design and Recruitment at Outpatient  Clinics  
 
Time-location sampling will be used to select individuals who attend suitable (where recruitment is 
feasible, and management is amenable)  outpatient medical clinics in the catchment area during the 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_614622]. Sampling will be performed in two 
stages. The first stage randomly selects  Clinic Day Times (CDTs; approximate 4 -hour time block that 
is available for recruitment at a specified clinic) . The second stage samples individuals attending the  
clinic  during the selected CDT (details outlined in the SSP Manual ).  
 
 Sampling Design and Recruitment at Senior Living Facilities   
 
Sample and recruitment will be undertaken using a  convenience sample of n= 500 individuals from the 
total population of individuals residing in interested and consenting senior  living facilities  (details 
outlined in the SS P Manual).   
 
3.[ADDRESS_815087] (I oR) or designee may  also withdraw participants from the study in 
order to protect their safety and/or if they are unwilling or unable to comply with required study 
procedures. Participants who withdraw from the study prior to completing the study procedures will be  
replaced. S tudy staff will record the reason(s) for all withdrawals from the study in participants’ study 
records.  
CoVPN  [ADDRESS_815088] result will be transmitted in a confidential manner to local health 
authorities.  
 
 Protocol -Specific Consent Form 
 
Recruiters will obtain informed consent using encrypted electronic tablets; participants will receive a 
paper copy of the consent form . A sample protocol -specific consent form is located in  Appendix I I: 
Sample Informed Consent Form . (Paper consent may be collected if electronic consent is not 
available.)  
 
Each CRS is responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a protocol -specific consent form(s) for local use, based on the 
sample protocol -specific consent forms in Appendix I I: Sample Informed Consent Form . The consent 
form(s) must be developed in accordance with requirements of the followin g: 
CoVPN  5002 , Version 2.0  Page 19 of 48 
26 May 2021  • The single IRB ( sIRB )

The sample informed consent form(s) (ICF [s]) include instructions for developi[INVESTIGATOR_115539].   
 
4.2 Enrollment   
 
The point of enrollment into this study is when the participant signs the informed consent form . 
 
4.3 Questionnaire  Administration  
 
The questionnaire will be administered to each consenting participant (or to the parent of participants 
up to 9 years  of age ) using encrypted tablet computers  or paper forms . Data collected will include 
basic demographic, soci oeconomic, geographic, clinical, and household SARS -CoV -2 
exposure/infection history indicators. (The list of COVID symptoms is include d as part of  the 
questionnaire .) A brief knowledge and attitudes questionnaire will be administered to participants aged 
[ADDRESS_815089] from 
COVID -19, such as loss of employment or housing, and access to basi c resources and healthcare.  The 
questionnaire will be tailored for age appropriateness.  
 
4.4 Phlebotomy  
 
A small volume of venous blood ~6 mL for participants aged 2 -6 years, ~10 mL for participants aged 
> [ADDRESS_815090]  unsuccessful attempts at venous 
punc ture (number of failed attempts defined in the SSP)  ), and ~500uL  of blood via heel or finger stick 
(heel stick recommended for  participants 2 -6 months  and finger stick for participants 6 months to 2 
years old ) will be collected from each participant by [CONTACT_614636] a study ID. 
Specimens will be kept in a temperature -controlled container at the venue until they are transported to 
a local laboratory.  
 
Dried blood spots , and plasma or serum aliquots will be prepare d at the processing laboratory and 
stored.  Stored samples will be used  for serologic testing and will also be stored for specialized SARS -
CoV -2 testing. Serologic testing will be performed retrospectively at the LC and/or oth er centralized 
network laboratories. The results of these tests will not be returned to study sites or participants.  
 
4.5 Nasal Mid-Turbinate Swab Sample  Collection  
 
SARS -CoV -2 RNA testing will be performed on nasal mid-turbinate swab samples for analysis at 
local laboratories using  a testing platform approved by [CONTACT_208025]. Procedures for sample collection and 
processing will be described in the SSP Manual.  
 
4.6 Saliva Substudy  
 
CoVPN  5002 , Version 2.0  Page 20 of 48 
26 May 2021  In a subset (appro ximately 1000) of participants, a n additional nasal mid -turbinate swab and s aliva will 
be collected as described in the SSP manual .  
 
4.7 SARS -CoV -2 Counseling  
 
All study participants will receive counseling messages consistent with the US Center for Disease 
Control  and Prevention  (CDC) and local public health authorities. These messages will include 
instructions on use of masks and how to isolate from others, dur ation of isolation, how to monitor for 
worsening of symptoms, and how to connect to social services as needed.  
 
4.8 SARS -CoV -2 Results Reporting  
 
Participants will be provided with instructions to  retrieve the results of their SARS -CoV-2 RNA testing;  
those wit h positive test results will receive counseling about isolation and referral to care and will be 
reminded of plans to inform local health authorities for follow -up and contact [CONTACT_144842]. Positive RNA 
results will be reported to local health authorities  as pe r local health regulations . Serology results are for 
research purposes only and will not be returned to participants.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_815091] been consented by [CONTACT_614637] . Questionnaire domains will include history of chronic illnesses (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, 
asthma, etc.), smoking history, and prior SARS -CoV -2 diagnosis  and will be comparable  (when 
possible)  to domains in the questionnaire .   
 
 SAFETY MONITORING AND ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
As this is an observational study, standard adverse event (AE) reporting will n ot be undertaken. The 
study team will monitor for and track serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study procedures and/or 
to participation in the study. Such events that are unexpected  will be reported to the NIAID  Medical  
Officer at the same time as th ey are reported to IRBs according to pre -established written procedures, 
as required by 45 CFR 46. This information will not be recorded on case report forms  (CRFs ) or 
entered into the study database. Data on social harms will be collected as part of the o verall assessment 
of participant safety.   
 
 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
6.1 Review of Study Design  
 
This is a cross -sectional study  of individuals residing within the vicinity of selected research sites  in 
the [LOCATION_002] who are (i) resid ing in senior  living facilities , (ii) visiting  outpatient clinics  at given 
times ; and ( iii) members of the general population who attend any of the listed community venues at 
given time s. The study aims to estimate prevalence of SARS -CoV -2 infection and IgG seropositiv ity 
separately in each of the se populations (sampling strategies described above) . Given that the three 
primary endpoints and their respective samples are independent, sites may recruit from one, two, or all 
three population groups, depending on site capac ity (sites must enroll from at least the community 
venues) . Consenting and assenting participants  who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
described in Section 3.0, will answer a brief survey and provide a blood sample and nasal mid -
turbinate swab (s).  
CoVPN  5002 , Version 2.0  Page 21 of 48 
26 May 2021   
6.2 Sample Size  
 
The sample size is calculated for the primary objective, namely, to estimate the seroprevalence of 
SARS -CoV -2 among individuals and communities where potentia l COVID -19 vaccine or other 
prevention interventions studies may be prioritized.   
 
A sample of up to  500 senior l iving facility  residents will be enrolled  (described above).  
 
A separate  sample of approximately 500 adults from outpatient clinical facilitie s will be selected 
according to a TLS design implemented as a two -stage random sample  (described above).  
 
The sample size for the TLS sampling was determined based on the minimum sample size needed to 
achieve prespecified margin of error (MOE). This framew ork sets a tolerance, also called the margin 
of error (MOE) for how close we would like the estimated prevalence 𝑝̂ to be from the true population 
prevalence 𝑝. Denoting the MOE by e, this means  
𝑃𝑟(|𝑝̂−𝑝|≤𝑒)=1−𝛼. 
Assuming 𝑝̂  can be treated as normally distributed, this statement is equivalent to setting the half -
width of a 100(1−𝛼)/ two-sided confidence interval to 𝑒=𝑧1−𝛼/2√𝑉(𝑝̂) which results in a sample 
size of  
𝑛≈𝑧1−𝛼/22𝑝(1−𝑝)
𝑒2 
Table 1 shows the sample sizes needed to achieve required sample sizes with +/ -5% and +/ -2.5% 
margin of error on estimated prevalence for a range of assumed prevalence of SARS -CoV -2 antibodies 
for simple random samples of infinite population size.

+/- 2.5% MOE  [PHONE_12707]  1959  2459  2881  
 
To estimate the prevalence of infection and seropositivity in each of four age strata ( 2 months -17, 18-
39, 40 -59, 60+ years), we assumed the seroprevalence of SARS -CoV -2 may vary from 2.5% to 25%, 
and specified a margin of error (MOE) of 2.5% for prevalence b elow 5% and 5% MOE for prevalence 
between 10 and 25%, and assumed a design effect of 2.5 to account for clustering within social 
CoVPN  5002 , Version 2.0  Page 22 of 48 
26 May 2021  networks of a venue . These values are shaded in Table 2 above and yield a maximum sample size of 
730 per stratum.  
 
6.3 Statistical Analyses  
 
This section briefly describes the final study analyses. Detailed technical specifications of the 
statistical analyses will be described in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP) . 
 
All statistical analyses will account for the sample design to create the base sampling weights.  The 
sampling weights will be further adjusted for nonresponse and post -stratified using demographic  
information such as  age, sec, race/ethnicity, education, an d income . County -level estimates from the 
census bureau will be used for raking and post -stratification.  We will estimate prevalence and calculate 
95% confidence intervals of SARS -CoV -2 infection and IgG seropositivity for each target population 
separately , i.e. among community residents in each of the age groups  (2 months -17, 18 -39, 40 -59, 60+ 
years) ; among patients attending  the outpatient  clinics;  and among senior living facility  residents . 
 
 Primary Analyses  
 
Design -based  estimates using the survey weights will be used to estimate the overall p revalence of 
SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_815092] 95% confidence intervals.  
 
Prevalence estimates in each age group will be estimated u sing domain estimates  implemented as ratio 
estimates in each subgroup .  
 
Sensitivity analysis may be considered to adjust for test sensitivity and specificity if prevalence is 
estimated to be lower than 5% . 
 
 Secondary Analyses  
 
Prevalence estimates in each  age group will be estimated using domain estimates implemented as ratio 
estimates in each subgroup  (15) for Secondary Objectives [ADDRESS_815093] CONTAINMENT

reference laboratories  will be performed for research use only. Individual participant level r esults from 
these assays will not be made available to study sites or participants.  
 
7.3 Endpoint Assays  
 
For SARS -CoV -2 infection, RNA testing will be performed using nasal mid-turbinate swabs at local  or 
clinical reference laboratories using a laboratory platform approved by [CONTACT_208025].  
 
For SARS -CoV -2 seroprevalence, SARS -CoV -2 specific IgG antibodies will be evaluated in 
centralized laboratories approved by [CONTACT_614638] 
(FDA )-approved or have Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) from the US FDA.  The SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_815095] specialized laboratory testing . This testing will be performed 
using samples from a subset of study participants. T his testing may include characterization of SARS -
CoV -2 virus es; phylogenetic analysis; detection of anti -SARS -CoV -2 IgM antibodies; evaluation of 
CoV -2 assays using alternate sample types; characterization of  the host response to SARS -CoV -2 
infection; viral neutralization assays; and the prevalence of co -infections  with other viruses, including 
viruses that may impact the specificity of COVID -19 serologic assays.  
 
Samples may also be used for other testing and research related to furthering the understanding of 
SARS -CoV -2 immunology and virology, including, but not limited to, antibody -mediated anti -viral 
activities, and antibody dependent enhancement; monoclonal antibodies and antibody -mediated

appropriate, by [CONTACT_17359]. Upon receiving final approval, sites will submit all required protocol 
registration documents to the DAIDS PRO at the DAIDS Regulatory Support Center ( RSC ). The 
DAIDS PRO will review the submitted protocol registration packet to ensure that all of the required 
documents have been received. In the case of Initial Registration, site -specific ICFs WILL be reviewed 
and approved by [CONTACT_68410]. Sites will receive an Initial Registration Notification fr om the 
DAIDS PRO that indicates successful completion of the protocol registration process. A copy of the 
Initial Registration Notification should be retained in the site's regulatory files.  
 
Following Initial Registration, any full protocol amendments req uire submission of a protocol 
registration packet to the DAIDS PRO as described above; however, the DAIDS PRO WILL NOT  
review and approve site -specific ICFs. Sites will receive a Registration Notification when the DAIDS 
PRO receives a complete registration  packet.  Upon receiving final IRB/EC and any other applicable 
regulatory  approval(s) for an amendment, sites should implement the amendment immediately.  
 
For additional information on the protocol registration process and specific documents required for 
initial and amendment registrations, refer to the current version of the DAIDS Protocol Registration 
Manual  online.  
 
9.2 Study Activation  
 
Pending successful protocol registration and submission of all required documents, the LOC  staff will 
“activate” a site. Study implementation may not be initiated until a study activation notice is provided 
to the site by [CONTACT_614642] . In addition, if study act ivation is determined to be necessary for any subsequent 
amendments, study implementation may not be initiated until a study activation notice is provided to 
the site by [CONTACT_614642] . 
 
9.3 Study Coordination

ABOUT THE STUDY  
 
The COVID -19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) is doing a study to estimate the number of people who have or 
have had the SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_815108] new drugs for treatment or prevention of 
COVID -19.  
 
Between 78,000 – 98,[ADDRESS_815109] udy at multiple places around the country. In each 
community, ~3920  will be enrolled. The researcher in charge of this study in your community is 
[Insert name [CONTACT_107002]]  and s/he is located at  [Insert CRS name] . The [sponsor]  is pay ing for the study.  
 
2. We are doing this study to answer several questions.  
 
• How many people in the study communities have or have had SARS -CoV-2 or COVID -19? 
• What do people in the study communities know about SARS -CoV -2 or COVID -19? 
• How do people in the study communities feel about SARS -CoV -2 or COVID -19? 
• How often and in what way s are people exposed to SARS -CoV -2?   
• What is the general health of people in the study communities?  
 
3. There is no drug or treatment provided as part of this study.  
 
This is an observational study. We are only testing participants for SARS -CoV -2, drawing blood for additional 
lab testing related to SARS -CoV -2, and asking participants to complete a questionnaire.   
 
JOINING THE STUDY  
 
4. It is completely up to you whethe r or not you join the study.  
 
Take your time in deciding. If it helps, talk to people you trust such as a friends or family member. If you decide 
not to join this study, or if you discontinue before you complete the study procedures, you will not lose any  
benefits or rights you would normally have at [CRS name ].

5. If you want to join the study, we will screen you to see if you are eligible.  
 
Screening involves a brief questionnaire to determine:  
• Your age  
• Where you live  
• If you are enrolled in another SARS-CoV -2 or COVID -19 clinical trial which involves taking an 
experimental medication  
• If you are already enrolled in this study in another community  
 
BEING IN THE STUDY  
 
If you meet the study requirements and want to join, here is what will happen:  
 
6. You will have one study visit either immediately after signing the consent form or at a later date that is 
more convenient for you.  
 
This study includes a single study visit. It will take approximately 30 minutes to complete the study visit.  (If all 
procedures cannot  be completed in one visit, sample collection and the brief survey must be completed during  the 
same visit within 10 days  of completing this consent ). The study procedures will include:  
 
• Collec ting basic information about you, your health, your household, and possible exposure to SARS -
CoV -2 (completed by [CONTACT_614647] 0 -9 years old)  
• Completing a brief survey about your knowledge and feelings about SAR S-CoV -2 (completed by [CONTACT_614648] 0 -9 years old)  
• Drawing blood for lab testing related to SARS -CoV -2 
o ~10 mL if you are > 6 years old  or 1 ml from a fingerstick after having had unsuccessful venous 
puncture attempts  
o ~6 mL if you are 2 – 6 years old   
o ~500 uL in a microtainer tube  if you are 2 months to < 2 years old   
▪ A heel stick is recommended for participants 2 -6 months and finger stick for  participants 
6 months to 2 years old  
• Performing nasal swab testing for  SARS -CoV -2 
• Some participants may be asked to provide  saliva  and an additional nasal swab  for SARS -CoV -2 testing . 
[Only include if your site is participating in this subset. Otherwise, delete.]  
• [For participants recruited from health facilities, also include: We will also collect some information 
from your health records  related to chronic conditions, smoking history, and prior SARS -CoV -2 
diagnosis .] 
 
7. You will receive a gif t card for  [$X] when you complete the study visit.  
 
This amount is to compensate you for your time. You do not have to pay anything to be in this study.  
 
8. We will test your samples to see if you have or have had SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_815110] the SARS -CoV -2 virus in your 
body.  You will be given  a [phone number or website ] to retrieve the results of these tests.  We will also test for 
antibodies against SARS -CoV -2. Antibodies are the prote ins your body makes to fight infections. Antibody tests 
will tell us if you have SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_815111] s are only for research purposes . 
Results from these tests  will not be returned  to you .    
 
CoVPN  5002 , Version 2.0  Page 36 of 48

[ADDRESS_815112] on  COVID -19. These tests are only for research purposes. Results from these tests will 
not be returned to you.    
 
Testing will not include sequencing your full DNA.  
 
9. When samples are no longer needed for this study, the CoVPN may want to use them in other studies 
and share them with other researchers.  
 
These samples are called “extra samples”. The CoVPN will only allow your extra samples to be used in other 
studies if you agree to this. You will mark your decision at the end of this form. If you have any questions, please 
ask. 
 
Do I have to agree?  No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind after you sign this form. At your 
request, we will destroy all extra samples that we have. Your decision will not affect your being in this study or 
have any negative consequences  here.  
 
Where are the samples stored?  Extra samples are stored in a secure central place called a repository. Your 
samples will be stored in a repository in the [LOCATION_002].  
 
How long will the samples be stored?  There is no limit on how long your extra samples will be stored.  [Site: 
Revise the previous sentence to insert limits if your regulatory authority imposes them.]  
 
Will I be paid for the use of my samples?  No. Also, a researcher may make a new scientific discovery or 
product based on the use of yo ur samples. If this happens, there is no plan to share any money with you. The 
researcher is not likely to ever know who you are.  
 
Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies?  Probably not. Results from these other 
studies are not g iven to you, this clinic, or your doctor. They are not part of your medical record. The studies are 
only being done for research purposes.  
 
Will the CoVPN sell my samples and information?  No, but the CoVPN may share your samples with other 
researchers. Onc e we share your samples and information, we may not be able to get them back.  
 
How do other researchers get my samples and information?  When a researcher wants to use your samples 
and information, their research plan must be approved by [CONTACT_400834]. Also, th e institutional review board (IRB) 
will review this plan.  IRBs protect the rights and well -being of people in research. If the research plan is 
approved, the CoVPN will send your samples to the researcher’s location.  
 
What information is shared with the C oVPN or other researchers?  The samples and information will be 
labeled with a code number. The key to the code will stay at the CRS. It will not be shared with the CoVPN or 
other researchers. Your name [CONTACT_107030]. However, some information that we share may 
be personal, such as your race, ethnicity, sex, health information from the study, and lab test results.  
 
What kind of studies might be done with my extra samples and information?  The studies will be related to 
SARS -CoV -2, COVID -19, vaccines, antibodies, the immune system  (your body’s defense system)  and other 
diseases. Testing will not include sequencing your full DNA.

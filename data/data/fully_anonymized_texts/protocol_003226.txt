Dose Escalation 
Phase  The primary objective of the dose escalation phase is to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of fruquintinib in patients with advanced solid tumors and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).  
The primary endpoint of the dose escalation phase  is the incidence of 
DLT in each cohort .  DLT is defined as:  
Any Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity;
Any Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity related to study drug
except for nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, hypertensionand electrolyte imbalances downgraded within 3 days  with
appropriate supportive treatment;
Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >3 days;
Grade 3 febrile neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC])<1.0 × 10
9/L with a single temperature of >38.3 °C or a sustained
temperature of ≥38°C for more than one hour;
Grade 4  thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia
associated with bleeding;

The secondary objectives of the dose escalation phase are:  
• To evaluate the PK characteristics of multiple-dose fruquintinib 
and to investigate th e metabolite profile of fruquintinib in the 
plasma of patients with solid tumors.  
• To evaluate the anticancer activity of fruquintinib in patients with 
solid tumors according to RECIST Version 1.1.  
The secondary endpoints of the dose escalation phase are:  
• The primary PK parameters include
: maximum plasma 
concentration (C max), time to reach maximum concentration 
(Tmax), terminal half -life (t 1/2), area under the concentration -time 
curve in a selected time interval (AUC 0-t), area under the 
concentration -time curve in the time interval from 0 to infinity 
(AUC 0∞∞-∞), apparent clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of 
distribution (V z/F) during the terminal phase according to 
CL/F/Ke, and the accumulation index based on AUC.  
• The objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), progression -free survival ( PFS), 
overall survival (OS) and percentage change in tumor size from 
baseline according to RECIST v. 1.1. 
Study Objectives 
and Endpoints: 
Dose Expansion

To evaluate the an ticancer activity of fruquintinib at the recommended 
Phase 2 dose (RP2D) from the dose escalation phase, in patients with 
advanced solid tumors . 
The primary endpoint of the dose expansion phase  is: PFS rate. 
The secondary objectives of the dose expansion p hase  are: 
• To evaluate anticancer efficacy of fruquintinib, as assessed by [CONTACT_3168], DCR, DoR, PFS, and OS 
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of multiple dose fruquintinib and investigate the metabolite profile of fruquintinib in plasma .  
• To ev aluate the safety of fruquintinib.

duration of response (DoR), PFS , overall survival (OS ), and 
percentage change in tumor size from base line according to 
RECIST V . 1.1  
• The primary PK parameters include: maximum plasma 
concentration (C max), time to reach maximum concentration 
(Tmax), terminal half -life (t1/2), area under the concentration-
time curve in a selected time interval (AUC 0-t), are a under the

(AUC 0-∞), apparent clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of 
distribution (Vz/F) during the terminal phase according to 
CL/F/Ke, and the accumulation index based on AUC.  
• Safety , as assessed by  [CONTACT_733847], physical 
examinations, vital signs, laboratory test results, 12-lead 
electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram.  
Study Design  This is an open -label study of fruquintinib comprised of a dose 
escalation  phase in patients with advanced solid tumors of any type, and 
a dose expansion phase  in patients  with advanced solid tumors of any 
type (Cohort A),  in patients with refractory mCRC (Cohorts B and C),  or 
in patients  with mBC (Cohorts D and E ). 
Dose Escalation/ P hase： 
• Approximately 12 evaluable patients will be enrolled.  The 
actual number of patients enrolled will depend on the dose -
limiting toxicity (DLT) profile as well as maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) level reached in this trial.  
• The dose levels to be investigated are 3 mg and 5 mg QD, 
3 weeks on/1week off.  
• Six DLT -evaluable patient s will be enrolled in the dose 
escalation phase and will be treated with fruquintinib 3  mg QD 
(3 weeks on/1week off) orally.  If no more than 1 DLT occurs 
during the DLT observational window ( ie, from Days 1 -28 in 
Cycle 1)  among the 6 patient s, the trial will continue to enroll 
another 6 patients in the next dose cohort in which fruquintinib 5 
mg QD (3  weeks on/1week off)  will be tested.   
• Safety monitoring and evaluation for the dose escalation  phase 
will be carried out by [CONTACT_7244] (SRC ).   
• If no more than 1 patient at the dose level of 5  mg QD 
experiences a DLT, the dose escalation phase is completed and the expansion phase of the study will be conducted.  
• Upon completion of the dose escalation phase, the SRC will 
review aggregated safety and PK data and then select a fruquintinib dose as the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for 
the expansion phase of the trial.

following time points: pre -dose (within 10 minutes), 1, 2, 4, 8, 
and [ADDRESS_1002748] dose on Days 1, 14 and 21.  
• Prior to confirmation of a DLT, if a patient  received medical 
intervention or missed 4 or more fruquintinib doses during the 
DLT observational wi ndow, the patient will not be  qualified as 
DLT -evaluable and will therefore be replaced.  
• If a patient does not meet the definition of DLT-evaluable 
patient during the DLT observation period, the patient will be 
replaced.  
• Patients  who have completed the DLT  observation period (Days 
1-28, Cycle 1) and are deemed to be benefiting from the 
fruquintinib treatment at the investigator’s discretion may 
continue the fruquintinib treatment until disease progression, 
death, intolerable toxicity, or at investigator’s d iscretion that the 
patient can no longer benefit from the study drug.  
• Tumor evaluations during the dose escalation phase are 
scheduled at screening and every 8 weeks (± 1 week) thereafter, 
ie, C3D1, C5D1, C7D1, etc (odd-numbered cycles).  Response 
assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_733848]  1.1.  
• Patients will be followed until death or study completion.  
Dose Expansion Phase:  
Once the RP2D is determined, patients  may 
enroll into one of the 
following  cohorts  and will r eceive fruquintinib at the  RP2D: 
• Cohort A: Patients with advanced , refractory  solid tumors of any 
type.  
• Cohort B:  Patients with refractory mCRC who have progressed 
on all standard chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_733817], or had i ntolerable toxicity with, at least 
[ADDRESS_1002749]-line therapy ( TAS -102 or regorafenib ). 
• Cohort C:   Patients with refractory mCRC who have progressed 
on all standard chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_733818] -102 or regorafenib . 
• Cohort D:   Patients with hormone -receptor positive (ER+ 
and/or PR+)/Her2 - metastatic breast cancer who have  progressed 
on at least two line of prior systemic therapy . 
• Cohort  E:  Patients with  advanced  triple negative breast cancer  
(TNBC) who have  progressed on at least one cytotoxic therapy 
in the metastatic setting.  
The safety of all  enrolled patients in the expansion cohorts  will be closely 
monitored from the first day of fruquintinib dosing until 30 days after the

10. For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with 
partners of childbearing potential, agreement to use a highly effective 
form(s) of contraception, that results in a low failure rate (<1% per 
year) when used consistently and correctly,  starting during the 
screening period, continuing throughout the entire study period, and for [ADDRESS_1002757] dose of study drug .  Such methods 
include: oral hormonal contraception  (combined estrogen/ 
progestogen, or progestogen-only ), 
associated with inhibition of 
ovulation together with a barrier method (eg, diaphragm , always 
containing a spermicide ), intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine 
hormone -releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal  ligation, 
vasectomized partner (on the understanding that this is the only one 
partner during the whole study duration), or sexual abstinence.  Oral 
contraception should always be combined with an additional 
contraceptive method (ie, barrier method) because of a potential 
interaction with the study drug.  The same rules are valid for male 
patients involved in this clinical trial if they have a partner of 
childbirth potent ial.  Male patients must always use a condom.  
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is 
postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (ie, ≥12 
continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than 
menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of

Statistical Analysis:  
By-subject listings will be created for variables from each CRF module, as applicable.  
Summary tables for continuous variables will contain at least  the following statistics: number of 
patient s (n), mean, standard deviation  (SD) , median, minimu m, and maximum.  Summary 
tables for categorical variables will include  n, and percentage . 
Safety Assessment  All patients who have received at least one dose of fruquintinib will be 
included in the safety analysis set (SAS).  
All DLTs will be listed by [CONTACT_733852] -evaluable patient s for the 
dose escalation phase only.  
Safety will be evaluated based on the frequency and severity of AEs, change of laboratory test results, change s in vital signs , change in ECG , 
and change in echocardiogram .  Safety data 
will be listed and 
summarized by [CONTACT_42376], for patients overall, and for patients with mCRC ( cohorts ’ B and C) and mBC ( cohort s’ D and E) who received 
fruquintinib at the RP2D . 
The severity of all AEs will be graded by [CONTACT_733853] v 4.03.   All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary 
for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).   Treatment-emergent  AEs 
(TEAEs)  will be classified by [CONTACT_7204] (SOC) and 
specified by [CONTACT_9560] (PT).  The incidence of TEAEs, SAEs, 
adverse events of special interest  (AESIs), TE
AEs leading to dose 
interruption, dose reduction, or study drug discontinuation will be 
summarized .   
For the laboratory assessments, such as hematology, serum biochemistry, 
urinalysis, and other urine parameters will be programmatically graded 
according to CTCAE severity grade.  Summary tables will be presented

Angiogenesis is a prominent feature of many physiological and pathological processes, 
including wound healing, luteinization, and tumor growth [1,2].  It is regulated by a balance 
between local pro- angiogenic and anti -angiogenic factors.  Vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) is an important pro -angiogenic factor.  It is a key regulator of physiological 
angiogenesis during embryogenesis, skeletal growth, and reproductive functions.  It is 
also implicated in pathological angiogenesis such as that associated with tumor growth.  
In the normal state, endothelial cells divide approximately every 7 years, but in the malignant state, this growth rate is accelerated,  and endothelial cells can divide as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_733821] 7  to 10 days.  An “angiogenic switch” is necessary for tumors to obtain the 
necessary nutrients and oxygen to grow larger than a diameter of 1 mm. 
The biologic effects of VEGF are mediated through binding to 3 VEGF receptors, VEGFR-
1 (Flt -1), VEGFR- 2 (KDR or Flk -1), and VEGFR -3.  Binding of VEGF to its receptors 
begins the signaling cascade that regulates cellular events involved in new blood vessel 
formation that produces a number of biologic effects including endothelial cell mitogenesis 
and migration, increased vascular permeability, and inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis.  
Newly formed tumor vessels are markedly dependent on VEGF, and VEGF mRNA is 
upregulated in many tumors.  Tumor cells represent the major source of VEGF, but tumor -
associated stroma is also an important site of VEGF production
[2,3]. 
Overexpression of VEGF has been associated with the promotion of tumor growth, elevati on of the vascular permeability of tumor vessels, and poor prognosis in solid tumors , 
including colorectal carcinoma
[4,5], gastric carcinoma[6,7], breast cancer[8,9] and lung 
cancer[10]. 
Fruquintinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with  a novel chemical 
structure , which belongs to the quinazoline class.  It is a potent and highly selective 
VEGFR inhibitor discovered by [CONTACT_733860]-throughput in vitro  and in vivo biological screening of a large number of 
compounds

nical Experience  
The safety and efficacy of fruquintinib ( HMPL -013) has been studied in a number of  
Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies in patients with a variety of s olid tumors , including metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC), and locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent non˗small cell 
lung cancer ( NSCLC)  as a single agent or in combination with other anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Summary details can be found in the IB (Section 1.2)[11]. 
1.3.1 Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
The PK of fruquintinib was evaluated in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors  
treated with a single -dose or multiple -dose regimen  (Study 2009-013- 00CH1) .  
Following administration,  a single oral dose of 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 mg, fruquintinib showed a 
very low clearance.  The selection of the once daily (QD) dose regimen was justified by 
[CONTACT_733861] t1/2 of >35 hours .  The AUC and C max generally increased dose -
proportionally at the dose levels from 1 m g to 6 mg.   Following multiple dosing, 
fruquintinib exposure reached steady state after QD administration for 14 days.  Based on 
the AUC for the QD dosing interval (24 hours), accumulation of fruquintinib exposure 
from the first dose to steady state was ap proximately 3-fold. 
The PK of a 4-week continuous dosing regimen of 5 mg QD was compared to a 3-week 
continuous dosing regimen of 6 mg QD followed by a 1-week break  in fruquintinib therapy 
in patients with solid  cancer s (Study 2009- 013-00CH1 ).  The PK  results showed that 
fruquintinib PK profiles were similar for the 2 dosing regimens on the same  dosing days  
(see Table 2 ).

Two additional dosing regimens  were compared: a 4-week continuous dosing regimen of 
4 mg QD, and a 3-week continuous dosing regimen of 5 mg QD followed by a 1-week 
break  in fruquintinib therapy , were also evaluated in patients with advanced colorectal 
cancer  (Study 2012-013-00CH3).  Overall, the PK profiles of fruquintinib obtained in this 
study were similar to those in the prior trial (Study 2009-013-00CH1). The effect of food intake on fruquintinib PK was investigated in healthy male adult 
volunteers at a single oral dose of 4 mg (Study 2012-013- 00CH2) .  The food effect was 
evaluated by [CONTACT_733862] (fast ed) and 
the fed condition (food intake).  Fruquintinib exposure was represented by [CONTACT_12265]
0-∞ and 
Cmax.  The geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval  [CI]) of fast ed/food intake 
met the bioequivalence criteria of 80% -125% for AUC and 70%-143% for C max.  
Absorption appeared to occur more slowly in the fed condition than in the fasting cond ition.  
1.3.2 Clinical Safety

1.3.3 Clinical Efficacy  
The efficacy  data in the Phase 1  study conducted in China (Study 2009-013- 00CH1) 
showed encouraging clinical activity for fruquintinib.  A response was observed in the 
majority of heavily pre -treated patien ts with advanced cancers (see Table 5 ).  T he result s 
of two Phase 2  proof-of- concept ( POC) studies provided evidence of clinical efficacy in 
patient s with metastatic CRC  (Study 2012-013- 00CH1 , third - or later lines therapy ) and 
NSCLC (S tudy 2014- 013-00CH1 , third -line therapy ) as compared with placebo.  The 
progression free  survival ( PFS) results established POC in both studies by [CONTACT_150075].

1.4 Study Rationale  
During the pathogenesis of cancer, tumors can secret e a variety of factors to stimulate the 
formation of tumor vasculature to increase their supply of nutrients and oxygen.  Such 
tumor vasculature is often fo rmed by [CONTACT_454762], leading to increased permeability and tumor cell leakage into the circulation .[1] 
Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast cell growth factor (FGF) 
play key roles in tumor angiogenesis and have become two molecular targets of intense 
research for anti -angiogenesis therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014][2-3].  Highly selective antibodies against VEGF or 
its receptor VEGFR have demonstrated significant clinical benefit and have been widely used for the  treatment of certain cancers
[4].  Small molecule drugs, including sunitinib and 
sorafenib, targeting the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase signaling pathway have also contributed significantly in treating cancer
[5,6].  However, most of the early 
gener ation small molecule VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) inhibit many kinases 
other than VEGFR, resulting in “off-target” toxicities[7].  Therefore, improving kinase 
selectivity has become a key focus for newer generation TKIs.  
Fruquintinib , discovere d by [CONTACT_733863], demonstrated much improved kinase 
selectivity compared to sunitinib and sorafenib  in the preclinical setting .  Fruquintinib 
select ively  inhibits VEGFR, sparing many other kinases.  Preclinical safety evaluation 
results supported an acceptable safety  profile for fruquintinib . 
The s afety, tolerability , and pharmacokinetic properties of fruquintinib  were assessed in a 
Phase 1 dose escalation study (Study 2009-013-00CH1) that was carried out in patient s 
with advance d solid tumors in C hina.  Results indicated that fruquintinib was well 
tolerated up to 4 mg QD continuous  therapy and 6 mg QD 3  week s on/1 week  off.  The 
maxi mum tolerated dose (MTD) has  been reached  in patients treated with the continuous 
regimen, but not in patients treate d with the 3 week s on/[ADDRESS_1002781]

abnormalities  are common ly repor ted in drugs of this class and can be managed effectively .  
Preliminary clinical efficacy was seen in patient s with partial response (PR) and durable 
stable disease (SD).   
Although the MTD was not reached, the experience in China demonstrated that 
fruquintinib 5  mg (3 week s on/1 week off ) treatment had improved PFS in Chinese patients 
with metastatic CRC  and NSCLC as compared with placebo and was well tolerated .  The 
extensive clinical trial experience in China is the rationale for investigating the 3 mg a nd 
5 mg regimens in the present Phase 1 study.  If there are clinically significant differences 
in the PK of fruquintinib in patients in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) compared to those of patients 
in China, the dose escalation sequence may need to be revisited.  
The rationale for adding approximately 40 patients with refractory mCRC in dose 
expansion Cohort B is provided by [CONTACT_733864] 3 FRESCO study completed in 
China (study 2013-013- 00CH1 [FRESCO]).  FRESCO[14] was a randomized, placebo -

FRESCO study completed in China (study 2013-013- 00CH1 [FRESCO]).  This cohort 
will evaluate the safety and  efficacy of fruquintinib in a patient population in the US  that 
is similar to that of FR ESCO . 
The rationale for adding Cohorts D (HR+/Her2 -) and E (TNBC) of patients each with mBC  
is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fruquintinib in patients with mBC based on data 
from Phase 1 studies of fruquintinib conducted in China (Protocol 2009 -013- 00CH1) and 
in the US (Protocol 2015-013-00US1), suggesting clinical activity in the proposed

Figure 5  Study Schema  
 
 
3.1.1 Dose Escalation P hase   
• Approximately 12 evaluable patient s will be enrolled.  The actual number of 
patient s will depend on the occurrence of dose- limiting toxicities (DLT s) as well as 
the MTD  level rea ched in this trial. 
• The dose levels to be investigated are 3 mg and 5  mg QD, 3 weeks on/1 week off.  
• Six DLT -evaluable patients will be enrolled in the phase and will be tr eated with 
fruquintinib 3 mg QD (3  weeks on/1 week off) orally.  If no more than 1 DL T 
occurs during the DLT observational window ( ie, from Days 1 -28 in Cycle 1)  
among the 6 patients , the trial will continue to enroll another 6 patients in the next 
dose cohort in which fruquintinib 5 mg QD (3  weeks on/1 week off)  will be tested.  
• Safety monitoring and evaluation for the D ose Escalation phase will be carried out 
by [CONTACT_7244] (SRC) .  Additional information about the SRC 
is provided in Section 3.4 .

escalation  phase is completed and the expansion phase of the study will be 
conducted. 
• Upon completion of  the dose escalation / phase, the SRC will review the aggregated 
safety and PK data and then select a fruquintinib dose as the RP2D for the 
expansion phase of the trial. 
• Blood samples for PK assay will be collected in Cycle 1 at the following time points: 
pre-dose (within 10 minutes), 1, 2, 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_1002785] dose on Days 1, 14 and 
21. 
• Prior to confirmation of a DLT, i f a patient  has received any prophylactic medical 
intervention or missed 4 or more fruquintinib doses during the DLT observational 
window, the patient  is not DLT evaluable and will be replaced. 
• If a patient  does not meet the definition of DLT evaluable patient  criterion during 
the DLT observation period, the patient will be replaced.  
• Patient s who have completed the DLT observation period ( Days 1 -28, Cycle 1) and 
are deemed to be benefiting from the f ruquintinib treatment at the investigator’s 
discretion may  continue the f ruquintinib treatment until disease progression, death, 
intolerable toxicity, or at investigator’s discretion that the patient  can no longer 
benefit from the study drug. 
• Please see Appendix A  for the Schedule of Events  and Section 5.2 for the dose 
modification instructions . 
• Patients will be followed until death or study completion.  
a. Dose- Limiting Toxicity Assessment Window  
The DLT assessment window will be [ADDRESS_1002786] cycle (Days 1 -28).  Any patient  
who is not considered evaluable for DLT as defined below will be replaced by [CONTACT_733865].  
NOTE:  Dose-l imiting toxicity assessment does not apply to the expansion  cohorts.  
b. Definition of DLT Evaluable P atients: 
A DLT evaluable patient has to meet the following criteria:  
• Has not received any prior anti -cancer therapy prior to DLT; AND  
• Has completed the first [ADDRESS_1002787] 85% of the assigned f ruquintinib  dose;  
OR

c. Definition of a Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
 A DLT is defined as one of the toxicities defined for the primary endpoint of the 
dose escalation phase in Section  2.1.2.  These AEs occur during the DLT 
assessment window (Days 1 -28, Cycle 1) and are determined by [CONTACT_282446] a reasonable possibility of being related to fruquintinib.   
 Any Grade 4 non- hematologic toxicity;  
 Any Grade 3 non- hematologic toxicity related to study drug except for 
nausea/v omiting, diarrhea, constipation, hypertension and electrolyte imbalances 
downgraded within 3 days with appropriate supportive treatment; 
 Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >3 days; 
 Grade 3 f ebrile neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count  [ANC]  <1.0 × 109/L with a 
single temperature of >38.3°C or a sustained temperature of ≥38°C for more than 
1 hour;  
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocyt openia associated with bleeding;  
 Dose interruptio n for >14 days due to toxicity; 
In the absence of clinical abnormality, repeat laboratory testing will be conducted to 
confirm significant laboratory findings prior to designation as a DLT. 
d. Definition of MTD  
The MTD  is the  highest dose at which no more than 1 of the 6 patient s in each cohort of 
the dose escalation  phase develops a DLT.  If 2 or more of 6 patient s in each cohort of t he 
dose escalation phase develop DLT at a particular dose  level , that dose  has exceeded the 
MTD.   
3.1.2 Dose Expansion Phase  
The objectives of the dose expansion phase are to evaluate the anticancer activity and safety 
of fruquintinib  at the RP2D determined at t he end of the dose escalation  phase, as described 
in Section 2.2 . 
Once the RP2D is determined, patients may enroll into one of the following cohorts and 
will receive fruquintinib at the RP2D.   
• Cohort A: P atients  with advanced, refractory  solid tumors of any type 
• Cohort B: Patients with refractory mCRC who have progressed on all standard 
chem otherapi[INVESTIGATOR_733824] , or had 
intolerable toxicity with , at least [ADDRESS_1002788]-line therapy ( TAS-102 or 
regorafenib).

Approximately 12 patients will be enrolled in the dose escalation  phase, and approximately 
116 additional patients (6 with advanced solid tumors of any type, 40 with refractory 
mCRC  who progressed on TAS -102 and/or regorafenib, 40 with mCRC who had not 
received TAS -102 or regorafenib, 15 with refractory HR+/HER2- mBC , and 15 with 
advanced, refractory TNBC ) will be enrolled in the dose expansion phase. 
3.3 Investigational Site  
Approximately 12 sites will participate in the study . 
3.4 Safety Review Committee  
A Safety Review Committee ( SRC) will be established under a charter to conduct safety 
data review and to determine the next step for dose escalation.  Safety mo nitoring and 
evaluation for dose escalation decisions will be carried out by [CONTACT_733866].  The SRC is chaired 
by [CONTACT_1034] ’s fruquintinib Clinical Program Leader ; members  will include the principal 
investigators (PIs), the Sponsor ’s PK scientist, medical monitor, and  the CRO’s medical 
monitor.  
Dose escalation decisions are based on AE and PK data from this ongoing trial, as well as 
consideration of safety  and PK data at comparable drug exposure from patients in

3.5 Study Early Termination  
Hutchison MediPharma has the right to stop the study at any time.  The reasons for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_234560], but are not limited to: 
• The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studies indicates a potential health 
hazard to patients. 
• Patient  enrollment is unsatisfactory.

5.1.6 Dose and Administration 
After the SRC review of Co hort 2, the RP2D was declared as 5 mg QD, 3 weeks on/[ADDRESS_1002811] 
their fruquintinib dose escalated to 5 mg QD at the discretion of the investigator and with 
the agreement of the Sponsor. 
If baseline (pre- dose) PK blood samples need to be collected on the days of PK sample 
collection, patient s must take the investigational product after sampling  at site.  
It is recommended that fruquintinib be taken with water  (approximately 200 mL or 1 cup), 
[ADDRESS_1002812].  The administration time should be accurately recorded on the 
days of PK sampling. On the days of PK sampling, patients should avoid high- fat meals for the entire day  and 
avoid consumption of any liquids other than water (up to 200 mL ) within 1 hour before or 
after drug administration .  The patient is encouraged to avoid, or minimize the use of 
caffeine- containing foods or drinks, tobacco, tobacco products, and alcohol during the 
entire study.  If the patient cannot avoid taking any of the above listed substances during 
the study, it should be regarded as a habit and documented as demographic data. The following substances are prohibited during the study: grapefruit or grapefruit juice, 
illegal drug use, or excessive (> 1 drink/day) alcohol use. If patients miss a dose in the morning, a replacement dose can be taken before 6 pm on the 
same day.  Otherwise , the patient should not make up the missed dose, but should resume 
scheduled doses the next day per protocol.  The missed  dose should be reported to the 
investigators and recorded in the CRF.

be considered as DLT for purposes of dose escalation and MTD determination.  
● For any concomitant conditions already apparent at baseline, the dose modifications 
will apply according to the corresponding shift in toxicity grade, if the investigator feels it is appropriate.  For example, if a patient  has Grade 1 asthenia at baseline that 
increases to Grade 2 during treatment, this will be considered a shift of one grade and 
treated as Grade 1 toxicity for dose-modification purposes. 
● For toxicities that are considered by [CONTACT_150034] -threaten ing events, treatment will be continued at the same dose .  In 
addition, no dose reductions or interruptions will be required for anemia (non -
hemolytic) because it can be satisfactorily managed, unless serious (Grade ≥3) 
hemorrhage is present. 
● To recover from acute toxicity, unless otherwise indicated, the treatment can be interrupted for up to 14 days.  If a treatment delay longer than 14 days is required, the 
patient  should be discontinued from the study drug.  Continuation/resumption of 
fruquintinib  treatm ent after a n interruption of more than [ADDRESS_1002813] be discussed 
with the  medical monitor or his or her designee. 
● Where several toxicities with different grades or severity occur at the same time, the 
dose modifications should be according to the highest grade observed.

should be held until AE/toxicity resolves or improves to ≤Grade 1.  If a Grade  3 toxicity 
is expected to be manageable and reversible with a dose reductio n, treatment should be 
held until toxicity resolves to ≤Grade  1.  Patient s with Grade 3 non-haematologic toxicity

contraceptives, hormone -replacement t herapy , or other allowed maintenance therapy 
should continue their use.  Prophylactic use of anticoagulation for the maintenance of patency of permanent 
indwelling central venous access devices or for patients at high risk of venous 
thromboembolism is permitted during study treatment.  If patient s are receiving anti-
coagulation, they should be very closely monitored for potential haemorrhage, and:

monitored and maintained at the lower third of the therapeutic range (ie, 2.0 -2.3), 
unless a higher INR is required for anti-thrombotic efficacy.  
• Patient s who require low -molecular -weight heparin should receiv e the prophylactic

The investigator should closely monitor patients receiving anti -platelet and/or anti-
thrombotic drugs with INR, aPTT and platelet count during study drug trea tment  and make 
a timely decision on whether to continue or stop such drugs in patients that report Grade  ≥2 
haemorrhagic events at any site, based on an individual assessment of the risk- benefit 
balance (See Appendix J  for additional information on the clinical management of severe 
or serious haemorrhagic AEs).  
Patient s that develop arterial thromboembolic events should discontinue the study drug.  
If a patient suffers a venous thromboembolic event while still receiv ing study drug, it may 
still be possible for him or her to remain on study treatment under close monitoring and

All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will be given throughout the 
study. 
5.3.2 Excluded Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_149973]  (with the exceptions as noted above ), 
whether currently marketed or experimental, is prohibited.  This includes, but is not 
limited to, the following: c hemotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy, radiotherapy, 
or herbal therapy. 
Prophylactic antiemetic, granulocyte colony stimulating factors, granulocyt e macrophage 
colony-st imulating factors, platelet simulating factors or erythropoietin are not allowed  
during the DLT observation period in the dose escalation phase. 
Concomitant use of acid-reducing agents ( eg, proton pump inhibitors, histamine receptor 
antagonists, antacids) during the dose escalation phase should be avoided  as those agents 
may interfere with identifying reliable MTD and/or RP2D.  
Concomitant use of medications that have a known risk of causing QT prolongation and/or 
torsade de pointes (s ee “combined” list at http://www.qtdrugs.org, with attention to those

Palliative radiation for symptom  control is  allowed provided it does not compromise tumor 
assessments of target lesions.  However, f ruquintinib  treatment should be suspended 
during the radiation period and not resumed until at leas t 7 days after radiation only after 
meeting the following criteria:  
 Radiation related toxicities resolves to ≤Grade  2; 
 No disease progression observed.

The potential of pharmacokinetic drug- drug interaction was tested in vitro .  Fruquintinib 
was not a substrate of efflux transporters.  Fruquintinib showed dose -dependent inhibition 
on P -gp and BCRP.  Based on the data for digoxin transport (mediated by P -gp) and 
estrone-3- sulfate transport (mediated by [CONTACT_69811]), the IC 50 on P-gp and BCRP was estimated 
to be 4.60 and 1.29 µM, respectively.  
According to the  present metabolism data, enzymes CYP3A4/5 play an important role in 
the metabolism of fruquintinib.  Fruquintinib had no marked inhibitory effects on CYP s 
1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5 (IC 50 >10 µM) and no induction of CYP1A2, 
 and CYP3A4  at the tested concentration of 10 µM.  No marked time -dependent 
inhibition was observed for CYP S 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5. 
Substrates of P -gp and BCRP, and inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 should not be 
administered concomitantly with f ruquintinib, unless investigators consider it necessary .  
In this case, efficacy reduction and toxicity increases resulting from the interaction should 
be closely monitored.  Examples of t he medicines to avoid are listed in Appendix F .

for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site.  All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed by [CONTACT_733874]. 
Please see the Study Flowchart provided in Appendix A  for the schedule of screening and 
pre-treatment assessments.  Screening and pre -treatment tests will be performed within 
[ADDRESS_1002824] of

If during the DLT assessment window, 2 or more patients in a single cohort experience the 
same study drug- related Grade 3 toxicity that does not otherwise qualify as a DLT, the 
patients subsequently enrolled to this dose level and to the subsequent dose level will undergo increased monitoring during Cycle 1, as clinically indicated .  Note: DLTs will 
not be collected during the Dose Expansion Phase.

6.3.1 Vital Signs Assessment  
Vital signs will include measurements of body temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure while the patient is in a seated position.  The patient 
should be seated for approximately 5 minutes before the measurement of the blood pressure.  
For patient s with a baseline history of  hypertension, or those who develop hyperten sion 
during the study, blood pressure should be monitored daily by [CONTACT_44126], at

recorded in a blood pressure diary.  Patients monitoring their blood pressure should bring 
their diary to each study visit. 
6.3.2 Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination at screening should include the evaluation of head, eye, 
ear, nose, and throat; and cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastroin testinal, and neurological systems.  
At subsequent visits, a limited physical examination will be performed to assess changes from baseline abnormalities, any new abnormalities, and to evaluate patient -reported 
symptoms.  New or worsened abnormalities should be recorded as AEs if appropriate.   
In order to assess changes from baseline and screen for new abnormalities, the limited physical examination should assess for new or changed skin lesions, enlarged lymph nodes, and palpable masses.  Patient -reported sy mptoms should be directed to address the 
symptoms.  
Body height will be measured only at screening. 
6.3.3 Laboratory Tests  
Samples for hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis pregnancy, thyroid function, and 
specific tumor marker  testing will be analyzed at the study site ’s local laboratory.   
Laboratory assessments will include the following:  
Hematology (complete blood count [CBC], including red blood cell [RBC] count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, white blood cell [WBC] count with differential 
[neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and other cells], and platelet 
count; INR and aPTT ); 
Serum chemistry (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine  and creatinine clearance, sodium, 
potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, glucose, triglycerides , 
total bilirubin, total cholesterol, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase  (ALP) , lactate  
dehydrogenase [L DH], uric acid,  total protein and albumin); 
Serum pregnancy test at screening and at the Treatment Completion Visit for all women of 
childbearing potential, including those who have had a tubal ligation; 
Urine pregnancy test at each day [ADDRESS_1002827] had tubal ligation; 
Urinalysis ( pH, glucose, protein, and blood); 
Thyroid function (thyroid stimulating hormone [ TSH ], free T3, and free T4 ); and  
Specific tumor markers (tumor markers to be collected will be addressed in Section  6.4) 
The normal value range of laboratory examination indicators at the study site ’s local 
laboratory will be collected prior to the study.

(+ 15 minutes) post fruquintinib dose on Days [ADDRESS_1002828] s and other cardiac monitoring should be performed as clinically indicated 
during the study. 
6.4 Efficacy Assessments  
Tumor Assessment  
All measurable and evaluable lesions should be assessed and documented at screening and 
re-assessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation  (see Appendix A ).  A ssessments should 
include computed tomography (CT) scans with oral or IV contrast (unless contraindicated) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  MRI scans are allowed if CT contrast is 
contraindicated.  Other methods of assessment should be utilized as clinically indicated.  
Tumor assessments for dose escalation cohorts, Dose Expansion Cohort C, Dose 
Expansion Cohort D, and Dose Expansion Cohort E  are scheduled at Screening and 
every 8 weeks (±1 week) thereafter, ie, C3D1, C5D1, C7D1, etc. (odd- numbered cycles).  
Tumor assessments for Dose Expansion Cohort A and Dose Expansion Cohort B  are 
scheduled at Screening, C2D1, C3D1, C4D1, and every 8 weeks (±1 week) thereafter, ie, C6D1, C8D1, C10D1, etc. (even-numbered cycles).  
Subjects who permanently discontinue study drug for reasons other than progression of disease should continue to be followed for efficacy according to the schedule in Appendix A . 
All subjects are to have tumor assessments performed at the Treatment Completion visit, unless the subject was discontinued from treatment because of disease progression or the subject had tumor assessments performed within [ADDRESS_1002829] dose of study drug. 
At the investigato r’s discretion, CT scans may be repeated at any time if progressive 
disease is suspected . 
Disease status will be assessed using RECIST  Version  1.1 (see Appendix C ).  The same 
imaging procedure used to define measurable lesions at baseline must be used throughout 
the study for each patient. 
At the investigator’ s discretion, other methods of assessment of measurable disease as per 
RECIST may be used.  Examples of other assessment methods include tumor markers, 
such as prostate- specific antigen ( PSA) and cancer antigen 125 ( CA-125) levels for patients 
with prostate and ovarian cancer, respectively.  However, tumor markers alone cannot be 
used to assess response.  If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, the y must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete response.

7.[ADDRESS_1002831] include an email 
that describes the event and indicates which DLT criterion was met (see Section 3.1.1 c, 
Definition of a Dose -Limiting Toxicity).  The Sponsor ’s medical monitor must confirm 
that the event meets the DLT definition and communicate this back t o the investigator by 
[CONTACT_6968].  A notification of each DLT event will be distributed by [CONTACT_733875] .  DLT events are again reviewed  together with other safety data 
and PK data, at the SRC meeting upon completion of the DLT window of each dose cohort. 
NOTE:   Reporting of DLTs is not required during the dose expansion phase. 
7.1.3 Serious Adverse Events  and other AEs that require Expedited Reporting  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event D efinition  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that has any of the following characteristics : 
• Fatal ( ie, the AE actually causes or leads to death, except for deaths caused by [CONTACT_733876] ) 
• Life threatening ( ie, the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the patient  at 
immediate risk of deat h) 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (excluding emergency or outpatient 
treatment) 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (ie,  the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the patient’ s ability to conduct normal life functio ns)

female partner of a male patient  exposed to the investigational product(s) 
• Considered as a significant medical event by [CONTACT_093] (eg, may jeopardize 
the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above) 
• If an AE me ets any of the above serious criteria, the AE should be reported to the 
sponsor as an SAE no more than 24 hours after awareness of the SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Potential Drug -Induced Liver Injury  
The investigator is required to discontinue study drug immediately and report  all potential 
events of drug- induced liver injury ( DILI ), as defined below, regardless of whether it is a 
non-serious or serious AE to the sponsor no more than 24 hours after learning of the event.  
• Serum  AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN. 
This combination of lab abnormalities meets the biochemical criteria for Hy ’s law, which 
is associated with a markedly increased possibility of seve re DILI, and may progress to 
liver transplantation or death .  Some patients may present with symptoms such as: fatigue, 
nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%).  If Hy ’s law is met, fruquintinib should be immediately discontinued, and patients 
need to be very closely monitored ( bilirubin, ALP, AST, ALT  measured 2 -3 times weekly 
until the results return to baseline  or normal ), and other causes of liver injury evaluated ( eg, 
new or worsening hepatobili ary metastases; non -malignant biliary obstruction; viral 
hepatitis A, B, or C; alcoholic or autoimmune hepatitis; preexisting or acute liver disease; 
ischemic liver injury; right -sided congestive heart failure; new or worsening liver 
metastases; or concomitant medication that could cause the observed injury).  
Consultation with a gastroenterologist or hepat ologist should be considered. 
The findings described above must be reported to the sponsor no more than 24 hours after awareness of the event.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Severe He morrhagic Events  
When a hemorrhagic event meet s NCI CTCAE ≥ Grade 3 severity (regardless of  whether 
it is serious or non- serious), the event should be reported to the sponsor no more than 
[ADDRESS_1002832] dose of study drug or a new treatment of anti -tumor therapy , 
whichever is earlier .  After this period , investigators sho uld report only SAEs that are

7.1.5 Eliciting Adverse Events 
A consistent methodology of non- directive questioning for eliciting AEs at all patient 
evaluation time points should be adopted.  Examples of non- directive q uestions include:  
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?” 
“Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?”  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1002833].  All AEs 
and SAEs, whether reported by [CONTACT_733877], will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the appropriate AE/SAE form. 
For each AE and SAE recorded on the applicable CRF, the investigator will make an 
assessment of severity through clinical description by [CONTACT_150042] -grade 
determination standard in the NCI CTCAE  v4.03.  Please use the guideline below for the 
assessment of severity when the observed or reported AE is not  listed  in the NCI CTCAE  
v4.03: 
• Grade 1: mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated  
• Grade  2: moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)*. 
• Grade 3: severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self-
care ADL**.  
• Grade 4: l ife-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5: death related to AE.

*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, 
taking medications, and not bedridden. 
7.1.7 Causality of Adverse Events  
The investigator will assess causal relationship between study drug and each AE .  
For SAEs , a causal relationship will also be assessed for concomitant medication s, study 
proce dures and additional study drug, etc.  A guide line to the interpretation of causality is 
provided in Appendix G . 
7.1.8 Recording Adverse Events  
When an AE or SAE is recorded, the preferred medical terminology or concept should be 
used.  Abbreviations and colloquialisms (eg, jargon or slang)  should be avoided.  All 
AEs (including SAEs) should be recorded in the CRF on the AE page. 
All AEs (including SAEs) would be recorded on the AE CRF, and the check box for 
“Serious ” woul d be ticked for entries that fit the criteria for SAEs.  The investigator would 
also complete an SAE report and submit this to the sponsor or its designee within 24 hours 
of knowledge of the event.  
Only one medical concept should be recorded in the event field on the CRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis vs Symptoms and Signs  
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the CRF rather than individual signs and 
symptoms ( eg, record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and 
elevated transaminases).  Howev er, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be 
medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF.  If a diagnosis is 
subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up information. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events ( eg, cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should be identified by [CONTACT_733878] .  For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have resulted in 
dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the CRF  if the 
dehydration is mild.  
However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are 
separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF.  For example, if 
a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on the CRF.

A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between patient 
evaluation time points .  Such events should only be recorded once in the CRF.  The 
event’ s initial severity should be recorded and updated when it increases so as to record to 
highest severity.  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs , resolves between patient  evaluation time points, and 
subsequently recurs .  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on the CRF  respectively . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values or Abno rmal Vital Signs  
Not every laboratory abnormality/abnormal vital sign  qualifies as an AE.  A laboratory 
test result /abnormal vital sign  must be reported as an AE if it is a change from baseline and 
meets any of the following criteria:  
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_733879]  
• Results in a change in study treatment ( eg, dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)  
• Results in a medical intervention (eg, potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy  
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
It is the investigator ’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings  and abnormal vital 
signs.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding if an isolated 
laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.  
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (eg, 
ALP and bilirubin 5 × ULN associated with cholecystitis), only the diagnosis ( eg, 
cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the CRF.  
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF.  If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the cl inical term should be 
recorded as the AE or SAE.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 
7.0 mmol/L should be recorded as “ hyperkalemia. ” 
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should not be re peatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF, unless their severity, 
seriousness, or etiology changes.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Death  
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period that are attributed by 
[CONTACT_733880]/SAE .  All 
other on- study deaths, regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the AE 
CRF and immediately reported to the sponsor.  When a death is recorded, the underlying 
condition that caused or primarily contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported 
expeditiously as an SAE and death listed as the outcome of the event on the CRF.  If the 
primary cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting,

should be expeditiously reported as a SAE before further investigations into the specific 
cause of death .  If the death is attributed to progression of disease, it should not be 
recorded or reported as an AE/ SAE but the investigator will record the death on the End of 
Treatment and End of Study CRF s as appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Condition  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at screening .  Such conditions 
should be recorded on the CRF  as medical history .  A preexisting medical condition 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of  the 
condition worsens during the study (excluding deterioration of the study disease 
conditions) .  When such events are  recorded on the CRF, it is important to convey the 
concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] ( eg, 
“more frequent headaches”).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or Surgery  
The investigator must document any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_733828] 1 or more of the following reasons: 
• To undergo an efficacy measurement for the study  
• To u ndergo a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a preexisting medical 
condition that has not changed 
• To receive scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study  
In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_733829] a SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy  
A female patient must be instructed to stop taking the study drug and immediately inform 
the investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study.  The investigator should report 
all pregnancies within 24 hours to the sponsor (the reporting period for pregna ncy 
continues up to 30 days after completion of the study drug).  The investigator should 
counsel the patient  and discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible 
effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the 
pregnancy.  Pregnancies occurring up to [ADDRESS_1002835] dose of study drug.  If 
such an event occurs, it should be reported as described above. Spontaneous a bortion should always be classified as serious (as the sponsor considers these 
medically significant), recorded on the CRF, and expeditiously reported to spons or. 
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient  or female partner 
of a male patient exposed to the investigational product should be recorded and reported as 
an SAE.

Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (continuous data) and/or contingency 
tables (categorical data) for demographic and baseline characteristics, efficacy 
measurements, safety measurements, and PK measurements.  Information regarding 
compliance with disease assessments and availability of data will be documented.  
Graphical techniques (eg, waterfall plots, Kaplan -Meier curves) will be used when such 
methods are appropriate and informative.  The baseline value used in each analysis will 
be the last (most recent) pre- treatment value.  Analyses w ill be based upon the observed 
data unless methods for handling missing data are specified.  Analyses will be performed

8.1 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations are defined for the study: 
• Safety Analysis S et (SAS): This population includes all patient s who have received 
at least one dose of fruquintinib .  Safety data will be evaluated based on this 
population’ s outcome.  Patient s in the SAS will be analyzed by [CONTACT_733881].  If patie nts have dose reduction  during the study, all data will be 
summarized/analyzed based on the initial dose of study drug received.   
• Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKAS): This population will include a ll patients 
who received at least one dose of fruquintinib  and have at least 1 PK sample 
obtained and analyzed. 
• Efficacy Analysis Set ( EAS): This population includes all patients who have 
received at least [ADDRESS_1002841] dosing date, duration of study treatment, analysis set in which the  
patient  is included and disposition.  In the patient disposition listing, reason for study drug  
discontinuation will be included.  A table will be created to summarize these categories 
in terms of number and percent for each of the analysis set defined ab ove. 
Patient d emographics and baseline characteristics, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, weight, 
type of malignancy, duration of malignancy, site of metastatic disease, and baseline ECOG performance status, will be listed and summarized .  All summaries will be presented 
overall, by [CONTACT_15994], and by [CONTACT_733882].

be used by [CONTACT_283680]: Grade  1 
(mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life threatening), or Grade  5 (fatal)  
(see Section  7.1.6).  All AEs will be coded with Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA).   
All AEs will be listed.  The focus of safety data summarization will be on treatment -
emergent adverse events  (TEAEs) , which are defined  as AEs that occur or worsen in the 
period extending from the first dose of study drug to [ADDRESS_1002843] dose of study 
drug in this study. 
TEAEs will be summarized as the number of patients and corresponding percentage by 
[CONTACT_7204] (SOC) as well as Preferred Term (PT).  The incidence of 
TEAEs, SAEs, adverse event s of special interest  (AESIs) , AEs leading to dose interruption, 
reduction, or treatment discontinuation will be presented by [CONTACT_3592]; by [CONTACT_733883] i nvestigational product and by [CONTACT_733884].  Changes in 
laboratory data will be summarized by  [CONTACT_733885] v4.03.

maximum value, geometric mean value and geometric mean CV%  will be reported.  
Individual and mean plasma fruquintinib concentration versus time data will be tabulated 
and presented.  The individual and mean PK parameters based on  the fruquintinib 
concentration versus time data, will include, but not be limited to total plasma exposure 
(AUC 0-t and AUC 0∞∞-∞), maximum plasma concentration (C max), apparent clearance 
(CL/F), and apparent volume of distribution ( Vz/F).  The terminal half -life ( t1/2) will also 
be estimated.  The actual times of plasma sample collection will be used for the PK  
analysis.

• Cmax: the maximum observed plasma concentration over the sampling period, taken 
directly from the data.  
• Tmax: time to reach  Cmax, taken directly from the data.  
• The first -order rate constant associated with the negative slope of the terminal 
portion of the log- linear concentration -time curve .  A minimum of three points 
will be used. 
• Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) to be determined by 
[CONTACT_51715]  (linear up/log down), where AUC 0-t is the AUC from time zero 
until the last concentration point and AUC 0∞∞-∞ is the AUC 0-t + last concentration 
point divided by [CONTACT_733886] (K e). 
• Half-life (t 1/2) to be determined according to t 1/2 = 0.693/K e where possible.  
• CL/F: apparent systemic clearance to be determined according to dose/ AUC 0∞∞-∞ 
• Vz/F: apparent volume of distribution, determined according to CL /F/K e 
• Accumulation ratio: AUC Day1 4/AUC Day1 or AUC Day21/AUC Day1 
Where the concentration data are missing or  listed as less than the l ower limit of 
quantification, they will be regarded as zero (0) if occurring before C max.  After C max, zero 
points will not be included in calculations. 
Individual and mean fruquintinib concentrations will be plotted by [CONTACT_15994].  Pharmacokinetic analysis of fruquintinib and its metabolites will be performed using the 
same technology. Venous blood samples for determination of concentrations of fruquintinib in plasma will 
be taken at the times presented in Appendix D .  If dose interruption occurs more than 
5 days (including 5 days) of PK sampling, the blood taking should be cancelled or at 
investigator’ s discretion.  The date and time of collection of  each sample and the date and 
time of dose will be recorded.  
8.5 Efficacy Analysis  
The efficacy endpoints include PFS, ORR, DCR, and OS .  Efficacy data will be listed and 
summarized by [CONTACT_733887].  
The ORR and DCR will be summarized with percentages and 95% exact confidence 
intervals.  The PFS rate at week 12 (Cohorts B a nd C)  and week 16 (Cohort s D and E ) and 
its 95% confidence intervals will be esti mated by [CONTACT_8761]- Meier method .  PFS, DoR, 
and OS  will be summarized descriptively using Kaplan -Meier medians and quartiles.  
Percentage change in tumor size from baseline will be determined for patients with measurable disease at baseline and derived at  each visit by [CONTACT_733888]:  09 Jan 2020                                 Confidential                            79/144

change in tumor size will be summarized using descriptive statistics and presented using a 
waterfall plot.  
Objective Response Ra te (ORR ) 
The ORR is defined as the percentage of patient s with at least one best overall response 
(BOR) of CR or PR according to RECIST Version  1.1.  To be assigned a status of PR or 
CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_733889] [ADDRESS_1002845] evaluable visit response.  
Disease Control Rate ( DCR)  
Disease control rate is defined as the percentage of patients with a best overall response of 
CR, PR, or SD.  
Progression Free Survival (PFS)  
Progression free survival is defined as the time from date of first dose of study drug until 
the date of an objective disease progression as defined by [CONTACT_393] v1.[ADDRESS_1002846] evaluable objective tumor assessment before the cut -off date or the antitumor therapy start date.

Duration of response is defined as the time from date of the first objective response,  CR or 
PR, whichever comes first , until the occurrence of documented disease progression or 
death in the absence of disease progression.  If a patient does not progress following a 
response, then the DoR will be censored at the same time of PFS.  
Percentage Change in T umor Size  from  Baseline  
Percentage change in tumor size will be determined for patients with measurable disease 
at baseline and is derived at each visit by [CONTACT_733890] s compared to baseline. 
Overall Survival (OS) 
Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of the first dos e of study drug until the 
date of death (any cause).  Patients who did not die  at the time of the statistical analysis 
will be censored at the time at which they were last known to be alive.  
8.6 Determination of Sample Size  
The total number of patients enrolled will depend on the number of dose escalations and 
the need to further characterize individual cohorts of single -agent fruquintinib administered 
at the RP2D.  
Dose Escalation Phase  
The sample size may vary depending on the number of dose levels evaluated and the number of DLTs observed in each cohort.  Patients who are considered not evaluable for 
DLT or PK will be replaced.  The sample size may increase when these patients are 
replaced.  
Dose Expansion Phase 
The primary objective of the dose expansion phase  is to evaluate the anticancer activity of 
fruquintinib in patients with advanced solid tumors, treated at the RP2D from the dose 
escalation phase. 
Approximately 6 patients with advanced , refractory  solid tumors of any type will be 
enrolled in Cohort A .  This sample size is not based on a formal statistical assumption.  
Additionally, enrollment in disease specific cohorts is planned as follows:  
• 40 patients in Cohort B (refractory mCRC with progression on TAS -102 and/or 
regorafenib )  
• 40 patients in Cohort C ( refractory mCRC that has progressed on standard 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_733830]-102 or 
regorafenib)  
• 15 patients in Cohort D ( HR+/Her2 - mBC )  
• 15 patients in Cohort E [triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)]     
The number of pat ients in each cohort can provide adequate precision for the estimated 
incidence rates of patients having a specific AE, patients with CR/PR (ORR), patients with

10.1 Source Data Verification  
Study monitors will perform ongoing source document verification to  confirm that critical 
protocol data ( ie, source data) entered into the CRFs by [CONTACT_26831], complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, memoranda, patient diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing 
records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_733832], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, patient  files, and records kept at the 
pharmacy, laboratories, and medico- technical departments i nvolved in a clinical trial.  
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data entered into the CRFs must never be obliterated or destroyed. 
To facilitate source document verification, the investigator(s) and institution(s) must 
provide the sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial -
related monitoring, sponsor audits, and IEC/ IRB review.  The investigational site must 
also allow inspection by [CONTACT_112103]. 
10.2 Use of Computerized System  
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site ’s computerized 
medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can 
serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with FDA requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research.  An acceptable 
computerized data collection system (for clinical research purposes) would be one that (1) allows data entry only by [CONTACT_4539];  (2) prevents the deletion or alteration of 
previously entered data and provides an audit trail for such data changes ( eg, modification 
of file); (3) protects the database from tampering; and (4) ensures data preservation.  
If a site ’s computerized medical record system is not adequately validated for the purposes 
of clinical research (as opposed to general clinical practice), applicable hardcopy source documents must be maintained to ensure that critical protocol data entered into the CRFs can be verified.  
10.3 Retention of Records  
US FDA regulations (21 CFR §312.62[c]) and the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) require that records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study 
and the distribution of investigational drug, including CRFs, cons ent forms, laboratory test 
results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_8178] [ADDRESS_1002848].  All state and local laws for retention of records also apply .  No 
records should be disposed of without the written approval of Hutchison MediPharma.  
Written notification should be provided to H utchison MediPharma for transfer of any 
records to another party or moving them to another location.

It is understood that the responsible  Hutchison MediPharma  monitor (or designee) will 
contact [CONTACT_733891] a llowed, on request, to inspect the 
various records of the trial (CRFs and other pertinent data) provided that patient 
confidentiality is maintained in accord with local requirements.  
It will be the monitor’ s responsibility to inspect the CRFs at regular in tervals throughout 
the study and to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, 
and accuracy of the data being entered on them.  The monitor should have access to 
laboratory test reports and other patient  records needed to verif y the entries on the CRF.   
The investigator (or deputy) agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected during these monitoring visits are resolved.  
[ADDRESS_1002849] Operational Procedures.  
Accurate and reliable data collection will be assured by [CONTACT_89836]–check of the 
CRFs against the investigator ’s records by [CONTACT_11200] (source document 
verification], and the maintenance of a drug-dispensing log by [CONTACT_093].  
The sponsor or its agent will be responsible for data management of this study  according 
to data management documents .  Any decision to use the CRF as a source document must 
be stated in the Data Validation Manual and the investigator must be advised of this 
decision.  A comprehensive validation check program will verify the data and discrepancy 
will be generated accordingly .  In the event of discrepant data, the sponsor or its agent 
will issue data queries to the site and request data clarification .  Site is  required to respond 
to all queries and promptly enter date into  the EDC system.  
The CRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system ’s audit trail .  
System backups for data stored by [CONTACT_733892]’s standard procedures.  
In order to facilitate analysis of the biological samples collected in this study, the treatment 
code will be released  to the responsible analytical person when the samples have been 
received at the analytical site and are ready for assay.  The result of the analysis must not 
be released with individual identification of the patient  until the database is closed.

Note:  
1． A written informed consent form should be obtained prior to any protocol -specific procedure or test.  Tests completed within 28 
days prior to enrollment can be used for screening and do not need to be repeated (except hematology, coa gulation test, clinical 
chemistry, or urinalysis  results) . 
2． Unless otherwise indicated, the visit window during the treatment period will be ± 3 days ( ± 1 day during cycle 1 ). 
3． Patient s who complete or prematurely discontinue the study need to return to the study site for a follow -up at 30 (±7) days after 
the decision to discontinue treatment permanently.  Ongoing AEs will be followed until the event has resolved to baseline grade, 
the event is assessed as stable by [CONTACT_093], new anti -tumor treatment is initiated, the patient is lost to follow -up, the patient 
withdraws consent, or when it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause of the AE. 
4． The treatment completion visit tumor assessment can be omitted if treatment ended because of disease progression or the patient 
had a tumor assessment within [ADDRESS_1002856] dose of study drug. 
5． Concomitant medication includes any prescribed or over -the-counter medicines.  All medication used by [CONTACT_341948] 7 days 
before screening and 30 days after study treatment completion should be recorded.  At each visit, all medication used since the 
prior visit should be recorded.

antihypertensive medications, blood pressure should be monitored at 3 hours (±2 hours) after the daily doses of anti -hypertensive 
medication. 
7． Please refer to Section  6.3.2 for the assessments that should be completed as part of the Complete and Limited Physical Exams.  
8． Hematology consists of complete blood count, including red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, whit e 
blood cell count with differential (neutrophils,  bands, lymphocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, basophils, and other cells), and platelet 
count. 
9． The chemistry panel includes blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and creatinine clearance, sodium, potassium, chlorine, bicarbonate, 
calcium,  magnesium, phosphorus, glucose, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin (total), aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline 
phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, total cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, protein (total) and albumin. 
10． Urinalysis includes pH, glucose, protein, and blood.  A 24-hour urine should be collected from all patients with >1+ proteinuria 
for quantitative test of urine protein during the screening.  If protein ≥2+ during the period of study treatment, a 24- hour urine 
test should be conducted within 1 week. 
11． MUGAs are permitted if echocardiograms cannot be performed.  
12． Includes free T3, free T4, and thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH).  
13． Women of childbearing potential will receive a serum pregnancy test during screening and within [ADDRESS_1002857] on Day 1 of each 28- day cycle beginning at Cycle 2.  If pregnancy is suspected, additional 
tests should be completed.  In the case of menopausal women, the date of menopause onset should be recorded. 
14． CA125 level for patients with ovarian c ancer , PSA for patients with prostate cancer , or other tumor marker s (as appropriate) should 
be obtained as clinically indicated or with each tumor assessment.  
15． On Days 1 and 15 in Cycle 1, ECG should be performed at pre -dose and at 3  hours (± 15 minutes) post- dose (around C max after 
single dose and at steady state in order to evaluate concentration -QT relationship for fruquintinib).  Untimed ECG will be 
conducted on Day [ADDRESS_1002858]. 
16． After informed consent, all SAEs  and concomitan t medications  will be collected.   After initiation of study drug, all AEs and 
SAEs will be collected until [ADDRESS_1002859] dose of study drug or a new treatment of anti -tumor therapy, whichever is 
earlier.   After this period , investigators should report only SAEs that are considered to be related to the study drug.

 Patient  Eligibility  
Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in  protocols where 
objective tumor response is the primary endpoint .  Measurable disease is defined as the 
presence of at least one measurable lesion.  
In studies where the primary endpoint is tumor progression (either time to progression or 
proportion with progression at a fixed date), the protocol must specify if entry is restricted to those with measurable disease or whether patient s having non- measurable 
disease only are also eligible.  
Methods of Assessment  
• The same method of assessment and the same tech nique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  CT is the best 
currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response 
assessment.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( eg, for body scans but not 
for lung). 
• Lesions on a chest X -ray may be considered measurable lesions if they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
• Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and 
≥10 mm in diameter , as assessed using calipers.  For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
• Ultrasound (US) should not be used to measure tumor lesions.  
• Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially above 
the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete 
response.  
• Cytology and histology can be used in rare cases ( eg, for evaluation of residual masses 
to differentiate between Partial Response and Complete Response or evaluation of new or enlarging effusions to differentiate between Progressive Disease and Response/Stable Disease).  
• Use of endoscopy and laparoscopy is not  advised.  However, they can be used to 
confirm complete pathological response.  
Baseline Disease Assessment  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.

measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• [ADDRESS_1002861] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm; when CT sc ans have 
slice thickness >5 mm, the minimum size should be twice the slice thickness).  
• 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions that cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable).  
• [ADDRESS_1002862] X- ray.  
Mali gnant Lymph Nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_1002863] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness is recommended to be no greater than 5 mm) .  At baseline and in follow -up, 
only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesio ns with identifiable soft tissue components 
that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be 
considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability 
described above.  
“Cystic  lesions” thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered measurable if 
they meet the definition of measurability described above .  However, if non- cystic lesions 
are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
Non-measurable Lesions  
Non-measurable lesions are all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter 
<10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with 10 to <15 mm short axis), as well as truly non -
measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non- measurable includ e: leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_733900] t echniques.  Blastic bone 
lesions are non -measurable.  
Lesions with prior local treatment, such as those situated in a previously irradiated area or in an area treated with other loco -regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable 
unless there has b een demonstrated progression in the lesion.  Study protocols should 
detail the conditions under which such lesions would be considered measurable.  
Target Lesions  
• All measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and 
recorded and measured at baseline.  
• Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and be representative of all involved orga ns, as well as their suitability for 
reproducible repeated measurements.  
• All measurements should be recorded in metric notation using calipers if clinically assessed.

target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters, which will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, only the short axis will contribute.  
Non-target Lesions  
All lesions (or sites of disease) not identified as target lesions, including pathological lymph nodes and all non- measurable lesions, should be identified as non- target lesions and be 
recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required and they should be 
followed as “ presen t,” “absent ,” or in rare cases, “unequivocal progression.” 
Evaluation of Target L esions  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this may include the baseline sum).  The 
sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD.  
Special Notes on the Assessment of Target L esions  
Lymph nodes identified, as target lesions should always have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded even if th e nodes regress to below 10 mm on study.  When lymph 
nodes are included as target lesions, the “sum” of lesions may not be zero even if complete 
response criteria are met since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of <10 mm.  
Target lesion s that become “too small to measure ”: While on study, all lesions (nodal and 
non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded  at each 
subsequent evaluation, even when very small.  However, sometimes lesions or lymph 
nodes become so faint on a CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being “too small to measure” , in which case a 
default value of 5 mm should be assigned. 
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment: Wh en non- nodal lesions “fragment,” the longest 
diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion 
sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would 
aid in obtaining maximal diame ter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions 
have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the “coalesced lesion ”.

Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non- target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker levels.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm short 
axis).  
Non-CR / Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target les ion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker levels above normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  When  
patient  has measurable disease, to achieve “unequivocal progression ‟ on the basis of the 
non-target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non- target 
disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden 
has increased sufficiently to merit discon tinuation of therapy.  A modest “increase” in the 
size of one or more non- target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal 
progression status.  
When patient has only non- measurable disease:  There is no measurable disease 
assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non- measurable disease burden.  
Because worsening in non- target disease cannot be easily quantified, a useful test that can 
be applied is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on change in non- measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to 
declare PD for measurable disease.  Examples include an incre ase in a pleural effusion 
from “trace ” to “large ” or an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread.  
New Lesions  
The appe arance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression:  
• The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal ( ie, not attributable to differences 
in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor, especially when the patient ’s baseline lesions show 
partial or complete response).  
• If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow- up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repe at scans 
confirm there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
• A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and disease progression.  
It is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission tomography ( FDG- PET) scanning to complement CT in assessment of 
progression (particularly possible “new” disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET 
imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
Negative FDG- PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is PD based on a 
No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  
• If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed 
by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  
Date: 09 Jan 2020                          Confidential                                    99/144

additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that  site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG- PET scan).  
• If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre- existing site of disease on 
CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
Time Point Response  
Below is a summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patient s 
who have measurable disease at baseline: Patients with target (+/ – non- target) disease.  
 
Confirmation  
In non- randomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR and 
CR is required to ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement error.  This 
will also permit appropriate interpretation of results in the context of historical data where response has traditi onally required confirmation in such trials.  However, in all other 
circumstances, ( ie, in randomized phase 2  or 3 trials or studies where stable disease or 
progression are the primary endpoints), confirmation of response is not required since it will not add value to the interpretation of trial results.  However, elimination of the 
requirement for response confirmation may increase the importance of central review to protect against bias, in particular in studies that are not blinded. 
In the case of SD, me asurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study 
entry at a minimum interval (in general not less than 6–8 weeks) that is defined in the study 
protocol.  
Missing Assessments and Inevaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not 
evaluable (NE) at that time point.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an 
assessment, usually the case is also considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing 
argument can be made  that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not 
change the assigned time point response.  This would most likely happen in the case of 
PD.  
Reporting of Results  
• All patient s included in the study must be assessed for response to treat ment, even if 
there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient

response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from  malignant 
disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). 
• All the patient s who met the eligibility criteria should be included in the main analysis 
of the response rate. Patient s in response categories 4 -9 should be considered as failing 
to respond to treatment (disease progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule 
or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate. Precise definitions for categories 4 -9 will be protocol specific.  
• All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients.  
• Subanalyses may then be performed on the basis of a subset of patient s, excluding those 
for whom major protocol deviations have been identified (eg, early death due to other 
reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.).  However, 
these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be 
clearly reported.  
• The 95% confidence intervals should be provided.

Appendix D -2 (dose expansion phase).  The exact times and dates of blood sampling are 
to be recorded in the CRFs. 
Blood samples (2 mL) for fruquintinib phar macokinetics will be collected into sodium 
heparinate vacutainers.  The tubes will be immediately inverted gently at least 5 times to 
mix the blood and then placed in ice bath prior to centrifugation.  The tubes will be 
centrifuged at approximately 1000 g and 4oC for 10 minutes, after which the plasma will 
be transferred immediately into 2 clean prelabeled  tubes.  Approximately 0.5 mL plasma 
will be placed in each tube (Tube A and Tube B).  After the tubes are tightly capped, the 
samples should be stored im mediately at -20°C or ˗80°C.  The whole process of plasma 
collection should be completed within 2 hours of the blood sampling.  According to the 
present results of plasma stability, fruquintinib can be stored at ˗20°C and at ˗80°C for 133 
days.  For long- term storage, it is recommended that the plasma samples be stored at 
˗80°C. Each sample will be identified by [CONTACT_454779], study number, patient number and 
initials, and sample time point identifier (i.e. 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hour s etc.).  Tube B 
samples must be labeled as “duplicate.” 
All plasma samples will be shipped on dry ice to the central laboratory within 30 days of 
sample collection.  The dry ice should be sufficient to keep the samples frozen during the 
whole shipment period.  The samples of Tube B are shi pped out after the prior batch of 
Tube A has been received safely by [CONTACT_2237].  Tube A samples will be used 
for bioanalysis.  Tube B samples will be stored in ˗80°C freezer for future use.  The 
laboratory should be notified at least 1 day prior to the arrival of the sample and be provided 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_733833]. 
Prior to shipment, a PK sample requisition form (containing the details of each 
sample/label identification included in the shipment) will be prepared.  All sample 
correspondence must contain the study number, study drug, and Site references (including emergency contact [CONTACT_454780]).  All of the sample 
details on this log must match the details included on the individual sample labels, as each sample label will be checked against the list by [CONTACT_454781]’ sample coordination personnel.  The log should be reviewed by [CONTACT_454782] a second individual for

Fruquintinib is not a substrate of efflux transporters.  Fruquintinib showed dose -
dependent inhibition on P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and breast cancer  resistance protein ( BCRP). 
Based on the data for digoxin transport (mediated by P -gp) and estrone -3-sulfate transport 
(mediated by [CONTACT_69811]), the IC 50 on P-gp and BCRP was estimated to be 4.60 and 1.29 µM, 
respectively.  
According to the present metabolism data, cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4/5 play an 
important role in the metabolism of fruquintinib.  Fruquintinib had no marked reversibly 
inhibitory effects on CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5 (IC 50 >10 µM) and 
no induction of CYP1A2,  and CYP3A4 at the tested concentration of 10 µM.  
No marked t ime-dependent inhibition was observed for CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, and 3A4/5. 
A series of CYP3A4 strong inducers and strong inhibitors are listed in Table s F-1 and F2 
below.  Patients who received a CYP3A4 strong inducer or strong inhibitor within  
2 weeks ( 3 weeks for hyperforin perforatum treatment) prior to the first dose of the study 
drug will not be allowed to participate in the study.  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_733836] P -gp and BCRP are listed in  Table F -3 below.  During the study, 
substrates of P -gp and BCRP, and strong inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_1002867] CYP3A4 activity and to be substrates of P -gp and BCRP should be used with

all concomitant medications should be reviewed.

• Consistency with known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class?  Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological 
properties?  
• Dechallenge experience.  Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_733838]? 
• No alternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11693] , 
such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors. 
• Rechallenge experience.  Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped?  HMPL would not normally recommend or support a rechallenge.  
• Laboratory tests.  A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed 
the relationship?  
A “reasonable possibility ” could be considered to exist for an AE where [ADDRESS_1002869], there would not be a “reasonable possibility ” of cau sality if none of the above 
criteria apply or where there is evidence of exposure and a reasonable time course but any 
dechallenge (if performed) is negative or ambiguous or there is another more likely cause 
of the AE. 
In difficult cases, other factors co uld be considered such as: 
• Is this a recogni zed feature of overdose of the drug? 
• Is there a known mechanism?  
Ambiguous cases should be considered as being a “reasonable possibility ” of a causal 
relationship unless further evidence becomes available to refu te this.  Causal relationship 
in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of effect should be 
classified as no reasonable possibility.

If ALT or AST is elevated to higher than [ADDRESS_1002870], fruquintinib treatment should be discontinued immediately, and supportive 
treatment should be given. T  his combination of lab abnormalities meet s the biochemical 
criteria for Hy ’s law, which is associated with a markedly increased possibility of severe 
drug- induced liver injury (DILI), and may progress to liver transplantation or death (FDA 
Guidance for Industry - Drug -Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation.   
FDA, 2009). 
If the biochemical criteria for Hy ’s law are met, fruquintinib should be immediately 
discontinued, and patients need to be very closely monitored (bilirubin, ALP, AST, and 
ALT measured 2 -3 times weekly until the res ults return to baseline or normal), and other 
causes of liver injury evaluated ( eg, new or worsening hepatobiliary metastases; non-
malignant biliary obstruction; viral hepatitis A, B, or C; alcoholic or autoimmune hepatitis; 
preexisting or acute liver dise ase; ischemic liver injury; right- sided congestive heart failure; 
new or worsening liver metastases; or concomitant medication that could cause the 
observed injury).  Consultation with a gastroenterologist or hepatologist should be 
considered. 
If the bioch emical criteria for Hy ’s Law have been met, expedited reporting is required 
(see Section 7.1.2), before waiting for the evaluation of other causes to be completed.  
 
Recommended Data Collection for Suspected DIL I 
The investigator is recommended to obtain the following information, so as to further 
evaluate and follow up and complete the clinical data.  Data should be recorded on CRFs 
where possible, and supplemented by [CONTACT_733902]:  
• Medical history of the patient 
o Detailed history of current symptoms, diagnosis of complications and medical history  
o Previous medical history (viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, autoimmune disease, biliary tract disease and cardiovascular di sease, etc.)  
o History of concomitant medication (including OTC and prescription drugs, herbal medicine and dietary supplements), alcohol consumption, recreational drugs and special diet 
o History of exposure to potentially hepatotoxic chemicals 
• Complete the f ollowing laboratory tests:  
o Haematology 
o Clinical biochemistry: ALT, AST, bilirubin (including total bilirubin and direct bilirubin), ALP , albumin, prothrombin time or INR, amylase, fasting 
blood glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides 
o Other Serum Tests: Hepatitis A (Anti- IgM and Anti -IgG), hepatitis B (HbsAg, 
Anti-HBs and HBV DNA), hepatitis C (Anti -HCV, and HCV RNA test is 
required for any patient with positive test result), hepatitis D (Anti-IgM and Anti -IgG), hepatitis E (Anti- HEV and Anti -HEV IgM).

o Patients with confirmed elevation of ALT/AST combined with TBili are 
required to receive abdominal ultrasonography or other clinically applicable imaging examination within 48 hours (to exclude biliary tract, pancreat ic, or 
intrahepatic causes, such as new or worsening hepatobiliary metastases or biliary calculi) and obtain the liver imaging result as soon as possible. If an alternative cause (such as biliary tract, pancreatic, or intrahepatic causes) of abnormal hepat ic results cannot be confirmed by [CONTACT_9661], paracentesis is 
recommended for pathological examination after obtaining consent of the patient;  
o If suspected cardiovascular causes exist, cardiac ultrasonography is recommended to exclude cardiovascular dysfunction ( ie, right heart failure);  
Long- term follow -up: Perform close monitoring on the patient through repetitive tests of 
ALT, AST and bilirubin (including total bilirubin and direct bilirubin) two to three times weekly until the laboratory ALT and/or AST abnormality becomes stable or recovers, and then proceed according to the protocol.

Hypertension is a common AE that has been reported in patients taki ng angiogenesis 
inhibitors (Izzedine, et al 2009[15]), including fruquintinib.  Grade [ADDRESS_1002871] been 
reported in 16% of patients treated with fruquintinib; no Grade [ADDRESS_1002872] of VE GFR inhibitors (either 
antibodies or small molecules).  
There is no standard therapy for angiogenesis inhibitor -induced hypertension because there 
have not been any published controlled clinical trials with specific agents.  Therefore, one 
can take an approach based on the clinical characteristics of particular patients.  Calcium 
channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are a reasonable first choice in most cases.  For patients with proteinuria, chronic renal disease or 
metabolic disease, an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) may be 
preferred; for elderly patients, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may be preferred.   
In this appendix is a summary of the most recent American Heart Association 
(AHA)/Americ an College of Cardiology (ACC) hypertension treatment guidelines.  A 
cardiologist may be consulted if appropriate. 
The objective of antihypertensive therapy in general is to control the blood pressure to a 
target level <140/90 mmHg.  For high- risk populations, such as patients with chronic 
renal disease and/or diabetes, it may be appropriate to aim for a target blood pressure < 130/[ADDRESS_1002873] recent

If hemorrhagic events are evaluated as severe (CTCAE Grade ≥3) or serious adverse events, 
fruquintinib tre atment should be discontinued or interrupted immediately, and appropriate  
treatment measures initiated  to control bleeding (e.g. transfusion, radiologic, endoscopic, 
or elective operative intervention as indicated ).  When the patient is not well enough to 
tolerate an invasive procedure or operation, best supportive care is given  (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS], Table 13 , Dose Adjustment for Hemorrhage at any Site ).  Patien ts need 
to be very closely monitored, both clinically (continuously), and by [CONTACT_733903]  (INR, aPTT, platelet count, hemoglobin) every 2- 3 days until the results return to 
baseline or normal).  During the initial assessment, a focused histo ry and physical 
examination, with collection of vital signs  and laboratory evaluation and imaging 
evaluation should be obtained, aimed at determining the time of onset, location, severity of 
bleeding, and whether bleeding is ongoing.  Clinicians should be mindful of 
comorbidities and concomitant treatments ( eg. anti-platelet therapy  and/or 
thrombocytopenia, or liver disease)  that could also contribute to bleeding and manage them 
as appropriate.  Consultation with other department clinicians should be considered when 
necessary.  
The investigator should closely monitor patients receiving anti -platelet and/or anti-
thrombotic drugs during study drug treatment and make a timely decision on whether to continue or stop such drugs in patients that report Grade ≥2 hemorrhagic events at any site, 
based on an individual assessment of the risk -benefit balance.  
If a hemorrhagic event is evaluated as a severe (CTCAE Grade ≥3) or serious adverse event 
after taking fruquintinib, the investigator is required to report the event in an expedited  
fashion (within [ADDRESS_1002874] awareness)  to sponsor (see  Table 12  and Section  7.2 
Expedited Reporting Requirements ).  
See the Management F lowch art below for guidance on the management of severe or 
serious hemorrhage at any site.

Amendment 3, Version 3:  
The protocol was amended on July 2, 2018 to add a cohort of 30 pat ients with metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC) to the expansion phase of this study.  At the time of writing the 
Amendment 3, the Safety Review Committee (SRC) had determined that the recommended 
Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of fruquintinib is 5 mg QD (3 weeks on/1 week off each 28 -day 
cycle).  The study population in the expansion phase therefore include d both the 
originally planned cohort of 6 patients with advanced solid tumors of any type (Cohort A) and a new cohort of 30 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer mCRC (Cohort B).  The basis for adding [ADDRESS_1002876] terminology was changed to “dose 
escalation phase” because the study was not prospectively designed as the safety -run in 
phase in a Phase 2 trial.  
The changes in Amendment  3 are summarized in the table below.

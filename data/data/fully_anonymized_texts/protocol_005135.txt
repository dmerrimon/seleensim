1. PURPOSE:  
1.1. This study is designed to demonstrate that the AF Prototype Cushion (AF Proto ) 
can reduce seating fatigue and improve human performance in aircraft seating.  
 
2. SCOPE :   
2.1. For testing of the AF Proto  and its ability to  increase comfort  in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]’s seat in a 
B52 bomber, by [CONTACT_897185] 12 hours in duration .

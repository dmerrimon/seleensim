Abstract:  
Extensive dental procedures in children frequently require general anesthesia due to lack of 
cooperation. In most cases, nasotracheal intubation (NTI) is necessary to preserve an unobstructed 
surgical field for the dental surgeon and to allow alignment assessment post repair. Advancing an 
appropriately sized breathing tube through the nares can cause significant trauma to the nasal mucosa 
resulting in bleeding, swelling and postoperative congestion and pain (7). Children are uniquely 
predisposed to these complications given the presence of adenotonsillar hypertrophy, narrow sinus 
passages,  and friable  mucosa!  layer  (7,9).  To our knowledge,  there  has not been  any study  investigating 
choice of nasal tracheal tube (NTT) and degree of mucosa I damage in this patient  population.  
 
Background:  
 
Several techniques have been suggested to reduce trauma during NTI, some of which are now adopted 
widely. These include lubrication of the nasal mucosa (17), softening of the tracheal tube by [CONTACT_779164] 
(1), and induced nasal mucosaI vasoconstriction (4,5). The design of the NTT tip has been shown to 
impact the degree of trauma during NTI in the adult population (2,3,6,16). The Parker NTT (Parker Flex- 
Tip™ Tracheal Tube, Parker Medical via Mercury Medical, Clearwater, FL [ZIP_CODE]) has a flexible distal tip 
that is mid line, curved and tapered. This shape theoretically facilitates its sliding past obstructions 
encountered in the airway such as the nasal turbinates, arytenoids and vocal cords, rather than being 
hung up on them and causing trauma (6). Use of Parker NTT in adult patients has been demonstrated to 
facilitate intubations via the fibreoptic, oral and nasotracheal pathways (2,3,6,16). While there are 
convincing studies in adults that demonstrate that the design of the NTT tip can impact the degree of 
trauma during NTI, to our knowledge no similar studies have been conducted in children.  
 
Specific Aims:  
 
To investigate the impact of NTT tip design on mucosa! injury during NTI in children undergoing dental 
procedures under GA  
 
 
 
Null Hypothesis:  
 
Choice of NTT in children requiring NTI for dental procedures has no impact on the degree of nasal 
mucosa! injury.

Research Protocol:  
 
Inclusion criteria: children between the ages of 3 -11, ASA 1 -3, presenting to Wolfsons Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(WCH) for dental procedures requiring general anesthesia with NTI.  
 
Exclusion  criteria:  ASA >3, known  bleeding  disorder,  recent  or ongoing  treatment  with blood -thinning 
medicines,  frequent  epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940],  active  URl/congestion/rhinorrhea,  craniofacial  abnormalities  prohibiting 
NTI, known  difficult  airway,  prior  nasal  surgery/trauma,  or allergies  to any of the medicines  used  in this 
study.  
 
Preop : eligible patients will be identified by [CONTACT_779166] a brochure detailing the study 
during their dentist visit. Eligibility will be confirmed by [CONTACT_779167] (study nurse/nurse practitioner) on the day of surgery and consent obtained with 
the parents.  
 
Preoperative anxiolysis will be at the discretion of the anesthes iologist, but should be limited to oral or 
intravenous midazolam, dexmedetomidine, or intramuscular ketamine, and not include any medicines 
administered intranasally.  
 
lntraop:  cases are assigned exclusively to one of the study investigators, but may involve the presence 
of trainees (anesthesia residents, fellows or assistants).  
 
Induction: pre -oxygenation followed by [CONTACT_779168] 6 -8% Sevofluorane in Nitrous oxide/O2 
(60/40) followed by [CONTACT_779169] (22 -24g), Fentanyl lmcg/kg, Propofol 1 -3mcg/kg, Rocuronium 
0.6mg/kg.  
 
Nasal  Prep:  Oxymetazoline  (Afrin,  [COMPANY_006]  Consumer  Care,  Inc) nasal  spray,  [ADDRESS_1071063] pediatric sized flexible fibreoptic scope, nostril patency and degree of choanal obstruction (as 
defined by [CONTACT_779170], which is known to vary by [CONTACT_26765] (8,9,10)) will be assessed avoiding tactile 
trauma to the nasal mucosa. Unless it is deemed not patent or significantly diminished in size, the R 
nostril will be preferably selected for intubation as most standard NTT are designed in favor of R -sided 
NTI. 
Page 4 of 7 
 NTT prep: NTT size will be chosen based on the formula 'age+16/4 -0.5' for a cuffed NTT which has been 
validated previously (12). For patients with Trisomy 21, the formula will be uniformly  adjusted to  select 
an NTT one size down from calculated to accommodate a smaller midface skeleton (13,14,15). Since 
children  with Trisomy 21 make up a large part of the dental surgery population,  it  would be impractical 
to exclude them from the study.  A simplified table is included below(*) to define starting NTT size for  
both Down syndrome and other children by [CONTACT_654]. The selected NTT will be softened in sterile warm  saline  
(1) for at least lOmin prior to insertion into the nasopharynx. Immediately prior to insertion the NTT tip 
will be lubricated with Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP 2% jelly (©Akorn, Incorporated I [ADDRESS_1071064], Illinois [ZIP_CODE]).  
 
Intubation procedure: for the purpose of this study we will intubate using the glidescope (Verathon 
Medical, ULC, Burnaby, BC, Canada) to mimic the standard practice of direct laryngoscopy while allowing 
for pi[INVESTIGATOR_779157]. The glidescope will be inserted 
and positioned midline after which the prepared NTT is advanced through the selected nostril until 
visualization in the oropharynx. Quantification of mucosaI bleeding (none, mild(blood on tracheal cuff 
only), moderate(blood on tracheal cuff and trace blood in the oropharynx),  or  severe(blood  pooling in 
the oropharynx)) will be done at the time of intubation and verified at a later time by [CONTACT_779171][INVESTIGATOR_146280]. In the event of disagreement, a third investigator will make the 
final judgment based on the input from the prior evaluators. The presence and degree of impi[INVESTIGATOR_779158]: none (smooth passage without hang -ups), mild (single 
interruption in passage easily overcome by [CONTACT_779172]), moderate 
(interruption in passage requiring re -passage of the tube, or more than one interruption in passage 
requiring readjustments) or severe (necessitating NTT down -size  and/or multiple attempted re- 
passages). Tracheal intubation should then ensue using McGill forceps as necessary to guide the NTT 
through the vocal  cords.  
 
Maintenance: anesthetic gas admixture at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Additional opi[INVESTIGATOR_50953]/or anxiolytics at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.  
 
Postop: in the recovery unit (PACU), presence of persistent epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], post -extubation croup, and the 
time to discharge from PACU will be noted.  
 
Research Plan:  
 
This will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial in children aged [ADDRESS_1071065] of NTT design by 
[CONTACT_779173] -mentioned  primary - and secondary  outcome  variables  in 
the study -vs. control  groups.  A sample  size of 80 patients  (40 in each  group)  can detect  the difference 
of the same  magnitude  between  our study  and control  groups  with a power  of more  than 98%  at the 
level  of significance  of 0.05.  Randomization  to study  (Parker  NTT)  vs. control  (Standard  NTT)  will be 
computer  generated  and will be stratified  by [CONTACT_779174].  (Please  refer  to the Statistics  Section  below)  
 
Recruitment will be facilitated by [CONTACT_779175], and final 
enlistment will be done on the day of surgery.

 Statistics Description:  
 
Power and Sample Size Justification: The primary aim of the study is to compare the proportion of 
patients with the presence of at least mild {as defined in the intubation procedure section) bleeding 
between Parker NTT {study) and Standard NTT {control) groups. To our knowledge, no studies reported 
conducting research to assess the impact of mucosaI injury in pediatric patients. A pediatric study {ref: 
EI-Seify et al) reported a significant difference in the proportion of patients with the presence of  
bleeding between the control group {27.5%} and a similar method of our study group {7.5%). A sample 
size of 80 patients {40 in each group) can detect the difference of the same magnitude between our 
study and control groups with a power of more than 98% at the level of significance of  0.05.  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_779170].  
 
Data Analysis: Collected data will be summarized by [CONTACT_543206]. Categorical variables will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_22977]. Quantitative variables are summarized by [CONTACT_779176] {SEM} or median and inter -quartile range, whichever is appropriate. A Chi- 
squared test or Fisher exact test will be used to compare the distribution of categorical variables, while 
two-sample t test or non -parametric Mann -Whitney U test will be used to compare the  mean or median 
of quantitative variables. In addition to Chi -square/Fisher exact test, a logistic regression model will be 
used to compare the proportion of patients with the presence of at least mild bleeding between two 
groups. The analysis will be adjusted for  the degree of obstruction and for  other influential covariates in 
a multivariable logistic regression model. In addition, an ordinal logistic regression will be used to 
compare the severity of bleeding between two groups as long as the assumption of proportional odds 
met. Otherwise, a multinomial logistic regression model will be used for this purpose. The same 
analytical procedures will be used to compare the  presence and the degree of impi[INVESTIGATOR_779159]. Once again, univariable and multivariable logistic regressions will be used to compare 
Postoperative epi[INVESTIGATOR_779160]. Kaplan Meier 
survival plot and log rank test will be used to compare the distribution of time to discharge  from the 
PACU. All tests are two -tailed at the level of significance of 0.05. The statistical software SAS,  version  
9.3 will be used for analyses.

2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
AL amyloidosis is a variant plasma cell disorder in which clonal bone marrow plasma cells produce 
immunoglobul in light chains that misfold into fibrils that are deposited in visceral organs, leading 
to organ dysfunction and failure.  Untreated, the disease has a median survival of only about one 
year. Oral treatment with melphalan and dexamethasone has had varying  efficacy in different 
centers1,2. More intensive treatment with high dose intravenous melphalan with autologous stem cell 
transplantation (HDM/SCT) produces complete hematologic responses (CR) in about 40% of 
patients and partial responses in a similar pr oportion; these are frequently accompanied by 
[CONTACT_404575]3. However, less than 30% of referred patients are 
eligible for HDM/SCT and  treatment -related mortality ( TRM ) is high in inexperienced centers. 
While hematologic re sponses can be durable after HDM/SCT, 28% of patients do relapse at a median 
of [ADDRESS_1008998] received at leas t three prior lines of therapy 
including proteasome inhibitor (PI) and immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) or who are double -
refractory to a PI [INVESTIGATOR_541654]. Daratumumab led to an overall hematologic response of 29% in 
heavily pretreated, relapsed or refractory p atients with myeloma. The median time to response was 
1 month (range, 0.9 to 5.6 months) and the median duration of response was 7.4 months (range: 1.2 
to 13.1+ months)8. Results were similar in an open -label dose escalation trial of daratumumab  
monotherap y in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma. Given the above, daratumumab has 
become a drug of interest in the field of AL amyloidosis, a disease that shares a similar 
pathophysiology to multiple myeloma; both are clonal plasma cell dyscrasias expres sing CD38 on 
their surface.

daratumumab  in the treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis  who are in need of a second line of 
therapy.  
 
3.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
 
3.1  Darat umumab  (IND -948)   
a.  DESCRIPTION :   Daratumumab is a human CD38 -directed monoclonal antibody currently FDA 
approved  for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three 
prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor ( PI) and an immunomodulatory agent or 
who are double -refractory to a PI [INVESTIGATOR_598350] .  Daratumumab is a human 
IgG1k monoclonal antibody that binds the CD38 glycoprotein , a protein expressed on the surface 
of plasma cells. It  antagonize s the  function  of CD38  via complement dependent cytotoxicity  
(CDC) , antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity  (ADCC) , and through apoptosis  of CD38 -
expressing cells  via cross -linking (de Weers, Journal of Immunology, 2011) .   
 
b.  SAFETY : Based on clinical tria l data collected from patients with relapsed refractory multiple 
myeloma, t he most common adverse events reported  were infusion related, predominantly 
during the first infusion  and up to 24 hours thereafter . Severe reactions, such as bronchospasm, 
dyspnea,  hypoxia, and hypotension were rare (<2%  each). Less serious and more common 
reactions ( >5%) included nasal congestion, cough,  chills, rhinitis allergic, throat irritation, 
dyspnea  and nausea. The incidence of any grade infusion reaction was 46% with the f irst infusion  
of daratumumab , 5% with the second infusion, and 4%  with subsequent infusions. Of note, there 
were no grade 3 or higher reactions upon subsequent infusions . The median time to  a reaction 
was approximately 1.5 hours while t he incidence of infu sion interruption due to an adverse event 
was 37%. Reactions could occur up to 48  hours following  completion of the infusion . Common 
adverse events ( ≥10%) included , but not limited to: fatigue, cough, back pain, arthralgias, nausea 
and diarrhea.  Serious adverse events  were reported in up to 33%  of patients and these  included 
pneumonia (6%) , general physical health deterioration (3%)  and fever (3%). No grade 4 events 
were reported.  
 
As of 11/15/18, daratumumab has been administered to approximately 4,[ADDRESS_1008999] -marketing exposure of 34,316 
person -years. HBV reaction, including fatal  cases, has been observed in association with 
daratumumab. The overall frequency of HBV reactivation is daratumumab clinical trials, 
including serious and non -serious reports is 0.2%.

Page 4 a Consider incremental escalation of the infusion rate only in the absence  of infusion reactions.  
b Use a dilution volume of 500 mL only if there were no Grade  1 (mild) or  greater infusion reactions during the first [ADDRESS_1009000] infusion.  
c Use a modified initial rate for subsequent infusions (i.e. third infu sion onwards) only if there were no Grade 1 (mild) or 
greater infusion reactions  during a final infusion rate of ≥100 mL/hr in the first two infusions.  
Otherwise, continue to use instructions for the second infusion.  
 
Daratumumab will be administered at the FDA -approved dose of 16mg/kg as an intravenous 
infusion.  Weight from screening visit will be used for initial dosing and throughout treatment 
period but will be recalculated for weight change > 10%. It will be administered weekly from 
weeks [ADDRESS_1009001] infusion  of daratumumab  (in 1000 mL) will be administered at an initial rate of 50 
mL/hour  to be escalated hourly by 50 mL/hour to a maximum rate of 200 mL/hour .  
 
The second infusion of daratumumab will be administered in [ADDRESS_1009002] infusion.  The second infusion 
will be administered at an initial rate of 50 mL/hour to be esca lated hourly by 50 mL/hour to a 
maximum rate of 200 mL/hour    
 
The third and subsequent doses will be administered in 500 mL  at a starting rate of 100 mL/hour 
to be escalated hourly by 50 mL/hour to a maximum rate of 200 mL/hour as long as no > Grade 
1 infusion reactions occur  during a final infusion rate of > 100 mL/hr in the first two infusions.  
 
Infusion reactions of any grade will lead to the temporary interruption or slowing of the 
infusion, as well as management of symptoms . Depending on the grade/sev erity of the 
reaction, this may require the permanent discontinuation of the drug .   
 
Refer to section 8 for management of infusion reactions.

5.[ADDRESS_1009003] of care that 
patients scheduled for visits within the hematology/oncology clinics are "pre -screened" to determine 
if they may be "potentially eligible" for any available clinical trials. This is not specific for this study. 
BMC IRB #H -[ZIP_CODE]:  
Janssen Protocol #54767414AMY2002     Protocol Version # 12, 2/26/[ADDRESS_1009004] to indicate that the patient may or may not be "potential ly eligible" for a clinical trial. 
If the patient is potentially eligible, the physician will discuss the study at the visit. No procedures 
are performed for screening until after consent is obtained.  
 
No data will be retained prior to obtaining consent.  No data is collected during the "pre -screening". 
During the pre -screen, if a patient is determined to be not potentially eligible for any available 
clinical trials, the patient would not be considered as a "screen fail" as they have not undergone a 
full s creening.  
 
If potentially eligible, the investigator will inform the potential participant within his/her practice 
that he/she may be eligible for the research study. If the patient agrees to discuss and receive 
information about the study, an IRB -approved  Informed Consent Form will be presented to the 
patient by a member of the research staff who will verbally outline the details of the procedures, 
risks, benefits, alternatives, costs, etc. The patient will be given the opportunity to bring the consent 
home and discuss with family members and/or other physicians and to ask any and all questions of 
the investigator and/or research staff. Once the patient is satisfied that all questions have been 
answered, if he/she wishes to participate, the consent form wil l be signed and dated by [CONTACT_738434]. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_738419] .  The original copy will be placed in the research 
chart.  
 
For parti cipants that live out of state, after the initial consent discussion in clinic, further discussions 
may take place via telephone with the research nurse and/or investigator to be sure all questions are 
answered to the patient’s satisfaction.  If the patien t agrees to participate, (s)he may sign, print and 
date the consent document and fax it to the research office.  The investigator will sign the consent 
on the day (s)he receives it , as confirmation that the consentin g process has taken place.  A copy of 
the document with both signatures  will be given to the patient and placed in the appropriate medical 
record .  The participant will be instructed to bring the document with their original signature [CONTACT_738447].  In addition, when the patient returns to begin screening and/or treatment, a clean copy of 
the current consent is again presented to the patient for signature.  The treating investigator will sign 
and a copy will be given to the patient.  This signed consent as well as t he original wet -ink signat ure 
pages (participant and investigator) will be kept in the research chart.   
 
Potential participants who are non -English speaking will be consented using the Short Form (if IRB 
approved).  A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_738420] a translator on the phone line will be u sed throughout the consent 
process and throughout their participation in the study.  
 
The consent process that has taken place will be documented in the medical record.

7.3 Additional Information  
Patients with a histo ry of chronic obstructive disease  or asthma will undergo pulmonary 
function testing for the determination of their forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_131955] 
(FEV1) prior to daratum umab exposure. In addition, this population of patients should be 
considered fo r short and long -acting bronchodilators in addition to inhaled corticosteroids 
post-infusion.  
 
Patients will be initiated on antiviral prophylaxis  (acyclovir or valcyclovir)  to prevent herpes 
zoster reactivation  within one week of starting daratumumab  and will be continued for 3 
months following the completion of treatment.  
 
Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a  positive Indirect 
Antiglobulin Test (Coombs test). Daratumumab -mediated  positive indirect antiglobulin test 
may per sist for up to [ADDRESS_1009010] daratumumab infusion. Daratumumab bound to

determination of a patient’s ABO and  Rh blood type are not impacted. B lood bank must be 
notified if a patient has received daratumumab  and of this interference with serological 
testing. Order t ype and  screen and blood bank phenotype on patients prior to starting 
daratumumab . 
 
 
HBV Serology : 
 
All subjects will be tested locally for hepatitis B s urface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B 
surface antibody (Anti -HBs), and hepatitis B core antibody (Anti -HBc) at Screening.  
Additionally, subjects ongoing in the Treatment Phase who are within [ADDRESS_1009011] dose.  
 
HBV DNA tests:  
 
Subjects who are positive for Anti -HBc or Anti -HBs will undergo testing for hepatitis B 
DNA by [CONTACT_954]. Subjects with se rologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (Anti -HBs 
positivity as the only serologic marker) and a known history of prior HBV vaccination do 
not need to be tested for HBV DNA by [CONTACT_954]. During and following study treatment, 
subjects who have history of H BV infection will be closely monitored for clinical and 
laboratory signs of reactivation of HBV as specified in the Time and Events Schedule 
(Section 9 ).  Where required by [CONTACT_1769], the results of HBV testing may be reported to the 
local health authoriti es               
                        Management of Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation : 
 
Primary antiviral prophylaxis is permitted as per local standard of care.  Per protocol, HBV

8.0 TOXICITIES TO BE MONITORED AND DOSAGE MODIFICATIONS  
See Section 3.0 for potential toxicities associated with daratum umab .  In all patients experiencing 
such toxicities, an attempt should be made to distinguish between drug toxicity, associated medical 
illness, or disease (amyloid) -related symptomology.  
 
Dose delay is the primary method for managing daratumumab -related t oxicities.  
 
Infusion -related reactions:  
Infusion reactions of any grade will lead to the temporary interruption or slowing of the infusion, 
as well as management of symptoms. Depending on the grade/severity of the reaction, this may 
require the permanent  discontinuation of the drug.   
 
For Grade [ADDRESS_1009012] Grade 3 or greater reaction occurs.  
 
For Grade 4 reactions (life threatening), daratumumab should b e discontinued permanently.  
 
Non-reaction Daratumumab -Related Toxicity Management  
The criteria for a dose delay are:  
• Grade 4 hematologic toxicities  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding  
• Febrile neutropenia of any grade  
• Neutropenia with infection, of any grade  
• Grade 3 or higher non -hematologic toxicities with the following exceptions:  
- Grade 3 nausea that responds to antiemetic treatment within 7 days  
- Grade 3 vomiting that responds to antiemetic treatment within 7 days  
- Grade 3 diarrhea that respond s to antidiarrheal treatment within 7 days  
- Grade 3 fatigue that was present at baseline or that lasts for <[ADDRESS_1009013] 
administration of daratumumab  
-  Grade 3 asthenia that was present at baseline or that lasts for <[ADDRESS_1009014] possible time and study treatment should be discontinued, unless, upon 
consultation with the sponsor and the review of data, continuation is agreed upon.

9 Screening tests should be performed within 28 days of initiating study drug with the exception of Echocardiogram, CXR, PFTs and EKG, which could occur 
within 60 days.  
10 HBV serology testing: HBsAg, antibody to antiHBs, and antibody to antiHBc assessments should be obtained for those on study treatment for less than [ADDRESS_1009020] testing monitored every 3 months while on study treatment.  
11. HBV DNA testing: Q12W during treatment, at the En d of treatment visit, and Q12W for up to [ADDRESS_1009021] dose of study treatment. For subjects with 
serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection (i.e., positive Anti -HBs or positive Anti -HBc) at Screening, HBV DNA testing by [CONTACT_738439]. See section 7.[ADDRESS_1009022] a delta FLC of 40 mg/L for study entry as primary endpoint of 
the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of the study drug. Hematologic responses will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_738440] M -spi[INVESTIGATOR_738421] e of clonal 
plasma cells in  the bone marrow. Organ responses will be assessed by [CONTACT_10486] 24 hour protein 
excretion for patients with renal involvement; by c hanges in NT -proBNP for patients with cardiac 
involvement; and by [CONTACT_738441].  
 
10.1 Toxicities : 
 
Safety of the study drug will be  assessed by [CONTACT_738442], interruption of therapy, routine laboratory 
assessments, and frequency and severity of AEs  
 
10.2 Responses:   
 
It is important to note that daratumumab  is an IgGk monoclonal antibody that can be 
detect ed as an individual monoclonal band on SPEP and serum immunofixation 
electrophoresis (IFE). It can be confused with the endogenous IgG -k M-protein of the 
patient during IFE interpretation. Co -migration can introduce a bias in M -protein 
quantification and c an also mask clearance of the patient’s M -protein by [CONTACT_192124]. For optimal 
M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_738422], our laboratory specialist will be informed if a patient is receiving 
daratumumab .  
 
 
10.2.1 Hematologic Response Criteria  
 
CR: Negative serum and urine immunofixation  electrophoresis, normal serum free light 
chain ratio  
 
VGPR : Reduction in the dFLC  to <40 mg/L, dFLC = difference in involved and 
uninvolved serum free light -chain levels  
 
PR: dFLC reduction  by >50%, dFLC = difference in involved and uninvolved serum 
free light-chain levels  
 
BMC IRB #H -[ZIP_CODE]:  
Janssen Protocol #54767414AMY2002     Protocol Version # 12, 2/26/19 
 
  
Page 14 SD: Meets neither criteria for CR, VGPR, PR or PD  
 
PD: An increase in FLC of 50% to > 100mg/L. From CR, any detectable M protein or 
abnormal FLC ratio (light chain must double).  From VGPR, PR or SD, an increase in the 
serum M -protein f rom the lowest level by > 50%, as long as the absolute magnitude of this 
increase is > 0.5 g/dL; or an increase in the urine M -protein from the lowest level by 50%, 
as long as the absolute magnitude of this increase is > 200 mg/day; or an increase in the 
serum or urine monoclonal free light chain by > 50% from the lowest level, as long as the 
absolute magnitude is > 10 mg/dL (100 mg/L).  
 
10.2.2 Organ Response Criteria  
 
 Cardiac :  
 
Cardiac response:  
 NT-proBNP response (>30% and >300 ng/L decrease in patients  with a baseline NT -
proBNP >650 ng/L  
 NYHA class response (> two -class decrease if baseline NYHA class 3 or 4)  
 
Cardiac progression:  
 NT-proBNP progression (>30% and >300 ng/L increase)  
 cTn progression (> 33%)  
 EF progression ( > 10% decrease)  
 
 Renal : 
 
 Renal  response:  
 Decrease in proteinuria by > 30% or below 0.5 g/24 h without renal progression. Serum 
creatinine and creatinine clearance (or calculated estimated GFR) must not worsen by 
25% over baseline  
 
 Renal progression:  
 50% increase (at least 1 g/day) of 24-hour urine protein to >1g/day or 25% worsening 
of serum creatinine or creatinine clearance  
 
10.4 Performance Status : Patients will be graded according to the ECOG  performance  status 
scale.

11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Sample Size Estimation  
 
Estimated patient accrua l and trial duration:  The study will be designed as a single armed 
phase II trial, in which the response in 20 evaluable patients will be determined, with 25 
patients enrolled to ensure that 20 are evaluable  
 
Completion of a ccrual will be expected in ~[ADDRESS_1009023] 3 doses.  At this time t he Medical Monitor will review the safety results 
of the study.  The recommendation is to consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_738423] i f 
during this time ([ADDRESS_1009024] 5 patients)  [ADDRESS_1009025] 3 doses, the 
protocol will be re -evaluated to consider  modify ing the schedule of daratumumab  (for 
example, split the first dose of daratumumab  over two days or adding mandatory 
concomitant medications).   If fewer than [ADDRESS_1009026] 3 doses, the study will re -open and enrollment will b e 
expanded to an additional cohort of subjects.

Janssen Protocol #54767414AMY2002     Protocol Version # 12, 2/26/[ADDRESS_1009027] deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum.   
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_154562] -missing observations, 
frequencies and percentages.    
All analyses will be performed using SAS® (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, 
U.S.) version 9.4 or higher.  
 
11.3 Handling of Missing Data  
 
Data will be analyzed as recorded in the database. No imp utation of missing values will be 
performed unless indicated otherwise.  
 
 
 
12.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
Toxicity and accrual monitoring will be performed on a routine basis by [CONTACT_738443], which has over 
40 years’ experience in the treatment of AL amyloidosis.  Subjects will undergo toxicity assessment, 
performance status assessment and laboratory tests before each dose.  Response assessment will be 
conducted  every three months .  The clinical status and laboratory reports of the study participants 
will be reviewed routinely by [CONTACT_44375] .  Dose modifications/interruptions or 
discontinuation will be implemented according to Section 8.  
 
            In addition, a Medical Monitor will be assigned to the study.  The Medical Monitor must be a 
qualified clinician with relevant expertise, but no direct connection with the research, whose primary  
responsibility is to provide independent safety monitoring in a timely fashion. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_879] a 
BMC IRB #H -[ZIP_CODE]:  
Janssen Protocol #54767414AMY2002     Protocol Version # 12, 2/26/[ADDRESS_1009028] of all adverse 
events and serious adverse events (regardless of relatedness).  In addition, any unanticipated 
problems involving ris ks to participants or others and participant deaths within 30 days of study 
intervention will be reported to the Medical Monitor within 48 hours.  The Medical Monitor is 
expected to provide a formal, unbiased written report evaluating individual and cumula tive 
participant safety data when making recommendations regarding continuation of the study.  
Although the PI [INVESTIGATOR_738424], the medical monitor will comment on whether 
or not (s)he is in agreement.  Medical Monitor reports will m ust be submitted to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_738425] (at a minimum of once every 6 months), which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1318], in turn, submit to the IRB.  
Although there is no pre -determined criteria for early termination due to toxicity, the Medical 
Monitor and investigator s will evaluate toxicities on a continuing basis, and will terminate the study 
early if toxicities exceed acceptable parameters. Each individual situation will be reviewed, and 
response data will be considered. The study will be stopped early if it appears  that the benefit no 
longer outweighs the risks.  
 
 
12.1 Interventional IIS Janssen Scientific Affairs Requirements for Safety Data Collection 
and Reporting

12.1.3  Definitions  
 
Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered 
a medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. A n adverse event does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be 
BMC IRB #H -[ZIP_CODE]:  
Janssen Protocol #54767414AMY2002     Protocol Version # 12, 2/26/19 
 
  
Page 18 any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal  (investigational or non - investigational) 
product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) 
product. (Definition per International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH])  
 
This includes any occurrence that is new in ons et or aggravated in severity or frequency from 
the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory 
test abnormalities.  
 
  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest are events that Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC is actively 
monitoring as a result of a previously identified signal (even if non -serious). These adverse 
events are:  
  Infusion reactions: ≥ grade 3  
 Infections: ≥ grade 4  
 Cytopenias: ≥ grade  4  
 Tumor lysis syndrome  
 Other malignanci es 
 Intravascular hemolysis – all grades  
 
Any Adverse Event of Special Interest that is to be reported to the COMPANY 
should be recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Report Form and be reported to the 
COMPANY within 24 hours of knowledge  of the event.  
 
Indivi dual Case Safety Report (ICSR)  
A valid ICSR must contain the four minimum criteria required to meet regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
 an identifiable subject (but not disclosing personal information such as the subject’s 
name, initials or address)  
 an iden tifiable reporter (investigational site)  
 a Janssen medicinal product  
 an adverse event, outcome, or certain special situations  
 
The minimum information required is:  
 suspected Janssen medicinal product (doses, indication)  
 date of therapy (start and end date,  if available)  
 batch or lot number, if available  
 subject details (subject ID and country)  
 gender  
 age at AE onset  
 reporter ID  
 adverse event detail (AE verbatim in English), onset date, relatedness, causality, action 
taken, outcome, (if available)  
 Janssen pr otocol ID  
 
Product Quality Complaint (PQC)  
BMC IRB #H -[ZIP_CODE]:  
Janssen Protocol #54767414AMY2002     Protocol Version # 12, 2/26/[ADDRESS_1009031].  Lot and batch numbers are of high significance and need to be collected 
whenever available.  
 
Examples of PQC include but not limited to:  
 Functional Problem: e.g., altered d elivery rate in a controlled release product  
 Physical Defect:  e.g. abnormal odor, broken or crushed tablets/capsules  
 Potential Dosing Device Malfunction: e.g., autoinjector button not working, needle 
detaching from syringe  
 Suspected Contamination  
 Suspecte d Counterfeit  
  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
(The subj ect was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event 
that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Results in persistent or si gnificant disability/incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  
 Is medically important*  
 
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_738427]. These should usually be considered serious.  
 
NOTE: DEATH FOR ANY REASON SHOULD BE REPORTED AS A SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENT.  
 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48804], it is the sign, symptom or diagnosis which led to th e 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48805].  
 
Any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462861] a serious adverse event, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_300409] e following:  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23742] (e.g., social reasons 
such as pending placement in long -term care facility)  
o Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study. [Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_738428] #H -[ZIP_CODE]:

o [For convenience the investigator may choose to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_738429].]  
 
 Life-Threatening Conditions  
Disease progression should not be recorded  as an adverse event or serious adverse 
event term; instead, signs and symptoms of clinical sequelae resulting from disease 
progression/lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the serious adverse event 
definition.  
 
 12.1.4  Unlisted (Unexpected) A dverse Event/Reference Safety Information  
An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the 
applicable product reference safety information. For a medicinal product(s) with a marketing 
authorization, the expectedn ess of an adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_738444].   
http://www.darzalex.com/shared/product/dar zalex/darzalex -prescribing -information.pdf  
 
For DARZALEX™ (daratumumab),the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined 
by [CONTACT_83408]'s Brochure

12.2  INVESTIGATOR REPORTI NG TO THE FDA  
 
This protocol is conducted under IND # [ADDRESS_1009039] of the study 
will comply with all FDA reporting requirements.   
 
Adverse drug reactions that are Serious, Unlisted/unexpected, and at least possibly 
associated to the drug,  and that have not previously been reported in the Investi gators 
brochure, or reference safety information document should be reported promptly to the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) in writing by [CONTACT_104489]/physician engaged in clinical 
research.  A clear description of the suspected reaction should be  provided along with an 
assessment as to whether the event is drug or disease related.  Each SAE report will include 
an SAE Assessment Form (Appendix 14.2)  documenting  the PI’s assessment reporting 
requirements.  
 
The investigator/physician shall notify the  FDA by [CONTACT_738446]. As soon as possible 
but no later than [ADDRESS_1009040] review division in the Center for Biologics 
Evaluation and Research that has responsibility for review of the IND.  
 
Serious Adverse Events  That Are Not Study Endpoints and are not “expected” (e.g., not in 
the IB), can be anticipated to occur with some frequency during the course of the trial, 
regardless of drug exposure, depending on the patient population and disease under study. 
Examples o f such “anticipated” events include known consequences of the underlying

Page 24 disease or condition under investigation, events anticipated from any background regimen, 
events common in the study population, or re -emergence or worsening of a condition relative 
to pretreatment baseline. In general, a limited number of occurrences of such an adverse 
event in a study population in which occurrences of the event are anticipated is not an 
adequate basis to conclude that the event is a suspected adverse reaction (i.e.,  that there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event). Such events should not be reported 
individually as they occur because they are uninformative as single cases. Such anticipated 
adverse events should nonetheless be monitored at approp riate intervals, and the numbers of 
events in each arm of a controlled study should be compared. The adverse event must be 
reported to FDA expeditiously as an IND safety report if there is an imbalance between arms 
suggesting there is a reasonable possibil ity that the drug caused the adverse event (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)(i)(C)). It is important to consider the entire clinical trial database in such 
analyses.

The OHRP a nd the FDA regulations require that unanticipated problems  be promptly reported to the IRB. So what exactly is an 
unanticipated problem ? The guidances state that in order for any incident, experience, or outcome  to be an unanticipated 
problem , it must meet  all three  of the following criteria  (unless the event is considered to be “anticipated”) :  
1 YES ___  NO ____  Is the event unexpected?  It is unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that h as been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not 
available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan 
or elsewh ere in the current application;   
2 YES ___ NO ____  Is the event related or possibly rel ated to participation in the research (in this guidance document  
possibly related  means there is a reasonable  possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); AND  
[ADDRESS_1009042] that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
 
Anticipated Events :  Serious Adverse Events That Are  Not Study Endpoints and are not “expected” (e.g.,  not in the IB), can be anticipated to occur with some 
frequency during the course of the trial, regardless of drug exposure, depending on the patient population and disease under study. Examples of such “a nticipated” 
events include known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation, events anticipated from any bac kground regimen, events common 
in the study population, or re -emergence or worsening of a condition relative to pretrea tment baseline. In general, a limited number of occurrences of such an 
adverse event in a study population in which occurrences of the event are anticipated is not an adequate basis to conclude th at the event is a suspected adverse 
reaction (i.e., that the re is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event). Such events should not be reported  individually as they occur because they are 
uninformative as single cases. Such anticipated adverse events should nonetheless be monitored at appropriate int ervals, and the numbers of events in each arm 
of a controlled study should be compared. The adverse event must be reported to FDA expeditiously as an IND safety report if there  is an imbalance between 
arms suggesting there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event (21 CFR 312.32(c) (1)(i)(C)). It is important to consider the  entire clinical 
trial database in such analyses.  
 
4 YES ___  NO ____  Is the event anticipated?  An event is anticipated if it is not a study endpoint, and can be 
anticipated to occur with some frequency based on t he patient population/disease or 
background regimen or worsening of a pre -study baseline condition.   
 
5 YES ___  NO ____  This event warrants a change in the protocol or consent.

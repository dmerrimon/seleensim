Section #2 - Core Protocol  
 
2.1 Objectives & 
Hypotheses  
 
 
 
 Disturbed sleep is one of the most common and distressing responses to 
exposure to severe trauma and can persist in many of those af fected with 
and wi thout accompanying posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Insomnia is 
a risk factor for many of the conditions that are prevalent in trauma -exposed 
populations including PTSD, depression, and physical health conditions such 
as obesity, and  cardiovascular di sease. Trauma -related insomnia (TRI) is not 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_282481], 
and insomnia accompanying PTSD has been shown to be relatively 
refractory to the treatments that are established fo r PTSD. Thus treat ment of 
TRI presents an unmet need that has implications for the large and growing 
groups of people exposed to trauma in terms of relieving distress and 
preventing further psychiatric and medical morbidity.  
Most of the data on TRI comes from research on p opulations with PTSD. 
Difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep is designated as one of the 
heightened arousal symptoms of PTSD in the DSM. Sleep studies have 
suggested reduced slow wave sleep (SWS) in some PTSD populations and 
fragment ed rapid eye movem ent (REM) sleep when PTSD is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and 
during its more acute stages. Suvorexant is a first in class orexin antagonist 
and is approved by [CONTACT_282490]. Orexin 
antagonists dampen the activity of a specific ar ousal enhancing sy stem in the 
brain during sleep. In rodent models suvorexant has been shown to enhance, 
and in healthy humans, to not affect slow wave and REM activity (in contrast 
with traditional hypnotics which can diminish both). Reducing arousal duri ng 
sleep while mai ntaining REM and slow wave sleep is a promising profile for 
the treatment of TRI. We are therefore proposing a placebo controlled 
evaluation to assess the efficacy of suvorexant for treating TRI with and 
without PTSD and its tolerability  in these populatio ns. We will include 
polysomnography (PSG) in order to probe potential mechanisms and 
biomarkers predict ing response. The proposed study will meet the objectives 
below and test the following hypotheses:    
Objective 1. To recruit a group o f participants tha t meet criteria for insomnia 
and who identify a severely threatening event (DSM criterion A trauma) as a 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_282482] a factor that significantly exacerbated their sleep disturbance; 
and to determine the frequency of PTSD diagnoses and symptoms among 
the recruited participants.  
            Hypothesis 1) – Recruitment will reveal TRI to be a common 
condition that in approximately half of cases occurs absent PTSD.  
 
Objective 2. To evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of suvorexant on 
insomnia and wh en present, associated PTSD symptoms a nd its effects on 
PSG measures in participants with TRI.  
 Hypothesis 2a) Insomnia will improve, and nightmares and other 
PTSD symptoms will be reduced with suvorexant treatment  compared with 
placebo .  
 2b) Improved sle ep will be associated with reduced non -sleep related 
PTSD symptoms  when present .  
      MISP Templ ate: Protocol  3 Final Version: 8/13/2010   2c) Suvorexant will be well tolerated by [CONTACT_3038].  
 2d) Sleep latency and wake after sleep onset (WASO) will be reduced 
with suvorexant treatment  compared with plac ebo.  
           2e) (exploratory hypothesis) When reduced at baseline (i.e. SWS 
below 100 minutes and mean REM segment duration below 15 minutes)  
SWS and the duration of continuous segments of REM sleep will increase 
with suvorexant  comp ared with placebo .          
 
2.2 Background & 
Rationale , 
Significance of 
Selected Topic & 
Preliminary Data  
 Trauma -Related Insomnia (TRI)  
Insomnia is a common sequela of trauma exposure. In a review of studies of 
populations exposed to disasters, “troubl e sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” was th e most common 
symptom reported, especially from studies where sampling occurred within 4 
months.1 Findings from the Millennium Cohort Study indicated that military 
personnel who had been deploye d to Afghanistan a nd/or Iraq were 14 – 29% 
more likely to report insomnia symptoms compared with those who had not 
been deployed, and 27% of the post -deployment personnel reported 
insomnia symptoms that were at least moderately severe.2  Krakow and 
colleagues3 found that 99% of 78 treatment seeking evacuees of the Cerro 
Grande Fire met criteria for “psychophysiological” insomnia. Rates of 
insomnia for veterans and civilians  with PTSD, have r anged from 70 to 
91%.4-[ADDRESS_344463] been reported, the rates for insomnia in trauma 
exposed populations exceed those for PTSD (e.g. PTSD rates for the  
Millennium Cohort  were estimated at 5%,2 in the group recruited by [CONTACT_282491]. the rate for PTSD was 59%3). In our recent report of 136 urban young 
adult African Americ ans, 83% were trau ma exposed, 16% met full criteria for 
current PTSD, and 43% exceeded a recommended threshold score for 
diagnosing insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index score of 10 or greater7).[ADDRESS_344464] remitted . For 
example, Zayfert and DeViva9 reported that 48% of patients who achieved 
remission of PTSD following CBT developed for PTSD continued  to 
experience insomnia indicating that Further evidence that TRI represents an 
important treatment need comes from an analysis by [CONTACT_282492] a state Medicaid data base which revealed that over half of 
patients wit h a PTSD diagnosis  taking psychopharmacologic medications 
were receiving various hypnotics.[ADDRESS_344465] generally been in the 
context of PTSD. A meta -analysis of PTSD sleep studies published in 2007 
by [CONTACT_67192]’s co -PI [INVESTIGATOR_282483] “lighter sleep” in terms of reduced SWS 
and increased stage 1 as well as increased frequency of eye movements 
during REM sleep (REM density).[ADDRESS_344466] was initially inspi[INVESTIGATOR_282484] (to varying degrees), replicat e past (traumatic)  experiences.[ADDRESS_344467] 
postulated that REM sleep (when not disrupted) provides conditions that are 
conducive to reduc ing the affective intensity of trauma memories and 
      MISP Templ ate: Protocol  4 Final Version: 8/13/[ADDRESS_344468] correlation with insomnia 
sympto ms (i.e. stronger than the correlations with total sleep duration or 
WASO).[ADDRESS_344469], endorsed by 7% of 
insomnia patients receiving ap proved doses versu s 4% of those receiving 
placebo. Only 3% of trial participants receiving suvorexant discontinued 
treatment due to adverse effects which was comparable to the rate for those 
receiving placebo. Of note, despi[INVESTIGATOR_282485] a system that is im plicated in 
narcol epsy, there were no incidences of cataplexy observed in these clinical 
trials. Orexin antagonists have been shown to increase REM and SWS in 
animal models, however, in healthy humans (without disturbed sleep) there 
were no significant cha nges in the amount  of REM sleep nor changes in the 
distribution of spectral EEG frequencies within each sleep stage.[ADDRESS_344470] ate: Protocol  5 Final Version: 8/13/[ADDRESS_344471] been observed during the development of PTSD and within 
several yea rs of its onset. Suvorexant is promising for maintaining overall 
sleep and REM sleep that is being disrupted by [CONTACT_282493]. In 
addition to proposing a placebo -controlled evaluation of efficacy and 
tolerability of suvorexant for TR I we further propo se utilizing PSG to 
potentially elucidate physiological biomarkers of treatment response. Given 
the rising toll of trauma this proposal is a timely response to [COMPANY_006]’s call for 
proposals for “c linical studies exploring the investigational  use of suvorexant  
in key insomnia subpopulations.”  
 
2.3 Study Design  
 A double -blind  placebo -controlled  6-week trial of suvorexant 10 – 20mg for 
trauma related insomnia (with and without PTSD) with polysomnography  
2.[ADDRESS_344472] ate: Protocol  6 Final Version: 8/13/2010   
 
2.5 Study 
Procedures  Participants  
 
Recruitment:  
 
We will recruit 90 adults with the expectation of retaining 70 (see power 
analysis) . Participants will be between the ages of 18 to 55 with insomnia 
and trauma exposure (see below) . Recruit ment will occur  over a 2 1/[ADDRESS_344473] 
University campus and in strategic locations in the Washington DC 
community, and referrals from prior participants. Those who meet initial 
criteria by [CONTACT_112728] -site screening will be invited to the Clinical Res earch 
Unit (CRU) f or further screening and informed consent. We will recruit men 
and women. This study will be open to all ethnic and racial groups; however, 
with the study location of Howard University in urban DC we anticipate that 
many of the recruited participants will be from minority groups .     
 
Screening Procedures:  
 
Participants will initially be screened over the phone with a preliminary 
checklist of inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as be further informed 
regarding the purpose and goals f or the study. Thos e who remain interested 
and appear to meet study criteria will be invited for the screening evaluation 
at the Howard University CRU. (See study flow chart.)  
 
Inclusion criteria and justification:  
 
Physically healthy young to middle -aged adults (age 18 -55) who report on 
screening and are confirmed by a clinical interview to meet the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – 5th Edition (DSM -5) criteria for 
primary insomnia and Criterion A (exposure to a traumatic event) for P TSD.[ADDRESS_344474] started or worsened after the exposure to the 
index trauma. We anticipate that approximately half of the recruited sample 
will meet criteria for PTSD thus enabli ng comparisons bet ween those with 
TRI present or absent PTSD.  
Exclusion criteria:  
 
1. Psychiatric disorders other than insomnia, PTSD  and specific phobias ; 
including bipolar and  psychotic disorders and meeting criteria for DSM -[ADDRESS_344475] year . 
2. Diagnosis of a sleep disorder other than insomnia including PSG findings 
of  apnea/hypopnea or periodic limb movement indices > 10/hour;  
      MISP Templ ate: Protocol  7 Final Version: 8/13/2010  3. Consistent (daily) use of medication other than medications taken for 
blood pressure or  nonnarcotic medic ations for pain and/or inflammation, 
or medical conditions that compromise sleep;  
4. Caffeine use exceeding 5 cups of coffee per day or its equivalent;   
5. Habitual bedtimes after 3 AM, habitual rise times after 10AM, or habitual 
nappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] > 1 hour/day;  
 
6. Pregnancy o r breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive while in study  
(sexually active women will be required to use a medically acceptable 
form of birth control );  
7. Positive urine toxicology.  
 
Procedures  
Medication:   
After the baseline screening, participants will be r andomly assigned to either 
the suvorexant or placebo group, and suvorexant or placebo will be 
administered to be taken one hour before bedtime. Randomization will be 
stratified for the presence or absence of PTSD (full or subthreshold) an d 
gender. Medicati on will be managed by [CONTACT_282494]. In case of a 
missed appointment they will receive a [ADDRESS_344476] the option of reducing back to 10 
mg if done at or  before the week 2  study visit. Dose increases can be 
deferred until week 2 but after this visit medication dose will be held constant 
until the end of the study. Participants will discontinue medication after the 
week 6 study visit. At the final follow -up 1 week later clin ical assessment will 
inform the study clinician’s recommendation for further treatment including 
possible resumption  or initiation  of suvorexant. At each medication study the 
coordinator or research nurse will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_282486]. They will also query for potential adverse event s 
including a list of the most common adverse effects reported in the 
suvorexant trials22,23 will be queried as w ell as any events suggestive of 
parasomnias or narcolepsy phenomena (see Assessments below).   
Assessments:  
The f ollowing d iagnostic and outcome assessments will be performed by 
[CONTACT_282495]’ treatment cond ition.  
      MISP Templ ate: Protocol  8 Final Version: 8/13/2010  (Diagnostic ) 
Duke Structured Interview Schedule for DSM -IV-TR and International 
Classification of Sleep Disorders 2nd edition (ICSD -2) Sleep Disorder 
Diagnoses (DSISSD)26 – A widely used semi -structured in terview designed 
to assess sleep disorder diagnostic status. We will use this interview to 
evaluate the presence of insomnia and to rule out insomnia that is accounted 
for by a mental disorder other than PTSD, medical conditions, and substance 
use, parasom nias, narcolepsy, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. This 
interview will establish the onset and course of insomnia, with in conjunction 
with the information from the LEC and CAPS (see below) will determine the 
criteria for “trauma -related.”  
 
Structured  Clinical Intervie w for DSM -V (SCID)27  The SCID is semi -
structured diagnostic interview that assesses the DSM diagnostic criteria for 
psychiatric disorders and is considered the “gold standard” for ass essing 
mental diso rders.  A modification will be utilized in order to screen for 
excluded and establish allowable comorbid conditions.  
 
Life Event Checklist (LEC) ,28 is an inventory of lifetime exposure to traumatic  
events that lists  15 of the more common categories of trauma experiences 
and asks for endorsement of whether they occurred directly to the person or 
were witnessed and the age of exposure.  
 
The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)29 will be administered to 
further assess the details of trauma exposure, and (past week) PTSD 
severity, and lifetime diagnostic criteria. The CAPS evaluates the frequency 
and intensity of each of the [ADDRESS_344477] f or assessment of the diagnosis and severity of PTSD.  
 
(Assessments used for outcomes)  
  
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)[ADDRESS_344478] sleep diary each 
morning throughout this trial. The diary inc ludes questions ab out bedtime, 
final awakening time, sleep onset latency (SOL) estimate, the number of 
awakenings, and duration of each awakening, overall sleep satisfaction, 
morning restfulness, adherence/non -adherence to the study medication 
regimen, nig htmare frequency, and content of nightmare. Estimated total 
sleep time ( TST) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) for each night will be 
calculated using information provided in the diary.

medication wit hdrawal symptoms such as dizziness, shaking, nausea, and 
muscle tension as well as re -assessment of insomnia and sleep patterns for 
that period.   
 
Polysomnography (PSG):   
 
PSG collection includes a standard electroencephalogram (EEG) mon tage 
with two cent ral, frontal, and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_282488], two electrooculograms, chin and 
limb electromyograms, and an electrocardiogram (ECG). Recordings will be 
conducted using an Embla (Denver, CO) Titanium unit in the CRU. 
Screening for sleep disordered bre athing and limb mo vements will be 
performed using the screening night data. Visual scoring of sleep records 
from a computer monitor will be done following the American Academy of 
Sleep Medicine (AASM) Manual, Version 2.0.32 The REMLogic software 
(Embla) will calculate sleep parameters including TST, SOL, WASO, the 
percentage of each sleep stage, and mean duration of continuous REM 
segment. Calculation of REM segment length used our previous criteri a16 of 
at least two epochs of consecutive REM sleep with no more than one [ADDRESS_344481] but not subsequent nights. Participants will be instructed 
to go to bed near  their habitual be dtimes and will wake up naturalistically. 
PSG will be done prior to medication and after 3 weeks of medication 
treatment to allow for stable dosing.

2.7 Statistical 
Analysis and 
Sample Size 
Justif ication  The data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_105661] -investigator . 
 
Main outcomes will be ISI, CAPS nightmare frequency and total score, diary 
and PSG sleep latency  and WASO at week 3 and for non -PSG variables 
Med week 6. We will also explore effe cts on REM and SWS and their 
relationships to other study outcomes.  
 
An alpha level of .05 (one -tailed) will be applied in testing Hypotheses 2a) , 
2b), 2d) , and 2e) . Initial ly, data will be pre -screened for errors, outliers, 
normality of distributions, and  any necessary modifications, such as 
transformation of variables and/or elimination of cases, will be conducted.  
 
Our initial objectives are descriptive. We will generate frequencies of types of 
trauma exposures associated with insomnia and the rates for  PTSD 
diagnoses and sub -diagnostic threshold PTSD symptoms in the recruited 
study population ( Objective 1 ) and the frequency of adverse events 
(Objective 2 ). The latter will  be descriptively contrasted to the extant data for 
suvorexant from the insomnia re gistry trials as a guide to planning future 
trials including dosing.  
 Hypothesis 2a) Insomnia will improve, and nightmares and 
other PTSD symptoms will be reduced with suvo rexant treatment  
compared with placebo : We will compare baseline characteristics of  the 
treatment group s using independent samples t-tests  for continuous variables 
or chi-square tests for categorical variables . If a significant group difference 
is found in  some of the variables, the variable(s) will be included in 
subsequent analyses as a covariate(s). We will perform 2 (Group) x 3 (Time: 
baseline, Med week 3, and w eek 6 ) mixed ANOVAs or ANCOVAs [if there is 
a covariate(s)] to compare the changes in ISI sco res, nightmare frequency, 
and CAPS scores , separately, between the two groups.  
 
Hypothesis 2b) Improved sleep will be associated with reduced 
non-sleep PTSD symptoms : Correlation coefficients between baseline  – 
Med w eek 6  changes in sleep measures (e.g., I SI scores and nightmare 
frequency) and changes in the CAPS scores excluding two sle ep-related 
items will be computed.  In addition, w e will exploratively examine if there is 
an interaction with treatment condition  by [CONTACT_282496], 
treatment condition, an d a Sleep measure X Treatment condition interaction .  
Hypothesis 2d) Sleep latency and wake after sleep onset (WASO) 
will be reduced with suvorexant treatment  compared with placebo :: We 
will perform 2 (Group: suvorexant vs. placebo) x 2 (Time : Baseline and  Med 
week 3 ) mixed ANOVAs or ANCOVAs [if there is a covariate(s)] to compare 
the changes  in PSG measured sleep latency  and WASO  between the 
suvorexant and placebo groups . 
 
           Exploratory hypothesis 2e) When reduced at baseline (i.e., SWS 
below [ADDRESS_344484] ate: Protocol  11 Final Version: 8/13/2010  minutes), SWS and the duration of continuous segments of REM sleep 
will increase  with suvorexant  than placebo:  Participants  with reduced 
baseline  SWS (below vs. above 100 minutes) and mean REM segment 
duration  (below vs. above 15 minutes)  will be included in the analyses . 2 
(Group) x 2 (Time: Baseline and Med week 3) mixed ANOVAs or ANCOVAs 
will be performed to compare treatment changes in SWS and REM segment 
duration between the suvorexant and placebo groups .  
 
Power Considerations:  
 
G*Power 3.[ADDRESS_344485] power analysis.  
Power analysis for Hypothesis 2a) is based on the effec t size 
estimated  using findings of  Herring and colleagues’22 placebo controlled trial 
of suvorexant in adults with insomnia . Since there are no data for 
suvorexant on trauma related nightmares and PTSD symp toms , we also 
used Taylor and colleagues’[ADDRESS_344486] of prazosin on ch anges in trauma -related nightmare 
severity  compared with  placebo  (d = 0.96 or f = 0 .48) and PTSD severity (d 
=0.79 or f = 0.40 ) and a medium -size effect on  changes in  trauma -related 
insomnia symptoms severity ( d = 0.50 or f = .25 ). Herring and colleagues 
found a small -size effect of a 1-month suvorexant treatment (20mg for 
nonelderly and  15mg for elderly) on insomnia severity measured by [CONTACT_72244] (d 
= 0.39 or f = 0. 20). To detect an f = 0.[ADDRESS_344487] in 
the proposed mixed ANOVA with 80 % power, a total of 42  participants are 
needed.   
Power analysis for Hypothesis 2b) is based on the effect sizes 
estimated using Krakow and colleagues’ findings34 from their study 
examining effects of cognitive behavio ral therapy for nightmares and 
insomnia in crime victims with PTSD. They found corr elations between 
changes in nightmare frequency, insomnia severity, and sleep quality and 
changes in overall PTSD symptom severity ranging from r = .37 to .40. A 
sample size  of 43 will allow for detecting similar size effects with 80% power.  
  
Power analys is for Hypothesis 2d) is based on findings from the 
afore mentioned Herring and colleagues’ study . They  found that effects of 
suvorexant on sleep latency and WASO  were f =0.[ADDRESS_344488] size of 0.17 using the proposed mixed  ANOVA  with 80% 
power, a total of 70 participants are needed.  
 
Power analysis for Exploratory hypothesis 2e)  is based on findings from 
the aforementioned Taylor and colleag ues’ study. They  found that the effect 
of prazosin on mean REM period duration was f = 0.50.  Using the proposed 
mixed ANOVA, a total of [ADDRESS_344489] ( f = 0.5 0) with 80% power.

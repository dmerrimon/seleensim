Objectives : To investigate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety and tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics and efficacy of BI 836858 monotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) patients with refractory or relapsed AML and  patients with AML in complete 
remission (CR) with high risk to relapse
Methodology: Open -label cohort dose escalation
No. of patient s: Planned number : about 63
        total entered :
              each treatm ent:About 36 (for refractory or relapsed AML) and 27 (for AML patients in CR)
About 3 -6 (per dose cohort, foreach patient population) 
Diagnosis : Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Main criteria
for inclusion:Adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML
AND
Patients with AML in CR with high risk to relapse defined as : 
a)AML patients with non -favor able genetics (according to European 
LeukemiaNet (ELN) classification) that are in CR after having received 
induction and consolidation chemotherapy and are not candidates for 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) (e.g., no donor 
availab le, not eligible/fit enough) 
or
b)AML patients with non -favorable genetics (according to ELN classification) 
that are in CR after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Acute m yeloid leuk emia (AML) is a heterogeneous clonal disorder of hematopoietic
progenitor cells and represents the most common malignant m yeloid disorder in adults, with a 
prevalence of 3.8 cases per 100,000 rising to 17.9 cases per 100, 000 adults aged 65 y ears and 
older (R07-2768) . The median age at present ation is about 70 years, and three men are 
affected for every  two women. Without therapeutic intervention the disease progresses and 
leads to death within months after initial diagnosis ( R07-2768 ).
Genetic alterations in leukemic cells constitute the most important factor for the prognosis of 
AML  (R07-2768, R07- 2770 , R07-2774 ). AML patients are classified in groups of favorable, 
intermediate, and unfavo rable risk. Other factors with impact on progn osis are age, 
performance score, white blood cell count, blood chemistry  disturbances and de -novo versus 
secondary  AML.
Intensive treatment approaches for AML with curative intention include two phases. The 
first, induction treatment, most commonly  consist s of cy tarabine and an anthracy cline, is 
aiming to reach aCR. The second phase, post-remission treatment, is aiming to consolidate 
remission. AML  patients under the age of 60 years achieve complete remission rates of up 
to75 % following intensive treatmen t regimens, while AML  patients over 60 years of age 
(referred to as elderly  patients) have a 40 - 60 % chance of CR when receiving intensive 
remission induction treatment ( R07-2767 ).
While the majority  of younger AML patients receive intensive treatment, a substantial 
number of elderly  patients are considered ineligible for this treatment approach 
(R07-2773 ,R07-2854 ). Therefore, the CR rates up to 60 % reported in eld erly previousl y 
untreated AML patients receiving intensive treatment are b y no means representative of the 
entire group of elderl y AML  patients. For AML patients considered ineligible to receive 
intensive treatment investigational treatments is widely  rega rded as the preferred therapeutic 
option ( R07-2769 ,R07-2772 ). With these non -approved drugs CR rates up to 20 % are 
observed in randomized Phase IIItrials . Although patients who are considered a s ineligible 
for intensive treatment constitute a generall y accepted subgroup of AML patients, no 
validated criteria are defined to judge a patient's eligibility  for intensive treatment 
(R07-2771 ). The assessment of eligibility  forintensive treatment is performed regularly for 
every  single patient based on the specialised physician's clinical experience and the 
comprehensive review of factors such as patient age, performance score, organ dy sfunctions 
and co -morbidities, as well as the patient's informed decision.
The median overall survival ( OS), for patients not achieving a CR is <1year, even with best 
palliative treatment. Even for patients who have received induction and consolidation 
treatment the OS and cure rate are poor: Over 60% will di e due to their disease within 
5years. The risk of leukemic relapse along with the poor prospects of long -term survival 
after a relapse calls for novel therapeutic strategies to maintain CR in AML .

[ADDRESS_616812] received induction and consolidation treatment and are not candidates for 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (e.g. no donor available, not eligible/fit 
enough) or have received an all ogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have a very  
high risk to relapse. For those patients no standard therap y to maintain the CR is currently 
available. 
For refractory  or relapsed AML  patients , outside of treatment in clinical trials , re-induct ion 
followed b y allogen eic stem cell transplantation is the most common regimen . However 
many  are not eligible for such an intensive treatment .For those patients with refractory or 
relapsed AML ineligible for intensive treatment, or for those with refract ory or relapses 
disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, no approved or standard treatment is 
available. 
Evidence that targeting of CD33 can result in clinical benefit for patients suffering from 
AML  is provided by [CONTACT_480093], humanized I gG1 monoclonal antibody  lintuzumab 
(SGN- 33, HuM195) which showed signs of clinical efficacy  as monotherapy  in a Phase I 
clinical trial in relapsed / refractory  AML patients with an objective response rate (ORR) 
of 17 % (R11-1481). Objective response was defined as either CR, CRi or PR .
Lintuzumab was also explored in a Phase I stud y in patients with acute promy elocy tic 
leukemia (APL) after remission induction. Multiple doses of lintuzumab could be 
administered safely  and appea red to eliminate minimal residual disease detectable b y RTPCR 
in some patients. ( R11-4695 )
Currently , major efforts arefocus edon the improvement of the therap y in these subgroups of 
patients with unfavo urable prognosis.
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
BI836858 is a full y human IgG1 antibod y specific for human CD33 which is Fc -engineered 
for increased binding to Fc RIIIa .Please see full details in latest version of Investigator’ s 
Brochure ( c02324887 -03).
CD33 is a my eloid differentiation antigen which is expressed on the cell surface of non-
malignant leukocy tes of the my eloid linea ge and with high frequen cy on malignant cells in 
AML , chronic m yeloid leukemia and m yelod ysplastic sy ndrome ( R11-1467 , R11-1468 , 
R11-1470 , R11-2960 ).In addition to expression on malignant m yeloid blast cells, CD33 
expression was reported for leukemic stem cells (R11-1469 ). For normal leukocy tes, CD33 
expression was reported for monocy tes, macrophages, dendri tic cells ,and to a lower exten t, 
granulocy tes (R11-1467 ),butnot for CD34+CD38-hematopoietic stem cells in the bone 
marrow ( R11-1469 ). Based on the expression profile of CD33, transient pharmacod ynamic 
effects of CD33 antibody treatment on CD33 positive normal cell t ypes may be expected .

ASSESSMENT
2.1 RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL
New therapeutic strategies are needed to significantly  improve the prognosis of AM L patients 
with relapsed/refractory  disease , but also for AML patients in CR with a high risk to relapse . 
Recent successful developments of signal transduction inhibitors or antibodies targeting
specific molecules that are deemed important for the malignan t cell biology have spurred the 
search for other targets and respective antibodies.
CD33 is a valid target to treat patients with AML, as CD33 is expressed on themajority  of 
AML  cells (R11-1472 )and on leukemic stem cells, bu t not outside of the hematopoietic 
system (R11-1473 ). 
CD33 targeting approaches have been evaluated in clinical trials in AML  patients. 
Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (My lotarg®), an i mmunoconjugate of a CD 33mAb and 
calicheamic in, was approved by [CONTACT_148865] ( FDA )in [ADDRESS_616816] chemotherapy . In June 2010 M ylotarg®was withdrawn b y FDA request , due to a 
negative benefit risk assessment in a Phase IIItrial. As My lotarg is an immunconjugate of a 
CD33 mAb and a toxin, the MoA and also the safety  profile are different to BI 836858. 
Clinical data of relapsed/refractory  AML patients who were treated with the humanized 
CD33 IgG1 monoclonal antibody  (mAb) lintuzumab are published (R11- 1474 , R01-1267 , 
R11-1481 ).In these trials , administration of lintuzumab was safe and has shown signsof 
clinical efficacy  (ORR )of 17 % in a Phase I trial in relapsed / refractory  AML  (R11-1481 ).  
Lintuzumab was also explored in a Phase I stud y in patients with APL  after remission 
induction. Multiple doses of lintuzumab could be administered safel y and appeared to 
eliminate minimal residual disease detectable b y RTPCR in some patients. ( R11-4695 )
The clinical experience with lintuzumab supports the assumption that targeting CD33 with an 
IgG1 -type antibod y ma y translate into clinical benefit in patients with AML with an 
acceptable side effect profile. 
 
BI 836858 is a monoclonal antibody  which mechanistically  relies on effector -cell mediated
immune mechanisms, in particular ADCC (antibody  dependent cellular cy totoxicity ) and
ADCP (antibody  dependent cellular phagocy tosis). ADCC predominantly  depends on the
presence of natural killer (NK) cells and ADCP on the presence of m yeloid derived effector
cells (i.e. monocy tes and macrophages). In a recent publication, where NK cell phenot ype 
and function was assessed in [ADDRESS_616817] 
impaired functionality . It was also shown that phenoty pic and functional abnormalities of NK 
cells are partiall y restored in AML patients achieving a CR. ( R15-6192 ).

This trial was the first administration of BI 836858 in humans.
2.2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES
The primary  objective of this trial is to determine the max imum tolerated doses (MTD s) of 
BI836858.  BI836858 is a new biological entit y (NBE) and the MTD may not be r eached . 
To learn more about t he safet y and prel iminary  effica cy there will be an expansion cohort 
either atthe MTD or the highest tested dose (e.g. 320 mg). Secondary  objectives are to 
document the safety  and tolerability  of BI 836858,  
and to evaluate efficacy  (see Section 5 ).
2.3 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT

enough) or have received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have a very  
high risk to relapse. For those patients no standard therap y to maintain the CR is currently 
available. 
BI 8368 58 is a monoclonal antibody , which specifically  targets CD33. Targeting CD33 in 
patients with AML  may  potentially  offer a benefit to those patients since CD33 is expressed 
on AML  blasts in the majority  of AML patients (see Section 1.2 ).In vitro , BI836858 is a 
potent inducer of ADCC, which results in cy tolysis of AML -derived cell lines and primary  
AML  blasts from peripheral blood and bone marrow. In the clinical setting, these effects may  
potentially  result in anti -leukemic activ ity as a monotherap y, but also offer potential for 
combination with other drugs in patients with AML.
CD33 is not known to be expressed outside of the hematopoietic sy stem. The anticipated side

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This trial will be performed in two separate patient populations: 1 ) Patients diagnosed with 
relapsed or refractory  AML  who have failed at least one prior line of therapy  and 2) patients 
with AML  who are in complete remission (CR) with a high risk to relapse. It will be 
performed in an open, non- randomized, 3+3 design followed by  [CONTACT_480095]. A cy cle 
will comprise of 14 day s. 
For patients with refractory  or relapsed AML , one cy cle is 14 day s with two administrations 
of BI 836858 (i.e. administrations on Day s 1 and 8).  Patients with clinical benefit, defined b y 
the International Working Group (IWG) as having objective response (partial remission (PR) 
or complete remission (CR) or comp lete remission with incomplete blood recovery  (CRi)) or 
subjective response (in the absence of objective response) after 8 administrations and who are 
tolerating the infusions, may  continue until progressive disease (PD) and as long as neither 
patient nor Investigator requests treatment discontinuation .
For AML patients in CR, one cy cle is 14 day s with one administration of BI 836858 (i.e. 
administrations on Day s 1)inCycles 1, 2 and 3.  From the 4thcycleonwards, patients will 
receive monthly  (every  second cy cle) infusions of BI 836858 (i.e. 4thinfusion on Cycle 5 Day  
1, 5thinfusion on Cycle 7 Day  1) for overall up to one y earof treatment unless these patients 
relapse or infusions are not tolerated.   
To determine separate MTD s for each patient popul ation , cohort dose escalation will be 
conducted following the 3+[ADDRESS_616823] one out of three patients of a cohort experiences 
a dose limiting toxicity  (DLT; for definition see Section [IP_ADDRESS] )during the first two cy cles
(DLT evaluation period) .  If exactly one out of the three patients of the co hort experiences a 
DLT, three additional patients will be treated at the same dose level.  If none of the three 
additional patients experiences a DLT, then the cohort dose escalation will be continued b y 
treating the next three patients at the next higher dose level.   If at least two out of up to six 
patients at a dose level experience a DLT, the MTD has been exceeded and the dose will be 
deescalated until a dose level is reached in which at most one DL T out of six patients is 
observed ( R01-0028 ).  The MTD is defined as the dose of BI [ADDRESS_616824] dose studied for which the incidence of dose -limiting toxicity  
is no more than 17% (i.e. 1/6 patients) during the first two cy cles.
Patients are considered to have completed the first two cy cles if they  have reached end of 
cycle [ADDRESS_616825] received all planned administrations of BI 836858 (i.e. 4 administrations for 
patients with relapsed or refractory  AML and 2 administrations for patients in CR).

[ADDRESS_616830] important secondary  objective is to assess the safety  of BI 836858.  This 
can be achieved b y an open label, single arm desig n without a control group.
Adult patients with refractory /relapsed AML are considered eligible for this trial.  
Relapsed AML is defined as recurrent disease after prior remission of an y duration. 
Refractory  disease is defined as failure to achieve remissi on to most recently administered 
therap y. Patients with primary refractory disease, defined as failure to achieve remission to 
initial therapy , are eligible. Ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y patients with primary refractory disease are defined as 
refractory  after failure of two cycles of intensive induction. Patients with failure of a single 
cycle of induction are eligible for this trial if they  refuse to receive a second induction cy cle 
or if they  are not candidates for a second intensive induction cycle. Patients receiving 
hypomethy lating agents as initial induction should receive at least two cy cles of induction 
before designation as refractory .
AML  patients in CR who have been initially  diagnosed with non-favorable genetics have a 
very high risk to relapse. Eligible patients f or this trial should either have received induction 
and consolidation treatment and are not candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (e.g. no donor available, not eligible/fit enough) or have received allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. For those patients no standard therapy to maintain 
the CR is currently  available.
These AML patient groups were selected for inclusion in this trial, because these patients 
constitute groups with unfavourable prognosis for whom curren tly no satisfactory  standard 
treatment exists.
The trial design will follow a 3+[ADDRESS_616831] planned dose (e.g., 320 mg), [ADDRESS_616832] tested dose (e.g., 320 mg) of         
BI 836858.  This trial design is accepted for hematology  Phase I stu dies.

aspi[INVESTIGATOR_480082] 2 cy cles (4 administrations).  Subsequent disease a ssessment 
will be performed after 4 cycles (8 administrations) and at the discretion of the Investigator .  
For AML patients in CR, disease status will be followed up on a regular basis with peripheral 
blood count and a bone marrow assessment will be perfo rmed if suspi[INVESTIGATOR_331540]. Patients 
with a MRD marker will be followed up on this marker as well, however this is explorative.  
Intra -patient dose escalation will be allowed for selected patients in case the next higher dose 
cohort is free of DLT and c onsidered safe. This is not considered a safet y risk because it will 
be restricted to patients who have tolerated at least three cyclesof BI [ADDRESS_616834] to safet y and the 
definition of the optimal dose for the future clinical development program in this disease .
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
Approximately  50patients with relapsed or refractory  AML and about 35AML  patients in 
CR with high risk to relapse will be screened . Of these patients, approximately  36 with 
refractory  or relapsed AML  and approximately  27 patients with AML  in CR with high risk to 
relapse will be included in this trial from a target of 5 sites. Each site will screen a target of 
about 10 patients.
A log of all patients included into the study  (i.e. having given informed consent) will be 
maintained in the investigator site file ( ISF)at the investigational site irrespective of whether 
they have been treated with investigational drug or not.
3.3.1 Main diagnosis for study entry
Patients with relapsed or refractory  AML as defined according to the World Health 
Organization (WHO) criteria will be eligible for this trial (see Section 3.2 ),
AND
Patients with AML  in CR with high risk to relapse will be eligible for this trial (see also 
Section 3.2 ). AML in CR with high risk to relapse is defined as follows:
a)AML  patients with non -favorable genetics (according to European LeukemiaNet 
(ELN) classification) that are in CR after having received induction and consolidation 
chemotherap y and are not candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (SCT) (e.g., no donor available, not eligible/fit enough)

[IP_ADDRESS] Removal of individual patients
An individual patient is to be withdrawn from the trial if:
The patient withdraws consent. Patients are free to discontinue their participation in 
this t rial at any  time without the need to justify  the decision.
The patient needs to take concomitant drugs which may  interfere with the 
investigational product (please refer to Section 4.2.2 ).
The patient is no longer able to parti cipate for other medical reasons (e.g. adverse 
events unrelated to therapy  or disease progression, concomitant diagnoses, pregnancy , 
surgery  or administrative reasons). The Investigator may also stop a patient's 
participation if the patient is no longer ab le to attend trial visits.
A patient can be withdrawn from the trial after discussion between the Investigator and the 
Sponsor if eligibility  criteria are violated and/or the patient fails to comply with the protocol.
All withdrawals will be documented and the reason for withdrawal recorded and discussed, as 
necessary , in the final report of the trial. As soon as a refractory  or relapsed AML  patient is 
withdrawn from the trial treatment , the end of active treatment (EOT) visit has to be 
performed if feasibl e. For patients with AML  in CR, as soon as a patient is withdrawn from 
the trial treatment, the end of active treatment (EOT) visit and the End of Residual Effect 
Period (REP) visit (EoR visit) must be performed if feasible.  Every  effort should be made to
follow -up with patients in case an adverse event (AE) is still ongoing at the time of 
withdrawal.   If a patient is withdrawn from the trial due to consent withdrawal , no further 
visits will be completed and no further trial data will be collected. However , if information 
about survival status is available in the public domain , then the Investigator is requested to 
report this information in the eCRF.
A patient has to discontinue trial drug administration in case:
A DLT occurs which does not recover to a de gree that allows treatment continuation 
(see Section 4.1.4 ).
Progressive disease (PD) or any other concomitant diagnosis/symptom develops 
resulting in an indication to start any  other therapy for AML, including deterioration 
of general condition.
Patients not completing the first two cy cles (with all planned BI 836858 administrations) for 
reasons other than DLT will be replaced.

duration of the infusion needs to be documented in the electronic case report form ( eCRF )
including actual start and end time, actual time points for interruption and restart of the 
infusion and the actual infusion rates.
Adverse events during the infusion will be tho roughl y documented and characterized to allow

The first and second infusion will be started at a rate of 10 mL/h. The infusion rate should be 
increased every  30 (+/ -10) minutes by  10 mL/h to a maximum of 80 mL /h as long as 
tolerated b y the patient. Infusion should not exceed [ADDRESS_616843] not exceed 120 
mL/h. If s ymptoms of an infusion -related reaction occur, the infusion should be temporaril y 
stopped. Upon recovery , it should be infused at 50% of the rate at which the reaction 
occurred and should not be dose escalated from this dose for at least 30 minutes. Lower rates 
may be selected if clinically  indicated. Depending on the time of occurrence and the severity  
of the reaction, the investigator may  consider administering additional supportive medication, 
e.g. corticosteroids. A stepwise re -increase of the infusion rate to a maximum of 80 mL /h is 
possible. For medical reasons, i n case a patient experiences an adverse event during the 
infusion, the duration of the infusion may  be expanded until the use -by [CONTACT_480099] -by [CONTACT_480101]. The actual duration of the infusion s and infusion steps need

infusion on Cycle 7 Day  1…) for overall up to [ADDRESS_616845] a high medical need and a bad prognosis . To 
treat this patient population with a s ub saturating dose is not wa rrantedand therefore a 
starting dose close to the full saturation of all CD33 sites is chosen. The starting fixed dose of 
10 mg which is a dose level expected to provide near to the full saturation of all CD33 sites at 
maximum measured plasma concentration (C max)based on estimate d receptor occupancy  (i.e. 
94.3% estimated CD33 occupancy ). For lintuzumab, a CD33 monoclonal antibody , in a 
Phase I trial no MTD was reached up to 8mg/kg/week ( R11-1481 ).A fixed dose regimen was 
chosen instead of a dose per m2based a recent publication by  [CONTACT_38874]. The individual and 
popu lation performance of body  size-based and fixed dosing in adults were compared for 12 
oncology  approved mAbs (R10-6267 ).  Although both dose regimens demonstr ated similar 
performance, the fixed dose was recommended since it offered advantages in the ease of dose 
preparation and a lower chance of dosing errors.
For details please refer to the Investigator ’s Brochure, Section 5.3.6 ( c02324887 -03).

(i.e., 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg, and 320 mg ), consecutive screening is allowed; however, 
there has to be an interval of at least 3 day s between the 1stadministration of BI 836858 for

Enrolment into the next higher dose cohort is allowed after the previous dose cohort was 
found to be safe for the initial administration for all patie nts in this cohort (e.g. at least [ADDRESS_616849] patient entered into the cohort).
Once the MTD for one of the patient populations is defined, a dose for treatment of the

For patients with refractory  or relapsed AML, r esponse will be assessed according to the 
criteri a from the IWGbased on laboratory  data from the peripheral blood , bone marrow 
examination, clinical examination (at the end of each cy cle),at the evaluation for further 
treatment -visit andthe EOT- visit.Bone marrow examination will be performed before t he 
Cycle 3 and Cy cle5 (5th and 9th administration of BI 836858) (i.e., BM performed on Day  1 
(+/-1) of cy cles 3 and 5 and treatment started on Day  1 (up to +3) of cy cles 3 and 5) and at 
the discretion of the Investigator , e.g. in case clinical and laborat ory examinations of 
peripheral blood demonstrate that a CR has been achieved, or for assessment of persistent 
neutropenia, anemia or thrombocy topenia. 
For AML patients in CR, response will be assessed clinically  and in the peripheral blood (on 
Day 1 of e ach cy cle). In the case of suspected relapse based on peripheral blood counts a 
bone marrow examination will be performed. 
Assessment and definition of bestoverall response
Response will be evaluated according to the following criteria (modified from th e IWG
criteria, R06-0452 ):
Complete remission (CR)
Morphologically  leukemia free state (i.e. bone marrow with <5% blasts b y 
morphologic criteria and no blasts with Auer rods, no evidence of extramedullary  
leukemia) and absolu te neutrophil count ≥1000 /μL and platelets ≥ 100,000 /μL .  
Patient must be independent of transfusions (no transfusion for 1 week prior to the 
assessment).
Complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery  (CRi)
All of the above criteria for CR must be met, except tha t absolute neutrophils 
<1000 /μLor platelets <100,000 /μL  in the blood.  
Partial remission (PR)
All of the criteria for CR must be met, except that leukemic blasts in the bone marrow 
may range from 5 to 25% as long as the count has decreased b y at least 50% from 
pre-study  treatment, or <5% blasts in the presence of Auer rods or abnormal 
morphology .
Stable disease (SD)
Patient alive with no CR, CRi, PR or PD.

Patient survives > 7 day s following completion of initial 2 treatment c ycles (e.g. 
28days) with persistent leukemia in the last peripheral blood smear or bone marrow 
(>25% blasts), or with persistent extramedullary  disease, but without further clinical 
deterioration due to leukemia or increase of blast population in the bone marrow or 
peripheral blood.
Resistant disease: Patient survives > [ADDRESS_616858] -course of treatment; persistent 
leukemia in blood or bone marrow .
Aplasia: Patient survives >[ADDRESS_616859] -course of treatment ; death while cy topenic, 
with aplastic bone marrow
Indeterminate cause: Patients who die < [ADDRESS_616860] therap y. Patients who die > [ADDRESS_616861] course of therap y.
Morphologic relapse (recurrence) : Reappearance of blasts post -CR or CRi in 
peripheral blood or bone marrow. That is, b one marrow leukemic blasts ≥ 5% or 
reappearance of blasts in the blood not attributable to any other cause (e.g. bone 
marrow regeneration), or development of extramedulla ry disease.
Progressive disease (PD)
Patient survives > 7 day s following completion of initial 2 treatment cy cles (e.g. 
28days) with increase of blast population in the bone marrow or peripheral blood by  
>50% or aggravation or new development of extramedu llary disease or further 
deterioration or death due to leukemia.  Patients with a global deterioration of health 
status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of PD at that 
time should be classified as having ‘ clinicall y progress ive disease’.  Every  effort 
should be made to document the objective PD even after discontinuation of treatment.
Definition of best overall response
Best overall response is defined as the best overall response (CR, CRi, PR, TF, PD or not 
evaluable in thi s order) recorded since first administration of BI 836858.

Primary  endpoints:
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
Number of patients with Dose L imiting Toxicity  (DL T) during the MTD evaluation 
period:
oFor patients with refractory  or relapsed AML, the first two cy cles (i.e. patient 
has received at least 4 administration s of BI 836858 and reached end of cycle 
2). 
oFor AML patients in CR with high risk to relapse, the first two cy cles (i.e. 
patient has received at least 2 administrations of BI 836858 and reached end of 
cycle 2).
 
As this trial is the first in human use of BI 836858, the primary  objective is to determine the 
MTD of BI 836858 and assess the safet y of the drug in humans.  For details on determination 
of MTD, please refer to Section 3.1 , Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section 7.3.1 .
The safet y of B I 836858 will be assessed b y a descriptive anal ysis of incidence and intensity  
of adverse events (AE) graded according to theCTCAE version 4.0, the incidence of DLT, 
laboratory  data and results of phy sical examination.
The Sponsor will review the safet y data with the participating Investigators at regular 
intervals and as ad hoc if needed.
The safet y endpoints will be assessed in a descriptive way  without confirmatory  anal yses.

5.2.2 Assessment of adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of AEs 
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily  have 
to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or d isease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
Adverse reaction
An adverse reaction is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and 
unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility . Adverse reactions may  arise 
from use of the product within or outside the terms of the marketing authorisation or from 
occupational exposure. Conditions of use outside the marketing authorization include off -
label use, overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE which:
results in death,
is life -threatening, this refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have 
caused death if more severe.
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23235] 
prolongation of existing h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956],
results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity , or
is a con genital anomal y / birth defect, or
is to be deemed serious for an y other reason if it is an important medical event when 
based upon appropriate medical judgment which may jeopardise the patient and may  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the above definitions.
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether other situations 
should be consider ed serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be

[ADDRESS_616867] of 
an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction.
AEs considered “Alway s Serious ”
Every  new occurrence of cancer of new histology  must be reported as a serious event 
regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and the occurrence of the 
cancer.
Cancers of new histolo gy and exacerbations of existing cancer must be reported as a serious 
event regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and the occurrence of the 
cancer .
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical E vents, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of further AEs, which by  [CONTACT_15623], can alway s be 
considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as given 
above.
The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the RDC sy stem . A copy  of the latest 
list of “Alway s Serious AEs” will be provided to y ou upon request. These events should 
alway s be reported as SAEs as described above.
Adverse events o f special interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESI 
need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same 
timeframe that applies to SAE, please see above.
The following are considered as AESIs:
infusion -related reactions (CTCAE grade 3 or higher),
any event that qualifies for DLT ,and
hepatic injury (DILI) .
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  (DILI)is defined by  [CONTACT_405744]: 
an elevation of AST and/or ALT >[ADDRESS_616868] combined with an elevat ion of total 
bilirubin >[ADDRESS_616869] measured in the same blood draw sample, and/or
marked peak aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥[ADDRESS_616870]

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the I SF. 
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab res ults 
(ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the Investigator should make sure these parameters are 
analysed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in the DILI check list should be followed
Intensit y of AEs
The intensity  of adverse events should be classified and recorded in the CRF according to the 
Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE , version 4.0, R09-2850 ).
Causal relationship of AEs
The definition of an adverse reaction implies at least a reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship between a suspected medicinal product and an adverse event. An adverse 
reaction, in contrast to an adverse event, is characterised b y the fact that a causal relationship 
between a medicinal product and an occurrence is suspected. 
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relat ionship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history . 
Arguments that may  suggest that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
•The event is consis tent with the known pharmacology  of the drug 
•The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class.
•A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
•Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced
•No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre -
existing or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
•The event is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome).
•An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is diminished).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
•No plaus ible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days / weeks 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
conc erned)
•Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_15576], taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged

AE Collection
The Investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in their patient files.
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by  [CONTACT_3786]:
From signing the informed consent onwards through the Res idual Effect Period

in the trial (i.e. if further visits incl. teleph one visits, or vital status assessments are 
planned) from then on and until the individual patient’s end of the trial the 
Investigator must report related SAEs and related AESI s. 
After the individual patient’s end of trial: 
The Investigator does not ne ed to activel y monitor the patient for AEs but should only  
report relevant SAEs and relevant AESIs of which the I nvestigator may  become 
aware of.

AE reporting to sponsor and timelines
The Investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours ) to the 
sponsor’s unique entry point (country  specific contact [CONTACT_21644] I SF). 
The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions 
the Investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not r eplace the

Information required
For each AE, the Investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate 
CRF pages and the BI SAE form. The Investigator should determine the causal relationship 
to the trial medication and any  possible interactions between the investigational drug(s) and a 
Non-Investigational Medicinal Product (NIMP) / Auxiliary  Medicinal Product (AMP) .
The following should also be recorded as an (S)AE in the CRF and SAE form (if applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions 
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they  
are judged clinically  relevant by  [CONTACT_737].
If such abnormalities already  pre-exist prior trial inclusion they  will be considered as 
baseline conditions.
All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient’s end of trial must be followed 
up until they  have resolved, have been sufficiently  characterised, or no further information 
can be obtained.
Pregnancy
In rare cases pregnancy  may  occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled into this 
clinical trial and has taken trial medication, the Investigator must report immediately (within 24 
h) a potential drug exposure during pregnancy (DEDP) in a fe male patient or in a partner to a 
male patient to the sponsor’s unique entry point (country -specific contact [CONTACT_480108]). The Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A) should be used.

[ADDRESS_616872] be 
followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry point on the Pregnancy Monitoring Form 
for Clinical Trials (Part B). 
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an a ccompanying SAE, only 
the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and not the SAE form is to be completed. If 
there is an SAE associated with the pregnancy then the SAE has to be reported on the SAE form 
in addition. 
The ISF will contain the Pregna ncy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and B). 
Exemptions to (S)AE Reporting 
Disease Progression in oncology  trials is a study  endpoint for analy sis of efficacy , and as such is 
exempted from being reported as an SAE . Progression of the patient' s underly ing malignancy  will 
be recorded on the appropriate pages of the eCRF as part of efficacy data collection only and will 
not be reported on the SAE Form. It will therefore not be entered in the safety database (Adverse 
Reactions Information System g lobal, ARISg) and hence not get expeditiously reported. Death 
due to disease progression is also to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page and not on the 
SAE Form. 
Examples of exempted events of PD may be:
Progression of underlying malignancy (Progress ive disease [PD]): if PD is clearly 
consistent with the suspected progression of AML as defined by [CONTACT_480109]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/Procedures due solely to the progression of underlying malignancy (PD) 
Clinical sy mptoms and/or signs of progression (without confirmation by [CONTACT_480110] 
e.g. imaging, clinical measurement): If the symptom can exclusively be determined to be 
due to the progression of the underlying malignancy and does meet the expected pattern 
of progression for the di sease under study. 
However, when there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the trial drug and the 
progression of the underlying malignancy, the event must be reported as an (S)AE on the SAE 
Form and on the eCRF.

SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL
This trial will be performed as an open -label stud y.  The primary objective of the trial is to 
determine the MTD of BI 836858 for both patient populations separatel y.  To determine the 
MTD, patients are entered sequentially  into escalating dose tiers usin g the 3+3 design (see 
Section 3.1 ).  After the MTD has been determined, up to 12 patients for each patient 
population are additionally  entered at this dose level to better characterize the safet yof BI 
836858.
7.2 NULL AND ALTERN ATIVE HYPOTHESES
The anal yses in this trial are descriptive and explorat ory. No formal statistical tests will be 
performed.
7.3 PLANNED ANALYSES
For the determination of the MTD, only  MTD evaluable (i.e. non -replaced patients) will be 
considered. 
For the analysis of secondary   all patients in the 
treated set (i.e. patients treated with at least one dose of BI 836858) will be included in the 
analysis, including the pati ents who have been replaced for an y reason (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
7.3.1 Primary analyses
The primary  objective for this study  is to identify the MTD (for both patient populations 
separately ) and to investigate the safet y profile of BI 836858. MTD is defined in Section 3.[ADDRESS_616893] two treatment cyclesfor 
reasons other than DLT will be excluded from the determination of MTD. 
However, for those patients who receive more than two cy cles of BI 836858, all AEs that 
constitute a DLT will be taken into consideration for the purpose of det ermining the 
recommended dose for the expansion cohort or the recommended dose for subsequent phase
IItrial(s).
DLT is defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . For the anal ysis of the tolerability  and safet y, please refer 
to Section 7.3.[ADDRESS_616894] discontinued from the trial prior 
to reaching end of cy cle 4 due to meeting t he criteria for withdrawal as outlined in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS].

trial report (CTR) will be created when the last patient has completed his/her last visit ,
including all primary  and secondary  anal yses.
7.3.2 Secondary analyses
This section outlines the anal yses for the secondary   as 
defined in Section 5.1.1 .
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Best overall response
Each patient will be assigned to one of the response categories described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Each patient’s best overall response will be used as a primary  measure. To describe response 
over time, the proportion of patients in each response category  will be tabulated at specified 
time intervals. The number of patients with objective response (best response of CR ,CRi, or 
PR)will be summarized. Patients will be followed up for assessment of response and 
progression until they  progress, receive any  other anti -leukemia therap y, die, or until the trial 
ends. The observed length of follow -up and the number of patients available for anal ysis at 
each time point will determine the period of time covered in tables and figures.  Frequency  
distribution and other descriptive statistical measures will be used to examine these varia bles.
[IP_ADDRESS] Progression free survival, time to treatment failure
These time -to-event variables will be anal yzed with the Kaplan- Meier method.
In case there is no occurrence of death , progression or treatment failure until the last visit of 
the trial the time will be censored.  The percentage of patients who are event free will be 
display ed at monthly  or greater time intervals as appropriate.  Details of censoring rules will 
be provided in the statistical anal ysis plan.
The cause of death will be summarized, along with whether death was plausible related to 
disease progression.

7.3.3 Safety analyse s
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA) coding dictionary . Standard BI summary tables and listi ngs will be produced. All 
adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and end of the residual effect period 
(REP), a period of [ADDRESS_616895] period will be considered ‘treatment-emergent’.  The residual effect 
period is defined as a period of [ADDRESS_616896] drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment -
emergent’.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system 
organ class and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the Medical 
Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA).
Laboratory  data will be analy sed both quantitatively  as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via compa rison of laboratory  data to their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be highlighted in the 
listings. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively  with regard to distribution 
paramet ers as well as with regard to frequency  and percentage of patients with abnormal 
values or clinicall y relevant abnormal values.
Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or other safet y-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the tri al and at the end -of-trial evaluation will be assessed with 
regard to possible changes compared to findings before start of treatment.
7.3.4 Interim analyses
The sponsor will continuously  monitor safet y. The dose escalation design foresees that 
regular saf ety evaluations are performed. These evaluations will be un-blinded to dose.
No formal interim anal ysis of efficacy  data is foreseen, although efficacy  data when available 
may be considered as part of the safet y evaluations.

This is a non -randomized Phase I trial. All the patients will receive BI 836858.
7.6 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
Patients with refractory  or relapsed AML:
Assuming 4 cohorts of 3 patients (i.e. no patients with DL Tat given level) and 2 cohorts of 
6 patients (i.e. [ADDRESS_616899] 3 patients so further 3 patients exposed with no 
DLTs), 24 evaluable patients will be necessary  for the dose escalation part .
Together with an assumed number of 12 additional pati ents for the expansion cohort this 
leads to a nexpected sample size of 36 evaluable patients .
AML  patients in CR:
Assuming 1 cohort of 3 patients (i.e. no patients with DL T at given level) and 2 cohorts of 
6 patients (i.e. [ADDRESS_616900] 3 patie nts so further 3 patients exposed with no 
DLTs), 15 evaluable patients will be necessary  for the dose escalation part in this patient 
population.
Together with an assumed number of 12 additional patients for the expansion cohort this 
leads to an expected s ample size of 27 evaluable AML  patients in CR.
Note that in general, the sample size is induced by [CONTACT_941] 3+[ADDRESS_616901] to different 
random factors.

10.3.1 Introduction
Alterations of liver laboratory  parameters, as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Protocol -Specified 
Significant Events), are to be furthe r evaluated using the following procedures:
10.3.2 Procedures
Repeat the following lab tests: AL T, AST, and bilirubin (total and direct) -within 48 to 
72 hours. If ALT and/or AST >3- fold ULN combined with an elevation of total bilirubin 
>2-fold ULN are co nfirmed, results of the laboratory  parameters described below must be 
made available to the Investigator and to BI as soon as possible.
In addition,
obtain a detailed history  of current sy mptoms and concurrent diagnoses and medical 
history  according to the “Drug Induced Liver Injury ( DILI )checklist” provided in the 
ISF
obtain history  of concomitant drug use (including non -prescription medications, 
herbal and dietary  supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets according t o the “DILI checklist” provided in the I SF; 
obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents (consider home and 
work place exposure) according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the I SF; and 
report these via the CRF.
Clinical chemistry
Alkal ine phosphatase, albumin, PT or I NR, CK, CK -MB, coeruloplasmin, α- 1 antitry psin, 
transferin, amy lase, lipase, fasting glucose, cholesterol, trigl ycerides

Description of change The word “the” was removed from text
Text was modified and added to allow use of 
Hydroxy urea as follows: “ Prior anti -leukemia 
therap y must have been discontinued at least two 
weeks before the first administration of the trial 
drug (Hy droxyurea may be given during study 
participation) until [ADDRESS_616929] 
treatment with BI 836858) and the patient must 
have recovered from all cl inically  relevant 
reversible toxicities as determined by  [CONTACT_1275].  
“For peripheral blood blast control, as this may 
correlate with the risk of occurrence of infusion 
related symptoms, hydroxyurea will be allowed 
(maximum dose of hydroxyurea 3gm d aily) before 
and during study participation. Leukocyte must be 
≤ 5,000/µl at start of each administration of BI 
836858. During the first two dose cohorts, if in the 
first cy cle more than 2 patients who receive 
BI836858 experience a leukocy te count over 
40,000/µl indicativ e of disease progression, then 
hydroxyurea will be allowed (maximum dose of 
hydroxyurea 3gm daily ) during the week after the 
first infusion of BI 836858 for all subsequent 
patients.
If the change of permitting h ydrox yurea is 
implemented and more than 2 of the next 6 patients 
experience the leukocy tosis (40,000/µl indicative of 
disease progression) and discontinue the due to 
disease progression in the first cy cle, then the 
eligibility  criteria will be modified such that patients 
requiring h ydrox yurea within a week of stud y entry 
to maintain WBC <30,000/ul will no longer be 
eligible.

To control the WBC, a treatment with hy droxy urea 
will be allowed. The parallel use of hy droxy urea 
may allow patients with a pro liferative disease to 
remain on the study . This may  also reduce the 
number of earl y study withdrawals, especiall y in the 
lower dose cohorts, as disease progression may  be 
controlled. 
Section to be changed Section [IP_ADDRESS] Assessment and definition of bes t 
overall response
Description of change Language updated for clarification to read as 
follows: “Response will be assessed according to 
the criteria from the IWG based on laboratory data 
from the peripheral blood, bone marrow 
examination, andclinical ex amination (at the end of 
each cycle), e.g. prior to the next dose of BI 836858,
at the evaluation for further treatment -visit and ,the 
EOT -visit., and at all follow up visits .  Bone marrow 
examination will be performed before the Cycle 3 
and Cycle 5 (5th a nd 9th administration of BI 
836858) (i.e., BM performed on Day 1 (+/- 1) of 
cycles 3 and 5 and treatment started on Day 1 (up 
to +3) of cycles 3 and 5) and at the discretion of the 
Investigator, e.g. in case clinical and laboratory 
examinations of periphera l blood demonstrate that 
a CR has been achieved, or for assessment of 
persistent neutropenia, anemia or 
thrombocytopenia. ”
Treatment Failure : added " Resistant disease: 
Patient survives ≥ [ADDRESS_616930] -course of treatment; 
persistent leukemia in blood or bone marrow.
Aplasia: Patient survives ≥[ADDRESS_616931] -course of

Perturbations

Background and Stu dy Design  
The role of the upper limbs in gait dynamics has received little attention historically, 
however surmounting evidence supports an important function of the arms in balance during 
locomotion and other dynamic tasks. Regaining balance after a perturbation is contingent on 
reactive mechanisms for re -stabilization. Rapid arm elevatio n is commonly observed in able -
bodied individuals following a perturbation, which acts to increase the moment of inertia (I), 
slowing trunk motion. In any movement context, it is plausible that the result of a perturbation, 
i.e., a fall or recovery, could rest on the ability to effectively manipulate arm motion.  A high fall 
rate has been observed in individuals with upper limb absence (ULA). A large proportion of falls 
in persons with ULA (67%) has been reported to occur during walking activities. Effects of ULA -
induced imbalance can be observed in an increase in sound arm swing during walking . Use of an 
upper limb prosthesis, which effectively reduces the mass discrepancy, might be a solution to this 
issue of imbalance. Reactive responses are yet to be expl ored in individuals with ULA with and 
without use of a prosthesis. T he objective of this cross -over intervention  study  was to  investigate 
the reactive responses of people with ULA to perturbations during walking.  
 
Protocol  
Participant s completed two baseline walking trials and 12 perturbation trials  on an 
instrumented treadmill (Motek, Enschede, Netherlands). Baseline trials  consisted of [ADDRESS_308368] at  a self-selected speed  then 1.0 m/s. The perturbation was designed to 
disrupt walking and instigate trip-like response s: the treadmill belt was programmed to accelerate 
(6.5 m/s2) to 3.3 m/s, then immediately decelerate (6.5 m/s2) to 1.0 m/s. During each trial a 
perturbation was  triggered at initial contact [CONTACT_4007] a randomly -selected step between 21 and 40 after 
the belt reached 1.0 m/s and delivered during single limb stance of the sound /dominant  or 
impaired /non-dominant  arm side (6 per side).  Participant s walked for twenty strides after 
restoration of reciprocal gait before the treadmill  was stopped. Side/step r andomization minimize d 
anticipatory effects of knowledge of the perturbation timing on motor response. Prosthesis users 
completed all tasks with and without their customary prosthesis , order randomized .  
Mass, COM location and I of each prosthesis were estimated using an oscillation cage and 
reaction board. I was estimated about the medial -lateral  axis of rotation at the prosthesis proximal 
end and translate d to its COM  using the parallel axis theorem .   
 
Data Analysis  
Kinematic data were collected with a 12 -camera motion capture system (Motion Analysis, 
Rohnert Park , CA) at 120  Hz. Data were exported to Visual 3D (C -motion, Germantown, MD), 
filtered using a 4th -order low -pass (9 Hz) Butterworth filter , and a customized 12 -segment model 
was applied . The assumption of uniform density [36] was applied to estimat e segment mass as a 
percentage of body mass , COM position and I, except for the ULA impaired limb  where the 
forearm was modified based on the prosthesis condition .   
Initial contact [CONTACT_253465] a velocity -based algorithm and corrected 
manually. L was estimated by [CONTACT_253466], summing the values according to Eq. 1, where, for each segment 
i, 𝜔𝑖⃗⃗⃗⃗  is the angular velocity , 𝑟𝑖⃗⃗  is the distance from segment COM to whole -body  COM, 𝑚𝑖 is the 
mass and 𝑣𝑖⃗⃗⃗  is relative velocity .  
𝐿⃗ =∑𝐼𝑖⃗⃗ 𝜔𝑖⃗⃗⃗⃗ +𝑟𝑖⃗⃗ ×𝑚𝑖𝑣𝑖⃗⃗⃗ 𝑛
𝑖=[ADDRESS_308369] angle between the upper arm long 
axis ( line connecting shoulder and elbow marker s) and t horax  long axis ( line connecting midpoint 
between shoulder  markers and pelvis center ) and  add-abduction angle was that relative angle in 
the coronal -plane . Five perturbation trials on each side were averaged  with the first (naïve) trial 
excluded because of exaggera ted reaction s to first -side perturbation . 
 
Statistical Analysis  
Descriptive statistics  are produced for Lrange (recovery  minus baseline) , shoulder joint 
range -of-motion during recovery , maximum trunk flexion angl e, and maximum trunk flexion 
velocity for each condition  (controls: with arms free and with non-dominant arm bound ; upper 
limb absence: w ithout weari ng th e prosthesis and with wearing the pr osthesis).

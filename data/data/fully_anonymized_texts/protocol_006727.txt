1. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW  
 
 We intend to explore the hypothesis that symptoms of schizophrenia may be reduced by [CONTACT_43602] a sulforaphane compound when used in addition to standard antipsychotic 
medications.  Sulforaphane is a molecule that belongs to the isothiocyanate group of organosulfur 
compounds found in broccoli sprouts. Sulforaphane has  potent anti -oxidant and anti -inflammatory 
activities (Juge, Mithen, & Traka 2007).  A recent trial in adolescent and young adult males with 
autism spectrum disorder found that sulforaphane treatment as an add- on medication was associated 
with improved psychiatric  symptoms (Singh et al. 2014). To date, there have not been any 
controlled studies of sulforaphane in persons with schizophrenia. The proposed trial is justified on the grounds that: 1) oxidative stress is associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and  sulforaphane has anti -oxidant and anti -inflammatory properties; 2) positive effects of sulforaphane 
have been found in autism, a disorder with some similarities to schizophrenia; and 3) th e compound 
has relatively low toxicity and a low side effect profile.  If this sulforaphane compound is found to be beneficial, it would provide a safe, inexpensive, and widely- available new modality for the 
adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia.        
  We will randomize N=[ADDRESS_410534] moderate severity. The participants will receive the sulforaphane compound 6 tablets once per day (equivalent to ~ 100 micromoles (µmol) of sulforaphane) or placebo [ADDRESS_410535] and of retaining participants in  the study. This is also similar to the duration of 
the active phase in the published autism trial (Singh et al. 2014).    The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_331884] [ADDRESS_410536] been published (Dickerson, Boronow, Stallings, Origoni, & Yolken 2003; Dickerson, Stallings, Boronow, Origoni, Sullens & Yolken 2009; Dickerson et al. 2009; Dickerson et al. 2014; Dickerson et al. 2009; Dickerson et al. 2011; Fenton, Dickerson, Boronow, Hibbeln & Knable 
2001).  The Investigational New Drug Application (IND 130136) was recently reviewed by [CONTACT_331892] a “may proceed” l etter on April 20, 
2016.

2. SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
Schizophrenia and Oxidative Stress 
 Schizophrenia is a pervasive human disease of unknown etiology. In recent years, evidence 
has accumulated indicating that some cases of schizophrenia are associated with oxidative stress (Boskovic, Vovk, Kores Plesnicar, & Grabnar 2011; Do, Conus, & Cuenod 2010; Saruwatari et al. 2013). Oxidative stress reflects an imbalance between the systemic manifestation of reactive oxygen species and a biological system's ability to readily detoxify the reactive intermediates or to repair the resulting damage. Diminis hed anti-oxidants and/or increased production of reactive 
species will result in oxidative damage of cell lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], proteins, enzymes, carbohydrates, and DNA (Boskovic et al. 2011). In schizophrenia, oxidative stress is also associated with immune activation  (Pedrini et al. 2012). Oxidative damage has been suggested to be a common 
pathogenic process in this disorder which contributes to ongoing psychiatric symptoms and poor outcomes.     
Sulforaphane   
 It is widely recognized that high consumption of plant- based diets reduces the risk of cancer 
and many other chronic diseases (Hardman 2014; Vanamala 2015).  Evidence for the special protective role of cruciferous plants, such as broccoli, is very strong a nd has been ascribed 
largely to their high content of glucosinolates. Whereas glucosinolates are themselves not active protectors, they are converted to active compounds by [CONTACT_331893], myrosinase, and by [CONTACT_331894] (GI) tract to isothiocyanates which are extremely effective blockers of carcinogenesis (Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_70040]. 2006).  A widely studied example is the presence in broccoli sprouts of the glucosinolate, glucoraphanin, which is converted by 
[CONTACT_331895], sulforaphane (Fahey, Zhang, & Talalay 1997; Fahey, 
Zalcmann, & Talalay 2001).  Myrosinase is present in plant cells and is compartmentalized separately from the glucosinolates. Sulforaphane is metabolized rapi[INVESTIGATOR_331885], and successive steps of hydrolysis of the conjugates leading to ultimate 
formation of the N- acetyl -cysteine derivative. All these conjugates are dithiocarbamates and can 
be quantified by [CONTACT_331896]. Jed Fahey, one of the study investigators (Ye et al. 2002). Sulforaphane crosses the blood brain barrier and has general but potent indirect anti- oxidant and anti -inflammatory activities 
which function systemically (Bahadoran, Mirmiran, & Azizi 2013; Dinkova-Kostova & Talalay 2008; Fahey & Kensler 2007; Fahey & Talalay 1999; Koo, Park, Kim, & Lee 2013).     The major mechanism by [CONTACT_331897]2-mediated induction of phase [ADDRESS_410537] oxidative damage and promote the removal of carcinogens. However, there may be additional mechanisms activated in response to sulforaphane including suppression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, induction of apoptotic pathways, suppression of cell  cycle 
progression, inhibition of angiogenesis, and inhibition of inflammation (Fahey et al. 2015).    The compound which we will use in this trial is a sulforaphane compound which was developed by [CONTACT_331898]
®. The compound 
contains a precursor of sulforaphane, glucoraphanin, formulated with an enzyme, myrosinase, 
 [ADDRESS_410538]. This compound is the 
only one available on the consumer market which co-delivers glucoraphanin and the enzyme, myrosinase, needed to hydrolyze it to its active form, sulforaphane, and which is shelf- stable at 
room temperature. This same compound is also being used in two other tr ials with psychiatric 
populations (A 6-month Randomized, Placebo Controlled Study to Evaluate Sulforaphane Add-on Effects In Treatment of First Onset and Early Stage Schizophrenia; Sulforaphane Treatment Of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder ).   
  Until now, many clinical studies targeting sulforaphane have utilized a hydrolyzed broccoli 
sprout extract prepared and standardized by [CONTACT_331899]. The use of the hydrolyzed broccoli sprout extract is burdens ome in clinical 
trials because the sulforaphane is only moderately stable over time and the product must be kept frozen to maintain bioavailability; in addition, the percent of the dose excreted in urine as sulforaphane is relatively low. The cost, convenience, reproducibility, and potential for post-study continuance are all attractive features of a commercially available supplement compared to the made- for-clinical -trials -only broccoli sprout extract preparation.  
  It is of note that although [CONTACT_331921] f irst described and developed broccoli sprouts as a 
source of glucoraphanin, neither he, nor the other researchers at Johns Hopkins or Sheppard Pratt involved in this study are connected with Nutramax, the company that produces the Avmacol
® 
product, nor will they benefit from the sales of any Nutramax product.  
Previous Clinical Trials of Sulforaphane Supplementation in Neuropsychiatric Populations 
 A randomized controlled trial of broccoli sprout extracts was performed by [CONTACT_145559]. (2014) in N=44 adolescent and adult males with autism spectrum disorders. The effects on 
behavior of daily oral doses of sulforaphane (50-150 µmol ) for 18 weeks followed by 4 weeks 
without the treatment were quantified by [CONTACT_331900]. After the treatmen t period, those 
randomized to sulforaphane showed substantial improvements in social interaction, abnormal 
behavior, and verbal communication, whereas those assigned to placebo showed minimal change. After discontinuation of the sulforaphane, the actively-treated group reverted to baseline levels on the behavioral measures (though 10 of 26 who received active compound were not seen for the follow -up). The number of adverse events did not differ between the groups; one 
participant receiving the active compou nd experienced a single seizure during the trial and one 
participant experienced a single seizure several weeks after discontinuing treatment; both had a history of seizure disorder which is common in people with autism.  
  A second trial of broccoli sprout extracts in psychiatric patients was recently reported and was a small open -label trial of N=10 adult outpatients with schizophrenia, 7 of whom completed 
the trial (Shiina et al. 2015). Participants received a daily dose of 30 mg of the precursor, glucoraphanin (sulforaphane-glucosinolate), per day for [ADDRESS_410539] Learning Task, improved in the trial but not the other tasks or ratings of psychiatric symptom severity. The sulforaphane compound was well tolerated. The very small sample size in this trial, the short treatment period, and the open-label design preclude any conclusions about the efficacy of the compound in schizophrenia. In addition, the study compound consisted of the 
 4 precursor, glucoraphanin, which was administered without the added enzyme, myrosinase, and 
likely had a conversion to sulforaphane which was 10% of that in the Singh et al. (2014) trial.   
Preliminary Investigation to Determine Bioavailability of Study Compound 
 This preliminary investigation is currently being carried out by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Fahey of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. In brief, 20 healthy adult volunteers will be recruited from previous studies and advertisements. Participants will be screened after consent based on whether they are able to comply with the dietary restrictions and medication exclusions.   They 
will be asked to refrain from consuming cruciferous vegetables and condiments (e.g., mustard, horseradish, wasabi) that might contain glucosinolates or isothiocyanates for [ADDRESS_410540] overnight and the following morning.  They will then take 7 Avmacol
® tablets orally; each tablet will contain [ADDRESS_410541] 8 hours and for the following 16 hours, in segregated collections. T otal dithiocarbamate excretion in each urine sample (three per 
participant) and urine creatinine concentrations will be determined.  Dithiocarbamates (DTC) are the ultimate metabolites of sulforaphane excreted in the urine, and are readily measured by [CONTACT_331901] (Ye et al. 2002).  It is expected 
that the conversion of the oral dose to the excreted DTC will be about 40%, but any mean conversion of >10% (the mean bioavailability without added myrosinase) will be considered acceptable. Preliminary results from this study are that conversion is at least 35% (personal communication, JW Fahey, March 9, 2016).  
Aims  
The primary aim of the study is: 
1. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a sulforaphane compound for individuals with schizophrenia who have residual psychotic symptoms of at least moderate severity in a double blind trial. The primary outcome will be the severity of psychiatric symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_331902] (PANSS) (Kay, F iszbein, & Opler 
1987).  We will also measure cognitive functioning with the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) (Nuechterlein et al. 2008).  
 
Secondary aims of the study are: 
2. To study the effect of the sulforaphane compound in lowering several biom arkers of 
inflammation including C -Reactive Protein (CRP), heat shock protein 90, and other 
markers of inflammation and cell damage.  
3. To investigate the association between the efficacy of sulforaphane therapy and initial and follow-up levels of these markers.  
 
3. INFORMED CONSENT  
 
 The informed consent form will contain a full explanation of the possible risks, alternative treatment options, and availability of treatment in the case of injury, in accordance with the Federal Regulations as described in 21CFR50.

5. STUDY DESIGN AND PROCEDURES  
 
Study Overview 
 Over a two year  period, we will randomize N=[ADDRESS_410543] a drop-out rate of 15% after randomization. The trial will begin with a 2 week single-blind placebo run-in phase followed by a 16 week double-blind phase. During the placebo run-in phase, participants will receive placebo 6 tablets o nce per day. During the double-blind phase, 
participants will receive either the sulforaphane tablet 6 tablets once per day (equivalent to ~100 µmol of sulforaphane) or the placebo 6 tablets once per day. The primary outcome that will be assessed is the severity of psychiatric symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_331902] (PANSS) (Kay et al. 1987). We will also measure cognitive functioning with the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) (Nuechterlein et al. 2008). In addition, we will study the effect of the sulforaphane compound in lowering several biomarkers of 
inflammation including C -Reactive Protein (CRP), heat shock protein 90, and other markers of 
inflammation and cell damage. We will also investigate the association between the efficacy of sulforaphane therapy and initial and follow- up levels of these markers. For a detailed list of 
procedures and assessments at each study visit, see the Schedule of Assessments.  
 
Study Compound 
 The active study compound and identical-appearing placebo will be prepared and provided by [CONTACT_273408], Edgewood, MD, [LOCATION_003], the company that makes Avmacol
®, a 
commercially -available over -the-counter compound (http://www.nutramaxstore.com/avmacolreg -
60-tablets -p430.aspx).  The active ingredient i n Avmacol® is produced naturally by [CONTACT_331906], glucoraphanin, from broccoli seeds, and compressing it in tablets with active myrosinase from broccoli sprouts. The ingestion of this compound leads to the 
 7 hydrolysis of glucoraphanin and the generation of sulforaphane within the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract and the subsequent systemic absorption of the sulforaphane.  
 The dose per tablet is 16 mg of glucoraphanin or 37 µmol; 6 tablets per day should yield about 100 µmol of sulforaphane (Fahey et al. 2015). The study compound will be provided as a 
.[ADDRESS_410544] tablet, about the size of a regular (325 mg) enteric -coated 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] . The compound will be taken orally, once per day. Once per day dosing is selected in 
order to optimize compliance.  
   The study compound will be stored in a freezer until time of dispensing for maximum assurance of potency even though Nutramax certifies it for [ADDRESS_410545]. Information needed to determine eligibility will be obtained through careful review of the participant’s medical record, previous study documents, discussion with the treatment team,  and/or participant interview. After likely eligibility is 
established, the participant will be seen for the screening visit.  
 
Screening Visit  
 The screening visit assessments will be completed within 1 to 14 days of the research staff 
obtaining the signed consent or until sufficient evidence exists to fully assess inclusion and exclusion criteria. The screening assessments include obtaining informed consent, symptom and SCID- 5 (First et al. 2015) interviews, a detailed psychiatric history (obtained from av ailable 
medical records, previous study documents, and participant self- report), a physical examination 
and medical history, and clinical laboratory tests as described in more detail below.  
  The clinical laboratory tests collected at the screening visit w ill include a complete blood 
count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (CMP), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), urinalysis, urine drug screen, and urine pregnancy test (if female and of child- bearing potential). Subsequent 
drug screening may be done at any time throughout the study at the discretion of the principal investigator.   A complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (CMP), and urinalysis 
will be repeated at visit 11 (week 18).  
 8  
 Vital signs, including blood pressure, temperature, pulse, height, and weight will be collected at the screening visit and repeated at visit 7 (week 10) and visit 11 (week 18).   The following will be obtained, collected, and/or verified during the screening visit:  
Diagnostic and Background Information: 
• Primary DSM -5 Axis I diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (APA 
2013) as determined by [CONTACT_57404]- 5 (First et al. 2015)  
• Background information including age, race, gender, participant and participant’s parents’ educational attainment, and p sychiatric and medical history  
• Assessment of past and recent suicidal behavior evaluated with a suicide screening 
assessment that is based on the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (Posner et al. 
2011) 
• List of current medications (may be obtained from the participant’s medical records)  
• Co-occurring medical conditions (obtained through a brief review of systems and/or 
medical records), and vital signs 
• Physical examination (unless one has been completed within the past 30 days and documented in medical re cords accessible to the research staff)  
• Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory tests as described above   
• Written consent to contact [CONTACT_331907]:  
• Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (Kay et al. 1987), a rater- based scale 
used to assess and measure the severity of psychiatric symptoms over the past one week (unless previously obtained within the last one week) 
  The screening visit wil l take approximately two hours to complete and may be divided into 
separate sessions to minimize participant fatigue.   
 
Research Laboratory Measures   
Samples for these measures will be obtained at visit 2 (week 0), the start of the placebo run -in 
phase, and other time points as noted below.  
• Blood sample (approximately 2 0 ml)  to  measure levels of immune markers and antibodies 
to infectious agents including high sensitivity CRP, TNF alpha, antibodies to food antigens such as casein and gliadin (Severance et al. 2012),  and antibodies to NR2 (Dickerson, Stallings, Vaughan, Origoni, Khushalani, and Yolken 2012). Of note, CRP is a non- specific 
marker of inflammation which is elevated in many individuals with schizophrenia and has been found to be reduced by [CONTACT_43602] a sulforaphane nutraceutical (Bahadoran et al. 2013). These measures will also be performed at visit 7 (week 10) and visit 11 (week 18). 
• Blood sample (approximately 8 ml) used to measure levels of biomarkers of inflammation  
including Keap1/Nrf2- induced markers of cytoprotection and of the heat shock response (in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells), using real time PCR and protein gels (Western blots).  These samples will be analyzed in the Johns Hopkins Cullman Chemoprotection 
 [ADDRESS_410546]. Fahey.  These measures will also be pe rformed at visit 7 (week 10) and visit 
11 (week 18).  
• Blood sample (4- 6 ml) for the measurement of the blood level of the antipsychotic 
medication. . These measures will be performed also at visit 11 (week 18).  
• Throat swab sample s for study of the oropharyngeal microbiome .  These measures will be 
performed  at visit 2 (week 0), visit 7 (week 10), and visit 11 (week 18)  
• Urine sample for compliance and dose potency testing. Sulforaphane -glutathione 
dithiocarbamate (DTC) metabolites will be measured from urine provided by [CONTACT_331908]. These tests will also be performed at the Johns Hopkins Cullman Chemoprotection Center. These measures will also be performed at visit 7 (week 10) and visit 11 (week 18).  
 
 These blood, throat swab,  and urine samples will be identified by [CONTACT_331909]. The clinical investigators will be blind to these results of the participant’s research laboratory tests during the course of the trial. The laboratory scientists will be blind to the participant’s treatment assignment during the course of the trial.  
 
Placebo Lead -In Phase 
 Participants will begin a 2 week single-blind placebo phase at visit 2 (week 0), within 7 to 30 
days of completion of the screening visit. Visit 2 (week 0) will take approximately two to three hours to complete. Participants who complete the two week placebo run-in phase and continue to meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to a treatment arm at visit 3 (week 2).  
 
Randomization and Double- Blind Treatment Phase 
 Double-blind randomization will occur at visit 3 (week 2).  Participants will be randomized to 
receive either the sulforaphane compound or placebo tablets which are indistinguishable from the sulforaphane tablets for the 16 weeks of the double-blind phase. Symptom evaluations will be completed at bi- weekly study visits at which time participants will also be evaluated for adverse 
events. Visits 3 to 10 (weeks 2 to 16) will take approximately one hour each to complete. Visit 11 (week 18) will take approximately two to three hours to complete.  
 
 Randomization will assure that out of N=[ADDRESS_410547] 
will be aware of participant assignment during the trial.  
 
 Treatment providers will be asked to maintain participants on the same psychotropic medicatio n regime throughout the study. At each bi- weekly study visit, research staff will 
document any medication changes. Any medication changes that are made will be studied as a secondary outcome. 
 
 The study compound will be taken once per day and the dose will not be adjusted throughout the trial.  
 
 10 Visit Windows  
 Visit 2 (week 0) will take place 7 to 30 days after visit 1 (screening). Visits 3 to 11 (weeks 2 
to 18) will take place 12 to 16 days after the previous visit. Visits may be divided into separate 
sessions to minimize participant fatigue.  
 
Compliance 
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_67911]/or participant reports of compliance will be obtained. If pi[INVESTIGATOR_331889], the participant will be counseled about the importance of following directions. If the participant has 
missed more than 32 daily doses cumulatively throughout the study (>25% of study drug), the participant will be terminated from the study.  
 
 Compliance will also be con firmed with laboratory testing of urine samples provided by 
[CONTACT_79199] 3 points during the trial (visits 2, 7, and 11). Participants will be told that these samples will be collected at random. These urine samples will be used to measure sulforaphane-glutathione metabolites in [CONTACT_331921]’s laboratory.      
Discontinuation  
A participant may be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons: 
• If the participant fails to follow study directions (failure to keep appointments, follow directions  or take the study compound as instructed) 
• If the participant does not attend study visits, or is not in contact [CONTACT_331910] 3 bi-weekly consecutive study visits 
• If the participant has a positive drug screen, research staff will inform the part icipant that 
a repeat test will be done at the next visit; if the next test is positive then she/he will be removed from the study 
• If it is the judgment of the study physician, in an effort to improve the participant’s medical care, or if the participant d evelops a serious medical illness, becomes pregnant, 
or begins breast feeding  
• If the participant has unexpected or serious side effects or serious medical complications 
  If a participant discontinues from the study, discontinuation assessments will be done at the discretion of the principal investigator.    A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request.  
 
Clinical Outcome Measures  
• The primary outcome measurement will be the change in scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (Kay et al. 1987) from the beginning to the end of the double-blind treatment phase, visits 3 to 11 (weeks 2 to 18).  The PANSS contains 30 items that assess symptoms of schizophrenia including positive, negative and general symptom psychopathology. The PANSS was chosen because of its widespread use in clinical studies of psychosis and its demonstrated reliability in assessing psychopathology across diverse patient populations. 
 
 11 • Secondary outcomes will be changes in scores on the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive 
Battery (MCCB) (Neuchterlein et al. 2008). The MCCB is comprised of  7 cognitive domains and 10 related tests (Trail Making Test: Part A; Brief Assessment  in Cognition in 
Schizophrenia: Symbol Coding; Hopkins Verbal Learning Test -Revised; Wechsler Memory 
Scale- Third Ed: Spatial Span; Letter- Number Sequencing; Neuropsychological Assessment 
Battery: Mazes; Brief Visuospatial Memory Test -Revised; Category Fluency: Animal 
Naming; Mayer -Salovey- Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test: Managing Emotions; and 
Continuous Performance Test -Identical Pairs).  
 
6. SAFETY  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board 
 This committee will be composed of a group of three scientists who are not directly involved with the study and are qualified to serve in an advisory capacity in order to evaluate safety and efficacy of the trial. The safety monitoring board will convene before the study begins and, after the trial is underway, at regular intervals that they determine to be appropriate or at other times at the request of the study investigators.   
 
Physical Examination and Clinical Laboratory Tests  
 A physical examination will be performed at the screening visit (unless one has been 
completed within the past 30 days and documented in medical  records accessible to the research 
staff). Clinical laboratory tests including CBC, CMP, thyroid stimulating ho rmone (TSH), and 
urinalysis will also be performed. The study physician will determine the participant’s medical eligibility for the study after reviewing the findings from the screening physical examination and laboratory tests.   
 
 In the event that the study physician determines that a participant’s lab value is clinically 
significant, the participant will be made aware of the abnormal laboratory finding and will be referred for follow -up with his/her primary care physician or other appropriate medical c are.  
Lab results may be sent to participant’s primary care physician or other treatment providers.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_331890]- work will be made available to participants upon their request. Clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings may be repeated to determ ine the participant’s 
eligibility for the study.  
  In the case of serious medical illness and/or abnormal laboratory findings that emerge in the 
course of the study, the study physician may determine that a participant should be terminated or excluded from the study.  
Pharmacy Oversight  
 The study compound will be kept in a locked freezer which is monitored daily for temperature by a computerized monitoring system. Supplement storage and audits will be performed quarterly by [CONTACT_331911], [CONTACT_331922].  
 
Minimizing Risk  
 Participants will be maintained on their regular psychotropic medications, with the intent to 
avoid any changes in dose or medication. Each participant will be instructed and expected to 
 12 continue treatment with his /her mental health providers and to remain on his/her prescribed 
psychotropic medications throughout the study. During the study, participants will be seen on a 
bi-weekly basis during scheduled visits and assessed for the presence of any adverse events.  
 
 If a participant reports psychiatric symptoms that raise concern about safety such as 
imminent, potentially -dangerous behavior, research staff will consult with the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or study physician and may contact [CONTACT_2299]’s current treatment providers. Permission to contact [CONTACT_331912]. Research staff will encourage participants to seek immediate help in these cases. Additionally, research staff may arrange for emergency assessment if a participant presents as a danger to self or others, in consultation with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the study physician. If safety cannot be assured, research staff will call [ADDRESS_410548] -protected with access 
available o nly to the research staff. Any screening information obtained from potential research 
participants who subsequently do not participate in the research study will be destroyed.  
 
 Data obtained in this study will be shared with the National Database for Clinical Research 
Related to Mental Illness (NDCT), which is required by [CONTACT_331913]. NDCT is a data 
repository run by [CONTACT_17144] (NIMH) that allows researchers to 
collect and share de- identified data from studies related to mental illness. Other researchers may 
apply to obtain access to de- identified data from this study.  The NIMH carefully analyzes each 
request in order to minimize risks of privacy. The information provided to NDCT may help researchers around the world tr eat future children and adults with mental illnesses so that they 
have better health outcomes. Participants will not be contact[CONTACT_331914], and no protected health information will be entered into the NDCT.     
Adverse Effects and Drug Interactions  
 Broccoli sprouts have been widely marketed throughout the world as a food source. Oral broccoli sprout preparations have been used in a number of human studies as described above to investigate the pharmacologic properties, safety, and biological effects of sulforaphane glucosinolates. Avmacol
® supplements have been available to the public since 2013.  The 
manufacturer reports that as of February 15, 2016, over 12,[ADDRESS_410549] been reported in the many clinical trials of glucoraphanin-rich or sulforaphane-rich broccoli sprout extrac ts (Alumkal 
et al. 2015; Cornblatt et al. 2007; Egner et al. 2011; Egner et al. 2014; Fahey, Talalay, & Kensler 
 13 2012; Heber et al. 2014; Kensler et al. 2012; Poulton et al. 2013; Riedl, Saxon, & Diaz- Sanchez 
2009; Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_70040]. 2006; Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152], Fahey, Wade, Stephenson, & Talalay 1998; Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152], Fahey, 
Wade, Stephenson, & Talalay 2001; Singh et al. 2014; Ye et al. 2002). True allergic reactions to broccoli (as opposed to intolerance or taste aversion) have never been reported.  Sulforaphane might decrease how quickly the liver breaks down some medications because of the modulation of cytochrome enzymes such as P450; however, the extent of this effect is expected to be limited at the doses we are using. Moreover, the effects of sulforaphane on the modulation of drug metabolism/transport enzymes are varied and may serve to increase or to decrease the blood levels of medications that are metabolized by [CONTACT_4852] (Fimognari, Lenzi, & Hrelia 2008).  We will measure blood levels of antipsychotic medications at the beg inning and end of the trial with 
tests performed by a local clinical laboratory.  
  It is of note that numerous other factors influence drug interactions in addition to P450 isoenzymes including age, gender, smoking, and genetic factors. Also, 30 to 40% of the participants in the previous Singh et al. (2014) study in adult autism were receiving antipsychotic medications; per the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_37105], clinical worsening was observed in only one subject and he turned out to be on placebo (A. Zimmerman, personal communication, Sept 4, 2015). 
 
Adverse Events and Reporting 
 For the purposes of collecting and evaluating all information found during this trial, an adverse event is any undesirable or unexpected experience that occurs after informed co nsent has 
been obtained without regard to the possibility of a causal relationship, and without regard to treatment group assignment. A serious adverse event is any adverse event that: results in death; is life threatening; results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_178665]; 
results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or results in congenital anomaly/birth defect. For all adverse events, research staff will question the participant regarding the occurrence and  nature of the event and will document the information obtained. Adverse events 
shall be followed until they return to baseline or stabilize regardless of whether the participant has discontinued the study early or completed the final study visit, visit 11  (week 18); if 
occurring at the end of the study, the adverse events will be referred to the participant’s primary care physician and/or other treatment provider for continued treatment and/or follow-up.  All serious adverse events will be documented and r eported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
within the required time period. All adverse events will be summarized in a report at intervals requested by [CONTACT_331915]. 
 
7.  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
 Power calculations indicate that a sample size of N=64 has 80% power to find an effect size 
of d = .76 with an alpha =.[ADDRESS_410550] of change between groups from screening to end of study.    
 Aim 1:   Safety data will be analyzed using incidence density anal ysis, to compare rates of 
adverse events across groups, as well as survival analysis, to assess group differences in retention. PANSS total scores will be the primary efficacy endpoint.  Repeated -measures 
regression models will be used to assess the main effects of group and time, plus the time by [CONTACT_102938]. This method is able to utilize all available data from participants with 
 14 incomplete follow-up, thus including participants who drop out of the study.  (Based on our 
experience in previous trials with this population, we anticipate attrition of about 15% over the course of the trial.) A similar analytical approach will be used for the PANSS subscales and the MCCB outcome measures.  
 
Aim 2 : Repeated measures regression modeling will also be used to evaluate the effect of 
medication group, time, and their interaction on inflammatory biomarkers. 
 
Aim 3 : Treatment groups will be compared with respect to initial and follow -up levels of 
inflammatory biomarkers using t -tests.   If groups are found to differ in this regard, the efficacy 
analyses will be repeated, adding the initial biomarker levels as covariates in the model.  
 
8. COMPENSATION  
 
 Participants will receive $20 for completing visit 1 (screening) and $20 for completing visit 2 
(week 0).  For visits 3 to 10 (weeks 2 to 16), participants will receive $15 for each visit. At visit 11 (week 18), the ending visit, participants will receive $20 for completing the visit and an additional $40 completion bonus (for a total of $60). The maximum compensation received by a participant who completes the entire trial will be $220.

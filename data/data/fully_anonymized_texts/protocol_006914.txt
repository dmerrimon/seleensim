Précis: We use MRI to evaluate the extent, as well as, the structure, composition, 
and functional aspects of atherosclerotic plaques in human  carotid and 
femoral arteries in patients scheduled to undergo an endarterectomy of the 
aforementioned vascular beds as part of their routine clinical care. The 
endarterectomy specimens removed at surgery will allow a direct 
comparison between the MRI info rmation obtained prior to the surgery and 
the histopathological analyses of the arterial specimens. The vascuCAPTM 
measurements of structural and functional features of the arterial wall will 
be performed in patients undergoing endarterectomy. Measured res ults will 
be compared in a blinded fashion with histology to assess performance of 
plaque profiling and build a pi[INVESTIGATOR_325607] .

ELUCID CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY INFORMATION-NOT FOR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION                 2 2 INTRODUCTION:  BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE 
MRI is a safe, painless, and non-invasive way to image the body interior without harmful 
radiation. MRI provides superior information to conventional imaging studies because it can 
provide additional information regarding the chemical makeup of the atherosclerotic plaque. We 
have recently conducted imaging studies in a specialized rabbit model of atherosclerosis [ 1-5] 
that have served as a scientific rationale for the development of a computerized image analysis 
toolkit, vascuCAP™ [ 6]. 
2.[ADDRESS_402204] the likelihood of the plaque to produce acute ischemic events 
(instability). MRI provides unparalleled soft-tissue resolution non-invasively and has the 
potential to characterize plaque structural and functional components without invasive 
procedures.

2.2 Rationale 
We hypothesize that in vivo MRI examinations of patients, when suitably acquired and analyzed 
with the vascuCAP™ analysis software, can provide a sufficiently accurate profile of plaque 
characteristics to provide an objective basis for patient management. 
We propose to use MRI to evaluate the extent, as well as, the structure, composition, and 
functional aspects of atherosclerotic plaques in >=110 patients (8 0 carotid patients and 30 
femoral patients) scheduled to undergo an endarterectomy of the aforementioned vascular beds 
as part of their routine clinical care. These patients will be undergoing endarterectomies to 
mitigate their clinical risk or symptoms for things such as strokes, claudication, and critical limb 
ischemia. The endarterectomy specimens removed at surgery will allow a direct comparison 
between the MRI information obtained prior to the surgery, and the histopathological analyses of 
the arterial specimens. All patients will undergo a MRI examination within 30 days of the 
surgical procedure. Histological samples will be analyzed to identify neovascularization, intra-
plaque hemorrhage, collagen types, necrotic core, and other hallmarks of plaque severity. 
Histology and MRI will be co-registered, step-sectioning through the endarterectomy specimen 
using the suture-marked proximal and distal ends and anterior face as the anatomical markers. 
We create ground truth maps from histology of the excised specimens with the pre-operative 
MRI. This allows for careful mappi[INVESTIGATOR_325609]. This will allow for careful training and testing of the 
image based classifiers to identify and characterize the plaque regions. Study duration, from

of Radiology (ACR) Manual on Contrast Media stated th e frequency of all acute adverse events 
after an injection of 0.1-0.2 mmol/kg of gadolinium chelate ranges from 0.07-2.4%. The vast 
majority of these reactions are mild, including coldness at the injection site, nausea with or 
without vomiting, headache, warmth or pain at the injection site, paresthesias, dizziness, and 
itching. Reactions resembling an “allergic” response are very unusual and vary in frequency 
from 0.004% to ¬0.7%. A rash hives, or urticaria are the most frequent of this group, and very 
rarely there may be bronchospasm. Severe, life-threatening anaphylactoid or nonallergic 
anaphylactic reactions are exceedingly rare (0.001% to 0.01%)  
An important sever e reaction to mention is nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF  is a 
debilitating condition whose onset is associated with gadolinium contrast injection. Prim ary seen 
in patients with GFR<[ADDRESS_402210] a 
higher association with NSF and are considered higher risk when administered to patients with 
renal impairment. Incidence ranges from 36.5/100,000 to 4/100,0 00. 
Extravascular extravasation via infiltrated IV can occur. The incidence of extravascular 
extravasation in one series of 28,000 doses was 0.05%. Laboratory studies in animals have 
demonstrated that both gadopentetate dimeglumine and gadoteridol are much less toxic to the 
skin and subcutaneous tissues than are equal volumes of iodinated contrast media. 
Standard risk associated with the appropriate surgical procedure will be discussed with the 
patient prior to operation at the time of operation consent. Minimal to no risk will be accrued by 
[CONTACT_325631]. 
2.3.[ADDRESS_402211] benefit to this patient population will likely not be encountered during this study’s 
duration. Benefits will be seen in future patient populations as the vascuCAPTM imaging 
technology will be better able to identify, categorize, and score problematic vascular beds.  
2.3.3 Risk to Benefit Ratio 
The risk to this patient population is considered minimal, while the potential benefit of 
progressing the vascuCAPTM noninvasive imaging technology could potentially allow for limited 
use of more invasive imaging techniques, such a angiography, in future patients. Accurate 
noninvasive plaque characteristics and risk scoring could also lead to individualized patient 
management based on predicted plaque stability through vascuCAPTM imaging. Future accurate

3.1 Study Objectives 
The vascuCAPTM measurements of structural and functional features of the arterial wall will be 
performed in patients undergoing endarterectomy for the following objectives: 
Primary:  
I. Measure the bias, precision, and reproducibility of each of the functional analytes as 
measured by [CONTACT_325632], and 
assess their linear region and limits of quantitation.  
II. Establish performance characteristics of the structural and  hemodynamic analytes , 
where an objective truth standard is lacking.  
Secondary:  
III. Classify the target lesion according to whether the analytes suggest it is not a plaque, 
or if it is, which of the [ADDRESS_402215] fits the analyte profile.  Assess the accura cy of 
vascuCAPTM’s classification against the histopathology classification.   
3.2 Study Outcome Measures 
Measured results will be compared in a blinded fashion with histology to assess performance of 
vascuCAPTM-Profiling  and build a prediction model in vascuC APTM–Scoring  according to the 
following study endpoints: 
I. Measure the bias, precision, and reproducibility of each of the functional analytes as 
measured by [CONTACT_325632], and 
assess their linear region a nd limits of quantitation:  
a. Plaque lipid core pool presence and volume.  
b. Plaque fibrosis volume, degree, and uniformity.  
c. Plaque inflammation burden, degree, and uniformity.  
d. Intra- plaque hemorrhage burden and confidence.  
e. Plaque vascular leak - volume, degree,  and uniformity.  
f. Calcification – volume, degree, and uniformity.  
II. Establish performance characteristics of the structural and hemodynamic analytes , 
where an objective truth standard is lacking:  
a. Determine the interchangeability of structural measurements of wall thickness, 
remodeling ratio and luminal narrowing and hemodynamic measurements (ESS) 
with an imperfect (subjective) reference standard of manual contouring by 
[CONTACT_87219].  vascuCAPTM will be evaluated under two scenarios: fully -automated 
vascuCAPTM, and a workflow where a reader will have the opportunity to review 
and adjust vascuCAPTM produced results.  
b. Assess the reproducibility under different clinical sites, scanner models, and field 
strengths (dependent variable of interest being the interchangea bility for each 
analyte relative to the imperfect reference standard) and with respect to ranges 
documented in literature according to collected co -variates.  
III. Classify the target lesion according to whether the analytes suggest it is not a plaque, 
or if it is, which of the [ADDRESS_402216] fits the analyte profile.  Assess the accuracy of 
vascuCAPTM’s classification against the histopathology classification.

of a training set; aims I-II will be evaluated with this set.  In the second phase, at least a 
minimum of 35 and as many as 75 surgical patients will be recruited (number to be set based on 
the results of a statistical analysis following the first phase). Data from the second phase will be 
used in the definitive results to be filed in a 510(k) application to the FDA documenting the 
statistical  performance of vascuCAPTM’s ability to measure functional and structural analytes 
according to Aims I and II.  Data collected in the second phase will also be used as additional 
training data for Aim III.   
vascuCAPTM’s performance in measuign functional analytes will be assessed using histology of 
specimens collected during surgery as ground truth.  vascuCAPTM’s performance in measuring 
structural analytes will be facilitated by [CONTACT_325633]. The two 
radiologists will independently perform the manual contouring for all study patients, and one of 
these two radiologists will also perform the vascuCAPTM aided contouring after a sufficient 
wash-out period after the manual contouring and with appropriate blinding to their manual 
results.   
Patients are recruited, enrolled, and analyzed with vascuCAPTM. [ADDRESS_402219] been 
imaged and on which surgery was performed within 30 days of imaging will form the training set.  
An analysis will be performed and revisions to vascuCAPTM will be made, as appropriate.  The 
sample size for the Profiling will be determined at this time; we denote this as N profile. After 
analysis, the product configuration will be locked, and subsequent patient results are blinded.

ELUCID CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY INFORMATION-NOT FOR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION                 [ADDRESS_402221] Jefferson Medical Center, Marrer o will be recruited for the study after informed 
consent has been obtained. All patients will undergo a carotid or femoral artery MRI 
examination within 30 days of the surgical procedure. Patients will not be coerced into enrolling 
within the study. Patients will be reminded of their freedom to abstain from enrollment. Patients 
will be reminded that upon abstaining from enrollment, no objective or subjective change 
will/would occur in their care. 
Current Standard of Care and Deviation Thereof:  
Patients will be recruited, enrolled, and the vascular bed in question analyzed with MRI and the 
vascuCAPTM system. For a patient to be included within the appropriate phases as described 
previously, any vascular operation upon the vascular bed in question must take place within [ADDRESS_402222] of care [ 7]. Carotid and femoral lesion vessel distribution and 
percent stenosis can be accurately assessed with MRI. Thus, preoperative imagining via MRI is 
sufficient to construct an appropriate operative plan for individual patients. The MRI which will 
be required for patients to undergo will not be an addition to their clinical work up had they not 
enrolled in the study. Therefore, no additional risk will be seen by [CONTACT_325634].

 Subjects, meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be contact[CONTACT_325635]-MRI consent screening 
by [CONTACT_325636]. After confirming consent to study protocol, those 
willing to participate will be scheduled to a 1-hour time-slot to appear at the Department 
of Radiology to undergo an MRI. 
 At the appointed time, subjects will be met by a research assistant or physician and will 
be oriented. Consent will be confirmed both for the MR imaging as well as the pathology 
specimen (carotid endarterecto my specimen after surgery in carotid artery patients and 
peripheral arterial specimen in PAD patients) and the MRI safety checklist repeated. 
Subjects will change into hospi[INVESTIGATOR_325611] (provided) and remove any jewelry, watches, 
etc. 
 The subject should be asked if he or she had a permanent coloring technique (i.e., 
tattooing) applied to any part of the body. This includes cosmetic applications such as 
eyeliner, lip-liner, lip coloring, as well as decorative designs. 
 The subject should be informed of the risks associated with the site of the tattoo. 
 The subject should be advised to immediately inform the MRI technologist regarding any 
unusual sensation felt at the site of the tattoo in association with the MR procedure. 
 As a precautionary measure, a cold compress (e.g., ice bag) may be applied to the 
tattoo site during the MR procedure. 
 Women of childbearing potential will be asked to provide a urine sample for a urine 
pregnancy test before each MRI study. If the test is negative, the patient may continue to 
participate. A positive pregnancy test will exclude further participation. 
 Subjects will then be escorted by a research assistant/ physician into the MRI scan room 
and asked to lie on the imaging table. The patient will undergo MRI imaging of the 
specific arterial target, which is to include post-gadolinium contrast enhanced images. 
The total scan duration will be less than 60 minutes. All equipment for monitoring (ECG 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) and imaging is approved for human clinical use.

slice thickness of maximum 4mm, and an acquisition matrix of at least 280×256, and a longitudinal 
coverage of at least 30mm. The MR imaging will be centered on the bifurcation of the symptomatic 
carotid arteries, defined as the arteries responsible for the neurological symptoms.  
 Femoral Artery:  The femoral artery will be scanned employing a standard leg coil placed around the

sections every 2.0 mm throughout the length of the endarterectomy specimen and stained 
(Hematoxylin-Eosin, Masson’s trichrome, Verhoeff van Gieson and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_325614]). The H&E

area of classic cholesterol clefts will also be assessed. Atherosclerotic plaques will be 
categorized into early (types II and III) and advanced (types IV, Va, Vc and VI) plaques 
according to a proposed modified American Heart Association (AHA) classification. Type VI 
plaques were further subdivided into VI-ruptured and VI-eroded to discriminate whether thrombi 
were associated with demarcation of the endothelial layer of the intima or not. Rupture was 
defined as a discontinuity of the endothelium resulting in a contact [CONTACT_325640]. Erosion was identified when the thrombus is attached to an intima that 
lacked endothelium and an underlying myointimal region that is rich in SMC and proteoglycans.

The investigator will be responsible for study oversight, including monitoring safety, ensuring 
that the study is conducted according to the protocol and ensuring data integrity.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325617], and will promptly report 
to the IRB and NHLBI any Unanticipated Problem (UP), protocol deviation, or any other 
significant event that arises during the conduct of the study.   
Safety monitoring for this study will focus on unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants, including unanticipated problems that meet the definition of a serious adverse 
event. 
7.1.1 Unanticipated Problems  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems 
involving risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome 
that meets all of the following criteria: 
 unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved 
research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
subject population being studied; 
 related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there 
is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and 
 suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized. 
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event s  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred) 
 Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

ELUCID CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY INFORMATION-NOT FOR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION                 15 7.2 Reporting Procedures 
Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for unanticipated problems require the creation 
and completion of an unanticipated problem report form.  OHRP recommends that investigators 
include the following information when reporting an adverse event, or any other incident, 
experience, or outcome as an unanticipated problem to the IRB: 
 Appropriate identifying information for the research protocol, such as the title, 
investigator’s name, and the IRB project number; 
 A detailed description of the adverse event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
 An explanation of the basis for determining that the adverse event, incident, experience, 
or outcome represents an unanticipated problem;  
 A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been 
taken or are proposed in response to the unanticipated problem. 
 Addition al information required by [CONTACT_325641] 4.7 of the LSUHSC IRB 
Policies and Procedures Guidebook will also be provided in a timely manner.  
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, unanticipated problems will be reported using 
the following timeline:   
 Unanticipated problems that are serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB and 
to NHLBI within 1 week of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
 Any other unanticipated problem will be reported to the IRB and to NHLBI within 2 weeks 
of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
 All unanticipated problems should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as 
required by [CONTACT_17347]’s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or 
designee), and OHRP within one month of the IRB’s receipt of the report of the problem 
from the investigator. 
All unanticipated problems will be reported to NHLBI’s centralized reporting system via Rho

ELUCID CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY INFORMATION-NOT FOR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION                 [ADDRESS_402237] phase, 75 surgical patients will be recruited as part 
of a training set; aims I-III will be evaluated with this set.  In the second phase, at least 35 
surgical patients will be recruited (possibly more, depending on the results of the first phase). 
Data from the second phase data will be used in the 510(k) application (i.e. Report of the results 
of the performance of the functional and structural analytes) and as additional training data for 
Aim III.   
Two radiologists will be recruited for the study. The two radiologists will independently perform 
the manual contouring for all study patients, and one of these two radiologists will also perform 
the vascuCAPTM aided contouring after a sufficient wash-out period after the manual contouring 
and with appropriate blinding to their manual results.   
8.[ADDRESS_402238] study aim is to estimate the bias and precision of each of the following functional 
analytes, which will be measured for each target lesion by [CONTACT_325642]:  
a. Plaque lipid   
b. Plaque fibrosis  
c. Plaque inflammation 
d. Intra-plaque hemorrhage burden and confidence. 
e. Plaque vascular leak  
f. Calcification 
For each of these functional analytes, three measurements will be evaluated for a total of 18 
measurements per target lesion: volume in mm3, and degree and uniformity both measured on a 
three-point ordinal scale.  The same measurements will be taken via histopathology, where the 
volume of each analyte will be measured using the same units (i.e. mm3); however, degree and 
uniformity are graded subjectively on histopathology by [CONTACT_10063].   
We anticipate that each patient will have at least one target lesion and some patients, especially 
the PAD patients, will have two target lesions, on average.  There will be no replicate 
measurements (i.e. all of the measurements are obtained objectively by [CONTACT_325643]).   
For volume measurements for each analyte for each site (i.e. neck and leg), we will plot the 
value measured by [CONTACT_325644]. the difference between the value measured by 
[CONTACT_325645]. Any analyte not measurable will also 
be indicated on the plot using a different plotting character.  The resulting plot will be inspected 
visually for the following:  
1. Limits of vascuCAPTM’s quantitation;  
2. Associations between the magnitude of the histopathology measurement and bias; and  
3. Associations between the magnitude of the histopathology measurements and 
heteroscedasticity in the vascuCAPTM measurements.

these sites will be pooled; otherwise, separate analyses will be performed.   
A linear model will be fit (for all of the data or for a subset of histopathology values, depending 
on the findings from the plot) where the dependent variable is the vascuCAPTM measurement 
(X) and the independent variable is the histopathology value ( Y). Generalized estimating 
equations (GEEs) (to account for the fact that some patients will have more than one target 
lesion) will be used to estimate the linear function:  ( | )       . An unstructured working 
covariance will be used.  We will construct a 95% CI for the intercept    using a t-statistic as the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_325618].  CIs not containing [ADDRESS_402241] a 95% CI for the 
slope   . CIs not containing 1 indicate proportional bias [ 11].  
The precision of the vascuCAPTM measurements will be estimated by [CONTACT_156970]: 
√ 
   ∑(       ̅)  
    where  ̅ is the sample mean of the differences,  ̅  
 ∑(     ) 
    [1].  
We will construct a 95% CI for the precision using bootstrap methods.   
We will plot the bias profile (plot of bias of measurements for various ranges of histopathology 
values vs. the histopathology value) and precision profile (plot of standard deviation of 
vascuCAPTM measurements from patients with similar histopathology values vs. the 
histopathology value) as visual summaries of vascuCAPTM performance for the bias and 
precision components, respectively [ 12]. 
In addition to reporting these technical performance characteristics of the volume 
measurements, we will also report i) the coverage probability (CP) and ii) a discrimination index 
[11].  The CP is the probability that the absolute difference between the value measured by 
[CONTACT_325646] d 0, i.e.      (|   |   ).  We 
will plot the CP for a range of values for d 0.  The discrimination ability of the measurements, i.e. 
the ability of vascuCAPTM to discriminate between different magnitudes of histopathology 
values, will be measured using the area under the ROC curve for continuous measures [ 13].  
95% CIs for the CP and ROC area will be constructed using methods for clustered binary data 
[14] and clustered ROC data [ 15], respectively.   
The volume measurements are considered the most critical because they will be used to 
construct a score to predict rupture risk.  Thus, we considered the width of 95% confidence 
intervals for the bias and the between-subject variance as a function of sample size (see Tables 
1 and 2).  The following assumptions were made: 1) the volume measurements are normally 
distributed; 2) carotid artery patients contribute one target lesion each, while PAD patients 
contribute two target lesions each; 3) target lesions from the same patient are moderately 
correlated (r=0.5); 4) one-quarter of all patients will be PAD patients; 5) results from femoral and 
carotid target lesions can be pooled; 6) the average volume of an analyte is 25mm3; and 6) the 
precision of the vascuCAPTM measurements is 10-20% of the volume of analyte.   
From Table 4, if the SD was 15% of the mean volume, then we expect to be able to construct a 
95% CI for the bias of total width of 10% with n=35.  If the SD was 20%, then with n=[ADDRESS_402242] a 95% CI of total width of 14%.  Similarly, from Table 5, if the SD was 15% 
of the mean volume, then with n=[ADDRESS_402243] a 95% CI for the 
precision of total length 8%; if the SD was 20%, then we expect to be able to construct a 95% CI 
for the precision of total length 11%.  We plan to recruit 75 patients (55 carotid artery patients 
and 20 PAD patients) in phase one to account for the fact that the estimates of bias and

For degree and uniformity measurements for each analyte for each site (i.e. neck and leg), we 
will tabulate the histopathology value vs. the vascuCAPTM value.  Any analyte not measurable 
will also be indicated in the table. In the distributions in the tables are similar, then the data from 
the two sites will be pooled.  
The coverage probability (CP) will be reported which is the probability that the absolute 
difference between the value measured by [CONTACT_325648] d0, i.e.      (|   |   ).  We will report the CP for values for d0 of 0 and 1.  95% 
CIs for the CP will be constructed using methods for clustered binary data [6].   
For volume, degree, and uniformity of the six functional analytes, we will estimate the 
reproducibility of the measures at different institutions (two sites), and under different scanner 
models and field strengths (1.5 and 3.0) and with respect to ranges documented in the literature 
according to collected patient characteristics. Multiple variable linear and logistic regression 
models will be built, where the dependent variable is the difference between the measured 
functional analyte and the true value, and the independent variables are institution, scanner 
model, field strengths, and patient characteristics.  We will test whether the independent 
variables in the model are predictors of bias using F-tests, and Wald tests, respectively.

The second study aim is to establish performance characteristics of each of the following 
structural analytes, which will be measured for each target lesion by [CONTACT_325649]’ performing manual contouring :  
a. Remodeling ratio 
b. Percent Stenosis  
c. Maximum wall thickness  
This study aim also applies similar analysis to the hemodynamic analyte endothelial shear 
stress since even though the computational method differs, yet it still depends on the location of 
contours  
The vascuCAPTM measurements will be made under two scenarios: vascuCAPTM fully 
automated (fully automated mode) and vascuCAPTM followed by [CONTACT_325650] a radiologist 
(semi-automated mode).  
In the neck and leg, for each structural analyte, we will first visually compare vascuCAPTM’s 
measurements to the median of the two radiologists’ measurements.  We will plot the 
radiologists’ median value vs. the value measured by [CONTACT_325651]. 
Any analyte not measurable will also be indicated on the plot using a different plotting character.  
The resulting plot will be inspected visually for the following:  
1. Limits of vascuCAPTM’s quantitation;  
2. Associations between the magnitude of the analyte and the magnitude of the 
discrepancy between vascuCAPTM and the radiologists’ measurements; and  
3. Associations between the magnitude of the analyte and heteroscedasticity in the 
vascuCAPTM measurements.  
If the plots of neck and leg have similar distributions, then the data from these sites will be 
pooled; otherwise, separate analyses will be performed.  Since the radiologists’ manual 
contouring has both bias and measurement error, rather than assessing agreement, we will 
estimate the interchangeability  of vascuCAPTM’s structural measurements with the manual 
contouring by [CONTACT_87219].  The individual equivalence criterion [ 16, 17] will be estimated as 
follows:  
   ̂ √∑ (      )  
     √∑ (       )  
    
where    is the measurement for the i-th case by [CONTACT_325623],     is the measurement for the i-
th case by [CONTACT_325652], and     is the measurement for the i-th 
case by [CONTACT_325653].  IEC is a measure of the expected 
difference between vascuCAPTM’s measurements and a radiologist’s measurements with 
manual contouring, after adjusting for the expected difference between two radiologists’ 
measurements with manual contouring.  IEC will be estimated for both vascuCAPTM fully-

IEC.   
For each of the structural analytes, we will estimate the reproducibility of the measures for 
different factors: different institutions, different scanner models, different field strengths, and with 
respect to ranges documented in the literature according to collected patient characteristics. We 
will estimate the IEC for these different factors, and we will construct CIs for the difference 
between the IECs using bootstrap simulations.

until sufficient statistical significance for all outputs is demonstrated.   
With the limited sample size for the assessment of the classifier, we will not attempt to model 
the results.  Rather, we will simply report the 9x9 table of AHA types by [CONTACT_325644]. AHA 
types by [CONTACT_325623]’s classifier.  In addition, for each of the AHA types according to 
histopathology, we will report:  
1. the frequency with which vascuCAPTM’s classification agrees with histopathology,  
2. the frequency with which vascuCAPTM’s classification is within an acceptable range (see 
Table 6 ), and  
3. the frequency with which vascuCAPTM’s classification is not within an acceptable range.

1 Introduction  
 
This document  is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in 
accordance with the applicable [LOCATION_002] government regulations and Mayo Clinic research 
policies and procedures.  
 
1.1 Background  
 
Due to immunosenescence related to aging, vaccin ation within the geriatric population is not as 
efficacious as within the general population. Goodwin et al. reported that the influenza vaccine 
had a 17 -53% clinical efficacy in in the elderly while on the other hand displayed 70 -90% 
clinical efficacy in young adults [1]. This is as a result of vaccinations’ inability to produce an 
adequate immune response in older individuals due to age -related changes in both the  
nonspecific (innate) and specific (adaptive) immune response. Weinburger et al. summarizes t he 
changes in vaccine response with age as an increase in the threshold for induction of an antibody 
response to a vaccine. Older individuals often produce insufficient antibody titers required to 
booster critical vaccinations [2]. Henry et al. has shown t hat elderly adults have less de novo 
somatic hypermutations in immunoglobulin variable genes which leads to less adaptability in 
their antibody responses and less potent hemagglutinin epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] [3]. This inadequate antibody 
response can be life threatening,  particularly more so in the aging population with other  
comorbid diseases. Compromises to their ability to resist the influenza virus, the most common 
cause of pneumonia infections, has led to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], lengthened hospi[INVESTIGATOR_722702] 1 0,000 to 14,000 deaths in the [LOCATION_002] during the 2015 -2016 flu season in the 
over 65 -year-old population [4]. 
 
Enhancing the immune response to various stimuli in the geriatric population is imperative due  
to the increase in life  expectancy and the aging population. During 1975 -2015, life  expectancy at 
birth increased from 72.6 to 78.8 years in the U.S. (CDC, National Center for health statistics) 
and data obtained from the social security administration indicates that a man reachi ng age [ADDRESS_987017] attempted to improve vaccine -induced responses in the elderly,  
including: i ncreasing the vaccine antigen dosage, using booster vaccines, changing the route of 
administration (e.g. intradermal), using vector -based vaccines and adjuvants. Entolimod, a novel 
recombinant protein, is a toll -like receptor 5 (TLR5) agonist developed by [CONTACT_722736],  
Inc (CBLI) for reducing the risk of death following exposure to potentially lethal irradiation [5], 
and by [CONTACT_722737], Inc as an enhancer for anti -addiction therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Toll -like receptors 
(TLRs) recognize conserved pathogen asso ciated molecular patterns and play an important role  
in initiating an innate immune response, which in turn is able to lead to the development of an 
adaptive immune response. Entolimod’s engagement of TLR5 has been shown to result in the 
activation of NF -kB, which mobilizes an innate immune response that drives the expression of 
numerous genes, including inhibitors of apoptosis, scavengers of reactive oxygen species, 
modulators of key hematopoietic growth factors including G -CSF and IL -6, and a spectrum of 
protective  or regenerative  cytokines  [5]. Systemic  activation  of TLR5  by [CONTACT_722738]  a

 pharmacological advantage over the activation of other TLRs.  Unlike other TLRs, systemic 
activation of TLR5 by [CONTACT_722739] d ysregulation ‘(i.e., “cytokine 
storm”)’ that can contribute to immunopathology. Rather, entolimod induces tissue -protective 
factors including anti -inflammatory cytokines (IL -10), antimicrobial factors (L -17, 
S100A8/S100A9) and antimicrobial small peptides [5]. 
 
Limitations of current and developi[INVESTIGATOR_722703]. A recently completed study of entolimod alongside the teta nus-diphtheria vaccine (Td) 
with alum (anti -TT and anti -diphtheria) (IND 017372), demonstrated that a single intermuscular 
(IM) injection of entolimod was able to significantly increase levels of anti -tetanus and anti - 
diphtheria antibodies while producing  no significant adverse effects in healthy adults (ages 18 - 
64). Two subjects also reported subjective feelings of increased immunity (e.g decreased  
seasonal allergy symptoms and decreased incidence of upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (URI) and an 
improvement  in their general  well-being.  Data  from  this study  has prompted  further  investigation 
into the effects of entolimod on antibody generation in the geriatric population. Pre -clinical data 
have shown that in male swiss mice, a single week -long treatment with en tolimod is capable of 
having positive long -term effects on their physiological frailty index [7]. 
 
Based on the collective nonclinical and clinical data with entolimod, it is hypothesized that its 
administration in combination with the influenza vaccine wi ll be safe within the geriatric 
population and result in increased circulating influenza -specific antibodies.  
 
Coronavirus  Disease  2019  (COVID -19) Background  
COVID -19 infection -related mortality has a strong dependence on age.  The risk of death in the 
elderly is so high that COVID19 -induced illness can potentially be defined as aging -related 
disease. Hence, therapeutic development of  COVID19 prophylaxis should focus primarily on the 
elderly population. High vulnerability to COVID19 reflects inefficient immune responses of 
older  people to viral infections, a  well-recognized phenomenon named immune senescence [8]. In 
fact, older people have impaired immunization c apabilities requiring the use of increased doses  
of vaccines; furthermore, they commonly have activated latent viruses that stay suppressed in 
younger people, such as hepatitis B (HBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV). Today, there are no 
approved drugs for revert ing immune senescence and the high vulnerability of older people to 
viral infections, together with their reduced capability to be protected by [CONTACT_33853], remain 
unmet medical needs.  
 
Broad studies of entolimod’s pharmacological properties and mechanism of action uncovered its 
efficacy as an antiaging drug, including its ability to significantly improve responses of elderly 
mice with immune senescence to different vaccines. These data, together with published results 
on an antiviral effect of TLR5 stimula tion obtained by [CONTACT_2312], suggest that treatment of elderly 
humans who are at risk of COVID19 infection with entolimod can reduce their risk of infection, 
the severity of illness and even death by [CONTACT_722740].  We intend to generate preliminary data on the use of 
entolimod,  in treating people who are at high -risk of COVID 19 infection and development of 
severe illness.

 1.2 Investigational  Agent  
 
Entolimod is provided as a sterile, c lear, colorless or slightly yellow liquid for IM injection. The 
drug is supplied in 2 mL Type 1 DIN 2R glass vials secured with V35 bromo -butyl injection 
stoppers and sealed with aluminum white flip off caps. Each single -use vial is prefilled with 50 
µg of  entolimod in 0.5 mL (concentration of 10 µg/100 µL). Entolimod diluent comprises  
sodium chloride (8.0 mg/mL), potassium chloride (0.2 mg/mL), disodium hydrogen phosphate 
dehydrate (1.44 mg/mL), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (0.24 mg/mL), polysorbate 80  
(Tween 80) (0.001 mL/mL), and water for injection (to 1 mL), with a pH of 7.4 ± 0.5. The  
diluent is supplied in 50 mL vials with extractable volume 40 mL.  
 
A matching placebo is also provided as a sterile, clear, colorless to slightly yellow liquid for IM 
injection  in prefilled  vials  that are identical  in appearance  to the vials  containing  active  drug.  The 
placebo comprises of the same liquid used as a diluent for the active drug formulation.  
 
1.3 Preclinical  Data  
 
1.3.1 Entolimod’s  Mechanism  of Action  
The target of entolimod action, the TLR5 receptor, is found on the surface of both structural and 
immunological cell types, including multiple types of epi[INVESTIGATOR_24603], intestinal crypt cells, intestinal 
endothelial cells on the basolateral surface of the intest inal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], hepatocytes,  
mesenchymal stem cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, stromal elements of some 
hematopoietic organs, intestinal cluster of differentiation (CD) 11c+ dendritic cells and 
regulatory T -cells (T reg). 
 
Binding of entolimod to  TLR5 specifically activates NF -қB-dependent pathways [6,7]. This 
results in increased production of multiple factors, including cytokines (in particular, G -CSF and 
IL-6) [3], antioxidants and antiapoptotic factors, and promotes multiorgan tissue protectio n and 
regeneration through multiple mechanisms as shown in Figure 1 [5,6,8 –13]. Entolimod shows a 
similar half maximal effective concentration (EC50) for TLR5 -mediated activity as its parent, 
flagellin (FliC), when assessed by a reporter system comprised o f an NF -қB-dependent bacterial 
ß-galactosidase gene (LacZ) reporter [6].

1.3.2 Entolimod’s  Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics of entolimod have been evaluated in mice and in non -human primates 
(NHP). Because entolimod is a small protein (35 kD), is composed of natural amino acids and 
does not contain any nonbiodegradable moieties, degradation of the  drug is expected  to occur  via 
ubiquitous proteases present in serum and via routes common to endogenous plasma proteins.  
For this reason, metabolism studies have not been performed. Nonclinical drug -drug interaction 
studies have not been performed.  
 
To evaluate the  PK of entolimod in mice, animals were injected IM with 1, 4, 12, 40, or 160 
μg/kg entolimod. Serum samples were collected at 0 (baseline, pre -injection), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 
24 hours relative to entolimod injection. There were 36 mice in each dose group,  providing 6 
animals for serum collection at each time point. Due to assay sensitivity limitations, PK profiles 
for the 1 μg/kg and 4 μg/kg dose levels could not be determined. At doses of 12, 40 and 160 
μg/kg,  the time at which  the maximum  plasma  concentr ation  (Cmax) was observed  (Tmax) was 
~0.[ADDRESS_987018] -injection. Both C max and AUC increased in a dose -dependent fashion. After the 
Cmax was reached,  serum  concentrations  of entolimod  declined  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_722704]

 In healthy, research -naive, nonirradiated NHP given a single IM injection of 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 6.6,  
10, 40, or 120 μg/kg entolimod, the drug was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_24584] (median T max of ~1 hour) a nd 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_51678] (mean T 1/2 values ranging from 1.13 to 3.15 hours). Mean values for AUC 0-t, 
AUC 0-24, and AUC 0-∞ following doses of  0.3 to 120 μg/kg ranged from 0.139 to 273 ng•hour/mL,  
0.171 to 272 ng•hour/mL, and 0.199 to 273 ng•hour/mL, respectivel y, indicating that the  
majority of entolimod exposure occurs within [ADDRESS_987020] -dose. Entolimod exposure showed 
no evidence of saturation over the dos range studied. An analysis of the dose -exposure 
relationship using dose -normalized C max and AUC over th e entire 400 -fold dose range studied 
indicates that both peak exposure (C max) and total exposures (AUC) were consistent with dose 
proportionality. Mean apparent clearance (Cl/F) values ranged from 536 to 1700 mL/hour/kg, 
which is ~20% to 65% of the liver b lood flow (2616 mL/hour/kg) for a 5 kg monkey. Mean 
apparent volume of distribution values (V d/F) ranged from 2090 to 3100 mL/kg, which is ~3 to 
4.5-fold greater than total body water (693 mL/kg) for a monkey weighing [ADDRESS_987021] moderate 
clearance and substantial distribution of entolimod into tissues. However, if distribution of this 
molecular -weight polypeptide molecule (MW ~35 kD) is limited to approximately the se rum 
space (nominal serum volume for monkey = 44.8 mL/kg [14]), the bioavailability of entolimod 
would be approximately 1.3% -3.5%, and the molecule would have a clearance of approximately 
75 mL/hour/kg after correcting for the bioavailable fraction.  
 
There were no apparent sex differences in entolimod pharmacokinetic parameters in either mice 
or NHP.  
 
1.3.3 Entolimod’s  Toxicology  
A study was conducted in CD -1 (ICR) BR mice to evaluate potential toxic effects of entolimod 
after a single subcutaneous (SC) injection at doses of 0, 0.02, 0.06, 0.2, 0.6, 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg. 
Dosing  formulation  assays  revealed  that the actual  doses  delivered  were  0.067,  0.303,  1.22,  and 
4.71 mg/kg for the [ADDRESS_987022] entolimod dose groups. Each dose group included 10 males and 10 
females.  
 
Overall, there were no abnormal clinical signs observed, and no abnormalities in food 
consumption or body weight gain. Twenty -four hours after dosing, to tal white blood cell (WBC) 
counts were decreased in both males and females at entolimod doses ≥0.303 mg/kg. Animals 
given entolimod doses ≥0.067 mg/kg displayed decreases in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and total biliru bin, and an increase in globulin 24 hours after 
dosing. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was increased 24 hours after dosing in females 
given  4.71 mg/kg  of entolimod.  Slight  decreases  in serum  triglycerides  were  noted  at all dosages. 
At 2 weeks after  dosing, serum sodium was decreased in mice given entolimod doses ≥0.067 
mg/kg; however, the means remained greater than or equal to the mean ±[ADDRESS_987023] deviations 
reported for CD -1 mice. Serum calcium was also decreased 2 weeks after dosing at entolimod 
doses ≥1.22 mg/kg.  
 
There were no abnormal findings at necropsy, no effects on organ weights, and no 
histopathological changes indicative of entolimod toxicity. Overall, the only change attributed to 
entolimod  toxicity  in this study  was the increase  in AST  at the highest  dosage;  no other  clinical  
Entolimod  (CBLB502)  Version  3.[ADDRESS_987024] level (NOAEL) in this study was reported as 1.22 mg/kg.  
 
Another study was conducted in rhesus monkeys to evaluate potential toxic effects of entolimod 
after a single  IM injection  at doses  of 0, 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 μg/kg.  Formulation  assays  revealed  
the actual administered doses to be  0, 0, 0, 2.2, 13.2, and 62.5 μg/kg. Each dose  group  included [ADDRESS_987025] dose group, no entolimod - 
related adverse clinical reactions were observed and there were no entolimod effects on body 
weight or temperature. Food consumption remained unchanged across all groups. 
Electrocardiograms (ECGs)  and ophthalmology  evaluations revealed  only incidental,  non-related 
findings.  
 
Overall, there were no significant test article -related alterations in any of the parameters of the 
performed clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation and urinalysis evaluations. Increases in 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and decreases in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) were 
observed [ADDRESS_987026] -dose at entolimod doses ≥10  μg/kg (2.2 μg/kg actual). Some of the 
leucocyte changes were still evident [ADDRESS_987027] -dose at entolimod doses ≥10 μg/kg (2.2 μg/kg actual). Activated 
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)  was increased [ADDRESS_987028] -dose in males at 10 μg/kg (2.2 
μg/kg actual) and 30 μg/kg (13.2 μg/kg actual), but not at 100 μg/kg (62.5 μg/kg actual). There 
were no abnormalities in urinalysis.  
 
There were no abnormal findings at necropsy, no effects on org an weights, and no 
histopathological changes indicative of entolimod toxicity. The single occurrence of emesis on 
the day of dosing in some but not all high dose males was not considered to be an adverse event 
(AE).  The observed  changes  in leukocyte  counts  were  expected  from  the known  pharmacological 
action of the drug (cytokine induction) and were not considered adverse. The increases in aPPT 
were not considered to be entolimod -related due to the lack of a dose response. Therefore, the 
NOAEL in this study was reported as the highest do se administered 100 μg/kg (62.5 μg/kg 
actual).  
 
1.3.4 Immunosenescence  and Entolimod  
Aging  of mammals  is associated  with accumulation  of DNA  damage  in somatic  cells,  an increase 
in chronic systemic inflammation and reduced effectiveness of the immune system in clearing 
damaged cells. To a large extent, aging is the pathological manifestation of poisoning of the 
organism by [CONTACT_722741] [15]. Ther efore, a study was performed to 
determine whether the immunomodulatory activity of entolimod could have anti -aging effects.  
Three experiments were performed in NIH Swiss mice. First, groups of male and female mice 
were treated with 5 daily injections of en tolimod (or PBS as a control) at 18 (“young”), 55 
(“middle -aged”) or 112 (“old”) weeks of age. Animal survival was monitored to determine 
effects of treatment on longevity (life span) and Physiological Frailty Index, a quantitative 
composite  of multiple  physiological  parameters,  was measured  at different  times  post-treatment

 to determine effects of treatment on health status (health span/biological age). The results  
showed that entolimod did not significantly increase mouse life span but did h ave beneficial 
effects on health span (reduced PFI) in male NIH Swiss mice specifically when administered at 
“middle -age”. A second experiment then tested the immunomodulatory effects of entolimod 
delivered together with a vaccine (Prevnar13 pneumococcal v accine) to young, middle -aged or 
old male NIH Swiss mice. Entolimod was found to enhance the efficacy of vaccination (boosted 
antigen -specific antibody production), but only in the middle -aged group of mice. In addition, 
flow cytometric analysis of the T c ell repertoire in the spleens of middle -aged mice showed that, 
unlike in other age groups, co -administration of entolimod along with the vaccine resulted in a 
dramatic  reduction  in activated  T cells,  thus suggesting  that entolimod  enhances  their recruitment 
to peripheral sites of infection. The concordance of these results supports the hypothesis that the 
immunostimulatory  activity  of entolimod  can have  anti-aging  effects.  The third  experiment  in the 
study confirmed that entolimod improved vaccina tion efficacy in middle -aged male mice using 
an independent model (Tdap vaccine) and demonstrated that such effects were not dependent on 
the route of entolimod administration and were not improved by [CONTACT_722742].  
 
Overall, this study demonst rated a stimulatory effect of entolimod on vaccination efficiency in a 
mouse model of age -related immunosenescence. This effect did not depend on the site of 
entolimod administration (indicating that it acts via a systemic mechanism) or on entolimod 
being part of the vaccine formulation. In addition, in “middle -aged” male mice, entolimod had a 
long-lasting positive effect on general health status that correlated with is immunomodulatory 
activity. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlyi ng the age - and gender - 
dependence of these effects. It should be noted that these effects were observed with doses of 
entolimod that are lower than its optimal efficacious dose in acute radiation syndrome.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_987029] recently, entolimod has been 
administered to 40 healthy subjects as an anti -addicti on vaccine adjuvant. The safety data  
derived from studies in cancer patients provide safety information for older patients and those 
with comorbidities.  
 
1.4.2 Clinical  Studies  in Healthy  Subjects  and Patients  with  Cancer  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase  [ADDRESS_987030] -in-human, sequential dose -escalation, single -dose study that  
evaluated  entolimod  doses  of 2 (N=6),  6 (N=6),  12 (N=6),  24 (N=6),  30 (N=12),  35 (N=6), 
40 (N=5), and 50 µg (N=3). Study  HU-9001 was a subsequent randomized stu dy of 4 groups of 
subjects that were administered one of the following dosing regimens: a single IM injection of  
25 µg of entolimod  (N=25),  two IM injections  of 30 µg  of entolimod  administered  72 hours  apart 
(N=24), a single IM injection of 35 µg of entoli mod (N=25), or a single IM injection of 35 μg of  
Entolimod  (CBLB502)  Version  3.0

 entolimod preceded by 400 mg of orally administered ibuprofen (N=26). Dose selection for 
Study HU -[ADDRESS_987031] population of Studies HU -7014/HU -9001, subjects ranged in  
age from 18 to 55  years. Subjects were primarily Caucasian men of Hispanic ethnicity; however, 
women  and African  Americans  were also represented.  Body  weights  ranged  from  46.0 to 
109.5  kg but with few subjects at the extremes of the weight range. Demographic characteristics 
were reasonably well balanced across the dose groups. However, the 50 µg dose group was 
composed completely  of women. Mean body weights in the lower and middle dose groups were 
between ~74 kg and ~[ADDRESS_987032], mean body weights were lower in the 40 µg and 50 µg 
dose groups (66 kg and 58 kg, respectively), resulting in high body -weight -adjusted doses 
(ranging to 1.09 g/kg) in these subjects.  
Pharmacokinetic data revealed a lag in the appearance of entolimod in the serum after IM 
injection, which resulted in a mean time of maximum concentration (T max) of [ADDRESS_987033] - 
dose. Increases in maximum concen tration (C max) and AUC values with dose were somewhat 
greater than dose -proportional. Clearance from the circulatory system was rapid with the mean 
terminal elimination half -live (t ½) being ~3  hours. The pharmacokinetic profile of entolimod was 
not affecte d by [CONTACT_722743] -inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen.  
Administration of entolimod resulted in rapid and  substantial dose -related increases in plasma 
levels of G -CSF and IL -6. IL -8 and IL -10 were also elevated. Plasma cytokine levels typi[INVESTIGATOR_722705] 4  hours and decreased to pre -dose levels by 7 to 12 hours after injection. Increases in 
absolute neutrophi l count (ANC) were observed in all dose groups after entolimod 
administration, peaking by ~7 to 24  hours and returning to pre -dose levels by 5  days (120 hours) 
after injection. Administration of ibuprofen prior to entolimod dosing appeared to augment the 
entolimod -mediated increases in plasma concentrations of cytokines (e.g., G -CSF, IL -6, IL -8, 
IL-10) relative to administration of entolimod alone.  
Entolimod administration was associated with unpleasant, but transient and generally mild, 
adverse effects, wh ich were primarily comprised of elements of a flu -like syndrome (malaise, 
fatigue, chills, fever, myalgias, and nausea) that are consistent with TLR agonism. As  
specifically evaluated in the development program, the constitutional components of the flu -like 
syndrome could be lessened either preemptively or reactively with ibuprofen while still 
preserving the desired pharmacodynamic activity of entolimod.  
Transient increases in white blood cell count (WBC) and ANC and decreases in platelet count 
and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) were seen in response to entolimod administration. These 
changes were considered to be components of the expected mechanism -related activity of 
entolimod, had no clinical sequelae, and were not considered adverse effects. Administration of 
entolimod was also associated with transient increases in serum levels of alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), w ithout changes in serum levels 
of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or bilirubin. Such hepatic transaminase changes are considered 
consistent with the mechanism of action of entolimod and may result from recruitment of large 
numbers  of natural  killer  cells to sites of TLR5  activation  such as the liver [16]. The data from

 Study  HU-9001 were modeled using the DiliSym ™ proprietary software that is currently the 
focus of a collaboration between the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and The  
Hamner I nstitutes for Health Sciences  [17]. This analysis indicated that subjects given entolimod 
had a pattern of minor hepatocyte loss and recovery similar to that observed in healthy subjects 
receiving commercially available heparin drug products (e.g., heparin , dalteparin, enoxaparin, 
adomiparin). Other laboratory abnormalities associated with entolimod administration were 
asymptomatic hyperglycemia and transient hypophosphatemia. All of these laboratory 
abnormalities were perceived to be transient and self -limiting, have no serious clinical 
implications, and require no monitoring or intervention. Such effects were seen following 
administration  of IL -6 in patients with cancer [18] and, thus, are likely secondary consequences of 
entolimod -mediated induction of th is cytokine.  
Transient  decreases  in blood  pressure  and increases  in pulse  rate observed  in Studies 
HU-7014/HU -9001 were also likely the result of entolimod -mediated IL -6 induction  [19]. Most of 
the changes in blood pressure were within the normal range and were imperceptible to subjects, 
although a minority of study participants did describe diz ziness and orthostatic syncope occurred 
in [ADDRESS_987034]. For those subjects that developed blood pressures below the normal range, the time 
to return to normal averaged ~6 hours, indicating that hypotension following entolimod 
administration is typi[INVESTIGATOR_722706]. No elevations of serum creatinine or blood urea 
nitrogen  (BUN)  consistent  with renal  hypoperfusion  were  evident  in any subject.  Observations  of 
hypotension  were  managed  at the investigator’s  discretion  in both Studies  HU-7014  and 
HU-9001. Con sequently, such changes were addressed inconsistently, with neither the minimum 
absolute blood pressure nor the maximum decrease from baseline necessarily prompting an 
investigator decision to administer intravenous (IV) fluids. Only 13 of 150 subjects (8. 7%) 
received IV fluids and only [ADDRESS_987035] (0.6%) was given IV dopamine; the rationale for 
administering a pressor agent to this subject was unclear since they only had transient 
asymptomatic Grade 2 hypotension and were discharged normotensive the followin g day.  
Electrocardiograms  (ECGs)  were  evaluated  in both clinical  trials  in healthy  subjects  at screening, 
pre-dose, at [ADDRESS_987036] -dose on Day 1, and at follow -up on Day 4 or 5 following 
entolimod administration. No changes in PR or RR intervals were observed and no other 
abnormalities were apparent. Changes in corrected cardiac QT interval (QTc) ≥60 msec or 
evidence of prolonged QTc (>501 msec) occurred in only [ADDRESS_987037] urbances of 
cardiac conduction or rhythm.  
Overall, the results of these clinical studies in healthy human subjects indicated variable but 
dose-dependent increases in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, but no clear 
dose-related pattern of adver se effects on safety parameters. Nevertheless, it remains possible  
that dose -dependent changes in safety parameters (i.e., symptomatic events, laboratory 
abnormalities, and hemodynamic measures) could have been obscured by [CONTACT_722744].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase  1 Study  in Patients  with  Cancer  
Study I -196111 was a Phase I multi -center, dose -ranging study designed to determine the safety 
and tolerability  of entolimod  in patients  with advanced  cancers  [20,21]. Entolimod  doses  of 
5 (N=4),  10 (N=3),  15 (N=3),  20 (N=4),  30 (N=12),  and 40 (N=7)  µg were  evaluated  with IM

 injections given once daily for 5 days (Days 1 -5) on a dose -per-subject basis through the 20 µg 
dose level and with IM injections once per day on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 at the 30 µg and 40 µg 
dose levels.  
Subjects ranged in age from 27 to 82 years and were p rimarily male and Caucasian. Body 
weights ranged from 40.7 kg to 117.3 kg. Subjects had a variety of cancer types; colorectal 
cancer and lung cancer were most commonly represented.  
The safety results of Study I -196111 confirm that the commonly occurring AE s following from 
entolimod administration are reflective of a “flu -like” syndrome, including chills, pyrexia, 
nausea, and vomiting. Expected transient treatment -emergent increases in leukocytes and 
neutrophils and decreases in lymphocytes and platelets, as  well as treatment -emergent increases 
in serum ALT and AST levels, increases in serum glucose, and decreases in serum phosphate 
were observed. Expected transient, generally asymptomatic hypotension and tachycardia were 
also observed after entolimod injecti on; blood pressure recovered to pretreatment values with  
rest and fluids. When increases in QTcB occurred, they were almost universally low grade and 
did not show dose dependency; collectively, the ECG data do not suggest that entolimod causes 
clinically r elevant disturbances of cardiac rhythm or conduction. Overall, the safety profile of 
entolimod in subjects with advanced cancers was found to be consistent with that observed in 
healthy subjects.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase  2 Study  in Patients  with  Cancer  
Study BL612 -CBLB502 was a Phase 2, multi -center, randomized, placebo -controlled, single - 
blind study designed to assess the safety, pharmacodynamic effects, and preliminary efficacy of 
neoadjuvant therapy with entolimod in subjects with colorectal cancer w ho had never received 
antitumor treatment and were scheduled for surgical resection of the primary tumor. Entolimod 
doses of 0.35 μg/kg or 0.45 μg/kg (not to exceed 30 μg or 40 μg per injection, respectively) or 
placebo was administered as either a single IM injection or as two IM injections separated by 3 
(±1) days, with the last injection administered 4 (± 2) days before surgical resection of the 
primary tumor. Absolute entolimod doses ranged from 18 to 40 μg. Subjects were given 
premedication  of 400 mg ibuprofen orally  30 (±  5) minutes  before  each injection  of study  drug to 
mitigate the flu -like syndrome found to be associated with administration of entolimod in earlier 
clinical studies.  
 
A total of 40 subjects were enrolled and randomized in a 3:1 ratio of entolimod (30 subjects) to 
placebo (10 subjects). Thirty -eight subjects received the planned number of injections of 
entolimod or placebo; 2 of the 30 entolimod -treated subjects who were assigned to receive 2 
injections of 0.45 μg/kg entolimod did not r eceive the second of the 2 planned doses due to the 
occurrence of SAEs (one subject 69 y/female [ADDRESS_987038]  78 y/male  33 μg entolimod - myocardial  infraction)  attributed 
to a history of ischemic heart disease. Subjects ranged in age from 33 to 84 years and were 45% 
male and 55% female and primarily Caucasian. Body weights ranged from 43.[ADDRESS_987039] subjects had Stage II or Stage III colorectal cancer.  
 
Both entolimod dose levels were well tolerated in this population. The commonly occurring AEs 
were reflective of the entolimod -associated “flu -like” syndrome, including chills, fever, 
headache,  and nausea.  Laboratory -related  AE reports  showed  the expecte d pharmacologic  effects 
of entolimod,  including  decreases  in lymphocytes,  increases  in liver transaminases,  an increase

 in serum glucose, and a decrease in serum phosphate. Predicted findings of transient, generally 
asymptomatic hypotension a nd tachycardia were also observed after entolimod injection; blood 
pressure recovered to pretreatment values with rest and fluids. Predicted increases in plasma 
cytokines (G -CSF, IL -6, IL -8, IL -10) and increases in circulating neutrophils and decreases in 
circulating lymphocytes (including B cells, T -cell subsets, and NK cells) were observed in the 
entolimod -treated subjects. Overall, the safety and pharmacodynamic profiles of entolimod in 
subjects with colorectal cancer in this study were consistent with t hose observed in healthy 
subjects and in previous studies in subjects with advanced cancer.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Entolimod  in Combination  with  Vaccine  
The Kadvax Technology study was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1 μg of 
entolimod receiving a commercial tet anus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine in healthy human subjects. 
The study enrolled 40 male volunteers (16 Caucasian, 24 non -Caucasian) between the ages of 18 
and 40 years old (mean age = 28 years). Fifteen volunteers were enrolled in the control group  
and given co mmercial Td vaccine alone while 25 volunteers received the Td vaccine in 
combination with 1 μg of entolimod. Tetanus - and diptheria -specific antibody titers were to 
determine if the addition of entolimod increased the vaccine response.  
 
Mean  baseline  level s of tetanus  toxoid  (TT) -specific  antibodies  were  relatively  high in this study 
(2.95 IU/mL), and as a result, no subjects in the control (Td alone) or test (Td+entolimod) group 
had TT antibody  responses  above 6 IU/mL.  Therefore,  only subjects  with pre-treatment -antibody 
titers below 3 IU/mL were included for data analysis (9 Td  alone and 11 Td+entolimod). Eighty - 
two percent of the subjects that received entolimod with the Td vaccine showed a 2 -fold or  
higher  increase  in their TT antibody  titers,  while  only 33% of the control  group  showed  this level 
of increase (chi sq = 4.3; p = <0.03). Two of the entolimod test subjects showed particularly 
strong increases in antibody titers (10 - and 15 -fold above baseline). A negative correlation was 
observed between baseline antibody titer and the change in antibody titer over [ADDRESS_987040] -vaccination change in titer was stronger 
in the Td+entolimod group than in the control group (r = -0.73 vs. -0.36). The negative 
correlation was statistically significant in the Td+entolimod test grou p with a p -value of <0.003. 
Analysis of anti -diphtheria antibody titers showed a greater increase in anti -diphtheria antibody 
titers  for all 25 Td+entolimod  test subjects  versus  the 15 Td alone  control  subjects  (averaging  1.1 
IU/mL vs. 0.9 IU/mL, respectiv ely; p = <0.02).  The negative correlation between baseline 
antibody titer and the change in anti -diphtheria antibody titer was also significantly stronger for 
the Td+entolimod group than for the control group (r = -0.91 vs -0.52, respectively).  
 
During this 6 -week clinical trial, there were no treatment -related adverse events reported. Thus, 
IM injection of 1 μg of entolimod together with Td vaccine was found to be safe and to 
significantly increase the Td vaccine response.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Entolimod  Safety  in Elderly  Subjects  (≥65  years  old) 
Entolimod -specific treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) data for 25 geriatric (≥65 years 
old) subjects was extracted from the studies performed in patients with advanced solid tumors 
(Study I -196111; [ADDRESS_987041] s) and in patients with colorectal cancer prior to primary 
tumor resection (Study BL612 -CBLB502; 11 geriatric subjects).

 The geriatric subjects ranged in age from 65 to 84 years, with thirteen subjects between 65 and  
70 years, nine subjects b etween 71 and 80 years and three subjects between 81 and 84 years. 
There  were  8 females  and 17 males  with screening  body  weights  ranging  from  47.2 kg to 107 kg. 
Sixteen (64%)  of these  subjects had colorectal cancer, while  lung cancer  (n=4),  melanoma  (n=2),  
anal cancer (n=2) and urothelial cancer (n=1) were also represented. For analysis, subjects were 
stratified  into 3 groups  based  on the administered  entolimod  dose per kg of body  weight:  (i) 
<0.25  mg/kg,  (ii) 0.25 mg/kg  to 0.40 mg/kg,  and (iii) >0.40  mg/kg  with mean  body  weights  of 
77.7 kg, 79.1 kg, and 70.8 kg, respectively.  
 
All subjects experienced a TEAE, but there was little evidence of a dose response when 
considering the total frequencies of any given type of event. Altogether, 175 TEAEs were 
reported among the 25 (100%) geriatric subjects. There did not appear to be a dose trend within 
any of the system organ classes (SOC) including general disorders, administrative site  
conditions, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], thoracic and mediastinal disorders. A majority  (147) of the TEAEs 
were mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) in intensity. Grade 3 TEAEs were largely laboratory 
abnormalities, except for single instances of cardiovascular events, including hypotension, 
hypertension and extrasystoles. The frequency of T EAEs of Grade ≥3 was nonexistent in the 
group receiving <0.25 mg/kg entolimod (<19.4 mg based on 77.7kg group mean body weight) 
but more prevalent in the group receiving >0.25mg/kg of entolimod (56%). Only 3/25 (12%) 
subjects ≥65 years experienced a Grade 4 AE ([ADDRESS_987042] with both lymphocytopenia and neutrophilia). These subjects 
received a substantially higher entolimod dose (between 0.35 mg/kg and 0.45 mg/kg) than what 
is proposed for t he current study.  
 
No deaths occurred within this age group. Overall, within the limits of confidence imposed by  
[CONTACT_722745], there appear to be no differences in the safety profiles 
of people ≥65 years of age versus younger adult study subjects.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Entolimod  and Subjects  with  TLR5  Mutation  
A mutation has been identified in the TLR5 gene in which a cytosine -to-thymidine transition at 
base pair 1174 changes an arginine at amino acid 392 to a stop codon (TLR5 392stop ) [22,23]. The 
TLR5 392 stop mutation is reported to occur in approximately 10% of humans in a heterozygous 
form and in 0.5% of the population in a homozygous form. The completed entolimod clinical 
trials described above included six subjects with TLR5 392 sto p mutations: [ADDRESS_987043] that it will not be useful to  
screen patients for the  presence of mutations in TLR5 prior to administration of entolimod. 
However, retrospective analysis of TLR5 functional status will prove useful for analysis in being 
able to definitively exclude non -responsive mutated TLR5 individuals.

 1.5 Dose  Rationale  
 
Based on pre -clinical and clinical studies described above (sections 1.3 and 1.4), we hypothesize 
that a single IM injection of entolimod may significantly increase levels of anti -influenza 
antibodies, promote increased immunity, and delay or alleviate aspects of frailty. Risk is reduced 
by [CONTACT_722746] 5 - to 50 -fold less than those which are likely to cause adverse events, such 
as hypotension. The route of administration provides local delivery to the site of vaccination 
where the ini tial immune response to influenza antigens will occur.  
 
1.6 Risks  and Benefits  
 
Entolimod used at doses similar to those to be used in this study has not previously been 
associated with adverse reactions. Based on the known safety profile of entolimod used at doses  
5 to 50 times those proposed in this study, the following potential risks may be associated with 
the investigational drug: (1) flu -like symptoms, (2) decreases in blood pressure, (3) increases in 
heart rate, (4) hepatic transaminase elevations, (5) h yperglycemia, and (6) hypophosphatemia.  
All potential risks, if realized, are expected to be transient. Since entolimod will be given only 
once, the likelihood of long -term consequences is expected to be very low. Potential benefits 
include: (1) increasing  influenza vaccine efficacy in an older population prone to poor vaccine 
responses, and (2) knowledge that might reasonably be expected from the study results (e.g., 
predicting early vaccine responses, better understanding of immunosenescence, and associat ions 
of vaccine responses with frailty). Therefore, the risks of using this drug are likely minimal 
compared to the anticipated benefits and the knowledge that may be gained from these clinical 
investigations.  
 
1.6.1 Definition  of DLT  
 
Reference should be made t o the Guidance for Industry Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy  
Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials for grading the 
severity of AEs and laboratory abnormalities where applicable. Based on the known safety 
profile o f entolimod, flu -like symptoms are expected. Decreases in blood pressure, increases in 
heart rate, hepatic transaminase elevations, hyperglycemia, and hypophosphatemia are expected. 
DLT will be defined based on the sound clinical judgement of the investiga tor. DLTs will be 
considered adverse events and their time and grade severity will be recorded.  
 
These risks and benefits are outlined in the Informed Consent Form and listed in the  
Investigators Brochure.  
 
2 Study  Objectives  
 
Primary  Objective  
 
• To evaluate the effect of increasing dose of entolimod on enhancement of the influenza  
vaccine immunogenicity in the geriatric population (  65 years old).  
Entolimod  (CBLB502)  Version  3.0 
18JUN2020

R. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_566877],  M.D.,  Ph.D.  CONFIDENTIAL   
 • To characterize the safety profile of entolimod within the geriatric population (≥65 y ears 
old) vaccinated against influenza.  
 
Secondary  Objectives  
 
• To evaluate  the pharmacodynamic  effects  of entolimod  on immunological  status,  markers 
of senescence, viscoelasticity of tissue at the injection site, frailty indices and quality of 
life (QoL).  
 
Exploratory  Objectives  
• To determine  levels  of anti-COVID -19 serum -circulating  antibodies  in a population  of 
confirmed  COVID -19 cases  
 
• To determine the rate of the following occurrence in patients that become COVID -19 
positive: (i) disease progression requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; (ii) acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086] (ARDS); (iii) and 30 -day mortality following study drug administration.  
 
3 Study  Design  
 
This clinical trial is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -escalated, single - 
administration study evaluating the immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, and safety of  
entolimod within the geriatric population (≥65 years  old) vaccinated against influenza. After 
providing a written informed consent, subjects will undergo screening medical history, physical 
examination, vital signs, laboratory, and electrocardiogram (ECG) assessments within 28 days 
prior to study drug admin istration and influenza vaccination (see figure 2 below).  
 
Eligible subjects will be seen at the clinical trial research unit (CTRU) to receive the influenza 
vaccination (Fluzone, high -dose split virion influenza virus vaccine, [COMPANY_011] Pasteur) and a single  
IM injection of the study drug (entolimod or placebo). For safety assessment, initially 8 patients 
were to be enrolled in arm 1 (1ug) and accrual temporarily halted until the DSMB had assessed 
early adverse events. Due to the late seasonal start only four  patients were successfully accrued

3.6 Exploratory  Endpoints  
 
Sub-hertz  Analysis  of ViscoElasticity  (SAVE)  in muscle  tissue  in response  to local  immunological  
reactions due to influenza vaccination  
 
SAVE is a non -invasive imaging technique used to measure viscoelastic characteristics of tissue. 
This technique enables imaging biphasic characteristics of tissue which are related to both extra - 
cellular matrix changes as wells as disruption in the inters titial fluid mobility due to structural 
changes. A clinical study of this method in breast tumors has shown to provide effective 
separation of the benign from malignant breast lesions in patients [25]. 
 
In this study, SAVE  will be used for quantification  of muscle  reaction  in response  to vaccination, 
which  usually  occurs  within  few hours  of injection.  Vaccine  potency  and efficiency  are estimated 
by [CONTACT_488] -specific antibody titers and T -cell responses generated weeks after vaccination. 
Skeletal muscle cont ains few immune cells, but tissue resident and/or infiltrating immune cells 
encounter vaccine antigens for the first time at the site of administration. Thus, the magnitude of 
local innate immune responses starting at the vaccine delivery site (local infla mmation) initially 
controls subsequent adaptive immune responses and may be captured by [CONTACT_722749].  
 
• Comparison  of SAVE  between  left versus  right  deltoid  muscles  of the same  individual.  
 
Markers  of Cell Senescence  
 
• Changes  in markers  of senescence  in blood  and urine.  
 
Efficacy  
• Reduction  of COVID -19 morbidity  (detection  of viral infection  by [CONTACT_954])

Recruitment sources include: 1) Mayo Clinic Patients 2) Mayo – RST Classified Advertising 3) 
Flyers  within  the community,  4) Newspaper  and Radio  Advertising,  5) Existing  lists/databases  of 
individuals interested in being contact[CONTACT_282521], and 6) Social 
Media including Facebook. Subject recruitment and advertisement will occur on Mayo campus 
and at various sites off campus (e.g., retirement centers). Permis sion will be obtained from each 
location before recruitment begins.  
Entolimod  (CBLB502)  Version  3.[ADDRESS_987053] in recruitment and carry -through  
of the protocol. Written and informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_722750], trained study 
personnel. Please see Inclusion and Exclusion criteria above. Do cumentation of recruitment and 
enrollment efforts will be maintained in a secure institutionally -supported database. Only those 
subjects who provide informed consent will be enrolled in the study; we anticipate enrolling [ADDRESS_987054] completing all of the study related procedures:  
• Any SAE  that precludes further  participation  of the subject;  
• With respect to subjects that have not received study drug, any SAE related to the study 
drug that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_722709] (DSMP) which places subject s at high risk of experiencing the 
same SAE.  
• If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_722710], there is doubt  that a subject, for any reason, 
can continue to fully participate in the study; and  
• Subject  decision  to withdraw  from  the study  (withdrawal  of consent). 
See also Section 10.1, “Study Monitoring Plan”.  
 
In the event  of a subject  withdrawal,  the following  will be performed:  
• Review  of data collected  through  the last in-person  or remote  visit for completeness;  
• Replacement of study subject if the subject did not receive study drug (i.e., early 
withdrawal before study drug administration); and  
• Follow -up for subje cts withdrawn from study, if the treatment visit was completed. The 
exit visit will include those study assessments and procedures that would have been 
performed at the next scheduled visit.  
 
4.4.[ADDRESS_987055] follow up information whenever possible, 
including through medical chart review. As outlined in section 4.4.1 , “When and How to 
Withdraw Subjects,” the exit visit will include those study assessments and procedures that 
would have been performed at the next scheduled visit. Although early withdrawal could be 
related to the safety profile of the study drug, it cou ld also be related to other reasons, and thus 
follow -up assessments  could  be important  in capturing  both additional  safety  information as well 
as study outcomes that affect interpretation of risk versus benefit. Since the study drug will be 
given only once , long -term safety consequences related to participation are expected to be very 
limited.

 5 Study  Drug  
 
5.1 Description  
 
Study drugs (entolimod, diluent and placebo) are manufactured under current Good 
Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).  
 
The study sponsor will provide entolimod as a liquid for IM injection in 2 mL prefilled, single - 
use vials containing 50 µg of entolimod in 0. 5 mL (concentration of 100 µg/mL) of formulation. 
The formulation comprises phosphate -buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% polysorbate 80 
(Tween 80).  
 
For the dilution of 100 µg/mL entolimod the study sponsor will supply entolimod diluent in 50 
mL single use vials filled with 40 mL of phosphate -buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% 
polysorbate 80 (Tween 80).  
 
The study sponsor will also provide a matching placebo. The placebo has the same excipi[INVESTIGATOR_722711] (i.e., PBS cont aining 0.1% Tween 80) and fill - 
finished in the same type of 2 mL single use vials (0.5 mL per vial).  
 
Vials of entolimod and placebo should be kept frozen at -70 +/ - 10℃ and -20 =/ - 5℃ until 
thawed for use. Entolimod contained in vials and stored at -70 + /- 10℃ is stable for ≥7 years.  
The drug can withstand 3 freeze -thaw cycles. Entolimod should be thawed immediately before 
the dilution. Once thawed, study drug can be stored at 5 ⁰ +/- 3⁰C for up to 8 hours. Entolimod 
dilutions should be completed within th e established periods of stability for drug in the thawed 
vials. Diluted entolimod should be administered immediately after dilutions preparation.  
 
5.2 Treatment  Regimen  
 
A single IM injection of study drug (entolimod or placebo) will be administered to each subject 
on the morning of vaccination, Day 1 (to be administered within 1 inch and within 1 minute of  
flu vaccine). The appropriate amount of study drug will be aseptic ally withdrawn from the 
required number of study drug vials into a 1 -mL tuberculin syringe calibrated in 10 -µL units.  
The drug will be administered  from  the syringe  through  a 22-25-gauge  needle  (see table  1 below) 
at a 90o-angle to the skin surface into the deltoid muscle between the acromion process and the 
midaxillary line.

 5.3 Method  for Assigning  Subjects  to Treatment  Groups  
 
Study subjects will be randomized in a dose -escalated 4 -arm study of entolimod in 3 possible 
doses  or placebo  (see table  2 below).  Beginning  in period  1, the first eight  patients  in the 1ug arm 
will be evaluated for safety and tolerability by [CONTACT_722751] r to the enrollment of the  
remainder of the 1ug arm.  In addition, after review we will proceed with recruitment in period [ADDRESS_987056] been accrued. We will recruit the 
balance of the subjects remaining to be enrolled (to obtain 25 subjects per arm) pending safety 
review by [CONTACT_4318].  
 
Randomization will be performed using Medidata Balance software, integrated into the  
electronic case report forms Medidata RAVE. A permuted block design will be used, with 
stratification by [CONTACT_4321].  Subjects and study center personnel involved in the care of subjects will be 
blinded to study drug assignment (entolimod vs. p lacebo).

5.8 Masking/Blinding  of Study  
In order to minimize the study bias, this study will use a process for randomized assignment to 
entolimod or placebo. The investigational drug blind will be maintained using the Research 
Pharmacy processes for preparation of the investigational product. Al l subjects and study 
personnel  except  for those  directly  involved  with study  drug preparation  will be blinded  to study  
Entolimod  (CBLB502)  Version  3.[ADDRESS_987063] entolimod (study drug), entolimod placebo and entolimod diluent will be  
shipped overnight to Mayo Clinic from Almac (Souderton PA), clinical storage and distribution 
facility. Entolimod and entolimod placebo will be shipped on dry ice. Ento limod diluent will be 
shipped on cold packs. Temperature monitors will be enclosed in all packages . 
 
5.9.[ADDRESS_987064] be stored in a safe, secure location with 
limited access.  
 
5.9.3 Dispensing  of Study  Drug  
The study drug is to be used exclusively in the clinical study according to the instructions  of this 
protocol  and directions  for use. The Investigator’s  designee is  responsible  for providing  subjects  with 
the study drug and instructions for dosing and proper storage of the study drug.  
 
The Investigator’s  designee  will record  the amount  of study  drug dispensed  and date of dispensing.  
 
5.9.[ADDRESS_987065] and for the study center staff, 
screening procedures may be performed over as many days as necessary within the specified 
screening period. For scheduled visits and follow -up periods the permitted visit windows are 
indicated in the table.  
Entolimod  (CBLB502)  Version  3.0 
18JUN2020  
following  tests will be performed:  
Page  [ADDRESS_987066] -dose, the acceptable margin for actual 
time is the specified time ±10 minutes. If multiple procedures  are to be done at the same time 
point, the preferred order is vital signs, blood sampling, and then ECG, with blood sampling 
(particularly for pharmacodynamics) occurring as close as possible to the specified time.  
Missed procedures or evaluations should be performed as close to the originally scheduled 
date/time as possible. Based on the investigator’s judgment, an exception can be made when 
rescheduling  becomes  medically  unnecessary  because  it is too close  in time to the next scheduled 
procedure or evaluation. In that case, the missed evaluation may be omitted.  
 
6.1 Visit  1, Screening  Visit  (-28 to -7 days)  
 
A tabulated summary of all visits and assessments described in the following sections is provided in

participation by [CONTACT_44210], subjects will be assigned a subject number. For any subject, it is 
the responsibility of the investigator or study team member to obtain written informed consent 
(subject’s signature) prior to performing any protocol -mandated assessment.  
 
However, assessments performed as part of the routine care of the subject may be used to assess 
eligibility. The subject number will identify the subject througho ut the study.  In case of re -screening, 
the subject number assigned during the first screening procedure will be retained.

6.12 MMSE  and Quality  of Life (QoL)  Assessments  
The Mini -Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a 30 -point questionnaire that is used to measure 
cognitive impairment.  It includes tests of orientation, attention, memory, language and visual - 
spatial skills.  
 
The Short Form (36) Health Survey will be administered to subjects. This survey cons ists of 36 
questions and eight scaled scores (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health 
perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and 
mental health).  
Entolimod  (CBLB502)  Version  3.[ADDRESS_987070] of 5 measures, including grip strength, walking speed, body 
composition, and questionnaires that will assess endurance and energy, unintended weight loss 
and physical activity level.  
 
Skin advanced glycation end products (AGEs ) will be assayed using an AGE Reader®. This non - 
invasive method has a light source that illuminates a skin surface of approximately 4 cm2 on the 
volar side of the forearm. The device uses an excitation light source with peak intensity of 
approximately 37 0 nm to excite fluorescent moieties in the tissue (skin autofluorescence), which 
then will emit light of a different wavelength. In the used wavelength band, the major 
contribution to fluorescence comes from fluorescent AGEs linked mostly to collagen. Emis sion 
light and reflected excitation light from the skin is measured with a spectrometer in the 300 –[ADDRESS_987071] udy for all subjects. The AE and 
serious adverse event (SAE) reporting period begins at the time of informed consent and 
continues through study completion. Adverse events will be assessed at every site and remote 
visit.  
 
The Investigator will follow -up on all AEs observed or reported by [CONTACT_722760] -up is no longer necessary. The Investigator will follow -up on 
SAEs until they are considered resolved or the outcome is kno wn. 
 
Definitions, documentation, and reporting of AEs are described in  Section 8. Serious adverse 
events must be reported within 24 hours as described in Section 8.2.

Entolimod  (CBLB502)  Version  3.[ADDRESS_987074]’s physician if not specifically contraindicated by [CONTACT_70020]. 
Subjects will be discouraged from use of herbal remedies, self -prescribed drugs, tobacco 
products, alcohol, marijuana, or street drug s during their participation in the clinical study.  
 
If considered necessary for  the subject’s well -being, drugs  for concomitant medical conditions or 
for symptom management may be given at the discretion of the investigator. The investigator’s 
decision to  authorize the use of any drug other than study drug will take into account subject 
safety, the medical need, the potential for drug interactions, the possibility for masking  
symptoms of a more significant underlying event, and whether use of the drug will compromise 
the outcome or integrity of the study  
 
Subjects will be instructed about the importance of the need to inform the clinic staff of the use  
of any drugs or remedies (whether prescribed, over -the-counter, or illicit) before and during the 
course of the study.  
 
Recommendations with regard to specif ic types of concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], supportive care, diet 
and other interventions are provided in the protocol. To minimize variations in supportive care, 
the recommended supportive care agents (e.g., loperamide, granisetron) should be used unless 
there is a medical rationale in a specific subject for use of an alternative product.  
 
Anti-inflammatory  or Antipyretic  Drugs  or Corticosteroids  
 
Anti-inflammatory or antipyretic drugs may not be administered prophylactically. Thereafter, 
subjects may receive ibupr ofen, 400 mg orally, as needed every 4 to 6 hours in response to 
constitutional symptoms, fever or malaise occurring following study drug administration. Other 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be substituted as medically necessary.  
Post-entolimod use of acetaminophen, [ADDRESS_987075]  experiences  hypotension  (SBP  <90 mm Hg or DBP  <60 mm Hg; a > 
20 mm Hg drop in SBP or > 10 mm Hg drop in SBP with symptoms  at any time after 
administration  of study  drug or with orthostatics)  it may be managed  according  to standards  of

 care until the SBP  is ≥90 mmHg and the DBP  is ≥60 mmHg on ≥2 determinations obtained ≥1 
hour apart [or until BP approaches within 10% of baseline (pre -study drug values) with  
resolution of symptoms]. It should be emphasized that a subject’s clinical condition, rather than 
blood pressure alone, should be the primary basis for any intervention or medical decision - 
making.  
• As much  as possible,  subjects  should  be kept at rest following  study  drug administration.  
• A subject requiring use of the bathroom should be evaluated for orthostatic changes. If  
the blood pressure is stable upon standing, and if the subject has no symptoms, the  
subject may ambulate to the bathroom, but study personnel should en sure the subject’s 
safety. If there is a clinically significant drop in systolic blood pressure, or the subject 
complains of lightheadedness upon standing, the subject should be encouraged to use an 
emesis basin, urinal, bedpan, or bedside commode, as appr opriate for the circumstances.  
• For any hypotension more significant than minor dizziness, treatment should follow 
standard clinic protocol.  
 
7 Statistical  Plan  
 
7.1 Sample  Size Determination  
 
A sample size of 25 per arm provides 90% power to detect a doubling (100% increase) in 
geometric  mean  influenza  antibody  titer A/H1N1 based  on a one -sided two -sample  t-test at alpha 
level 0.15.  This calculation assumes a coefficient of variation of 2.0 for  A/H1N1.  Under the 
assumption of smaller coefficient of variation for A/H3N2 and B antibody titers of 1.4, 25 per 
arm provides 90% power to detect an 80% increase in these antibody titers at alpha level 0.15. 
Thus, we plan to enroll [ADDRESS_987076].  
 
Descriptive  Statistics  
Data will be described and summarized by [CONTACT_722765] (entolimod 1μg, 3 μg, 10 μg,  
or placebo) and time point.  Descriptive summaries will include sample size, mean and standard 
deviation, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, minimum and maximum for continuous variables 
and percentage for categorical variables.  Baseline/screening data will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_722766] (25th-75th) percentiles and percentage for continuous and 
categorical data, re spectively.  Study drug administration, concomitant medication use,  
supportive care use, AEs, laboratory abnormalities, vital signs/oxygen saturation, body weight, 
virology data, quality of life and frailty index status will be described and summarized.

 Primary Hypothesis: We hypothesize that entolimod will cause an increase in influenza 
antibody titers at 4 weeks in comparison to placebo  
 
The distribution of antibody titers (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B) during follow up is anticipated to be 
skewed based on reporting in prior studies and a log -transformation will be applied to these 
outcomes.  Antibody titers are measured at multiple time points in the first week after treatment, 
4 weeks, 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months.  A hierarchical mixed -effects regression model 
will be fit separa tely for the 3 endpoints, adjusting for the baseline/screening observation of the 
titer (an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach).  The model will include random subject - 
specific intercepts and model time as discrete.  The primary outcome comparison is a contrast 
analysis of the outcome at [ADDRESS_987077] at alpha level 0.15 to 
each dose comparison (vs. placebo) and antibody titer combination, without multiplicity 
adjustment.  The primary analysis will be conducted using the modified intent -to-treat analysis 
dataset.  
 
Secondary Hypotheses : Secondary and exploratory endpoints require a variety of standard 
statistical methods.  
 
Key secondary endpoints include the frailty indices, measures of physical function ([ADDRESS_987078] and grip strength), and quality of life (QOL).  Frailty indices are measured at 2, 6, and 
12 months and QOL measured at each study visit.  For these outcomes, linear mixed effects 
models will assess the relationship between randomized arm and outcomes over time.  Discrete 
times will be considered corresponding to the stu dy visit and secondary analyses may consider 
continuous linear time (constant slope over time) for changes in the outcome.  For these 
outcomes, the 12 month observation is the primary comparison.  
 
Upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], including influenza, will be r ecorded over the follow up period.  
We anticipate the total number of these will be infrequent.  Thus, we compare the outcome of 
any infection (vs. no infection) across randomized arms using a Pearson chi -square test or 
Fisher’s exact test.  Secondary approac hes may consider analysis of the ordinal count of the 
number of infections, analyzed using a trend test.  
 
Cellular immune response and pharmacodynamics parameters, including concentration of 
circulating plasma cytokines and cytokine response to virial stim ulation are outcomes compared 
using analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods across the four comparison groups. 
Pharmacodynamic measures will be listed and will be summarized using appropriate graphical 
and tabular methods. Statistical analysis evaluating phar macodynamic parameters will be 
performed using contrasts in the context of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).  
 
Handling  of Missing  Data  
In the analysis of primary outcomes, data are analyzed using a hierarchical regression approach 
assuming missing  data are  missing at random.  In a secondary approach, patients with dropout or 
missing follow up due to influenza viral infection during follow up will be assumed missing not 
at random  and missing  data will be imputed  to the baseline/screening  value  reflecting  no increase  
Entolimod  (CBLB502)  Version  3.[ADDRESS_987079]  Populati on(s)  for Analysis  
The primary analysis uses a modified intent -to-treat principle.  Patients will be analyzed based  
on randomized arm using methods described previously.  Exploratory analyses will assess 
whether a differential sex -based response to treatment  exists for the primary outcomes and 
secondary outcomes of FI and QOL, using interaction terms in regression models.  
 
8 Safety  and Adverse  Events  
For safety  analyses, AEs will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory  
Activities (MedDRA). The severity of AEs will be graded by [CONTACT_722767]. Concomitant medication use will be coded using 
the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHODRUG) into Anatomical Therapeutic - 
Chemical classification (ATC) codes; these data descriptions will partic ularly focus on  
supportive  medications and  care provided  in response  to any study -study -induced adverse  effects 
and to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_722721]. For ECG assessment of QT intervals, correction by [CONTACT_722768], and the dat a will be summarized by [CONTACT_722769].  
 
A safety  analysis will be conducted after 20 patients (5 per arm) have been randomized and 
completed the one -week safety follow -up period.  After the last subject has completed their one - 
week safety follow -up period, there will be a temporary halt in additional pa rticipation pending 
analysis of safety outcomes, anticipated to be no longer than seven days. A safety report will be 
generated after the 20th patient completes 1 week follow up, summarizing all adverse events 
overall and by [CONTACT_722770] (groups denoted as A -D in random order).  If 
appropriate, as  described below,  unblinded  and subject -level  adverse  event  data will be provided. 
Adverse events, both short term (14 days) and long term (through 365 days), will continue to be 
collected with ongoing monitoring as specified in the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP).  
 
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated  Problems  Involving  Risk  to Subjects  or Others  (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
Any unanticipated  problem  or adverse  event  that meets the  following  three  criteria:  
• Serious : Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be 
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the 
subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: ( 1)

 death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or 
prolonged;  (4) disability/incapacity - persistent  or significant;  (5) birth  defect/anomaly;  (6) 
breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, even ts, or new information (i.e. 
publications,  DSMB reports,  interim  findings,  product  labeling  change) that  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_293129], safety, or welfare of the subjects 
or others, or substantially compromise the  research data, AND  
• Unanticipated : (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already 
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A proble m or event is 
"unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or 
event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased 
severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A problem  or event  is "related"  if it is possibly  related  to the research  procedures.  
 
Adverse  Event  
An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug,  
device, biologic) in a patient or research subject.  
Serious  Adverse  Event  
Adverse  events  are classified  as serious  or non-serious.  Serious  problems/events  can be well 
defined and include;  
• death  
• life threatening  adverse  experience  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• inpatient,  new,  or prolonged;  disability/incapacity  
• persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity  
• birth defect/anomaly  
 
and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37021] -investigator 
may have adversely affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or 
substantially compromised the research data.  
 
All adverse  events  that do not meet  any of the criteria  for serious,  should  be regarded  as non- 
serious adverse events . 
 
Adverse  Event  Reporting  Period  
For this study, the study treatment follow -up period is  defined as (365) days following the last  
administration of study treatment.  
 
Preexisting  Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, in tensity, or the character of the 
condition worsens during the study period.

 General  Physical  Examination  Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting  
condition.  At the end of the study, any  new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that 
meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse 
event.  
 
Post-study  Adverse  Event  
All unresolved  adverse events  should  be followed  by [CONTACT_456] -investigator  until the events  are 
resolved, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last 
scheduled visit, the sponsor -investigator should instruct each subject to report, to the sponsor - 
investigator, any subsequent event( s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, 
believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  
 
Abnormal  Laboratory  Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if it changes from 
value within the normal range before treatment to one outside and worse than the normal range 
after treatment. Such changes will prompt a repeat test, telephone c all to check the subject’s 
status, a repeat visit, and/or referral to the subject’s primary care physician.

if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.  
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances:  
 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_713894] a preexisting condition. Surgery will not be reported as an outcome of an adverse  
event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was 
uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_722723], 
unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49849].  
• A visit to the emergency department or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_722724] t <24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event).  
• Elective  surgery  planned  prior  to signing  consent.  
• Admissions  as per protocol  for a planned  medical/surgical  procedure.  
• Routine health assess ment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., 
routine mammogram).  
• Medical or surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation will be obtained in these cases.

event section of  the case repor t form (CRF)  or in a separate  adverse event worksheet.  All clearly 
related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic, laboratory or procedure results should 
recorded in the source document.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recor ded. The clinical course of 
each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the probable cause.  Serious adverse 
events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up, to determine the 
final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs during the Adverse Event Reporting

Information  collected  on the adverse  event  worksheet  (and entered  in the research  database) : 
• Subject’s  name:  
• Medical  record  number:  
• Disease/histology  (if applicable):  
• The date the adverse  event  occurred:  
• Description  of the adverse  event:  
• Relationship  of the adverse  event  to the research  (drug,  procedure,  or intervention*):  
• If the adverse  event  was expected:  
• The severity  of the adverse  event:  (use a  table  to define  severity  scale  1-5**) 
• If any intervention  was necessary:  
• Resolution:  (was  the incident  resolved  spontaneously  or after discontinuing treatment)  
• Date  of Resolution:  
 
The Investigator will review all adverse event reports to determine if specific reports need to be 
made  to the IRB  and FDA.  The sponsor -investigator  will report  to the Mayo  IRB any UPI[INVESTIGATOR_484382] -UPI[INVESTIGATOR_722725]. The sponsor - 
investigator will sign and date the adverse event report when it is reviewed. For this protocol, 
only directly related SAEs/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_205276].  
 
Relationship  
The relationship of a n AE to the Investigational Drug is a clinical decision by [CONTACT_456] - 
investigator (PI) based on all available information at the time of the completion of the CRF and 
is graded as follows:  
Entolimod  (CBLB502)  Version  3.0

Page  47 of 56 
R. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_566877],  M.D.,  Ph.D.  CONFIDENTIAL   
  
1. Not related: a reaction for which sufficient information exists to indicate that the etiology is 
unrelated to the study drug; the subject did not receive the study medication or the temporal 
sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the study medication is not reasonable or 
the event is c1early related to other factors such as the subject's clinical state, therapeutic 
intervention or concomitant therapy.  
 
2. Unlikely: a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relatio nship 
to drug administration which makes a causal relationship improbable and in which other drugs, 
chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
 
3. Possible: a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the drug but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_64758]; information on drug withdrawals may be lacking are unclear.  
 
4. Probable: a clinical event including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (de - 
challenge): re -challenge information is not required  to fulfi1 this definition.  
 
5. Definite: a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug, or in which the drug level has been established in body fluids or tissues, that follows a 
known  or expected  response  pattern  to the suspected  drug,  and that is confirmed  by [CONTACT_342054][INVESTIGATOR_11125], and reappearance of the reaction on repeated 
exposure (re -challenge).  
 
Severity  
The maximum intensity of an AE during a day should be graded according to the definitions 
below and recorded in deta ils as indicated on the CRF. If the intensity of an AE changes over a 
number of days, then separate entries should be made having distinct onset dates.  
 
1. Mild: AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not interfere with 
patient’s daily activities.  
 
2. Moderate: AEs typi[INVESTIGATOR_258812] a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient and 
may interfere with daily activities, but ar e usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212].  
 
3. Severe: AEs interrupt a patient's usual daily activity and traditionally require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment.  
 
8.2.2 Sponsor -Investigator  reporting:  Notifying  the FDA  
The sponsor -investigator wi ll report to the FDA all unexpected, serious suspected adverse 
reactions according to the required IND Safety Reporting timelines, formats and requirements.  
Entolimod  (CBLB502)  Version  3.[ADDRESS_987082] a causal relationship between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be 
reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA 
Medwatch Form 3500A, no later than 7 calendar days after the sponso r-investigator’s initial 
receipt of the information about the event.  
 
Other  unexpected  serious suspected adverse  reactions where there is evidence  to suggest a  causal 
relationship between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be reported as a serious 
suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Medwatch Form 3500A, 
no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor -investigator’s initial receipt of the information 
about the event.  
 
Any clinically important increase in the rate of serious suspected adverse reactions over those 
listed in the protocol or product insert will be reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction. 
This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Medwatch Form 3500A n o later than 15 calendar days 
after the sponsor -investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the event.  
 
The sponsor -investigator must also notify the FDA (and sponsors  must notify all participating 
investigators) in an IND safety report of pote ntial serious risks, from clinical trials or any other 
source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor 
determines that the information qualifies for reporting under § 312.32(c)(1)(i) -(iv). 
 
Findings from other stud ies in human or animals that suggest a significant risk in humans 
exposed to the drug will  be reported.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no 
later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor -investigators initial receipt of the information ab out 
the event.  
 
8.3 Unmasking/Unblinding  Procedures

recorded in the source documents, CRFs or Event forms/logs.  
 
8.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_14123]  
A pre-specified  safety  assessment  will be conducted  after 20 subjects  (5 per arm)  have  completed 
a one -week safety follow up period.  Initial reports will maintain blinding of study arms.  If any 
study arm reports a serious adverse event or ≥ 2 total adverse e vents that are possible, probable, 
or definite relation to the investigational study drug, study arms will be unblinded and data 
provided to an independent monitor as specified in the DSMB.  Active high dose arms may be 
stopped early if safety concerns aris e related to the investigational drug.

 8.5 Medical  Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her 
site. This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse 
events as noted above, as well as the construction and im plementation of a site data and safety - 
monitoring plan (see section 10 “Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting”).  Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.  
 
8.5.[ADDRESS_987083]  
A four person DSMB (clinical researchers) not affiliated with the study will be responsible for 
evaluating the progress of the study and will be provide unblinded data on a regular basis to 
monitor patient safety. This committee will communicate b y meeting every other week during  
the enrollment phase as the study team will be utilizing a dose -escalated recruitment strategy. 
The DSMB members will be responsible for determining if and when the next dose can be 
administered in a subset of subjects or if the study must be discontinued as a result of excessive 
adverse events.  Study data will be provided to the DSMB by [CONTACT_66568] 
(including all adverse event reports). Data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_722772].  Randomizati on codes for each enrolled patient will be provided by [CONTACT_69717].  The Committee will makes its recommendations by [CONTACT_722773], data, 
outcomes, toxicity, safety and other confidential data, and may recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_722729].

Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What  protected  health  information  (PHI)  will be collected  from  subjects  in this study  
• Who  will have  access  to that information  and why 
• Who  will use or disclose  that information  
• The rights  of a research  subject  to revoke  their authorization  for use of their PHI. 
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked auth orization to collect or use PHI, attempts  
should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (long term survival status that 
the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.

 9.2 Source  Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source 
data are contained in source  documents.  Examples of  these orig inal documents, and data  records 
include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ 
diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_722730], 
microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and 
records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved  
in the clinical trial.  
 
9.3 Case  Report  Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study. Case 
reports  in the form  of completed  checklists  will be kept to ensure  inclusion/exclusion  criteria and 
review of adverse events/toxicity. All data requested on the CRF will be recorded in indelible 
pen. Pencils are not to be used.  Missing data will be explained. If a space on the CRF is left 
blank because the procedure was not done or the quest ion was not asked, “N/D” will be written. 
If the item is not applicable to the individual case, “N/A” will be written. All entries will be 
printed legibly in black ink. If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, a single 
straight line will  be drawn through the incorrect entry and the correct data will be entered above 
it. All such changes  will be initialed  and dated.  Errors  will not  be erased  and “white -out” will not 
be used to correct errors. For clarification of illegible or uncertain ent ries, the clarification will  
be printed above the item, initialed, and dated. If the reason for the correction is not clear or 
needs additional explanation, details will be added related to the justification for the correction.  
 
Data  Management  
The data will be housed  in both hard copy  case report  forms  (CRFs)  and eCRFs  through  a system 
called Medidata RAVE.  
 
Data  Processing  
Source documents and CRFs and original consents will be stored in secured locations. All data 
will be entered into a password protected, limited access database. Individually -identifiable 
patient  history  and medical  record  information  will be stored  in a database  under  coded accession 
numbers. Clinical laboratory values will be stored in the electronic medical record system, 
requiring protected password access. These data are monitored regularly for access and a formal 
policy regarding protection of persona l privacy is in place. The key to identification of subjects 
will be maintained in a secure office environment under the direction of the principal 
investigators.

appropriate oversight and attention to the protection of human subjects and quality assurance. 
The DSMB will have the following monitoring activities: (1) Review of a pre -specified safety 
assessment after [ADDRESS_987087] completed safety follow -up period day 1; If the 
DSMB determines that it is safe to proceed the next dose will be administered and a safety 
assessment  will be performed  to determine  if it is safe to continue  to the highest  dosing  of 10ug;  
(2) prospective review of any issues related to the safety of subjects; and (3) regular review (i.e., 
twice yearly) of measures designed to protect the validity of the data and the integrity of the 
research study. With regard to  monitoring activity (2), safety issues will include the timely 
review of all SAEs (within 24 hours) and the regular review (every 3 months) of all AEs. With 
regard to monitoring activity 3, the DSMB will review with the principle investigator and lead 
study coordinator the methods in which data is collected, stored, and protected, including review 
of randomly selected subject case report and other forms. The DSMB will also identify when to 
terminate a subject’s participation by [CONTACT_722774][INVESTIGATOR_722731]. Prescribed individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_722732]:  (1) Any SAE  that precludes  further  participation  of the subject;

progresses.  Written reports will be issued to the Sponsor -Investigator and Study Coordinator 
and should be provided to the IRB by [CONTACT_722775].  
 
The Principle Investigat or will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities, give access 
to all study -related documents and study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, 
etc.) as needed, and provide adequate space to conduct monitoring inquiries.  
 
10.2 Audi ting and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], the 
sponsor, and government regulatory agencies, of all study related documents (e.g. source 
documents, regulatory documents, data collection ins truments, study data etc.).  The investigator 
will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, 
diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential ins pection by

Plan and Pledge, HIV Self-testing in South Africa
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
IRB Protocol #833047  
Version 2, May 3 2019 
1.BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE
Reaching the “90- 90-90” targets and ending the AIDS epi[INVESTIGATOR_799882]. Driven by [CONTACT_799901], these efforts 
have included a rapid scale -up of HIV services, in cluding HIV testing, medical male circumcision, and 
antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, behavioral factors have been important barriers to maximizing 
the effectiveness of resources devoted to HIV/AIDS. This is particularly evident in the low uptake of H IV 
services among young men in in eastern and southern Africa, with limited uptake of testing and linkage 
to HIV care in this population contributing to HIV incidence that remains above elimination targets.  
Insights from behavioral economics and related di sciplines have highlighted various barriers to health -
seeking behavior generally and also pointed to an array of low -cost interventions that have the potential 
to increase uptake of HIV services and promote behavior change more generally.  
In collaboration  with Wits Reprod uctive Health and HIV Institute (WRHI),  University of the 
Witwatersrand , this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799883] -testing in 
South Africa. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_799884]’s  STAR program  (HIV Self -Test ing Africa)  at the fixed -
distribution sites . A copy of the approved protocol for the STAR program is included in this submission. 
Further b ackground on the HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_799885] -testing can be found in the  
attached protocol for the STA R initiative. Background  for this specific pi[INVESTIGATOR_799886]:  
Commitment devices and planning prompts are effective strategies for individuals to translate their 
behavioral intentions into actions, particularly when barriers to the desired behav ior include 
procrastination, prospective memory failures, and hassle factors  [1-5]. Planning prompts  may also be  
effective in overcoming ambiguity aversion and information avoidance, and can leverage people’s  
intrinsic desire to maintain a consistent self -image and also do what they believe to be the descriptive  
and injunctive norm  [6-7]. 
In the context of the STAR program  that is distributing HIV self -tests in South Africa , one of the desired  
outcomes is  that individuals who obtain a self -test kit at distr ibution site s go on to take the test either 
immediately  on site  or in the near future  at their home. A second desired outcome is that after using the  
self-test kit, individuals who use self -tests will report their results to a WhatsApp number that has been  
established for this purpose . A third desired outcome is that individuals who obtain a reactive test result 
will seek a confirmatory test at local clinics that provide HIV testing and counseling services.  Those with 
a confirmed HIV -positive test result can be encouraged to seek HIV care, which includes treatment with  
antiretroviral therapy (ART) . This pi[INVESTIGATOR_799887] s 
administered at the time of self -tests distribution are effecti ve in promoting the desired behaviors .

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.[ADDRESS_1103716] 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_799888] 1) consent to phone/SMS follow -up, 2) Are successfully reached for follow -up by [CONTACT_799902] [ADDRESS_1103717], 3) Report self-test result on the dedicated WhatsApp 
number and are HIV positive, 4) test on -site 5) Seek confirmatory testing  
3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.[ADDRESS_1103718] distribution by [CONTACT_799903] . A copy of these instructions are incl uded in this submission.  The two arms in the study will be:  
1) Usual Care, “Promote”:  A card with information to report results via WhatsApp, similar to the existing 
card  used in the STAR program.  with a dedicated USUAL CARE WhatsApp number (different from the  
existing campaign numbers). 2) Plan and Pledge :  The Usual Care card + a brief template to “make a 
plan”  and “make a pledge”  for test completion and results reporting, to take the test . The c ard will 
include a dedicated Plan and Pledge WhatsApp number .  
Potential self-tester recipi[INVESTIGATOR_799889], including Plan and Pledge  statements if  assigned  
to th is condition, and will be encouraged by [CONTACT_799904] r own time to make a 
plan and sign the pledge as part of receiving the test kit and instructions  for how to complete the cards  
(see draft scripts below). Importantly, testers will be able to keep the card for themselves. There is no 
expectation to share th e plan and pledge signature [CONTACT_799917] -tests .  
Field staff will clarify for self-tests recipi[INVESTIGATOR_799890].   
Examples of script use d for each arm:  
Usual care , “Promote” : On this card you’ll see this WhatsApp number. After you do your screening test,  
you can report the test results to this number – it’s very easy, and it’s completely confidential. It’s 
important to report your results – positive or negative – for three reasons: 1. So we know you used the  
test and it went ok. 2. So we can help you understand the results. 3 . If you need our support to help you 
get care and services you need. If you don’t have a camera on your phone, you can just text the results – 
see the instructions here. What questions do you have about reporting results?  •HIVST: HIV self-testing
•UPenn: University of Pennsylvania
where you can make a plan to do the test – like when you’ll do it, where, and if anyone will be with you 
when you do the test. This plan is just for you, we don’t need to see it, but it’s a good way to help you do 
the test now that you’ve pi[INVESTIGATOR_799891].  And then on this part of the card, you have a place where you can 
make a pledge or commitment to yourself to do the test and report results when you’re done to the 
WhatsApp number. This pledge is just for you to help you carry out your plan to do the test and report 
results.   
3.2 Randomization  
We will use cluster randomization with team -day pair serving as  the unit of r andomization (i.e. two 
pairs of STAR field staff will be randomized by [CONTACT_799905]. C lusters of individuals will receive self -
tests at a distribution site from a pair of STAR field staff on an individual day). Computer -generated 
randomization will be used to assign team -day pair  clusters to the [ADDRESS_1103719] , South Africa.  
3.3 Study Measures  
The study will be implemented by [CONTACT_799906]. UPenn will only partake in the design and the analysis of de-
identified aggregate data. As such, all study procedures will be conducted by [CONTACT_799907] . WHRI will share any modifications submitted to 
Witwatersrand IRB with the UPenn team, and the UPenn  team will share these documents with UPenn  
IRB according to the specific requirements and procedures of the UPenn IRB.  
During distribution of the self-tests, an intake form will be completed  (a copy of this form can be found 
in the attached STAR SOP ). This form will track the self- test recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s arm assignment , on-site of off -
site testing, and consent for follow -up phone call.  
If a self -test recipi[INVESTIGATOR_799892] a follow -up call , they will be asked  the 
following series of questions ( questions are sequential and continuation of questions  is dependent on  
response to previous question ): Did they use self -test? What is  their test result ? (if they are willing to 
share), W ould like a confirmatory test ? Did they attended confirmatory testing ? What was the  
confirmatory test result? Would they want to be linked to care?  What date were they linked to care? 
ART initiation? Date of ART initiation? Linked to VMMC? Date of VMMC?  
As outlined in the attached STAR WhatsApp card, all text messages are confidential and de -identified. 
Data tracking record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_799893] -identified with only the HIV self -test kit bar code recorded.  
Please see section 5 Statistical Plan for outcomes and analysis. 
STUDY POPULATION AND DURATION OF PARTICIPANTION  
3.4 Duration  of Study Participation Plan and Pledge: Same as usual care, with the addition of:  On this part of the card, you have a place  
period. Participants are instructed to use the H IV self -test at home and complete the Plan  and Pledge  
form  whenever they choose . If the participants opts to test on -site, they can complete the Plan and  
Pledge on -site as well. P articipants are asked during distribution if they would like to receive a follow -up 
call, as part of standard procedures with the STAR program . Follow -up ca lls will be made by [CONTACT_799908] [ADDRESS_1103720], South Africa.  
3.6 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Please reference the attached STAR protocol for inclusion and exclusion criteria. This study will be  
implemented by [CONTACT_799909].  
Inclusion: Must be 19 years or older  
Exclusion: Any potential testers that are visibly intoxicated will be turned away, as alcohol effects the 
test results.   
      3.[ADDRESS_1103721] r esults to study WhatsApp number are all  
optional. Participants can opt to not complete any of the testing or follow -up steps at any time. This also 
applies to the Pledge and/or Plan cards.  
4. STUDY PROCEDURES 
Please reference the STAR protocol and SOP for s tudy procedures. The UPenn study team will be part of 
study design and analysis of de-identified aggregate data but will not play any role in study  
implementation. All aspects of implementation will be managed by [CONTACT_799910] B.  
5. STATISTICAL PLAN  
5.[ADDRESS_1103722] distribution and there is no follow- up 
reporting) with 80% power and at alpha = .05, with rho=.01 and cluster size per day = 30 per arm , we 
plan to recruit 660 participants per arm with a total of 1,320  participants.  
5.2 Statistical Methods  
We will compare primary and secondary outcomes in the Plan and Pledge arm to the Usual Care , 
“Promote”  arm using 2- tailed chi -squared tests as well as logistic regression analyses. Analyses will 
adjust for correlation of outcomes within clusters.   We hypothesize that a higher proportion of 
participants in the Plan and Pledge  arm will report their self -test results than in the Usual Care arm , 
“Promote” .

(JTHFT), is diminished in patients with severe paresis  by [CONTACT_911468], 66% following right -hemisphere 
damage and 115% following left hemisphere damage.  We hypothesize that such large deficits in the 
non-paretic arm inte rfere with the performance of functional activities in patients with severe paresis, 
who also cannot use the paretic arm for prehension and manipulation .  
We have specifically designed an intervention to remediate the hemisphere -specific deficits in 
the no n-paretic arm, using a virtual -reality platform. We then facilitate generalization and transfer to 
functional behaviors encountered in the natural environment by [CONTACT_911469] a variety of real objects. This intervention  protocol is grounded in the premise that 
targeted remediation of fundamental control deficits exhibited by [CONTACT_11339] -paretic arm will generalize 
beyond practiced tasks to functional activities and functional independence. This intervention contrasts 
with th e more typi[INVESTIGATOR_911447], and the more pragmatic task -
specific training therapi[INVESTIGATOR_911448]’s which we argue is limited in scope, more cumbersome and 
ignores known fundamental motor control deficits. The impact  of the proposed research is that we 
address persistent functional performance deficits in chronic stroke patients with severe paresis, who’s 
non-paretic arm impairments are generally ignored in most current rehabilitation protocols. We propose 
a 2-site, two -group randomized intervention with a treatment group, which will receive unilateral 
training of the non -paretic arm, through our Virtual Reality and Manipulation Training ( VRMT ) protocol. 
The control group will receive a comparison intervention, designed to match the experimental 
intervention in duration and frequency, but employs conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_911449]. This proposal combines the 
research and recruiting strengths of two active laboratories, each with a history of studying hemisphere 
specific motor deficits in stroke survivors (Sainburg and Winstein), and stroke clinical trial intervent ion 
research (Winstein). We have already integrated our laboratories to conduct the pi[INVESTIGATOR_911450], detailed below.  
 
Aim 1: To determine whether non -paretic arm VRMT in chronic stroke survivor s with severe paresis 
will produce durable improvements in non -paretic arm motor performance that will generalize to 
improve functional activities and functional independence to a greater extent than conventional 
therapy focused on the paretic arm.  We pred ict that: 1a) Unilateral VRMT  training of the non -paretic 
arm will produce functional improvements in non -paretic arm motor performance (JTHFT), 1b) 
Conventional therapy focused on the paretic arm should decrease paretic arm impairment (Fugl -Meyer) 
to a gr eater or equal extent than non -paretic arm VRMT . We will assess paretic arm impairment level 
using the upper extremity component of the Fugl -Meyer Assessment (UEFM) as our primary measure, 
and “work area” using kinematic analysis, as detailed by [CONTACT_911470]-workers [5] as our secondary 
measure. 1c) The effects of non -paretic arm VRMT will generalize to functional activities (Abilhand) and 
functional independence (FIM -motor/Barthel) to a greater extent than conventional paretic arm 
therapy.  This aim provides a strong test of our hypothesis that non -paretic arm motor training will have 
a greater impact on functional independence than conventional paretic arm training in patients who lack 
paretic hand function, a prediction supported by [CONTACT_10323][INVESTIGATOR_123704] (see Figure 8).  
 
Aim 2: To determine whether intervention -induced improvements in non -paretic arm performance 
are associated with improvements in hemisphere -specific reaching kinematics.  We predict that VRMT 
-induced improvements in performance will be correlated with reductions in hemisphere -specific motor 
deficits [6-9], which are targeted by [CONTACT_911471] . We will test this using a 
planar reaching paradigm that we developed and employed in the previous cycle of this grant for 
Page 5 of 26 (V.04/27/201 7)  quantifying hemisphere -specific non -paretic arm kinematics [6]. We predict that improvements in 
functional performance (JTHFT) will correlate better with early tr ajectory variance  in LHD patients, but 
with late trajectory variance  in RHD patients. These variables have previously been associated with left 
and right hemisphere processes, respectively.  
 
Aim 3: To determine whether our experimental intervention (non -paretic arm VRMT) might have 
detrimental effects on paretic arm impairment (Fugl -Meyer, Kinematics).  We predict that VRMT 
dependent improvements in non -paretic arm motor performance will not  decrement  paretic arm 
impairment level, a prediction supported by  [CONTACT_10323][INVESTIGATOR_10299] (Figure 7) and the findings of Urbin et al [10]. 
This aim is important to ensure that VRMT of the non -paretic arm does not have a negative effect on 
paretic arm function. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_26923] [ADDRESS_1280312] reductions in paretic arm impairment.

2.0 Background   
 
2.1 Scientific Background and Gaps  
Stroke is a major health problem in the [LOCATION_002] that leaves many survivors with chr onic 
motor impairment, including hemiparesis in the limbs that are on the opposite side of the body to the 
damaged brain hemisphere. A substantial body of research has now established that the non -paretic 
arm often has motor deficits that limit performance  of activities of daily living and thus functional 
independence [6, 8, 11 -22]. The significance of the proposed research is that we developed a targeted 
remediation protocol to ameliorate persistent functional performance deficits in chronic stroke patient s 
with severe paresis, who’s non -paretic arm impairments are generally ignored in most current 
rehabilitation protocols. Our intervention protocol is grounded in the premise that targeted remediation 
of fundamental control deficits exhibited by [CONTACT_11339] -paretic arm will generalize and transfer beyond 
practiced tasks to functional activities and functional independence. The previous cycle of this grant 
detailed the mechanistic underpi[INVESTIGATOR_911451] -paretic arm motor deficits. The scientific premise of this 
proposal is based on the finding that non -paretic arm motor deficits become functionally limiting in 
patients with severe paresis, who are unable to use the paretic arm for manipulation [23]. This group of 
patients is identified by [CONTACT_911472] -Mey er (FM) score between 0 -28 and a score of 0 
(inability to perform) in the mass extension and prehension components of the Fugl -Meyer Assessment.  
Woytowicz et al [1] recently reported a cluster analysis of 247 stroke patients, and identified a 
severely par etic group in the FM score range of 0 -28. With the exception of mass finger flexion, 95 -100% 
Page 6 of 26 (V.04/27/201 7)  of the patients scored 0 (unable to perform) for each item of the wrist movement, mass finger 
extension, and each prehension item of the FM. Thus, this severely pa retic group of stroke patients is 
unable to use the paretic arm for manipulation purposes in activities of daily living. Deficits in 
coordination of the non -paretic arm can thus produce substantial limitations in the speed and efficacy of 
functional activi ties in this population. In fact, our preliminary findings (see Figure 2) indicate that 
unilateral tasks with the non -paretic arm take, on average, twice as long to complete as the comparable 
arm of age -matched control participants, indicating labored and inefficient movement that can interfere 
with patient’s participation in activities. Unfortunately, clinical rehabilitation has yet to recognize the 
need to address non -paretic arm motor deficits, largely because scientific evidence has not yet been 
transla ted into clinical practice, nor has the best practice for this translation been specified through 
innovative intervention studies. This proposal will directly address these shortcomings, in order to 
provide a model for understanding how to incorporate non -paretic arm motor training into clinical 
rehabilitation practice for patients with severe paresis. It should be noted, however, that in animal 
models, training of the non -paretic arm in the acute phase of stroke recovery has been shown to 
interfere with su bsequent paretic arm recovery [24, 25]. In addition, constraining the use of the non -
paretic arm can facilitate functional recovery in those stroke survivors with mild to moderate paresis 
who are capable of distal manipulation in the contralesional hand, b ut who avoid using that arm due to 
learned non -use [26, 27].  
Importantly, our proposed intervention focuses on patients with severe paresis who are in the 
chronic phase of stroke, and who do not have the sensorimotor requisites for paretic hand dexterity or 
manipulation. In this group of patients, recent findings indicate that intense resistance training of the 
non-paretic arm can reduce impairment measured in the paretic arm [10]. Consistent with this finding, 
our pi[INVESTIGATOR_911452] -paretic  arm dexterity training also leads to a modest reduction in 
paretic arm impairment. Thus, we expect that the unilateral non -paretic arm VRMT training proposed 
here will improve functional independence without jeopardizing paretic arm function in patients w ith 
severe paresis (Aim 3). Our ultimate goal is to determine whether non -paretic arm remediation should 
be part of a package of rehabilitation that assesses and remediates fundamental control deficits in each 
arm of severely paretic stroke patients [4].  
 
2.2 Previous Data  
 Preliminary Studies: Our findings from the previous grant cycle showed that the nature of non -
paretic arm motor deficits can be explained by a model of hemispheric lateralization for motor control 
[64]. Thus, damage to each hemisphere produces specific and  unique motor deficits in the non -paretic 
arm [7, 9]. Figure 1A  shows reaching movements in the non -paretic arm of patients with left and right 
hemisphere damage. While patients with left hemisphere damage (LHD) made highly curved 
movements with accurate f inal positions, patients with right hemisphere damage (RHD) made straight 
movements with poor final position accuracies. Figure 1B  shows the variance in hand positions during 
the initial trajectory phase (bottom ellipses) and in the final position (top ell ipses) of the movement. This 
demonstrates the double dissociation between hemisphere of damage and motor control process 
effected by [CONTACT_552601]: RHD patients had deficits in stabilizing accurate final positions across trials, while 
LHD patients had deficit s in stabilizing accurate initial trajectories across trials. We characterized these 
hemisphere -dependent movement deficits in studies that restricted motion to the horizontal plane; this 
was necessary to better control experimental variables, such as the joint displacements associated with 
a particular target. To achieve Aim 2, we will use this well -established horizontal reaching paradigm that 
yields initial positional variance (at peak velocity) and final position variance (at movement end) to 
assess pot ential training -related changes in hemisphere -specific motor deficits.  
 As an important foundation for the proposed research, we tested whether non -paretic arm 
motor function depends on the severity of paresis in the contralesional arm, and on the side of the brain 
that is damaged [23]. All patients were right -handed, prior to stroke. Figure [ADDRESS_1280313] 
(raw score). The JTHFT is a clinical assessment of unilateral arm function [65] that includes a range of 
Page 7 of 26 (V.04/27/201 7)  tasks that simulate the coordination requirements of functional daily activities [66, 67]. Th e left column 
in Figure 2 (control) shows the difference between healthy participants performing with the non -
dominant left arm (Black) and the dominant right arm (Grey). The data are stratified on the x -axis by 
[CONTACT_35681], and severity of contralesional paresis , as measured by [CONTACT_911473]-Meyer Assessment of motor impairment [68] (mild [43 -66], moderate [29 -42], Severe [0 -28]). In 
stroke survivors, JTHFT scores are only for the non -paretic arm (ie. Gray = non -paretic right arm of RH D 
participants; Black = non -paretic left arm of LHD participants). Note that the ‘severe’ classification in this 
plot reflects the level of impairment we target in this proposal.  
 In stroke survivors, JTHFT performance with the non -paretic arm was impacte d substantially by 
[CONTACT_911474]. Participants with the most severe paresis in 
the contralesional arm had the greatest motor deficit in the non -paretic arm. Furthermore, the 
magnitude of the deficit depended on t he side of the lesion, such that left hemisphere damage was 
associated with a 115% increase in JTFT score, while right hemisphere damage increased the time to 
complete the JTFT by 66%. These comparisons are relative to performance of the same arm (right or  
left) of age -matched control participants. However, it should be stressed that in LHD patients, the non -
dominant arm must now function as a dominant controller, indicating an even larger deficit relative to 
age-matched dominant arm performance. Thus, stro ke survivors who are forced to rely most extensively 
on the non -paretic arm for performance of ADL have the greatest deficits in coordination in the non -
paretic arm. These stroke survivors were tested, on average, 1.8 years (±0.3 SE) after stroke, which 
suggests that these deficits do not spontaneously improve over time. To provide a reference, imagine 
using only your non -dominant arm to carry out all your activities of daily living, such as preparing food, 
dressing including buttoning, putting on socks, an d shoes, etc. This would be somewhat frustrating. Now 
imagine that your non -dominant arm has become 115% slower and less coordinated than it was -the 
case for our severely impaired LHD patients. RHD patients get to use the previously dominant arm, but 
with a 66% decrement in function. Overall, these impairments are substantially functionally limiting.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1280314] been 
documented as early as 1967 [42], more recent research has shown that these deficits are functionally 
limiting and that they persist throughout the chronic phase of st roke [6 -9, 11, 17, 19 -22, 29, 31, 33, 43 -
51]. In fact, studies of non -paretic arm function in chronic stroke patients have reported performance 
deficiencies on a number of clinical tests, including the Purdue Pegboard Test [52], the Jebsen -Taylor 
Hand Func tion Test [8], and a variety of tests that directly assess or simulate activities of daily living [11, 
53, 54]. Furthermore, significant deficits in movement coordination and accuracy have been shown 
through studies that use motion analysis [7 -9, 17, 28 -30, 33, 43, 46, 48, 55 -62]. Winstein’s laboratory 
published some of the earliest research characterizing the hemisphere specificity of ipsilesional 
movement deficits in stroke [50, 59] while in the previous grant cycle, Sainburg systematically detailed 
the h emisphere specificity, neural foundations, and functional implications of non -paretic arm motor 
deficits [9, 17, 28 -30, 32, 33, 43, 60]. Together, our findings have demonstrated that stroke -related non -
paretic arm motor deficits result from a loss of the c ontributions of the ipsilateral hemisphere to motor 
control, and that right - and left -hemisphere damage lead to deficits in different aspects of motor control 
[9, 29, 36, 59, 63]. Most relevant to the current proposal is the finding that hemisphere specifi c motor 
deficits in the non -paretic arm produce deficits in functional performance [8]. Our findings have 
demonstrated that stroke -related non -paretic arm motor deficits result from a loss of the contributions 
of the ipsilateral hemisphere to motor control , and that right - and left -hemisphere damage lead to 
deficits in different aspects of motor control [9, 29, 36, 59, 63]. Most relevant to the current proposal is 
the finding that hemisphere specific motor deficits in the non -paretic arm produce def icits in  functional 
performance.

7.0 Study Design and Procedures  
 
7.1 Study Design  
 
• Two 20-40-minute components comprise each session, one consists of virtual reality (VR) 
‘games’ that separately target right - and left -hemisphere specific motor deficits, and the next 
component consists of dexterity training. The order of these sessions will be cou nterbalanced 
between subjects.  
• The VR component is designed to focus on specific aspects of control that we have previously 
shown to be deficient in the non -paretic arm of right or left hemisphere damaged stroke 
patients. For the first 20-[ADDRESS_1280319], which focuses on predictive aspects of trajectory control, while 
RHD patien ts will play tracing games that focus on feedback mediated control.  
• We then follow this with [ADDRESS_1280320] engage in mild resistive exercises, using theraputty and theraband, 
elastic substances designed for resistive exercises of the hand  and arm, respectively. After 6 
minutes of preparation, all participants will engage in a series of 6 tasks. The order that the tasks 
are presented will be randomized between sessions for each participant. Each task will be 
practiced for 4 minutes. The num ber of items successfully completed in each task will be 
counted and recorded as a ‘target’ to beat in the next session, providing motivation for 
improvem ent within and between sessions . While most of these tasks are self -explanatory, the 
Page 12 of 26 (V.04/27/201 7)  cup-stacking task  uses [ADDRESS_1280321] no overlap with the components of the JTHFT.  
• While our pi[INVESTIGATOR_911454], it is beyond the 
scope of this proposal to assess the relative efficacy of its individual components. H owever, in 
aim 2, we will determine whether this package of training specifically ameliorated hemisphere -
specific movement deficits in RHD and LHD patients. If so, this would suggest that the 
hemisphere -specificity of the VR training may be important in re ducing such deficits.  
Comparison Intervention:   
• Our comparison intervention is designed to match our experimental intervention in duration 
and frequency (3X/week for 1 hour over 5 weeks), but using conventional therapeutic activities, 
based on the best -practices framework for arm recovery post stroke that was developed by [CONTACT_911481] -stroke rehabilitation [3]. This group, 
which included occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], physiatrists, neurologists , and 
scientists, developed an algorithm for a clinical decision tree which was implemented through a 
smartphone app, ViaTherapy. In short, recommended therapi[INVESTIGATOR_911455], take into account chronicity, potentia l for reported shoulder pain, and are 
filtered by [CONTACT_3252] -morbidities such as neglect, cognitive impairment, aphasia, and apraxia.  
• To avoid any confounds with the experimental intervention, we exclude any interventions 
requiring technology that might not be fo und in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_911456] -based rehabilitation clinic, 
such as robotic rehabilitation, functional electric stimulation, or computer based interfaces. For 
a typi[INVESTIGATOR_911457] (> [ADDRESS_1280322] gravity and partially extend the elbow without gravity, but 
cannot initiate finger and thumb extension three times within a minute), recommendations 
include 1) Proximal strength training, 2) Motor imagery and mental pra ctice, 3) Mirror Therapy, 
using a midsagittal mirror reflecting the non -paretic arm, while the patient attempts bilateral 
symmetrical forward reaching, and 4) Task specific training, involving reaching toward 
meaningful objects, with manual assistance as r equired. The first ten minutes of the 60 -minute 
session will begin with passive range of motion, gentle stretching, and proximal weight bearing, 
which will help relax spasticity (if present) and prepare the proximal muscles for activity. This 
will be follo wed by [CONTACT_911482] 3 recommended therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (10 minutes each), and then will 
be followed by 30 minutes of active assisted task -specific reach training. While the specific 
recommendations may vary slightly based on the decision algorithm, all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_911458] 10 minutes of proximal preparation, and all sessions will end with 30 minutes of assisted 
task-specific reaching of the paretic arm in various directions.  
• This study is after the standard care of tr eatment has been finished or in addition t o standard 
care of treatment, not in  place of standard care.  
 
7.2 Study P rocedures  
 
7.2.1 Visit 1 (pre -test 1) : 
 
Visit 1 (pre -test/screening): subjects  will be consented, and then tested using standardized tests 
including the primary and secondary measures. In addition, the Edinburgh handedness 
inventory, Confidence in Arm and Hand Movement (CAHM), Multidimensional Scale of 
Perceived Social Support , NIH stroke scale, tests for comorbidities including testing of grip 
strength, v isual neglect,  and apraxia . If they meet criteria for the study, they will be randomly 
assigned to either the intervention or comparison condition.  Tests may be videotaped for 
scoring and standardization purposes . Participant’s  names will not be associated with the 
videotapes . A data safety monitoring board will monitor the study for safety and to minimize 
risk.

7.2.3 Visit 3 -17:  
Intervention condition:  Two 20-40-minute components comprise each session, one cons ists of virtual 
reality (VR) ‘games’ that separately target right - and left -hemisphere specific motor deficits, and the 
next component consists of dexterity training. The order of these sessions will be counterbalanced 
between subjects. The VR component is  designed to focus on specific aspects of control that we have 
previously shown to be deficient in the non -paretic arm of right or left hemisphere damaged stroke 
patients. For the first 20-[ADDRESS_1280324] engage in mild resistive exercises, using 
theraputty and theraband, elastic substances designed for resistive exercises of the hand and arm, 
respectively. After 6 minutes of preparati on, all participants will engage in a series of 6 tasks. The order 
that the tasks are presented will be randomized between sessions for each participant. Each task will be 
practiced for 4 minutes. The number of items successfully completed in each task wil l be counted and 
recorded as a ‘target’ to beat in the next session, providing motivation for improvement within and 
between sessions. These tasks are shown in the flow chart in Figure 5. While most are self -explanatory, 
the cup -stacking task uses [ADDRESS_1280325] that the hemisphere -specificity of the VR training may be important in reducing such 
deficits.  
 
Comparison  (sham)  Intervention:  Our comparison intervention is designed to match our experimental 
intervention in duration and frequency (3X/week for 1 hour over 5 weeks), but using conventional 
therapeutic activities, based on the best -practices f ramework for arm recovery post stroke that was 
developed by [CONTACT_911483] -stroke rehabilitation [3]. This 
group, which included occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], physiatrists, neurologists, and 
scientists, developed an algorithm for a clinical decision tree which was implemented through a 
smartphone app, ViaTherapy. In short, recommended therapi[INVESTIGATOR_911455], take into account chronicity, potential for rep orted shoulder pain, and are filtered 
by [CONTACT_3252] -morbidities such as neglect, cognitive impairment, aphasia, and apraxia. To avoid any confounds 
with the experimental intervention, we exclude any interventions requiring technology that might not 
be found in a t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_911456] -based rehabilitation clinic, such as robotic rehabilitation, functional 
electric stimulation, or computer based interfaces. For a typi[INVESTIGATOR_911457] (> [ADDRESS_1280326] gravity and 
partially extend the elbow without gravity, but cannot initiate finger and thumb extension three times 
within a minute), recommendations include 1) Proximal strength training, 2) Motor imagery and mental

attempts bilateral symmetrical forward reaching, and 4) Task specific training, involving reaching toward 
meaningful objects, with manual assistance as required. T he first ten minutes of the 60 -minute session 
will begin with passive range of motion, gentle stretching, and proximal weight bearing, which will help 
relax spasticity (if present) and prepare the proximal muscles for activity. This will be followed by [CONTACT_911484] 3 recommended therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (10 minutes each), and then will be followed by 30 minutes of active 
assisted task -specific reach training. While the specific recommendations may vary slightly based on the 
decision algorithm, all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_911459] 10 minutes of proximal preparation, and all sessions will 
end with 30 minutes of assisted task -specific reaching of the paretic arm in various directions.  
 
Note: sessions may be videotaped for standardization purposes.  
 
7.2.4 Visit 18 : Post test  
Visit will include the same assessments as visit 1  
 
7.2.5 Visit 19:  Post test 2 (short term retention)  
Visits will include the same assessments as visit 1, 2 weeks following completion of training sessions  
 
7.2.6 Visit 20:  Post  test 3 (long term retention)  
Visits will include the same assessments as visit [ADDRESS_1280327]  (pre and post)  sessi ons, for a total of [ADDRESS_1280328] 20 subjects a year c omplete the research procedures, for a total of 120 
participants.  
 
8.2 Sample size determination  
Based on our primary outcome measures (Barthel, FIM -motor, Abilhand, UEFM, JTHFT) the proposed 
sample size of 60 participants per group provides adequate power (>=0.80) to assess each prediction 
when the effect size (Cohen's f) is 0.35 or greater. Cohen su ggested that researchers consider f=0.[ADDRESS_1280329], f=0.[ADDRESS_1280330], and f=0.[ADDRESS_1280331]. To determine sample size, we used a 
power analysis program, SOLO [81], and computer simulation. SOLO permitted us to vary effect sizes 
and de termine the test's power for a fixed group size. The simulation permitted us to use our pi[INVESTIGATOR_911460]; fit a model with fixed effects for group, test, and group by [CONTACT_911485]; conduct tests to include those for the l inear contrasts; and record the p -value and 
associated effect size. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_911461], and included right - and left -hemisphere -damaged 
participants. We will go through the major measures and analyses for each aim below. We have 
collected pi[INVESTIGATOR_49452] 15 participants, using a cross -over design, for Aims 1 and 2, which provide 
preliminary support for our predictions.  
 
Page 15 of 26 (V.04/27/201 7)  8.3 Statistical methods  
To a ssess our intervention, we will fit linear mixed models (LMMs) with single -degr ee-of-freedom linear 
contrasts [80] to determine if the data support our predictions (see next section). We will use a linear 
mixed model with main effects for group (experiment al, control) and time (Test) and the group by [CONTACT_911486] a more flexible approach to the typi[INVESTIGATOR_911462] (ANOVA) model 
for a randomized pretest -posttest design. Specifically, LMMs will permit us to account for participant  
matching with a random cluster effect; and they permit each participant to have her or his initial value 
(random intercept) and different change patterns across the tests (random coefficients for an underlying 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_911463]). LMMs allow us to use c ovariates to adjust for any potential confounders. Finally, 
these models can tolerate missing data on the response, which is not true of the standard ANOVA -based 
model.  
 
Lesion Reconstruction Methods: Winstein’s laboratory personnel will reconstruct stroke  lesions from the  
research grade MRI scans. They will superimpose lesions on each axial slice to identify common areas of 
lesion  overlap associated with damage to the right or left hemisphere and to assess comparability of 
intrahemispheric  lesion location in our two tracks. This grant will not specifically examine 
intrahemispheric lesion location, but  these data will provide pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] d ata for future studies. To calculate 
the CST lesion load, we will use the tractography  based atlas of human brain connections from the 
natbrain lab [72]. We will use the MRIcron descriptive tool for  the calculation of the CST -lesion overlap 
volume. The bin ary lesion mask fi le will be overlaid onto either the left  or right binary template CST 
atlas, and the percentage of CST which overlaps with the lesion is calculated.  
9.0 Confidentiality , Privacy  and Data Management  
9.1 Confidentiality  
 
9.1.1 Identifiers associated wit h data and/or specimens  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Use of Codes, Master List  
   Each site will have a code linked to subject’s identifiable information in a locked  
document. The list will not be shared between sites or with members that are not part of the 
research group.  
 
9.1.2 Storage of Data and/or Specimens  
Data will be kept electronically on password -protected  computers and backed up on external 
hard -drives locked in filing cabinets in room C2852 at the COM  or Carolee Winstein’s Laboratory 
at USC . Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_911464], also locked in room  C2852 at the COM  or

9.1.3 Access to Data and/or Specimens  
Electronic key card access is required to enter room C2852. A list of approved personnel is kept 
by [CONTACT_911487].  USC also has locks on the door and a list of approved personnel.  
 
9.1.4 Transferring Data a nd/or Specimens  
De-identified data will be collected at both sites (PSU, USC) and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data 
Capture) at Penn State. REDCap  is a secure web application designed to support data capture for research studies, 
providing user -friendly web -based case report forms, real -time data entry validation (e.g. for data types and range 
checks), audit trails and a de -identified data export me chanism to common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S -
Plus). The system was developed by a multi -institutional consortium which includes The Pennsylvania State University 
and was initiated at Vanderbilt University. The database is hosted at the Pen n State Hershey Medical Center and College 
of Medicine data center, which will be used as a central location for data processing and management. REDCap data 
collection projects rely on a thorough study -specific data dictionary defined in an iterative self -documenting process by 
[CONTACT_59881]. This iterative development and testing process results in a well -planned data 
Page 16 of 26 (V.04/27/201 7)  collection strategy for individual studies. REDCap is flexible enough to be used for a variety of types of research and 
provides an intuitive user interface for database design and data entry. Deidentified data can be sent via password 
protected files. Videotapes will be shared for standardization and scoring purposes. They will be shared on a secure 
server, hosted by [CONTACT_73726]. https://uscbknpt.sharepoint.com/sites/IPSI/default.aspx  
There is a pa ssword protected account for PSU members and a separate account for USC members. A list is available 
documenting team members that have access to the site.  Participants are coded with a label and names are not used, 
however their faces are visible in the v ideotapes.

11.0 Risks  
 
Loss of confidentiality is a risk for data analysis and/or chart review research. The techniques employed in this 
study are non -threatening, non -invasive, and pose no risk beyond that experienced during normal daily 
activities. In general, subjects may exp erience fatigue or discomfort due to the two [ADDRESS_1280333] 
certain kinds of metal in your body (for example, a heart pacemaker, a metal plate, certain types of heart valves 
or brain aneur ysm clips).  Someone will ask them  questions about this before they  have the MRI. Having a MRI 
may mean some added discomf ort to the participant . In particular, they  may be uncomfortable inside the MRI 
scanner if they  do not like to be in closed spaces (“claustrophobia”). They  may also be bothered by [CONTACT_911488]. Temporary hearing loss has been rep orted from  the loud noise. This is why they  
Page 17 of 26 (V.04/27/201 7)  will be asked to wear ear plugs. During the procedure, they  will be able to talk with the MRI sta ff through a speaker 
system. They  can tell them to stop the scan at any time.  
 
It is possible that the study procedu res (brain MRI scan)  could detect a possible unknown medical problem that is 
unrelated to the purpose of this study.  If the research procedures uncover finding s that may be important for the 
participant to know about, such as the possibility of a previous ly unknown medical condition, a member o f the 
study team may contact [CONTACT_911489]. These findings may require additional 
testing or treatment.  The cost of any additional tests o r related treatment will be their  respons ibility.  
12.[ADDRESS_1280334] benefit to the research subjects. However, they may increase non -paretic 
arm function. There is minimal risk to the study participants , so the risk/benefit ratio is quite favorable.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_1280335] Stipend (Compensation ) and/or Travel Reimbursements  
Subjects will be paid $50 per visit. Additional travel reimbursement will be given if traveling mor e than 25 miles 
from study site, up to $50 per visit.

16.2 Feasibility of recruiting the required number of subjects  
Previous experience indicates that we can recruit a minimum of 20 eligible participants each year, from 
each site. This, in combination with the current databases at each site, makes the recruitment goal of 30 
participants per year (15 per site), over the four -year course of recruitment (120 total), realistic . The 
HMC database has every stroke patient that is a patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], which is over 100 per month. 
However, we hav e selective criteria, therefore we aim to recruit less than 5% of them.

18.4  Reporting of Adverse Events and New Information  
 
We appreciate the importance of accurately monitoring patient ac crual and data collection as well as 
the possibility of the occurrence of any serious adverse event (expected and unexpected). To deal with 
these issues  we have included a data and safety monitoring board (DSMB ), which  consists of a Chair and 
3 members all  external to the study and including two medical monitors, one from each of the two sites. 
The DSMB will be  established to monitor the well -being of the study participants, ensure scientific 
integrity of the study, and  assure  timely patient accrual. See the Table (section 3.3 of grant, uploaded) . 
The site IRB  will review and  approve all study protocols, require annual updates of the study and 
monitor for adverse events. The DSMB will  assist the IRB’s and the study perso nnel in the careful 
monitoring of the risk / benefit ratio of the implementation  of this study. The DSMB will meet regularly 
(determined by [CONTACT_21003]) to ensure the safety of the participants  during the course of the study and the 
validity and integrity of  the data. They will monitor patient safety,  recruitment, adherence to inclusion 
and exclusion criteria, retention, deviations from assigned treatments, quality  control, and interim 
analyses of primary and main secondary outcomes as well as the occurrence of adverse  events and 
other indicators of patient safety. All adverse events and participant drop outs will be reported to the  
PIs immediately so the case can be examined in detail with the on -site Medical Monitor to determine 
the reason  for drop out and/o r circumstances behind the adverse event. Shou ld any adverse events 
deemed to increase  risks to participants be identified, the study will stop immediately and an 
investigation will be conducted. The  local Medical Monitor at each site (who is not part of t he 
investigative team ) will be responsible for reviewing the  activities of the clinical trial including the 
incidence and type of adverse events. The Medical Monitor at each site  will consult with the local Site PI 
(Sainburg, Hershey ; Winstein, USC ) relati ve to complications and any  questions regarding inclusion, and 
progression through the protocol. All  serious adverse events will be reported  immediately to the 
Medical Monitor, as well as the IRB, and DSMB.  
 
The investigative team has established definitions for adverse events, criteria for causally related and an 
adverse  event protocol. These definitions and protocols will be used for reporting all adverse events 
from each site for  this study. Any adverse events from either of the two sites will be recorded and 
monitored as required by [CONTACT_911492] (DSMB). A composite  report will be generated by [CONTACT_911493] [ADDRESS_1280339], and each site PI. All  serious 
events will be reported to each site IRB within five days. A cumulative adverse event -reporting table will  
be completed for annual continuing review.  
 
 
18.5  Audit and Monitoring Plans  
 
The PIs and the site study coordinators will monitor ongoing data collection, perform quality checks on 
the actual  participant files for recording accuracy, and monitor data entry into Redcap for accuracy, 
including random  checks throughout the duration of the study.

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Disease Background    
 
Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathy (IIM) or myositis is a heterogeneous group of disorders with an 
autoimmune pathogenesis characterized by [CONTACT_370686]. Many 
patients with IIM [primarily polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositi s (DM)] develop interstitial lung 
disease (ILD), a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. The prevalence of ILD 
varies in myositis, but in certain subsets (e.g. the antisynthetase syndrome), ILD can occur in up to 
80-90% of patients an d be the first and most prominent feature. ILD is the most common cause of 
mortality and morbidity in myositis. There  are currently no approved treatments for myositis -
associated ILD (Myositis -ILD) or anti -synthetase syndrome associated ILD (Syn -ILD). A T cell 
mediated pathogenesis has been posited for Myositis -ILD with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 
showing activated T cells1. There is strong biological plausibility for considering ABT in Myositis -
ILD. In a mouse model of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), characterized by [CONTACT_93247] T cells in 
the lung parenchyma (similar to Myositis -ILD), blockade of T cell co -stimulation by [CONTACT_485] -4 Ig 
(CD28/B7 antagonist) ameliorated lung inflammation2. Moreover, treatment with CTLA -4 Ig led to 
a significant decrease in lung damage and less inflammatory cells in the BAL fluid as well as a 
diminished CD4/CD8 T cell ratio 3. CTLA -4 Ig ligands are present in autoinvasive CD8+ T cells in 
biopsies of PM -scleroderma patients4. CTLA -[ADDRESS_463796] to 
examine the efficacy and safety of ABT as a potentially important new therapeutic advance for Syn -
ILD.  
 
1.2 Abatacept  Background  and Rationale in IIM  
 
ABT not only down -regulated T cells, thereby [CONTACT_370687], but also decreased the antigen -presenting capability of myocytes, inhibited macrophages 
and led to decreased  pro -inflammatory cytokines (specifically  IL-6, TNF alpha, and others), all of 
which are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of myositis6. Moreover, CD80 and CD86 are 
expressed in antigen -presenting B lymphocytes and ABT decreases B lymphocyte expression, of 
importance in the pathogenesis of myositis and Myositis -ILD given the beneficial effects of 
rituximab for Myositis -ILD 7-9. Anti -T cell therapy (e.g. tacrolimus and cyclosporine) has been 
shown by [CONTACT_370688] -
ILD especially in those with the antisynthetase syndrome10-15. However, its use is lim ited by 
[CONTACT_370689],  patient intolerance and the need for complex monitoring. Other case reports 
suggest that ABT has efficacy in treating the muscle and skin features of refractory PM and DM16-
19, and the pathogenesis of Myositis -ILD is similar to tha t of muscle disease in myositis  except that 
the target of inflammation and subsequent damage is different. There is encouraging evidence of 
the amelioration of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) associated ILD using ABT20 as well as the lack of 
ILD worsening  when RA is treat ed with ABT, a somewhat unique effect not shared with other 
biologics currently FDA -approved for RA. Given the rarity, heterogeneity and complexity of 
myositis and Myositis -ILD, any clinical study or trial is very difficult to perform and should only 
be done  in specialized centers seeing such patients. Moreover, it i s essential for clinical trials  that 
myositis and ILD outcome measures be appropriately assessed.

1.2.1 Abatacept  
 
ABT is a soluble fusion protein that consists of the extracellular  domain of human cytotoxic T -
lymphocyte -associated antigen 4 (CTLA -4) linked to the  modified Fc (hinge, CH2, and CH3 
domains) portion of human immunoglobulin G1  (IgG1). It is produced by [CONTACT_370690] a mammalian cell  expression system. The apparent molecular weight of ABT is 92 
kilodaltons. It is supplied as a sterile, white, preservative -free, lyophilized powder for parenteral 
administration. Following reconstitution with 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, U SP, the 
solution of ABT is clear, colorless to pale yellow, with a pH range of 7.0 to 8.0. Each single -use 
vial of ORENCIA provides 250 mg ABT, 500 mg maltose, 17.2 mg monobasic sodium phosphate, 
and 14.6 mg sodium chloride for administration. The efficacy  and safety of ABT was assessed in 
five randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled studies in patients ≥ age 18 with active RA 
diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria.

ABT as a potentially important new therapeutic advance for Syn -ILD.  
 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Primary   
 
The primary objective is t o evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ABT (125 mg SQ 
weekly) and standard of care ( SOC ) vs. SOC in patients with Syn -ILD in a multi -center, double -
blind, randomized placebo -controlled proof of concept clinical trial.  
Hypothesis:  ABT will be efficacious, safe and tolerable in Syn -ILD patients.  
 
 
  
6 
  
 
2.2 Secondary   
 
The secondary objectives include assessing: (a) radiographic improvement, (b) improvement in 
other PFT variables like FEV1 a nd DLCO, (c) time to improve  in composite outcome for ILD by 
[CONTACT_141374], (d) death/transplant, (d) patient -reported outcomes of dyspnea, (c) rapi[INVESTIGATOR_370660], (d) steroid -sparing effect of ABT, (e) durability of response, and 
(f) assessment of drug effect on oth er muscle or skin manifestations using standard myositis 
response criteria . 
 
2.3 Exploratory  
 
We plan to identify predictors of treatment response to ABT in Syn -ILD which will include  the 
concomitant blood repository along with collection of clinical and demographic data collected 
during the course of the trial to study clinical, pathologic and immunologic factors associated with 
a response or lack of response to the study drug. This objective will be achieved in  the future using  
a separate study after the completion of the clinical trial, but  the samples will be collected as part 
of the current tri al.  
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
  
3.1 Description of the Study  
 
This is a proof of concept  study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ABT in Syn -ILD 
in a multi -center randomized, placebo -controlled 6 -month (24 -week) pi[INVESTIGATOR_370661] a [ADDRESS_463798] enrollment to be 
completed within 15 months. A 1:1 randomization scheme for active drug: placebo  as a weekly SQ 
injection with their SOC for [ADDRESS_463799] active  ILD associated with anti -synthetase syndromes (a subset of myositis) that 
are being given SOC treatment for ILD. Patients could have refractory disease with flare up or new 
onset disease. Patient may or may not have active myositis (PM/DM).  We anticipate the continued 
participation of all subjects in open label extension phase.  
 
Open label phase: At the end of the active study period (week 24 closing visit), patients in either 
arm can enroll into the optional open -label phase of 24 -week ABT therapy (125 mg SQ injection 
weekly).  
 
  
[ADDRESS_463800] of Care (SOC): The SOC of patients with Syn -ILD includes steroids OR 
another IS agent OR a combination of steroid and another IS agent. Thus, we will 
allow steroids and/or only 1 additional IS agent. Additional IS agent can be either 
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine (AZA) , but not both . Patients on 
steroids alone can be enrolled without additional IS agent. Maximum dose allowed 
for MMF is 3 gms/day and for AZA is 200 mg/day. Patient should be on stable dose 
of MMF or AZA for 4 weeks and/o r stable dose of steroids [ADDRESS_463801] ABT/placebo dosing. Overall goal is to enroll patients 
into the trial as soon as the SOC drug has achieved stable dosing. Prednisone taper 
will be allowed at maximum dose of 6 0 mg at baseline (Visit 1), at which time a 
forced prednisone taper will commence as outlined below. Dose of concomitant 
medication cannot change throughout the phase I of the trial (24 weeks) unless 
safety/toxicity issues supervene.  
 
No other concomitant IS agent is allowed (e.g. IVIG, plasmapharesis, rituximab, methotrexate, 
tacrolimus, cyclosporine, other biologics . Hydroxychloroquine  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_370662] a stable dose for 4 weeks prior to trial entry .  
 
Forced steroid taper (Prednisone or other steroid in prednisone equivalent doses) in subject 
on a stable dose of steroid 2 weeks prior to visit 1.  
a. Steroid Tapering:  May begin within or at 1 week after beginning study drug. Goal is to 
taper steroid to 5 mg or lower dose within 8 weeks. Recommended daily prednisone 
taper (or other forms of steroid in equivalent doses)  
i. 60 mg decreased to 40 mg after 1 week  
ii. 40 mg decreased to 30 mg after 1 week  
iii. 30 mg decreased to 20 mg after 1 week  
iv. 20 mg decreased to 15 mg after 1 week  
v. 15 mg decreased to 10 mg after 1 week  
vi. 10 mg decreased to 7.5 mg after 1 week  
vii. 7.5 mg decreased  to 5 mg after 1 week  
viii. Further decrease as  per treating physician.  
b. Steroid at Entry:  Maximum steroid dose allowed at study entry is ≤ 60 mg/day 
prednisone (or other forms of steroid in equivalent doses). If on a lower dose then the 
tapering scheme noted above should be employed based on the entry dose. Patients not 
on steroids are allowed  in the study  and are not allowed to start new steroids unless 
there is a disease flare.  
c. Steroid Dosing During Flare:  If in the clinical site investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_370663] (or other forms of steroid in equivalent doses) then the smallest reasonable 
increase should be considered ( maximum increase of prednisone equivalent of 20 
mg/day is allowed). After the increase, subjects should resume the prednisone taper 
noted above.  
 
Concomitant medications will remain unchanged throughout Phase I, except changes made per the 
rescue medication protocol. During the open label Phase II, concomitant medications adjustments 
are permitted even if the subject has not met the definition of wo rsening.  
 
  
8 
 Active ILD:  Defined as (a) new onset of ILD (within 3 months of ILD diagnosis) or (b) worsening 
ILD as per the treating physician assessment necessitating a treatment change within last 3 months 
(with documented worsening of at least 2 of the 3 parameters: patient’s report of worsening 
dyspnea, worsening in severity of ground glass opacities (GGO), reticulation or honeycombing or 
fibrosis on chest HRCT or a decline in the FVC% > 10% within last 6 months.)  
 
Active Study Drug:  A weekly dose of 125 mg SQ will be used in this 24 -week trial and open 
label phase of 24 weeks.   
  
Specimens (serum, cells etc.) collected and stored in a biospecimen repository at each study visit 
for future  experimental  studies . The repository will be located at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], 
Division of Rheumatology. We will consider submission of ancillary proposal s to conduct 
experiments designed to further elucidate biomarkers and basic physiologic and cellular 
mechanisms of disease resulting from Abatacept  therapy.  
 
Strategies for (1) allowing “ rescue ” therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265] (2) insuring that the original randomization 
treatment scheme is not revealed are discussed in Sectio n 4.4.   
 
Future Tests:  
The Specimen Repository samples will be used in the future for two types of research:  
1) immunologic and 2) genetic.  
 
 Immunology Research     
Tests to be performed on the stored blood include  the following: RNA -Seq analysis, 
autoantibody testing for the presence of myositis associated autoantibodies, serum 
interferon ( IFN)-inducible chemokines, Th1, Th2, Th17, innate, and regulatory cytokines at 
baseline and later time points in this clinical trial to identify a biomarker signature 
[CONTACT_370715] .  These immunology tests will be conducted in a 
research laboratory,  not a public certified laboratory.  Therefore, subjects will not be 
informed of these results.   
 
Genetic Research    
Genetic analysis.  While the exact nature of the genetic research studies is  not fully known, they 
may involve identifying genes that can: 1) increase the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_370664] , 2) modify the severity of autoimmune disease, or 3) control components of the 
immune system (immunogenetic studies).  
 
3.[ADDRESS_463802] of the RA trials to date. For a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], proof of concept study we will not employ a dose 
escalation design.  
 
3.3 Outcome Measures  
The outcome measures used in this trial will include:  
▪ Pulmonary Function Test - change in FVC%, FEV1%, DLCO%  
▪ University of [LOCATION_004] San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD SOBQ)  
  
9 
 ▪ Qualitative changes in HRCT  
▪ Six minute  walk distance (6MWD)  
▪ Mean  daily step count on Fitbit One®.  
 
The Myositis Clinical Core Set Measures (CSM) used in this trial are those agreed upon by 
[CONTACT_370691]:  
 
▪ The MMT -8 (Manual muscle testing)  
▪ Patient global VAS recorded on a 10cm scale  
▪ MD global VAS recorded on a 10cm scale  
▪ HAQ disability index  
▪ At least one of the muscle enzymes (CK, aspartate aminotransferase ( AST), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH))   
▪ Global extramuscular disease activity (a composite of constitutional, cutaneous, skeletal, 
gastrointestinal, pulmonary and cardiac activity) score recorded on a 10  cm VAS scale on 
the Myositis Disease Activity Assessment Tool (MDAAT)  
 
3.3.1  Primary Outcome Measures  
 
The primary outcome criteria for efficacy will be the FVC% change from  the baseline  visit to 
week 24 between the 2 treatment arms (SOC/placebo vs. SOC/ABT).  An intention to treat 
analy sis will be used. Ranked ANCOVA will be used  with average standardized rank change in 
the predicted FVC% as the outcome measure and the standardized rank baseline as a covariate. 
Primary outcome criteria for safety and tolerability will be adverse event s (routine adverse events 
or tolerability issues and serious adverse event ) between the 2 treatment arms (SOC/placebo vs. 
SOC/ABT). Chi -square (or Fischer exact test) and t -test (or Mann -Whitney) will be used based on 
data variable and distribution.   
 
3.3.2  Secondary Outcome Measures  
 
(SOC/placebo vs. SOC/ABT) for Syn -ILD:  
a. Time to progression free survival where progression is defined as  the first occurrence of 
any of the following: death or lung transplant or FVC ≥10% decline or FVC ≥5% decline 
with DLCO ≥15% decline.  
b. Change in dyspnea, as measured by [CONTACT_370692] (UCSD SOBQ) (range 0 -120, higher score is worsening dyspnea).  
c. Time to improvement in FVC% by ≥10%.  
d. Rates of death or requiring lung transplant.  
e. Other individual PFT variables (FEV1%, DLCO%)  
f. Qualitative changes in HRCT chest over [ADDRESS_463803] (calculated using prednisone dose equivalents)  
h. Frequency of treatment failures: a) patient meeting worsening criteria or withdrawal due to 
worsening ILD anytime during the trial or b) FVC% worsening by 10% at 6 months, c) 
death or transplant within 6 months.  
i. Quantita tive changes in mean Six minute  walk distance (6MWD)  
  
10 
 j. Quantitative changes in mean daily step count on Fitbit One®.  
 
Secondary outcome criteria for myositis:  Myositis response will be evaluated among patients 
with concomitant active myositis. Active myositis is defined based on MDAAT at baseline muscle 
or cutaneous skin disease activity of ≥ 3 on 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS).  
 
New myositis response criteria (table 1) and International Myositis Assessment & Clinical Studies 
Group (IMACS) definition of improvement (DOI) (given below) will be used to assess myositis 
response in drug + SOC vs. placebo + SOC.

3.3.3  Safety Outcome Measures  
Safety is being assessed in one of the secondary endpoints listed above in Section 3.3.2. We will 
statistically compare the frequency of the following adverse events between the treatment and 
placebo arms .  
 
Similarly, we will analyze the proportion of serious adverse events between the treatment and 
placebo arms. In addition, the number and percent of patients with AEs during the treatment period 
will be summarized.  
 
3.4      End of Study  
 
As described above, the end of the study (closing visit) is week 24  for Phase I . An optional open 
label phase (Phase II) with [ADDRESS_463804] been added to assess durability of ABT  response and safety. This follow -up phase will 
assess durability, long term response and safety in patients who were in the active treatment arm 
while allowing the placebo arm to receive active study drug.

sarcoidosis, etc.  
16. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsory detained.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_463812] all patients complete the remaining study visits as detailed in the Study Schema 
(Appendix A) . 
 
If the patient decides to prematurely discontinue study treatment (“refuses treatment”), he/she 
should be asked if he/she can still be contact[CONTACT_83529]. The outcome of that 
discussion should be documented in both the medical records and in  the CRF. A complete final 
evaluation at the time of the patient’s withdrawal should be made with an explanation of why the 
patient is withdrawing from the study.  
 
Before categorizing a patient as lost to follow -up, the investigator must attempt to contact [CONTACT_370694] a responsible relative by [CONTACT_370695]  (AEs) occurred, follow -up of any ongoing AE and to establish as completely as 
possible the reason for the withdrawal.  
 
When applicable, patients should be informed of circumstances under which their participation 
may be terminated by [CONTACT_370696]’s consent. The investigator may 
withdraw patients from the study in the event of intercurrent illness, a dverse events, treatment 
failure, lack of compliance with the study and/or study procedures (e.g., dosing instructions, study 
visits), or any reason where it is felt by [CONTACT_370697] t he study. The reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented and explained to 
the patient.  
If the reason for removal of a patient from the study is an adverse event, the specific event will be 
recorded in the study database . There should be an attempt to follow the patient until the event has 
resolved or stabilized.  
 
An excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study non -interpretable; therefore, unnecessary 
withdrawal of patients should be avoided. Should a patient decide to withdraw, all efforts will be 
made to complete and report the observations prior to withdra wal as thoroughly as possible.

4.5 Definition of Worsening Criteria  
 
4.5.1  Myositis Worsening Criteria  
If any one of the criteria is met after 8 weeks of therapy :  
a. Physician global worsening of ≥ 2 cm on the 10 cm VAS and/or worsening of the manual 
muscle testing by ≥ 20%, or  
b. Global extra muscular organ disease activity worsening by ≥ 2 cm on a 10 cm VAS on 
MDAAT, or  
c. 3 of 6 CSM worse by ≥ 30%.  
 
 
 
4.5.2  ILD Worsening Criteria   
If any one of the criteria is met after 8 weeks of therapy:  
a. FVC% decline >= 30% from baseline PFT  
b. HRCT chest suggesting severe worsening in the ILD as compared to baseline 
(clinician/radiologist interpretation  
c. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_370667] O2 requirement related 
to worsening ILD  
d. Severe worsening in clinical dyspnea due to ILD as determined by [CONTACT_370698]. Note that meeting “worsening criteria” doesn’t automatically mean 
administration of rescue therapy. Rescue therapy is given if patient meeting worsening 
criter ia AND treating physician believe clinical disease warrants a change in therapy.  
 
Subjects meeting these criteria will be considered treatment failures but can continue to receive 
study drug if deemed reasonable by [CONTACT_370699]. If at any time a 
worsening in condition occurs, the subject should be seen for an u nscheduled study visit.  A subject 
irrespective of worsening or rescue medication use, can enter the open label phase (II) of the study 
at the end of the 24 week period of phase I.  
 
4.5.3  Rescue Medications  
If in the clinical site investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_370668] 
(meeting worsening criteria) that necessitate an increase in  concomitant immunosuppressive 
therapy the following guidelines should be followed:  
 
▪ The steroid dose may be increased by ≤20 mg (prednisone equivalent) daily. After 2 weeks 
of increase the forced corticosteroid taper will commence as noted above. Such patient s 
will remain on the trial protocol (on study drug) , and it will  not be considered as treatment 
failure.  
▪ Requirement of additional non -steroid IS therapy or requirement of increase of steroids 
dose > 20 mg  equivalent of prednisone  for worsening ILD as rescue therapy (after initial 8 
weeks of study drug) will be considered a treatment failure. Such patients can be continued 
on the trial protocol (on study drug) only if rescue drug include  either one of them:  MMF, 
AZA, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, IVIG, methotrexate  AND maximum of one non -steroid IS 
  
16 
 therapy is given  during the trial. Steroids can be concomitantly increased with non -IS 
agent.  
▪ Note if additional non -steroid IS therapy or increase  of steroid dose > 20 mg equivalent of 
prednisone  occurs <[ADDRESS_463813] outcome assessment.  
▪ Biological drugs, cyclophosphamide, plasmaphresis, are not allowed as rescue therapy and 
will lead to withdrawal from the trial drug/placebo protocol ( i.e stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_370669]/placebo ) 
for safety reasons . Similarly, mor e than one non -steroid IS agent is  not allowed as rescue 
therapy and will lead to withdrawal from the trial drug/placebo protocol ( i.e. stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_370670]/placebo ). But all patient s despi[INVESTIGATOR_370671]/placebo will be followed 
for at least 24 weeks for clinical evaluation . Note  withdrawal from trial drug/placebo as 
above is not considered with withdrawal from the study.  
 
For example:  If a patient is having severe worsening at 3 month s while on AZA and  the study 
drug; investigator/treating physician can give rescue steroid increase by 20 mg  prednisone  (or new 
prednisone 20 mg if patient was not on steroid) without any changes in the outcome or trial 
protocol. However, if for some reason  the investigator/treating physician need s to start MMF on 
the patient, then  the patient can continue on  the trial protocol (on study drug) as long as AZA is 
stopped (so only one non -steroid immunosuppressive drug is given concomitantly with study 
drug). Concomitant increase of steroid is OK. Such scenarios should be avoided as these patients 
will be conside red as treatment failure.  
 
Specifically related to this trial, there are several scenarios for subjects as they are followed 
through the 6 month trial:  
 
1. Subjects can withdraw from the study  drug (active drug/placebo) at any time  for various 
reasons deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_976] . They are then treated at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_370672], but should continue to be followed at the regular study time points for the duration of the 
trial for efficacy and safety data monitoring. No randomization scheme will be 
broken/reveal ed. Withdrawal from study drug doesn’t mean withdrawal from the study.  
2. If the criteria for the worsening are formally met but the subject and PI [INVESTIGATOR_370673] (as above), then the subject 
will remain on the trial protocol (study drug). No randomization s cheme will be 
broken/revealed.  
3. If criteria for the worsening is formally met and the subject and/or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_370674] “escape” 
therapy other than allowable rescue agents is necessary, then the subject will be treated at the 
discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_370675] ( withdrawal from study drug), but should continue to 
be followed at the regular study time points for the duration of the trial for efficacy and safety 
data monitoring. No randomization scheme will be broken/revealed.  Withdrawal from study 
drug doesn’t mean withdrawal from  the study.  
 
Refer to Appendix C for rescue medication diagram.  
 
5.0 STUDY MEDICATION  
 
5.1 Abatacept  
 
ABT is a fully human soluble fusion protein of the extracellular domain of cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
  
17 
 antigen 4 (CTLA -4) linked to a modified Fc portion of human IgG1, a physiological antagonist of 
the T cell co -stimulatory molecule CD28 by [CONTACT_106820]80/CD86 with higher affinity than 
CD28. By [CONTACT_370700], ABT inhibits T cells as a costimulatory signal i s needed for full T cell 
activation. Activated T lymphocytes are implicated in the pathogenesis of My -ILD (see above). 
ABT decreases T cell proliferation and inhibits the production of the cytokines TNF alpha (TNF α), 
interferon -γ, IL-2, IL -6, some of which  are also linked to the pathogenesis of myositis.  
 
5.1.1 Abatacept Dosage and Administration  
 
A self-administered weekly dose of 125 mg SQ will be used in this 24 -week trial and open label 
phase of 24 weeks. Abatacept is supplied in prefilled syringes or ClickJectTM prefilled 
autoinjectors for Subcutaneous (SC) injections. The clinical site will provide instructions to the 
subject how to safely administering the study medication subcutaneously at the Visit 1 time -point.  
 
5.1.2 Abatacept Storage  
Abatacept  subcutaneous syringes or autoinjectors should be stored under refrigeration (2 -8°C) and 
protected from light. Do not allow the pre -filled syringe or autoinjector to freeze and do  not use 
beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_370676]. If frozen, do not use.  
 
Access must be restricted to authorized personnel. The intake of all study drugs will be recorded in 
the Case Report Form (CRF).  The medication provided for this study is for use only as directed in 
the protocol. Clinical center pharmacies will be respons ible for the storage, handling, and 
dispensing of study drug.  The Coordinating Center will monitor all documentation related to drug 
handling activities to ensure adherence to proper procedures.   
All used and unused study drugs must be retained at the clinic for reconciliation and accountability 
and should be destroyed at the study site by [CONTACT_370701].  
 
Study drugs are to be prescribed only by a physician named in the Form FDA -1572.  Under no 
circumstances will the investigator allow the study drug to be used other than as directed by [CONTACT_12695].   
 
5.1.[ADDRESS_463814].  Study medication will be labeled with the 
following information:  
 
• Subject ID  
• Study protocol number  
• Investigational new drug statement  
• Storage conditions and expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]  
 
5.1.3 Abatacept Overdosage  
Doses up to 50 mg/kg have been administered intravenously without apparent toxic effect. In  case 
of overdosage, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms  of 
adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

 5.2 Other Study Drug(s)  
Placebo will be prepared as described above in 5.1.3.  
 
6.0 RISK AND BENEFITS  
 
6.1 Study Medication Risks  
A cumulative review of serious and non -serious ADRs was performed from completed double  
blind, placebo -controlled studies for the RA indication (7 IV and 2 SC studies) and also from 
ongoing studies where the unblinded data are available, which included studies in psoriatic arthritis 
(PsA). Assessment of ADRs from one ongoing study in PsA was also performed. The ADRs in 
patients with PsA are similar to those reported in patients with RA in terms of type, severity, and 
nature of ADRs. As of [ADDRESS_463815] is presented by [CONTACT_370702]: very common 
(≥ 10%); common (≥ 1% to < 10%); uncommon (≥ 0.1% to < 1%); rare (≥ 0.01% to < 0.1%), or 
very rare (< 0.01%).  
 
The following is an integrated summary of the Adverse Drug Reactions in Subjects 
Treated with Abatacept in  Clinical Studies  
 
Common Adverse Events (≥ 1% to < 10%):  
Administration Site Reactions: Generalized fatigue and injection site reactions  
Gastrointestinal Disorders : abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, mouth ulceration and nausea  
General Disorders and Infestations: asthenia, bronchitis, urinary tract infection, upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], herpes simplex, ear infections and oral herpes

onychomycosis, tooth infection and pylenephritis  
Investigations:  increased weight, Transaminases  increased  
Nervous system disorders:  paraesthesia  
Malignancies: basal cell carcinoma  
Psychiatric Disorders:  anxiety, depression and insomnia  
  
[ADDRESS_463816] Disorders:  amenorrhea, menorrhagia  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders : wheezing, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease and dyspnea  
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:  alocpecia, dermatitis, dry skin, hyperhidrosis, 
increased tendency to bruise, pruritis, erythema and acne 
Vascular Disorders:  flushing, hot flush and hypotension

Malignancies:  lymphoma  
 
Antirheumatic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_370678] B reactivation.  
 
Adult COPD patients treated with abatacept in RA developed adverse events more frequently than  
those treated with placebo, including COPD exacerbations, cough, rhonchi, and dyspnea. Use of  
abatacept in patients with COPD should be undertaken with caution and such patients  should be 
monitored for worsening of their respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219].  
 
6.2 Other Risks  
Physical Activity Monitor  (PAM)  Use:  There is the possibility of minor skin irritation associated 
with wearing the PAM device. There may be minor risk of skin irritation from use of the elastic 
belt if used with the PAM device. Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_370679], dry and loosely fitting will help reduce  
this risk.  
Blood Drawing: Subjects may experience pain, bruising and/or bleeding at the site of the needle 
insertion for blood drawing.  Very rarely an infection may occur at the site.  Subjects may also 
experience dizziness and/or fainting.  
Risk of Breach of Confidentiality:  Study data and blood specimens collected during the course 
of this trial will be labeled with a study code and contain no personal subject identifiers that could 
directly identify the subject and will be stored in a secure location; however t here is a chance that a 
breach of confidentiality will occur and the subject  personal or medical health information may be 
inappropriately distributed.  
Data that is transferred from your FitBit One  ® device will not contain any identifiable personal 
information. The data will be stored on a secure network server located in the Department of 
Medicine, Division of Rheumatology.  Study data will be stored in the Rheumatic Disease 
Management System (RDMS) located at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], Division of Rheumatology 
which is located on a secure server behind a network firewall. There is the possibility that if the 
results of the research studies involving b iologic samples or genetic material were to become known 
this information could affect the subjects ability to be insured or employed, reputation, and future 
plans for children, or family relationships. Although every reasonable effort has been taken, 
  
20 
 confidentiality during Internet communication activities  cannot be guaranteed and it is possible that 
additional information beyond that collected for research purposes may be captured and used by 
[CONTACT_370703].  
Reproductive Risks:  The effect of the study drug on the unborn child is unknown.   
Consequences of additional therapy restrictions:  There is a risk for deterioration in the subjects’  
condition. New symptoms occurring during the treatment period requiring an unscheduled 
physician visit, emergency department evaluation, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_370680]. Determination will then be made by [CONTACT_28824] [INVESTIGATOR_370681].  
 
Genetic Samples :  It would be rare (less than 1% of cases or in less than 1 out of 100 cases) that if 
the results of the research studies involving genetic material were to become generally known the 
information could affect the subjects  ability to be insured, ability to be employed, r future plans for 
children, or family relationships.

11.0 REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
11.1 Adverse Event and Reporting Definitions  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting 
medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject  who has been  administered a study 
drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, 
for example), symptom, or disease tempor ally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Data on adverse events will be 
collected and reported regardless of relation to the study drug. Moreover, relatedness of these AE 
to the use of  BMS drugs associated with this study (where applicable) will be assessed.   
Note:  Although not always  considered  adverse events by [CONTACT_8661], the following 
events associated with a BMS product must be reported.  
▪ Exposure (to fetus) during pregnancy, exposure (to infant) during lactation, and paternal 
exposure  
▪ Overdose  
▪ Lack of efficacy  
▪ Abuse  
▪ Misuse  
▪ Off-label use  
▪ Occupational exposure  
▪ Medication error and potential medication error  
▪ Suspected transmission of an infectious agent, e.g., any organism, virus or infectious 
particle pathogenic or non -pathogenic, via the medicinal product.  
 
The causal relationship to the study drug associated with this study is determined by  [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_370682] (AE). The causal relationship can be one of the 
following:  
▪ Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the BMS product associated 
with this study and the AE.  
▪ Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between the BMS product 
associated with this study and the AE.  
▪ The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship.  
 
  
[ADDRESS_463825]. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)  
 
NON -SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
▪ Non-serious Adverse Events (AE) are to be provided to BMS in aggregate via interim or 
final study reports as specified in the agreement or, if a regulatory requirement [e.g. IND 
US trial] as part of an annual reporting requirement.  
▪ Non-serious AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead -in 
period or other observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.  
 
A non-serious adverse event  is an AE not classified as serious.  
 
A serious AE (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
results in death; is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if 
it were more severe); requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19192] (PI [INVESTIGATOR_370683]); results in persistent 
or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; is an important medical 
event (defin ed as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require intervention [e.g., medical, surgical] to pre vent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not resu lt in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].); suspected transmission of an infectious agent, 
pathogenic or nonpathogenic, via the BMS product associated with this study is an SAE.  
 
An overdose  is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important.  
Although pregnancy, overdose; potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI) and cancer are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events are handled as SAEs.  
 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102412]:  
▪ A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event).  
▪ Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent.  
▪ Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
▪ Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., 
routine colonoscopy).  
▪ Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases  
▪ Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reasons).  
▪ Admission for administration of subsequent anti -cancer therapy in the absence of any other 
SAEs (applies to oncology protocols).  
 
Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
  
[ADDRESS_463826] results that constitute SAEs should be documented and reported as such.  
The following laboratory abnormalities should be documented and reported appropriately:  
▪ Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE  
▪ Any laboratory abnormality that required the participant to have study drug discontinued or 
interrupted  
▪ Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective therapy.  
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by [CONTACT_35867] (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value).  
 
Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)  
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs.  
 
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as:  
1) AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)  AND  
2) Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_463827], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),  AND  
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, active myositis with elevated CK, viral hepatitis, pre -existing 
chronic or acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.  
 
Pregnancy  
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a study 
participant is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational pro duct exposure, 
including at least [ADDRESS_463828] will be 
permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (e.g., dose tapering if necessary for 
participant).  
The investigator must immediately notify [EMAIL_555] of this event via the 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form in accordance with SAE reporting procedures.  
Protocol -required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on the 
participant.  
Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form [provided upon request from BMS]  
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to 
BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. In 
order for Sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance information from the female 
partner, the female partner must sign an informed consent form for disclosure of this information.  
 
Overdose  
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE.  
 
Other Safety Considerations  
  
27 
 Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms, X -rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these 
procedures are required by [CONTACT_760], should also be recorded as a non -serious or serious AE, as 
appropriate, and reported accordingly.  
 
11.2 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events Associated with Abatacept  
 
Immediate Reporting Requirements : 
 
Non-serious AEs and SAEs whether or not related to the BMS product associated to this study, 
pregnancies, AEs associated with maternal exposure, and pregnancy outcomes ascertained in the 
study must be reported individually in the time frames noted below. A ll AEs collected will also be 
reported in aggregate in the final study report. Any component of a study endpoint that is 
considered related to study therapy (e.g., death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to 
anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported) sh ould be reported as an SAE.    
Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting  
▪ All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur following the subject’s written consent to 
participate in the study through [ADDRESS_463829] be collected that relate to any  later 
protocol -specified procedure (e.g., a follow -up skin biopsy).  
▪ The MedWatch form 3500A will be to report SAEs. The form will be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_20444]. The BMS protocol ID number must be included on whatever form is 
submitted by [CONTACT_1034]/Investigator. The form can be accessed at: 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/ .  
▪ Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether 
related or not related to study drug, are collected, including those thought to be associated 
with protocol -specified procedures. The investigator should report any SAE occurring after 
these time periods that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol -specified 
procedure. For drugs with potential for delayed SAEs (e.g., delayed excretion of the parent 
or active metabolites), a longer follow -up period may be warranted to allow collection of 
these SAEs Laboratory  tests, and other assessments.  
▪ For studies with long -term follow -up periods in which safety data are being reported, 
include the timing of SAE collection.  
▪ The Sponsor will reconcile the clinical database SAE cases (case level only) transmitted to 
BMS Global Pharmacovigilance ( Worldwide.Safety@bms .com ).   Frequency of 
reconciliation should be every 3 months and prior to the database lock or final data 
summary. BMS GPV&E will email, upon request from the Investigator, the GPV&E 
reconciliation report. Requests for reconciliation should be sent to 
aepbusinessp [EMAIL_7132]. The data elements listed on the GPV&E reconciliation 
report will be used for case identification purposes. If the Investigator determines a case 
was not transmitted to BMS GPV&E, the case should be sent immediately to BMS.         
▪ In accordance with local regulations, BMS will notify investigators of all reported SAEs 
that are suspected (related to the investigational product) and unexpected (i.e., not 
previously described in the IB). An event meeting these criteria is termed a Susp ected, 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R). Investigator notification of these events 
will be in the form of S[LOCATION_003]R Report.  
o Other important findings which may be reported by [CONTACT_370705]: 
increased frequency of a clinically significant expected SAE, an SAE considered 
  
[ADDRESS_463830] to study subjects, clinically significant safety 
finding from a nonclinical (e.g., animal) study, important safety recommendations 
from a study data monitoring committee, or sponsor decision to end or temporarily 
halt a clinical study for safety reasons.  
▪ Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the investigator must review and retain the ESR 
with the IB. Where required by [CONTACT_34342] a central IRB/IEC 
for the study, the sponsor will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB/IEC. The 
investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. 
The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any 
other safety information.  
▪ In addition, suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or unexpected) 
shall be reported by [CONTACT_370706] (either as expedited and/or in 
aggregate repor ts). 
 
Investigators should report to the responsible regulatory authority as appropriate.  
All SAEs must be reported by [CONTACT_370707] (fax) transmission or reported via electronic 
mail to:  
 
SAE Email Address:  [EMAIL_176]  
SAE Facsimile Number:   [PHONE_3046]  
 
SAEs, whether related o r not related to study drug, as well as  pregnancies , must be reported to 
BMS within [ADDRESS_463831] be recorded on  the MedWatch form; pregnancies must be 
reported on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
 
▪ An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its 
seriousness.  
▪ For studies with long -term follow -up periods in which safety data are being reported, 
include the timing of SAE collection in the protocol.  
▪ If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially 
related to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a 
complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the na rrative 
section of the SAE Report Form.  
▪ If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: 
Follow -up SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information 
becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to BMS (or designee) 
using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE repo rt. All SAEs should be 
followed to resolution or stabilization.  
 
Non-serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting  
The collection of non -serious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug. All non -
serious adverse events (not only those deemed to be treatment -related) should be collected 
continuously during the treatment period and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_463832] be reported by [CONTACT_370708]:  
 
Non-serious AE Email Address:   [EMAIL_176]   
Non-serious AE Facsimile Number:   [PHONE_3046]  
 
Non-serious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious. Follow -up is also required for non -serious AEs that cause interruption or 
discontinuation of the BMS product associated with this study and for those present at the end of 
the study, as appropriate.  
 
MedWatch 3500A Reporting Guidelines  
In addition to completing appropriate patient demographic and suspect medication information, the 
report should include the following information within the Event Description (section 5) of the 
MedWatch 3500A form:  
 
▪ Treatment regimen (dosing frequency, combination therapy)  
▪ Protocol description (and number, if assigned)  
▪ Description of event, severity, treatment, and outcome if known  
▪ Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics  
▪ Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to each investigational 
product and suspect medication  
 
Follow -up information:   
 
Additional information may be added to a previously submitted report by [CONTACT_69167]:  
 
▪ Adding to the original MedWatch 3500A report and submitting it as follow -up 
▪ Adding supplemental summary information and submitting it as follow -up with the original 
MedWatch 3500A form  
▪ Summarizing new information and faxing it with a cover letter including subject identifiers 
(i.e. D.O.B. initial, subject number), protocol description and number, if assigned, suspect 
drug, brief adverse event description, and notation that additional or follow -up information 
is being submitted  (The patient identifiers are important so that the new information is 
added to the correct initial report)  
 
12.0   STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
12.1   Determination of Sample Size      
 
The sample size is 20 patients with 10 patients in each arm for a 24 -week randomized double blind 
clinical trial. The sample size is justified based on this trial being a proof of concept pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].   
This study will allow us to determine an initial signal for possible efficacy of ABT in Myositis -
ILD (Syn -ILD) as well as give safety and tolerability data. Moreover, it will allow us to determine 
an estimate of the effect size of the study drug and plac ebo to design a more definitive phase II/III 
clinical tr ial. In our cohort about 25% patients with SOC decline by [CONTACT_169336]% of ≥15% or death or 
  
30 
 transplant. Assuming FVC decline by [CONTACT_159123] 10% on SOC therapy and trial drug + SOC leads to 
improvement in FVC% (Even by [CONTACT_159123] 5%) we will have >90% power to detect the difference 
with sample size proposed. Based on our database there is about 25% patie nts that decline FVC > 
10% on SOC for myositis ILD.  
 
12.2    Planned Efficacy Evaluations  
 
12.2.1  Primary Efficacy Variables  
The primary end point  for statistical analysis will be the percent FVC changes from baseline to 
week 24 between the 2 treatments arms (SOC/placebo vs. SOC/ABT).  
 
Primary outcome criteria for safety and tolerability will be adverse event (routine adverse events or 
tolerability issues and serious adverse event) between the 2 treatment arms (SOC/placebo vs. 
SOC/ABT).  
 
12.2.[ADDRESS_463833] occurrence of any of 
the following: death or lung transplant or FVC ≥10% decline or FVC ≥5% decline with 
DLCO ≥15% decline.  
b. Change in dyspnea, as measured by [CONTACT_370692] (UCSD SOBQ) (range 0 -120, higher score is worsening dyspnea) . 
c. Time to improvement in FVC% by ≥10%.  
d. Rates of death or requiring lung transplant ..  
e. Other individual PFT variables (FEV1%, DLCO%) . 
f. Qualitative changes in HRCT chest over 6 months in the two arms using chi -square (or 
Fischer exact) test. Changes in semi -qualitative scoring of fibrosis over [ADDRESS_463834] (calculated using prednisone dose equivalents)  
h. Frequency of treatment failures: a) patient meeting worsening criteria or withdrawal due to 
worsening ILD anytime during the trial or b) FVC% worsening by 10% at 6 months, c) 
death or transplant within 6 months.  
 
Secondary Outcome Myositis: Given that many patients may have concomitant active myositis 
with muscle and/or skin involvement we will assess clinical outcomes related to both muscle and 
skin using following secondary outcomes (SOC/placebo vs. SOC/ABT):  
Active myositis is defined based on MDAAT at baseline muscle or cutaneous skin disease activity 
of ≥ 3 on 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS).  
New myositis response criteria and IMACS definition of improvement (DOI) will be used to 
assess myositis response in drug + SOC vs. placebo + SOC.  
 
12.3   Methods of Analysis  
 
Primary End Point:   
The primary end point for statistical analysis will be the percent FVC changes from baseline to 
week 24 between the 2 treatments arms (SOC/placebo vs. SOC/ABT). Ranked ANCOVA, with 
average standardized rank change in the predicted FVC% as the outcome measu re and the 
standardized rank baseline as a covariate will be used. Primary outcome criteria for safety and 
  
31 
 tolerability will be adverse event (routine adverse events or tolerability issues and serious adverse 
event) between the 2 treatment arms (SOC/placebo vs. SOC/ABT). Chi -square (or Fischer exact 
test) and t -test (or Mann -Whitney) will be used based on data variable and distribution. Patients 
will be stratified for sub -analysis based on their SOC drug  
 
Secondary Analysis ( SOC/placebo vs. SOC/ABT) for Syn -ILD:  
a. Time to progression free survival where progression is defined as first occurrence of any of 
the following: death or lung transplant or FVC ≥10% decline or FVC ≥5% decline with 
DLCO ≥15% decline. This will be done using Cox proportional hazards model and 
controlling for baseline demographics and FCV%.  
b. Change in dyspnea, as measured by [CONTACT_370692] (UCSD SOBQ) (range 0 -120, higher score is worsening dyspnea), will be 
done using Mann -Whitney test.  
c. Time to improvement in FVC% by ≥10%. This will be done using Kaplan Meier survival 
curve and Cox’s proportional hazards model after controlling for co -variates.  
d. Rates of death or requiring lung transplant using Chi -square (Fischer exact) test.  
e. Other individual PFT variables (FEV1%, DLCO%) similar to analysis done for primary 
outcome of FVC%.  
f. Qualitative changes in HRCT chest over 6 months in the two arms using chi -square (or 
Fischer exact) test. Changes in semi -qualitative scoring of fibrosis over [ADDRESS_463835] (calculated using prednisone dose equivalents) using paired t -test.  
h. Frequency of treatment failures: a) patient meeting worsening criteria or withdrawal due to 
worsening ILD anytime during the trial or b) FVC% worsening by 10% at 6 months, c) 
death or transplant within [ADDRESS_463836] will be used to compare betw een the 
two groups.  
 
Secondary Outcome Myositis:  
New myositis response criteria (table 1) and IMACS definition of improvement (DOI) will be used 
to assess myositis response in drug + SOC vs. placebo + SOC.  
 
a. Comparison of the average Total Improvement Scores during the 6 -month treatment 
period. Repeated measures analysis will be used to compare the two treatment groups and 
adjustments will be made for the baseline core set measures (CSM) values.  
b. Comparison of the proportion of patient meeting IMACS DOI and time to first IMACS 
DOI between the 2 arms,  
c. Comparison of the individual CSM in subjects over time between the 2 arms (repeated 
measures analysis).  
d. Comparison of the magnitude of the effect size between both treatment arms by [CONTACT_370709] ≥ 20 (minimal), 40 (moderate) 
and 60 (major).  
 
13.0 RETENTION OF RECORDS  
 
All study records and source documents will be maintained for 7 years after the completion of the study 
or for the period specified by [CONTACT_370710], whichever is longer.

APPENDIX A:  MMT -8 
 
MMT - 8 is a set of 8 designated muscles tested unilaterally (potential score 0 -70 and usually 
  
34 
 tested on the right side unless contraindicated ) or bilaterally (potential score 0 -140) and if axial 
(neck flexor) testing is included, potential score = 150. The scale of 150 is proposed for this trial.

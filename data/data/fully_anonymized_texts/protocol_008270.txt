Study Title
An exploratory  Phase 1/2 tri al to evaluate the safety  and efficacy of JCAR017 combinations in 
subjects wi th relapsed/refractory  B-cell malignancies (PLATFORM) 
Indication
Relapsed/refractory  (R/R) aggressive B -cell non-Hodgkin lympho ma (NHL) in subjects ≥ 18 
years.
Objectives
Primary Objective:
Dose finding (Phase 1):
To evaluate the safet y and to define the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule (RP2D) of 
JCAR017 co mbinat ions in adult subjects with R/R aggressive B -cell NHL
Dose expansio n (Phase 2):
To evaluate the efficacy  of JCAR017 co mbinat ions in adult subjects with R/R aggressive B -cell 
NHL defined as co mplete response rate (CRR)
Secondary Objectives:
Dose finding (Phase 1):
To assess the efficacy of JCAR017 co mbinat ions 
Dose expansio n (Phase 2):
To assess the safet y and other efficacy  parameters of JCAR017 combinat ions
To characterize changes in healt h-related qualit y of life (HRQoL) outcom e measures 
for subjects treated wit h JCAR017 co mbinat ions
Phase 1/2:
To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of JCAR017
To characterize the PK profiles of the respective combinat ion agents
Study Design
This is a global, open -label, mult i-arm, parallel  multi-cohort, m ulti-center, P hase 1/2 study to 
determine the safet y, tolerabili ty, PK, efficacy and HRQoL of JCAR017 in combinat ion with 
various agents. This protocol is intended to evaluate various drug combinations with JCAR017, 
as separate arms, over the life of the protocol, using the same obj ectives. Each combinat ion will  
be evaluated separately (ie, the intent ion is not to compare between co mbinations) for the 
purposes of the object ives, trial design, and statistical analysis. The fo llowing co mbinat ions will 
be tested:
Arm A:JCAR017 in co mbinat ion with durvalumab
Arm B: JCAR017 in co mbinat ion with avadomide ( CC-122)

Confident ial and Propri etary 7 Protocol JCAR017 -BCM -002 Amendment 6 Final: 27 Jan 2021During the dose and schedule finding part (Phase 1), a safet y review co mmittee (SRC )whose 
members include the medical mo nitor(s), drug safety  physician, statist ician, and a subset of 
investigators will recommend the Phase 2 dose and schedule (defined as RP2D) for each arm 
based on an integrated assessment of the safet y, PK and pharmacodynamic (Pd) data, and 
preliminary efficacy  information. The Bayesian Optimal Interval Design (BOIN) will be used for 
dose escalat ion/de-escalat ion decisio ns during the Phase 1 part of the study .The SRC may 
override the BOIN algorithm for safet y concerns.
Enrollment will be staggered in Phase 1 in all arms , and a maximum of 9 dose -limit ing toxicit y 
(DLT) evaluable subjects will be evaluated in each subcohort. The first 6 subjects within a 
subcohort will enter the DLT period a minimum o f 1 week apart or long er as specified forany 
individual Armto all ow appropri ate safet y monitoring. Dose -limiting toxi cities will be assessed 
during the respective DLT period (see Section 9.3.1). 
A dose expansion cohort (Phase 2) may be opened at a dose level and schedule in any arm that 
has been shown to be safe with at least [ADDRESS_666058] visit for 
survival.
Long term  safety  and efficacy  follow-up of  subjects exposed to gene therapy  medicinal products 
that utilize integrating vectors is required as per health authorit y regul atory  guidelines to assess 
the risk of delayed adverse events, monitor for multico mpetent retrovirus or lentivirus and to 
monitor for vector persistence. Therefore, all subjects who received JCAR017 infusio n under thi s 
current protocol will be asked to roll -over upon ei ther prem ature discont inuat ion from or 
completion of this study  and participate in a separate long
-term follow-up (LTFU) protocol for 
up to 15 years after their JCAR017 infusio n. The study  will be conducted in compliance with 
International Council f or Harm onisat ion (ICH) and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) and FDA 
Guidance for Industry  (Food and Drug Administration, 2020 ).

1.1. Disease Background
1.1.1. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
Non-Hodgkin lympho mas (NHLs) comprise a heterogeneous group of malignancies. Wit hin 
Europe, the incidence o f NHL is approximately  49,533 wi th a mortali ty of 20,347 (Ferlay, 2015 ). 
In the [LOCATION_002] (US), it is est imated that approximately  72,580 new cases of NHL will be 
diagnosed and approximately  20,150 subjects will di e of their disease in 2016 ( Siegel, 2016 ). 
Non-Hodgkin lympho mas are cl assified according to the current World Health Organi zation 
(WHO) classificat ion (Swerdl ow, 2016 ) into immature lympho id neoplasms, mature B -cell 
neopl asms, T cell and natural killer (NK) -cell neoplasms, and post -transplant 
lymphoproliferat ive disor ders. Mature B -cell lympho mas are further classified into indo lent 
lympho mas (eg, mult iple myelo ma (MM), chronic lymphocy tic leukemia [CLL]) and aggressive 
lympho mas (eg, diffuse large B -cell lympho ma [DLBCL]). 
DLBCL is the most frequent lympho ma subt ype, representing approximately  30% of  all NHL. 
DLBCL can develop de novo or secondary  to transform ation of an indo lent NHL. Estimated 
incidence in the European Unio n (EU) i s 3 to 4/100,000/year, increasing with age from 
0.3/100,000/year (35 to 39 y ears) to 26 .6/100,000/year (80 to 84 y ears) ( Tilly, 2012). About 
10,000 deaths per y ear are due to DLBCL in the US (National Cancer Inst itute [NCI]). Most 
subjects wi th localized DLBCL can be cured with convent ional co mbinat ion immuno -chemo-or 
combined -modality therapy  (Tilly, 2015 ). For subjects with advanced -stage disease, the majorit y 
of subjects can be cured with doxorubicin -based combinat ion chemotherapy  and ri tuximab (eg, 
R-CHOP). Prognosis depends on individual risk factors. The International Prognostic Index (IPI) 
for aggressive NHL includes five significant risk factors progn ostic of overall survival (OS): 
Subject age, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, Eastern Cooperative Onco logy Group 
(ECOG) performance status, disease stage, and extranodal invo lvement. Subjects with ≥ [ADDRESS_666081] a poor prognosis with a 5 -year OS -rate of 21% to 46%. Age -
and stage -adjusted m odificat ions are used for y ounger subjects wi th localize d disease ( Moller, 
2003). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_372035], approximately one -third of  subjects will 
develop relapsed/refractory  (R/R) di sease that remains a major cause of mortalit y. Refractory  
disease is def ined as a < 50% decrease in lesio n size or the appearance of new lesio ns.Relapsed 
disease reflects the (re)appearance of lesio ns after attainment of a partial or complete response 
(PR or CR) ( Cheson, 2007 ). Relapsed /refractor ysubjects have a poor prognosis, particularly  
those who do not respond to second line chemotherapy  with a median OS of 4.4 months ( Van 
Den Neste, 2016 ). 
Diffuse large B -cell lympho ma is a heterogeneous disease wit
h several histol ogical and 
molecular subt ypes. The largest subgroup is DLBCL not otherwise specified (NOS). Molecular 
profiling by [CONTACT_348961] n profiling (GEP) based on bio logic similarit y to normal  stages of B -
cell development (cell of origin [COO]) helped to fur ther divide DLBCL into germinal center -
like (GCB), activated B -cell-like (ABC) tumors, and primary mediast inal large B -cell lymphom a 
(PMBCL), a dist inct clinical ent ity (Lenz, 2008). Immunohistochemistry  (IHC) al gorithms are

Within the GCB group a specific high- risk group is defined by [CONTACT_514157] c -MYC and the ant i-apoptoti c oncogene BCL2 or BCL6, referred to as 
doubl e-hit lympho mas (DHL). In addit ion, in so me cases there is a concurrent rearrangement of 
c-MYC and both antiapoptotic oncogenes BCL2 and BCL6, which are referred to as triple -hit 
lympho ma. D HL represents approximately 5% of de novo cases of DLBCL wit h very poor OS of 
≤12 m onths when treated with R -CHOP ( Camicia, 2015 ). Newer data suggest negative 
prognosti c impact of P53 mutations or deletions in DLBCL ( Schiefer, 2015).
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_514129] (FL) being an indolent lympho ma type, Grade 3B FL is regarded as 
aggressive lympho ma. Clinical behavior is very similar to DLBCL and FL frequent ly undergoes 
histol ogical transform ation into DLBCL. Consequent ly, current guidelines reco mmend to treat 
FL Grade 3B according to the DLBCL treatment algorithm ( NCCN, 2016; Dreyling, 2014). 
These subjects are generally treated with an anthracy cline -based chemotherapy  comb ined with 
rituximab (eg, R -CHOP) and have a similar prognosis to that of de novo DLBCL. 
1.1.2. CD19 as a Therapeutic Target 
CD19 i s a 95 -kDa glycoprotein present on B -cells fro m early  devel opment until  different iation 
into plasma cells ( Stam enkovic, 1988 ). It i s a m ember of the immunoglobulin superfamily  and a 
component of a B -cell surface signal transduct ion complex that posit ively regulates signal 
transduction through the B -cell receptor ( Stamenkovic, 1988; Brentjens, 2011 ). 
CD19 i s an attractive therapeut ic target because it is expressed by [CONTACT_304900] B -cell malignancies, 
including B -cell NHL ( Li, 1993 ; Li, 1996 ; Davila, 2012 ). Im portantly , the CD19 ant igen is not 
expressed on hematopoiet ic stem cells or on any normal t issue apart from those of the B -cell 
lineage. 
1.1.3. CD19 –Targeted Chimeric Antigen Receptors 
CD19 -specific chimeric antigen re ceptors (CARs) are single chain variable fragments (scFv) 
fused to a transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic signaling domains. Expressio n of the CD19
-
CAR in autologous T cells is achieved by  [CONTACT_514158] a recombinant retroviral or 
lentiviral vector. The CAR is expressed on the T cell surface and redirects the transfected T cells 
to CD19- expressing lymphoma cells, leading to CD19 -specific tumor cell recognit ion, lysis, 
cytokine secret ion and T cell proliferat ion (Sadelain, 2013 ). In clinical studies, CD19 -targeted 
CARs have demo nstrated encouraging activit y in adul t and pedi atric subjects wi th R/R B -cell 
acute lymphoblast ic leukemia (ALL) and B -cell NHL ( Maude, 2018; Park, 2018 ; Gardner, 2017;

1.2.2. Durvalumab (M EDI4736)
Durvalumab (MEDI4736, Durva) is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG)1 kappa monoclonal 
antibody  (mAb) di rected against human programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) protein. 
Durvalumab is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and has an overall mo lecular weight of 
approximately  [ADDRESS_666083] ively binds human PD -L1 wi th high affinit y and 
blocks i ts abili ty to bind to programmed cell death 1 (PD -1) protein and cluster of differentiation 
(CD)80. The fragment cry stallizable (Fc) domain of durv alumab contains a triple mutation in the 
constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that reduces binding to the complement component 
C1q and the Fc gamma receptors responsible for mediat ing antibody -dependent T cell -mediated 
cytotoxi city (ADCC) ( Oganesyan, 2008; Ibrahim, 2015 ).
On 01 May  1, 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval 
to durvalumab (IMFINZI™) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metast atic 
urothelial carcino ma who have disease progression during or following platinum -containing 
chemotherapy or who have disease progression wit hin 12 mo nths of neoadjuvant or adjuvant

antibody  that wa s isolated fo llowing immunizat ion of transgenic mice expressing human 
immunogl obulin (Ig) genes. Relatlimab binds to LAG -3 receptors expressed on T -cells with high 
affinit y and prevents binding of this receptor to cells bearing its ligands, major histocomp atibility 
complex (MHC) Class II (Andrews, 2017 )and fibrinogen -like protein 1 (FGL -1) (Wang, 2019).
Relatlimab binding inhibits the negative regulatory funct ion of LAG -[ADDRESS_666085] , relatlimab 
enhances the ant i-tumor immune response and, thus, has the potential to inhibit the growth of 
multiple malignancies when administered alone or in combinat ion with other therapeutic

programmed death –ligands 1 (PD -L1) and 2 (PD -L2), results in the down -regul ation of 
lymphocy te activat ion. Inhibit ion of the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands promotes 
immune responses and ant igen-specific T- cell responses to both foreign ant igens as well as self -
antigens. Nivolumab is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and is produced using 
standard m ammalian cell cult ivation and chro matographic purificat ion techno logies. The clinical 
study  product i s a sterile sol ution for parenteral  administrati on.Nivolumab (OPDIVO™) is 
approved for the treatment of several t ypes of cancer in mult iple regio ns including the United 
States (US, Dec -2014) , the European Unio n (EU, Jun -2015), and Japan (Jul -2014). Dual  
checkpoint inhibit ion with relatlimab and nivo lumab results in enhanced T -cell effector funct ion 
that is greater than the effects of eit her ant ibody  alone in m urine syngeneic tumor models.

Protocol  JCAR017 -BCM -002 Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 33 Protocol JCAR017 -BCM -002 Amendment 6 Final: 27 Jan 2021while higher overall response rates of up to 80 % (CR rate 47% to 60%) have been reported after 
CAR T cell infusio n, responses in some are transient and subjects have been shown to relapse in 
the presence o f persistent CAR T cells ( Neelapu, 2017 ;Abramso n, 2017). Another study  
reported a long term CR rate of 40% ( Schuster, 2017
). 
Possible explanations for this are ( Tran, 2017 ):
Immunological exhaust ion of circulat ing T cells and/or changes in T lymphocy te 
popul ations.
An effect of the tumor microenvironment, eg, CAR T cells are suppressed by [CONTACT_514161] y before they  are able to 
eliminate all lympho ma cells.
Accordingly , combinat ion of JCAR017 with immune system modifiers such as checkpo int 
inhibitors or immuno modulatory  com pounds coul d restore the T cell funct ion, reduce the 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and improve t he response and durabilit y of the 
response to JCAR017. In order to enhance the antitumor activit y of JCAR017, thi s trial will test 
if the co mbinat ion of JCAR017 wit h immuno modulatory  agents is safe and improves the CRR 
and the durabilit y of responses. 
1.3.2. Rationale for the Study Design
To test the above assumpt ions, this tri al uses a m ulti-arm, parallel cohort design to test various 
combinat ions of JCAR017 wit h different combinatio n agents. Each combination will be tested in 
a dedi cated study  arm. Each study  arm may test three general sequences of treatment in separate 
cohorts (seeFigure 1):
A post -expansio n cohort will assess the safet y and feasibilit y of boosting the 
JCAR017 efficacy  after peak expansi on of JCAR017, i e, after the first efficacy  
assessment around Day  [ADDRESS_666087] -JCAR017 infusio n. 
A post-infusion cohort will assess the safet y and feasibilit y of administering 
combinat ion agents closer to peak exp ansion of  JCAR017 (ie, wi thin the first 2 
weeks) with the intent to increase T cell healt h, modulate the tum or 
microenvironment and optimize T cell subpopulat ions following JCAR017 infusion 
and prior to peak expansio n of JCAR017 . 
A pre -infusio n cohort wil l test the safet y and feasibilit y of initiating treatment with a 
combinat ion agent prior to JCAR017 infusio n. This may increase the health o f T cells 
in the primary leukapheresis starting material and translate into a healthier JCAR017 
T cell product and p otenti ally modulate the tumor microenvironment to make the 
tumor more susceptible to the JCAR017
. Continuing the combinat ion post infusio n 
may potentially improve the pharmacodynamics of JCAR017 cells, ult imately  
improving efficacy  and safet y of JCAR017 .
Additional cohorts m ay be added wi th the aim to combine approaches to maximize the efficacy 
of JCAR017 pending safet y and preliminary efficacy  resul ts to f urther optimize JCAR017 
efficacy .

combinat ions to improve clinical efficacy o f JCAR017. 
1.3.3. Rationale for Dose, Schedule and Regimen Selection 
[IP_ADDRESS]. JCAR017 Dose Rationale
JCAR017 has been generally  tolerated at doses from 0.5 x 106to 1 x 106CAR+ T cells/kg in 
pediatric subjects wi th ALL condit ioned with flu/cy. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 
exceeded in this study  in subjects treated after flu/cy  LD chem otherapy: at 5 x 106CAR+ T 
cells/kg in pediatric subjects with ALL (PLAT -02 study ). Ant itumor activit y has been observed 
at all doses of JCAR017 tested. 
The JCAR017 starting dose for Arm A is a dose of 50 x 106CAR+ T cells (dose level 1 [ DL1]), 
which converts in CAR+ T cells per kg to the middle of the dose ranges tolerated with JCAR017: 
50x 106CAR+ T cells is equivalent to 0.5 x 106CAR+ T cells/kg for a 100 kg adult and 
equivalent to 1 x 106CAR+ T cells/kg for a 50 kg adult. 
Dose l evel 2 (DL2) (1 00x 106CAR+ T cells) was also ident ified in S tudy [ADDRESS_666088] oy LD chem otherapy  prior to the JCAR017 infusio n with flu/cy  (see 
Secti on7.2.1 for dose details).
1.3.4.
Rationale for Choice of Combination Compounds 
As a monotherapy , CD19 -targeted CAR T cells have been tested in adult subjects with 
aggressive B -cell NHL wi th a high overall response rate (ORR), but a lowe r than desirable rate 
of durable CR. Checkpo int proteins ,inhibitory microenvironment factors and T cell intrinsic 
factors may decrease the funct ion of the modified T cells in subjects with aggressive B -cell 
NHL, thereby  [CONTACT_514162] T cell -mediated antitumor activit y. Compounds that ei ther disrupt 
inhibitory  microenvironment factors or enhance the intrinsic biological  activi tyof the JCAR017 
cells offer an opportunit y to enhance the potency  and persist ent efficacy  of JCAR017 while 
maintaining accepta ble safet y and tol erabili ty.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for JCAR017 in Combination with PD-1 or PD- L1 Blockade
CD8+ cy totoxi c T cells recogni tionoftarget antigen presented on tumor cells involves formation 
of the immune synapse thatinduces act ivationand initiatestumor-cell killing after. Subsequent 
to activat ion, T cells express PD -1 on their surface and secrete interferons that in turn induce 
expressio n of checkpo int inhibitors such as PD -L1 and PD -L2 (Garci a Diaz , 2017) o n tumor 
cells and by[CONTACT_145111] (Hoekstra ,
2020 ). Binding ofPD-L1 and/or PD -L2 on tumor cells
(including lympho ma)and the tumor microenvironment to PD -1 on T cells (including CAR T 
cells) resul tsin inhibitory  checkpo int signaling that decreases cytotoxicit y and l eads to T cell 
exhaust ion (Andorsky , 2011 ). High levels o f PD-L1 promote T cell exhaust ion, and PD -L1 
blockade reinvigorates T cell funct ion.

that tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) express PD -1,

Within each combinat ion arm , up to 3cohorts plus various subcohorts (eg, addit ional dose l evels

The Bayesian Opt imal Interval Design (BOIN) ( Liu, 2015 ;Yuan, 2016 ) will be used for dose 
escalat ion/de-escalati on decisi on during Phase 1.
Subjects must have elevated disease burden at screening (sum o f product of perpendi cular 
diameters (SPD) of up to 6 index lesio ns ≥ 25cm2by [CONTACT_3610]) . Arms A and B are not subject to 
this requirement. Up to 15% of subjects per subcohort (ie, 1 in Phase 1 and 4in an expansio n 
cohort) may have Richter’s transformation (transform ed chronic lymphocy tic leukemia/CLL) 
without elevated tumor burden.
Enrollment will be staggered such that the first 6 subjects within a subcohort will enter the dose-
limiting toxi city (DLT )period a minimum of 1 week apart (or longer as specifie d in the relevant 
arm) to allow appropriate safet y monitoring. Dose -limiting toxi cities will be assessed during the 
DLT period defined per arm (see Sect ion9.3.1 ). A RP2D will be established based on the 
tolerabilit y and preliminary  efficacy in the DLT evaluable subjects treated in the respective 
subcohort. The f inal number of subjects will depend on the number of dose levels and schedules 
tested and t he number of DLTs observed wit hin each subcohort. Non -DLT evaluable subjects 
will be replaced.
A safet y review co mmittee (SRC) whose members include the medical mo nitor(s), drug safet y 
physician, statist ician, and a subset of invest igators will determine a RP2D for each combinat ion

Subjects from both phases and all cohorts who reach a PR [ADDRESS_666104] be obtained from the Sponsor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Durvalumab Dose Rationale
The dose levels and treatment schedules for durvalumab are based on a safe dose established in 
Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736- 1108, a Phase 1/2a study to evaluate the safet y, tolerabilit y, and PK 
of durvalumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors and on popul ation PK analyses. 
Popul ation PK analysis indicated only a minor impact of body  weight on the PK of durvalumab 
(coeffic ient of ≤ 0.5). The impact of body  weight -based (10 mg/kg every  2 weeks [Q2W]) and 
fixed dosing (750 mg Q2W) of durvalumab was evaluated by [CONTACT_514167]. A fixed dose of 750 mg and 1500 mg was 
selected to approximate 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respect ively (based on median body weight of 
approximately  75 kg). A total  of [ADDRESS_666105] variabilit y with the fixed dosing regimen. Based on these results the dose of 1500 mg 
every 4 weeks (Q4W) is now being explored as a dose that provides continuous plasma 
concentration of ant ibody  above the thresho ld needed for in vitro activit y.The dose of 1500 m g 
Q4W is the RP2D across the durvalumab clinical program (for ongoing or planned studies in 
both solid tumors and hemat ologi c malignancies). Over [ADDRESS_666106] ic syndrome were treated at a dose schedule equivalent to 1500 mg Q4W (ie, 10 
mg/kg Q2W or 20 mg/kg Q4W which show similar exposure levels based on the area under the 
curves steady state), and available safety  data support thi s as an appropri ate dose for durvalumab

more than one scale.
The QLQ- C30 empl oys a week recall period for all items and a 4- point scale for the funct ional 
and symptom scales/items with response categories “Not at all”, “A litt le”, “Quite a bit” and 
“Very much”. The two items assessing g lobal health status/ HRQoL utilize a 7 -point scale 
ranging from 1(“Very  Poor”) to 7 (“Excellent”) ( Aaronson, 1993
). 
6.8.2. EQ-5D-5L
EQ-5D is a standardized measure of healt h status developed by  [CONTACT_304919] a simple, generic measure of healt h for clinical and econo mic appraisal. The EQ -5D- 5L 
consists of the EQ -5D- 5L descript ive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The 
descript ive system co mprises dimensio ns (mobilit y, self-care, usual act ivities, pain/disco mfort, 
anxiet y/depressi on). Each dimensio n has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate 
probl ems, severe proble ms, extreme problems)
In 2005, a Task Force was established wit hin the EuroQol Group to invest igate methods to 
improve the instrument’s sensit ivity and to reduce ceiling effects. After much discussio n, the 
Task Force decided that there should be no change in the number of dimensio ns for a new 
versio n of EQ -5D.
However, previously published studies by [CONTACT_514181] 5 -
level versio ns of EQ- 5D coul d significantly increase reliabilit y and sensi tivity (discriminatory  
power) while maintaining feasibilit y and potenti ally reducing ceiling effects.
The EQ -5D- 5L still consists of 2 pages –the EQ -5D-5L descript ive system (page 2) and the EQ 
Visual Anal ogue Scale (page 3). The descript ive system co mprises the same 5 dimensio ns as the 
EQ-5D- 3L (mobilit y, self -care, usual activit ies, pain/disco mfort, anxiet y/depressio n).
However, each dimensio n now has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, 
severe problems, and extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/he r heal th state 
by [CONTACT_13158] (or pl acing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 
dimensio ns. This decisio n results in a 1 -digit number expressing the level selected for that 
dimensio n. The digit s for 5 dimensio ns can be com bined in a 5- digit number describing the 
respondent’s healt h state. It should be noted that the numerals 1- [ADDRESS_666198] their scores. The EQ -5D-5L now asks respondents to simply ‘mark an X on the scale to 
indicate how y our heal th is TODAY’ and then to ‘w rite the number y ou marked on the scale in 
the box below’.

oxidative metabo lism o f CC-122, wi th very  minor contributi ons by [CONTACT_514187], 
including CYP2C8 and CYP2C19. Hence, caution should be used when co -administering CC -
122 with drugs that are known strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_666231] not been evaluated in a clinical setting. Examples of these drugs include the fo llowing:
CYP3A4/5 inhibitors: telit hromycin, clarit hromycin, atazanavir, indinavir,
itraconazo le, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquina vir.
CYP3A4/5 inducers: rifampin , pheny toinand carbam azepi[INVESTIGATOR_050].

9.1. Overview
This study  is a Phase 1/2, mult i-center, open -label study  of the combinati onof JCAR017 and 
immuno modulatory  agents in subjects with R/R aggressive B -cell NHL. Phase [ADDRESS_666237] ive of Phase 1 is to assess the safet y and to determine the RP2D of the 
JCAR017 co mbinat ions per arm using a BOIN design. The combinat ion agents are as fo llows:
Arm A: durvalumab
Arm B: CC -122
Arm C: CC -220 (iberdo mide)
Arm D: ibrut inib
Arm E: nivo lumab ± relat limab
Arm F: CC-[ZIP_CODE]
Within an arm , adose expansio n cohort (Phase 2) may be opened at any  dose and schedule that 
has been shown to be safe with at least [ADDRESS_666238] on CR rate (CRR) at 3 months and subsequently  on CRR at 6 m onths when administered in 
combinat ion with checkpo int inhibitors or immunomodulatory  com pounds. 
The secondary  objectives (Phase 1 and Phase 2 in each arm) are to further evaluate sa fety, other 
efficacy  endpoints and to characterize the PKs of JCAR017 and the respect ive co mbinat ion 
agent.

9.4. Sample Size and Power Considerations
9.4.1. Phase 1
In each arm, dose escalat ion or de -escalat ion within any  cohort will be based on the BOIN 
algorithm. With the target DLT rate of 0.30, the BOIN escalat ion boundary  is λe=0.236 and the 
de-escalat ion boundary is λd=0.358. The BOIN dosing decisio n table is provided in Table 9. 
The BOIN design is a Bayesian dose -finding method that optimizes subject ethics by [CONTACT_514188] -therapeuti c and overly toxi c doses. The BOIN design 
yields an average performance co mparable to that of t he continual reassessment method (CRM) 
in term s of select ing the MTD, but has a lower risk of assigning subjects to sub -therapeuti c or 
overly  toxic doses (i e, better subject ethics). 
In each arm, enro llment into Phase [ADDRESS_666243] 1week . A longer interval may be 
specified for a specific arm (see Section3.1.9 ). Until a subcohort has 6 subjects with complete 
DLT inform ation and has been shown to be safe, no more than 6 subjects can be in the DLT 
period sim ultaneously  across subcohorts of a given arm . Enrollment to the next dose level will be 
pri
oritized if open for enrollment.

Inpat ient or ICU stays, while anticipated, are not scheduled protocol -defined visits. In ad dition, 
inpat ient or ICU admissio ns can generate large amounts of clinical data (eg, mult iple 
concomitant medicat ions, frequent concomitant medicat ion dose changes, laboratory  values, and

10.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified Invest igator will evaluate all adverse events as to: 
10.2.1. Seriousness 
An SAE is any  AE occurring at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (i e, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the Invest igator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death fro m the AE);
Requi res inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_24508] 
(hospi [INVESTIGATOR_208838] n, regardl ess of l ength of stay );
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y (a substant ial disrupt ion of the 
subject’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions);
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect;
Const itutes an important medical event.
Important m edical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately  life-
threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], or disabilit y, but may  jeopardi ze the subject or 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in decidi ng whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208839]:
a standard procedure for protocol therapy  administrati on.However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208840] a com plicat ion of therapy  adm inistrati on will be

must be completed.
For each SAE, the Invest igator will provide information on severit y, start and stop dates, 
relationship to the IP, action taken regarding the IP, and outcome.
10.2.2. Severity/In tensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator must assess the severit y/ intensity of the event. 
The severit y/intensity of AEs will  be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to the 
current active minor versio n of the Commo n Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, 
Versi on 4.03 or higher ); CRS is to be graded as per Appendix M.
AEs that are not defined in the CTCAE should be evaluate d for severi ty/intensit y according to 
the following scale or Versi on 3.0 of NCI CTCAE as in the case of TFR (refer to Table 41):
Grade 1 = Mild –transi ent or mild disco mfort; no limitat ion in act ivity; no m edical

Grade 2 = Moderate –mild to moderate limitat ion in activity, som e assista nce may  be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervent ion/therapy  required
Grade 3 = Severe –marked limitat ion in act ivity, som e assistance usually required;

Confident ial and Propri etary 225 Protocol JCAR017 -BCM -002 Amendment 6 Final : 27 Jan 2021The term  “severe” is often used to describe the intensit y of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarct ion); the event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache). This criterion is notthe sam e as “serious” which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s 
life or funct ioning.
Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a gui de for defining regul atory  obligat ions.
10.2.3. Causality
The Investigator must determine the relat ionship between the administration o f the LD 
chemotherapy, JCAR017 or the combinat ion agent and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not 
Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: a causal relat ionship of the adverse event to IP administration is 
unlikely or remote , orother m edicat ions, therapeutic 
intervent ions, or underlying condit ions provi de a sufficient 
explanat ion for the observed event.
Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP 
caused the adverse event. ‘Reasonable possibilit y’ means there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship between the IP and 
the adverse event.
Causalit y shoul d be assessed and provided for every  AE/SAE based on currently available 
inform ation.Causalit y is to be reassessed and provided as addit ional information beco mes 
available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or addit ional IP 
that has not been manufactured or provided by [CONTACT_27718], please provide the name [CONTACT_208924].
10.2.4. Dura tion
For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the

An abnormal laboratory  value is considered to be an AE ifthe abnorm ality:
resul ts in discont inuat ion from the study;
requi res treatm ent, m odificat ion/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervent ion; or
is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicit y, or is an exacerbat ion or worsening of an exist ing 
condi tion.
Regardless of severit y grade, only  laboratory  abnorm alities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.
If a laboratory  abnorm ality is one com ponent of a di agnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF. If the abnormalit y was not a 
part of a diagnosis or syndro me, then the laboratory abnormalit y shoul d be record ed as the AE. If 
possible, the laboratory  abnorm ality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnorm al laboratory  resul t (eg, record thrombocy topeni a rather than decreased platelets).
10.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (i ncluding elevated βhCG or posit ive pregnancy test) 
occurring at any  time after recei pt of lymphodepl eting chem otherapy  or infusi on of JCAR017 in 
either a f emale subject of childbearing potential or a partner of childbearing potential of a male

10.6. Potential Risks and Management of Treatment Toxicities
A summary  of potenti al risks and m anagement of treatment toxicit y is provided below. See the 
respective IB (US PI [INVESTIGATOR_514140] D) for a com plete discussi on of  potenti al risks associ ated wi th 
JCAR017 and combinat ion agent.
10.6.1. Management of Toxicities Associated with JCAR017
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicit ies (NT) are associated with CAR T cell 
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014]. Celgene has developed specific toxicit y management guidelines (TMG) for CRS and 
NT associated with Celgene cellular products based on current clinical experience across the 
clinical development programs ( Appendix M). Thes e recommendat ions are based on the CRS 
revised grading system ( Lee, 2014 ) and the Common Toxicit y Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) and need to be used for grading of CRS and NT to guide management in this trial. 
If availab le and adopted as per site standard practice, CRS and NT grading according to the 
American Societ y for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy  (ASTCT) Consensus Grading 
System  (Lee, 2019 ) shoul d also be recorded in the eCRF to in form future m odificati ons of  the 
management guidelines.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Cytokine Release Syndrome
Administrati on of JCAR017 is associated with cytokine release syndro me (CRS). Cytokine release 
syndro me is characteri zed by [CONTACT_242679], fatigue, nausea, headache, dyspnea, tachycardia, ri gors, 
hypotension, hypoxia, myalgia/arthralgia, and anorexia. Clinical symptom s and severi ty of CRS 
are highly variable (Lee, 2014), and management can be complicated by [CONTACT_304907].
With JCAR017, CRS usually occurs within two weeks after infusio n (Abramso n, 2017).
Fever, especially  high f ever ( ≥ 38.5°C or ≥ 101.3°F), is a commo nly-observed 
hallmark of CRS, and many  features of CRS mimic infection. Hence, infect ion must 
be considered in all subjects presenting wit h CRS symptoms and appropriate cultures 
must be obtained and empi[INVESTIGATOR_304852].
Less commo n symptom s associ ated wi th CRS include cardiac dysfunct ion, adul t 
respi [INVESTIGATOR_1505], renal and/or hepatic failure, coagulopathies, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, and capi[INVESTIGATOR_304853] e. 
Neurol ogic toxi city has been observed concurrent ly with CRS. 
With CAR T cell products, CRS has been reported in a f ew cases to be associated 
with findings of macrophage act ivation syndrome/hemophagocyt ic 
lymphohist iocytosis (MAS/HLH), and the physio logy of the syndrom es may overlap. 
Please refer to Appendix Mfor detailed descript ion of CRS, grading and treatment 
recommendat ions.

The possibilit y of CRS shoul d be considered for all subjects with fever ( ≥ 38°C or ≥ 100.4°F) 
following JCAR017 treatment. Subjects shoul d be m onitored cl osely  for hem odynamic 
instabilit y and changing neuro logic status. Febrile subjects, neutropenic or otherwise, should be 
evaluated promptly for infection and managed per inst itutional or standard clinical pract ice.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Cytopenias
Severe cytopenias, including anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocy topeni a, can occur 
with both JCAR017 and lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy ,and delayed recovery  has been 
observed . Com plete bl ood counts should be monit ored after JCAR017 infusio nuntil count

[IP_ADDRESS]. Infections
Life-threatening and fatal infect ions have been observed. Severe infect ions, m ay include 
bacteri al, fungal  (including pneumocystis jirovecii), and viral infections (eg, cytomegalovirus 
[CMV ], hepatit is B virus [ HBV ], respi [INVESTIGATOR_514141]). A high index of 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_24510] n is warranted in the event of prolonged or recurrent cy topenias, especially in 
conjunction with hypogammagl obuline mia, severe lymphopenia, and/or recent use of 
corticosteroi ds. Vi ral react ivation and other serious opportunist ic infect ions should be considered 
in these settings, and prophylact ic, pre -empt ive, or symptomat ic treatment with ant imicrobial, 
antifungal, ant i-pneumo cystic, and/or antiviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_514142] .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Neurologic Toxicities
CAR T cell therapy is associated with unique neurologic toxicit ies. Neurol ogic symptoms may 
include altered mental status, aphasia, al tered l evel of consciousness, and seizures or seizure- like 
activit y. With JCAR017, to date, the start of neurologic symptoms has been noted between 3 to 
23 day s (median 10 days) ( Abramson, 2017) after CAR T cell infusio n and i n severe cases may  
requi re admissio n to the intensive care unit (ICU) for frequent monitoring, respi[INVESTIGATOR_304856], or 
intubation for airway protecti on. The symptom s are variable generally occur as CRS is resolving 
or after CRS resolut ion.
Please refer to Appendix Mfor detailed descript ion of neurologic toxicit ies, grading and 
treatm ent recommendat ions.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Macrophage Activation Syndrome
Macrophage activat ion syndro me (MAS) is a serious disorder potentially associated with 
uncontrolled activation and proliferation of CAR T cells and subsequent activat ion of 
macrophages. MAS is ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_304857] -grade, non -remitt ing fever, cy topeni as, 
and hepat osplenomegaly. Laboratory  abnorm alities found in MAS include elevated 
inflammatory  cytokine l evels, serum  ferritin, so luble IL -2 receptor (sCD25), triglycerides, and 
decreased circulat ing NK cells. Other findings include variable levels o f transaminases, s igns of 
acute liver failure, coagulopathy , and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy . There are no

adult subjects tr eated with activated T cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Subjects treated with JCAR017 should be monitored for MAS, and cytokine -directed therapy  
shoul d be considered as clinically  indicated.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Infusion Reactions
Administrati on of  JCAR017 m ay cause infusio n reactions, such as fever, rigors, rash, urticaria, 
dyspnea, hypotension, and/or nausea.
To minimize the risk of infusion react ions, all subjects should be pre -medicated wi th 
acetaminophen and diphenhydramine. Mild infusio n reactions should be managed expectantly 
with antipyretics, ant ihistamines, and ant i-emet ics. Corti costeroi ds shoul d be avo ided because of 
the potenti al impact on efficacy  of infused JCAR017 cells. 
The fo llowing gui delines shoul d be f ollowed for infusio n reactions:
Grade 1: administer symptomat ic treatment ; continue JCAR017 administration of 
both CD8+ and CD4+ components at the same dose and rate 
Grade 2: stop administration of JCAR017; administer symptomatic treatment, and 
resum e JCAR017 administration of both CD8+ and CD4+ components at a reduced 
rate of administration only  after symptom s reso lution
Grade 3: stop administration of JCAR017, administer symptomatic treatment, and 
resum e at a reduced rate of administration only  after symptom s reso lve. If Grade 3 
reacti on recurs, discont inue JCAR017 administration; no further CD8+ or CD4+ 
components of JCAR017 should be administered
Grade 4: discontinue administration of JCAR017 and administer symptomat ic 
treatm ent as necessary; no further no further CD8+ or CD4+ components of 
JCAR017 should be administered
[IP_ADDRESS]. Tumor Lysis Syndrome
Both lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy and JCAR017 may cause tumor lysis syndro me (TLS) in 
subjects wi th high disease burden. Subjects should be closely  monitored f or laboratory  evidence 
of TLS (hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyp erphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia) (see 
Appendix L), and subjects at hi gh risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_237422], such as those wi th high disease 
burden and high cel l turnover, shoul d receive prophylact ic treatment including administra tion of  
allopurino l and hydrat ion,per standard clinical practice.
[IP_ADDRESS]. B-cell Aplasia
B-cell aplasia is an expected potential o ff-tumor, on -target toxi city. Prol onged B -cell aplasia has 
been observed in other CD19- directed CAR T cell programs ( Davila, 2013 ;Grupp, 2013 ). Serum 
immunogl obulin levels will be obtained fro m all subjects prior to and at various time points 
following JCAR017 treatment. Hy pogammagl obulinemic subjects (serum immunoglobulin G 
(IgG) < 500 mg/dL) should be considered for intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy  
per institutional guidelines.

an immune -related eti ology shoul d be considered for signs or symptoms of enterocolit is, 
derm atitis, hepat itis, and endocrinopathy.
In addit ion to the dose modif ications shown in Appendix C, it is recommended that management 
of irAEs follow the gui delines outlined for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] ( Weber, 2012 ). These guidelines 
recommend the fo llowing:
Subjects should be evaluated to ident ify any alternative et iology
In the absence of clear alternat ive et iology, all events of an inflammatory  nature 
shoul d be considered to be immune- related
Symptom atic and topi [INVESTIGATOR_348838] d be considered for low -grade events
Systemic corti costeroi ds shoul d be considered for a persistent low -grade event or for 
a severe event
More potent immunosuppressives should be considered for events not responding to 
systemi c steroi ds (eg, infliximab, mycopheno late, etc).
If the invest igator has any quest ion in regard to an AE being an irAE, the investigator should 
immediately  contact [CONTACT_1034]’s medical monitor.
Dose m odificat ions (ie, dose interruption, dose hold, or infusio n rate m odificati on) of  
durvalumab may be required in the event of treatment related toxicit y. See Appendix C,
Appendix DandAppendix Efor detailed instructions for durvalumab dose modificat ions and 
toxicity management.
Administrati on of  durvalumab may  cause infusi on reacti ons, such as fever, rigors, rash, urticaria,

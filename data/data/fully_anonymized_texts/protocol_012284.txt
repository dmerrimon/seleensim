Randomized Controlled Trial

Study Aims  
Research Key Question:  
Does the addition of dexmedetomidine to a ropi[INVESTIGATOR_211726], improve epi[INVESTIGATOR_211727] a solution combining clonidine with ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], or a 
solution combining fentanyl with ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]?  
Hypotheses:  
We hypothesize that the addition of dexmedetomidine to a ropi[INVESTIGATOR_211728] a solution combining clonidine with ropi[INVESTIGATOR_211729].  
1. Background:  
In the current practice, the standardized epi[INVESTIGATOR_211730] a local anesthetic with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]. The addition of opi[INVESTIGATOR_211731]. They also act by 
[CONTACT_211766].  
 
The addition of opi[INVESTIGATOR_211732] a standard 
of practice in North America. Although the literature advocates for this practice, a small proportion of 
patients may benefit from a different approach.  
Patients with chronic pain and chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_211733] 60 mg a day for 7 
days or longer. 5 Another population that could possibly benefit from this approach are parturient that are 
diagnosed with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427]. These patients often develop opi[INVESTIGATOR_211734]. Experts’ consensus advocates for a multimodal approach in this population.   
Moreover, some patients are consuming medication to treat opi[INVESTIGATOR_211735]. These medications have an impact on the pharmacokinetics of opi[INVESTIGATOR_211736].  
Tailoring the approach to labor pain management in the population of parturient that are at risk for 
complex pain management is the cornerstone to an individualized approach, leading to optimal care. This 
approach may be achieved by [CONTACT_211767][INVESTIGATOR_211737]. For 
example, clonidine is an alpha-2- adrenergic agonist that has been extensively studied in the context of 
neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia  
Addition of clonidine to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_211738]. It offers a dose- sparing action of local anesthetics while 
increasing the duration of sensory blockade. It is also widely used for post -operative pain management 
after various pediatric surgical procedures and has shown a reassuring safety profile in this population.  
A systematic review and meta- analysis evaluated the effects of neuraxial clonidine added to local 
anesthetics in women admitted for caesarean section under neuraxial anesthesia. Their conclusions show 
that intrathecal clonidine reduced [ADDRESS_253721]. 
Neuraxial clonidine increased the incidence of intraoperative hypotension defined as a 20% reduction from 
the pre- anesthetic baseline systolic blood pressure. This augmentation of the intraoperative hypotension 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_211739], which leads us to think that this hypotension was not clinically significant. Moreover, the usage of neuraxial 
clonidine did not negatively impact neonatal umbilical artery pH or Apgar scores.  
Clonidine added to ropi[INVESTIGATOR_211740] a longer duration 
of analgesia and a reduction of the total ropi[INVESTIGATOR_211741] [ADDRESS_253722] also found a 
benefit in the quality of analgesia offered by [CONTACT_211768][INVESTIGATOR_211742].  
A meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials reviewed the effects of epi[INVESTIGATOR_211743]. Nine studies were included in the qualitative 
synthesis presented in this meta- analysis. The group arrived to the conclusion that “epi[INVESTIGATOR_211744] oﬀ er a better analgesic eﬀ ect than placebo, similar labor pain control 
to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and has no deﬁ nite adverse eﬀ ects on the parturient or fetus, but more high- quality studies are 
needed to conﬁrm these conclusions.”  
 
The usage of dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to epi[INVESTIGATOR_211745] a subject of great 
interest in the last few years. Zhao and al. performed a RCT with 80 laboring patients that received an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_211746] (0.125%) alone or combined with dexmedetomidine 
(0.5 mg/kg) as bolus. This anesthetic regimen that included dexmedetomidine reduced the pain scores at most time intervals evaluated after epi[INVESTIGATOR_211747]. It is also reassuring to see that other outcome such as 
the duration of the ﬁrst and second stage of labor, the rate of instrumental delivery and cesarean section, Apgar scores, umbilical artery pH, maternal motor blockade scores, intensity of maternal sedation, and the 
incidence of maternal complicati ons did not show signiﬁcant di ﬀerence between the two studied groups.  
Selim and al. carried out a study where they evaluated the impact of dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_211748] a standard fentanyl – bupi[INVESTIGATOR_211749]. They aimed to explore uterine artery 
pulsatility index and umbilical artery pulsatility index during uterine contractions and relaxations. They were able to show that the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] – dexmedetomidine group had a shorter onset of analgesia and an 
increased duration of analgesia. Their analysis of the uterine artery pulsatility index and umbilical artery pulsatility index showed that dexmedetomidine did not induce any deleterious effects of uteroplacental 
circulation or neonatal outcomes.  
Zhang and al. did show that the combination of dexmedetomidine with ropi[INVESTIGATOR_211750] a control group that received a ropi[INVESTIGATOR_211751]. Moreover, the duration of the first and second stage of labor, the mode of delivery and the Apgar 
scores and umbilical arterial pH after birth were similar between both groups. Finally, side effects such as 
hypotension, bradycardia and pruritus were also similar between both cohorts.  
Dexmedetomidine has been used as an adjuvant to epi[INVESTIGATOR_211752]. It has 
also been compared to clonidine to evaluate the benefits of this novel molecule compared to clonidine 
which has been on the market for a few decades. Dexmedetomidine is a better neuraxial adjuvant 
compared to clonidine since it provides early onset of sensory analgesia superior intraoperative analgesia, 
a prolonged postoperative analgesia while offering stability of the cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_108951] . 
The intrathecal administration of dexmedetomidine in a cohort of patients admitted for lower limb 
surgery is associated with prolonged sensory and motor block, hemodynamic stability, and a reduction in 
the consumption of rescue analgesics in 24h period as compared to clonidine, fentanyl, or bupi[INVESTIGATOR_211753]. When comparing dexmedetomidine to clonidine as adjuvants to local anesthetics in labor analgesia, 
it seems that both molecules offer an excellent quality of analgesia and a great safety profile. However, 
dexmedetomidine has shown a faster onset of analgesia a prolonged analgesia and a decrease in the time 
to achieve maximal analgesia.  
2. Significance/Rationale:  (Why is the question worth pursuing? Will it reduce complications or costs, 
improve outcome, change practice?)  
This study is significant because it can potentially alternative non- opi[INVESTIGATOR_211754]. The opi[INVESTIGATOR_211755]. These trends have resulted in new questions about 
alternative epi[INVESTIGATOR_211756] (e.g., fentanyl and sufentanil) because: 1) 
many people with OUD desire to avoid opi[INVESTIGATOR_211757]; and 2) 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_211758].  
Regarding the scope of the problem: A retrospective study evaluated the incidence of maternal 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_211759] a database that compi[INVESTIGATOR_211760] 7.4 million discharges in 44 states. It shows 
that the maternal consumption of opi[INVESTIGATOR_211761] a 9- year observation period 
(2000- 2009)57 while others report prevalence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_211762] 127% 
from 1998 to 2011. 58 It is estimated that 4.5% of pregnant women aged 15– 44 years are using illicit or 
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], which emphasizes the importance of this issue.  
 
Tailoring the approach to labor pain management in the population of parturient that are at risk for 
complex pain management is the cornerstone to an individualized approach, leading to optimal care. This 
approach may potentially be achieved by [CONTACT_211767][INVESTIGATOR_211763], two alpha2- adrenergic agonists.  
Some existing literature suggests that dexmedetomidine and clonidine are adjuncts to local 
anesthetics that offer a faster onset and a better quality of analgesia for patients requiring labor analgesia. 
Further studies are required to precise the dosage and regimens in a population of laboring patients.

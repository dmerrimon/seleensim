Study Design This is a single-mask ed, 2×3 crossover, randomized-
controlled, dispensing clinical trial. Approximately 70 myopic eligible subjects will be targeted to complete the study.  Eligible subjects will be randomized and fit at Visit 1 in astudy lens based on the randomization scheme. Subjects will 
be dispensed lenses at Visit 1 for 3±1 day, then undergo 
optimization (Visit 2). Subjects will wear the optimized pair for approximately 1 week (7±1 day). After approximately 1-week of wear, (Visit 3) the study endpoints will be measured and subjects will be fit in the 2
nd study lens. The visits will be 
repeated wearing the 2ndstudy lens (Visit 3 Fit/Visit 4 
Optimization/Visit 5 Follow up). At Visit 5 the subjects will be fit in the 3
rdstudy lens that match the same power they were 
dispensed at Visit 4 and wore to Visit 5, and wear the lensesfor 1 week (7±1 day). After approximately 1-week of wear, (Visit 6) the study endpoints w ill be measured and the subject 
will be exited from the study. 
See the flow chart at the e nd of the synopsis table for the 
schematic of the study visits and procedures of main 
observations (Figure 1).

3.4. Enrollment Strategy
Study subjects will be recruited from the Institution/clinical site’s subject database and/or 
utilizing Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved materials. 
4. STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE
4.1. Description of Study Design
This is a 6-visit, subject-masked, multi-site, 2×3 crossover dispensing trial. Approximately 80 
subjects will be enrolled with an aim of approximately 70 subje cts to complete the study.  
The study begins with an initial visit (Visit 1). If a subject is found to meet all eligibility criteria, 
they will be randomized to one of two lens wear sequences (Test/Control/Control or 
Control/Test/Test) in a bilateral fashion.  
If the subject is dispensed study lenses at the initial visit, five additional visits will be 
conducted. The first follow-up visit (Visit 2) will occur 3 ± [ADDRESS_18422] s will wear the study lenses for 
7 ± 1 days and then will return for their second follow-up at V isit 3.  At Visit 3, subjects will 
CR-6413, v 2.0

Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
be dispensed their second study lens per the randomization sche dule. Subjects will return for 
their first follow-up visit (Visit 4) 3 ± 1 days after Visit 3, for lens optimization. Subjects will 
return for their second follow-up visit 7 ± [ADDRESS_18423] study lens per the randomization schedule an d wear the lens for (7±1 days). 
At the follow-up (Visit 6) the endpoints will again be measured a nd the subject will be exited 
from the study. 
4.2. Study Design Rationale 
Crossover designs are a well-es tablished study design in which subjects are exposed to multiple 
treatments during different time periods.  A 2×[ADDRESS_18424] Article Allocation 
The study lenses will be worn in a  bilateral and random fashion  using a 2×3 crossover design. 
A computer-generated randomizati on scheme will be used to rando mly assign subjects, in 
blocks of 4, to one of the two possible lens wear sequences: Test/Control/Control or Control/Test/Test. The random scheme will be generated using th e PROC PLAN procedure 
from Statistical Analysis System  (SAS) Software Version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC).
The study site must follow the ra ndomization scheme provided an d complete enrollment per 
the randomization list and not pre- select or assign subjects.  The randomized assignment of 
subjects will be performed at the first visit prior to the firs t fitting.  The following must have 
occurred prior to randomization: 
oInformed consent has been obtained 
oSubject meets all the incl usion / exclusion criteria
oSubject history and baseline inf ormation has been collected.
5.2. Masking
This is a single-masked study with the subjects being masked.  The term partial masking is 
being used as subjects will not be told any information regardi ng the optical designs of the 
lenses beyond that they are inte nded to correct for their refra ctive error and presby[CONTACT_19555], 
CR-6413, v 2.0  
 
Page 22 of 230JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
however there are slight differe nces in the tint of the lenses which is impossible to mask from 
the subject.    
Under normal circumstances, the mask should not be broken until  all subjects have completed 
the study and the database is fi nalized. Otherwise, the mask should be broken only if specific 
emergency treatment/course of ac tion would be dictated by [CONTACT_19559]. In such cases, the Investigator may, in an emergency, contact [CONTACT_7195].  In 
the event the mask is broken, th e Sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, 
time, and reason for the unmasking must be documented in the subject record. The Investigator 
is also advised not to reveal the study treatment assignment to  the clinical site or Sponsor 
personnel.  
Subjects who have had their tr eatment assignment unmasked are e xpected to return for all 
remaining scheduled evaluati ons.  Subjects who are discontinued  may be replaced.
5.3. Procedures for Maintaini ng and Breaking the Masking
The test articles mask shall not be broken unless information c oncerning the lens type is 
necessary for the urgent medical treatment of a subject. The Sp onsor must be notified before 
the mask is broken. When dispensing test articles, t he following steps should be fo llowed to maintain
randomization codes: 
1. Investigator or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) w ill consult the lens 
fitting schedule/randomi zation scheme to obtai n the test articl e assignment for that 
subject prior to dispensing. 
2. Investigator or designee will record the subject’s number on the appropriate line of the 
randomization scheme if applicable
3. Investigator or designee will pull the appropriate test artic les from the study supply. 
All test articles that are opened, whether dispensed (placed/fi t on eye or dispensed 
outside the clinical site) or not , must be recorded on the Test  Article Accountability 
Log in the “Dispensed” section.

12. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC)  refers to any written, electr onic, or oral communication 
that alleges deficiencies rel ated to the identity, quality, dur ability, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness or performance of test articles after they have b een released for clinical trial use.  
Potential complaints may come from a variety of sources includi ng but not limited to subjects, 
clinical research associates (CRA), clinical operations manager s (COM), medical monitors, 
and site personnel, etc. The following are not considered produ ct quality complaints: 
xSubject satisfaction inquiries r eported via “Subjective Question naires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO).” 
xClinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged af ter receipt at the 
investigational site.
xLens replacements that occu r due to drops/fall-outs. 
xDamage deemed by [CONTACT_19567], 
and not indicative of a quality deficiency (i.e. tears, rips, e tc.), only in situations where 
there is no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_423]. 
Within [ADDRESS_18449] be 
recorded in the EDC system, which will trigger an automatic ema il notification to the 
appropriate COM/CRA and Clinical QA representative. In cases wh ere the EDC system in use 
is not configured to send automa tic notifications or when an ED C system is not used, the 
COM/CRA is responsible for no tifying Clinical QA upon discovery  that a PQC has occurred.   
Upon receipt of the EDC notific ation, the COM/CRA will contact [CONTACT_19568]:  
xDate the complaint was received/recorded in the EDC System (Dat e of Sponsor 
Awareness). 
xWho received the complaint. 
xStudy number. 
xClinical site information (c ontact name, site ID, telephone num ber). 
xLot number(s). 
xUnique Subject Identifier(s). 
xIndication of who first observed c omplaint (site personnel or s ubject). 
xOD/OS indication, along with wheth er the lens was inserted. 
xAny related AE number if applicable. 
xDetailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled visit, we ar time, symptoms, 
resolution of symptoms, etc.). 
CR-6413, v 2.0  
 
Page 65 of 230JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xEye Care Provider objective (slit lamp) findings if applicable.  
xConfirmation of product availability for return (and tracking i nformation, if available), 
or rationale if product is not a vailable for return (Refer to Fo rm Control No. VWI-[ADDRESS_18450] article r eturn instructions).
Once a complaint is received, it will be assessed by [CONTACT_19569], C RA, or trained site personnel 
to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event (A E/SAE). If the complaint 
results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or trained site personnel wi ll follow Section 13 of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was pot entially the result of a product quality related deficiency, these 
procedures also applies and w ill be executed in parallel.   
In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_779] i n error. In this event, the 
PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Blank” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must be 
documented. 
13. ADVERSE EVENTS
13.1. Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event (AE) – An AE is “any untoward medical  occurrence, unintended disease  or 
injury, or untoward clinical si gns (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users 
or other persons, whether or not r elated to the investigational medical device.  
This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device or the 
comparator, and to the procedures involved. Fo r users or other persons, this definition is 
restricted to events related to  investigational medical devices1
An AE includes any condition ( including a pre-existing conditio n) that: 
1. Was not present prior to the study, but appeared or reappeare d following initiation of 
the study. 
2. Was present prior to the s tudy, but worsened during the study . This would include any 
condition resulting from concomita nt illnesses, reactions to co ncomitant medications, 
or progression of disease states. 
3. Pregnancy must be documented as an adverse event and must be reported to the clinical 
monitor and to the Sponsor immediately upon learning of the eve nt. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – An SAE is any adverse event that led to any of the following: 
xDeath
xSerious deterioration in the hea lth of the subject that resulte d in any of the following: 
xLife-threatening illness or injury 
xPermanent or persistent impai rment of a body structure or a bod y function 
xHospi[INVESTIGATOR_19530]-threatening il lness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body s tructure or a body function. 
xChronic disease 
xFetal distress, fetal death or a  congenital physical or mental im pairment of birth defect.

xContact [CONTACT_19574] e xplicitly defined as se rious or signific ant adverse event, which 
necessitates temporary len s discontinuation < [ADDRESS_18452] (ADE) – An ADE is an “adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.
NOTE 1: to entry: This definition includes adverse events resulting from  insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use , deployment, implantation, inst allation, or operation, or 
any malfunction of the inves tigational medical device. 
NOTE 2 to entry: This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from 
intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.”[ADDRESS_18453] (UADE) – Any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or a ssociated with, the test article, 
if that effect, problem, or deat h was not previously identified  in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan, Investigator’s Brochure or protocol, or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with the test article that relates to the rights, safety 
and welfare of subjects.
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Investigator will evaluate adverse events to ensure 
the events are categorized corre ctly. Elements of  categorizatio n will include: 
xSeriousness/Classifications ( see definition in Section 13.1). 
xCausality or Relatedness – i.e. the relationship between the tes t article, study treatment 
or study procedures and the adverse event (not related; unlikel y related; possibly
related; related - see  definition in Section 13.2.1). 
xAdverse Event Severity – Adverse event severity is used to asses s the degree of 
intensity of the adverse event (mild; moderate; severe for all e vents - see definition in 
Section 0). 
xOutcome – not recovered or not r esolved; recovering or resolving; recovered or 
resolved with sequelae; recovered or resolved; death related to a dverse event;
unknown. 
xActions Taken – none; temporaril y discontinued; permanently discontinued; other. 
13.2.1. Causality Assessment
Causality Assessment – A determination of the relationship between an adverse event a nd the 
test article. The test article relationship for each adverse ev ent should be determined by [CONTACT_19575]: 
xNot Related- An adverse event that is not related to the use of  the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures. 
xUnlikely Related – An adverse event for which an alternative ex planation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatment , concomitant disease(s), or the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal relationship is not likely. 
CR-6413, v 2.0  
 
Page 68 of 230JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xPossibly Related – An adverse even t that might be due to the use  of the test article, or 
to the study treatment or study pr ocedures. An alternative expl anation, e.g. concomitant 
treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relatio nship in time is 
reasonable. Therefore, the causa l relationship cannot be exclud ed. 
xRelated – An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (device) or adverse 
reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_19576], e.g.
concomitant treatment of concomitant disease(s). The relationsh ip in time is very 
suggestive, e.g. it is  confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]-c hallenge and re-challen ge. 
13.2.2. Severity Assessment
Severity Assessment – A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adve rse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_19578]. The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of  test article, study treatment or study procedure relationship or 
seriousness of the event and s hould be evaluated according to t he following scale: 
xMild – Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerat ed and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.
xModerate – Event is bothersome, possible requiring additional th erapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.
xSevere – Event is intolerable, n ecessitates additional therapy o r alteration of therapy 
and interferes with the s ubject’s daily activities. 
13.3. Documentation and Follow-Up of Adverse Events
The recording and documenting of adverse events (ocular and non -ocular) begin when the 
subjects are exposed to the test  article, study treatment or study procedure.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test  article, start of study treatme nt, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the condition deterior ates at any time during the study 
it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medical eve nts reported after the subject’s 
exit from the study will be recorded as adverse events at the d iscretion of the Investigator. 
Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_19535]. H e/she will complete the Adver se Event /eCRF.  
Complete descriptions of all adverse events must be available i n the subject record. All 
Adverse Events including local a nd systemic reactions not meeti ng the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the appropriate case repor t form or electronic data system. 
All adverse events occurring while the subject is enrolled in the study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship.   
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain documentati on of each reported adverse event. 
All adverse events will be followed in accordance with applicab le licensing requirements. Such 
documentation will incl ude the following: 
xAdverse event (diagnosis not symptom). 
xDrawings or photographs (where a ppropriate) that detail the fin ding (e.g., size, 
location, and depth, etc.).

In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she will comple te the Corneal Infiltrate Assessment 
eCRF. Where necessary, a culture of the corneal lesion will be collected to determine if the 
infection is microbial in nature. If cultures are collected, th e date of culture collection and 
laboratory utilized will be recorded.  
Changes in the severity of an AE shall be documented to allow a n assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Advers e events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of the onset and duration of  each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the 
assessment of relationship to t he Test Article shall also be cl early documented.
Subjects who present with an adverse event shall be followed by  [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have returned to pre-tr eatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved. If further treatment beyond licen sure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provider. The Invest igator will use his/her clinical 
judgment as to whether a subject  reporting with an adverse even t will continue in the study. If 
a subject is discontinued from the study, it will be the responsibility of the Investigator to 
record the reason for discontinuation. The Investigator will als o document the adverse event 
appropriately and comp lete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjects  with ongoing adverse 
events related to the test ar ticle, study treatment or study pr ocedures, as of the final study visit 
date, should be followed to resol ution of the adverse event or until referral to an appropriate 
health care provider, as recommended by [CONTACT_737]. Non-o cular adverse events that are 
not related to the test article , study treatment, or study proc edures may be recorded as 
“ongoing” without further follow-up. 
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events 
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by e-mail, facsimile, or telephone as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery f or any serious /significant 
adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non-significa nt adverse event. In addition, 
a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_19579] r to the IEC/IRB according to 
their requirements (Section 13.4.2) . The report will comment wh ether the adverse event was 
considered to be related to the  test article, study treatment o r study procedures.

13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor 
Serious/Significant Adverse Events
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of all serious/signifi cant adverse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possible by e-mail, fax, or telephone, but no later than 24 
hours following discovery of the event. The Investigator is obl igated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor in addition to that information reported on the eCRF. All 
subjects experiencing a serious/s ignificant adverse event must be followed up and all outcomes 
must be reported. 
When medically necessary, the Investigator may break the random ization code to determine 
the identity of the treatment that the subject received. The Sp onsor and study monitor should 
be notified prior to unmasking the test articles. In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Invest igator must: 
xNotify the Sponsor immediately.
xObtain and maintain in the subject’s records all pertinent medi cal information and 
medical judgment for colleagues wh o assisted in the treatment a nd follow-up of the 
subject.
xProvide the Sponsor with a comple te case history which includes  a statement as to 
whether the event was or was not  related to the use of the test  article. 
xNotify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB reporting procedu re according to 
national regulations. 
Unanticipated (Serious) Adv erse Device Effect (UADE)
In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effec t (UADE), the Investigator 
will submit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no later 
than [ADDRESS_18454] rep ort the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB a nd participating Investigators within [ADDRESS_18455]. 
Non-Serious Adverse Events
All non-serious adverse events, including non-serious adverse d evice effects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_19580] 2 days from di scovery. 
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to t he Responsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities
Adverse events that meet the I EC/IRB requirements for reporting  must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site will refer to an d follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19582]. 
The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events to the local h ealth authorities according the 
written guidelines, includi ng reporting timelines.

13.5. Reporting of Pregnancy 
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270]-report) during the study will be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event. Once discontinued, pregn ant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitored for study related purposes. Pregn ant participants are not 
discontinued from contact [CONTACT_19583], but due to 
general concerns relating to pre gnancy and contact [CONTACT_19584]. Sp ecifically, pregnant women are 
discontinued due to fluctuations  in refractive error and/or vis ual acuity that occur secondary to 
systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unforeseen health risks to the mother or fetus. 
14. STATISTICAL METHODS
14.1. General Considerations
Statistical Analysis will b e undertaken by [CONTACT_19585]. A 
general description of the sta tistical methods to be implemente d in this clinical trial is outlined 
below.
All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed u sing the SAS software Version 
9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Throughout the analysis of data, the results for each 
subject/eye will be used when a vailable for summarization and statistical analysis. 
Unscheduled visits will be summarized separately and will be ex cluded from the statistical 
analysis.
Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables)  will be provided for all baseline 
variables, efficacy variables and safety variables as appropria te. Continuous variables will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard devia tion [SD], median, minimum 
and maximum). Freque ncy count and percentage of subjects or eye s within each category will 
be provided for categorical data.
 
Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_19586] (Test and Control ) and will be performed 
separately by [CONTACT_19587] (Safety Population, Per-Protocol Population or Intent-to-Treat 
Population). 
14.2. Sample Size Justification
This study was designed and powered to demonstrate that the bino cular high luminance high 
contrast, visual performance (logMAR) of the Test lens at dista nce (4 meters) is statistically 
lower than 0.00 logMAR and statistically lower than 0.17 logMAR  at intermediate (64 cm) 
and near (40 cm) after1-week of lens wear. Historical data for t he Test lens with respect to 
visual acuity is presente d in the Table below.

Visual Performance (logMAR)
Sample size calculation for Visual performance (logMAR) was car ried out using Monte Carlo 
simulation methods using PROC IML. One-thousand boot strap samp les were simulated based 
on the historical data in Table [ADDRESS_18456] not be evaluated together in the same clinical study. For each 
replicated sample a linear mixed model was used; lens was inclu ded as the only fixed effect.  
A variance component (VC) covari ance structure was used to mode l measurements from the 
same subject across study periods . Seventy subjects to complete  provides at least 90% power 
to meet all primary hypotheses (Dist ance, Intermediate and Near)  associated with visual 
performance.
CLUE Vision Scores
This study Historical CLUE visi on scores for the Control lens ( Dailies Total 1®Multifocal

acceptable continue with the fit assessment and dispensing as p er the protocol.  
If the vision is not acceptable, ensure that the proper initial  lens power was selected by [CONTACT_746] a 
distance over-refraction with +/- 0.25D trial lenses (or flippe rs) to determine if a change in the initial 
lens power is required (note:  the over-refraction should be pe rformed outside of the phoropter in 
normal room illumination).  Recheck both distance and near visi on with the over-refraction in place.  
If a change in the initial lens power is not required refer to the fitting steps listed below in step 2 
(table 2).

study intervention will be discontinued, and study follow-up wi ll be conducted as outlined in the protocol.  
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the additional risks listed below need to be considered for study participants 
and study personnel:
Additional Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic:
xThe possible transmission of the Coronavirus infection and consequent complications, beyond the 
risk of adverse events due to the investigational device and/or  procedures. 
xThe risk may be higher in an optometric clinical study because of  the close contact [CONTACT_19608] a ssessments (since the investigator
must make the measurements close  to the subject’s face) and, in addition the need for multiple 
follow-up visits/exams which may expose the subject to other pa tients and/or healthcare 
professionals who might be transmitting the virus, even if they  do not have symptoms.
xPotential disruptions to the st udy may be necessary due to curr ent or future pandemic-related 
emergency restrictions, which may lead to delays in scheduled fo llow-up visits.
xSubjects experiencing an adverse event related to contact [CONTACT_13293] w ear may receive delayed treatment 
due to COVID-[ADDRESS_18472] contracted COVID-19 during pa rticipation in a study, he/she will be 
discontinued from the  study and followed until COVID-19 Adverse Event (AE) resolution.
To help minimize the above potential risks, JJVCI recommend revi ewing/complying with local, state, 
and governmental guidance for COVID-19 risks.

It is recognized that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) p andemic may have an impact on the conduct 
of this clinical study due to, for example, self-isolation/quar antine by [CONTACT_19611]-site personnel; 
travel restrictions/limited access to public places, including Optometry Clinics; and changes in clinic 
procedures required to address the COVID-19 challenge.
Every effort should be made to adhere to protocol-specified ass essments for study participants, including 
follow-up. However, if scheduled visits cannot be conducted in person at the study site it is suggested that 
assessments be performed to the extent possible remotely/virtua lly or delayed until such time that on-site 
visits can be resumed in order to continue participant monitorin g in accordance with the protocol where 
possible. At each contact, participants will be interviewed to c ollect safety data. Key efficacy endpoint 
assessments should be performed if required and as feasible.
Modifications to protocol-required assessments may be permitted  via COVID-19 Appendix after consultation 
with the participant, investigator, and the sponsor. Missed ass essments/visits will be captured in the clinical 
trial management system for protocol deviations. Interruptions of test article wear or discontinuations of 
study interventions and withdrawal from the study should be doc umented with the prefix “COVID-19-
related” in the case report form (CRF).
The sponsor will continue to monitor the conduct and progress o f the clinical study, and any changes will be 
communicated to the sites and to  the health authorities accordi ng to local guidance.  
If a participant has tested positive for COVID-19, the investiga tor should contact [CONTACT_456]’s responsible 
medical monitor to discuss initial plans for study intervention  and follow-up. The medical monitor will 
notify the Safety Management Team of any subject(s) that have r eported “COVID-19”, “Asymptomatic 
COVID-19”, or “Suspected COVID-19” adverse events within [ADDRESS_18475] as a result of the COVI D-19 pandemic will be summarized in the

1 Introduction  
 
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) afflicts millions of older Americans and is 
associated with exercise intolerance, reduced quality of life (QOL), high health care costs, and increased mortality. People with HFpEF display increased cardiac filling pressures and inadequate cardiac output reserve to deliver blood to the body during exercise. Numerous lines of evidence  
have implicated abnormalities in nitric oxide -cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO - cGMP) 
signaling as playing a key role in promoting these abnormalities. While there is currently no proven effective medical treatment for  HFpEF, exercise training (ET) has been shown to improve aerobic 
capacity and QOL in this population. 
 
However, ET provides benefits through peripheral effects in the muscles and vasculature, without 
targeting the cardiac limitations . The specific objectiv es of this application are to determine 
whether treatment with sodium nitrite (which improves the cardiac abnormalities) in addition to ET can improve exercise capacity, chronic activity levels, and QOL in people with HFpEF as compared to ET alone. The guiding hypothesis is that enhancing NO-cGMP signaling in the heart and periphery preferentially during exercise will improve functional capacity and symptoms in HFpEF above and beyond what is seen with ET alone. Conversion of nitrite (NO
2-) to biologically 
active NO is enhanced during tissue hypoxia and acidosis, which develop during low -level exercise 
in HFpEF, so it is expected that this intervention will preferentially target the cardiac limitations that develop during exercise in these patients at the tim e of greatest  need.  
 
T

accordance with the applicable [LOCATION_002] government regulations and Mayo Clinic research policies and procedures. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_510981] modification to the protocol  two main changes were made: (1) we changed 
the route of administration of sodium nitrite from inhaled to oral, and (2) we have decreased the duration of intervention for endpoint assessment from [ADDRESS_510982] Stage of the study, and we are changing the randomization ratio to 2:[ADDRESS_510983] Stage of the study, nitrite/placebo was administered in an inhaled formulation. However during the enrollment period, development of this product was discontinued by [CONTACT_3455]. In order to test the primary study hypotheses, we have switched from an inhaled formulation of nitrite to an oral formulation that achieves similar pharmacokinetics for Stage 2 of the study. 
 
 Since that time, the research pharmacy that was compounding our study drug (Triangle Pharmacy) has ceased production, forcing us to identify and work with a new pharmacy (RXQ) which has

 introduced a very large delay because of the longer start  up process, and the need for additional 
batch testing.  After one shipment was received, RXQ Pharmacy failed to deliver further shipments 
of study drug and has not met production requirements, forcing us to again change the compounding pharmacy to The University of Iowa Pharmaceuticals (Iowa City, Iowa; uip.pharmacy.uiowa.edu). Potency and stability testing will  be performed at University of 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_405337] [ADDRESS_510985] the response to inhaled and oral placebo to differ, we feel that this is scientifically justified.    Therefore, we will only require complete data from another 17 patients receiving oral placebo (for a combined total of 34 placebo patients) and another 34 patients receiving oral nitrite, for a total of 51 patients in the oral phase with complete data.  Because more data is needed for pa tients 
randomized to nitrite, we will randomize patients in a 2:[ADDRESS_510986] protocol modification (on oral drug, which has 
been very well -tolerated). Therefore, at this t ime we  will require complete data on another 47 
patients.  To allow for participant drop out and incomplete  data, we will enroll up to another 60 
patients to meet our goal of reaching another 47 with complete data.  
1.1 Background 
Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_405338]. 
Half of people with HF have preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), for which there is currently no proven effective treatment. People with HFpEF often have normal heart filling pressur es at rest, 
but with exercise develop marked increases in heart filling pressures with blunted increases in cardiac output (CO). These are termed “central” (cardiac) limitations to exercise.  
 
Exercise training (ET) has been shown to improve aerobic capacity and quality of life (QOL) in HFpEF, but the weight of evidence indicates that ET works predominantly by [CONTACT_358056] “peripheral” limitations in the muscle and blood vessels, with little direct cardiac effect. This 
suggests that treatments targeting central limitations that develop with exercise may allow for greater benefit from ET in HFpEF. 
 
Recent studies have identified abnormal nitric oxide -cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO - 
cGMP) signalin g as a lynchpin mechanism underlying cardiac abnormalities in HFpEF. Direct NO 
donors such as organic nitrates have not improved chronic activity levels in HFpEF but are limited by [CONTACT_405370]- tolerance and by [CONTACT_405371]. What is needed is an NO -cGMP enhancing agent 
that selectively targets central cardiac limitations preferentially during exercise, without untoward effects on resting cardiovascular homeostasis. Coupling of such an agent to ET may allow for synergistic benefit. Because both central and peripheral limitations will be targeted, people with HFpEF could potentially tolerate ET better, with fewer symptoms, increased daily activity levels,

 and improved adher ence to exercise prescription.  
 
The specific objectives of this application are to determine whether treatment with sodium nitrite 
(NO 2-) in addition to ET can improve exercise capacity, activity levels, and QOL in people with 
HFpEF, as compared to ET alone. The guiding hypothesis is that enhancing NO -cGMP signaling 
in the heart and periphery during exercise will improve functional capacity and symptoms in 
HFpEF. This hypothesis is based upon work from our group showing that exercise capacity in HFpEF is li mited by [CONTACT_405372]. 
Importantly, conversion of NO
2- to biologically active NO is enhanced with tissue hypoxia and 
acidosis developi[INVESTIGATOR_405339], suggesting that NO 2- may preferentially target hemodynamic 
perturbations at the time of greatest need, with less effect at rest. Thus NO 2- may allow for 
improved tolerance and adherence to ET in HFpEF. Successful completion of this project will enable understanding of the effects enhancing NO signaling through a novel, previously unexplored pathway, to synergize with ET to improve morbidity and QOL in people with HFpEF.  
 
Background related to Aim 1. 
Exercise capacity, quantified by [CONTACT_405373]
2 attained during exercise, is severely reduced in 
HFpEF.4, 9, 13, 14 According to the Fick principle; VO [ADDRESS_510988] of cardiac output 
(CO) and arterial venous O 2 content difference (A -V O 2diff). Haykowsky et al. have observed that 
reduced peak VO [ADDRESS_510989] emerged as important players.9, 19, 20, 33- 35 Acute 
increases in NO -cGMP activity are associated with systemic and pulmonary arterial and venous 
vaso-dilation, enabling LV and right ventricular (RV) afterload reduction, reduction in cardiac 
filling pressures and pulmonary pressures, improved flow -mediated dilation, and potentially 
enhanced LV diastolic compliance and relaxation.  
 
In the RELAX trial, we observed that sildenafil, which increases cGMP by [CONTACT_405374], failed to improve exercise capacity or QOL in 
people with HFpEF.[ADDRESS_510990], which may predispose to falls and attendant morbidity in this elderly population.18 A key factor in HFpEF that complicates treatment is that the  hemodynamic  perturbations  causing  morbidity (e.g., high filling pressures) are typi[INVESTIGATOR_405340]—being absent at rest (Figure 1).10, [ADDRESS_510991] 
(Figure  2). 
 
In contrast to direct NO donors such as organic nitrate s, there is no tolerance with NO
2-.39 The NO 2- reductase activity of heme-containing 
proteins peaks at O 2 saturations of 40- 60% but is near maximal from 20- 60%, [ADDRESS_510992] when filling pressures, pulmonary artery pressures, and CO are normal (Figure 1). In addition, NO
2- may have beneficial effects on skeletal muscle bioenergetics,  
improving the O [ADDRESS_510993] of work  during submaximal exercise.42,  43 Thus;  NO 2-

 represents an ideal candidate molecule to treat the central and peripheral limitations to exercise, 
with less risk of adverse toxicity, while complementing the effectiveness of ET to improve 
functional capacity in HFpEF. 
 
Participants in this trial will un dergo 12 weeks of cardiac rehabilitation for exercise training (ET) 
and be randomized to either nitrite or matching placebo. In Stage 1 of the trial, participants received either nebulized inhaled NaNO2 (AIR001, Aires Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Diego, CA) or nebulized inhaled saline (placebo) throughout the training period. Study drug (80 mg) was administered utilizing the Phillips I -neb AAD nebulizer over 10 -15 minutes for each dose. Study 
drug was administered 3 times daily during daytime hours (e.g. 08:00, 12:00 and 16:00), with one of these doses being immediately prior to onset of exercise at ET sessions throughout the course of the 12- week  trial. 
 
In Stage II of the trial, subjects will receive treatment with sodium nitrite (or matching placebo) as oral capsules at a dose of 40 mg tid, a lower nitrite dose than in Stage I. The oral formulation produces plasma nitrite levels that are similar to, but slightly less than, what is observed with intravenous administration in our previous study (plasma nitrite levels following 20 mg dose of 5.5±0.7 μM with oral vs 8.4±1.9 μM in the intravenous study). 
 
While plasma nitrite levels are lower with oral nitrite  than intravenous or inhaled, these levels are 
still an order of magnitude higher than what is observed with other oral formulations of nitrate/nitrite that have or are being tested in HFpEF (e.g. beetroot juice, potassium nitrate), and are similar to leve ls that we have observed to produce favorable hemodynamic effects in our 
preliminary invasive studies.  
 
The time to maximal concentration of NO
2- in plasma with the oral formulation is 30 minutes, 
which is longer than with inhaled (5 minutes), though plasma levels return to baseline by 3 hours following a single dose (Hughes et al. Hypertension 2017; electronically published ahead of press, 
doi: 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.[ZIP_CODE]). For this reason, study drug will be administered 30 minutes prior to training in Stage 2 of the study, as opposed to immediately prior to training as was performed in Stage 1.  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_405341] (IND 123333) from the FDA for use of inhaled NaNO

to include the oral nitrite formulation, with permission to cross reference the existing IND (#115926) for oral nitrite held by [CONTACT_301407], [CONTACT_405420].  
 
Background related to Aim 2. 
Symptoms of exercise dyspnea and fatigue in HFpEF discourage activity and thus represent a 
barrier to succeeding with ET and maintaining an active lifestyle during and after completing  ET. By [CONTACT_405375]- induced elevation in cardiac filling pressures, relaxing loading condit ions, 
and improving cardiac output reserve, NO
2- holds promise to reduce these symptoms and thus 
improve daily activity and tolerability of ET. The objectives of Aim [ADDRESS_510995] this hypothesis will be to quantify 
perceived effort and dyspnea symptoms reported during ET and evaluate whether daily activity 
assessed by 14- day averaged arbitrary accelerometer units (AAU14) increases more in subjects 
with HFpEF randomized to NO 2- with ET compared to inhaled placebo with ET. The rationale for 
this aim is that treating symptoms of HF caused by [CONTACT_405376]/enable greater activity and tolerability of ET. After successful complet ion of the 
proposed studies for Aim 2, it is our expectation that we will have identified a new way to improve symptomatic tolerability of ET while increasing daily activity levels outside of the training environment, allowing for extension of the benefits  of ET in the long term to maintain an  active 
lifestyle and sustainable increase in long -term activity level and fitness in people with HFpEF.  
 
The duration of ET intervention is short, generally 8- 12 weeks, and the long - term goal of ET is to 
achieve and maintain a durable, sustained increase in activity level beyond the original intervention. Data from the HF -ACTION trial showed that despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a well- organized program with 
abundant resources, only 40% of participants randomized to the intervention stage act ually 
maintained ET at the target of [ADDRESS_510996]; long- 
term organic nitrate therapy did improve exercise capacity in this HF subtype. The dis crepancy 
between acute and long- term effects with organic nitrates in HFrEF has been attributed to increases 
in physical activity and improved fitness associated with long- term improvement in HF 
symptoms—a speculation that has been corroborated by [CONTACT_405377] s in self -reported physical activity 
among subjects randomized to organic nitrates.[ADDRESS_510997]. Barry Borlaug  CONFIDENTIAL

Nitrite exists in the body derived from both dietary intake and as a by[CONTACT_405378]. Nitrite is widely used as a food preservative and is available in much higher doses for intravenous administration as an FDA-approved treatment for cyanide toxicity. 
 
Inhaled Nitrite (Stage 1): Inhaled, nebulized placebo or inhaled nebulized sodium nitrite was 
administered at [ADDRESS_510998] dose starting at the beginning of the active part of the day (for example, 8:00, 12:00, and 16:00). The Participants were instructed to disperse the doses by [CONTACT_2669] 4 hours and deliver them over thei r normal active 
day time. The doses do not need to be given at the same time each day if the Participant’s active period varies by [CONTACT_4475], for example if the Participant arises later on the weekends.  
 
Oral nitrite (Stage II) : In Stage II of the study, nitrite  will be administered using an oral 
formulation at dose of 40 mg po tid (taken using the same dosing frequency as during Stage I of the study, but 30 minutes prior to training rather than immediately preceding training). This 
produces peak concentrations at 30 minutes which return to baseline at 3 hours (Hughes et al.

1.3 Clinical Data to  Date  
 
Preliminary Studies Related to Aim 1.  
Our group has shown that exercise limitation in 
HFpEF is related to global impairments in 
cardiovascular reserve— characterized by [CONTACT_405380] (less reduction in arterial elastance, Ea), greater increase in pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_47469] (PCWP), blunted increases in CO relative to VO
2 (lower CO/VO 2 slope), and 
steeper pulmonary arterial (PA) pressure flow relationship indicating abnormal pulmonary vasodilation (n=74, Figure 3). Depressed CO reserve contributes to a net decrease in O
[ADDRESS_511000] shown that the decrease in CO during exercise in HFpEF is coupled with lower mixed 
venous O 2 content and pH during submaximal exercise in patients with  HFpEF compared to 
controls (n=74, Figure 4). In a different  
study, we have also observed marked 
reduction in coronary sinus O 2 saturation 
during exercise in people with HFpEF (28±9%, n=9).44 Thus, the outgoing blood traveling to the left heart from the pulmonary arteries (mixed venous) as well as the venous blood returning from 
the left heart (coronary  sinus)  becomes  hypoxic and 
acidemic during exercise in people with HFpEF, setting the stage for greater reduction of NO
2- to 
NO in the central circulatio n. 
 
Our group has recently completed a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial testing whether acute NO
2- treatment could improve hemodynamics during submaximal exercise in 
HFpEF      (n=29).  Subjects  
underwent resting and exercise invasive hemodynamic assessment and were then treated with either intravenous NO
2- (250  μg/kg over 
5 min) or saline. After [ADDRESS_511001] and exercise hemodynamic assessment was 
performed at the same workload. Compared to placebo, NO
2- treated subjects displayed markedly attenuated increases in PCWP 
with exertion, improved exercise CO reserve, and enhanced CO/VO 2 slope (Figures 5 and 6).

 Enhanced CO reserve in NO 2- treated subjects was entirely due to improved stroke volum e reserve 
(+16±19 vs +1±14 ml, p=0.02), as there was no effect on exercise heart rate (p=0.9). Acute NO 2- 
infusion reduced the steepness of the PA pressure-flow relationship from 10.0 (IQR, 
4.9 to 24) mmHg*min/L to 4.1 (IQR 2.5 to 5.0) mmHg*min/L (p<0.001), revealing a significant reduction in right ventricular loading with stress. 
 
Notably, there was no significant effect of intravenous NO 2- on blood pressure at rest or during 
exercise compared to placebo. The stroke volume increase observed, coupled with lower PCWP and no change in blood pressure strongly suggests a positive direct myocardial effect of acute NO
2-
. In contrast to some prior studies, 41, [ADDRESS_511003] of exercise; rather 
the proportional increase in VO 2 during subm aximal exercise (20 Watts) relative to the increase 
prior to study drug was 106% (IQR, 98 to 136%) with NO 2- as compared to 90% with placebo 
(IQR, 84 to 111%; p<0.01 compared to NO 2-). 
 
Plasma NO 2- levels increased to 8.4±1.[ADDRESS_511004] in subjects receivi ng intravenous NO 2- 
(p=0.004 vs baseline, n=4). After 5 minutes of exercise, NO 2- levels decreased to 3.4±0.4 μM 
(p<0.01 compared to pre- exercise). The calculated half -life from these data is 3.9±0.[ADDRESS_511005] (30- 40 min). This 
indicates active NO 2- consumption during exercise, and thus greater reduction of NO 2- to NO 
during stress.  
 
We have recently demonstrated equivalent hemodynamic benefits in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_405344] 2- (n=30, data from the first 4 participants receiving open label drug shown). A single inhaled 
dose of 80 mg NO 2- produces similar plasma NO 2- levels to the IV formulation (9.3±0.9 μM) and 
equivalent reductions in exercise PCWP (29±2 to 19±4 mmHg, p=0.01) . While the effects of oral 
nitrite on rest and exercise PCWP have not yet been assessed, preliminary data from Hughan and 
Gladwin et al has revealed that plasma nitrite levels 30 minutes following a single oral dose of 40 mg sodium nitrite (as will be use d in this study) produces similar NO
2- levels as we observed with 
the intravenous formulation (Figure 6).

 As shown by [CONTACT_405381] ( Hypertension 2017; 
electronically published ahead of press, doi: 
10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.[ZIP_CODE]), the oral formulation of nitrite (20 mg) produces 
NO
2- levels that are similar to but slightly lower 
than what is observed with parenteral administration or the 40 mg single dose (5.5±0.7 μM, Figure 7). However, even the [ADDRESS_511007] observed favorable hemodynamic effects based upon our preliminary invasive studies (Figures 5, 6). Furthermore, the oral formulation used in Stage II of the study will also be easier for patients to  
administer as compared to the nebulized formulation which was cumbersome and time - consuming 
for patients to use. 
 
No epi[INVESTIGATOR_405345]. As compared to inhaled placebo, AIR001 (80 mg) had no effect on mean BP (0±9 vs 1±3 mmHg, p=0.8) and no effect on heart rate (-1±5 vs -2±4 bpm, p=0.7). 
 
With oral nitrite, which will be used in Stage II of this study, there is a modest vasodilator effect leading to reduction in mean arterial pre ssure 
(Figure 8) that peaks between 15 and 45 minutes following single dose administration (Hughan et al. Hypertension 2017; published ahead of press, 
doi: 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.[ZIP_CODE] and Hughan, Gladwin et al, unpublished data from separate trial of  patients with obesity and 
metabolic syndrome, n=20). 
 
This reduction in blood pressure noted with oral nitrite in these studies was not associated with  
development of reflex tachycardia. In the study of Hughan et al. testing oral nitrite at a dose of [ADDRESS_511008] the peripheral components 
of VO 2, evidenced by [CONTACT_405382] -venous O 2 difference (A -V O 2diff)

 sustained, longer -term treatment will allow for even greater synergistic benefit with ET in subjects 
with HFpEF.  
 
Our group has recently completed an invasive hemodynamic study (n=106) where 
echocardiography was performed at rest and during maximal effort exercise simultaneously with directly measured intracardiac and vascular pressures. PA systolic pressures (PASP) estimated by [CONTACT_405383], whil e significant but less robust correlations were observed between PCWP and the E/e’ 
ratio during cycle ergometry. These data demonstrate the feasibility and validity of exercise echocardiography to assess hemodynamic reserve in our group. 
 
 
Preliminary Studies related to Aim 2.  
 
We have shown that patients with HFpEF develop marked increases in cardiac filling pressures, PA pressures, and inadequate CO reserve during exercise, and that each of these abnormalities can be improved during submaximal exercise by  [CONTACT_405384]

studies related to Aim 1, above). In addition, our group has shown that in subjects with HFpEF, the degree of NO -cGMP impairment, assessed by [CONTACT_405385] o cclusion is directly related to more severe 
symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue during matched submaximal exercise (Figure 9, n=31).[ADDRESS_511010] acquired high quality accelerometer data from all participants enrolled (Figure 10).

 1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 
Nitrite delivery by [CONTACT_33980], inhaled and oral routes of administration has been shown to be 
safe, and the plasma nitrite levels achieved with each route have been shown by [CONTACT_405386], as will be tested in this study. 
 
Intravenous nitrite administration reduces pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_328073] (PCWP) at rest ( -
3 mmHg, p<0.0001) and particularly during exercise  (adjusted exercise values 19±5 mm Hg vs. 
28±6 mm Hg; p=0.0003). Similar effects are observed on pulmonary artery (PA) pressures, and there was a greater increase in cardiac output reserve (all p<0.01). Plasma nitrite levels achieved with the intravenous f ormulation were 8.39±1.88 μM (Borlaug et al. J Am Coll Cardiol 2015; 
66:1672–82). While our group has shown that nitrite reduces arterial stiffness ( J Am Coll Cardiol. 
2017;70(2):136- 148.), there was no symptomatic hypotension or methemoglobinemia with 
intravenous nitrite in this study, and no adverse events.  
 
Inhaled nitrite (Stage I): In Stage I of this trial, participants received a dose of inhaled nebulized nitrite 80 mg 3 times daily. Participants developi[INVESTIGATOR_405346]- titrated to 46 mg 3 times daily. The nebulizer route was difficult to use for many of the participants, and mindful of the neutral results of the INDIE trial (manuscript currently under review), the manufacturer of the inhaled nitrite compound discontinued manufacture. For this reason, we are 
switching to an oral route of administration of nitrite in Stage II of our study. 
 
Oral nitrite (Stage II): Like inhaled nitrite, oral nitrite has been found to be safe, without significant adverse effects in Phase I s tudies. The bioavailability of oral nitrite is excellent (95%) 
and similar to intravenous formulations. High doses of nitrite have also been provided in several studies by [CONTACT_380990]. Nutraceutical preparations are currently being sold in health stores with levels of nitrite (12.7 mg per tablet) that are similar to what will be used in Stage II of our study. 
 
As of July 31, 2017, a total of [ADDRESS_511012]. Gladwin’s IND# 115926 at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]. Subjects enrolled are predominantly female (57%) and Caucasian (77%). Among the [ADDRESS_511013] been completed; one is a Phase 1 study aimed to establish the pharmacok inetics, 
metabolism and interconversion of nitrate to nitrite, nitrite to nitric oxide, and interaction with Conjugated Linoleic Acid (cLA) to form nitro -fatty acids in vivo in healthy adult normal 
volunteers (Hughan et al. Hypertension 2017; published ahead of press, doi: 
10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.[ZIP_CODE]). The other is a Phase 2 open labeled study designed to assess the safety and feasibility of oral nitrite therapy on the changes in skeletal muscle bioenergetics and physical capacity in older heart failure patients.  
 
Five Phase 2 studies are ongoing. Of the five active studies, 2 studies are in the patient population of overweight/obese adults with metabolic syndrome and hypertension, at risk for insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction, one in adul t obese asthmatics with metabolic syndrome, 
and another one in older HF patients, one in adult HFpEF patients aged ≥ 18 years and another one in older HFpEF patients  aged  ≥ [ADDRESS_511014]. Gladwin’s  group has also initiated

The cardiovascular IND involved the administration of sodium nitrite to [ADDRESS_511016]. Gladwin’s current IND for the oral  formulation. 
 
[CONTACT_405421] has also treated 11 subjects with sickle cell disease on this IND without observed adverse effects. The lower do ses of nitrite used in these investigational treatment regimens – 60- 
120 mg daily, or 20- 40% of the intravenous dose (300mg) used in the emergency treatment of 
cyanide poisoning – do not produce methemoglobin levels greater than 3% and have not been 
assoc iated with clinically significant hypotension. There have been no adverse events noted in the 
[ADDRESS_511017] reductions in blood pressure with no increase  in heart 
rate (Hughan et al. Hypertension 2017; electronically published ahead of press, doi: 
10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.[ZIP_CODE]). Similar to our prior studies with inhaled and intravenous nitrite, oral nitrite was observed in this study to cause a very mi ld and clinically 
insignificant rise in plasma methemoglobin levels, with no patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_405347] >3%.  
 
The effects of oral nitrite on central hemodynamics have not yet been examined, but  given the 
similar plasma nitrite levels observed with oral administration (Figure 7) and modest reduction in blood pressures (Figure 8), we expect reductions in pulmonary artery and pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_405348]. 
 
Risk from Study Drug -Overview  
Sodium nitrite (NO
2-) has vasodilating properties, and the most significant expected risk in this 
population would be symptomatic hypotension. NO 2- is converted in vivo to nitric oxide (NO) and 
thus may cause vasorelaxation. We have observed that nitrite delivered by [CONTACT_405387] ( J Am Coll Cardiol. 2017;70(2):136- 148.), without causing excessive BP reduction 
or symptomatic hypotension. 
 
The oral formulation of nitrite has been observed to reduce blood pressure. This compound has been administered to patients with obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as HFpEF and PH as part of [CONTACT_405421]’s ongoing NIH -sponsored studies, and no severe adverse events or 
symptomatic hypotension have developed following treatment with this oral nitrite formulation ([CONTACT_405420], personal communication 2018). We will carefully assess for any adverse 
Inorganic Nitrite To  Amplify the Benefits and Tolerability of Exercise Training In Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection 
Fraction  
Revised [ADDRESS_511018]. Barry Borlaug  CONFIDENTIAL   
 effects that could be related to excessive BP reduction in the study as outlined below in the 
protocol. 
 
Mechanism of Action : Inorganic sodium nitrite is an intrinsic vasodilator that is converted in 
blood and tissues to nitric oxide (NO). Endogenous NO 2- represents the body’s largest reservoir of 
NO which results in vasodilation and may improve ventricular diastolic compliance. 
 
Dosage : AIR001 solution for nebulization. The dose of 80mg/ml is administered through a 
specialized nebulizer device. The oral dose of 40 mg is administered as a capsule, administered 
three times daily (same as the inhaled formulation).  
 
Metabolism : AIR001 is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_405349] -capi[INVESTIGATOR_405350], achieving peak 
concentrations in less than [ADDRESS_511019], achieving peak levels at 30 minutes. NO
2- is elevated in plasma following both routes of 
administration and is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_405351]. 
 
Interactions and Contraindications : There are no known drug interactions. NO 2- is not a 
substrate or inhibitor for hepatic cytochrome p -450 enzymes. Nebulized inhaled nitrite (NO 2-) 
should not be used with other NO donors (e.g. organic nitrates, nitroprusside) to minimize risk of hypotension, and these are listed as exclusion criteria for safety. A drug- drug interaction study 
with sildenafil dosed at 20mg three times daily did not show a pharmacodynamic interaction, but in this study patients treated with phosphodiesterase inhibitors will be excluded. 
 
Adverse Effects : The most frequent reported adverse effects of AIR001 used in Stage 1 are cough, 
headache, and dizziness. These effects were reported as mild to moderate intensity and rarely result in discontinuation of medication. 
 
In a Phase 2 study of oral nitrite therapy in older he art failure patients, Gladwin and colleagues 
found a higher propensity for hypotension in subjects aged > [ADDRESS_511020] frequent expected adverse effects with oral nitrite are dry mouth (infrequent), and nausea/abdominal pain/methemoglobinemia/flushing/hea dache/dizziness (rare).  
 
Abuse Potential : No risk for abuse of AIR001 has been demonstrated. 
 
Pregnancy Risk : Although nitrite exists widely in nature and human ingestion occurs daily in 
foodstuffs and through water sources, no human data exist on the safe ty of administration of nitrite 
during pregnancy or lactation. AIR001 and oral nitrite should not be administered to women who are pregnant or lactating. Effective contraceptive measures should be utilized by [CONTACT_405388]- bearing potential who receive either form of nitrite. Given the ubiquitous nature

2 Study  Objectives 
Aim 1: Determine whether treatment with NO 2- in addition to ET for 12 weeks improves 
exercise capacity and hemodynamic reserve in HFpEF. Expi[INVESTIGATOR_398999], inert gas (C 2H2) 
rebreathe, and echocardiography will be performed during rest and exercise to measure oxygen 
consumption (VO 2), CO, and hemodynamics before and after completion of 12 weeks of ET with 
NO 2- vs ET with inhaled placebo.  
• Our primary hypothesis is that combination therapy with ET and NO 2- will be associated 
with greater improvement in peak VO 2 compared to ET plus placebo. Our secondary 
hypotheses are that ET and NO 2- will lead to greater improvement in CO reserve (CO/VO 2 
slope), peak workload, and exercise hemodynamics (lower echocardiography estimated 
pulmonary artery pressure and E/e’ ratio).  
Aim 2: Determine whether treatment with NO 2- in addition to ET for 12 weeks increases 
daily activity levels and QOL, and reduces symptoms of effort intolerance during ET. 
Subjects will u se externally worn accelerometer devices to track daily physical activity. 
Tolerability of ET will be assessed by [CONTACT_405389]. Large and small 
vessel endothelial function (brachial and digital arteries) and quality of life (QOL ) will be assessed.  
• Our primary hypothesis is that combination of NO 2- and ET will be associated with greater 
improvement in daily activity levels compared to ET with placebo. Our secondary 
hypotheses are that combination of NO 2- and ET will be associated with improvement in 
symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue, improved tolerability to ET, enhanced endothelial function and better QOL compared to ET with placebo.  
 
3 Study  Design  
3.1 General  Design  
This is a Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, parallel group placebo-cont rolled trial testing whether 
inorganic sodium nitrite, as compared to placebo, can enhance the benefits from chronic exercise 
training (ET) in subjects with HFpEF (see flow diagram below). 
 

Inorganic Nitrite To  Amplify the Benefits and Tolerability of Exercise Training In Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection

Revised [ADDRESS_511022]. Barry Borlaug  CONFIDENTIAL   
 The total duration of the trial is 14 weeks.  
 
Subjects will be screened from the inpatient and outpatient heart failure services and interested 
qualified subjects will be offered participation. Once consent has been obtained baseline assessment of cardiovascular function and exercise capacity will be performed. All subjects will undergo 12 weeks of ET. Participants will be randomized to receive sodium nitrite 3 times daily or matching placebo 3 times daily during the study period. 
 
In Stage I this was with inhaled medicine for the full 12 weeks of ET. In Stage II, study drug will 
be administered using an oral preparation for the full 12 weeks. Study subjects will wear accelerometry devices to track daily activity levels at home.  
 
At the Screening visit, during consent, subjects will be given the option to participate in an optional 
MRI sub -study where they will be asked to complete 2 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans . 
One scan will be completed prior to or as close as possible to the  beginning of cardiac 
rehabilitation, the other within 2 weeks of completing week 12 of ET (for Stage II). A hematocrit 
will need to be obtained prior to the MRI if not already drawn within the past 30 days. We will evaluate adipose tissue content and cardiac structur e and function. We will determine whether 
these variables relate to exercise capacity/intolerance in participants, and evaluate how they change with ET with or without nitrite. Subjects will be excluded from this optional substudy if they have contraindica tions to MRI including aneurysm clips, cardiac pacemakers, internal defibrillators,  
severe claustrophobia  and pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential will undergo a urine 
pregnancy test; positive test results will yield exclusion from study participatio n. Patients will be 
excluded for contraindications to gadolinium -based MRI contrast material, namely glomerular 
filtration rate less than or equal to 30ml/min.  
 
The MRI scans will be performed on a clinical scanner or at the Center for Advanced Imaging Research in the 
Opus building. Patients will have ECG leads placed, as is done for cardiac MRI examinations. In some patients 
this may require shaving the chest for lead placement. Prior to scanning a peripheral intravenous (IV) line will be placed.  Patients may be scanned prone and/or supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. The examination will last approximately one hour. 
Intravenous contrast material (gadolinium) will be used. Subjects will receive $25/scan for participating in this 
MRI sub -study part of the main  study.  
 
Also at the scr eening visit, during consent, subjects will be given the option to participate in an 
optional muscle biopsy where they will be asked to complete 2 muscle biopsies. One biopsy will be 
completed prior to or as close as possible to the beginning of cardiac rehabilitation, the other as close to the end of ET . The muscle biopsy sample will be collected from the vastus lateralis muscle (outer thigh).  Muscle biopsy will be performed with a percutaneous biopsy needle (modified Bergstrom needle).   Local subcutaneous injection of 2% lidocaine buffered with 8.4% sodium bicarbonate will be 
used for analgesia.   All biopsies will be done under sterile conditions with all necessary aseptic 
precautions.  A small incision will be made through the skin and fascia. After the biopsy, pressure will be held over the incision until hemostasis is achieved.  The incision is closed with sterile strips, gauze and an Ace wrap.   Risks of this procedure include hematoma, infection, and pain.  Hematoma 
likelihood is minimized b y holding pressure after the biopsy to ensure hemostasis, followed by a 
pressure dressing.  The risk of infection is minimized by [CONTACT_343129]. Pain is managed by [CONTACT_343130].  Subjects will receive $50/biopsy for participating.

intervention). 
 
3.2 Primary Study  Endpoints  
 
Exercise capacity assessed by [CONTACT_92762] (VO 2) achieved during exercise testing 
will be the primary endpoint for Aim 1. Chronic activity levels assessed by [CONTACT_405390] 2. Assessments were performed after [ADDRESS_511024] and exercise hemodynamics assessed by [CONTACT_51541], Borg dyspnea and fatigue scores recorded during ET, endothelial function assessed by [CONTACT_26554], QOL assessed by [CONTACT_405391] X -ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Cardiac structure and 
function will be assessed by [CONTACT_405392].  The muscle biopsy will tell us about what improvements we see in the leg muscles, and specifically in the mitochondria of leg muscles.  
 
 
There will be ancillary trial endpoints to assess QOL , Borg symptom scores, DEXA, AXM data, 
and exercise capacity following completion of the main trial, comparing subjects randomized to usual care or behavioral/motivation intervention.

5 Study  Drug  
5.1 Description  
Inhaled nitrite (Stage I):  Inhaled, nebulized placebo or inhaled nebulized sodium nitrite (80 mg 3 
times daily) was given at a minimum of [ADDRESS_511032] dose starting at the beginning of the active part of the day (for example, 8:00, 12:00, and 16:00). The Participant dispersed the doses by [CONTACT_2669] 4 hours and delivers  them over their normal active day time. The doses do not 
need to be given at the same time each day if the Participant’s active period varies by [CONTACT_4475], for example if the Participant arises later on the  weekends.  
 
Inhaled, nebulized sodium nitrite or placebo was administered utilizing the Phillips I -neb AAD 
nebulizer over 10 -15 minutes for each dose. The nebulizer device has a Participant logging system 
that automatically records adherence and compliance with protocol -specified treatments. The 
device log was reviewed at the time of ET sessions by [CONTACT_405395]. 
 
Oral Nitrite (Stage II): Because the inhaled form of nitrite is no longer available, the oral formulation of sodium nitrite will be used in Stage II of the study to test the study hypotheses. Sodium nitrite capsules and matching placebo capsules will be compounded by [CONTACT_405379], in Iowa City, IA , then shipped to the Research pharmacy at the University 
of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_405354]. Mark Gladwin for ongoing stability 
testing , and then study drug will be shipped to Mayo Clinic, where they will be stored and 
dispensed by [CONTACT_405396].  
 
Oral sodium nitrite will be administered at a dose of [ADDRESS_511033] 4 hours and deliver them over their normal active day time. The doses do not need to be given at the same time each day if the Participant’s active period varies by [CONTACT_4475], for example if the Participant arises later on the  weekends. 
 
Permitted dose adjustment: If significant headache occurs, participants will be encouraged to treat headaches with acetaminophen. If participants cannot tolerate the [ADDRESS_511034]. Barry Borlaug  CONFIDENTIAL   
 important that the single day dose be administered 30 minutes prior to exercise training visits and 
patients will be instructed of this. 
 
If a participant has a temporary discontinuation for reasons other than intolerance, (e.g., such as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], lost device, etc), the investigator can restart at the last tolerated dose. 
 
Drug interactions: Potential excess nitric oxide med iated effects (e.g., hypotension, headache) 
might be observed with co- administration of organic nitrates or phosphodiesterase -5 inhibitors or 
soluble guanylyl cyclase activators. Therefore, co- administration of nitrates, any 
phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitor f ormulation or soluble guanylyl cyclase activators is strictly 
contraindicated due to the risk of hypotension. There are no other known drug interactions and study drug absorption is not affected by [CONTACT_405397] (inhaled steroids  
or bronchodilators). 
 
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
 
Inhaled nitrite (Stage I): The dose used for this part of the study was 80 mg three times per day. 
 
Oral nitrite (Stage II): In Stage II of the study, participants will receive an oral dose of 40 mg 
sodium nitrite or matching placebo three times daily. If there is intolerance, patients may (under the supervision of study staff) down- titrate to 20 mg tid dosing, or 20 mg at lower frequency (as 
noted above).

Drug dispensing will be managed by [CONTACT_405398]/placebo formulations. At baseline, week 4, and week 8 study visits, participants will receive a sufficient sup ply of 
inorganic nitrite or placebo to permit three doses a day for 4 weeks  (Stage I). At baseline, and week 
4 participants will receive a sufficient supply of inorganic nitrite or placebo to permit three doses a day until final visit (Stage II) . To account for potential damage or loss of drug, additional study 
drug doses will be supplied. 
 
Participants will be instructed to take the medication as required by [CONTACT_760], and compliance will be discussed weekly with the participants and assessed every other week (at the time of QOL assessment). Adherence with the inhaled nitrite formulation  will also be assessed by [CONTACT_405399], with oral nitrite adherence will be assessed by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_405355] [ADDRESS_511036].

A copy of the current investigational product (IP) destruction SOP should be maintained in the pharmacy section of the Regulatory Binder and available for review in ca se of an  audit. 
 
Study IP must not be destroyed until IP accountability has been documented and verified. Study IP destruction should be documented within the Participant Specific IP Accountability Log (or equivalent tracking system). 
 
5.9.2 Storage 
Trial products (both unused and in- use) should not be exposed to moisture but can be stored at 
room temperature. For inhaled nitrite, the plastic ampules come in a nitrogen filled foil pouch in snap-apart groups of 5. Participants are instructed to open one pouch at a  time and utilize each 
ampule before opening another pouch. Oral nitrite is stored at room temperature in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. 
 
5.9.3 Dispensing of Study  Drug  
 
Study drug will  be provided by [CONTACT_405402]. Study drug may be mailed 
to participants if circumstances prevent them from collecting the drug in person, cause them to miss scheduled visits or any other unforeseen circumstances arise.  
 
For the inhaled nitrite formulation, the device has a Participant logging system that automatically records adherence and compliance with protocol -specified treatments. The device log will be 
reviewed every other week at ET sessions by [CONTACT_405395]. For the oral formulation, adherence will be monitored by [CONTACT_405403][INVESTIGATOR_405357] (see schedule of assessments). 
 
Regular study drug reconciliation will be performed to document drug assigned, drug dispensed, drug returns, and drug remaining. This reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, and signed and dated by [CONTACT_3476].

(used, partly used or unused including empty packaging material) must be stored separately from 
the non- allocated trial product(s) until drug accountability has been reconciled. The investigators 
will keep track of all received, used, partly used and unused trial products. 
 
[ADDRESS_511043]. Medications will be documented. Participants will complete a blood draw in the CRTU where (NT -proBNP levels, blood methemoglobin, blood 
sulfhemoglobin, fasting blood glucose and insulin levels will be tested. An optional blood collection drawing an additional 20mL’s of whole blood will be collected, separated into serum and plasma by [CONTACT_405404]. This will be done at both the screening and final visits and stored for additional testing. We are storing the blood for future analysis and will be examining circulating inflammatory biomarkers, adipokines and how they relate to adipose tissue and HFpEF symptom severity. Assays to be run at a later date will include (subject to change): C -
reactive protein (C -RP), Interleukin- 3 (IL -1β), Interleukin 6 (IL -6), Leptin, and Adiponectin.

devices and devices will be dispensed. Participants are to wear AXM at all times starting at Visit  
1. Participants will be randomized in a double -blind fashion at the time but will not start active 
treatment, and study drug will not be dispensed until the first ET visit (below). 
 
In contrast, Mayo health system participants (who undergo ET visits outside of Mayo [COMPANY_002]ster) will receive study drug and supplies during the screening visit, as part of the nebulizer education the participant will be instructed on how to use the nebulizer and will self -administer a saline 
treatment (for Stage I). Mayo health system participants will be instructed to start assigned study drug the day pr ior to their initial cardiac rehab visit (ET1).  
 
6.2 Exercise Training (ET)  Visits  
 
Following the screening visit 1, subjects will enroll in standard cardiopulmonary exercise training (cardiac rehab) in the Mayo Cardiovascular Health Clinic (CVHC). This will i nvolve ~[ADDRESS_511044]. Barry Borlaug  CONFIDENTIAL   
 ([COMPANY_002]ster and Health System  sites) cardiac rehabilitation centers remain closed or are open with 
significantly reduced capacity.  Thus, we feel it prudent to offer our participants (who are  all 
considered  high- risk for contracting COVID -19) a home- based cardiac rehabilitation program 
(HBCR) . This progr am will m odel the center -based cardiac rehab program  implemented  by [CONTACT_405405].  Participants who agree to complete the HBCR program will be seen in clinic 
for their baseline assessments, 6 minute  walk, and given a home exercise protocol.  A member 
from the s tudy team will follow up with patient twice weekly to  assess program compliance, 
discuss successes/barriers with the exercise program, provide modifications to the exercise 
program (if necessar y) and offer support and encouragement . 
 
Once weekly,  adverse events, safety and tolerability will be assessed.,  along with promotion of 
adherence to training regimen (for example on the third ET visit of each week). For Mayo health 
system participants this assessment will be done during a weekly telephone call. Every other week, study drug compliance information will be downloaded from the I -Neb device (for Stage I), 
reviewed, and discussed with the participant. For Mayo health system participants the I Ne b device 
will be downloaded and reviewed during the week 4 visit, week 8 visit and final visit (for Stage I). For Stage II, adherence will be assessed by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_405359]. 
 
ET Visit 1:  
At the first ET visit (ET1), subjects re ceived training on the use of I -neb device to administer study 
drug (for Stage I only). For Stage II, subjects will take their first dose of oral study drug 30 minutes prior to the initiation of the ET session (at ET1 and all training visits). One to two days after ET Visit 1, a study team member will call the participant at home to ask about compliance and tolerability of study  drug. 
 
Prior to start of exercise training at ET1 and each subsequent ET visit, subjects will administer one dose of study drug (i f the Visit is in the morning this will be the first dose of the day, if the Visit 
is in the afternoon, this will be the second dose of the day but must be separated from the first dose by ≥4 hours). For inhaled study drug (Stage I), this was administered immediately prior to ET visit. 
For the oral study drug (Stage II), the capsule is to be taken 30 minutes prior to the start of the ET visit.  
 
At one of the ET sessions every other week, measurement of QOL will be performed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Borg symptom severity (effort and dyspnea scores) will be recorded during standardized exercise training at a common objective 
workload, 2 mph on treadmill at 2° grade for 5 minutes. Mayo health system participants w ill 
complete the KCCQ via biweekly phone visits with the study coordinator. 
 
6.3 ET Visits 12 (week 4) and 24 (week 8) 
 
At one of the ET visits during week 4 and week 8, the following additional assessments will be 
performed: New medications over the last 4 weeks will be documented. Blood tests (NT - proBNP 
levels, blood methemoglobin, blood sulfhemoglobin, fasting blood glucose and insulin levels will be drawn in the CRTU. Data from the accelerometer will be downloaded from the device and the device will be exchanged with a fully charged device. Study drug will be administered prior to

from research pharmacy for Stage I). Mayo health system participants will be required to do the week 4 and week 8 visits at Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster; they cannot be completed during an ET visit at their participating cardiac rehab  site. 
 
6.4 Final  Visit  
 
The Final Visit of the drug interventional part of the study for Stage I occurred at week 12 
This visit will include all of the assessments performed in Screening Visit 1 (see above). 
Participants will be asked not to take their study medications the day of this visit; they will be 
asked to administer a treatment directly prior to the final visit CPET under direct investigator observation. For Stage I, inhaled study drug was administered immediately prior to CPET. For 
Stage II, oral study drug is administered (under direct observation by [CONTACT_464]) 30 minutes prior 
to CPET. AXM data wil l be downloaded and devices returned or changed out. Participants will 
return all other study materials at the final visit and all unused study  drug. 
 
 
At the Final ET Visit (week 12), participants will be offered enrollment in an ancillary study to evaluate the effects of behavioral/motivational intervention on chronic activity levels and QOL. Subjects agreeing to this part of the trial will then be randomized to behavioral/motivational intervention (motivational phone calls twice weekly with one investigator visit per week) or standard care (no additional contact. Participants will continue to wear AXM devices following this visit to assess how well increases in chronic activity levels are maintained following ET intervention. Involvement in this par t of the trial is optional.

scale) and dyspnea (0 -10 scale) scores during matched, low -level submaximal effort (2 mph on 
treadmill at 2 ° grade for 5 minutes). This assessment will be performed at Visit 1, on the third ET 
visit of each week (i.e. ET3, ET6, ET9…up to ET36), and at Visit 2. Submaximal exercise assessment of symptom severity at Visits 1 and 2 will occur after the primary endpoint assessment 
of peak exercise capacity. Patient -reported activity levels will be assessed by [CONTACT_405408], which  will be completed  at the screening  visit and final endpoint visit (week  12). 
 
Measurement of QOL  will be performed every other week at ET sessions using t he Kansas City

 7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Statistical  Overview  
 
7.2 The full statistical details for this protocol are documented in the supplementary Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). This protocol provides the key information, namely the justification for the sample size and the details on the primary analysis. The detail s regarding secondary 
endpoints, subgroup analyses, missing data and analysis sets are provided in the SAP.Sample Size  Determination  
 
In the RELAX trial, the mean±SD change in peak VO
2 with placebo in subjects with HFpEF 
treated for 6 months was 0±2.0 ml/kg/min,36 and in a previous trial of ET in HFpEF, the increase 
in peak VO in the ET arm was +2.3±2.2 ml/kg/min.22 An increase of 75% (additional 1.5 
ml/kg/min) in this change would be considered clinically relevant. Thus, we estimate that a sample size of N =34 participants per group will be required to provide 80% statistical power (two- tailed, 
alpha=0.05) to detect the difference of 1.5 ml/kg/min between subjects randomized to NO
2- with 
ET versus placebo with ET. To account for attrition, we will increase our number of randomized subjects to 40/group (enroll 80 subjects total to accrue 68 total or 34 in each group). 
 
Stage 1 was discontinued early because of loss of inhaled nitrite availability, therefore we will accrue a total of 68 patients with complete d ata combining the patients with complete data 
receiving inhaled placebo in Stage I (n=17) with another 51 patients in Stage II (17 receiving placebo and 34 receiving nitrite) to ensure that the study is adequately powered to test the study hypotheses. 
 
7.3 Primary Outcome Analysis 
 
Primary Statistical Hypotheses: 
 
H0: Change from baseline to 12 weeks in Peak VO2 in participants randomized to NO 2- will be 
equal to the change in Peak VO2 in participants randomized to placebo. 
 
Ha: The change from baseline to 12 weeks in Peak VO2 will be different between the two randomized groups 
 
Analysis Summary: The primary statistical hypothesis will be tested using a regression framework. The dependent variable will be the change (baseline to 12 week) in Peak VO2. An indicator variable will be used to indicate the randomized treatment assignment (NO
2- vs. placebo as the referent). This analysis 
is equivalent to a two -sample t -test. While the study design is randomized, the number of 
particip ants is relatively small, so imbalance between putative confounding variables may be 
observed. To address this, we will conduct an a priori sensitivity analysis that will adjust for baseline Peak VO2, BMI, Sex, and Age group strata through an extension of the regression model used for the primary analysis. The type III estimate of the treatment effect will be compared to the unadjusted estimate to assess the robustness of the randomization process.

Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria: 
Inorganic Nitrite To  Amplify the Benefits and Tolerability of Exercise Training In Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection 
Fraction  
Revised [ADDRESS_511055]. Barry Borlaug  CONFIDENTIAL   
 • Serious : Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be physical, 
psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the subject or 
others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: (1) death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) 
disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of 
confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14846], safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromise the resear ch data,  AND  
• Unanticipated : (i.e.  unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already described 
as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it wa s unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" 
when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected,  AND  
• Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research  procedures. 
 
 
Adverse Event  
An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug, 
device, biologic) in a patient or research subject. 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious. Serious problems/events can be well 
defined and include; 
• death  
• life threatening adverse experience 
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity  
• persistent or significant birth  defect/anomaly  
 
and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37021] -investigator may 
have adversely affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially 
compromised the research data.  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria f or serious, should be regarded as non- 
serious adverse events . 
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
 
For this study, the study treatment follow -up period is defined as [ADDRESS_511056]. Barry Borlaug  CONFIDENTIAL   
 Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period. 
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition. At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that  meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event. 
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_456] -investigator until the events are 
resolved, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained. At the last 
scheduled visit, the sponsor -investigator should instruct each subject to report, to the sponsor - 
investigator, any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37022] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol. Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event  if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.  
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68034] a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse 
event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_405363].

Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event section of the case report form (CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic, laboratory or procedure results should recorded in the source document. 
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded. The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study treatment or participation is not the pro bable cause. Serious adverse events that are 
still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up, to determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to

drug, based on available information, using the following guidelines: 
• Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship to the investigational product 
and the adverse event.  
• Unlikely related: No temporal association or the cause of the event has been identified, 
or the drug or biologic cannot be implicated.  
• Possibly related: There is reasonable evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
the drug and adverse event.  
• Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is  unlikely. 
 
8.2.2  Assessment of Adverse Event  Severity  
The determination of adverse event severity rests on medical judgment of a medically- qualified  
Investigator. The severity of the AEs will be graded using the following definitions: 
• Mild: Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated;  
• Moderate: Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity and may 
warrant  intervention; 
• Severe: Incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly affects 
clinical status, and warrants  intervention.

Unexpected fatal or life threatening suspected adverse reactions where there is  evidence to suggest 
a causal relationship between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be reported as a 
serious suspected adverse reaction. This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor -investigator’s initial receipt of the information about 
the event.  
 
Other unexpected serious suspected adverse reactions where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be reported as a ser ious 
suspected adverse reaction. This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor -investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the event.  
 
Any clinically important increase in the rate of serio us suspected adverse reactions over those 
listed in the protocol or product insert will be reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction. This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor-investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the event.  
 
Findings from other studies in human or animals that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug will be reported. This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than [ADDRESS_511061] (DSMB).

This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 “Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting”). Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events. 
 
8.6.[ADDRESS_511063] (DSMB) has been formed, chaired by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Bernard Gersh. The DSMB Charter is included as an  Attachment.  
 
[ADDRESS_511064] of 1996 (HIPAA). Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following: 
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this  study 
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI. 
 
In the event that  a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization. For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts  should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (long term survival status that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 
 
9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents. Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated

9.3 Case Report  Forms  
 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study. All 
data requested on the CRF will be recorded. All missing data will be explained. 
 
Medidata Rave and Balance will be used for clinical data management and randomization (see 
Facilities and Resources for expanded description). These tools are institutionally supported and allow for rapid database development. The implementation of the software within a project includes training on the system’s use, robust error checking, security considerations, and full audit trail. Balance, which is integrated into Rave , allows for a variety of randomization and 
minimization algorithms.

A Pragmatic, Randomized, Controlled Trial Examining the  
Efficacy of a Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285593] -up Phone Call Program  
 
 BACKGROUND :  
 
Implementing a post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285597] -up phone call program at Vanderbilt University Medical Center 
(VUMC ) is expected  to support  effective patient transitions to out -patient care,[ADDRESS_348622] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285597] -up phone calls on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285598] 30 days , emergency department ( ED) visits, patient satisfaction, and mortality  in a general 
medicine inpatient population . We will obtain exploratory information on patient sub -groups at high risk for 
readmission and those experiencing high benefit from the follow -up phone call intervention. In addition , we will 
obtain data on discharge plan implementation assistance needed to s upport a successful transition from 
inpatient to outpatient care amongst those reached by [CONTACT_285626].  
 
RATIONALE  
 
In the current medical literature, it is unclear how follow -up calls influence these outcomes in a general medical 
population . Some studies have attempted to address this question, but are limited in that they target very 
specific patient populations,[ADDRESS_348623] -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285597] -up phone call can improve patient s’ transition from in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285599].  We will also identify the discharge implementation assistance given  to 
those in the intervention (Phone C all) group.  
 
Outcome Measures  
Primary Outcome  for this study is readmission  within 30 days  
Secondary Out comes  include evaluating: The primary outcome of readmission within 30 days within pre -
specified subgroups (age, gender, race, health literacy level, established primary car e status, patient 
satisfaction, Medicare readmission penalty diagnosis status, readmission risk score), p atient satisfaction  
between the study arms  measured as mean Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285600]  (HCAHP S) patient satisfaction scores , all cause VUMC ED visits, the need for assistance with 
discharge plan implementation , and mortality within 30 days.  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
The study will include VUMC patients discharged after an inpatient  status hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285601] : Riven,  Morgan, Geriatrics, and Palliative Care .  
 
Exclusion Criteria  
We will exclude all patients who experience i n-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39473] , leave the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285602], are 
transferred  to any post-acute care facility  or are discharged to inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125] . 
 
Study Arms  
VUMC Quality Committee’s Po st-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285603] a quality initiative started in January of 2016 
where a single study nurse calls as many patients after discharge as she can reach.  Using a phone call 
intervention script and form ( See Appendix I  – Discharge Phone Call Starform ) to guide the flow of ea ch call 
A Pragmatic, Randomized, Controlled Trial Examining the  
Efficacy of a Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285593] -up Phone Call Program  
 
 and screening for discharge intervention needs.  After discharge , patients will be randomized to one of [ADDRESS_348624] ions are included in Figure 1 .  
 
Phone Call Group (Intervention Arm) : Patients will first be called with a maximum of [ADDRESS_348625]-discharge day 7 . The  semi -structured script imbedded within the Discharge 
Phone Call Starform is  used to guide a conversation to obtain information on potential causes of hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_285604]’s transition to outpatient care. We 
will co llect data on 1) outpatie nt care support provided to intervention group patients exposed to the phone call 
intervention (coordinating the receipt of durable medical e quipment , facilitating  a connection with home h ealth , 
referra l to PCP, r eferral to ED, requesting the assistance of case management or social w ork assistance for 
the patient, medication c hange initiated by [CONTACT_285627], requesting p harmacist assistance  with 
discharge plan details, requesting other health p rovider s assistance, reminding the patient of planned follow up 
appointments, scheduling expected follow -up appointments, providing self -care education  (wound car e, diet, 
activity) , providing m edication dosing and administration education ), 2) whether findings from the call  generate  
a visit to emergency department or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715] . (See Appendix I’s Starform Data  section)  
 
Usual Care Group (Control  Arm): Patient s assigned to the Control Group receive  standard discharge plan ning 
and follow -up per the usual care of their medical providers .  
 
Data Collection  
Every weekday morning , a report will be generated from the Vanderbilt electronic medical record identifying all 
patients discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285605] . This list will be transmitted securely to the study team.  
The list will then be randomized and uploaded to th e study database within Research Electronic Data Capture 
(REDCap) .  This will occur using code written in R linked with the application program interface (API) function 
of REDCap.  (See Appendix II  – Randomization and REDCap API [INVESTIGATOR_285606]) . The code will 
upload patients assigned to the [ADDRESS_348626] queue for the Study Phone Call Nurse.  In addition, she will document interventions 
delivered via a form ( Appendix I II - Intervention Data Capture Form ) for each patient’s phone call encounter 
that will save this data as new variables within the database.  
 
The Study Phone Call Nur se will continue to complete an  existing form within the electronic health record, the 
Phone Call Starform ( Appendix I ) to document care provided via the phone call.  For patients reached, the 
Study Phone Call Nurse  will use the semi -structured script provid ed by [CONTACT_285628]’s 
understanding of their discharge plan, screen for discharge assistance needs, and inquire about new  
symptoms requiring patient referral.  
 
The majority of our study data will be obtained via Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s  Research Deriv ative.  
These variables include: 1) VUMC based p rimary outcome ( hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285607] ) data, 2) s econdary 
outcome measures (patient satisfaction scores, all cause ED visits within 30 days, identified the need for 
assistance with discharge plan implementation, and 30 day mortality), 3) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285608], and 4) pre -
specified subgroup identifiers  (see Figure 1).   
 
The R esearch Derivative  (RD)   is  a  database  of  clinical  and  related  data  derived   from  the Medical 
Center’s clinical systems and restructured for research. Data is repurposed from  VU’s  enterprise  data  
warehouse,  which  includes  data  from  StarPanel,  Vanderbilt Perioperative Information Management 
System ,  ORM IS  (Operating  Room  Management  Information  System),  EPIC,  Medipac,  and  HEO order 
entry records among  others.  The medical  record  number  and  other  person  identifiers  are  preserved 
within the  database.  Data  types  include  reimbursement  co des,  clinical  notes  and documentation,  nursing  
records,  medication  data,  laboratory  data,  encounter  and  visit data, among others.  Output may include 
structured data points, such as ICD -[ADDRESS_348627] explored many methods to obtain external readm ission data 
and found the use of the Vanderbilt Health Affiliated Network (VHAN) to be most feasible  for this pragmatic 
study approach . We plan to overcome this obstacle, albeit in a limited way, by [CONTACT_285629] (CDRN) to extract hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285609].   
 
Health Literacy Information will be procured from the Center for Clinical and I mplementation Sciences

 Confidentiality and Source Data  
Only key study personnel at the Data Coordinating Center, Vanderbilt University, will have access to the full 
study dataset which will be maintained in REDCap.  
 
Data Safety and Monitoring  
The interim analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_285631] M onitor,  [CONTACT_285651] , Assistant Vice Chancellor for Translational Science . The results will be reviewed  with the [ADDRESS_348628]. Hartert, VUMC Adult Enterprise Quality Committee : Mitch 
Edgeworth , CEO of Vanderbilt University Adult Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15166] ; and Jerry Hickson , Chief Quality, Patient 
Safety and Risk  Prevention Of ficer for VUMC . In addition  to the study data analysis the  Safety Committee will 
review 1) a 10% sample of the Phone Call Nurse’s daily reports to her supervisors which is an element of 
clinical care reporting and 2) a summary of potential safety concerns from the office overseeing this clinical 
program, the Medi cine Patient Care Center.  The study team will remain blinded to outcome associated results.  
 
Sample Size Considerations   
Per inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285611] [ADDRESS_348629] of 
the program  on the phone call population with a pre -specified subgroup analysis of those actually reached  
(See Figure 1 – Study Design Schematic and Enrollment Projection).  
 
Study Length and Timeline  
The informatics run -in period will begin February 7th, [ADDRESS_348630] estimates of the discharge phone call intervention at 50% enroll ment 
for 80% power (See the Study Timeline , on page 2 ), and conduct the definitive analysis  at 100% enrollment . 
In addition, t he analyses will account for a [ADDRESS_348631] the study data extraction and database upload 
process prior to the planned study analyses.  This will permit us to troubleshoot unforeseen data collection 
challenges. Given the sample size consideratio ns noted above, we estimate a study length of 7 months w ith 
enrollment completion in September of 2017, primary outcome follow -up ending in November of 2017, and 
data collection completed in (due to data lags for patient satisfaction, external hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715], and 
mortality data) May of [ADDRESS_348632] 3 phases .  The primary analysis will examine our primary outcome , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285598] 30 days , via an intention -to-treat analysis where comparisons will be made between the 2 
study arms.  We will then  examine  secondary outcomes of all cause  ED visits to Vanderbilt or VHA N ED and 
mortality.  Given  VUMC’s interest in  understand ing characteristics of  patients not reached via telephone, we  will 
explore  differences among those called and reached, called and not reached, and the control arm.   In these [ADDRESS_348633] educational 
attainment, health literacy, established primary care status, patient satisfaction level, Medicare readmission 
penalty diagnosis  status, and readmission risk score calculated at discharge  as part of routine  care at VUMC . 
Lastly, w e will use descriptive statistics to quantify the need for patient assistance with discharge plan 
implementation (appointment scheduling or reminders, questions about new medications, durable medical 
equipment acquisition, referral for new symp toms, etc .) among patients in the intervention arm who are called 
and reached.    
 
Statistical Analysis  
A Pragmatic, Randomized, Controlled Trial Examining the  
Efficacy of a Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285593] -up Phone Call Program  
 
 In our univariate analysis, differences among these patient characteristic groups will be assessed  using the 
continuity corrected chi-square test or Mann -Whitney test for continuous outcomes and the Kruskal -Wallis test 
for categorical outcomes.  In our multivariate analysis , we will examine the relationship between treatment 
assignment and our secondary endpoints using logistic regression.  The study is not powered for a time -to-
event analysis ; however , we will explore time -to-readmission  using the Cox proportional hazard model  to 
understand the timing of when readmissions occur . In order to provide VUMC Leadership with preliminary 
efficacy data, we will perform an interim analysis at 50% enrollment  (~3.5 months) followed by [CONTACT_285632]  (~7 months) . See Appendix V  for details. We have pre -specified an α-
level of significance of 0.05 with penalties for a mid -study interim analysis per the O’Brian -Fleming alpha 
spending function allowing for an α-significance level  of 0.005 for the interim analysis and 0.048 for the final 
analysis.  
 
Power Calculation  
The study design is targeted to achieve 80 % power before October of 2017.  Given our 0.[ADDRESS_348634] a 13.52% readmission rate based on estimates,  t his 
requires approximately 320  patient s enrolled per month  (n = 2234) . We assessed the feasibility of this target 
after observ ing there were approximately 508  eligible patients per month based on medical center data  
collected from 10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016 . We noted approximately 11% of these patient would need to be 
excluded after 
randomization  due 
to mis -categorized 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285612] 452 
(n = 3164 , or 1582 
patients per arm ). 
In Table  1, we 
illustrate conservative and ambitious enrollment scenarios  with estimates for 80% and 90% power.  
Considering we have 1 Phone Call Study Nurse and will miss enrollment days for paid time off or sick days, we 
opted for a more conservative power target and detectable differences of 80% and 3.9% respectively .  This 
carries an associated enrollment of 1117 patent per arm (n = 2234, or 11 patients per day).  
 
POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
We anticipate minimal risk to patient as none will receive less than what was the VUMC standard discharge 
practice (no  structured  follow -up call) prior to the initiation of the phone call program in 2016 .  In addition , there 
are no invasive tests or sensitive questions.  The phone call nurse currently is able to attempt calls for 75% of 
all discharged inpatient general medicine patients .  She successfully reach es 30% after an average of 2.[ADDRESS_348635] to observe a benefit from 
exposure to the phone call intervention,6 particu larly in those found to require discharge plan implementation 
assistance.5 Other risks are related to potential breaches in confidentiality in the handling of patient protected 
health information (PHI).  To avoid this, all PHI will be transferred among key study personnel and stored using 
REDCap.   To avoid breaches in confidentia lity induced by [CONTACT_285633] a friend, family member or stranger answering the patient’s phone, she requests identifying information 
before initiating a discussion of the patient discharge care plan.  Health proxi es, caretakers or family members

SIGN IFICAN CE AND IMPACT   
 
The result s of the primary endpoint analysis of this  study will inform  an evidence -based VUMC decision on 
whether to invest in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285597] -up phone call  program  for medical patients  across the 
enterprise . If launched, our sec ondary outcome  analyse s results will inform the design of the program to 
maximize patient benefit.  We intend to  publish  our result in the medical literature to contribute to knowledge on 
the efficacy of post -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285597] -up phone calls as a means of delaying  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394], 
improving patient’s transition from inpatient to outpatient care, and improving patient satisfaction.

Hello, 
 , this is 
 from Vanderbilt. I am calling to follow -up with you 
after your recent visit to our hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. I'd like to ask you a few questions to make sure everything is 
going ok. This could take 10 to 15 minutes - Is this a good time to talk?  
 If Yes proceed;  
 If No - can you give me a time that would be better and I will call you back?  
I see you were in the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] [x]. How are you feeling?

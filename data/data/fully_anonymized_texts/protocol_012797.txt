DESCRIPTION OF THE D ATABASE  AND PREPARATION OF ANALYTICAL FILES  
The OPERA® (Observational Pharmaco -Epi[INVESTIGATOR_446504] & Analysis) database and 
research network is a multi -site observational database built from the complete patient health 
records  managed in Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems from more than 400 participating 
caregivers at 142 separate locations throughout the U.S. (see coverage map , Figure 1 ).  Through 
their membership in OPERA, medical practices meet the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid 
Services (CMS) Merit -based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) Incentive Program for Integration 
with a Specialized Registry.   OPERA -participating physicians and ancillary healthcare providers 
have documented the care of nearly 1 million patients in their EHRs, including over 135,000 
people living with HIV ( PLWH ) of which approximately 20% are women, 47% are Black, 20% are 
Hispanic and representing 11% of all the PWLH in the U.S. The OPERA database is refreshed 
from these EHR systems at each clinic on  a daily basis providing up -to-date data for both 
clinicians and researchers.   In total, there are more than 7 million documented prospective 
visits in the EHR systems for PLWH and 3 million prescriptions written for ART medications. The 
average years of f ollow -up (years of documenting patient visits prospectively in the EHR) for

Data Aggregation Methodology:  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_446505] a variety of analytical reports that support the 
day-to-day care of patients, the management of their patient populations as well as their 
interventional and non -interventional research efforts. By [CONTACT_446523]® with other clinics, clinicians can measure 
and compare quality -of-care anonymously as well as collaborate on resea rch endeavors with 
colleagues in other geographic regions. As a result, all parties have a vested interest in 
maintaining the completeness and accuracy of the medical records stored in the EHR systems.  
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_446506] a number of proprietary algorithms  to sort, classify, and aggregate the data 
pulled from the participating clinics’ EHR systems. The process includes automated 
classification of clinical terms into common clinical terms with review by [CONTACT_185535].

The standardization of the data to common terms and application of the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_446507] a single, homogenous OPERA database for conducting 
research and commercia l analyses. The patient health data gathered, classified and aggregated 
includes complete medical history & social history, visit dates, vital signs, lab orders and results, 
medications, problems & diagnoses, and procedures.   
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_446508]. Data quality methods include common techniques such as:  
·      Detection and reporting of outliers that lead to correction, acceptance, or exclusion 
of observations; these  can include a medical review.  
·      Detection of potentially missing data ( e.g.,  a patient taking ART medications with no 
history of HIV infection to determine whether the use was prophylactic or treatment for 
infection diagnosed elsewhere).  
·      Data completion using multiple observations and sources ( e.g.,  using diagnoses 
codes, free text, past medical history, etc. to determine if patient is naive to HIV 
therapy).  
·      Detection of observations that are known to be (or likely to be) mutually exclus ive 
for a patient ( e.g.,  record of medications that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_446509]).

To normalize across different neutralization assays utilized i n phase 3 studies of various COVID -
19 vaccines, Khoury, et al., estimated that  a 50% protective neutralization level equivalent to 
20% of the mean titer in the convalescent subjects equates to a measured in vitro 
neutralization titer of between 1:10 and 1: 30 was approximate d at 54 international units IU/ml 
(95% CI 30 –96 IU/ml)  against wild -type CoV -19 infection .xx  During the period of COVID -19 
infection where the Delta virus predominated, a quantitative spi[INVESTIGATOR_446511]’s >250  IU/mL was 
deemed adequate,  based on studies that show that an antibody titer of 4-6x wild -type SARS -
CoV-2 were required to effectively neutralize Del ta viral strains .xxi,xxii, xxiii We thus utilized a 
threshold level of > 250 (5x wild -type ab levels)  IU/mL as an adequate vaccine response against 
circulating Delta virus post last vaccination recommended in a series, a level of  <50 IU/mL as a 
non-responsive  post vaccination titer (inadequate for even wild -type Co -V-2 infection) , and 
levels between (5 0-250 IU/mL) as a low vaccine response.  Non and low -responders who had

7. Statistical Analysis  
ANALYSIS OF DEMOGRAP HICS/BASELINE CHARAC TERISTICS  
Demographic and clinical characteristics will be summarized  in the overall population  using 
medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables and frequencies with 
proportions for cat egorical variables.  
 
ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY OBJECTIVES  
Objective #1: COVID -[ADDRESS_567754] by 
[CONTACT_446525], both HIV -positive and 
negative, were non -responders, or who developed low or adequate quantitative Ig spi[INVESTIGATOR_446512] -quantitative spi[INVESTIGATOR_446513] .   
 
Demographic and clinical characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_446526] (IQR) for continuous variables and frequencies with 
proportions for categorical variables. Statistical comparisons betwee n vaccine response level 
will be performed using Pearson’s chi -square or Fisher exact tests for categorical variables and 
Wilcoxon rank -sum test for continuous variables, using an adequate response as the 
comparator.  
 
Incidence rates and 95% confidence int ervals of COVID vaccine adequate response, non-
response and low response to COVID vaccines will be estimated using u nivariate Poisson  
regression . Incidence rates will be obtained both overall and by [CONTACT_338593]. The incidence rate 
is defined as the number of events during follow -up divided by [CONTACT_9702] -time at risk of the event.  
Estimating incidence rates with Poisson regression allows the use of all  person -time time at risk 
of the outcome, even with differential lengths of follow -up between groups.  
 
 
Objective #2: Rate of decline in antibody levels over time by [CONTACT_121814], vaccine type, and 
baseline CD4 count after initial vaccination  
 
Rates and 95% confidence intervals of antibody levels  decay  will be estimated a mong 
individuals with at least two antibody measurements . Univariate linear regression, will be 
employed, using the continuous antibody level as the dependent variable, and timing of tests as 
  Confidential  
   
the dependent variable. Robust variance estimator will be used to account for repeated 
measures. Rates of decay will be produced overall , and stratified by [CONTACT_121814], vaccine type 
and baseline CD4 cell count.  
 
ANALYSIS OF SECONDAR Y OBJECTIVES  
Objective #3: COVID -19 boosters given  
 
In the sub -population of Individuals who received a COVID vaccine booster, the following 
characteristics will be described using medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous 
variables and frequencies with pr oportions for categorical variables: initial and booster vaccine 
types, concordant vs. discordant boosters, duration between initial vaccine completion and 
booster dose, antibody response after the booster, and side effects recorded.  Post vaccination 
respo nses will be determined no earlier than [ADDRESS_567755] vaccination . 
 
 
Objective #4: Rate of decline in antibody levels over time by [CONTACT_121814], booster type, and 
baseline CD4 count after booster vaccination  
 
Rates and 95% confidence intervals for changes in antibody levels will be estimated using linear 
regression , among individuals with at least two antibody measurements, including one after the 
booster dose. Univariate linear regression, will be employed, usi ng the continuous antibody 
level as the dependent variable, and timing of tests as the dependent variable. Robust variance 
estimator will be used to account for repeated measures. Rates of decay will be  produced 
overall, and stratified by [CONTACT_121814], boost er type and baseline CD4 cell count.  
 
 
Objective #5: Recording breakthrough infections after vaccinations and assessing antibody 
levels pre -breakthrough infection  
Among all individuals with full vaccination and antibody testing , the EHR will be search ed for 
documentation  of COVID infection after vaccinations. If breakthrough infections are observed, 
antibody  levels prior to infection will be described. Note: COVID infections may not be recorded 
in the EHR if diagnosed outside of the clinic.

institutional review board (IRB) approval by [CONTACT_446529], including a waiver of informed consent 
and authorization for  use of protected health information  
INFORMED CONSENT  
Informed consent has been waived for this non -interventional, observational research and 
authorization for use of the protected health information has been approved by [CONTACT_446529].  
DATA PRIVACY  & PERSONALLY  IDENTIFIABLE INFORM ATION (PII)  
The data used for this research study are not identifiable by [CONTACT_16133]. However, all 
data, even when stripped of identifiers, are handled and treated, in motion and at rest, as 
though the data could be id entified. All data are managed according to regulations including  
HIPAA and HITECH. These regulations and guidelines expand upon the ethical principles 
detailed in the [ADDRESS_567756] individual level data on serious and non -serious adverse events 
(AEs), pregnancy exposures, device deficiencies and device related events or incidents related 
to any pharmaceutic al product during the conduct of this research, as the minimum criteria 
needed to report AEs, pregnancy exposures, device deficiencies and device related events and 
incidents are not collected. Specifically, the data are insufficient to establish attributi on 
between a potential safety event and an individual using a product as the study design is to 
analyze  deidentified, secondary data collected from individual medical records. Therefore, the 
obligation for reporting any and all adverse events lies with the  healthcare provider at the point 
of care.

9. Administrative Matters  
QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_446514] & procedures governing the use of observational data, the 
development of analysis specifications and plans, the development of analytical programming, 
the analytical quality assurance process and the scientific review of rep orts as well as clinical 
advisory charters for the clinical review of output intended for public domain.    
 
Working practices for the development of analysis specifications include basic identifying 
information, background material, relevant definitions of  key study variables, population 
definitions, baseline definitions, specific requirements for dataset creation, statistical 
requirements such as eligibility criteria, exposures, outcomes and model fitting.   Working 
practices for programming include naming conventions, proper code documentation and 
commentary, content, appearance, efficiencies ( i.e., use of macros), and organization of output, 
maintainability and generalizability.   Working practices for programming quality assurance 
include self -reviews of observational counts, missing data values, many -to-many merges, 
variable formatting, numeric -character & character -numeric conversions, uninitialized 
variables, unresolved macro references, report completeness and report -to-specification 
correspondence, and system errors and logs.    
 
The quality assurance team review may include small sample spot -checking, coding log reviews, 
complete coding review, selected observations from intermediary dataset reviews, and/or 
independent programming to reproduce the results.   Documentation of non -public domain 
reports includes market, scientific, statistical, and c linical review.   Documentation of scientific 
protocols, reports and manuscripts intended for public domain follows two sequential steps: an 
internal -to-Epi[INVESTIGATOR_446515], statistical, and clinical review, followed by a 
clinical/epi[INVESTIGATOR_446516].

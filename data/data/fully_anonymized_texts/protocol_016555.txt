Changes and Rationale  Sections Changed  
Main Change:  
The study design has been modified to include a second 
year of treatment with fasinumab or naproxen. The purpose 
of this modification is to obtain longer -term safety data to 
further elucidate the safety profile of fasinumab.   
The initial 52 -week treatment  period is referred to as Year 1 
and the second 52 -week treatment period is referred to as 
Year 2.   
At the end of the 52 -week treatment period of Year 1, 
patients who are eligible and willing to participate in Year 2 
will continue in the study for a secon d 52-week treatment 
period and will then enter the 20 -week follow up period. 
Patients who are ineligible for Year 2, or are eligible but 
unwilling to enter Year 2, will enter directly into the 
20-week follow -up period at the completion of Year 1.  Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis: Objectives,

Amendment 4 Global  
The primary purpose of this amendment was to incorporate an urgent safety measure, which 
requires discontinuing the 3 mg ever y 4 weeks (Q4W) and 6 mg every 8 weeks (Q8W) dose 
regimens. The recommendation by [CONTACT_9572] (DMC) to 
discontinue these dose regimens was made following a review of unblinded data from an ongoing 
study in the fasinumab phase 3 osteoarthritis program (R475 -PN-1523) and was based on an 
imbalance in clinically relevant adverse events including time to total joint replacement, peripheral 
edema, arthralgia and a trend towards early fractures in the 6 mg Q8W group.  Based on the 
independent DMC review, study of lower dose levels (eg, 1 mg Q4W) may continue to be 
evaluated in this population.  With this amendment, patients randomized to the 3  mg Q4W or 6  mg 
Q8W dose regimens will be permanently discontinued from study drug but encoura ged to 
otherwise complete all remaining study visits and study procedures in the follow up period and the 
end of study phone call.  
Amendment 3 Global (obsolete)  
The primary purpose of this amendment was to update the exclusion criteria to improve patient

CONFIDENTIAL  Exploratory Objectives  
To evaluate additional patient reported outcome measures in patients with 
pain due to OA of the knee or hip  treated for up to 44 weeks with fasinumab, 
compared with placebo or naproxen.  
To evaluate the WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores as well 
as additional patient reported outcome (PRO) measures in patients wit h pain 
due to OA of the knee or hip treated for an additional 52 weeks with 
fasinumab, compared with naproxen pro re nata (prn).   
To evaluate the use of rescue medication in patients with pain due to OA of 
the knee or hip  treated for up to [ADDRESS_79689] a history of inadequate pain relief with 
acetaminophen/parace tamol and a history of intolerance to or inadequate 
pain relief with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (or are unwilling to take opi[INVESTIGATOR_73382]).  
All randomized patients in this study will participate in Year 1, which is 
intended to provide efficacy and safety data for OA patients exposed for up 
to 52 weeks to fasinumab, a non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID) 
comparator (naproxen), or placebo.  At the end of the 52 -week treatment 
period of Year 1, patients who are eligible and willing to participa te in Year 
2 will continue in the study for a second 52 -week treatment period and will 
then enter the 20 -week follow -up period.  Note: As of 26 March 2020, all 
enrollment into Year 2 has been terminated due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  
Any patients currently  enrolled in Year 2 are to remain in the study.  Patients 
who are ineligible for Year 2, or are eligible but unwilling to enter Year 2, 
will enter directly into the 20 -week follow -up period at the completion of 
Year 1.  
Year 2 is intended to provide safety  data for OA patients exposed to 
fasinumab or naproxen for up to 104 weeks (52 weeks in Year 1 and a further 
52 weeks in Year 2).  Note that no patients will receive placebo only in Year 
2 (see Treatment Period for Year 2 below).  Efficacy will be assessed  during 
Year 2 to monitor the risk -benefit profile of fasinumab but, as Year 2 is not 
powered for a formal efficacy analysis, efficacy results will be summarized 
descriptively.  
The overall study period for patients in Year 1 who do not participate in 
Year 2 will be up to approximately 105  weeks including screening and 
pre-randomization.  For these patients, the study consists of a screening 
period of up to 30 days, a 7 to 10 day pre -randomization/washout period 
(7 days with a +3 day window), a [ADDRESS_79690] subcutaneous (SC) dose of study drug.  Eligible patients who choose 
to participate in Year [ADDRESS_79691] dose of SC study drug.

CONFIDENTIAL  Note: As of 17Aug ust 2020, all patients on treatment have been permanently 
discontinued from study drug and will complete t he End of Treatment visit. 
This impacts only patients in the Year 2 treatment period as treatment in 
Year 1 has ended. All patients will be encouraged to complete all remaining 
study visits and procedures in the follow -up period and the end of study 
phone call. 
Screening and Pre -Randomization  
At the screening visit, patients will consent to all study assessments planned 
for Year 1 and will be informed that they could potentially continue in the 
study for the second year if eligible.  Eligibility and consent  for Year 2 will 
be conducted at the end of Year 1.  A pproximately 4 weeks prior to 
randomization, patients will undergo screening procedures, including X -ray 
of the shoulders, hips, and knees, and m agnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
of the index and contrala teral joints must be performed and assessed by [CONTACT_54644].  In addition, any knee or hip joint with a 
Kellgren -Lawrence (K -L) score of ≥[ADDRESS_79692] 4 weeks.  
Patients eligible for the study will complete a 7 to 10 day pre -randomi zation 
period, during which patients will discontinue and/or undergo a washout of 
their standard -of-care pain medications for OA. All pain medications, 
except for the study -provided rescue medication 
(acetaminophen/paracetamol), will be discontinued.  
Rand omization  
At the baseline visit of Year 1, patients will be randomized 3:3:3:1 to the 
following treatment groups as follows:  
• Fasinumab 1  mg SC once every 4 weeks (Q4W) and 
naproxen -matching placebo oral, twice daily  
• Fasinumab 1  mg SC once every 8 weeks (Q8 W) and 
naproxen -matching placebo oral, twice daily  
• Fasinumab -matching placebo SC Q4W and naproxen 500  mg oral, 
twice daily  
• Fasinumab -matching placebo, SC, Q4W and naproxen -matching 
placebo oral, twice daily  
Randomization will be stratified according to the  affected index joint (hip 
or knee), the K -L score (2 to 3 or 4) at the screening visit, and geographical 
region.  
Treatment Period for Year 1 (Baseline to Week 52)  
During the treatment period of Year 1 (day  1 through week  52), patients will 
be permitted to  use only acetaminophen/paracetamol  as rescue medication.  
Patients will record their use of acetaminophen/paracetamol in a diary.  
The study visits during the treatment period will include 1 phone visit on 
day 8 (±1  day).  
Safety and efficacy assessments wi ll be performed and potential events of 
adjudicated arthropathy (AA) and sympathetic nervous system dysfunction

CONFIDENTIAL  Follow -up 
At the end of the treatment period (week 52 for patients participating in Year 
1 only, or week 104E for patients parti cipating in Year 1 and Year 2), 
follow -up of patients will continue for an additional [ADDRESS_79695] to joint replacement surgery (if patient underwent, is 
scheduled for, or is on a wait list for joint replacement surgery). Patients 
who had an AA will have an MRI performed of the affected joint(s).  
Study Duration  The duration of the study for patients who participate in Year 1 only is up 
to approximately 105 weeks, including the screening and pre -randomization 
periods.  The duration of the study for patients who participate in Year 1 and 
Year 2 is up to approximate ly 157 weeks, including the screening and pre -
randomization periods.  Patients who discontinue study drug will be 
requested to return for all scheduled study visits and to complete all planned 
assessments, including phone contacts.  
Population   
 Sample Size:  Enrollment of approximately 2845 patients is planned for this study, which 
includes a total of 285 patients who were enrolled in the fasinumab 3 mg 
SC Q4W and 6 mg SC Q8W groups under earlier versions of the protocol 
before dosing was discontinued du e to the urgent safety measure, and a total 
of approximately 2560 patients who will be randomized to fasinumab 1 mg 
SC Q4W, 1 mg SC Q8W, naproxen, and placebo.  
Approximately 840 patients will be randomized to the fasinumab 1 mg 
SC Q4W group, 840 patients to the naproxen -only group, and 280 patients 
to the placebo group. An estimated 600 patients will be randomized to the 
fasinumab 1 mg Q8W group.

Safety:  Safety endpoints for Year 1 (all randomized and treated patients)  
Safety endpoints for Year 1 (through week 52) will include:  
• Incidence of adjudicated arthropathy (AA) (as confirmed by 
[CONTACT_73431])  
• Incidence of destructive arthropathy (DA) (as confirmed by 
[CONTACT_73431])  
• Incidenc e of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Incidence of sympathetic nervous system dysfunction (as 
diagnosed after consultation with an appropriate specialist, such as 
a neurologist and/or cardiologist)  
• Incidence of peripheral sensory AEs that require  a neurology or 
other specialty consultation  
• Incidence of all -cause joint replacements (JRs)  
The incidence of JRs at the telephone survey [ADDRESS_79697] dose of 
study drug (week 100) will also be evaluated.  
Safety endpoints for Year 2 (all randomized and treated patients 
proceeding into Year 2)  
The safety endpoints listed above for Year [ADDRESS_79698] dose of study drug given in Year 2 through week 104E (end 
of treatment), as well as for the periods of Year [ADDRESS_79699] dose of study drug (week 152E) will also be evaluated.  
Procedures and Assessments  At the screening visit, patients will provide informed consent, medical 
history, and medication history.  Determination of the K -L score of the knee 
or hip will be performed to establish a diagnosis of OA based on the 
American College of Rheumatology criteria using a K -L score cutoff of ≥2.  
Patients will be assessed for childbearing potential and complete a 
self-reported assessment of peripheral or central pain.  
Efficacy in Year 1 will be assessed by [CONTACT_73432], the PGA, the Numeric  
Rating Scale of the average walking index joint pain, the EuroQoL 5 
Dimensions 5 Level Questionnaire, the 36-item Short Form Survey , the 
Healthcare Resource Utilization Questionnaire, the Work Productivity and 
Activity Impairment -Osteoarthritis questionna ire, and the Treatment 
Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication.  The WOMAC total and stiffness 
scores will also be evaluated.  Efficacy in Year 2 will be assessed by [CONTACT_73433], the Eu roQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Level Questionnaire and the Work 
Productivity and Activity Impairment -Osteoarthritis questionnaire.  
Safety assessments will be performed at each study visit and upon 
occurrence of any joint adverse events (AEs) .  Potential events of AA  will 
be monitored via clinical signs and symptoms of worsening joint pain during 
the study and adjudication of pre -operative imaging for patients who

JR surgery (if patient underwent, is scheduled for, or is on a wait list for JR 
surgery). Patients who had an AA will have an MRI perfor med of the 
affected joint(s).  
Statistical Plan  Statistical Hypothesis  
There are 29 hypotheses for the primary and key secondary endpoints.  The 
primary endpoint comparison of study drug with placebo for the WOMAC 
pain and physical function subscale scores will be declared superior only if 
the comparisons are significant for both WOMAC pain and physical 
function subscale scores.  A graphical testing procedure will be applied to 
control for multiplicity and to maintain study -wise Type I error rate at a  two-
sided 0.05 level for the hypotheses (H 1,i, i=1,…,16 for fasinumab 1 mg 
Q4W, and H 2,i, i=1,…,13 for fasinumab 1 mg Q8W) for the primary and key 
secondary endpoints. If a hypothesis is rejected, the alpha level for that 
hypothesis will be reallocated to  other hypotheses according to the 
pre-specified procedure.  
Justification of FAS and mFAS Sample Size  
The planned sample size was expected to provide adequate power for the 
comparisons between fasinumab doses and naproxen at week 16 for the 
WOMAC pain and physical function scores and the PGA score and provide 
long term data for safety assessment.  
The sample size for the full analysis set (FAS) population was based on 
results of the WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores and the 
PGA from the R475 -PN-1227 study.  The calculation of sample size 
assumed a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.025 and a 15% dropout rate up to week 
16 and a 30% dropout rate up to week  52.  Enrollment of [ADDRESS_79701] 99% power to detect an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_79702] provided 99% power to detect an effect 
size of 0.[ADDRESS_79703] deviation (SD) of 1.1 at week 16, and 98% power at week 52 for 
the FAS.  
For the fasinumab 1 mg Q8W group, the 600 patients in the FAS population 
were to be compared to approximately 200 patients in the placebo  group 
who were enrolled under amendment 5 global. For such comparisons, a 
2-sided alpha level of 0.025 and a 15% dropout rate up to week 16, and a 
30% dropout rate up to week 52, were assumed. Additionally, the effect size 
for such comparisons was assumed  to be 80% of the effect size for the 
comparison between fasinumab [ADDRESS_79704] provided 
97% pow er to detect an effect size of 0.368 (=0.46*80%) in the WOMAC 
pain and physical function subscale scores at week 16 and 93% power at 
week 52.  This sample size would have provided 84% power to detect an 
                                        VV-RIM-00122598-1.0 Approved - 26 Aug 2020 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_79705] size of 0.288 (=0.36*80%) in PGA at week 16, a nd 75% power at 
week 52 for the FAS.  
The sample size calculation was also based on previously reported results of 
the WOMAC pain subscale and physical function subscale and the PGA for 
naproxen.  Assuming a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.025 and a 15% dropout ra te 
up to week  16 and a 30% dropout rate up to week  52, an enrollment of [ADDRESS_79706] 97% power to detect an effect size of 0.22 in the 
WOMAC pain subscale at week 16 and 93 % power at week [ADDRESS_79707] provided 98% power to detect an effect size of 
0.24 in WOMAC physical function subscale (ie, absolute treatment 
difference of 0.50 with a SD of 2.1) at week 16 and 96% power at week [ADDRESS_79708] provided 87% power to detect an 
effect size of 0.18 in PGA at week 16 between fasinumab 1 mg Q4W and 
naproxen for the FAS.  
Due to regional irregularities noted in a parallel phase 3 study that became 
fully apparent only aft er unblinding that study, and the concern that the same 
irregularities would be present in data from similar sites in this study, the 
population for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses was changed in 
Protocol Amendment 8 to be based on a modified f ull analysis set (mFAS) 
that excludes the randomization stratum for that region.  Based on the 
assumptions above, it is estimated that this mFAS will provide:  
• 99.9% power to detect a significant difference between the 
1 mg Q4W group and the placebo group i n the WOMAC pain 
and physical function subscales at an alpha level of 0.05  
• 42% and 46% power to detect a significant difference between 
the 1 mg Q8W group and the placebo group in WOMAC pain 
and physical function subscales, respectively, at an alpha level 
of 0.01  
• 99.9% power to detect a significant difference between the 
[ADDRESS_79709] model for repeated measure (MMRM) based 
on the mFAS with adjustment for missing data due to lac k of efficacy, death 
or AEs assuming the WOMAC scores would on average return to baseline 
values. The imputed data for patients discontinued from the study treatment 
due to lack of efficacy, death or AEs will be centered at the mean baseline 
value. The mis sing data for patients who discontinued treatment due to other 
reasons will be imputed under missing -at-random assumption. Sensitivity

CONFIDENTIAL  For analysis of continuous secondary endpoints at fixed timepoints (ie, week 
16 and week 44), the analysis method will be the same as that used for the 
primary efficacy endpoints. For the analysis of secondary endpoints 
involving the averaging over several visits, analysis will be performed using 
a multiple imputation approach with an ANCOVA model based on the 
mFAS with adjustment for missing data performed in the same manner as 
was done for the primary endpoint.  For analy sis of secondary endpoints that 
are categorical variables, eg, proportions of patients with ≥30% 
improvement in the WOMAC pain subscale scores at week 16, the Cochran

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION   
1.1. Background  
Chronic musculoskeletal pain affects a large portion of the global population.  A significant cause 
of chronic musculoskeletal pain is due to osteoarthritis (OA).  Osteoarthritis is a progressive, 
chronic disease caused by [CONTACT_73435] e joints, which leads to pain in 
the hips, knees, hands, feet, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  It is characterized by [CONTACT_73436], osteophyte formation at the joint 
margins, thickening o f the joint capsule and mild synovitis.  Symptoms and disability increase 
with increasing age.  The prevalence of OA in patients aged 65 and older is 60% in men and 70% 
in women, and continually rising ( Sarzi -Puttini  2005 ). 
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the mainstay of treatment in patients with 
mild-to-moderate OA.  The efficacy of NSAIDs is well -documented, albeit modest, but their use 
is associated with a number of risks ( Bingham  2007 ) (Bjordal  2004 ) (Makarowski  2002 ) 
(Silverstein  2000 ).  The risks associated with long -term therapy with NSAIDs, in particular, have 
been well -characterized and include gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and increased risk of 
cardiovascular events ( Lanas  2011 ) (Trelle  2011 ).  Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs have 
limited efficacy in many OA patients; those with advanced OA typi[INVESTIGATOR_73384] . 
Treatment guidelines for OA suggest that opi[INVESTIGATOR_73385], intolerable, or otherwise contraindicated.  However, the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_73386], nausea and vomiting, constipation, and potential for 
abuse and dependence.  In addition, opi[INVESTIGATOR_73387], including drowsiness, dizziness, gastrointestinal intolerability , mo tor imbalance, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], and even death.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_73388].  Moreover, there is no evidence to 
support superiority of opi[INVESTIGATOR_73389].  While the efficacy of opi[INVESTIGATOR_73390] a short duration is supported by [CONTACT_73437], long -term efficacy has not been 
evaluated.  
Thus, there remains an unmet medical need for alternative treatment options to opi[INVESTIGATOR_73391] 
a more effective analgesic effect, particularly since there are a significant number of patients who 
are intolerant to or do not get adequate pain relief from the currently available treatment options.  
Inadequate pain relief has a profound impa ct on the quality of life for millions of people worldwide 
with an associated substantial cost to society, including healthcare cost ( Salmon  2016 ) and loss of 
productivity ( Dibonaventura  2011 ). 
Neurotrophins are a family of peptide growth factors that play a role in the development, 
differentiation, survival and death of neuronal and non -neuronal cells ( Chao  2006 ).  Nerve growth 
factor (NGF) was the first neurotrophin to be identified, and its role in the development and 
survival of both peripheral and central neurons during the development of the nervous system is 
well characterized ( Crowley  1994 ) (Smeyne  1994 ).  In the adult, NGF is not required as a survival 
factor but acts as a pain mediator that sensitizes neurons ( Pezet  2006 ).  Nerve growth factor activity 
is mediated through 2 different membrane -bound receptors, the high -affinity tyrosine kinase type 
1 (TrkA) and the low -affinity p75 neurotrophin receptors.

CONFIDENTIAL  By [CONTACT_73438], the NGF/TrkA system appears to play 
a major role in the control of pain.  Administration of NGF has been shown to provoke pain in 
both rodents ( Lewin  1994 ) and humans ( McArthur  2000 ), while NGF antagonists have been 
shown to prevent hyperalgesia and allodynia in animal models of neuropathic and chronic 
inflammatory pain ( Ramer  1999 ).  Humans with mutations in TrkA (hereditary sensory and 
autonomic neuropathy IV) or NGF (hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy V) have been 
identified with a loss of deep pain percep tion ( Einarsdottir  2004 ) (Indo 1996 ).  In addition, NGF 
is known to be elevated in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other types 
of arthritis ( Aloe  1992 ) (Halliday  1998 ), and to be up -regulated in injured and inflamed tissues in 
conditions such as cysti tis, prostatitis, and chronic headache ( Lowe  1997 ) (Miller  2002 ) 
(Sarchielli  2001 ). 
Fasinumab (also known as REGN475) is a fully -human high -affinity monoclonal antibody 
directed against NGF.  By [CONTACT_73439], fasinumab has the potential to be effective 
in modulating NGF -associated pain without some of the adverse side effect s of other analgesic 
medications, such as opi[INVESTIGATOR_73392].  Following an evaluation of the safety and tolerability 
of the antibody in a single -ascending -dose first -in-human study (study  R475 -PN-0817), a 
proof -of-concept study evaluating the effect of fa sinumab on pain in 217  patients with OA of the 
knee was completed (study R475 -PN-0901, see current version of the Fasinumab Investigator’s 
Brochure).  Three intravenous (IV) doses of fasinumab were evaluated (0.03,  0.1, 0.3  mg/kg every 
8 weeks [Q8W]).  All  three doses, compared with placebo, were associated with statistically 
significant improvement in pain as evaluated by [CONTACT_73440], the Western Ontario and 
McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and the Patient’s Global Impression of Change 
question naire.  Additionally, the R475 -PN-1227 study in patients with OA revealed significant 
efficacy in the WOMAC pain subscale score for each of the doses of fasinumab evaluated (1 mg, 
3 mg, 6  mg, and 9  mg given every 4 weeks [Q4W]) compared with placebo (see c urrent version 
of the Investigator’s Brochure).   Results from recent clinical studies with other anti -NGF 
antibodies, tanezumab ([COMPANY_007]) and fulranumab (Janssen), also support the role of NGF in pain 
modulation in patients with pain due to OA of the knee a nd hip ( Brown  2012 ) (Hefti  2006 ) 
(Lane  2010 ) and in patients with chronic low back  pain ( Katz  2011 ) (Kivitz  2013 ). 
In all clinical studies completed to date, fasinumab was generally well tolerated.  Arthralgia, joint 
swell ing, peripheral edema, hypoesthesia, and myalgia were more frequently reported in 
fasinumab -treated patients than in placebo -treated patients.  In neurological evaluations, 
abnormalities in vibration sense were more frequent in the fasinumab patients than in the placebo 
patients.  These adverse events (AEs) or physical examination abnormalities associated with 
fasinumab were generally mild to moderate in intensity and were transient (see current version of 
the Investigator’s Brochure).  
Data from studies of tanezumab and fulranumab demonstrated these molecules were associated 
with an increased risk of destructive arthropathy (DA), a unique clinical form of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_73393].  
Analyses of the tanezumab data by [CONTACT_23662], defined by [CONTACT_73441] (JR), revealed that the risk of DA increases with 
tanezumab dose and is further increased with the concomitant use of chronic  NSAIDs (>90  days) 
(Lane  2010 ).  Most cases of DA occurred in joints with a documented history of OA.

CONFIDENTIAL  Based on the potential risk of DA identified in tanezumab and fulranumab, the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) placed this class of anti -NGF antibodies on clinical hold in 2010.  Following 
a review of anti -NGF antibody clinical data in March 2012, the FDA determined that clinical 
studies of anti -NGF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73394] s are implemented to minimize 
the risk of DA.  To address concerns about potential events of DA, a risk -mitigation approach is 
also being implemented for all fasinumab studies, as outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  This approach 
includes sensitive, prospective, and rigorous radiologic screening and monitoring for select 
changes in joint structure.  The patients who develop these changes, which are ref erred to 
throughout this document as adjudicated arthropathy (AA), are required to discontinue study 
therapy.  
Since the removal of the FDA clinical hold, Regeneron has conducted or initiated several clinical 
trials of fasinumab.  In all clinical studies t o date, fasinumab was associated with a low rate of 
discontinuations due to adverse events.  Patients treated with fasinumab generally had more 
frequent events than did placebo -treated patients of arthralgia, joint swelling, peripheral edema, 
altered perip heral sensation (eg, paresthesia, dysesthesia), and myalgia.  
In 2012, studies of other anti -NGF monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) identified adverse changes in 
the sympathetic nervous system of mature animals of several species (rat and non -human primate).  
These effects include a reversible decrease in neuron volume.  To date, no statistically significant 
or consistent effects of fasinumab on the sympathetic nervous system have been detected in animal 
studies with up to 6 -months of treatment.  Nonetheless, base d on the potential risk of sympathetic 
nervous system toxicity associated with these other anti -NGF mAbs in animal studies, a risk 
mitigation approach is being implemented for all fasinumab studies, as outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
In the phase 2/3 study of fasinumab in patients with pain due to OA of the knee or hip 
(R475 -PN-1227), 26 AA events occurred in 24  patients.  There was an increase in AA even ts that 
appeared to be related to greater fasinumab dose.  Although these events were milder than the 
severe DA events presented at the 2012 FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee, in consideration of 
the lack of an observed dose response for efficacy in OA, the  benefit -risk ratio was deemed 
unfavorable for the fasinumab 6  mg Q4W and 9  mg Q4W doses in patients with OA, in comparison 
to the other fasinumab doses that were studied (ie, 1 mg Q4W and 3 mg Q4W). The dose regimens 
that were being evaluated in the phase  3 studies for OA pain in the knee or hip included 1 mg 
Q8W, 1 mg Q4W, 3 mg Q4W, and 6  mg Q8W. In April 2018, the independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) recommended discontinuing 6 mg Q8W and 3 mg Q4W (expected to have 
similar exposure to 6 mg Q8W) ba sed on a review of unblinded data in an ongoing study in the 
fasinumab phase 3 OA program (R475 -PN-1523). Subsequently, a small Regeneron team 
reviewed the data and agreed with this recommendation.  The DMC noted imbalances in clinically 
relevant adverse e vents including time to total joint replacement, peripheral edema, arthralgia and 
a trend towards early fractures.  The phase [ADDRESS_79714]  2020, the 
independent DMC recommended termination of the fasinumab program.  The recommendation 
was based on a review of the totality of evidence, including the emerging unblinded data. Based 
on the independent DMC recommendation, the sponsor has disconti nued dosing with fasinumab.  
At the time of this recommendation and amendment, the only patients to be impacted are the 
patients participating in the optional Year 2 portion of the R475 -OA-1611 study.  These patients 
will be encouraged to enter the Year 2 safety follow -up period.

1.2. Summary of Risks and Benefits to Patients Participating in this 
Study  
As discussed above in Section  1.1, there are potential risks and benefits to patients participating in 
the study. Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure and informed consent form (ICF) for 
additional detailed information and analysis of the potential risks and benefits associated  with 
fasinumab administration.  Pain due to OA is a condition that results in significant morbidity and 
disability as well as marked loss of productivity. There is a significant unmet medical need for 
treatments with this condition. In Study R475 -OA-1611,  patients with pain due to OA will be 
randomized to fasinumab, naproxen or placebo; each of these treatment groups presents potential 
benefits and risks to patients as described below.  
• Fasinumab  
Fasinumab represents a potentially effective therapy that may  be beneficial to patients who do not 
achieve adequate pain relief, are unable to tolerate existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or have absolute or relative 
contraindications to existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73395].  Previous fasinumab study 
(R475 -PN-1227) res ults have further confirmed earlier efficacy observations and demonstrate that 
fasinumab provides significant pain relief compared to placebo in OA patients across all doses 
administered.  Some common side effects seen in patients treated with fasinumab ar e joint -related 
events such as joint pain, joint/limb swelling, joint damage, new or worsening OA and occurrence 
of joint replacement surgery, and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092].  The joint damage that has been 
observed usually occurred in a knee or hip  and sometimes in multiple joints. The joint damage 
occurred with or without increased joint pain and, at times, was more rapid and more severe than 
what is normally seen with OA.  Some patients treated with fasinumab who develop this joint 
damage have had  a higher chance of undergoing joint replacement surgery.  In addition, this higher 
risk of joint replacement surgery has also been noted in fasinumab -treated patients who did not 
develop joint damage.  Further, this joint damage occurred more frequently i n patients who 
received NSAIDs along with drugs of the group of anti -NGF and, therefore, concomitant 
administration of fasinumab and NSAIDs, apart from low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], is prohibited in this study. 
Other adverse effects that have been seen in patients tak ing fasinumab include a risk of bone 
fracture and altered peripheral sensation, including hypoesthesia and paraesthesia.  Some patients 
had pain, numbness, or tingling in their wrist/hand and found to have carpal tunnel syndrome, 
which was sometimes treate d with a surgical procedure. Finally, events associated with 
sympathetic nervous system dysfunction are being closely monitored due to findings from animal 
studies, although to date, this hasn’t been observed in patients treated with fasinumab.  
                                        VV-RIM-00122598-1.0 Approved - 26 Aug 2020 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_79716] 2020, the independent DMC recom mended that the fasinumab program be stopped.  The 
Sponsor has discontinue d dosing with fasinumab. The only patients impacted were  the patients 
participating in the optional Year 2 portion of the R475 -OA-1611 study. The Sponsor believes it 
is important to continue off -treatment follow -up for all active patients in the study to complete 
safety follow -up. This safety follow -up is important to understand the benefit/risk for fasinumab.  
• Naproxen  
The benefits and risks of naproxen, an NSAID, at the recommended d osage are well documented. 
NSAIDs are efficacious and are the mainstay of treatment in patients with mild -to-moderate OA. 
The most frequently reported side effects of naproxen include cardiovascular events (eg, edema), 
gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, abdomi nal pain, nausea, and constipation), dermatological events 
(pruritus, skin eruptions), central nervous system (headache, dizziness, drowsiness) and dyspnea. 
Additional side effects include abnormal renal function, anemia, anaphylactoid reactions, 
gastroint estinal bleeding, hyper - and hypoglycemia, and renal failure.  
The overall benefit risk profile for naproxen is favorable.  
• Placebo  
The main potential risks associated with placebo are the lack of, or inadequate pain relief.  
Measures taken to minimize the risks associated with placebo use are as follows:  
• Availability of rescue medication (acetaminophen/paracetamol).  
• Patients can withdraw from the study at any time if pain persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_73396]/paracetamol at the recommended dosage.  
Please refer to Section  3.[ADDRESS_79717] (see Section  8.1 for details ).

3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE   
3.1. Hypothesis  
Based on results from previous clinical studies of fasinumab in patients with OA, fasinumab is 
expected to provide effective pain relief based on  an improvement in the WOMAC pain sub -scale 
score and improved functionality based on the WOMAC physical function sub -scale.  
                                        VV-RIM-00122598-1.0 Approved - 26 Aug 2020 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_79718] a 
history of inadequate pain relief from acetaminophen/paracetamol and a history of intolerance to 
or inadequate pain relief from opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (or are unwilling to take opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) for OA pain management.   
The target study population was chosen because they currently have unmet medical needs with 
respect to incomplete pain control , despi[INVESTIGATOR_73397].  The study will be 
conducted with appropriate eligibility criteria to exclude patients who may be at risk for events of 
joint damage and sympathetic nervous system effects.  
Year 1  
All randomized patients in this study wi ll participate in Year 1, which is intended to provide 
efficacy and safety data for OA patients exposed for up to 52 weeks to fasinumab, an NSAID 
comparator (naproxen), or placebo.  At the end of the 52 -week treatment period of Year 1, patients 
who are eli gible and willing to participate in a second 52 -week treatment period will enter Year 2 
(see below).  Patients who are ineligible for Year 2, or are eligible but unwilling to enter Year 2, 
will enter directly into a 20 -week follow -up period at the completi on of Year 1 and thereby [CONTACT_73442] 1 portion of the study.  
At the screening visit, patients will consent to all study assessments planned for Year 1 and will 
be informed that they could potentially continue in the study for the second ye ar if eligible.  
Eligibility and consent for Year 2 will be conducted at the end of Year 1.  Note: As of [ADDRESS_79719] inadequate 
pain relief from acetaminophen/paracetamol.  As there are currently a limited number of 
therapeutic options available f or these patients, enrollment of this study population supports 
equipoise with respect to randomization of patients to fasinumab or to placebo.   
The patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_73443] (hip or knee), by [CONTACT_73444] -Lawrence 
(K-L) score (2  to 3, or 4), and by [CONTACT_73445] (as 
defined in Section  5.1).  The K -L stratification scheme is used here to ensure that there is an equal 
distribution of patients with the most severe OA at baseline across the dosing groups.  
The inclusion of a placebo treatment group in Year [ADDRESS_79720] associated clinically significant AEs.  
As naproxen is a commonly used and highly effective NSAID ( Ong 2007 ), it has been selected as 
the com parator drug for this study.  
Inclusion of both the placebo group and the active treatment comparator group in Year [ADDRESS_79721] of 
                                        VV-RIM-00122598-1.0 Approved - 26 Aug 2020 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_79722] regular study visits and 
receive dia gnostic procedures (ie, X -rays, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) to evaluate their 
ongoing OA.  Adverse event monitoring will be ongoing throughout the trial.  Patients and 
investigators can choose to end participation at any time.   
Acetaminophen/paracet amol will be made available as rescue treatment for any patient as 
appropriate.  Therefore, the use of a placebo group is justified, as placebo -treated patients will not 
be placed at significant risk.   
Year 2  
Year 2 is intended to provide safety data for OA patients exposed to fasinumab or naproxen for up 
to 104 weeks (52 weeks in Year 1 and a further 52 weeks in Year 2).  Efficacy during Year [ADDRESS_79723] s only patients in the Year 2 treatment period as treatment in Year 1 ha s ended. All patients 
will be  encouraged to complete all remaining study visits and procedures in the follow -up period 
and the end of study phone call.  
Patients who were randomized to fasinumab in Year 1 will continue treatment with the same 
fasinumab dose regimen in Year 2.  Patients  who were randomized to a fixed dose of naproxen in 
Year 1 will receive naproxen pro re nata (prn) in Year 2.  To maintain the study blind, patients on 
fasinumab will receive naproxen -matching placebo prn and patients on naproxen will receive 
fasinumab -matching placebo Q4W.  
A fasinumab -matching placebo/naproxen -matching placebo group will not be included in Year [ADDRESS_79724] patients who are experiencing moderate -to-severe pain due to their OA go for an 
entire 2 -year period with only rescue medicatio n of acetaminophen/paracetamol available to them

matching placebo in Year 1 will be switched to naproxen prn (and fasinumab -matching placebo 
Q4W) for the second year of treatment to ensure they have access to some form of pain medication 
in addition to acetaminophen/paracetamol.  
As in Year 1, all patients in Year [ADDRESS_79725] regular study visits and receive diagnostic procedures 
(ie, X -rays, MRI) to evaluate their ongoing  OA.  Adverse event monitoring will be ongoing 
throughout the trial.  Patients and investigators can choose to end participation at any time.

CONFIDENTIAL  3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
Previous versions of this protocol randomized patients to receive fixed -dose, subcutaneous (SC) 
injections of 1  mg of fasinumab Q4W, 3  mg fasinumab Q4W, 6  mg fasinumab Q8W (with 
alternating placebo injections at the month ly visits where fasinumab will not be given, to maintain 
the blind), naproxen active comparator, or matching placebo. Based on April 2018 
recommendations from the independent DMC for this study that reviewed unblinded data from a 
different ongoing phase 3 study of fasinumab (R475 -PN-1523), the decision was made to 
discontinue further evaluation of fasinumab at 3 mg Q4W or 6 mg Q8W in the phase 3 program. 
This recommendation was based on an imbalance in clinically relevant adverse events including 
time to to tal joint replacement, peripheral edema, arthralgia and a trend towards fractures.  Under 
amendment 4 global, all patients previously randomized to 3 mg Q4W or 6 mg Q8W under an 
earlier version of the protocol were discontinued from study drug, but encouraged to otherwise 
continue all protocol visits and study procedures in the follow -up period and the end of study phone 
call. Based on the independent DMC review, study of lower dose levels (eg,1 mg Q4W) may 
continue to be evaluated in the OA populati on.  Given the discontinuation of the [ADDRESS_79726] evaluated in R475 -PN-1523.  
Clinical trial data, including PK data, that support selection of these fasinumab doses include those 
from the phase  1 studies in healthy volunteers (R475 -PN-0817 and TDU -[ZIP_CODE]), the 
R475 -PN-0901 phase 2 proof -of-concept study in patients wi th pain due to OA of the knee, the 
R475 -PN-1227  phase 2/3 study in patients with OA of the hip or knee, the R475 -PN-0908 
single -dose, proof -of concept study in patients with sciatic pain.  
Single subcutaneous (SC) doses of fasinumab of up to [ADDRESS_79727] IV dose (1  mg/kg).  The occurrence of neurosensory AEs, which were transient and 
non-severe, led to the decision to refrain from escalating above the 1  mg/kg IV dose and instead, 
to expand enrollment of the 1  mg/kg IV cohort.  
In the R475 -PN-0901 phase  2 proof -of-concept study of fasinumab i n patients with pain due to 
OA of the knee, multiple IV doses of up to 0.3  mg/kg administered Q8W demonstrated efficacy 
with regard to pain relief and were well tolerated in Caucasian subjects.  All 3  doses of fasinumab 
(0.03 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, and 0.3 mg/k g IV Q8W) were associated with greater improvement 
compared with placebo in walking index knee pain, standardized total WOMAC score, WOMAC 
subscales (pain, function, and stiffness) and Patient’s Global Impression of Change.  However, it 
was noted that pain  relief had the slowest onset with the lowest (0.03  mg/kg) dose.   
In the R475 -PN-1227 phase  2 study of fasinumab in patients with pain due to OA of the hip or 
knee, all SC doses (1  mg, 3  mg, 6 mg, and 9  mg Q4W) demonstrated efficacy in pain relief and 
physical function measures, based upon WOMAC pain and physical function scales assessed after 
16 weeks of treatment.  Considering the relative lack of an observed dose response for efficacy 
and increased risk of AA with both the 9  mg and 6  mg Q4W doses, the l atter doses are no longer

been discontinued.  
All randomized patients in Year 1 will receive orally administered naproxen (500 mg twice daily) 
or matching placebo.  The [ADDRESS_79729], approved dose for pain 
associated with OA.   
All patients who choose to enter Year 2 will take 500 mg naproxen as needed (ie, prn), which is 
considered standard -of-care for pain associated with OA, or naproxen -matching placebo prn.  The 
prn dosing schedule was chosen considering the known safety profile associated with chronic 
NSAID use.  In general, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration taking 
into consideration the patient’s medical history , concomitant medications, comorbidities, and age.  
The maximum dose allowed will be no more than the amount allowed during Year 1 (ie, 500 mg 
twice daily).

be performed at screening and the results assessed by [CONTACT_11343].  In addition, an 
MRI will be performed on any knee or hip joint with a K -L score of ≥3.  Randomiza tion visits 
cannot occur until there is confirmation from the central imaging vendor that there are no 
exclusionary findings on the X -rays and any required MRIs.   During the screening period, all 
patients will continue to take their current treatment regim en for OA pain, which must include  use 
of an oral NSAID on a regular basis, defined as approximately [ADDRESS_79739] 4 
weeks.   
Patients eligible for the study will complete a pre -randomization period, during which all pain 
medication, except  for the study -provided rescue medication (acetaminophen/paracetamol), will 
be discontinued.  The pre -randomization visit will be 7  to 10  days (7 days with a +3 day window) 
before the randomization visit.  Patients will discontinue and/or undergo a washout  of, their 
standard -of-care pain medications for OA during the pre -randomization period.  As needed, 
patients may take acetaminophen/paracetamol for pain relief according to the regional 
standard -of-care (see Section  7.2 for details).  Acetaminophen/paracetamol must not be taken 
within 24 hours prior to the randomization visit.  
5.1.2.  Rescreening  
Re-testing During Screening or Pre -randomization  
An assessment that fails to meet eligibility criteria may be repeated once within the screening or 
pre-randomization period when approved by [CONTACT_73448]: 1) the failure is believed by [CONTACT_20616] r to be due to a 
condition that would resolve or could be treated, or 2) a laboratory value minimally exceeds the 
cut-off value and is not clinically relevant. Only the assessments that did not meet the eligibility 
criteria require repetition, if done with in the screening period or pre -randomization period. Patients 
may not repeat any assessments if they do not meet the WOMAC criteria or have orthostatic 
hypotension (defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) during the screening or pre -randomization visit.  
Rescreening Due to Screen Failure  
Rescreening can be completed for patients who fail to meet the screening visit window 
requirements or who are unable to complete all imaging assessments within the specified screening 
period.  Patients who are rescreened after the pre -randomization window must be declared screen 
failures, be registered in the IVRS as a new patient with a new identification number, and then 
repeat al l screening procedures, with the exception of imaging assessments. Any imaging 
assessments would need to be repeated only if they were taken more than [ADDRESS_79740]

Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) during the screening or pre-randomization visit.  
5.1.3.  Randomization  
Enrollment of approximately 2845 patients is planned for this study, which includes a total of 
285 patients who were enrolled in the fasinumab 3 mg SC Q4W and 6 mg SC Q8W groups under 
earlier versions of the protocol before dosing was discontinued due to the urgent safety measure, 
and a total of approximately 2560 patients who will be randomized to fasinumab 1 mg SC Q4W, 
1 mg SC Q8W, naproxen, and placebo.  
At the baseline visit of Year 1, patients will be randomized 3 :3:3:1 to the following treatment 
groups as follows:  
• Fasinumab 1  mg SC Q4W  
• Fasinumab 1 mg SC Q8W  
• Naproxen 500  mg oral, twice daily  
• Placebo  
Prior to amendment 5 global, it is estimated that approximately 560 patients were randomized as 
follows: 240 pati ents to the fasinumab 1 mg SC Q4W group, 240 patients to the naproxen -only 
group and 80 patients to the placebo group. Under amendment 5 global, a further 2000 patients 
were planned to be randomized as follows: 600 patients to the fasinumab 1 mg SC Q4W gro up, 
600 patients to the naproxen -only group, 200 patients to the placebo group, and 600 patients to the 
newly added fasinumab 1 mg SC Q8W group.  Thus, overall, this study will enroll approximately 
2560  patients as follows: 840 patients to the fasinumab 1  mg SC Q4W group, 600 patients to the 
1 mg SC Q8W group, 840 patients to the naproxen group, and 280 patients to the placebo group.  
Prior to amendment 5 global, approximately 285 patients were enrolled in the fasinumab 3  mg SC 
Q4W and fasinumab 6 mg SC Q8W groups. However, dosing in these patients was discontinued, 
as recommended by [CONTACT_73449]  2018.   
Patients will receive treatment as described in Section  7.1. Randomization will be stratified 
according to the affected index joint (hip or knee), the K -L score (2 to 3 or 4) at the screening visit, 
and geographical region.   
Eligible patients who choose to participate in Year 2 will not be re -randomized at week 52.  See 
Section  7.1 for treatment assignments in Year 2.  
5.1.4.  Treatment Period for Year 1  
During the treatment period (day  1 through week  52), patients will be permitted to use only 
acetaminophen/paracetamol as rescue medication. The study visits during the treatment period will 
include 1 phone visit on day  8 (±1  day). Patients will record thei r use of 
acetaminophen/paracetamol in a diary. Patients should discontinue use of acetaminophen/ 
paracetamol at least 24 hours prior to the start of each study visit in order to minimize the 
confounding effects of the rescue medication on efficacy measurem ents.

5 Level Questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L), the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of the average walking index 
joint pain, the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment -Osteoarthritis (WPAI -OA), the 
Healthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU) questionnaire, and the Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM).  The WOMAC total and stiffness scores will also be 
evaluated.  
Safety assessments will be performed at each study visit during treatment period, as outlined in 
Table  1. 
At the end of the treatment period, patients will either enter the 20 -week follow -up period or will 
be offered by [CONTACT_73451] 2, if eligible.  
5.1.5.  Treatment Period for Year 2  
During the treatment period of Year 2 (week  52E through week 104E ), patients will be permitted 
to use only acetaminophen/paracetamol as rescue medication.  Patients will record their use of 
acetaminophen/paracetamol in a diary.  Patients should discontinue use of 
acetaminophen/  paracetamol at least 24 hours prior to the  start of each study visit in order to 
minimize the confounding effects of the rescue medication on efficacy measurements.  
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_73450], the EQ -5D-5L and the WPAI -OA.  The WOMAC total and stiffness scores will 
also be evaluated.  
Safety assessments will be performed at each study visit during treatment period, as outlined in 
Table  2. 
5.1.6.  Follow -Up Period  
At the end of the treatment period (week 52 for patients participating in Year 1 only, or week 104E 
for patients participating in Year 1 and Year 2), follow -up of patients will continue for an 
additional 20 weeks .  Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed according to the schedule 
outlined in Table  1 (for patients participating in Year 1 only) or Table  2 (for patients participating 
in Year 1 and Year 2) . 
If a patient must undergo JR surgery during the study, he or she will be asked to complete 
pre-operative imaging and to undergo post -surgery follow -up as outlined in Table  3.

‡ Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, and post -ovulation methods),  withdrawal 
(coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.  Female condom and male condom should not be 
used together.  
6.3. Premature Withdrawal from the Study  
A patient  has the right  to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  
The investigator and/or sponsor have the right to withdraw a patient from the study if it is no longer 
in the interest of the patient to continue in the study, or if the pat ient’s continuation in the study 
places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a patient does not or cannot follow study 
procedures).  An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal o f patients should be avoided.  
Patient s who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete study 
assessments, as described in Section  8.1.4 . 
Rules for discontinuation of study treatment (permanent or temporary) are discussed in 
Section  7.3.[ADDRESS_79759] is supplied for this study in the following concentrations:  
• Fasinumab 2 mg/mL: Each 1 mL single use pre -filled syringe delivers 0.5 mL of a 
2 mg/mL solution (1 mg do se) of study drug

Naproxen 500  mg or naproxen -matching placebo will be administered prn.  A proton pump 
inhibitor or other gastric protective medication may be prescribed if deemed medically necessary 
by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator or sub -investigator.  
7.2. Rescue Treatment(s)  
During the Year 1 and Year 2 treatment periods, acetaminophen/paracetamol will be the only 
study -provided rescue medication.  In the event that pain relief for OA pain is inadequate, or in 
the event o f other pain (eg, headache) or fever, 1 to 2 tablets/capsules of 
acetaminophen/paracetamol may be taken no less than [ADDRESS_79762] of care.  The maximum daily dose during the treatment and follow -up periods is 2500  mg 
(500 mg x 5 tablets/capsules) in countries where 500  mg strength tablets/capsules are available, or 
2600  mg (325  mg x 8 tablets/capsules) in countries where 325  mg strength tablets/capsules are 
available (eg, North America).  Where 500  mg strength tablet s/capsules are available, the highest 
individual single dose is 1 gram. Where 325 mg tablets/capsules are available, the highest 
individual single dose is 650  mg.  
In order to prevent severe liver damage, patients should be cautioned to avoid consumption o f 
alcoholic beverages while on acetaminophen/paracetamol. Patients should also be cautioned not 
to take rescue medication at intervals of fewer than 4 hours and to take no more than the maximum 
allowable single dose (1 to 2 tablets/capsules) or maximum all owable total daily dose.  
Acetaminophen/paracetamol must not be taken within 24 hours prior to scheduled study visits 
during the Year 1 and Year 2 treatment periods in order to minimize the confounding effects of 
rescue medication on efficacy assessments. Use of acetaminophen/paracetamol as study -provided 
rescue medication during the Year 1 and Year 2 treatment periods will be reported daily by [CONTACT_73458] e -diaries. During the Year 1 and Year 2 treatment periods, the acetaminophen/paracetamol 
will be so urced by [CONTACT_73459]. Acetaminophen/paracetamol accountability will be conducted at each study visit, 
starting at the baseline visit and continuing through the end of the tr eatment period.   
During the 20 -week follow -up period, acetaminophen/paracetamol will not be provided by [CONTACT_73460].  If acetaminophen/paracetamol is used, dosing instructions will be the same 
as during the treatment period including the max imum allowed daily dose. Use of 
acetaminophen/paracetamol will be captured as a concomitant medication.  
7.3. Dose Modification and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules  
7.3.1.  Dose Modification  
Dose modification for an individual patient  is not allowed.  
7.3.2.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Study drug may be temporarily or permanently discontinued due to medical need, as determined 
by [CONTACT_73461][INVESTIGATOR_004] ( Section  5.1.8 ).  
                                        VV-RIM-00122598-1.0 Approved - 26 Aug 2020 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  Patient s who permanently discontinue from study drug will be encouraged to remain in the study 
and to complete all study procedures and assessments including completion of the diary, the only 
exceptio n being not receiving study drug (oral and SC) .  Patients must continue to adhere to the 
prohibited medication list as per Section  7.7.1 .  Patients who agree and thus do not withdraw from 
the study will be asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits per Table  1. 
Patient s who permane ntly discontinue from study drug and who opt to withdraw from the study 
will be asked to complete early termination study assessments, per Table  1. 
Patients who discontinue from study drug prior to study completion due to an AA (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) should return to the clinic for all remaining stud y visits per the visit schedule.  
In the event that a patient must undergo JR surgery during the treatment or follow -up periods, 
he/she will be discontinued from study drug and asked to return to the study site for a pre -operative 
visit and for follow -up safety evaluations (as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) 4 and 20  weeks after 
surgery.  Pre -operative imaging (X -ray and MRI) will be obtained and submitted to the 
independent adjudication committee for review to ensure that an AA event is not in occurrence.  
Instructions for the submission process are provided in the study manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
As of [ADDRESS_79763] 2020, study drug dosing was to be permanently stopped in the event of any of 
the following : 
• A patient who is currently enrolled under an earlier version of this protocol must be 
immediately discontinued from study drug, undergo all end of treatment visit 
assessments, and move directly into the 20 -week safety follow -up period under this 
version of the protocol, if they meet any of t he following conditions that were excluded 
after re -evaluating the safety profile of NSAIDs:  
− They have a known medical history (at any time) of peripheral vascular disease, 
transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, 
unstabl e angina, or documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; or  
− They have a known GFR <30 mL/minute/1.73m2 or, 
− They are currently taking combination therapy of a diuretic with either an ACE 
inhibitor or ARB  (Note: Patients may remain in the study if the y are willing and 
able to change their antihypertensive regimen such that they are no longer on a 
combination of a diuretic with either an angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)  
• A patient who was randomized unde r an earlier version of the protocol to 3  mg Q4W 
or 6 mg Q8W fasinumab  
• A patient developi[INVESTIGATOR_73407] a neurologist’s examination and graded by [CONTACT_73462]-RIM-00122598-1.0 Approved - 26 Aug 2020 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_79764] moderate per ipheral neuropathy  limiting activities of daily living (ADL),  ie, grade 
≥2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.4; 
study sites should use CTCAE v.4 criteria throughout the study for consistency  
• Evidence of pregnancy  
• A pati ent developi[INVESTIGATOR_73408]  
• Continued non -compliance with protocol -defined maximum  acetaminophen/ 
paracetamol use (with a maximum daily dose of 2500  mg [countries where 500  mg 
strength tablets / c apsules are available] or 2600  mg [ countries where 325  mg strength 
tablets / capsules are available]) during the treatment and follow -up periods, after 
appropriate counseling  
• Continued non -compliance with the protocol, including usage of NSAIDs that are n ot 
permitted in the study, after appropriate counseling  
• Joint replacement surgery  
• AESIs of:  
− Adjudicated arthropathy, as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
− Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction , as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  
• Hepatotox icity.  Study drug should be discontinued if the following are observed:  
− Total bilirubin (TBL) >2x ULN or international normalized ratio (INR) >1.5, and  
− ALT or AST >3x  ULN, and  
− No other cause for [ADDRESS_79765], and TB L elevations may include alcoholic hepatitis, autoimmune 
hepatitis, non -alcoholic hepatitis, heritable diseases (Gilbert's Syndrome), heart failure, and viral 
hepatitis.  
NOTE:  Study drug may be withheld in patients who do not meet criteria for permanently  
discontinuing study drug, until an alternative cause for drug -induced liver injury can be 
determined.  The patient may be re -challenged if an alternative cause for elevated liver function 
tests is found and the liver function tests return to baseline, but  only after discussion with the 
sponsor.

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].  Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug may be temporarily discontinued due to medical need, as determined by [CONTACT_1275].  Subcutaneous study drug (fasinumab or fasinumab -matching placebo) will be 
temporarily  withheld while awaiting imaging adjudication for worsening joint pain or when 
routine imaging suggests adjudicated arthropathy and prompts the need for additional imaging (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), or for patients who are determined to have orthostatic hypotension or determined 
to have new or worsening symptoms suggestive of sympathetic nervous system dysfunction while 
awaiting evaluation by a specialist  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Patients may continue to take naproxen 
or naproxen -matching placebo during this time.  Subcutaneous study drug (fasinumab or  
fasinumab -matching placebo) should not be re -started until the next study visit unless 
imaging/evaluation results are available within the current visit window.  If oral study drug is 
temporarily discontinued by [CONTACT_093], patients may continue to take SC study drug during 
this time.  
7.4. Management of Acute Reactions  
7.4.1.  Systemic Injection Reactions  
Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of systemic reactions must be available 
for immediate use for injections performed at the study site.  All  injection reactions must be 
reported as AEs (as defined in Section  9.3.1 ) and graded using the grading scales as instructed in 
Section  9.5.[ADDRESS_79766] be reported as AEs and graded according to Section  9.5.1 . 
7.5. Method of Treatment Assignment  
At the baseline visit of Year 1, patients will be randomized in a 3:3:3:1 ratio to receive fasinumab 
(1 mg SC Q4W, 1 mg SC Q8W), naproxen, or placebo according to a central randomization 
scheme provided by [CONTACT_73463] (IVRS) / interactive web response system 
(IWRS) to the designated study pharmacist (or qualified designee). Randomization will be 
stratified according to the affected index joint (hip or knee), the K -L score (2 to 3 or 4) at the 
screening visit, and geographical region.  
Prior to Amendment 5 global, patients were randomized 3:3:3:3:1 to receive fasinumab 
(1 mg Q4W, 3  mg Q4W, 6  mg Q8W), naproxen, or placebo.  
Patients participating in Year [ADDRESS_79767] ion 7.1.  No 
re-randomization will occur at the time of entry into Year 2.

regular contact [CONTACT_73464].  
Blinded study drug kits coded with a drug numbering system will be used.  In order to maintain 
the blind, lists linking these codes with product lot numbers will not be accessible to individu als 
involved in study conduct.  
Anti-drug antibody results will not be communicated to the sites before the end of the study, and 
the sponsor operational team will not have access to results associated with patient identification 
until after the final datab ase lock.  
No study personnel involved in the day -to-day conduct of the study will have access to unblinded 
data before the database is locked for this study.  
7.5.2.  Emergency Unblinding  
Unblinding of treatment assignment for a patient  may be necessary due to a me dical emergency 
or any other significant medical event (eg,  pregnancy).  
If unblinding  is required:  
• Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment  
• Only the affected patient will be unblinded  
• The designated study pharmacis t(s)/designee at the study site will provide the treatment 
assignment to the investigator.  If there is no study pharmacist, the investigator for the 
site will unblind the patient  
• The investigator will notify Regeneron and/or designee as soon as possible after 
unblinding the patient  
Treatment assignment is not to be provided to site personnel, other than the unblinded study 
pharmacist (when applicable), at any time during the conduct of the study, except in the case of a 
true emergency.  In the event that there is no study pharmacist, the individual at the site fulfilling 
that role will be the only unblinded member of the site personnel.  
7.5.3.  Unblinding for Regulatory Reporting Purposes  
Treatment assignments for certain patients may be unblinded to Pharmacovigil ance and Risk 
Management personnel for the purpose of regulatory reporting of suspected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs).  
7.6. Treatment Logistics and Accountability  
7.6.1.  Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
A drug numbering system will be used to label blinded  study drug.  Lists linking drug numbers 
with product lot numbers will be maintained by [CONTACT_25006] (or companies) responsible for study

CONFIDENTIAL  8.1.1.  Footnotes for the Schedule of Events Table  1 (Year 1)  
1. Patients who discontinue study drug before week 52 will be encouraged to follow the visit schedule  
through the remainder of the study.  If a patient chooses to end study participation, he/she will be 
asked to return to the clinic as soon as possible for an early termination visit. Imaging assessments 
need to be repeated if it has been >[ADDRESS_79776] imaged. If it has been ≤30 days 
since imaging assessments were completed, imaging assessments may be completed at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
2. HIV and/or hepatitis testing will be performed on a country -by-country basis, according  to local 
guidelines if required by [CONTACT_25035]  
3. Only for patients who provide written informed consent for the optional genomics sub -study.  The 
sample should be collected at the day 1 (baseline/randomization) visit, but may be collected at any 
visit during the study after a patient has been randomized.  
4. At the screening and pre -randomization visits, study staff will review the “Participating in a 
Research Study: What You Need to Know” brochure and the “Reporting Your Pain” brochu re with 
patients to ensure they understand what a clinical study is and how to report their pain accurately. 
At subsequent visits, patients will be asked to review the “Reporting Your Pain” brochure 
themselves.  At any time during the conduct of the study,  patients may require retraining by [CONTACT_38992].  
5. Subcutaneous study drug administration will be the last procedure at each dosing visit and will be 
administered after all laboratory, PK, ADA and research samples have been collected and all study 
related activities have been performed. Patients will be observed in the clinic for approximately 1 
hour after SC study drug is administered.  
6. Use of study -provided rescue medication will be recorded daily in patient diaries.  
Acetaminophen/paracetamol use will be reported from pre -randomization visit to week  52. 
7. Patients will complete the WOMAC pain subscale for both hips and knees at the screening visit.  
Then, the WOMAC Full Survey will be completed only for the index joint at the subsequent visits.  
8. Walking index  joint pain NRS score will be recorded by [CONTACT_73467], 
starting during the pre -randomization period through week 52. Walking index joint pain NRS score 
will be recorded by [CONTACT_73468] [ADDRESS_79777] be receiv ed before a patient can be randomized.  
12. An MRI will be performed on the index and contralateral joints at screening for all patients.  In

with worsening or exacerbation of pain beyond the fluctuations in pain typi[INVESTIGATOR_73411]’s 
OA. This imaging will be submitted to the adjudication committee for review.  
14. In the event that a patient m ust undergo JR surgery during the study, the patient must complete the 
pre-operative study visit (early termination assessments, as applicable) and the procedures outlined 
in the schedule of events for JR follow -up (Table  3).  This will include a Knee Society Score 
questionnaire for knee replacements or Harris Hip Score questionnaire for hip replacements.  The 
pre-operative visit must be completed before  the JR surgery. Pre -operative images will be 
submitted to the adjudication committee for review.  
15. Samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_73469].  
16. Assessment o f follicle -stimulating hormone ( FSH) and estradiol l evels are only to be performed if 
assessment of postmenopausal status is required (ie, for female patients ≤59  years of age).  
17. In the event of a positive urine pregnancy test result, the patient should have a serum pregnancy 
test with a negative result in o rder to continue study drug.  If the serum pregnancy test is positive, 
the patient should be withdrawn from study drug and should be asked to return to the clinic for all 
remaining study visits per the visit schedule (see  Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
18. Collection of samples for PK, ADA, high sensitivity C -reactive protein (hs-CRP) and research are 
mandatory at the time points specified above.  In addition, PK, ADA, hs -CRP and research samples 
may be drawn at any scheduled visit or unscheduled visit if a patient experiences a treatment -related 
safety TEAE.  Samples should be  collected prior to SC study drug administration on SC study drug 
dosing days.  
19. Research samples should be collected after an overnight (minimum 8 hours) fast.  
20. Only for patients who provide written informed consent for the optional genomics sub -study.  The  
sample should be collected at the baseline visit but may be collected at any subsequent visit during 
the study.

23. Patient -reported outcome measures should be completed first at a study visit, prior to any clin ical 
assessments and procedures (eg, blood draws, ECGs, study drug administration).  
24. Patients who end treatment early but agree to follow/continue to attend regular study visits do not 
complete the assessments associated with EOT/week 52 at the time they end treatment.  Instead, 
they complete assessments associated with the study visit they are attending a t the time they end 
treatment early.

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].  Medical History  
The investigator or designee will take a complete medical history that includes information on 
concurrent medical conditions and the severity for each condition that has not resolved.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Medication History  
The investigator or designee will record information on a patient’s medication history, includ ing 
any history of intolerance to naproxen . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Demographics  
A patient’s demographic characteristics will be recorded, including age, height, weight, gender, 
race, and ethnicity.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Determination of Osteoarthritis  
Diagnosis of OA of the knee or hip will be based on the American College of Rheumatology 
criteria with radiologic evidence of OA (K-L score ≥2)  
In addition, diagnosis of OA of the hip and knee will use the following criteria:  
Hip 
The American College of Rheumatology clinical and radiographic criteria for  the diagnosis of OA 
of the hip ( Altman  1991 ) should be used to confirm a diagnosis of OA of the hip, as applicable, at 
screening.  The criteria consist of the following combinations:  
• Hip pain, and  
• At least 2 of the following  3 features:  
− Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) <20 mm/hour  
− Radiographic femoral or acetabular osteophytes  
− Radiographic joint space narrowing (superior, axial, and/or medial)  
Additional information is provided in the study ref erence manual.  
Knee  
The American College of Rheumatology clinical and radiographic criteria for the diagnosis of OA 
of the knee ( Altman  1986 ) should be used to confirm a diagnosis of OA of the knee,  as applicable, 
at screening.  The criteria consist of the following combinations:  
• Knee pain  
• Osteophytes on radiograph  
• At least 1 of the following 3 features : 
− Age >50 years

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of Childbearing Potential  
Each female patient should be evaluated for childbearing potential.  
Women will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal, or have 
had a tubal ligation, a bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], or complete hysterectomy.  
For women ≥[ADDRESS_79785] 12 continuous months of 
spontaneous amenorrhea.  In women ≤[ADDRESS_79786] 
12 continuous months of spontaneous amenorrhea, with serum FSH levels >40  IU/L 
(>40  mIU/mL) and serum estradiol levels <5 ng/dL (<184 pm ol/L)  (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of Peripheral or Central Pain  
Patients will complete a self -reported survey to evaluate the peripheral versus ce ntral nature of 
their pain at time points indicated in Section  8.1. 
A copy of the survey is provided in the study reference manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Instructions fo r Use of Diary  
At the pre -randomization and baseline visits, patients will be instructed on the use of the NRS for 
scoring their walking index joint pain. Patients will be trained on the use of the diary to report their 
walking index joint pain NRS score a nd their daily acetaminophen/paracetamol use for OA and 
other non -OA-related reasons. Retraining should occur as needed throughout the conduct of the 
study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Patient Education Brochures  
At the screening and pre -randomization visits, study staff will review the “Participating in a 
Research Study: What You Need to Know” brochure and the “Reporting Your Pain” brochure 
with patients to ensure they understand what a clinical study is and how to report their pain 
accurately. At subsequent visits, patients will be asked to review the ‘Reporting Your Pain’ 
brochure themselves.  At any time during the conduct of the study, patients may require retraining 
by [CONTACT_464].  
8.2.2.  Efficacy Procedures  
All the measures in this section are patient -reported outcome measures and sho uld be completed 
before any clinical assessments.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index  
The WOMAC index is used to assess patients with OA of the hip or knee using 24  parameters, and 
reported using a numerical rating scale.  This index can be used to monitor the course of a disease 
or to determine effectiveness of study drugs.  Patients will complete the WOMAC Full Survey at 
the time points indicated in  Table  1 and Table  2.  If possible, the assessment should be 
administered and entered by [CONTACT_73472].  
A copy of WOMAC assessments will be provided in the study reference manual.

The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status developed by [CONTACT_73474] a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal.  The EQ-5D-5L, 
as a measure of healt h-related quality of life, defines health in terms of 5 dimensions: mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  
Each dimension has 5 ordinal levels of severity: “no problems” (1), “slight problems” (2), 
“moderate proble ms” (3), “severe problems” (4), and “unable to” (5). Overall health state is 
defined as a 5 -digit number. Health states defined by [CONTACT_941] 5 -dimensional classification can be 
converted into corresponding index scores that quantify health status, which ranges f rom <0 for 
states worse than dead to 1 (full health), anchoring dead at 0.  Patients will complete the

AE. 
Evaluation of severity of la boratory abnormalities will be assessed according to the scale outlined 
in Section  9.5.1 . 
9.4.6.  Follow -up 
Adverse  event information will be collected unti l the patient’s last study visit.  
Serious adverse event information will be collected until the event is considered chronic and/or 
stable.  
9.5. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
9.5.1.  Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
• Mild:  Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient normal functioning 
level.  It may be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief 
of symptoms, but may be given because of personality of the pati ent. 
• Moderate:   Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health.  
It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  Treatment for symptom may be needed.  
• Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a 
defin ite hazard to the subject ’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given and/or 
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indicates.  
Injection Site React ions 
The severity of injection site reactions will be graded according to the following scale (semi -colon 
indicates “or” within description of grade:  
• Mild :  Pain that does not interfere with activity; mild discomfort to touch; <5 cm of 
erythema or indurati on that does not interfere with activity.  
• Moderate :  Pain that requires repeated use of non -narcotic pain reliever >24 hours or 
interferes with activity; discomfort with movement; 5.1 cm to 10 cm erythema or 
induration or induration that interferes with ac tivity.  
• Severe :  Pain that requires any use of narcotic pain reliever or that prevents daily 
activity; significant discomfort at rest; >10 cm erythema or induration; prevents daily 
activity; requires ER visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; necrosis or exfoliative der matitis.

9.6. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study pa tient at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion.  The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites.  The medical monitor will have primary responsibility for 
the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by [CONTACT_25047] 
(eg, Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management; Biostatistics and Data Management).  Safet y 
monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a 
periodic cumulative aggregate basis.  
                                        VV-RIM-00122598-1.0 Approved - 26 Aug 2020 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_79803]  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adjudicated Arthropathy  
Adjudicated arthropathy is an umbrella term that encompasses the following conditions:  
• Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_73405] 1 and 2  
• Subchondral insufficiency fractures  
• Primary osteonecrosis  
In addition, AAs will be evaluated to determine if they meet the criteria for destructive arthropathy.  
Potential events of AA will be monitored via clinical signs and symptoms of worsening joint pain 
during the course of the study (eg, by [CONTACT_73487], the joint pain questionnaire 
and imaging) as well as scheduled imaging and pre -operative imaging, if a patient requires a joint 
replacement during the study.  
Clinically significant worsening of joint pain during the course of this study is characterized as a 
worsening of pain in any joint that occurs in spi[INVESTIGATOR_73423], is in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_73424], and is at least 2 weeks duration 
(or less than 2 weeks if deemed clinically significant at the discretion of the investigator).  
If a patient reports an increase in pain as described above, study d rug administration will be 
withheld while imaging of the affected joint , as well as any additional imaging deemed appropriate 
to understand the cause of the worsening pain, is performed ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  A decision to 
perform imaging after patient reporting of worsening joint pain will be documented in the 
respective case report form (CRF) page.  Images, along with any other radiographic evaluation,  
will be submitted to the adjudication committee for review ( Section  5.3.2 ).  The investigator may 
consider aspi[INVESTIGATOR_73425].  
If routine imaging suggests the presence of one of the types of AA, study drug administration will 
be withheld.  Any additional imaging deemed appropriate will be obtained.  The images, along 
with results of any other radiographic evaluation, will be submitted to the Adjudication Committee 
for review ( Section  5.3.2 ). 
If the adjudication does not confir m the presence of AA, according to the adjudication criteria, 
study drug may be restarted.  
Study drug dosing will be terminated for patients with findings that suggest AA, and the patients 
will be referred for orthopedic consultation .  If presence of AA is  confirmed by [CONTACT_73488], the case must be reported as an AESI (Section  9.3.3  and Section  9.4.3 ).  
Any patient whose study drug is discontinued due to an AA should be encouraged to return to the 
clinic for all remaining study visits.   Prior to the scheduled JR, the patient should complete the 
pre-operative study visit (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) and, after the JR, should complete the wee k [ADDRESS_79804] -operative study visits ( Table  3).  Pre -operative images, along with any other 
radiographic evaluation will be submitted to the Adju dication Committee for review 
(Section  5.3.2 ). 
Details of data collection for adjudication of events will be provided in the adjudication charter.

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].  Sympathetic Nervous System Dysfunction  
Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction will be monitored throughout the study through physical 
examination, AE reporting, assessment of orthostatic hypotension, and the Survey of Autonomic 
Symptoms ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  New onset or worsening of signs and symptoms of autonomic 
dysfunction will be evaluated by [CONTACT_093].  Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction  will 
only be diagnosed after consultation with an appropriate specialist, such as a neurologist and/or 
cardiologist.  
In cases where new or worsening symptoms consistent with sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction are moderate to severe or are clinically s ignificant and do not resolve or return to 
baseline in 2  weeks (or less at the discretion of the investigator), study drug will be withheld and 
the patient will be referred to a specialist.  If the evaluation by [CONTACT_73489], study drug may be restarted.  If the specialist’s 
evaluation does reveal sympathetic nervous system dysfunction then study drug will be 
permanently discontinued and the case reported as an AESI ( Section  9.4.3 ). 
Orthostatic hypotension may be a manifestation of sympathetic nervous system dysfunction.  If a 
patient is determined to have orthostatic hypotension, st udy drug should be withheld and the AE 
should be entered in the electronic CRF (eCRF.).  The following procedures should be followed:  
• If the patient is symptomatic and a clinical explanation for orthostatic hypotension is 
identified (such as a new medicati on or dehydration due to exercise or illness or 
excessive heat exposure), study drug will be withheld, and the patient should return to 
the study site for an unscheduled visit in 1 to 10 days for an unscheduled assessment 
of orthostatic hypotension.  
− If the  orthostatic hypotension has resolved, study drug may be restarted.  
− If the orthostatic hypotension has not resolved, then study drug will be withheld, 
and the patient will be referred to a specialist (neurologist or a cardiologist) for 
evaluation of sympat hetic nervous system dysfunction.  
− If the specialist’s evaluation does not reveal new onset sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction, including symptoms of bradycardia (lightheadedness), orthostatic 
hypotension (lightheadedness on standing), syncope, absence of sweating in 
conditions where sweating would be expected, or if the specialist’s evaluation 
identifies an alternative cause, such as initiation of a new medication known to 
cause orthostasis, then study drug may be given at the next visit.  
− If the special ist’s evaluation does reveal sympathetic nervous system dysfunction, 
then study drug will be permanently discontinued and the case reported as an AESI 
(Section  9.4.3 ). 
• If the patient has asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension, study drug will be withheld, 
and the patient should return to the study site for an unscheduled visit in 1 to 10 days 
for an unscheduled assessment of orthostatic hypotension.  
− If the unscheduled assessment does not reveal orthostatic hypotension then study 
drug may be continued.

CONFIDENTIAL  − If the unscheduled assessment demonstrates orthostatic hypotension then study 
drug will continue to be withheld until the patient has been evaluated by a s pecialist 
(neurologist or a cardiologist) for evidence of sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction.  
− If the specialist’s evaluation does not reveal new sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction including symptoms of bradycardia (lightheadedness), orthostatic 
hypotension (lightheadedness on standing), syncope, absence of sweating in 
conditions where sweating would be expected, or if the specialist’s evaluation 
identifies an alternative cause such as initiation of a new medication known to cause 
orthostasis, then s tudy drug may be restarted.  
− If the specialist’s evaluation does reveal sympathetic nervous system dysfunction 
then study drug will be permanently discontinued and the case reported as an AESI 
(Section  9.4.3 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Peripheral Sensory Adverse Events  
Altered peripheral sensation (eg, paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia) is an important identified risk 
with fasinumab (see Investigator’s Brochure) and other anti -NGF  compounds.  Any peripheral 
sensory AE that, per the investigator’s judgment, requires a neurology or other specialty 
consultation must be reported as an AESI.  If any peripheral sensory event persists for [ADDRESS_79805] be 
reported as an AESI (Section  9.4.3 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Joint Replacement Surgery  
An end of study phone conta ct will be conducted at [ADDRESS_79806] undergone or are scheduled for JR surgery as 
described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . Any elective JR surgery planned before completion of the ICF would 
be part of the exclusion criteria and would not be considered an AE.  
After signing of the ICF, report JR surgery as an AESI if the JR surgery is an  elective event that is 
not associated with a new/worsening AE.  
Do not report JR surgery as an AE/AESI if the JR surgery is for the treatment of a new or worsening 
AE. In this case, the new or worsening AE should be the reported AE/AESI term.  
9.7. Investigator Alert Notification  
Regeneron (or designee) will inform all investigators participating in this clinical trial, as well as 
in any other clinical trial using the same investigational drug, of any SAE that meets the relevant 
requirements for expedited reporti ng (an AE that is serious, unexpected based on the Investigator’s 
Brochure or this protocol, and has a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the 
medicinal/study drug).  
10. STATISTICAL PLAN   
This section provides the basis for the statistical analysis pla n (SAP) for the study.  The SAP may 
be revised during the study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make 
                                        VV-RIM-00122598-1.0 Approved - 26 Aug 2020 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_79807] the planned 
analyses.  The final SAP will  be issued before the database is locked.  
Analysis variables are listed in Section  1. 
10.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
There are 29 hypotheses for the primary  and key secondary endpoints.  The primary treatment 
comparison for the WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores is declared superior only 
if the comparisons are significant for both WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores.  
The graphical testing procedure ( Bretz  2009 ) will be applied to control for multiplicity and to 
maintain study -wise Type I error rate at two -sided 0.05 level for the two sets of hypotheses (H 1,i, 
i=1,…,16 for fas inumab 1 mg Q4W, and H 2,i, i=1,…,13 for fasinumab 1  mg Q8W) for the primary 
and key secondary endpoints.  If a hypothesis is rejected, the alpha level for that hypothesis will 
be reallocated to other hypothesis according to a pre -specified procedure.  The testing will stop 
when no hypothesis can be rejected at any step.  Details will be provided a priori in the SAP.

10.2. Justification of FAS and mFAS Sample Sizes  
In this study , approximately 2560 patients were to be randomized to fasinumab 1  mg SC Q4W 
(840), fasinumab 1 mg SC Q8W (600), naproxen (840), or placebo (280) (see Section  5.1.3 ).  This 
sample size was expected to provide adequate power for the comparisons between fasinumab and 
naproxen at week 16 for the WOMAC pain and physical function scores and the PGA score and 
provide long term data for safety assessment.

CONFIDENTIAL  The sample size for the full analysis set (FAS) population was based on results of the WOMAC 
pain and physical function subscale scores and the PGA from the R475 -PN-1227 study.  The 
calculation of sample size assumed a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.025 and a 15% dropout rate up to 
week 16 and a 30% dropout rate up to week  52.  Enrollment of [ADDRESS_79809] 99% power to 
detect an effect size of 0.46 in the WOMAC pain and  physical function subscale scores (ie, an 
absolute treatment difference of 1.[ADDRESS_79810] deviation [SD] 
of 2.4 at week 16 and 52 for the FAS).  This sample size would have provided 99% power to detect 
an effect size of 0 .36 in PGA for an absolute treatment difference of 0.4 with an SD of 1.1  at week 
16, and 98% power at week [ADDRESS_79811] acebo group who were enrolled after amendment 5 global 
was implemented.  For such comparisons, 2 -sided alpha level of 0.025 and a 15% dropout rate up 
to week 16 and a 30% dropout rate up to week [ADDRESS_79812] size for 
such compa risons was assumed to be 80% of the effect size for the comparison between fasinumab 
1 mg Q4W group and the placebo group. Under these assumptions, enrollment of 600 patients in 
the fasinumab 1 mg Q8W group and 200 patients from the placebo group would hav e provided 
97% power to detect an effect size of 0.368 (=0.46*80%) in the WOMAC pain and physical 
function subscale scores at week 16 and 93% power at week 52.  This sample size would have 
provided 84% power to detect an effect size of 0.288 (=0.36*80%) in  PGA at week 16, and 75% 
power at week 52 for the FAS.  
The sample size calculation was also based on previously reported results of the WOMAC pain 
subscale and physical function subscale and the PGA for naproxen (Ekman  2014 ) 
(Schnitzer  2015 ).  Assuming a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.025 and a 15% dropout  rate up to week  16 
and a 30% dropout rate up to week  52, an enrollment of [ADDRESS_79813] 97% power to detect an effect size of 
0.22 in the WOMAC pain subscale (ie, an absolute treatment difference of 0.51 with an SD of 2.3) 
at week 16, and 92% power at week [ADDRESS_79814] provided 98% 
power to detect an effec t size of 0.24 in WOMAC physical function subscale (ie, absolute 
treatment difference of 0.50 with an SD of 2.1) at week 16, and 96% power at week [ADDRESS_79815] provided 87% power to detect an effect size of 0.18 in PGA at week 
16 between fasinumab 1 mg Q4W and naproxen for the FAS.  
Due to regional irregularities noted in a parallel phase 3 study that became fully apparent only after 
unblinding that study, and the concern that the same irregularities would be present in data from  
similar sites in this study, the population for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses was 
changed in Protocol Amendment 8 to be based on a modified full analysis set (mFAS) that excludes 
the randomization stratum for that region.  Based on the assum ptions above, it is estimated that 
this mFAS will provide:  
• 99.9% power to detect a significant difference between the 1 mg Q4W group and the 
placebo group in the WOMAC pain and physical function subscales at an alpha level 
of 0.05

10.3. Analysis Sets  
In accordance with guidance from the International Conference of Harmonization of Technical 
Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH)  guideline ICH E9 
Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials (ICH, 1998), the following populations of analysis will be 
used for all statistical analysis:  
10.3.1.  Full Analysis Set  
The FAS includes all randomized patients excluding patients affected by [CONTACT_73490] 2018 (ie, patients randomized to the 3 mg Q4W or 6 mg Q8W doses) and is based on the 
treatment allocated (as randomized).  Efficacy and patient reported outcome endpoints for Year 1 
will be analyzed using the FAS including patients r andomized to fasinumab 1 mg Q4W, fasinumab 
1 mg Q8W, naproxen and placebo.  For the analyses of fasinumab 1 mg Q8W group comparing to 
the control groups, only patients concurrently randomized (ie, after Protocol R475 -OA-1611 
Amendment 5 Global was implemen ted) will be included.  
10.3.2.  Modified Full Analysis Set  
Due to regional irregularities noted in a parallel phase 3 study that became fully apparent only after 
unblinding that study, and the concern that the same irregularities would be present in data from 
similar sites from the same region in this study, the primary and secondary efficacy analyses will 
be performed on an mFAS.  This  mFAS is comprised of the FAS excluding patients from the 
region of concern (Rest of the World stratum).  Efficacy and patient -reported outcome endpoints 
will be analyzed using the mFAS including patients randomized to fasinumab 1 mg Q4W, 
fasinumab 1  mg Q8W, naproxen, and placebo.  For the analysis of fasinumab 1 mg Q8W group 
comparing to the control groups, only the subset of patien ts concurrently randomized (ie, after 
Protocol R475 -OA-1611 Amendment 5 Global was implemented) will be included.   
10.3.3.  Per-Protocol Set (PPS)  
The per protocol set (PPS) includes all randomized patients from the mFAS who received all 
protocol -required doses du ring the [ADDRESS_79816] of protocol v iolations 
which lead to exclusion from the PPS and corresponding protocol deviation identification number 
(PDID) will be included in the SAP.  For the analysis of fasinumab 1 mg Q8W group comparing 
to the control groups, only patients concurrently randomiz ed (ie, after Protocol R475 -OA-1611 
Amendment 5 Global was implemented) will be included .

naproxen, and placebo.  
The Year 2 safety analysis set (SAF  - Year 2 ) includes all patients who received at least 1 dose of 
the Year 2 study dru g; it is based on the treatment received during Year 2 (as treated).  Treatment 
compliance/administration and all clinical safety variables for Year 2 will be analyzed using this 
SAF – Year 2.  
10.3.5.  Urgent Safety Measure Set  
The urgent safety measure set (USMS) will include all patients randomized to fasinumab 3 mg 
Q4W or 6 mg Q8W and is based on the treatment allocated (as randomized).  The USMS will be 
utilized for all analyses of data collected from its included patients.

discontinuation  
10.4.2.  Demography and Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline demographic, disease characteristics including medical history , and exposure to study 
drug will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_73491].  Continuous 
variables will be summarized with mean, median, SD, minimum, and maximum.  For categorical 
or ordinal data, frequencies and percentages will be displayed for each category.  
Details of the statistical methods will be provided in the  SAP.  
10.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy variables will be analyzed using  multiple imputation approach with a 
mixed -effect model for repeated measure (MMRM) based on the mFAS with adjustment for 
missing data due to lack of eff icacy, death or AEs assuming the WOMAC scores would on average 
return to baseline values. A m onotone missing data structure will be achieved using the MCMC 
option of PROC MI. Data collected after discontinuing treatment up to week 16 will not be used 
in th e primary efficacy analysis, but used in a treatment policy sensitivity analysis.  Multiple 
imputation for the remaining data will be based on the monotone missing data structure of the 
change from baseline scores using the regression imputation option in PROC MI.  The missing 
data for patients who discontinued treatment due to other reasons will be imputed under missing -
at-random assumption.  The imputed data for patients discontinued from the study treatment due 
to lack of efficacy, death or AEs will be c entered at the mean baseline value.   
Missing data will be imputed 50 times to generate 50 complete data sets. Each imputed data set 
will be analyzed using the MMRM with terms for baseline score corresponding to the efficacy 
variable being analyzed, random ization strata (K -L category [2 to 3, or 4], index joint [knee, hip], 
and geographical region [North America, Europe]), treatment, visit, and treatment -by-visit 
interaction.  The MMRM will be performed using the MIXED procedure in Statistical Analysis 
System (SAS) with an unstructured covariance matrix to model the within -patient errors. 
Denominator degrees of freedom will be estimated using Kenward -Roger’s approximation. The 
results from the 50  analyses will be combined using Rubin’s formulae (PROC MIANALY ZE). 
The least -squares mean estimates for the mean change from baseline to week 16, as well as the 
differences of the estimates between fasinumab and placebo, and between fasinumab and 
naproxen, with their corresponding standard errors, p  values and associ ated 95% confidence 
intervals, will be provided.

CONFIDENTIAL  Sensitivity analysis of the treatment policy estimand for the co -primary endpoints will be 
performed using similar analysis method as the primary efficacy analysis including data collected 
after discontinui ng treatment up to week 16.  Sensitivity analysis using a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_73426] -at-random (MNAR). After each imputation, a fasinumab pat ient's imputed 
data will subtract  from the imputed score at each corresponding time point.  By [CONTACT_73492] , the sensitivity analysis will explore the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300], ie, the δ value when the p -value 
for a treatment comparison is above 0.05.  Additional analyses will be performed for the primary 
and secondary endpoints using the FAS.  Additional sensitivity anal ysis will be performed for the 
primary and select secondary endpoints using the PPS.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
For analysis of continuous secondary endpoints at fixed timepoints (ie, week 16 and week 44), the 
analysis method will be the same as that use d for the primary variables. For the analysis of 
secondary endpoints involving the averaging over several visits (see endpoints 12 to 15 in 
Section  4.2.2 ), analysis will be performed using a multiple imputation approach with an ANCOVA 
model based on the mFAS with adjustment for missing data performed in the same manner as was 
done for the primary endpoint.  For analysis of categorical variables in secon dary endpoints, eg, 
proportions of patients with ≥30% improvement in the WOMAC pain subscale scores at week 16, 
the Cochran Mantel Haenszel approach will be used based on the mFAS, stratifiying by [CONTACT_64118] (K -L category [2 to 3, or 4], inde x joint [knee, hip], and geographical region 
[North America, Europe]).  Missing data will be considered as non -response.

approve:  
• The protocol, ICF, and any other materials to be provided to the patients 
(eg, advertising) before any patient  may be enrolled in the study  
• Any amendment or modification to the study protocol or ICF before implementation, 
unless the change is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to the patient s, in 
which case the IRB or EC should be informed as soon as possible  
• Ongoing studies on an annu al basis or at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk  
In addition, the IRB or EC should be informed of any event likely to affect the safety of patient s 
or the continued conduct of the clinical study.  
A copy of the IRB - or EC -approval letter with a c urrent list of the IRB or EC members and their 
functions must be received by [CONTACT_25069].  
The approval letter should include the study number and title, the documents reviewed, and the 
date of the rev iew. 
Records of the IRB or EC review and approval of all study documents (including approval of

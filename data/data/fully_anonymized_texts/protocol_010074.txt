SECTION I: RESEARCH PLAN
1.Statement of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested. 
 Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with abnormalities in the peripheral immune system(1-6), 
but the role of the neuroimmune system is not clear. In the healthy immune system, the response of the central 
nervous system to an insult or damage is mediated by [CONTACT_894516], which carry out repair 
functions. However, excessive activation can lead to neuronal dysfunction and damage through the release of 
inflammatory cytokines and other mediators, and may contribute to the neuro-degeneration found in 
individuals with PTSD(7-11). When microglia are activated, there is a robust increase in the expression of 
translocator protein (TSPO)(12). Positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers such as [11C]PBR28, which 
bind to TSPO, can therefore be used to measure levels of or increases in activated microglia in vivo.  We have 
exciting preliminary PET data demonstrating that individuals with PTSD have higher levels of TSPO compared to 
controls throughout the brain. This suggests that we can measure neuroinflammation in individuals with PTSD 
with [11C]PBR28 and PET brain imaging (Aim 1). 
In addition, we have developed a paradigm that allows us to probe the function of the neuroimmune 
system – a neuroinflammation “stress test.” This is done by [CONTACT_894517] (LPS; also known as Clinical Center Reference Endotoxin(CCRE), Escherichia coli endotoxin or 
simply endotoxin), a potent immune activator. By [CONTACT_746] a [11C]PBR28 PET scan before and after 
administration of LPS, we have recently demonstrated robust increases in brain microglial activation, as well as 
increases in peripheral inflammatory cytokines (i.e., blood-based markers of inflammation) and associated mood 
and anxiety symptoms in healthy human adults(13). We also have new preliminary data demonstrating that a 
greater LPS-induced neuroinflammatory response is associated with specific and robust declines in 
neurocognitive function. We propose to use this novel paradigm to probe the function of the neuroimmune 
system in individuals with PTSD. We hypothesize that, compared to controls, individuals with PTSD have a 
dysfunctional neuroimmune system, with higher baseline levels of activated microglia (Aim 1), an exacerbated 
and prolonged neuroinflammatory response to a pharmacological stressor (LPS), which contributes to increased 
mood, anxiety, and neurocognitive dysfunction (Aims 2 and 3); and, that neuroinflammation mediates the 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/20/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/20/2022Page 2 of 45relationship between peripheral inflammation and PTSD related symptomatology (Aim 4). Results of the 
proposed study have the potential to identify a novel and treatable(14, 15) neuroimmune mechanism implicated 
in PTSD.
In Aim 1, we will determine whether individuals with PTSD have higher levels of activated microglia 
compared to trauma-exposed control subjects as measured with [11C]PBR28 PET brain imaging. Eighty subjects 
(n=40 with a primary diagnosis of PTSD; n=40 trauma-exposed controls) will participate in a [11C]PBR28 PET scan 
to assess baseline levels of activated microglia. We will perform clinical assessments and measure cytokine 
levels, mood, anxiety and neurocognitive function on PET scan day. Based on our preliminary data, we 
hypothesize that individuals with PTSD will have higher levels of neuroinflammation compared to trauma-
exposed healthy controls, particularly in the amygdala, hippocampus, ventral striatum and frontal cortex, and 
that higher levels of neuroinflammation will be associated with greater severity of mood and anxiety symptoms 
and neurocognitive dysfunction. 
In Aim 2, we will use our novel neuroinflammation “stress test” to determine whether individuals 
with PTSD vs. trauma-exposed controls have a dysfunctional neuroinflammatory response to systemic 
administration of LPS. The same subjects from Aim 1 will be administered LPS 3 h prior to a second [11C]PBR28 
PET scan on the same day, consistent with our established paradigm(13). Cytokine and cortisol levels, mood and 
anxiety symptoms, and neurocognitive function will be assessed pre- and post-LPS administration. We 
hypothesize based on preclinical studies(16) that, compared to controls, individuals with PTSD will have an 
exacerbated neuroimmune response to LPS evidenced by [CONTACT_894518]. We further 
expect that greater LPS-induced increases in activated microglia will be associated with greater increases in 
cortisol levels, mood and anxiety symptoms, and reductions in neurocognitive function.
In Aim 3, we will determine the role of activated microglia in mediating the relationship between 
peripheral inflammatory markers (e.g., TNF-α) and PTSD-related symptomatology to discover potential 
biomarkers of PTSD. It is not known whether peripheral inflammation indicates neuroinflammation. However, 
peripheral cytokines cross the blood-brain barrier and induce both neuroinflammation and psychological 
distress(18-20). We will evaluate whether both baseline and LPS-induced levels of activated microglia mediate 
the relation between peripheral inflammatory markers, and mood and anxiety symptoms and neurocognitive 
function in individuals presenting with the full dimensional spectrum of PTSD symptoms. Based on prior 
work(19) and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that (a) higher baseline levels of activated microglia will 
mediate the relation between higher levels of peripheral inflammatory markers (particularly TNF-α and IL-8(13)), 
and more severe mood and anxiety symptoms, and neurocognitive dysfunction; and (b) that greater LPS-induced 
levels of activated microglia will mediate the relation between greater LPS-induced peripheral inflammatory 
markers and increased mood and anxiety symptoms, and neurocognitive dysfunction. 
In Aim 4, we will image the relationship between neuronal and arterial inflammation in PTSD. A) In 
order to define the relationship between neuronal and arterial inflammation we will recruit 40 subjects with 
PTSD and 40 trauma-exposed controls to participate in one whole body [18F]FDG scan. Performing a “whole 
body” scan, i.e., brain to torso, allows us to measure brain and arterial inflammation in the same scan. B) These 
subjects will also have the option of participating in a whole body [11C]PBR28 scan (on the same or different 
day). While currently FDG is the established method of measuring and quantifying arterial inflammation(21), 
there are many caveats. PBR28 has been established as the current gold standard for measuring brain 
inflammation – but has not been explored for arterial inflammation. Thus, as we are conducting our studies 
using FDG we wish to use PBR28 in the same subjects to determine whether PBR28 may be a more specific 
marker of both brain and arterial inflammation. We hypothesize that individuals with PTSD will have greater 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/20/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/20/2022Page 3 of 45amygdala activity than trauma-exposed controls and it will be related to levels of arterial inflammation as 
measured with FDG.  
In Aim 5, we will determine whether individuals with PTSD vs. trauma-exposed controls exhibit a 
dysfunctional neuroimmune recovery from LPS-induced neuroinflammation (i.e. return to basal levels). The 
same subjects from Aims 1 & [ADDRESS_1253445] the opportunity (optional; not required for study participation) to 
participate in additional [11C]PBR28 scans on days following the systemic LPS challenge in Aim 2. Subjects will 
have the option to participate in no more than 2 additional [11C]PBR28 scans within one month following LPS 
administration. Cytokine and cortisol levels, mood and anxiety symptoms, and neurocognitive function will also 
be assessed on subsequent [11C]PBR28 scan days. Our preclinical data indicate that healthy non-human primates 
recovered (i.e. TSPO levels returned to ‘basal’ pre-LPS levels) within 14 days following LPS administration (17). 
However, building on Aim 2, we hypothesize that, compared to controls, individuals with PTSD will exhibit a 
slower neuroimmune recovery (i.e., TSPO levels will return to basal levels more slowly than controls) following 
LPS, evidenced by [CONTACT_894519] [ADDRESS_1253446]: State the expected duration of the project, including all follow-up and data 
analysis activities.  
10 years.  Aims 1-3 and 5 will take approximately 5-6 years, including data analysis and publication. Aim 4 is 
currently in the preliminary stages and will require several additional years. 
3.Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide references to 
support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
Background and Significance. Nearly 9 in 10 Americans will be exposed to trauma in their lifetimes and a 
significant percentage (10.1%)(22) will develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is characterized by 
[CONTACT_894520] (e.g., intrusions, avoidance, anxious arousal), loss (e.g., anhedonia, negative affect) and 
neurocognitive (e.g., verbal learning, processing speed, attention) symptoms(10, 23-31). In addition, individuals 
with PTSD have elevated rates of physical health morbidities(32, 33), as well as functional impairment(27, 34-
36), with loss symptoms in particular contributing to a significantly decreased quality of life(28, 35-37). The 
immune system is responsible for maintaining health, which includes mounting a response to physical (e.g., 
virus, injury) and psychological (e.g., stress) insults(38-41), as well as modulating the progression of 
neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease(42, 43). All of these—physical health conditions, 
psychological distress, and neurodegenerative disorders—are more prevalent in individuals with than without 
PTSD(9, 27, 33). While the peripheral immune system may play a role(4, 44, 45), the role of the neuroimmune 
system in PTSD has not been evaluated. We hypothesize that individuals with PTSD have a dysfunctional 
neuroimmune system that is chronically activated and thus over-reactive to immune challenges, which may 
contribute to the chronicity of symptoms. Understanding the role the neuroimmune system plays in PTSD may 
help identify biomarkers or “proxies” of a dysfunctional neuroimmune response, which can inform etiology and 
treatment of this disorder. For example, pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_894491], 
such as the endocannabinoid(46) or cholinergic system(47), may be evaluated for their efficacy in treating PTSD 
and related symptoms. 
The Neuroimmune System Modulates PTSD-Related Psychopathology. While markers of peripheral 
inflammation have long been associated with a variety of psychiatric disorders, including PTSD, major 
depression, and addiction(1-6, 48, 49), the role that neuroinflammation plays is unclear. Microglia, the 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/20/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/20/2022Page [ADDRESS_1253447] neurons(50). For example, when provided with 
signals that indicate the presence of tissue damage or pathogens, microglia become activated and carry out 
repair functions. However, excessive activation may lead to the release of substances that cause neuronal 
dysfunction and death, such as inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, 
and glutamate(51-54). The degree of activation depends in part on the type of molecular signal: 
administration of LPS leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β)(52), which can enter 
the brain and induce microglial activation, while exposure to anti-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., by 
[CONTACT_43203]-inflammatory medication, induces a neuroprotective phenotype in microglia(55, 56). 
Therefore, activation of microglia by [CONTACT_23131]-inflammatory signals, such as those that are increased peripherally 
in PTSD (e.g., IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, CRP)(1-6) may lead to chronic levels of neuroinflammation. To the 
best of our knowledge, in humans, levels of activated microglia in individuals with PTSD have not been 
measured - with PET, or postmortem. 
As described above, neuroinflammation can be measured using PET radiotracers that bind to TSPO, which is 
found on activated microglia in the brain. In particular, PET has been used to document higher levels of 
activated microglia—interpreted as neuroinflammation—compared to controls in individuals with 
Alzheimer’s disease(57) and other neurodegenerative disorders(16, 58). A recent study by [CONTACT_894521].(18) found that, relative to controls, individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) had significantly 
higher levels of activated microglia in the insula (33% higher), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; 32% higher), 
and prefrontal cortex (26% higher); further, higher levels of activated microglia in the ACC were linked to 
greater severity of depressive symptoms (r=0.63, p=0.005). Our group previously reported no difference in 
neuroinflammation levels in individuals with milder MDD vs. controls(59); however, a reanalysis of these 
data found higher levels of activated microglia in those individuals with the most severe depression 
symptoms (see Preliminary Data section C.1.c), which is consistent with Setiawan and colleagues’ findings. 
Interestingly, higher levels of activated microglia have not been observed in individuals with 
schizophrenia(60) or cocaine dependence(61), suggesting that neuroinflammation may be more specific to 
individuals with severe mood symptoms and cognitive dysfunction, both of which are common in individuals 
with PTSD(30, 35, 62). In Aim 1, we will determine whether individuals with PTSD have higher levels of 
activated microglia than trauma-exposed controls, and ascertain possible links between levels of activated 
microglia, mood and anxiety symptoms, and neurocognitive function. Thus, this study has the potential to 
provide compelling evidence for a role of the neuroimmune system in the etiology and manifestation of 
PTSD-related psychopathology.
Trauma-related Psychopathology is Dimensional in Nature. PTSD-related psychopathology is often considered 
to be relatively homogeneous in nature and characterized by [CONTACT_894522]; however, factor 
analytic studies have revealed that PTSD-related psychopathology is characterized by [CONTACT_894523](62-69) and are differentially linked to neurobiological systems(70-
76). While exposure to trauma is associated with increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_138384], MDD, and generalized 
anxiety disorder (GAD)(66, 77, 78), these disorders are highly comorbid and share common underlying 
dimensions of threat and loss symptoms(24, 25, 28, 62, 64, 66, 79, 80). Threat symptoms include intrusive/re-
experiencing symptoms such as intrusive memories and nightmares about a traumatic event; avoidance of 
trauma-related reminders; and anxious arousal symptoms, e.g., hypervigilance. Loss symptoms include 
emotional numbing (e.g., diminished interest in activities, restricted range of affect), as well as negative affect, 
anhedonia, and dysphoric arousal (e.g., sleep and concentration difficulties)(28, 62, 64, 66, 80-82). The 
phenotypic expression of threat and loss symptoms is thus best conceptualized as dimensional in nature, 
spanning the full spectrum of symptom severity ranging from no symptoms to severe symptoms(66, 83-85).

number(86, 87) and in morphology(87). Another model of 
psychological stress – inescapable shock (IS) - also led to 
neuroinflammation(88), and the drug minocycline, which 
inhibits microglial activation, reduced the shock-induced 
neuroinflammatory response(89). Most importantly, 
there is evidence that psychological stress (i.e., 
inescapable shock) can activate microglia, which then 
sensitizes the pro-inflammatory reactivity of microglia to 
subsequent immune challenges(16). There is cross-
sensitization between stress and peripheral pro-
inflammatory cytokine responses(90), and exposure to a 
stressor can sensitize LPS-induced cytokine 
production(91).  One study in particular helps form the basis for our hypothesis for Aim 2. Frank and 
colleagues(16) found that inescapable shock robustly increased activated microglia and potentiated the pro-
inflammatory response to LPS in the hippocampus; Figure 1). In other words, stress primed the microglia 
and they became hyper-reactive to subsequent immune challenges. In Figure 1, black bars show the 
increase in IL-1beta gene expression—a protein found on activated microglia—in the hippocampus, and 
white bars show the media control. HCC are the home cage controls that received no shock and do have a 
robust neuroimmune response to LPS like healthy humans in our study(13). We hypothesize that individuals 
with PTSD have a much larger response to LPS, which is analogous to the group that received inescapable 
shock (IS) [ADDRESS_1253449] an 
exacerbated neuroinflammatory response to an LPS challenge compared to controls. Our overall hypothesis 
is that chronic stress leads to chronically higher levels of neuroinflammation (Aim 1), which primes the 
system to respond excessively to an immune challenge (Aim 2). 
Potential Mechanism. The precise mechanism by [CONTACT_894524]-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal 
(HPA) axis plays a critical role. It is well documented that stress (emotional, psychological, physical) can induce 
an inflammatory response(92, 93). And, it is well known that cytokines – which are released during an 
inflammatory response - activate the HPA axis, by [CONTACT_894525], i.e., cortisol and 
catecholamines(94, 95). For example, administration of Salmonella abortus equi endotoxin(96) and LPS(97) lead 
to increases in peripheral cytokines and cortisol, with subsequent increases in anxiety, poor mood, and memory 
deficits. This suggests that inflammatory induced increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines and cortisol may 
activate the HPA axis and lead to symptoms that increase threat, loss, and cognitive dysfunction. There is also 
evidence that repeated vs. single immune stimulation (such as with LPS) may amplify the increase in the HPA 
axis(98), which is consistent with the finding that stress can sensitize the pro-inflammatory reactivity of 
microglia to subsequent immune challenges(16) and our hypothesis for Aim 2. Thus, a chronically activated HPA 
response could lead to persistent anxiety, poor mood, and impaired cognitive function and thus contribute to 
the pathophysiology of PTSD.

inflammatory response to LPS ex vivo. Hippocampal microglia were

to HCC (N=5/group). HCC LPS vs. IS LPS. *p<0.05

microglia in psychiatric disorders are scarce(99); however, it is becoming increasingly clear that the brain-
cytokine system may have a key role in driving physiological and pathological behavior in psychiatric 
disorders(19). From our recent study(13), we know that LPS 
administration in humans leads to robust microglial activation which 
occurs in concert with particular behavioral changes—an increase in 
mood symptoms(13) and a decline in neurocognitive function. We also 
have preliminary data suggesting that LPS-induced changes in activated 
microglia play a role in mediating the relationship between peripheral 
inflammation and behavior (see Preliminary Data). Taken together, these 
studies suggest that systemic inflammation and activated microglia are 
associated with increased mood dysregulation and neurocognitive 
dysfunction (see Figure 2). In Aim 3, we will determine relationships 
between the central and peripheral immune pathways, trauma-related 
threat and loss symptoms, and neurocognitive dysfunction. 
Preliminary studies
a) [11C]PBR28 PET imaging. [11C]PBR28 PET is used to measure levels of TSPO, which are expressed mainly on 
activated microglia. In our previous study(100), we confirmed that LPS-induced TSPO reactivity occurred mainly 
in microglia, rarely in astrocytes. The specific outcome measure used is volume of distribution (V T), which is a 
measure of levels of TSPO binding sites in a given region of interest. One caveat is that [11C]PBR28 binding is 
influenced by a single point mutation in the TSPO gene(101). This polymorphism results in high, medium and low 
binding in the brain and low binders do not have measurable TSPO availability with [11C]PBR28. Thus, blood 
samples are drawn for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_894492]. Because there is a ~2-fold 
difference in [11C]PBR28 V T at baseline between high and medium binders, this genotype is entered as a fixed 
factor in the analysis(102). In our hands, [11C]PBR28 has excellent test-retest variability (TRV of V T : 7-9% across 
gray matter regions(103)). 
b) Higher levels of activated microglia in individuals with PTSD compared to trauma-exposed controls. We 
used [11C]PBR28 and PET to evaluate levels of activated microglia in individuals with PTSD (n=6) compared to 
trauma-exposed controls (n=8). Five women and one man with PTSD (mean age=33.3, SD=9.3, range=21-48; 
index trauma: [ADDRESS_1253451] husband 
in accident; mean 24.3 years since trauma) 
were recruited. After adjustment for the 
rs6971 polymorphism on the TSPO gene, an 
ANOVA revealed that, relative to trauma 
controls (TC), the PTSD group had markedly 
higher global (21.5% higher) and regional 
(17.3% to 30.1% higher) [11C]PBR28 V T 
values (Figure 3). The magnitude of this 
difference was, by [CONTACT_559], large (Cohen 
d=1.02). In Aim 1, we will build on these 
preliminary findings by [CONTACT_894526] 2. Model of how peripheral inflammation 
and neuro-inflammation may contribute to PTSD-
related symptoms.

presenting with the full dimensional spectrum of PTSD symptoms.
c) Higher levels of activated microglia are associated with loss (i.e., anhedonic) symptoms. We reanalyzed data 
from a previous study(59) to compare global activated microglial levels in 5 individuals presenting with 
moderate or greater severity of MDD symptoms (score >= 20 on the 
MADRS) to [ADDRESS_1253452] to age, sex, race, 
body mass index, and smoking status. Compared to controls, 
individuals with MDD had substantially higher (27.9%) global and 
regional (13.6% to 34.5%) [11C]PBR28 V T values. Composite 
[11C]PBR28 V T values correlated strongly with overall severity of 
depressive symptoms (r= 0.80; Figure 4). Dimensional analyses using 
a 3-factor model of MADRS-assessed MDD symptoms(68, 69) 
revealed that [11C]PBR28 V T values were independently associated 
with severity of anhedonia/loss (i.e., lassitude, inability to feel; r= 
0.82), but not psychic anxiety (i.e., pessimistic thoughts; r= 0.36) or 
vegetative symptoms (i.e., reduced sleep and appetite; r= 0.30). Thus, 
we hypothesize that higher levels of activated microglia will be 
strongly related to anhedonic/loss symptoms.
d) Higher levels of activated microglia are associated with 
neurocognitive dysfunction. Preliminary data (n=23) were analyzed to evaluate the relation between global 
[11C]PBR28 V T values and performance on a comprehensive neurocognitive test battery developed by [CONTACT_311636] 
(www.cogstate.com), which assesses processing speed, visual attention, verbal and visual learning and memory, 
visual working memory, and spatial problem-solving(104, 105). On average, this sample was 29.7 years old 
(SD=7.3, range=19-44), predominantly male (65.2%), ethnically diverse (43.5% African American, 30.4% 
Caucasian, 21.7% Hispanic, 4.3% Hispanic), and comprised of n=13 [56.5%] healthy controls, n=7 [30.4%] 
individuals with alcohol dependence and 3 [13.1%] with PTSD. Partial correlations adjusted for the rs6971 
polymorphism on the TSPO gene and psychiatric disorder revealed that higher global [11C]PBR28 V T values were 
associated with significantly worse performance on measures of learning and memory (r= -0.47, p=0.021), and 
working memory (r= -0.39, p=0.034). These results suggest that higher levels of activated microglia are 
associated with decrements in learning and memory, as well as working memory. In Aim 1, we will build on 
these preliminary results to determine how baseline levels of activated microglia contribute to neurocognitive 
dysfunction in PTSD.

response produced by [CONTACT_894528] E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS; also called endotoxin) in 8 
healthy men (mean age=25, SD=5.5) using [11C]PBR28 and PET(13). In addition, peripheral cytokine levels and 
depression-related symptoms were assessed before and after LPS administration. Each subject had two 
[11C]PBR28 PET scans in one day, one before and one 3 h after an LPS (1.0 ng/kg, IV) challenge. LPS 
administration significantly increased [11C]PBR28 V T by 30-60%, demonstrating robust microglial activation 
throughout the brain (Figures 5 and 6). Notably, the increase occurred in all 8 subjects. This increase was 
accompanied by [CONTACT_894529], vital sign changes, mood symptoms(13) and a 
significant reduction in learning and memory performance (r= -0.60, p=0.032). These data provide the first 
demonstration in humans that a systemic LPS challenge induces robust increases in microglial activation in the 
brain, with concomitant increases in peripheral inflammation, and anhedonic and neurocognitive symptoms. In 
Aim 2, we will use this established and robust paradigm to evaluate the role of LPS-induced increases in levels of 
activated microglia in the etiology of PTSD symptomatology.
4.Research Plan: Summarize the study design and research procedures using non-technical language that can 
be readily understood by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care 
vs. research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of visits specifying their individual 
times and lengths. Describe the setting in which the research will take place.
Aim 1, we will recruit 40 trauma-exposed individuals and 40 individuals with PTSD to participate in one 
[11C]PBR28 PET scan and one structural MRI scan, which is necessary for PET data analysis. Measures of PTSD 
and related symptoms, measures of threat and loss symptoms, and neurocognitive function will be assessed 
before PET scan. 
Aim 2, the same subjects from Aim 1 will undergo a second [11C]PBR28 PET scan on the same day, 3 hours 
after LPS administration (1.0 ng/kg, IV). This will allow us to measure LPS-induced changes in microglial 
activation. The order of the scans is not randomized because it is preferable to obtain both carbon-11 scans 
(20-min half-life) on the same day to reduce variability; and, because LPS likely has a relatively long-lasting 
effect on microglial activation/TSPO availability, it cannot be given prior to the first scan without affecting a 
second scan on the same day. Measures of PTSD and related symptoms, measures of threat and loss 
symptoms, and neurocognitive function will be assessed before and after LPS administration on scan days 
(timing of tests is detailed below) to determine whether inducing a systemic immune response dynamically 
affects these measures differentially between individuals with PTSD vs. trauma-exposed controls.
Aim 3, blood samples will be obtained on all subjects participating in Aims 1,2, and 5 before and after LPS

subjects with PTSD and 40 trauma-exposed controls to participate in one whole body [18F]FDG scan. 
Performing a “whole body” scan, i.e., brain to torso, allows us to measure brain and vascular/arterial 
inflammation in the same scan. B) These subjects will also have the option of participating in a whole body 
[11C]PBR28 scan (on the same or different day).  
Aim 5, the same subjects from Aims 1 & [ADDRESS_1253453] and fourth 
[11C]PBR28 PET scan on subsequent days following LPS administration (these additional scans are optional 
and are not required for study participation). These additional scans will allow us to measure the 
approximate time course of neuroimmune recovery following LPS challenge in control and PTSD subjects. 
Subjects will complete both scans within one month following LPS administration. Measures of PTSD and 
related symptoms, measures of threat and loss symptoms, and neurocognitive function will be assessed 
immediately prior to each PET scan.
 All subjects participating in PET scans will also have an MRI, which is necessary to rule out any brain 
abnormalities and for use in the PET image analysis.  The MRI scan for an individual subject may be omitted 
if the required anatomical MRI scan for this subject is on file as part of participation in an approved Yale 
Protocol and was performed within approximately [ADDRESS_1253454] Selection, Assessment and Recruitment: All research subjects will be recruited in accordance with the 
guidelines of the Yale University Institutional Review Board (Human Investigation Committee). Subjects (n=160) 
will be recruited from the community via IRB-approved advertising (newspaper, radio, internet posting, 
television, flyers) and by [CONTACT_894530]. Over the past [ADDRESS_1253455] 
successfully recruited individuals with psychiatric disorders, including PTSD(106), major depression(107), bipolar 
depression(108), alcohol dependence(109), and schizophrenia(110, 111), as well as healthy control subjects 
from the community for neuroimaging studies. After completing informed consent, subjects will undergo a 
physical and neurological examination, and an electrocardiogram (EKG). Laboratory tests will be performed to 
exclude subjects with medical complications and will include a complete blood count (CBC) and differential, 
chemistries, kidney function tests, liver function tests, and thyroid stimulating hormone tests. Subjects will be 
excluded for major medical, neurological or psychiatric illness (except PTSD and MDD, see below for details), 
abnormal laboratory tests, or contraindication to radiotracer or MRI. A urine drug screen and pregnancy test will 
be performed at screening and prior to both the PET and MRI imaging session, and subjects who screen positive 
will be excluded (except for cannabis). Trained, experienced research assistants under the direct supervision of 
Drs. Cosgrove and Esterlis (both are licensed clinical psychologists) will initially evaluate subjects and administer 
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) to ascertain psychiatric status, and the CAPS-5 to assess 
severity of PTSD symptoms and determine eligibility for participation. Physical and neurological examinations 
including a detailed history will be performed or overseen by a study physician who will review all of the clinical 
information, including laboratory results, and in collaboration with Drs. Cosgrove and Esterlis, will determine 
eligibility of study subjects.

PET scans will be performed at the Yale University PET Center. An antecubital venous catheter will be used for IV 
administration of the radiotracer and for venous blood sampling. A radial artery catheter will be inserted by [CONTACT_894531] (an experienced physician or a highly skilled APRN trained to complete this 
procedure)in the morning before the PBR28 PET scan (FDG does not require arterial sampling). The site will be 
anesthetized with lidocaine prior to arterial line insertion. The arterial line will remain in place for the whole day 
of scanning, after which it will be removed. The IV catheter will also remain in place for the duration of the scan 
day. For Aims 1,[ADDRESS_1253456] using either an HRRT (207 slices, resolution 
better than 3 mm FWHM in 3D acquisition mode), HR+ PET scanner, or a Siemens mCT PET scanner (resolution 
better than 5 mm FWHM). A transmission scan, or low dose CT scan, will be obtained for each emission scan. Up 
to a total of [ADDRESS_1253457] scans may be completed for the entire study. A transmission scan is obtained before 
each emission scan. On the HRRT PET scanner, motion correction will be performed dynamically with 
measurements from the Vicra (NDI Systems, Waterloo, Ontario) using a dedicated list-mode reconstruction 
algorithm 74. A dynamic PET scan of up to 2 hours duration will be acquired after IV bolus or bolus plus infusion 
of up to 18mCi of [11C]PBR28. For Aim 4, subjects will be administered up to  10 mCi of FDG and may also be 
administered up to 20mCi of [11C]PBR28 to be scanned on the Siemens mCT PET/CT scanner (this is the whole 
body scanner) which includes CT attenuation scans. For the FDG PET scans, subjects are asked to follow a low 
carbohydrate diet for [ADDRESS_1253458] overnight the night before.  For FDG scans, FDG will 
be administered (up to 10 mCI, IV), and subjects rest for up to [ADDRESS_1253459] phase of the scan 
(5-10 min), the arterial input functions are measured with an automated blood counting system (PBS-101, 
Veenstra Instruments, Joure, The Netherlands) using a continuous withdrawal system where the radioactivity in 
whole blood is measured with a calibrated radioactivity monitor. Subsequently, individual blood samples 
(venous and / or arterial) are taken at various time points and counted in a gamma counter. Samples are 
centrifuged to obtain plasma, which will be counted, and selected samples will be assayed for the presence of 
the parent radiotracer compound that has not been metabolized. These measurements will be performed by 
[CONTACT_5004]. In addition, the fraction of plasma radioactivity unbound to protein will also be determined. 
Endotoxin administration 
Subjects will receive intravenous administration of open-label endotoxin at a dose 0.8 - 1ng/kg body weight. This 
will take place at the Yale PET Center. All subjects will fast for at least [ADDRESS_1253460] 3 days prior to each study day. Clinical Center Reference 
Endotoxin (CCRE) will be produced by [CONTACT_894532]. 
CCRE is an investigational drug, and investigator Kelly Cosgrove has obtained an Investigational New Drug (IND) 
for its use in humans from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). CCRE vials will be stored at 2-8°C in a 
refrigerator in the locked YNHH IDS pharmacy. Preparation of CCRE will be performed by [CONTACT_894533]. As recommended by [CONTACT_4289], the pharmacist will dissolve the lyophilized CCRE in Sterile Water for 
Injection USP under a laminar flow hood on the evening before each endotoxin administration. The dissolved 
CCRE will be stored at 4°C until the following morning. 
Dissolved CCRE is stable for at least [ADDRESS_1253461] on a stretcher in the PET Center. A urine drug screen

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/20/2022Page [ADDRESS_1253462] for women. An IV catheter will be placed to allow 
for hydration with normal saline, endotoxin infusion, and blood draws. In the case of bradycardia or 
hypotension, this catheter will be used for rapid bolus infusion of normal saline (van Eijk, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_894495]. 2004). 
To reduce the already low risk of adverse cardiovascular events, subjects will be hydrated with 500 mL of saline 
prior to endotoxin administration, and they will receive approximately 100 mL/hr thereafter for the duration of 
the endotoxin administration day.
After endotoxin administration, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate and temperature) will be recorded every 
[ADDRESS_1253463] returned to within 10% of the 
baseline values. All subjects will be connected to continuous two-lead EKG monitoring for the duration of the 
challenge. All subjects will be carefully monitored at all times by a research nurse and by a study physician or 
APRN (APRNs are trained on the protocol and will have MD telephone back up), who will be present until [ADDRESS_1253464] experiencing prolonged effects of endotoxin or any other 
adverse event may be transferred to the Yale New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_894496]. 
There is no evidence that experimental endotoxin administration causes hypoxemia in humans and therefore 
there is no literature to support monitoring of this parameter (as opposed to parameters such as heart rate and 
blood pressure, which do change and thus, will be monitored closely). Furthermore, pulse oximetry can be 
unreliable when there is significant peripheral vasoconstriction, as occurs during e.g. experimental endotoxemia, 
sympathetic activation, and fever. 
If an individual experiences bothersome symptoms after endotoxin administration and wants to stop the study, 
flu-like symptoms may be treated with acetaminophen (650 mg every 6 hrs), or ibuprofen (400 mg every 6 hrs), 
and anxiety may be treated with lorazepam (0.5 mg every 2 hrs for a maximum dose of 6 mg every 24 hrs). 
During screening each subject will be asked about medication allergies, and no medication to which a subject 
may be allergic will be administered. If a subject requests so, the study will be stopped and these medications 
may be administered. In addition, if any of the following symptoms occurs, if of a severity such that it prevents 
normal activity, the study in that individual subject will be stopped: Chills, headache, malaise, myalgias, 
arthralgias, fatigue, nausea, vomiting. If a subject’s body temperature exceeds 39.2°C the study will be halted 
and the subject will receive ibuprofen or acetaminophen as described above. If these medications are 
insufficient to lower body temperature, subjects may be transferred to a higher level of care. Subjects will be 
discharged at the end of the study day, provided that all of the following have occurred: their blood pressure is 
within 10% of baseline AND their heart rate is within 20% of baseline AND their mental status is normal AND 
they do not feel physically or mentally unable to return home. The determination will be made by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or 
the study physician. 
Inflammatory cytokines

blood sample drawn for plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines (including but not limited to: IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-6, 
TNF alpha, IL-10, IL-12). In addition, plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines will be measured just prior to 
subsequent PET scans following LPS administration for Aim 5.
Specimen Storage
Specimens will be logged into a specimen tracking log and stored either at the PET Center or YCCI Biorepository. 
This log will include Study ID, date drawn, label of specimen (i.e. barcode, type of specimen etc), location, and 
date withdrawn for analysis or destruction.

PTSD, Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (112) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) 
(113) respectively and explore relationships between these measures and radiotracer binding in relevant brain 
regions.
General Assessments may include:
1). Socio-demographic/General Information: At intake, demographic data and medical history will be assessed 
with interviews and self-report forms that provide data on age, race, socioeconomic status, marital status, 
educational and occupational levels, and significant medical history.  These are adapted from previous 
diagnostic and clinical studies at this center.
2) The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V (SCID-5) will be used to provide current and past diagnoses of 
substance use and other psychiatric disorders. 
3) SCID II is an addendum to the SCID that is used to diagnose axis II disorders including Antisocial Personality 
Disorder.
4) Civilian M-PTSD is an assessment of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.
5.) Health Status is a self-report instrument that will be used to assess the lifetime occurrence of illnesses or 
conditions.
6.) Concomitant Medication Log will be used scan day to determine what medications have been taken in the 
last two weeks.
7.) Bower VAS and the endotoxin symptoms checklist will be administered to participants during the endotoxin 
challenge.
Medical Assessments
Any clinically significant abnormal medical screening laboratories from the initial assessment will be repeated 
prior to each imaging session.
1)  Physical exam by a state licensed physician or Advanced Practice Registered Nurse 
2)   Laboratory Blood Tests including a complete blood count with Diff, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, fasting 
blood sugar, electrolytes, liver function tests, thyroid function tests (including T3, T4, T3RU, estimated free T4), 
thyroid stimulating hormone levels and coagulation panel, and DNA genetics testing. For all laboratory screening 
blood and urine tests, one of the study physicians reviews the labs, and in combination with the results from the 
physical exam, decides if the subject is sufficiently healthy (so that it does not alter the scientific integrity of the 
study, or risk to the subject for study participation) to participate in the study. 
3) Urine toxicology screens may be performed at baseline, prior to PET imaging, and more frequently if the 
clinician or research staff become concerned about possible illicit drug use.  Patients will be instructed that 
random urine drug screens will be performed. Urine samples may be tested for amphetamines, barbiturates, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cannabinoids, cocaine, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_858].
4)  Pregnancy Tests female patients will have a blood pregnancy test at baseline and also a urine pregnancy test 
on the day of each PET scan and MRI scan.
Cognitive Measures
We may obtain these measures at baseline and up to two times on the PET days.
1. Cogstate Battery (30 minutes) – This computerized test battery will assess memory and cognition.  The tasks 
may include:

c. Detection Task – a computerized task to assess psychomotor function and speed of processing.
d. Identification Task – a computerized task to assess visual attention and vigilance.
e. One Card Learning Task – a computerized task to assess visual learning and memory.
f. One Back/Two Back Tasks –  computerized tasks to assess attention and working memory
Probabilistic Reward Task: The PRT has been successfully used to assess reward responsiveness (114-116). In 
each trial, subjects choose which of two difficult-to-differentiate stimuli was presented. Stimuli consist of simple 
cartoon faces (diameter: 25 mm; eyes: 7 mm) presented in the center of the monitor. At the beginning of the 
trial, the face has no mouth. After a given delay, either a straight mouth of 11.5 mm (“short mouth”) or 13 mm 
(“long mouth”) is presented for [ADDRESS_1253468] identification of one 
stimulus (“rich stimulus”) is rewarded three times more frequently (“Correct! You won 20 cents”) than the other 
(“lean”) stimulus. In healthy controls, this reinforcement schedule leads to a response bias (i.e., a preference for 
the more frequently rewarded stimulus). The degree of response bias toward the more frequently reinforced 
alternative will be used for operationalizing sensitivity to reward. This is called the “Face Game” in the consent.
Cold Pressor Task:  Subject may be asked to participate in the Cold Pressor Task. The cold pressor task (CPT) is a 
stress task used to measure pain sensitivity and pain tolerance. This task will be used to determine alterations in 
pain thresholds as a result of endotoxin administration. Participants will immerse their hand (up to the wrist) for 
up to 3 minutes in the experimental (ice-cold temperature 0-4°C)) and control (room temperature (20°C)) 
conditions. Physiological measure (heart rate, blood pressure and subject responses (stress, mood) will be 
collected 5 minutes before, 1 minute into, and immediately after the CPT.
Dot-Probe Task: The Dot-Probe Task is used to assess attentional biases to threatening and non-threatening 
information. In the task the subject is instructed to fixate on a cross in the center of the screen while two stimuli, 
one threatening and one non-threatening are displayed on either side of the screen. The stimuli are presented 
for a 500 ms and then disappear, and a dot is presented in the location where of one of the stimuli used to be. 
The subjects are instructed to indicate the location of the dot, left or right, as quickly as possible. The reaction 
time to the dot when it appears in the location where the threatening stimulus had been, is interpreted as an 
attentional bias and increased vigilance to threat. This measure can be correlated with clinical features and 
outcomes of PTSD and other anxiety disorders.
Image Analysis
Outcome Measure and Dependent Variables
For PBR28, the primary outcome measure is total volume of distribution (V T) which is proportional to in vivo 
TSPO levels. There is no brain region that does not exhibit specific binding of PBR28. Thus, for full quantification 
of V T, arterial sampling is required. We will examine the regions-of-interest (ROIs) listed below. For PBR28 we 
will use two-tissue compartmental analyses with a metabolite-corrected arterial input function to estimate total 
distribution volumes for each ROI (117).

resolution to identify brain regions.  The PET image sets are aligned and resliced to yield images in the same 
planes and spatial system as the MRI images using AAL template.  Primary ROIs will include the hypothalamus, 
thalamus, amygdala, striatum, and the cingulate and frontal cortices. Other ROIs will be examined post hoc to 
assess radiotracer binding. 
SPM Analysis
Statistical parametric mappi[INVESTIGATOR_55072] (SPM2, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience in the Institute 
of Neurology at University College London) implemented in Matlab 6.5 (Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA) will be 
used for voxel-based statistical analysis.  Each scan will be transformed into sterotactic space by [CONTACT_894534] a 
template image.  The images are then smoothed using a Gaussian kernel (8x8x8 FWHM).
For outcome measures for cardiac FDG, using the CT as guide, the ascending aorta, aortic arch and carotid 
arteries will be delineated.  For aorta, ROIs will be drawn every 3 mm around the artery along the aorta, starting 
1 cm distal to aortic valve (to avoid spi[INVESTIGATOR_894497]) and ending after the takeoff of the left subclavian 
artery. For carotid arteries, serial regions of interest will be drawn around each carotid, starting 2 cm below 
carotid artery bifurcation and extending 2 cm into internal carotid artery. The mean and maximum standardized 
uptake value [SUV, decay-corrected tissue concentration of [18]F-FDG (in Bq/mL) divided by [CONTACT_894535] (Bq/g)] on co-registered PET images will be determined for each ROI, and will be averaged 
along each artery. Background (blood) activity will be determined in 5 ROIs separated 3 mm apart drawn around 
superior vena cava (for aorta) and ipsilateral jugular vein (for carotid artery). Target to background ratio (TBR) 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_894536]. For each subject, the artery with the 
highest TBRmax will be selected as the index vessel for all analyses.
Sample Size Calculation 
Power calculations were conducted by a statistician and Co-I, [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_58628]. Preliminary data from 6 individuals 
with PTSD and 8 trauma-exposed controls revealed robustly higher [11C]PBR28 V T values globally (21.5% higher; 
d=1.02) and regionally (17.3-30.1% higher; d’s=0.83-1.15) in PTSD vs. controls.}} Assuming a two-sided analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA) with α=0.05, recruitment of 40 trauma-exposed controls and 40 individuals with PTSD 
(quartiles 3-4) will provide greater than 94.2% statistical power to detect effect sizes as small as d=0.80. This 
translates into minimum detectable differences between controls and individuals with PTSD of 15.0%. To 
examine relations between continuous measures of global and regional [11C]PBR28 V T values, and measures of 
post-traumatic threat and loss symptoms, and neurocognitive functioning, preliminary data from 5 individuals 
with moderate-or-greater severity of MDD symptoms revealed a strong association between global [11C]PBR28 
VT values and severity of loss/anhedonic symptoms (r=0.82). Further, preliminary data from 23 individuals 
revealed that global [11C]PBR28 V T values correlated significantly with measures of learning and memory (r= -
0.47) and working memory (r= -0.39). Thus, assuming a two-sided linear multiple regression model with α=0.01 
(0.05/5 dependent variables: dot probe and PRT scores, CAPS-5-assessed threat and loss symptoms, global 
cognition) and conservative overall model effect size (R2) of .25, and up to 10 predictors, an n of 80 will provide 
99.2% statistical power to detect this magnitude effect. Our previous study in [ADDRESS_1253470] 
LPS-induced increases in [11C]PBR28 V T values ranging in magnitude from 31% to 63%(13). We have preliminary 
data indicating an overall 8.8% difference (d=0.38)in global [11C]PBR28 V T values between 2 individuals with PTSD 
and 2 matched trauma-exposed controls. Thus, assuming a minimum 8.0% differential increase in LPS-induced 
[11C]PBR28 V T values in the PTSD group relative to trauma-exposed controls(16), α=0.05, correlation among 
repeated measures=0.50, and nonsphericity correction ε =1, recruitment of 40 individuals with PTSD and 40 
trauma-exposed controls will provide greater than 91.9% statistical power to detect this magnitude differential 
effect size.

experienced research assistants will perform these interviews, which will be done in a sensitive and gentle 
manner.
2. Risks associated with confidentiality. Although all information collected about each subject in this study 
will be protected by [CONTACT_894540]-protected computers, it is possible that 
information could be accessed by [CONTACT_894541]. Such illegitimate access could 
have deleterious consequences for the subjects with regards to employment, access to health insurance, and 
stigma. The protection of subject information is not absolute. It does not apply to any State requirement to report 
certain communicable diseases or to report cases of physical or sexual abuse. Such duty to report will be explained 
to each subject during the consent process and if reporting becomes necessary, we will inform the subject. We

3. Risks associated with blood drawing and with IV and radial catheter placement. Blood drawing and venous 
catheter insertion can be associated with mild pain, bruising, infection, or clot formation. These risks are 
minimized by [CONTACT_894542]. No more than a total of [ADDRESS_1253477] for the duration of the scans, after which it will be removed. Arterial sampling 
may be associated with mild-to-moderate pain or bruising at the puncture site. In rare instances, blocking of the 
artery, poor healing, hematoma, inflammation, or infection at the catheter insertion site may occur. Certain 
individuals may feel light-headed during arterial catheter placement.
4.  Risks associated with radiation. The Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57181] (Y-NHH RSC) 
and the Yale University  Radiation Safety Committee (YU-RSC) will review the use of radiation in this research 
study, and no subjects will be scanned until approval is obtained. This research study involves exposure to 
radiation from [18F]-FDG and [11C]PBR28 PET scanning and if the mCT camera is used, low dose whole body CT 
scanning. This radiation exposure is not necessary for medical care and is for research purposes only. 
The targeted amount of radiation an individual subject will receive from participating in Aim 1,2 and 5 of this 
study is from four injections of up to 18mCi of [11C]PBR28 PET, plus attenuation correction (i.e., transmission). 
Although each organ will receive a different dose, the maximum amount of radiation exposure subjects will 
receive if participating in Aims 1, 2 and 5 is an effective dose of 1.75 rem for a total of up to 72 mCi of 
[11C]PBR28 in four injections. If participating in just Aim 1, the effective dose would be 0.437 rem from one 
injection of up to 18mCi of [11C]PBR28 plus attenuation correction. If participating in just Aims 1 and 2, the 
effective dose would be .874 rem from two injections of up to 18mCi of [11C]PBR28 plus attenuation correction. 
Subjects will also receive radiation exposure from low dose head CT scans or transmission scans, depending 
upon which scanner is used. If scans are completed on the HRRT, subjects will receive up to 0.0056 rem from up 
to 4 transmission scans (0.0014 rem each) If scans are conducted on the mCT, each subject may receive an 
additional .18 rem (0.[ADDRESS_1253478] scans), this results in a maximum effective dose from 
four injections of [11C]PBR28 and [ADDRESS_1253479] will receive from participating in Aim 4 is from up to 
10mCi (1.234 rem) from one injection of [18F]-FDG , from up to 20 mci from one injection of [11C]PBR28 PET 
(0.486 rem), and up to [ADDRESS_1253480] scans (1.25 rem) per whole body PET scan. Whole body CT 
attenuation scans are necessary for motion correction; previous studies have shown that one before and after 
PET injection provides ideal data, should we find that one attenuation scan provides sufficient motion correction 
we will only do the one. Effective Dose for both FDG and PBR28 scans including attenuation will be 4.[ADDRESS_1253481] may repeat the scan as long as their dose limit remains below 
5 rem for the year. The amount of radiation that subjects will receive in this study is below the dose limit of 5 
rem per year occupational guideline followed by [CONTACT_894543].
5. Risks of MRI:  Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging carries a risk for subjects who are claustrophobic or have 
pacemakers, metal pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928], aneurysm clips, large colored tattoos, or any other contraindications for MR. MR is a 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/20/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/20/2022Page 19 of 45technique that uses magnetism and radio waves, not x-rays, to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_894502]. The [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set guidelines for magnet strength 
and exposure to radio waves, and we carefully observe those guidelines. Subjects will be watched closely 
throughout the MR study. Some people may feel uncomfortable or anxious. If this happens, the subject may ask to 
stop the study at any time and we will take them out of the MR scanner. On rare occasions, some people might 
feel dizzy, get an upset stomach, have a metallic taste or feel tingling sensations or muscle twitches. These 
sensations usually go away quickly but we will ask subjects to tell the research staff if they have them. There are 
some risks with an MR study for certain people. If subjects have a pacemaker or some metal objects inside their 
body, they may not be in this study because the strong magnets in the MR scanner might harm them.  Another risk 
is the possibility of metal objects being pulled into the magnet and hitting a subject. To reduce this risk we require 
that all people involved with the study remove all metal from their clothing and all metal objects from their 
pockets. We also ask all people involved with the study to walk through a detector designed to detect metal 
objects. It is important to know that no metal can be brought into the magnet room at any time. Also, once 
subjects are in the magnet, the door to the room will be closed so that no one from outside accidentally goes near 
the magnet. We want subjects to read and answer very carefully the questions on the MR Safety Questionnaire 
related to their personal safety. We will be sure that subjects have read the MR Safety Questionnaire and tell us 
any information they think might be important. This MR study is for research purposes only and is not in any way a 
clinical examination. The scans performed in this study are not designed to find abnormalities. The PI’s, the lab, 
the MR technologist, and the Magnetic Resonance Research Center are not qualified to interpret the MR scans 
and are not responsible for providing a diagnostic evaluation of the images. If a worrisome finding is seen on a 
subject’s scan, a radiologist or another physician will be asked to review the relevant images. Based on his or her 
recommendation (if any), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_324038], inform them of the finding, and 
recommend that they seek medical advice as a precautionary measure.  The decision for additional examination or 
treatment would lie solely with the subject and their physician. The investigators, the consulting physician, the 
Magnetic Resonance Research Center, and Yale University are not responsible for any examination or treatment 
that a subject receives based on these findings. The images collected in this study are not a clinical MR exam and 
for that reason, they will not be made available for diagnostic purposes.
6. Pregnancy and Breast Feeding: Since the acceptable levels of radioactivity are lower for pregnant 
individuals, women will be excluded from participating in this study if they are currently pregnant or might 
become pregnant during the study. They will be tested for pregnancy as part of the routine laboratory tests.  If the 
test is positive, they will not be included in the study. Before starting the study, we will ask women to avoid 
becoming pregnant and what precautions they plan to take. We ask women to tell us immediately if they change 
their minds about becoming pregnant. If the woman is currently breast-feeding, she will be excluded from the 
study. Women will be given one pregnancy test during the initial physical evaluation, and in addition on day of the 
MRI scan and PET scans, prior to radiotracer injection. 
7. Lipopolysaccharide Administration: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, also called endotoxin) is a large molecule 
found on the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria that has been widely used to evoke a robust immune 
response. We propose to use the same dose and protocol of LPS that we have successfully used in our recent 
study(13): 1.0 ng/kg, IV bolus. Specifically, on the day of the [11C]PBR28 PET scans, LPS (0.8-1.0 ng/kg, IV) will be 
administered 3 hours prior to the second PET scan. Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]) and sickness and psychiatric symptoms will be monitored before drug administration and 
every [ADDRESS_1253482] returned to within 10% of the 
baseline values.  Because of the risk of nausea and emesis, subjects are required to fast for the day of the study 
until after the scan. In our experience to date, no subjects have reported nausea that was significant enough to 
require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. If significant nausea or other adverse events occur, the study will be stopped.

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/20/2022Page 20 of 45If an individual experiences bothersome symptoms after LPS administration and wants to stop the study, flu-like 
symptoms may be treated with acetaminophen (650 mg every 6 hrs), or ibuprofen (400 mg every 6 hrs), and 
anxiety may be treated with lorazepam (0.5 mg every 2 hrs for a maximum dose of 6 mg every 24 hrs).  During 
screening each subject will be asked about medication allergies, and no medication to which a subject may be 
allergic will be administered. If a subject requests, the study will be stopped and these medications may be 
administered. If a subject’s body temperature exceeds 39.2°C the study will be halted and the subject will 
receive ibuprofen or acetaminophen as described above. If these medications are insufficient to lower body 
temperature, subjects may be transferred to a higher level of care. 
At the end of the PET scan day, subjects will be assessed (physical and vital signs) by [CONTACT_5989]. 
Subjects will be discharged when vital signs are within normal limits and when behavioral changes (if any) are 
found to be not clinically significant by [CONTACT_597623]. If subjects experience 
any adverse events, they will be treated until they become asymptomatic, prior to discharge. In the proposed 
study and in our ongoing studies, psychiatric patients who are administered a challenge drug may be admitted 
to an inpatient unit if psychiatric symptoms worsen or become dangerous on the PET scan day. Arrangements 
for a guaranteed bed will be made in advance of each PET scan day with the Clinical Neuroscience Research Unit 
(CNRU), located at the Community Mental Health Center (CMHC), which is 1 block from the Yale PET center. To 
date, no psychiatric patient has required admission. All subjects are followed for 1 week (in person the following 
day and by [CONTACT_894544]) following LPS administration or until potential symptoms (self-report and by 
[INVESTIGATOR_13699]) resolve.   
Background and potential side effects of LPS administration: LPS administration in human subjects is a generally 
safe experimental procedure that has been used in at least 2,200 subjects(119). Intravenous LPS administration 
at doses from 2 to 4 ng/kg causes flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, rigors, malaise, and increased heart 
rate(120-122). These effects peak at around [ADDRESS_1253483](119). This occurred in subjects who either had a history of vasovagal syncope and/or 
who participated in a protocol in which they were not adequately hydrated. In large cohorts of subjects who 
received adequate hydration, no such effects occurred(119). We have administered LPS (0.8-1.0 ng/kg) to >30 
subjects, including both healthy controls and individuals with psychiatric disorders, with no unexpected or 
serious adverse effects.  A small study(122) detected gender differences in peripheral cytokine levels after LPS 
administration, with females having a more pronounced response than males; 50% of our sample will be women 
so we will be able to explore sex differences. We have not noted particular behavioral differences (e.g., sickness 
behavior) between men and women receiving LPS to date. 
 A review of the literature published in 2007(123) describes all the studies wherein LPS was given to human 
subjects. All articles were reviewed for any potential adverse effects, morbidity or mortality; however, no long-
term morbidity or mortality was reported in these more than 1000 healthy volunteers. At a 5 ng/kg dose of EC-5, 
subjects experienced nausea, vomiting and fever. Consequently, doses of ≤ 4 ng/kg have been subsequently 
used. We are giving 1/4 of that dose. LPS given at 2 ng/mg is not associated with known long-term sequelae or 
serious adverse events in healthy populations. Subjects (up to 4 total) who did have side effects at doses as low 
as 2 ng/kg were found to have underlying medical issues. When side effects have occurred, they are remarkably 
similar. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], within 50-90 min following LPS, subjects describe flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, 
arthralgias, myalgias, headache, nausea, and often chills that resolve within 3-4 h. Fever, however, is the 
hallmark of LPS infusion. After a latent period up to 120 min, there is a monophasic increase in fever which 
peaks at 1-2°C above baseline. The fever may last up to 3-4 h (depending on dose) and resolves without residual 
effect.

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/20/2022Page 21 of 45This critical review of all the cases of LPS administration in human subjects concludes as follows, “for well over a 
century, endotoxin has been intentionally administered to humans for therapeutic purposes, for the evaluation 
of anti-inflammatory reagents as well as to address basic scientific questions of endotoxin biology.  Much has 
been learned from the use of this model, and it has proved to be remarkably safe. Well over 1,[ADDRESS_1253484] vagal hypersensitivity,”(123).Thus, all the available data support that LPS 
administration in healthy human subjects is safe. 
Lipopolysaccharide, or Clinical Center Reference Endotoxin (CCRE) will be produced by [CONTACT_894545] (IDS). CCRE is an investigational drug, 
and the PI, [CONTACT_894567] has obtained an Investigational New Drug (IND) for its use in humans from the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). CCRE vials will be stored at 2-8°C in a refrigerator in the locked IDS 
pharmacy.  Preparation of CCRE will be performed by [CONTACT_894546]. As recommended by [CONTACT_4289], the 
pharmacist will dissolve the lyophilized CCRE in Sterile Water for Injection USP under a laminar flow hood on the 
evening before each endotoxin administration. The dissolved CCRE will be stored at 4°C until the following 
morning.  Dissolved CCRE is stable for at least 24 hours at this temperature.
11.Minimizing Risks: Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be minimized.
To minimize the risk associated with screening and evaluation we will use trained personnel who will treat each 
subject with respect and compassion and who will be sensitive to any psychological discomfort produced during 
the screening or during any of the assessments.
To minimize the risk associated with confidentiality information about current and past psychiatric and medical 
history and results of screening labs will be stored in hardcopy files in a locked file cabinet or on a password-
protected computer in a locked office on the locked unit or the PIs locked office. Any data that is stored on a 
moveable digital media will be unlinked from the subject’s identifying information, and the codes linking the data 
to the subject will not be stored on such moveable media. Samples sent to laboratories for analysis will be coded 
by a study identifier that does not include any personal identifiers. All information obtained from participating 
subjects will be kept in locked confidential files. This information is not available to anyone except the Yale Human 
Investigations Committee (HIC), FDA, and the investigators and study personnel identified in this protocol. Access 
is only for study-related purposes. All data collected in this study will be kept for [ADDRESS_1253485]’s written permission. 
To minimize risks associated with blood drawing and venous and arterial catheter insertion, 
Risks of radial artery cannulation are minimized by [CONTACT_252269].  The health care provider would be either a physician or an advanced practice registered nurse 
(APRN) with experience in critical care and placement of arterial catheters, as is the practice at Yale-New Haven 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. For an APRN to place the arterial line at the Yale PET Center, they must meet the following criteria:
1.) Be currently credentialed at Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_252218]
2.) Perform [ADDRESS_1253486] be on file at the Yale PET Center prior to an APRN performing any 
arterial line catheterizations independently.

minimum of 15 minutes followed by a pressure dressing (coban) that should be kept clean and dry until evening. 
Subjects will have their hand and finger blood supply examined after arterial cannulation throughout the study, 
and again following catheter removal. Also, subjects will be asked to abstain from aspi[INVESTIGATOR_458980] 7-
[ADDRESS_1253488] or hand, or fever, chills or 
drainage from the vascular puncture sites, following the procedure. All medical staff at the PET center (RNs and 
MDs) are ACLS-certified and immediately available for urgent or emergency responses. In such a case that a 
subject would require further evaluation or stabilization, [ADDRESS_1253489] does not 
exceed Federal guidelines. The dose of radiation will be submitted for approval to the Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_894503] (RSC) and also reviewed by [CONTACT_894547] (YU-RSC). 
All scans will be done in the presence of medical supervision and trained nursing staff in an institution specifically 
designed to support imaging studies. In the event of serious medical complications, the Yale University PET scan 
facilities have immediate access to or consultation with specialized medical units at the Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Preparation of radiopharmaceuticals and execution of PET scans will be performed by [CONTACT_57223], physicians, 
and technologists of the Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Yale University School of Medicine. These 
professionals are qualified by [CONTACT_252271]. Subjects will 
be asked about their previous radiation exposure, and those who have had research exposure within the past year 
will be excluded if their cumulative annual exposure (including the present study) exceeds FDA limits.
To minimize risks associated with MRI, each subject will fill out the Yale Magnetic Resonance Research Center MRI 
Safety Questionnaire before the study. Only subjects who fulfill the criteria by [CONTACT_894548]. In addition, subjects will remove all metal (watch, hair pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115], jewelry) and change into scrubs 
immediately prior to the study and pass through the metal detector in the MRRC before entering the MRI room. If 
the subject has any metallic prostheses/implants they will be excluded from the study. If a subject becomes 
anxious during the scan they can request that the MRI scan be stopped. 
To minimize risks associated with pregnancy and breastfeeding we will not enroll women who are pregnant or 
breast-feeding.
To minimize risks associated with LPS administration we are administering a dose (1 ng/kg) that is 1/4 of the 
maximum dose (4 ng/kg) that can safely be used in human subjects research. Because we will enroll only 
physically healthy subjects under the age of [ADDRESS_1253490] will experience a serious adverse event. Subjects will be 
screened for a history of fainting or vasovagal syncope, and will be adequately hydrated prior to and during LPS 
administration. These measures are used to reduce the already very low odds of cardiovascular adverse events

DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN
Although this study qualifies as clinical research, it does not meet NIH criteria for Phase III clinical trial research. 
Nonetheless, this study will be monitored every [ADDRESS_1253491] (DSMB). Adequate 
surveillance and protections will be put in place to discover adverse events promptly and keep their effects to a 
minimum. There is an established DSMB at the Yale PET Center that meets every 6 months. 
Expected and Unexpected Adverse Events will be recorded according to PET Center and NIH guidelines. Should an 
unexpected or serious AE occur, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_894504]. 
AE’s will be captured either in paper form or through digital RedCap forms.  
Attribution of Adverse Events. 
We will use the Yale University School of Medicine – Human Investigation Committee recommended 
guidelines for assessing attribution adverse events.
Attribution of Risk Categories:

Plans for Grading Adverse Event.
For grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study we will adopt a general scheme from

Serious anticipated adverse events occurring with a greater frequency than expected, and unanticipated adverse 
events that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to study procedures will be reported.
All SAEs will result in the completion of an SAE Form and a verbal report within one hour to the corresponding 
Principal Investigator ([CONTACT_894568]). Within 24 hours, the following additional individuals will be informed: 1) the 
Co-PI [INVESTIGATOR_287689]-investigators; 2) the HIC; 3) the DSMB; 4) and NIMH. The Principal Investigator (Kelly Cosgrove, 
Ph.D.) will assume full responsibility for reporting serious adverse events. All of these individuals will receive a 
copy of the SAE Form at which point a decision will be made whether to convene a meeting of the DSMB. The 
DSMB and principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_894509]/Benefit ratio of the study and whether modifications to the protocol (at Risks to Participants, or 
in Procedures) or consent form (at Risks and Inconveniences) are required.
The procedures for SAE reporting include written documentation using the clinical notes related to the adverse 
event and specific forms detailing the event with a sign-off by [CONTACT_370552]. 
Communication of recommendations and decisions from all parties (DSMB, Yale Human Investigations 
Committee) are made back to the investigator in a timely manner. We will report all protocol amendments or 
changes in the informed consent form to NIMH as well as any temporary or permanent suspension of patient 
accrual.

r’s>.80) magnitude correlations among [11C]PBR28 V T values in all of the brain regions assessed. Thus, we will 
conduct a principal components analysis with oblique (promax) rotation of [11C]PBR28 V T values in all brain regions 
assessed to calculate a global composite measure of [11C]PBR28 V T values. 
A univariate ANCOVA will be used to compare global [11C]PBR28 V T values between trauma-exposed controls and 
individuals with PTSD. Group (Control vs. PTSD) and rs6971 genotype on the TSPO gene will be entered as fixed 
factors(102), variables that differ between Control and PTSD groups as additional fixed factors (categorical variables 
such as major depressive disorder) or covariates (continuous variables such as time since index trauma), and global 
[11C]PBR28 V T values as the dependent variable. A post-hoc multivariate ANCOVA will be conducted with the same 
independent variables and [11C]PBR28 V T values in individual brain regions entered as dependent variables; α will 
be set to 0.005 (0.05/10 brain regions) in this analysis to control for Type I error. To evaluate the relation between 
continuously distributed global [11C]PBR28 V T values and measures of post-traumatic threat and loss symptoms, and 
neurocognitive functioning, we will conduct a linear regression model using Mplus version 7.31(124). In this analysis, 
global [11C]PBR28 V T values will be modeled as the independent variable, and continuously-distributed scores on 
objective endophenotypic measures of threat and loss symptoms, and neurocognitive functioning, and clinician 
interview-based measures of threat and loss symptoms will be modeled as dependent variables. Should correlation 
analyses reveal large magnitude associations (i.e., r ≥ 0.70) among variables assessing a common construct (e.g., dot 
probe and clinician-assessed threat symptoms), observed indicator variables will be modeled and analyzed as latent 
variables.
Linear mixed-effects models will be used to compare LPS-induced changes in [11C]PBR28 V T values in the Trauma 
Control and PTSD groups. Group (Control vs. PTSD) and rs6971 polymorphism in the TSPO gene will be entered as 
fixed factors, subject as a random effect, pre-LPS global [11C]PBR28 V T values as a covariate, and post-LPS global 
[11C]PBR28 V T values as the dependent variable; variables that differ between Trauma Control and PTSD groups will 
be entered as additional fixed factors (categorical variables) or covariates (continuous variables). An ANCOVA with 
the rs6971 polymorphism in the TSPO gene and other variables that differ by [CONTACT_894549] %change in [11C]PBR28 V T values in the PTSD vs. Trauma Control group. Post-hoc analyses 
adjusted for multiple comparisons (α=0.005; 0.05/10 brain regions) will be conducted to evaluate LPS-induced 
changes in [11C]PBR28 V T values in individual brain regions in these two groups. Interrelationships among changes in 
outcome measures will be evaluated in the full sample and by [CONTACT_894550] 7.31.
Partial correlations adjusted for the rs6971 polymorphism will be conducted to examine associations between 
baseline and LPS-induced measures of global [11C]PBR28 V T values, peripheral inflammatory markers, and 
endophenotypic and phenotypic measures of threat, loss, and neurocognitive function. Associated peripheral 
inflammatory markers will then be entered into a bias-corrected bootstrap test of mediation to evaluate whether 
global [11C]PBR28 V T values mediate the relation between peripheral inflammatory markers, and measures of threat 
and loss symptoms, and neurocognitive function. A parallel set of tests of mediation will be conducted to examine 
whether LPS-induced increases in activated microglia mediate the relation between LPS-induced increases in 
peripheral inflammatory markers and the measures of threat and loss symptoms, and neurocognitive function. In 
this analysis, LPS-induced changes in peripheral inflammatory markers will be modeled as the independent variable, 
percent change in global [11C]PBR28 V T values as the mediator variable, and LPS-induced changes in threat and loss 
symptoms and neurocognitive function as dependent variables. These tests employ a non-parametric bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_223117] (10,000 samples) to generate estimates of direct and indirect effects, and confidence intervals(125-127).

    Confidentiality & Security of Data:
1. What protected health information (medical information along with the HIPAA identifiers) about subjects will 
be collected and used for the research?   Required private identifiable information about individuals, such as 
their medical history, current medications, psychiatric problems, and family history, will be collected by 
[CONTACT_281359].
2. How will the research data be collected, recorded and stored? The data are collected and recorded by [CONTACT_894561]. The data will be recorded on Excel spreadsheets that will be saved onto a server or will 
be in the form of questionnaires that are filled out by [CONTACT_96150]. These paper research 
materials containing confidential information are stored in locked filing cabinets.  Additional brain data is 
collected during the brain imaging scans by [CONTACT_96151]-protected and 
encrypted computers with identifying information carefully in compliance with HIPAA regulations.

4. What methods and procedures will be used to safeguard the confidentiality and security of the identifiable 
study data and the storage media indicated above during and after the subject’s participation in the study? 
All staff members that come into contact [CONTACT_894562]. Identifiable paper information is kept in locked file drawers and 
password protected computer files.  Results are published as group data without the use of characteristics 
that would identify individual subjects.  We quote information only by [CONTACT_29181], 
scientific reports, or publications, in order to maintain anonymity. Identifiable research data, including 
recruitment and screening information and code keys, are stored on a secure database located on the internal 
PET Center Network.  The PET network is protected by a Cisco PIX firewall operated by [CONTACT_57249].  All research data 
are backed up nightly to a Dell PV-136T library wit [ADDRESS_1253510] to gain access to the database.  Authorized users employ their netid and authentication is 
performed using Yale’s central authentication server.  Users always access research data through the random 
identifier only. Direct identifiers belonging to subjects who withdraw from the study, will be stripped from the 
key.
All portable devices must contain encryption software, per University Policy 5100.  If there is a technical reason a

SECTION V: POTENTIAL BENEFITS
Potential Benefits: Identify any benefits that may be reasonably expected to result from the research, either to 
the subject(s) or to society at large. (Payment of subjects is not considered a benefit in this context of the risk 
benefit assessment.) 
                  There is no direct benefit for participation in this study. All subjects in this study may derive subjective 
benefit from volunteering to take part in a study for the advancement of scientific knowledge. Subjects with 
PTSD could benefit from future treatments developed based on the results of this study. Psychiatric and physical 
examinations are also potential benefits. Because this study may not have direct benefit to individual subjects, 
they will be remunerated for time spent in PET and MR imaging sessions. The potential benefits for individuals 
and society at large are great; and the risk/benefit ratio appears favorable.
         SECTION VI: RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
1.Alternatives: What other alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the research? 
The alternative to participation in this research protocol is to not participate. Subjects will be informed that 
they are free to choose not to participate and, if they do agree to become a subject, they will be free to 
withdraw from the study at any time during its course. They will also be informed that if they choose not to 
participate or if they withdraw, it will not adversely affect their relationship with their doctors or the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (see attached Consent Form).
2.Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be made to 
subjects, the amount and schedule of payments, and the conditions for receiving this compensation.
The subjects will be compensated for their time commitment and inconveniences necessary for completing 
the study. Subjects will have no financial responsibilities for any portion of the study. Subjects may have the 
opportunity to receive approximately $1,210 ($1,610 the event a scan cancels): They may receive up to $50 
for baseline assessments ($40 cog testing, $10 dot probe), $350 for each PET scan and $50 for each arterial 
line placement on PET scan day, $50 for the MRI, $150 for endotoxin administration, and a $[ADDRESS_1253512] Task may also be compensated 
for the amount that they “win” during the task up to $50, $[ADDRESS_1253513] or cash. Subjects will be provided with a light meal on PET imaging day and may be provided and/or 
reimbursed for meals during inpatient stay.  Reasonable transportation costs will be reimbursed.  Receipts 
must be submitted. If participation in the PET scan has already begun, then compensation will be based on 
involvement in the study, and will be up to the discretion of the PI. Cancellations: If a PET scan should get 
cancelled for a reason outside of the subject's control (i.e. radiotracer synthesis failure) the subject will be 
paid $[ADDRESS_1253514]'s length of participation on that scan day prior to the 
cancellation, and will be up to the discretion of the PI.

provided by [CONTACT_20917]-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20888] (examples include x-rays, 
MRIs, CT scans, specimens sent to central labs, or specimens sent to pathology). Notes: 1. There is no distinction 
made whether the service is paid for by [CONTACT_20918] (Standard of Care) or by [CONTACT_1758]’s funding 
mechanism (Research Sponsored). 2. This generally includes new services or orders placed in EPIC for research 
subjects. 
If answered, “yes”, this study will need to be set up in OnCore, Yale’s clinical research management system, 
for Epic to appropriately route research related charges. Please contact [EMAIL_365]

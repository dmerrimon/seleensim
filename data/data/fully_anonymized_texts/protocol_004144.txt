 SYNOPSIS  
 
This randomized, controlled, double-masked (subject and observer) clinical trial 
intends to randomize approximately [ADDRESS_10723] been diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular 
hypertension (OHT).  All subjects are required to meet eligibility criteria at Visit 
1 (Screening ) and unmedicated  IOP inclusion criteria at Visit 2  (Baseline).  The 
purpose of this study is to evaluate the IOP-lowering effect of each of two investigational implanted medication treatments, as compared to a control topi[INVESTIGATOR_11226].   After completing Visit 2 ( Baseline) , subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation to one of three study treatment arms:  model  
G2TR  implant (test) arm, model G2TR  implant (test) arm, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_11227] (control) arm.  Postoperative ly, there are 16 follow-up visits over a 
three- year period .  Specul ar microscopy photos will be collected at selected sites .

June 06, [ADDRESS_10726] on a patient's vision and quality of life.  Reducing intraocular pressure currently is the only proven treatment for 
glaucoma.  
Treatment for open -angle glaucoma (OAG) traditionally has started with 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_11228].  Development of more effective 
medications has increased the popularity of this approach as initial treatment compared to more invasive incisional or drainage device surgery. 
Furthermore, the more benign medication treatments preserve the ocular 
tissues in the event that more invasive surgical approaches are eventually required. 
The various topi[INVESTIGATOR_11229], β -adrenergic receptor antagonists (β -blockers), carbonic anhydrase 
inhibitors (CAIs), α -adrenergic receptor agonists (α -agonists), and 
prostaglandin analogues (PGA s).  The PG As are a class of ocular hypotensive 
agents that have been proven effective in lowering IOP in subjects with OAG or OHT.  Other a dvantages of this class of medications is that the systemic 
side effects associated wi th α-agonists (e.g., dry mouth, drowsiness) 
and  β - blockers (e.g., depression, fatigue, bradycardia) do not appear to be 
associated with PG As.  Furthermore, the ocular side effects typi[INVESTIGATOR_11230] a-agonists (e.g., allergic reactions), and choli nergic agents 
(e.g., reduced  vision), do not seem to manifest with the use of PGA s. 
However , PGAs have been shown to be associated with side effects such as 
ocular hyperemia, iris hyperchromia, periorbital atrophy, increased eyelash growth, general ocular surface discomfort and headache.

Both implants will be compared to Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution, USP, 0.5% (timolol) for reducing intraocular pressure in subjects with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). 
3 CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS  
The following are the hypotheses for the study: 
- Intraocular implants containing travoprost are at least as effective as 
timolol in achieving lowered intraocular pressure (IOP) in subjects with 
OAG or OHT.  
- Intraocular implants containing travoprost are well- tolerated.

Date:   Phase:   Protocol No.:  
June 06, [ADDRESS_10740]'s condition after receiving any of 
the study treatments , regardless of causality, is to be considered an adverse 
event, unless the change is determined to be a continuation of a pre-existing 
condition that is documented in the subject's medical history.  If an adverse 
event occurs,  an AE form must be completed.   
An AE includes any of the following: 
• An exacerbation or an unexpected increase in frequency or intensity of a 
pre-existing condition, including intermittent or epi[INVESTIGATOR_11238] 
• New conditions or illnesses detected or diagnosed after the implant or 
sham procedure 
• A suspected interaction with any of the study treatments 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either any of the study treatments or a concomitant medication 
• Any clinically significant laboratory fin ding that was not present prior to 
receiving any of the study treatments 
An AE does NOT  inc
 lude any of the following: 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of any pre-existing conditions, 
including the disease under study (OAG and OHT). 
• Medical or surgical p rocedure, (e.g., colonoscopy or hernia repair).  The 
condition that led to the procedure may be an AE, if not present in medical history. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11239] (social o r convenience admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
• Pre-existing conditions or diseases that were present before receiving any 
of the study treatments that do not worsen or that are chronic but stable 
• Changes in a chronic condition or disease that are consistent with natural disease progression.  ( These medical conditions should be adequately 
documented).   
• Lack of efficacy of the study treatment for the condition being investigated.

 AEs will be graded on a 3-point scale and reported in detail as indicated on 
the CRF:  
Mild : easi ly tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with normal everyday activities  
Moderate: suff iciently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities  
Severe:  incapa citating and/or preventing normal everyday activities 
 
The relationship of each AE to study treatment  should be determined by [CONTACT_11258]: 
 Definitely Unrelated : th
 e event is clearly related to other factors such as the 
subject’s  clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or 
concomitant medications administered to the subject  
 
Unlikely Related : t he event is most likely produced by [CONTACT_11259]’s  clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or 
concomitant medications administered to the subject ; and 
does not follow a known response pattern to the study medication  
 
Possibly Related : th
 e event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
the time of dru g administration; and/or follows a known 
response pattern to the study medication; but could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s  
clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject  
 
Probably Related : th
 e event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
the time of drug administration; and /or follows a known 
response pattern to the study medication; and is not likely to have been produced by [CONTACT_11260]’s  clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or 
concomitant medications administered to the subject  
 
Definitely Related : th
 e event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
the time of drug administration; and follows a known response pattern to the study medication; and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s  clinical state, therapeutic inter ventions, or 
concomitant medications administered to the subject  
 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
Date:   Phase:   Protocol No.:  
June 06, [ADDRESS_10741], or precaution.  Any adverse event is considered a s erious adverse event if it results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
- Death  
- Life- or sight-threatening 
- Required admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11240]  (emergency room visits that do not result in admission 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11241]) 
- A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
- A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 
The terms “mild,” “moderate,” and “severe” are measures of intensity; thus a severe AE is not necessarily serious .  For example, nausea of several hours 
duration may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11242] a serious adverse drug 
experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may requ ire medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  A life -threatening event is any 
event that places the subject at substantial risk of death from the event as it occurred; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically m ight have caused 
death if it were more severe.  A sight-threatening event is any event that places the subject at risk of permanently losing vision in either eye as a direct result of the event. 
 
Serious adverse events must be reported to Glaukos immediately  (preferably 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event ). 
Email:   
When new significant information (including the outcome of the event) is

10.3 Suspected, Unexpected, Serious, Adverse Event (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R) is a ny AE for 
which there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
Travoprost Intraocular Implant  and the AE, and which is assessed as both 
unexpected and serious.  An unexpected adverse reaction, i.e. any untoward and unintended response to any of the study treatments, is one for which the nature and severity is inconsistent with the applicable reference safety information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure).

WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI  
 
Ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects 
 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964 
and amended by [CONTACT_941]: 
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_10751] WMA General Assembly, Washington DC, [LOCATION_003], October 2002 (Note of 
Clarification added)  
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 2004 (Note of 
Clarification added)  
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 2008 
64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013 
 
Preamble 1.         The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of 
Helsinki as a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of it s 
constituent paragraphs should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs. 
 2.         Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed 
primarily to physicians.  The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles. 
 
General Principles  
3.         The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the 
words, “The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the 
International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient’s best interest when providing medical care.” 
 4.         It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well-
being and rights of patients, including those who are involved in medical 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
Date:   Phase:   Protocol No.:

 CONFIDENTIAL   page 66 of 72 
 research. The physician’s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the 
fulfilment of this duty.  
 5.         Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies 
involving human subjects. 
 6.         The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to 
understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments).   Even the best proven interventions must be evaluated 
continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
 7.         Medical research is  subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure 
respect for all human subjects and protect their health and rights. 
 8.         While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new 
knowledge, this goal can never take precedence over the r ights and 
interests of individual research subjects. 
 9.         It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect 
the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research subjects.  The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given consent. 
 10.       Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and 
standards for research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards.  No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this 
Declaration.  
 
11.       Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimises possible 
harm to the environment. 
 12.       Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by 
[CONTACT_11272], training and qualifications.  Research on patients or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other health care professional.

In clinical trials, the protocol must also desc ribe appropriate arrangements 
for post-trial provisions. 
 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
Date:   Phase:   Protocol No.:  
June 06, [ADDRESS_10754] submit a final 
report to the committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions. 
 Privacy and Confidentiality 24.       Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects 
and the confidentiality of their personal information. 
 Informed Consent  
25.       Participation by [CONTACT_11273].  Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees.  
 26.       In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed 
consent, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, 
institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and 
potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, post-study provisions and any other relevant aspects of the study.  The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal.  Special attention should be given to the specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information. 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
Date:   Phase:   Protocol No.:  
June 06, [ADDRESS_10755]’s freely -given informed consent, preferably in 
writing.  If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non- written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being 
informed about the general outcome and results of the study. 
 27.       When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the 
physician must be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a 
dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress.  In 
such situations the informed consent must be sought by [CONTACT_11274]. 
 28.       For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed 
consent, the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorised representative.  These individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by [CONTACT_11275], the research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk 
and minimal burden. 
 
29.       When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving 
informed consent is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorised representative.   The potential s ubject’s dissent 
should be respected. 
 30.       Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of 
giving consent, for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a 
necessary characteristic of the research  group.  In such circumstances the 
physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorised 
representative.   If no such representative is available and if the research 
cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethi cs 
committee.   Consent to remain in the research must be obtained as soon as 
possible from the subject or a legally authorised representative. 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
Date:   Phase:   Protocol No.:  
June 06, [ADDRESS_10756] fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are 
related to the research.  The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient -physician relationship. 
 32.       For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as 
resea rch on material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, 
physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse.   There may be exceptional situations where consent would be 
impossible or impracticable to obtain for suc h research.   In such situations 
the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
 Use of Placebo  
33.       The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must 
be tested against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances: 
• Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or 
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any interve ntion less effective than the best 
proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention 
• and the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not be subject 
to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of not 
receiving the best proven intervention. 
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
 Post-Trial Provisions 
34.       In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country 
governments should make provisions for post- trial access for all 
participants who still need an intervention identified as beneficial in the trial.  This information must also  be disclosed to participants during the 
informed consent process. 
 
 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
Date:   Phase:   Protocol No.:  
June 06, [ADDRESS_10757] been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorised representative, may use an unproven 
intervention if in the physician’s judgement it offers hope of saving life, 
re-establishing health or alleviating suffering.  This intervention should 
subseque ntly be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its 
safety and efficacy.   In all cases, new information must be recorded and, 
where appropriate, made publicly available.

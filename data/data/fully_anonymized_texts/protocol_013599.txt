PI [INVESTIGATOR_119426] - last revised: 11/04/[ADDRESS_133197] been revised as per the [LOCATION_002] (US) National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) standardization update (agreed on 17 MAR 2015).  [ADDRESS_133198] line treatment of metastatic prostate cancer with androgen deprivation thera py 
(ADT) is effective in the majority of men, by [CONTACT_119465], but  is not curative.  The disease eventually progresses despi[INVESTIGATOR_119427] -resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Recent advances in understanding of prostate cancer 
biology and the androgen signaling axis has led to the development of multiple novel agents  for 
treatment options for CRPC, each with its own distinct mechanism of action .  There are at least 4 
different classes of treatment recently FDA -approved for metastatic CRPC: androgen signaling inhibitors  
(abiraterone, enzalutamide) , cytotoxic chemotherapy  (cabazitaxel) , immunotherapy  (sipuleucel -T), and 
bone targeted therapy  (radium -223) .  Individually, each agent  has demonstrated efficacy and survival 
benefits in randomized, phase III clinical  trials  [1-7]. 
 
The s tandard approach is to use one treatment until resistance develops, then change to a different 
treatment.  
While optimal timing and sequence of these new treatments are still the subject of clinical investigation , 
the standard treatment approach  so far has been to continue with a single treatment agent until 
resistance develops, at which point the patient is switched  to a different treatment.  
The emerging concept of tumor heterogeneity, both between different prostate cancer patients and 
within a single tumor, argues that a “one size fits all” sequential , single -agent  approach to cancer 
treatment ultimately will have  limited success.   Inherent gene tic instability from rapi[INVESTIGATOR_119428]  [8], and along with it, varied amounts of 
genetic dysregulation and varied patterns of  anti-neoplastic resistance  [9].  A single agent treatment 
may succeed in effecting a response on the majority of mali gnant cells, but may  select for more resilient 
subpopulations, eventually leading to drug resistance  and treatment failure .  New first -in-class 
therapeutics that exhibit anti -tumor activity even in the face of multi -drug resistance are in 
development,  but eventually  these will likely breed  resistance  as well . 
 
Combining drugs  is a classic oncologic paradigm , but dose limiting toxicities can be significant . 
Combination drug therapy  has been a paradigm atic approach  not only to improve response to 
treatment, but also to avoid  therapeutic resistance .  The probability of the disease simultaneous  
develop ing resistance towards  multiple agents is far less than that towards a  single agent  alone .  This 
concept has parallels in treatment  of infectious disease, where the simultaneous use of multiple 
antibacterial or antiretroviral agents has long been the standard for treatment of tuberculosis and HIV , 
respectively .  Multiple regimens o f combin ation chemotherapy  are already in routine use in both the 
hematolo gic and solid tumor malignancies , with significant rates of cures in diseases such as Hodgkin 
lymphoma  and testicular cancer.   
 
Treating  prostate cancer simultaneously with multiple  agent s from each class of therapy  (androgen 
signaling  inhibitors, cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy,  bone -targeted therapy)  would cause  
significantly increased side effects.  While it may be more justifiable to treat with a regimen that has 
more  side effects when the intent is curative , regimens meant to  control or palliate a malignancy over 
long er periods of time need to strike a  fine balance between toxicity , efficacy, and quality of life.   
PRINT - last revised: 11/04/[ADDRESS_133199] been revised as per the [LOCATION_002] (US) National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) standardization update (agreed on 17 MAR 2015).  [ADDRESS_133200] -of-care chemotherapy regimens , particularly in the treatment of aggressive hematologic 
malignancies.  Hyper -CVAD, used in the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)  [10] and Burkitt 
lymphoma  [11], and the Stanford V regimen , used in advanced bulky Hodgkin lymphoma  [12], are two 
examples of  complex regimens that require alternating cycles of different drug combinations.  They rely 
on the differential timing and delivery of different drugs to be able t o preserve dose intensity of each 
individual agent, without  being overwhelming by [CONTACT_119466] . 
 
Understanding that metastatic prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease  [13-15], both intrapersonally 
and between patients, the cycling of treatment would allow  for the targeting of different cell 
populations.  By [CONTACT_119467] -cross reactive th erapie s, the selective pressure  exerted by  [CONTACT_119468]’s intermittent use is limited  [16], allowing resistance rates to stab ilize or decrease 
in its absence .  The rationale underlying this strategy is that  drug resistance evolution is related to the 
duration of drug exposure , and that a gain of drug resistance comes with a biological fitness cost.  This is 
a concept also seen in infectious diseases; the higher the fitness cost, the more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_119429] a disease population once the selec tive pressure is removed, as the nonresistant cells 
outcompete the resistant cells  [17].  In this way, the same agent can be reintroduced at a later time with 
its efficacy intact, sustaining drug sensitivity and long term disease response . 
 
1.2 Research Proposal /Rationale  
This phase II clinical trial will explore the efficacy of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_119430]-cross  reactive treatment 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_119431].  The primary  hypothesis is that the  
best chance of eliminating or controlling disease  is when the cancer  is treatment naïve, and has not yet 
developed therapeutic  resistance.  By [CONTACT_119469] , we believe we can more effectively treat an intrinsically  
hete rogeneous disease , delay /prevent  drug resistance , as well as minimize treatment toxicity . 
 
All of the treatment agents selected have well -defined individual toxicity profiles from large phase III 
trials, but there is limited clinical data about the toxicity profiles of these drugs in combinations.  While 
each agent is generally well tolerated, toxicities remain  a significant concern given th e older  age of the 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_119432], the comorbid conditions common to this patient population, as well as those 
borne from previous chronic androgen deprivation therapy.   
 
Each  drug  in the proposed treatment regimen will be used at their FDA-approve d dosing  and indication , 
with the exception of cabazitaxel, which will be used prior to disease demonstration of docetaxel failure , 
PRINT - last revised: 11/04/[ADDRESS_133201] been revised as per the [LOCATION_002] (US) National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) standardization update (agreed on 17 MAR 2015).  10 and in combination with carboplatin  (discussed below) .  The proposed sequencing is rationally designed, 
and based on each dr ug’s distinct mechanisms of action as well as their toxicity profiles.    
 
Our rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] -cycling treatment regimen contains three, separate, consecutive treatment mo dules, each 
lasting 3 months: 1. Abiraterone; 2 . Cabazitaxel + Carboplatin; 3. Enzalutamide + Radium -223.   
Therapeutic agents are delivered as non -cross reactive combinations, in order to achieve  optimal  
therapeutic dosing at each cycle and decrease possibility of significant adverse effects.  
 
Utilizing PCWG2 guidelines to define progression of disease  by [CONTACT_30776], a patient must have been on 
treatment for at least [ADDRESS_133202] on low disease burden  [18].  As 
sipuleucel -T is approved for use only in the asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic stages of disease , 
this would grant  patien ts the opportunity to receive a treatment that has shown overall survival benefit 
in large, random ized phase III clinical trial.  It would also allow patients to receive it at a time before they 
have had any significant corticosteroid  exposure , which the m ajority of other CRPC treatments require, 
as it may blunt immunologic effects of dendritic cell vaccines.  
 
In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_119433], concurrent zolendronic acid or denosumab use will be allowed on 
study, we will track its use in our cohort of patie nts 
 
Controlling the a ndrogen signaling axis remains  key in CRPC , but there exists  heterogeneity in response 
and progression to drugs which target th is pathway in prostate cancer.  A comprehensive approach to 
targeting the androgen signaling axis via androgen synthesis inhibition and androgen receptor blockade  
will be undertaken with abiraterone  and enzalutamide .  Both therapeutic agents have been approved by 
[CONTACT_119470] -chemotherapy and post -chemotherapy space  based on 
their merits in prolonging time to PSA progression and PFS in chemotherapy -naïve patients [3, 19], and 
OS benefits in the chemotherapy -refractory patients [2, 4]. 
 
While no directly comparative studies have been performed, b oth abiraterone and enzalutamide 
showed in their respective randomized trials to have comparable median time to PSA progression (11.1 
months and  11.2 mo nths ) in the pre -chemotherapy setting .  Optimal s equencing  of the two AR -pathway 
targeting  agents have been the subject of controversy, especially as there are likely overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_119434] [20-23].  Small  studies looking at the 
efficacy of one agent f ollowing the other in direct sequence suggest that the percentage of men who 
have a >50% PSA response from the later agent are higher in those who received abiraterone first and 
enzalutamide second [20-24].  The role of glucocorticoid receptors as a potential mechanism of 
enzalutamide  resistance  [25] also lends consideration for sequencing abiraterone earlier given its 
PRINT - last revised: 11/04/[ADDRESS_133203] been revised as per the [LOCATION_002] (US) National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) standardization update (agreed on 17 MAR 2015).  [ADDRESS_133204] inhibitor following failure of a previous one is not strongly 
supported because of likely overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_119435] .   Earlier  studies raise the possibility 
of cross -resistance between AR-directed agents and taxanes  [26], specifically the decreased efficacy of 
docetax el in abiraterone -refractory mCRPC  [27].  Mechanistically, it’s hypothesized that taxanes disrupt  
microtubule functio n, which is essential not only in cellular division, but also in androgen receptor 
nuclear trafficking [28].  More recent data suggest s that taxanes exhibit their significant antineoplastic 
effects through AR -pathway independent pathways as well, with second generation agents such as 
cabazitaxel retaini ng efficacy even in the enzalutamide -refractory setting  [29].  In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_119436], the cytotoxic chem otherapy module is juxtaposed between the abiraterone 
and enzalutamide modules.  
 
Though structurally similar, recent in vitro data finds that cabazitaxel suppresses microtubule dynamic 
instability more strongly than docetaxel, is taken up into cells signif icantly faster, and is retained in cells 
longer, likely explaining the potency of cabazitaxel in docetaxel -resistant tumors  [30].  Given that this 
trial is designed to thwart resistance development, this drives the decision to move cabazitaxel into a 
position of front -line therapy.  A phase III randomized trial is currently underway to compare 
cabazitaxel /prednisone vs. docetaxel/prednisone in the chemotherapy -naïve CRPC population 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .   
 
Platinum agents have long been studied in prostate cancer and may play a stronger role in treatment of 
prostate cancer with neuroendocrine or aggressive featur es.  Androgen -independent neuroendocrine 
cells, which are classically platinum -sensitive, are thought to be selected for by [CONTACT_119471] [31].  Recent studies have shown that th e addition of ca rboplatin to docetaxel is 
well tolerated and d emonstrate s significant activity both in the first -line and the docetaxel -refractory 
disease setting [32-34]. 
 
While the combination of cabazitaxel and carboplatin have  not yet been extensively studied, side effect 
profiles between docetaxel and cabazitaxel are similar given their similar mechanisms of action, making 
it a suitable and reasonable sub stitute for docetaxel.  A phase I study of the cabazitaxel and carboplatin 
combination finds it to be safe and have significant antitumor activity [35], with its key dose -limiting 
toxicity of neutropenia  able to be abrogated with the addition of pegfilgrastim.  Recently reported at 
ASCO 2015, a multi -institutional randomized phase II study comparing cabazitaxel vs. cabazitaxel plus 
carboplatin demonstrated improved PFS and response rates with the addition of carboplatin to 
cabazitaxel in men with mCRPC that have failed at least one line of prior therap y [36].

presence of visceral metastases will not discount the use of radium -223, as it will be paired with 
enzalutamide . 
 
Radium -223 will not be offered in combination with abiraterone as part of this study, due to a recent 
safety analysis leading to the unblinding of a randomized trial evaluating abiraterone with or without 
radium ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Interim data suggests an inc reased treatment emergent fractures, worse

infor mation in men with CRPC.  We previously developed a  six-gene RNA signature  (consisting of ABL2, 
SEMA4D, ITGAL, C1QA, TIMP1, and CKDN1A) with prognostic significance for survival, demo nstrating the 
ability to stratify men with CRPC into low -risk and high -risk group s [37].  The effect of different  classes of 
therapeutic agents on this six gene signature, as well as its correlation with clinical  outcome, is the 
subject of further study.   
 
A potential mechanism by [CONTACT_119472] -directed agents is via constitutively active 
androgen receptor variants (AR -V).  AR-Vs have been shown to be expressed in hormone -sensitive 
prostate ca ncer cells, but at significantly lower levels as compared to castration -resistant disease [38].  
Recent data associates  patients with AR-V7 expression in cir culating tumor cells (CTCs) with worse 
treatment response to  AR-target agents  [39], suggesting AR -V7 as a  predictive  biomark er for resistance.   
More studies are needed to validate AR -V7 as a predictive biomarker, as well as to better understand 
changes to its expression associated with different therapeutic agents and clinical outcome.  
 
The design of this trial  will expose pati ents to multiple different types of therapy and have a significant 
interval of follow up, so it presents a prime  opportunity to evaluate the predictive  potentials of t he six -
gene signature  [CONTACT_119495] -V7 expression .  We also plan to bank additional blood specim ens for future 
correlative science studies.

completion of all treatment modules will be counted.  
 
3.2.1 PSA Progression  
PSA progression is as defined by [CONTACT_43877]2 criteria [40].  Baseline PSA will be defined as the serum PSA 
level measured following completion of the third treatment module.   
 
PSA changes will be reported globally using a waterfall plot for each module.   In patients who have a 
decline in PSA value from baseline, progression is defined by:  
 An increase in PSA by 25% above the nadir, AND  
 An increase in PSA by a minimum of 2 ng/ml, or an increase in PSA to the pre -treatment PSA 
value, AND  
 Confirmation by a second PSA at least 3 weeks apart, AND  
 Occur following at least 12 weeks of therapy, AND  
 There is no objective evidence of disease response.  
 
In patients whose PSA value from baseline has not declined from baseline, progression is defined by:

 Occur following at least 12 weeks of therapy, AND  
 There is no ob jective evidence of disease response.

Radiographic  progression will be evaluated by [CONTACT_16622] (RECIST)

(longest diameter to be recorded) with a minimum size of [ADDRESS_133212] scan (CT scan slice thickness no 
greater than 5 mm) and 20 mm by [CONTACT_69145] (X-ray).  All tumor measurements will be 
recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).

baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis of the lymph nodes will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-Measurable Disease  
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <[ADDRESS_133214] or pathological lymph nodes > 
10 to <15 mm in short axis) as well as truly non -measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non -
measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, lymphangitic 
involvement of skin or l ung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_119475].

(NIST) standardization update (agreed on 17 MAR 2015).  15 Special considerations  
Bone lesions:  
• Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques  to measure bone 
lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone 
lesions.  
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, that can be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_119476] l imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable 
lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above.  
• Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
 
Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a max imum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, representative of 
all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target 
lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest  diameter) and their 
suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the 
longest diameters (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The 
baseline sum LD will be  used as reference by [CONTACT_119477].  
 
Non-Target Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Non -target lesions include measurable lesions that exceed the maximum numbers 
per organ or total of all involved organs as well as non -measurable lesions. Measurements of these 
lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
 
Response Criteri a for Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions .  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum LD.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started .  The sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  T he appearance of one or more new lesions  is also considered 
progression . 
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.  
 
Response Criteria for Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker 
level.   All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in  size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD) : Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of two or more new lesions and/or u nequivocal progression of 
existing non -target lesions.

Outcomes Based on Radionuclide Bone Scans  
The subjectivity in interpreting serial changes in radionuclide bone scan is well recognized.  The primary 
outcome will be whether the scan is stable or improved vs. worse or progression.  Changes in intensity 
will not be used as an outcome measure.   
 
Stable/Improved : A stable or improved classification requires that no new lesions appear or that new 
pain has not developed in an area that was previously visualized.  
 
Progression : Two or more new lesions not consistent with tumor flare, confirmed on a sec ond bone scan 
≥ 6 weeks later that shows ≥ [ADDRESS_133217] 12 weeks of therapy will not be evaluable for PSA response.  
 
Patient s with a 50% PSA decline from their baseline PSA level will be considered responders , provided 
objective tumor measurement s are stable  or also demonstrate response.  Patients  with a 25% PSA 
increase from their baseline PSA will be considered nonresponders.  Patients that do not meet criteria 
for responder or nonresponder, will be considered to have stable disease.

Abiraterone  
Abiraterone is generally well tolerated, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_119480], in both the pre - 
and post -chemotherapy settings [2, 3].  Compared to placebo, abiraterone has a notably higher 
incidence of adverse effects associated with mineralocorticoid excess due to CYP17 blockade: fluid 
retention/edema, hypokalemia, and hypertension.  These side effects are generally grade [ADDRESS_133237] common side effects observed with abiraterone are fatigue, back 
pain, nausea, constipation, bone pain, and arthralgia, and are primarily grade 1 or 2.  Dose 
modification/interrupti on or treatment discontinuation of abiraterone due to adverse effects was 
similar to that of placebo in both phase III trials.  
 
Radium -223 
As radium -223 is a highly targeted radioisotope with short range effects, adverse effects to normal 
tissue and myelos uppression is minimized.  Overall incidence of adverse events of all grades, and those 
graded III or IV, were lower in the radium -223 arm as compared to the placebo arm in the phase III trial 
that got it approved [6].  Notable grade [ADDRESS_133238] compression.  No differences in the frequency 
of hematologic toxicities were observed between the radium and placebo arms.  One instance of grade 
5 thrombocytopenia occurred during the trial that  is considered possibly due to radium -223.  
 
Cabazitaxel  
In phase III study  [1], cabazitaxel commonly caused hematological toxicities, of which the most common 
grade [ADDRESS_133239] of the taxane class, was present in 14% of 
patients in the cabazitaxel arm, although was uncommon  (1%) as a grade [ADDRESS_133240] been demonstrated to be safe when given 
concurrently; its key dose -limiting toxicity of neutropenia  abrogated with the administration of 
prophylactic pegfilgrasti m [35], which this trial incorporates.  Notabl e grade 3 -4 adverse events of the 
cabazitaxel/carboplatin combination reported by a recent randomized phase II study were mainly 
hematologic : neutropenia (15%), anemia (10%), thrombocytopenia (8%), and fatigue (10%).  Febrile 
neutropenia was a rare occurrence (2%) [36]. 
 
Carboplatin  
Carbop latin is a well studied agent and used in multiple chemotherapy combinations.   Dosing is 
calculated by [CONTACT_119481] a: total dose  (in milligrams) = Target AUC x (GFR + 
25).  For GFR that is estimated instead  of measured, the FDA recommends cappi[INVESTIGATOR_119440] a maximum of 
125 mL/min to avoid potential toxicities.  Its most notable adverse effects are hematologic: moderate 
incidence of grade 3/4 anemia (21%), leukopenia (15 -26%), neutropenia (16 -21%) , and 
PRINT - last revised: 11/04/[ADDRESS_133241] been revised as per the [LOCATION_002] (US) National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) standardization update (agreed on 17 MAR 2015).  21 thrombocy topenia (25 -35%) .  Myelosuppression is dose dependent and is often the dose limiting 
toxicity.  Other  commonly reported adverse effects of carboplatin include pain, nausea, vomiting, 
weakness, hypersensitivity/allergic reactions, electrolyte disturbances ( hyponatremia, 
hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia), decreased creatinine clearance, and LFT abnormalities.  
Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic and ototoxic potential.  
 
Enzalutamide  
Enzalutamide , when used prior to chemotherapy exposure,  was shown to have a good tolerability 
profile in PREVAIL  [19], having similar rates of grade 3 or higher adverse events as compared to placebo 
(43% vs. 37%).  Adverse events that occurred slightly more often with enzalutamide in clude fatigue (36% 
vs. 26%), back pain (27% vs. 22%), constipation (22% vs. 17%), and arthralgia (20% vs. 16%), although 
the majority of these are grade [ADDRESS_133242] experience 
(including a clinically significant laboratory finding classified as grade ≥ 3 by [CONTACT_6808]’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]) that develops or worsens during 
the course of the study, whether or not the event is considered related to study drug, and should be 
recorded only after the first dose of study drug is taken.  Serious  adverse events are recorded from the 
time the informed consent form is signed.  
 
5.2.1 Definitions  
Serious adverse event (SAE) : any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death,  
 Is life threatening, (Note: the term “life -threatening” ref ers to an event/reaction in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event/reaction; it does not refer to an event/ 
reaction which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe),  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119441] s in prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
 Is a medically important event or reaction. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised 
in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious, such as important medical 
events that might not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but 
might jeopardize the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of t he other 
outcomes listed in the definition above.  
 
Related Adverse Event, i.e. Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) : There is a reasonable possibility according to 
the IST/ISS sponsor that the product may have caused the event.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction : An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not 
consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., package insert/summary of product 
characteristics for an approved product). An expected ADR with a fatal outcome should be considered 
unexpe cted unless the local/regional product labeling specifically states that the ADR might be 
associated with a fatal outcome.

[IP_ADDRESS] NIST Standardization  Amendment  
The quantification of radium -223 radioactivity in Xofigo (radium -223 dichloride; BAY 88 -8223) is based

standardization) as published [43]. The NIST SRM is used to calibrate the instruments in production and 
quality control for both the drug substance and drug product. Additionally, the NIST SRM is used to 
prepare the NIST traceable Ra -223 refer ence materials which are then sent to the end -users (e.g., 
nuclear medicine laboratory physicians or technicians) for dial -setting of their dose calibrators, to allow 
verification of the patient dose. In 2014, NIST performed a re -assessment of the primary standardization 
based on preliminary information suggesting a potential discrepancy of approximately 8 -10% between 
the published NIST primary standardization [43] and results obtained by [CONTACT_119482] ([LOCATION_008], [LOCATION_013], Japan). After completion of the re -assessment, NIST reported 
their findings  and had issued a revised NIST SRM in 2015  [44]. The discrepancy in the NIST

to the study center. (A new reference vial will be sent to each cente r corresponding to the updated NIST 
reference material).   Different clinical study centers possess dose calibrators from various suppliers; 
thus, the isotope calibration factor may differ from center to center. Consequently, each center must 
perform the Radium - 223 dichloride dial setting on their relevant dose c alibrator(s) (upon notification by 
[CONTACT_119483]). The 
current dial settings are to remain in effect until Bayer obtains full approval from the FDA for 
implementation.  In p reparation for implementation of the new dial setting, the clinical study center will 
receive a sealed vial labeled NIST standard containing a Radium -[ADDRESS_133253] revised: 11/04/[ADDRESS_133254] been revised as per the [LOCATION_002] (US) National Institute of Standards and Technology

[IP_ADDRESS] Dose calculation  
The dosage of Radium -223 dichloride is 50 kBq/kg body weight (55kBq/kg after NIST update). The 
patient dose is calculated based on date of injection, a decay correction (DK) factor specific to number of 
days from reference date applied to correct for physical decay of radium -223 , and patient weight. . A 
table with DK values according to physical decay of the study medication  will be provided with every 
shipment of Radium -223 dichloride. Radium -223 is an alpha particle emitter with a physical t1/2 of 11.4 
days. The radioactive concentration at the reference date is 1,000 kBq/mL (1,100 kBq/mL after 
implementation of NIST update ).

≥75,000  cells/mm3, and non -hematologic toxicities attributed to the combination of cabazitaxel  and 
carboplatin  resolved to ≤ Grade 2.  Specific AE’s and their management strategies are specified below. 
The two agents have some overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685], and since they are being given in combination, should 
dose reduction become necessary, we will favor dose reducing carboplatin first over cabazitaxel, as 
cabazitaxel has demonstrated OS benefit in mCRPC patients .  Any return to protocol dose level after 
dose reduction must follow documentation of AE resolution and discussion with the Primary 
Investigator.  
 
Every effort  will be made to administer the full dose regimen to maximize dose -intensity.  
If possible, toxicities should be managed symptomatically. If toxicity occurs, the appropriate treatment 
will be used to improve signs and symptoms including antiemetics for naus ea and vomiting, 
antidiarrheals for diarrhea, and antipyretics, and/or antihistamines for drug fever.  
 
Dose can be reduced for cabazitaxel when necessary as described in following sections. The dose, which 
has been reduced for toxicity, must not be re -esca lated.  Only one dose reductions will be allowed per 
patient. If a second dose reduction is required per the modifications below, the patient should 
discontinue study treatment.   Treatment may be delayed no more than 2 weeks to allow recovery from 
acute to xicity. In case of treatment delay greater than 2 weeks, patient should discontinue cabazitaxel.  
 
Blood counts will be performed in case of fever or infection.  No dose modification will be made for 
anemia; patients will be supported appropriately by [CONTACT_941] t reating physician (the investigator can refer to 
ASCO guidelines).  Study treatment should not be given to patients with neutrophil counts <1,500 
cells/mm3.  Deaths due to sepsis following severe neutropenia have been reported in patients treated 
with caba zitaxel.  Neutropenic complications should be managed promptly with antibiotic support.

[IP_ADDRESS] Specific to Cabazitaxel  
 
Concomitant Medications  
Avoid concomitant  strong CYP3A4 inhibitors during cabazitaxel treatment.  If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor 
must be co -administered, decrease cabazitaxel dose by 25%.  If co -administration of the strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor is discontinued, cabazitaxel should be returned to the dos e used prior to initiation of the strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor.  
Allergy (Anaphylactic and Hypersensitivity reactions)  
Hypersensitivity reactions that occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_119452] a few minutes 
of start of the first or of the second infusion of cabazitaxel. Therefore, during the 1st and the 2nd 
infusions, careful evaluation of general sense of well being and of blood pressure and heart rate will be 
performed for at least the first [ADDRESS_133263] reaction.  
 
Facilities and equipment for resuscitation along with the medications (i.e., antihistamine, 
corticosteroids, aminophylline, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) must be immediately available. If a reaction occurs, the 
specific treatment that can be medically indicated for a given symptom (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_119453], aminophylline in case of bronchospasm, etc) will be instituted. In addition, it is 
recommended to take the measures listed below : 
 
Mild : localized cutaneous reaction, such as:  Consider decreasing the rate of infusion until

(NIST) standardization update (agreed on 17 MAR 2015).  28 pruritus, flushing, rash.  recovery of symptoms, stay at bedside  
 Complete cabazitaxel infusion at the initial 
planned rate.  
Moderate: Generalized pruritus, more severe 
flushing or rash, mild dyspnea, hypotension with 
systolic B.P. >80 mmHg   Stop cabazitaxel infusion  
 Give IV diphenhydramine 50 mg and/or IV 
dexamethasone 10 mg  
 Once all signs and/or symptoms of 
hypersensitivity reaction disappear, 
cabazitaxel may be reinfuse d within 24 hours 
from the interruption, if medically appropriate, 
and whenever possible.  
 Re-administer premedication regimen when 
cabazitaxel is reinfused more than 3 hours 
after the interruptionAdminister cabazitaxel 
over 2 hours for all subsequent infus ions 
Severe: bronchospasm, generalized urticaria, 
hypotension with systolic B.P. ≤80 mmHg, 
angioedema.   Stop cabazitaxel infusion  
 Give IV diphenhydramine 50 mg and/or IV 
dexamethasone 10 mg  
 Add epi[INVESTIGATOR_119454]/or IV 
plasma expanders if indicated  
 Once all signs and/or symptoms of 
hypersensitivity reaction disappear, 
cabazitaxel may be reinfused within 24 hours 
from the interruption, if medically appropriate, 
and whenever possible  
 Re-administer premedication regimen when 
cabazitaxel is rei nfused more than 3 hours 
after the interruption  
 Administer cabazitaxel over 2 hours for all 
subsequent infusions  
 If a severe reaction recurs, patient will go off 
protocol therapy  
Anaphylaxis (Grade 4 reaction)   Withdraw treatment  
 
Nausea/Vomiting  
A prophylactic anti -emetic treatment should be given to the patients in all cycles. The use of 
metoclopramide is recommended. More aggressive anti -emetic prophylaxis (i.e., ondansetron, etc.) 
should be given to the patient who has experienced grade ≥3 nausea /vomiting in a preceding cycle. If 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_119455], grade ≥3 nausea/vomiting still occur, reduce the dose of 
cabazitaxel. If despi[INVESTIGATOR_119456], nausea/vomiting still occur at grade ≥3, the 
patient should be withdrawn  from treatment with cabazitaxel . 
 
Stomatitis  
If grade 3 stomatitis occurs, cabazitaxel should be withheld until resolution to grade ≤1. Treatment may 
then be resumed, but the dose of cabazitaxel should be reduced for all subsequent doses. In case of

(NIST) standardization update (agreed on 17 MAR 2015).  29 Hematuria  
An imbalance in the incidence of hematuria was observed in the Phase III study in second line mCRPC 
(EFC6193).  More hematuria was reported in cabazitaxel arm versus m itoxantrone arm (62 
patients/16.7% versus 14 patients/3.8%).  In cabazitaxel arm, no clear possible explanation such as local 
infection/obstruction/progression, or anticoagulation/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_119457], or thrombocytopenia was found 
for [ADDRESS_133267] cancer, a total of 6 patients 
(2 in the ARD6191 and 4 in the TCD6945) experienced cystitis without local infection including 5 
hemorrhagic cystitis (3 cystitis were documented with biopsy).  Therefore, in ca se of hematuria with no 
clear po ssible explanation every effort  should be undertaken to document the cause (e.g., urine 
cultures, urinary tract ultrasound, and if no cause identified cystoscopy with or without biopsy).  
 
Neurological toxicity  
Dose modification should be performed as follows:  
 Grade ≤1: No change  
 Grade 2: Retreat with reduced dose  
 Grade 3: Patient will be withdrawn from treatment with cabazitaxel  
 
Other Toxic Effects  
Any measures such as frozen gloves or socks or scalp cooling cap to prevent nail toxicity or alopecia are 
left to the investigator’s judgment.  
 
 
5.3.4 Enzalutamide  
For any grade 3 or higher adverse event  related to enzalutamide , enzalutamide should be withheld until 
symptoms improve to Grade 2 or lower toxicity.  A maximum  of 2 dosage reductions will be allowed.  
 
Adverse Event  Action  Further Action and/or Maintenance  
Any AE related to 
enzalutamide  ≥ 
Grade 3    Hold enzalutamide until symptoms 
improve to ≤ Grade 2 , then reinitiate 
at reduced dose of 120 mg daily.   If toxicity recurs, hold until symptoms 
improve to ≤ Grade 2, then reinitiate 
at 80 mg daily.  
 If toxicity recurs again, then 
discontinue enzalutamide.  
 
Concomitant use of strong CYP2C8 inhibitors should be avoided if possible.  If patients must be co -
admi nistered a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, reduce enzalutamide to [ADDRESS_133268] revised: 11/04/[ADDRESS_133269] been revised as per the [LOCATION_002] (US) National Institute of Standards and Technology

6. Follow Up, Laboratory Testing, and Diagnostic Imaging  
Clinic visits will be scheduled at the beginning of each treatment module, with blood samples taken for 
serum testing of CBC, comprehensive metabolic  panel, LDH , PSA, and testosterone panel during these 
visits.  During the first (abiraterone) treatment module, laboratory tests will be repeated every [ADDRESS_133278] 4 weeks, then every 4 weeks afterwards.  Follow up and treatment visits will be scheduled 
every 4 weeks.  During second (cabazitaxel and carboplatin) treatment module , follow up , laboratory 
tests,  and treatment visits will be scheduled every [ADDRESS_133279] (enzalutamide and radium -

the specimen, peripheral blood will be collected in Streck Cell -Free DNA blood collection tubes on the 
first da y of each new treatment module, and the first day of the post -treatment surveillance period .  If 
not, this tube will not be drawn, as these samples cannot be frozen and s tored for later analysis.  
 
During the post -treatment surveillance period, as long as disease progression has not yet been 
demonstrated, patients will adhere to every [ADDRESS_133283] revised: 11/04/[ADDRESS_133284] been revised as per the [LOCATION_002] (US) National Institute of Standards and Technology

6.1 Criteria for Discontinuation of Study Regimen  
The study regimen  may be discontinued for any of the following reasons:  
 Intolerable, recurrent, or sustained adverse effects of the study regimen despi[INVESTIGATOR_119458].  
 Noncompliance with study regimen or follow up appointments.  
 Patient choice to withdraw from trial.  
 Investigator or physician discretion . 
 
As defined by  [CONTACT_43877]2 guidelines , the earliest time  point  that PSA progression can be determined is at [ADDRESS_133290] time point for determination 
of radiographic progression is also at the end of each module (12 weeks) given trial design.  
 
The design of the treatment schedule is such that the treatment modality will be chang ed regardless of 
response observed.  For patients  whose disease are found to be progressing at the end of a treatment 
module  (12 weeks) , their treatment is already  planned to be transition ed to another agent , which is in 
line with standard of care  for dise ase progression , and would not constitute a need to discontinue the 
study regimen and withdraw from trial.  
 
Patients who do not complete all three treatment modules will be considered dropped out, and not 
included in the primary and secondary endpoint anal yses.  However, w henever possible, attempts will 
be made to collect overall survival data of patients that have discontinued the study regimen.  
 
7. Statistical Plan  
In this trial, all patients will be treated using the rapid -cycling non -cross reactive treatment model as 
detailed above.  Given that cycling therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217] a novel concept in prostate cancer  management , there 
are no similar trials or statistics available that  can be used for direct historical comparison.  The [ADDRESS_133291] received multiple different prostate cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , and will be actively surveyed on primary ADT 
alone  following completion of the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_119459] .  The AFFIRM placebo arm had a  median time 
to PSA progression of 3.0 months , and radiographic PFS of 2.9 months  [4].  However, though our 
patients will be treatment -experienced following the [ADDRESS_133292] revised: 11/04/[ADDRESS_133293] been revised as per the [LOCATION_002] (US) National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) standardization update (agreed on 17 MAR 2015).  35 resistance .  In the cohort of treatment -naïve mCRPC men receiving  placebo , median ti me to PSA 
progression was 2.8 months, and radiographic PFS 3.9 months [7]. 
 
As our composite primary endpoint utilizes the earliest evidence of PSA or radiographic progression to 
define disease progression, we believe that 3 months is a reasonable control.  
 
Another trial considered as a historical control is the ASCENT trial, whic h treated chemotherapy -naïve 
mCRPC patients  with intermittent docetaxel [45].  Of the  patients that met study criteria to receive a 
break from chemotherapy , the median duration of the first chemotherapy holiday was 18 weeks (4.5 
month s).  This figure is higher than 3  months , but did  not factor in pati ents who did not meet 
requi rements to go on d rug holiday.  This cohort also had no prior exposure or resistance to abiraterone 
or enzalutamide , which likely  factor s into the longer interval to progression.  This study still serves as a 
good internal check , to demonstrate that our 3 -month time to disease  progression is reasonably chosen.  
 
The median time to PSA progression in our cohort of patients will be estimated using a Cumulative 
Incidence Competing Risk (CICR) analysis with mortality f rom any cause considered a competing risk .  To 
test whether  the estimated median time to progression  is significantly greater than historical time to 
progression  of [ADDRESS_133294] will be used.  The maximum likelihood estimates of 
parameters, using ei ther the exponential or Weibull distribution, obtained from the observed data will 
be compared to  a median time to disease  progression  of 3 months  [46].  For a study with [ADDRESS_133295] patie nt’s entry, a sample size of 33 patients  
that complete all t hree treatment modules of the study regimen  will provide 90% power for a one -sided 
test at the 5% level to detect an increase in median time to disease  progression from 3 months to 5  
months  [47].  We will plan to screen  60 patients ( treat a total of 40 patients ) on study in order to 
account for any potential patient dropout, defined as anyone who does not complete all three 
treatment modules.  
 
In addition to the above, we will also perform an intention -to-treat analysis of all enrolled patients in 
order to account for any early progressions or deaths.  
  
Overall survival will be estimated using the method of Kaplan -Meier .  Comparison will be made wi th 
historical OS data from the PREVAIL and COU -AA-302 trials (32.4 and 34.7 months, respectively) [3, 7] 
where  treatment -naïve mCRPC patients received long term follow up during which they received 
multiple different  active therap ies. 
 
PSA response rates to the overall regimen and each individual treatment module will be evaluated 
independently and compared to historical controls  and presented as descriptive statistics .  From large 
phase III pre -chemotherapy studies, abiraterone an d enzalutamide have PSA response rates of 62% [3] 
and 78%  [7], respectively.  Past experience with regimens that include a taxane and a platinum agent, 
PSA response rates have ranged 69-88% [32, 33].  There  is limited data available for cabazitaxel  and 
carboplatin , but recently reported phase II trial of this combination demonstrated a 52% partial 
response rate as evaluated by [CONTACT_119487] [35].   
 
Since baseline PSA levels for treatment modu les [ADDRESS_133296] revised: 11/04/[ADDRESS_133297] been revised as per the [LOCATION_002] (US) National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) standardization update (agreed on 17 MAR 2015).  36 subsequent treatment module, argument can be made that th e patient is a r esponder to that module as 
well even if PSA declines of 50% are not attained.  
 
Changes to alkaline phosphatase levels will be tracked for each treatment module, the overall treatment 
regimen , and at time of disease progression .  While alkaline phosphatase  (ALP)  is not a well -studied 
endpoint in prostate cancer trials, its serum levels often correlate with bone metastas es status [48], and 
normalization of ALP levels  has been suggested  to predict better survival [49].  ALP levels will be 
compared to the upper limits of normal (ULN) for all laboratory testing performed in the study period 
and calculated as a ratio. ALP will be considered to be persistently abnor mal if the levels are 
continuously greater than a ratio of [ADDRESS_133298] one value with a 
ratio of 1 or less. Fine and Gray’s Competing Risk Regression (CRR) will be used to estimate a hazard 
ratio comparing the risk of  progression betweein patient groups with abnormal and normalized ALP 
levels while accounting for the presence of competing risks. This analysis will be performed to 
determine whethe r normalized ALP levels, correlates with time to disease progression.   
 
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, 
and clinical laboratory test data.  The number and percentage of patients with adverse events will be 
presented as descriptive statistics.  
The six-gene score s following each individual treatment module will be compared to baseline pre-
treatment scores using a paired  T-test.  Changes to the six gene score over sequential time points  will 
also be evaluated using linear mixed model .  Additionally, we will per form statistical analysis to 
determine whether the baseline six -gene scores can predict treatment response or whether the post -
treatment six -gene score is associated with clinical treatment outcomes, including PSA and radiographic 
response.  
The number and percentage of men  with AR-V7 positivity will be evaluate d at baseline , with the 
completion of each treatment module, and at follow up.   The prevalence of AR -V7 in treatment -naïve 
mCRPC patients remain the subject of further investigation, but we can assume  it to be approximately 
one third  [39].  We will track AR -V7 expression changes over the course of treatment.  We hypothesize 
that men who are either AR -V7 positive at baseline or develop it over the course of treatment, will have 
similar outcomes to AR -V7 negative men with the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] -cycling treatment regimen.  Fine and Gray’s 
Competing Risk Regression will be us ed to estimate a hazard ratio comparing t ime to disease 
progression between the two groups.  
8. Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
8.1 Electronic Data Capture (EDC) System  
 
All eCRFs will be entered directly into a web -based electronic research application portal known as 
REDCap . REDCap ’s role -based access control security and audit capability ensures that the research data 
is protected from unauthorized access, modification,  and exposure. Key features of this web -based 
database system include allowing access and data entry from multiple sites, with each site having a 
separate pool of data as necessary. All data stored in the REDCap  system is backed up daily. Detailed 
audit se rvices include any data field level changes, who made the changes, when the changes were 
made, the old value and the new value. Data from REDCap  can easily be extracted to excel or flat text 
file formats for easy import into SAS or other statistical softwa re packages.

(NIST) standardization update (agreed on 17 MAR 2015).  [ADDRESS_133300] been 
granted appropriate access to do so.  
 
 
8.4 Data Validation Process  
 
As part of the data validation process, edit check programs will be embedded in the database thru valid -
value, valid -range and missing value alerts specified for each field as necessary. Valid -value edit checks 
include:  
 
 Requiring the user to enter a coded value taken from a list that i s presented on the CRF. 
If a value not on the list is entered the user will be prompted to check the value and 
enter a value on the list.  
 Requiring the user to enter a value within a particular range of possible values for a 
continuous measure. If a value outside the range is entered the user will be prompted to 
check the value and re -enter.  
 
In addition to the univariate field alerts specified above, there will be multivariate alerts built into the 
database design:  
 Confirming that only valid options are selected in a ‘choose all that apply’ multiple 
choice field, where the range of options deemed valid depends on some other 
parameter.  
 Confirming that diastolic blood pressure reading is less than the associated systolic 
blood pressure reading.  
 Confirming t hat “other, specify” is completed when “other” is selected.  
 Confirming that eligibility criteria are met.  
 
As well as cross -module alerts such as:  
 Comparing the dates and times of all assessment time points to confirm that they 
occur in an appropriate sequ ence.

The EDC database is approved by [CONTACT_119488] u sing high -end servers 
located in the Secured Mount Sinai Data Center. All data stored in the REDCap  system is backed up daily. 
Access to the database is controlled by [CONTACT_119489]  [INVESTIGATOR_119460]. Quick 
view audit service allo ws authorized user to see who accessed records for view or edit and detailed 
audit services include seeing any data field level changes, who made the changes, when the changes 
were made, as well as the value before and after the change.  
 
8.7 Quality Contro l Procedures  
 
Comprehensive edit checks will be used to clean data. Patient data will be entered continuously. All 
changes to the data and the database structure will be recorded in an automatic audit trail. Random 
checks will be done by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_47343] d ata accuracy and completeness. A final database will be 
declared when all data has been entered, the data entry verified, the data validated and the database 
defined as clean. After declaration of a final database the data will be exported from REDCap  to excel for 
import to SAS and both the database and the SAS datasets will be locked and protected from changes. 
All statistical analyses for the final analysis will be performed on the locked SAS datasets.  
 
8.8 Medical and Adverse Event Coding  
 
Coding of Adv erse Events occurring during the study will be performed by [CONTACT_119490] (CTCAE) Version 4.0 while 
coding of concomitant medications, prior anti -cancer therapy and  further therapy will be performed 
according to the World Health Organization -Drug Dictionary Enhanced (WHO -DDE). These dictionaries 
contain the respective classifications of adverse events and drugs in proper classes. When dictionary 
entries and verbatim terms (either for adverse events for medications) do not directly match, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_119461]. In the event there are compound verbatim events (eithe r AEs or medications) listed 
in the CRF, such events must be split into more than one record for purposes of medical coding. The PI

8.[ADDRESS_133303] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a 
signed subject authorization informing the subject  of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorizat ion for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For 
subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain 
permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study 
period.

histories designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation (e.g. case 
report form) for the maximum period required by [CONTACT_119491], or Institution 
procedures.  
If a change in the PI [CONTACT_110534], the records shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., 
another Investigator, IRB).  
 
8.[ADDRESS_133306] Privacy  
Patients will be informed of the extent to which their confident ial health information generated from 
this study may be used for research purposes. Following this discussion, they will be asked to sign the 
HIPAA form and informed consent documents. The original signed document will become part of the 
patient’s medical records, and each patient will receive a copy of the signed document. The use and 
disclosure of protected health information will be limited to the individuals described in the informed 
consent document.  
 
It is the responsibility of the research staff to e nsure that protocol subjects received, understands, and 
signs the informed consent document before enrolling the patient onto this trial. Personnel must 
provide a HIPAA form and obtain acknowledgment before the subject participates in this study.  
All subje ct data will be identified by a subject identification number and subject initials only, to protect 
the subject’s privacy. The data will be blinded accordingly in all data analysis. However, in compliance 
with federal guidelines, the in vestigator will permit a representative from Mount Sinai Health System  
audit committee to review that portion of the subject’s medical record that is directly related to the 
study. This will include all relevant study documentation including medical histor ies to verify eligibility, 
laboratory test results to verify transcription accuracy, X -ray reports, admission/discharge summaries for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/outpatient admissions while the subject is on -study and autopsy reports for deaths occurring 
during the study. As  part of the required content of informed consent, the subject will be informed that 
his medical  record may be reviewed. Should access to the medical record require a separate waiver or 
authorization, it is the PI’s responsibility to obtain such permission  from the patient in writing before the 
subject is entered into the study.

4. Introduction  
4.1. Background and Rationale  
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been shown to be  a safe and effective treatment f or 
patients with  severe  aortic stenosis  who are at extreme, high, or intermediate surgical risk(1-3).  Since 
CoreValve ™ became commercially approved in the [LOCATION_002] by  [CONTACT_56270] D rug Administration 
(FDA)  in [ADDRESS_889428]  become increasingly efficient with reducing 
complications .  The Evolut ™ PRO valve’s outer pericardial wrap has shown to enhance annular sealing 
resulting in a decrease in paravalvular leak(4).  There is also a growing shift towards  optimizing the TAVR 
care pathway by [CONTACT_659462], peri, and post procedure assessments.  This optimization can further 
increase the efficiency of the procedure  and subsequently decrease the length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_659446](5,6).     
This procedural efficiency has not translated to a reduction in permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) 
rates.   Rates have decreased with newer  generation TAVR valves , however , variability continues(7).  There is 
a lack of consensus regarding the m anagement of post -TAVR conduction abnormalities leading towards  
heterogenous PPI [INVESTIGATOR_659447] s and potentially unnecessary  pacemakers  for abnormalities that 
could have resolved intrinsically over time(8,9).  Previous studies indicate most of  high degree 
atrioventricular block (HAVB) and left bundle branch block (LBBB) occur prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] , and 
early monitoring is key to identify ing and managing persistent TAVR -induced conduction abnormalities(10,11).   
The objective of this study is to collect o utcome data on valve performance  and a pre-specified TAVR care 
pathwa y.  A dditionally , this study will  protocolize  the management of  the post -TAVR conduction

associated with an “optimized” TAVR care pathway and using the Evolut PRO  device.  
5. Objectives and Endpoints  
5.1. Objectives  
5.1.1.  Primary Objective  
The primary objective  of this study is  to collect clinical evidence on valve performance and procedural 
outcomes associated with an “optimized” TAVR care pathway and using the Evolut PRO  device.  
5.2. Endpoints  
The following endpoints  will be used to evaluate the primary trial objec tives:  
5.2.1.  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the rate of all-cause mortality or  all-stroke at 30 days . 
5.2.2.  Secondary Endpoints  
The following  are the  secondary  endpoints:  
• Median days from index procedure to discharge  
• Percentage of subjects with ≥ moderate aortic regurgitation (AR) at discharge  
• Rate of pacemaker implant for new onset or worsening conduction disturbance at 30 days  
5.2.3.  Additional Exploratory Endpoints  
The following  are additional exploratory endpoints:  
• 30-day and 1 -year hospi[INVESTIGATOR_134577] -admission rates  
• 1-year composite of all-cause mortality  or all- stroke

 5.2.4.  Rationale  
The basis for the selection of these study endpoints include:  
• Clinically relevant outcomes of the Evolut PRO device  
• In accordance with objectively measuring the efficacy of an optimized care pathway for TAVR 
subjects  
• Objectively defined and measurable in the majority of subject s 
• Consistent with current recommendations for endpoints in  TAVR clinical studies(12)  
6. Study Design  
This is a post market, multi -center, p rospective,  non-randomized  study .  The study  methods include the 
following measures to minimize potential sources of bias:  
• An external, independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will review and adjudicate, at 
minimum, all deaths and endpoint related adverse events.  Safety endpoint results will be  based 
on CEC adjudications.  
• All sites will follow a standardized protocol for acquisition of echocardiographic endpoint data.  
• Core  labs will evaluate all echocardiograms  and ECGs .  Echocardiographic trial endpoint results 
will be based on Core Lab assessments.  
• Subjects will be screened to confirm eligibility for enrollment with pre -defined inclusion and 
exclusion criteria . 
6.1. Duration  
The enrollment period is estimated to be less than [ADDRESS_889430] inde x procedure ; therefore,  the estimated total duration of the study (first subject enrolled to last 
subject completing his/her last follow -up exam) is estimated to be less than 2 years.  
6.2. Trial Organization  
6.2.1  Participating  Sites  
This trial may be conducted at up to 46 sites in the [LOCATION_002]  and Canada .  Investigative sites will meet 
the following criteria:  
• The site will have extensive facility experience with TAVR.  Operator [ADDRESS_889431] meet 
the minimum of  ≥  20 TAVR  procedures in the prior year, or ≥ 40 TAVR procedures in the prior two 
years.  
• The site will  have the presence or capacity of establishing an investigative team consisting of the 
following:

[IP_ADDRESS]  Medtronic Evolut PRO  Transcatheter Aortic Valve  
The Evolut PRO  TAV is available in 3 sizes ( 23, 26 , 29 mm), covering an aortic annulus diameter of 18 to 26 
mm. For the 26mm and 29mm bioprotheses: If the patient’s annulus diameter is within 0. 5 mm of the 
upper or lower bound of the range, use of the larger valve size can be considered, provided additional 
dimensional criteria as outlined in the CIP are met.  The TAV is comprised of 3 leaflets , a sealing skirt , and 
outer tissue wrap constructed f rom glutaraldehyde -fixated porcine pericardium, sewn to a compressible 
and self -expandable  Nitinol support frame . The TAV is processed with an anti -mineralization treat ment of 
AOA , a compound derived from oleic acid, a naturally occurring long -chain fatty acid.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Medtronic EnVeo PRO Delivery Catheter System with EnVeo InLine 
Sheath  
The EnVeo PRO  DCS facilitates the placement of the  TAV within the annul us of the aortic valve. The 
catheter assembly is flexi ble and compatible with a 0.035 in (0. 889 mm) guidewire.  The distal (deployment) 
end of the system features an atraumatic, radiopaque catheter tip and a capsule that covers and maintains 
the bioprosthesis in a crimped position.  The capsule includes a distal flare to enable full recapture of th e 
bioprosthesis after partial deployment.  A stability layer is fixed at the handle and extends down the outside 
of the catheter shaft.  It provides a barrier between the retractable catheter and the introducer sheath and 
vessel walls, thus enabling the catheter to retract freely.  Updates to the system include redesign of the 
distal tip of the DCS.  
The EnVeo InLine Sheath  is assembled over the stability layer, which functions as a hemostatic introducer 
sheath and minimizes the access site size to the capsule  diameter.  The InLine  Sheath  for the [ADDRESS_889435] connects to the blue actuator.  The end of the handle 
features a tip -retrieval mechanism, which can be used to with draw the catheter tip to meet the capsule 
after the device has been fully deployed.

 The catheter packaging contains an integrated loading bath  and a removable tray with 3  rinsing bowls for 
loading and rinsing the bioprosthesis.  The integrated loading bath features a mirror, which aids in accurate 
placement of the bioprosthesis frame paddles during loading.  In addition, the device packaging is swiveled 
and secured to facilitate the bioprosthesis loading procedure.

 9.1.3  Implant Procedure (TAVR)  
Procedural aspects specific to the  Medtronic TAVR s ystem should be performed according to the 
Instructions for Use .  Concomitant procedures including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are not 
permitted to be completed during the index procedure.   
The valve deployment will be complet ed in accordance to the cusp overlap technique via procedural  
angiogram, and the standard procedures of the implanting physicians  and the TAVR clinical pathway 
protocol requirements noted below. This described TAVR clinical pathway should serve as a guide  for 
accelerated discharge.  Institutional clinical TAVR pathways can be followed as long as the modifications are 
consistent with an accelerated discharge.  
Pre- procedure: 
• Develop “early discharge plan” (including frailty, mental assessment, and home healt h if required) with 
multi -disciplinary team  along with opt imized screening checklist for first and / or second visit leading 
up to TAVR procedure .    
• Standardize room layout  – team composition in procedure room (planning with multi -disciplinary 
team).    
 
Peri-Procedure: 
• No pre -deployment balloon aortic valvuloplasty TAVR procedure unless medically necessary   
• No planned general anesthesia  
• Percutaneous and transfemoral femoral access only  
• No urinary catheter  
• Mini mize central lines : no Swan -Ganz catheterization  or internal jugular vein  unless for temporary 
transvenous pacing  
 
Post Procedure Recovery:  
• Complete [ADDRESS_889441] pre -existing RBBB:  
 Remove all remaining lines within 2 hours of TAVR procedure  
 Repeat [ADDRESS_889442] 
had pre -existing RBBB  
• Mobilize  within 4 - 6 hours of TAVR procedure  
• Minimal intensive care unit (ICU) utilization: consider post -anesthesia care unit (PACU) in place of ICU 
or transfer straight to stepdown floor or telemetry unit

9.1.9  Informed Consent  
Prior to enrolling in the trial, patients should be fully informed of the details of trial participation as 
required by [CONTACT_5279], the site’s IRB/REB and the Declaration of Helsinki.  Informed C onsent 
must be obtained from each patient prior to conducting any protocol -induced activities beyond standard of 
care, by [CONTACT_659468] (ICF) approved by [CONTACT_10867]’s IRB /REB and by [CONTACT_13735], Inc.  All 
Informed Consent Forms, including HIPAA forms and/or short form consents, must be approved by [CONTACT_13735], Inc. prior to use.  The ICF must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_659469] P RO Clinical Investigation Plan

 the consent.  Any additional persons required by [CONTACT_779]’s IRB /REB to sign the Informed Consent Forms 
must also comply.   
Prior to the patient signing the ICF, the investigator or authorized designee will fully explain to the patient 
the nature of the research, trial procedures, anticipated benefits, and potential risks of participation in the 
trial.  The investigator or delegate will allow adequate time for the patient to read and review the consent form and to ask questions.  Signing the ICF serves to document the written and verbal information that the 
investigator or authorized delegate provides to the patient, the patient’s understanding of the information, 
and his/her agreement to participate.  The investigator or authorized delegate must document in the patient’s medical records that the patient was consented and the date on which the consent was obtained.  
The original signed consent form will be retained in the patient’s trial records and a copy of the I nformed 
Consent  Form  will be provided to the patient.   
Patients should give written consent before undergoing any protocol -required testing.  However, if any of 
protocol -required baseline/screening evaluations (e.g. echocardiography, MDCT, coronary arteriography, 
lab work) have been performed for clinical diagnostic purposes prior to consenting, they can be used as the 
protocol -required exams, provided they were obtained within the protocol -required time windows and 
contain the necessary information.

 Version  3.[ADDRESS_889449]/subject ID relationship will 
be maintained by [CONTACT_21655].  Individual subject  medical information obtained as a result of this trial will 
be considered confidential.  
This trial will utilize an Oracle Clinical Remote Data Capture (RDC) system that is the property of Medtronic.  
Required data will be recorded on electronic case report forms (eCRFs) by [CONTACT_659470] (DTL) .  Trial personnel delegated for eCRF completion and/or approval 
per the DT L will be trained on the use of the R DC system and thereafter provided with a user name [CONTACT_659500].  The eCRFs must be completed and/ or updated to reflect the latest 
observations on the subjects participating in the trial.  The inves tigator (or approved sub -investigator) will 
electronically sign the appropriate pages of each eCRF.  
Data from the core lab will be entered into the Oracle Clinical RDC  system by [CONTACT_659471].  The core lab physician  will approve core lab eCRFs.  
The Oracle Clinical RDC  system maintains an audit trail of entries, changes, and  corrections in eCRFs.  If a 
person only authorized to complete eCRFs makes changes to an already signed eCRF, the investigator shall re-approve this eCRF.  
All trial- related documents must be retained until notified by [CONTACT_659472].  Medtronic  will inform the investigator/institution when these documents are no longer required 
to be re tained.  
No trial document or image should be destroyed without prior written agreement between Medtronic and 
the investigator.  Should the investigator wish to assign the trial  records to another party or move them to 
another location, advance written noti ce must be given to Medtronic .

on-line query resolution process per the Data Management plan. 
The eCRFs may not serve as source documents.  Source documentation for data elements not routinely 
captured in medical records (e.g. echocardiography variables, MDCT variables, cath eter and procedural 
data variables, Heart Team assess ment, Modified Rankin Score) may vary from center to center.  The site 
may use technical worksheets if identified as source documents.  
Source documents must be retained by [CONTACT_659473] a period of two years after trial conclusion 
(or longer as required by [CONTACT_1769]) and made available for monitoring or auditing by [CONTACT_456]’s 
representative or representatives of the FDA and other applicable regulatory agencies or IRB/ REB.   
The Investigator must ensure the availability of source documents from which the information on the eCRFs was derived.  Where printouts of electronic medical records are provided as original source documents, or 
where copi[INVESTIGATOR_659451], they should be signed and 
dated by a  member of the investigation site team indicating they are a true reproduction of the original 
source document.

A protocol deviation is to be completed for each trial protocol deviation, including, but are not limited to the following:  
• Failure to obtain Informed Consent prior to participation 
• Incorrect version of the Informed Consent form used 
• Failure to o btain IRB /REB approval before the start of the study  
• Implanted subject did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Enrollment of subjects during lapse of IRB /REB approval  
Investigators should ob tain prior approval from Medtronic before initiating any change or deviation from 
the CIP, except where necessary to protect the life or physical well -being of a subject in an emergency 
situation.  Such approval shall be documented in writing and maintained in the Investigator Site File.  Prior approval is generally not expected in situations where unforeseen circumstances are beyond the investigator’s control (e.g. subject did not attend scheduled follow -up visit).  
In addition, Investigators are required t o adhere to local IRB/ REB procedures for rep orting deviations.   
Medtronic is responsible for analyzing deviations, assessing their significance, and identifying any corrective and/or preventive actions that may be warranted.  Repetitive or serious investigator compliance issues may

 represent a need to initiate a corrective action plan, which may include suspension of enrollment or 
termination of the investigator’s or site’s participation in the study.  
9.[ADDRESS_889452] Withdrawal or Discontinuation  
Subjects who dis continue participation prematurely will be included in the analysis of results (as 
appropriate) and will not be replaced in the enrollment of total trial subjects.  If a subject is discontinued 
from the trial early, the reason for discontinuation should be  docume nted in the subject file and a Study 
Exit eCRF must be completed.   If discontinuation is because of safety concerns or lack of effectiveness, the 
subject shall be asked to be followed for collection of ongoing safety data outside the clinical invest igation.   
A subject will not be considered lost to follow- up unless all efforts to obtain compliance are unsuccessful.  
At a minimum, the effort to obtain follow -up information must include [ADDRESS_889453]’s last known address.  Should both telephone and mail efforts to contact [CONTACT_659474], the subject’s primary physician should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  Subjects will then be deemed lost to 
follow up.  All contact [CONTACT_1279] -up must be documented in both the subject’s medical 
records and on the trial eCRFs. 
If a subject discontinues the trial at any time, is withdrawn from the trial early, or completes all protocol 
required follow -up they should continue to be followed by [CONTACT_659475].  If, for any reason, this is not possible for a particular subject, or if a subject needs to change their follow -up site at any time point after conclusion of the trial, investigators 
should refer subjects to a local site with appropriate training and experience in managing patients with 
implanted aortic valves.

system in a routine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885] . 
10.3 Risk-Benefit Rationale  
10.3.1  Measures to Mitigate Risks in the Trial Subjects  
The following measures will be implemented to minimize risks to the trial subjects:  
• Implanting physicians will have considerable experience with TAV R 
• Study sites will have significant experience with TAV R 
• Patients will undergo thorough imaging assessment during their pre -implant workup  
• Patients will be rigorously followed over the course of the study  
10.3.2  Alternatives  
Presently, therapeutic alternatives for patients with the clinical indication targeted for the Medtronic TAVR System include the following:  
• Medical therapy  
• Balloon aortic valvuloplasty  
• Surgical aortic valve replacement  
• TAVR with a non -Medtronic system  
10.3.3  Results from the Risk Analysis and Justification for the Study  
TAVR is now established as a safe and effective treatment option for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who are at extreme, high, or intermediated r isk for surgical aortic valve replacement. The 
Medtronic CoreValve™ system, the Evolut R syste m, and the Evolut PRO system (referred jointly as 
Medtronic TAVR) has been in widespread use since receiving the CE Mark in 2007 , and there is now 
extensive published  experience demonstrating the Medtronic TAVR system is fulfilling its intended role with 
a favorable risk/benefit ratio.
(14-17) Rigorous clinical trials have establis hed its safety and effectiveness, with 
improved mortality and quality of life compared with medical therapy in extreme , high and intermediate 
risk patients. (1-4)  
There are risks to the subjects for participation in the trial, they are anticipated to be to the same as  risks 
provided in the IFU and  guideline compatible therapy outside of the context of the study ( i.e. TAVR o r SAVR 
in a commercial, non-study setting).

employed physicians) with expertise relevant to the trial.  This may include experience in the a reas of:  
• Cardiac surgery  
• Interventional cardiology  
• Neurology  
• Electrophysiology  
13. Statistical Design and Methods  
13.1 Analysis Populations 
13.1.1  Enrolled Population  
Within the enrolled  population the following analysis sets  are distinguished:  
• The as treated ( AT) set: The AT set consists of all enrolled subjects with an attempted TAVR implant 
procedure, defined as when the subject is brought into the procedure room and any of the following 
have occurred: anesthesia or conscious sedation administered, vascular line place d, TEE placed,  or any 
monitoring line placed.      Subjects will be analyzed according to their first atte mpted procedure.  
Enrolled subjects that do not receive an attempted TAVR implant are to be exited from the study.  
• The implanted set : The implanted set consists of all the AT subjects who are actually implanted with 
the TAV.  Subjects with an attempted implant that do not actually receive a TAV are to be exited from 
the study following discharge from the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Per protocol se t: The per protocol set consists of all implanted subjects who’s index procedure adhere 
to the TAVR care pathway as described in section 9.1.3 Implant Procedure TAV R (treated with conscious 
sedation, iliofemoral, no concomitant procedures, etc.)  
• Roll-in: Roll- ins subjects will not be analyzed with the AT, implanted, or per protocol set and will be 
analyzed separately using descriptive statistics.  
The primary analysis for the primary objective  and secondary  safety and effectiveness objectives  will use 
the as treated  set.   
13.[ADDRESS_889456] procedure.  
Roll- in subjects will not be included in the primary analysis; however, the data will be summarized 
separately with descriptive statistics.   
13.3.[ADDRESS_889457] will be performed.  
13.4 Sample Size  
The sample size for the AT  population is 400 subjects  and up to 46 sites in  the US and Canada . The sample 
size for the roll- in population is up to 1 38 subjects. Total combined sample size with all analysis populations 
is up to 5 38 subjects.  
This is not a hypothesis -driven study, therefore the sample size of up to 400 subjects was not determined 
by [CONTACT_659476].  With >25% of TAVR patients experiencing new conduction 
disturbances10, 400 patients will provide a sufficient sample (~100 patients) to evaluate the conduction 
disturbance management pa thway.  
13.5 Secondary  Endpoints  
The following are the secondary endpoints:  
• Median days from index procedure to discharge  
• Percentage of subjects with ≥ moderate aortic regurgitation (AR) at discharge  
• Rate of pacemaker implant for new onset or worsening conduction disturbance at 30 days  
13.6 Additional Exploratory  Endpoints  
The following are additional exploratory endpoints:  
• 30-day and 1 -year hospi[INVESTIGATOR_134577] -admission rates  
• 1-year composite of all- cause mortality  or all- stroke

 13.7 Missing Data  
Every effort will be undertaken to minimize missing data.  However, some missing data is inevitable, and 
the trial is designed with the expectation that there may be up to 6% of primary data missing at 12  months. 
The reasons for missing data will be described and evaluated for assessment of possible bias.  The 
distribution of prognostic factors between subjects  with data and those without dat a will be examined to 
evaluate any potential sources of bias.  
14. Ethics  and Regulat ory Compliance  
This study will be conducted in accordance to the Evolut PRO commercially approved IFU and therefore is 
not considered to be a high risk study.  An Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) is not required to be submitted to the FDA and a pre -approval submission is not required to be submitted to Health Canada, if 
appropriate.   
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol , GCP,  and ethical principles that have their 
origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Each site must fulfill all local regulatory requirements prior to enrolling 
subjects , as applicable . 
Participating  sites will be not be activated nor begin enrolling subjects until the required approval/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_659452]/ REB and regulatory agency has been obtained (as appropriate).   
This trial will be publicly registered prior to first enrollment in accordance with the [ADDRESS_889458] (FDAAA) and on http://clinicaltrials.gov
 (PL 110- 85, Section 810(a)).  
Prior to enrolling subjects, each investigation site’s IRB/ REB will be required to approve the current  CIP, the 
Informed Consent F orm, and any other written information to be provided to the subjects.  Study  sites 
must also utilize IRB /REB approved Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
Authorization , when applicable . 
IRB/REB approval of the clinical trial must be received in the form of a letter and provided to Medtronic  
before commencement of the trial at an investigation site.  The approval letter must contain enough 
information to identify the version or date of the documen ts approved.  IRB/REB roster or letter of 
compliance  needs to be provided to allow verification that the investigator, other center trial staff, and/or 
Medtronic  personnel are not members of the IRB /REB. If they are members of the IRB /REB, written 
document ation is required stating that he/she did not participate in the approval process.  Investigators 
must inform Medtronic  of any change in status of IRB /REB approval once the investigation site has started 
enrollment.  If any action is taken by [CONTACT_2717]/ REB with respect to the study , that information will be 
forwarded to Medtronic  by [CONTACT_231005].

verification will occur via a risk -based approach as outlined in the  Monitoring Plan. 
The progress of the trial  will be monitored by:  
• On-site review, as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_13735]  
• Telephone communications between the site personnel (e.g., investigator, trial coordinator) and trial 
monitors  
• Review of eCRF s and the associated clinical records  
• Review of regulatory document s 
 
Upon study completion, Site Closeout Visits will be conducted as outlined in the Monitoring Plan  
Monitoring and monitoring oversight will be prov ided by [CONTACT_13735]  
.  Representatives of Medtronic  (i.e. contractors and designees) may also act as  trial monitors.  
Prior to the first site activation a monitoring plan will be established outlining the above activities, as well as  
trial materials to be supplied to sites, the process for corrective and preventive actions and Investigator 
disqualification proc edures .  
15.2.  Data Management  
Medtronic will be responsible for the processing and quality control of the data.  Data review, datab ase 
cleaning and issuing and resolving data queries will be done according to Medtronic  internal SOPs and the 
Data Management Plan for this trial.   The trial database will be developed and validated per the Data 
Management Plan for this trial and  will employ validation programs (e.g. range and logic checks) on entered 
data to identify possible data entry errors and to facilitate data validation.  The trial database will maintain an audit trail of all changes made to the eCRFs.   
Refer to Recording Data section for further information regarding data collection and management 
procedures.  

Optimize P RO Clinical Investigation Plan  
  
 Version  3.[ADDRESS_889460] Access to Source Data/Documents  
Medtronic  may conduct audits at participating clinical sites.  The purpose of an audit is to verify the 
performance of the monitoring process and the trial conduct, independent of the personnel directly 
involved in the trial.   
The investigator and/or institution shall permit Medtronic , regulatory bo dies, and IRB/ REB direct access to 
source data and documents.  
15.4.  Confidentiality  
All information and data sent to parties involved in trial conduct concerning subject s or their participation 
in this trial will be considered confidential.  Trial sites will assign a unique subject ID number (SID) to each 
subject.  Records of the subject/SID relationship will be maintained by [CONTACT_21655].  The SID  is to be 
recorded on all trial documents to link them to th e subject’s medical records at the site .  To maintain 
confidentiality, the subjects’ name [CONTACT_659501] I nformed Consent Form.  In the event a subject’s name [CONTACT_659502] y reason, 
it will be masked  as applicable.  In the event of inability to mask  the identification (e.g., digital media), it will 
be handled in a confidential manner by [CONTACT_92999].  
15.5.  Liability 
Medtronic, Inc (including all wholly owned subsidiaries) maintains appropriate clinical trial liability 
insurance coverage as required under applicable laws and regulations and will comply with applicable law 
and custom concerning specific insurance coverage.  If required, a Clinical Trial Insuranc e 
statement/certificate will be provided to the IRB /REB if required.  
15.6.  CIP Amendments  
The investigator may  propose any appropriate modification(s) of the CIP.  Medtronic  will review this 
proposal and decide whether the modification(s) will be implemented.  
Medtronic  will submit any significant amendment to the CIP , including a justification for the  amendment to 
the investigators to obtain approval from their IRB /REB.  The investigator will only implement the 
amendment after approval of the IRB /REB, and Medtron ic.  Administrative amendments to  the CIP  will be 
submitted to the IRB /REB for notification.  Furthermore , investigators shall sign any approved amendment 
for agreement.

reporting the primary results will be prepared by [CONTACT_5844] (in collaboration with others including but not limited to the echo core lab physicians, and the CEC ).  A multisite publication will similarly 
be prepa red for publication in a reputable scientific journal.  The publication of the principal results from 
any single site experience within the trial is not allowed until both the preparation and publication of the 
multisite results, and then only with written  perm ission from Medtronic.  
Following analysis and presentation of the endpoint results, active participation of all participating investigators, CEC committee members, and core laboratory personnel will be solicited for data analysis 
and abstract and manu script preparation.  Submission of all abstracts and publications regarding the 
primary endpoint and secondary endpoints from the trial requires approval by [CONTACT_659477].  
A separate Publication P lan will provide detailed information about the publication committee, authorship, 
publication proposals, and requests for data.  
15.9.  Suspension or Early Termination  
15.9.1  Suspension or Early Termination of the Trial  
If the trial is terminated prematurely or suspended, Medtronic shall promptly inform the clinical 
investigators of the termination or suspension and the reason(s) for this.  The investigator shall then promptly inform the reviewing IRB/ REB.  Medtronic will, as soon as possible, provide a written statement to  
the investigators to enable prompt notification of the IRB/ REB.  If trial enrollment is terminated early, 
follow -up visits will continue for all enrolled subjects.  
15.9.2  Suspension or Early Termination  of a Trial Site  
Medtronic may decide to suspend or prematur ely terminate an investigation site (e.g. in case of expi[INVESTIGATOR_659453]/ REB, non -compliance to the CIP, or lack of enrollment).  If an investigation

o Removed reference to subjects with pre -existing 
pacemakers.   
o Added statement: Subjects with pre -existing 
conduction disturbances (eg  RBBB) or new 
conduction disturbances may be discharged prior to the recommended timeframes with continuous ECG monitoring. Pacing wires may be removed prior to recommended  timeframe and telemetry may be 
discontinued prior to the recommended timeframe to allow for early discharge.  
o Revised instruction for the following cohorts:  
 ECG changes ([ADDRESS_889462] op QRS remains > 150 ms, PR remains > 240 ms, or further increase of ≥  [ADDRESS_889463] -op ECG) and  
 New LBBB ([ADDRESS_889464] op continuing QRS > 150 ms or PR > 240 ms): 
 Revised instruction : consider EP study to 
further evaluate if the subject should be implanted with a permanent pacemaker or discharge with continuous ECG monitoring 
system until 30 -day follow -up visit.  
• Endpoint Definitions: Cl arified valve thrombus found at 
autopsy in a subject whose cause of death was not valve -
related or found at operation for an unrelated indication 
should not be reported as valve thrombosis.

19.3.5  Acquisition of K ey Variables  
[IP_ADDRESS]  LVOT Diameter  
Pre-implant LVOT diameter is measured from the inner edge to inner edge of the septal endocardium, and 
the anterior mitral leaflet in mid- systole (Figure 2 A and B).(19,20) . Following implantation of the TAV , LVOT 
diameter is measured from the parasternal long- axis view, immediately proximal to the inflow aspect of the 
stent, and in mid systole ( Figure 2 C and  D)(19-21) Post- surgical valve implantation, LVOT diameter is 
measured from the junction of the anterior sewing ring and the ventricular septum to the junction of the sewing ring and the anterior mitral valve leaflet  (Figure 2 E and F).

Figure 2 (A) and (B) Examples of measurement of pre -implant LVOT diameter. LVOT diameter is measured from the 
white- black interface of the septal endocardium to the anterior mitral leaflet, parallel to the aortic valve plane, 
approximately 0.5 cm below the level of the aortic annulus, and in mid systole  (C) and (D) Post  TAV implantation, LVOT 
diameter measurement is from outer edge to outer edge of the inflow aspect of the stent  (E) and (F) post surgical 
valve implantation, LVOT diameter is measured from the junction of the anterior sewing ring and the ventricular 
septum  to the junction of the sewing ring and the anterior mitral valve leaflet.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  LVOT Velocity  
LVOT velocity is recorded with PW Doppler from the api[INVESTIGATOR_659458], in either the api[INVESTIGATOR_153506] -axis view or in 
the anteriorly angulated  four-chamber view (or “5 -chambe r view”).  For pre -implant exams, the PW sample

acceleration  (usually 0.5 to 1.0 cm proximal to the cusps , Figure 3).(19) 
Post TAV implantation, the sample volume should be placed proximal to the inflow aspect of the stent.(22) 
Full-screen imaging of the TAV should be used to verify positioning of the sample volume below the stent 
before switching to spectral Doppler mode ( Figure 3 C and D).(22,23) 
The LVOT VTI is measured by [CONTACT_659483] (middle of the dense signal) for use in the 
continuity equation.(19)

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Aortic Valve Velocities  
Aortic valve velocity should be  interrogated with  CW Doppler from a minimum of 2  transducer positions 
(api[INVESTIGATOR_659459] a parasternal or suprasternal position).  The position that provides the highest velocity is 
used for measurements.  A smooth velocity curve with a clear outer edge and maximal velocity should be 
recorded.  The maximal velocity is measured at the outer edge of the dark signal; fine linear signals at the 
peak should not be included in measurements.  The outer edge of the dark “envelope” of the velocity curve 
is traced to provide both the VTI  for the continuity equation and the mean gradient ( Figure 4).(19)

and VTI, and measurement of max velocity.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Prosthetic Aortic Regurgitation  
An integrated exam approach using color flow, pulsed -wave (PW), and continuous -wave (CW) Doppler is 
used to assess the severity of transvalvular and paravalvular aortic regurgitation (AR).  Color flow D oppler 
imaging should be performed from the parasternal long and short -axis views, and the api[INVESTIGATOR_153506]- axis 
and/or 5 -chamber views.  In the short axis view, color imaging should be performed at multiple levels (from 
level of the leaflets to below the skirt and frame to assess paravalvular regurgitation, and at the coaptation 
point of the leaflets for transvalvular (central) regurgitation.(24,25) 
If AR is seen by [CONTACT_659478], a CW Doppler recording of the regurgitant signal should be obtained for 
measurement of pressure half- time and assessment of jet density. If the degree of AR by [CONTACT_659484], the velocity in the proximal descending aorta should be 
recorded with PW Doppler.

 The degree of transvalvular, paravalvular, and total (transvalvular plus paravalvular) AR will be graded as 
none, trace, mild, mild to moderate, moderate, moderate to severe, and severe based on the synthesis of 
the Doppler parameters shown in Table 5.(25) The category of  “trace” should be used in cases where 
regurgitation  is barely detectable by [CONTACT_659478].  Regurgitant signals observed to originate within the 
stent will be considered transvalvular, and regurgitant signals observed to originate outside the stent will be considered paravalvular.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Left Ventricular Function and Left Atrial Size  
Dimensions of the left ventricle and left atrium should be obtained by [CONTACT_5640] 2 -D linear measurements 
or using 2 -D guided m -mode from either the parasternal long or short axis views ( Figure 5). Left 
ventricular c hamber dimensions , septal thickness, and posterior wall thickness  are measured using the 
American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) measurement convention(27) (blood -tissue interface ). In 
addition, standard 2 -D views of the left ventricle should be obtained from parasternal and api[INVESTIGATOR_659460]’s rule, and for assessment of regional wall motion.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function 
A spectral Doppler recording of mitral inflow should be obtained with PW Doppler in the api[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 4 -
chamber view, using a 1 to 3 mm sample volume placed between the mitral leaflet tips during diastole (Figure 6). The spectral gain and wall filter settings should be optimized to clearly display the onset and 
cessation of left ventricular inflow. The following variables should be measured:  
• Mitral infl ow “A” velocity  
• Mitral inflow “E” velocity  
• Mitral inflow E -wave deceleration time

 Mitral annular velocities should be obtained from the lateral and septal aspects o f the mitral annulus 
using PW tissue Doppler (DTI) performed in the api[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 4 -chamber view. The sample volume should be 
positioned at or 1 cm within the septal and lateral insertion sites of the mitral leaflets and adjusted as 
necessary (usually 5 to 10 mm)  to cover the longitudinal excursion of the mitral annulus in both systole 
and diastole. Minimal angulation (<20 degrees) should be present between the ultrasound beam and the plane of cardiac motion. The following variables should be measured: 
• Mitral annular tissue Doppler systolic velocity (septal and lateral)  
• Mitral annular tissue Doppler early diastolic velocity (septal and lateral)  
• Mitral annular tissue Doppler late diastolic velocity (septal and lateral)

Qualitative grading of valvular regurgitation will be performed using the criteria described in Sections 
[IP_ADDRESS]  through [IP_ADDRESS]. For reporting the degree of prosthetic regurgitation, the grading classes may 
be collapsed according to the 3 -class grading scheme recommended by [CONTACT_659488] (ASE) -European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging Guidelines . (26,29)

[IP_ADDRESS]  Required aortic root measurements  
The following measurements of the aortic root are obtained for assessing anatomical suitability:  
• Aortic valv e annulus perimeter (measured at systole if retrospective gating is used)  
• Mean sinus of Valsalva diameter (measured at diastole)  
• Mean sinus of Valsalva heights (measured at diastole)  
 
Reformatting of Images (21)  
• Site image cross -hairs on aortic root in all windows where it is visible.  Lock cross- hairs so 
they  remain orthogonal for all steps.  
• In the coronal window, rotate cross -hairs (horizontal line) counter -clockwise to align with 
virtual  basal plane, ( Figure 7., upper left panel).  
• In the sagittal window, the horizontal line is rotated clockwise or counter -clockwise to align 
with  virtual  basal plane ( Figure 7, lower left panel).  
• On the newly defined double -oblique axial image, scroll up and down through the aortic 
root  until the most caudal attachment points of the three native leaflets come into vie w 
(indicated by  [CONTACT_659490] 8).  If one of the leaflets comes into view at a more 
cranial or caudal slice,  adjust the coronal or sagittal cross -hairs until all three leaflets come 
into view on the same axial slice.  
• For confirmation of the correct aortic annulus plane, scroll through the double oblique axial 
images starting in the mid sinus and ending at the level of the aortic annulus.  The sinuses 
should  appear to  be relatively the same size at the level of the mid -sinus and the leaflets 
should all  disappear equally at the level of the annulus.

attachment of three leaflets of the aortic valve).  
 
Aortic annulus measurements  
• Choose the cleanest systolic images for the aortic annulus measurements, either 
automatically  (e.g., best systolic) or by [CONTACT_659491].  Measurement on a diastolic 
image is also  acceptable.  
• Aortic annulus measurements should be completed on the properly reformatted double -
oblique  axial image at aortic annulus level . 
• Trace the perimeter of the basal annulus ( Figure 9, left). Place cross -hairs at site of basal 
annulus,  create major diameter through the site, create minor diameter defined as 
perpendicular to major and through site ( Figure 9, right).

Sinus of Valsalva measurement s 
Choose the best diastolic images for measurement of sinus of Valsalva diameters and heights from  
images using the same reformatting technique as described in section “Reformatting of  Images.”  
Sinus of Valsalva diameters  
• Select the double oblique axial image where the  widest portion of the three sinuses is visible.  
• Measure a diameter from each commissure through the site of the root to the opposite 
sinus. Complete for all three sinuses ( Figure 10).

Figure 20.  Example of sinus of Valsalva diameters  
 
Sinus of Valsalva heights  
• The sinotubular junction is typi[INVESTIGATOR_659461] -planar with the aortic annulus. Therefore, a 
sinus of  Valsalva height must be measured for each  of the three sinuses. This height is 
defined as the  distance between the aortic annular plane and the tallest point  in the sinus.  
• Choose the double oblique axial image so that it is located at the level of the aortic annulus. 
The reformatting line representing the double oblique axial image should now be visible in 
the oblique coronal and oblique sagittal images at the  level of the aortic annulus.  
• For the left coronary and non- coronary  heights, use the oblique coronal image. For the 
right  coronary height,  use the oblique sagittal image.  
• To complete the measurement, scroll through the oblique coronal or sagittal image (depending  on which sinus you are measuring) and locate the heights location of the 
sinotubular junction.  On that image, measure the distance along the path of the aortic 
root from the aortic annular  plane, marked by [CONTACT_659492], to the sinotubular  
junction (Figure 1 1).

1. Background  Information and Rationale  
 
1.1 Introduction 
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_523908] a common problem among adolescents and young adults. It affects 26 per 
100,000 people with an incidence of 1.1%.1,5 It is characterized by [CONTACT_523973][INVESTIGATOR_523909] (the area between  the buttocks  and posterior to the anus) . Entrapped hair follicles 
become infected resulting in acute and chronic wounds and draining sinuses that can incur both 
short term and long term morbidity, disability, and poor quality of life .[ADDRESS_679800] often seen 
initial presentation is that of a painful mass in the sacrococcygeal region.7 Initial treatment is 
usually with antibiotics and/or surgical incision and drainage of the inflamed and often infected 
cystic cavity. Recurren ce rates have been conservatively reported at 16 % and as high as  30% in 
some patient populations .2,3 
 
The morbidity of this disease is very significant. Patients, usually in their adolescence and young adulthood, may endure chronic pain/inflammation, drainage of sinus tracts associated with significant odor, and occasional negative -pressure wound VAC dressings which are 
cumbersome. When disease is active, these patients must lay prone at all times when attempting to sleep and are unable to sit due to their wounds; patients with recurrent disease report losing months to years of school and work obligations related to the treatment and chronic nature of their wounds as well as the emotional toll related to an embarrassing problem in a sensitive body area. This  disease remains a source of frustration for patients and their families; they desire a 
durable treatment.  
 For patients with recurrent disease, t here are both medical and surgical methods to treat and/or 
palliate pi[INVESTIGATOR_523910]. Each of these methods i ncurs a different risk -benefit profile  and has 
been associated with significant morbidity .  Overall , surgical  methods appear  to be more durable 
with long term success rates ranging from 84 to 89% However, surgical excision and reconstruction of this area c an be associated with significant morbidity and cost. Recurrence 
rates of pi[INVESTIGATOR_523911] 11%, respectively.
2,[ADDRESS_679801] been reported to be as high as 30 %.
[ADDRESS_679802] line  therapy.  The 
goal of this study  is to : 1) assess the safety  and patient tolerance of laser depi[INVESTIGATOR_523912] a 
single arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and 2 ) determine  the efficacy of this treatment in a  single center 
2/1/[ADDRESS_679803] of care in pediatric  patients 
with pi[INVESTIGATOR_523910] . 
 
1.2 Relevant Literature and Data  
 
Surgical Management of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_523913]:  Studies related to the surgical management of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_523914]. Over one hundred studies in the literature have reported various methods for managing this disease, but with inconsistent methodology and consistently unsatisfactory outcomes. The ideal operation for pi[INVESTIGATOR_523915], minimize recurrence, and carry low 
morbidity and disability . Incision and drainage has been the primary treatment in cases of acute 
presentation. After  incision and drainage overall successful healing has been reported to be 
approximately 60%, whereas the remaining patients required an additional excision procedure before closure of these wounds. For patients with recurrent disease, wide local excision with 
primary or secondary closure , with consideration of off -midline closure, has been widely 
advocated. However, wide local excision in this body region is associated with significant 
morbidity including a post -operative wound complication rat e of 30% . Marsupi[INVESTIGATOR_523916], limited tissue trauma, and shorter recovery.
8 However, reported duration of 
healing and durability has been variable.  
 
Medical Management of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_523913]:  Standard  medical management of pi[INVESTIGATOR_523917] s hair depi[INVESTIGATOR_523918] .  
 Phenol  solutions have also been tried in an attempt to sclerose sinus tracts. This  involves one or 
more injections into the affected ch ronic sinus tract s until filled, removal of sinus hairs and 
debris with forceps, as well as local shaving. Small er prospective series  have demonstrated 
success rates ranging from 60% to 95%.
9-[ADDRESS_679804] shown low subsequent 
recurrence rates (0% –11%) at extended follow -up.[ADDRESS_679805] yielded variable 
results  with limited long term efficacy.  
 Laser Depi[INVESTIGATOR_523919]: In several retrospective studies and small prospective 
studies, laser hair remova l has shown promise as an adjunct therapy to decrease recurrent 
infections and decrease the need for repeat surgery in adults and older adolescents. Lukish et al 
published a retrospective review of twenty -eight teenage patients with pi[INVESTIGATOR_523920]. Laser depi[INVESTIGATOR_523921] a mean follow up of 24 months.
4 Landa et al determined that their series of 6 patients with recurrent pi[INVESTIGATOR_523910] 
2/1/[ADDRESS_679806] 
with laser depi[INVESTIGATOR_523922]. However, t here remains a paucity of 
prospective controlled studies related to this treatment modality  with minimal data reported on 
the effectiveness of laser dep ilation in children with pi[INVESTIGATOR_523910] . A prospective study of 
laser hair removal in pediatric patients to assess safety and generate estimates of effectiveness  is 
warranted .15-17  
 
2. Study Objectives  
 
2.1 Primary Objective  
 
This is a two -phase study : 
(1) Phase One:  Determine the safety and tolerance of laser hair depi[INVESTIGATOR_523923] .  
(2) Phase Two:  Perform a randomized controlled trial of laser hair depi[INVESTIGATOR_344] + 
chemical/mechanical depi[INVESTIGATOR_523924] /mechanical  depi[INVESTIGATOR_523925]. Recurrence is defined as a new development of pi[INVESTIGATOR_523926], folliculitis, or draining sinus after treatment which would require antibiotic 
treatment, additional  surgical incision and drainage or excision.  
 
2.2 Secondary Objective  
 
The secondary objective is to compare adverse outcomes , length of stay, days to return to school  
or work , costs of care and quality of life measures  between those  that receive laser hair 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_523927]/chemical hair depi[INVESTIGATOR_523928] . 
 
3. Investigational Plan  
 
3.1 Study Design  
 
This is a prospective, randomized single -site trial measur ing the safety  and feasibility of treating 
children ( 12-20 years old) wit h pi[INVESTIGATOR_523929]. There will be two 
cohorts; those who receive laser hair depi[INVESTIGATOR_523930] /mechanical depi[INVESTIGATOR_344].  There will be two phases: Phase One – Pi[INVESTIGATOR_523931] – Randomized control trial to determine efficacy as a 
treatment of pi[INVESTIGATOR_523932] a possible treatment to intervene on future recurrence.

4. Study Procedures  
 
Screening  and Enrollment  
 
During initial contact [CONTACT_4490] a potential subjec t, a physician -member of the surgical c linic team  
will assess their eligibility through satisfaction of both inclusion and exclusion criteria. If all eligibility criteria are met, a  physician -member of the research team  will invite the child and 
legal guar dian to enroll. The physician -member of the research team  will then review the written 
information about the study and answer any questions.   Upon enrollment, study staff will be contact[CONTACT_523974] -member of the research team 
who obtained consent/ assent. The study staff will then conduct all data collection throughout the 
study.  
 
Study Procedures: Laser Hair Depi[INVESTIGATOR_523935]: Once randomized to the laser depi[INVESTIGATOR_523936], patients  will be brought into 
Surgery clinic for [ADDRESS_679808] of a n 810 nm (for Fitzpatrick skin types I -IV) or Nd:YAG (for Fitzpatric skin 
types V -VI) [ADDRESS_679809] treatment visit and confirmed by [CONTACT_523975] . A cooling platform and application of 23% lidocaine cream applied 
45 minutes from the treatment will minimize  any discomfort as sociated with the heat of the 
laser treatments.  
 Control group: They will also arrive at the surgery clinic  to have this body area shaved  and 
will receive an application of 23% lidocaine cream applied 45 minutes before  their simulated 
laser  treatment. They  will then receive a simulated laser treatment  in which the laser is 
maneuvered as usual but not actually fire d. This will allow patients  to be blinded to their 
treatment . If at the end of the trial, laser depi[INVESTIGATOR_523937], patients 
randomized to placebo will be offered laser therapy at the conclusion of the trial at no charge.  
 
 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_523907]:  
Application of 23% lidocaine cream applied approximately 45 minutes prior to  the laser 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_523938]. This will aid in the subsequent tolerance of the laser  treatment .  
 
Laser Depi[INVESTIGATOR_344]: The two lasers that wi ll be used in this study ( 810 nm or Nd:YAG ) are both 
FDA approved for hair removal in all areas of the human body including the back. T hese lasers 
are being used for hair removal in the back region for which they have FDA approval; however 
2/1/[ADDRESS_679810] specific approval for pi[INVESTIGATOR_523910]. In discussion with Chris Shilling, 
Director of the Drug and Device Development Services at the RINCH, we believe that an IDE is 
not neces sary for this study as we are using an approved device for investigational purposes with 
non-significant risk. Laser use in this study poses minimal risk to the patient and these minimal 
risks are similar to the risks associated with hair removal in the ba ck and other regions of the 
body for which devices are already FDA approved.        
Follow -Up: 
Initial follow up for the laser depi[INVESTIGATOR_523939]. This  will occur via use of a R EDCap database system where patients can 
report their pain every 6 hours (with the exception of the overnight period from 8pm -8am) 
for the first 48 hours after their laser hair depi[INVESTIGATOR_523940].  Text message reminders  will 
be sent  to these patients for them to give us  their pain scores. For those with smart phones, 
we can text them the link to their REDCap survey, and for those without smart phones or without consistent access to the interne , we can receive their pain scores via return text 
messages from them.  Once tol erance is established, patients will return to surgical clinic 
every month for their laser or placebo visit. After the 5
th clinic visit, they will receive a 
telephone call  monthly t o assess for any evidence of resolution or recurrence of disease up to  
1 year after t he completion of the treatments.  
 
5. Statistical Considerations  
 
5.1. Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
Primary endpoints would be the tolerance of the laser depi[INVESTIGATOR_523941] a pain score consistently <[ADDRESS_679811] week after each treatment. Secondary endpoints include  clinical improvement of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_523942]. For Phase Two, the primary endpoint will be the rate of 
recurrent pi[INVESTIGATOR_523943] 1 year.  
 
5.2. Statistical Methods  
 
The means/medians and standard deviations/interquartile ranges of the prognostic variables will 
be evaluated in the total study sample and will be compared between groups  (in the phase 2 
study) using t -tests or Mann Whitney U tests for continuous variables and chi -squared tests for 
categorical  variables. For the  primary outcome of recurrence within one year , we will calculate 
this proportion and its 95%  confidence, based on the exact binomial distribution, in the laser hair 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_523944] (in the phase 1 study), and we will calculate this proportion and its 95%  
confidence in both treatment groups (in the phase 2 study) and compare this proportion between groups using a Fisher exact test . SAS version 9.3 (Car y, NC) and Stata version 12 (College 
Station, TX) will be used in the  statistical analyses.  
 
5.3. Sample Size and Power  
We anticipate a group of 10 patients to measure laser depi[INVESTIGATOR_523945]. If tolerance is good 
(>95% the phase 1 patients pain scores < 4  with no deep second degree burns ), we will proceed 
to the phase 2 study . The sample size for phase 2 will be 164 patients. Since the predicted 
recurrence rate in the control group based on previous studies may  be 20% and in the laser group 
2/1/2016 11 
 
will be 5%, we would need [ADDRESS_679812]. 
 
6. Study Administration 
Phase One: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]  
 
6.1. Data Collection and Management  
Patient data such as age, gen der, skin type, length of disease, past medical/surgical history, 
number/date of treatments, treatment parameters, patient pain scores after laser treatments and 
within the first 12 hours after treatment, and any subsequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_523946]/drainag e. 
This information will be kept by [CONTACT_523976].   
6.2. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
 
6.2.1. Risk Assessment  
Patients will be evaluated for their skin type to ensure adequate treatment across the categori es. 
 
Laser Depi[INVESTIGATOR_523947]:  
• No relief of symptoms  
• Recurrence of pi[INVESTIGATOR_523948]  
• Photosensitivity or discomfort from laser treatments  
• Lastly, loss of confidentiality could be a risk.  
 
No Laser Depi[INVESTIGATOR_523944] 
• Loss of confidentiality could be a risk.  
 
6.2.2. Potential Benefits of Trial Participation  
 
 Laser Depi[INVESTIGATOR_523949]: • Faster relief of symptoms (ex: resolution of pain , erythema)  
• Avoiding surgery altogether  
o No risk of surgical complications  
• Possible decrease in folliculitis or recurrence  
 
No Laser Depi[INVESTIGATOR_523950]  
• Possible decrease in folliculitis or recurrence due to better hair removal from multiple 
clinic visits  
 
6.2.3. Risk- Benefit Assessment /Risk Minimization  
 
 Laser Depi[INVESTIGATOR_523950]  
2/1/[ADDRESS_679813] 48 
hours of the laser hair depi[INVESTIGATOR_523938] . Treatments will stop at any point in which 
the patient reports enough discomfort  to terminate therapy . Areas treated will be observed 
for cutaneous changes including excessive erythema, discoloration, or tenderness. Data will be monitored by [CONTACT_523977] . They will ensure that all data (clinical  
data and questionnaires) collected are correctly completed . Any suggestion of an adverse 
event identified by [CONTACT_523978] [INVESTIGATOR_97318].   
 
 
6.2.5. Adverse events (AE) and Serious adverse ev ents (SAEs)  
Any adverse events such as an inability to tolerate the laser therapy  or a recurrence will 
be tracked. Since recurrence is an expected adverse event it will not be reported; however 
it will be monitored and if we detect an increased rate of recurrence with laser therapy, this will be reported and the trial will be stopped. Mild to moderate pain (pain score 7 or lower) secondary to laser therapy is also consider an expected adverse event and will not be reported. SAE s due to laser treatment inclu de severe pain (pain score 8 or higher) and 
deep second degree burns .  
  It is also possible that AE might occur that are not directly related to the study.  As such, all AE  will be classified as not related (clearly unrelated to study participation), poss ibly 
related (temporally related to study participation but could have been caused by [CONTACT_1604]), or probably related (temporally related to study participation and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1604]) to study participation. The clinical s tudy team will 
review all AE as they occur and determine the seriousness and relatedness of them .  
  We do not expect any severe AE in either study group. The clinical study team will review any SAE as they occur. All SAE deemed probably related to the study (and all 
deaths) will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_679814] treatment .  
 
6.4. Informed Consent /Assent  
 
2/1/2016 13 
 
All informed consents and assents will be performed by a physician -member of the research 
team.  
 
If the child and legal guardian (for subjects < 18 years) are int erested in participating in this 
study , a physician -member of the research team will guide the child and legal guardian through 
the informed consent/assent process . Written informed consent will be obtained from one legal 
guardian of subjects < 18 years of  age and from the patient him or herself if he or she is ≥ 18 
years of age .  Written informed assent will be obtained from subjects ≥9 and < [ADDRESS_679815] the child’s clinical care. Participants and their legal guardian have the right to switch to the standard treatment and/or withdraw from the study at any time. Withdrawal from the study will not affect receipt of clinical care.  
 
6.5. Payment to Subjects/Families  
Laser depi[INVESTIGATOR_523951]. All clinic visits and medications related to the study will be provided at no cost to the patient.   
6.6. Confidentiality  
 
Privacy and security will be maintained by [CONTACT_523979]. Only study identifications (IDs) will be used to identify patients on all data forms 
and all datasets used for analysis. The file linking study IDs to patient names and medical record numbers (MRNs) will be password protected and will not be made avai lable to non- study staff or 
used during data analysis. All study information will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_518671], to which only study staff will have access.  
 
Phase Two: Randomized control trial  
 
7.1. Data Collection and Management  
Patient data such as age, gender,  skin type, length of disease, past medical/surgical history, 
number/date of treatments, treatment parameters, patient pain scores after laser treatments and within the first 12 hours after treatment, and any subsequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_523946]/drainage. This information will be kept by [CONTACT_523976].

Physician Informed Consent  Script: 
 
Good morning/afternoon. My name [CONTACT_78919]. _______. I work with [CONTACT_523984] and [CONTACT_523985] at the Department of Surgery at Nationwide Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. I know that your child has been seen here at Nationwide Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523967]/her pi[INVESTIGATOR_523910]. We are 
doing a research study that is examining a possible treatment which might be successful in treating  this problem . I’d like to tell you about our research study on the use of laser hair removal 
in pi[INVESTIGATOR_523910]. May I tell you more about this?  
 {If Yes}  
 As surgeons, we all have different beliefs on how to best treat pi[INVESTIGATOR_523968]. Some surgeons believe that surgery to remove the infected tissue is the best way to treat this disease. There is evidence that the cause of this problem may be related to infected hair follicles in this  body  area which become long term in fections  over time . So we are 
conducting a study to investigate whether using laser hair removal treatments is a successful way to treat the problem as it develops and also help preve nt this problem from returning.  
 
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we are seeing how w ell patients tolerate laser hair removal treatments.  Let me  
explain the risks and benefits. 
  Risks  of laser hair removal for this problem  include the following:  
• No relief of symptoms  
• Return of pi[INVESTIGATOR_523910]   
• Discomfort from laser treatments  
Benefits of laser hair removal for this problem include the following:  
• Possible f aster relief of symptoms (ex: resolution of pain, redness ) 
• Avoiding surgery altogether  
• No risk of surgical complications  
• Possible decreased risk of re turn of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_523969]. I  will now explain what you can expect as a patient. When coming in for your 
treatment appointment, we will bring you to the exam room. There, we wi ll shave the pi[INVESTIGATOR_523970] a lidocaine anesthetic (numbing) cream on your skin which will remain there for 
about 45 minutes. After this, we will then use the laser on the area. This process should only take a few moments. Please tell us if you f eel any pain  during or immediately after the treatment. 
After your visit, please let us know (via text or email) your pain score from 1- 10 ([ADDRESS_679819] level of pain) at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after your treatment visit.   What questions may I an swer for you?  
 Would you be willing to take part in this study?  
 
{No -  Thank you for your time.} 
 {Yes -  Excellent. Thank you for your participation.}

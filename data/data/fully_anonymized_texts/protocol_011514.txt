Introduction: 
Intra-operative electrocorticography (ECo G), based on interictal spi[INVESTIGATOR_384033], is performed to opt imize delineation of the epil eptogenic tissue in the operating 
room during epi[INVESTIGATOR_58741]. Similarly, extra-operative electrocorticography is often 
recorded over days to weeks with intracrani al grids and depth electrodes, when the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_384034]-invasive studies and/or with intra-
operative ECoG. Surgical resection following ex tra-operative ECoG is then "tailored' by 
[CONTACT_384059] d. High frequency oscillations have been 
identified as a more precise biomarker for ep ileptogenic tissue. The aim of the study is 
to determine prospectively if ECoG- ta ilored surgery combining HFOs and standard 
clinical resection with ECoG, compared to standard clinical resection with ECoG alone, 
is feasible and will lead to an equal or bette r seizure outcome; the comparison to HFO + 
ECoG, versus ECoG alone, could be either in  the form of interictal spi[INVESTIGATOR_384035]-
operative ECoG or seizure onset  zone on extra-operative ECoG.  
 
Background and Rationale: 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_384036] 0.5-0.7% of the population,  of which 25% are children. About 30% of 
subjects with focal epi[INVESTIGATOR_384037], and half of them are 
eligible for epi[INVESTIGATOR_58741]. In recent years, the importance of early epi[INVESTIGATOR_384038], as successful surgery may lead to seizure- and medication-freedom 
and improved social and cognitive development, especially in children. The current rate 
of seizure freedom following epi [INVESTIGATOR_384039] 65%. During surgery, in most 
medical centers, either intra- operative ECoG is recorded to identify the irritative zone, 
defined by [CONTACT_384060][INVESTIGATOR_2988], or extra-operative ECoG is 
recorded to identify the seizure onset z one. The presence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_384040]/spi[INVESTIGATOR_2988], or the seizur e onset zone, identified by c linical neurophysiologists, is 
used to guide the neurosurgeon with respect to  the boundaries of brain tissue that is 
necessary for resection to achieve seizur e freedom. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_384041], and seizure ons et zone indicates where the seizures may 
be generated. Neither spi[INVESTIGATOR_384042], defined as the co rtical tissue whose complete 
removal is necessary to achiev e post-operative seizure freedom.  
 
High frequency oscillations (HFOs, 80-500 Hz ) on ECoG have recently been identified 
as a new biomarker for epi[INVESTIGATOR_384043].  Retrospective observational research, as 
well as more recent prospective observ ational studies, show that HFO presence 
strongly relates to, and may predict more ac curately, the epi[INVESTIGATOR_384044], and that 
the resection of brain tissue containing HF O may be superior than resection of brain 
tissue containing spi[INVESTIGATOR_384045] z one in rendering patient s seizure-free. The 
area showing HFOs usually overlaps with, but  may be smaller than, the area with spi[INVESTIGATOR_384046] [ADDRESS_480544] Clinical Practice 
During surgery, current clinic al practice is to measure epi[INVESTIGATOR_384047] (on intra-oper ative ECoG) or seizure onset  zone (extra-operative ECoG) 
with EEG recordings. Current clinical standard of  practice in either intra-operative ECoG 
or extra-operative ECoG is recorded to identi fy epi[INVESTIGATOR_384048]. 
The presence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_384049]/s pi[INVESTIGATOR_2988], or the seizure onset zone, identified 
by [CONTACT_384061], is used to  guide the neurosurgeon with respect to the 
boundaries of brain tissue that is necessary for resection to achieve seizure freedom. 
The particular part of the brain that has eit her of these abnormalities, is removed. We 
have used this method for over [ADDRESS_480545]: 
standard clinical practice only,  or standard clinical practice  along with HFOs. The results 
of this study may change the way we operate on epi[INVESTIGATOR_384050].  
 
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the strategy of incorporating HFO data to a standard 
ECoG-guided resection in pediatric epil epsy surgery will result in improved 
postoperative seizure outcome than the traditional approach.  
 
Objective: 
The primary objective is to determine if  HFO data in addition to ECoG data  
(experimental group, arm 1), compared to  standard ECoG data alone (current standard 
control group, arm 2), will lead to improved post-surgical seizure outcome 1 year after 
surgery.   
 
Secondary objectives include the comparison  of incidence of neurologic deficits, 
neuropsychological outcomes (when available with clinical testing), and quality of life 
outcomes.  
 
Study Design and Procedures: 
A single-blinded randomized contro l trial including subjects with refractory focal epi[INVESTIGATOR_384051]- or extra-operative electroc orticography. Surgery is

(arm 2).  
 
Randomization

Subjects or their caregivers will be a sked to fill out questionnaires about seizure 
frequency, medication and day to day function in  various life areas at each visit with the 
neurosurgeon/neurologist.

Quality of Life in Childhood Epi[INVESTIGATOR_384055]: 
Intra-operative ECoG, which could be pre-rese ction, post-resectio n, or both, during 
brain surgery would be determined based on clinical decisions. Similarly, extra-
operative ECoG would also be determined based on clinical decisions, and would be 
pre-resection.  
 
For those subjects randomized to the standar d clinical care with ECoG only (control 
arm), ECoG would be recorded but not assess ed for HFO until after the clinical decision 
has been made with respect to site and margin of the resection. Only cortical areas 
deemed abnormal by [CONTACT_384063].

For those subjects randomized to the HFO + standard clinical care with ECoG 
combined (experimental arm), ECoG would be recorded AND assessed for HFO rapi[INVESTIGATOR_384056]  (within 10 minutes) to minimi ze patient risk and while the 
neurosurgeon begins the initial resection. Should HFO persis t after resection, further 
resection to ensure complete removal of HFO and standard clinical ECoG abnormalities 
may be possible. Cortical areas generati ng HFO and/or abnormal by [CONTACT_384064], with the exception of HFO-only pr esence in eloquent cortex, 
which would be spared. Eloquent cortex is defined as sensorimotor cortex, primary 
language cortex (Wernicke's and Broca's areas), and primary visual cortex.   
 
Benefits of Study: 
HFO analysis could determine/predict a better surgical outcome. 
 
Potential Risks: 
 
In epi[INVESTIGATOR_384057].  
1. The patient may not become seizure free.  2. The patient may lose or may damage an area that is close to important function such 
as motor or speech functions.  
3. The patient may develop a surgical compli cation such as infection, hydrocephalus or 
stroke. 
 
In Standard Surgery plus HFO Method Ri sk: Additional ri sk may be unexpected 
neurologic deficit.  
 
There will be every effort made to minimize  loss of major brain function, such as 
language, motor skills, sensation, and vision, to what may be already anticipated from 
the standard clinical care approach. Should any  of these [ADDRESS_480549] any additional time under 
anesthesia for either method. 
There is no additional risk of recording HFOs at higher frequencies. Higher frequency simply 
allows us to capture brain signals at higher frequency rate.  
Randomization: There is no risk or benefit fr om randomization give n that standard of 
care ECoG will be completed during surgery.

Questionnaires: There are no risks to these questionnaire s other than the 
inconvenience of the time involved in answering the questions.

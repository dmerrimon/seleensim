1. Introduction 	and	Rationale 	
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is extremely prevalent worldw ide and affects over [ADDRESS_340155] and the morbidity and mortality 
associated with PAD remains  high, with up to 30% mortality risk at 5 years 2. Nearly, 3.2 
million endovascular procedures are  performed annually.3, 4 Though, this exceeds 
interventional procedure s performed for coronary  artery disease (CAD), the current PAD 
guidelines are silent regarding the need and optimal  duration of antiplatelet therapy (APT) 
for patients following an endovascular procedure for  claudication or critical limb ischemia 
(CLI). [ADDRESS_340156] impediment to the 
formulation of such guideline recommendations critically needed  by [CONTACT_278483], especially given the current limited durability of lower extremity  endovascular 
procedures.6 
 
2. Clinical	outcomes 	following 	lower	extremity 	endovascular 	
interventions 	
Endovascular or surgical revascul arization procedures are perfo rmed on individuals with 
lifestyle-lim iting claudication or CLI.7 Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is a well- 
established endovascular techni que for revascularizing obstruct ed lower limb arteries. This 
technique is associated wit h good patency in iliac artery inter ventions; however with dismal 
patency rates for infra-inguina l interventions.[ADDRESS_340157]- endovascular intervention.13 In addition clopi[INVESTIGATOR_278447]-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) events.

3. Antiplatelet	 agents	following 	lower	 extremity 	endovascular 	
intervention 	
It has been shown that dual antiplatelet therapy is a very impo rtant factor for short- and long-
term success in coronary interventions. Thus, based on the resu lts of randomized clinical trials, 
 
11 
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_278441];	Version	A1.5:	2‐23‐18  
current guidelines recommend dual an tiplatelet th erapy consisti ng of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_278448] 12 months after percutaneous  coronary intervention (PCI) fo r acute coronary syndromes 
and/or use of drug-eluting stents.[ADDRESS_340158]-interventional antiplate let treatment of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] a nd/or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 
.6 The results of the Management of  peripheral arterial intervent ions with mono or dual 
antiplatelet therapy  (MIRROR) study showed that patients treated with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]+aspi[INVESTIGATOR_278449] (TLR) rates at 
[ADDRESS_340159] bo 
patients [2 (5%) vs. 8 (20%),  p=0.04]. None of the TLR was due to thrombotic occlusion 
of previously recanalized arteries.  There were no significant d ifferences in the rate of 
binary restenosis at 6 months. After stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_278450]/placebo, the significant 
difference in TLR disappeared [9 (25%) clopi[INVESTIGATOR_47865]. 12  (32.4%) placebo (p=0.35)]. 
Thus in contrast to the first report of a reduction in the TLR at [ADDRESS_340160] after  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_278451]. The investigators concluded that prolonged dual th erapy (>6 months)  should 
be considered in patients who are at high risk for restenosis.  
 
Peripheral catheter interventions  are performed under local anesthesia allowing early and full 
mobilization. However, as a resu lt of this intervention, athero sclerotic plaques are ruptured and 
platelets aggregate at the site of injury.19 Extensive vessel wall damage coupled with low shear 
stress and poor infra popliteal outflow are mostly responsible f or the occurrence of 
reocclusion.20 
Additionally, in the initial phase  after catheter intervention,  a hypercoagulable state prevails, as 
parameters of activated coagula tion, including thrombin-antithr ombin complexes (TAT), D- 
Dimer and Fibrinopeptide A (Fa) become elevated in the plasma.21 This activated coagulation 
system produces conditions favorable for early thrombotic occlu sion, where ‘early’ is usually 
defined as a period covering the f irst four weeks after the intervention. Subsequently, intimal 
hyperplasia may follow which is re sponsible for intermediate an d late-term restenosis and 
reocclusion. Intimal hyperplasia  occurs as a result of denudati on (tearing off of the inner lining)   
of the endothelium caused by [CONTACT_278484]. Reported rates 
of arterial reocclus ion or symptomatic restenosis following fem oropopliteal PTA are between 
five and twenty-five per cent fo r early events and about 40% on e year.6 The five year patency 
rate was reported to be 83% for iliac and 58% for femoropoplite al PTA, whilst patients with 
stenoses or occlusions of less than 3 cm had a favorable long-term patency rate of 74%.22 
Patients with CLI or those subjec ted to local thr ombolysis show  higher incidences of 
reocclusion.23 The implantation of drug-eluti ng or nitinol ste nts, or treatme nt by [CONTACT_278485] h the capacity of reducing the 
occurrence of intimal hyperplasia , however may be associated wi th delayed endothelialization 
 
12 
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_278441];	Version	A1.5:	2‐23‐18  
and increased risk of thrombosis. 
Drug interventions with antiplate let agents to prevent thrombos is and/or reocclusion of the  
treated  segments would make an important contribution to the sustained success of 
endovascular  treatment, along with its contribution towards reducing overall  mortality in 
patients with PAD.  Current peri-interventional treatment strategies mostly include aspi[INVESTIGATOR_278452], initial administration of either unfractionated heparin (E llis 
1989) followed mostly by  [CONTACT_278486] a long-term basis (Do 
1994; Hess 1985; Shammas 2003b;  Watson 2000). However, these practices have never 
been tested in the setting of an adequately  powered randomize controlled trial.  
The Swedish trial on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (50 mg daily) use after PTA was a negative study, whereas the 
study by [CONTACT_278487] r patency and a dose effect f avoring a higher dose of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 
(100- 300 mg daily).24 At time points three and 12 months there  were 798 and 575 patients 
included with OR 1.38 (95% CI 0.85 to 2.23) and 0.98 (95% CI 0. 64 to 1.48), respectively, for 
primary occlusion. In fact, one cli nical trial called CAMPER (C lopi[INVESTIGATOR_278453]) (CAMPE R) was started in the 
[LOCATION_003] evaluating clopi[INVESTIGATOR_278454] f emoropopliteal 
angioplasty. Unfortunately, t his study had to be stopped due to  insufficient randomization 
numbers after one year. 
 
4. Trial	Objectives 	
To evaluate whether clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] 75 mg QD on a background of ASA  81 mg/d for U.S. sites 
(75-100 mg/d for international sites)  for clinically indicated duration with a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_340161] will be 
considered enrolled in the trial w hen he/she is randomized to one of the treatment arms of the 
study. All endpoints are subject-ba sed unless otherwise specifi ed. 
 
The primary endpoint is  subject- based of the longer of a 12-mo nth or end of study treatment 
endpoint of the first oc currence of index limb arterial occlusi on, surgical intervention,

endovascular intervention, amput ation of the affected limb (primary patency and limb salvage), 
MI, ischemic stroke or death (survival) 
The secondary endpoints are s ubject-based  on the longer of a 1 2-month  or end of study 
treatment endpoints that include : (a) the first occurrence of a ny individual component of the 
primary endpoint, (b) the first oc currence of the following dur ing follow-up: cardiovascular 
death, or MI, or ischemic stroke , or any amputation above the ankle and (c) severe bleeding 
defined according to the Global Utilization of Streptokinase an d Tissue plasminogen activator 
for Occluded coronary arterie s (GUSTO) classification 
The tertiary endpoint is base d on the longer of a12-month  or e nd of study treatment moderate 
bleeding according to th e GUSTO classification 
 
Clinically indicated DAPT duration will be based on the longest  pre-discharge following 
index peripheral intervention procedure DAPT duration. This wil l be determined based 
on: peripheral intervention device IFUs, preceding coronary int ervention, acute coronary 
syndrome or other guideline-based clinical or device specific D APT duration.    
Study treatment will be discontinued at the first occurrence of  a primary endpoint as 
defined in the table below. Patie nts, however, can resume takin g aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], 
or both based on their provi der’s clinical decision.

8. Justification 	of	trial	design	
A multitude of clinical studies a nd analyses have attempted to address the question of 
optimal DAPT duration  following endovascular peripheral arterial intervention for 
symptomatic PAD and have either not been  adequately powered or have been 
abandoned. This study needs to be undertaken as a randomized co ntrolled trial  to try 
and conclusively answer the question in an unbiased fashion. Th is modification will 
facilitate recruitment and make  the study consistent with curre nt clinical practice. The 
relevance of the study results w ill is significantly elevated.

study treatment. This visit may fall between q6m visit schedule  for some patients . 
4. Phone visits can be done if patient s refuse in-clinic visit dur ing the follow up period, or 
who are do not show up to their fol low up visits. Labs and ABIs  will be collected and 
 
19 
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_278441];	Version	A1.5:	2‐23‐18  
documented, if available in their  medical records during the fo llow up period. Study 
team should document 2 attempts to s chedule in-clnic visits bef ore phone visits are 
completed during follow-up  
5. Patients who do not complete thei r follow up visits in -clinic will not be provided a refill 
of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_278462] (if ra ndomized to the long arm) They will  remain on the study as 
ITT and phone follow-up may be compl eted to collect data. Presc riptions may be 
renewed when patients compl ete an in-clinic visit.  
 
13. Informed 	consent	
All subjects who are potential trial candidates must provide wr itten informed consent before  
enrollment.  
Subjects must sign the trial-specific, most recent version of the Institutional Review Board  
(IRB) approved Informed Consent form before any trial-specific interventions. Trial  
personnel should explain to the s ubject that even if a he or she agrees to participate in the  
trial and signs an Informed Consent form, careful assessment of  inclusion/exclusion criteria  
may demonstrate that the subject is not a suitable candidate fo r the trial, and, therefore, the  
subject will not be allowed to participate.  
Trial Center personnel will maintain a Screening/Enrollment Log  to document enrolled  
subjects and select information about candidates who fail to me et the general or angiographic  
entry criteria.  
 
14. Sample	size	estimate 	
The occurrence of the primary endpoint is expected to be approximately 49% in  the control 
group, derived on the basis of current literature review and pr eliminary data form  XLPAD 
registry.18 
A 30% relative risk reduction i n the incidence of primary endpo int would be clinically  
important. To detect a 30% relative reduction in the primary ev ent rate from 49% to34% 17 
with 80% power at the two-sided, 0.05 significance level, assuming a 12-month  recruitment 
period and a 10% dropout rate at 1 year, a total of 404 patients will be randomized  (202in 
each group) and followed-up for endpoints for longer of a 12-mo nth or end of study 
treatment period.  
 
15. Control	of	systematic 	bias/errors	
In determining subject eligibil ity for the trial, the Investiga tor or his/her designee’s  
assessment of inclusion/exclusion parameters will be used.  
An independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will review clin ical events that occur  
during the trial. The CEC will be blinded to the trial center a nd subject identification to the  
extent possible. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review adverse  
events that occur during the trial.

ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_278441];	Version	A1.5:	2‐23‐18  
16. Eligibility 	of	subjects,	 exclusions 	and	missing	data	
 
All subjects who are enrolled will be eligible for evaluation, regardless if they receive the  
control or active arm drug trea tments for the assigned duration s or not. Sensitivity analyses  
to account for missing data will be performed and may include i mputation of missing data  if 
deemed appropriate. The distribution of prognostic factors betw een subjects with and  
without data will be examined. Statistical models that account for censored data will be  
employed in appropriate circumstan ces, e.g., for time-to-event outcomes. Outlier values will  
be evaluated for their validity. All data will be included unle ss judged to be invalid. The  
robustness of the primary endpoint  conclusion will be assessed based on these analyses. 
 
17. Analysis 	set	
The primary endpoint will be analyzed on an intent-to-treat bas is and on a per-protocol basis 
analysis will also be performed. F or intent-to-treat analysis, all subjects who sign the IRB/EC- 
approved written Informed Consen t form and are enrolled into th e trial will be included in the 
analysis, regardless of whether they receive the control or act ive arm drug treatments for the 
assigned durations or not. For per-protocol analysis, only subj ects who receive the control or 
active arm drug treatments for the assigned durations will be i ncluded in the analysis. 
The primary analysis set for te sting of the primary endpoint is  the intent-to-treat  analysis set. No 
formal interim analyses are pl anned for the purpose of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_278463]. 
 
18. Availability 	of	aspi[INVESTIGATOR_278464] i n post endovascular 
interventions, they would be  used on the basis of use as per routine clinical practice and a s 
per local/regional drug procurement and dispensing  practices.  
 
19. Statistical	 analysis	
Continuous variables will be summarized as mean±standard deviat ion and compared 
using the t-test or the  Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate. Discrete variables will  be 
presented as frequencies and group  percentages and compared using the chi-square test. 
For all comparisons a two-sided probability of <0.05 will be  considered statistically 
significant. All analyses were pe rformed using the SAS 9.4 or r ecent version (SAS  
Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina). Primary endpoint will be  assessed as per an intention-
to treat principle.  
Subsequent analysis will also be performed based on per-protoco l basis.  Pre-specified 
subgroup analyses will include:  
1. Stent vs. non-stent groups  
2. DES vs. BMS  
3. Above and below-the knee intervention  
 
21 
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_278441];	Version	A1.5:	2‐23‐[ADDRESS_340167]‐procedure 	endpoints 	
Post-procedure information will be  collected at regularly scheduled follow-up examinations, as 
detailed in the clinical trial schedule, and will be summarized  using the descrip tive statistics 
described above. 
 
Primary 	Endpoint 	
 
For the primary endpoint of 12-month composite of primary paten cy, limb salvage, MI, 
ischemic stroke and  survival, with 95% confidence bound s will be calculated in the 
active arm and compared to control treatment  duration. If this bound is less than that of 
control, then the primary endpoint will be considered met. All enrolled  subjects are to be 
assessed for adverse events at follow-up visits. Assuming a max imum of 10% attrition 
due to  non-compliance, loss to follow-up or death or non-compliance wi th follow-up, a  
minimum of 184 subjects in each arm are expected to be evaluabl e for the primary 
endpoint.  
Secondary 	Endpoints 	
Secondary endpoints will be summa rized at the specified time po ints using the descriptive  
statistics described above, individually or in comparison between the treatment groups.  
Statistical analyses of the following secondary endpoints will be summarized for descriptive  
purposes and without adjustments for multiplicity:  
 Changes in ABI from baseline to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], [ADDRESS_340168]-procedure will be analyzed using paired two-sided S tudent t-tests.  
 Changes in Walking Impairment Questionnaire scores from baselin e to [ADDRESS_340169]-proc edure will be analyzed using pa ired two-sided  
Student t-tests.  
 Freedom from Target Lesion Revascularization Kaplan-Meier estim ates and plots  
will be presented to [ADDRESS_340170]-procedure  
Pooling	Across	 Institutions 	
Analyses will be performed using d ata pooled across institution s. Analyses to justify pooling 
will include the following: 
 The primary endpoint presented by [CONTACT_14189]. 
 An assessment of the ‘poolability ’ of the institutions using a 2-by-(number of 
institutions) contingency table of outcome versus institution. Fisher’s Exact Test will be 
used to assess homogeneity. Inst itutions with fewer than five s ubjects will be combined 
based on geographic region if possible. 
 If the institutions are found to be significantly heterogeneous  with respect to the 
 
22 
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_278441];	Version	A1.5:	2‐23‐[ADDRESS_340171] data will be collected in a secure electronic data capt ure (EDC) system via the  
Internet.  The Principal Investig ator or Sub-investigator must ensure the accuracy and  
completeness of the recorded data entered into the EDC and also  by [CONTACT_278490]/her  
electronic signature [CONTACT_138365] a ppropriate paper Case Report Forms (CRF). The 
Investigator’s  signature [CONTACT_278505] h local 
regulations.  
Changes to data previously submitted to the sponsor will requir e a new signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_278491]. The coordi nating or primary 
study site  team will compare the data entered into EDC and paper CRF for d iscrepancy 
and require a  response from the site PI/Sub-I.  
Audits may be performed for quality assurance of data handling against source 
documents  
Visual and/or computer data review will be performed to identif y possible data 
discrepancies.  Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the EDC syst em and 
will be issued to the  site for appropriate response. The trial center will be responsible 
for resolving all queries in the database in a timely  manner. 
 
22. Monitoring 	
Monitoring of trial centers will be made periodically during th e trial, as outlined in the 
trial monitoring plan, to ensure that all aspects of the current, app roved 
protocol/amendment(s)  are followed.  
Original source documents will be reviewed for verification of data in the electronic 
database.  The Investigator/institution guarantees direct access to origin al source 
documents, including  electronic medical records, if applicable, by [CONTACT_278492], their designees, and  appropriate regulatory authori ties. In the event that the 
original medical records cannot be  obtained for a subject that is seen by a non-trial 
physician at a non-trial institution,  photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_278465]. In the event  such records cannot be released, the study 
site will allow verification of the source data by  [CONTACT_278493] e source electronic

ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_278441];	Version	A1.5:	2‐23‐[ADDRESS_340172] screen handled exclusively by [CONTACT_278494]/investigator(s).  
The trial also may be audited for quality assurance by [CONTACT_278495], as well 
as inspected by [CONTACT_4708].  
It is important that the Investigator and relevant trial person nel are available during  
monitoring visits, audits and in spections, and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.

Such monitoring visits will  be conducted for. sites o n a six monthly basis  
 
23. Adverse 	Events	
All Adverse Events (AE) and Seri ous Adverse Events (SAE) will b e reported through  
EDC and analyzed through study follow-up period. 
 
Term Definition 
Adverse Event (AE) Any untoward medical occurrence in a 
subject. This definition  does not imply 
that there is a relationship between the adverse
 event and the treatment under 
investigation.  
Note 1: In addition, the definition of AE 
applies to any event  with an onset post-
randomization procedure or to any  
underlying diseases, present at baseline, 
that exacerbate in  severity post-
randomization procedure. Therefore, any  
underlying disease that was present at the 
time of enrollment  is not to be reported as 
an AE, but any increase in the  severity in 
the underlying disease is to be reported as 
an AE.  This definition includes events 
occurring in the follow-up  period . 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
 An adverse event that:  
• led to death;  
• led to a serious deterioration in the 
health of the subject  that: 
 resulted in a life-threatening illness 
or injury,  
 resulted in a permanent 
impairment of a body structure  or 
a body function,  
 
24 
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_278441];	Version	A1.5:	2‐23‐18  
 required in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278467],  
 resulted in medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent  
permanent impairment to body structure or a body
 function  
 
 
Clinical events to be considered  and reported as expected SAE i nclude, but are not limited 
to: 
 MAE (see definitions)  
 Stent Thrombosis  
 Bleeding complication as per GUSTO definition  
 Vascular event requiring target limb surgical or 
endovascular intervention or  amputation  
 Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278468]:  
 Unrelated: The adverse event is determined to be due to a concu rrent illness or 
effect of  another device/drug and is not r elated to the st udy related dru gs 
 Possible: The adverse event is determined to be potentially related to the study 
related  drugs, and an alternative etiology is equally or less likely co mpared to the 
potential  relationship to the study related drug  
 Probable: There is a strong relationship to study related drug or recurs on re-  
challenge, and another etiology is unlikely  
 Highly Probable: There is no other reasonable medical explanati on for the event  
The Investigator must assess th e relationship of the adverse event to the study related drug 
using  the following categories and definitions:  
 Unrelated – The adverse event is determined to be due to a concurrent illness or 
effect of  a device/drug and is not related to the study related drug use  
 Possible – The adverse event is determined to be potentially re lated to the index  
procedure, and an alternative etiology is equally or less likel y compared to the 
potential  relationship to study related drug use  
 Probably – There is a strong relationship to index procedure, o r recurs on re-
challenge,  and another etiology is unlikely  
 Highly Probable – There is no other reasonable medical explanat ion for the event  
 
25 
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_278441];	Version	A1.5:	2‐23‐[ADDRESS_340173] document the outcome of the AE using the following categories:  
 Resolved without residual effects  
 Resolved with residual effects  
 Recovering/Resolving  
 Not Recovered/Not Resolved  
 Death  
 Unknown  
 
Reporting Requirements  
Trial personnel must report to the study PI’s office any SAE or MAE by [CONTACT_87109] [ADDRESS_340174] follow-up  information and the completed adverse event CRF to 
the as the event continues and/or resolves.  
All adverse events will be recorded in the electronic database managed by [CONTACT_278496]. A 
description of the  event, including the start date , resolution date, action taken,  assessment, 
and outcome should be  provided, along with the Investigator’s assessment of the 
relationship between the AE and the  trial treatment. All adverse events also need to be 
reported to the local IRB within [ADDRESS_340175] of unknown factors accoun ting for unanticipated side eff ects 
cannot be completely  excluded, therefore observation and follow-up of subjects is 
required as outlined in the protocol.

Risk	 minimization 	
The risks associated with the a spi[INVESTIGATOR_278470] r elatively well established, and 
the preceding risks represent the mo st up-to-date understanding of risks associated. The 
study team  will employ measures throughout the course of this investigation, to minimize 
these risks to  subjects choosing to participate. In general, efforts will be m ade to 
minimize these risks by:  
i. Selecting Investigators who are experienced and skilled clinici ans and 
expert in endovascular procedures  
ii. Clearly defining inclusion/exclus ion criteria to ensure only ap propriate 
subjects are  enrolled  
iii. Ensuring that the treatment and follow-up of the subjects are c onsistent 
with current  medical practices  
 
Specifically, every subject participating in this trial will undergo the following:

Walking	 impairment 	score	
Patients will be asked to complete a walking impairment questio nnaire (score range: 0 to 
14,080)  at baseline, and then every 6 months for 12 months or until the end of study 
treatment visit depending on the randomization arm. A patient with a total score of 0 on 
question 2  would not be able to walk indoors around his/her home without c laudication, 
while a maximum  score of 14,080 would be achieve d by a patient who can walk 5 b locks 
(1,500 feet) without  claudication. The questionnaire will exclude patients with bila teral 
superficial femoral artery  interventions, to minimize patie nt bias resulting from partial 
symptomatic improvements  following successful intervention of one extremity, later 
followed by [CONTACT_278501]-  lateral superficial femoral artery.  
All , clinical adjudication and adverse events  monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_278502] a nd safety monitoring board.

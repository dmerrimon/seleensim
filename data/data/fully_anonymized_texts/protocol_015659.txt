MYO-0709: A Prospective , Non-Randomized , Unblinded Study Evaluating the Treatment with the Cryo-
Touch III Device For Upper Limb Spasticity  
1. Introduction  
1.1. Background  
Spasticity, common in neurological disorders, is part of the upper motor neuron 
syndrome displaying increased tone, clonus, spasms, spastic dystonia and co -
contractions.  The impact of spasticity on the patient varies from a subtle 
neurological sign to severe spasticity  causing pain and contractures.  Upper limb 
spasticity  (ULS) is the rapid contraction or shortening of the muscles in the arm  
causing abnormal muscle movements in the elbow, wrist and fingers . It has been 
reported that over [ADDRESS_129655]  and elbow joint s, and fixed  arms in flexed positions 
result in extreme discomfort, pain and spasm.   A nonsurgical, minimally invasive , 
effective approach to pain associated with ULS is desirable . 
Myoscience , Inc. (Redwood City, C A) has developed a pain management  device 
– the Cryo-Touch III – for a novel, minimally invasive procedure  using focused 
cold therapy to target sensory nerve tissue and offer long -lasting pain relief  
through cryoanalgesia .  The device operates on the well -established cryobiology 
principle that lo calized exposure to controlled , moderately low temperature 
conditions can alter tissue function.  The therapy treats nerves via a probe in the 
form of an asse mbly of small diameter needles, creating a highly localized , low 
temperature  treatment zone around the probe.   This focused cold therapy creates a 
conduction block that prevents nerve signaling.  Prior studies of the Cryo-Touch, 
Cryo-Touch II, Cryo-Touch III (a.k.a. PCP 1.0) devices have provided 
preliminary evidence of effectiveness  on motor nerves  and have been shown to be 
safe with no serious  device-related adverse events.   
1.2. Device Description  
The Cryo-Touch III Device  (a.k.a. PCP 1.0)  (Figure 1) is a minimally invasive 
needle-based device. The device consists of a re -usable portable C ontrol Unit, 
Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], single use Cryoprobes (Fig ure 2) and Cryogen Cartridges. The 
Control Unit and Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_116075] a standard power outlet .  The system is microprocessor controlled. Its 
functionality is driven by [CONTACT_116087]/off switch. Th e unit displays 
indicator lights to guide the operator.  
The system produces the desired effects through initiation of a cooling cycle. 
Each cooling cycle is initiated by [CONTACT_116088]. A freezing zo ne forms around 
the tip of the C ryoprobe and the adjacent tissue. The Cryogen Cartridges are 
provided in individually sealed pouches. Each cartridge contains a nitrous oxide 
cylinder encased with a safety cap and filter.

The Cryoprobes are supplied in sterile packaging and are single -patient use. The 
Cyroprobe tips are closed,  therefore no cryogen enters the insertion site. A skin 
warmer provides warming at the base o f the Cryoprobe tips to keep the  skin 
surface above freezing temperatures.

2. Improvement in spasm frequency and intensity as m easured by [CONTACT_116096]:  Subjects experiencing spasm of the upper extremity will be 
assessed usin g the Penn Spasm Frequency  Scale at each study visit.  
 
3. Improvement in upper extremity motor recovery as measured by [CONTACT_116097] -
Meyer Scale ( post stroke subjects only):  Subjects who have spasticity due 
to stroke will be assessed using the Fugl -Meyer – Motor Recovery after 
Stroke Scale at each study visit.  
 
4. Subject assessed change in Mean Spasticity Num erical Rating Scale 
(NRS) Score:  Subjects w ill be asked "On a scale of '0 to 10' please 
indicate the average level of your spasticity over the last 24 hours" with 
the anchors: 0 = 'no spasticity' and 10 = 'worst possible spasticity'.  'No 
spasticity' is explained as  the time prior to the onset of their s pasticity.  
 
5. Improvement in pain as assessed  by [CONTACT_116098] (VAS):  
Subjects will be shown a number scale and six facial expressions 
suggesting various pain intensities.  The subject will be asked to choose 
the face that best describes how they f eel.  The far left face indicates ‘No 
hurt’ and the far right face indicates ‘Hurts worst’.  The VAS will be 
conducted at every study visit.

• resulted in a  life-threatening illness or injury  
• resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body 
function 
• required in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]  
• resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent 
impairment to body structure or a body function  
▪ Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
An unanticipated adverse device (UADE) effect is defined in [ADDRESS_129661], problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary  plan or application), 
or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to

dated approval from the IRB  for the protocol, consent form, subject 
recruitment materials/process (e.g., advertisements), and any other written 
information to be provided to subjects  at his/her site . The inves tigator will 
submit documentation of the IRB  approval to the Sponsor or designee.  
The IRB approved consent form must include all elements required by [CONTACT_8415], 
state, and local regulations, and may include appropriate additional elements.  
The investigator/designee will explain the study to each potential subject , and 
the subject must indicate voluntary consent by [CONTACT_116102].  If the subject is not able to provide written 
consent, the subject ’s legal representative will consent on their behalf as 
directed by [CONTACT_116103].  The investigator /designee  must provide the subject 
with a copy of the consent form, in a language the subject understands.   
The investigator /designee  will maintain documentation showing that 
informed consent was obtained prior to the initiation of any study -specific 
procedures.  
Withdrawal of IRB  approval of the investigator’s part in the investigation 
shall be reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_129662] for device accountability a t the clinical sites participating in 
this trial.

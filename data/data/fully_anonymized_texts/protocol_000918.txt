1  Protocol Synopsis  
PROTOCOL TITLE:  A phase I /II trial of very low to low -doses of continuous 
azacitidine  in combination with standard doses of lenalidomide and low -dose 
dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma  
DATE PROTOCOL FINAL:   
INDICATION:   Relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma  
STUDY PHASE:  Phase I /II 
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:   The best currently available treatment for 
patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma uses regimens that include novel 
agents like lenalidomide, thalidomide, and bortezomib but still yield unsatisfactory long term tumor control with median remission duration not more than one year and median survivals ranging between [ADDRESS_1266615] studies  (1). As myeloma progresses, 
clones emerge that have more tumor suppressor genes silenced by [CONTACT_903036][INVESTIGATOR_014], escape from immune attack, and 
independence from the bone marrow microenvironment (2-6). In contrast to mutations 
such epi[INVESTIGATOR_903006], which inhibits the me
thylation of newly synthesized DNA by [CONTACT_835193] (DNMT ) (7-9) and has been shown to improve survival in MDS and 
WHO AML compared to conventional therapy (10) .  One of the most active current 
regimens for relapsed/refractory myeloma uses lenalidomide in combination with 
dexamethasone yielding a response duration of over 11 months and an overall survival of about 30 months (11) . In the upfront therapy setting, low dose 
dexamethasone in 
combination with lenalidomide appears to yield at least equivalent survival rates but 
cause less toxicity than conventional dose dexam ethasone (12). This regimen 
(lenalidomide 25mg day 1- 21, every 28 days with dexamethasone 40mg weekly) has 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_903007]. By [CONTACT_903037] a zacitidine , resistant myeloma clones, 
which continue to synthesize DNA  despi[INVESTIGATOR_116175], may 
become sensitive through 
reactivation of silenced tumor suppressor genes leading to a deeper and longer response. In vitro, non -toxic single low doses of azacitidine (1μM) can reactivate tumor suppressor 
genes in myeloma cell lines for 3 -7 days  (unpublished observations ). Doses higher than 
2-5μM, depending on the cell type, can exert immediate toxicity likely related to 
nucleoside analogue properties of the drug. Pharmacokinetic data in humans suggest that a single dose of 50mg/m
2 subcutaneously reaches concentrations that should be sufficient 
for DNA demethylation but could cause classical nucleoside analogue toxicity in some 
patients ( 2.89μM +/ - 1.35 μM SD), higher doses like 75mg/m2 reach 4.88 μM +/ - 1.4μM  
SD and thus almost certainly exert classic nucleoside analogue toxic effects (13) . In this 
study we aim to avoid pronounced nucleoside analogue side effects while maximally 
exploiting DNA demethylating effects of azacitidine. We will therefore assess t he safety 
of combination therapy with azacitidine given at low but increasing doses up to 50mg/m2 
 Confidential Page 7 of 71  
 
Version: 07/16/[ADDRESS_1266616] dose lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone in 
relapsed or refractory myeloma patients in a phase I /II study with [ADDRESS_1266617]- dose azacitidine in myeloid neoplasia  patients with kidney 
dysfunction(14) and GFR- adjusted lenalidomide for myeloma patients (15), amendment 7 
extends the safety and preliminary efficacy evaluations to myeloma patients with GFR 
30-59 ml/min (Cockroft- Gault ). Lenalidomide will be used at a fixed dose of 10mg daily 
from day 1- 21 every 28 days which yielded equal AUC concentrations in myeloma 
patients with GFR 30 -49m/min as 25mg daily from day 1- 21 every 28 days in patients 
with GFR > 80 ml/min in a recent study(15) . Only two dose level s of azacitidine will be 
tested . Dose level “CKD 1” will use azacitidine at 40 mg/m2 s.c. twice a week  which has 
been found tolera ble in patients with GFR > 60 ml/min ; one of six patients developed a 
dose limiting toxicity, culture negative neutropenic fever at an absolute neutrophil count 
(ANC) nadir of 0.48K/mm3,.with resolution the next day at an ANC of  0.89K/mm3 
without G -CSF use. At the time of amendment 7, two patients with normal kidney 
function have completed the first cycle at dose level 5 (azacitidine 50mg/m2 s.c. twice a 
week) without dose limiting toxicities. Six patients with GFR 30 -59 ml/min w ill be 
treated at CKD 1  if dose limiting toxicities (DLTs ) do not occur in more than one patient . 
If 2 of 3 or 2 of up to six patients develop DLTs at CKD1, subsequent patients will be treated at “CKD - 1” (30mg/m
2 s.c. twice a week).  Otherwise (no more tha n one patient 
with DLTs at CKD1) , subsequent patients will receive azacitidine at  50mg/m2 s.c. twice a 
week (= dose level CKD2). Lower or higher dose levels will not be tested. This modified 
dose escalation scheme increases safety by [CONTACT_903038] 6 patients per dose level and guarantees that the tolerability of twice a week azacitidine in patients with GFR 30 -59 
ml/min will be defined by [CONTACT_903039] 12 additional patients. 
Omission of 
weekly azacitidine is based on the observation that clinica l benefit response rates were 
more than twice as high with twice a week than with weekly azacitidine dosing (40% versus less than 15%) in patients with GFR > 60ml/min , an encouraging result taking into 
consideration that patients had received a median of  4.5 prior regimens, with myeloma 
refractory to previous lenalidomide in 88%, to previous protesome inhibitors in 81%, and to both lenalidomide and proteasome inhibitors in 75%. Once the highest tolerated low 
dose for patients with reduced GFR (HTLD -CKD) has been defined, enrollment at this 
dose level may contribute to the [ADDRESS_1266618] started treatment, including two at dose level 5. Assuming up to 6 patients will be enrolled per dose level;  the ma ximal number of enrolled patients will 
therefore increase from previously estimated 40 to 44 after amendment 7. 
STUDY OBJECTIVES:  
Primary:    
• Define the highest tolerated low doses (HTLD  and HTLD -CKD for GFR > 60 
ml/min and 30- 59ml/min, respectively) and s afety of azacitidine given at low but 
increasing doses up to 50mg/m2 twice a week concurrently with GFR-adjusted 
lenalidomide doses and low dose dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or 
refractory multiple myeloma.

Version: 07/16/2015 Secondary:    
• Response according to inte rnational response criteria (> PR) and clinical benefit 
response ( >minor response according to adapted EBMT criteria ), see under 7  
• Correlate response with plasma activity of the azacitidine inactivating enzyme 
cytidine deaminase (CDA)  
• Progression- free survi val and overall survival 
• Peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor (CD34+) yield and time to neutrophil 
and platelet recovery in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation 
• Promoter demethylation and gene reactivation in myeloma cells and 
hema topoietic progenitors  treated at the HTLD / HTLD- CKD level  after one 
cycle of therapy 
• Changes in global gene expression in myeloma cells treated at the HTLD / 
HTLD -CKD  level  after one cycle of therapy 
STUDY DESIGN:  
Two institutions phase I /II study, classical 3x3 design for patients with GFR > 60ml/min, 
modified 3x3 design for patients with GFR 30 -59ml/min , with [ADDRESS_1266619] tolerated low dose ( HTLD / HTLD -CKD ).   
Patient population: M ultiple myeloma, with relapsed or refra ctory disease (see under 5.3). 
The Cockroft -Gault formula will be used for all GFR estimations throughout this study 
(Appendix IV). 
STUDY ENDPOINTS  
Primary:  
• The highest tolerated low dose  (HTLD  and HTLD -CKD for GFR > 60 ml/min 
and 30- 59ml/min, respectivel y) of azacitidine in combination with GFR -adjusted 
lenalidomide will be defined as the dose level below which dose limiting toxicity 
(DLT) occurs during the first [ADDRESS_1266620] 3 patient s with GFR > 60ml/min  develops DLT, up 
to three additional patients are treated at the same dose level. In patients with 
GFR 30 -59ml/min each dose level will enroll 6 patients unless more than 1 
patient develops  DLT. The dose will not be escalated above 50 mg/m2 twice a 
week for reasons outlined under background and rationale of this synopsis. Any 
dose level evaluated as the possible HTLD / HTLD -CKD  must include [ADDRESS_1266621] 28 -day cycle, then before each cycle until cycle 12 .  
 
Secondary:  
• Response will be determined monthly dur ing the first 12 cycles and every two 
months thereafter with serum and 24hr urine protein electrophoresis, and as 
appropriate , supplemented by [CONTACT_5294], serum free light chain assay, and 
 Confidential Page 9 of 71  
 
Version: 07/16/[ADDRESS_1266622] dose of the 
mobilizing agent.  
• Plasma from peripheral blood draws will be used to quantify the acti vity of CDA 
using an HPLC method (see under 5.5.3) 
• Progression- free survival will be measured from study entry to progression as 
defined by [CONTACT_903040]  (see under 5.9.1)  or death of any cause, 
whichever comes first.  
• Overall survival wi ll be measured from study entry to death from any cause.  
• CD34+ cell yield will be calculated based on flow cytometry of mononuclear cells 
harvested following stem cell mobilization. Time to neutrophil (> 1,000/mm3) and 
platelet (> 100,000/mm3) recovery will be counted from the day of stem cell 
infusion (=day 0)  
• Promoter demethylation and gene reactivation will be measured at least at the 
HTLD / HTLD- CKD level using t he Illumina ® HumanMethylation27 BeadChip 
array on CD138 purified and CD34 purified cells ob tained from bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_903008] 7 days before treatment start and at the end of cycle #1 .RNA will 
be harvested from the same cell populations to confirm reactivation of selected 
genes identified on the array.  Since the HTLD / HTLD- CKD is identifie d 
retrospectively DNA and RNA will be isolated from purified cell populations 
from all bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_903009] #1.  
• The RNA harvested from myeloma cells before and after the first cycle of therapy 
at the HTLD / HTLD- CKD level will fu rthermore be used to identify changes in 
global gene expression using the Illumina® HT12 array.

Version: 07/16/2015 3 Background and Rationale 
3.1 Lenalidomide  
3.1.1 Introduction  
Lenalidomide is a proprietary IMiD™ compound of Celgene Corporation.  IMiD™ 
compounds have both immunomodulatory and anti -angiogenic properties which could 
confer anti-tumor  and anti-metastatic effects.  Lenalidomide has been demonstrated to 
possess anti -angiogenic activity through inhibition of bFGF, VEGF and TNF -alpha 
induced endothelial cell migration, due at least in part to inhibition of Akt phosphorylation response to bFGF  (16).  In addition, lenalidomide has a variety of 
immunomodulatory effects.  Lenalidomide stimulates T cell proliferation, and the production of IL -2, IL -10 and IFN -gamma, inhibits IL -1 beta and IL -6 and modulates IL -
12 production(1 7).  Upregulation of T cell derived IL -[ADDRESS_1266633] in 
part through increased AP- 1 activity (18). 
Although the exact anti-tumor mechanism of action of lenalidomide is unknown, a 
number of mechanisms are postulated to be responsible for lenalidomide’s activity against multiple myeloma.  Lenalidomide has been shown to increase T cell proliferation, which leads to an increase in IL -2 and IFN -gamma secretion.  The increased level of 
these circulating cytokines augment natural killer cell number and function, and enhance natural killer cell activity to yield an increase in multiple myeloma cell lysis (19).  In 
addition, lenalidomide has direct activity against multiple myeloma and induces apoptosis or G1growth arrest in multiple myeloma cell lines and in multiple myeloma cells of patients resistant to melphalan, doxorubicin and dexamethasone(20).   
3.1.2 INDICATIONS AND [LOCATION_003]GE: 
Revlimid
® (lenalidomide) is indicated for the treatment of  patients with transfusion -
dependent anemia due to Low - or Intermediate -1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes 
associated with  a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional 
cytogenetic abnormalities.  Revlimid® is also approved in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma that have received at least one prior therapy. 
3.1.[ADDRESS_1266634] frequently reported adverse events reported during clinical studies with lenalidomide in oncologic and non- oncologic indications, regardless of presumed 
relationship to study medication include: anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, dehydration, rash, itching, infections, sepsis, pneumonia, UTI, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], cellulites, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, chest pain, weakness, hypotension, hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, back pain, bone pain, generalized pain, dizziness, mental status changes, syncope, renal failure, dyspnea, pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, CVA, convulsions, dizziness, spi[INVESTIGATOR_903012], syncope, disease progression, death not specified and fractures.

and the IND Safety Letters.  
3.2 Azacitidine  (Vidaza®)  
3.2.1 Introduction 
Azacitidine is an azanucleoside analogon, which was developed in the early 1960s as a 
cytotoxic agent (21). A number of studies have looked at different parenteral doses and 
schedules of azacitidine, finding maximum tolerated doses of up to 500 mg/m2 whe n 
administered weekly (22). Almost 20 years after the original development, azacitidine was 
found to inhibit the methylation of newly synthesized DNA by [CONTACT_903042] (DNMT) (7-9), leading to differentiation of human cell lines (23) and 
reversing  oncogenic silencing of tumor suppressor genes (24). Early trials used high doses 
of the drug that predominantly had nucleoside analogue -type cytotoxic effects  but in 
recent years low er doses, that can induce DNA demethylation in vivo (25)have been used 
successfully in MDS  and AML, improving survival compared to conventional care 
regimens in high risk MDS and WHO AML patients in a recent phase III trial (10).  
3.2.2 INDICATIONS AND [LOCATION_003]GE  
Azacitidine is indicated for treatment of patients with the following French- American -
British (FAB) myelodysplastic syndrome subtypes: refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (if accompanied by [CONTACT_291998]), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB -T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia 
(CMMoL).  
3.2.[ADDRESS_1266635] frequently reported adverse events reported during clinical studies with azacitidine, regardless of presum ed relationship to study medication include: 
Gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation , and anorexia), 
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, injection site events, arthralgia, dizziness, dyspnea, cough, and myalgia.

3.3 Rationale for Use in  Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma  
With an incidence of 5.6/100,[ADDRESS_1266636] common 
hemat ologic malignancy after Non- Hodgkin lymphomas (SEER 2001 -2005). It remains 
an incurable disease and in the setting of second line or later treatment the progression -
free survival ranged between 6- 12 months with an overall survival between 1.5 and 3 
years i n recent trials (1). One of the most successful regimens combined lenalidomide at 
25mg on [ADDRESS_1266637] 4 cycles followed by a dministration from day 1 -4 only in US

Version: 07/16/2015 patients  (11) . The majority of patients in this trial had been treated with at least 2 prior 
regimens. The median time to progression was 11.1 months in patients treated with the 
combination compared to 4.7 month with dexamethasone alone. Although the majority of 
dexamethasone- only treated patients received lenalidomide at relapse, the median overall 
survival was superior in the group randomly assigned to combination therapy (29.6 months versus 20.2 months). In Europe and Australia this regimen yielded similar  
results(2 6) leading to approval of lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone for 
patients with myeloma who have been treated with at least one prior regimen in the US and Europe and for relapsed or refractory myeloma in Australia.  A more recent trial 
randomly assigned newly diagnosed myeloma patients to a lower dexamethasone dose (40mg weekly) or to pulsed dexamethasone in combination with lenalidomide (Rd vs. RD, respectively) and found an improved 2 year overall survival (p=0.006) of 87% (Rd)
 
vs. 75% (RD)  at the most recently published analysis (12), suggesting at least equivalent 
outcome with a trend for lower toxicity, especially regarding venous thromboembolism (27). This finding was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_903013]- line and relapsed setting and is the regimen used in ongoing clinical trials (FIRST 
trial, SO777).  To further improve the outcome of patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma, resistance mechanisms towards available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_903014]. In the course of myeloma progression genetic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_903015](2 -4, 6, 28-34) . The latter are most stable if mediated by [CONTACT_903043], cell cycle dysregulation, and immune escape(2 -6, 
28-32, 35- 41). Azacitidine can reverse such silencing and has been shown to have anti -
myeloma activity in vitro and in mouse xenografts as a single agent and in combination thera py by [CONTACT_903044] a myeloma cell line with a 
silenced pro -apoptotic gene, called XAF -1(35, 42). The genome wide activity of DNA 
methyltransferase I (DNMT1) inhibitors like azacitidine  offers a mechanism to overcome 
apoptosis resistance mediated by [CONTACT_903045] -induced apoptosis in kidney cancer cell lines (37). 
Reactivation of tumor antigens and immunomodulatory genes by [CONTACT_532810]1 inhibition (37) 
may further increase the activity of immuno modulatory drugs and intrinsic immune 
responses as suggested by [CONTACT_903046] 31% response rate of melanoma patients 
treated with decitabine, the in vivo DNA deme thylating metabolite of azacitidine, and 
interleukin -2 in a phase I trial (43). After prolonged exposure to low doses of aza 
nucleosides in vitro, cancer cells may undergo cell death via differentiation, senescence, or direct apoptosis, likely depending on the methylation profile. Interestingly, healthy human hematopoietic stem cells can be expanded in vitro by [CONTACT_278609](4 4, 45) . Indirect 
evidence for expansion of the healthy stem cell pool in vivo comes from the observation that overall survival can be ex tended independent of a complete response in MDS (10), a 
disease that can be fatal due to a lack of normal hematopoietic stem cells. Such an expansion of healthy stem cells would have added benefit in myeloma patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell harvesting for high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue.

Version: 07/16/2015 In MDS azacytidine at 75mg/m2 d1-5 every 28 days or 50mg/m2 d1-5 and 8- 12 every 28 
days was relatively well tolerated  in combination with lenalidomide 5 -10mg daily and 
showed promising activity with an overall response rate of 71% and a complete response 
rate of 41%, suggesting the two drugs can be combined synergistically without excess 
toxicity(4 6). The FDA ap proved regimen of azacitidine, 75mg/m2 day 1- 7 every 28 days 
for the treatment of MDS leads to maximal blood concentrations that , while lower than in 
the original studies, are still directly cytotoxic in vitro (47) which could limit the tumor 
suppressor gene reactivating function by [CONTACT_903047]. It furthermore likely contributes to side effects that make a treatment interruption of three weeks necessary to allow for re covery when the standard 
MDS schedule is used (75mg/m
2 d1-7 every 28 days) . Unfortunately this also leads to 
DNA re-methylation before a new cycle begins (25, 48, 49). Furthermore, in diseases 
with a lower proliferative rate, like multiple myeloma, only a minority of cells would be expected to reactivate tumor suppressor genes if the drug was only given on one out of four weeks. In vitro, non-toxic single low doses of az acitidine (1μM) can reactivate tumor 
suppressor genes in myeloma cell lines for 3 -7 days (unpublished observations). Doses 
higher than 2- 5μM, depending on the cell type, can exert immediate toxicity likely related 
to nucleoside analogue properties of the drug. Pharmacokinetic data in humans suggest that a single dose of 50mg/m
2 subcutaneously reaches concentrations that should be 
sufficient for DNA demethylation but could cause classical nucleoside analogue toxicity in some patients ( 2.89μM +/ - 1.35 μM SD), higher doses like 75mg/m2 reach 4.88 μM 
+/- 1.4μM  SD and thus almost certainly exert classic nucleoside analogue toxic effects 
(13). In this study we aim to avoid pronounced nucleoside analogue side effects while 
maxi mally exploiting DNA demethylating effects of azacitidine. We will therefore assess 
the safety of combination therapy with azacitidine given at low but increasing doses up to 50mg/m

dexam ethasone in relapsed or refractory myeloma patients in a phase I/II study with [ADDRESS_1266639] tolerated low azacitidine dose to obtain an 
initial impression of efficacy and to evaluate whether this dose exerts the expected pharmacodynamic effects in myeloma cells  before a larger phase II trial may be 
conducted.

4.2 Endpoints  
4.2.1 Primary Endpoint  
• The highest tolerated low dose ( HTLD  and HTLD -CKD for GFR > 60 ml/min 
and 30- 59ml/min, respectively ) of azacitidine in combination with GFR -adjusted 
lenalidomide will be defined as the highest dose level studied (up to 50mg/m2 
twice a week) at which dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occur s during the first 28- day 
cycle in ≤ [ADDRESS_1266640] 3 patient s with GFR > 
60ml/min  develops DLT, up to three additional patients are treated at the same 
dose level. In patients with GFR 30 -59ml/min each dose level will enroll  6

5 Investigational Plan  
5.1 Overall D esign  
This phase I /II trial will use a classical 3x3 design to determine the highest tolerated low 
dose (HTLD) for patients with GFR > 60 ml/min (Cockroft -Gaul t) and a modified 3x3 
design to identify the highest tolerated low dose for patients with GFR 30 -59 ml/min 
(HTLD -CKD) with additional enrollment of [ADDRESS_1266643] tolerated low dose s 
(HTLD / HTLD- CKD) of azacitidine .   
 Dose levels are outlined under [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as one of the following  drug- related  toxicities 
occurring during the first 28- day cycle (if a DLT is attributed to progressive disease, it 
will not be counted as a DLT): 
• Any CTCAE v.4.0 grade > 3 non hematologic toxicity (including febrile 
neutropenia) 
o For nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, subjects must have a Grade 3 or 4 event that persists at this level despi[INVESTIGATOR_903016], in order for these events to be considered a DLT  
 Confidential   Page 19 of 71  
         
 
Version: 07/16/2015 o Grade 4 transaminitis (serum transaminase > 20 x upper limit of normal 
[ULN]) is a DLT, while Grade 3 transaminitis (serum transaminase > 5 x 
and ≤  [ADDRESS_1266644]) must be present for ≥ 7 days to be considered a DLT  
o Grade 3 or 4 venous thromboembolic events are not considered to be 
DLTs as long as anticoagulant therapy can be administered (see Section 6.5.3 and 6.6.2) 
o Grade 3 or 4 hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia or hyponatremia that responds to electrolyte supplementation within 7 days would not qualify as a DLT.  
 
• CTCAE v.4.0 grade > 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia that does not resolve to  
grade < 3 within seven days of holding azacitidine  and lenalidomide . While 
platelet transfusions are allowed at the discretion of the treating physician to maintain 100% dose level, any grade > 4 thrombocytopenia that is followed by 
[CONTACT_903048] < 3 will be counted as DLT.  
 
Dose escalation for patients with GFR > 60ml/min:  
At least [ADDRESS_1266645] 28 day cycle, up to 3 additional patients will be treated at the same dose level. If no DLT occurs in the additional 3 patients, subsequent 3 patients will be treated at the next dose level. Once DLT occurs in 
2 patients treated at a given dose level no further patients will be accrued at this dose 
level but patients already on treatment will continue according to study pr otocol. If DLT 
occurs in 2 patients treated at a given dose level, the next lower dose level will be evaluated as the possible HTLD , and if only 3 patients had been enrolled at this dose 
level, an additional 3 patients will enrolled to properly assess this  dose level as the 
possible HTLD .  The dose level at which DLT occurs in ≤ [ADDRESS_1266646] tolerated low dose  (HTLD ) and ten more patients will be accrued 
at this dose level.  Six evaluable patients must be assessed for DLT at any dose level that 
is being considered as the HTLD .  Patients experiencing a DLT during their first 28 -day 
cycle may remain on study with appropriate dose reduction  (5.7.3).  
Dose escalation for patients with GFR 30 -59ml/min:  
Only two dose levels of azacitidine will be tested in combination with fixed dose 
lenalidomide. Starting with dose level “CKD 1” (DL CKD1), 3 patients will initially be 
enrolled and if no more than 1 experience DLT, 3 additional patients will be enrolled at the same dose level.  If no more than 1 out of 6 patients treated at DL CKD1 develop 
DLT, subsequent patients will be enrolled at DL CKD2. Once 2 of 3 or 2 of up to 6 patients treated at a given dose level develop DLT, no further patients will be enrolled at that dose level. I f this occurs at DL CKD1, subsequent patients will be enrolled at DL 
CKD-1. If it occurs at DL CKD2, DL CKD1 will be defined as HTLD -CKD. If 2 of 3 or 
2 of up to 6 patients treated at DL CKD -1 develop DLT, the tested azacitidine / 
lenalidomide / dexamethasone regimen will be considered intolerable for patients with 
 Confidential   Page 20 of 71  
         
 
Version: 07/16/2015 GFR 30 -59 ml/min. The highest dose level that causes DLT in no more than [ADDRESS_1266647] 28 -day cycle may remain on study with 
appropriate dose reduction (5.7.3). 
 
Patients that are not evaluable for DLT throughout the first 28 day cycle of the dose 
escalation portion of the study due to progressive disease or for other reasons, will be replaced.  
 
5.1.1 Protocol Therapy  
[IP_ADDRESS] Lenalidomide Description  
REVLIMID
®  (lenalidomide), a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent 
with anti -angiogenic properties.  The chemical name [CONTACT_832] 3 -(4-amino -1-oxo 1,3-dihydro -

The empi[INVESTIGATOR_193038] C 13H13N3O3, and the gram molecular weight is 
259.3.  Lenalidomide is an off -white to pale -yellow solid powder. It is soluble in organic 
solvent/water mixtures, and buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide is more soluble in 
organic solvents and low pH solutions. Solubility was significantly lower in less acidic buffers, ranging from about 0.4 to 0.5 mg/ml. Lenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon atom and can exist as the optically active forms S( -) and R(+), and is produced as a 
racemic mixture with a net optical rotation of zero.  
[IP_ADDRESS] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
Mechanism of Action:  
The mechanism of action of lenalidomide remains to be fully characterized. Lenalidomide possesses immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic propert ies.  
Lenalidomide inhibited the secretion of pro- inflammatory cytokines and increased the 
secretion of anti -inflammatory cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  
Lenalidomide inhibited cell proliferation with varying effectiveness (IC50s) in so me but 
not all cell lines.  Of cell lines tested, lenalidomide was effective in inhibiting growth of 
 Confidential   Page 21 of 71  
         
 
Version: 07/16/2015 Manawa cells (a human B cell lymphoma cell line with a deletion of one chromosome 5) 
but was much less effective in inhibiting growth of KG -1 cells (human myeloblastic cell 
line, also with a deletion of one chromosome 5) and other cell lines without chromosome 
5 deletions.  Lenalidomide inhibited the expression of cyclooxygenase -2 (COX- 2) but not 
COX-1 in vitro.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism:  
Absorp tion: 
Lenalidomide, in healthy volunteers, is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_145087] 0.[ADDRESS_1266648] -dose. 
Co-administration with food does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC) but does 
reduce the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) by 36%. The pharmacokinetic disposition of lenalidomide is linear. Cmax and AUC increase proportionately with increases in dose. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose -regimen does not result in 
drug accumulation. 
Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed on 15 multiple myeloma patients treated in the 
phase I studies.  Absorption was found to be rapid on both Day 1 and Day 28 with time to 
maximum blood levels ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 hours at all dose levels (5mg, 10mg, 25mg, and 50mg).  No plasma accumulation was observed with multiple daily dosing.  Plasma lenalidomide declined in a monophasic manner with elimination half -life ranging 
from 2.8 to 6.1 hours on both Day 1 and 28 at all 4 doses.  Peak and overa ll plasma 
concentrations were dose proportional over the dosing range of 5mg to 50mg(50).  Exposure (AUC) in multiple myeloma patients is 57% higher than in healthy male 
volunteers( 51).  
 
Pharmacokinetic Parameters:  
Distribution: 
In vitro (
14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30%. 
Metabolism and Excretion:  
The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans has not been studied. In healthy 
volunteers, approximately two- thirds of lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged through 
urinary excretion. The process exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and therefore is 
partially or entirely active.  Half -life of elimination is approximately 3 hours. Renal 
impairment increases the area under the curve (AUC) and increases half -life to [ADDRESS_1266649] making dose adjustments necessary (52). A study presented at ASH 2011 determined 
lenalidomide AUC concentrations in 37 multiple myeloma patients with various glomerular filtration rates (Cockroft -Gault) who were treated with lenalidomide dosing 
schedules predicted to yield equal AUCs based on pharmacokinetic data obtained in patients without cancer diagnosis but with chronic kidney dis ease (CKD) (15). Ten

Version: 07/16/2015 myeloma patients with GFR > 80ml/min were treated with standard lenalidomide 25mg 
day 1- 21 every 28 days and served as comparison for patients w ith GFR 50 -80 ml/min 
(n=10), GFR 30- 49 ml/min (n=7), GFR < 30 ml/min (n=5), and patients on chronic 
hemodialysis (n=5), who received 25mg daily, 10mg daily, 15mg every other day, and 5mg daily, respectively, from day 1- 21 every 28 days. All patients received 
dexamethasone 40mg once a week but no other antimyeloma drugs. Average daily AUC values of patients with CKD were between 103 -149% of the ones in patients with GFR > 
80 ml/min and essentially identical for patients with GFR 30- 49 (103%). The renal 
funct ion remained stable in all patients . Severe adverse events occurred in 60% of 
patients on dialysis and 45% of remaining patients  (p=0.3), overall comparable to 
reported results(11, 26), as were response rates of a round 70% in these patients who had 
received a minimum of one prior myeloma regimen. In summary, GFR -adjusted 
lenalidomide dosing achieved appropriate drug exposure and was safe and effective(15) .

The empi[INVESTIGATOR_24598] C8H12N4O5. The molecular weight is 244. Azacitidine is a white to off -white solid. Azacitidine was found to be insoluble in acetone, ethanol, and 
methyl ethyl ketone; slightly solu ble in ethanol/water (50/50), propylene glycol, and 
polyethylene glycol; sparingly soluble in water, water saturated octanol, 5% dextrose in water, N -methyl-2- pyrrolidone, normal saline and 5% Tween 80 in water; and soluble in 
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).  
The finished product is supplied in a sterile form for reconstitution as a suspension for 
subcutaneous injection or reconstitution as a solution with further dilution for intravenous 
infusion. Vials of VIDAZA contain 100 mg of azacitidine and 100 mg mannitol  as a 
sterile lyophilized powder.  
[IP_ADDRESS] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
Mechanism of Action:  
VIDAZA is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. VIDAZA is believed to exert its anti-neoplastic effects by [CONTACT_903049] l hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine

Version: 07/16/2015 required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major 
suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes 
that are critical  for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine 
cause the death of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_91786], including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non- proliferating cells are relatively 
insensitive to azacitidine (51). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism:  
The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 MDS patients following a single 
75 mg/m2 
subcutaneous (SC) dose and a single 75 mg/m2 
intravenous (IV) dose. 
Azacitidine is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_903017]; the peak plasma azacitidine 
concentration of 750 ± 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour. The bioavailability of SC azacitidine relative to IV azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following IV dosing is 76 ± 26 L. Mean apparent SC clearance is 167 ± 49 L/hour and mean half -life after SC administration is 41 ± 8 
minutes(52). In a more recent trial the cytidine deaminase inhibitor tetrahydrouridine  
(THU) was added to collected blood samples to  avoid enzymatic breakdown of 
azacitidine in vitro. This trial suggested that maximal azacitidine  blood concentrations 
after s.c. administration w ere about 50% higher, 1192.8 +/ - 342.4 ng/mL(13). 
 
While deamination by [CONTACT_903050], urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and  its 
metabolites. Following IV administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for <1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of 
radioactivity in urine following SC administration of 
14
C-azacitidine was 50%. The 
mean elimination half -lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were 
similar after IV and SC administrations, about 4 hours(52).  
Special Populations  
The effects of renal or hepatic impairment, gender, age, or race on the pharmacokinetics 
of azacitidine have not been studied prospectively but  investigators at MD Anderson 
Cancer Center have recently reviewed their experience with the use of azacitidine and decitabine in 41 patients with myeloid malignancies and kidney dysfunction (14). The 
GFR was between 30 and 59ml/min in 29 patients and below 30ml/min in [ADDRESS_1266650] -dose azacitidine (75mg/m
2 for 7 days every 
28 days), 10 patients SC, one IV, and three of the eleven patients had GFRs below 30ml/min. Overall, adverse events to decitabine and azacitidine were not felt to be more 
frequent than in histo rical controls for patients with GFR > 30ml/min but more severe 
kidney dysfunction appeared to increase risk for hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities  leading to more frequent dose reduction or treatment delay. Response rates and 
survival was similar to historical controls. Results thus support the use of azacitidine and 
decitabine at standard doses, at least in patients with GFR > 30ml/min(14).

An in vitro study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that 
azacitidine may be metabolized by [CONTACT_4852]. Whether azacitidine metabolism may be 
affected by [CONTACT_903051].  
The potential of azacitidine to inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes is not known. In

[IP_ADDRESS] Dexamethasone  Description  
Glucocorticoids are adrenocortical steroids, both naturally occurring and synthetic, which 
are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Dexamethasone, a synthetic adrenocortical steroid, is a white to practically white, odorless, crystalline powder. It is stable in air. It is practically insoluble in w ater. It is designated chemically as 9 -fluoro- 
11β, 17,21-trihydroxy- 16α-methylpregna-1,4- diene -3,20- dione. The structural formula is 
represented below:

Version: 07/16/2015 [IP_ADDRESS] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
Pharmacokinetics and Mechanism of Action  
Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids that are 
readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Glucocorticoids cause varied metabolic  
and immune  effects after binding to cytoplasmic glucocort icoid receptors with 
subsequent translocation into the nucleus, where they affect gene expression . Naturally 
occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have sodium -
retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adreno cortical deficiency states. 
At equipotent anti -inflammatory doses, the synthetic analogue Dexamethasone almost 
completely lacks the sodium -retaining property of hydrocortisone and closely related 
derivatives of hydrocortisone. D examethasone , when used at rela tively high doses, can 
directly inhibit growth of myeloma cells and cause apoptosis. In numerous clinical trials increases of response rate have been observed by [CONTACT_903054].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Expected  Side E ffects:  
Common side effects of dexamethasone include anxiety, mood alteration/lability, potassium loss, hypokalemic alkalosis, peptic ulcer with possible perforation and hemorrhage, impaired wound healing, menstrual irregularities, hyperglycemia, i ncreased 
intraocular pressure, weight gain, nausea, headache, insomnia, peripheral edema, myopathy (with chronic use), acne, hirsutism. 
No drug interactions that raise additional concerns are known or postulated between 
azacitidine, lenalidomide and dexame thasone. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage Form 
Dexamethasone will be prescribed as tablets of 4mg strength for oral administration.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Storage 
Dexamethasone tablets should be stored at room temperature away from direct sunlight 
and protected from excessive heat and cold.     
[IP_ADDRESS] Prescri bing Information  
Dexamethasone will be prescribed according to standard practices and charged to the patient’s insurance.

5.5 Correlative S cience  
Azacitidine has been shown to reactivate expression of tumor suppressor genes silenced 
by [CONTACT_903055], animal experiments, and clinical tr ials, but so far this has not been demonstrated in myeloma cells of patients 
treated with azacitidine. Lenalidomide has pleiotropic effects that can include selective 
reactivation of SPARC in 5q- but not cytogentically normal erythroid progenitors (59).  
The two drugs might therefore act in concert, reactivating tumor suppressor genes 
silenced in myeloma cells. With the proposed studies we will investigate baseline DNA 
methylation and gene expression of myeloma cell s and if silenced tumor suppressor 
genes can be reactivated using the proposed regimen.  Effects on normal CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors will be investigated as well.

TM method, CD34+ cells and CD138+ 
cells will be purified using [ADDRESS_1266666] 70% purity will be used to 
assess DNA demethylation and mRNA reactivation . DNA and RNA of purified cells will 
be harvested using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA mini kit 
TM, which allows for column-
based isolation of DNA and RNA from the same sample. Isola ted RNA and DNA will be 
stored at - 80°C. Within 30 days (once a month) RNA samples will be transcribed into 
cDNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen TM), then stored at -80°C until further analysis. 
The Illumina® HT12 array will be used to analyze global gene expression in CD138+ 
cells.  DNA methylation  profiling will be performed using the Illumina® 
HumanMethylation27 BeadChip array in CD138+ and CD34+ cells according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions including bisulfite modification using ZymoTM kits. For 
approximately 10 selected sample genes, changes in expression after cycle one will be 
confirmed using real -time RT -PCR ( TaqMan, Applied Biosystems TM).

cycle 2,3,4,6)  will be used to isolate whole blood DNA  using the DNA blood and tissue 
mini kit® from Qiagen TM. This DNA  will be stored at -80°C and may later be used to 
investigate whether genes identified as hypermethylated on the methylation array can be 
detected in the peripheral blood using pyrosequencing of bisulfite modified DNA . A 
PyroMark Q24® sequencer in [CONTACT_903084]’s laboratory will be used for these studies.  
Plasma from heparin tubes will be collected and frozen at -80°C for later  determination of 
the activity of the azacitidine inactivating enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDA). This will be performed by [CONTACT_903056]. Saunthararajah’s laboratory, which

5.5.4 Data Analysis 
Promoter demethylation after cycle 1 in bone marrow cells enriched either for CD138 or for CD34 expression will be measured using Illumina 
TM array technology. The 
IlluminaTM bead array software assigns each CpG region tested a number between 0 and 
1.0 representing the degree of DNA methylation from 0 to 100%. The number of genes changing their methylation status significantly according to Illumina 
TM Bead Studio 
software, version [ADDRESS_1266667] -treatment samples this will be taken into account in the 
statistical analysis.  
Changes in global gene expression (Illumina® HT12 array)  after cycle one of therapy at 
the HTLD / HTLD -CKD  in bone marrow cells enriched for CD138 will analyzed by [CONTACT_903058], version 3. Genes statistically significantly up - or 
downregulated at least 2, 5, and [ADDRESS_1266668] -treatment 
samples this will be taken into account in the statistical analysis.  
To confirm reactivation of about 10 selected sample genes in CD138+ and CD34+ cells, 
real-time RT -PCR will be performed in triplicates and reported for each gene analyzed  
with mean and standard deviation of expression after compared to before cycle one. 
DNM T1 suppression will be analyzed after above outlined immunohistochemistry 
protocol. Image files will be loaded into the Image -Pro Plus environment and individual 
cells will be segmented for quantification of fluorescence signal with the "count/size" 
functi on of Image -Pro Plus. Precise segmentation will be achieved by [CONTACT_20998] a lower 
threshold just above background emission. A filter will then be set for an area of whole

high- content array of measurements that include event number, area, mean of pi[INVESTIGATOR_903022], and maximum and minimum pi[INVESTIGATOR_139755]. These scores will be integrated 
into a mean intensity fluorescence (MIF) score using the Image- Pro Plus software. The 
mean and standard deviation of reduction in MIF scores after treatment with azacitidine at the studied time points will be reported for all tested dose levels.  
5.[ADDRESS_1266669] three patients will be treated at dose level 1. Subsequent increases in dose level will occur as outlined under 5.1. after approval by [CONTACT_978]. 
5.6.2 Dosing R egimen

Introduction of Azacitidine and Dexamethasone  
After six 28- day cycles  on combination therapy, dexamethasone and azacitidine will be 
discontinued and lenalidomide will be continued as a single agent at the last tol erated 
dose until disease progression .  At physician discretion, for patients with response < PR

Version: 07/16/2015 escalated during maintenance treatment  to a maximum dose of 25mg daily on Days 1- 21 
of each 28- day cycle.  Lenalidomide dose titration may only occur at the start of a new 
cycle of maintenance one dose level at a time, and only in patients who completed the 
previous treatment cycle without dose modifications or treatment delays due to toxicity .  
Lenalidomide dose titration may occur NOT more frequently than once every 28 days.  
After 12 months since initiation of protocol therapy, no further lenalidomide dose titration is permitted.  Also for patients with response < PR after six 28-day cycles on combination therapy, dexamethasone and/or azacitidine may be continued or restarted (if 
it had been discontinued) at physician discretion.  In particular, patients with response < PR after six 28-day cycles on combination therapy that have not  shown sufficient signs of 
end organ improvement should be considered for lenalidomide dose titration and/or additional dexamethasone  and/ or azacitidine  as outlined above. Similarly, patients who 
have achieved disease control (stable disease or better) dur ing the first six 28 -day cycles 
of combination therapy and who ’s myeloma  progress es on maintenance therapy may be 
restarted on lenalidomide, azacitidine, and dexamethasone combination therapy at the last tolerated dose  at physician discretion .

will be no intra -individual dose escalation of azacitidine beyond 100mg/m2. 
 
5.7.3 Dose Re- Escalation Guidelines  
Dose  Re-Escalation Upon  Recovery  from Hematologic  Adverse Events  
 
If the dose of lenalidomide or azacitidine was reduced due to dose limiting hematologic 
toxicity and continued treatment results in improvement of bone marrow function, dose 
increases by [CONTACT_903061] a time may be performed if the ANC is ≥  1000 
/mm³ and pl atelets are ≥ 50,000 / mm³ at day one of the respective cycle  if the previous 
cycle was completed without dose modifications due to toxicity (regardless of type).  If patient’s myeloma has previously been refractory to lenal idomide consideration should 
be given to increase azacitidine first, otherwise lenalidomide should be increased first. In 
general, drug dosing increases should alternate between lenalidomide and azacitidine 
until target doses of both drugs are reached or toxicity occurs  but the treating physician 
may use clinical judgment and first increase one drug to target dose.  After 12 months since initiation of protocol therapy, no further lenalidomide dose titration is permitted.   
Dose  Re-Escalation Upon  Recovery  of Kidney  Function  
If the patient’s GFR increases from 30 -59ml/min at enrollment to > 60ml/min at the start 
of a cycle and the previous cycle was tolerated without need for dose reduction of lenalidomide due to any adverse event and no G -CSF or platelet tra nsfusions were 
required, the dose of lenalidomide may be increased by [CONTACT_903062] 2. If the dose of lenalidomide or azacitidine was reduced due to renal impairment  on 
study, and continued treatment results in calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60ml/min (by 
[CONTACT_12021]- Gault), the dose of lenalidomide and azacitidine can be increased by [CONTACT_903063] ≥ 60ml/mi n (by [CONTACT_12021]- Gault ) and no 
relationship between study drugs and renal impairment was suspected . If a relationship 
between study drugs and renal impairment is considered possible , drug increases should 
be done  one drug at a time and alternating between lenalidomide and azacitidine, starting 
with lenalidomide. Doses may be increased only in patients who completed the previous treatment cycle without dose modifications or treatment delays due to toxicity (regardless of type).  Dose increases may occur NOT mo re frequently than once every [ADDRESS_1266674] dose increase would be to 10 mg daily 
on Days 1 -21 every 28 days.  Additional dose increases if warranted would be in 5 mg 
increments.  After 12 months since initiation of protocol therapy, no further lenalidomide dose titration is permitted.

Version: 07/16/2015 5.7.4 Instructions for Initiation of a New Cycle  
A new course of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle if:  
• The ANC is ≥  1000/ mm³ (G-CSF is allowed to achieve this threshold)  
• The platelet count is ≥  50,000/ mm³ (During the first 4 cycles platelet transfusions 
are allowed to achieve this threshold)  
• Any new drug- related neuro pathy or rash  other than injection site reaction  that 
may have occurred has resolved to ≤ grade 1 severity;  
• Any bicarbonate decrease below 20mEq/L that m ay have occurred has resolved to 
baseline.  
• Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30ml/min (by [CONTACT_12021]- Gaul t), after 12 cycles 
on therapy, determining the creatinine clearance every 2 months will suffice 
• Any other drug -related adverse event s that may have occurred have resolved to ≤ 
grade [ADDRESS_1266675] not resolved to ≤ grade [ADDRESS_1266676] will be evaluated 
weekly and a new cycle of treatment will not be initiated until the toxicity has resolved as 
described above.  If criteria to initiate a new cycle are not met by 21 days after the planned start of a new cycle patients go off study. If a lenalidomide or azacitidine dose 
reduction was taken  during the pre vious cycle , and the cycle was completed  without 
requiring further dose modification , then the next  cycle will start at the same reduced 
dose.  If lenalidomide and / or azacitidine dosing was omitted for the remainder of 
the previous cycle or if the new cycle is delayed due to toxicity newly encountered on 
the scheduled Day 1 , then the new cycle will be started with a one- level dose reduction  
of lenalidomide  and/or azacitidine as appropriate.  Dose reductions should generally be 
taken one drug at a time based on attribution of toxicity to one of the drugs unless 
otherwise indicated in Section 5.7.3.   
5.7.5 Instructions for D ose Modifications  or Interruption D uring a Cycle 
Table 5 outlines instructions for dose reductions of study drugs for specific toxicities. Study drugs may be temporarily or permanently dose reduced using doses outlined in 
table 1 -4 or temporarily discontinued in other situations where their continued 
administration according to protocol is felt unsafe by [CONTACT_1963].

 Rotation of azacitidine injection sites is obligatory. Patients who nevertheless experience 
grade 1 -2 injection site reactions should be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_8746] (2.5% 
cream  recommended ) until resolution .  
5.8.2 Prohibited Concomitant T herapy  
Concomitant use of other anti -cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], thalidomide, or other investigational 
agents is not permitted while subjects are receiving protocol therapy on this study.  
Palliative radiation  (with the exception of pelvic radiation) is permitted.  
5.9 Discontinuation of S tudy T reatment  Including Progressive D isease D efinition   
Treatment will be discontinued in case of: 
• Progressive Disease (see under 5.9.1) 
• Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the Investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of the treatment regimen . 
• Delay of the start of a new cycle by [CONTACT_726] 21 days due insufficient recovery 
from  toxicity  
• Permanent discon tinuation of lenalidomide for any reason

Version: 07/16/2015 5.9.1 Progressive Disease  
Progressive disease (PD)  is defined according to the international uniform response 
criteria (Durie et al. Leukemia 20:1467- 73, 2006, ERRATUM Durie et al. Leukemia 
21:1134, 2007) and requires any of the following, confirmed on two consecutive 
assessments: 
An increase of 25% from lowest response value in any one or more  of the following: 
• Serum M -component (absolute increase must be >0.5 g/100 ml) * 
• Urine M -component (absolute increase must be >200mg per 24 h) 
• Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M -protein levels: the 
difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (absolute increase must 
be >100 mg/l) 
• Bone marrow plasma cell percentage (absolute % must be >10%) 
 And / or: 
• Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or 
definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas 
• Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium >11.5 mg/100 ml) that 
can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder  
 
*: If the starting serum m -protein level is > 5g/dL an absolute increase of > 1g/dL, verifie d 
on two consecutive measurements, is sufficient to define progressive disease.  
 The decision as to when to repeat the assessment to document progressive disease will be left at the discretion of the treating physician, there is no need to wait until the next scheduled response assessment .  
 
5.10 Follow- Up   
Subjects who discontinue treatment for any reason, will be followed every 3 months for 3 
years from study entry (if patients are no longer treated at this Institution attempts will be 
made to obtain information over the phone as per Schedule of Assessments, Section 2) . 
Patients, who stay on protocol therapy will be followed at least every 2 months according 
to schedule of study assessments (2) for [ADDRESS_1266680] dose of protocol therapy. 
6 Adverse E vents  
6.1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition  
A serious adverse event is one that at any dose (including overdose): 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening 1 
 Confidential   Page 50 of 71  
         
 
Version: 07/16/2015 • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 2 
• Is a congenital  anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event 3 
• Pregnancy 
 
 1“Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the 
time of the serious adverse event; it does not refer to a serious adverse event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
2“Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions. 3Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether 
expedited reporting is appropriate in situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred.  Important medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_903026].  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment should be considered as medically important.  
6.2 Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting  
Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE Version 4.0 for toxicity and adverse event 
reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP 
homepage ( HTTP://CTEP.INFO.NIH .GOV
).  All ap propriate treatment areas should 
have access to a copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0.  All Grade [ADDRESS_1266681] drug, and the patient’s outcome.  The investigator must evaluate each adverse experience for its relationship to the test drug and for its seriousness. 
 The investigator must appraise all abnorm al laboratory results for their clinical 
significance.  If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator must provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s outcome.

Version: 07/16/2015 6.2.1 Dose Limiting Toxicity R eporting  
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as one of the following drug- related toxicities 
occurring during the first 28- day cycle (if a DLT is attributed to progressive disease, it 
will not be counted as a DLT): 
• Any CTCAE v.4.0 grade > 3 non hematologic toxicity (including febrile 
neutropenia)  
o For nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, subjects must have a Grade 3 or 4 
event that persists at this level despi[INVESTIGATOR_903016], in order for these events to be considered a DLT 
o Grade 4 transaminitis (serum transaminase > 20 x upper limit of normal [ULN]) is a DLT, while Grade 3 transaminitis (serum transaminase > 5 x 
and ≤  [ADDRESS_1266682]) must be present for ≥ 7 days to be considered a DLT  
o Grade 3 or 4 venous thromboembolic events are not considered to be 
DLTs as long as anticoagulant therapy can be administered (see Section 6.5.3 and 6.6.2) 
o Grade 3 or 4 hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia or hyponatremia that responds to electrolyte supplementation within 7 days would not qualify as a DLT.  
 
• CTCAE v.4.0 grade > 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia that does not resolve to 
grade < [ADDRESS_1266683]’s last dose of 
lenalidomide or azacitidine are considered expedited reportable events.  If the subject is 
on lenalidomide  or azacitidine , both drugs  are to be discontinued immediately and the 
subject is to be instructed to  return any unused portion of lenalidomide to the 
Investigator.  The pregnancy must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of 
the Investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy by [CONTACT_202158].  
 The Investigator will follow  the pregnant female  until completion of the pregnancy, and 
must notify Celgene Drug Safety of the outcome as specified below.  The Investigator will provide this information as a follow -up to the initial SAE.

Version: 07/16/2015 If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the cri teria for immediate classification as a SAE 
(i.e., spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be 
documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for Expedit ed R eporting of SAEs to Celgene (i.e., report the event 
to Celgene Drug Safety by [CONTACT_31950] 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event).  
 Any suspected fetal exposure to lenalidomide or azacitidine must be reported to Celgene 
within 24 hours of being made aware of the event.  The pregnant female  should be 
referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.  All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_1266684] to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to lenalidomide or azacitidine should also be 
reported.  In the case of a live “normal” birth, Celgene Drug Safety should be advised as soon as the information is available.

Appendix I: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable 
Birth C ontrol Methods   
Risks Associated with Pregnancy  
The use of lenalidomide in pregnant females and nursing mothers has not been studied 
nor has the effect of the lenalidomide on human eggs and sperm.  The risks to a fetus are not known.  However, because lenalidomide is related to thalidomide, and thalidomide is known to cause severe birth defects, the following requirements must be observed. 
All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist®  program, and be 
willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist® . 
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)
† must agree to use two reliable forms of 
contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual 
intercourse during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide ; 2) while participating in the study; and 3) for at least [ADDRESS_1266714] include one highly effective method (i.e. intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal [birth 
control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, or implants], tubal ligation, partner’s vasectomy) and one additional effective (barrier) method (i.e. latex condom, diaphragm, cervical cap).  FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods if needed.   
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple 
myeloma taking lenalidomide and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_903033].  If a 
patient is being treated with a regimen  combining lenalidomide and dexamethasone and 
is currently using combined oral contraception, the patient should switch to one of the 
other highly effective contraceptive methods listed above.  The risk of venous 
thromboembolism continues for 4−6 weeks after discontinuing combined oral 
contraception.  The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced during co -
treatment with dexamethasone.  
 
 Before starting lenalidomide:   
Female Subj ects:    
• FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) 
prior to prescribing lenalidomide .  The first pregnancy test must be performed 
within [ADDRESS_1266715] 
                                                 
 † A female of childbearing potential is a  sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a 
hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or  2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 
consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).  
  
 Confidential   Page 66 of 71  
         
 
Version: 07/16/[ADDRESS_1266716] be  performed within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide  
(prescriptions must be filled within 7 days).  The subject may not receive 
lenalidomide until the Investigator has verified that the results of these pregnancy 
tests are negative.  
 
Male Subjects:   
• Must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_329222] 28 days 
following discontinuation from the study even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.  
During study participation and for 28 days following discontinuation from the study:  
All Subjects:  
• If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study subject or the 
partner of a male study subject during study participation, lenalidomide must be 
immedia tely discontinued. 
Female Subjects:    
• FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly for the first [ADDRESS_1266717] 28 days and then every 14 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28 following discontinuation from the study.   
• In addition to the required pregnancy testing, the Investigator must confirm with 
FCBP that she is continuing to use two reliable methods of birth control at each 
visit.   
• Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a subject misses her 
period or if her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal.  
Lenalidomide treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation.  
Male Subjects:  
• Must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_202179] 28 days 
following discontinuation from the study even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy .

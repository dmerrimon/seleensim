6 Study Description: 
This is an open-label study evaluating the safety and tolerability of SAGE-[ADDRESS_244078] a confirmed diagnosis of MCI or mild dementia due to AD, according 
to the National Institute o
n Aging-Alzheimer’s Association 2011 diagnostic guidelines, w hich will 
be confirmed via the Clinical Dementia Rating Dementia
 Staging  Instrument® (C DR). P articipants 
will self
-adminis ter 3.0 
mg of SAGE-718 once daily in the morning for 14 days within 1 hour after 
initiating a meal containing approximately 30 
g of fat. Dosing and 
morning food intake will be 
tracked in a participant diary. A ssessments will be performed as outlined in 
the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 2)  
In the setting of public health advisories due to COVID-19,  asses
sments scheduled to be  conducted 
at the study site may
 be performed via telephone/video if feasible.  For assessments that cannot be 
conducted by [CONTACT_630], an in-home visit may be conducted.  
Screening Period 
The Screening Period w ill begin with the informed
 consent process f or prospective participants, 
including study partners. Subsequent screening assessments will be performed between Day -21 and 
Day -8 to determine eligibility, including but not limited to: assessments of , vital 

Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA-201 Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
7 signs, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG),  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  of the 
brain , and C-SSRS. 
An electroencephalogram ( EEG ) will also be performed for all participants during Screening. 
Baseline Period  
The Baseline Period will occur from Day -7 through Day -1. During this period, each participant will 
receive dietary counseling to aid in choosing a morning meal containing approximately 30 g of fat to 
consume prior to dosing. On Day -7 (± 1 day) , participants will visit the clinic for confirmation of 
continued eligibility and collection of baseline  safety data. Additionally, participants 
will be t
rained on the use of a mobile data capture device to perform  and to document 
. Participants will continue to complete these assessments daily during the Baseline 
Period, using the mobi le device remotely (at home ), with the support of a study partner. On Day -1, 
participants will return to the study site for confirmation of continued eligibility and collection of 
further baseline  safety data.  
Treatment Period  
Beginning on Day 1 and continuing through Day 14, participants will self- administer 3.0 mg of 
SAGE -718 (as six 0.5-mg oral tablets), once per day in the morning within 1 hour after initiating a 
meal containing approximately 30 g of fat, in accordance with the guidelines provided in a nutritional 
information brochure. During this period, participants will continue to complete daily assessments of 
 via mobile device either remotely (at home) or in the clinic (at 
scheduled in -clin
ic visits ) and will track investigational product ( IP) dosing and predose food intake 
in a participant diary.  
On Day 1, Day 7 (±1 day), and Day 14, participants will arrive at the clinic in the morning prior to IP dosing and c ompletion of daily mobile device tasks. Following predose procedures (ie,  body weight, 
vital signs, ECG, followed by [CONTACT_204575],  and 
), pa
rt
icipants will eat a morn ing meal, t hen take the IP and 
complete the mobile device tasks under staff supervision.  
At schedule
d clinic visits during the Treatment Period,  study staff will dispense a sufficient amount of 
SAGE -[ADDRESS_244079] participants by [CONTACT_45347] 4 to document any TEAEs and/or changes in 
concomitant medications.  
Follow-up Period 
Study staff will contact [CONTACT_204576] 21 (±1  day)  to document any TEAEs and/or 
changes in concomitant medications. Participants will return to the clinic on Day 28 (±2  days)  for a 
follow-up visit.  
Dose Evaluation Committee 
At any time during the study, Sage may elect to form a Dose Evaluation Committ ee (DEC) . If 
convened, this DEC will review the available data and provide recommendations for adjusting the 
dose, administration schedule, and/ or food intake and make adjustments  for subsequent participants , 
if appropriate (see Section  7.4.2).  
Number of Participants (planned): Up to 22 participants will be dosed to obtain up to 
20 participants that complete 14  days of dosing in this study. Additional participants may be dosed if 
the early discontinuation rate is >10%.

22 5. INTRODUCTION 
Diminished ability to learn and remember new information is the clinical hallmark of 
Alzheimer’s disease ( AD) and is associated with decreased quality of life and impaired 
functioning. Primary memory impairment tends to be followed by [CONTACT_204578], attention, executive functions, and visuospatial abilities 
(Weintraub  2012 ). SAGE -[ADDRESS_244095] disruptions in these large- scale 
neuroanatomical networks through positive allosteric  activity at N-Methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA)  
receptors . 
A subtype of glutamate receptors, NMDA receptors have a fundamental and well -documented 
role in regulating synaptic strength, health, and plasticity. The NMDA receptor antagonist 
memantine is approved as a treatment for AD, targeting glutamate excitotoxicity in later stages of the disease. However, blockade of NMDA receptor signaling can result in impaired 
neuroplasticity and cognitive deficits ( Molinuevo 2005). Administration of a  short- term NMDA 
partial agonist (D -cycloserine)  in a small study of AD patie nts improved their scores on the 
cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment S cale, suggesting that NMDA-
enhancing agents can benefit  cognition in AD ( Tsai 1999).  
SAGE -718 is a novel, oxysterol- based , positive allosteric modulator of NMDA receptors that 
modulates the response to endogenous glutamate ( Paul 2013). SAGE -718 only affects receptor 
function in the presence of endogenous glutamate, thus it does not directly activate the receptor and is not expected to cause glutamatergic excitotoxicity. SAGE -718 has been well tolerated in 
both healthy participants and a small cohort of Huntington’s disease participants in previous clinical studies. However, based on nonclinical findings, the US Food and Drug A dministration 
imposed a maximum median concentration (C
max) cap of 45 ng/mL. To date, clinical studies 
have used doses that resulted in exposures within this cap; neither serious adverse events ( SAEs ) 
nor AEs leading to discontinuation have been reported. A once-daily 3-mg dose of SAGE -718 is 
not predicted to exceed a median C max of 45 ng/mL. For additional information on exposure caps, 
see the SAGE -718 Investigator’s Brochure. 
A direct correlation between SAGE -718 Oral Tablet exposure and fat intake has been observed 
in healthy adults, with significantly lower exposure in fasting participants than in the same 
participants after moderate and high fat-containing meals. Additionally, as fat levels increased, 
exposure variability decreased, allowing for more pr edictable C max levels. Thus, in this study 
SAGE -718 will be administered after consumption of a morning meal containing approximately 
30 g of fat . Based on the data from healthy participants, this regimen is projected to produce a 
median C max of approximately 35 to 40 ng/mL at steady state.  
The safety, tolerability, and  of SAGE -718 Oral Tablet will be evaluated in this 
open- label study in individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
or mild dementia due to AD with otherwise stable neuropsychiatric symptoms. Additional data on the effects of SAGE -[ADDRESS_244096] a confirmed diagnosis of MCI or mild dementia due to AD, 
according to the National Institute on Aging- Alzhei mer’s Association 2011 diagnostic 
guidelines, which will be confirmed via the Clinical Dementia Rating  Dementia Staging 
Instrument® ( CDR ). Participants will self -administer 3.0 mg of SAGE-718 once daily in the 
morning for 14 days within 1  hour after initia ting a meal containing approximately 30 g of fat. 
Dosing and morning food intake will be tracked in a participant diary. Assessments will be 
performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 )  
. 
At any ti
me during the study, Sa ge may elect to form a Dose Evaluation Committee (DEC). If 
convened, this DEC will review the available data and provide recommendations for adjusting 

Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA-201 Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
25 the dose, administration schedule, and/or food intake and make adjustments for subsequent 
participants, i f appropriate (see Section  7.4.2).  
In the setting of public health advisories related  to COVID-19, assessments scheduled to be 
conducted at the study site may be performed via telephone/video if feasible. For assessments that cannot be conducted by [CONTACT_630], an in-home visit may be conducted. 
7.1.1. Screening Period  
The Screening Period will begin with the informed consent process for prospective participants, 
including study pa
rtners. Subsequent screening assessments will be performed between Day -21 
and Day  -8 to determine eligibility, including but not limited to: assessments of  
, vital s
igns, clinical laboratory tests, electroc ardiogra m (ECG),  magnetic resonance 
imaging  (MRI) of the brain, and C- SSRS.  An electroencephalogram ( EEG ) will also be 
performed for all participants during Screening. 
7.1.2. Baseline 
Period  
The Baseline Period will occur from Day -7 through Day -1. During this period, each participant 
will rec
eive dietary counseling to aid in choosing a morning meal containing approximately 30 g 
of fat to consume prior to dosing. On Day - 7 (±1 day), participants will visit the clinic for 
confirmation of continued eligibility and collection of baseline  safety data. 
Additionally, participants will be trained on the use of a mobile data capture device  
 Participants will continue to complete these 
assessments dail y during the Baseline Period, using the mobile device remotely (at home), with 
the support of a study partner. On Day - 1, participants will return to the study site for 
confirmation of continued eligibility and collection of further baseline  safety data.  
7.1.3. Treatment 
Period  
Beginning on Day 1 and continuing through Day 14, participants will self-administer 3.0 mg of 
SAGE 718 (as
 six 0.5-mg oral tablets), once per day in the morning within 1 hour after initiating 
a meal containing approximately 30 g of fat, in accordance with the guidelines provided in a nutritional information brochure. During this period, parti cipants will continue to complete daily 
assessments  via mobile device either remotely (at home) or 
in the clinic 
(at scheduled clinic visits) and will track investigative product ( IP) dosing and 
predose food intake in a participant diary.  
On Day 1, Day 7 (±1 day), and Day 14, participants will arrive at the clinic in the morning prior 
to IP dosing and completion of daily mobile device tasks. Following predose procedures 
(ie, body weight, vital signs, ECG, followed by [CONTACT_204579],  participants will eat a morning 
meal, then t
ake the IP and complete the mobile device tasks under staff supervision. 
At scheduled c
linic visits during the Treatment Period, study staff will dispense a sufficient 
amount of SAGE-[ADDRESS_244097] participants by [CONTACT_45347] 4 to document any 
TEAEs and/or changes in concomitant medications. 

Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA-[ADDRESS_244098] participants by [CONTACT_45347] 21 (±1 day) to document any TEAEs 
and/or changes in concomitant medications. Participants will return to the clinic on Day  28 
(±2 days ) for a follow -up visit.  
7.2. Number of Participants  
Up to 22 participants are planned to be dosed to obtain up to 20 participants that complete 14 days of dosing in this study. Additional participants may be dosed if the early discontinuation 
rate is greater t han 10%. 
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
In this open- label study, all participants will receive 3.[ADDRESS_244099] to identify evidence of seizure activity 
(see Section  12.1.6) . Should the independent epi[INVESTIGATOR_204555] a subclinical or

8.3. Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently assigned to study intervention or are not entered in the study. A minimal set of screen failure information will be collected, including demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any SAEs.  
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA-[ADDRESS_244112] Discontinuation  
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request for any reason. 
The investigator may discontinue a participant from the study and/or from IP for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. 
The reason for IP discontinuation and/or the reason for early termination from the study must be 
documented in the participant’s study record and recorded in the participant’s electronic case report form (eCRF).  
The investigator must notify the sponsor and/or the medical monitor when a participant stops participation in the study for any reason. 
Participants who discontinue IP will be invited by [CONTACT_204580] (except IP administration) through the end of the 
Treatment Period (Day  14). Those who decline continued participation through Day 14 will be 
asked to complete an Early Termination Visit.  
8.4.2.  Early Termination from the Study  
For participants who are terminated from the study early, if possible, an Early Termination Visit should be conducted as described in Table 2 . The participant will be permanently discontinued 
both from the IP and from the study at that time. 
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor will retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records.  
8.4.3. Loss to Follow Up 
A participant will be deemed lost to follow  up after [ADDRESS_244113]

31 9.2. Prior Medications, Concomitant Medications, Restrictions, and 
Contraception Requirements  
9.2.1. Prior and Concomitant Medications and/or Supplements  
To be eligible to participate in this study, any concomitant medications must have been taken at a 
stable dose and frequency for at least [ADDRESS_244114] IP administration and be expected to remain stable for the 
duration of the study. 
The start and end dates, route, dose/units, frequency, and indication for all relevant medications 
and/or supplements will be recorded at Screening. Medications  to be recorded include all 
psychotropic medications used  within 12 weeks of informed consent, any other medications and 
supplements taken within 60 days of informed consent, and all medication  used to treat AD, 
regardless of timing. After  Screening, all changes to any medication or supplements should be 
captured. All medicatio ns and/or supplements taken from the first dose of IP through the final 
study visit (including start and end dates, route, dose/units, frequency, and indication) will be 
recorded on the eCRF.  
Because this study aims to measure effects on cognitive performance, it is important to evaluate single or combined concomitant medications and their doses for their potential effects on 
cognition. Investigators will carefully review concomitant medications for possible cognitive 
effects at Screening to determine parti cipant eligibility and throughout the study. 
9.2.2. Prohibited Medications  
Treatment with an investigational drug or device is prohibited within the 30 days (or 5 half -lives 
of the IP, whichever is longer) prior to Screening and until the final follow-up visit.  
During the course of the study, adjustment of medication or addition of medications that are known to affect cognitive performance (eg, stimulants, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], antipsychotics, 
anticholinergics) is to be avoided as much as possible. Any medication deter mined necessary for 
the welfare of the participant may be given at the discretion of the investigator at any time during 
the study, however, the use of any prohibited medications will be captured as a protocol 
deviation. 
Use of the following medications is prohibited during the entire course of the study: 
• Medications with potent effects at the NMDA receptor, including memantine, 
amantadine, ketamine, cycloserine, or related compounds  
• Medications that inhibit cholesterol absorption (eg, ezetimibe)  
• Bile acid sequestrants (eg, colesevelam, colestipol, cholestyramine)  
• Other medications given at doses or in combinations that are likely to have a deleterious effect on cognitive performance, as described in the 2019 American

Use in Older Adults ( American Geriatrics Society 2019 ) 
• Prescribed cannabis or other THC-containing substances 
9.2.3. Other Restrictions  
Participants must agree not to consum e alcohol or any drugs of abuse (including marijuana) 
during the study. 
9.2.4. Acceptable Forms of Contraception  
Acceptable forms of highly effective contraception for participants of childbearing potential or 
for partners of male participants who are of childbearing potential include: 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) oral, intravaginal, or transdermal hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
• Oral, injectable, or implantable progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
• Intrau terine device  
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral tubal occlusion (performed at least 3 months prior to screening) 
• Vasectomized partner (performed at least 3 months prior to screening) 
• Sexual abstinence (no sexual intercourse)  
Acceptable forms of contraception for male participants include:  
• Sexual abstinence (no sexual intercourse) 
• History of vasectomy (performed at least 3 months prior to screening) 
• Condom with spermicide used together with highly effective female contraceptive methods if the female partner(s) is of childbearing potential (see above for list of acceptable female contraceptive methods)  
9.3. Intervention after the End of the Study  
Not applicable.  
9.4. Treatment Adherence  
The investigator(s) or designated staff will observe the participant taking the first dose of IP to identify any potential risks to adherence (such as difficulty opening the packaging or swallowing the tablets). The time and dose of IP administration will be noted in the source documents. The 
clinician will provide instructions for self -administration of the IP and train the participant to 
track adherence to the IP regimen and food intake in a participant diary. At the Day  1, and Day [ADDRESS_244115] Packaging and Labeling  
SAGE -718 Oral Tablets are packaged in high density polyethylene bottles with desiccant, 
induction seal, and child- resistant closures.  
The composition and pharmaceutical quality of the oral tablet will be maintained according to 
current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). Labels with all required information and 
conforming to all applicable Code of Federal Regulations and GMP/Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) guidelines and all other applicable regulations will be prepared by [CONTACT_135482]. The 
site pharmacist or designee will prepare labels for individual doses. 
10.3. Investigational Product Storage  
SAGE -[ADDRESS_244116] Administration  
Each 3.0- mg dose of IP will be self -administered as 6 tablets containing 0.5 mg of SAGE -718, 
once daily in the morning within 1 hour after initiating  a meal containing approximately 30 g of 
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA-201 Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
34 fat. Participants a re to swallow the tablets whole with approximately 240 mL (8  fluid ounces) of 
water. For doses taken in the clinic, site staff will watch the participant self -administer the IP.  
10.6. Investigational Product Accountability, Handling, and Disposal  
Upon receipt of IP, the pharmacist will inspect the IP and complete and follow the instructions 
regarding receipt and storage in the SAGE -718 Investigator’s Brochure and in the pharmacy 
manual. A copy of the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_135429]. The IP provided is 
for use only as directed in this protocol. 
The investigator or designee must keep a record of all IP received, used, and returned/discarded. 
If dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered by [CONTACT_135477]’s designee, the 
sponsor must be notified immediately. 
Designated site staff will dispense the IP to participants at weekly clinic visits as outlined in the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 ). 
The investigator, pharmacist, or qualified designee is responsible for drug accountability, 
reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). 
Sage Therapeutics or designee will be permitted access to the study supplies at any time with 
appropriate notice during or after completion of the study to perform drug accountability reconciliation. At the end of the study, any unused IP will be returned to Sage Therapeutics for 
destruction or destroyed locally per standard operating procedures at the site; disposition of IP 
will be documented. 
More detailed informat ion can be found in the SAGE -718 Investigator’s Brochure and in the 
pharmacy manual.  
10.7. Product Complaints  
A product complaint is any written, electronic, or verbal expression of dissatisfaction regarding 
the identity, quality, reliability, safety, purity, potency, effectiveness or performance (applicable for approved marketed products) of a drug product after it is released for distribution. 
In the course of conduct of the study, study personnel may become aware of a product complaint 
associated with the use of a Sage product. Personnel shall notify Sage within [ADDRESS_244117] complaint until further instruction is provided by [CONTACT_204581](s).  
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA-[ADDRESS_244118] intervals (heart rate, PR, 
QRS, QT, and QTcF) as well as any rhythm abnormalities will be recorded. 
Electrocardiograms will be performed after the participant has been resting in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_49844] 5 minutes. When ECG measurements coincide with safety assessments, vital signs 
assessm ent or blood draws, procedures should be carried out in said order (vital signs, ECG, 
blood draw). 
12.1.6. Electroencephalogram  
During Screening, EEG monitoring using the 10 to 20 international system for EEG electrode 
placement will occur for a duration of 1 hour. The assessment may be performed on any single day during the Screening Period, at any time of day, but preferably not while the participant is in a fasted state.  
If clinical events suspi[INVESTIGATOR_204558] (eg , epi[INVESTIGATOR_204559]/or involuntary motor behaviors), an unscheduled 1-hour EEG will be 
performed for safety. A n additional  1-hour EEG may be performed at the discretion of the 
investigator to follow up on results from any unscheduled EEG. The EEG recording will be reviewed by [CONTACT_204582][INVESTIGATOR_204560] (eg, spi[INVESTIGATOR_204561]), subclinical seizure (eg,  synchronous sharp waves and/or 
synchronous spi[INVESTIGATOR_204562]), seizure corresponding to a clinical event, or changes 
consistent with a postseizure state (eg,  focal slowing and/or diffuse slowing). Should the 
independent epi[INVESTIGATOR_204555] a subclinical or clinical seizure, dosing with SAGE -718 will be stopped for that participant. All EEG abnormalities suggestive of seizure risk 
or postseizure state will be reviewed by [CONTACT_138830]. 
12.1.7. Laboratory Assessments 
Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory assessments will be collected. will be collected 
for hematology, biochemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, and serology at the time points detailed in Table 2  and Table 3.  
During Screening only, samples for clinical laboratory assessments will be collected from participants when they are in a fasted state.  
Analytes to be evaluated are summarized in  Table 4. 
Table 4: Summary of Clinical Laboratory Analytes 
Biochemistry  Renal Panel: glucose, calcium, phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen, 
creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate 
Hepatic Panel: albumin, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, direct

Follicle stimulating hormone testing will be conducted to confirm whether a participant with 
≥12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea meets the protocol- defined criteria for being 
postmenopausal. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Testing  
Serum pregnancy (human chorionic gonadotropin) tests will be conducted for all female 
participants during Screening; urine pregnancy tests will be conducted for all female participants 
that are not postmenopausal or surgically sterile at other scheduled time points. A urine 
pregnancy test will also be performed as part of the early termination assessments for participants who discontinue the study early. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Drugs of Abuse and Alcohol  
Testing for selected drugs of abuse will be performed via urine dipstick at the study site 
(eg, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cannabinoids, cocaine, THC, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]). 
Alcohol use will be tested by [CONTACT_204583].  
12.1.8. Columbia –Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C- SSRS ( Posner 2011). This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the participant with 
suicidal ideation and behavior, and a postbaseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last study visit. The C-SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from [ADDRESS_244119] severe). 
The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at Screening (lifetime history and 
past 24 months). The “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will b e completed at all subsequent time 
points outlined in Table [ADDRESS_244120] to assess for the presence of non-AD pathology that could account for the 
participant’s  observed cognitive impairment, and  the site investigator will determine the clinical 
significance of these findings. 
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA-[ADDRESS_244121] a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with onset after the start of IP, or any worsening of a 
preexisting  medical condition/adverse event with onset after the start of IP and throughout the 
study. The term IP includes any Sage IP, a comparator, or a placebo administered in a clinical study. 
Laboratory abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs, and ECGs are consider ed AEs 
if they result in discontinuation or interruption of study treatment, require therapeutic medical 
intervention, meet protocol- specific criteria (if applicable) or if the investigator  considers them to 
be clinically significant. Any abnormalities that meet the criteria for a n SAE should be reported 
in an expedited manner. Laboratory abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs and ECGs that are clearly attributable to another AE do not require discrete reporting (eg, electrolyte 
disturbances in the context of dehydration, chemistry and hematologic disturbances in the context of sepsis). 
All AEs that occur after any participant has signed the informed consent and throughout the 
duration of the study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be reported to Sage Therapeutics.  
Subjects who discontinue the IP due to an AE, regardless of investigator- determined causality, 
should be followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the investigator determines the event is no longe r clinically significant. Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant’s last 
AE assessment in the study are followed up by [CONTACT_24549], but without further recording in the eCRF. The Sponsor or its representative retains the right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 
12.2.2. Serious Adverse Event Definition  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Places the participant  at immediate risk of death (a life -threatening event); however, 
this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death  
• Requires inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103296]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA-201 Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
45 • Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_204563] 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
All SAEs that occur after any participant has signed the informed consent form ( ICF) and 
throughout the duration of the study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE report form provided by [CONTACT_135482]. Any SAE that is ongoing when 
the participant completes their final study visit, will be followed by [CONTACT_204584], stabilized, returned to baseline status, or until the participant dies or is lost to 
follow up. 
A prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered an 
SAE, even if the participant is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. The site must document all of the following: 
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the participant’s consent to participate in the study. 
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_85292], between the participant’s consent to participate in the study and at the time of the procedure or treatment.  
12.2.3. Relationship to Investigational Product 
The investigator must make the determination of relationship to the IP for each adverse event 
(not related, related). The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the relationship of AEs and SAEs to the IP. 
Not Related  An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the IP if there is not a reasonable 
possibility that the event has been caused by [CONTACT_33249]. Factors pointing towards this 
assessment include but are not limited to: the lack of temporal relationship between 
administration of the IP and the event, the presence of biologically implausible 
relationship between the product and the AE, or the presence of a more likely alternative explanation for the AE . 
Related  An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the IP if there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_95107]. Factors that point towards this assessment include but are not limited to: a positive 
rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the drug and 
the event, a known response pattern of the s uspected drug, improvement following 
discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the drug and the AE, or a lack of alternative explanation for the AE. 
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA-201 Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
46 12.2.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_4538]/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235]. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome and seriousness (if applicable), and whether or not it caused the participant to discontinue the IP or withdraw early from the study. 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale: 
• Mild: symptom(s) barely noticeable to participant or does not make participant 
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s) 
• Moderate: symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make participant uncomfortable; performance of daily activity is influenced; participant is able to continue in study; treatment for symptom(s) may be needed  
• Severe: symptom (s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or 
significant impact on participant’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of treatment with IP; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or participant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_204564]. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_204585]  12.2.2. An AE of severe intensity may 
not necessarily be considered serious. 
12.2.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE(s), the study site 
must notify Sage or designee within 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aware of the 
SAE(s). The investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE report form, verify the accuracy 
of the information recorded on the SAE report form with the corresponding source documents, 
and send a copy to Sage or designee. 
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage or designee 
within 24 hours of receipt on a follow-up SAE report form and placed with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or study file. 
Serious adverse events occurring after the designated follow-up time for the study, should be 
reported to Sage or designee according to the timelines noted above only if the investigator considers the SAE related to IP. 
Sage, or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events. It is the principal investigator ’s responsibility to notify the IRB/IEC of all SAEs that 
occur at his o r her site . Investigator s will also be notified of all suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) that occur during the clinical study. IRBs/IECs  will be notified of 
SAEs and/or S[LOCATION_003]Rs as required by [CONTACT_1769]. 
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA-201 Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
47 Sage, or designee, will submit S [LOCATION_003]Rs (in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies 
according to local law and investigators. 
12.3. Pregnancy  
If a participant becomes pregnant after the first administration of IP, pregnancy information must 
be collected and recorded on the Pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_244122] pregnancy information on any participant’s partner who becomes pregnant after the participant has received the first 
administration of IP. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant 
partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnanc y reporting procedures specified 
for pregnant participants. 
The participant or participant’s partner will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. The outcome of all pregnancies (eg, spontaneous abortion, elective abortion, normal birth) must be followed and documented even if the participant was discontinued from the study. 
The investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant or participant’s partner and 
the neonate, and the information will be forwarded to Sage or designee. Generally, follow-up 
will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of 
anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_135445] a contraceptive medication. Any complication during 
pregnancy (eg, anemia, infections, pre eclampsia) should be reported as an AE/SAE . If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death,), the investigator should follow the procedures 
for reporting an SAE. 
12.4. Overdose  
An overdose is any dose of study treatment given to a participant or taken by a participant that exceeds the dose described in protocol. Overdoses are not considered AEs and should not be 
recorded as an AE on the eCRF; however, all overdoses must be recorded on an overdose form 
and sen t to Sage or designee within [ADDRESS_244123] be recorded. 
13. STATISTICS  
Detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study will be provided in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock. 
Any changes/additions to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the 
clinical study report.  
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA-[ADDRESS_244124] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS 
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a participant into the study, a representative of Sage 
Therapeutics will visit the investigational study site per Sage standard operating procedures to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Sage Therapeutics or its 
representatives. This will be documented in a Clinical Trial Agreement between Sage 
Therapeutics and the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics or representa tive will have regular contacts 
with the investigational site, for the following: 
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s) 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that IP accountability checks are 
being performed 
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case report forms with the participant’s medical records at the ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and 
other records relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each participant (eg, clinic charts). 
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics. 
• Confirm AEs a nd SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to Sage Therapeutics and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB or IEC. 
The monitor will be available between visits if the investiga tor(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice. 
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Sage Therapeutics or authorized representatives of Sage Therapeutics, a regulatory authority, or an Independent Ethics Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform 
an audit(s) or inspection(s), including source data verification. The purpose of a Sage 
Therapeutics audit or a regulatory authority inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to determine  whether these activities were 
conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP  and/or International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) GCP guidelines, and any 
applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator should contact [CONTACT_7240] a regulatory agency or IRB/ IEC about an inspection. 
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA-[ADDRESS_244125] obtain IRB (or IEC) approval for the clinical study prior to 
enrolling a participant. Initial IRB (or IEC) approval, and all materials approved by [CONTACT_1201] (or 
IEC) for this study including the participant consent form and recruitment materials must be 
maintained by [CONTACT_204586]. 
15. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
To ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practice and all applicable regulatory requirements, 
Sage Therapeutics may conduct a quality assurance audit(s) at the clinical site. Please see 
Section  14.[ADDRESS_244126] adequate quality control practices to ensure that the study is 
performed in a manner consistent with the protocol, GCP/ICH GCP guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator is responsible for reviewing all identified protocol deviations. Significant protocol deviations should be reported to the IRB/ IEC per the IRB/ IEC’s 
written procedures.  
The investigator is responsible for supervising any individual or party to whom the investigator 
delegates study-related duties and functions conducted at the study site. When the investigator 
retains the services of any individual or party to perform study-related duties and functions, the investigator must ensure the individual or party is qualified to perform study- related duties and 
functions and should implement procedures to ensure the integrity of the study- related duties and 
functions performed, and any data generated. 
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate source documents and study records that

6 Study Description: 
This is an open-label study evaluating the safety and tolerability of SAGE-[ADDRESS_244136] a confirmed diagnosis of MCI or mild dementia due to AD, according 
to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer ’s Association [ADDRESS_244137]® Dementia Staging Instrument.  Participants will self-administer 
3.0 mg of 
SAGE-7 18 once daily in the morning for 14 days within 1 hour after initiating a meal containing 
approximately 30 g of fat. Dosing and morning food intake will be tracked in a participant diary. 
Assessments will be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2)  
 
Screening Period 
The Screenin g Perio d will begin with the informe d consent process for prospective participants, 
including study partners. 
Subsequ ent screenin g assessments will be performed between Day -21 and 
Day -8 to determine eligibility, including bu t not limi ted to: assessments of , vital 
signs, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), and C-SSRS. 
An electroencephalogram (EEG ) will also be performed for all participants during Scree ning, 
preferabl y not in a fasted state. 
Baselin e Period 
The Baselin e Perio d will occur from Day -7 throu gh Day -1. During this p eriod, each participa nt will 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA -201 Version 1 CONFIDENTIAL  
7 receive dietar y counseling to aid in choos ing a morning meal containing appro ximately 30 g of fat to 
consume prior to dosing. On Day -7 (±1 day) , participants will visit the clinic for confirmation of 
continued eligibility and collection of baseline  safety data. Additionally, participants 
will be trained o n the use of a mobile data capture device  
 Participants will continue to co mplete these assessm ents daily during the Baseline 
Period, usin g the mobile d evice remotely (at home), with the support of a study partner. On Day -1, 
participants will return to the stud y site for confirmatio n of contin ued eligibility and collection of 
furth er baseline  
safety data. 
Treatment Period 
Beginning on Day 1 and contin uing through Day 14, participants will self-administer 3.0 mg of 
SAGE-71 8 (as six 0.5-mg oral tablets), once per day in the morning within [ADDRESS_244138] ance with the guidelines provided in a nutritional 
informatio n brochu re. During this period, participants will continue to complete d aily assessments  
 via mobile device either remotely (at home) or in the clinic (at 
scheduled in-clinic visits) and will track investigational product (I P) dosing and predose food intake 
in a participant diary. 
On Day 1, Day 7 (±1 day), and Day 14, participants will arrive at the clinic in the mornin g prior t o IP 
dosing and com
pletion of daily mobile device tasks. Following predose procedures (ie, body weight, 
vital signs, ECG, followed b y blood and urin e collectio n for clinical laboratory analyses,  
 participants will 
eat a mornin g meal, then take the IP and 
complete th e mobile device tasks under staff supervision. 
At scheduled clinic visits during the Treatment Period, study staff will dispense a sufficient amount of 
SAGE-[ADDRESS_244139] participants by [CONTACT_45347] 4 to document any TEAEs and/or changes in 
concomitant medications. 
Follow-up Period 
Study staff will contact [CONTACT_4317] b y telephone on Day 21 (±1 day) to docum ent any TEAEs and /or 
changes in con comitant medication
s. Participants will return to the clinic o n Day 28 (±2 days) fo r a 
follow-up visit
. 
Dose Evaluatio n Committee 
At any time durin g the study, 
Sage may elect to form a Dose Evaluatio n Committee (DEC) . If 
conven ed, this DEC will review the available d
ata and provide recommendatio ns for adjustin g the 
dose, administratio n schedu le, and/or food intake and make adjustments for subsequent participants , 
if appropriate (see Section 7.4.2 ). 
Number of Participants (planned): Up to 22  participants will be dosed to obtain up to 
20 participants that complete 14  days of dosing in this study. Additional participants may be dosed if 
the early discontinuation rate is >10%.

21 5. INTRODUCTION  
Diminished  ability to learn and remember new information is the clinical hallmark of 
Alzheimer’s disease ( AD) and is associated with decreased quality of life and impaired 
functioning . Primary memory impairment tends to be followed by [CONTACT_204578], attention, executive functions, and visuospatial abilities  
(Weintraub  2012 ). SAGE -[ADDRESS_244154] disruptions in these large -scale 
neuroanatomical networks through positive allosteric  activity at N-Methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA)  
receptors . 
A subtype of glutamate receptors , NMDA  receptors  have  a fundamental and well -documented 
role in regulating synaptic  strength, health, and plasticity.  The NMDA  receptor  antagonist 
memantine is  approved as a treatment for AD, targeting glutamate excitotoxicity in later stages 
of the disease. However, blockade of NMDA  receptor  signaling can result in impaired 
neuroplasticity and cognitive deficits ( Molinuevo 2005 ). Administration of a  short -term NMDA 
partial agonist (D -cycloserine)  in a small study of  AD patie nts improved their scores on the 
cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment S cale, suggesting that NMDA -
enhancing agents can benefit  cognition in AD ( Tsai 1999 ). 
SAGE -718 is a novel , oxysterol -based , positive allosteric modulator of  NMDA receptor s that 
modulates the response to endogenous glutamate  (Paul 2013 ). SAGE -718 only affects receptor 
function in the presence of endogenous glutamate , thus  it does not directly activate the receptor 
and is not expected to cause glutamatergic excitotoxicity. SAGE-718 has been well tolerated in 
both healthy participants and a small cohort of Huntington’s disease participants in previous 
clinical studies. However, based on nonclinical findings, the US Food and Drug Administration 
imposed a maximum median concentra tion (C max) cap of 45  ng/mL. To date, clinical studies 
have used doses that resulted in exposures within this cap; neither serious adverse events ( SAEs ) 
nor AEs leading to discontinuation have been reported. A once -daily 3 -mg dose of SAGE -718 is 
not predic ted to exceed a median C max of 45  ng/mL. For additional information on exposure caps, 
see the SAGE -718 Investigator’s Brochure.  
A direct correlation between SAGE -718 Oral Tablet exposure and fat intake has been observed 
in healthy adults, with significantl y lower exposure in fasting participants than in the same 
participants after moderate and high fat -containing meals. Additionally, as fat levels increased, 
exposure variability decreased, allowing for more predictable C max levels. Thus, in this study 
SAGE -718 will be administered after consumption of a morning meal  containing approximately 
30 g of fat . Based on the data from healthy participants, this regimen is projected to produce a 
median C max of approximately 35  to 40 ng/mL at steady state.  
The safety, tolerability,  of SAGE -718 Oral Tablet will be evaluated in this 
open -label study in individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
or mild dementia due to AD with otherwise stable neuropsychia tric symptoms. Additional data 
on the effects of SAGE -718 will be collected throughout,

718-CNA -[ADDRESS_244155]  a confirmed diagnosis of MCI or mild dementia due to AD, 
according to the National Institute on Aging -Alzheimer’s Association [ADDRESS_244156]® Dementia Staging Instrument . Participants 
will self -administer 3.0 mg of SAGE -718 once daily in the morning for 14 days within 1  hour 
after initiating a meal containing approximately 30  g of fat.  Dosing  and morning food intake will 
be tracked in a participant diary.  Assessments will be performed as outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2)  
At any time during the study,  Sage may elect to form a Dose Evaluation Committee (DEC) . If 
convened, this DEC will review the availabl e data and provid e recommendations for adjusting 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA -201 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
24 the dose, administration schedule, and/or food intake and make adjustments  for subsequent 
participants , if appropriate (see Section  7.4.2 ). 
7.1.1.  Screening Period  
The Screening Period will begin with the informed consent process for prospective participants, 
including study partners. Subsequent screening assessments will be performed between Day  -21 
and Day -8 to determine eligibility, including but not limited to: assessments of cognitive 
function, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG),and C -SSRS.  
An electroencephalogram ( EEG ) will also be performed for all participants during S creening, 
preferably not in a fasted state.  
7.1.2.  Baseline Period  
The Baseline Period will occur from Day -7 through Day -1. During this period, each participant 
will receive dietary counseling to aid in choosing a morning meal containing approximately 30  g 
of fat to consume prior to dosing. On Day -7 (±1 day), participants will visit the clinic for 
confirmation of continued eligibility and collection of baseline  safety data. 
Additionally, participants will be trained on the use of a mobile data cap ture device  
 Participants will continue to complete these 
assessments daily during the Baseline Period, using the mobile device remotely (at home), with 
the support of a study partner. On Day  -1, pa rticipants will return to the study site for 
confirmation of continued eligibility and collection of further baseline  safety data.  
7.1.3.  Treatment Period  
Beginning on Day 1 and continuing through Day 14, participants will self-administer 3.0  mg of 
SAGE 718 (as six 0.5 -mg oral tablets), once per day in the morning within 1 hour after initiating 
a meal containing approximately 30  g of fat, in accordance with the guidelines provided in a 
nutritional information brochure. Durin g this period, participants will continue to complete daily 
assessments  via mobile device either remotely (at home) or 
in the clinic (at scheduled clinic visits) and will track investigative product ( IP) dosing and 
predos e food intake in a participant diary.  
On Day 1, Day 7 (±1 day), and Day 14, participants will arrive at the clinic in the morning prior 
to IP dosing and completion of daily mobile device tasks. Following predose procedures 
(ie, body weight, vital signs, EC G, followed by [CONTACT_204579],  participants will eat a morning 
meal, then take the IP and complete the mobile device tasks under staff supervision.  
At scheduled clinic visits during the Treatment Period, study staff will dispense a sufficient 
amount of SAGE -[ADDRESS_244157] participants by [CONTACT_45347] 4 to document any 
TEAEs and/or changes in concomitant medications.  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA -[ADDRESS_244158] participants by [CONTACT_45347] 21 (±1 day) to document any TEAEs 
and/or changes in concomitant medications. Participants will return to the clini c on Day  28 
(±2 days) for a follow -up visit.  
7.2. Number of Participants  
Up to 22 participants are planned to be dosed to obtain up to 20 participants that complete 
14 days of dosing in this study. Additional participants may be dosed if the early discontinuati on 
rate is greater than 10%.  
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
In this open -label study, all participants will receive 3.[ADDRESS_244159] to identify evidence of seizure activity  
(see Section  12.1.6 ). Should the independent epi[INVESTIGATOR_204568] e for a subclinical or

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA -[ADDRESS_244171] Discontinuation  
A participant may wi thdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request for any reason. 
The investigator may discontinue a participant from the study and/or from IP for safety, 
behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons.  
The reason for IP discontinuation and/or th e reason for early termination from the study must be 
documented in the participant’s study record and recorded in the participant’s electronic case 
report form (eCRF).  
The investigator must notify the sponsor and/or the medical monitor when a participant stops 
participation in the study for any reason.  
Participants who discontinue IP will be invited by [CONTACT_204580] (except IP administration) through the end of the 
Treatment Perio d (Day  14). Those who decline continued participation through Day  14 will be 
asked to complete an Early Termination Visit.  
8.4.2.  Early Termination from the Study  
For participants who are terminated from the study early, if possible, an Early Termination Visit 
should be conducted as described in  Table 2. The  participant will be permanently discontinued 
both from the IP and from the study at that time.  
If the parti cipant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor will retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples take n 
and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records.

9.2.1.  Prior and Concomitant Medications and/or Supplements  
To be eligible to participate in this study, any concomitant medications must have been taken at a 
stable dose and frequency for at least [ADDRESS_244173] IP administration and be expected to remain stable for the 
duration of the study . 
The start and end dates, route, dose/units, frequency, and indication for all relevant medications 
and/or supplements will be recorded at Screening . Medications  to be recorded include all 
psychotropic medications used within 12 weeks  of informed consent,  any other medications and 
supplements taken within 60 days  of informed consent , and all medication  used to treat AD, 
regardless of timing. After  Screening, all changes t o any medication or supplements should be 
captured. All medications and/or supplements taken from the first dose of IP through the final 
study visit (including start and end dates, route, dose/units, frequency, and indication) will be 
recorded on the eCRF.  
Because this study aims to measure effects , it is important to evaluate 
single or combined concomitant medications and their doses for their potential effects  
 Investigators will carefully review concomitant medicatio ns for possible  
effects at Screening to determine participant eligibility and throughout the study.  
9.2.2.  Prohibited Medications  
Treatment with an investigational drug or device is prohibited within the 30  days (or 5  half-lives 
of the IP, whichever is longer) prior to Screening and until the final follow -up visit. 
During the course of the study, adjustment of medication or addition of medications that are 
known to affect  performance  
 is to be avoided as much as possible.  Any medication determined necessary for 
the welfare of the participant may be given at the discretion of the investigator at any time during 
the study , however , the use of any prohibited medications will be captured as a protocol 
deviation.  
Use of the following medications is prohibited during the entire course of the study:  
• Medications with potent effects at the NMDA receptor, including memantine, 
amantadine, ketamine, cycloserine, or related compounds  
• Medications that inhibit cholesterol absorption  (eg, ezetimibe)  
• Bile acid sequestrants (eg, colesevelam, colestipol, cholestyramine)

methods if the female partner(s) is of childbearing potential (see above for list of 
acceptable female contraceptive methods)  
9.3. Intervention after the End of the Study  
Not applicable.  
9.4. Treatment Adherence  
The investigator(s) or designated staff will observe the participant taking the first dose of IP to 
identify any potential risks to adherence (such as difficulty opening the packaging or swallowing 
the tablets). The time and dose of IP a dministration will be noted in the source documents. The 
clinician will provide instructions for self -administration of the IP and train the participant to 
track adherence to the IP regimen and food intake in a participant diary. At the Day  1, and Day  [ADDRESS_244174] Packaging and Labeling  
SAGE -718 Oral Tablets are packaged in high density polyethylene bottles with desiccant, 
induction seal, and child -resistant closures.  
The composition and pharmaceutical quality of the oral tablet will be  maintained according to

clinician -administered 5 -point scale to characterize a patient’s level of impairment due to 
dementia in 6 domains: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, 
home and hobbies, and personal care ( Morris 1993 ). The Test of Pre morbid Functioning uses a 
word -reading scale to estimate premorbid  function in individuals with 
dementia  (Wechsler 2009 ). In addition to full medical history, all nonpharmacological methods 
 used to treat or prevent  
 AD are to be recorded.  
12.1.2.  Weight and Height  
Height and weight will be measured and documented. Body mass index will be calculated and 
documented.

QRS, QT, and QTcF) as well as any rhythm abnormalities will be recorded. 
Electrocardiograms will be performed after the participant has been resting in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_49844] 5 minutes. When ECG measurements coincide with safety assessments, vital signs 
assessment or blood draws, procedures should be carried out in said order (vital signs, ECG, 
blood draw). 
12.1.6. Electroencephalogram 
During Screening, EEG monitoring using the 10 to 20 international system for EEG electrode 
placement will occur for a duration of 1 hour. The assessment may be performed on any single 
day during the Screening Period, at any time of day, but preferably not while the participant is in a fasted state.  
If clinical events suspi[INVESTIGATOR_204558] (eg , epi[INVESTIGATOR_204559]/or involuntary motor behaviors), an unscheduled 1- hour EEG will be 
performed for safety. An additional 1-hour EEG may be performed at the discretion of the 
investigator to follow up on results from any unscheduled EEG . The EEG recording will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_204582][INVESTIGATOR_204571] (eg,  spi[INVESTIGATOR_204561]), subclinical seizure (eg,  synchronous sharp waves and/or 
synchronous spi[INVESTIGATOR_204562]), seizure corresponding to a clinical event, or changes 
consistent with a postseizure state (eg, focal slowing and/or diffuse slowing). Should the 
independent epi[INVESTIGATOR_204555] a subclinical or clinical seizure, dosing with 
SAGE -718 will be stopped for that participant. All EEG abnormalities suggestive of seizure risk 
or posts eizure state will be reviewed by [CONTACT_138830].

42 12.1.8.  Columbia –Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C -SSRS ( Posner 2011 ). This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the participant with 
suicidal ideation and behavior, and a postbaseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the 
last study visit. The C -SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal ideation 
and behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from [ADDRESS_244179] severe).  
The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at Screening (lifetime history and 
past 24  months). The “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed at all subsequent time 
points outlined in  Table 2. 
12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1.  Adverse Event Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any 
time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
A TEAE is defined as  an adverse event with onset after the start of IP, or any worsening of a 
preexisting  medical condition/adverse event with onset after the start of IP and throughout the 
study. The term IP includes any Sage IP, a comparator, or a placebo administered in a clinical 
study . 
Laboratory abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs, and ECGs are considered AEs 
if they result in discontinuation or interruption of study treatment, require therapeutic medical 
intervention, meet protocol specific criteria ( if applicable) or if the investigator  considers them to 
be clinically significant. Any abnormalities that meet the criteria for a n SAE should be reported 
in an expedited manner. Laboratory abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs and 
ECGs tha t are clearly attributable to another AE do not require discrete reporting (eg,  electrolyte 
disturbances in the context of dehydration, chemistry and hematologic disturbances in the 
context of sepsis).  
All AEs that occur after any participant has signed th e informed consent and throughout the 
duration of the study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be reported to Sage 
Therapeutics.  
Subjects who discontinue the IP due to an AE, regardless of investigator -determined causality, 
should be follo wed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the investigator  determines 
the event is no longer clinically significant. Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant’s last 
AE assessment in the study are followed up by [CONTACT_204593], but without further recording in the eCRF. The Sponsor or its representative retains the 
right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of 
the study, if judged necessary.  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA -[ADDRESS_244180] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Places the participant  at immediate risk of death (a life -threatening event); however, 
this does not include an event that, had it occurred i n a more severe form, might have 
caused death  
• Requires in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
An SAE may also b e any other medically important event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_204572] 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring int ensive 
treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
All SAEs that occur after any participant has signed the informed consent form ( ICF) and 
throughout the duration of the study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be 
recorded on the SAE report form provided by [CONTACT_135482]. Any SAE that is ongoing when 
the participant completes their final study visit, will be followed  by [CONTACT_204594], stabilized, returned to baseline status, or until the participant dies or is lost to 
follow up.  
A prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered an 
SAE, even if the participant is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. The site must document all of the following:  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the participant’s 
consent to parti cipate in the study.  
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_135432] , between the participant’s consent to participate in t he study and at the 
time of the procedure or treatment.  
12.2.3.  Relationship to Investigational Product  
The investigator  must make the determination of relationship to the IP for each adverse event 
(not related, related). The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the 
relationship of AEs and SAEs to the IP.  
Not Related  An AE will be considered “not relat ed” to the use of the IP if there is not a reasonable 
possibility that the event has been caused by [CONTACT_33249]. Factors pointing towards this 
assessment include but are not limited to: the lack of temporal relationship between 
administration of the IP and the event, the presence of biologically implausible 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA -[ADDRESS_244181] and the AE, or the presence of a more likely 
alternative explanation for the AE . 
Related  An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the IP if there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_95107]. 
Factors that point towards this assessment include but are not limited to: a positive 
rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the drug and 
the eve nt, a known response pattern of the suspected drug, improvement following 
discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the 
drug and the AE, or a lack of alternative explanation for the AE . 
12.2.4.  Recording Adverse Events  
Adver se events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_4538]/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235]. The AE term should be reported in standard medical  terminology when 
possible. For each AE, the investigator  will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome and seriousness (if 
applicable), and whether or not it caused the particip ant to discontinue the IP or withdraw early 
from the study . 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild: symptom(s) barely noticeable to participant or does not make participant 
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functio ning; prescription drug not 
ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s)  
• Moderate: symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make participant uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activity is influenced; participant is able to continue in study; 
treatment for sym ptom(s) may be needed  
• Severe: symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or 
significant impact on participant’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of 
treatment with IP; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or participant 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_127170]. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540]  12.2.2 . An A E of severe intensity may 
not necessarily be considered serious.  
12.2.5.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE(s), the study site 
must notify Sage or designee wit hin 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aware of the 
SAE(s). The investigator  must complete, sign and date the SAE report form, verify the accuracy 
of the information recorded on the SAE report form with the corresponding source documents, 
and send a  copy to Sage or designee.  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
718-CNA -201 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
45 Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage or designee 
within 24 hours of receipt on a follow -up SAE report form and placed with the original SAE 
information and kept with the appropria te section of the eCRF and/or study file.  
Serious adverse events occurring after the designated follow -up time for the study, should be 
reported to Sage or designee according to the timelines noted above only if the investigator 
considers the SAE related t o IP.  
Sage, or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events. It is the principal  investigator ’s responsibility to notify the IRB/IEC of all SAEs that 
occur at his or her site . Investigator s will also be notif ied of all suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) that occur during the clinical study. IRBs/IECs  will be notified of 
SAEs and/or S[LOCATION_003]Rs as required by [CONTACT_1769].  
Sage , or designee , will submit S[LOCATION_003]Rs (in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies 
according to local law  and investigators . 
12.3. Pregnancy  
If a participant becomes pregnant after the first administration of IP, pregnancy information must 
be collected and recorded on  the Pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_244182] pregn ancy information on any 
participant’s partner who becomes pregnant after the participant has received the first 
administration of IP. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant 
partner directly, the investigator  will follow the  same pregnancy reporting procedures specified 
for pregnant participants.  
The participant or participant’s partner will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. The outcome of all pregnancies (eg, spontaneous abortion, elective abortion, norm al 
birth) must be followed and documented even if the participant was discontinued from the study. 
The investigator  will collect follow -up information on the participant or participant’s partner and 
the neonate, and the information will be forwarded to Sag e or designee. Generally, follow -up 
will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of 
anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_135445] a contraceptive medication. Any complication during 
pregnancy (eg, anemia, infections, pre eclampsia ) should be reported as an AE/SAE. If the 
outcome of t he pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death,), the investigator  should follow the procedures 
for reporting an SAE.

Medications will be recorded at each study visit during the study and will be coded using World 
Health Organization -Drug dic tionary September 2015, or later.  
At Screening, all psychotropic medications used by [CONTACT_78772] [ADDRESS_244185] dose  of IP will be denoted “Prior”. Those medications taken prior to the 
first dose  of IP  and continuing beyond the initiation of the IP or those medications started at the 
same time or after the initiation of the IP will be denoted “Concomitant”.  
Medications will be presented according to whether they are “Prior” or “Concomitant” as 
defined a bove. If medication dates are incomplete and it is not clear whether the medication was 
concomitant, it will be assumed to be concomitant.

Not applicable.  
14. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOU RCE DATA/D OCUMENTS  
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a participant into the study, a representative of Sage 
Therapeutics will visit the invest igational study site per Sage standard operating procedures  to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Sage Thera peutics or its 
representatives. This will be documented in a Clinical Trial Agreement between Sage 
Therapeutics and the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics or representative will have regular contacts 
with the investigational sit e, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms, an d that IP accountability checks are 
being performed  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case 
report forms with the participant’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and 
other records relevant to  the study. This will require direct access to all original 
records for each participant (eg, clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics.  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.

CONFIDENTIAL   PAGE 6 OF 31 1 Introduction: Background and Scientific Rationale  
1.1 Background  
1.1.1 Gut Microbiota  
Human gut harbors a complex community of over 100 trillion microbial cells, which constitute 
the microbiota (3). The gut microbiome encodes about 3.3 million genes, which is 150 ti mes 
that of our own genome (4). The symbiotic gut microbiota provides complementary biological 
and metabolic functions that cannot be performed by [CONTACT_1978]  (5). Disruption to the normal 
balance between the gut microbiota and the host (dysbiosis) is associated with diverse disease 
states such as obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, neurological disorders, cancer, and 
cardiovascular  disease (CVD) (6-11). 
Findings from the human microbiome project (HMP) revealed that the gut microbiome is highly 
specific, personalized and functionally relevant to health  (12). Gut microbiota is altered in  
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preliminary evidence indicates that the dysbiotic 
gut microbiota could be the source for a plethora of uremic toxins (13), many of which have 
been shown  to be positively correlated with progression of CKD and increased risk for major 
adverse cardiovascular events defined as death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (14-16). 
Therefore, correcting the gut microbiota dysbiosis might be a therapeutic option for reducing 
both the progression as well as the cardiovascular burden of CKD.  
Hyperkalemia, a frequent and serious electrolyte abnormality in patients with kidney failure, 
can lead to life threatening cardiac arrhythmias (17; 18) . Even relatively mild (5.5 to 6.0 mEq/L) 
hyper kalemia is associated with an increased risk of mortality (19). Compensatory increase in 
fecal potassium excretion occurs in patients with renal failure (20; 21) . Normally , the gut is 
responsible for only 5% of total potassium excretion; however, in patients with end -stage renal 
disease (ESRD), this can increase substantially to account for 30% to 50% of potassium 
excretion (22).  
Preliminary evidence indicates that the growth rate of certain bacteria is affected by [CONTACT_824014] (23). E. coli  populations exhibited 
higher growth rates in the presence of additional potassium (23). However , potassium may also 
Relypsa   Protocol # R -[ADDRESS_1142591] the growth of commensal methanogens. At increased concentrations, 
potassium decreases methanogenesis by [CONTACT_824015] a 
potassium transport carrier, thus  decreasing the transmembrane electron potential (24). This 
has been shown to have a significant impact on the pH regulation of the bacteria (25).  
Patiromer for oral suspension is an FDA -approved orally admini stered drug used for the 
treatment of hyperkalemia. It is a nonabsorbed polymer that binds potassium throughout the 
gastrointestinal tract and leads to lowering serum potassium levels (1). Prior Patiromer clinical 
trials have demonstrated the drug’s utility in treating hyperkalemia  in patients with diabetic 
kidney disease (1; 2) .

1.3 Study Objectives  
1.3.1 Primary Objective  
 Examine the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of Patiromer in lowering serum potassium 
levels in ESRD patients with hyperkalemia (K>5.0 mEq/L). In a non -randomized, 
crossover study, [ADDRESS_1142595] patients with hyperkalemia (K>5.0 mEQ/L) will be enrolled in 
an o pen-label, pi[INVESTIGATOR_187901] 3 sequential phases of (a) 2 weeks of no 
intervention, (b) 12 weeks of Patiromer treatment at 8.4-16.8  g/day, and (c) 6 weeks of 
no intervention. Blood and stool samples will be collected throughout the study period.  
1.3.2 Secondary  Objective s  
 Determine the changes in gut microbiome and serum metabolom e profiles of 
hyperkalemic ESRD patients treated with Patiromer. Blood and stool samples collected 
from the ESRD patients enrolled in the above study will be collected at pre-specified 
time points and analyzed by [CONTACT_824016], and untargeted 
and targeted metabolomics for stool and serum metabolom e profiles, in order to 
determine the impact of lowering gut potassium levels using Patiromer on gut 
microbiome dysbiosis and generation of uremic toxins.

most commonly reported treatment related adverse events have been hypomagnesemia 
(7.2%), constipation (4.6%), and diarrhea (2.7 %).  
 This study incorporates several design elements to minimize adverse events related to the 
study agent including:  
 Eligibility criteria that exclude individuals with normal or low blood potassium levels. Only 
ESRD patients with hyperkalemia (K>5.0 mEQ/ L) will be enrolled  
 A maximum daily Patiromer dose of 16.8 g once daily  
 Frequent m onitoring of gastrointestinal symptoms  
 Regular monitoring of concomitant medications and antibiotic use  
 Pre-dialysis serum potassium will be monitored at regular  intervals. Appropriate adjustment 
in dialysate potassium will be made to avoid hypokalemia.  
 Follow -up of serum magnesium levels   
4.2 Study Agent Dose Adjustments  
4.2.1 Protocolized Dosing of Study Agent  
Participants will orally self -administer Patiromer at a dose  of 8.4 gram, once daily and observed 
for a week, during which serum potassium and gastrointestinal symptoms will be evaluated. If 
tolerated and in the absence of hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 4 meq/L), the dose 
will be up -titrated to 16.8 g once daily. Participants will remain on the 16.8 g daily dosage for 
another 11 weeks, for a total of 12 weeks of treatment.  Study agent kits will contain 4 weeks’

CONFIDENTIAL   PAGE 14 OF 31 5 ADVERSE EVENTS  
This section describes the requirements and processes for reporting adverse events and 
unanticipated problems that occur during the study to Relypsa  and the IRB.   
5.1 Definitions  
Definitions are per the January 2007 Guidance on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated 
Problems Involving Risks to Participants or Others and Adverse Events, Office on Human 
Research Protection (OHRP) Guidance. http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/AdvEvntGuid.htm . The 
requirements and processes for reporting adverse events are described in the corresponding 
NIH Guidelines.  
Adverse Event (AE):  An AE is any untoward or unfavo rable medical occurrence in a human 
study participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participant’s 
involvement in the research, whether or not co nsidered related to the participant’s 
participation in the research.  
Internal adverse event:   From the perspective of one particular institution engaged in a 
multicenter clinical trial, internal adverse events are those adverse events experienced by 
[CONTACT_824017](s) at that institution.  
5.[ADDRESS_1142606] adverse event data at each study visit by [CONTACT_824018]:   
 asking participants directly  
 evaluating medical record information  
 reviewing all laboratory values  
 examining reports generated by [CONTACT_26739] m anagement system based on data entered into 
logs and forms   
Relypsa   Protocol # R -[ADDRESS_1142607] the investigator after the conclusion of the trial if subsequent 
medical events occur which the participant, or the participant’s physician, believes may be 
related to participation in the research study.  
Other medical information  
A participant may report that he or she had a medical test or procedure. If so, inquire as to why 
this was done as it may reveal pertinent information about a medical condition or diagnosis.  In 
addition, if a participant reports starting a new medication, it may also indicate a new diagnosis 
or a change in a pre -existing medical condition that should be discussed and documented on 
the AE form.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is defined as any AE that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
 fatal  
 life-threatening  
 requires  or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 results in congenital anomalies or birth defects  
 an important medical event  
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are 
clearly of major clinical significance. SAE reporting requirements are based on meeting the 
outcome definition outlined above.

Measurement of plasma p -cresol sulfate, indoxyl sulfate , TMAO and SCFA will be performed at 
2, 4, 10, 14 and 20 weeks of the study. Plasma will be separated from whole blood samples 
collected in tubes containing EDTA as anti -coagulant. Extracted plasma will be frozen 
immediately after collection and store at -80°C until further use. The chromatographic 
separation of metabolites will be performed using either reverse phase separation or normal 
phase online with QQQ mass spectrometers (Agilent Technologies). For this , we will employ a 
combination of solvents incl uding gradients at varying concentrations of ammonium acetate, 
methanol, acentonitrile adjusted for specific metabolites. Metabolites will be separated by 
[CONTACT_824024] a Luna Phenyl Hexyl column (3um, 2x150mm, Phenominex), a 
Luna Amino ( NH2) column (4um, 100A 2.1x150mm, Phenominex), or an orbax Eclipse XDB -C18

[IP_ADDRESS]  Gut microbiota taxonomic analysis   
The structure of the microbiota from frozen stool samples will be assessed by [CONTACT_824027].  Stool samples will be collected for DNA extraction and shotgun 
metagenomic  sequencing. DNA will be extracted using the MoBio PowerFecal DNA Isolation kit. 
Quantification and quality control of DNA samples will be run on a BioAnalyzer 2100. All 
samples will be run on an Illumina MiSeq or NextSeq, which will provide us with ~10 mi llion 
reads per sample to allow for accurate characterization of the microbiome. Reads will be pre -
processed using PRINSEQ -lite 0.20.4 (trimming reads and bases < [ADDRESS_1142612] 
duplicates, and reads with undetermined bases). We will construct a ‘target’ genome library 
containing all bacterial, fungal, and viral sequences from the Human Microbiome Project 
Reference Database (http://www.hmpdacc.org/reference_genomes/reference_genomes.php) 
using the PathoLib module from PathoScope 2.0. We will align  the reads to these libraries using 
the Bowtie2 algorithm, and then filter any reads that also aligned to the human genome (hg19) 
as implemented in PathoMap (very -sensitive -local -k 100 --score -min L,20,1.0). We will then 
apply PathoScope 2.0, specifically  the PathoID module, to obtain accurate read counts for 
downstream analysis, including mappi[INVESTIGATOR_824013] a microbial database to identify 
species/strains and calculate relative abundances to determine the impact of Patriomer on the 
gut microbiome. Analy ses, including testing of abundance of target species in treated patients 
and tests of correlations of changes in abundance with changes in metabolomics will be 
performed in R and Bioconductor using packages xlsx, gtools, CHNOSZ, plyr, ggplot2, reshape2, 
gplots, Phyloseq, and DESeq2.

interest in participation and confirm eligibility.  Study personnel will discuss the study goals and 
procedures with the potential participant in detail.  Patient s should have an understanding of 
the importance of providing frequent  stool samples and what the process entails.  If the patient 
agrees to participate in the study, study personnel will review and assess understanding of the 
entire informed consent form prior to obtaining written informed consent from the participant.  
The consenting process will be performed by a qualified investigator or study site designee.  
Informed consent will be obtained and documented before any study procedures are 
performed.  
The following activities may take place over one or two  visits.   
 Determination of eligibility  
 Informed consent process  
 Collection of baseline data including demographics, medical history, and medication use 
including  recent and current use of prescription products, over -the-counter products, 
herbal supplements, vitamins, and prebiotic and probiotic use in any form.  In addition, 
medical records from the clinic facility will be reviewed to capture any non -reported data on 
recent medication use.

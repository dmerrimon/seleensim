2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease s and Rationale  
 
2.1.1  Cohorts  T1, 1A and 1B : Sarcoma  
  
The sarcomas represent a complex and heterogene ous group of orphan mesenchymal 
malignancies arising from bone or soft tissue. In metastatic sof t tissue sarcomas, chemotherapy 
has led to a median survival of only 12 months across histologies1,2. In metastatic o steosarcoma 
5-year survival rates are only in the range of 15 -30%3.  
 
Cancers rely on either telomerase or the ALT pathway  to extend telomeres and by[CONTACT_747432]. ALT is a recombination -mediated mechanism that extends telomeres. Depending on

9 which assay is used, ALT i s estimated to be activated in 10 -15% of cancers4. Interestingly, the 
sarcomas have a high prevalence for ALT. For example, it has been reported that up to 50 -60% 
of osteosarcomas and LMS are ALT+. A TRX -DAXX is a chromatin -remodeling complex t hat 
functions at genomic loci including telomeres. Loss of ATRX has b een linked to activation of the 
ALT pathway in cancer cells. In work from the Zou laboratory5, it was found that ATRX is a cell 
cycle -regulated repressor of  the telom ere non -coding RNA TERRA and ATRX loss 
compromises the cell -cycle  regulation of TERRA leading to overexpression/persistent 
association throughout the cell cycle . This dysregulation ultimately generates a recombinogenic 
nucleoprotein structure (RP A-coated s ingle -stranded DNA) at telomeres, which activates the 
ATR checkpoint kinase and p romotes telomere recombination. Importantly, it was determined 
that ATR is a key regulator of A LT where ATR inhibitors disrupt the ALT pathway and 
selectively kill A LT+ cancer cells  in a panel of osteosarcoma and glioblastoma cell lines.  
 
In our clinical experience ATRX is mutated in ~39% of LMS6. In unpublished work,  there is  
near 100% correlation with ATRX alterations and ALT+ status in LMS. However, we have also 
noted that there are sarcomas , including LMS,  with intact ATRX that activate ALT through other 
pathways. To enrich for ALT in this translational aspect of the study we will focus on those with 
ATRX mutations and loss of expression by [CONTACT_4658]. In the larger study,  we will include all LMS or 
osteosarcomas, regardless of ATRX status, and retrospectively determine ALT status.   
 
2.1.2  Cohort 2:  Mutations in ATM  
 
Complementation of an AT M patient derived cell line w ith wild -type ATM rescues M6620 
hypersensitivity while cells complemented with a kinase -dead version of ATM re mains 
hypersensitive ( unpublished data, Center for DNA Damage and Repair, DFCI ).  These results are 
consistent with enhanced sensitivity of a variety of cell lines to ATR inhibitors after knock -down 
of ATM.  Therefore, tumors with genomic deletion of ATM  or lack of ATM expression due to 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_747418] M6620.  Since the kinase domain of ATM is 
located at the C -terminus of the protein, all truncating mutations resulting in  deletion of the 
kinase domain would result in a non -functional protein.  Among missense mutations, 23 are 
annotated as pathogenic in the ClinVar database , a freely accessible archive of the relationships 
among human variations and phenotypes supported by [CONTACT_747433] (NCBI) .  Therefore, patients whose tumors harbor truncating mutations or one of the 
[ADDRESS_1022636] if the wild -type allele is 
retained.  Both these scenarios are likely to result in enhanced sensitivity to M6620.   
 
2.1.3  Cohort 3T, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5 : Mutations in BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1022637] genes are 
expected to succumb to ATR inhibition.  ATR is activated early in response to DNA double -
strand breaks where ATR phosphorylates  and activates multiple proteins that participate in HR 
and activation of cell cycle checkpoint7,8.  Carriers of germline or somatic known deleterious 
mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2  will be recruited to c ohort 3A while cohort 3B will constitute 
patients whose tumors harbor somatic mutations in BRCA  genes or mutations in other HR

resistant by [CONTACT_747434], ATR inhibition is expected to destabilize 
replication fo rks.  Therefore, PARP inhibitor -resistant cancers may respond to ATR inhibitor 
monotherapy9.  
 
2.1.4  Cohort 4A and 4B: Tumors with replication stress  
 
Unlicensed replication origin firing and compromised replication fork stability results in 
replication stress (RS).  Single - and double -stranded DNA breaks and presence of extensive 
single -strand DNA are manifestations of RS.  These conditions result in the activation of the 
ATR pathway, so that tumors with RS are dependent on ATR for survival10.  In this cohort, we 
will test the efficacy of M6620 in tumors with amplifications in MYC  (Cohort 4A) and  CCNE1 
(Cohort 4B).  In addition to patient tumors with MYC  amplification, cohort 4A will also include 
subjects with trunca ting or missense mutations designated as deleterious (cBioPortal) in FBXW7 .  
FBXW7 is a component of the SCF -like E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, of which, MYC is a major 
substrate.   
 
The eligibility criteria for CCNE1  amplification will be greater than 8 -fold and that of MYC  will 
be 6-fold.  The Brigham and Women’s Center for Advanced Molecular Diagnostics (CAMD) has 
performed preliminary analyses indicating that amplification identified by [CONTACT_747435] ( FISH ).  
 
Although increased CCNE1 copy number can lead to increased cyclin E protein expression, this 
is not a universal finding. Based on work done with our co llaborators, it is  expect ed that 50% of 
tumors will have high cyclin E protein levels in the presence of any degree of CCNE1  
amplification.  Our collaborators have further evaluated the CCNE1 -amplified group to see if a 
certain degree of gene amplification  correlates with high cyclin E protein expressi on.  This work 
is illustrated below. A minimum [ADDRESS_1022639] probability of 
treating tumors with high cyclin E protein expression.

2.1.5  Cohort 5: ARID1A  
 
ARID1A  is among the most highly -mutated genes across various tumor types . Mutations are most  
prevalent in endometrial, colorectal, gastric and bladder cancer.  The m ajority of mutations 
identified in the cancer genome atlas ( TCGA ) are truncating , and none of the missense mutations 
have been classified as deleterious by [CONTACT_747436].  Although bi -allelic truncation mutations are less common, tumors with mono -allelic 
truncation mutation tend to have low levels of protein expression, and in vitro  studies in cell 
lines suggest that ARID1A is a haplo -insufficient tumor suppressor.  Lack of ARID1A protein 
determined by [CONTACT_747437].  ARID1A is a 
large protein with a DNA binding domain while the C -terminus encodes multiple LXXLL 
protein interaction motifs .  ARID1A interacts with several proteins to form the BAF complexes, 
a subfamily of mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers.  ATM and ARID1A were the two 
top hits in an siRNA screen using HCC1143, a triple negative breast cancer cell line, to identify 
genes  that exhibit a synthetic -lethal interaction with ATR inhibitor11.  In an expanded set of 
tumor cell lines, ones with mutant ARID1A  were found to be more sensitive to ATR inhibiti on 
compared to cells with wild -type ARID1A .  ARID1A  mutant/deficient cells are defective in 
TOPO2A and the G2/M checkpoint regulated by [CONTACT_747438].  When ATR is inhibited, the cells enter 
mitosis without resolving replication defects resulting in genomic instabil ity and apoptosis.  
 
2.1.6  Cohort T4: SDH -deficient GIST  
 
GIST are a subtype of sarcoma derived from the Interstitial Cells of Cajal  in the GI tract .  In 
nearly all GIST either the oncogene c -KIT or PDGFRA undergo activating mutations that drive 
cancer growth. In a subset of GIST, which lack KIT/PDGFRA mutations, there is deficiency in 
one of the SDHX gene subunits. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors  have min imal activity in this subtype 
of GIST  and there are no FDA -approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_37334] . Notably, SDH -GIST also 
tend to be associated with the pediatric and adult population, while KIT/PDGFRA -GIST 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_747419].    
 
Figure:  6-fold CCNE1  amplification is associated with high cyclin E 
expression within tumor cells.  The graph above shows the degree of 
cyclin E protein expression for non -amplified, moderately amplified 
and highly amplified CCNE1 .  80% of tumors with 6 -fold or greater 
CCNE1  gene amplification were highly expressed cyclin E protein, 
compared with 25% and 50% of tumors with low or moderate 
amplification respectively.

12 It was recent ly recognized that tumors with mutations in Krebs -cycle proteins  (e.g. SDH -
deficient  paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma) are deficient in HR dsDNA break repair.12 The 
proposed mechanism is as follows. SDH deficiency  in the tumor Kreb cycle  leads to elevated 
fumarate and  succinate . These in turn suppress HR activity  through KDM4A/B, known 
regulators of DNA repair .  Thus, there is a therapeutic potential for synthetic lethality in tumors 
with this alteration.   
 
In the initial experience of this trial an adult with known S DH-deficient  GIST refractory to 
sunitinib and regorafenib was treated with M6620. After [ADDRESS_1022640] a minor radiologic response with shrinkage of  -13.84% and a  marked 
improvement in clinical symptoms.  
 
2.2 M6620 (VX -970) 
 
M6620 is a potent inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3 -related kinase ( ATR, 
inhibition constant [Ki] <300 pM) that blocks ATR activity in cells, with a concentration 
associated with 50% inhibition (IC 50) of 20 nM.  Complete compound background information is 
available in the investigator’s brochure (IB).  
 
2.2.1  Pre-Clinical Summary  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacology  
 
M6620 (VX -970) is a potent inhibitor of ATR kinase (inhibition constant [Ki] <300 pM) with 
excellent selectivity over other kinases (>50 -fold selectivity over 290/291 kinases tested). In 
vitro , M6620 sensit ized many cancer cell lines and primary human tumor cells, but not normal 
cell lines, to the cyto toxic effects of a range of DNA -damaging drugs and  ionizing radiation  (IR). 
The reliance of many cancer cells on ATR for survival following treatment with DNA -damaging 
agents can be driven by a number of mechanisms including disruption of alternative DNA 
damage repa ir pathways in these cells. One such example is disruption of the s ignaling pathway 
mediated by [CONTACT_747439] (ATM) kinase. This pathway is defective in many 
cancer cells. In contrast, normal cell tolerance to inhibition of ATR is attributed to the presence 
of alter native, compensatory DNA damage response (DDR) pathways.  
 
In mouse xenograft models derived from human cancer cell lines and primary human tumors, 
M6620 dose-dependently enhanced the anti -tumor effects of multiple DNA -damaging drugs and 
IR. In many cases, marked regression was observe d for combin ations with M6620. Furthermore, 
the combination of M6620  and a DNA -damaging drug has been shown to be more effective than 
the DNA -damaging drug alone at its maximum tolerated  dose (MTD). As a single agent, M6620 
had no significant impact on tumor growth in  the experimental models examined .  
 
Dose schedule optimization studies in mouse models have demo nstrated that administration of 
M6620  by [CONTACT_746636] a dose of 20 mg/kg/week (either as a single injection or as two 10 -
mg/kg injections 3 days apart) was highly effective in combination wi th cisplatin or gemcitabine. 
Furthermore, timing of M6620  administration is critical, with  maximal activity observed when 
M6620  was given 12 to 24 hours after cisplatin or gemcitabine treatment.

Therapeutic dose estimatio ns were based on achieving an  area under the concentration versus 
time curve  (AUC ) of 4080 ng ∙h/mL/week in whole blood (achieved with an IV dose of 20 
mg/kg/week in mouse). Allometry predicts that a human dose  of 2.5 mg/kg (corresponding to 
100 mg/m2) will be sufficient to achieve this exposure. In murine models, M6620 was generally 
well tolerated at efficacious doses in combination wi th DNA -damaging agents. In some 
instances, some body weight loss was observed, and from  intensive and sustain ed dosing of 
M6620 in combination with cisplatin, enhanced changes in  specific peripheral blood cell 
population was observed versus cisplatin treatment alone. This en hanced effect was attributed to 
a synergistic increase in growth arrest in normal cells. In vitro  studies have demonstrated that the 
enhanced growth arrest seen when ATR inhibitors are added to cisplatin treatment is reversed 
after ATR activity is restored.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics  
 
In rats, mice, dogs, and monkeys, M6620  had a high volume of  distribu tion; tissue exposure, 
including tumor, was high. In rats, no accumulation or retention was observed in tissues and the 
elimination half -lives were similar across all tissues and whol e blood. Whole blood half -lives 
after IV administration in rats and dogs were 11.6 and 9.8 hours , respectively. M6620 had high 
plasma protein binding and the free fraction in human blood was  2.1%. A low potential for drug -
drug interactions was predicted, based on minimal inhibition or induction  of CYP isozymes by 
M6620 ; however , strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may alter M6620 kinetics and blood 
levels. M6620 was primarily eliminated by [CONTACT_747440] m, with CYP3A4 as the principle 
isozyme responsible. Metabolites were excreted in the urine and bile. All metabolites observed in  
human hepatocyte incubations were also observed in either rat or  dog hepatocyte incubations and 
in the blood, bile, or urine from rats or dogs. Accordingly, rat and dog were recommended as the 
appropriate species for toxicology assessment. The systemic clearance values of M6620 
following IV administration were determined to be 26 and 1 3 mL/min/kg in the rat and dog, 
respectively.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Pharmacology  
 
A battery of in vitro  and in vivo  safety pharmacology studies designed to evaluate effects of 
M6620  against multiple protein targets, and the cardiovascular  system did not demonstrate any 
toxicologically significant effects at exposures or concentrations that exceed the clinica lly 
relevant exposures of M6620 . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Toxicology  
 
The M6620 toxicology studies in rats and dogs identified the liver, testes, and peripheral blood 
cell populations as target organs following oral or IV administration. Importantly, liver and 
peripheral blood toxicities were reversed within 4 weeks of discontinuation of M6620. Following 
oral exposure, the MTD in rats was 150 mg/kg and M6620 was not tolerated at doses ≥30 mg/kg 
in dogs. IV administration in a regimen that more closely reflects the clinical regimen was 
tolerated in animals and allowed the determination of a severe ly toxic dose to 10% of animals 
(STD 10) in rats and a highest non -severely toxic dose (HNSTD) in dogs. The animal to human

14 exposure ratio on a weekly AUC basis at the rat STD 10 following IV administration (30 mg/kg) 
was 5.3 -fold the weekly human exposure a t 210 mg/m2. The animal to human exposure ratio on 
a weekly AUC basis at the dog HNSTD following IV administration (20 mg/kg) was 7.7 -fold the 
weekly human exposure at 210 mg/m2.  
 
M6620 had no cardiovascular liabilities, was not genotoxic in a GLP mutagenicity assay, had no 
hemolytic potential in human blood or compatibility issues in human plasma, and was well 
tolerated in an acute rabbit parenteral injection study. M6620 absorbs in the UV -visible spectrum 
and has high tissue distribution in rats; therefore, appropriate precautions to safeguard patients 
from excessive UV -visible radiation should be taken in the clinic pending results from 
nonclinical phototoxicity assessment.  
 
2.2.2  Clinical Summary  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics  
 
Noncompartmental analyses were conduc ted on preliminary cli nical pharmacokinetic (PK) data 
obtained from Parts A and B of Study VX12 -970-001 (St udy 001) and Study VX13 -970-002 
(Study 002) for both whole blood and plasma matrices. The mean M6620 plasma concentrations 
versus time profiles were similar in shape to those of the corr esponding whole blood profiles. 
Overall, the C max were approximately 1.3 -fold greater in whole blood than in the plasma matrix,  
suggesting that plasma is an appropriate matrix to characterize  the PK of M6620. PK exposur es 
tended to increase dose proportionally with increasing dose b ased upon C max and AUC 0-∞ after 
administration of M6620  as a single agent. The mean termin al elimination half -life was 
approximately [ADDRESS_1022641] the PK of M6620 . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Single Agent Safety  
 
M6620 was administered as a single agent in the lead -in periods of the phase [ADDRESS_1022642] -in-human 
study 001 Parts A and B (doses of 18 mg/m2 to 210 mg/m2, lead -in periods of 7 to 21 days); 
during the phase 1 s tudy 002 Part A1 (once weekly, doses of 60 mg/m2 to 480 mg/m2) and Part 
A1 (twice weekly, doses of 240 mg/m2); and during the single -agent phase of study 002 Part C 
(doses of 240 mg/m2).  
 
M6620 was generally well tolerated as a single agent. There were no dose -limiting toxicities 
(DLTs), few adverse events (AEs) leading to study drug discontinuation, and [ADDRESS_1022643] subjects receiving single -agent M6620 had AEs. The System Organ Classes (SOCs) 
in which AEs occurred most frequently were Gastrointestinal Disorders and General Disorders 
and Administration Site Conditions. The most commonly occurring  AE was nausea. The only 
AEs that occurred in the single -agent phases of all 4 study parts were nausea and ALT increased.  
 
The SOCs in which serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred most frequently were Neoplasms 
Benign, Malignant, and Unspecified; Respi[INVESTIGATOR_92601], Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders; and 
Gastrointestinal Disorders. SAEs that occurred in more than [ADDRESS_1022644] receiving single -agent

same treatment group when the AE occurred.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Drug Reactions  
 
After careful assessment, infusion -related reactions, nausea, and vomiting are considered adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) for M6620, and myelosuppression events are considered ADRs for 
M6620 in combination with carboplatin.  
 
Infusion -related reactions are common with IV a dministration of drugs used to treat cancer. 
These reactions occur during or shortly after administration of the drug, may be local and/or 
systemic, and are diverse.  
 
Systemic infusion -related reactions to M6620 may include signs or symptoms such as prurit us, 
flushing, chills/rigors, urticaria/rash, headache, bronchospasm/dyspnea, and hypotension or 
hypertension, among others. Some systemic infusion -related reactions to M6620 have been 
serious, including those described as acute hypersensitivity reactions. Local infusion -related 
reactions to M6620, sometimes described as infusion site reactions, may include signs or 
symptoms such as infusion site erythema, swelling, or pain.  
 
Nausea and vomiting have occurred commonly in patients receiving M6620 monotherapy.  Many 
of the affected subjects experienced these events on the same day M6620 was administered, and 
there was some suggestion of a dose response.  
 
Myelosuppression AEs for subjects who received M6620 in combination with carboplatin have 
included neutropeni a, thrombocytopenia, platelet count decreased, and febrile neutropenia.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacodynamics  
 
Paired M6620  tumor biopsies were obtained pre - and post -M6620  administratio n from a subset 
of subjects in s tudy 002 Part B, and pS345 Chk1 levels assessed by [CONTACT_4658].  A preliminary analysis 
of the data showed decreased Chk1 phosphorylation in 2/2 paired t umor biopsies (74% at M6620  
90 mg/m2 + carboplatin AUC5; 94% at M6620 120 mg/m2 + carboplatin AUC5 ).

CONFIDENTIAL  
 
17 [IP_ADDRESS]  Single Agent Efficacy  
 
Subjects in phase I study [ADDRESS_1022646] with 
colorectal cancer had a complete response (CR). The subject’s tumor lesion diameter decreased 
from 18 mm at Screening to “too small to measure” at Cycle 31. This subject has completed 44 
cycles of M6620 therapy  and continues to be on treatment at the time of the data cut -off. Five of 
17 subjects had stable disease (SD) as the best overall response.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rationale for Translational Lead -in Study  
 
The development of M6620 has largely been focused on optimizing dosing for chemotherapy 
combination studies (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]  VX12 -970-001 and Study VX13 -970-002). Patients 
included in the above studies were not pre-selected for biomarkers predicted to be sensitive to 
ATR inhibition. Moreover , it is unknown whether current dosing strategies (twice per week) are 
adequate to durably inhibit ATR without the stressor of concurrent chemotherapy.  Interestingly, 
of note, the patient with a complete response described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  was an ATM -mutant 
colorectal cancer patient treated at the first dose level ( 60 mg/m2 once per week)13. With this 
background, we designed a Translational Lead -in Study to confirm target engagement, and 
potentially to observe clinical responses , in the indications where we anticipate the hi ghest 
likelihood for response. This strategy will be critical for dosing confirmation prior to embarking 
on a larger basket -type study.    
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rationale for ctDNA Sample Collection   
 
C-circle assay (an assay of telomeric repeats, which proportionally reflects the average length of 
telomeres, is measured by [CONTACT_956] [qPCR])19) on T1 fresh biopsy samples and 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), only.  
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1022647] at DFCI/BWH (a custom hybrid 
capture panel which via NGS  will identify mutations and copy -number alterations in over 400 
cancer associated genes) or via another CLIA -certified method  (e.g. SNaPshot at MGH or 
Foundation Medicine) . Gene expression profiling has been demonstrated to predict  disea se-free 
and overall survival in multiple cancers and guide future treatment decisions and biologic 
discovery14-16.  
 
Current methods for identifying ALT positive tumors by [CONTACT_747442]. DNA testing for ATRX can be performed on clinical samples but this only identifies a 
subset of ALT cases associated with mutations in this gene17. The same limitation applies to tests 
based on the loss of ATRX staining by [CONTACT_4658]. Though ATRX sequencing  will be used for 
Translational Lead -in study entry, given the strong correlation to ALT status, we recognize that 
there are other ALT positive tumors that will be missed with this assay. Thus,  there is interest in

Protocol Version Date:   January 27, [ADDRESS_1022648] assay (an assay of 
telomeric repeats, which proportionally reflects the average length of telomeres, i s measured by 
[CONTACT_956] [ qPCR ])20) on T1 fresh biopsy samples, only . 
 
To explore the  determinants of response and resistance to M6620, biopsy tissue will be collected 
from  all participants enrolling to the translational lead -in study at baseline  and on treatment . IHC 
will be performed for selected biomarkers including H2AX (a marker of d sDNA breaks), 
phosph -CHK1 (downstream of ATR), and possibly also ATM, RAD51, MYC, Cyclin E, and 
ARID1A  as well as others as determined appropriate at the time of analysis . Results from tissue 
analysis will be used to confirm downstream target engagement (i ncreased H2AX), altered 
expression of proteins of interest by [CONTACT_747443].  
 
An optional biopsy at the time of disease progr ession will also be offered to all  participants  
enrolling to the translational lead -in study .  
 
The baseline fresh t issue obtained from participants will also undergo  whole exome  sequencing  
(WES)  at an outside facility . WES enable s a comprehensive analysis of DNA mutation in human  
tumor samples. Gene expression profiling has been demonstrated to predict  disea se-free and 
overall survival in multiple cancers and guide future treatment decisions and biologic 
discovery14-16. The analyses will involve up to [ADDRESS_1022649]  clinical  response.  
 
Additional specimens collected for clinical reasons (e.g. biopsies, effusion/ascites fluid) may be 
collected for correlative studies, if available.

3.2.6  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, 
symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or 
psychiatric illness/social situati ons that would limit compliance with study requirements.  
 
3.2.7  Pregnant women are e xcluded from this study because M6620 is an agent with the 
potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.  Because there is an unknown but 
potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother 
with M6620,  breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with  M6620.  
 
3.2.8  Known HIV-positive participants  are ineligible because of the increased risk of lethal 
infections when treated wi th potentially marrow -suppressive therapy.  
 
3.2.9  Patients with a history of another malignancy are excluded with the exception of 1. 
patients who remain disease -free for 3 years and 2. adequately treated cervical carcinoma 
in situ, non -melanoma skin cancer (e.g . basal cell, squamous cell carcinomas) , low -risk 
thyroid cancer.

3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this tr ial. 
 
 
4. REGISTRATION  PROCEDURES  
 
4.1 General Guidelines for DF/HCC Institutions  
 
Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System  (CTMS)  
OnCore . Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of  protocol therapy. Any participant not 
registered to the protocol before protocol therapy  begins will be considered ineligible and 
registration will be denied.  
 
An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the 
protoc ol-specific eligibility checklist.

Following registration, participants  may begin protocol therapy . Issues that would  cause 
treatment delays should be discussed with the Overall Principal Investigator (PI). If a participant 
does not receive protocol thera py following registration, the pa rticipant’s registration on the 
study  must  be canceled . Registration cancellations  must be made in OnCore as soon as possible.   
 
4.2 Registration Process for DF/HCC Institutions  
 
DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedure for Human Su bject Research Titled Subject Protocol 
Registration (SOP #: REGIST -101) must be followed.   
 
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
Enrollment will begin with the translational lead -in study (cohorts T1, T2, T3 , and T4 , please 
refer to Table 1 ). Participants may be enrolled to any of the cohorts in parallel with no 
observation period or delay between the initiation of treatment for any of the patients. When 
enrollment to the translational study cohorts has been completed, a review of available safety, 
efficacy, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacokinetic data will occur prior to the initiation of the 
phase II trial. The review will involve the overall principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_747421], any applicable study team members , as well as consultation w ith 
[COMPANY_006] KGaA (EMD Serono)  as appropriate.  
 
5.1 Treatment Regimen  
 
M6620 will be administered  to all participants  twice weekly on cycle days 1,  4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22  
and 2 5 via intravenous (IV)  infusion at a dose of 24 0 mg/m2, with 28 consecutive days defined as 
a treatment cycle. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient  basis.  Reported adverse 
events and potential risks are described in Secti on 7.  Appropriate dose modifications  are 
described in Section 6 .

Body surface area (BSA) to be calculated per institutional standards of practice. In the event of 
changes in participant weight, institutional standards of practice should be followed for dose re-
calculations.  
 
5.3.2  Infusion -Related Reactions  
 
M6620 is associated with infusion -related reactions. Systemic infusion -related reactions to 
M6620  may include signs or symptoms such as pruritus, flushing, chills/rigors, urticaria/rash,  
headache, bronchospasm/ dyspnea,  hypotension or hypertension,  and mental status changes,  
among others. Some systemic infusion -related reactions to M6620  have been serious. In almost 
all cases, these reactions occurred within minutes of the second exposure to M6620 . All subjects 
have fully recovered with standard treatment for th e reaction s, including immediate 
discontinuation of the inciting infusion and administration of IV corticosteroid and antihistamine, 
as well as IV fluids and oxygen when clinically indicated.  
 
If any subjec t develops pruritus, flushing, or any other symptom suggestive of a systemic 
infusion reaction, standard measures may be employed to manage these symptoms (e.g., 
antihistamines and/or steroids ). 
 
In the event of the occurrence of any Grade 2 or greater inf usion -related reaction, the M6620 
infusion should be immediately stopped. Participants should be treated in accordance with 
institutional standards of practice. In the event of a Grade 2 infusion -related reaction, the 
infusion may be resumed at the treatin g investigator’s discretion upon resolution of symptoms to  
baseline. If symptoms recur following re -initiation, the infusion should be discontinued. In the 
event of any Grade 3 or greater infusion -related reaction, protocol therapy should be permanently 
discontinued.  
 
If a participant experienced a prior Grade 1 or Grade 2 infusion -related reaction, at the treating 
investigator’s discretion the participant may be pre -medicated prior to subsequent infusions. 
Standard desensitizing measures should be followed  (e.g. premedication with 200 mg 
hydrocortisone or equivalent approximately 60 minutes  prior to the infusion, and 25 -50 mg of 
diphenhydramine  hydrochloride or equivalent approximately 30 minutes prior to the infusion). 
At the treating investigator’s discre tion, the rate of the infusion may be extended beyond 60 
minutes , but may not exceed 90 minutes .

27 5.4 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_634959] M6620 may be administered 
with the intent to treat the participant's maligna ncy, with the exception of palliative radiation 
therapy with the site principal investigator’s agreement. M6620 should be held during palliative 
radiation therapy. Bisphosphonate or denosumab use is permitted. Participants with prostate 
cancer may continue androgen deprivation therapy, including luteinizing hormone -releasing 
hormone LHRH -analogues , as long as the therapy was initiated prior to study entry . 
 
Patients should be monitored during M6620 ( VX-970) infusion for acute hypersensitivity or 
severe infusion reactions, which may include loss of consciousness and/or hemodynamic 
instability, including hypotension. In the event of one of these reactions, the infusion should be 
stopped immediately,  and standar d supportive measures should be applied according to the 
presentation. This may include administration of fluids and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].  
 
Investigators should use appropriate supportive medications to address toxicities that arise  
during the study, including but not limited to anti -emetics, anti -diarrheals, and blood product 
transfusion. Use of colony -stimulating factors (CSFs) should be avoided when possible. 
Investigators may use CSFs as medically necessary to address a current epi[INVESTIGATOR_3921]. 
Primary pr ophylactic use of CSFs is prohibited. Secondary prophylactic use of CSFs  per ASCO 
guidelines  following an instance of a neutropenic epi[INVESTIGATOR_747422]’s discretion . 
 
M6620  absorbs in the UV -visib le radiation spectrum and is  widely distributed to tissues, 
including the skin, so subjects should be cautioned to minimiz e exposure to the sun and other 
sources of visible and UV radiation  when possible . Participants should be advised to  take 
protective m easures when necessary , including wearing a broad -spectrum  sunscreen with high 
SPF and protective clothing.

28 5.5 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Protocol Therapy  
 
Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and 
tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event (s), treatment may continue 
until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
 Disease progression , unless the participant is exhibiting clinical benefit as determined 
by [CONTACT_12707]  
 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of t reatment  
 
 Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
 
 Participan t decide s to withdraw from the protocol therapy  
 
 General or  specific changes in the participant's condition render the participan t 
unacceptable for further treatment in t he judgment of the treating investigator  
 
Participants  will be rem oved from the protocol therapy  when any of the se criteria apply.  The 
reason for removal from protocol therapy, and the date the participan t was rem oved , must be 
documented in the case report f orm (CRF) . Alternative care options will be discussed with the 
participant.  
 
The research team will update  the relevant Off  Treatment  information in OnCore.  
 
In the event of unusual or life -threatening complications, treating investigators must immediately 
notify the Overall PI,  Gregory M . Cote MD, PhD  at [ADDRESS_1022663].  Participants  removed from protocol therapy  for unacceptable adverse 
event (s) will be followed until re solution or stabilization of the adverse event.  
 
5.7 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Study  
 
Participants will be removed from study when any of the following criteria apply:  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Withdrawal of consent for data submission  
 Death  
 Completion of the 30 day follow up period after study drug discontinuation, or resolution 
or stabilization of any unacceptable adverse events (whichever is longer)  
 
The reason for taking a participant off study, and the date the participan t was rem oved, must be 
document ed in the case report f orm (CRF) .

Patients who require replacement and otherwise do not meet 5.5   Criteria  for Taking a Participant 
Off Protocol Therapy and/or 5.7  Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Study may continue on 
study protocol . 
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE M ODIFICATIONS  
 
Dose delays and modifications will be made as indicated in the following table(s). The 
descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Ter minology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for dose delays and dose modifications. A 
copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website  
 http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .  
 
6.1 Dose Delays  
 
The study agent may be held for a maximum of 28 days to allow for recovery of toxicity. 
Participants requiring a longer delay should be removed  from protocol therapy. Participants who 
are deriving clinical benefit who require a longer hold may be allowed to continue treatment 
following discussion and agreement with the overall principal investigator.  
 
If a participant’s dosing is held, the counti ng of cycle days and assessment schedule will 
continue without interruption. For example, a participant who does not receive their Cycle 1 Day 
8 infusion  due to toxicity may restart dosing on Cycle 1 Day 1 1 and proceed with their next 
scheduled visit as pr eviously planned (Cycle 1 Day 1 1). Interim  clinic  visits may be conducted as 
clinically necessary to manage toxicity; however, the cycle will not restart due to adverse events  
and held infusions  will not be administered or “made up” following toxicity reso lution.  
Assessments during drug holds (laboratory values, vitals signs, exam, etc.) are only required as 
clinically indicated and will not be counted as protocol violations if not performed.    
 
6.2 Dose Modifications  
 
Dose reductions may be made in accordance with the tables below. Dose reductions below 120 
mg/m2 will not be permitted. Participants requiring dose reductions below 120 mg/m2 should be 
discontinued from protocol therapy. Once a participant’s dose has been reduced it may be re -
escalated to a previous dose level  after discussion with the site principal investigator .

6.4 Overdose  
 
There is currently no specific treatment in the event of overdose with M6620 and possible 
symptoms of overdose are not established. Adverse reactions associated with overdose should be 
treated symptomatically and should be managed appropriately.  
 
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIS T AND REPORTING REQU IREMENTS  
 
Adverse event monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The list of 
Expected Toxicities ( Section 7.2)  and the definitions and characteristics of an observed AE 
(Section 7.1  and Section 7.3 ) will determine whether the event requires expedited reporting in 
addition  to routine reporting.  
 
7.1 Definitions   
 
7.1.1  Adverse Event (“AE”)  
 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study subje ct 
administered a medicinal  product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable  and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medic inal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
 
7.1.2     Special Considerations  
 
 Use of a medicinal product during pregnancy or breastfeeding: reports where embryo, 
fetus or child may have been exposed to medicinal products (eith er through maternal

DF/HCC Protocol #:  18-274 
Protocol Version Date:   January 27, [ADDRESS_1022667] via semen following paternal 
exposure) , 
 Reports of medication errors, uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, including 
misuse and abuse of the product . 
 
Special Considerations will  be described in the Final Study Report or any interim reports, 
as applicable.  
 
7.1.3     Serious Adverse Events (“SAE” or “SAEs”)  
 
A SAE is any AE as defined above, which also fulfills at least one of the seriousness 
criteria below:  
 results in death,  
 is life-threatening1), 
 requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25411],  
 results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity , 
 is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect , or 
 is otherwise considered as medically important2). 
1) Life-threatening in this context refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk 
of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that 
hypothetically might have caused death if more severe.  
2) Medical and scientific judgement s hould be exercised in deciding whether other 
situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical 
events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747423]. Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home  for allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747424].  
7.1.4    Safety Issues/Concerns  
 
A safety issue/concern is defined as an important identified risk  or important potential 
risk. Safety issues/concerns are events which may occur during the Study, not falling 
under the defin ition of S[LOCATION_003]Rs and consequently not being  subject of the reporting 
requirements for S[LOCATION_003]Rs. Examples are events related to the conduct of the Study or the 
development of an investigational medicinal product  likely to affect the safety of 
subjects, such as  (but not limited to):  
 a major safety finding from a newly completed animal study (such as carcinogenicity),  
 recommendations of the DSMB, if any, where relevant for the safety of subjects,

Medical conditions present in a patient and documented at the time of Study enrolment,  
and that do not worsen in severity or frequency during the Study  and are defined as   
baseline medical conditions ; are NOT to be considered AE s. 
 
An abnormal laboratory value will not be a ssessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is 
considered by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change from baseline.  
 
7.1.6    Events not to be considered SAEs  
 
Previously p lanned (prior to signing the informed consent form ) surgeries , and non -
disease related elective surgeries  planned during the c ourse of the study,  should not be 
reported as SAEs unless the underlying  medical condition has worsened or appea red 
during the course of the study.  
 
Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747425] ’s medical history at the time of study enrollment should not be 
considered SAEs.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747426] a 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] ( e.g., for the administration of study therapy or other protocol -
required procedure) should not  be considered SAEs.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the  outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Death due to disease pro gression should not be reported as an SAE unless the investigator 
deems  it to be rel ated to the use of study drug . 
 
7.2 Expected Toxicities  
 
For this protocol only , the AEs/grades  listed below  do not require expedited reporting to the 
Overall PI, Funder or th e DFCI IRB .  However, they still  must be reported through the routine 
reporting mechanism (i.e. case report form). All the adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) described in 
this section are assessed as expected events for regulatory reporting purposes . Please ref er to the 
investigator’s brochure for M6620 for the most up -to-date information.  
 
 Infusion related reactions (including flushing, pruritus, rash, rash erythematous, rash 
macular,  rash pruritic , rhinitis allergic, erythema, eyelid edema, facial edema, and 
hypersensitivity)  
 Infusion site reactions (including infusion site erythema, catheter site pruritus, catheter 
site related reaction, infusion site extravasation, catheter site pain, catheter site rash, 
infusion site discomfort, infusion site pruritus, infu sion site rash, injection site rash, and

9. BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE , AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
 
 
9.1 Archival Tissue Collection  (All Participants ) 
 
Archival tissue is required for enrollment to the trial. Archival tissue may be either a formalin -
fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) block or unstained slides. Participants  undergoing a baseline 
fresh tumor biopsy who do not have  sufficient archival tissue at study entry may be  allowed to  
use tissue from the fresh biopsy in lieu of archival tissue . Pediatric participants without  sufficient 
archival tissue at study entry are not required to undergo fresh tumor biopsy.   
 
Please refer to the protocol laborator y manual for specific handling and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931].  
 
 
9.2 Fresh Tumor Tissue Biopsies  (Translational Lead -in Cohorts T1, T2, T3  Only ; Optional for T4 )

 Biopsy #1: Fresh tumor tissue biopsies will be obtain ed at baseline from  all T1, T2, and 
T3 patients  enrolling to the translational lead -in study . Biopsy is optional for T4.  
o The baseline fresh tumor biopsy  may be obtained any time before the participant’s 
Cycle 1 Day 1.  
o At the time the baseline biopsy sample is obtained, a germline blood sample 
should also be collected.  
o For cohorts T2 and T3, fresh biopsy is not required for patie nts with adequate 
archival biopsy available (15 slides; lower numbers may be allowed with 
permission from the overall PI)  provided that the samples are not older than 6 
months and the patient has not received systemic therapy  between the time of 
biopsy an d consent for study 18 -274 
 Biopsy #2: On-treatment biopsy will be obtained from all T1, T2, and T3 participants if 
medically feasible  (optional for T4) .  
o The biopsy  should be scheduled to occur  within  30 hours of the  end of the 
infusion of the fifth (5th) dose of study drug . Following agreement with the site 
principle investigator, the biopsy may alternately be obtained within 30 hours 
following the completion of the seventh (7th) dose of study drug.   
o PT and PTT should be collected before Biopsy #2  
o The bio psy should not be performed if the patient did not receive the study drug  
infusion . If a participant does not receive their planned study drug infusion due to 
toxicity , every effort should be made to re -schedule the biopsy to occur  within 30 
hours of when they actually receive  their fifth (or seventh) dose of study drug. In 
the event re -scheduling of the biopsy is not feasible it will not be considered a 
protocol violation , however  the toxicity necessitating the dose hold and the reason 
the biopsy was not o btained must be clearly documented  and discussed with the 
site principal investigator . 
 Biopsy #3: An additional optional biopsy at the time of disease progression  will be 
offered to  all participants.  
o The ti me of progression biopsy should be obtained prior  to the initiation of 
another anti -cancer therapy  when possible . In the event this is not feasible, the 
time of progression biopsy may be obtained up to [ADDRESS_1022681] progressed.  
 On the same day as the collection of any of the biopsies , a single  PK sample will be 
obtained . Please refer to  Section  9.3 and the protocol laboratory manual for specific  
collection,  handling , and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931].  
 Any participant who is unable to complete both the baseline and on -treatment biopsies 
will be replaced to allow sufficient collection of pharmacody namic data to evaluate the 
primary objective of the translational lead -in study.  
 If the biopsy is deemed unsafe, the patient may enroll with the permission of the overall 
PI

9.4 ATM Mutation Status and Immunohistochemistry  
 
 For all ATM patients (T2 and Cohort 2) mutation status will be reviewed for eligibility 
by [CONTACT_28778] (Cote), and if necessary, the DFCI site PI (Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]), other site PIs, and 
laboratory collaborators.  
 For non -truncating ATM mutations, the NGS data wi ll be evaluated for probability of 
ATM protein inactivation by [CONTACT_28778] (Cote),  the DFCI site PI (Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]), other site 
PI’s, and laboratory collaborators. If the mutation is suggestive of ATM inactivation the 
eligibility will be confirmed by [CONTACT_747450] (Cote), the DFCI site PI (Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]), and 
laboratory collaborators.  
 If the patient and ATM mutation meet eligibility, the patient may be enrolled on study in

For the p urposes of this study, participants  should be re-evaluated for response every 8 weeks  (± 
7-day scheduling window) .  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be 
obtained not less than 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international c riteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) 
[Eur J Ca  45:228 -247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter i n the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the 
RECIST criteria.

(Note:  Participants  who exhibit objective disease progression prior to t he end of cycle 1

baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have 
received at least one cycle of t herapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for non -target disease.  The response assessment is based on the 
presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.

47 (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non -measurable dise ase.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, i nflammatory breast disease, 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all considered  
non-measurable.  
 
Note: Cysti c lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic meta stases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -
cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as 
target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All mea surable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions  and recorded and  measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their siz e (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and r eported 
as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the 
short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurab le dimension of the 
disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All othe r lesions  (or sites of disease)  including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions  and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow up.  
 
11.1.3  Metho ds for Evaluation of Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in m etric notation using a ruler, calipers , 
or a digital measurement tool .  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the b eginning 
of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_432379] n unless the lesion(s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].

48  
Clinical lesions . Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm in diame ter as 
assessed using calipers  (e.g., skin nodules).  In  the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray.  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined an d surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]; h owever, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI . This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or less. If CT scans  have slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice 
the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, sp atial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI  is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the l esions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be use d and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body  scans 
should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
FDG -PET. While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is some times 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis 
of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
(a) Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
(b)  No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is 
PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease 
on CT, additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be t he date of the initial 
abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic 
images, this is not PD.  
(c)  FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a resp onse to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_205991] e-specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches

49 may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which  is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
PET-CT. At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical  diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however,  that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
MIBG (meta -iodobenzylguanidine) .The following is recommended, to assure high 
quality images are obtained.  
Patient pre paration: Iodides, usually SSKI (saturated solution of potassium iodide), 
are administered to reduce thyroidal accumulation of free radioiodine, preferably 
beginning the day prior to injection and continuing for 3 additional days (4 days 
total). For infant s and children,  one drop t.i.d. is sufficient , for adolescents 2 drops 
t.i.d., and for adults 3 drops t.i.d.  Participants  and/or parents are asked about exposure 
to potential interfering agents. If none is noted, an indwelling intravenous line is 
establish ed. The dose of MIBG is administered by [CONTACT_67481] 90 
seconds.  
Images from the head to the distal lower extremities should be obtained.  
I-123MIBG scintigraphy is performed to obtain both planar and tomographic images.  
Planar: Anteri or and posterior views from the top of the head to the proximal lower 
extremities are obtained for 10 minutes at 24 hours and occasionally at 48 hours 
following injection of 10 mCi/1.7 square meters of body surface area (~150 μCi/kg, 
maximum 10 mCi). Anter ior views of the distal lower extremities are adequate. A 
large field of view dual head gamma camera with low energy collimators is preferred.  
 
SPECT: Most participants  receiving I -[ADDRESS_1022692]/CT may be perfo rmed at institutions with this capacity.  
 
Ultrasound . Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used

Endoscopy , Laparoscopy . The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised . However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence  following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Tumor markers . Tumor markers alone cann ot be used to assess response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, t hey must normalize for a participant  to be 
considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response 
(in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been 
published [ JNCI  96:487 -488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461 -3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  
26:1148 -1159,  2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed 
CA-[ADDRESS_1022694] -line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534 -1535, 2000].  
 
Cytology, Histology . These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmat ion of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effe ct of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference th e smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  
the appearance of one or more new lesions  is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient

study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete R esponse (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_313814], and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal 
Investigator).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of New Lesions  
 
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference  in 
scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something 
other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or 
flare of pre -existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow -up scan in an 
anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will 
indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size etc.), follow -up 
evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirmed, 
progression sho uld be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion 
was discovered.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (takin g as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
13.1.1  Translational Lead -in Study  
 
A small translational lead -in study will be conducted prior to the initiation of the phase II trial. 
The translational lead -in will serve to  determine changes in the pharmacodynamic endpoints of 
phospho -Chk1 and H2AX in biopsy specimens of patients treated with M6620 monotherapy , 
and to evaluate  the preliminary anti-cancer activity of M6620 monotherapy  in selected cancer 
populations , including :  
 
 Cohort T1: ATRX -mutated LMS  
 Cohort T2: ATM -mutated solid tumors  
 Cohort T3: BRCA1/2  and other HR -mutated cancers, malignancies with replicative stress, 
and ARID1A -mutated cancers.  
 Cohort T4: SDH -deficient  GIST  
 
Each cohort will enroll 6 participants. Mandatory baseline and on -treatment biopsies will be 
collected from all T1, T2, and T3 participants, and an optional time -of-progression biopsy will 
be offered to all participants. Biopsies are optional for T4. Any T1/T2/T3  patient unable to 
complete both the baseline and on -treatment biopsies will be replaced to allow for sufficient 
collection of pharmacodynamic data.  Non-parametric paired analysis will be conducted to assess 
the sign ificance of changes between baseline and on -treatment pharmacodynamics parameters. 
With 6 samples the study will be powered (80%) to detect an effect size of 1.067 in mean of 
paired difference between baseline and on -treatment phospho -Chk1 and H2AX  with a  
significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_1022698] and assuming that the actual 
distribution is double exponential.  
 
The probability of rejecting the treatment in the lead -in phase for a true but unknown rate of 60% 
reduction in baseline phospho -CHK1 and a 50% increase in γH2AX of 50% is 0.65. If this rate is 
20% the probability of rejection is 0.98 and if the rate is 80% th e probability of rejection is 0.098  
 
Following the completion of enrollment to the translational lead -in study, a review of all 
available safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacokinetic data will occur prior to the 
initiation of the phase II trial. Review will be conducted by [CONTACT_216153], site 
principal investigators, any applicable study team members, as well as consultation with [COMPANY_006]

the translational lead -in study may occur with a protocol amendment following the review.  
 
 
13.1.2  Phase II  
 
After completion of the review of the initial translational lead -in study, a phase II, five -cohort 
basket trial with the primary endpoint of disease contro l rate at 16 weeks  will open . The disease 
control rate is defined as achievement of confirmed objective response (complete or partial 
response), or stable disease that is confirmed at 16 weeks from the baseline disease evaluation.  
We will enroll 25 patien ts in cohort s 1A, 2 -5 following a two -stage approach. We will enroll 30 
patients in a single stage for cohort 1B.  
 
Assuming the null and alternative hypothesis (null: 15%, alternative: 35%) is the same among 
cohorts  1A and 2-5, at the first stage analysis , we will need to observe at least [ADDRESS_1022699] the null hypothesis and accept the 
treatment as having value for further study.  The overall power for disease control rate at 16 
weeks is 81%.  The overall type I error, the chance of incorrectly rejecting  the null hypothesis is 
7%.  The probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_222094] 60%.  The 
operating characteristics of this design are  based on the two -stage Minimax design. While cohort 
1B is conducted as a single cohort, the hypo thesis tested are identical  to the ones in the other 
cohorts. With one-sided type 1 error of 7% (as in the other cohort) this arm will have 87% power 
to differentiate between the null of 15% and alternative of 35%. The null will be rejected if at 
least [ADDRESS_1022700] controlled disease.  
 
It is estimated that ~50% of LMS are ALT+. Thus, f or cohort 1B, study characteristics favor 
enrollment to a single stage of [ADDRESS_1022701] 
approximately 15 patients to be included in this analysis. With 15 patients, the study will be 
sufficiently powered (at least 80%) to detect an increase of at least 25% from the null of poor 
disease control rate of 15% with one -sided significance level of 0.07. if at least [ADDRESS_1022702] 
72% probability of observing one or more toxicities with a true rate as low as 5%.  With 25 -30 
treated patients in each cohort, the maximum width of a 90% two -sided confidence interval for 
any estimated adverse event proportion ± 18%.  
 
  
13.2 Sample Size  and Study Duration  
 
A total of 24 participants will be enrolled to the translational lead -in study among the three 
cohorts, and a maximum of 205 participants  will be enr olled to the phase II trial among the five

56 cohorts. Total study duration  (translational lead -in and phase II)  is estimated to be approximately 
[ADDRESS_1022703] one dose of study 
medication will be assessed for response, even if there are major protocol therapy 
deviations. Each participant should be assigned one of the following categories: 1) 
complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early 
death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of 
other cause , or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). By [CONTACT_480], 
category 9 usually designates the "unknown" status of any type of data in a clinical 
database.  
 
13.3.3  Evaluation of the Primary Pharmacodynamic Endpoint (Translational Lead -in Study On ly) 
 
All eligible participants who successfully underwent both the baseline and the on -
treatment  biopsies will be assessed for pharmacodynamic response as measured by 
[CONTACT_747453] -CHK1 and H2AX.  Any participant who was unable to undergo both 
the bas eline and on -treatment biopsy will be replaced. In the event the biopsy tissue 
obtained from either the baseline or on -treatment biopsy was not sufficient for analysis, 
the participant will be replaced.  
 
14. PUBLICATION PLAN  
 
The results should  be made public within [ADDRESS_1022704] that meets the requirements of the International Committee  of 
Medical Journal Editors. A full report of the outcomes should be made public no later than three 
(3) years after the end of the study .

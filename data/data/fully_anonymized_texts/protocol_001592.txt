Secondary Objectives: 
 To characterize the PK  profile of VIS649 
 To evaluate the effect of ethni city on the pharmacokinetic (PK)  
profile of a single intravenously (IV) administered dose of VIS 649 
in healthy Japanese and n on-Japanese subjects

Study Design This is a Phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled,  double-blind, single 
ascending dose study of IV VIS649 in healthy subjects. 
Potential subjects will be carefully screened for eligibility p rior to study 
enrollment. Randomization and blinding will occur according to a core 
randomization list administered b y the site’s unblinded pharmac ist. 
The stud y will enroll up to [ADDRESS_988908] four different  dose levels 
(0.5, 2.0, 6.0 and 12 mg/kg respectively), enrolling 9 subjects  per cohort. 
Cohort 5 will be on 6.0 mg/kg only and will enroll up to 15 sub jects. 
Subjects will be randomized to VI S649 or placebo in a ratio of 7:2 (7 active, 
2 placebo), except for cohort 5, which will be a ratio of 10:5.  Back-up 
subjects who are not randomized into the cohort, but otherwise meet 
eligibility, may be re-screened after discussion among the Principal 
Investigator, Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor. 
Eligible subjects will report to the Clinical Pharmacology Unit  ( C P U )  a t  
study check-in (Day -1) and will be required to stay in the CPU  until Day 2 
([ADDRESS_988909] infusion). On Day 1, a single dose of VIS649 or placebo will 
be administered IV in the morning after a light meal (as per th e clinical unit 
standard). Pharmacokinetics sampling will occur on Day 1 starti ng with a 
collection prior to the start of infusion, at the end of infusi on (60 minutes), 
and at [ADDRESS_988910] PK samples drawn on Days 1-3, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 1 12. 
Pharmacodynamics sampling (serum immunoglobulin levels) will oc cur at 
baseline, Day 3 and weekly thereafter through the Week 8 visit,  then once 
every two weeks through Week 16 (i.e., Weeks 10, 12, 14, and 16 ). 
Sentinel subjects will be utilized in cohorts 1-4; the first tw o subjects in each 
cohort will be randomized to recei ve either VIS649 (n=1) or pla cebo (n=1) 
and will receive study drug at l east 24 hours before the remain ing subjects in 
the cohort (7 subjects) are dosed. These [ADDRESS_988911]-admi nistration 
period will be reviewed to determine whether it is appropriate to proceed 
with enrollment of the remaining subjects in the cohort as plan ned. This will 
occur for each dose escalation. T he remaining 7 subjects in coh orts 1-4 will 
be randomized to receive VIS649 (n=6) or matched placebo (n=1).  Cohort 5 
does not require sentinel subjects as the dose of VIS649 has al ready been 
evaluated in cohort 3. 
The maximum duration of participation (Screening through End-of -study) 
for individual subjects will be approximately 20 weeks (5 months) with the 
possibility to extend up to 28 weeks (7 months). Each subject w ill participate 
in a Screening period lasting 1 to 28 days (0 to 4 weeks), an i n-house stay for 
[ADDRESS_988912]-dosing (112 days); however , two 
additional follow-up visits may be performed, at Weeks [ADDRESS_988913] not returned to>l ower limits 
of normal by [CONTACT_56421] 16 visit or if emerging trial data sugges t a value of 
later follow-up (i.e., for detection of anti-drug antibody resp onses). 
Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) A single dose of VIS649 administered IV over approximately one hour, at 
four different dose levels: 0.5, 2.0, 6.0 and 12 mg/kg respecti vely, with a 
fifth cohort, to receive a 6.0 mg/ kg single dose of VIS649 admi nistered 
intravenously on Day 1 in one arm and a single intramuscular in jection of 
TENIVAC® vaccine o n Day 28 into th e opposite arm. 
Number of Subjects Up to 51 subjects may be enrolled. A total o f 16 Japanese subjects 
(4 subjects each in cohorts 1-4) and 20 non-Japanese subjects (up to 
5 subjects each in cohorts 1-4) may be enrolled and randomized to receive a 
single dose of VIS649 or placebo.  No more than one Japanese sub ject per 
cohort may be randomized to recei ve placebo in cohorts 1-4. Up to 15 
subjects are expected to be enr olled in cohort 5 with targeted but 
non-mandatory enrollment of up to 5 Japanese subjects. No more than two 
Japanese subjects may be randomized to receive placebo in cohor t 5.

 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background 
VIS649 is a humanized immunoglobulin G (IgG 2) monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks 
the biological actions of the B-cell growth factor, APRIL (A Pr oliferation Inducing Ligand), 
preventing binding to its receptors, transmembrane activator an d CAML interactor (TACI) and 
B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). Through these receptor intera ctions, APRIL regulates B-cell 
mediated immune responses through several mechanisms, including  the induction of class switch 
recombination as well as promotion of plasma cell survival.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
VIS649 binds human APRIL with pi[INVESTIGATOR_724263]/avidity as measured by [CONTACT_488]-binding 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant trimeric AP RIL. VIS649 blocks 
recombinant APRIL-APRIL receptor interactions, thereby [CONTACT_724294]-mediated signaling 
and B-cell proliferation. VIS649 also binds cynomolgus monkey A PRIL, with similar affinity 
and inhibition of APRIL mediated signaling in both species. The physiological and toxicological effects of VIS649 were therefore evaluated in cynomolgus monkey s, in three preclinical studies. 
In an initial non- Good Labor atory Practice (non-GLP) in-vivo  toxicology study, weekly 
administration of IV VIS649 at a dose of 25 mg/kg for 8 weeks resulted in an approximately 70% reduction in serum IgA levels (in comparison with control a nimals) with minimal effect on 
serum IgM, and an approximately 40% reduction in serum IgG leve ls. Hematology assessment 
did not reveal significant pertu rbation in white blood cell (WB C), lymphocyte, or leukocyte 
counts and there were no signifi cant differences between treatm ent groups noted in the 
peripheral blood and tissue immune profiling, which included markers for total T cells, helper T 

Visterra Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
VIS649-[ADDRESS_988923] ered weekly over 4 weeks to g roups of cynomolgus monkeys 
at doses of 0 (control), 0.5, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg, with an 8-week recovery observation period. 
Following treatment with 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg doses, there was a  
reduction from baseline in serum IgA levels. Monkeys treated wi th 10 mg/kg doses had an 
 reduction in serum IgA levels, similar to the  e f f e c t  o b s e r v e d  i n  t h e  p r i o r  
study with 25 mg/kg dosing for [ADDRESS_988924] of VIS649 on serum IgG levels , and IgM levels were not 
altered notably, in comparison wi th control animals. Peripheral  blood lymphocyte counts were 
not significantly affected, incl uding the following cell popula tions: T-lymphocytes (including 
T-helper and cytotoxic T-cell subsets), natural killer cells, m onocytes, and B-lymphocytes 
(including naïve, resting memory and activated memory B-lymphoc yte subsets). 
These studies led to the conduct of a [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) 
GLP-compliant 4-week repeat-dos e IV toxicology study of VIS649 in cynomolgus monkeys, 
with a 20-week recovery peri od. Monkeys received weekly VIS649 in jectio n s f o r 4  w eek s,  at 
doses of 0 mg/kg (control), 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg. 
VIS649-related reductions in total serum IgA levels were observ ed in all VIS649-treated animals 
 and the reductions were reversible as trends towards return to baseline were 
observed at all doses. All [ADDRESS_988925] of VIS649 on measured plasma cytokine conce ntrations in the monkey 
toxicology studies (nor did VIS649 stimulate significant cytoki ne release in an in vitro  human 
peripheral blood lymphocyte c ytokine release assay). 
To test the effect of VIS649 on de-novo humoral immune responses to a novel (T-cell dependent) antigen challenge, monkeys were vaccinated with keyh ole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) 

Visterra Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
VIS649-[ADDRESS_988926] level 
(NOAEL) was considered to be 100 mg/kg/dose  
 
. The 
100 mg/kg dose is 5-fold greater than the 
highest dose (20 mg/kg) permitted in this first-in-human study and 200-fold greater than the 
lowest dose (0.5 mg/kg) to be admin istered in this first-in-hum an (FIH) study. 
 
 
  
 
 
The relatively selective and reversible effect of VIS649 on serum immunoglobulin levels 
 with maximal (but not completely  suppressive) effect on IgA 
suggests that APRIL inhibition ma y be uniquely suited as a ther apeutic strategy for IgA 
nephropathy.

TENIVAC® is a vaccine indicated f or active immunization for the prevention of tetanus and 
diphtheria in persons 7 years of  age and older. Vaccines such a s TENIVAC® that are comprised 
of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids are referred to as Td vaccine s. Tetanus and diphtheria 
vaccination is recommended for a ll adults, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) Advisory Committee on Imm unization Practices advising that individuals without 
contraindication receive booster tetanus immunization (with tet anus toxoid or tetanus/diphtheria 
combined toxoid vaccination every ten years. Additional details  can be found in the 2018

1.2. Rationale for the Clinical Study 
This FIH study will assess the safety and tolerability, pharmac okinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics 
(PD) of VIS649, a humanized IgG [ADDRESS_988927] 
the following potential toxicitie s for single dose administrati on: 
1. Infusion reactions: Anaphylaxis, fever, chills, rigors, nausea,  vomiting, pain, headache, 
dizziness, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, hypotension, hype rtension, pruritus, rash, 
urticaria, angioedema, diarrhea , tachycardia, and chest pain 
2. Delayed allergic reactions: Serum sickness (i.e., urticaria, fe ver, general glandular 
enlargement, joint pains) 
3. General: Injection site reaction 
Mechanism based potential toxicities that might be anticipated based on VIS649 mechanism of 
action and preclinical  studies include: 
IgA suppression risks: VIS649 treatment is expected to reduce human IgA levels, with  a  
predicted maximal reduction (with repeated dosing) to approxima t e l y  7 5 %  b e l o w  b a s e l i n e .  I n  
this single-ascending dose study, this degree of suppression is  unlikely to be achieved, but it is 
anticipated that at least in the  higher dose cohorts, IgA level s will be reduced below baseline, 
with effect persis ting over weeks.

Selective IgA deficiency (defined as persistently undetectable IgA,  is 
the most common inherited immunodeficiency syndrome (occurring in about 1 in 500 Caucasian 
individuals). []. While this condition has heretofore been cons idered generally benign and is 
asymptomatic in the majority of patients, there is increasing r ecognition that selective IgA 
deficiency may be associated w ith recurrent sinopulmonary infec tion, allergy, autoimmunity and 
gastrointestinal microbiome perturbation [ 4, 5]. The risk for occurrence of these complications in 
the current study is low for multiple reasons: 1) IgA is expect ed to be suppressed, but not 
reduced to undetectable level s, 2) in this single dose-study, the effects on IgA levels are expected 
to be transient, and 3) the syndrome of selective IgA deficienc y is often associated with 
additional immunologic impairments including T-cell disorders a nd common variable 
immunodeficiency syndrome. 
IgG suppression risks:  VIS649 is expected to have a moderate effect on serum IgG leve ls (with 
approximately 40% suppression-below-baseline nadir values predi cted). 
The normal range for serum IgG i s approximately 600 to 1600 mg/ dL in adults,  
 
 
In common variable immunodeficien cy (CVID), also known as acqui red 
hypogammaglobulinemia, total IgG levels are typi[INVESTIGATOR_247704] 250  mg/dL with median values at 
diagnosis in two recent US cohort studies of 210 mg/dL and 120 mg/dL, respectively [ 6]. The 
condition is of heterogenous ori gin, with loss of function mutations in an APRIL receptor, TACI, 
identified as one causal association [ 7]. Proposed diagnostic criteria for CVID include: presence 
of hypogammaglobulinemia  plus a history of recurrent or 
chronic infection or autoimmunity and with associated IgA defic iency  or IgM 
deficiency [8]. Common variable immunodeficiency  is associated with recurrent 
otitis media, chronic sinusitis,  and recurrent pneumonia often resulting in bronchiectasis [ 9]. 
Longitudinal studies have demonstr ated high rates of lymphoma a nd diseases of autoimmunity 
[10]. The risk of these complications in the current study is cons idered quite low, given the 
moderate and transient reductions  in IgG levels that are antici pated. 
Non-specific immunosuppression risks: In preclinical toxicology studies, de-novo humoral 
immune responses to a novel antig en were not suppressed, and pe ripheral blood myeloid cell line

 populations were unaffected. Howeve r, there is the possibility of non-specific immunodeficiency 
with potential risk of exacerbation of pre-existing latent infe ction or poor response to new 
infection. These risks are consid ered minimal due to the single -dose design of this trial, and the 
expected transient nature of effects. 
Pharmacodynamic data including measurement of changes in serum IgG, IgA, and IgM levels in 
relation to VIS649 exposure will provide valuable information f or refinement of the human

 3. OVERALL DESIGN AND PLAN OF THE STUDY 
3.1. Overview 
This is a Phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind , single ascending dose study to 
investigate the safety, tolerability, PK/PD of the IV administr ation of VIS649 in healthy subjects. 
The study will be conducted in five sequential dosing cohorts. Cohorts 1-4 will enroll 9 subjects 
per cohort. Cohorts 1-4 will enroll 4 Japanese subjects and wil l be randomized to VIS649 or 
placebo in a ratio of 7:2 (7 active, 2 placebo). No more than o ne Japanese subject per cohort may 
be randomized to receive placebo. The fifth cohort will enroll up to 15 subjects with targeted but 
non-mandatory enrollment of up to 5 Japanese subjects. The subj ects in cohort 5 will be 
randomized to VIS649 or placebo in a ratio of 10:5 (10 active, 5 placebo). No more than two 
Japanese subjects may be random ized to receive placebo in cohor t 5. 
The study is comprised of: 
 A Screening Visit up to 28 days before dosing 
 An in-house stay for approximately 2-3 days, with admission to the study center on 
Day -1, dosing on Day 1, and discharge in the morning of Day 2 
 A post-administration period of 16 weeks 
 Outpatient visits, on Day 3 (+1 day), 7 (± 1 day), 14, 21, 28, 31 (± 1 day) (cohort 5 only), 
35, 42, 49 (cohorts 1-4 only), 56, 70, 84 and 98 (for all visit s not otherwise specified, ± 3 
days) 
 A final Follow-up visit on Day 112 (± 3 days); Two additional f ollow-up visits may 
occur, at Weeks [ADDRESS_988928] not returned to 
>lower limits of normal by [CONTACT_941] W eek 16 (Day 112) visit, or if e merging trial data suggest 
a value of later follow-up (i. e., for detection of ADA response s). 
The total duration of the clini cal study per subject will be up  to approximately 20 weeks 
(5 months), including the Screen ing period with the possibility  of duration exte nding to 28 weeks 
(7 months) if follow-ups visits are required. 
Potential subjects will be carefully screened for eligibility p rior to study enrollment. 
Randomization and blinding will occur according to a core rando mization list administered by 
[CONTACT_779]’s unblinded pharmacist. Back-up subjects who are not r andomized into the cohort, but 
Visterra Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 30 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 otherwise meet eligibility, may be re-screened after discussion  among the Principal Investigator, 
Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor. 
Eligible subjects will report to the Clinical Pharmacology Unit  (CPU) at study check-in (Day -1) 
and will be required to stay in the CPU until Day 2 ([ADDRESS_988929] infusion). On Day 1, a single 
dose of VIS649 or placebo will be administered intravenously in  the morning after a light meal 
(as per the clinical unit standard). Pharmacokinetics sampling will occur on Day [ADDRESS_988930] 
end of infusion. Pharmacokinetics samples will be collected on Days 1-3, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 
and 112. Pharmacodynamics sampling (serum immunoglobulin levels, lymphocytes and sub Ig 
types) will occur as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments (s ee Table  10). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
The initial cohort will be dosed with 0.5 mg/kg of VIS649. Escalation to next dosing level (2.0 mg/kg) will occur after review of blinded safety data thro ugh Day 14 by [CONTACT_144278] (SMC) comprised of the Principal Investigator, an independent Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor. Cohort 3 was reviewed after Day 56 da ta was collected to commence 
enrollment in cohort 4. Assessment of safety will be determined  by [CONTACT_29657]: 
 Vital sign measurements 
 Physical examinations 
 Hematology, chemistry, and urinal ysis laboratory testing 
 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) 
 Adverse events, and 
 Serum immunoglobulin levels

Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 31 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 Pharmacokinetic data will not be available for dose escalation decision making. Pharmacokinetic 
data will be reviewed in a blinded fashion after each cohort is  available, and may result in a dose 
adjustment for subsequent cohorts. Any adjustments will be revi ewed and approved by [CONTACT_1268], Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor. 
If dose escalation is stopped bas ed on available blinded safety  data, the current dose level will be 
considered as the minimum intolerable dose (MID). The dose just below the MID will be 
regarded as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). If the dose escal ation is stopped due to reaching 
exposure limit without dose lim iting safety findings, the MTD w ill not be determined. Dose 
de-escalation may occur in additi onal cohorts, to further refin e clinically relevant dose levels.

3.3. Justification of the Study Design 
This 
study evaluates the safety,  tolerability, and PK/PD of asc ending single doses of VIS649 
administered as an IV infusion. The design is standard and is c onsidered appropriate to meet the 
objectives of the study. 
A double-blind, placebo-controlled study is appropriate and standard for a single ascending dose 
study. This design will minimize bias and provide reference dat a (i.e., data from placebo-treated 
subjects) which will aid in the interpretation of results. The SMC will review available blinded safety, tolerability, and Ig level data after each cohort to co nfirm whether it is safe to proceed 
with the next planned dose, whether the dose escalation should be stopped or if the dose should be lowered, repeated, or titra ted in the subsequent cohort. 
The safety assessments for the s tudy are accepted measures for ensuring safety of subjects during 
a clinical trial. The PK sampling schedule is considered approp riate given the information 
available. The rationale for  dose selection is discussed in Section 5.[ADDRESS_988933](s) data may be 
unblinded. If the toxicity is present in ≥ [ADDRESS_988934] randomized  to active drug, then  dose escalation 
will pause. Depending upon the nature of the event, a decision may be made to resume dosing, to 
proceed into the next cohort at  a lower dose level, or to stop the study. 
Based on safety criteria, the dose adjustment/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_724265]: 
 Adverse event stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]: 
 Any AE of severe intensit y and related causality 
 Any SAE of rela ted causality 
 Vital sign stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]: 
 Symptomatic hypotension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] <85 mmHg). If 
symptomatic hypotension that is related to the study drug is ob served during the 
study, then a minimum of two repeat BP measurements should be o btained over a 
brief period. The mean of the three SBP measurements will be used to determine 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] 
 Tachycardia defined as heart rate >120 beats per minute (bpm) l asting longer than 
30 minutes or with impaired consciousness 
 Electrocardiogram stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]: 
 QT interval  >500 msec 
(If a prolonged QTc interval is observed during the study, then a minimum of two 
repeat ECGs should be obtained over a brief period. The mean of  the three ECGs will 
be used to determine stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418].) 
 Clinical laboratory stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]: 
 Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥3 times the upper limit of norm al (ULN) 
 Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥[ADDRESS_988935] 
 Serum creatinine >1.[ADDRESS_988936]

While subjects are encouraged to complete all study evaluations , they may withdraw from the 
study at any time and for any reason. Every effort will be made  to determine why any subject 
withdraws from the study prematurely. All subjects who withdraw  from the study with an 
ongoing AE must be followed until the event is resolved or deem ed stable. If a subject withdraws 
prematurely after dosing, all data  to be collected prior to dis charge from the clinical site should

VIS649-[ADDRESS_988946] be made to determine the reason(s) why a subject fails to return for the 
necessary visits or is discontinue d from the study. If the subj ect is unreachable by [CONTACT_756], a 
registered letter, at the minimum, should be sent to the subject requesting him/her to contact [CONTACT_27470]. 
Subjects can be replaced, and a replacement randomization number will be generated. The same 
treatment will be allocated t o the replacement subject. 
4.5. Termination of the Clinical Study 
If the Principal Investigator, the Sponsor, or the Medical Monitor becomes aware of conditions or events that suggest a possible hazard to subjects if the cli nical study continues, then the 
clinical study may be terminated after appropriate consultation  among the involved parties. The 
clinical study may be terminated at the Sponsor’s discretion al so in the absence of such a finding. 
Conditions that may warrant termination of the clinical study include, but are not limited to: 
 The discovery of an unexpected, relevant or unacceptable risk t o the subjects enrolled in the

 healthy cynomolgus monkeys at 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg IV once weekly over 28 days. VIS649 
was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys with no VIS649-related clinical findings up to 100 mg/kg; the NOAEL from t his study was 100 mg/kg. 
A maximum recommended starting dose of 5 mg/kg was identified b y considering the NOAEL 
of 100 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys, which translates to a human  equivalent dose of 
100 mg/kg for monoclonal antibody t herapeutics. Applying a safe ty factor of 2X that accounts 
for the measured affinity difference of VIS649 for monkey and h uman APRIL, and an additional 
10X safety factor to account for  potential interspecies differe nces and other unknowns arrives at 
a NOAEL justified starting dose of 5 mg/kg, which is expected t o be well tolerated in humans 
based on cynomolgus monkey studies.

The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_724268]® vaccine throughout the clinical study. The drug 
accountability log includes infor mation such as, randomization number, amount dispensed and 
amount returned to the pharmacy ( if any). Products returned to the pharmacy will be stored under 
the same conditions as products not yet dispensed. The returned  products should be marked as 
‘returned’ and kept separate fr om the products not yet dispense d. 
All dispensing and accountability records will be available for Sponsor review. When the Study Monitor visits PAREXEL, he/she will reconcile the drug accounta bility log with the products 
stored in the PAREXEL pharmacy. 

Visterra Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
VIS649-[ADDRESS_988948] (or designee under the direction of the pharmacist) will dispense 
study drug and TENIVAC® vaccine in a blinded manner for each su bject according to the

After receiving Sponsor approval in writing, PAREXEL is respons ible for returning all unused or 
partially used study drug to the Sponsor or designated third pa rty or for preparing the study drug 
for destruction via carbonization. 
5.6. Subject Identification and Randomization 
5.6.1. Screening Numbers 
All screened subjects are assigned a unique 3-digit subject ide ntification (SID) number 
(001 - 999). The SID numbers identify subjects from time of Scr eening until time of 
randomization. Enrolled subjects  who drop out of the clinical s tudy before randomization will 
retain their SID numbers. 
5.6.2. Randomization Numbers 
Prior to dosing on Day 1, eligible subjects will be assigned a randomization number in 
accordance with the randomization code generated by [CONTACT_352338]. The 
randomization code will be maintai ned in a room with restricted  access to pharmacy personnel 
only. The randomization code will include 4-digit subject numbe rs  Cohort 
and randomization numbers are listed in Table 6 .

Once a randomization number has been allocated to one subject, it may not be assigned to 
another subject. If subjects wit hdrawn prematurely from the stu dy and are replaced under the 
direction of the Sponsor, then a  replacement randomization numb er will be assigned. 
A replacement randomization code will be generated such that re placement subjects are assigned 
to the same treatment as the discontinued subjects. The replace ment randomization code will 
differ only in randomization numbers, which will be 4-digit num bers .

in 100 mL of 0.9 % sodium chloride. Subject weight will be capt ured after admission to the 
research unit (Day -1) and will be used by [CONTACT_274666] f or subject-specific dose 
calculation. VIS649 will be administered intravenously using a volumetric pump and through a 
0.22µm in line IV filter at a rate of 100 mL/hr over the course  of one hour. A saline flush is 
performed after the infusion is complete to ensure that any dru g product remaining in the 
infusion line is administered. Placebo will be 100 mL of 0.9% s odium chloride administered IV 
in an identical manner. For cohort 5 participants, on Da y -1, a single dose of VIS649 o r placebo will be administered 
intravenously in one arm and on Day 28, a single dose of tetanu s/diphtheria vaccine will be 
injected intramuscularly into the opposite arm. Refer to the pharmacy manual for specific details on storage, h andling, and preparation 
information. 
5.8. Compliance 
Dosing will be performed by [CONTACT_23872], qualified personnel design ated by [CONTACT_9532]. The date, time and volume of the administered dose will be documented. Comments 
will be recorded if there are a ny deviations from the planned d osing procedures. 
5.9. Blinding and Breaking the Blind 
The clinical study will be performed in a double-blind manner, for clinical research unit staff 
interacting with study participa nts, with the exception of the persons involved in the preparation 
of the IMPs. These persons w ill not be involved in any other study activities.

Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 49 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 Prior to scheduled unblinding as  described below, the study bli nd should not be broken except in 
a medical emergency (where knowledge of the study drug administ ered would affect the 
treatment of the emergency). The decision to break the blind wi ll be made on a case-by-case 
basis, at the discretion of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_724269]/Medical 
Monitor. The applicable Standard operating procedure (SOP) will  be followed for blind breaking 
procedures. 
As participants in each dosing cohort complete their Week 16 visit, data clean-up and soft-lock 
will be performed for cohorts 1-4 only, in order to allow inter im assessments of blinded data. 
PK/PD analysts will have access to unblinded data at all times,  but those individuals will not be 
involved in study participant interactions. Summaries of treatm ent specific PD responses 
(principally, individual immunogl obulin levels over time and group mean, median, minimum and 
maximum parameters by [CONTACT_724297]) will be prepared a nd shared with the Sponsor, 
in a manner that does not unbli nd individual pati ent treatment assignments. A registry of dummy 
subject identifiers will be cr eated. A physician who is not inv olved in the study will review Ig 
results to maintain the blind for  the Principal Investigator. 
5.10. Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Any medicinal product, prescribed or OTC, including herbal and other nontraditional remedies, 
is considered a concomitant medication. Prior and concomitant m edication use will be recorded 
for the [ADDRESS_988950] 30 days or 5 ha lf-lives, whichever is longer, 
preceding baseline (Day -1) until end-of-study (including presc ription or non-prescription 
[over-the-counter]) medication, except for acetaminophen, ibupr ofen, hormonal contraceptives, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910], vitamins, di etary or herbal remedies). How ever, concomitant medication use 
may be warranted for the treatment of AEs. The use of concomita nt medications to treat AEs 
should be discussed between the Pri ncipal Investigator and the Medical Monitor. 
5.11. Treatment of Overdose 
Standard symptomatic support measures should be used in the cas e of excessive pharmacological 
effects or overdose. No an tidotes are available.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Definitions 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Definition of Adverse Event 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical invest igation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a ca usal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintende d sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whethe r or not related to the medicinal (investigati onal) product. 
Other untoward events occurring in the framework of a clinical study will be recorded as AEs, 
e.g. those occurring during treatment-free periods (including p ost-dosing periods), in association 
with study-related procedures a nd assessments, or under placebo. For study drugs, lack of 
efficacy may be an expected potential outcome and should not be  reported as an AE unless the 
event is unusual in some way, e.g., greater in severity. Concomitant illnesses, which existed prior to entry into the cl inical study, will not be considered 
AEs unless they worsen during the treatment period. Pre-existin g conditions will be recorded as 
part of the subject’s  medical history. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is defined as any untowar d medical occurrence that at an y dose: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening; this means that the subject was at risk of  death at the time of the event; it 
does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused d eath if it were more severe 
 Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_516899] n in existing  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or s ubstantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 
 Is another important medical event (see below) 
Visterra Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
VIS649-[ADDRESS_988952] and ma y require medical or surgical intervention to pre vent one of the 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or in a phys ician’s office, blood dyscrasias 
or seizures that do not result i n in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a nd the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
A distinction should be drawn betw een serious and severe AEs. S everity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_29967]. For examp le, a mild degree of 
gastrointestinal bleeding requiring an overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n for monitoring purposes would be 
considered an SAE, but is not necessarily severe. Similarly, an  AE that is severe in intensity is 
not necessarily an SAE. For example, alopecia may be assessed a s severe in intensity but would 
not be considered an SAE. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding  if an AE is serious and if 
expedited reporting is appropriate. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Adverse Events of Special Interest 
An adverse event of special interest (serious or non-serious) i s one of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, for which  ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_724298]. Such an event 
might warrant further investigation in order to characterize an d understand it. Depending on the 
nature of the event, rapid communication by [CONTACT_724299]. 
Examples of these are all AEs of  Infusion reactions: Fever, chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, pa in, headache, dizziness, 
shortness of breath, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypertension, p ruritus, rash, urticaria, 
angioedema, diarrhea, tac hycardia, and chest pain 
 Delayed allergic reactions: Serum sickness (i.e., urticaria, fever, general glandular 
enlargement, joint pains) 
 General: Injection site reaction 
 Any documented infection

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Recording of Adverse Events 
Adverse events should be collected and recorded for each subjec t from the baseline (Day -1) 
until the end of their participation in the study, i.e. the sub ject has discontinued or completed the 
study. 
Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_423],  or discovered by [CONTACT_310175], non-le ading question such as ‘How 
have you been feeling since you were last asked?’ All AEs and a ny required remedial action will 
be recorded. The nature of AE, date (and time, if known) of AE onset, date (and time, if known) 
of AE outcome to date, severity  and action taken of the AE will be documented together with the 
Principal Investigator’s assessm ent of the seriousness of the A E and causal relationship to study 
drug and/or study procedure. All AEs should be recorded indi vidually in the subject’s own wo rds (verbatim) unless, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1237], the AEs constitute compo nents of a recognized condition, 
disease or syndrome. In the latter case, the condition, disease  or syndrome should be named 
rather than each individual symptom. The AEs will subsequently be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 21.0 or hi gher). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of Adverse Events 
Each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_724270]. [IP_ADDRESS].1. Intensity 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_724271].  Mild: Ordinarily transient sympt oms, does not influence perform ance of subject’s daily 
activities. Treatment is no t ordinarily indicated. 
 Moderate: Marked symptoms, sufficient to make the subject uncom fortable. Moderate 
influence on performance of subj ect’s daily activities. Treatme nt may be necessary. 
 Severe: Symptoms cause considerable discomfort. Substantial inf luence on subject’s daily 
activities. May be unable to cont inue in the study and treatmen t may be necessary. 
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently th an once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event should be noted for that day. Any chang e in severity of signs and 
Visterra Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL

AE. One of the categories described in Table [ADDRESS_988953]/and 
or Vaccine 
Related A clinical event, including lab oratory test abnormality, occurs  in a plausible time 
relationship to treatment administration, and which concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals cannot explain. The response to withdrawal of the tre atment (de-challenge*) 
should be clinically plausible. The event must be definitive ph armacologically or 
phenomenologically, using a satisfactory re-challenge† procedur e if necessary. 
Probably related A clinical event, including lab oratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of the treatment, unlikely to be attributed to c oncurrent disease or other drugs 
or chemicals, and which follows  a clinically reasonable respons e on withdrawal 
(de-challenge). Re-challenge information is not required to ful fil this definition. 
Possibly related A clinical event, including lab oratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of the treatment, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_63400]. Information on treatment withdrawal m ay be lacking or unclear. 
Unlikely to be related A clinical event, including lab oratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to 
treatment administration which makes a causal relationship impr obable, and in which other 
drugs, chemicals or underlying di sease provide pl ausible explan ations. 
Unrelated A clinical event, including lab oratory test abnormality, with l ittle or no temporal relationship 
with treatment administration. May have negative de-challenge and re-challenge information. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_724272] d by [CONTACT_211417] (e.g., c oncomitant disease, 
environmental factors or other drugs or chemicals). 
*De-challenge is when a drug suspected of causing an AE is disco ntinued. If the symptoms of the AE disappear 
partially or completely, within a reasonable time from drug dis continuation, this is termed a positive 
de-challenge. If the symptoms continue despi[INVESTIGATOR_724273] e drug, this is termed a negative de-challenge. 
Note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear up on discontinuation of the drug, yet drug-
relatedness clearly exists (for example, as in bone marrow supp ression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive 
dyskinesia). 
†Re-challenge is when a drug suspected of causing an AE in a sp ecific subject in the past is re-administered to that 
subject. If the AE recurs upon exposure, this is termed a posit ive re-challenge. If the AE does not recur, this is 
termed a negative re-challenge.

 Blood sample collection, processi ng and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_724283] b e outlined in a separate laboratory 
manual. In brief, PK sampling will occur on Day 1 starting with a collection prior to the start of 
infusion, at the end of infusion (60 minutes) and at [ADDRESS_988961] of VIS649 on PD parameters, serum samp les will be drawn and 
evaluated for immunoglobulin levels (total IgA, IgG and IgM), i mmunoglobulin subtypes (IgA 
and IgG), and lymphocytes.  
 
 Sample s for PD parameters will be 
collected at the time points det ailed in the Schedule of Assess ments (see Table 10 ). Further 
procedures for sample collecti on, shipment, processing, and sto rage will be described in the 
Laboratory Manual. 6.5. Total Amount of Blood 
The approximate volume of blood (440.5 mL) planned for collecti on from each subject over the 
course of the entire study (from the Screening Visit to the End -of-study Visit, but not including 
repeat or additional tests ordered by [CONTACT_19579] r) presents no undue risk to the 
subjects. 
For all subjects enrolled, the approximate blood volumes to be collected during the study are 
outlined in Table [ADDRESS_988962] 
7.1. Schedule of Assessments 
The study will be comprised of: 
 A Screening Visit up to 28 days before dosing 
 An in-house stay for approximately 2 to 3 days, with admission to the study center on 
Day -1, dosing on Day 1 and discharge in the morning of Day 2 
 A post-administration period of 16 weeks 
 Outpatient visits, on Day 3 (+1 day), 7 (± 1 day), 14, 21, 28, 31 (± 1 day) (cohort 5 only), 
35, 42, 49 (cohorts 1-4 only), 56, 70, 84 and 98 (for all visit s not otherwise specified, ± 3 
days) 
 A final Follow-up visit on Day 112 (± 3 days); however, two add itional follow-up visits 
may be performed, at Weeks [ADDRESS_988963] not 
returned to > lower limits of normal by [CONTACT_56421] 16 (Day 112) v isit or if emerging trial 
data suggest a value of later f ollow-up (i.e. detection of ADA responses). 
The total duration of the clini cal study per subject will be up  to approximately 20 weeks 
(5 months), including the Screen ing period with the possibility  of duration exte nding to 28 weeks 
(7 months) if follow-ups visits are required. For a detailed Schedule of Assessments, see: Table

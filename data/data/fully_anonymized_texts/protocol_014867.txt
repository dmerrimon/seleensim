5 1 BACKGROUND/SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
     The Research Problem – Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495876] (ED) visits among patients 
with diabetes mellitus  (DM) are key contributors to rising U.S. DM -related health care costs.1
  DM self -
management education (DSME) has been shown to reduce utilization of acute care servi ces. 
Traditionally considered a suboptimal environment in which to provide education, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495877] a unique opportunity to educate patients with DM.  Recent studies suggest that 
inpatient DSME, improving communication of discharge instructions and involving patients in medication  (Rx) reconciliation may reduce risk for early readmissions
2, and improves outcomes .3,4,5 
The American Diabetes Association ( ADA)6 and The Joint Commission7 delineate educational content 
to communicate to all DM patients before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
Inpatient delivery of DSME per national guidelines presents a challenge to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] .6,8,9 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based DM specialists - endocrinol ogists and DM educators - cannot reach all patients who 
need DSME.  Methodology for delivery of learner -centered DSME to inpatients with DM at the 
bedside within existing workflow on nursing units is needed.  This study will deploy pre-
implementation assessment methods and designs coupled with established implementation effectiveness (IE)  evaluation frameworks to integrate delivery of DSME  sustainably into ongoing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495878]. Evidence 
generat ed by [CONTACT_495947] a future application for NIH R18 funding.  
 
     Importance of the Problem –  Studies of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495879] < 30 days in 14%, < 180 in 32%,4 and that 17% w ere readmitted to the 
ED in < 30 days.10 Readmissions  can be partially attributed to deficits in DM knowledge and self -
management skills, including poor adherence to DM medications (Rxs) . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495880].6,8.9 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based 
DM specialists – endocrinologists and DM educators - cannot reach all patients who need DSME. 
Survival skills education,  teaching topi[INVESTIGATOR_495881], is recommended for 
inpat ient DSME4. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_495882], patient factors including Rxs non- adherence remain a 
critical barrier to improved outcomes  even when education is provided. This suggests that a more 
holistic approach is required including personalized feedback to effecti vely integrate the patient into 
the chronic care continuum .11 Innovative providers are responding by [CONTACT_495948]. Evidence -based sustainable tactics for 
offering learner -centered, knowledge- based DM education in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495883].   
 
     Literature important to the study  – The data summarized in the following section directly 
support the need for interventions such as  Diabetes To Go.  
    The need for DM  education. DSME, part of the chronic care and health promotion models, 
improves knowledge, self -care behaviors including Rx adherence,
[ADDRESS_637512] a lower 
frequency of 30 -day readmi ts than those who do not (11 vs 16%; p=0.0001).7 DSME is usually 
delivered outpatient 1:[ADDRESS_637513] dramatically low knowledge.2

   The need for strategies to support improvement in Rx adherence. Patients  are primarily 
responsible for safely and appropriately self -administering Rx regimens. 6 In a study of  patients 
surveyed at discharge, only 28% were able to list all their Rxs, with only 37%  being able to recount 
their purposes, and just 14% able to state their  common side effects .[ADDRESS_637514] : have a functional knowledge o f Rxs 
and their proper dosaging;  consolida te the regimen to an efficient daily schedule;  problem -solve 
around regimen use as changes occur (e.g., sick days);  and continue the behaviors over time. 
Studies have shown that patients have problems performing these tasks. This need is particularly 
impor tant for those with DM, a complex chronic condition requiring long -term understanding of the 
timing, purpose, and side effects of multiple Rxs .15-[ADDRESS_637515] risk s 
identified in this analysis , two are directly relevant to the present proposal: 1) variability in patient 
comprehension of DSME and DM Rxs (including use, effects and reconciliation);  and 2) Rx discharge 
recommendation variability between providers9.  
 
   The need for methodology for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495884].  Few, if any, clinical trials in the DM field 
have uti lized robust pre- implementation assessment methods and designs coupled with established 
implementation effectiveness (IE)  evaluation frameworks to help inform and assess implementation 
practices. This project will help overcome these deficiencies by 1) applying the principles of implementation science (IS) and human factors (HF) engineering
9,20-25 and 2) utilizing mixed methods 
to design the intervention, workflow processes and plan the intervention to be sustainable within existing care delivery models. In formation technology  (IT) tools are increasingly  being  leveraged as a 
method to deliver content at the bedside and provide support for care transitions from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21104].
26 An IT platform for delivery of messaging content  is used in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495885] s study.   
 
Prior experience and/or history relevant to the research -   
 
   This proposal seeks to build on our transdisciplinary  investigators’  prior work and examine 
ways to optimize D SME, skills training and discharge transition support integration within 
nursing unit workflow.  This planning grant, will  address concerns  of the  NIDDK Special Emphasis 
Panel on Pragmatic Research and Natural Experiments Reviewers  provided in response to a PAR 
13-366 R18 proposal submitted by [CONTACT_27156] (eRA Commons IR18D K108109- 01; Grant11851018; 
reviewed 05- 06-2015). Here, we will examine the feasibility of integrating a diabetes survival skills 
self-management education program  ( Diabetes To Go ) within nursing unit workflow, assess 
potential ‘burden’ on staff, align nur sing and patient time for intervention delivery, and assess nursing 
unit staff, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495886].  
 
The study team , led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Michelle Magee, PI, reported pi[INVESTIGATOR_495887] a learner -centered survival skills DSME program was o ffered to 125 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495888] 2 DM (mean age 58+ 13 yrs; 66% female; 89% Black). While 70% had had  prior DM 
education, only about half reported education within [ADDRESS_637516]

7 61% answering > 5 questions correctly at baseline and 89% at post -test ( P<0.0001). Odds of being 
recognized as highly adherent (Modified Morisky Rx Adherence 4- item Score©) were 1.28 times 
higher at 2 wks (p<0.0001) and 1.[ADDRESS_637517]-discharge (p=0.0002) compared to 
baseline. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495889], although not powered sufficiently for statistical testing, 
showed encouraging results , with a decrease from 14% to 5% ( P=0.0588).[ADDRESS_637518] also generat ed support for such an approach and 
which was used to inform  Diabetes To Go education content. The Synergy To Enable Control 
Program for Adults with type 2 DM study  generated evidence that ED visits made by [CONTACT_495949] a 4- wk intervention with titration of DM Rxs and 
survival skills DSME . Among 101 participants  (96% Black; 54% female; and 62.3% 
Medicaid/Medicare insurance) learner -centered survival skills DSME initiated in the ED  significant ly 
increased  knowledge and few  patients required meter and insulin shot instruction at follow -up, 
indicating skills retention. Modified Morisky  Rx adherence score© improved from low to medium  
(p<0.001),  a clinically meaningful improvement.27.28 The ABCs of Diabetes placed a  DSME progra m 
in a public library. Two small -group interactive DSME classes improved  DM knowledge. Significant 
clinical outcomes included reduction in self -reported ED visits and in mean A1C.5 These data support 
the contention that concise, focused DSME, as will be pr ovided in this study, can improve DM 
outcomes among high- risk adults with type 2 DM.   
 
MWHC  has an established DM resource nurse champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (DRNC) program . Nurses interested in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_495890] [ADDRESS_637519] was in- /exclusion-  criteria: Will Spanish speaking , 
low literacy patients , Psychiatry inpatients and/or ED patients be included? The second area was 
program design: It was suggested that the technology platform generate a report of survey results for each patient so the staff nurse can see in which areas education should be focused; Concern was expressed that iPads would be taken if not t ethered and that attaching the iPad to a rolling pole would 
prevent theft; It was noted that it will be important to determine which patients are also  seen by [CONTACT_86677][INVESTIGATOR_495891] a confounding variable of study outcomes.  These 
observations/f indings were considered in the present study design. This DRNC group will participate 
in the Advisory group for the R34 study.

[ADDRESS_637522] ainable solutions for DSME and for DM -related discharge support. This 
personalized approach leverages e- health technologies to pursue the following Specific Aims:  
  Aim 1: To refine and optimize the Diabetes To Go program  content and implementation 
processes.  
  
This will be achieved by [CONTACT_495950] -centered interface design principles, content development in 
partnership with patients and providers, detailed process mappi[INVESTIGATOR_495893], and integrating  mobile and e- health technology to support care 
transitions. The Practical, Robust, Implementation and Sustainability Model will guide implementation planning and evaluation.      
   Hypothesis 1.   Diabetes To Go : will be optimized for patient and provider  usability and integration 
into nursing  unit workflow; will enhance patient self -care knowledge and skills; and will support the 
discharge transition process.   
 
Aim 2 :  To conduct iterative  rapid- cycle  usability testing of the enhanced  Diabetes To Go 
progr am content and processes  and establish a Diabetes To Go program toolkit for 
widespread implementation.  
   This will be achieved by a series of intervention- evaluation cycles of field testing, refinement, retesting 
of the Diabetes To Go program and evaluati on through: direct observation; patient, provider and 
system leadership stakeholder interviews and focus groups; and evaluation of changes in early patient outcomes.  
    
   Hypothesis 2.   The Diabetes To Go program will be perceived favorably by [CONTACT_495951] a 
high-quality toolkit for implementation and delivery of the program for further evaluation and testing.

Preliminary data gathered during this study will be used to design an R18 pragmatic trial in response 
to PAR 15 -157 which will examine outcomes of implementation of the Diabetes To Go program when 
delivered on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495894] s and health 
system s. The model has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in sustainable and generalizable 
approaches for delivery of patient -centered education and medication adherence and discharge 
transition support in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
 
3 EXPECTED RISKS/BENEF ITS 
If successful, Diabetes to Go has the potential to benefit patients and the health care delivery 
systems within which they receive care by [CONTACT_495952] a paradigm shift in sustainable and generalizable 
approaches for  delivery of  patient -centered education and discharge tr ansition support . We expect 
that enhanced delivery of education, targeted to the patient’s individual learning needs, will lead to 
enhanced understanding of the need for and adherence to medications to control their diabetes and other comorbid conditions.  Preliminary data gathered during this study will be used to desig n an R18 
pragmatic trial in response to PAR 15- [ADDRESS_637523] of the Diabetes To Go Inpatient intervention will be determined in future studies.  
 We believe that t his study will expose nursing unit staff and patients to “Minimal risk ”.  The probability 
and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in this  research are not greater in and of themselves 
than those ordinarily encountered in daily  nursing unit  life or during the performance of routine 
physical or psychological examinations or tests.  No blood is being drawn.  All staff and patient level data, including  focus group, 1:1 interview and satisfaction data, as well as technology usage and 
usability d ata will be de -identified.  For staff and patient interviews, we will be seeking a waiver of 
documentation of informed consent as the only document linking the individual to the study outcomes would be the consent document itself. All data will be coded and de-identified. Data will also be 
presented only in aggregate form, further limiting the risks of loss of confidentiality and breach of privacy .  
   
4.  ELIGIBILITY  
Study population & sources - 
The participants will vary based upon the phase of the study .  
 
Phase 1. Workflow Assessment and Processes Intervention Design  
• A purposive sample of 10 -14 nurses and patient care technicians (PCTs)  on 4 non-critical care 
adult medicine nursing units, including 1 psychiatry unit  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
11 • A group of 4 patient end- users  will be engaged in usability testing. In addition to the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria outlined below under Phase 2 that represent the target audience for the Diabetes To 
Go platform, the following additional criteria for inclusion will also be used:  
o Speak, read, write English 
o Inpatient admission to  a MedStar hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495895] 12- 18 months  
o Experience with the Diabetes To Go program and/or DSME  
 
Phase 2.   Pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393].   
• All unit staff will participate in the education delivery program  which will be introduced as a unit 
Quality Improvement initiative.   
• Staff may opt- out of participation in the interview activities without consequences.  
• ALL patients on the [ADDRESS_637524] a diagnosis of  DM will be offered the program  to 
minimize workflow disruption and enhance operational sustainability .  
 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria  – These criteria have intentionally been kept broad to minimize 
disruption to unit workflow and to increase generalizability  of findings.  Where appropriate, the 
justification for each criteria is also presented, eg exclusion of minors.  
    Inclusion Criteria --Age > 18 yrs (lower limit of age for admission to MWHC adult units ; all of the 
Diabetes To Go content is designed for adult learners ); English speaking  (Diabetes To Go content is 
currently only available in English) ; a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (ICD9 250.xx/ICD -10-CM E08 -
E11)  documented in the EMR ; admitted to one of the inpatient units (non- critical care adult medicine 
nursing units, including 1 psychiatry unit)  where the study is being conducted ; willing and able to 
participate in the program.   
    Exclusion criteria : Age < 18 years (MWHC does not admit minors to its Medicine units and 
Diabetes To Go content has been prepared for adult learners); Pregnancy or anticipated conception within 3 mos  (Diabetes To Go content does not address gestational diabetes or diabetes in 
pregnancy where management and glycemic targets differ considerably from those for non- pregnant 
adults ) ; admission to an intensive- care unit, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state  
– conditions in which the acuity level would likely preclude participation in DSME;  patient declines 
participation in the education program for any reason; and any medical condition or cognitiv e 
dysfunction that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_495896], would preclude participation in the education program.  
[ADDRESS_637525] permission to present the Phase 1 
study objectives to the frontline nurses during standing team meetings and/or during team huddles on 
the unit. A recruitment flyer with information about the study and about how to participate in the platform usability testing will be made available to each nurse and nurse manager. Indivi duals who 
agree to participate as key informants will go through the informed consent process at the time of the usability testing and be given an information sheet for their records. A waiver of documentation of informed consent will be applied for as it will be the only document linking the staff member to the project outcomes.

[ADDRESS_637526]. Smith will work with the nursing leaders to identify optimal dates/times to 
observe current rounding practices for diabetes education in order to map process es for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_49152]. Individuals (nurses, patient care technicians, and diabet es educators) will be shadowed 
by [CONTACT_495953]/human factors specialists. Identification of the individual shadowed 
will be withheld from documentati on and the output of the process mappi[INVESTIGATOR_495897].  
 Phase 2.   Pi[INVESTIGATOR_473794]  
 A Diabetes To Go Inpatient Program informed consent will be provided to each patient admitted to the participating  units who has a DM diagnosis .   
 The study team will inform the DRNC (or alternate designated staff member)  via an ongoing 
electronic  screening  list of unit patients who have D M.  All DM patients admitted to the unit will be 
considered for  program  participation  by [CONTACT_495954] f.  Staff will assess ability to participate in the program 
(see Patient Screening Checklist)  and if appropriate will offer each patient  the program.  At the time 
the program is offered to each patient, nursing unit staff will answer any questions that the patient may have about Diabetes To Go. Patients who agree to participate will then be asked to provide 
informed consent and when they have done so, w ill be enrolled in the program.  
 Reasons for exclusion from the offering  (screen failures)  will be recorded in the study database by [CONTACT_495955] . Patients who decline participation in the program will be 
also be considered as screen failures.  The reason(s) for declining participation will be captured.

   Participatory action research is an iterative process that seeks to understand and improve the problem and reduce deficiencies through involving the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (stakeholders) of the intervention in the process of development who, in turn, take actions to improve the system . Figure 3 depi[INVESTIGATOR_495903] a collection, information synthesis 
and analysis, feedback and refining of assumptions, synthesis and prioritization, and output validation, prioritization and group consensus. The pr ocess 
continues until researchers and stakeholders comes to consensus.  This is a rapid process, quickly 
moving from base knowledge to group consensus.  It can also be used iteratively. Field observations 
will be recorded and time- stamped to document and code each staff task performed and time spent 
on the task in the patient room. Data on key characteristics of each task will be collected, such as whether the task is an interaction with the patient that is cognitive or physical or both, is required or optional, and whether the task is interrupted.  Descriptive statistics w ill be calculated to determine the 
total staff time spent in the room, and the nature and duration of the tasks performed there . Initial key 
informant interviews  will be conducted 1:1 with patients, with physician providers (inpatient and 
primary care providers ) and with nursing  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495904]. Initial PRISM elements will be 
assessed .[CONTACT_84135] and her team have experience in applying these methods in support of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495905].  
   User -Centered Development and Usability Testing of the T ablet -Based Learning Platform . 
The MedStar Institute for Innovation (MI2) team, under the direction of Dave Brennan, MBE, will plan and carry out the user -centered design of two additional Diabetes To Go modules.  How to Talk to 
Your Doctor ( adapted from t he AHRQ, NIH Office of Research in Minority Health endorsed Baylor 
College of Medicine “How to Talk to Your Doctor” (and get your doctor to talk to you!) program

home printed handouts patients can use during  post-discharge PCP visits to generate discussions 
around DM targets and the importance of appropriate medication choices. The DM -related skills 
management module  will guide patients through insulin (vial and syringe or pen) and GLP -[ADDRESS_637529] of a mix of content format an d type (images, videos,

discharge support process for pati ent and provider use and its’ uptake/adoption assessed.  
     A user -centered design approach will be employed during development of both the new modules 
as well as revisions to the entire tablet -based learning platform, which will be built using MedStar

Implementation Design/Planning  
 
Implementation design and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_495906];  Analysis of observational and key informant interview data, 
and resource nurse focus group data  will provide insight into implementation barriers  and 
strategies to overcome them  to assure integration of the intervention with minimal workflow 
impact.  PRISM  will enhance the translation of research into practice52 by [CONTACT_495959] 1 
implementation planning and Phase 2 evaluation in support of Specific Aim 1  – Optimization of 
intervention design. The PRISM elements addressed during planning and throughout the trial are 
shown on Table 2.  
   Phase I activities aim to identify barriers and facilitators of intervention success across 
organizational, patient, and environmental (internal and external) stakeholders. Representatives from each group will be interviewed (semi -structured interviews/focus group). Data on barriers and 
facilitators will be validated with the  
stakeholder s using a participatory action methods approach. Phase 2 approaches are detailed i n the 
Implementation Effectiveness Evaluation section below.  
  Early identification and evaluation of barriers  and facilitators of implementation will allow for creative 
solutions to be embedded into the study protocol prior to clinical implementation, thu s, creating an 
innovative, sustainable program for patients and clinical stakeholders.

General Methods.  
  Baseline Assessment: All participants on intervention units  will undergo baseline assessment as 
shown in Table 4.  After unit staff have provided the patient with program information about the 
program, the study team will obtain baseline data as shown on Table 4. Because this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], by 
[CONTACT_8345], is not assessing lab clinical outcomes the study will not be conducting any study -provided 
laboratory tests.  
  Patient outcomes surveys.  The KNOW Diabetes knowledge survey  and the Modified Morisky53 Rx 
Adherence Survey 8- item (MMAS -8© with permission from D. Morisky ) are delivered via the Tonic 
platform. Delivery oversight will be provided by [CONTACT_495969].  The KNOW Diabetes survey was 
developed by [CONTACT_495970] -DM and Diabetes To Go programs. Each knowle dge 
question is linked to video content so that education address es knowledge deficits directly via the 
platform  when an incorrect response is entered.  
  Evaluation of Implementation Costs . Pre liminary costs for program implementation will be 
collected by [CONTACT_495971] /time  accrued in program delivery 
and costs for technology , for licenses  and for printed nurse and patient education tools.  
  Staff training.  The DRNC will train  staff via cha nge of shift in -services. Each staff member will also 
take the knowledge pre- test, view the program education content and take the post -test. A web -based 
training module will be available so that staff may also complete the training  online. A pocket version 
(print & tablet/smartphone app) of the education content will be provided. A CDE  member of the study 
team will serve as the unit program liaison/champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394].  Unit in -services will address 1)  Evidence-
including research, clinical & patient experience, local data/information; 2)  Context -setting in which 
proposed change will be implemented; culture -how things are done at the site, values, beliefs, 
assumptions; leadership; evaluation,  effectiveness  3) Facilitation - including purpose, role and 
description of skills and attributes.

   The study team will inform the DRNC (or alternate designated staff member)  via an ongoing 
electronic list of unit patients who have DM.  S taff will  assess ability to participate and if appropriate 
will offer them the program. T raining in use of the technology until the patient feels comfortable with it  
will be provided. It is likely  that most patients will use the tablet to complete surveys  and access 
education content. The option to take the surveys on paper and to read the education cont ent in the 
Diabetes To Go book will be available should a patient prefer  the p rint modality. Using the methods 
agreed upon during the design phase, staff will encourage patients to progress through the program  
and provide an opportunity to ask questions when in the room.   
   Individualized education assignments  are driven by [CONTACT_7416]- test knowledge assessment s. The 
patient takes the knowledge and MMAS -8 pre-tests via the Tonic platform . After the patient responds 
to each question, the program lets him/her know if the response was correct or not and gives the correct response as a first  teaching point.  At pre-test completion, the platform auto- directs the patient 
to each module corresponding to the areas in which a knowledge deficit existed . The unit staff 
member will be provided with a report card detailing the survey questions where deficits were identified so they can focus on these areas for subsequent education with the patient. Mandatory modules include those on each DM Rx  which will be  prescribed at discharge (including insulin or 
GLP-[ADDRESS_637534] ion technique),  when to call the doctor  or go to the ED , and Talk To Your Doctor . 
DSME includes 7 core areas ; 5 of these will be tailored for each  patient based o n knowledge deficits 
identified by [CONTACT_495972] : 1) know your DM  numbers (sugar and A1C ), 2) know when 
your blood sugar is low , 3) know when your blood sugar is high,  4) basic diet education,  5) self -
monitoring of BG. Rx adherence issues identified on the MMAS -8 will also be addressed. DSME will 
be delivered via brief video clips (3- 5 minutes in length) via the tablet . When assigned content has 
been completed, the patient will take the post -test surveys . Each patient will be given a Diabetes To 
Go book with the same content  delivered on the videos to use as a reference following discharge.     
   Discharge DM Rxs management  and Arrangement for follow -up ‘virtual’ visits . Prior to 
discharge, unit staff will review the DM Rxs prescribed with the patient and flag the matching content 
in the Diabetes To Go book. Access to the Rxs will  be assessed  via the tablet /internet ( http://drg -
fingertipformulary. com/ ) and/or the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495919]. If Rx access is an issue,  staff 
will consult the provider writing the discharge Rxs to reconcile.  When possible, a 30d supply of any

to call/text/videochat.  We anticipate aligning these processes with current unit discharge medication 
management processes in order to minimize disruption to workflow.  
    Rapid cycle redesign and redeploymen t.  During the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], 2 -3 implement -observation- revision cycles for the 
program and process will be conducted (Figure 5 ). The  
approach to observations and refinement are detailed in section 1a- c. Each iteration will take approximatel y 2-[ADDRESS_637536] pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. Stakeholders will be interviewed for user experience feedback. Process will be directly observed for >
 3 day s on each unit/iteration to collect implementation process information 
and feedback. Recruitment and retention approaches  are detailed in table [ADDRESS_637537] a specialized expertise in DM that will support nursing ladder 
advancement. Light food and beverages will be offered during staff advisory group meetings, duri ng in-
services and during training to help minimize time spent off the units/ non- productive time.  
Patients  A stipend in the form of gift cards will be offered to each patient completing  the program after the  the 30 
day follow -up visit to promote retention as described in the budget justification section. Follow -up virtual 
visits will be arranged at the patient’s convenience, including early AM, late PM and weekends to minimize 
disruption to usual daily activi ties, including work schedules.  
 
 
   Strategies for sustainability  outside the study setting.  Unit nurses previously provided input into 
the existing program education content and delivery format.  The intervention will be further developed 
by a multi -disciplinary team with strong representation from  nursing unit staff and l eadership, 
research and education stakeholders . It will be delivered by [CONTACT_495974]. Our intent is to show  that 
the program model could be implemented on  non-critical care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495920]. The 
MedStar Institute for Quality and Safety has  strong  experience in quality, efficiency, reliability, and 
safety improvement, including  workflow process implementation (see Investigators and Facilities 
sections),  and will conduct  this study’s  workflow process analysis to assure efficient, effective  
program implementation. MedStar implementation scientists will employ the PRISM framework to 
optimize likelihood of implementation success and enhance generalizability. T he resulting program 
could potentially  be incorporated into the education delivery paradigm for all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] . Developi[INVESTIGATOR_495921], and then using existing personnel and current scope s of practice  for education delivery will  be eff icient in terms of resources utilization  and broad 
applicability . Additionally, offering DRNCs the opportunity to develop expertise in diabetes is aligned 
with professional development and supervisor and peer recognition of the expertise gained.  
    Potent ial for generalizability . Our study’s inpatient medical  and surgical  environment reflect s the general 
U.S. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63840], in that  up to 30% of inpatients have DM and standardized strategies and tools to 
educate patients are lacking. If successful in a subsequent RCT, the D iabetes To Go learner -centered, 
technology assisted model could potentially be applied in other clinical settings  (e.g., the Medical Home  and/or Figure 5 
 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
21 on other inpatient services ) to bring DM  subspeci alty education directly to high volumes of patients who often 
do not access formal outpatient DM  education programs. This model could also be applied to other chronic 
complex medical conditions  in in- and outpatient settings to deliver education and thus i mprove outcomes.  
 
 
    Implementation Cost Analysis.  Professional labor and other personnel time will be determined 
using time -motion analysis supplemented by [CONTACT_48368]/staff interview. Unit labor costs will be 
determined from hourly wage or annual  salary  data as determined by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Department of Labor. 
Capi[INVESTIGATOR_495922] (hardware, software) and education tools (printed books and pocket 
guides) will also be determined.  
 
F.  Environment . The MWHC hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495923] . The transdisciplinary clinical 
and scientific environment detailed in the Investigators and Facilities sections  will contribute to 
successfu l conduct of the study. Institutional support from Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495924], MHRI, and MedStar 
Health’s Chief Medical Officer ( see letters of support ) will assure successful implementation and 
sustainability of the proposed delivery model.  
 G.  Limitations/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_495925]. Most notably, as described by [CONTACT_495975] R18 proposal is that it may not be possible to fit the proposed intervention into unit workflow. Every effort is being made in our study design to avoid this pi[INVESTIGATOR_292723]; however, the following situations may arise which could impact outcomes:   
   Nursing unit staff have many competing demands on their time. The intervention will not work if the staff do not support it. Incorporating HF/IE principles and early nursing leadership and staff engagement in the process design will provide an opportunity to avoid this challenge via  thorough 
baseline assessment and ongoing IE.  In the event that the intervention does not succeed, a fallback 
plan will be examination of the potential for deployment of staff dedicated to patient education program delivery that is deployed across units.  
   Many factors contribute to poorly controlled DM and to readmissions. We will examine a few key variables —DSME  and skills education, their delivery at the bedside and strategies to enhance 
medication management during the discharge process.  Our intention is to address these high risk  
factors in our study in a focused concise way in order to assure delivery of key DSME and skills content and to support Rxs management and to engage the patient in healthy self -care behaviors 
which will promote outcomes improvement. We will identify additional  variables affect ing outcomes 
and address them as appropriate in this or future interventions.  
   Our post-discharge assessment period is 30 days, due to the short (2 yr) duration of this study . This 
time period will allow us to generate sufficient preliminary data for assessment we propose for this intervention. It will not however, permit determination of intermediate or l ong-term outcomes. These 
would be the focus of a future RCT if our prelim inary data shows promise.   Evaluation to determine 
long-term impact is beyond the scope of the present study and could be addressed in a future study.   
 Additional Information.  
 The Behavioral Intervention  
 
“Diabetes To Go”  is a learner -centered behavioral self -mangement education and medication 
adherence intervention that has been developed by a multidisciplinary team led by [CONTACT_495976] 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
22 proposal’s PI (Magee). It has also been pi[INVESTIGATOR_169354]. The Diabetes To Go intervention and findings of 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_495926] “ Prior experience and/or history relevant to the 
research ”.  
 
During Phase 1  of this study, we will r efine and optimize /adapt  the Diabetes To Go program  
content and implementation processes to enhance the likelihood of optimal uptake and impact of 
the behavioral intervention.   This will be achieved by [CONTACT_495950] -centered interface design 
principles with our human factors part ners, development of additional content in partnership with 
patients, providers and MDI and MI2 content development experts, detailed process mappi[INVESTIGATOR_495927], and integrating mobile and e- health 
technology to support care transitions. The Practical, Robust, Implementation and Sustainability Model, deployed by [CONTACT_495977]. Audio recordings  obtained during focus groups will be immediat ely transcribed following 
the interview. Transcripts will be reviewed and validated for accuracy. Once accuracy of the transcripts has been validated, the original audio recordings will be destroyed.    
 
The Diabetes To Go program  (surveys and video content ) will then be deployed in Phase 2  of the 
present study as an integrated teaching tool at the bedside to enable assessment of the effectiveness  
and short -term sustainability  of the workflow processes developed in Phase 1 of the study.  We will 
be gather ing pi[INVESTIGATOR_495928], Rx adherence, healthcare resources utilization, platform adoption, and satisfaction with the program .  
 Fidelity and competence  of the behavioral intervention will be maintained and demonstrated 
throughout  the study  as described below.  
 Fidelity  of the intervention process will be assured by [CONTACT_495978]. Nursing Unit staff will encourage each patient to complete the program content during the time that they are on the unit prior to discharge. Reasons for failure to complete the full program will be capt ured from the patient and the unit staff ’s perspective in 
the program platform prior to or at the time of discharge from the unit .  The study coordinator will 
conduct audits to assess the degree of compliance with the program. Data for survey completion, 
survey results and video content usage will be auto- extracted from the Tonic for Health platform for 
provision to the data management team and will also be used in the assessment of fidelity.  
 Competence or compliance with fidelity  will be demonstrated  via analysis of the number of content 
areas accessed by [CONTACT_6904] , time spent viewing video content which corresponds to knowledge 
deficits on the surveys and time spent viewing mandatory video content.  
 Focus Group Specifications.  
 
  [CONTACT_84135] and her team  have extensive experience in conducting interviews and focus groups for the 
purpose of developi[INVESTIGATOR_495929]-

technological platform, content of the Diabetes To Go program, and identification of any perceived 
challenges or barriers to implementation.  
  Focus groups will be limited to English speaking patients and participants. For patient focus groups, we will work to ensure that all patient focus group gui des are written in plain language at no higher 
than a 6
th grade level.   
  Information will be captured during the interviews/focus groups in two ways. First, the members of the focus groups will be asked to provide verbal consent to be audio recorded for the purpose of the project. Second, in addition to the Focus Group Facilitator, a note take for  the project will be in attendance to take notes and assist the facilitator with ensuring attention to all the key components of the interview. Information from  the focus groups will be reviewed, synthesized, and aggregated using 
standard approaches for thematic review using grounded theory. Transcripts of the focus groups will be reviewed independently by [CONTACT_495979]. Adjudication of diff erences will 
be presented to a third investigator for validation and resolution. Once the common themes have been identified, this information will be presented back to the participants for validation and revision. Once validated, a final report on the out comes of the focus groups will be generated and the 
information gained from the participants will be used to revise the Diabetes To Go platform, educational content, and expected processes as appropriate.  Digital audio recordings of the focus 
groups will b e destroyed upon completion of validation of the written transcripts.  
  Permission to audio record participants will be included in the informed consent process and assented to verbally. Recording of the verbal assent will be conducted after initial agreement to be 
recorded. Information of the need to audio record the focus groups will also be a part of all recruitment materials so that any volunteer is aware of the need to record responses prior to their attendance at the focus group.  
 
Methodology Specific to S tudy S urvey s  
 
Phase 1.  
 
All information  for Phase 1 will be collected using semi -structured interviews and/or focus groups. 
Approaches to these activities  are presented above.  
 
Phase 2.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_495931]  – all surveys (baseline data, knowledge survey and medication adherence, 
satisfaction) will be self -administered via the Tonic for Health platform.  Patients will be provided 
instruction in use of the platform until they feel comfortable using it and in an ongoing fashion if needed during the participation period.  Patients who prefer not to use the technology platform will be provided with print copi[INVESTIGATOR_495932], eg the patient cannot read, then the surveys will be administered by [CONTACT_3476] (baseline data and satisfaction) and the nursing unit staff (knowledge and medication adherence).  Staff will be trained in methods for administration of surveys 
so that bias in patient responses will not be introduced as a variable.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
[ADDRESS_637539] that there is no existing vali dated diabetes knowledge survey which 
specifically addresses diabetes “survival skills” self -manag ement education content areas. This 
survey is used as the pre-  post-knowledge survey in this study.  Importantly, responses to the survey 
determine which video content area patients will be directed to for viewing.  When a patient answers a question incorrectly, the platform provides a link to the video content which provides information on the topic for which a knowledge deficit was identified; thus, the content is tailored to the patient’s learning needs. In an ongoing study, t he MDI is currently in the process of vali dating the KNOW 
Diabetes survey.   
 
  The second survey  is the Modified Morisky Medication Adherence Survey, 8- item. This is a 
validated survey which is used with permission from David Morisky.  
 
  In addition to these surveys, a baseline survey will be administered to each patient participating in 
the program to gather data which will be used to augment data extracted from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36843]  (See 
Baseline patient data survey) .  A patient satisfaction survey will also be administered at the time the 
patient completes the education program . This survey will address patient perceptions of the inpatient 
education experience and with the technolog y platform. These surveys will be developed during 
Phase 1 and submitted to the IRB for approval prior to use in Phase 2.   
 Other  Consideration Relative to Study Specifications:  
 
• Specimen Collection – No biological specimens will be collected in this stu dy. 
•    Studies involving use of product (licensed, labeled of small size, simple)  – No product  
will be used in this study.  
 
7 DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE S 
The source document  will contain the original signed informed consent document, completed 
baseline data collection forms, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_495933] a locked cabinet on the MDI study team unit.  
 
Consented, participants will undergo baseline asses sment as shown in  Table 4.  The study team  will 
obtain all study -specified baseline data from the patient and/or from the EMR, with the exception of 
the knowledge and medication adherence survey responses.  
 
The education program -specific KNOW Diabetes knowl edge survey  and the Modified Morisky53 Rx 
Adherence Survey 8- item (MMAS -8© with  permission from D. Morisky ) are delivered by [CONTACT_495980]. As part of the education program, nursing unit staff delivering the 
program to an individual patient will have access to his/her survey responses in order to enable tailoring education at the bedside to identified knowledge deficits and medication adherence issues .  
 
Data entered into the platform by [CONTACT_495981] R EDCap in a file format and de-
identified prior to presentation to the data management and statistics team for analysis .  
 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
[ADDRESS_637540] been s tructured by [CONTACT_495982] -
required security and privacy requirements.    
 
Because this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], by [CONTACT_8345], is not assessing lab clinical outcomes the study will not be conducting any study -provided laboratory tests.  
 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS & DATA ANALYSIS  
Analysis Plan . A convenience sample of 4  nursing units  and approximately 60 patients/unit, for a 
total of 240 patients for whom data will be collected and analyzed,  will be utilized  in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_495934] a future pragmatic trial.  
   Baseline Characteristics: Summary statistics,  including means, medians, standard deviations for 
continuous variables and, frequencies and percentages for categorical variables on all baseline data will be obtained for the overall sample  and by [CONTACT_495983].  The factors that may inf luence patients’ 
non-participation decision will be examined by [CONTACT_495984], race, age or severity of patients’ conditions. Two- sample t -tests, Analysis of Variance 
(ANOVA), chi -square analyses and other nonparametric tests will be conducted as appropriate for the 
proposed bivariate analyses. DM2- related measurements A1C and blood glucose will also be 
described using summary statistics for the baseline and before the patient gets discharged and the differences  will be tested using paired t -tests (or non- parametric tests when needed). The data 
collected at this stage will allow us to better evaluate the effectiveness of the education by [CONTACT_495985]’ DM2 measures at discharge.   
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_495935] : The effect of the intervention on  Knowledge and Skills Acquisition outcomes will 
be examined by [CONTACT_495986]. The differences will be tested using paired t -test for the continuous scores 
and McNemar’s or symmetry test for the categories of specific items of interest  The data collected on 
the number of times the education module replayed until competency demonstrated, the time used, the amount of content skipped (skills acquis ition) will be summarized using descriptive statistics and 
correlated with patients’ characteristics to better understand the difficulties experienced by [CONTACT_13935].  Medication Adherence, a patient -centered behavioral outcome, will be measured at 
baseline and [ADDRESS_637541]  if medication adherence has increased as a result of the 
intervention, the changes in continuous scores at baseline and at 30 days  will be computed and the 
percentage of patients who show “ improvement in Rx adherence
” will be obtained.  ED/Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495936]/activity days within the 30 days after discharge will also be 
summarized using descriptive statistics and their associations with baseline and discharge characteristics will be explored using bivariate analyses. M ultivariate analyses using linear (change in 
continuous scores of KNOW Diabetes and MA8),  logistic (increase in medication adherence) and 
Poisson (count outcomes such as the number of replays, readmissions, days of missed work/activity) regression models  will be conducted by  [CONTACT_495987] 
(age, race, BMI, gender , comorbidities, A1C – when available-  and blood glucose) within the 
constraints of the final sample size of approximately 240 patients ). IT Platform Adoption Metrics - # 
and % of modules viewed; time used; content skipped; content replayed.

VERSION 2; ***. [ADDRESS_315579] that can distinguish safe from trigger foods for 25 
protein- induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPI[INVESTIGATOR_5165]). 26 
27 
Background: FPI[INVESTIGATOR_259596] r epetitive profuse vomiting in response to solid food. 28 
In severe cases, when patients fail to thrive, FPI[INVESTIGATOR_259597] 29 
nutrition (TPN). The major challenge in managing FPI[INVESTIGATOR_259598] (non -trigger) foods in a 30 
timely manner, while avoiding repetitive allergic reactions and recovery periods. This study proposes a 31 
solution to the problem by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_007] a new blood assay that screens a large number of foods (more than 32 
20) in a culture plate. Its purpose is to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_259599]. The outcome will overcome [ADDRESS_315580] failed to thrive or developed food aversions due to association with negative 35 
experiences. 36 37 
FPI[INVESTIGATOR_259600] 2,064 encounters  occurring at the University of 38 
Michigan Health System (UMHS) in the past year (from 11/01/17 until 11/01/18; data obtained using [ADDRESS_315581] for cohort discovery results; FPI[INVESTIGATOR_259601]10 K52.2). The latter number  of encounters  only 40 
comprises  newly diagnosed patients . 41 42 
In this study, FPI[INVESTIGATOR_259602]. From  11/01/17 – 11/01/18, this 43 
cohort comprised 223 newly diagnosed patients at UMHS. T wo sub-groups will be identified as follows : i) 44 
children exhibiting FPI[INVESTIGATOR_259603] 2-3 foods, ii) children exhibiting FPI[INVESTIGATOR_259604] 4 or more foods.  45 
The reason for separating patients into these two groups is due the existence of two separate groups [one 46 
with 2 -3 food triggers, and another with more than 4 food triggers] as  previously  described by [CONTACT_259611] 47 
Allergists who care for FPI[INVESTIGATOR_259605]  (Volertas S., Hudson E., McMorris G., and G. Sanders . Annals of 48 
Allergy, Asthma & Immunology  121:S119 2018) . 49 
50 
The plan is to enroll  up to 20 patients with FPI[INVESTIGATOR_5165]: up to [ADDRESS_315582] at the University of Michigan 52 
Allergy Clinics, and University of Michigan Pediatric outpatient clinics . 53

 Hypotheses:   [ADDRESS_315583] that we developed will distinguish safe from trigger foods for FPI[INVESTIGATOR_259605].  56 
2. The mechanism of FPI[INVESTIGATOR_259606] 57 
will remain after foods are tolerated.  58 
 59 
Specific aims: 60 
1,  Assess the assay’s precision by [CONTACT_259612].  [ADDRESS_315584] after 64 
trigger foods are tolerated to the initial results  65 
 66 
Exploratory aim:  67 
1. Gain further insight into the pathophysiology of FPI[INVESTIGATOR_259607]  68 
 69 
Statistical Design: A random -effects logit model will be used to model the binary outcome (safe or trigger 70 
food) as a function of the [ADDRESS_315585]. A cluster Receiver 72 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis will be used to assess the precision of the assay. Specifically, 73 
we will compute the area under the cluster ROC curve (AUC), along with a 95% confidence interval (CI). 74 
The assay is predictive if the lower limit of the 95% CI is above 0.5, which is the null value indicating no [ADDRESS_315586] safe (non- trigger) foods for the affected children. In our preliminary data  (Case  Study  82 
HUM00155216),  the blood assay safely predicted more than [ADDRESS_315587] Recruitment:  Subjects will be recruited through the University of Michigan Allergy Clinics, and 85 
University of Michigan Pediatric outpatient clinics :  [ADDRESS_315588], EMERSE 88 
and billing codes may be used to identify potential subjects. The patient's primary allergist or 89 
pediatrician will be informed about study team’s contact [CONTACT_259613].  90 
o Patients will then be contact[CONTACT_259614]/or telephone by [CONTACT_259615] [ADDRESS_315589]. 93 
3. Patients may self -refer:  [ADDRESS_315590] information,  will be posted in the 96 
participating clinics. 97

Study Design  116 
 117 
1. Potential participants will be contact[CONTACT_129617] / or telephone after pre- screening of  physician- [ADDRESS_315592]. An option for the patients  to opt out will 120 
be provided.  The patient's primary allergist or pediatrician will be informed about study team’s [ADDRESS_315593] during a clinic 122 
visit. 123 
2. If a parent/guardian expresses interest in the study, they will be sent/given a copy of the informed 124 
consent to review.  125 
3. An appointment will be scheduled with a study team member at the UM allergy clinics.  126 
4. The protocol will be discussed face- to-face with parent/guardian with an opportunity to ask questions 127 
and review the informed consent document.  After written informed consent  is signed by  [CONTACT_31806] 128 
parent/guardian, study procedures can begin.  Parent/guardian will be given a copy of the signed 129 
informed consent and it will be imaged into the chart.  130 
5. Parent/Guardian will be asked to fill out Questionnaire One at the time of entry into the study.  131 
6. Parent/Guardian will be instructed regarding scheduling the blood draw for analysis:   132 
a. Only known “safe foods” (foods that do not induce repetitive vomiting) are to be consumed [ADDRESS_315594] 6 ml  of blood drawn for analysis:  137 
a. 5.5 ml of blood for testing of potential food reactions  138 
b. 0.5 ml of blood for RNA/DNA analysis , which will be stored. [ADDRESS_315595] and/or [ADDRESS_315596]  144 
9. Blood will be analyzed by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a research lab at the University of Michigan to determine 145 
differences in the PI’s assay between potentially tolerated and not tolerated foods (see description of [ADDRESS_315597] lines 216-232 )   147 
10. After identification of potentially “safe foods” to be introduced in the future, the information will be 148 
given to the clinical study team  and child’s clinician , who will contact [CONTACT_259616] 149 
(parental preference).   150 
a. Parents will be asked to detail current nutritional status, including foods tolerated or not 151 
tolerated since the initial blood draw.   Results will be recorded by [CONTACT_259617] 152 
parents will be asked to return Questionnaire Two.  153 
b. After discussion within the clinical team (including clinical research team and child’s 154 
clinicians), p arents  will be instructed to introduce new foods identified as potentially safe into [ADDRESS_315598] 2 weeks after the initial blood draw. 6 cc will be 159 
drawn:  [ADDRESS_315599] panel of foods vs individually prepared foods 161 
b. To perform additional analyses including single cell RNASeq (scRNA -seq) on WBCs [ADDRESS_315600] is tolerating two or more triggers foods for 3 or more 165 
months:  [ADDRESS_315601] 6 mL drawn for analysis  168

B. Sources of Materials  174 
 175 
The research material obtained from the human subjects  176 
1. 6ml of blood in a K2 EDTA (lavender top) blood tube withdrawn by [CONTACT_259618] 177 
the blood draw unit ( 0.5 ml of this will be used to isolate DNA for potential future sequencing under a 178 
separate IRB ). White blood cells (WBCs) will be isolated from 5.5 ml of blood using ACK buffer lysis of red 179 
blood cells, within 1 hour of blood collection, as performed previously for the Case Study ( HUM00155216). 180 
Blood will be kept on ice in the K2 EDTA tubes during the waiting period (< 1 hour). WBCs will be plated in [ADDRESS_315602] blood draw may occur (or second blood draw if scRNA were not performed for that patient) [ADDRESS_315603] (or second if no scRNA -seq) will be performed for this purpose at least 3 months after the initial blood 191 
draw. In this case, the cells will be prepared in the same manner as the initial blood draw, but treated with 192

 only a limited number of safe, trigger foods, and outgrown trigger foods.  193 
2. At the termination of the protocol samples and data will cease to be accessed, or  otherwise 194 
accessed again after IRB approval transferred to another existing protocol.  There are no plans to destroy 195 
records or samples.  196 
 197 
Protection of Information:  [ADDRESS_315604] that includes identifiable data will be kept in a REDCap “Study Housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” [ADDRESS_315605] information 205 
including address, email, phone number, documentation of blood draw, samples saved and filling 206 
out of questionnaires.  207 
2. All data variables will be kept in a separate “Research Data” REDCap database.  Subjects will be [ADDRESS_315606] number in this database.  Data will include:  [ADDRESS_315607] number without personal 217 
identifiers.  218 
5. Parents/guardians may request that stored blood samples be destroyed at the end of the study.  [ADDRESS_315608] of care for failed trials.  231 
 232 
Blood draw from infants and toddlers is a safe procedure with minimal risks. Trained and experienced 233 
phlebotomists at UMHS perform blood draws on infants and toddlers routinely. The procedure may cause 234 
anxiety for the infant/toddler. The test can result in a small bruise or mild soreness for the child at the site of [ADDRESS_315609] for a few days.  236 
 237 
A risk of breach of confidentiality always exists in all studies.  238 
 239 
Describe alternate treatments and procedures  240 
The parent/child can proceed with introduction of new foods per guidance of the nutritionist.  This is based [ADDRESS_315610] or pediatric clinician. Suitable FPI[INVESTIGATOR_259608] 254 
will be  contact[CONTACT_129617] / or phone. An option to opt out will be provided. If patients are interested in [ADDRESS_315611] their clinical care.  259 260 
Describe the circumstances of consent 261 
A study coordinator  or clinical study team member  familiar with the study protocol will obtain informed 262 
consent for all participants. Consent/assent will be obtained prior to any study measures/questionnaires. [ADDRESS_315612] of care in 271 
managing reactions to failed trials.  272 273 
2.The risk from blood draw is minimal and routinely performed by [CONTACT_259619] . 274275
3. All data variables will be kept in a separate “Research Data” REDCap database.  Subjects will be [ADDRESS_315613] number in this database. 277 278 
4. A separate “Housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” REDCap database will be used to link the patient identifiable information and [ADDRESS_315614] has the potential to modify patient care strategy for patients with FPI[INVESTIGATOR_5165]. As such, 298 
random guessing of safe foods would be replaced by a scientific “guide” to what might be hypoallergenic to 299 
the body’s immune cells using this test.  [ADDRESS_315615] is predictive or partially predictive. 305

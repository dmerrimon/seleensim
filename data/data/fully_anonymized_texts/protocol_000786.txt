The planned total sample size for this study is 52 with 26 patient s in the bempedoic acid 180 mg group 
and 26 in the placebo group.  This sample size is expected to  
  
Analysis Populations 
The Full Analysis S et (FAS), used for all of the efficacy analyses, is defined as all randomized patients 
with a baseline lipid value, at least 1 postbaseline lipid value, and having taken their study drug within 
2 days of the lipid measurement.  The FAS is also known as the modified intention- to-treat (mITT) set of 
patients.  Patients in the FAS will be included in their randomized treatment group, regardless of the 
treatment they actually received.   Other subsets of the FAS will be considered to evaluate primary and 
secondary endpoints as sensitivity analyses and the details will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 
The Safety Population (SP), used for all of the safety summaries, is defined as all randomized patients who received at least 1  dose of study medication.  Patients in the SP will be included in the treatment 
group that they actually received, regardless of  their randomized treatment.   
Primary Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from baseline to Month  2 in LDL -C.  The primary 
efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with treatment group as a factor and baseline LDL -C as a covariate.  The details of the ANCOVA model and options to correct for 
unequal variances will be described in the SAP.  Baseline LDL -C is defined as the average of S4 and 
Day [ADDRESS_344655] (LOCF).  The least squares mean (LSM) and standard error (SE) will be provided for both treatment groups, along with the placebo- corrected LSM, its 
95% confidence interval (CI) and associated p- value.  
Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints based on lipid parameters will be analyzed in the similar fashion as for the primary 
endpoint. 
Safety Analyses  
Descriptive summary will be provided for the safety data in this study.   
The su bject incidence of all treatment -emergent AEs (TEAE), SAEs, related AEs, AEs leading to 
withdrawal of study drug and/or study, fatal AEs, and AEs of special interest (AESI) will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term in descending order of frequency and by [CONTACT_1570].

4.1. Overview of the Disease Under Study   
Bempedoic acid (ETC -1002) is an inhibitor of adenosine triphosphate- citrate lyase (ACL) 
(adenosine triphosphate [ATP] citrate lyase), an enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxy-3- methylglutaryl 
coenzyme A (HMG -CoA) reductase in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.  It is an oral first-
in-class small molecule designed to lower low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL- C) levels in 
patients with high cardiovascular (CV) risk unable to meet their treatment goals with currently 
available lipid -lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) reduces LDL receptor recycling to the 
hepatic surface, thereby [CONTACT_282626].  Monoclonal 
antibodies neutralize  PCSK9 and reduce LDL -C levels when administered alone or in 
combination with other background therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
Elevated LDL -C is a major modifiable risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) (Sharrett 2001) .  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_282600], CV disease is the number  1 cause of death globally 
(WHO 2015) .  An estimated 17.5 million people died from CV  diseases in 2012, representing 
31% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, an estimated 7.4 million were due to coronary heart 
disease (CHD) and 6.7 million were due to stroke (WHO 2015) . Cardiovascular disease remains 
the leading cause of death among Europeans, Americans, and around the world.  The Global 
Burden of Disease study estimated that 29.6% of all deaths worldwide ( approximately 
15.6 million deaths ) were caused by [CONTACT_282627] 2010, more than all communicable, maternal, 
neonatal and nutritional disorders combined, and double the number of deaths caused by [CONTACT_282628] (Nichols 2014) .  In the [LOCATION_002]  (US), based on 2011 death rate data, more than 
2150 Americans die from CV diseases daily, an aver age of 1 death every 40  seconds.  
Approximately 155,000 Americans dying from CV disease are less than 65  years of age.  In 
2011, 34% of deaths due to CV  disease occurred prior to the age of 75  years, less than the 
current 78.7- year average life expectancy (Mozffarian 2015) . As such new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_282601]. 
Global guidelines recommend lowering o f LDL-C to levels below 100 mg/dL and often under 
70 mg/dL (Jacobson 2014)  or reduction of ≥50% (Stone 2013).  In order to reach these goals, 
lipid-lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_282602].  The combination of bempedoic acid and 
a PCSK9  inhibitor (PCSK9 i) may offer a n additional treatment option in the future for 
physicians . 
4.2. Background on Bempedoic Acid  
4.2.1. Mechanism of Action  
Bempedoic acid  is a first -in-class small molecule inhibitor of ACL, an enzyme upstream of 
HMG-CoA in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.  Bempedoic acid is a prodrug that requires 
activation in liver to ETC -1002- co-enzyme  A (ETC -1002- CoA) , which mediates competitive 
Bempedoic Acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-039  Amendment 1, 05 March 2017 
Confidential Page 20 of 114 inhibition of ACL.  Inhibition of ACL by [CONTACT_76753]-1002- CoA decreases cholesterol synthesis in liver 
leading to increased LDL  receptor (LDLR) expression and LDL particle clearance from the 
blood.  Therefore, inhibition of ACL by [CONTACT_76753]-1002-CoA reduces LDL- C via the same pathway 
as HMG -CoA reductase inhibition by [CONTACT_101818]. 
An important differentiating feature of bempedoic acid  is that it does not inhibit cholesterol 
synthesis in skeletal muscle.  In addition to preliminary data suggesting that only minor amounts 
of bempedoic acid  enter skeletal muscle (<5% of systemic exposure), skeletal muscle does not 
express the enzyme required to activate bempedoic acid  to ETC -1002-CoA and inhibit ACL.  
Therefore, bempedoic acid  is not anticipated to mediate the adverse effects associated with 
inhibition of biological intermediates within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in skeletal 
muscle.   The long- term safety of bempedoic acid and its metabolites regarding human skeletal 
muscle is not yet established.

6.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase  2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group multicenter study 
that will be conducted at approxima tely 20  clinical sites in North America.  Screening 
Month -4.5 (Visit S1) will occur approximately 1 8 weeks prior to randomization.  After 
providing informed consent at Visit S1, patients will stop all background lipid- lowering therapy 
and lipid -modifying nutritional supplements, if applicable.  All patients will return to the clinic 
on Month -3 (V isit S2).  During this visit, patients with an LDL -C value ≥160 mg/d L (via central 
or local lab) and triglycerides <500  mg/d L (via central or local lab) will initiate PCSK9 
background therapy (Repatha 420 mg once montly [ QM]).  Sites that do not use a local lab may 
need to bring patients back for another visit to administer PCSK9 background therapy, as a 
qualifying LDL value is required prior to initiating  the 3 -month PCSK9i run -in period.  No other 
background lipid-modifying therapy except study provided PCSK9i will be permitted during the 
trial.  After 1 month (at least 30 ± 3 days) , patients will return to the clinic for Month -2 
(Visit S3 ) followed by [CONTACT_43380] -1 ( Visit S4 ) 30 ± 3 days later.  During these visits , Repatha will 
be administered, labs will be collected , and safety assessed .  At Visit S4 , LDL- C will be checked 
a second time prior to randomization.  Patients with an LDL -C ≥70 mg/d L (via central lab only) 
at this visit will qualify for randomization.  Patien ts with LDL -C <70  mg/dL at Visit S4 will be 
screen failed and no further PCSK9i therapy will be administered.  Day  1 should occur 30 days  ± 
3 days  after Visit S4, once LDL- C eligibility is establis hed.  On Day  1, qualified patients will be 
randomized 1:1 to bempedoic acid 180 mg/day (n  = 26) or matching placebo (n = 26).  
Randomized patients will return for clinic visits at Month 1 (Visit T2) and Month 2 (Visit T3).  
Both study drug and PCSK9i doses will be administered on site during clinic visits after all 
procedures have been completed.   
An independent expert Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will formally review accumulating 
unblinded safety and efficacy data across the bempedoic acid program .

≥160 mg/d L (via central or local lab) and triglycerides <500  mg/d L (via central or local lab) will 
initiate study-provided PCSK9 i background therapy (Repatha 420 mg QM).  No other 
background lipid-modifying therapy except study provided PCSK9i will be permitted during the 
trial.  
Patients who are deemed not eligible for randomization at any point during screening will be 
notified by [CONTACT_282630].  
As necessary, for reasons of safety if a patient begins the run-in period but screen fails prior to randomization, the patient may be asked to return to the clinical site for further evaluation and 
follow-up of AEs. 
6.6.2. Randomization and Treatment Period 
Patients who satisfy all entry criteria , complete the 1.5-month screening period and 3-month 
PCSK9 i run-in period, and have an LDL- C ≥70 mg/dL at S 4 will be randomized.   
Randomization numbers will be assigned via IWRS on Day 1 (Visit T1).  Patients will be

• Patients will be required to stop taking all prescription or nonprescription drugs or 
dietary supplements taken for the purpose of lipid regulation at Month -4.5.  With the 
exception of the study provided PCSK9i (Repatha 420 mg QM), no other lipid-modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_282604].  
8.2.2. Allowable Medications  
• Hormone replacement (if stable 6  weeks prior to Month -4.5) 
• Thyroid replacement ( if stable 6  weeks prior to Month -4.5) 
• Obesity medication (if stable 3  months prior to Month -4.5) 
8.3. Blinding  
Patients who satisfy all entry criteria during the screening phase and complete the PCSK9 i run-in 
period will be randomized to a treatment group  at Day  1 (Visit T1) .  The Investigator or designee 
will contact [CONTACT_282631].  The IWRS will determine 
the randomized treatment assignment number and the appropriate study drug container via 
medication identification numbers (MED  ID).  A patient is considered to be randomized when 
they have been assigned a MED ID number by [CONTACT_10966].  
After patients have been randomized, study drug, which is assigned by [CONTACT_8784], will be 
administered in a double-blind fashion.  The Sponsor, all clinical site personnel (Investigator, 
pharmacist, etc), and other vendor personnel will be blinded to the treatment group for each 
patient .  Patients will also be blinded to the treatment they receive.  Unblinded User(s) will be 
designated for each clinical site and at the sponsor (or designee) as needed.  Unblinded 
individuals will be provided IWRS access allowing t hem the ability to perform emergency 
unblinding of treatment for an individual patient.  An affirmative entry of the user’s login details will be required before the treatment group is displayed.  Unblinding at the clinical site for any 
other reason will be considered a protocol deviation.  Unblinded treatments for patients will 
NOT automatically discontinue the patient from the study.  To discontinue the patient from the 
study, the appropriate clinical site personnel will need to register the ‘discontinuation’ visit 
separately.  
Blinding of treatment must be maintained for all patients unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], the safety of the patient may be at risk.  Only under the rarest of circumstances 
should the Investigator consider breaking the blind and only when medical/supportive care 
cannot be provided without determining if the patient is receiving active drug treatment.  In the 
event that the blind needs to be broken prior to completion of the study, the Investigator should 
contact [CONTACT_282632].  If the blind must be broken prior to 
consultation with the Medical Monitor, contact [CONTACT_282633] [ADDRESS_344675] document in the 
patient’s medical record the date, time, and reason for breaking the blind, and the names of 
personnel involved.

responsible for PK analysis) will have access to the randomization codes to facilitate  PK 
analytical wo rk, and will be instructed to not communicate in any manner information associated 
with treatment assignment to any personnel at the clinical site, the Sponsor, or contract research organization ( CRO ).

personnel from the clinical site, the p atient, the Sponsor, and CRO . 
An independent DMC will monitor unblinded accumulating patient safety and efficacy data until the
 last patient has completed study treatment.   In addition, data on SAEs and deaths will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_282634].  At each DMC review, relevant unblinded safety and efficacy information from ongoing studies will be provided to the DMC by [CONTACT_10981], unblinded
p
rogrammer and statistician.  Additional details will be provided in a DMC 
Ch
arter.  
8.4. Overdose  
There is no specific antidote for an overdose of bempedoic acid.  Management of an overdose 
should be focused on the treatment of symptoms.  These symptoms should be managed 
according to current standards of care with appropriate supportive measures.  Also discontinuation of study drug should be considered, based on medical judgement. 

Bempedoic Acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-[ADDRESS_344676] ( IMP) for this study.   The  IMP for 
this study includes bempedoic acid (180- mg film- coated tablets) and matching placebo (film -
coated tablets).  IMP will be distributed and released in accordance with regional and local 
requirements during the conduct of the study. 
PCSK9 i will be pr ovided as background therapy.  This will be dispensed and administered 
during clinic visits and will be stored and taken as commercially labeled.   
The MED ID number (an identifier on the study drug packaging) will be obtained via IWRS and 
used to select PCSK9 i and double- blind IMP for the treatment period from available clinical 
supplies at the clinical site.  
Double-blind IMP will be dispensed in 35-day supply increments to patients by [CONTACT_282635] .  Patients will receive one 35 -day supply bottle at Day  1 (Visit T1) and at  
Month 1 (Visit T2 ).  
Please see Pharmacy Manual for detailed storage requirements and management instructions.  
9.2. Administration of Investigational Medicinal Product  
Patients will be instructed to ingest IMP starting at Visit T1 for the duration of treatment period 
orally once daily (once every 24  hours) at approximately the same time each day with water.   
IMP may be taken with or without food.  On clinic visit days, patients will be instructed to delay ingestion of IMP until all study procedures have been completed.  If a patient arrive s at clinic on 
Visits  T1, T2 , or T3  without having fasted or having taken IMP before arriving at the clinic, 
reschedule the visit (the next day or as soon as possible) so that the fasting and dosing requirements have been met.  Patients will be instructed to return all packaging and unused IMP 
at each clinic visit.  
If the patient forgets to take IMP at the usual time  on nonclinic visit days, it may be taken up to 
12 hours later the same day.  After that time, the patient should not take IMP that day and should 
resume ingestion of IMP the following day.  If a patient fails to take IMP , details describing the 
reasons for nondosing should be documented in the patient’s medical records and eCRF.  Extra IMP (7  extra days per bottle) is provided and can be used, if needed, prior to the next visit or to 
replace a dose of IMP that cannot be used because it is lost or damaged.  
PCSK9 i will be administered on site at Visits S2, S3, S4, T1 , and T2.  Doses will be stored and 
administered as required in prescribing information  
Bempedoic Acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc.

considered as having completed participation in the study.  
Patients who temporarily withdraw from IMP prior to Month 2 (Visit T3 ) for any reason may 
restart IMP providing that 1) the patient and the investigator are in agreement regarding this 
course of action, 2) the p atient has been off of IMP for 2 weeks or less; and 3)  IMP can be started 
as soon as possible.  For cases where the patient has been off of IMP for more than [ADDRESS_344686] the medical monitor for approval prior to restarting IMP. 
The patient’s decision to participate in the clinical study is voluntary.   Patients may refuse to 
continue in the study and/or withdraw from participation in this study at any time, for any reason, 
specified or unspecified, and without penalty or loss of benefits to which the patient is otherwise 
entitled.  
It is the right and duty of the Investigator to interrupt the treatment of any patient whose health or 
well-being may be threatened by [CONTACT_94597].  Such patients should be withdrawn 
from the study and should not be continued under a modified regimen. 
Patients who are withdrawn from the study may not re-enter.  The reasons for withdrawal from 
this study may include:  
• Patient’s  withdrawal of consent 
• Failure  to comply with the protocol 
• Lost to follow-up 
• Illness , condition, or procedural complication (including AEs) affecting the patient’s 
ability to participate or r equiring prohibited medication 
• The Sponsor or Investigator terminates the study  
• In the Investigator’s judgment, it is deemed in the best interest of the patient to discontinue his/her participation in the study 
• Any other reason 
If a patient is lost to follow- up, every reasonable effort must be made by [CONTACT_282639]/withdrawal.  The 
measures taken to follow -up must be documented. 
10.3.2. Procedures for Early Withdrawal  
If a patient withdraws or is removed from the study for any reason, all End of S tudy procedures 
should be completed.  Reason for withdrawal, date of the discontinuation, and date of the last dose of study drug should be recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF.  Additionally, the

Confidential Page 44 of 114 11. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
11.1. Safety Parameters  
At all clinic visits, investigators will review all safety information including vital signs, A Es, and 
concomitant medications and will ensure that the collected data are recorded into the appropriate 
eCRF.   Additionally, clinical laboratory samples will be collected and sent for analysis and the 
investigator will review the results to ensure continued patient safety while participating in the 
study.  
11.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
Demographic data and a complete medical history will be obtained from the patient.  For medical 
history, conditions that are relevant and/or clinically significant should be captured with at least a 
start date (month and year) and whether the condition is ongoing or resolved.  All surgeries 
regardless of date should be reported.  
11.1.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include DBP and SBP as well as heart rate.  
The patient should sit qui etly for 5  minutes prior to collection of vital signs.  At all time points, 
vitals will be collected prior to blood collection.  Blood pressure (BP)  and heart rate will be 
measured using a calibrated, fully automated machine with a cuff that is appropriate to the size 
of the upper arm.  If a fully automated machine is not available, BP may be measured manually.  
The same method (either automated or manual) and the same arm (right or left) must be used throughout the study.  The patient should be in a seated  position with feet touching the floor.  
Patients should be seated quietly for at least 5  minutes in a chair with their backs supported, their 
feet flat on the ground, and their arms bared and supported at heart level. 
11.1.3. Weight, Height, and Body Mass Index 
Weight will be measured on a calibrated scale while fasted and after voiding.  Body weight will 
be measured while fasting, using consistent scales, after voiding, and without shoes and 
outerwear (eg, coats) .  
Height will be measured using standard clinic pr ocedures.  
BMI will be calculated using the formula:  
BMI (kg/m
2) = weight in kg  / (height in meters)2

It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review the results of all laboratory tests as they become 
availab le and to sign and date the report to document their review.  For each laboratory test 
outside of the laboratory normal range, the Investigator needs to ascertain if this is a clinically 
significant change from baseline for the individual patient.  The Investigator may repeat the 
laboratory test or request additional tests to verify the results of the original laboratory test.  

Bempedoic Acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-[ADDRESS_344690] are outlined in the 
sections below. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Monitoring and Management of Elevated Liver Function Tes ts 
If at any time after randomization a patient experiences a new ALT and/or AST >3  × ULN, the 
patient will undergo repeat confirmatory liver function test (LFT) assessment as soon as is 
reasonably possible, preferably within 3 to 7 days of the laboratory result becoming available.  
Repeat LFT assessment will include:  1) measurement of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total 
and direct bilirubin, prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), eosinophil count, CK, antihepatitis A virus (total), HBsAg (confirmation of screening measurement), HCV 
(confirmation of screening measurement), and anticytomegalovirus/immunoglobulin M; 
2) history of concomitant medication use; 3) history of exposure to environmental chemical agents, including ethanol; and 4) query for related symptoms.  Additionally, further testing such 
as liver ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scanning may be warranted to rule out 
additional pathology depending on clinical presentation and should be discussed with the 
Sponsor personnel or the authorized Medical Monitor.  
• If repeat LFT assessment confirms ALT and/or AST >3  × ULN, consideration should 
be given to withdrawing the patient and administering no further doses of study drug.  
At the investigator’s discretion, study d rug may be interrupted and the patient 
rechallenged with study drug after LFTs have returned to baseline levels.  
• If repeat LFT assessment confirms ALT and/or AST >5  × ULN, patient should be 
withdrawn from IMP treatment,  but will be asked to continue to be followed for 
safety using the protocol- specified visit schedule (see Appendix 1) . 
• If repeat LFT assessment confirms ALT and/or AST >3  × ULN in addition to any of 
the following, the patient should be given no further IMP treatment, but will be asked 
to continue to be followed for safety using the protocol- specified visit schedule (see 
Appendix 1) : 
− TB >2  × ULN  
Note:  In the case of patients with Gilbert’s disease, TB will be fractionated and 
the determination of 2 × ULN will be based upon direct (conjugated) bilirubin. 
− INR >1.5 × ULN (unless th e patient is on stable dose of anticoagulation 
medication)  
− Appearance or worsening of right upper abdominal discomfort, anorexia, fatigue, 
nausea, vomiting, fever, rash, or eosinophilia

If at any time after randomization, a patient experiences a decrease in eGFR to the level of 
15 mL/min/1.73 m2) or if the patient experiences acute renal failure, the patient should be 
withdrawn from IMP treatment but will be asked to continue to be followed for safety using the 
protocol- specified visit schedule (see Appendix 1 ) 
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Monitoring and Management of Elevated Creatine Kinase 
If at any time after randomization  a patient experiences a marked CK elevation >5 × ULN, the 
patient will undergo repeat confirmatory assessment as soon as is reasonably possible, preferably 
within 3  to 7 days of the laboratory result becoming available.  
Repeat CK assessment will include query for related symptoms.  
• If the repeat CK assessment confirms an unexplained (ie, not associated with recent 
trauma or physically strenuous activity) CK abnormality >5 × ULN, if asymptomatic , 
the patient should receive further assessment and investigation into the cause, assess 
whether there is renal injury , and measure CK approximately weekly or more 
frequently if clinically indicated until resolution.  If CK levels continue to rise; IMP 
should be discontinued.  
• If sym ptomatic, the following should be completed: 
− Hold IMP  
− Clarification of the nature, duration, and intensity of muscle symptoms 
− Review possible predisposing factors, such as unaccustomed exercise, heavy 
alcohol intake, viral illness (consider performing serology)  
− Evaluation for additional diagnoses or other conditions which can cause 
myopathy including muscle tenderness (by [CONTACT_153056]), weakness, rash, measurement of 
serum creatinine, dipstick urinalysis with microscopy if indicated  
− Obtain clinical chemistries to assess the possibility of lactic acidosis  
− Follow symptoms and CK until the abnormality has resolved 
− If based on the above evaluation an alternative explanation is suspected, consideration can be given to resuming IMP once CK returns to baseline levels 
− If no alternative explanation exists, consideration should be given to withdrawing the patient from IMP treatment.  
• If the repeat CK assessment confirms an unexplained (ie, not associated with recent trauma or physically strenuous activity) CK abnormality as listed below, the patient 
should be withdrawn and given no further doses of study drug:  
− >10 × ULN, even in the absence of symptoms.  
− In all cases, evaluate the signs/s ymptoms and laboratory evaluations as outlined 
above.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Monitoring and Management of Potential Hypoglycemia and Metabolic Acidosis 
Patients will be educated on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.  If such signs and 
symptoms are  experienced, patients will be instructed to report these signs and symptoms to the 
investigator.  
During each study visit, patients will be reminded to report all signs and symptoms associated 
with hypoglycemia to the investigator.  For each occurrence of patient -reported signs and 
symptoms associated with hypoglycemia, the investigator will discuss these symptoms with the 
patient and assess whether they are attributable to hypoglycemia or to another potential cause.  
All investigator -confirmed occurrences of hypoglycemia will be recorded as an AE.  All 
occurrences of signs and symptoms that are not confirmed by [CONTACT_282643]. 
Clinical laboratories will be assessed to det ermine any signs of anion gap metabolic acidosis.  If 
laboratories are consistent with metabolic acidosis, immediate follow up with the patient for 
further medical evaluation of the acidosis will occur.  This event should be captured as an AE.  
Bempedoic Acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-[ADDRESS_344691] a 
causal relationship with treatment.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse 
events observed by [CONTACT_282644]’s 
medical record.  
An AE can be:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign/symptom, including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease  
• Laboratory abnormali ty or diagnostic test abnormalities (eg, x -ray) should be reported 
as an AE if one of the following occurs   
− Treatment required due to the abnormality 
− Discontinuation of IMP 
− Per Investigator judgement 
• TEAEs are defined as AEs that begin or worsen after the first dose of study drug 
administration, as defined in the S tatistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
12.1.2. Adverse Drug Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug reaction (ADR).  “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a 
causal relationship between the medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility 
(ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out). 
An unexpected ADR is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (eg, IB for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product). 
12.1.3. Reporting for Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring duri ng the course of the study (starting from signing informed consent 
through [ADDRESS_344692] dose of study treatment) will be collected on the AE eCRF.  Patients 
should be instructed to report any AE that they experience to the investigator.  Investigator s 
should make an assessment for AEs at each visit and record the event on the appropriate AE 
eCRF.  
Bempedoic Acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-039  Amendment 1, 05 March 2017 
Confidential Page 52 of 114 Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_256299].  A cluster of signs 
and symptoms that results from a single cause should be reported as a single AE (eg, fever, 
elevated white blood cells [WBC], cough, abnormal chest x- ray, etc, can all be reported as 
“pneumonia” if that is the final diagno sis).  However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom 
is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_093], it should be recorded as a separate AE on the eCRF.  Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or 
surgic al procedure should be recorded as the AE, not the procedure itself .  
Any medical condition already present at screening or baseline should not be reported as an AE unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline worsens in severity o r 
seriousness at any time during the study.  In this case, it should be reported as an AE. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination findings that are detected during 
the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen during the study should be reported as AEs , as described below .  The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific 
judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  Significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study 
will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically 
significant.  Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
An abnormal laboratory value that is not already associated with an AE is to be recorded as an AE only if any one of the following criteria is met: 
• an action on the study drug is made as a result of the abnormality 
• intervention for management of the abnor mality is required  
• at the discretion of the investigator should the abnormality be deemed clinically 
significant  
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness, and causal relationship to the IMP.  
For each AE, the following information will be recorded: 
• Description of the event (eg, headache)  
• Date of onset  
• Date of resolution (or that the event is continuing) 
• Action taken as a result of the event  
• Seriousness of the event 
• Severity of the event  
• Outcome of the event  
• Investigator’s assessment of  relationship to IMP or PCSK9 i. 
The investigator will carefully evaluate the comments of the patient and the response to treatment in order that he/she may judge the true nature and severity of the AE.  The question of 
Bempedoic Acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-039  Amendment 1, 05 March 2017 
Confidential Page 53 of 114 the relationship of AEs to IMP administration should be determined by [CONTACT_282645].  
12.1.4. Severity  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess the intensity (severity) of an AE.  
The severity of the AE will be  characterized as mild, moderate, or severe according to the 
following definitions: 
• Mild:  Events are usually transient and do not interfere with the patient’s daily 
activities  
• Moderate:  Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient 
and may interfere with daily activities  
• Severe:  Events interrupt the patient’s usual daily activity, are incapacitating with 
inability to do usual activities, or significantly affect clinical status and warrant 
intervention and/or close follow-up  
Note:  A severe AE need not be serious and an SAE need not, by [CONTACT_108], be severe. 
12.1.5. Relationship  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship between the IMP and the AE.  The 
degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the IMP may be described using the following scale:  
• Not Related:  No temporal association and other etiologies are likely the cause  
• Unlikely:  While cannot be definitively ruled as not related to IMP, a causal 
association is remote, and other etiologies are more likely to be the cause.  For reporting and summarization, events assessed as Unlikely to be related to IMP will be consi dered as Not Related to IMP.  
• Possible:  Temporal association, but other etiologies are likely the cause.  However, 
involvement of the IMP cannot be excluded. 
• Probable:  Temporal association, other etiologies are possible but unlikely.  The event 
may respond if the IMP is discontinued. 
• Definite:  Established temporal association with administration of the IMP with no 
other more probable cause.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the event should resolve when the IMP is discontinued and recur on rechallenge. 
12.1.6. Monitoring and Follow- up of Adverse Events  
Patients having AEs will be monitored with relevant clinical as sessments and laboratory tests, as 
determined by [CONTACT_093].  All follow -up results are to be reported to the Sponsor personnel 
or the authorized Medical Monitor.  Any actions taken and follow up results must be recorded 
either on the appropriate page of the eCRF or in appropriate follow-up written correspondence, 
as well as in the patient’s source documentation.  Follow-up laboratory results should be filed with the patient’s source documentation. 
Bempedoic Acid   Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol 1002-[ADDRESS_344693] be repeated at appropriate intervals until final resolution or 
stabilization of the event(s).  
Patients with AEs related to IMP that are ongoing at study discontinuation or completio n must be 
followed until resolution, until deemed stable/chronic, or for [ADDRESS_344694], with the exception of patients reporting SAEs (see Section  12.2.2).  
12.1.7. Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  
TEAE are defined as AEs that begin or worsen after the first dose of study drug administration, 
as defined in the SAP. 
12.2. Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• An important medical event 
NOTE:  An emergency room visit without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_282607] , nor does hospi[INVESTIGATOR_282608].  However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_282609].  Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_180136] (eg, no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042]) will not be considered 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room, blood dyscrasias, convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.

Clinical Study Protocol 1002-039  Amendment 1, 05 March 2017 
Confidential Page 55 of 114 Events or Outcomes Not Qualifying as Serious Adverse Events  
The following are not considered SAEs and therefore do not need to be reported as such: 
• Preplanned or elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , including social and/or convenience situations 
(eg, due to inclement  weather)  
• Overdose of either Esperion study drug or concomitant medication unless the event 
meets SAE criteria (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  However, the event should still be captured 
as a non serious AE on the appropriate eCRF page 
12.2.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent until 30 days following study completion / 
discontinuation must be reported by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_282610] [ADDRESS_344695] information for the Safety d esignee  will be provided in the SAE 
Completion Guidelines.  
The investigator is required to submit SAE reports to their IRB/IEC in accordance with local 
requirements.  All investigators involved in studies using the same investigational product will 
receiv e any safety alert notifications for onward submission to their local IRB as required.  All 
reports sent to investigators will be blinded. 
All SAEs should be recorded on the eCRF and source documents.  Criteria for documenting the 
relationship to IMP and severity will be the same as those previously described. 
The investigator must continue to follow the patient until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the 
patient dies . 
Within [ADDRESS_344696] update the SAE 
information on the AE eCRF and submit any supporting documentation (eg, patient discharge 
summary or autopsy reports) to designated Safety contact .  
The Sponsor (and/or legally transferred designee) will report SAEs and suspected and 
unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) as required by [CONTACT_282646], 
IECs/IRBs, and/or investigators/institutions in compliance with all reporting requirements 
according to local regulations, laws, and Good Clinical Practice s (GCPs ).  The investigator 
should notify their  IEC/IRB of SAEs occurring at the ir site and other S AE reports received from

• Added/revised the following subject exclusion criteria to exclude patients that were 
recently on PCSK9 inhibitors as well as HeFH patients (this population will be 
studied in P3 trials):  
− Heterozygous Famil ial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)  
− Concomitant use of a PCSK9 inhibitor (Praluent® [alirocumab] or Repatha® 
[evolocumab]) at (Visit S1) or prior use within the past 16 weeks of Visit  S1

• Updated contraception language to align with other P3 ETC- 1002 clinical trials.   
− Added requirement that women use 2 rather than  1 form of acceptable 
contraception; expanded definition of true abstinence. 
• Removed remnant ECG language.  There are no ECG assessments, these were 
inadvertently added to the original protocol  
• Removed evaluation of PCSK9  levels from exploratory objectives and endpoints 
• Specified that LDL -C levels used for evaluation for study inclusion c an use a local

This is a Ph ase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group multicenter study 
that will be conducted at approximately 20 clinical sites in North America.  Screening 
Month -2.5 (Visit S1) will occur approximately 10 weeks prior to randomization.  After 
providing informed consent at Visit S1, patients will stop all background lipid- lowering therapy 
and lipid- modifying nutritional supplements, if applicable.  All patients will return to the clinic 
on W eek -4 (V isit S2).  During this visit, patients w ith an LDL- C value ≥160 mg/d L (via central 
or local lab) and triglycerides <500  mg/d L (via central or local lab) will initiate PCSK9 
background therapy (Repatha 420 mg QM).  Sites that do not use a local lab may need to bring 
patients back for another visit to administer PCSK9 background therapy, as a qualifying LDL value is required prior to initiating background therapy.  No other background lipid- modifying 
therapy except study provided PCSK9 will be permitted during the trial.   After a 1-month (at 
least 30 days) PCSK9i lipid- stabilization period, patients will return to the clinic for Visit S3.  
The sole purpose of this visit is to determine entry LDL-C prior to randomization.  Patients with an LDL- C ≥70 mg/d L (via central or local lab) at this visit will qualify for randomization.  
Patien ts with LDL -C <70  mg/dL at Visit S3  will be screen failed and no further PCSK9i therapy 
will be administered.  Day 1 should occur immediately (ideally within 3  days) after Visit S3, 
once LDL- C eligibility is established.  On Day  1, qualified patients will be randomized 1:1 to 
bempedoic acid 180 mg/day (n  = 26) or matching placebo (n = 26).  Randomized patients will

as AEs , as described below .  The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific 
judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is 
clinically significant.  Significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study 
will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant.  Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
An abnormal laboratory value that is not already associated with an AE is to be recorded as an AE only if any one of the following criteria is met:  
• an action on the study drug is made as a result of the abnormality 
• intervention for management of the abnormality is required 
• at the discretion of the investigator should the abnormality be deemed clinically 
significant

Events or Outcomes Not Qualifying as Serious Adverse Events  
The following are not considered SAEs and therefore do not need to be reported as such:  
• Preplanned or elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171298]/or convenience 
situations (eg, due to inclement weather)  
• Overdose of either Esperion study drug or concomitant medication unless the event meets SAE criteria (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  However,  the event should still be 
captured as a nonserious AE on the appropriate eCRF page

Improving Depression Management in Primary Care  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
July 19, [ADDRESS_675272] Title : Improving Depression Management in Primary Care (CDA- 19-108)  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_520587] (1616118-5 Leung 07 -19-21)_clinicaltrials.gov_LL_ceb  Page 2 1. Introduction/Background 
VA’s Primary Care –Mental Health Integration (PC -MHI) is rooted in evidence -based collaborative care models, 
where care managers, mental health specialists, and primary care providers jointly treat depression in primary 
care. While PC -MHI enabled specialists to support medication treatment in primary care, timely and sufficient 
access t o psychotherapy is unattainable1-3. Alternative therapy modalities are needed.  
Depression is disabling and affects one in five Veterans4. Psychotherapy is preferred by [CONTACT_68847]5, but fraught 
with multilevel barriers (e.g., staff availability, patient travel to clinic, limited clinic hours)6. Without enhancing 
existing PC -MHI models to enable better primary care patient access to effective psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Veteran 
engagement in depression treatment is unlikely to improve. 
This intervention  propos al aims to close the gap in psychotherapy access for VA primary care patients with 
depression by [CONTACT_520598] -MHI collaborative care models to improve uptake of computerized cognitive 
behavioral therapy (cCBT). cCBT is accessible 24/[ADDRESS_675273] effective cCBT 
trials.  
2. Aims and Purpose  
This protocol is for “Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265]”, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_520588], acceptability, and potential effects of cCBT -enhanced collaborative care on Veterans’ depression outcomes in one primary care clinic, in 
preparation for a larger hybrid effectiveness -implementation trial.  Overall, 74 eligible primary care patients with 
clinically significant depression will be 1:1 randomized to (1) cCBT -enhanced collaborative care; or (2) only VA 
usual care (UC), which typi [INVESTIGATOR_520589]. Since a substantial proportion (25 -60%) of 
patients with depression treated with just placebo have significant reductions in symptoms, the control group 
offers a more robustly designed pi[INVESTIGATOR_520590] a la rger RCT.  
Our primary hypothesis is that cCBT -enhanced collaborative care will be feasible and acceptable among 
Veterans in primary care. We also hypothesize that patients receiving cCBT -enhanced collaborative care may 
report moderate improvement s in depression symptoms, compared to patients receiving UC at [ADDRESS_675274] improvements in behavioral/patient 
activation , health -related quality of life , and other mental health sympto ms, compared to UC patients.  
3. Activities Overview  
Study participants will be randomized to either Usual Care (UC) , typi[INVESTIGATOR_520591], under their own PCP or the 
Intervention. Those in the intervention arm will receive cCBT -enhanced collaborative care sup ported by a 
depression care manager. The depression  care manager (a licensed social worker)  will facilitate  access to cCBT, 
promote and monitor cCBT use, reinforce CBT concepts  (during outside CBT session “homework”) , and monitor 
mental health symptoms  for each participant . Participants will be contact[CONTACT_520599] 15 -30-minute phone 
calls or by [CONTACT_11174] (e.g., email, Vets Prevail platform).  Additionally, a Primary Care  and a Psychiatry 
Consultant will meet weekly with the depression care manager in order to oversee study patient progress and 
the cCBT -enhanced collaborative care model broadly .  
Computer -based CBT (cCBT) will be provided via the VA -sponsered Vet’s PrevailSM program. This program is f ree 
for all Veterans , provides self -paced CBT lessons tailored to patients based on sociodemographics, and engage

support specialist chat support,  and safety monitoring that includes warm-handoffs to the VA Crisis Chat Line.  
4. Study Design 
This is a 2 -year pi[INVESTIGATOR_520592], acceptability, and potential effects of a 
cCBT -enhanced collaborative care model on depression symptoms and related outcomes . 
Eligible and consenting patient subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: 1) cCBT -
enhanced colla borative care (n= 37), or 2) usual care (n= 37). Randomization to condition will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_547], to account for differences in care delivery structure and for in treatment outcomes.  
4.1. Data collection methods  
A study team member will perform baseline (0 -month) assessments immediately following informed consent 
during a 45 -60-minute telephone (or in- person interview  should it be necessary) . A research assistant (RA) will 
perform the post-intervention ( 3-month) assessments during another 45-60- minute telephone interview . Post -
intervention assessme nts will only differ between intervention and control arms by [CONTACT_520600] (e.g., CSQ -8) for intervention participants only. As in prior studies, the GLA Veteran 
Engagement Team members provided feedback on assessment content and timing. See Table [ADDRESS_675276] of 
measures.

4.2. Sample description, development and rationale 
74 (37 male, 37 female) Veterans will be recruited from the Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, using a mix 
of purposive and convenience sampling. Purposive sampling will entail using electronic medical records (e.g., 
Project Title : Improving Depression Management in Primary Care (CDA- 19-108)  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_520587] (1616118-5 Leung 07 -19-21)_clinicaltrials.gov_LL_ceb Page 4 services utilization, depression diagnostic codes and/or screening data  from  CDW or other database) for 
targeted mailing of  recruitment letter and flyer. Convenience sampling will entail posting flyers on physical 
buildings and social media, accepting referrals from providers .  
Sample Sizes and Power Analyses : The trial will have the power to detect an effect size (ES) of 0.78 or greater ITT 
on the PHQ-9 of cCBT -enhanced collaborative care versus UC patients at 3-month follow -up. Data are based on 
Richards et al’s 2012 study,10 which reported a d=0.[ADDRESS_675280] support yields greater effects for 
cCBT.10 Assuming an 80% 3-month assessment completion rate (consistent with prior relevant studies)12-14 and 
2-tailed type I error of 0.05, if we then enroll 3 7 subjects to the intervention arm and 3 7 to the control arm ( 74 
total)  we will have 80% power to detect at least a 0.78 ES improvement of cCBT -enhanced collaborative care 
over usual care on the PHQ-9 (primary hypothesis). The pi[INVESTIGATOR_520593].  
4.3. Participant interactions and interventions 
Participants in cCBT -enhanced collaborative care arm (i.e. intervention arm) will be enrolled in VA-sponsored 
computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) program, Vets PrevailSM. This cCBT program delivers [ADDRESS_675281] chat support and safety monitoring (e.g., warm handoffs to the Crisis Chat Line). A licensed 
social worker with a master’s degree and knowledge/experience delivering CBT will ser ve as a care manager. 
The study care manager will facilitate access to cCBT, promote and monitor cCBT use, reinforce CBT concepts 
(during outside CBT session “homework”), and monitor mental health symptoms for each participant. She will 
contact [CONTACT_520601] 15 -30 minute phone calls or other means (e.g., email, Vets Prevail platform) for [ADDRESS_675282] 
(EHR) template notes  will be completed at study enrollment and conclusion and additional notes as needed, if 
patient safety monitoring protocols are activated  
Patients in the control condition will receive care that is consistent with recommended VA practice – usually 
PCP-prescribed antidepressant medications and/or referral to see a mental he alth specialist (who usually offers 
a brief assessment and a few short visits). The VA also has a wide suite of  veteran -centric  digital mental health 
tools for depression, posttraumatic stress, insomnia, etc., which are publicly available  and free . 
Partici pants will be assessed  in both conditions at baseline and 3 months (post -intervention) via 45 -60 minute 
telephone interviews. The baseline assessment will measure depression and other mental health symptoms; 
health-related quality of life; patient activation; demographics; physical and mental health comorbidities; 
substance use history; and treatment utilization. The 3-month assessment will re -measure depression and other 
mental health symptomatology; health -related quality of life; patient activation, plus  assess intervention group 
participants’ satisfaction with treatment; cCBT program usage; and interactions with care management. 
Intervention entails the cCBT-enhanced collaborative care, using VA-sponsored Vets Prevail.  
Compensation : Participants will be compensated with $ 30 VCS vouchers for completing the baseline assessment 
and a $45 VCS voucher for completing the  3-month  assessment ($ 75 total). Vouchers will be distributed at the 
time assessments are completed.  
5. Recruitment and Consent  
Project Title : Improving Depression Management in Primary Care (CDA- 19-108)  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_520587] (1616118-5 Leung 07 -19-21)_clinicaltrials.gov_LL_ceb Page 5 5.1. Recruitment Methods  
Veterans will be recruited from VA Greater Los Angeles (GLA) Healthcare System  primary care clinics (e.g., 
Primary & Ambulatory Care Clinic , Women’s health Clinic ), except for indivi duals empaneled to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_520594]. Patients with clinically significant depression (as detected on mandated annual 
screening or other means) will be referred by [CONTACT_520602]. Additionally, local case 
finding activities will be conducted for targeted mailing of recruitment letters and flyers.  
Direct Referrals : The study team will advertise the study through clinical staff meetings and emails to providers. 
The study team will be available online (via MS Teams, email, telephone) .  
Mailers:  The study team will identify Veterans based on screening data (e.g., Patient Health Questionnaire – 2 ), 
diagnostic codes , encounter data, antidepressant medications, and suicide flags from the Corporate Data 
Warehouse and other VA databases.   
A recruitment  letter  and study flyer  will be mailed (via USPS)  to the potential participant from their provider, 
clinic, or program  representative (e.g., primary care providers), only if the provider  agrees to the study team 
reaching out to the Veteran on their behalf. Mailings will describe the purpose of the study and request that the 
potential participant initiate contact [CONTACT_9881] (via phone or email) to indicate his/her agreement to 
participate. If no response is made within a 2-week period, the potential  participant may then be contact[CONTACT_54407]. We will not conduct any “cold calls”, that is use prior knowledge of private information to initiate contact [CONTACT_333549], who would otherwise not know the study team.  
Flyers and Social Media : The research team will advertise the study directly to Veterans via flyers developed for 
both male and female Veterans. The flyers contain the study phone number and email contact [CONTACT_520603]’s  contact [CONTACT_520604]. As in prior studies, the GLA 
Veteran Engagement Team was consulted regarding design and content of recruitment flyers. Local primary care and mental health clinic teams will be consulted regarding flyer placement and distribution. In addition to 
physical posting of recruitment flyers, the study team will contact [CONTACT_520605] (e.g., display on campus TVs or on social media). 
5.2. Informed Consent Procedures  
All study procedures  for this component  will be conducted via telephone and the internet . For this reason, we 
will request a HIPAA waiver and a Waiver of Documentation of Informed Consent from the IRB . 
We will obtain verbal consent and study team members  will be trained to recognize signs of cognitive and 
hearing impairment. Veterans who self -report that they are unable to hear the project coordinato r will be asked 
to paraphrase the first sentence of the study procedures. Veterans who cannot accomplish this task will be excluded from participation. Veterans who do not initially self -identify as hearing impaired will also be excluded 
from participation if they indicate not being able to hear or understand the consent items after they are 
repeated [ADDRESS_675283] -specific training . 
 
5.3. Inclusion/Exclusion Crite ria 
Inclusion : 
• Have access to computer (mobile or desktop), internet, telephone, and email  
Project Title : Improving Depression Management in Primary Care (CDA- 19-108)  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_520587] (1616118-5 Leung 07 -19-21)_clinicaltrials.gov_LL_ceb Page 6 • Able to read English text on a computer screen  
• Score 10 or higher on the PHQ -9 
Exclusion: 
• Have moderate -high suicide risk  (e.g., suicide flag)  or active suicidality 
• Have other serious mental illness (e.g. bipolar disorder, psychosis)  or medical disorder that would 
prevent/interfere with participation (e.g.  dementia/cognitive impairment, terminal illness).  
6. Data Sources and variables  
Study team members will  perform baseline (0 -month) and 3- month  (post -intervention) assessments. 
Deidentified data (containing study participant ID) will be entered into VA REDCap or a comparable database 
which supports trial data and will then be exported securely for analyses after study conclusion.  See Table [ADDRESS_675284] of primary and secondary outcomes and covariates.

7. Data Analysis  
An electronic database for data entry and management (using VA REDCap or other comparable software) will be 
built. We will perform all data analyses using STATA15 other available statistical package . A statistician  will be 
available for consultation in statistical design and analyses but will not have access to identifiable patient data . 
The full analysis set will be based on an intention-to -treat (I TT) analysis, which will comprise all participants who 
have been randomized to either study arm, regardless of length of follow -up or actual intervention received.  As 
Project Title : Improving Depression Management in Primary Care (CDA- 19-108)  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_520587] (1616118-5 Leung 07 -19-21)_clinicaltrials.gov_LL_ceb Page [ADDRESS_675285] of missing information and attrition.  
Demogra phic and baseline characteristics (e.g., demographics, combat status, alcohol and substance use 
disorders, medication use, health services use) will be presented as mean and standard deviations for continuous variables and sample proportions for categorica l variables. All descriptive statistics will be 
accompanied by 95% confidence intervals. Baseline comparisons between study arms (for each hypothesis) will be performed using t- tests for continuous variables, chi-squared tests for categorical variables, or  their 
nonparametric counterparts. Diagnostics (i.e., conditional studentized residuals, plots of outcomes over time) will be performed on each linear mixed model to assess whether necessary assumptions were met.  
To assess feasibility, the number of partic ipants approached each month, the proportion who enroll, the rate 
and timing of dropouts, the proportion of referring providers, and the number of study care manager contacts will be calculated. Additionally, Vets Prevail program usage data, including the proportion of participants in the 
intervention arm who become registered users, enroll in the cCBT program, and complete the entire cCBT 
program will be calculated; Vets Prevail data will be further aggregated to understand average/median duration 
of and n umber of completed cCBT sessions, community message board posts, and peer chats.  
To quantify acceptability, summary statistics (e.g., median/mean) for CSQ-I items scores will be computed. Under an health anthropologist’s  guidance, responses to the open -ended survey questions will be categorized as 
positive, neutral, negative, or ambivalent. Responses will be independently coded by [CONTACT_520606], resolving disagreements through discussion and examining positive and negative factors.
15 
To assess feasibility, acceptability, and other depression related outcome measures, generalized linear mixed 
model (GLMM) will be used, which provides a unified framework for the analysis of outcome trajectories over 
time by [CONTACT_520607]. GLMM is robust to imbalanced 
designs  and provides unbiased estimates even when data are missing at random. GLMM will be fit as a function 
of study arm, time, time-by -study arm, and gender . In addition, the intercept will be allowed to vary randomly to 
account for subject-level variability of the outcome at baseline. [standard errors will be adjusted to account for 
provider/clinic clustering.] Analyses will first be conducted on complete da ta only and will estimate the adjusted 
mean difference in 3-month  improvement on PHQ-9 (depression symptoms),  GAD -7 & PCL-5 (other mental 
health symptoms), PROMIS  (HRQoL) , and  BADS -SF/PAM -13 ( behavioral/ patient activation) between cCBT -
enhanced collaborative care and control arms. As an exploratory measure, w e will conduct additional analyses 
on study outcomes using predefined numbers of completed cCBT sessions (e.g., >2 sessions, all 5 sessions).  
Sample Size s and Power Analyses:  The primary purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_520595], 
including recruitment, intervention, and follow -up. Nevertheless, given the sample sizes we plan to enroll, the 
trial will have the power to detect  an effect size (ES) of 0.78 or greater ITT on the PHQ -9 of cCBT -enhanced 
collaborative care v ersus UC patients at 3-month follow -up. Data are  based on  Richards et al’s 2014 study ,10 
which reported a d=0.[ADDRESS_675286] -guided cCBT trials for improving depression outcomes, which is slightly 
higher than the reported ES (d=.56) for the Vets Prevail RCT. This is consistent with literature s howing that 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_520596].10 Assuming an 80% 3-month assessment completion rate 
(consistent with prior relevant studies)12-14and 2 -tailed type I error of 0.05, if 37 subjects  are enrolled to the 
intervention arm and 3 7 to the control arm ( 74 total) 80% power to detect at least a 0.78 ES impro vement of 
cCBT -enhanced collaborative care  over usual  care on the PHQ -9 (primary hypothesis) will be achieved. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_520597] : Improving Depression Management in Primary Care (CDA- 19-108)  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_520587] (1616118-5 Leung 07 -19-21)_clinicaltrials.gov_LL_ceb Page [ADDRESS_675287] changes in HRQoL. We lack  pre-existing data to estimate effects on behavioral/patient 
activation. It is underp owered to detect differences by [CONTACT_547]. Other analyses, e.g., access, is exploratory.

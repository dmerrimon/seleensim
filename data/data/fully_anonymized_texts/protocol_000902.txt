Adults age >70 who will start a new chemotherapy regimen  or other regimen with similar toxicity 
prevalence (see section 4.2.1c)  for an advanced  solid tumor malignancy  in the University of [COMPANY_002]ster 
Cancer Center NCI Community  Oncology Research Program  (URCC NCORP ) Research Base network  
will be eligible.  Chemotherapy will be defined as cytotoxic drugs;  in addition, agents (e.g., monoclonal 
antibodies  and targ eted agents ) that have a prevalence of grade 3 -5 toxicity in older patients similar to 
chemotherapy (>50%) will be allowed .  Oncology physician s who practice at sites within the URCC 
NCORP  Research Base network are participants in the study and will be enrolled .  Their e ligible patients 
will then undergo the informed consent process; those patients who agree to participate in this study will 
undergo a clinical assessment consisting of demographic char acteristics and geriatric assessment (GA) .  
All baseli ne assessments will be performed  prior to initiation of the new treatment regimen.    
NCORP  practice sites with IRB approval of the protocol  will be randomized to receipt of GA plus GA-
driven recommendati ons (Arm 1) or usual ca re (Arm 2) .  A NCORP  practice site will be defined as any 
practice location within an overarching NCORP  designation where oncology physicians and study staff 
work independently (e.g., do not cross over into another site).  In Arm 1, oncology physician s or their 
designees will be provided with GA summary  plus targeted recommendations  (i.e., GA -driven 
recommendations) . GA-driven recommendations and the uptake  of these recommendations along with the 
influence of  the GA on decisions will be c ollect ed.  In Arm 2, pa rticipant s will c omplete  the GA; but no 
GA summary or GA -driven recommendations will be provided to the oncology teams  except for 
information regarding clinically significant cognitive impairment and/or depression. In both arms, 
participant s will subsequently receive  a treatment  plan as prescribed by [CONTACT_96546] .  
Drugs and doses (throughout the entire course) will be recorded, as well as supportive care medications.  
NCI clinician -rated and patient -reported CTCAE grade 2-5 toxicities will be captured .  In addition, dose 
delays, dose reductions, discontinuation of treatment, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and survival status will be 
captured, as well as the relationship of  these events to toxicity.  A brief follow -up GA will be collected at 
4-6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after baseline registration. Survival will be captured for 1 year after
study entry .
A total of 7 00 participant s will be enrolled in this study . The acronym for this study is GAP70+, which 
stands for Geriatric Assessment for Patients 70+: A  Bridge to Reduce Toxicities.  Cluster Randomized Trial

9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) [ADDRESS_106555] a cluster randomized study evaluating whether 
providing a GA summary with targeted recommendations (i.e., GA -driven recommendations) can lower 
toxicity  in older adults receiv ing chemotherapy  or other agents  (e.g., monoclonal antibodies, targeted 
agents) with similar toxicity prevalence  for advanced  solid tumor malignancies .  Clinical outcomes will 
be captured including toxicity (both clinician and patient -reported), other adverse outcomes (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], mortality), and changes in functional and physical performance.  
1.2. Background and Significance  
Although cancer is a disease of aging, older patients are underrepresented in clinical trials.1,[ADDRESS_106556] been found to be more 
susceptible to toxicity from other types of treatment (e.g., monoclonal antibodies and targeted agents) and 
some of these ne wer agents have similar prevalence of toxicity in older patients to chemotherapy .117-[ADDRESS_106557]  trial that led to approval of 
regorafenib in previously treated mCRC had a median age of 61. The small number of older 
participant s (38 participants  ≥ 75 years of a total n=503) in this study had a disproportionately higher 
risk of any ≥ grade 3 toxicitie s (66% for ≥ 75 years vs. 52% for < 65 years).120 
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has stated that to improve quality of care, oncology 
physicians  and patients should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of cancer -directed therapy for 
patients with a low performance status, who are not eligible for a clinical trial, and for whom there is no 
strong evidence supporting the clinical value of treatment.[ADDRESS_106558] older ad ults.  
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines advocate GA for older patients with 
cancer to identify health status issues that increase the risk of adverse outcomes.9-[ADDRESS_106559] of care in oncology has been slow due to lack of resources, difficulties with interpreting results, 
and difficulties with implementing targeted interventions.12,20,21 Innovative and pragmatic 
interdisciplinary approaches to reduce risk of treatment in older cancer patients are imperative.  This 
research supports the NIH commitment to trans -NIH strategic initiatives for the development of 
interdisciplinary rese arch teams to address problems facing an aging nation.22 
The overarching goal of this proposal is to evalua te whether providing the oncology team with 
information from the GA plus GA-driven  recommendations  can improve outcomes in older adults with  
advanced  cancer .  This proposal addresses the main objective of the U13 conference, “Geriatric Oncology 
Research to Improve Clinical Care,” which is to develop innovative mechanisms to improve the clinical 
care of older cancer patients within the next 10 years.3,4  The GA has g reat potential to identify areas of 
vulnerability and develop recommendations  that could help improve outcomes (e.g., treatment toxicity) in 
older cancer patients.14,15,23  The PI , in collaboration with Cancer and Aging Research Group ( CARG ) 
investigators , has found that older cancer patients have a high prevalence of characteristics that are [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) 26 5 associated with a greater risk o f chemotherapy toxicity.24,25  This research is significant because:  1) a 
large and growing population of older cancer patients would benefit from the results; 2) GA information 
can identify risk factors for chemotherapy toxicity in older cancer patients; however, these questions are 
not routinely incorporated into the oncology clinical evaluation; and 3) a critical operational question 
exists: would provision of GA information along with GA -driven recommendations  to the oncology 
treatment team improve outcomes in older patients with advanced  cancer?  Successful completion of the 
aims of this proposal will provide an innovative, pragmatic approach that could improve clinical care.   
1.3. Condition to be Studied  
A growing population of old er patients is at 
high risk for adverse outcomes f rom cancer 
treatment.  Cancer is a disease of aging; 
approximately 60% of all cancers and 70% 
of cancer mortality occur in persons aged 
65 years and over.26  The number of cancer 
patients over the age of 65 is projected to 
significantly increase over the next 20 
years (see Figure 1).[ADDRESS_106560] the ability to tolerate cancer therapy.5,32-34  
1.4. Geriatric Assessment (GA)  
GA can identify risk factors for adverse outcomes in older cancer patients.   Comprehensive GA includes a 
compi[INVESTIGATOR_96522], validated tools to assess geriatric domains such as comorbidity, functional status, 
physical performance, cognitive status, psyc hological status, nutritional status, medication review, and 
social support.15,35-[ADDRESS_106561] cancer treatment in more than 
50% of older patients.[ADDRESS_106562] oncology 
performance measures such as the Karnofsky score, a one -item measure of function, which was validated 
in younger patients.  The GA has great potential to identify areas of vulnerability and interventions that 
could help improve outcomes (e.g., reducing treatment toxicity) in older cancer patients.14,15,23  Notably, 
the primary investigator (PI) of this study, [CONTACT_96598], in collaboration with  CARG investigators, 
has demonstrated that older cancer patients have a high prevalence of characteristics that are associated 
with a greater risk of chemotherapy toxicity, and the GA can help identify these risk factors.   Our 
research team has found the GA  in this study was feasible in oncology clinics and trials.5,12,23  
1.5 Geriatric Assessment  Components and Relevance to  the Older Patients with Cancer.    
Currently, oncology physicians assess functional status by [CONTACT_20526] a Karnofsky performance status 
score (KPS) or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status.57,58  These generic 
scales are applied to all adult cancer patients, regardless of age, and are used to estimate functional status Figure 1:   Increase in older patients with cancer  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) [ADDRESS_106563] largely excluded elderly patients.  A prospective study of 500 older adults 
with cancer demonstrated that KPS could not identify older adults at risk for chemotherapy toxicity, while 
a predictive model including GA questions could identify such individuals.5  The geriatrician’s evaluation 
provides valuable information not provided by [CONTACT_96547];14,16,61,62 however, GA 
is not commonly taught in oncology training or utilized in oncology practice . A description of each GA 
domain and its relevance to the older patient with cancer is provided below.  
1.5.1. Functional Status and Physical Performance.   The need for functional assistance (measured 
by [CONTACT_96548]) is predictive of chemotherapy toxicity and 
survival.63-66  Physical performance measures objectively evaluate mobility and fall risk.43,53  Falls are 
common in older cancer patients and predictive of adverse outcomes.5,25,67 
1.5.2. Comorbidity and Polypharmacy .  Among patients with cancer, comorbidity is associated 
with poorer overall survival.68-72  Comorbidity impacts cancer treatment tolerance.73-76  Furthermore, 
these comorbid conditions may predispose patients to the risks of polypharmacy and drug 
interactions.77 
1.5.3.  Nutrition.   Poor nutritional status is associated with an increased need for functional 
assistance and poorer overall survival in the geriatric population.78  Unintentional weight loss during 
the six months prior to chemotherapy is associated with lower che motherapy response rates and lower 
overall survival.79  
1.5.4.  Cognition .  A cognitive assessment is needed to determine if the patient has the decisional 
capacity to consent and adhere to supportive care medication instructions and understand the 
indications to seek attention. In the presence of cognitive impairment, the involvement of the patient’s 
family or caregiver is required to maintain saf ety.80-83 
1.5.5. Psychological State and Social Suppor t. In a study of older adults with cancer, significant 
distress  was identified in 41% of older adults, and poorer physical function correlated with higher 
distress.[ADDRESS_106564] serious consequences.87  For 
example, Hurria et al. revealed that although 5% of patients screened positively for severe cognitive 
impairment on GA, these patients were still consented ont o a therapeutic protocol.[ADDRESS_106565] been developed through preliminary work, extensive review of the evidence, and clinical 
expertise of the geriatric oncology physicians on the research team.  Our research team has found that the 
GA in t his study was feasible in oncology clinics and trials.5,12,23  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) [ADDRESS_106566] shown that the implementation of GA and GA -driven recommendations  
into the clinical care of older patients with cancer is feasible.12,21,56,89  The ELCAPA (elderly cancer 
patien t) study illustrated that providing GA information and GA -driven  recommendations  to oncology 
teams can influence treatment decisions, although outcomes from these changes were not measured in this 
study.[ADDRESS_106567] survival advantage (67% 
in the intervention group compared with 40% in the control group).  In a study by [CONTACT_96549]., breast 
cancer pa tients in the GA -driven recommendations  group were significantly more likely to return to 
normal functioning than the controls.92  Different approaches for treatment  selection and dosing for older 
and/or frail patients is supported by [CONTACT_96550] -driven 
recommendations (see Preliminary Data).  The FOCUS -2 trial found that chemotherapy for advanced 
colorectal cancer was safe and efficacious in the older and/or frail patient if started at a 20% dose 
reduction with escalation as tolerated.[ADDRESS_106568] experience in the study of deci sion-making in oncology.  
1.8.1. Prevalence of Health Status Issues in 
Older Patients with Cancer.  Using a 
nationally representative population -based 
database, Mohile and collaborators (Dale and 
Morrow) published two investigations  that 
demonstrated that disability, comorbidity, 
and geri atric syndromes (including falls) are 
more common in cancer patients and that 
cancer was independently associated with 
having these conditions (Figure 2).24,[ADDRESS_106569] been detected 
on routine history and physical exam:  41% 
of patients needed assistance with  instrumental activities of daily living despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a mean physician -
reported KPS of 85, 16% had recent falls, and 6% had gross cognitive impairment on the cognitive 
screening test.

9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) 26 8 1.8.2. Developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Geriatric Assessment for Older Adults with Cancer.12  The geriatri c and 
oncology literature was reviewed to choose validated GA measures.  Selection criteria included 
reliability, validity, brevity, the ability to self -administer, and the ability to prognosticate risk for 
morbidity or mortality in an older patient.12  The final selection of measures was approved by [CONTACT_96551] B (CALGB) Cancer in the Elderly and Quality of Life Committees .  The 
initial feasibility study of this tool was conducted in a multicenter study by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Hurria and [CONTACT_96599].  Forty patients (mean age 74, range 65 to 87) with cancer participated in the study.   The GA 
was feasible, as demonstrated by a mean time to completi on of 27 minutes, 90% of pa rticipant s were 
satisfied with the questionnaire length, and 78% were able to complete on their own.12  
1.8.3. Feasibility of Geriatric Assessment Tool in Oncology Clinical Trials.23  CALGB 360401 
evaluated the feasibility of incorporating the GA into oncology cooperative group trials for older 
adults who had signed conse nt for a cooperative group treatment trial.   Ninety -three patients enrolled 
in this study.   The median time to complete the assessment was 22 minutes, 88% of pa rticipant s 
completed the pa rticipa nt portion without assistance, 88% were satisfied with the assessment length, 
and 95% said the assessment was easy to comprehend.  The GA for cancer patients met the protocol 
specified feasibility criteria for use in the cooperative group setting.   
1.8.4.  Can the Geriatric Assessment Predict Chemotherapy Toxicity?5  The primary objective of 
this study was to determine if GA measures predicted grade 3 -5 toxicity using the NCI Toxicity 
Index, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, V3.0).  This study’s eligibility 
was the same for the current proposed stu dy:  an older patient was enrolled prior to the start of a new 
chemotherapy regimen.  Among the 500 enrollees, the mean age was 73 years (range 65 -91).  The 
most common tumor types were lung (29%), GI (29%) and breast/gynecologic (22%) cancers; 61% 
had met astatic disease and 71% received 1st line chemotherapy.  Grade 3 -5 toxicity occurred in 53% 
(50% grade 3, 12% grade 4, 2% grade 5). Risk factors for grade 3 -5 toxicity included: 1) age ≥ 73, 2) 
cancer type (GI or GU), 3) standard dose, 4) poly -chemotherapy , 5) falls in last 6 months, 6) 
assistance with instrumental activities of daily living, and 7) decreased social activity.  In the 
published CARG study, 307 of 500 pa rticipant s had advanced  cancer and of these, 141 (46%) 
experienced grade 3, 4, or 5 toxici ty within 3 months.5 Seventy percent of the toxicities were non-
hematologic (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, etc.).  
1.8.5. GA-driven interventions can influence oncology care and improve chemotherapy toxicity.  
[CONTACT_96600] directs a referral -based consultative geriatric oncology clinic which has collected pi[INVESTIGATOR_96523]-driven interventions in over 200 pa rticipan ts.94  Mean age was 82.1 (65 -95) and 75% had  
advanced disease.  GA revealed 68% with functional impairment, 70% had >3 significant 
comorbidities, 39% had poor nutrition,95 26% screened positive for depression,96 59% reported 
inadequate social support, 20% had an abnormal cognition screen,97 34% had recently fallen, and 
60% had poor physical performance.37,[ADDRESS_106570]. Mohile’s research team prospectively ev aluated the 
grade 3 -5 toxicity rate of 100 consecutive pa rticipant s that underwent GA and GA -driven 
recommendations .  These pa rticipant s were older (mean age 80, 70 -91), but had similar cancer 
characteristics to the published observational cohort.5   Grade 3 -4 toxicities occurred in 33 of 100 
participant s within 3 month s of chemotherapy initiation.  No pa rticipan ts developed grade 5 
toxicities.  This is lower than the rate reported in the CARG study of patients whose physicians did 
not receive GA results and did not implement GA -driven recommendation s.5  On average, 80% of the 
recommended GA -driven recommendations  were implemented with an average of 6 recommendations  
per pa rticipa nt (range 3 -15).  At the annual URCC Research Base  meeting in September of [ADDRESS_106571] in the current proposal and >90% stated that they have the resources 
necessary to follow through with GA -driven recommendations  (e.g., availability of 
PT/OT/Nutrition/Social work).  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) [ADDRESS_106572]. Epstein’s NCI -funded RO1 (PI [CONTACT_832] a co -investigator) have 
been ad apted for patients with advanced cancer.101,[ADDRESS_106573] approach to implementing interventions to reduce 
toxicity.  Common assessment instruments in oncology (e.g., Karnofsky performance status scores) do 
not add ress critical geriatric domains that predict morbidity and mortality in the older patients (e.g., 
functional status, comorbidity, social support).  A geriatric assessment (GA) includes a compi[INVESTIGATOR_96524], validated tools to assess health status.   Several studies, including a multicenter Cancer and Aging 
Research Group (CARG) trial, have demonstrated that items in a GA can predict severe chemotherapy 
toxicities in older cancer patients.[ADDRESS_106574] the potential to preve nt adverse outcomes (e.g., toxicity, 
functional decline, lower quality of life) for older cancer patients.  The vast majority of oncology 
physician s have not adopted the use of GA and GA -driven recommendations  for older adults with cancer, 
largely because of lack of knowledge on how to interpret GA results and on whether GA -driven  
recommendations  can improve clinical outcomes .   
1.10 . Study Participants  
The study involves adult human subjects. 
NCORP p ractice sites will be randomized within a  2-arm cluster ra ndomized design  utilizing NCORP  
practice site s as the unit of randomization.  A NCORP  practice site will be defined as any practice 
location within an overarching NCORP  designation where oncology physicians and study staff work 
independently ( i.e., do not cross over into another site).  
Study participants  will include:  
•Oncology physician s at NCORP  practice  sites. Oncology physicians can work with designated staff in
the clinic  to carry through specific study procedures outlined in the protocol, but staff are not considered
study participant s and will not be enrolled.
•Participant s will complete surveys .  Participant s will all have advanced cancer and various levels of
funct ional status.
2.STUDY OBJECTIVE S
This is a cluster random ized study within  the URCC NCORP Research Base network evaluating whether [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) 26 10 GA summary  plus GA-driven  recommendations  can improve clinical outcomes in older adults starting  a 
new treatment  regimen  (i.e., chemotherapy or other agents with similar prevalence of toxicity)  for the 
current diagnosis of an advanced  solid tumor malignanc y (advanced cancer) .   
2.1. Primary Aim 
Our primary aim is to determine if providing information regarding GA plus GA-driven recommendations  
to oncology physician s reduces clinician -rated grade [ADDRESS_106575]  similar prevalence of toxicity  (see section 4.2.1c).    
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the proportion of pa rticipant s that experience grade 3 -5 
toxicity within 3 months of starting a new treatment regimen.  
2.2. Seconda ry Aim s 
2.2.1.  The principal secondary endpoint for this study is the proportion of pa rticipan ts that are alive  at 
6 months after study entry.  
2.2.2.  Additional efficacy measures will evaluate whether providing oncology physicians  with 
information regarding GA  summary  and GA -driven recommendations  influences clinical care of 
older patients receiving treatment  for advanced  cancer.  
We will c ompare treatment decisions (as measured by  [CONTACT_96552] s 
administered in the first cycle) .  We will also  compare the number and type of GA-driven 
recommendation s implemented for older pa rticipant s starting a  new treatment  regimen for advanced  
cancer .  
2.3. Exploratory Aim s 
2.3.1.  An exploratory aim is to determine whether providing the oncology team  with GA information 
and GA -driven recommendations  can slow functional and physical decline in older patients with 
advanced  cancer.    
Functional status will be measured with self -reported Instrumental Activities of Daily Living score.  
Physical performance  will be measured with the OARS Physical Health Subscale , and the  Short 
Physical Performance Battery .  
2.3.2.  In collaboration with the National Cancer Institute, other exploratory aims will evaluate the 
role of patient -reported CT CAE in the clinical care of older adults receiving c ancer treatment .  These 
aims include the following:  
2.3.2a.  To examine the association between patient -reported symptoms (as measured by [CONTACT_96553] -
CTCA E) and geriatric domains (as measured by [CONTACT_96554]) .  
2.3.2b.  To compare PRO -CTCAE and physician -rated CTCA E in a sample of older patients 
receiving chemotherapy  or other agents with similar prevalence of toxicity . 
2.3.2c.  To examine the association between PRO -CTCA E and treatment  decisions . 
2.3.2d.  To examine the association between PRO -CTCA E and adverse ou tcomes (early 
discontinuation of chemotherapy  or other agents with similar prevalence of toxicity , 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and mortality) . [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

communication and outcomes.  Usual care was the comparator arm in these cluster randomized trials .104 
3.2. Choice of Study Design  
The study is designed as a cluster randomized trial because a care of service model is applied to eac h 
participan t by [CONTACT_54263].  If a cluster randomized design were not undertaken, there would be 
contamination in that oncology physicians  could choose the care o f service model if they were exposed to 
participant s randomized to both arms.  Given ra pid changes that can occur in oncology practice with new 
supportive care and treatment agents, it is important to compare outcomes in the same time frame as 
would be possible in a cluster randomized study design compared to a “pre” versus “post” interventi on 
study design.  
4.PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY
4.1. Entry Criteria for Oncology Physician s 
Oncology physicians must work at a NCORP practice site with no plans to leave that NCORP 
practice site or retire at the time of enrollment into the study.  
4.2. Entry Criteria for  Patients  
4.2.1.  Inclusion Criteria for Patients  
4.2.1a.  Male or female 70 years of age or older . 
4.2.1b . Diagnosis of an advanced solid tumor malignancy  (advanced cancer)  or lymphoma.  In 
most situations, this would be a stage IV cancer.  Patients with a diagnosis of stage III cancer  or 
lymphoma are  eligible if cure is not possible or anticipated.   Clinical staging without pathological 
confirmation  of advanced disease  is allowed.  
4.2.1c . Plan to start a new c ancer treatment  regimen within [ADDRESS_106577] similar prevalence of 
toxicity.     
Patients who will receive monoclonal antibody therapy or other cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g., 
tyrosine kinase  inhibitors) are eligible  if the other agents  present a prevalence of toxicity 
similar to chemotherapy .  These therapi[INVESTIGATOR_96525] c hemotherapy, as 
a single agent, or in combination with each other.    
*Chemotherapy will be defined as cytotoxic drugs; in addition, agents (e.g., monoclonal
antibodies and targeted agents )  that have a prevalence of grade 3 -5 toxicity in older patients
similar to chemotherapy (>50%) will be allowed . A list of allowable agents (single and in[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) 26 12 combination) meeting this toxicity criteria will be available on the URCC NCORP Research Base 
website as part of the study materials.  Given the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_96526], the study team led by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_96527].   If the potentially el igible participant  is to receiv e an approved drug 
or regimen  not on the list, contact[CONTACT_96555] .    
Patients who are receiving approved cancer treatment  in combination with radiation are 
eligible.   
A patient may also be enrolle d on a treatment trial and participate in this study, if all other 
inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.   
4.2.1d.  Plan to be on chemotherapy  or other allowable treatment (as per 4.2.1c)  for at least 3 
months  (minimum 70  days) and be willing to come in for study visits . 
The plan for treatment should be for at least 3 months  at time of study enrollment.  T he treatment 
can stop earlier during the study at the discretion of the physician and p atient (e.g., due to 
progression as noted through imaging , toxicity, or patient preference).  
4.2.[ADDRESS_106578] decision -making capacity, a patient -designated health care proxy  (or authorized 
representative per institutional policies)  must sign consent  by [CONTACT_23760] .  If the pa rticipant  
is found to be impaired on the Blessed -Orientation M emory Concentration Test (BOMC) during 
screening; they must have a health care proxy or authorized representative to be eligible to enroll.  
4.2.[ADDRESS_106579] previously received 
surgery are eligible . 
4.2.2b . Presence of symptomatic brain metastases at time of study consent process .  Patients with 
history of treated brain metastases are eligible if they are not symptomatic at the time of study 
enrollment.  
5.IDENTIFICATION, RECR UITMENT, AND CONSENT PR OCEDURES
Patients will be recruited from the outpatient community oncology practices affiliated with  the URCC  
NCORP  Research Base network .  The results of this study will be generalizable to the majority of older 
adults with cancer because it will include older cancer patients from diverse backgrounds and at varying 
health statuses who receive treatment in the community.  
5.1. Study Participants  
Study participants will be identified by [CONTACT_96556] s, who enroll in the study, the 
nurses that work with the enrolled oncology physician s and the clinical research associate s (CRA).  The [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) 26 13 CRA s will work closely with the oncology physician s and nurses to identify those patients aged 70 and 
over with advanced cancer that are to begin  a new cancer treatment  regimen  (see section 4.2.1c) .  The 
oncology physician then confirms if the patient is an eligible study candidate for all requi rements other 
than GA impairment by [CONTACT_96557] .  The oncology 
physician  or CRA will introduce the study to the eligible patients and/or their designated health care 
proxies  or authorized representatives (per institutional policies) , and will provide them with an IRB 
approved study brochure and consent to review .  Adequate time will be provided to the patient and/or 
designated representative  to read the consent.  The CRA , the oncolog y physician,  and the nurses are 
available to answer any questions the patient and/or authorized representative  may have about any aspect 
of the study prior to consenting and throughout the entire study period.  Patients and/or their designated 
authorized representative  may choose to sign the informed consent document immediately on the day the 
study information is presented to them or they may choose to take the consent form home and discuss it 
with others ; then if they want to participate in the study, they can provide signed consent forms the next 
time they meet with the CRA or oncology physician.  Patients and/or their designated  authorized  
representatives  must sign consent prior to the oncology physician  initiating the new c ancer treatment  
regimen.  
5.1.1.  Informed consent will be obtained from the patient, unless they lack capacity to provide 
consent.  If a patient lacks capacity, a health care proxy  and/or authorized representative  will be 
required to sign consent per institutio nal and/or local policies on consent for 
incapacitated/decisionally impaired patient s.  If the patient does not have an appointed health care 
proxy  or authorized representative  (per institutional policies) on or before the baseline visit , he/she 
will not be enrolled onto the study.  All consent documents will be signed by [CONTACT_5363]/or 
designated health care proxy /authorized representative  and maintained in the patient record with 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_96528]/or designated health care proxy /authorized representative .  
5.1.2.  The screening measures will then be performed.   Those with a diagnosis of dementia , as noted 
in their medical record or diagnosed by  a physician,  or who meet the cut -off score for impairment on 
the cognitive scree n (score of 11 or more on Blessed Orientation -Memory -Concentration Scale  
(BOMC) ) can be included if a designated health care proxy (or authorized representative per 
institutional policies) selected by [CONTACT_96558].  The goal of the intervention is to 
improve outcomes of older cancer patients with all underlying health conditions including cognitive 
issues.  Therefore we will include these patients and will conduct the assessments with assistance of 
the proxy.  
5.1.3. Ethical standards for human subjects will be strictly followed in accordance with local policies 
and/or institutional review board requirements on the enrollment of adult decisionally incapacitated 
research participants  and permission of authorized represe ntatives  (e.g., health care proxy) . If the 
policy in 5.1.2 (as approved by [CONTACT_96559]) violates local policies, the URCC NCORP 
Research Base should be notified if patients with cognitive impairment are not able to be enrolled by 
[CONTACT_779].    
5.1.4.  Current, state, federal, and institutional regulations concerning informed consent will be 
followed.  Participation in this study is voluntary.  Participants are free not to take part or to withdraw 
at any time, for whatever reason, without risking loss of pr esent or future care they would otherwise 
expect to receive.   Section s 11.4.1c and [ADDRESS_106580] any suc h correspondence to the URCC  
Research Base . [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) 26 14 5.2. Oncology Physician  Recruitment  
Because  oncology physician s are being recruited and enrolled from sites across the country  by [CONTACT_96560] , oncology physician s will read and agree to participate  either via Research Electronic Data 
Capture ( REDCap ) or on paper if REDCap is not a feasible option.   REDCap is a software toolset (see 
Section 16.3 for more information)  for electronic collection and management of research and clinical trial 
data developed by [CONTACT_50222].  Oncology physician s wil l be enrolled  prior to enrolling 
(screening registration) their first eligible patient.  Staff from the UR CC Research Base (including the PI) 
will be available to answer any questions the oncology physician s may have over the phone.  Procedures 
for the oncology physician s are minimal risk and involve  completing surveys which will be de -identified 
and identifying patients for the study.  
Oncology physician s will  provide baseline demographic information, fill out a baseline survey that 
evaluate s preference s for decision -making, and help identify their own patients who may be eligi ble for 
the study.  The baseline survey can be completed online via  REDCap or on paper if REDCap  is not 
feasible.  REDCap will securely store the oncology physician ’s email address for su rveys.  In addition to 
the email address, the only personal identifying information the oncology physician s will provide will be 
their name, age, ethnicity, and the name [CONTACT_96596].  The oncology physician  will be 
assigned a n ID number, which will be used to link the ir surveys with those of the ir patients enrolled in the 
study.   
The participation of oncology physician s in the research study meets criteria for “waiver of 
documentation of consent” because the  research involves  no more than minimal risk to the oncology 
physician s and there are no procedures for the oncology physician s that would normally require written 
consent outside of the research context.  Therefore URCC Research Base is responsible for  tracking and 
collecti ng physician agreement to participate in the study. Hence, t he NCORP site  staff do not need to 
consent their participating  Physician.

7.OUTCOMES
7.1.  Clinical Outcomes  
7.1.1.  Toxicity .  Toxicity will be captured in a standardized manner using the NCI Common 
Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (V4.0).  The NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE; http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html) is a longstanding empi[INVESTIGATOR_96529] “dictionary” or lexicon, designed for use in clinical trials to aid clinicians in detecting and 
documenting an array of adverse events (AEs) commonly encountered in oncology.  An AE is any 
unfavorable sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medical treatment or intervention that may or may not be considered 
related to the medical treatment or intervention under investigation.   The AE may be either 
unexpected or expected.  
An AE is a term that is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical documentation 
and scientific analyses o f treatment efficacy and tolerability.  Each AE is typi[INVESTIGATOR_96530] a scale 
of 1 (mild) to 5 (death related to AE), though a grade [ADDRESS_106582] is the protocol -specific AEs to be addressed at designated evaluation 
intervals. The second is the pertinent positive clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory results 
obtained as part of routine ca re of patients.  The CTCAE is maintained by [CONTACT_6812]’s Cancer Therapy 
Evaluation Program (CTEP).  The CTCAE is currently in its fourth version.  
Ideally, t he CRA  will be present at each scheduled visit where toxicities are captured and graded  by 
[CONTACT_96562].   In the event that the CRA is unable to be present at the visit, s/he will need to 
follow -up with the oncology team  to verify  the toxicities.  Treatment dosing administration as well as 
grade [ADDRESS_106583] 3 months. Grade 2 -5 treatment toxicities  and 
treatment dosing administration will be captured between 3 -6 months only for those pa rticipant s who 
remain on  any of the same treatment drugs  that they were receiving at study initiation  (including for 
those who treatment dosing was modified or delayed).    
Per participant , the CRA will complete the forms capturing dosing administration and grade  2-[ADDRESS_106584] forms or electronically through REDCap.  REDCap (see se ction 16.3) will capture 
exactly the same information as the forms and will be available as a data entry option for capture of 
treatment and toxicity information.   
The medical record will also be reviewed in order to capture each clinical encounter (sche duled or 
emergency visits).   This will include a review of the clinic notes, emergency room visits, and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) 26 17 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]  (i.e., emergency room and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96531]) .  If the p articipan t 
seeks emergency care outside of the primary institu tion, the pa rticipan t’s permission will be obtained 
to review these outside records.  Details regarding the overall category of toxicity (hematologic or 
non-hematologic), specific type of toxicity, and the rationale for the toxicity grade will be captured.  
Dose reductions, dose delays or discontinuation of the treatment  course will also be  captured, as well 
as the cause (i.e. relationship to toxicity).    
7.1.2.   Cancer Treatment Decisions .  The NCCN guidelines105 will be utilized to capture the 
standard  dosing of treatment  regimens.   The planned regimen (individual drugs, doses, and schedule) 
will be captured at the beginning of the study from the primary oncology team.  The cumulative 
dosages per unit time of the individual drugs in the regimen will be calculated: (total mg  of drug in all 
cycles/m2 body surface area)/(total days of therapy/7).  The denominator is based on total days on 
treatment (from day [ADDRESS_106585] treatment), reflecting 
all dose delays.  The relative dose  intensity ( RDI) is calculated as the ratio of the amount actually 
delivered to the amount intended based on standard guidelines.  The actual dose delivered (in the 
numerator of RDI) will account for  dose reductions.  The RDI is calculated for each drug i n a 
multidrug regimen, which are averaged to derive the average RDI.  The doses will be collected in the 
forms completed by [CONTACT_96563].  All calculations will be performed at the Research Base.   
7.1.3.  Survival .  We will capture survival through  the pa rticipan t’s medical record and verification 
with the primary team.  We will follow pa rticipan ts for survival for 12 months after enrollment.  We 
will obtain the date, location of death, and cause of death. If a site becomes aware that a study 
participant is now deceased , they should complete  the S urvival  Status  form  which is  available on the 
URCC NCORP website . Otherwise sites will be contact[CONTACT_41576] 1 year after each pa rticipan t 
was enrolled to assess survival and asked to complete this  form . We will also verify information  with 
Medicare claims data if the pa rticipan t provided permission to do this through initial consent (see 
Section 7.2.3).  
7.2. Data Sources  
7.2.1.  Participant  Surveys.  Participan ts will complete surveys  prior to the start of treatment  and at 
4-[ADDRESS_106586] been utilized in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_96532] -related health conditions.  In a recent study, 98% of
patients with non -small cell lung cancer with a median survival of 9 months completed a baseline
battery similar in length, and 70% and 64% of those who were still alive were able to complete
assessments at 3 and 6 months, respectively.106,107  As is often true for patients with advanced disease,
missing data were not random; sicker patients tended not to complete surveys. We have included
approaches to missing data  in section 11.4.1c. and  in the statistical section of the protocol.  Non-
completio n of surveys due to illness or fatigue should not be considered a patient withdrawal.  Every
effort should be made to collect p articipan t survey information in person and objective GA
information.   If survey and GA information cannot be collected (due to participa nt illness and
fatigue), CRA forms regarding treatment and toxicity information  should still be completed at the
appropriate time points.    In addition, clinic notes, treatment records, and emergency
room/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96533].   Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96534].
7.2.2.  Oncology P hysician  Surveys .  Oncology physician s will complete a baseline survey prior to 
or when their first patient consents to the study  and a brief follow -up survey  at the end of the study .  
After  the baseline  visit, oncology physician s will be asked about potentially important covariates or 
moderators, including disease and treatment characteristics.   They will also complete a b rief survey 
about decision -making after each follow -up visit.  When an oncology physician’s study participation [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) 26 18 is near completion (e.g. , all their study participants  are off study, the y are moving or leaving the  
practice) the oncology physician will comple te the Final Physician Survey  found on the NCORP 
website  with a separate version  for the control and the  intervention sites . 
7.2.3 . Chart Abstraction  and Claims .  Clinic notes, treatment records, and emergency 
room/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96535].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96536] e care.   If there is missing information or conflicting medical information from the surveys, we 
will obtain additional medical records in order to verify  information about disease location, 
pathology, stage, and metastases from c harts. We will request inf ormation from the CRA on the final 
treatment recommendations made and implemented.  In order to assess health care utilization (e.g., 
adverse events such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602])  for future work on examining cost -effectiveness of the 
intervention , permission to  obtain Medicare claims in the future will be asked on the consent form.  
Claims will not be obtained for any individual participant  until the pa rticipan t is off  study.  Claims 
information will be collected for all pa rticipant s that agreed per the consent, including those who have 
completed  the study  or have withdrawn from the study. All consent and research procedures for 
obtaining Medicare claims will be followed:  http://www.cms.gov/Research -Statistics -Data -and-
Systems/Computer -Data -and-Systems/Privacy/Researchers.html  
Permission to obtain claims is voluntary.  Patients will be able to decline this procedure at the time of 
consent.  D eclining consent for obtaining claims from Medicare for future research to examine cost -
effectiveness, quality of care, and health care utilization  does not preclude patients from participating 
in the rest of the study.  
8. MEASURES TO BE COLLECTED
An overview of measures is provided here.  A detailed description of e ach measure including a summary   
table is provided in Appendix A. 
We have pi[INVESTIGATOR_96537].  In total, geriatric assessment measures that are filled out by [CONTACT_96564] t 
require approximately 20 minutes of time.  The additional measures ( e.g., PRO -CTCAE ) captured at 
baseline  require an additional [ADDRESS_106587] geriatric assessment in  clinic at time of consen t or in clinic before the 
next visit  with the oncology physician .  They may choose to complete measures at home in b etween 
visits.  T he geriatric oncology clinic at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster routinely captures these measures as 
part of clinical care.  Table 1: Participant and CRA Measures:

(including physical performance and cognitive tests).  Any person at the practice site can be trained by 
[CONTACT_96567].  The GA does not need to be performed by [CONTACT_96568] . 
The oncology physician  assessments will be done either on paper or through REDCap , whichever the 
oncology physician  prefers.  The baseline and end of study assessments take no longer than 10 minutes 
and after the initial  participa nt visit, the decision -making form (to assess factors that influen ced decisions) 
takes only a few minutes to complete . 
Components of Geriatric Assessment  (Participant ) 
Assessment tools comprising the comprehensive GA are listed in Table 2.  The various assessment tools 
were selected based upon extensive data in the geriatric literature demonstrating predictive value as well 
as feasibility data in multiple studies of elderly patients with cancer.  Other than the cognitive and 
physical performance measures, the assessments are self -administered.  Participan ts who cannot complete 
the assessment on their own will receive assistance from study personnel  or a caregiver .  The GA is  
performed  before baseline registration .  Follow -up GA measures are collected  at 4-6 weeks, 3 months, 
and 6 months .   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

other symptoms, such as fatigue, erectile dysfunction, and xerostomia (dry mouth), which can be 
found in  the CTCAE.  The other advantages of a PRO complement to the CTCAE are discussed in an 
article by [CONTACT_96569].109  
The NCI’s Patient -Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (PRO -CTCAE) system provides a platform to collect patient reports of symptoms they are 
experiencing while undergoing treatment, for the purpose of enhancing a dverse event (AE) reporting 
http://outcomes.cancer.gov/tools/pro -ctcae.html ).  To date, 81 symptoms of the CTCAE (version 4) 
have been identified as amenable to patient reporting. These sympto ms have been converted to patient 
terms (e.g., CTCAE term “myalgia” converted to “aching muscles”).  
For purposes of this project, core items will be assessed along with items related to geriatric 
functioning.  Participan ts will complete these surveys at baseline, 4 -6 week, 3 month, and 6 month 
time points.  
8.3 Decision -Making Assessments (Pa rticipant  and Oncology Physician ) 
8.3.1. Participant  Assessments . We will collect measures to assess the processes of decision -making 
for treatment.  The measures chosen  for this study are validated tools designed to measure how 
participa nts’ approach the decision -making process.  Validated tools will measure patient -centered 
autonomy -supportive oncology physician  behaviors such as whether the participant  feels that the 
oncology physician  understands his/her perspective, and provides choices and options.   
8.3.2. Oncology P hysician  Assessments .  We will collect information on demographics and 
decision -making preferences.  Oncology p hysicians will be presented with a clinical scenario of 
elderly cancer patients with a variety of geriatric -related impairments (i.e. , physical frailty, cognitive 
impairment).  A series of questions will follow each vignette inquiring about the likelihood of the 
oncology physician  to offer chemotherapy in the scenario .  After the study is over, physicians will be 
asked to complete a brief follow -up survey. After the  baseline  clinical encounter, oncology physician s 
will complete a short (<10 question) survey follow -up requesting information on the treatment plan 
for the pa rticipan t and factors that influenced how the decision was made.   
9.NCORP PRACTICE SITE RANDOMIZATION
A practice site is defined as any practice location within an overarching NCORP designation where 
oncology physicians and study staff work independently, i.e., do not cross over into another site.  Practice 
sites will be randomized to one of the two study arms by [CONTACT_3553] a computer –generated randomization 
table.  Past accrual to URCC studies will be used to stratify each practice site as a large accruing (20 or 
more accruals/year) site or a small accruing practice site in order to assure balance in the ran domization.  
The randomization process will be determined using R software provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Charles Heckler, the 
lead biostatistician of the URCC NCORP Research Base.   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) 26 22 10. INTERVENTION OVERV IEW FOR PHYSICIANS
Practice sites will be notified if they are in the intervention arm by [CONTACT_96570]. At the 
sites randomized to the intervention arm, oncology teams will implement the intervention.  The oncology 
physician is required to review the GA informati on and decide upon recommendations.  He/she can 
designate an advanced practice practitioner (APP)  (e.g., nurse practitioner (NP) or physician assistant 
(PA)) or an oncology fellow to assist with interven tion procedures.  The URCC NCORP Research Base 
must be  informed if an APP or a fellow is participating prior to any study procedures being implemented.  
Designated APPs and fellows , if at an intervention site,  must complete intervention training procedures.  
Sites will be asked by [CONTACT_96571] a physician is recruited.    These members 
will be contact[CONTACT_96572] (i.e. control, intervention).  
Prior to implementing the  intervention , oncology physicians  and designees will receive  training on how to 
best utilize GA information in clinical practice for older adults with cancer.   The training session 
provides a brief overview of the intervention information and can be completed through a web 
conference, telephone call, or as a paper “sign -off” documenting review of the materials.  The training 
materials were  developed with resource s from Drs. Mohile ’s and Hurria’s geriatric oncology  lectures.   
The CRAs and/or research nurses at sites randomized to the intervention arm  will be trained to utilize the 
mycarg.org website  to derive a summary of GA scores and a list of targeted GA -drive n recommendations .  
This information will be printed by [CONTACT_96573] “sign off” that 
he/she has received and reviewed the information .    
Study or clinical staff can assist the oncology physician in checking which reco mmendations were 
considered and facilitating implementation of GA -driven recommendations.  The oncology physician can 
identify which of the recommendations he/she thinks are appropriate and high priority for the pa rticipa nt.  
They do not all need to be impl emented at the time of the visit but implementation should occur before the 
4 week visit.    
Selection of  GA recommendations  could occur prior to the baseline visit or during the baseline visit in 
conjunction with the pa rticipan t and/or caregiver.  It is strongly preferred that the oncology physician 
conduct the baseline study visit.   The baseline study visit can be conducted by [CONTACT_96574] .  If the oncology physician is not available prior to the start of th e 
new treatment regimen, an APP or oncology fellow may conduct the baseline study visit.   The APP 
and/or oncology fellow must have completed intervention training prior to the baseline study visit.  If an 
APP or oncology fellow is cond ucting the baseline v isit, the oncology physician should still determine the 
recommendations and they will need to be approved or “signed off” by [CONTACT_96568]. It is 
required that discussion occur s either in person or by [CONTACT_96575] A PP 
or oncology fellow regarding the GA information and recommendations prior to the baseline visit.   The 
oncology physician must still complete  the other  physician forms. The baseline surveys will capture 
which member of the oncology team conducted the ba seline visit.  
Two copi[INVESTIGATOR_96538]: one should be provided to the 
participant /caregiver and one should be retained in the study chart.  Participant s and caregivers should be 
provided with a copy of the GA summary and GA -driven recommendation forms prior to the  baseline 
visit.  The original forms should be submitted to the URCC Research Base.   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) 26 24 11.1. Procedures Prior to Screening Visit 
11.1.1. Oncology P hysician  Enrollment  and Participation  
11.1.1a.  If an oncology physician  is interested in the study and meets the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, he/she will agree to participate on paper or through REDC ap (sent by [CONTACT_96560]) .  
11.1.1b The oncology physician  will complete  a baseline survey on dem ographics and treatment 
preferences either on paper or through REDC ap. 
11.1.1c  Ideally oncology physicians are enrolled as soon as possible.  However, a n oncology  
physician can be enrolled after his/her patient is iden tified for the study or prior to screening 
registration for the first identified patient.   
11.1.2. Participan t Identification Process  
11.1.2a . Participan ts: Once a site has IRB approv al, the site study staff can start screening for 
participant s according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria for patients  (section 4.2) .  Only patients 
from enrolled physicians can be registered.  
11.1.2b. Screening Log : A screening log  will be kept at each participating  site, where all patien ts 
approached for the study  will be entered by [CONTACT_96577].   The screening log can be completed 
on paper or through REDCap.   
11.2. Screening:  VISIT 0 
11.2.1. Participant  Recruitment &  Consent Process  
11.2.1a . Participant s 
The site study staff will notify the patient’s oncology physician  when a patient is identified
as a possible candidate for the study.   Site study staff should screen for patients who may fit
eligibility criteria  for all requirements other than GA impairment.   It is anticipated that  some
of the patients who are eligible will be new patients for the oncology physician .  Site study
staff should confirm that planned treatment includes either a chemotherapy agent or another
agent s approved by [CONTACT_96578].  Approved agents are available on a
list on t he URCC NCORP Research Base website with study -related materials.  If the agent
or regimen  is not on the list, contact [CONTACT_96579]. The
Research Base will review toxici ty information and if approved, will add drugs to the list in
an ongoing fashion  (see section 4.2.1c) .
The oncology physician  and/or CRA  should  mention the study to the patient and give out
recruitment materials.
If the patient is interested, the oncology physician and/or site study staff will explain the
study and once all aspects of the study have been discussed to the patient’s satisfaction, the
voluntary written informed consent procedures will be completed with the patient if they
choose to enroll in the study.
The si te study staff can schedule a separate visit with the patient to go over consent and
initiate study procedures if more time is needed.
11.2.2. Participan t Assessment Process  
11.2.2a . Once a pa rticipan t has consented, screening and baseline assessments/ procedures need to [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) [ADDRESS_106589] of the steps below:  
Confirm that the pa rticipan t’s oncology physician  has been enrolled onto the study and if
not, follow procedures for enrolling oncology physicians.
Participan ts meeting eligibility criteria are initially registered with a screening registration
after  signing consent .
Administer cognitive, physical, and nutritional assessments to the pa rticipan t.
These assessments can be administered right after consent, at a separate visit
scheduled by [CONTACT_96577], or just prior to the  baseline study  visit.  Allow [ADDRESS_106590] prior to  the  baseline study  visit.
Anyone at the practice site can administer cognitive and physical assessments to the
participan t as long as they have participated in the required GA training administered
by [CONTACT_96561].  CRAs, clinical nurses, and technicians are all eligible
to participate in training and can complete GA study procedures.
Participan t will complete all screening  surveys.
Ideally the pa rticipant  will complete either at the time  of consent or the screening and
baseline packet s can be taken home and completed before the baseline study  visit. If
the pa rticipa nt needs assistance from site study staff to complete surveys, allow
adequate time.  Approximately 60 minutes is recommend ed.
Abstract required medical information from chart .
11.2.2c.  The GA must  be completed within 4 weeks prior to the  baseline  study visit with the 
oncology team .  The baseline  study visit with the  oncology  team  should be scheduled prior 
to starting the new treatment  regimen . Treatment should begin within 4 weeks after the 
baseline study visit.  
11.3. Baseline:  VISIT 1  
11.3.1. Participan t Assessment Process  
11.3.1.a.  BEFORE BASELINE VISIT:  
Site study staff will telephone the participant to: 
Confirm that participan t will be starting  a new treatment  regimen . If a pa rticipan t decides
not to proceed with the new regimen before the baseline registration is performed ,
registration should not be completed and the pa rticipan t should be considered a screen
failure .
Confirm scheduled visit  with the oncology team .
Confirm that the pa rticipa nt completed the screening surveys before the baseline study visit
and remind them to bring the surveys in with them .
Schedule the  participa nt to come in  to meet with site study st aff at least [ADDRESS_106591] not been completed.  Only
participan ts that complete GA procedures ca n be registered for the  study.
11.3.1.b. AT THE BASELINE VISIT:  
If screening surveys have not been complete d prior to the pa rticipa nt coming in , complete
them at this visit .
If not complete, staff should  administer cognitive, physical performance, and nutrition
assessment .[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) 26 26 If not complete, staff should  complete  CRA study forms.
If not complete, baseline surveys  should be done . The baseline surveys do not need to be
completed prior to baseline registration, but should be completed on the day of the baseline
visit.  For example, pa rticipan ts can complete baseline surveys while receiving cancer
treatment that same day.
Score each GA measure as taught in training procedures.   If assistance is needed for scoring,
contact [CONTACT_96580].
Participan ts that have at least one abnormal GA score other than polypharmacy can move
forward with the study .
After the GA and the above steps are complete, the baseline registration procedures can be
completed for the pa rticipa nt (refer to section 6 . Registration ).
Regis tration must occur prior to baseline study visit with the oncology team  and prior
to starting the new treatment  regimen.
Once the pa rticipan t is registered, if the new treatment  regimen does not get initiated,
complete the C ancer T reatment  Status  form.  Pa rticipan ts should continue to be
followed and remain on study.
Prior to the study visit with the oncology team , if depression (GDS) or cognition (BOMC)
assessments score  ≥ 11, inform pa rticipa nt’s oncology physician as follows:
Usual Care arm -- inform oncology physician with template as per training.
Intervention arm -- information on cognitive impairment or depression is included in
summary (see section 1 1.3.2, Intervention Procedures ).
11.3.2. Intervention Procedures (Only for sites randomized to  the intervention arm ) 
11.3.2.a.  AT THE BASELINE VISIT : 
After the pa rticipa nt ha s been registered for the study, e nter the GA scores into mycarg.org
website or if no internet is available, contact [CONTACT_96581].
After entering the GA scores, p rint the built pdf packet  specific to that pa rticipa nt.
Present GA summary form and recommendation forms to oncology  team  to review just prior
to baseline  study  visit.  The study visit must occur prior to starting the new regimen . Study
staff can assist in  the completion of the forms.  Study and clinical staff can assist in
implementing GA -driven recommendations after the physician approves them.
Information on cognitive impairment or depression is included in the summary .
The o ncology physician MUST  review  and sign the  summary form and
recommendation s forms.   Another team member (APP or oncology fellow) can
conduct the baseline study visit only if the physician is unavailable.   If this is the case,
the GA summary informati on and recommendations must be reviewed or discussed
with the oncology physician prior to the baseline study visit.
GA r ecommendations that are planned by [CONTACT_96582] t
should be check -marked by [CONTACT_96583].
Two copi[INVESTIGATOR_96539]: one
should be provided to the pa rticipa nt and one should be retained in the study chart.
The original forms should be sent to the URCC Research Base.
11.3.4. Oncology  Physician  Assessment for Pa rticipa nt: After the baseline visit, oncology 
physician s will complete  a brief survey (on paper) to capture factors that influenced the decision -
making process for treatment.  Oncology physicians must complete this survey even if another 
member of the oncology team  conduct ed the baseline study visit.    [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) 26 27 11.3.5. Submitting Materials  to the URCC Research Base : 
11.3. 5a. After the baseline visit, site study staff should ensure the forms below are completed and 
submit them to the Research Base:  
All oncology physician  and pa rticipa nt assessments from above
All CRA study forms
Clinic note from visit s
Cancer t reatment  plan
Intervention summary and recommendation forms (if applicable)
11.4. Follow -up Visits:  
11.4.1. Visits will occur 4-6 weeks after the baseline visit, 10 -14 weeks after the baseline visit (3 
months), and 20 -26 weeks after the baseline visit (6 months) . 
11.4.1a. BEFORE EACH FOLLOW -UP VISIT:  
Study staff will telephone the  participan t to:  
Confirm scheduled visit  with the oncology team.  The visit does not need to be scheduled
with the oncology physician.   The participa nt can choose to visit with study staff to complete
procedures on a day other than a scheduled visit with their oncology team.
Confirm that the participant  completed the survey s.
Surveys must be completed during the appropriate window  for each time point .  Site
study staff can either mail the follow -up surveys OR at the end of one visit, they can
provide the next round of surveys to the participan ts to take home with them for the
next follow -up visit.
Ideally participant s will complete the survey packet at home and bring to site study
staff on the day of a routinely scheduled visit for the oncology physician  or designee
(e.g., nurse practitioner) visit or during cancer treatment infusions .
If the p articipan t needs assistance from site study staff to complete surveys on -site,
allow adequate  time (45 -60 minutes) .
If participant s cannot complete packet at home :
Participan t can come in prior to office  visit to complete surveys .
Participan t can complete surveys during cancer treatment  infusion s.
If needed , the participan t can meet with the site study staff at an additional time
to complete the follow -up surveys. The participan ts do not need to meet with  the
oncology physician  to complete the surveys.
11.4.1b. AT  SCHEDULED FOLLOW -UP VISIT S: 
Participa nt: Bring in completed surveys in the follow -up packet or complete at visit.
At each visit:  Staff will review pa rticipa nt surveys for completion and administer the
following assessments to the participa nt:
Cognitive and Physical Performance
If depression (GDS) assessment score  ≥ 11, both usual care arm and intervention arm
inform pa rticipan t’s oncology physician with template as per training.
Complet e all CRA follow -up study forms including treatment and toxicity forms.
Treatment and toxicity information should be captured consecutively.
At the 4 -6 week time point:  CRAs at practice sites randomized to the intervention arm  will
complete the GA -Recommendation Follow -up forms  by [CONTACT_96584] -
Recommendation Baseline forms, clinic note s, and  conferring with the oncology team  if
needed  to verify which recommendations were implemented.
If the pa rticipa nt discontinues cancer treatment  for any reason , a Cancer Treatment  Status[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) 26 28 form should be completed and submitted to the URCC NCORP Resear ch Base and the

data.  
11.4.1c.  DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES RELATED TO ACTIVE WITH MISSING 
DATA,  LOS T TO FOLLOW -UP, AND WITHDRAWAL  
Many in this study’s pa rticipan t population  are expected to become more ill as the study 
progresses due to the nature of the ir underlying cancer diagnosis.  It is understood pa rticipan ts 
may not be well enough to complete all study asses sments or visits. Therefore, the following 
definit ions are provided to account for this when ca pturing patient status outcomes in this 
population.   
Once a pa rticipan t has completed the baseline registration, p articipan ts are considered active 
participants with missing survey data  if they decline to complete surveys or CRA administered 
GA measures  or both (e.g. , too ill, too tired)  or they are unable to come to study visits due to 
being too ill  or entering hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125] .  They will be considered lost to  follow up  if they are  unable to 
be contact[CONTACT_96585] .  
Participa nts who discontinue treatment but are still being followed by [CONTACT_96586] (surveys and CRA administered GA measures).  If they 
decline to complete surveys or CRA administered GA measures, these pa rticipan ts will also be 
considered active participants with missing survey data.  
In all of the above scenarios, CRA measures collecting data from the medical record (clinic notes, 
chemotherapy flow -sheets, labs) should contin ue until the [ADDRESS_106592] been made.

9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) 26 29 The primary aim of this study requires the review of treatment toxicity through patient report and/or CRA 
review of the medical record (in collaboration with the oncology team).   Assessment of treatment toxicity 
is a routine part of clinical care.   As note d above, patients can partially or completely discontinue their 
own participation in study activities at any time without actively (verbally) withdrawing from the study 
(i.e., active participant with missing data).  A withdrawal from the study is defined as  a patient who 
verbally states that they no longer wish to be participating in, contact[CONTACT_96587].  Only a patient can withdraw themselves from the study. If the patient does not have cognitive 
capacity, their proxy or authorized repr esentative can withdraw a patient from the study. CRAs cannot 
withdraw a patient from study.  
Because of the fragile patient population being studied, the patient should not be automatically assumed 
to be withdrawn from the study if they are too ill to c omplete surveys or if they decline to complete 
surveys or GA procedures at one or more visits or go into hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125].   The CRA should continue to obtain 
medical chart  data, as it relates to subject outcomes, treatment and toxicity outcomes (i.e., Cancer 
Treat ment Dosage Form, Toxicity Outcome Forms, Cancer Treatment Status Follow -up Forms) for both 
active with missing data and withdrawal patients unless the patient provides in writing that they no longer 
wish this data to be collected. This should be provided to the UR NCORP Research Base.  These 
procedures do not require patient participation.   Research Base staff will also obtain Medicare data if 
agreed to in the patient consent.  
All data will be kept in a confidential manner.   All data will be used unless permission is revoked in 
writing and forwarded to the URCC NCORP Research Base.   Site staff should forward any such 
correspondence to the URCC NCORP Research Base.  
11.5. Survival Status will be recorded at approximately one year from date of p articipant  baseline 
registration on the Survival Status  form . 
12.REIMBURSEMENT
In order to improve study retention and compliance, we will compensate participant s for their 
participation (i.e., time an d travel).  Assessments are paid at $15.00 each and payments will be provided 
after each time point  starting with the baseline visit .  Participant s can receive up to $60 if all four time 
point assessments are completed.  
13.ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING
13.1. Risks from participating in this re search are psychological distress from completing the 
questionnaires and the cognitive testing.

14.CRITERIA FOR WITHDRA WAL
If an oncology physician  withdraws from study, no further patients with this oncology physician  will be 
recruited.   The final physician follow -up survey should be completed at the end of the study or at the time 
of a physician withdrawing; for example, if they were to move or join another practice . Whenever  
possible, pa rticipant s that have already been enrolled should complete study procedures  (see section 
11.4.1c) .  The URCC Research NCORP Base should be contact[CONTACT_96588] s whose enrolled physician is withdrawing from the study.  
See section 11.4.1c for procedures related to missing data, lost to follow up , or withdrawal .  Participant s 
that decline or are to o ill to complete follow -up surveys should not be considered as withdrawals; instead 
they will be considered active participan ts with missing survey data. Due to the nature of the illness, we 
expect there will be pa rticipant s that will be too ill to complete their study related procedures (e.g., 
surveys, GA procedure s). In these situations, CRAs should still be collecting medical  record chart review 
and completing CRA forms as per section 11.4.1c.    
Patients can partially or completely discontinue their own participation in study activities at any time 
without actively (verbally) withdrawing from the study (i.e., active particip ant with missing data).  A 
withdrawal from the study is defined as a patient who verbally states that they no longer wish to be 
participating in, contact[CONTACT_96589].  Only a patient can withdraw themselves from the 
study. If the patient  does not have cognitive capacity, their proxy or authorized representative can 
withdraw a patient from the study. CRAs cannot withdraw a patient from study.  
Because of the fragile patient population being studied, the patient should not be automaticall y assumed 
to be withdrawn from the study if they are too ill to complete surveys or if they decline to complete 
surveys or GA procedures at one or more visits or go into hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125].   The CRA should continue to obtain 
medical chart data, as it relates to subje ct outcomes, treatment and toxicity outcomes (see Section 11.4.1c) 
for both active with missing data and withdrawal patients unless the patient provides in writing that they 
no longer wish this data to be collected. This should be provided to the UR NCORP Research Base.  
These procedures do not require patient participation.   Research Base staff will also obtain Medicare data 
if agreed to in the patient consent.   
All data will be kept in a confidential manner.   All data will be used unless permission is revoked in 
writing and forwarded to the URCC NCORP Research Base.   Site staff should forward any such 
correspondence to the URCC NCORP Research Base.  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

15.1.  Statistical Considerations  
Unless otherwise stated, all statistical tests will be performed at the two -tailed 5% level of significance.   
Likewise, 95% confidence intervals will be constructed for effect estimates.  Data will be analyzed on an 
"intent -to-treat" basis. The assumption s underlying all statistical analyses will be thoroughly checked 
using appropriate graphical and numerical methods.110,[ADDRESS_106595] in all the models below.  Intra -cluster 
correlation (ICC) will be calculated from the variance component estimates as Var( NCOR P) / 
[Var( NCORP ) + Var(Residual)].  To estimate uncertainty in the calculated ICCs, we will use Bayesian 
methods (Markov Chain Monte -Carlo) assuming a noninformative prior to estimate credible intervals for 
the computed ICCs.  The specific NCORP  differences will be assessed graphically using Best Linear 
Unbiased Predictors (BLUP) of the mean response for each NCORP . 
15.2.  Justification of Study Design  
The study is designed as a cluster randomized trial because a care or service model is applied to each 
participant  by [CONTACT_54263].  If a cluster design were not undertaken, there would be contamination 
in that practitioners and teams could choose the care or service model once they were exposed to 
participant s in both arms.  The cluster random ized design will allow for the comparison of toxicity 
between Arms 1 and 2 in the same timeframe.   
15.3. Sample Size Considerations  
Cluster Randomized Design  Sample 
Size:   The primary outcome measure 
for this study is the proportion of 
participant s that experience grade 3 -5 
toxicity within 3 months of treatment  
initiation .  Given the clinical 
significance of toxicity, we propose 
that any statistically significant 
reduction in the proportion of 
participant s that experience toxicity 
would be clinically sig nificant.  In the 
published CARG study, 307 of 500 
participant s had advanced  cancer and of these, 141 (46%) experienced grade 3, 4, or 5 toxicity within 3 
months.5  The proportion of pa rticipant s that underwent full geriatric assessment plus interventions in our 
geriatric oncology clinic that experienced chemotherapy toxicity was 33%.  Our pa rticipant  population 
aged 70 and over with advanced  solid tumor malignancies  receiving chemotherapy, was similar  to 
participant s studied in our preliminary work.  Our previous multicenter study5 has allowed us to calculate 
the intracluster correlation (ICC) amongst [ADDRESS_106596] that oncology physicians  and 
their tea ms assess chemotherapy toxicity with NCI Common Toxicity Criteria.  To be on the conservative 
side, our power calculations assume ICC=0.10.  This design (8 sites per arm and 43 participant s per site) 
has 80% power to detect a 13% reduction in the proportio n of pa rticipant s that experience grade 3 -5 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) 26 33 chemotherapy toxicity within 3 months of chemotherapy initiation, assuming a two -sided significance 
level of 0.05 and an ICC of 0.10.  See Table 2 for sample size requirements for some other changes in 
proportion of toxicity.  Account ing for a small drop -out rate of 10% (based on our observational cohort 
data5), the targeted accrual will be [ADDRESS_106597] and primary team, the drop -out rate reflects pa rticipant s that sign consent but withdraw prior to 
baseline assessment.   
During  NCORP  site recruitment, if more than 16 NCORP  sites are interested in participating, we will 
allow  randomization . The total p articipan t sample size will remain the same, and  accrual will cease 
when that target is met . 
15.4.  Primary Analysis  
a.The primary outcome measure for this study is the proportion of pa rticipant s that experience
grade 3 -5 toxicity within 3 months of  treatment  initiation .  Because of the cluster randomized
study design, we will apply generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) methodology .114
Toxici ty (Yes/No) will be the response, and arm, treatment type and arm:treatment type
interaction  will be the fixed effect s.  NCORP  practice  site will be entered as a random effect
independent of residual error.  Estimation will be performed using the Residual Pseudo
Likelihood procedure, assuming a binomial distribution and logit link.  Using the fitted
model, we will provide estimates and 95% confidence intervals for proportion of pa rticipant s
that experience toxicity for each arm, as well as risk ratios betwe en the arms . This will allow
the results for those who fit the original eligibility criterion (on chemotherapy) to be
compared to the other allowed treatments that have a similar toxicity profile as
chemotherapy.
15.5. Secondary Analyses  
15.5.1.  Secondary Aim [ADDRESS_106598] of the intervention on 6 -month survival 
using log  rank tests and survival plots. Assuming an exponential survival distribution, and given 
survival proportion of 0.89 at 6 months from our previous observational work5 and a sample size of 
624, we estimate that there will be 80% power (0.05 significance level) to detect an increase in 
survival proportion greater than 0.942, implying a detectable hazard ratio of 0.511.   
15.5.2.  Secondary Aim 2a .  We will compare the effect of the intervention on measures of 
decisional regret (both pa rticipan t and oncology physician ) using four linear mixed models (regret ).  
For each model, Arm will be the fixed effect and NCORP  will be a random effect (independent of 
residual error).  Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimation will be used, and inference will 
be performed using the Kenward -Roger degrees of freedom adjustment procedure.  We will also 
determine whether the in tervention influences the relative dose intensity (RDI) of treatment  given in 
the first line setting by [CONTACT_96590].  In addition, to investigate 
whether the intervention changes dosing, we will analyze with a linear mixed  model.  In this model, 
RDI will be the response.  The fixed effect will be Arm and the random effect will be NCORP .  
Overall change in dosing will be assessed with an F Test . Lastly, we will determine the association of 
baseline oncology physician  and pat ient decision -making interaction on likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_96540]. Variables to be evaluated will be derived from pa rticipan t assessments (control preferences 
(CP)) and oncology physician  comfort (PC) with shared decision -making.  A GLMM will be fit wi th 
chemotherapy toxicity as the response, Arm, , CP and PC as fixed factors, and NCORP  site as a 
random effect independent of residual error.  Otherwise, the modeling methodology is the same as for 
the Primary Aim.  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) 26 34 15.5.3.  Secondary Aim 2b . We will compare whethe r the uptake of geriatric assessment 
interventions (% of recommended interventions carried out influences chemotherapy toxicity.  The 
data from the intervention arm will be fit to a GLMM with  toxicity as the outcome, percent of 
recommended interventions a s the fixed effect, and NCORP  site as a random effect independent of 
residual error.  Otherwise, the modeling methodology is the same as for the Primary Aim.  
15.5.4.  Exploratory Aim s.   We will evaluate changes in functional abilities and physical 
performance between Arms 1 and 2.  For each of these outcomes, a GLMM structured the same as 
that used in Specific Aim 2 will be used.  Functional status will measured with IADL score.   Physical 
perfor mance will be measured with the OARS Physical Health Subscale and the  Short Physical 
Performance Battery .  PRO -CTCAE analyses will be performed using descriptive statistics, 
correlations, and regressions to evaluate changes in symptoms over time, relations hip between PRO 
results and clinician -related to toxicity, and relationship of symptoms with treatment  decisions.  
15.6. Missing Data  
Every effort will be made to encourage and facilitate participants' completion of questionnaires, but 
because of dropout, missing data will occur.  We will evaluate the patterns of missing data and 
associations of missingness with other available variables. Under the missing at random (MAR) 
assumption, we will use multiple imputation to obtain unbiased estimates of the key sta tistics.  If the data 
are suspected to be missing not at random (MNAR), a sensitivity analysis using selection and/or pattern -
mixture models will be run to determine the impact on the results.115  If the estimates are similar to the 
ones obtain ed from the simpler analysis of only complete cases, we will report the complete -case analysis 
results.  
It is hypothesized that the GA summary and GA -driven recommendations provided in the intervention 
arm will result in a greater number of missing data  (e.g., if participan ts decide not to go onto a new 
treatment  regimen after reviewing the summary) so for these pa rticipan ts, no toxicities will be reported. 
We will impute this kind of missing data with the data from the PRO -CTCAE.  We will also still fol low 
the pa rticipan ts.  This will enable us  to perform ITT analysis.116 Missing data for other reason, e.g., 
dropout, will be handled with the methodologies described in the previous  paragraph.   
16.DATA MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
16.1. Training Procedures  
A special training session  was held at the annual URCC NCORP  Research Base meeting in September  
2013 . This training  include d a detailed review of the study rationale, design, and research administration 
procedures. Training session s will be held with the staff from each site  via teleconference and at the 
annual meetings .  These sessions and the corresponding procedures manual s will review the following: 1) 
informed consent; 2) completing the assessments using Teleforms; 3) completing the functional and 
objective measures; 4) data collection via chart extraction; 5) completing the web -based intervention 
using mycarg.org (for int ervention arm  only); 6) transfer of the data to the URCC NCORP  Research 
Base; 7) formulating the research chart; and 8 ) a discussion of interviewing techniques so that the 
research team will standardize their approaches in order to elicit consistent data f rom participant s. There 
will be a protocol update every year at the annual Research Base  meeting.  All assessments, data 
collection forms, and manuals will be readily available on the NCORP  Research Base website.  
16.2. Data Management  
The same protocols and procedures for data quality and control that we use for all URCC NCORP  
Research Base protocols (which accrued over 1,000 pa rticipant s in the previous year) will be used for this 
study. Once the patient consents to the protocol, he/she will be assigned a unique identifier  by [CONTACT_96591], which will be used to link all pa rticipan t data.  Oncology physician  and pa rticipan t 
assessments will be captured using scannable Teleforms. The CRA and/or Research Nurse  at each site [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
9-26-16 URCC13059 Revised Protocol clean (1) [ADDRESS_106599] and manage this information. 
Further, we will link this information  to the encrypted ACCESS database (which contains the survey 
information) with a uniq ue identifier.    
16.3.1.  The University of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center  provides the following information on the 
REDCap program: “ Vanderbilt University, in collaboration with a consortium of institutional 
partners, has developed a software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection and 
management of research and clinical trial data, called REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). 
The REDCap system is a secure, web -based application that is flexible enough to be used for a 
variety of ty pes of research.   It provides an intuitive interface for users to enter data and real time 
validation rules (with automated data type and range checks) at the time of data entry. REDCap offers 
easy data manipulation with audit trails and functionality for reporting, monitoring and querying 
participan t records, as well as an automated export mechanism to common statistical packages (SPSS, 
SAS, Stata, R/S -Plus).  Through the REDCap Consortium, Vanderbilt has disseminated REDCap for 
use around the world. Curre ntly, over 240 academic and non -profit consortium partners on six 
continents with over 26,000 research end -users use REDCap .”  
16.3.2.  According to the University of [COMPANY_002]ster Clinical and Translational Science Institute 
(CTSI), REDCap is supported with the following means. “The CTSI Informatics Core , a unit of 
the SMD Academic Information Technology (AIT) Group, will serve as a central facilitator for data 
processing and management.   REDCap data collection projects rely on a thorough study -specific data 
dictionary defined in an iterative self -documenting process by [CONTACT_59881], with 
planning assistance from the AIT-CTSI Informatics Core . The iterative development and testing 
process results in a well -planned data collection strategy for individual studies.”  
16.3.3.  The CTSI states that regarding security, “ REDCap servers are housed in a local data center 
at the Univ ersity of [COMPANY_002]ster and all web -based information transmission is encrypted. REDCap was 
developed in a manner consistent with HIPAA security requirements and is recommended to 
University of [COMPANY_002]ster researchers by [CONTACT_96592] n. 
16.4. Data Storage  
All written materials will be kept confidential, locked in the private offices and limited -access file room 
of the URCC NCORP  Research Base and identified by [CONTACT_96593].  All electronic information will  be 
kept confidential with password -protected, limited access.  
The Case Summary should accompany ALL  data submissions.  All completed forms must be submitted 
should be sent within 7 days of study visit to:

For a detailed description of the measures that will be collected, refer to Appendix I IA-IID:  Summary of 
Measures , Participan t Measures, Clinical Research Associate Materials, and Oncology physician  
Measures.  
18.PARTICIPANT  CONSENT AND PEER JU DGMENT
All investigational, FDA, NCI, state, federal and institutional regulations concerning informed consent 
and peer judgment will be fulfilled.  
19. RECORD AND DATA RE TENTION
Clinical research records are source documents and records, in any form (including, but not limited to, 
written, electronic, magnetic, and optical records, in addition, scans (x -rays and electrocardiograms) tha t 
describe or record the methods, conduct, and/or results of a trial, and the actions taken. Unlike 
pharmaceutical -sponsored research, under the Terms of the NIH Award, the awardee institution retains 
ownership of the clinical research records that were co nducted with NIH support. Records may be 
preserved in hardcopy, electronic or other media form since there is no regulatory requirement that 
clinical research records be retained in a certain type of format. However, investigators should check with 
their i nstitution for institutional policies and procedures pertaining to record retention. All records relating 
to research that is conducted must be retained for at least five years after completion of the research. The 
three -year time period begins when the in dividual institution’s engagement in the human subject’s  
research activity ends. Human subject research activities are considered completed once all research -
related interventions and interactions with human subjects have been completed, all data collectio n and 
analysis of identifiable private information described in the IRB -approved research plan have been 
finished and primary analysis of either identifiable private or de -identified  information is completed.  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

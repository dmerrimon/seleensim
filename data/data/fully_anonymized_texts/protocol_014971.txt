2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Background          
The CapsoCam® Colon (CV -3) (herein after referred to as CapsoCam®  or the study device ) is intended 
to provide visualization of the colon and the detection of colon polyps in adults.  
 
The CapsoCam® is a capsule endoscope system that captures and stores image data onboard for subsequent download and review.  The system does not require the placement of external data receivers or a data recorder on the subject. In  vivo image data are stored within the capsule, and it is 
retrieved by [CONTACT_220512] a specified site for data download. A physician reviews the video on a computer using the CapsoView software, makes a diagnosis, and creates a report. 
 The literature indicates colon capsule endoscopy  safe and a tolerable method for visualization of the 
large intestine.
1-[ADDRESS_264851] occurred in colon capsule endoscopy ( CCE) 
studies have been associated with bowel preparation and not with the CCE itself.4  CCE’s high 
acceptability by [CONTACT_220513],3,5,6 coupled with the potential for out -of-clinic use,7 could 
increase patient adherence to CRC screening guidelines when offered as an alternative screening method.
8 The main, but still rare, complication of capsule endoscopy is capsule retention.2,3,9  In the 
clinical studies reviewed, the incidence of capsule retention requiring endoscopic or surgical removal depended on the indication of the study and varied from 1- 2% in subjects referred for obscure 
gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) to 2- 5% for subje cts with known Crohn’s disease.
10,[ADDRESS_264852] gone undetected without the capsule procedure.  
 CCE provides a thorough visualization of the colon and is less invasive and more convenient for patients than optical colonoscopy (OC) . It is especially suitable for patients at elevated risk for 
colonoscopy or associated sedation. The CapsoCam® has several potential advantages relative to existing capsule endoscopes.  It includes an attached balloon, which adjusts buoyancy to speed the 
colon transit; a panoramic imaging system that presents a more direct view of the mucosa with potentially less chance of m issing features of interest due to obscuration or poor illumination; a 3D 
sensing system which allows the size of polyps to be measured; and AI -based computer aided 
detection (CADe) of colon polyps. 
 
2.2 CapsoCam® Colon (CV -3) System  
The overall system consists of the ingestible device, the capsule data access system (CDAS), the 
image -review and CADe workstation software CapsoView® (CVV) , the retrieval kit (CVR) , and 
CapsoCloud® (CLD), a cloud- based system allowing physicians to access and read videos online . Five  
unique design attributes of this system are: 1) it does not employ wireless communication technology (e.g. a radio transmitter) while in vivo and does not generate significant electromagnetic interference, so subjects with implanted medical devices such as pacemakers and hearing aids may safely use the CapsoCam®, 2) it utilizes a panoramic imaging system rather than a camera on each end of the capsule, with the intent to provide complete colon visualization and short video review times, 3) it

 includes hardware and software which enable the measurement of polyp diameter,  4) it includes an 
inflatable balloon attached to the capsule to quicken transit through the colon, and 5) it includes AI -
powered software for computer assisted detection (CADe) of polyps.  
2.3 Device Description  
The CapsoCam® is an ingestible capsule, Figure 1. The video capsule contains a panoramic color 
digital video camera, two silver -oxide watch batteries, white -LED illumination sources, a laser diode 
for data download, and system -control and nonvolatile flash- memory data -storage electronics. The 
video camera capsule saves data in the on -board flash memory as it traverses the GI tract. The 
CapsoCam® is a capsule endoscope that uses non -wireless technology to capture and store images.  
The CapsoCam® is less than  12.4 x 32.6 mm in size and has four (4) lateral -facing cameras, providing 
a 360° circumferential view.  The capsule does not require placement of external sensors or a data recorder on the subject.  
 
 
Figure 1  Photograph of CapsoCam® Colon (CV -3) (as swallowed)  
 
 
The CapsoCam® has an in vivo  feature- size measurement tool. The modified capsule has a projector 
that projects beams of light onto surrounding surfaces within the camera field of view (FOV). When an 
in vivo  object is within the FOV of the camera, bright spots from these projected beams appear in the 
captured images.  As the distance between the object and CapsoCam®  changes, the spot positions 
change, since the projector and the camera pupil are not coincident.  Using software to determine which spot comes f rom which beam and accounting for the distortion of the camera lens, the object 
distance is determined at every spot.  These data can be displayed as a 3 -dimensional (3D) mesh 
showing the surface profile of the object.  The clinician can  measure the size of polyps using the 
graphical user interface (GUI) of the CapsoView softw are.  
Unlike other capsule endoscopy devices, the CapsoCam® does  not employ wireless communication 
technology ( e.g. a radio transmitter) and does not generate significant electromagnetic interference.  
Subjects with implanted medical devices such as pacemakers and hearing aids may safely use the CapsoCam® .

 The CapsoCam® consists of a capsule camera attached to a self -inflatin g balloon encapsulated inside a  
dissolvable outer shell. The outer shell is intended to make swallowing the device easier. The inflatable 
balloon helps to stabilize the capsule transit through the gastrointestinal tract. Inside the balloon is an effervescent formulation that reacts to p roduce CO
2 gas once it contacts trace amounts of water that 
diffuse into the balloon through the balloon membrane, Figure 2.  
 
 
Figure 2  Photograph of an inflated CapsoCam® Colon, (CV -3) 
 
The CO 2 inflates the balloon and the specific gravity of the device is reduced to about 1, which means 
that the capsule achieves neutral buoyancy and can more readily move through the intestines with 
flowing liquid, increasing the likelihood of a complete colon visualization.  
As the CapsoCam® passes through the GI tract, it captures and saves images and other data  in the on-
board flash memory. Following retrieval of the CapsoCam®, the capsule images are downloaded using

2.4 Proposed Indications for Use  
The CapsoCam® Colon capsule endoscopy system is intended to provide visualization of the 
colon.   It may be used for detection of colon polyps in patients after an incomplete optical colonoscopy with adequate preparation, and a complete evaluation of the colon was not technically possible.  
 In addition, it is intended for detection of colon polyps in patients with major risks for colonoscopy or moderate sedation, who could tolerate colonoscopy and moderate sedation in the event a clinically significant colon abnormality was identified on caps ule endoscopy. 
 The object -size measurement tool is intended to measure the size of anatomical features, 
including polyps.  
 The computer -assisted  polyp detection software  (CADe) is intended to highlight regions in the 
capsule endoscopy video which contain visualized polyps to aid endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_220480].  
 
2.5 Early Clinical Investigations  
A complete Report of Prior Clinical Investigations relevant to the CapsoCam® is provided in Appendix A.  
2.5.1 Safety  
Interim results support a positive safety profile of the CapsoCam®. To date, there have been no serious or unanticipated adverse events reported. There were no capsule retentions, defined as subjects retaining the capsule after resuming post -procedural foo d ingestion. All 
capsules ingested in the studies were excreted. In all cases , the deflated balloons remained 
securely attached to the capsules upon excretion. 

  
CLN-CVI-[ADDRESS_264856] been no device -related AEs reported. However, a small number of 
anticipated bowel preparation and booster regimen adverse events were reported: nausea, 
limited epi[INVESTIGATOR_220481], and modest abdominal discomfort (for full details see Appendix A). These bowel preparations -related adverse events are known to be possible whenever 
bowel preparations are administered and are well characterized in the drug manufacturers’ prescription information.  
2.5.2 Effectiveness  
As outlined in Appendix A , the CapsoCam® has demonstrated the ability to capture 
quality images throughout the colon, provided the subject follows the bowel preparation and booster regimen instructions. For recent  versions of the study device, the operational 
time has been  adequate for the capsule to capture images of the entire colon in most  
procedures . Recorded images were successfully downloaded using the Capsule Data Access 
System (CDAS) and were then available for physicians to review and interpret . 
 
2.6 Rationale for This Study  
Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) has significant advantages for visualization of the colon and polyp detection. The procedure is less invasive than conventional optical colonoscopy (OC) and does not require sedation . However, significant , potentially precancerous , polyps detected by 
[CONTACT_220515]. Unlike stool or blood tests, CCE provides visual evidence and size measurement of pathology to assess its risk and motivate patients to get follow -
on colonoscopy when appropriate. CCE has been shown to have positive predictive value comparable to computed tomography colonography (CTC), another common alternative to conventional colonoscopy.
14,15 
 Currently, one CCE device, the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_220482] 2 (Medtronic) is marketed and indicated for 
visualization of the colon for patients who have had an incomplete colonoscopy or those with evidence of lower GI bleeding who are at major risk for colonoscopy or moderate sedation but who could tolerate colonos copy and moderate sedation should CCE identify clinical ly significant 
abnormality. A multicenter study evaluated CCE compared to OC for agreement on the absence or presence of colon polyps [ADDRESS_264857] and found 68.8% positive percent 
agreement (PPA) and 81.3% negative percent agreement (NPA).
12  
 To improve CCE’s utility, it should accurately identify those patients with potentially dangerous 
polyps who should undergo polypectomy and those at lower risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_9954] 
(CRC) who may not require immediate polypectomy. Since the precancerous potential of polyps 
is strongly correl ated to their size, accurate size measurement would greatly assist in this 
identintification.
13 Better accuracy in early polyp detection could reduce the number of 
unnecessary and costly colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_220483].  The CapsoCam Colon system 
includes a polyp size measurement to accurately measure polyp size, a feature the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_220484].   
 A challenge for CCE is the long video reading time and the risk that readers overlook polyps in the video, especially those captured in only a few frames. The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_220485] —one by [CONTACT_220516] - and one by [CONTACT_220517] -facing camera—increasing the reading time 
relative to a single -camera system. The CapsoCam Colon has four cameras , but their images are 
  
CLN-CVI-[ADDRESS_264858] 
CCE system to utilize artificial intelligence (AI), implemented as a convolutional neural network (CNN), for computer assisted detection (CADe) of polyps. The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_220486] 2 system (K123666)  has a software feature dubbed “Top 100” which shows “the [ADDRESS_264859] clinically 
relevant images in a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_220487], focused on frames containing lesions, bleeding, and polyps.” (Quick Reference Guide, Reading a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_220486] 2 capsule study in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_220488] v9, US1600035(1) © 2019 Medtronic). However, i ts polyp- detection accuracy 
has not been published, and the device does not have an FDA -cleared indication for this feature.  
 This study is designed to show that readers relying heavily on CADe (not reading the entire 
video) will  achieve positive -percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) 
with a colonoscopy that exceed performance goals and, when compared to the same readers not using CADe (reading the entire video) , superior PPA  and noninferior NPA . Since readers can 
reject false- positive CADe detections, the negative percent agreement ( NPA ) is not expected to 
decrease significantly when CADe is used, but the study will assess this risk.  
2.[ADDRESS_264860] will be read by [CONTACT_220518] , separated by a washout period: once with and once without access to the CADe  polyp 
detections. When performing the  CADe  read , the reader will review all the frames with CADe 
polyp detections segregated from the full  video, only referring to the full video as much as 
necessary to identify landmarks, rate the colon cleanliness , review the CADe  findings in the 
context of nearby [CONTACT_220519], localize the polyps by [CONTACT_220520], and measure the polyps’ sizes. The study will compare the readers’ polyp detectio n with and without CADe.  
 Cancerous lesions  in the colon, often called tumors  or cancerous polyps , will be referred to as  
cancerous polyps  in this protocol . Some of the polyps detected by [CONTACT_220521]®  may be 
cancerous polyps, and, although the CapsoCam®  cannot provide a diagnosis of cancer, detection 
of a polyp which is cancerous is considered a positive finding for detection of a cancerous polyp. 
The primary objective  of this study is to compare the study device  with CAD e polyp detection to 
optical colonoscopy (OC) for agreement on the presence or absence of colon polyps ≥ [ADDRESS_264861] 2024

3.7 CapsoCam® Video Reading  
CapsoVision will download image data from the capsules , and each subject  will be assigned 
without bias to one independent video reader  from a pool . Two versions of the video will have 
been created  at the download center , one for the CADe read and one the non- CADe read. The 
reader will be blinded to the correspondence between video and subject  and will be randomly 
assigned to read either the non- CADe  version  first (sequence A) or the CADe version first  
(sequence B) , with the second reading following a washout period of at least three (3) weeks. The 
two crossover sequences are summarized below.  
Sequence A:  
1. The reader first reviews the entire video without exposure to the CADe output  
and annotates all polyps detected, including measured size and location (colon 
segment). Anatomical landmark frames and bowel cleanliness ratings are 
recorded.  
2. Following a washout period of at least three weeks, the same reader reviews a secondary video that only includes frames with CADe polyp detections that are highlighted with a bounding box around the detection area. The reader can switch from the secondary video to the main video to view nearby [CONTACT_220519]. For CADe detections assessed to be a true polyp, and for any additional polyps detected in the main video, the reader annotates the polyp, including measured size and location (colon segment). Anatom ical landmark frames and bowel 
cleanliness ratings are recorded. The reader is instructed to review the main video only to the extent necessary to make these assessments and not to read it in its entirety.  
Sequence B:  
1. The reader first reviews a secondary video that only includes frames with CADe 
polyp detections that are highlighted with a bounding box around the detection area. The reader can switch from the secondary video to the main video to view 
nearby [CONTACT_220519]. For CADe detect ions assessed to be a true polyp, and for any 
additional polyps detected in the main video, the reader annotates the polyp, including measured size and location (colon segment). Anatomical landmark frames and bowel cleanliness ratings are record ed. The reader is instructed to 
review the main video only to the extent necessary to make these assessments and not to read it in its entirety.  
2. Following a washout period of at least three weeks, the same reader reviews the 
entire video without exposure to the CADe output  and annotates all polyps

 detected, including measured size and location (colon segment). Anatomical 
landmark frames and bowel cleanliness ratings are recorded.  
 
For each read, the  reader will rate the bowel cleanliness  in the left  colon (cecum and ascending) , 
transverse colon, and right  colon (descending/sigmoid, and rectum)  using the CC- CLEAR 
method and the overall colon cleanliness will be determined adequate or inadequate from these 
ratings using a standardized validated method.[ADDRESS_264894] one annotated 
frame  number  (time stamp ) will be documented on the report. The size of the polyp will be 
measured using the size measurement tool. When necessary, readers will have the option to use 
the software measurement function of combining me asurements , for polyps that are too large to 
be captured in a single frame, or using the output of the size -measurement tool to inform an 
estimated final value, for example by [CONTACT_220527] a fraction of a polyp and scaling the value by [CONTACT_220528]. In other instances, the size 
measurement tool may not be able to make a measurement for reasons such as excessive bubbles or turbidity and t he reader shall make a best estimate of the size and select the final image(s) that 
support the final measurement for each polyp. The polyp size will be recorded in millimeters to one decimal place ( e.g. 11.2 mm or 8.0 mm).  
Only t hose findings which the reader records , not the CADe output, are included in the  CCE  
subject clinical dataset  for compar ison to the OC reference. There will be  at least [ADDRESS_264895] been trained on the reading of 
video captured by [CONTACT_220529]® software. Financial disclosures will be collected on all readers in accordance to [ADDRESS_264896] videos.  
3.8 Colonoscopy and Biopsy  (follow these procedures for initial and/or repeat 
colonoscopy ) 
The Sponsor  will identify, train, and qualify physicians  with reported  adenoma- detection rates 
(ADRs) of at least 25% for both male and female. The colonoscopy and biopsy will be performed according to the clinic’s standard of care by [CONTACT_220530] . Instructions on polyp 
measurement and photography requirements will be provided by [CONTACT_1034] . Study Investigators  
must agree to video record the entire colonoscope withdrawal for every study subject. Each OC performed on study subjects must have a withdrawa l procedure time of at least 6 minutes. Polyps 
will be resected per the site’s standard of care.  
The [LOCATION_011] Bowel Preparation Scale (B BPS) will be used to rate bowel cleanliness of three colon 
sections (right, transverse, and left) during the colonoscopy on the standard scale of 0 to 3. The overall colon cleanness will be rated inadequate if the B BPS score for any of the three colon 
sections is 0 or the total B BPS score (scale of 0 to 9) is less than 5. 
Colonoscopy will be performed during the period starting 3 weeks after capsule ingestion and ending 6 weeks (+2 weeks window) post -ingestion, or, i f it is in the best interest of the subject, as 
determined by [CONTACT_737] , a study subject may instead have colonoscopy the day after 
CapsoCam ingestion, but must be scheduled more than [ADDRESS_264897] 2024

 the colonoscopy, it is recommended that the physician retrieve the capsule and return it to the 
Sponsor . If the capsule is retrieved in the cecum, there is no need for the physician to perform 
steps 3, 5 and 6 listed below  and the capsule video will not need to be read by [CONTACT_941] i ndependent 
reader . 
Subjects will be prepared for colonoscopy according to Investigator instructions.  
The following procedures are specified for significant polyps, where significant polyps are 
defined as  those  estimated to be ≥ [ADDRESS_264898] and to the polyp diagnosis, including the polyp photographs, size estimate, and the colon- segment location. 
7. The location of each significant polyp is recorded by [CONTACT_8791]: cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending/sigmoid colon, or rectum.  
The histopathology report is referred to to determine if a subject has CRC or an a dvanced 
precancerous lesion , defined as an adenoma with at least one of the following characteristics:  
• Size  ≥ 10mm  
• Villous growth (a tubulovillous or villous adenoma)  
• High-grade dysplasia (HGD).  
 
Sessile serrated polyps (SSPs) are counted as adenomas. Advanced neoplasia is considered either cancer or an advanced precancerous lesion . 
Immediately after the colonoscope pull -back is complete, the first CapsoCam
® read results, if 
available, will be unmasked . The  results  list the size, morphology, and colon segment of  all 
polyps detected, and include  at least one capsule image of each. If the Investigator  suspects that a 
significant CapsoCam® polyp was missed by [INVESTIGATOR_86157], but especially if the CapsoCam® results 
include a polyp ≥ 6 mm  or suspected cancer  and no OC polyp of size estimation ≥ [ADDRESS_264899] been missed during OC (and 
confirmed by a member of the CEC as defined in section 3.11.1), this determination will be conveyed to the PI. If a second  colonoscopy is decided to be in the best interest of the subject and 
is performed within [ADDRESS_264900]  can be exited from the study at this point.  
For subjects that complete next -day “Day 1” colonoscopy, capsule results will not be available  
the day of the colonoscopy. In  these cases , once a  capsule report  (either with or without CADe) is 
available and reviewed, if it is determined that a polyp assessed at 6mm or larger  may have been 
missed  during OC (and confirmed by a member of the CEC  as defined in section 3.11.1) , this 
determination will be conveyed to the PI. T he physician and subject  may choose to repeat the 
colonoscopy. If repeat colonoscopy is de cided to be in the best interest of the subject and is 
performed within [ADDRESS_264901] of the colonoscopy and photographs taken during the OC procedure, showing the measurement tool  proximal to the polyps, will be collected from the clinical sites and 
distributed to two independent  physicians  to determine the polyp sizes . Provided that the 
measurements of both readers are within 1 mm, the measurements will be averaged and treated as ground truth for a particular polyp . When the discrepancy between the two size measurements 
exceeds the greater of either  1 mm or 10% of the larger measurement  and the largest 
measurement  is > [ADDRESS_264902] reader will evaluate and measure the polyp in question. In cases 
where one reader selects the CRF option “< 6 mm” and the other reader provides a numerical measurement > [ADDRESS_264903] measurer will also be asked to measure the polyp. For polyps with three measurements, t he median will be used as the final measurement.  
The physician measures the polyps in the photographs using a measurement software application, 
which may include a graphical user interface (GUI) which allows the user to draw one line across the measurement tool and another line across the long axis of the polyp. The software calculates the polyp size from the length of these lines and the known size of the measurement tool . The 
polyp size will be recorded in millimeters to one decimal place ( e.g. 11.2 mm or 8.0 mm). 
If a single photograph is deemed inadequate to make a measurement , either because the entire 
polyp or a sufficient portion of  measurement tool is not  visible , then the reader should refer to all 
  
CLN-CVI- [ADDRESS_264904]’s polyp-size estimation, and the video record of the 
colonoscopy and make a size determination, adjudicating discrepant size values. If the reader cannot confidently estimate the polyp size but can confidently classify it as < [ADDRESS_264905] ≥ [ADDRESS_264906] should be excluded from the endpoint analyses due to “missing size measurement data.” 
3.11 Adverse Events (AEs)  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, independent of its association with the study device.     
Adverse events that start on the day of capsule ingestion (Procedure) through excretion will be recorded on the appropriate CRF. All side effects from bowel preparation, pro-kinetic medication , 
boosters or anything related to colonoscopy ( e.g., anesthesia) will be recorded as anticipated 
observations on the adverse event CRF. Subjects discontinuing prematurely from the study due to an AE that has not yet been stabilized will be managed by [CONTACT_24018]. 
Adverse events that occur during the study will be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF.  Data to 
be collected will include the description of the adverse event, onset and resolution date (or whether the adverse event is ongoing), severity, management/treatment, outcome, and determination of the relationship to the study device and/or procedure (i.e. , Prep , Pro -kinetics,  or 
Booster).  In general, AEs should be reported and classified by [CONTACT_12214] a diagnosis rather than symptoms.     
The relationship of the AE will be coded as follows: 
• Not related : The AE is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effect of another device, 
drug or intervention and is not related to the study device or device procedure. 
• P ossibly related : The causal and/or temporal relationship to the study device or device procedure 
is equally or less likely than other plausible explanations. 
• P robably related : The causal and/or temporal relationship to the study device or device 
procedure is likely or significantly more likely than other plausible explanations. 
• D efinitely related : A clinical event that can only be attributed to the  study device or device 
procedure. 
Severity will be coded as to the degree of severity as follows: 
Mild :  The AE is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], even if it causes discomfort 
Moderate :  The AE causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual activities. 
Severe:  The AE causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities; may be 
incapacitating and may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
All adverse events that occur in the study population (including Serious Adverse Events and 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects) will be tabulated and summarized.  In addition, the 
incidence of all types of adverse events will be reviewed during the course of the study for any 
indications that use of study device confers any unanticipated significant risk.  An unanticipated 
  
CLN-CVI-[ADDRESS_264907] (UADE) is defined by [CONTACT_4760] “any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that 
effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.”   Should any unanticipated adverse device effects occur during the course of the study, 
the Investigator is required to report the events to the Sponsor as soon as possible after learning of the event but no later than [ADDRESS_264908].  FDA and IRB approval will be obtained prior to resuming a 
terminated investigation.  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that:  
• led to a death,  
• led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that:  
• resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury, 
• resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function,  
• required in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
• resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to body 
structure or a body function 
• or led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenit al abnormality or birth defect. 
Note that an elective or pre- planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a condition that did not worsen during the 
study is not an AE. 
ALL SAEs and UADEs should be reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_264909] death, 
a copy of death records, medical records pertaining to the events leading up to the death, and an autopsy report (if performed) should be sent to the Sponsor as soon as possible.   All subject identifiers other than the subject number should be removed from the documents submitted to the Sponsor.  
3.11.1 Clinical Events Committee (CEC)  
The CEC will consist of one to three independent physicians. The CEC will adjudicate all 
reported SAEs.  The CEC will be responsible for review, adjudication, and validation of all

 reported SAEs that occur over the course of the study and subsequent classification of these 
complications as related to the study device, procedure, or other.  If the CEC’s classification differs from the Investigator, Investigator will be notified of the determination.  The CEC’s adjudication is final for all SAEs.  In addition, the CEC will review all deviations that may affect the study endpoints.  The CEC will meet as needed based on the rate of reported events. Members will be  provided data summaries from the clinical study .  
The CEC will also review both capsule report results with the colonoscopy reports for subjects that have colonoscopy on Day 1 as described in section 3.8. The CEC will be provided with all images/video and report documentation from the capsule report and the colonoscopy report when a polyp >[ADDRESS_264911].  In the event of a disagreement between the committee members, a live meeting will be held to discuss the case. If a unanimous agreement cannot be reached, the site will be notified of the conclusion from all members of the committee to better inform their decision regarding repeat colonoscopy. 
3.12 Device Malfunction  
Throughout the study, the Investigator and study staff will report and document all study device deficiencies and malfunctions related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance of the study device.   
This includes reporting of study device deficiencies/malfunctions that did not lead to an AE but could have if:  
1) suitable action or intervention had not been taken, or  
2) if intervention had not been made or 
3) circumstances had been less fortunate.   
If possible, the Investigator should return study devices suspected of deficiency or malfunction to 
the Sponsor for analysis. 
All malfunctions of the study device observed during capsule administration or at the download 
center must be documented on the Device Malfunction/Performance Case Report Form within [ADDRESS_264912] Withdrawal  
Subjects will be advised that they may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time and will be instructed to notify the Investigator immediately if they choose to withdraw.  Subjects may choose to withdraw for any reason and are not obligated to reveal their reason(s) for withdrawal.  Should subjects withdraw prior to the Final Visit, the site will communicate with the subject and exit them from the study .  In addition, subjects may be involuntarily withdrawn by [CONTACT_220531] (e.g., adverse event) 
  
CLN-CVI-[ADDRESS_264913] needs re -intervention. AEs that are study device related (onset after ingestion and 
prior to excretion) and ongoing at study exit will be followed for [ADDRESS_264914].  
3.14 Data Collection and Reporting  
Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) will be used to  capture patient data in the clinical trial . 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_220489] U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other governmental body to review the study subjects’ medical records including any test or laboratory data.  
3.14.1 Reporting of Protocol Deviations :  
A Protocol Deviation Form must be completed for each study protocol deviation (e.g., failure to obtain informed consent, enrolling a subject who does not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, not performing required testing, subject not following the prep regimen, missed follow -up window, 
etc.).  Deviations involving subjects’ rights, safety or welfare should be reported to the Sponsor  
as soon as the Investigator  or other study staff are made aware. IRB’s may require the reporting 
of protocol deviations. The s ite Investigator  and study staff are responsible for knowing and 
adhering to their IRB requirements. 
Deviations will be reviewed regularly by [CONTACT_220532]. 
3.14.2 Confidentiality of Data :  
All information and data sent to the Sponsor, Contract Research Organizations, or the CEC concerning subjects or their participation in this study will be considered confidential.  All data used in the analysis and reporting of this evaluation will be used in a manner without  identifiable 
reference to the subject.   
3.14.[ADDRESS_264915] risk.  Where any discrepancies are noted, they will be resolved with the Investigator and/or an individual designated by [CONTACT_737].  Where the data are incomplete, attempts will be made to obtain the missing data.   
3.[ADDRESS_264916] both an evaluable 
colonoscopy and an evaluable CapsoCam® . This population will be used for all effectiveness 
analyses.   
The following circumstances contribute to procedures that are not evaluable and therefore such subjects will be excluded f rom all effectiveness analyses:  
1. Subjects who fail to undergo either the capsule or OC procedure.  
2. Subjects for whom the capsule did not leave the cecum in [ADDRESS_264917] using the CC -CLEAR 
method.18 The colon is divided into three segments: right (cecum and ascending colon), transverse, 
and left (descending/sigmoid and rectum). In each read, the reader assigns p oints  for each segment 
based on the fraction of the mucosa visualized ( Table 1). If only a portion of a segment is 
visualized because the capsule stopped recording, the score for the segment is based on the percentage of mucosa visualized in  the portion visualized . In [18] t he overall score  for a read  is 
considered  adequate if all segment scores are at least 2.  However, for this study, the cleanliness is 
considered adequate if all segment scores are at least 1.  Otherwise, it is inadequate. Segments not 
included in the video because the camera stopped recording are not counted in the adequacy determination.   
 
Table 1 CC-CLEAR Bowel cleanliness rating per segment  
Points per segment  Percentage of mucosa visualized

2 Between 75% and 89%  
  
CLN-CVI- [ADDRESS_264918] 90%  
 
 
For the exclusion criteria numbered 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, the subject is excluded from the evaluable population if the criterion is met based on either read. For calculating capsule transit for each subject, the first cecal time and excretion time will be the average of the two reads  and t he last 
cecal timestamp is the larger of the two.  
 Safety Population. This population will consist of all subjects who attempted to ingest the capsule, whether successful or not.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_264919] will be considered polyps in 
the analysis . Details of the endpoint analyses will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Coprimary Effectiveness  Endpoint s. The coprimary effectiveness endpoints involve the PPA 
and NPA for detecting polyps ≥ 6 mm.  
 
PPA will be defined, based on all patients for whom OC’s largest (reference) polyp ≥ 6 mm, as follows:
  
– True Positive (TP) if a polyp identified by [CONTACT_220533], per matching rules in section 4.3. 
 
– False Negative (FN) if not  
 
Then  PPA =  TP
TP+FN 
 
NPA will be defined, based on all patients for whom OC’s largest polyp < 6 mm, as follows:  
– False Positive (FP) if CapsoCam identifies a polyp ≥ 6 mm  
 
– True Negative (TN) if not  
 
Then  NPA =  TN
TN+FP

Any reproduction in part or whole without the prior written permission of CapsoVision is prohibited. 
 Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for PPA and NPA using exact Clopper- Pearson 
methodology will be computed.17 The null and alternative hypotheses to be tested are defined in 
Section 4.6.  
Secondary effectiveness endpoints  involving polyp matching. All the secondary endpoints 
involving polyp matching will be analyzed in a manner analogous to the corresponding primary 
effectiveness endpoint, with endpoint- specific definitions of TP, FN, TN, and FP.  
Multi -reader multi -case analysis. A multi- reader multi -case (MRMC) analysis will be applied 
to the secondary endpoin ts comparing the PPA and NPA with and without CADe . The MRMC is 
a case -nested -within -reader split -plot structure with one reader per case,18, [ADDRESS_264921] one of the following 
characteristics:  
• Adenoma of s ize ≥ 10mm  
• Villous growth (tubulovillous or villous adenoma). 
• High -grade dysplasia (HGD). 
 
The histopathology report determines if a polyp is an adenoma, where SSPs are considered 
adenomas,  and if it has villous growth or HGD.   
 
Additional Analyses.  In addition, we will cross- tabulate the size of the largest polyp detected 
with OC by [CONTACT_220534]® using the categories of 0 mm, 
> 0 to < 6 mm, 6 to <10 mm, and > [ADDRESS_264922]. So, for example, a polyp measured to be 5.8 mm in colonoscopy or by [CONTACT_220535] 6 mm before comparison to the 6.0 mm 
threshold and is thus not included in the ≥ [ADDRESS_264923] one polyp ≥ [ADDRESS_264924] polyp will be the reference (index) polyp to which CapsoCam
® detected polyps will be compared. The colon 
segment location of the polyp will be recorded as the cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending/sigmoid colon, or rectum. If two or more OC polyps ≥ 6 mm  in different colon 
segments are of equivalent size (all within 1.[ADDRESS_264925]) and they are the largest in their segment , each will be a reference polyp for a separate CapsoCam
® to-OC-polyp matching 
analysis, and the final matching result for this subject will be the one signifying the best CapsoCam
® accuracy.

 A polyp detected by [CONTACT_220536]® will be a match to the reference polyp if ( 1) its size is within ± 
50% of the reference polyp, and ( 2) its location is in the same segment as the reference polyp or 
it is in an adjacent colon segment. The calculated upper and lower limits of the size matching 
range are rounded to one decimal place before determining if a capsule polyp is in the range. Very large polyps (≥ 20 mm) typi[INVESTIGATOR_220490]

or even two frames, making accurate measurement difficult. Accurate measurement of very large polyps can be difficult in colonoscopy as well. Thus, for purposes of size matching, both study device and reference polyps measured larger than 20mm will be considered 20 mm  for size 
matching . While polyp matching on size will primarily be based on the ±50% rule just described, 
sensitivity analyses will also be conducted in which the size matching will be based on a rule of –50% or larger.  
4.4 Safety Assessment  
Safety will be assessed based on analysis of adverse events (AEs). The frequency and capsule 
relatedness of AEs will be reported and reviewed with CEC and tabulated for reporting purposes . 
4.5 Sample Size s  
Assumptions for sample size calculations : 
• True PPA for detecting polyps ≥ 6 m m without CADe is 69%  
• True PPA for detecting polyps ≥ 6 m m with CADe is 80%  
• True NPA for detecting polyps ≥ 6 m m without CADe is 90%  
• True NPA for detecting polyps ≥ 6 m m with CADe is 86%  
• True sensitivity for detecting advanced neoplasia is 85%  
• One-sided alpha = 0.025  
• Non-inferiority margin of 0.1 
• Within -reader between -test correlation of accuracy measurement errors,  r1 = 0.6 
• Error variances assume a binomial distribution  
• PPA test -by-reader variance = 0.[ZIP_CODE].  
• NPA test -by-reader variance = 0.[ZIP_CODE].  
• Number of readers = 9.  
• Readers read an equal number of positive cases and an equal number of negative cases . 
• More readers increase the study power for demonstrating superior PPA and noninferior 
NPA with random readers. The number of readers is likely to exceed the conservatively assumed value of 9. On the other hand, the number of cases read by [CONTACT_220537] , reducing the effective number of readers. For the sample size 
calculations, these affects are considered counteracting and thus ignored.  
 
Calculated s ample sizes  for each statistically -powered endpoint : 
• Observed PPA for detecting polyps ≥ 6 mm with CADe ≥ 65%, with 99% probability of success: 40 evaluable positive subjects.  
• Observed NPA for detecting polyps ≥ 6 mm with CADe ≥ 75%, with 99% probability of 
success: [ADDRESS_264927] 2024

Any reproduction in part or whole without the prior written permission of CapsoVision is prohibited.  
 • The PPA for detecting polyps ≥ 6 mm with CADe is superior to that without CADe with 
power 90%: 162 evaluable positive subjects. 
• The NPA for detecting polyps ≥ 6 mm with CADe is non- inferior to that without CADe 
with power 90%: 432 evaluable negative subjects. 
• The sensitivity for detecting advanced neoplasia is at least 65%: [ADDRESS_264928] as many cases with polyps ≥ 6 mm as were obtained in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_220491] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_47281])[ADDRESS_264929] one polyp ≥ [ADDRESS_264930] one polyp ≥ [ADDRESS_264931] 700.  
4.6 Hypotheses  
1. Secondary Endpoint #1 –  The null hypothesis is that “true” difference in PPA  
for detecting polyps ≥ 6 m m with  CADe  versus  without CADe  (PPA with CADe 
– PPA without CADe)  is ≤ 0. T he alternative hypothesis is that this difference is 
> 0.  
2. Secondary Endpoint #2 –  The null hypothesis is that “true” difference in NPA  
for detecting polyps ≥ 6 m m with CADe versus  without CADe  (NPA with 
CADe – NPA without CADe) is ≤  -10%.  The alternative hypothesis is that this 
difference is >  -10%.  
3. Secondary Endpoint #3 –  The null hypothesis is that the sensitivity for detecting 
advanced neoplasia with CADe is < 65%. The alternative hypothesis is that it is ≥ 65%. 
4.7 Multiple Comparisons  
A hierarchical testing procedure will be utilized to control the overall study -wise type I error rate 
at the pre- specified one- sided alpha=0.[ADDRESS_264932] non- statistically significant 
result (p -value ≥0.05), and nominal p- values will be displayed for subsequent endpoints.

6. RISK/BENEFIT  ANALYSIS  
The investigational study was designed to assure that the benefits and knowledge gained about the use of the CapsoCam® outweigh the potential risks to the study subjects. CapsoVision has submitted a previous version of this study protocol to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). After review of the submission, FDA issued a decision letter on June 25, 2018 stating that the study would be a non -significant risk (NSR) device study.  
6.1 Potential Risks to Study Subjects  
The following are the possible risks associated with the Capsule Endoscope; some may be rarer than others:  
• Abdominal discomfort while the capsule is passing through the subject’s gastrointestinal tract 
  
CLN-CVI-[ADDRESS_264935] 2024

CONFIDENTIAL  - All information contained in this document is confidential and is the property of CapsoVision.  
Any reproduction in part or whole without the prior written permission of CapsoVision is prohibited.  
 • Injury of the mucosa  
• Bleeding of the mucosa  
• Retention of the capsule (rarely) possibly resulting in obstruction; if this happens, the 
subject may need a procedure or surgery to remove the capsule. Often the capsule will pass with time or after administration of medication.  
• Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_220492]. However, all subjects being enrolled in the study will meet all the eligibility criteria and therefore this study has been designed to minimize this risk to the study subject. 
Retention of the capsule is highly unlikely, but has been reported in subjects with unknown and 
undiagnosed abdominal strictures. Exclusion criteria have been developed to minimize the possibility of a subject being enrolled in the study who has signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal strictures. In the event that a subject experiences retention of the capsule, the capsule may subsequently be excreted by [CONTACT_220538]. In some cases of capsule retention, endoscopic 
retrieval or other surgical intervention might be needed.  
In the event that a subject fails to successfully retrieve and return a capsule within 7- [ADDRESS_264936]’s gastrointestinal system, an abdominal x- ray will be 
performed to determine the location of the capsule. If the x- ray is negative, it will be assumed  
that the subject failed to notice the passage of the capsule during defecation, and that it was successfully excreted. If retention of the capsule is determined, appropriate treatment will be decided and provided by [CONTACT_079]. Depending on the location of the retention, the subject’s medical status and potential risks to the subject, removal may be done via endos copic retrieval or via other surgical methods at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.  
Additional Risks  
The additional risks to study subjects are the risks posed from using the bowel preparation and post-capsule ingestion drugs in this study: NuLYTELY  (or generic version) , SuPrep, bisacodyl, 
simethicone and prucalopride (Motegrity). This increased risk has been mitigated by [CONTACT_220539]. Risks of consuming NuLYTELY and SuPrep and similar sulfate -based prep as capsule boosters are low  and are 
expected to be limited to subject discomfort and mild side effects which are listed below. The risk associated with prucalopride is low and is expected to be limited to subject discomfort and mild side effects which are listed below.  
NuLYTELY is an osmotic laxative indicated for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in adults 18 years of age or older.  
NuLYTELY is provided for use in this study. (contains polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and potassium chloride) is  a prescription medicine used by [CONTACT_220540] a colonoscopy or barium enema X -ray examination. NuLYTELY and 
other osmotic bowel preparations can cause serious side effects, including: Serious loss of body

 fluid (dehydration) and changes in blood salts (electrolytes) in your blood. These changes can 
cause: abnormal heartbeats that can cause death, seizures (can happen even if you have never had a seizure), or kidney problems. Your chance of having fluid loss  and changes in body salts with 
NuLYTELY is higher if you: have heart problems, kidney problems, or take water pi[INVESTIGATOR_220493]-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NS AIDS). The most common side effects of NuLYTELY 
include nausea, stomach (abdominal) fullness, bloating, stomach (abdominal) cramps, vomiting, and anal irritation.  
The use of commercially available, oral solution SUPREP as a booster used in this study. SUPREP (sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate) is an osmotic laxative indicated for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in adults . Nausea, vomiting 
abdominal discomfort/crampi[INVESTIGATOR_220494] (occurring in up to 54% of subjects). Serious but rare side effects include fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, renal im pairment, and mucosal aphthous 
ulcerations.    
The use of commercially available prucalopride, which is indicated for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults is  also used in this study. Prucalopride  induces a 
stimulation of contractile activity in the proximal colon and has been shown to stimulate and amplify giant migratory contraction, which is the high- amplitude type of contraction that initiates 
the urge to defecate. Thus, prucalopride not only a ccelerates the colonic transit but also 
accelerates gastric emptying and small bowel transit. In clinical trials, prucalopride was shown  to 
significantly increase the spontaneous bowel movements when compared with the placebo group. In these studies, as we ll, it was observed a numerical improvement in mean colonic transit 
time and a significant increase in spontaneous complete bowel movement without marked changes in the anorectal function. For purposes of this study, a 2  mg dose is given prior to 
capsule ingestion.  Common adverse reactions reported in clinical trials are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence and fatigue, while less common adverse reactions occurring in < 2% of subjects receiving prucalopride  2 mg once 
daily include: abnormal gastrointestinal sounds, decreased appetite, migraine, and pollakiuria.  
Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials (19 double -blind and 9 open- label) for prucalopride at doses including 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg 
per day in adult subjects with CIC (the recommended dosage of prucalopride for CIC is 2 mg once daily). The total exposure in the double -blind trials was [ADDRESS_264938] -years in the double -
blind and open- label clinical trials.  
In an evaluation of prucalopride by [CONTACT_220541] (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the standardized incidence rate (IR ) per [ADDRESS_264939] -years for 
MACE for prucalopride was compared with the IR for placebo. In the double -blind trials, the IR 
for MACE was 3.5 (2 subjects out of 3366; [ADDRESS_264940] on 4 mg) in the prucalopride group and 5.2 (2 subjects out  of 2019) in the placebo group.  
In the double -blind trials, the IR for MACE was 3.5 (2 subjects out of 3366; [ADDRESS_264941] on 4 mg) in the prucalopride group and 5.2 (2 subjects out of 2019) in the placebo group. When combining the double -blind and open- label trials, th e IR for MACE was 3.3 (9 
subjects out of 4472, doses ranging between 0.5 to 4 mg) for prucalopride.

Additional side effects or adverse events are also possible as a result of the subject taking bisacodyl (10 mg/daily). However, side effects caused by [CONTACT_220542].  
Bisacodyl is used to relieve occasional constipation and to clean out the intestines before bowel examinations. Bisacodyl belongs to a class of drugs known as stimulant laxatives. It works by [CONTACT_220543], causing bowel movements within 6 to 12 hours. Short -term usage of bisacodyl at normally-  prescribed dosages may result in abdominal 
pain or cramps and rarely nausea or vomiting can occur. Rare side effects and adverse events usually associated with higher doses or longer -term use include: rectal bleeding, persistent 
diarrhea, dizziness, decreased urination, muscle cramps and/or weakness, or irregular heart rhythms. A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare, but possible. Subjects should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, or trouble breathing, or any of the unusual side effects noted above.  
Simethicone is an over -the-counter  medication used to reduce bloating, discomfort or pain caused 
by [CONTACT_220544]. There are no reports of s ide effects of this medication and allergic reaction is 
very rare. For this study, simethicone is used the night before and the morning of capsule 
ingestion at 80 mg/dose .  
Subjects  may experience identification of otherwise unnoticed abnormality(ies)  in the colon by 
[CONTACT_220545]® prior to having a colonoscopy. It is also possible that subjects  may 
not experience a clinical benefit from study participation, however there may be a beneficial addition to the body of knowledge for this type of diagnostic tool.

Summary of Prior Clinical Investigations  
 
CapsoCam® SV -1 Capsule Endoscope Clinical Study  
 
The CapsoCam® SV-1 capsule endoscope has been evaluated in a non- significant risk clinical study in the 
[LOCATION_002] and Canada for obtaining 510k clearance from the US FDA per protocol # SV -1. 
 
The CapsoCam® SV-[ADDRESS_264951] was enrolled on March 10, 2014. Of these 121 subjects, 120 (99%) subjects continued 
in the study as part of the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) cohort. One hundred fourteen ( 114, (94%)) subjects made up the 
Per Protocol (PP) cohort defined as subjects who: 1) were part of the ITT cohort; 2) met inclusion and exclusion 
criteria (or received a waiver that allowed enrollment); 3) ingested and retrieved both study capsules; 4) who se 
ingested capsules reached the small bowel; 5) had a primary diagnosis recorded by [CONTACT_220550]; and 6) were without major study protocol violations.  
 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) cohort in the study consisted of 51 (42.5%) males and 69 (57.5%) females with a 
mean age of 55.2 years (SD=15.42), median age of 56 years (range 19- 85). One hundred four (104 (86.7%)) 
self-identified their race as White. The Per P rotocol (PP) cohort subset in the study consisted of forty- seven (47, 
41.2%) males and sixty- seven (67, 58.8 %) females with a mean age of 55.7 years (SD=15.40), median age of 
56.3 years (range 19- 85). One hundred (100, 87.7%) self -identified their race as  White.  
 
Thirteen (13(11%)) of all enrolled subjects experienced fifteen (15) adverse events as reported by [CONTACT_220551]. Twelve (12) of these thirteen (13) subjects were included in the ITT analysis 
cohort.  
 
One subject was not included in the ITT analysis cohort because the subject gagged when attempting to ingest 
the capsule endoscopes and, although enrolled, did not continue in the study.  
 
Two (2) subjects reported experiencing two (2) adverse events each with the remaining ten (10) subjects only 
reported experiencing one (1) adverse event each.  
 
Two (2) of the fifteen (15) adverse events were classified as Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). In both subjects 
from the same investigational site, previously undiagnosed bowel obstructions were present. In both subjects, 
retained ingested capsules were retrieved when surgical procedures to correct the bowel obstructio ns were 
performed. After the surgeries, the Investigator for the site reported no further adverse sequelae for either subject.  
 
The remaining adverse events were largely attributed by [CONTACT_220552] 510(k) clearance of the CapsoCam SV -1 capsule endoscope (K151635) in February 2016.

The CapsoCam® SV-2 capsule endoscope was evaluated in a clinical validation study per the protocol CVN -
CVI-005 for the purpose of validating the safety profile of the SV -2 device and its ability to capture and 
download small bowel images in a manner consistent with the predicate CapsoCam® SV-1 Capsule Endoscopy 
System. The SV -2 Clinical Validation Study was a single center non -significant risk study which enrolled 
subjects with no known or suspected gastrointestinal diseases: “Normal Healthy Volunteers”.  T he SV -[ADDRESS_264953] was enrolled on July 9, 2014. Eleven (11) 
normal healthy volunteers with no known or suspected gastrointestinal disease, seven (7) and four (4) females, 
were enrolled in the study. The mean age of the enrolled subjects was 40 years (range 18 to 71). There were no 
reported adverse events (AEs) in the study.  
 
Subsequent to the clinical validation study, the CapsoCam® SV-[ADDRESS_264954] performance profile.  
 
The CapsoCam® Plus SV -3 capsule endoscope  Clinical Validation  
 
The CapsoVision CapsoCam
® Plus (SV -3) capsule endoscope was evaluated in a clinical validation study per 
protocol CVN -CVI-006 for the purpose of validating the safety profile of the CapsoVision CapsoCam® Plus 
(SV-3) capsule device and its ability to capture and download small bowel images in a manner consistent with 
and comparable to the predicate CapsoCam® SV -2 Capsule Endoscopy System. The SV -3 Clinical Validation 
Study was a single center non- significant risk study which e nrolled subjects with no known or suspected 
gastrointestinal diseases: “Normal  Healthy Volunteers”.  The SV -3 Clinical Validation Study was initiated on 
October 1, 2015 and the fourth phase of enrollment was completed on April 11, 2016.  
 
A total of 49 Subjects, twenty -eight (28) males twenty -one (21) females, were enrolled in the study.  The mean 
age of the enrolled subjects was 37 years (range 19 to 63), were enrolled (Intention to Treat (ITT) population), 
having met the inclusion/exclusi on criteria and signed the Informed consent.7 patients were withdrawn from the 
study: [ADDRESS_264955] did not return his capsule to the Sponsor/Investigator, and was believed to have inadvertently flushed it down the toilet; [ADDRESS_264956] attempted but could not swa llow the CE/gagged after attempting to do so 
over a period of [ADDRESS_264957] procedure.There were no reported adverse events (AEs) in the study.  
 An analysis of the results on the remaining 47/49 (Per Protocol (PP) population) subjects was presented to the 
FDA to obtain 510(k) clearance of the CapsoCam® Plus (SV -3) capsule endoscope (K161773). Overall, the 
CapsoCam® Plus (SV -3) Validation Study CVN -CVI-006 study results demonstrated that the SV -3 Capsule 
Endoscope, as compared to the earlier generation CapsoCam® SV -[ADDRESS_264958] concluded from the study that the quality and clinical utility of the CapsoVision Cap soCam® 
Plus (SV -3) CE device is equivalent to that of the predicate device, SV -1 (K151635).  
 
 
Prior Clinical Validation of CapsoVision Colon Capsule  
 
Two previous early pi[INVESTIGATOR_220496], using an earlier version of the CapsoVision Video Capsule diagnostic system, were performed by 
[CONTACT_220553] (Proto col CV -001); and by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Michael Draelos located in Highpoint, 
NC and [CONTACT_220558] located in Roseville, CA (Protocol CVI -002).

 The study design used with Protocol CV-001 included two cohorts of subjects.  Cohort 1 involved cecum drop 
and Cohort 2 involved oral ingestion.  A total of 11 patients were enrolled in this study between April 1 and 
November 12, 2009.  Eight subjects were enrolled in Cohort 1 and three subjects were enrolled in Cohort 2.  
Evaluation of the capsules returned for assessment for ten subjects (one capsule was lost at Stanford receiving 
department) revealed that bowel cleanliness was not adequate to allow visualization.  Additionally, the desired transit time for the capsule of <12 hours was not achieved.  The inadequate bowel cleanliness and resulting 
prolonged capsule transit time were attributable to the absence of commercially available products indicated for this purpose in the U.S.  The study was discontinued since the effectiveness target defined as identification of 
95% of polyps with diameter ≥ 10mm, comparable to standard colonoscopy, could not be met.  No 
complications, adverse events or unanticipated adverse device effects were reported during this trial.   
 
The other study ( Protocol CVI -002) was initiated to assess the capsule’s safety and visualization and imaging 
capabilities of the colon and the effectiveness of standard bowel preparation.  The study was designed to enroll up to 50 subjects who swallowed the capsule following bowel preparation.  A total of 21 patients were enrolled 
in Highpoint, NC between November 30, 2009 and October 14, 2010 and 22 patients were enrolled in Roseville, CA between January 8, 2010 and October 1, 2010.  Evaluation of the cap sules returned for assessment for the 41 
subjects (two subjects lost the capsule) revealed that bowel cleanliness was not adequate to allow visualization.  The effectiveness target defined as sufficient visualization of the colon to enable identification o f 95% of polyps 
with diameter ≥ 10mm, comparable to standard colonoscopy, could not be achieved. Therefore, the study was discontinued for failure to generate meaningful clinical findings.  No complications, adverse events or unanticipated adverse device e ffects were reported during this trial.   
 The CapsoCam® Colon capsule endoscope  Clinical Validation  
Provided below is a summary of prior clinical performance data regarding an earlier iteration of the subject device - the CapsoCam® Colon (CV-3). This information is being submitted since the CapsoCam® Colon (CV-
3) is the same capsule as the CapsoCam® Colon (CV -2) version E (CV-2E), with the only exception that the 
CV-3 version also comprises the structured light size measurement technology.  
 The clinical feasibility evaluations, which are detailed below, were performed using two different clinical 
protocols: CLN- CVI-[ADDRESS_264960]- CVI-4047. The various iterations of the CapsoCam® Colon (CV- 2) device 
were developed with the intention of improving the visualization ability, user friendliness, and manufacturability of the device. The iterations primarily consisted of altering the balloon or outer shell design, the enteric coating formulation, and/or varying the center of gravity of the capsule.  
  
  
CLN-CVI-[ADDRESS_264961] -CVI-007.  The clinical study evaluated the 
performance of the CapsoVision CapsoCam® Colon capsule in 59 of 79 total enrolled subjects at one (1) 
Investigational Site. The investigational site obtained the necessary IRB approval prior to enrollment of any 
study subject. The majority of screened subjects were considered eligible for the study. After pre -procedure 
preparation, capsules were ingested and retrieved using the CapsoRetreive® system. Fol lowing retrieval of the 
CapsoCam® capsule endoscope, the capsule images were downloaded using the Capsule Data Access System (CDAS3) and read by [CONTACT_220554]® Software (CVV). 
 
Of the 59 subjects who ingested versions A, B, C, or D of the CapsoCam® Colon Capsule during the study, thirty -five (35) are defined as CapsoCam® Colon Capsule Study Completers who: 1) ingested the version D of 
the CapsoCam® Colon Capsule during the study and 2) had complete and interpretable small bowel imaging and imaging of the colonic mucosa. Four (4) subjects not classified as Completers experienced temporary gastric 
or small bowel retention resulting in incomplete or no images of the small bowel and/or of the colonic mucosa. 
One (1) subject not classified as a Completer had uninterpretable images due to technical difficulties with image recording. The remaining nineteen (19) not classified as Completers ingested the version A, B, or C of the 
CapsoCam® Colon (CV - 2) Capsule.  
 The CapsoCam® Colon Capsule Study outcomes and conclusions are based upon analysis of data from the 35 
subjects in the CapsoCam® Colon Capsule Study Completer Cohort defined as subjects who: 1) ingested the 
CV-2 version D of the CapsoCam® Colon Capsule dur ing the study and 2) had complete and interpretable small 
bowel imaging and imaging of the colonic mucosa. The CapsoCam® Colon Capsule version D is the version of 
the capsule for which CE mark is being pursued.  
The conclusions reached through the analysis of the CapsoCam® Colon Capsule Study Completer Cohort are as 
follows:  
Based upon the results of the clinical evaluation in the CapsoCam® Colon Capsule Endoscope Completer 
Cohort (n =35 subjects), the CapsoCam® Colon Capsule Endoscope has been proven to be safe and effective.  
Safety of clinical prescription of the CapsoCam® Colon Capsule Endoscope has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_220555]. There were no capsule retentions defined as subjects 
retaining the capsule after resuming post procedu ral food ingestion. All capsules in this cohort, and the overall 
per protocol study cohort who ingested (swallowed) study capsules, were excreted. In all cases of capsule 
ingestions and excretions, the deflated balloons remained securely attached to the capsules.  
The subjects experienced few adverse events overall with the exception of a small number of anticipated bowel 
preparation and booster regimen adverse events, for example, nausea, limited epi[INVESTIGATOR_220481], and modest 
abdominal discomfort. These bowel -prepa ration related adverse events are known to be possible whenever 
bowel preparations are administered and are well characterized in their manufacturers’ prescription information. All bowel preparation and boosters used in the study and possible adverse event s were described in the protocol 
and to the subjects during the screening and enrollment phases of the study. Virtually all research subjects found 
the bowel preparation and boosters regimens tolerable and stated that they would be willing to undergo colon  
capsule endoscopy again if prescribed by [CONTACT_161009].

 Efficacy of the device has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_220521]® Colon Capsule Endoscope meeting the 
objectives of the study as outlined in the protocol defined information to be gained from the study:  
The CapsoCam® Colon Capsule Endoscope captures diagnostic quality images throughout the small bowel and 
colon, provided the subject (patient) follows the bowel preparation and booster regimen instructions defined for 
optimal use of the capsule. The capsule operational time has been demonstrated to be adequate for the capsule to 
capture both small bowel and colon images during the diagnostic evaluation. And, finally, recorded images are 
successfully downloaded using the Capsule Data Access System (CDAS3) uti lizing the current versions of the 
CapsoView® Software (CVV) in both Mac and PC formats and thus available for physicians to review and 
interpretation of clinical results.  
Clinical protocol CLN -CVI-4047  
The CapsoCam® Colon (CV -2) study is currently being conducted based on clinical protocol CLN -CVI-4047 at 
one (1) investigational site, with the intended use of visualizing the colon mucosa. The clinical feasibility study, 
with anticipated completion Q4 -2020, evaluates the performance of the CapsoCam® Colon (CV -2) (versions D -
G). The investigational site obtained the necessary IRB approval prior to enrollment of study subjects. The 
majority of screened subjects have been eligible for study  participation . After pre -procedure preparation, 
capsules were ingested and retrieved using the CapsoRetreive® system. Following retrieval of the CapsoCam® 
Colon (CV -2), the capsule images were downloaded using the Capsule Data Access System (CDAS) and read 
by [CONTACT_220556]® Software (CVV).  
As of 4 /23/2023, the clinical study has evaluated the performance of the CapsoCam® Colon (CV -2) in three 
hundred ninety- seven  (397) subjects, defined as subjects who were initially screened and signed the study 
consent form. Of these 397 consented subjects, three hundred sixty- nine (369) subjects ingested the 
CapsoCam® Colon (CV -2) during the study. Two hundred forty- four (244) of the 369 subjects ( 66.1%) excreted 
within the target ed time of [ADDRESS_264963] procedural food ingestion and all capsules were excreted 
with the balloons still securely attached. The subjects experienced few adverse events overall with the exception 
of a small number of anticipated  bowel preparation and booster regimen adverse events; for example, nausea, 
limited epi[INVESTIGATOR_220481], and modest abdominal discomfort. These bowel -preparation related adverse events 
are known to be possible whenever bowel preparations are administered and  are well characterized in their 
manufacturer’s prescription information. In addition, one subject had an allergic reaction to the bowel 
preparation (MoviPrep). The patient was administered Benadryl in the emergency room and withdrew from the 
study before ingesting the capsule. Virtually all other research subjects found the bowel preparation and boosters 
regimens tolerable and stated that they would be willing to undergo colon capsule endoscopy again, if 
prescribed by [CONTACT_161009].  
The recorded images from all capsules were successfully downloaded using the Capsule Data Access System 
(CDAS) utilizing the current versions of the CapsoView® Software (CVV) and thus available for the 
independent readers to review and evaluate the imaging  quality. Based on the independent reader reports, who 
rated each region of the colon with a segment score from 0 -3 (where anything above 2 is considered adequate), 
the CapsoCam® Colon (CV -2) captures diagnostic quality images throughout the colon (and the  small bowel), 
provided the study subject follows the bowel preparation and booster regimen instructions defined for optimal use of the capsule.  
In addition, the capsules target operational life (as outlined in the Device Description, Section 3) exceeded the 
total transit times for the one -hundred- forty -nine (149) of the 190 subjects (78.4%) in the CapsoCam® Colon 
(CV-2) Study Completer Cohort.  
Based upon the interim results of the clinical evaluation of the CapsoCam® Colon (CV -2) Completer Cohort (n 
=149 subjects), outlined above, the outcome demonstrates preliminary safety of clinical administration of the 
CapsoCam® Colon (CV -2) versions, as sh own by [CONTACT_220557], and 
effectiveness.

 Finally, out of the 190 subjects who ingested CapsoCam® Colon (CV- 2), fifty -seven (57) subjects ingested 
CapsoCam® Colon (CV- 2) version E, which as discussed above, is exactly the same capsule as CapsoCam® 
Colon (CV-3), with the only exception that the CV-3 version also comprises the structured light size 
measurement technology. The remaining one-hundred- thirty -three (133) subjects ingested one of the other 
CapsoCam® Colon (CV-2) versions (D, F, or G). 
 
Clinical protocol CLN -CVI-5248 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_220497]® Colon capsule and 
inform the larger planned, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397]. One hundred-twelve subjects (112) were enrolled (ingested the 
capsule) at five (5) investigational sites inclu ding locations in [LOCATION_004], [LOCATION_012], Michigan and Ohio. More site 
details are located in Table 1. One hundred-ten capsules (110) were returned after ingestion. Two (2) capsules 
were lost in the study ([ADDRESS_264965] failed to use the retrieval kit), two (2) subjects did not 
complete colonoscopy after capsule swallow (1 withdrawal, 1 anesthesia contraindicated arrhythmia). Two (2) 
capsule videos contained images that were too dim to be of diagnostic quality due to capsule malfunction and 
were  deemed technical failures. One site failed to capture any colonoscopy images or video or provide usable 
polyp size estimates in one (1) subject leading to exclusion. Intent- to-treat analysis includes all [ADDRESS_264966] polyps (which are >6 mm) on colonoscopy were compared to capsule findings according to size and 
location. A match for a subject was considered to have occurred if the largest (reference) polyp > 6 mm 
identified on colonoscopy was matched by [CONTACT_48995] ( + 50%) and location (same or adjacent colon segment) with a 
polyp identified on capsule video. Positive Percent Agreement (sensitivity) and Negative Percent Agreement 
(specificity) were calculated for each reader. The overall PPA/NPA for polyps >6 mm for 105 subjects were 
84.8% and 92.7% respectively with a prevalence of 21.9%. Overall PPA/NPA for polyps >10 mm were 87.5% 
and 99.0% respectively with a prevalence of 7.6%. Detection of sessile serrated polyps > 6mm was also 
analyzed and PPA was 87.5% for both readers with a prevalence of 3.8% in the study. The 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for PPA for polyps > 6 mm was 71.1 - 98.5%.  
Complete examination was considered to have occurred when readers were able to visualize excretion. 
Complete examination was assessed for all returned capsules (110) and was shown to occur in 76% of study 
participants. In two instances the capsules were re moved during next day colonoscopy, while still recording and 
thus were not considered to be complete examinations. 
Capsule safety was confirmed with no reports of device related adverse events, serious adverse events or 
unanticipated adverse device effects. All events and observations reported in the study were not related to the study or related to medications for bowel preparation or to the prokinetic boosters.  There were no serious 
adverse events reported for bowel preparation or booster consumption.  
Based on the results of the study, the safety profile remains the same CapsoCam Colon capsule.

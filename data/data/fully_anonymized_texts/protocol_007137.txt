Protocol: CS2815v4  
Approval Number: IRCM - Approval Date:  
Continuing Review Date: February 24, 2017   1.0  Introduction  
1.1 Rationale for  Evaluation  
The combination of Multi -Polar RF and PEMF technology has been shown in clinical studies to impro ve skin 
laxity, and to treat various skin conditions related to aging and alternate collagen structures such as wrinkles, 
rhytids, etc.  
The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the modified Venus Versa  (MP)2 system™ clinical performance 
in impro ving the mons pubis and labia general skin appearance including skin laxity  and loss of vaginal 
introitus coaptation (normal closure of vaginal opening) and various skin irregularities  using the Freeze 
Diamondpolar applicator.  The safety of an investigati onal applicator for treatment of the vagina will also be 
investigated.  
 
The use of the modified Venus Versa  has been determined to present non -significant risk in accordance with 
21 CFR 812.3 for the intended use in this study, because the device is not:  
 
• Intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a 
subject;  
• Is purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining human life and presents a 
potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a  subject;  
• Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or 
otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the 
health, safety, or welfare of a subject;  or 
• Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.  
 
Furthermore, RF technology has been used previously for the external and internal female genitalia without 
incident or complications, see for exam ple Millheiser LS et al., 2010 ; Sekiguchi Y. et al. , 2013; and Dover RR., 
2002.  (Use of Multi -Polar RF and PEMF technology was already demonstrated to be safe and efficient in 
delivering heat to the tissue (Nils Krueger et al., 2012; Dover J. et al. , 2 014).  The study device therefore poses 
no clinically significant risk to the subjects or operator(s) of the  device.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and according to Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) standards.  
 
2 Study  Design  
This is  a single center, baseline -controlled, prospective study. Ten (10) and up to three hundred (300) subjects 
that meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled from the site’s pool of patients.  Subjects should be female , at 
the age of [ADDRESS_1066224] a  suitable treatment area (e.g. skin irregularities and/or unwanted skin laxity 
in the mons pubis, introitus and/or labia area).  
Subjects will receive three treatments with the study device  and both applicators , at four week intervals, 
followed by [CONTACT_776398] -up visits after the last treatment.

6 Materials  
6.1 Device  Description  
The modifie d Venus Versa  (MP)2 by [CONTACT_10419]. is a non -invasive dermatological treatment system 
based on patented and proprietary (MP)2 technology combines Multi Polar Radiofrequency (RF) and Pulsed 
Magnetic Fields. The RF energy penetrates the skin and resulted in RF -generated tissue heating that has 
known effect on skin laxity1, the magnetic  field that is simultaneously induced increases fibroblast collagen 
production through non -thermal mechanism and contributes to the clinical effect of skin laxity improvement. 
The system is paired with the Freeze Diamondpolar  applicator ( with 4 electrodes ) which will be used to treat 
the mons pubis, vaginal introitus and labia . For the internal vaginal treatments, a n investigational handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]  
(applicator)  will be used , however no change in range of energy modality or amount of energy delivered will 
occur at  any point during the study.

[IP_ADDRESS]   Photography  
Photographs will be taken prior to treatment and throughout the study according to specified time points 
detailed in Table 1, utilizing standard scientific equipment.  
The photos should be taken in a private room or area of the clinic under controlled conditions, including the 
distance, angle, background and lighting in order to achieve high -quality before & after sets. Do not use direct 
illumination. The subject should be placed in the same position each time. As each photograph is taken, it 
should be viewed to ensure that it is in focus and is similar to its baseline counterpart in all technical aspects, 
including lighting, distance and angle.  
For consistency purposes, the same person should ideally take all study  photographs, especially per subject. 
The digital files should follow a consistent standard naming scheme, for example: 001TM_Tx1_Mons Pubis.  
7.5 Treatment  
All patients will receive treatment of  the mons p ubis, labia and vaginal introitus with the Freeze Diamo ndpolar

Protocol: CS2815v4  
Approval Number: IRCM - Approval Date:  
Continuing Review Date: February 24, 2017   applicator . Patients will also receive an internal vaginal treatment with the investigational  
handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] /applicator .  
A dedicated Freeze Diamondpolar applicator will be used for each patient . Each applicator will be clearly 
labeled with the name [CONTACT_73150]. The patient will take the applicator or disposable head with her at the end 
of the first treatment session (Tx1) and will bring it back to the clinic for each of the additional treatment 
sessions (Tx2 and TX3). The applicator should not stay in the clinic possession during the study period .  At the 
end of the study the applicators will return to Venus Concept.    
 
The internal vaginal system consists of an the handheld applicator and disposable  cover.  The applicator  
contains 3 pairs of electrodes that deliver the Multi Polar Radiofrequency (RF) and Pulsed Magnetic Fields 
(PEMF) energy  contained in a plastic housing with thermal sensors for detecting the tissue temperature. The 
disposable cover  comes in 2 sizes to accommodate patient sizes.  
 
Based on the mild nature of treatment, anesthesia is not required. Treatment procedure should include 
positioning of the patient in a manner that enables comfort able  access to the treated anatomical site. Th e 
positioning of subjects during treatment will be contingent on the location of the treated anatomical site.  
The following steps should be followed in each treatment session:  
 
1. Set the treatment parameters (see Venus Versa  (MP)2 User Manual for the Diamondpolar applicator ). 
Set the desired  energy  level  between  10% -35%  according  to the skin type,  severity  of the treated  
condition , treatment area, etc. Set conservative parameters for the first treatment, and then gradually increase 
during treatment or  in subsequent treatments according to desired impact, patient’s comfort, AEs and results.  
2. External t reatment consists of a multiple  passes over the treatment area  with  treatment parameters 
adjusted according to patient’s comfort and temperature measuremen ts by [CONTACT_776411].  
3. Move the applicator over the treated area, to maintain a temperature of 40oC-42oC when treating the 
labia area and 40oC-45oC when treating the mons pubis.  
4. Maintain the temperature of the skin for 10 minutes on the labia tissue or 15 minutes on the mons 
pubis . 
5. Apply ultrasound gel as a lubricant for the internal applicator.   
6. Internal  treatment  consists of insertion of the investigational applicator into the vagina with treatment 
parameters adjusted according to the patien t’s comfort and temperature measurements by [CONTACT_776412]’s thermometers.   
7. Maintain a temperature of between 40oC-45oC for 10 minutes.   
8. After both treatments are complete,  the treated area  will be  examined by [CONTACT_776413] 5 points scale (see Appendix  F). 
9. The assessment of discomfort/ pain based on the subject’s report should also be documented 
immediately after each  treatment  using the VAS . 
 
The normal response to these treatments is transient erythema and edema. If any side effects occur, as 
indicated in the protocol, they will be recorded.  
Applicator cleaning and disinfection : 
At the end of the treatment session the cover for the investigational applicator should be disposed of (as per 
the sit e’s standard operating procedures) . 
Both  applicator s should be thoroughly cleaned using a wet single use cloth with tap water and soap.   After the

disinfection should be done by [CONTACT_776414] s with 
cloth immersed with the disinfectant.  
At the end of the cleaning and disinfection procedure , inspect all applicator external parts if any sign of 
damage to the electrodes or plastic parts appears (i.e. damage to the electrodes cover) do not use this 
applicator and contact [CONTACT_776415].   The Freeze Diamondpolar applicator is then packaged for the 
patient to take home.

recommended to cool the treated are a immediately following treatment with air cooling. Cold packs 
(not frozen) may also be placed on the treated  area.  
2. During the day following treatment, care should be taken to prevent trauma to the treated site: avoid 
hot baths, massage, contact [CONTACT_62879], swimming etc. The skin should be kept clean to avoid 
contamination  or infection;  any mechanical  or thermal  damage  to the area  must  be avoided.  
7.7     Follow -up regimen  
 
Follow -up visits will be combined with treatments visits 2 and 3 and an additional fol low up visit will occur one 
month (±  seven days) after the last treatment as detailed in Appendix A. 
 
8 Study Analysis  Plan  
8.1 Study  Hypothesis  
The study will confirm that the Freeze Diamond Polar applicator is safe for the treatment of the mons pubis , 
vaginal introitus and labia , and will result in improvement in skin laxity and skin irregularities.  
The study will also confirm that the investigational applicator is safe for internal treatment of the vagina.  
8.2 Sample Size  Justification  
The proposed study is a fea sibility study for evaluating the safety and the efficacy of using the Freeze Diamond 
Polar applicator for treatment of  the mons pubis , vaginal introitus and labia anatomical areas  and the 
investigational applicator for treatment of the vagina.  Based on previous experience with other RF devices, we 
believe that the proposed study sample of 10 subjects per each anatomical area (total  of 10) will be sufficient 
to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the treatment and to obtain qualitative assessments of comfort 
levels experienced during treatments.  
8.3 Study  Analysis  
• An intermediate safety report based on qualitative analysis of immediate and short term reaction and 
on AEs will be produced based on analysis of data collected immediately post treatment number one  
of all the enrolled subjects. This data will be used to adjust further treatments parameter. The interim

results, be finalized according to this  protocol.  
• After FU3, the photographs will be sent to independent evaluator s that will grade on a GAI scale the 
change in skin laxity according to photograph of FU3 compare to baseline. Descriptive statistics and 
correlations between variables will be perform ed on these  results.  
• After FU3 the subject assessment on the change in skin laxity on a GAI scale will be analyzed. These 
results will be correlated with the evaluation done by [CONTACT_400240] s in order to learn on 
the relationships between objec tive a nd subjective improvements  assessments.  
• After FU3 all data collected by [CONTACT_776416]/ pain level (VAS) and the 5 -level short term 
response scale results will be analyzed using descriptive  statistics.  
• After FU3, the vaginal pH values will be sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_776392]. These results 
will be correlated with the evaluation done by [CONTACT_400240] s in order to learn on the 
relationships between objective a nd subjective impr ovements  assessments.  
• After FU3, the histology slides and molecular assay results will be sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_776393] (histology slides). These results will be correlated with the evaluation 
done by [CONTACT_776417] s in order to learn on the relationships between objective a nd 
subjective improvements  assessments.  
 
The study reports will provide information for use in research & development, and future planned 
stud ies.  Descriptive statistics and correlation s between variables will be performed.  
 
Safety:   Adverse events reported will be listed, documenting course, outcome, severity, and possible 
relationship to the treatment.  
 
9 Adverse  Events  
9.1 Adverse Events  Definitions  
In this study, an Adverse Event (AE) is any undesirable clinical occurrence (sign, symptom, illness, or other 
medical event), that appears or worsens during the clinical study, or requires medical treatment or 
intervention to a subject, whether it is considered to be device -related or not.  If an adverse event occur s, the 
first concern will be the safety and welfare of the   patient.  Appropriate medical intervention will be made.  
Any AE or complication reported by [CONTACT_776418] s during or after 
treatment with  the device will be recorded in the medical record or source document and on the Case Report 
Form  (CRF) . The investigator will determine if the AEs are device -related or procedure -related. This 
assessment shall include the onset date, resolution date, severity, seriousness, frequency, treatment and 
outcome.  
Each AE should be assessed according to the following criteria:  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_1066243].  
Mild: Awareness of a si gn or symptom that does not interfere with the subject’s activity or is transient 
Confidential  16 
Protocol: CS2815v4  
Approval Number: IRCM - Approval Date:  
Continuing Review Date: February 24, 2017   resolved without treatment and has no  sequelae.  
Moderate: May interfere with the subject’s usual activity and require additional intervention and/or 
treatment, and may have a dditional sequelae.  
Severe: Significant discomfort to the subject and/or interferes with the subject’s activity. Additional 
intervention and or treatment are necessary. Additional sequelae occur. Severe is used to describe the 
intensity of an event experienced by [CONTACT_423].  
 
9.1.2 Relationship of AE to the  Device  
Each AE should be assessed for its relationship to the device or procedure as identified as follows: 
Device: This category should be restricted to adverse events directly attributable to the mod ified 
Venus Concept  Versa  
Procedure: A procedure is any activity that supports the usage of the device  
 
Use the following categories for assigning the certainty of the relatedness:  
Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study agent, there is a reasona ble possibility that the study agent 
caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study agent and event. Reasonable possibility 
means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study agent and the AE.  
 
Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study agent caused the event, 
there is no temporal relationship between the study agent and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been 
established.  
 
9.1.3 Serious Adverse  Events  
NOTE: Th e term serious is not synonymous with severity, which may be used to describe the intensity of an 
event experienced by [CONTACT_423]).  An AE that does not meet any of the below criteria will be classified as 
non- serious.  
A serious AE is any event that:  
• Results in, or contributes to a  death;  
• Is immediately life - threatening (injury or  illness);  
• Results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or prolongs an existing  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
• Results in permanent impairment of body structure or function, or in persistent or significant  
disability/incapacity;  
• Results in an injury that requires medical intervention to prevent permanent impairment of body 
structure or  function;  
• Is a device malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of the device that 
results in death or serious deterioration in  health;  
• Is a device malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of the device that, if 
it were to occur again, could result in death or serious deterioration in  health;  
• Results in a congenital an omaly or birth  defect.  
• Is any medically significant injury, event or experience that requires medical/surgical intervention to 
Confidential  17 
Protocol: CS2815v4  
Approval Number: IRCM - Approval Date:  
Continuing Review Date: February 24, 2017   prevent one of the outcomes listed  above;  
• Results in end - organ toxicity, including hematological, renal, cardiovascular, hepatic, gastrointestinal, 
and central nervous system  events;  
 
9.1.4 Pre-existing  Conditions  
A pre -existing condition should not be reported as an adverse event unless there has been a substantial 
increase in severity or frequency of problems, which has not been  attributed to natural history.  
 
9.1.5 Diagnosis of Adverse  Event  
There should be an attempt to report a “diagnosis” rather than the individual signs, symptoms and abnormal 
laboratory values associated with the diagnosis. However, a diagnosis should be reported only if, in the 
Investigator’s judgment, it is relatively certain (i.e., definite or possible). Otherwise individual signs, symptoms 
and abnormal laboratory values should be reported as the adverse events.  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_1066244].  
 
9.1.7 Unanticipated Adverse Device  Effects  
In the event of a serious (or unanticipated) adverse event, the Investigator will immediately notify the study 
monitor by [CONTACT_756]. If such an adverse event is being reported after normal working hours, the Investigator 
will leave a voice message with accompanying report of the AE.  
9.2 Reporting  
 
9.2.1 Adverse Events (AE) and Severe Adverse Events (SAE)  Reporting

Non -ablative or non -burning RF therapy has been used for vaginal tightening previously within human vaginal 
mucosa at 75 -90 J/m2. (J Sex Med 2010 Sep; 7(9): 3088). For the purpose of this study premenopausal 
patients w ill be treated at 90J/m2, whereas the post menopausal patients will be treated with less cumulative 
heat. We have calculated that the thickness of vagina epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] (the most susceptible tissue to thermal 
injury) is decreased 16% in menopause. (This has be en calculated by [CONTACT_776425][INVESTIGATOR_776396] -menopausal on histomorphometry measurements -J. Sex Med 
2009 Nov 6(11): 3097.) Reducing energy delivery by 16% yields a safe basement level of 75.6 J/m2 for 
menop ausal patients. Again it is important to emphasize the proposed study device has thermal feedback 
safety settings and real -time multipolar thermal control to virtually eliminate the possibility of tissue  
burns. Additionally, now over [ADDRESS_1066257]. Stevan Jovanovich, 
using the proposed study device (Venus Versa) both internally intravaginal and externally. No burns or off 
target damage was appreciated.  
 
On advisement from the IRB committee and combined with the a bove information update; for further patient 
protection we will modify the protocol to perform initial safety parameters on the first 10 patients using 
75J/m2 for premenopausal patients and 90J/m2 for premenopausal patients. If these safety parameters are 
consistent with the preliminary safety studies in Europe, the IRB will review these results, at which time we 
will submit an expanded study of up to 300 for review.  
 
 
SAFETY SOP FOR POTENTIAL BURNS:  
 
The following SOP shall be conformed to at all study fac ilities if a patient experienced any first, second or third 
degree burn or pain beyond narcotics:  
 
1. The event  will be reported  to the study  Director  within  24 hours  of occurrence.  
2. A copy  of the patient  chart  and treatment  parameters  are to be forwarded  to the study  Director  within  24 
hours.  
3. Immediate triage and treatment of the patient shall be determined by [CONTACT_776426].  
4. The study Director will be responsible for issuing a written report to the company and the IRB Chairman no 
later than 7 days from the  incident.  
5. Long  term  follow  up and care  shall  continue  at the discretion  of the treating  physician.  
6. All patients experiencing a complication of the device will be followed a minimum of 2 years follo wing the 
initial  injury.  Longer  care  and observation  will be at the discretion  of the treating  physician.  
7. All minor complications such as appearance or altered sensation, except for pain, can be reported within 30 
days of patient complaint. Both chart and treatment parameters are to be provided to the study Director and 
shared with the company and IRB  chairman.

 4 1.0 OBJECTIVES  
 
In order to reduce the risk of relapse and to improve long -term survival for chronic lymphoid 
malignancies this allogeneic donor stem cell study is designed to answer the following questions:  
 
1.[ADDRESS_951767] blood donors result in timely, complete and durable engraftment in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_701177]?  
 
1.2 What is the incidence and g rade of acute and of chronic GVHD observed following 
such allogeneic transplant?  
 
1.[ADDRESS_951768] accompanying unrelated or partially 
matched donor allogeneic transplant reduce the incidence of relapse for these high risk 
malignancies?  
 
2.[ADDRESS_951769] as compared with sibling donor bone marrow.  Matched unrelated donor marrow transplants 
yield results for various diseases that are either similar to or slightly inferior (10 to 15 per cent more 
frequent complications and mortality) compared to sibling donor BMT.  However even with the 
extended resources of the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) not all patients have an 
available sibling or unrelated adult donor marrow available.  Umbi lical cord blood, perhaps because 
of its immunologic immaturity and greater ease of establishing immunologic tolerance with tissues of 
the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], might provide allogeneic cells available for transplantation for those patients lacking an 
unrelated or re lated adult donor for transplantation.  Additionally, UCB might be associated with less 
risks of Graft versus Host Disease and thus lower peri -transplant related mortality.  
 
As an additional option, partially matched (haploidentical) stem cells from a rela ted donor would 
provide a source for allo -transplantation for nearly all other patients.  Though clinical experience is 
less, haploidentical BMT yields similarly increased risks of graft failure, GVHD, and post -transplant 
immunodeficiency yet can be perfor med promptly, with a large cell dose for nearly all patients using 
either parents, most siblings or the patient's children as obligate at least halploidentical or better 
donor.  
 
For treatment of advanced lymphoproliferative disease including non -Hodgkin's Lymphoma, 
Hodgkin's disease, Multiple Myeloma, and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, both allogeneic and 
autologous transplantation have been used widely.  For early stage patients such as those in PR1 or 
 5 CR2 PR2, some categories of Hodgkin's Disease and non -Hodgkin's Lymphoma can be effectively 
cured in sizable fractions of patients using auto transplantation.   For patients with more advanced 
disease, for low grade lymphoma, for mantle cell lymphoma, myeloma, and CLL, autografting is not 
widely accepted as po tentially curative therapy, though published experience suggests its potential 
value in achieving extended remission duration.  
 
In contrast, allogeneic transplantation for these advanced lymphoproliferative diseases has resulted in 
extended relapse free or  progression free survival for a substantial number of patients suggesting the 
curative potential of these allogeneic approaches.  In this trial, we propose to evaluate unrelated or 
partially matched related donor stem cells either from adult unrelated don or marrow available 
through the NMDP or unrelated donor umbilical cord blood cells to facilitate allogeneic 
transplantation for patients who are poor candidates for autografting and have no available matched 
related donor.  Evaluation of the success of pro mpt engraftment, acute and chronic graft versus host 
disease, overall peri -transplant mortality and extended disease free survival will be evaluated in 
contrast with other experience using matched related donor hematopoietic stem cells for 
transplantation.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_951770] advanced Hodgkin's disease, non -Hodgkin's lymphoma, myeloma, or 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Patients will receive standard acute GVHD 
prophylaxis with a combination of methotrexate and cyclosporine, or, if eligible, 
alterna tive GVHD prophalaxis.  
 
We will assess engraftment, time to engraftment, incidence and severity of acute 
GVHD, incidence and severity of chronic GVHD, development of unusual GVHD 
syndromes; post -transplant infections, lymphoproliferative disease and immune  
reconstitution; survival and persistence or relapse of malignant disease.

cGy over four days at 10 to 19 cGy/minute prescribed to the midplane at the

day prior to conditioning and on day zero unless hyperuricemia (>10 mg/dl) persists.  
 
4.2.2 Vigorous intravenous hydration (2000
 3000 ml/m2/day) should be given from [ADDRESS_951781] 200 ml/two hours to 
maintain appropriate fluid balance.  Patie nts should be weighed b.i.d. during

6.0 TOXICITIES AND C OMPLICATIONS  
 
6.1 Cyclophosphamide:  is manufactured and commercially available in the [LOCATION_002].  
 
Hemorrhagic cystitis may occur following the use of cyclophosphamide despi[INVESTIGATOR_701181], frequent voiding and Mesna.  
 
Cyclophosphamide can cause fatal c ardiac necrosis with clinical irreversible heart failure.  
EKG changes are not infrequent and reduction in EKG voltage may be observed.  Patients 
previously treated with anthracyclines or with mediastinal irradiation may be at higher risk.  
Cyclophosphamid e (with or without irradiation) may also induce pericarditis.  
 
Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are frequent following high doses of cyclophosphamide.  
Aggressive anti -emetic therapy, including Ondansetron, may be helpful in minimizing this 
problem.  
  
Alopeci a is common.  It is usually reversible, but changes in hair color or texture after 
regrowth may occur.  
 
Skin rash may occur, but is infrequent.  
 
Sterility:  Permanent sterility is likely at this dose of cyclophosphamide, particularly when 
given with other drugs and/or irradiation.  
 
6.2 Total body irradiation  
 
1320 cGy is administered in 8 fractions over 4 days.  Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are 
common.  
 
Generalized mild cutaneous erythema is frequently seen.  
 
Parotitis may occur.  
 
Lung:  Inflammatory pneum onitis or even respi[INVESTIGATOR_701182].  Late respi[INVESTIGATOR_701183] a small fraction of patients.  
 
Sterility:  Sterility is common after this dose of total body irradiation.  
 
Brain damage can d evelop in a small fraction of treated patients.  
 
6.3 Busulfan  Oral and IV Busulfan are manufactured and commercially available.  
 
6.3.1  Action:  a bifunctional alkylating agent  
 
6.3.2  Supplied as:  2 mg tablets for oral use only or as IV formulation (busul fex) 
 11  
6.3.3  Toxicity:  myelosuppression, mucositis, diarrhea, alopecia, pulmonary fibrosis, 
amenorrhea, azoospermia, hepatitis, veno -occlusive disease, seizures  
 
6.4 Myelosuppression  
 
Both the chemotherapy + TBI, or the chemotherapy only conditioning indu ce significant 
myelosuppression requiring reinfusion of viable hematopoietic stem cells for prompt marrow 
recovery.  During the period of myelosuppression and pancytopenia, the patient is highly 
vulnerable to infection and/or bleeding.  Irradiated red cell  transfusions will be given to 
maintain adequate oxygen delivery and platelet transfusions will be given in an attempt to 
prevent bleeding.  Various isolation and prophylactic measures to reduce risks of infection 
and to vigorously treat any infections wil l also be required.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_951785] Disease (GVHD)  
 
Infusion of allogeneic cells may be associated with development of acute and/or chronic 
GVHD.  An attempt to reduce incidence and severity of GVHD  will be made by [CONTACT_701191] (MTX) and cyclosporine  (CSA), which are 
both commercially available  or other GVHD prophylaxis.  Cord blood recipi[INVESTIGATOR_701184] (mycophenyla te mofetil) from day -3 to +[ADDRESS_951786] the prevention of GVHD.   Acute and chronic 
GVHD will be treat ed according to established protocols.  
 
6.7 Second Malignancy  
 
The potential carcinogenic effects of the pre -transplant chemotherapy and/or radiation may 
compound any inherent risks of second malignancy already induced by [CONTACT_701192].  Both late second epi[INVESTIGATOR_701185] -
associated neoplasms (particularly myelodysplastic syndrome and/or leukemia) may develop 
after transplantation.  
 
6.8 Reporting of Adverse Reactions:  It is the responsibility of t he investigator to report all 
adverse reactions, or suspected adverse reactions.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_701186] -investigators, are responsible for assessing all adverse events, then 
classifying the toxicity according to the protocol  designed toxicity scale.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_951787] model.  Results will be 
compared to historical data of bone marrow transplantation from histocompatible related 
donor allogeneic bone marrow or blood stem cells.

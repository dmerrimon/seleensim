Basic Study Information
 
1. * Title of study:
AAT + tDCS to reduce cue-induced craving and smoking behavior
2. * Short title:
AAT+tDCS
3. * Brief description:
Smokers are highly reactive to smoking-related stimuli and report that this cue
reactivity (CR) is a major obstacle to quitting. To date, no pharmacologic methods
attenuate CR, and attempts to diminish it with traditional cue exposure treatment
(CET) have not proven ef fective. The proposed study will test a highly novel cue-
based smoking treatment adjunct combining an Approach/A voidance Task (AA T)
with brain stimulation via tDCS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)
during personalized multi-cue exposure; the goal of which is to discover an ef fective
means of reducing cue reactivity and daily smoking, and increasing intent and
confidence to quit, among high treatment-interest smokers.

DC-
StimulatorAn IDE application (G150197) was submitted to the FDA  on August 14 (recieved by [CONTACT_653682] 9, 2015). The
FDA has determined that the proposed study is a nonsignificant risk device study because it does not meet the definition of
a significant risk (SR) device under §812.3(m) of the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulation (21 CFR 812). The
letter from the FDA  is attached under the "other attachments section". Overall, there are no significant risks associated with
tES as all risks are very unlikely and minimally serious. Several investigators have examined the safety aspects associated
with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). For example, Iyer et al. (2005), applied 1 and 2 mA  anodal, cathodal,
and sham DC stimulation to the left prefrontal cortex for 20 minutes while clinical EEG was recorded. Participants were
encouraged to report any discomfort or subjective sensations while undergoing stimulation. These researchers observed
no aversive EEG abnormalities resulting from DC stimulation, and no participants asked to stop the study or reported any
significant discomfort. Dif ferences in mood between sham and stimulation were assessed using the V isual Analog Mood
Scale (V AMS) that measures subjective reports of anger , anxiety , confusion, energy , fright, happi[INVESTIGATOR_008], sadness, tension,
and tiredness. The investigators found no measurable ef fects of stimulation on participants' V AMS scores. Based on their
findings, they conclude that limited exposure to direct current stimulation between 1 and 2 mA  is a safe procedure in
healthy participants. In another study conducted by [CONTACT_653683], Hummel, and Cohen (2006), tDCS and sham were compared
in healthy volunteers and chronic stroke victims. Discomfort was measured using a 10 point scale, where 1 represented no
discomfort and 10 represented extreme discomfort and pain. These researchers report transient and mild discomfort of
sensations (12 on the 10 point scale) that weren’t significant between sham and stimulation conditions, nor between
healthy volunteers and stroke victims. Safety and tolerability of tES has also been examined in adults with schizophrenia
(Brunellin et al., 2014), as well as childhood onset schizophrenia (Mattai et al., 201 1). tES in these studies was wel
ltolerated by [CONTACT_4317], and no adverse events were reported. Recently , safety of other forms of tES have been
thoroughly examined. Chaieb et al. (2014) examined assessed safety aspects of Sinusoidal transcranial alternating current
stimulation (tACS) by [CONTACT_653684] (NSE) levels, examining electroencephalogram (EEG) traces and
analyzing anatomical data by [CONTACT_653685] (MRI). tACS was delivered at 5 kHz applied for 10 min at
1 mA  intensity over the hand area of the primary motor cortex. No changes were detected in NSE levels, no structural
alterations were observed in the anatomical scans and no pathological changes were found in the EEG recordings.
Additionally , Zaghi et al. (2010) administered various behavioral and neuropsychological tests during tACS. tACS was not
associated with any cognitive adverse ef fects and had no harmful ef fects on motor function (Purdue Pegboard Test, Finger
Tappi[INVESTIGATOR_190458]). Moreover , tACS was not associated with pain, mood, or anxiety . DCSTIMULA TOR has a Maximum V oltage
Limitation of +/- 20V . The output circuit of the constant current source of the DCSTIMULA TOR is equipped with an electrical
fuse which limits the current to 5 mA. Therefore, in any faulty condition and during normal operation, the fuse will become
open circuit if the current exceeds 5 mA  by a significant amount. The higher the current exceeds 5 mA  the faster it will
become open circuit. This means that it is impossible for the participant to recieve a harmful level of current, even in cases
of equipment malfunction. To avoid thermal discomfort and possible skin damage, the German authority (Bundesanstalt für
Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte) gives a limit of 0.1 mA/cm² for DC current applications. The largest current density we
will use here is 0.08 mA/cm². W e will monitor participant discomfort throughout the administration of tES. If at any point the
participant reports perceived heat, tingling, or itching at the site of the electrodes as 8 or higher on a 10point scale, tES will
be stopped immediately . The Co-I, Cof fman, has administered tES to over 250 research participants in previous studies at
the University of New Mexico, with only two adverse events, one of which was due to latex allergy , and the other was due
to small electric shock caused by [CONTACT_653686]. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_653652] f /Co-I's will administer tES
here, and individuals with latex alergy will be excluded. The Neuroconn stimulator used here is robust, so we do not
anticipate this to be a problem here.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Evidence of
efficacy across past work, including some from our research team include the following: Past work has shown that brain
stimulation with tDCS during CR further enhances cognitive training, as cognitive ef fects of tDCS are largely dependent
upon the cognitive faculty being engaged at the time of stimulation (Bradnam, Stinear , Lewis, & By[CONTACT_653687] , 2010). W e found
enhancement of alerting attention network function measured by [CONTACT_653688], a measure of proactive
cognitive control, more than an hour after anodal tDCS directed at right inferior frontal gyrus (Falcone, Cof fman, Clark, &
Parasuraman, 2012). tDCS was paired with complex object detection training, which is thought to engage cognitive control
networks in the brain. Further , tDCS directed at right frontal cortex has been used to increase reactive cognitive control in
the stop-signal task (SST) as evidenced by [CONTACT_653689] (EEG)(Jacobson, Ezra, Berger , & Lavidor , 2012). Thus, we plan to use CR + tDCS as a means of
further enhancing cognitive control among smokers with schizophrenia. Three tDCS studies(Boggio et al., 2009; Fregni et
al., 2008; Grundey et al., 2012) in healthy non-quitting smokers (randomized, active vs. sham 1-5 training days) targeting
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) found dose dependent reductions in cue-induced craving and smoking behavior .
tDCS has also been shown to significantly enhance the ability of smokers to resist the urge to smoke( Falcone et al., 2016).
Our recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (N=6) found that weekly group sessions of 30 minutes of mindfulness + tDCS of the right IFG,
followed by 60 minutes of mindfulness + counseling led to a significant 50% reduction in cigarettes per day at the end of
treatment (d=0.50; Witkiewitz et al., 2015). However , CR will be used in this present study , not mindfulness, as it targets
multiple aspects of cognition, and has shown greater ef ficacy to enhance cognitive deficits among patients with psychosis
(d= >1(Hogarty et al., 2004) vs. d=.41 (Khoury , Lecomte, Gaudiano, & Paquin, 2013)respectively).

Study Aims
1. * Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives and state the hypotheses
to be tested:
Specific aims:
For decades addiction researchers have known that stimuli linked to smoking can
evoke intense craving to smoke, but have failed to discover an ef fective means of
reducing this persistent source of relapse risk.
Although nicotine replacement therapy reduces "abstinence-induced craving,"
brought on by [CONTACT_653693], it fails to decrease the intense craving evoked by
[CONTACT_653694]-related stimuli, or “cues." Smokers
regularly report that cue-induced craving derails their quit attempts, and research
shows that confrontation with one’ s smoking cues in the natural environment
increases the odds of lapsing and/or relapsing. However , past
cue-exposure treatments (CET) to reduce cue reactivity (CR) consistently fail. Three
clear CET  methodological weakness likely drive that failure. First, CET  traditionally
includes only cues most closely linked to smoking, or proximal cues (e.g., lit
cigarettes, lighters). W e have repeatedly found that distal cues (i.e., people and
environments) evoke more robust cue reactivity . A lit cigarette will make most
smokers crave, but one’ s smoking
friends (people cue) or car on the way to work (environment cue) evoke much
stronger craving and increase subsequent smoking. Reactivity is further enhanced
when cues are combined. Yet, no CET  has ever included
these personal cues. Second, CET  involves passive cue exposure. Smokers are
repeatedly exposed to proximal cues while refraining from smoking until their CR
diminishes. Although rooted in animal drug extinction studies, this method does not
translate well to the cue-rich experience of human smokers or prepare them to
encounter the panoply of smoking triggers in their daily lives. Thus, CET’ s failure is
not surprising, and it will continue to fail until personal cues are targeted and
smokers are trained to actively reject their well engrained approach tendency to
such cues. The Approach/A voidance task (AA T), is an active behavioral method of
cue re-training involving pushing away (rejecting) stimuli during exposure. This
method engages the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), a region of the brain
linked to cognitive control over drug use decisions and motivations, making it an
excellent candidate for our third CET  improvement; namely brain stimulation to
bolster cue re-training. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-
invasive means of increasing excitability in cortical brain regions. tDCS targeting the
PFC has shown encouraging results in reducing smoking CR as a standalone
treatment; however , studies of other disorders suggest greater ef ficacy when it is
combined with a behavioral task that engages the same brain region being
stimulated. Thus, combining PFC-targeted tDCS with AAT cue
re-training, should provide a synergistically robust means of reducing smokers’  CR
to personal smoking cues. W e hypothesize that AAT and tDCS applied to the dlPFC
will each attenuate smokers’  reactivity to personal combined smoking cues, indexed
as cue-induced craving, smoking topography , and attentional bias (behavioral
Stroop and neurophysiological EEG), and that the combination of AAT+tDCS will
prove
synergistically ef fective. W e will also examine the impact of these methods on quit
intention and confidence in quitting and reduction in cigarettes per day (cig/day)
from pre-post training, and at 2 follow ups. W e will explore
sex and other individual dif ferences as moderators of this new CET’ s efficacy . Eighty
high treatment-interest smokers will receive one of four training conditions:
AAT+tDCS, AAT+sham tDCS, Active control (AC)+ tDCS, or AC+sham tDCS.
Baseline assessment and re-test of reactivity variables will occur following 5
AAT/tDCS sessions of personal combined-cue exposure, with follow-up
assessments of cig/day , intent and confidence to quit at [ADDRESS_877114]-
training.
Our specific goals are:
Aim 1: Determine the ef fectiveness of AAT and tDCS to attenuate cue-induced
craving and attentional bias to personal smoking stimuli. AAT, tDCS, and combined
AAT + tDCS will each lead to greater
reductions in pre-post training cue-induced craving and improved behavioral
(quicker reaction time) and neurophysiological (lower P300 ERP) measures of
attentional bias for smoking cues over the control condition.
Aim 2: Determine the ef fectiveness of AAT and tDCS to reduce cue-provoked
smoking behavior and daily smoking, and to increase intent and confidence to quit.
AAT, tDCS, and combined AAT + tDCS will
each lead to greater pre-post-training reductions in smoking topography measures
(latency to light & puf f volume) assessed during cue exposure, as well as reduced
cigs/day and increased confidence and intent to
quit from pre-training to post-training and 1-week & 1-month follow-up over the
control condition.
Aim 3: Examine if changes in reactivity to smoking-related cues (Aim 1) are
associated with posttraining reductions in smoking topography and/or cig/day and
increases in intent and confidence to quit. (Aim 2). Reduced craving and attentional
bias to smoking stimuli across all groups will be associated with reductions in
smoking topography post-training, as well as post-training and follow-up changes in
cigs/day and confidence and intent to quit Secondary Aim: Explore sex and other
individual dif ferences as moderators of outcome measures to explore who might
benefit most from AAT and tDCS methods.
There have been few recent innovative approaches for alleviating cue-induced
craving to smoke. AAT and tDCS are two promising methods to newly apply to this
endeavor . Although this exploratory work is not fully powered to detect significant
interaction ef fects of AAT and tDCS, we will examine the size of the interaction to
inform potential ef ficacy trials of combined AAT + tDCS vs the individual therapi[INVESTIGATOR_653655]. The results here will thus guide a future RCT  of novel CET  methodology
within a cessation trial aimed at helpi[INVESTIGATOR_653656].

SIGNIFICANCE
Obstacles to quitting smoking. Smoking accounts for upwards of 400,[ADDRESS_877115] current smokers report a desire to quit, but
cessation rates with any treatment rarely exceed 30%.
Cessation failure is often attributed to abstinence-induced craving during nicotine
withdrawal. However , studies of nicotine replacement therapy (NR T) show that even
when smokers are given nicotine at levels comparable to smoking, over 70% still
relapse. Thus factors other than the pharmacological ef fects of nicotine clearly play
a crucial role in smoking behavior . One such factor , frequently studied but not well
understood, is reactivity to smoking cues. Considerable research demonstrates that
stimuli present during smoking gain associative properties, which when later
encountered in the absence of drug reinforcement (e.g., nicotine) induce robust urge
to smoke (i.e. cue-induced craving). Recent cue reactivity (CR) studies show that
cue-induced craving predicts immediate subsequent smoking, as well as speed and
volume of actual smoking. Unlike abstinence based craving, cue-induced craving
and smoking is not reduced with nicotine replacement and can continue long after
physiological nicotine withdrawal abates. Moreover , smokers report that smoking-
related cues are a vital aspect of their dif ficulty or inability to stay quit,15 making it
even more unfortunate that, to date, no ef ficacious treatment exists to attenuate this
unrelenting source of relapse risk.
New methods to reduce cue-induced reactivity . If reactivity to smoking-related cues
is a factor driving craving and inhibiting a smoker's ability to stay quit, then, as many
researcher purport, extinguishing CR through
repeated unreinforced exposure to smoking cues (i.e., cue exposure treatment;
CET) should increase cessation success. However , traditional CET -based
treatments have consistently failed to attenuate CR or increase smoking cessation
rates. To improve CET , researchers have suggested that, given the link between
cognition, craving, and relapse, cue-based treatments should focus on training
cognitive control to reduce cue reactivity . Moreover , empi[INVESTIGATOR_653657]. Thus, we have identified three key reasons for past CET  failure, as well as
three techniques, exploiting new technology , to remedy CET .
1) Targeting just proximal cues is not adequate. Regardless of drug or cue
presentation mode (e.g., pi[INVESTIGATOR_236097], in vivo), the majority of CR studies and CET s have
targeted smokers’  reactivity to proximal cues, cues most closely linked to actual drug
administration (e.g., cigarettes, lighter). However , our research clearly shows that
distal stimuli present during smoking also gain associative control over craving.
Specifically , the
actual environments and people in a smoker's life, through repeated pairing with
smoking, can alone, in the absence of proximal cues, trigger strong cue-induced
craving, and immediate smoking. When exposed to pi[INVESTIGATOR_653658], as well as standard smoking and
nonsmoking environments, personalized smoking environments significantly
enhanced smokers’  self-reported craving over all other cue combinations. In another
study , viewing personal smoking environments increased BOLD signal in multiple
brain regions associated with craving to smoke, corresponding to higher self-report
cue-induced craving (F(2,180)=18.32, p<.0001). Yet another study using pi[INVESTIGATOR_653659]’  friends and acquaintances around whom they do or do not smoke revealed
both enhanced craving to pi[INVESTIGATOR_653660], and a significant
inhibitory response on craving to people around whom they do not smoke. Most
recently , we found that combining proximal and personal environment smoking cues,
led to the greatest increase in cue-induced craving and smoking topography
(indexed as latency to light, # of puf fs, and puf f volume during cue exposure). Thus,
CET incorporating only proximal cues and standard, not personal, stimuli fails to
capture the multitude of cues that bring about smokers’  strongest cue-induced
craving and actual smoking behavior . As noted by [CONTACT_653695], in order to adequately
reduce reactivity to cues, the cues targeted must be those that evoke the strongest
reactivity . Our past work suggests that combining multiple personalized cue types
lead to the greatest increases in cue-induced craving and smoking. These cues
must be targeted in any treatment adjunct aimed at attenuating smokers’  cue
reactivity .
2) New learning requires more than just unreinforced exposure. Most CET s involve
passive exposure to cues while repeatedly refraining from smoking. However , active
re-training may prove much more ef fective in reducing CR. The approach/avoidance
task (AA T) specifically targets attentional biases toward visual stimuli. The AAT, by
[CONTACT_653696][INVESTIGATOR_653661] a joystick, can
reduce reactivity to smoking stimuli, specifically attentional bias, as well as daily
smoking. This
approach/avoidance retraining method is based on cognitive embodiment theories,
which have demonstrated the ef fects of motor actions on cognition. Arm movements
during AAT activate motivational systems in the brain: Arm flexion (approach
behavior) activates a reward motivation system, whereas arm extension (avoidance
behavior) activates a motivational system involved in processing possible threats.
Avoidance behaviors call for vigilance and controlled action. Because of this
repeated association, avoidance behaviors may lead to greater recruitment of
resources. Repeated exposure to smoking-related stimuli while smoking strengthens
appetitive responses, which leads to the development of automatic approach
tendencies, most often indexed as attentional
bias, to smoking-related cues. Smokers demonstrate a strong approach bias toward
smoking stimuli that is not present in ex-smokers, a bias which has been implicated
in the maintenance of smoking behavior and
likelihood of relapse. Neurologically , regulated avoidance responses during AAT
(e.g., smokers avoiding smoking stimuli) leads to stronger activation in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) indexed as lower
deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb).[ADDRESS_877116]-AA T training.
Thus, multiple exposures that involve active re-training of motor responses to cues
(executing an avoidance response by [CONTACT_653697])
should activate the PFC and result in cognitive-control-mediated changes in CR
(reduced craving and smoking). This more active and robust extinction training
should better generalize to decision making when faced with personal smoking
cues.
3) Non-invasive brain stimulation to bolster new learning. Transcranial Direct Current
Stimulation (tDCS), is a safe, non-invasive method of brain stimulation that can
enhance cortical excitability and help attenuate cue-induced craving. Animal studies
show clear neurophysiological ef fects of tDCS, where anodal tDCS enhances and
cathodal tDCS reduces neuronal excitability . Human pharmacological studies
confirm these results. Thus, tDCS has become increasingly popular in clinical and
neurocognitive research with known neurobiological targets, showing promising
efficacy in reducing drug craving, auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia,
depression, Parkinson’ s disease, stroke, and cognitive enhancement in healthy
subjects. tDCS of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) reduces cue-induced craving and daily
smoking by [CONTACT_653698]-making and cognitive control. Most important to
note, although ef fective as a standalone treatment for reducing cue-induced craving,
the ef fects of tDCS are greatly enhanced when stimulation is paired with tasks that
engage the brain processes that underlie the targeted behavior . Thus, we purport
that AAT during cue exposure, which engages the dlPFC, is a prime candidate for
augmentation with PFC-targeted tDCS. Enhanced excitability in PFC during AAT
should improve ability to dynamically recruit
cognitive control systems during avoidance behaviors, aiding in the retraining of
smoking-related cue valence. Thus, ef fects of AAT+tDCS on CR to smoking cues
and behavior should be synergistically more ef fective.
The decision to target PFC comes from its repeated implication as a key seat of
cognitive control over craving, particularly cue-induced raving. Although several
brain regions, notably the ventral striatum (VS),obitofrontal cortex (OFC), and
anterior cingulate cortex (AAC) are
activated during exposure to drug cues, particularly during cost/value
assessments, the PFC is hypothesized to combine these
valuations with other information, such as drug context/availability and prior
outcomes. Imaging studies reveal that VS activation during cue exposure increases
craving, and activation of the PFC during cue exposure downregulates the VS
resulting in attenuation of craving Studies of PFC-targeted tDCS further support this
link. In three studies of non-quitting smokers (randomized to active or sham for 1-5
days), stimulation of dorsolateral PFC (dlFPC) led to dose-dependent reductions in
cue-induced craving and daily smoking (i.e. ef fectiveness increased with number of
sessions, 30% fewer cigs/day). tDCS also enhances ability to resist the urge to
smoke. In our recent study , weekly group sessions of 30min of Mindfulness + tDCS
(targeting rPFC), followed by 60min of Mindfulness + counseling led to a significant
50% reduction in cig/day at the end of treatment (d=0.50), with individuals reporting
greater control over craving after treatment. Given our focus on attenuating cue
reactivity here, we will include AAT, not mindfulness. In AAT, avoidance behaviors
have been shown to signal the recruitment of cognitive control centers in dlPFC, a
likely component in its ef fectiveness. Thus, enhancement of dlPFC excitability with
tDCS, and retraining approach/avoid biases to one’ s most salient personal smoking
cues, are both promising methods that target PFC activation, and their combination
may further enhance reductions in smokers’  cue reactivity and other outcome
measures. Of note: Studies have examined left or right dlPFC as a stimulation
target, with one study comparing both, with no dif ference as a function of
lateralization. W e propose right side stimulation based on our past success targeting
right PFC. tDCS, Attention, and Craving in alcohol and food: Aside from the smoking
studies reviewed above, a few
studies on the impact of tDCS on attentional bias and craving for food and alcohol
cues are worth noting. These studies found largely null results, albeit with methods
starkly dif ferent than those proposed here. Further , CR
varies by [CONTACT_9934]/substance of choice, with reactivity to alcohol and food cues being
notably less robust and less af fected by [CONTACT_653699]. One
alcohol study , found no ef fect of 1 weekly tDCS session
for 4 weeks on attentional bias and craving in college drinkers, and three others,
also using limited tDCS, showed no changes in attentional bias, but revealed
craving reductions. One food study found null results after 1 tDCS + cognitive
modification session to reduce chocolate craving. Smoking tDCS studies suggest
that multiple sessions closely spaced increase ef ficacy , thus we propose [ADDRESS_877117] examined combined tDCS + AAT. Thus, although the proposed work
is high risk, past null findings across other substances using generic cues and
focusing on attentional bias do not predict null ef fects here, rather extensive past
work on each of our included components and strong theory behind combining tDCS
+ AAT suggest potential for high reward. Assessing the impact of novel CET  on
smoking-related outcome measures. Attentional Bias. Smokers demonstrate
selective attention to smoking-related stimuli. and delayed reaction time (R T) during
exposure to smoking cues. They are slower than controls to color-name [CONTACT_74639]-
related words in a modified Stroop task, which combines common words with
intermittent presentation of smoking-related words. Smokers maintain their gaze on
smoking stimuli longer than neutral stimuli, and show increased P300 response to
smoking-related cues. The smoking-cue P300 is thought to reflect attentional and
motivational state of smokers when cues prime smokers’  urge to smoke. According
to incentive-sensitization theory , these biases likely emerge from the motivational
and attention-grabbing properties of smoking cues, which gain salience after
repeated pairing with smoking. This causes sensitization of dopamine
neurotransmission in the striatum increasing the salience of the stimuli long-term
and resulting in greater allocation of attentional resources (attentional bias) and
increases in
craving. Abstinent smokers with greater attentional bias to smoking stimuli are more
likely to relapse, reducing this response may aid cessation. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], we
assessed attentional bias behaviorally and using EEG,
in a forced-choice R T task and found a decreased R T difference between smoking
and neutral stimuli of 60% (p<0.05) following tDCS. W e also show that tDCS of right
dlPFC using the same montage proposed here
(N=8) reduced the P300 dif ference between smoking and nonsmoking images
compared to sham tDCS (N=8) in smokers with long-term/chronic schizophrenia
(Figure 2). In the proposed study , we anticipate that AAT and
tDCS training will reduce approach bias indexed as decreased R T and P300
amplitude dif ference between smoking and neutral images from baseline to re-test
during a modified smoking Stroop task. Cue-Induced Craving and Smoking. As
noted above, smokers report that smoking cues are a major obstacle to quitting and
multiple studies have demonstrated robust cue-induced craving,cue-induced
smoking behavior , and a strong link between the two. Our procedures to personalize
cues, present them in combination, and assess smokers’  self-report and behavioral
CR creates an ideal environment to develop and test novel CET  methodology .
Although the combination of AAT + tDCS has not been assessed for reduction of
cue-induced reactivity (craving or smoking topography), research on these two
procedures independently have
examined AAT effects on attentional bias and daily smoking, and tDCS ef fects on
cue-provoked craving and daily smoking, with mixed but largely positive ef fects.
Given that tDCS is known to be more ef fective when it is
used while engaging the neural processes targeted for change, we anticipate that
combining AAT + tDCS during cue exposure may further enhance reduction in cue-
induced craving and smoking topography (latency & puf f volume) to combined
personal smoking cues (proximal, environment, and people) as measured at
baseline and re-testing after 5 sessions of training. Daily smoking (cigs/day) and
Intent and Confidence to quit. Both AAT and tDCS have independently shown
efficacy in reducing daily smoking among non-quitting smokers with high treatment
interest. W e anticipate similar results here, as well as reductions in cue-induced
craving and smoking topography . Given that tDCS should enhance AAT learning, we
also anticipate that AAT+tDCS may further reduce in these measures. W e will also
examine potential increases in Intent and Confidence to quit, the former shown to
increase with AAT training and both previously associated with quit initiation and
ability to abstain. These three measures will be assessed pre-post training and, to
examine more prolonged ef fects, at 1-week and 1-month post-training. Sex and
individual dif ferences. Although past cue reactivity , AAT, and tDCS work has not
revealed sex dif ferences across outcome variables, we will specifically recruit equal
numbers of male and female smokers to determine if sex, as well as other individual
differences (e.g., age, FTND, years smoking) moderate AAT/tDCS ef ficacy on our
more comprehensive set of outcomes, and thereby [CONTACT_653700] a smoking treatment.
INNOV ATION.
The proposed study will be the first active and sham-controlled test of AATand tDCS
during personalized multi-cue exposure to attenuate several indices of smoking-
related cue reactivity and behavior . Several aspects of this
exploratory/developmental study are highly innovative. 1) AAT: Although
recommended, AAT effects on cue-induced craving have surprisingly not been
formally studied. Past AAT smoking cue studies reveal promising ef fects for AAT on
measures of daily smoking and
attentional bias, but have not examined cue-induced craving. Likewise, no AAT
studies have included neuropsychological measurement of attentional bias (EEG) or
changes in cue-induced smoking topography
(latency to light, puf f volume). 2) tDCS: tDCS applied to the dlPFC can reduce
reactivity to proximal smoking cues (cigarettes, lighters) and can reduce daily
smoking in non-quitting smokers. This will be the first assessment of dlPCF-targeted
tDCS ef fects on smoking attentional bias (Stroop and EEG), craving to personal
cues, and cue-induced smoking topography . 3) Combining AAT + tDCS: No studies
have examined combined AAT+tDCS on smoking CR, attentional measures or
smoking behavior . Given that tDCS is known to be more ef fective when used while
engaging the faculty targeted for change we anticipate combined AAT+ tDCS
targeting dlPFC will have a synergistic ef fect on our comprehensive index of
reactivity measures to combined personal smoking cues, as well as daily smoking
and intent and confidence to quit. Our [ADDRESS_877118] of these two methods. 4) Multiple Personal Cues Exposure: CET
should be most ef fective when cues evoke smokers’  strongest reactivity and capture
key elements of the original contexts of learning. The proposed study will be the first
to incorporate all cue types (people, places and objects) during CET  to target
numerous specific stimuli that trigger each smoker's strongest urges to smoke.
Multiple exposures to real world cue re-creations should enhance the
generalizability of training outside of sessions, a purported shortcoming of past
CETs, and allow us to capture smokers’  most salient cues without the inherent
difficulties of conducting real world exposures.

induced craving and smoking topography , and attenuate behavioral and
neurophysiological measures of attentional bias to combined personal smoking
cues. W e will also determine the impact of this novel CET  methodology on daily

Statistical design and power
This study uses a 2 x 2 AAT (AAT, active control[AC]) x tDCS (tDCS, sham tDCS)
design to assess prepost training changes in cue-induced craving and smoking
topography (latency to light and puf f volume during cue exposure) and attentional
bias (reaction time and ERPs) to smoking-related cues, as well as daily smoking
(cigarettes per day) and confidence and intent to quit. The primary analyses (Aims 1
and 2) will be evaluated via repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance
(RM-ANCOV A) and will test the main ef fects of AAT, tDCS, and their interaction on
measures of craving, reaction time, P300 amplitude, controlling for baseline levels
as covariates (Aim 1). This process will be repeated for Aim 2, where MANCOV A will
test ef fects on latency to smoke, total puf f volume, and cigs/day . An additional 2x2x3
repeated measures (RM-) MANCOV A will test group dif ferences in cig/day and intent
& confidence to quit
across time points (post-training, 1-week, and 1-month). For Aim 3, regression
analysis will be used to examine if attenuation of cue-induced craving and
attentional bias measures predict reductions in smoking
topography and daily smoking and elevations in intention to quit and confidence to
quit, while controlling for baseline levels of these variables. Exploratory analyses will
probe whether sex and other individual dif ferences (e.g., age, FTND) moderate the
effects of AAT/tDCS training on all outcome variables.
Power is based on n=[ADDRESS_877124] work leads us to constrain
our power analysis to AAT and/or tDCS for each variable, but we expect the
synergistic ef fects of combined AAT + tDCS to be even greater , making these power
analyses conservative. However , this exploratory work is not fully powered to detect
significant interaction ef fects. Aim 1. Craving and Attentional bias. Assuming a
Cohen’ s d ef fect size (ES) of 1.02- 1.57 based on prior literature, a multivariate α =
.05, and an R2 of .[ADDRESS_877125] main ef fects of tDCS on cue-induced craving. Boggio et
al.41 found an ES of d=1.13 for reduction in cue-induced craving via tDCS. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]
P300 EEG data from our current study in smokers with schizophrenia shows ES of
d=1.3. AAT work indicates post-training
attentional approach bias reductions to smoking cues of d=1.2629, thus we expect
greater than .[ADDRESS_877126] changes in attentional bias. Aim 2. Smoking
topography and cig/day . Based on our past cue studies, smoking topography to
multiple cues are of similar magnitude to cue-induced craving (d=.90). Further , past
tDCS studies of daily smoking outcome show an ES of 0.[ZIP_CODE]. Thus, with a
multivariate of α=.05, [ADDRESS_877127] of tDCS on smoking behavior in both the MANCOV A
assessing immediate ef fects on smoking behavior and the RM-MANCOV A
assessing longitudinal ef fects on cig/day and intent & confidence to quit. Again,
tDCS
+ AAT should enhance ef fects. Aim 3. Smoking prediction. Assuming α=0.17
(conservative adjustment for 3 outcome variables) and controlling for other variables
contributing an R2 of .3, we will have power greater than .[ADDRESS_877128] an R2 of
0.2422 or larger , in the model predicting smoking topography and cig/day from cue-
induced craving and attentional bias change scores.

Research Activities
1. * Provide a detailed description of all research activities (including screening
and follow-up procedures) that will be performed for the purpose of this
research study . This description of activities should be complete and of
sufficient detail to permit an assessment of associated risks.
The PI, Co-I's and Research Coordinators will be responsible for carrying out all the
research activities.
Visit 1: During this visit we will explain the study and all its procedures with the
potential participant. If he/she agrees to participate and signs the consent we will
move forward with visit 1 procedures. A carbon monoxide (CO) level will be
measured by [CONTACT_91959] a breath sample using our breath CO monitor . If the participants
CO level is below 8 ppm they will not be able to continue with the study and will be
paid for today’ s visit and excused from the study .
The participant will complete the following forms:
•Smoking History: This form will ask questions about the participant and their
smoking history and will also assess the participant's level of nicotine dependence.
•Quit Interest: This is a questionnaire for evaluating the participant's interest in
quitting smoking.
•Intent to Quit: This measures the participant's degree of intention to quit smoking.
•Confidence in Quitting: This questionnaire assesses the participant's confidence in
quitting smoking.
Next, we will identify personal smoking and non-smoking cues of places. The
participant will go through a brief interview during which we will identify places in
which they regularly smoke or do not smoke. W e will lend them a camera and teach
them how to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_653662]. The participant will take pi[INVESTIGATOR_653663] 4 places that are ‘smoking cues’  and 4 places ‘non-smoking cues’  from
various angles. W e ask that they don’t take pi[INVESTIGATOR_653664] (passers-by [CONTACT_653703]/family in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]) or personal identifiers (license plates, street
names, etc.) to protect privacy . The participant will bring the camera containing the
pi[INVESTIGATOR_653665] . If they do not the participant will be
instructed to take more pi[INVESTIGATOR_653666].
Participants will be advised that they must not send any images that are considered
distasteful, obscene, implicate legal action.
The participant will return the lent camera containing the pi[INVESTIGATOR_653667]. W e will also have the participant complete a brief vision
test during this visit. They will stand [ADDRESS_877129] comfortably .
•The participant will be randomly assigned to one of four groups:
1. AAT + tDCS
2. AAT + sham tDCS
3. AC + tDCS
4. AC + sham tDCS
The components of these groups are defined as:
•Approach/A voidance Task (AA T): The participant will use a joystick to push and pull
images in dif ferent directions on a computer screen.
•Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS): is used to slightly change the way
the brain works for a short time. One wet, thin sponge is placed on the participants
head and another wet thin sponge is placed on their arm and connected to
electrodes which will deliver a very weak electrical current. Before stimulation, their
head and arm will be checked for any redness, irritation, or recent shaving of the
head. If any of these are seen, we will exclude them from the study . Some
participants may feel a slight painless tingling as the current begins, but the tingling
should go away after a short time. tDCS will be given at 2.0 mA  and stimulate the
dorsolateral PFC (dlFPC) the sham tDCS will be given at 0.01 mA. W e will ask the
participant at the beginning of and throughout the stimulation to report how much
tingling they are feeling on a scale of 1 being “not at all” and 10 being “extreme”. If at
any point they are experiencing extreme discomfort, we will end the stimulation.
•Active Control (AC): The participant will assess the orientation of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_653668] a key press.
•Sham tDCS: Two wet, thin sponges are placed on the participants head and arm
and the sponges will be connected to electrodes just as the actual tDCS but they will
not deliver any electrical current.
Visits 2 and 9: During this visit the participant will have an attentional bias
assessment while undergoing an electroencephalography (EEG).
•Attentional-Bias: You will be seated in front of a computer with a four-button color
response box. Four dif ferent word lists of [ADDRESS_877130] appears.
•EEG: The EEG allows us to measure electrical activity of the participants brain. A
cap containing sensors will be placed on their head. In addition, sensors will be
placed behind the ears, and on the tip of the nose. Gel will be inserted into the cap
to connect the sensors to the scalp. The participant will not feel any sensations from
these electrodes. While wearing the cap, they will complete the attentional bias
training. Afterwards, we will clean as much of the gel from their scalp as possible.
•Cue-reactivity: Cue reactivity involves viewing pi[INVESTIGATOR_653669]-related and non-smoking-related pi[INVESTIGATOR_653670]. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_653671] a computer
and some pi[INVESTIGATOR_653672].
Visits 3 and 10: During these visits the participant will complete cue-reactivity to their
personal smoking and non-smoking cues and smoke cigarettes using a special
cigarette holder that will measure how they smoke their cigarette. The participant will
be given special instructions on how to light the cigarette and place it into the holder
before they smoke. They will be seated comfortably in front of a large computer
monitor and view [ADDRESS_877131]-trial

Consent Process
Enter N/A in response to the following questions if a Waiver of Consent is requested for all
research activities or if no subjects are being enrolled.
1. * Indicate where the consent process will take place and at what point
consent will be obtained:
Informed consent will take place at Session [ADDRESS_877134] . Conklin's laboratory on the 16th
floor of the Department of Psychiatry at W estern Psychiatric Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653676]. The informed consent process is a concerted
effort between Dr . Tyagi and either Dr . Conklin, and/or the research coordinator . The
potential participant is addressed in a private room and the most current IRB-
approved informed consent form is reviewed point by [CONTACT_653704] . Conklin,
and/or the research coordinator . All aspects of the study are explained, including but
not limited to the nature of the study , its purpose and associated procedures, the
expected duration, and the potential risks of participation. In addition, the subject is
informed about the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any
disadvantage and without having to provide a reason for this decision. The
opportunity for questions is given at various times. Following this explanation, we
will zoom video or phone call (phone call will only occur if Dr . Tyagi isn't currently
available to zoom call) with our licensed physician co-investigator , [CONTACT_653716], (whose
office is in Montefiore Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) at which point the participant will be able to have any
further questions or concerns about the study and the device used addressed by [INVESTIGATOR_124] .
Tyagi. Once all questions are satisfactorily addressed, the participant signs the
consent form and we will scan the signed consent form to Dr . Tyagi. Dr . Tyagi will
print, sign and then scan the consent with both signatures back to us. W e will print
the signed consent form to file and the participant will be given a copy , as well. Once
both the participant and Dr . Tyagi have signed the consent form and we receive the
scanned copy back from Dr . Tyagi we will begin research procedures. No research
activities will begin until both the subject and the licensed physician Co-I signed the
consent form. This entire process will be documented in the participant's research
chart.
2. * Describe the steps that will be taken to minimize coercion and undue
influence, including assurance that there is sufficient time for subjects to
make an informed decision:
The consent process will include a short summary of the study commitment, an in-
depth explanation and breakdown of each visit, the purpose of the study , the risks
involved and our duty to the research participants, as detailed in the attached
consent form. The voluntary nature of the study will be emphasized.
3. For studies that involve multiple visits, describe the process to ensure
ongoing consent:
At the beginning of each visit the participant will be asked if they have any new
questions or concerns regarding the study and their participation and also be told
about any new information about the study to ensure they are completely informed
and want to continue in the study . Subjects active at the time of approval of MOD
003 will be reconsented.
4. * Steps to be taken to ensure the subjects’  understanding:
A brief explanation of the study will be given on the telephone screening call.
[CONTACT_653716] will review and answer any additional questions the subject may have after
the Co-I's/research coordinator's explanation to ensure her understanding. The
participant will be given as much time as needed to think about participating.

Data Safety and Monitoring
1. * Describe your plan to periodically evaluate the data collected regarding both
harms and benefits to determine whether subjects remain safe.  The plan
might include establishing a data monitoring committee and a plan for
reporting data monitoring committee findings to the IRB and the sponsor:
DATA SAFETY  AND MONIT ORING PLAN
The Principal Investigator , Drs. Conklin, and the Co-I Dr . Cof fman will ensure that
there are no changes in the risk/benefit ratio throughout the duration of the proposed
studies. Investigators and study personnel will meet weekly to discuss the progress
of the study . Minutes of these meetings will be maintained in the study binder . At
each meeting, the study goals will be discussed and any changes needed to the IRB
application will be made.
Real-time safety monitoring. Our safety monitoring plan involves monitoring of
adverse events at each lab visit during the study . Drs. Conklin and Cof fman will be
available at all times by [CONTACT_648]/pager during all sessions if adverse events need to
be addressed, as will Sr Research Coordinator Ron Salkeld. In addition, subjects
will be able to call if they experience adverse events while away from the lab, a
procedure we have employed in past studies. The PIs and Co-Is will monitor the
research literature tDCS to identify new findings regarding the overall safety and use
with participants. However , no new risks are anticipated, as the overall risks
associated with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are considered
minimal or no significant risk.
Data Security . All computers in which data is input and/or maintained have firewalls,
strong password protection, and authorized access to data built in against breaches
of confidentiality . We will emphasize patient confidentiality throughout the study .
Consent forms, and other identifying data will be separated from case-report forms.
Nevertheless, potential breaches will be reviewed with study participants in the
consent form, which will be reviewed in-person and will involve informing potential
participants of the potential for breaches in data security , and of the procedures that
are taken to minimize this possibility . All subject data folders will be maintained in
locked filing cabinets in the PI’ s locked laboratory . Access will be given only to the
study investigator and study staf f supervised by [CONTACT_473]. All staf f will be
trained on data input and maintenance, as well as confidentiality .
Study review meetings. At monthly meetings, the research team will review the
interests of study participants, assess the safety and utility of study procedures, and
monitor the overall conduct of the study . Quarterly reports will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_653679] , under supervision of the PIs, and will be reviewed by
[CONTACT_653706] (including adherence to protocol regarding
demographics and inclusion/exclusion criteria), adverse events, compliance with
treatment, attrition, breaches of confidentiality , and participant progress.
1. Measurement and Reports of Subjects to Accrual and Adherence to
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. These will be reported quarterly as indicated. This will
insure that subjects meet eligibility criteria and that ethnic diversity goals are being
met.
2. Measurement and Reporting of Adverse Events. Any adverse events that are
reported will be examined by [CONTACT_1633] [INVESTIGATOR_98909]. Any serious adverse
event will be reported to the IRB and NIH within [ADDRESS_877136] of the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]. Also, the Principal Investigators will
continually evaluate the progress of the study at weekly meetings with study staf f.
The study procedures addressed at these meetings also will include:
a. Subject safety and confidentiality issues
b. Participant recruitment, accrual and retention
c. Data quality and integrity issues. If over the course of the study there is concern
about changes in the risk-benefit ratio, interim analyses will be conducted to
determine if the study should proceed as originally designed.
2.   * Describe your plan for sharing data and/or specimens:
Individuals from the NIH/NIDA  will have access to these records as they are the
funding source and we may share de-identified research data in the future with
secondary researchers who also have an interest in this research.
3. If any research data is collected, stored, or shared in a paper format, address
what precautions will be used to maintain the confidentiality of the data:
Data will be kept in locked filing cabinets in a secure suite. On enrollment, each
participant is assigned a research code number that is used to label all
research data collected on the participant. The research team secures the link
between the participants' identity and the assigned research code number .

by [CONTACT_653709], through the monitoring of
participant discomfort throughout the procedure, and by [CONTACT_653710]. Confidentiality
and loss of Privacy . Information on research participants will be protected for
confidentiality similar to medical records, and will be kept separate from the
research binders in locked metal cabinets and for authorized access only . No
identifiable data will be made available while compi[INVESTIGATOR_653680] a journal article. If the cue reactivity or
questionnaires cause the participant discomfort they do not have to answer the
questions and may stop the study at any time.
3. Financial risks - will the subject or insurer be charged for any research
required procedures?
  Yes No
4. Describe the steps that will be taken to protect subjects’  privacy:
All research procedures will be completed in a private room and with only the
research staf f present.
5. What steps will be taken in the event that a clinically significant, unexpected
disease or condition is identified during the conduct of the study:
The PI's would consult with the subject and refer to the appropriate physician for
follow-up.
6. Describe the potential benefit that individual subjects may experience from
taking part in the research or indicate if there is no direct benefit. Do not
include benefits to society or others:
There isn't a direct benefit to the participant for participating in this study; however ,
it's possible they may find the study procedures helpful to their urge to smoke.
7. Do you anticipate any circumstances under which subjects might be
withdrawn from the research without their consent?
  Yes No
*  Describe the circumstances and any procedures for orderly termination:
It is possible that the subject may be removed from the research study by [CONTACT_653711]/she is unable to perform any of the required tasks or does not
show up for scheduled study visits. He/She will always be paid for a session she
attended prior to being formally withdrawn from the study .
8. Describe procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the
research, including partial withdrawal from procedures with continued data
collection and data already collected:
Research data will be kept and reviewed for an indefinite period of time. Research
information collected before excusal or withdrawal from the study will continue to be
used and disclosed by [CONTACT_653712].

Placebo Arm
1. *  Is there a commonly used diagnostic/treatment approach that is currently
recognized as being effective for the proposed subjects' disease or condition,
and that will be withheld from subjects assigned to the placebo arm of this
research study:
N/A - the proposed subjects are normal, healthy volunteers
2. Describe the commonly used diagnostic/treatment approaches that will be
withheld from subjects assigned to the placebo arm of this research study:
3. Is enrollment into this study limited to individuals in whom the commonly
used diagnostic/treatment approaches are known to be ineffective or
intolerable?
4. Provide a scientific justification for the placebo-control arm of this research
study:
This is a balanced [ADDRESS_877138] control. The ef fectiveness of the techniques being
examined, independently or in combination, as methods to reduce cue reactivity to
personal smoking cues has yet to be examined, so a placebo comparison is
warranted.
5. How long will subjects participate in the placebo arm?  Justify why this
duration is necessary:
They will be in the placebo arm for the duration of the study [ADDRESS_877139]'s condition or disease be monitored and
compare that to the frequency of monitoring associated with standard care for
this disease/condition?
7. What specific endpoints will result in discontinuing a subject's participation
due to worsening of the subject's disease or condition?
8. What is the risk to subjects who receive no active treatment for their disease
or condition while in the placebo arm?
There is no notable risk, their smoking behavior and craving is expected to remain
stable, whereas we anticipate possible reductions in these measures in the other
arms of the study .
9. Describe the planned involvement of a 'contact [CONTACT_9702]' who interacts with the
subject on a regular basis and who will notify the investigators immediately of

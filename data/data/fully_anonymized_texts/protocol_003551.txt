Protocol Title: Noninvasive Subharmonic Aided Pressure Estimation of Portal Hypertension 
 Trial Objectives: The primary objectives of this trial are:  
 
• Evaluate the use of in vivo subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) as a first qualitative 
screening modality for determining the presence of portal hypertension in patients undergoing a transjugular liver biopsy compared to catheter based p ressure measurements (as the reference 
standard) 
• Determine if SHAPE measurements can provide a quantitative, noninvasive measurement of 
hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) to monitor disease progression or treatment response in 
patients identified with  portal hypertension by [CONTACT_881825]/or 
clinical outcomes  
 
Trial Design: This is an open -label, non- randomized trial that will be conducted at two clinical site s, 
Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) and the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971]  (HUP).  Enrolled 
patients undergoing trans -jugular liver biopsy with hepatic vein pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements 
will receive a continuous infusion of Sonazoid® (GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway) co-infused with 0.9% 
NaCl solut ion over a 5-10 minute time period using the setup and infusion rates described in GE 
Healthcare (GEHC) Protocol Supplement provided in Appendix B.  Ultrasound imaging will be 
performed using a Logiq 9 scanner with a 4C transducer (GE Healthcare , Milwaukee, WI) and the 
SHAPE algorithm will be used to measure pressure values in the hepatic and portal veins.  Data will be stored on a PC and compared to pressure-catheter measurements,   Subjects identified in the initial 
examination as having portal hypertensio n (by [CONTACT_881826]) will be monitored by [CONTACT_881827] [ADDRESS_1232938] or MRI scans every 6 months to screen for liver 
cancer, and at those times a repeat SHAPE examination will be performed  (ideally within 1 month of their 
clinically indicated imaging follow up appointment).  In patients who undergo more frequent screening 
(generally 3 month intervals), SHAPE exams will be performed at [ADDRESS_1232939] evaluations (performed every 3 months in this population), medication, concomitant imaging study or procedure (including endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) will be noted (all blood te sts and imaging are clinically 
indicated only and are not required by [CONTACT_3181]).  The end point for this part of the study will be any one new complication (e.g., liver cancer) or a marked worsening in any complication, liver 
 4 transplantation, death, or the end of this clinical trial (after 3 years).  We expect  these patients will be 
monitored three times during the course of this clinical trial.  The time to reach the end point will be noted 
if a new complication or a marked worsening in any complicati on occurs.  
  Trial Population: This trial will consist of up to 300 adults (21 years of age or older) undergoing trans -
jugular liver biopsy with HVPG measurement at TJU or at HUP . 
 Trial Procedures:  Subjects eligible for trial enrollment will be identified by [CONTACT_22888] -investigators, [CONTACT_881838] (at TJU) and [CONTACT_881839] (at HUP) from their patient population of subjects scheduled for a trans-
jugular liver biopsy.  The research coordinato rs for this study will explain the study to the patient s at the 
respective clinical sites.  The patient will be given time to consider the risks and benefits of the study and ask questions about participation.  The coordinator will review the consent form with the patient and then 
the patient will be given the form to review.  The patient, coordinator, and a study investigator will all sign the consent form.  The patient will be given a copy of the signed consent form for their records.  
 After consenting to  participate in this study, a  full demographic profile, known drug allergies or 
intolerances, and review of the subject’s medical/surgical history will be recorded .  Patients with known 
cardiac shunts will be excluded from the study .  If the subject is a woman of childbearing potential, she 
will have a urine pregnancy test (the results of which will be made available to the subject  prior to study 
initiation).  
 Whenever a subject undergoes a trans- jugular liver biopsy  with transcatheter free and wedged hepa tic 
venous pressure measurements as part  of their standard clinical care and agrees to participate in the study, 
we will perform the corresponding SHAPE measurement within the [ADDRESS_1232940] supervision of a medical doctor.  Additionally, resuscitation equipment will be in im mediate 
proximity to the patient during Sonazoid infusion.  Three vials (6 ml) of Sonazoid microbubbles ( 16 μl 
per vial when reconstituted ) will be prepared for each subject  by [CONTACT_509264] 2 ml of water 
for injection, supplied by [CONTACT_246337], as described in the instructions provided by [CONTACT_246337] (Appendix B) .  
Infusions will be performed as described in Appendix B.  All materials and supplies used for the infusion 
procedure will be identical to those described in GE Healthcare’s current Sonazoid IND.  Briefly, 
anintravenous  cannula will be placed in a vein in the subject’s arm.   A 0.9% NaCl solution will be started 
and used to fill up the connecting tubes before being connected to a 3- way stopcock.  The stopcock will 
then be connected to the extension tubing leading to the cannula.  All three vials of suspended Sonazoid 
will be drawn into a 10 ml syringe, placed in a syringe pump at the same level or below the patient, and 
connected directly to the stopcock.  After the stopcock to the 0.9% NaCl solutio n has been opened, the 
saline solution will be infused at a rate of at least 2 ml/min .  Then, Sonazoid will be co-infused at the 
target rate of 0.024 µl/kg body weight/minute (suspension infusion rate of 0.18 ml/kg/hour), but the rate 
may be reduced if necessary to achieve optimal levels of contrast .  This infusion rate was selected based 
on our group’s previous experiences with Sonazoid infusion in human subjects in general [Halpern et al. 2002; Landmark et al. 2008] and in SHAPE portal hypertension sub jects in particular [Eisenbrey et al. 
2013].  This dosing scheme is designed to avoid (or limit) the number of cases that has to be discarded due to insignificant enhancement in the hepatic veins (as in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]; Eisenbrey et al. 2013) . The 
dosage is based off the GE HC provided, study specific resuspension and infusion instructions (Appendix 
B) and the total Sonazoid dose given over a maximum of 15 minutes ( 0.36 µl/kg) will be well below the 
maximal tested dose which was still found safe in Phase I clinical trials (2.7 µl of microbubbles/kg in PBI 
0001 as detailed in the Sonazoid Investigator’s Brochure ).  The duration of  contrast agent infusion will 
range from [ADDRESS_1232941] infusion, a modified Logiq 9 scanner (GE Healthcare) with a broad 
bandwidth curvi -linear array (model 4C) will be used to obtain RF data (for SHAPE measurements) 
within the  hepatic and portal veins.  Both the experimental machine and software will be labeled as an 
 6 investigational device with a GRC provided label prior to beg inning any clinical experiments (21 CRF 
812.5).  Once the infusion of Sonazoid has started, ultrasound imaging will be performed with the 4C 
curved linear array to guide SHAPE ROI placement into the portal vein (while also visualizing a hepatic 
vein).  The SHAPE optimization algorithm will be activated ([Dave et al. 2013]) and the acoustic power 
will be adjusted to produce the maximum change in subharmonic amplitudes (i.e., maximizing the sensitivity of SHAPE).  Then the ROI will be increased to visualize the hepatic and the portal veins, and the corresponding subharmonic data will be acquired at the optimal acoustic power setting in 5 s segments during the infusion of the Sonazoid suspension.  Ultrasound imaging will be performed at a transmit 
frequency of 2.5 MHz and the subharmonic obtained at 1.25 MHz.  All measurement s will be repeated 
three times.   The depths, sizes, and locations of the portal and hepatic veins will be determined by [CONTACT_881828] a reference image.  
 The proposed agent for the study, Sonazoid (GE Healthcare,), is a sterile non-pyrogenic suspension of 
lipid stabilized perfluorobutane microbubbles for contrast -enhancement, with a median diameter between 
2.4 and 3.5 µm (Forsberg et al. 2008).  Previous in vitro results have shown Sonazoid to be superior for 
SHAPE measurements relative to ot her ultrasound contrast agents ( Halldorsdottir et al. 2011).  The 
[LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has yet to approve Sonazoid for human use in this country.  Consequently, we intend to apply to the FDA for an investigator initiated IND (investigational 
new drug)  to cover the use of Sonazoid in patients undergoing a trans -jugular liver biopsy.   It should be 
pointed out that the safety of Sonazoid has already been established in numerous animal studies and in human studies for the evaluation of the liver and heart both in this country and in Europe (Landmark et al. 
2008).  Sonazoid has been approved for use in patients with liver lesions in Japan and has been marketed in that country since early 2007, and has been approved more recently in Sou th Korea ( Bouakaz et al. 
2007; Jang et al. 2013.  Finally, no adverse reactions attributable to contrast agent infusions were 
observed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (Eisenbrey et al. 2013).  All examinations will be recorded.  During the  examination, the subharmonic  pressure estimates will be 
 7 displayed on the Logiq 9 scanner , these estimates will be noted down and the data will be stored on a PC .  
Data will be compared to the transcatheter portal pressure measurements, which comprise  the free and 
wedged hepatic venous pressure ( FHVP and WHVP, respectively ) and the hepatic vein pressure gradient 
(HVPG; measured as the difference between the WHVP and FHVP .  Emergency services (e.g., a crash 
cart) will be available within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881810].  Subjects will be 
monitored for adverse reactions [ADDRESS_1232942] biopsy (roughly [ADDRESS_1232943] Sonazoid injection ), again as a 
standard of care procedure.   Patients will be monitored for a minimum of one hour post Sonazoid 
administration.  During this time a trained CPR personnel and resuscitation equipment will be available.  
SHAPE data will later be compared to all clinical variables obtained from the patie nt to determine 
potential cor relations to liver dysfunction. 
 
Statistical Methodology:  This project is a large clinical trial to further develop SHAPE and to employ 
this method to conduct a large scale human clinical trial to conclusively establish the accuracy of SHAPE 
for the assessment of portal hypertension.  Our statistical analysis will address following major questions: 
1. Can patients with HVPG of 10 mmHg or greater be identified using SHAPE? The fundamental 
hypothesis is that a sensitivity of 89% and  a specificity of 8 1 % can be achieved by [CONTACT_881829] 10 mmHg or greater.  
2. Can portal vein pressures (in the form of HVPGs) in patients with liver disease be quantified 
accurately using SHAPE?  The fundamental  hypothesis is that a correlation coefficient of 0.82 
can be achieved between in vivo SHAPE and HVPG measurements.  
3. Can SHAPE accurately monitor disease progression or treatment response in patients identified with portal hypertension?  The fundamental hypothesis is that correlation coefficients above 0.90 
can be achieved between SHAPE and repeat HVPG results and that SHAPE will significantly 
differentiate responders from non -responders (using clinical outcomes as the reference standard).  
 
The findings of SHAPE will be correlated to the invasive catheter based measurements of portal vein blood pressure (i.e., HVPG) using least squares, multiple linear regression analysis with robust standard errors.  Comparisons of sensitivities, specificiti es and accuracies for diagnosing portal hypertension with 
SHAPE will be conducted with an unpaired Student’s t -test (using HVPG measurements as the reference 
standard).  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be computed using a continuous sca le 
 8 with HVPG cutoff levels of 10 and 12 mmHg.  The optimal operating point (OOP) will be determined as 
the point closest to ‘0,1’ on the ROC curve (representing 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity).  All clinical variables (e.g., concomitant imaging results, presence of cancer or ascites, blood tests, fibrosis and MELD scores etc.) will also be compared to the SHAPE values.  When both types of variables are ordinal or continuous, correlations will be calculated.  When one type of variable is nominal and one continuous non- parametric rank order tests such as Mann -Whitney U -tests or Kruskal -Wallis tests will be 
performed [Rosner 1990].  All of the statistical analyses proposed for the human clinical trial will be repeated split by [CONTACT_881830]/ethnicity differences 
exist in the ability of SHAPE to  diagnose portal hypertension. 
 All analyses and computations will be performed using NCSS/PASS 2008 and Stata 12.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX), whil e the study database will be designed and implemented in 
Filemaker Pro 10.0 (Filemaker Inc, Santa Clara, CA).  This database will contain all patient information (except names and other identifiers), including results of biopsies, HVPG and SHAPE measuremen ts as 
well as the clinical variables.  
 9 1. INTRODUCTION  
 
There is clearly a well-established  clinical need to accurately measure the hepatic vein pressure gradient 
(HVPG) (Garcia-Tsao 1985).  Unfortunately, current techniques are either invasive, such as catheter 
based pressure transducers, which have to be introduced directly into the hepatic vasculature, or 
noninvasive but indirect and qualitative, such as using CT, MRI or ultrasound imaging to diagnose liver cirrhosis (Kudo et al. 2008).  However, the diagnostic accuracy of CT, MRI and ultrasound for grading cirrhosis into 3 categories (chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and pre -cirrhosis) was only between 64 and 70% in 
a recent multi -center study (Kudo et al. 2008) and this is still only a very indirect meas ure of HVPG.  
 Our group has proposed and patented a novel and innovative technique called subharmonic -aided 
pressure estimation (SHAPE) for noninvasive pressure measurements (Forsberg et al. 2005; Shi et al. 1999; 2001).  We have shown hydrostatic pressure can be measured through variations of the 
subharmonic amplitude of ultrasound contrast agents during insonation.  Our group has just completed a first-in-humans clinical trial of SHAPE in 45 patients with chronic liver disease supported by [CONTACT_71602]1 
DK087365 [Ei senbrey et al. 2013].  The SHAPE gradient between the portal and hepatic veins was in 
good overall agreement with the HVPG (R = 0.82) indicating SHAPE may be a useful tool for the diagnosis of portal hypertension.  This project will serve as a large clinical trial to further develop SHAPE 
and to employ this method to conduct a large scale human clinical trial to conclusively establish the accuracy of SHAPE for the assessment of portal hypertension.  
 
1.1 Background 
 
Portal hypertension is defined as an increase in the pressure gradient between the portal vein and hepatic 
veins or the inferior vena cava (IVC) exceeding 5 mmHg (Sanyal et al. 2008).  Cirrhosis (prevalence of 2 -
10%) accounts for at least 90% of cases of portal hypertension in the developed world.  From a 
pathophysiological perspective, the increase in portal venous pressure results from a sequence of events 
that begins with an increase in resistance to portal outflow, into the liver (Navarro et al. 2007).  This is the result of two factors; archit ectural distortion of the liver parenchyma, as occurs in the accumulation of 
 10 fibrosis, and vasoconstriction of the hepatic microcirculation.  The rise in portal pressure is largely 
asymptomatic until the body mounts a homeostatic response to systemic arter ial vasodilatation.  
Specifically, systemic vasodilatation yields predictable physiological consequences, including systemic 
arterial hypotension, retention of salt and water and the formation of ascites, and renal insufficiency.  In 
addition, up to 90% of  the portal flow can be diverted into the systemic circulation through portosystemic 
collaterals (Sanyal et al. 2008).  
 Cirrhosis due to most causes, without the clinical manifestations of portal hypertension, has a small effect on mortality.  However, it is the manifestations of portal hypertension which greatly impact survival.  
Common complications of portal hypertension include gastroesophageal varices, ascites, and portosystemic encephalopathy.  Patients who develop ascites have a 50% two year mortalit y and those 
who develop spontaneous infection of the ascites fluid carry a 70% one year mortality.  Patients with cirrhosis have a 5 -10% yearly incidence of gastroesophageal variceal formation, and a 4 -15% yearly 
incidence of bleeding, with larger varices having a greater risk for bleeding (D’Amico et al. 2006).  
Although the mortality associated with each bleeding event has fallen significantly due to endoscopic, pharmacological, and clinical care interventions, each bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_881811] a 20% risk of death (D’Amico et al. 2006; Navarro et al. 2007; Sanyal et al. 2008). 
 
In patients with chronic liver disease, transcatheter portal pressure measurement represents the “gold 
standard”, albeit indirect, for assessment of portal hypertension.  The wedge hepatic venous pressure 
(WHVP) reflects values of portal venous pressure in cirrhosis (Sanyal et al. 2008).  Another useful 
parameter is the gradient between the portal vein and the hepatic vein pressure, the hepatic vein pressure gradient (HV PG).  The value of HVPG in assessing and monitoring several of the complications of portal 
hypertension is well established (D’Amico et al. 2006; Sanyal et al. 2008).  It has also been found that an HVPG above 10 mmHg predicts the presence of varices, whil e an HVPG of 12 mmHg or more is 
required for varices to bleed  (Garcia-Tsao 1985). 
 [ADDRESS_1232944] decade it still ranges from 15 
to 20% (Sanyal et al. 2008).  Clinical management depends upon preventing an initial bleed when varices 
are present, intervening to stop active bleeding, and providing measures to prevent repeat bleeding.  A 
sustained reduction in the HVPG to below [ADDRESS_1232945] predictor of successful reduction in the 
risk of bleeding with non- selective β- blockers.  Likewise, a reduction in the risk of re -bleeding from 
varices is associated w ith a reduction in the HVPG of more than 20% from baseline or to less than 12 
mmHg.  Finally, the HVPG has been evaluated as a prognostic marker for disease progression, survival 
and mortality (Kalambokis et al. 2007).  Most studies found that the HVPG, when added to other 
measures such as the Child Pugh or MELD scores, increased the ability to predict survival.  
 Consequently, our group has proposed and patented a novel and innovative technique called subharmonic- aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) for noninv asive pressure measurements (Forsberg et al. 
2005; Shi et al. 1999; 2001).  An accurate marker for portal hypertension would impact literally millions of Americans with liver disease.  Such a marker could be used to predict the presence of portal hypertens ion and its complications (in particular varices) and might also be used to predict morbidity and 
mortality.  Moreover, the value of HVPG measurements in the management of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) has been demonstrated.  The noninvasive and accurate measurement of HVPG would also be 
clinically useful for trans- jugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedures.  TIPS are 
frequently performed for patients with intractable ascites not responding to medications or variceal 
bleeding which does not re spond to pharmacological or  endoscopic means.  Patients with suspected 
variceal bleeding routinely undergo ultrasound examination to evaluate patency of the portal venous branches and determine whether TIPS placement is feasible.  Getting a reliable estimate of HVPG in these patients with SHAPE would expedite therapy.  SHAPE may also assist in the evaluation of 
ultrasound findings at TIPS follow -up studies, which can be technically challenging. 
 12 The proposed agent for the current study, Sonazoid® (GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway), is a sterile non-
pyrogenic suspension of lipid stabilized perfluorobutane microbubbles for contrast -enhancement, with a 
median diameter between 2.4 and 3.5 µ m (Forsberg et al. 2008).  Previous in vitro results have shown that 
Sonazoid i s superior for SHAPE measurements relative to other ultrasound contrast agents ( Halldorsdottir 
et al. 2011).  The FDA has yet to approve Sonazoid for human use in this country.  Consequently, we 
intend to apply to the FDA for an investigator initiated IND to cover the use of Sonazoid in patients 
undergoing a trans -jugular liver biopsy.  It should be pointed out that the safety of Sonazoid has already 
been established in numerous animal studies and in human studies for the evaluation of the liver and heart both in this country and in Europe (Landmark et al. 2008).  Sonazoid has been approved for use in 
patients with liver lesions in Japan and has been marketed in that country since early 2007 and more recently in South Korea (Bouakaz et al. 2007 ; Jang et al . 2013).  Finally, no adverse reactions attributable 
to contrast agent infusions were observed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (Eisenbrey et al. 2013). 
  
Sonazoid Clinical Safety  
 
Sonazoid was administered in clinical trials in 1699 patients.  In these patients 404 (23.8%) reported at 
least one adverse event, while 12 of 62 (19.4%) of patients receiving a placebo reported adverse events.  
 
Forty-three (2.5 %, 43/1699) subjects experienced serious adverse events, including [ADDRESS_1232946] commonly noted adverse events were headache (3.6%, 62 /1699), chest pain (2.3%, 39 /1699), 
abdominal pain ( 1.5%, 25/1699), diarrhea ( 1.5%, 25/1699), and nausea ( 1.6%, 28/1699). The majority of 
adverse events were mild  to moderate in severity (9 2.6%, 652/704 ).

Trial Objectives: The primary objective s of this trial are: 
 
• Evaluate the use of in vivo subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) as a first qualitative 
screening modality for determining the presence of portal hypertension in patients undergoing a 
transjugular liver biopsy compared to catheter based pressure measurements (as the referen ce 
standard) 
• Determine if SHAPE measurements can provide a quantitative, noninvasive measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) to monitor disease progression or treatment response in patients identified with portal hypertension by [CONTACT_881825]/or 
clinical outcomes.  
 
 
3.  TRIAL DESIGN  
 
This is an open -label, non- randomized trial that will be conducted at two clinical sites, Thomas Jefferson 
 15 University (TJU) and the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971] (HUP).  Enrolled patients 
undergoing trans -jugular liver biopsy will receive a continuous infusion of Sonazoid® (GE Healthcare, 
Oslo, Norway) co -infused with 0.9% NaCl solution over a 5 -10 minute time period using the setup and 
infusion rates described in GE Hea lthcare (GEHC) Protocol Supplement provided in Appendix B.  
Ultrasound imaging will be performed using a Logiq 9 scanner with a 4C transducer (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) and the SHAPE algorithm will be used to measure pressure values in the hepatic and portal veins.  Data will be stored on a PC and compared to pressure -catheter measurements, which are 
taken as part of the standard of care for all patients undergoing a trans -jugular biopsy.  Subjects identified 
in the initial examination as having portal hypertension (by [CONTACT_881826]) will be monitored by [CONTACT_881831] [ADDRESS_1232950] or MRI scans every 6 months to 
check for liver cancer and at those times a repeat SHAPE examination will be performed  (ideally within 2 
weeks).  Any repeat transjugular biopsies performed in this population will also trigger a repeat SHAPE 
study. Results of blood test evaluations (performed every 3 months in this population), medication, 
concomitant imaging study or procedure (including endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) done as standard of care will be noted.  
The end point for this part of the study will be any one new complication (e.g., liver cancer) or a marked worsening in any complication, liver transplantation, death,  or the end of th e clinical trial participation ( up 
to 18 months ).  On an average, these patients will be monitored three times during the course of this  
clinical trial. 
A full demographic profile, known drug allergies or intolerances, and review of the subject’s 
medical/su rgical history will be recorded .  If the subject is a woman of childbearing  potential, she will 
have a urine pregnancy test (the results of which will be made available to the subject prior to study initiation).  
 
 
3.1  Trial Duration  
 
Individual participation in this trial will be limited to ultrasound imaging studies within the two hour 
period following a trans -jugular liver biopsy (during which their hepatic wedge pressure will be measured 
 [ADDRESS_1232951] of care at TJU and HUP ).  Patients are monitored for two 
hours ([ADDRESS_1232952] Sonazoid injection).  The entire ultrasound imaging protocol will require 
approximately one hour.  Subjects identified in the initial examination as having portal hypertension (by 
[CONTACT_881826]) will be monitored by [CONTACT_881827] [ADDRESS_1232953] every 3 
months and these clinical variables (platelets, albumin, MELD, etc.) as well as any medication will be recorded.  Finally, most subjects with portal hypertension will undergo an endoscopy examination every 1 to 2 years [de Franchis 2005; Merkel et al. 2004].  Results of any concomitant imaging study or procedure (including endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) will be noted.  The end point for this part of the study will be any one new complication (e.g., liver cancer) or a marked worsening in any complication (e.g., MELD scores) , liver 
transplantation, death, or the end of this clinical trial (after 3 years).  On an average, these patient s will be 
monitored three times  during the course of this clinical trial.  The time to reach th e end point will be noted 
if a new complication or a marked worsening in any complication occurs.  
 Subject recruitment is expected to last 3 years (April, 2014 – January, 2017). This includes m onitoring 
disease progression and/or treatment response.  Analysis and publication of results are expected to take an 
additional 2 months ( January– March, 2017).  Volunteer Registry Database forms will be submitted to the 
National Institute of Health’s Office of Regulatory Compliance and Quality at the completion of the 
research study .

5.  MEDICATIONS  
 Sonazoid will be provided by [CONTACT_246337]  (Oslo, Norway).  An FDA Sponsor -Investigator IND application 
will be submitted to the FDA and studies will not commence until regulatory approval has been obtained from the FDA as well as the IRB committee for TJU  and HUP. 
 Sonazoid is a sterile non-pyrog enic suspension of microspheres of lipid stabilized perfluorobutane (PFB) 
for contrast-enhancement, with a median diameter between 2.4 and 3.5 µ m and less than 0.1 % larger than 
7 µm.  Sonazoid is formulated as a powder for injection consisting of lyophili zed sucrose entrappi[INVESTIGATOR_881812] (HEPS) PFB microspheres under a PFB headspace.  Each milliliter of Sonazoid contains roughly 1.2 billion microspheres. 
 
Sonazoid is supplied as a dry powder within 10 ml sealed vials.  The headspace of the vials contains PFB.   
Three vials with 48 µl of Sonazoid microbubbles (6 ml) will be prepared for each subject by [CONTACT_479777] 2 ml of injection grade water  supplied by [CONTACT_246337], as described in Appendix B.  Infusions will 
be performed as described in the Instructions for Use protocol supplement provided by [CONTACT_246337] (Appendix 
B). All materials and supplies used for the infusion procedure will be identical to those described in GE 
Healthcare’s current Sonazoid IND. A diagram of this infusion setup is shown below in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Setup used for Sonazoid infusion for all patients during SHAPE imaging. This setup is 
discussed briefly in section 5 and in detail in the attached GEHC provided infusion protocol (Appendix 
B). 
 Briefly, a 20-[ADDRESS_1232957]’s right or left arm. A 0.9%NaCl 
solution will be started and used to fill up the connecting tubes before being connected to a 3- way 
stopcock.  The stopcock will then be connected to the extension tubing leading to the cannula.  All three Extension set

 [ADDRESS_1232958] 2 ml/min, and Sonazoid will be infused at the desired 
rate of 0.024 µl/kg body weight/minute (suspension infusion rate of 0. 18 ml/kg/hour), but may be reduced 
if necessary to achieve optimal levels of contrast.  This infusion rate was selected based on our group’s 
previous experiences with Sonazoid infusion in human subjects in general [Halpern et al. 2002; Landmark 
et al. 2008] and in SHAPE portal hypertension subjects in particular [Eisenbrey et al. 2013].  This dosing scheme is designed to avoid (or limit) the number of cases that has to be discarded due to insignificant enhancement in the hepatic veins (as in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]; Eisenbrey et al. 2013) .  This dosage is based on 
GEHC’s previous experience of dosing Sonazoid by [CONTACT_104482].  The maximum amount of microbubbles infused over 15 minutes (0. 36 µl/kg) is well below the maximal tested dose which was still found safe in 
Phase I clinical trials (2.7 µl of microbubbles/kg in PBI 0001 as detailed in the Sonazoid Investigator’s 
Brochure).  
Sonazoid will be stored in a secure cabinet, with only the study investigators and research personnel 
having access.  New vials must be prepared for each subject's contrast ad ministration.  Unused drug and 
empty vials will be properly disposed of after reconciling in the log of study drug.  
5.[ADDRESS_1232959] agents in patients with cardiac shunts has recently been called into question.  Therefore, patients with known or suspected right-to-left, bi-directional, or transient right- to-
left cardiac shunts will be excluded from this study . 
 
 21 The safety of Sonazoid in patients with 1 ) severe emphysema, pulmonary vasculitis or a hi story of 
pulmonary emboli; and 2) respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y distress syndrome has not been studied.  Therefore, patients with 
any of these conditions will be excluded from participation.  Additional exclusion crit eria are listed in 
section 4.2.  
 
5.2  Randomization  
 
This is a non -randomized trial; therefore, no randomization procedure is required.  
 
5.3  Blinding and Unblinding Methods 
 
This is an open-label trial; therefore, no blinding or unblinding procedures for the trial drug are required.  
5.4  Storage  
 Sonazoid vials will be stored in a secure cabinet, with only the study investigators and research personnel having access.  The study researchers will be responsible for drug reconstitution and inventory control.  
Sonazoid is stable for 8 hours after reconstitution.  If the agent is suspended and not used within 8 hours it 
will be discarded.  
 
 
6.  TRIAL PROCEDURES  
 
6.1  Screening Assessments  
Screening assessments will be performed within  4 weeks prior to the administration of Sonazoid.  All 
subjects will receive a written consent form and a verbal explanation of the trial by [CONTACT_1755]/or 
the research study coordinator and will be asked to sign the written informed consent.  Trial participants will have the presence of inclusion criteria and absence of exclusion criteria verified by [CONTACT_1541] a 
comprehensive medical history, which will include screening assessments for their scheduled trans-
jugular liver biopsy.   Patients with cardiac shunts will be excluded from the study. 
 
 [ADDRESS_1232960] supervision of a medical doctor.  Emergency 
services (e.g., a crash cart) will be available within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_509232]. 
Additionally, resus citation equipment will be in immediate proximity to the patient during Sonazoid 
infusion.  Patients will be monitored for AEs post Sonazoid treatment for a minimum of one hour. 
Trained CPR personnel and resuscitation equipment will be in attendance during  this monitoring period.   
A dose of three vials with 48 µl of Sonazoid microbubbles (6 ml  total after resuspension ) will be prepared 
for each subject by [CONTACT_509264] 2 ml of injection grade water supplied by [CONTACT_246337].  Infusions will be performed as described in the GEHC protocol supplement (Appendix B), and shown in Figure 1. 
All materials and supplies used for the infusion procedure will be identical to those described in GE 
Healthcare’s current Sonazoid IND. Briefly, a n IV cannula will be placed  in a vein in the subject’s right 
arm. A 0.9%NaCl solution will be started and used to fill up the connecting tubes before being connected 
to a 3-way stopcock. The stopcock will then be connected to the extension tubing leading to the stopcock 
the cannula.  All three vials of suspended Sonazoid will be drawn into a [ADDRESS_1232961] 2 ml/min, and Sonazoid will be 
infused at the desired rate of 0.024 µl/ kg body weight/ minute (suspension infusion rate of 0.18 
ml/kg/hour), but may be reduced if necessary to achieve optimal levels of contrast . This infusion rate was 
selected based on our group’s previous experiences with Sonazoid infusion in human subjects in general 
[Halpern et al. 2002; Landmark et al. 2008] and in SHAPE portal hypertension subjects in particular 
[Eisenbrey et al. 2013].  This dosing scheme is designed to avoid (or limit) the number of cases that has to 
be discarded due to insignificant enhancement in the hepatic veins (as in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]; Eisenbrey et al. 
2013). This dosage is based off the GE HC instructions for storage and well below the maximal tested 
dose which was still found safe in Phase I clinical trials (2.7 µl of microbubbles/kg in PBI 0001 as 
detailed in the Sonazoid Investigator’s Brochure). 
 [ADDRESS_1232962]’s 
medical/surgical history will be recorded .  If the subject is a woman of childbearing potential, she will 
have a urine pregnancy test (the results of which will be made available to the subject prior to study 
initiation).  Emergency services (e.g., a crash cart) will be available within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881813].   Adverse events will be monitored during the entire procedure. 
 
6.3.2 Ultrasound Imaging 
 The ultrasound examinations will be performed by a qualified sonographer.  Procedures and equipment for this trial will be used in accordance with typi[INVESTIGATOR_176809].  All trial procedures will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice.  A modified Logiq 9 scanner (GE  Healthcare, 
Milwaukee, WI) with a broad bandwidth curvi -linear array will be used in to obtain RF data (for SHAPE 
measurements) within the hepatic and portal veins.  Both the experimental machine and software will be 
labeled as an investigational device w ith a GE provided label prior to beginning any clinical experiments  
(21 CRF 812.5) .  Ultrasound imaging will be performed at a transmit frequency of 2.5 MHz and the 
subharmonic obtained at 1.25 MHz.  Using this setup, acoustic pressure amplitudes will all be below 1.21  
MPa peak negative pressure, 2.19  MPa peak positive pressure.   The SHAPE algorithm will be activated  
and the acoustic power will be adjusted to produce the maximum change in subharmonic amplitudes (i.e., maximizing the sensitivity of SHAPE).  Subharmonic data from the microbubbles (i.e., SHAPE) will be 
acquired in [ADDRESS_1232963] ayed on the Logiq 9 scanner, 
these estimates will be noted and the data will be stored on a PC.  Data will be compared to the 
 24 transcatheter portal pressure measurements, which comprise the free and wedged hepatic venous pressure 
(FHVP and WHVP, respectively) and the hepatic vein pressure gradient (HVPG; measured as the difference between the WHVP and FHVP), which are acquired as part of standard of care for all patients 
undergoing trans-jugular liver biopsy at TJU and HUP.  
6.4  Efficacy Assessments  
 
The findings of SHAPE will be correlated to the invasive catheter based measurements of portal vein 
blood pressure (i.e., HVPG) using least squares, multiple linear regression analysis with robust standard 
errors.  Comparisons of sensitivities, specificities and  accuracies for diagnosing portal hypertension with 
SHAPE will be conducted with an unpaired Student’s t -test (using HVPG measurements as the reference 
standard).  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be computed using a continuous scale 
with HVPG cutoff levels of 10 and 12 mmHg.  The optimal operating point (OOP) will be determined as 
the point closest to ‘0,1’ on the ROC curve (representing 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity).  All clinical variables (e.g., concomitant imaging results, presence of cancer or ascites, blood tests, fibrosis 
and MELD scores etc.) will also be compared to the SHAPE values.  
 
6.5  Safety Assessments  
Emergency services (e.g., a crash cart)  will be available within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881814].  Adverse events will be monitored during the entire procedure.  Specifically, the patient will be 
monitored with non- leading questions to monitor the patient for the occurrence of transient side effects 
that are described below. 
 
6.5.1  Risks/Benefits Assessment.  
 
The known risks from the administration of Sonazoid are minimal.  Transient side effects that have been 
described as possibly related to Sonazoid administration include headache (3.6%, 62/1699), chest pain (2.3%, 39/1699), abdominal pain (1.5%, 25/1699), diarrhea (1.5%, 25/1699), and nausea (1.6%, 28/1699). The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in severity (92.6%, 652/704). 
 25 The use of an intravenous needle and the fluids given through the needle may cause minor discomfort, 
bleeding under the skin (bruise), and possible infection at the site of needle insertion. 
 Clinically significant adverse effects from the administration of Sonazoid are unlikely.  The use of contrast with the new ultrasound imaging techniques is expected to provide significantly more information than conventional ultrasound techniques.  This may lead to a non- invasive method for 
measurement of hepatic pressure.  
 To minimize and/or eliminate risks a nurse will be present during the entire procedure. Emergency 
services (e.g., a crash cart) will be available within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_509232]. 
Adverse events will be monitored during the entire procedure.    The risk benefit ratio is low.  Based on the available nonclinical and clinical safet y data and the 
anticipated dose levels of Sonazoid that will be used in this study, safety concerns are minimal.  The potential side effects related to Sonazoid administration are described above and listed in greater detail in 
the investigator’s brochure.  
 
6.6.2  Adverse Events (AE)  
 
An AE includes any condition that was not present prior to trial treatment, but appeared following 
initiation of trial medication; any condition that was present prior to trial treatment, but worsened during trial medication; or any condition, of which the subject has a history, that was not present prior to trial 
medication initiation but reappeared following administration of Sonazoid.  This would include conditions that are likely to be associated with an underlying or inter mittent disease (e.g., angina, flu, 
etc.). 
 The subjects will be monitored for AEs during the entire procedure.  All AEs, including observed or 
 26 volunteered problems, complaints, signs or symptoms, and diagnoses, occurring from the initiation of 
Sonazoid dosing until the completion of the Sonazoid administration will be recorded on a serious or non-serious AE data form, whether or not associated with the use of the trial medication. GEHC will be 
informed of all AEs. In addition all unexpected and serious adv erse events (SAEs) are reported to the TJU 
or HUP IRB (as applicable) and to the FDA. The investigator is required to submit all unexpected and 
serious adverse events to the TJU or HUP IRB (as applicable)  within [ADDRESS_1232964] be reported within 24 hours to the TJU or 
HUP IRB (as applicable)  and to GEHC. Fatalities not related to the study drug/device must be reported 
within 5 days.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_881815]. He will be responsible for ensuring all FDA requirements are met and all AE are properly reported.  
 The AE forms will include: subject identification number and initials; subject’s date of birth, gender, and ethnicity; name [CONTACT_50662] , date of Sonazoid administration; signs/symptoms and severity; date of 
onset; date of resolution or death; relationship to the study drug; action taken; concomitant medication(s) including dose, and route and duration of treatment.    Whenever possible, the AE will be evaluated and reported as a diagnosis rather than individual signs and symptoms.  If a definitive diagnosis is not possible, the individual signs and symptoms will be recorded.  
The investigator (s) will evaluate and note the duration, intensity, and relationship to (association with) the 
Sonazoid administration, the action taken, and the determination of seriousness for each AE.  INTENSITY OF AEs  
The intensity of the AE  will be characterized as mild, moderate, or severe.  
Mild AEs are usually transient, require no special treatment, and do not interfere with the subject's daily activities.  
Moderate AEs traditionally introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the  subject and may 
 [ADDRESS_1232965]'s usual daily activity and typi[INVESTIGATOR_881816].  
When the  intensity of the AE changes over time, the maximum intensity will be recorded. 
 RELATIONSHIP TO SONAZOID ADMINISTRATION 
 
The relationship or association of the AE to the Sonazoid administration will be characterized as "unlikely," "possible," or "probable."  A relationship as sessment will be performed by [CONTACT_881832] a data form.  The investigator will refer to the Sonazoid investigator brochure for assistance in determining AE relationship. 
 An "unlikely" relationship indicates that there is little or no chance that Sonazoid caused the reported AE; other conditions, including concurrent illnesses, progression or expression of the disease state, or a reaction to a concurrent medication, appear to explain the reported AE.  A "possible" relationship indicates that the association of the AE with Sonazoid is unknown.  However, the AE is not reasonably attributed to any other condition.  A "probable" relationship indicates that a reasonable temporal association exists between the AE and Sonazoid administration and, based upon the investigator's clinical experience, the association of the event with the trial medication seems likely.  
 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
A "serious" AE (SAE) is defined as a significant clinical hazard, contraindication, or precaution that: 
 Results in death  
 Is life-threatening (In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], there is an immediate risk of death from 
the AE as it occurred. This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more seriou s form 
may have caused death.)  
 28  Results in a persistent or significant temporary disability/incapacity defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions 
 Results in or prolongs an existing in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (an overnight stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
regardless of length) [Note: A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881817], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre- existing condition which did not worsen, 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881818], do not constitute an SAE.]  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in offspring of a subject taking the trial medication, regardless of time to diagnosis)  
 Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176813], the event may jeopardize 
the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed for the definition of a serious adverse experience.  
 
The designated medical monitor will review all serious and unexpected adverse events associated with the 
protocol and provide an unbiased written report of the event within [ADDRESS_1232966]'s data forms.  
 
 
6.[ADDRESS_1232967] from the trial if, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is not safe for the subject to continue.  The date the subject is withdrawn from a treatment and/or from the trial and the reason for discontinuation will be recorded on the CR F.  For portal hypertension patients that will be monitored by [CONTACT_881833] 
18 months, the end point will be any one new complication (e.g., liver cancer) or a marked worsening in any complication (e.g., MELD scores) or the end of their  clinical trial participation (up to 18 months ).  
The time to reach the end point will be noted if a new complication or a marked worsening in any complication occurs .  The time to reach th e end point will be noted.  
 Trial participation will be considered completed  if the subject has met all of the following trial 
 29 requirements:  
 
 Has received at least one infusion of Sonazoid  
 Has undergone the complete ultrasound imaging study as described in this protocol 
 
If a subject's participation in the trial is interrupted for any reason (e.g., because of an AE or if the subject 
is lost to follow -up) and the subject has met the criteria described above for completing the trial, the 
subject's trial participation will be considered completed.  If a subject's trial participation is int errupted for 
any reason by [CONTACT_423]'s or investigator's choice and the subject has not met all of the criteria listed above, then the subject will be considered a discontinued subject.  
  
7.  DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYS ES 
 
7.1  Data Management  
 Data forms will be completed for all subjects enrolled in the trial.  The patient study files will be stored in a secure file cabinet and maintained by [CONTACT_509258] s at each institution (TJU and HUP) .  
Patient study files will be kept for 7 years after the completion of the study.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_881819].  He will be 
responsible for ensuring all FDA requirements are met and all AE are properly reported.  
 The final data will be entered into a database.  The investigator will be responsible for management of the database.  The database will be maintained within an organized and secure directory system.  
 
7.2  Statistical Analyses  
 
7.2.1  Hypotheses 
 
H1:  Can patients with HVPG of 10 mmHg or greater be identified using SHAPE? The fundamental 
hypothesis is that a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 81 % can be achieved by [CONTACT_881834] 10 mmHg or greater. 
 30 H2: A correlation coefficient of 0.82 will be achieved between in vivo SHAPE and HVPG measurements.  
H3: A correlation coefficients above 0.90 will be achieved between SHAPE and repeat HVPG results.  
H4: SHAPE will sig nificantly differentiate responders from non- responders using clinical outcomes as the 
reference standard.  
 
7.2.2  Analysis of Results  
The findings of SHAPE will be correlated to the invasive catheter based measurements of portal vein 
blood pressure (i.e., HVPG) using least squares, multiple linear regression analysis with robust standard errors.  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be computed using a continuous scale with HVPG cutoff levels of 10 and 12 mmHg.  The optimal operating point (OOP) will be determined as the point closest to ‘0,1’ on the ROC curve (representing 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity).  All clini cal 
variables (e.g., concomitant imaging results, presence of cancer or ascites, blood tests, fibrosis and MELD scores etc.) will also be compared to the SHAPE values.  When both types of variables are ordinal or continuous, correlations will be calculated .  When one type of variable is nominal and one continuous 
non-parametric rank order tests such as Mann -Whitney U -tests or Kruskal -Wallis tests will be performed 
[Rosner 1990].  All of the statistical analyses proposed for the human clinical trial will be repeated split 
by [CONTACT_881830]/ethnicity differences exist in the ability of SHAPE to diagnose portal hypertension.   All analyses and computations will be performed using NCSS/PASS 2008 and Stata 12.0 (Stata 
Corporation, College Station, TX), while the study database will be designed and implemented in Filemaker Pro 10.0 (Filemaker Inc, Santa Clara, CA).  This database will contain all patient information (except names and other identifiers), including results of biopsies, HVPG and SHAPE measurements as 
well as the clinical variables.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_1232968] clinically important aim, the sample size analysis is based on specific aim 1 where each 
patient represents an independent entity.  Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the sensitivity and specificity of 
 31 SHAPE for the diagnosis of portal hypertension (i.e., HVPG > 10 mmHg) is 89% and 88%, respectively 
[Eisenbrey et al. 2013 ].  However, the confidence intervals achieved in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_881820] (due to the 
limited sample size) very wide (worst case scenario: 52 –100%).  Hence, a power analysis was performed 
using NCSS/PASS 2008 (NCSS, East Kaysville, UT) to estimate the number of cases required to produce clinically acceptable 95% two -sided confidence intervals (for one correlation) [Newcombe 1998].  Table 
2 below illustrates sample size calculations for the n umber of independent observations needed in the 
study population based upon 95% two- sided confidence intervals ranging from 0.06 to 0.10 for one 
correlation. A sample size between 259 and 278 subjects will provide 95% confidence intervals from 0.84 to 0.92 (i.e., a width of 0.08).  A similar analysis was conducted based on the correlation between SHAPE 
and HVPG of 0.82 obtained in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] [Eisenbrey et al. 2012a].  In that case to demonstrate that 
SHAPE can accurately measure HVPG values with a corr elation coefficient of 0.82 requires between 264 
and 343 patients (for confidence interval widths of 0.08 and 0.07, respectively).  Hence, we selected a sample size for this study of 300 subjects.

7.2.4 Disposition of Software 
 
Investigation al software containing the modified SHAPE algorithm will be removed from the Logiq 9 
scanner upon completion of the study  to avoid the investigational device being used for any unapproved 
investigation s. At the conclusion of the study, the developed software will be saved on CD for future 
experimentation. These investigations may ultimately further the development of SHAPE t echnology as a 
pressure monitoring system. However, under no circumstances with the software be used in a clinical environment (i.e., for human studies) without GE’s consent. This will be ensured by [CONTACT_2224] a GE 
controlled password for installation of experimental software which is currently in use and will expi[INVESTIGATOR_881822].

Calculation of infusion rate:  
Table 1 lists the infusion rate per hour, which corresponds to the syringe pump rate for a body 
weight range of 40-130 kg.  
Dose of 0.012 µL microbubbles/kg bw/minute corresponds to 0.72 µL microbubbles/kg bw/hour: 
    Infusi on rate (mL/hour) = 0.090 x body weight in kg  
1The calculation of number of vials includes a necessary overage of minimum 2mL. The maximum 
extractable volume from each vial should be drawn into the 10 mL syringe.

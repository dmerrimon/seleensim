21 of 76 2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
2.1. Background Information  
Peripheral arterial disease  (PAD) , involving atherosclerosis with complete or partial occlusion of 
blood vessels in the peripheral circulation, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the 
developed world. It is estimated to affect between 8 and 12 million people in the United  States of 
America ( [LOCATION_003]) (Criqui, 1997 ). In many patients , peripheral arterial disease is asymptomatic and 
its importance lies mainly as a marker of generalized atherosclerosis and the associated high risk 
of myocardial infarction and stroke ( Hirsch, 2001 ). Peripheral arterial diseas e may however cause 
disabling symptoms, progressing from intermittent claudication which limits mobility, to rest pain 
and ultimately to critical ischemia of the limb necessitating amputation.  
In many patients , the disease can be managed effectively with medical therapy including 
antiplatelet agents and statins, and an exercise program to increase exercise tolerance. However , 
in more severe disease a range of techniques have been developed to improve or restore blood 
flow to the affected limb. Depending on  the anatomical location and extent of the atherosclerotic 
lesions , percutaneous procedures such as angioplasty and stenting may be effective to reopen 
blocked vessels. However , for long segment stenosis and occlusions, by[CONTACT_624227] ( PTFE ) or DacronTM may be 
required ( Norgren, 2007 ; Conte, 2015 ). The long -term success of these procedures, particularly 
those using synthetic grafts, is limited by [CONTACT_624228] -intimal 
hyperplasia leading to stenosis at the anastomoses. In addition, infection is a common occurrence 
associated with synthetic grafts. This additional hazard is compounded by [CONTACT_624229].  
There is thus a need for alternative conduits which more closely mimic human vascular tissue, 
that may avoid or reduce the complications associated with PTFE and Dacron.  
2.2. Scientific Rationale  
Humacyte, Inc. (Hu macyte) has developed an acellular, human collagen -based vessel ( Human 
Acellular Vessel – HAV) to provide an alternative to synthetic materials and to autologous grafts 
for the creation of vascular access for dialysis and for use in peripheral vascular byp ass surgery. 
Because this product mimics native vascular tissue, it may possess the advantages of an 
autologous graft as well as the off -the-shelf availability benefit of synthetic grafts. Use of an 
off-the-shelf product avoids the surgical morbidity assoc iated with vein graft harvest and , most 
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831172] intimal hyperplasia at the anastomoses ( Quint, 2011, Prichard , 2011, 
Dahl, 2011 ). Upon implantation, it is anticipated (based on pre -clinical studies) that the co llagen 
matrix comprising the HAV will be infiltrated with host cells and remodeled by [CONTACT_40689]. This could 
result in a vascular structure that is more similar to the histological composition of the native 
vascular tissue that may improve HAV longevity and be less likely to become infected.  
2.3. Summary of Nonclinical Information  
The nonclinical testing program was designed to comprehensively address:  
● local and systemic effects of the product in multiple in vivo animal models acutely and 
chronically,  
● functional aspects of product implanted into animal models as an arteriovenous conduit , 
● biocompatibility of the HAV material in standardized in vitro and in vivo test protocols.  
● Overall, the results of these studies indicated that the HAV extracellular mat rix (ECM) 
material was non -toxic, well tolerated, and met standards for biocompatibility. Generally, 
the HAVs functioned as intended and maintained patency during the implantation period. 
(See the Investigator Brochure  [IB] for a detailed summary of noncli nical data.)  
● Pre-implantation , the HAV has mechanical properties (burst pressure and suture retention 
strength) comparable with native human artery and vein ( Table  1). There was no evidence 
that HAV strength deteriorated after long -term implantation into b aboons.  
Table  1: Summary of Mechanical Properties of Explanted Acellular Vessels  
a From L’Heureux et al, Nature Medicine , 2006. (L’Heureux, 2006 ) 
In the chronic animal testing , Humacyte grafts produced using canine cells were implanted into 
12 canines (canine acellular vascular graft, CAVG) and 14  baboons (HAV) in a variety of 
anatomical locations. In general, the Humacyte vessels were safe and well tolerated and 
functio ned as intended.  Test Material  Burst Pressure (mm Hg)  Suture Strength (g)

the vessel wall, endothelial cells lining the lumen, and an adventitial -like outer layer adjacent to 
the vessel. These findings indicate that implanted HAVs were populated with cell types that are 
characteristic of healthy na tive vasculature. Examination of the anastomotic sections showed that 
the HAVs were well integrated with adjoining vasculature with minimal intimal hyperplasia 
observed. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry ( IHC) was employed to identify CD -[ADDRESS_831174] shown a substantial macrophage 
population has been observed within venous intimal tissue adjacent to inflammatory PTFE 
arteriovenous grafts ( Kelly, 2002 , Roy-Chaudhury, 2001 ). Only sparse CD -68 positive 
macrophages were observed, indicating that the degree and the aggressiveness of the intimal 
hyperplasia associated with the HAV were less than that typi[INVESTIGATOR_624191] 
(Prichard, 20 11). 
Over time, the organization and composition of ECM components indicated that, aided by 
[CONTACT_624230], HAVs were remodeled in vivo in a manner that mimicked the 
dynamic remodeling process of native blood vessels. Given the difficu lties associated with the 
baboon animal model, where mismatches in vein versus graft diameter were encountered and 
animals perturbed their wounds postoperatively, an overall assisted patency rate of approximately 
80% (11/14) was achieved. In a xenogeneic t ransplant model that did not employ 
immunosuppression, the HAV material did not elicit biologically significant cellular or delayed -type 
hypersensitivity (DTH) immune responses. All animals developed immunoglobulin  G (IgG) titers 
to the HAV material that d id not appear to detrimentally impact vessel function.  
In internationally recognized in vitro and in vivo International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) test protocols, the HAV material met criteria for biocompatibility required of medical devices.  
These data collectively support the safety of the HAV for the proposed clinical investigation.

2.4.1.  Overview  
The HAV clinical development program currently includes 8 clinical studies: 5 in patients with 
end-stage renal disease  (ESRD)  receiving hemodialysis ( CLN-PRO -V001, CLN-PRO -V003, 
CLN-PRO -V006 , CLN-PRO -V007 , and CLN -PRO -V011 ), 2 in patients with PAD (CLN -PRO -V002 
and CLN-PRO -V004) and 1 in patients with vascular trauma ( CLN-PRO -V005). Three Phase 1/[ADDRESS_831176] com pleted primary analysis with long -term follow -up ongoing ( CLN-PRO -V001, 
CLN-PRO -V002 and CLN PRO V003), 1 Phase 3 study completed enrollment and follow up is 
ongoing (CLN -PRO -V006), 2 Phase 2 studies ( CLN-PRO -V004  and CLN-PRO -V005) and one 
Phase 3 study (CLN -PRO -V007) are open for enrollment.  One Phase 2 study has completed 
enrollment and primary analysis is ongoing (CLN -PRO -V011).   
As of 20 February 2020 , 392 patients ( [ADDRESS_831177]  patients , 35 PAD patients , and 27 vascular 
trauma patients ) have recei ved a HAV. The first implant for hemodialysis was performed in 
December 2012, and the first peripheral arterial by[CONTACT_624231] 2013. Overall, the total 
treatment exposure is approximately [ADDRESS_831178] -PRO -V002, is a single group 
uncontrolled study conducted at 3 sites in Poland that is fully enrolled and in long -term follow up. 
Eligible patients required a f emoro -popliteal by[CONTACT_624232]. Pre-operative imaging (angiography or computed tomography [ CT] angiography) must have 
demonstrated at least two below knee vessels patent to the ankle with good runoff. The proximal 
anasto mosis was expected to be below the inguinal ligament and the distal anastomosis above 
the knee. Autologous vein grafts must not have been suitable or feasible (e.g., because of severe 
venous disease or prior use of leg veins for other by[CONTACT_624233] a clinical need to 
preserve those veins for future by[CONTACT_624234]).  
The HAV was implanted using standard vascular surgical techniques and the patency of the 
by[CONTACT_624235]. The patient was then followed up 
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831179] -PRO -V004   Version 4.0  
 
25 of 76 at study visits at 15 days, 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. At each visit , safety was 
assessed by [CONTACT_624236]  (AEs) , and the HAV was examined using 
duplex ultrasound  (US) to visualize the entire length to confirm patency, flow and to detect 
stenosis, aneurysm development or dilatation.  
The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the Humacyte 
HAV in PAD patients undergoing above -knee femor o-popliteal by[CONTACT_624237] (primary, primary assisted and secondary) rate of the Humacyte HAV at 24 months. 
Secondary objectives include assessment of the panel reactive antibodies (PRA) and IgG 
response to the HAV and to asses s patency (primary, primary assisted and secondary) at 6, 12 
and 18 months, to determine the rates of interventions needed to maintain / restore patency in 
the HAV, to assess any effect of implantation on claudication, rest pain and ischemic ulcers and 
to assess any effect on ankle -brachial index (ABI).  
The second PAD study of similar design, CLN -PRO -V004, is being conducted in the US.  
2.4.3.  CLN-PRO -V002 Study Results (24 M)  
Recruitment began in October 2013 and was completed in June 2014 with 20 patients implant ed. 
Thirteen patients completed the 2 year follow up visit. Of the seven patients terminating the study 
early, three died and four were withdrawn after occlusion of the HAV.  None of the deaths were 
considered related to the investigational device or proce dure.  
Kaplan -Meier analyses in which deaths were censored revealed primary, primary assisted, and 
secondary patency probability rates of 79.2%, 79.0%, and 89.5% at Week 26, 63.3%, 63.2%, and 
84.2% at Month 12, 63.3%, 63.2%, and 79.0% at Month 18, and 58.1% , 57.9%, and 73.7% at 
Month 24.  
Six patients (30%) required at least [ADDRESS_831180] -PRO -V004   Version 4.0  
 
26 of 76 All 20 patients experienced AEs (a total of 92 events). Thirty -one of these events in [ADDRESS_831181] frequent AEs reported included graft thrombosis (35% of 
patients), anastomotic stenosis (20% of patients), lymphocele (20% o f patients), and local 
swelling (15% of patient). Those serious adverse events ( SAEs ) reported by [CONTACT_2669] 2 patients 
were graft thrombosis (6 patients, 30%) and anastomotic stenosis (2 patients, 10%).  
No patient showed an increase in PRA levels. Two patie nts had a significant (>2 -fold) increase 
from baseline in IgG levels. One of these patients experienced a thrombosis of the HAV between 
[ADDRESS_831182]-PRO -V002 Conclusions:  
● Humacyte HAV was safe and well tolerated in PAD patients.  
● The HAV is able to  withstand long term use in a high pressure, high outflow resistance 
arterial circuit.  
● Patency rates for the HAV are within the ranges of patency rates of synthetic and 
autologous grafts presented in the literature.  
● Humacyte HAV was not immunogenic.  
2.4.4.  Experience in Hemodialysis Patients  
Two Phase 2 trials, one in Poland (CLN -PRO -V001) and one in the US (CLN -PRO -V003) have 
completed enrollment. Both recruited subjects requiring hemodialysis access for ESRD  whom  
were not suitable for creation of an autologous arteriovenous fistula ( AVF). Most subjects had 
undergone previous vascular access procedures, in many cases multiple attempts including both 
AVFs and synthetic grafts. Initial results from these Phase 2 stud ies are discussed below.   
The primary objectives of these two studies are to evaluate both the safety of HAV and its efficacy 
in terms of primary and secondary patency at 6 months. Secondary objectives include 
measurement of a PRA response, development of  IgG antibodies to the ECM  material in the HAV 
and a 2 -year evaluation of patency and an assessment of the need for interventions to 
maintain/restore patency. Follow up has now been extended up to 120 months.  
A Phase 3 randomized study comparing HAV with expanded PTFE ( ePTFE ) grafts (CLN -PRO -
V006) has completed enrollment in the US, Europe, and Israel. Preliminary Month 18 results are 
presented below. A second Phase 3 randomized study (CLN -PRO -V007) comparing HAV with 
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831183]-PRO -V007 ; however, blinded safety data is presented in the IB. A Phase [ADDRESS_831184] patients in Poland (CLN -PRO -V011) has primary assessments ongoing, and no 
safety or efficac y information is currently available.  
2.4.5.  CLN-PRO -V001 and CLN -PRO -V003 Study Results (24 M)  
All subjects (n=60) have now completed at least 24 months since implantation (or had a censoring 
event). The first subjects recruited are now beyond [ADDRESS_831185] always been managed successfully, often 
allowing immediate resumption of dialysis without the need for the placement of a dialysis 
catheter. One non -serious arteriovenous (AV) graft aneurysm was reported in Study 
CLN-PRO -V001 (moderate in intensity,  considered possibly related to the investigational 
medicinal product [ IMP] and considered not related to procedure – this patient died before the 
Sponsor could complete the follow up of this event). An expected number of small 
pseudoaneurysms have been ob served, which is consistent with all surgically -created 
hemodialysis access. Most have resolved spontaneously with only [ADDRESS_831186] has generally been well tolerated and blood chemistry, hematology 
and coagulation data are not indicative of any HAV -associated toxicity.  Immunogenic response 
to the HAV material has not been observed as demonstrated by a general lack  of HAV -related 
change in PRA levels (Class I or II). Three subjects had elevations in their PRA levels: all 
3 subjects had experienced one or more renal transplant failures; one subject recently; one 
subject developed septic shock about a month before the  elevated value; and the third subject, 
who was severely debilitated with a decubitus ulcer, died approximately a month after HAV 
abandonment.   
IgG titers increased in 5 subjects; in 4 cases , the IgG titer increased and then decreased while 
the HAV remain ed functional with no clinical evidence of an inflammatory response; in one case 
the IgG titer increase occurred in a subject who maintained primary patency.  
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831187] -PRO -V004   Version 4.0  
 
28 of 76 AEs related to the HAV / access site (excluding thrombotic events) were few; there have been 
only three access -site infections, of which only one required removal of part of the HAV. There 
have been:  
● 1 transplant (known to be functioning well at [ADDRESS_831188] -transplant)  
● 15 deaths, all after abandonment or during follow -up; none of the deaths were 
considered related to the presence of the HAV  
Patency data for the two studies in dialysis access has been pooled for a combined Kaplan Meier 
analysis ( Lawson, 2016 ). Based on these K aplan -Meier plots , the patency at 6, 12 and 24 months 
is estimated t o be 60%, 26% and 15% (primary patency) and 97%, 89% and 77% (secondary 
patency).  
2.4.6.  CLN-PRO -V006 Preliminary Study Results (18 M)  
Details of Study CLN -PRO -V006 can be found in the IB. The CLN -PRO -V006 study was designed 
to enroll a broad range of ESRD patien ts in whom a clinical decision has been made to implant a 
‘graft’ to provide vascular access for hemodialysis. The trial was limited to adults (≥18 years old) , 
and subjects were either on hemodialysis or expected to start dialysis within [ADDRESS_831189] synthetic graft implanted in this clinical setting is an ePTFE graft 
([ADDRESS_831190] wall, non -stretch, and non -tapered).  
The primary objective of the study is  to compare the secondary patency of the HAV with that of 
the ePTFE graft when used as a conduit for hemodialysis . Key secondary objectives of the study 
are to compare the primary patency of the HAV with that of the ePTFE graft  (efficacy) and  to 
compare the rate of access -related in fections for the HAV with that of the ePTFE graft  (safety).  
A summary of losses of secondary patency (events) for ePTFE and HAV are shown in Table 2. 
At [ADDRESS_831191] -implantation, the HAV arm had 9 and 6 fewer losses, respectively, of 
secondary patency than the ePTFE arm. At 18 months, the ePTFE arm had 4 fewer losses of 
secondary patency than the HAV arm.

ePTFE=expanded polytetrafluoroethylene; HAV=Human Acellular Vessel; ITT=Intent to Treat  
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831192] ratio for loss of secondary patency at 18 months is 1.19, with lower and upp er 95% 
confidence interval (CI) of 0.78 and 1.81, respectively. Since the observed upper 95% CI is greater 
than the non -inferiority margin, we failed to reject the null hypothesis, and therefore, could not 
establish non-inferiority  of HAV relative to ePTFE .   
However, given that the hazards for loss of secondary patency between HAV and ePTFE were 
not proportional (i.e., the curves for secondary patency cross near 400 days, making the relative 
risks of loss of patency non -proportional over time), the pre -specified Cox Proportional Hazards 
model is not ideally suited to analysis of the CLN -PRO -V006 secondary patency data. Therefore, 
a sensitivity analysis was performed using the non -parametric restricted mean survival time 
(RMST) method, which does not make as sumptions regarding proportionality of hazards between 
the two arms of the trial. RMST estimates a gain or loss in the event -free survival time due to 
treatment versus control in a specified time period. The results from the RMST analysis indicated 
that th e time to failure of secondary patency was delayed, on average, by [ADDRESS_831193] led to a loss of primary 
patency at those times.  
Information on acces s-related infections was collected for all study subjects. Table 3 provides the 
rates of access -related infections involving the study conduit (not local  site infections, and not 
infections of tunneled dialysis catheters or other accesses). The HAV had significantly fewer study 
access -related infections than ePTFE (p= 0.041), with the absolute rate of infections for ePTFE 
roughly five times higher than HAV  (4.[ADDRESS_831194] years of dialysis use 
for ePTFE and HAV, respectively). Fewer HAV subjects required intravenous antibiotics for 
treating their access related infections.  Markedly fewer HAV subjects required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624192] (13 vs. 3 instances of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624193], respectively). 
Lastly, conduit removals were more frequent for ePTFE than for HAV.

2.4.7.  Human Acellular Vessel Host Response and Remodeling Data  
Humacyte has been able to assess the general host response to the HAV in a number of human 
participants; this was accomplished through the microscopic examination of explanted HAV and 
adjoining tissue samples obtained during surgical revision procedures  (Kirkton, 2019 ). The 
analysis (mostly of a section close to the venous anastomosis) inc luded assessments of:  
● Cellular infiltration of histotypic, inflammatory and immunological populations.  
● Extracellular remodeling processes, including neo -synthesis and reorganization of 
ECM components that typi[INVESTIGATOR_624194].  
In 16 cases, small segments of the HAV and adjacent vascular tissue were explanted, fixed in 
formalin solution and shipped to Humacyte for analysis. Implant duration ranged from 16 to 
200 weeks.  
In man, the HAV remodeled in a manner consistent with that observed i n primate studies. There 
was infiltration of cell populations that are normally associated with angiogenesis and vascular 
organization and structure; namely, those with endothelial, smooth muscle and fibroblastic 
phenotypic characteristics were observed. E ndothelial cells formed a monolayer on the luminal 
surface of the HAV. Migration of actin -positive smooth muscle cells into the wall of the HAV was 
consistently observed. A well -vascularized adventitial layer of non -constrictive fibrous tissue 
formed aroun d HAV. Infiltration of the graft material by [CONTACT_624238]. Degradation or 
breakdown of the implant was not observed.  
Histotypic neo -synthesis and reorganizat ion of the ECM was observed in patterns indicative of 
integration of the HAV into the host. An increase in the density of collagen type I, the main type 
of collagen found in the wall of native blood vessels, was apparent in the majority of HAV explant 
spec imens. The structure of collagen type I in these specimens exhibited a more mature, 
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831197] in a fashion similar to wound 
repair in the body ( Figure  1). In one case, an explanted specimen was tested for suture retention 
strength at the time of explant and exhibited a substantial increase over the pre -implant level.

The image above show s a mid -vessel segment explanted at [ADDRESS_831199] groups and continued clinical development for these target 
indications is warranted.  The SAE profile has been typi[INVESTIGATOR_624195] d ialysis and 
PAD populations. In hemodialysis populations, secondary patency of the HAVs is substantially 
higher than the historical data for both ePTFE and AVF (accounting for non -maturation). In PAD, 
patency is in line with historical ePTFE and autologous  conduit for above -knee by[CONTACT_6476].  No 
evidence of immunogenicity of the HAV has been found , and the HAV remains mechanically 
robust even after repeated puncture for hemodialysis and under high pressure, high outflow 
resistance in arterial reconstruction.  
These data support the use of HAV in future Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies for vascular 
replacement and reconstruction in diseased or damaged (trauma) vessels.  
2.5. Potential Risks and Benefits  
2.5.1.  Potential Risks  
It is anticipated that subjects participating in the study will be exposed to similar risks to those 
associated with other arterial conduits. Risks associated with the study investigational product 
may include but are not limited to:  
● Thrombosis/occlusion of the conduit or host vessels, w ith consequent limb ischemia  
● Embolism from a thrombosed conduit  
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831200] -PRO -V004   Version 4.0  
 
33 of 76 ● Bleeding and hematoma formation at the surgical site  
● Infection – at the surgical site or systemic   
● Stenosis of the conduit or its anastomoses  
● Aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm formation  
● Swelling of  the limb  
Regular clinical examination of the HAV implantation site and assessment of the patency, blood 
flow and diameter using ultrasound during the study should allow early detection of complications 
and permit appropriate intervention including HAV explantation.  CT angiography at Months 1, 6, 
[ADDRESS_831201] proteins. Possible antibody formation will be assessed by [CONTACT_624239].  
2.5.2.  Potential Benefits  
Patients who undergo implantation of the Humacyte HAV may benefit from a reduced number of 
infections  and infection -related complications versus a conventional ePTFE or a Dacron graft. In 
addition, the risks listed in Section  2.5.1  typi[INVESTIGATOR_624196]. Finally, the longevity (secondary patency) of th e 
Humacyte HAV may be greater than that of conventional synthetic grafts.  
2.5.3.  Risk -Benefit Rationale  
The risks anticipated in this study are similar to those associated with currently marketed 
prosthetic grafts used for peripheral by[CONTACT_4897]. The potentia l advantages of the HAV 
compared to currently marketed grafts may lead to a lower infection rate and reduced need for 
HAV replacement.  
Recruitment will be restricted to a maximum of [ADDRESS_831202] -PRO -V004   Version 4.0

Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831218] (IMP) is a Humacyte human acellular vessel (HAV), which 
is a tis sue-engineered vascular prosthesis for arterial by[CONTACT_624242]. It is a sterile, non -pyrogenic acellular tubular vessel composed of human collagen types 
I and III and other extracellular matrix proteins, including fibro nectin and vitronectin. The vessel 
is [ADDRESS_831219] is supplied on a silicone 
mandrel immersed in normal physiological saline in a sealed and labeled container.  
There is no placebo or comparator control group in this study.  
6.2. Manufacturer of the IMP  
The HAV is manufactured by:  
 [CONTACT_624243]  
 [ADDRESS_831220]  
 Centennial, CO [ZIP_CODE] [LOCATION_003]  
Traceability of the HAV during and after the clinical investigation will be achie ved by [CONTACT_624244]. A unique identifying lot number will be assigned to each vessel.  
6.3. Packaging, Storage, and Labeling  
Packaging : Each HAV is contained in a sealed, flexible plastic primary container closure system 
that was developed by [CONTACT_624245]. The system meets container/closure requirements to maintain 
sterility as well as product and fluid integrity. The vessel is contained inside the system in a fixed 
manner, immersed in a sterile, phosphate buffered saline. The total volume of the sto rage solution 
is approximately 300 mL.  
Storage : The product is shipped under controlled conditions to maintain temperature at 4ºC 
(range: 2 – 10ºC). The product should be stored in a refrigerator that maintains this temperature 
range. The HAV MUST NOT  be allowed to freeze.  
Labeling : The IMP will be labeled according to applicable guidelines and relevant regulatory 
agency requirements. A tamper proo f label affixed to the secondary container will be used to 
ensure that the product is not compromised prior to use.  
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831221] -PRO -V004   Version 4.0  
 
41 of 76 6.4. Implantation of the Humacyte human acellular vessel (HAV)  
The Humacyte HAV is implanted using standard vascular surgical techniques similar to placement 
of standard peripheral vascular prostheses (see study manual for details).  
Tunneling of the HAV must be performed using a sheathed tunneler. During tunneling, the HAV 
should be handled by [CONTACT_624246] (see study manual for detai ls) 
After placement, HAV patency and integrity are checked by [CONTACT_624247]. Prior to 
completion of surgery angiography is performed to confirm adequacy of the HAV anastomoses, 
HAV patency and peripheral runoff. The surgical site is closed using sta ndard techniques.  
Implantation of the HAV will be undertaken by [CONTACT_624248].  
6.5. IMP Accountability Procedures  
Documentation of receipt, dispensing, and return of all IMP must be maintained by t he Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee. It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that all 
IMPs are kept in a secure location, with access limited to individuals authorized by [CONTACT_9532]. The product will be shipped  with the IMP Receipt Form. Once signed, the original 
IMP Form should be returned to Humacyte, and a copy will be maintained in the Principal 
Investigator’s Files. The IMP Accountability Log will be used to account for all IMP received, 
dispensed, and retu rned and must be maintained by [CONTACT_143283], at 
which time the original will be retrieved by [CONTACT_624249] a copy kept 
at the site. Following accountability of the IMP by [CONTACT_624250] d designee, all 
unused IMP will be returned to Humacyte.  
6.6. Assessment of Patient Compliance with IMP  
Not applicable.  
6.7. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Prior medications are defined as all prescription medications or non -prescription aspi[INVESTIGATOR_624198] 7 da ys (whether continuing or not) prior to Day 1. All prior and concomitant medications 
(including immediately pre -surgery and post -surgery medications) must be listed in the patient’s 
medical record and recorded on the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). Dru gs used during 
anesthesia should be recorded in the anesthesia records but should not be transcribed into the 
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831222] -PRO -V004   Version 4.0  
 
42 of 76 eCRF. Patients should be questioned at each study visit concerning any new medications or 
changes in current medications. Note: particular attenti on should be made to identify the use 
of antithrombotic or antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], prasugrel, direct 
thrombin inhibitors, factor Xa inhibitors, or vitamin K antagonists).  
For each medication taken, the following information will be collected:  
● Medication generic name / components of combination product  
● Dose  
● Route of administration  
● Frequency of administration  
● Date started  
● Date stopped  
● Indication for use  
6.8. Essential, Precautionary and Prohibited Medications  
6.8.1.  Essential Medications  
All patients should receive both antibiotic and antithrombotic prophylaxis  in conjunction with HAV 
implantation:  
Antibiotic prophylaxis:  
● All patients must have at least 1 day of antibiotic prophylaxis in accordance with local 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48799]. Longer antibiotic prophylaxis is at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
Antithrombotic prophylaxis:  
● Intraoperative heparin: up to 150 IU/kg unfra ctionated heparin during surgery.  
● Further measures to prevent venous thromboembolism are at the discretion of the 
investigator and may include low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ). 
● If antiplatelet therapy was not ongoing at the time of surgery , it should be commenced 
as soon as possible post operatively. Antiplatelet therapy (usually dual therapy with 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 81  to 325 mg and clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] 75 mg daily) should continue long term while the 
HAV is in place. Choice of an alternative antiplatelet regim en if the patient is unable 
to tolerate aspi[INVESTIGATOR_624199], Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831223] thrombin 
inhibitors and factor Xa inhibito rs (e.g., dabigatran, api[INVESTIGATOR_445322]) should be avoided 
unless essential for treatment of a medical condition arising postoperatively. In that case , 
consideration should be given to modification or cessation of antiplatelet therapy. Antiplatelet 
therapy should be restarted on cessation of these anticoagulant drugs.

ultrasound and adverse events will be recorded.  
If, at any of the scheduled visits, duplex ultrasound surveillance suggests the development 
of a ≥ 50% stenosis within the HAV but immediate intervention is not required , closer follow 
up should be considered. Intervention to manage any such stenosis is at  the discretion of 
the investigator taking into account the degree and rate of progression of the stenosis.  
7.6. Medical Care during the Study and upon Study Termination  
Optimal medical therapy should be continued during the study. This should include:  
● An exer cise program  
● Smoking cessation advice and therapy  
● Management of diabetes, hypertension and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_624204].

52 of 76 8. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
Safety of the HAV will be assessed in terms of:  
● Aneurysm formation  
● Pseudoaneurysm formation  
● Anastomotic bleeding or spontaneous rupture  
● HAV infection  
● Need for HAV removal  
● Significant i nflammation at the implantation site   
● Other adverse events  
● Laboratory parameters (clinical chemistry, hematology, and coagulation)  
● Increase from baseline in PRA  
8.1. Adverse Event Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered an IMP and which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the IMP. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not related to the IMP. Any worsening of the 
patient’s disease under study or other medical conditions will also be considered to be an AE, 
unless it is within the normal range of disease flu ctuation for that patient.  
8.2. Serious Adverse Event Definition  
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it:  
● Results in death  
● Is life -threatening  
o The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
include an adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.  
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831251] -PRO -V004   Version 4.0  
 
53 of 76 ● Requires patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] e xisting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
o This is defined as the patient being hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] 24 hours or more or the 
patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148581].  
● Requires intervention to prevent permanent damage  
● Results in persistent  or significant disability/incapacity  
● Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
● Important Medical Events  
o For the purpose of  this study, this includes any event involving the HAV that results 
in a surgical or endovascular radiological intervention. The event(s) which caused 
the procedure should be reported as an SAE.  For example: in the event of HAV 
thrombosis, the thrombosis would be considered the SAE; any associated 
stenoses (or other associated findings) that are present would be considered AEs.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting to 
the sponsor is appropriate in other  situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624205] t he 
definition above. These may also be considered to be SAEs.  
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624206] a SAE. However, prolongation of 
the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624207] a SAE.  
8.3. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is any adverse drug reaction that is 
serious (as defined in Section 8.2), unexpected  (is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed) and suspected (meaning there is a reasonable 
possibility that the IMP caused the adverse event).  
8.4. Events of Special Interest  
Events of Special Interest are:  
● HAV occlusion (thrombosis)  
● HAV spontaneous rupture  
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831252] and should be reported as 
an AE  
● HAV infection  
● HAV abandonment  
● HAV aneurysm  
● HAV pseudoaneurysm  
● HAV excision (partial or complete)  
8.5. Reporting of Adver se Events  
At each evaluation, the investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred. The patient 
will be questioned in a general way and no specific symptoms will be suggested. If any AEs have 
occurred , they should be documented in the patient’s medical chart and recorded on the AE pages 
of the eCRF. If known, the diagnosis should be recorded in preference to the listing of individual 
signs and symptoms. All serious adverse events (SAEs should be reporte d to the Safety Contract 
Research Organization ( CRO ) within [ADDRESS_831253] become aware of the event.  
AE reporting begins from implantation of the HAV (the moment the patient undergoes anesthesia) 
and ends at the conclusion of the Month [ADDRESS_831254] Month 12 through Month 60 , only the following 
will be reported by [CONTACT_093]:  
● All SAEs  
● All Events of Sp ecial Interest ( Section  8.4) 
8.5.1.  Criteria for Determining Causal Relationship to the HAV and Criteria for 
Determining Causal Relationship to the Index Su rgical Procedure  
The criteria for determining the causal relationship of an AE with the HAV are presented in the 
table below. A separate assessment of causal relationship of an AE to the index surgical 
procedure is required as well using the same criteria and definitions presented in the table below. 
Please note that causal relationship to procedure only refers to the index surgical procedure in 
which the HAV was initially implanted.  
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831255] a causal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reasonable time after the surgical placement 
of the HAV). However, the influence of other factors may have 
contributed to the event (e.g., the subject’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant medications). Although an adverse event may rate only 
as “possibl e” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more 
information and later be upgraded to certain as appropriate.  
Unlikely Related  A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship makes a causal relations hip improbable (e.g., 
the event did not occur within a reasonable time after surgical 
placement of the HAV) and in which other drugs or chemicals or 
underlying disease provide plausible explanations (e.g., the subject’s 
clinical condition, other concomitan t treatments).  
Not Related  A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, which 
occurs when the HAV was not implanted; or, another cause is 
obvious and in which there is sufficient information that the etiology 
of the event is not related to the HAV.  
The sponsor will make the final determination of causality for the purposes of reporting to the 
regulatory authorities and to the Principal Investigators.

56 of 76 8.5.2.  Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event  
Severity of adverse events, including abnormal clinical laboratory values, will be assessed 
according to the criteria below and entered in the eCRF:  
Grade  Severity Assessment Standard  
1-Mild Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.  
2-Moderate  Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with 
the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause 
some interference with functioning.  
3-Severe  Events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and ma y 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe 
events are usually incapacitating.  
4-Life-threatening  Any adverse event that places the subject or participant, in 
the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from 
the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.  
5-Death  Death related to AE.  
8.5.3.  Reporting of Action Taken to Resolve AE  
● None  
● Lab tests / further evaluation  
● Treatment required (specify if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057])  
● Patient withdrawn from study  
● Other (specify)  
8.5.4.  Reporting the Outcome of the AE  
● Recovered, with sequelae  
● Recovered, without sequelae  
● Ongoing  
● Death  
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831257] -PRO -V004   Version 4.0  
 
57 of 76 ● Lost to follow -up 
8.5.5.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The urgency for reporting SAEs is 4-fold: (1) to facilitate discussion (and implementation, if 
necessary) by [CONTACT_624253] -up measures, (2) to facilitate 
investigator reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk to human subjects to the 
institutional review board (IRB), (3) to facilitate the sponsor’s rapid dissemination of information 
regarding AEs to other investigators/sites in a multi -center study, and (4) to enable the sponsor 
to fulfill the reporting requirements to the appropriate regula tory authority.  
Any SAE that occurs through Month 60, whether or not causally related to the IMP, must 
be reported by [CONTACT_624254] [ADDRESS_831258] complete the SAE Report Form in English, and send the completed, 
signed form by [CONTACT_40743] (see below) IMMEDIATELY (at latest within 24 hours) after 
becoming aware of the SAE.  
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_624208] (e.g., admission and/or discharge summary, laboratory reports 
and autopsy report), may also be submitted with the SAE form to clarify the circumstances 
surrounding the SAE(s). The entire medical records should NOT  be sent with the SAE form.

Fax: +1 -[PHONE_12985]  
Email: [EMAIL_11915]  
Phone: +1 -[PHONE_12984]  
The investigator will be requested to supply as much  detailed information as possible regarding 
the SAE that is available at the time of the initial contact. The investigator should also complete 
missing or requested information and submit follow -up reports until the SAE has resolved or, in 
the case of perm anent impairment, until the SAE has stabilized.  
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831259] -PRO -V004   Version 4.0  
 
58 of 76 It is the responsibility of each Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_624209]/her IRB of all SAEs that 
are received by [CONTACT_624255]/her institution in accordance with 
institutional practices.  
The Safety CRO will inform the sponsor about all SAEs within [ADDRESS_831260] are defined in Section  8.4 and should be reported to the Safety CRO 
within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  For each of these events detailed surgical notes 
(with illustrative diagram), including reason for and  outcome of any intervention or abandonment, 
should be completed within 48 hours and uploaded to the clinical database.  
Detailed information about the occurrence and treatment/intervention for these events will be 
collected throughout the study up to [ADDRESS_831261] HAV implant.  This information will include the 
following:  
● Summarized surgical notes, including a simplified anatomical diagram showing where 
angioplasties, stents, or revisions have been performed (using intervention worksheet 
provided)  
● Need fo r hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (number of nights)  
● Need for antibiotics (in the case of HAV -related infections)  
8.5.7.  Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
If any AEs are present when a subject completes [ADDRESS_831262] implant (Month 12) or ET, if earlier, 
or if a subject is withdrawn fro m the study, the subject will be re -evaluated within an appropriate 
period of time. At the investigator’s discretion, minor AEs can be re -evaluated via telephone and 
documented. If the AE has still not resolved, additional follow -up will be performed as ap propriate. 
The investigator or his designee should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_624256] -up is not 
necessary. This should be documented in the subj ect’s medical records.  
8.6.  Reporting of Pregnancy  
If a study participant becomes pregnant during study participation, the participant will be 
withdrawn from the study and the event will be recorded as an adverse event in the eCRF. The 
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831263] information about the pregnancy on the Pregnancy & Outcome Report Form 
(PORF), which must be submitted to the Safety CRO within [ADDRESS_831264] the available outcome information and provide an updated PORF to the Safety CRO within 
1 business day of receipt. If there is a congenital anomaly in the infant, this will be recorded as a 
SAE in the data forms for the mother (i.e., the study participant).  
Partner pregnancies do not need to be reported.  
8.7.  Data Monitoring Committee  
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety on an ongoing basis and p rovide 
recommendations about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], continuing or otherwise modifying the study. The DMC consists 
of individuals who are not directly involved in the conduct of the study. A charter describes the 
roles and responsibilities of the DMC. Responsibilities o f the DMC will include review of aggregate 
safety data from other studies in the HAV clinical development program.  
8.8.  Interim Analysis and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_624210] a Phase [ADDRESS_831265] implications for already implanted HAVs and their possible 
removal - such as aneurysm formation (true or pseudo) or spontaneous  rupture - will trigger a 
referral of the event urgently for DMC review  
The DMC may recommend modification or early termination of the study for safety reasons.  
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831266] -implantation. The 
secondary objectives of this study are to further assess safety in terms of PRA response, and to 
determine the rates of HAV interventions required to keep the HAV patent. There is no formal 
hypothesis testing planned; the study involves only a single, open -label treatment group.  
Endpoints will be assessed over a period of up to 60 months after HAV implantation. The primary 
analysis of the study will be conducted on the earlier of a) when the final subject enrolled reaches 
[ADDRESS_831267] -implant or b) all subjects enrolled in the initial [ADDRESS_831268] -implant  
Incidence of HAV aneurysm formation (true or pseudo), anastomotic bleeding or spontaneous 
rupture, HAV infection, HAV removal, and significant local infla mmation at the HAV implantation 
site will be separately tabulated and listed . 
Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms. 
Adverse events will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_2942] , preferred term , incidence, 
severity, and duration. HAV complications will be listed in terms of incidence, severity, and (where 
appropriate) time to onset and duration. Serious adverse events will be summarized separately. 
Any premature discontinuations due to adverse e vents and deaths will be listed and summarized.  
Laboratory data, including PRA, will be listed and summarized using appropriate descriptive 
statistics at each visit and for the absolute change from baseline values for all post -surgery visits. 
The closest non -missing values prior to surgery on Day [ADDRESS_831269] -PRO -V004   Version 4.0  
 
61 of 76 Primary patency is defined as the functional patency until any type of intervention; primary 
assisted patency is defined as an HAV still working without thrombosis; secondary patency is 
defined as the functional patency, with or without precedin g successful interventional or surgical 
procedures to maintain or reestablish patency, until either final failure or the access is abandoned. 
Early discontinued patients prior to the visit of interest will be determined as being non -patent 
irrespective of the reason for discontinuation.  
The rate and type of interventions needed to maintain / restore patency in the HAV will be 
descriptively tabulated.  
The absolute change from baseline (Day 1) values to all post -surgery visits of duplex ultrasound 
parameters  will be summarized. Summary statistics will also be provided at each time point.  
The methods and endpoints regarding the efficacy parameters employed in this study are 
consistent with current clinical practice and are meaningful to the research community . Every 
attempt has been made to minimize the variability on the part of the surgeon when using this 
product. The results of this study will be used to determine the sample size of subsequent clinical 
studies.  
9.4. Other Analyses  
All clinical parameters will be  listed for all patients treated at each study visit. Descriptive statistics 
will be summarized for continuous outcomes such as age and BMI. If necessary, number and 
percentage of patients will be reported for categorical outcomes.  
9.5. Sample Size Rationale

World Medical Association  Declaration of Helsinki (Appendix II) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 
Each investigator will conduct the trial according to applicable local or regional regulatory 
requirements.  
10.2.  Institutional Review Board  
IRBs must be constituted according to the applicable state and federal requirements, including 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) GCP.  
It is the responsibility of each investigator to submit the protocol, Investigator Brochure, subject 
informe d consent, subject recruitment materials (if applicable), and other documentation as 
required by [CONTACT_624257]/her IRB for review and approval.  A copy of the written approval must 
be provided to the CRO. The documentation should clearly mention the appro val/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_29925], the subject informed consent form, and subject recruitment materials (if 
applicable), including respective version dates.  The written approval must be obtained from the 
IRBs and provided to the CRO prior to the relea se of clinical study supplies to the investigational 
site and commencement of the study. If any member of the IRB has direct participation in this 
trial, written notification regarding his or her abstinence from voting must also be obtained.  
Each investiga tor must adhere to all requirements stipulated by [CONTACT_5657]/her respective IRB. This 
includes notification to the IRB regarding protocol amendments, updates to the subject informed 
consent, recruitment materials intended for viewing by [CONTACT_1766], investigational new drug safety 
reports, SAEs and unexpected AEs, reports and updates regarding the ongoing review of the trial 
at intervals specified by [CONTACT_35974], and submission of final study reports and summaries 
to the IRB.  
10.3.  Subject Informed Consent  
Prior to any study procedures being performed, subjects and persons conducting the consent 
discussion will be required to sign and date the IRB -approved informed consent, and each subject 
will be given a copy. In addition, this information should be record ed in the subject’s medical 
record (i.e., source document).  
The written consent document will embody the elements of informed consent as described in the 
World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, 21 CFR Part  50.25, ICH E6 guideline (GCP), 
and in a ccordance with any local regulations. The investigator is responsible for the preparation, 
content, and IRB approval of the informed consent document. The consent form must be 
approved by [CONTACT_779]’s IRB and be acceptable to Humacyte.  
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831271] be agreed to in writing by [CONTACT_624258] ( FDA) and approved by [CONTACT_624259]. Written 
approval of a protocol amendment is not required prior to implementation of changes to the 
protocol which eliminate an immediate hazard to the study patient; however, approval must be 
obtained as soon as possible thereafter. Any agreed amendments must also be signed by [CONTACT_1268].  
10.5.  Study Initiation  
The investigator must not enroll any patients prior to attendance at the Investigator Meeting or 
the complet ion of a formal site initiation visit conducted by [CONTACT_2024]. These meetings will include 
a detailed review of the study protocol and eCRF pages. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_624211] -study requirements have been co mpleted and essential 
signed documents provided to the CRO.  
10.6.  Study Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with 
the protocol, GCP, applicable regulatory requirements, and the currently appr oved Declaration of 
Helsinki, and that valid data are entered into the eCRF.  
To achieve this objective, the monitor’s duties are to ensure the maintenance of complete, legible, 
well-organized, and easily retrievable data. The monitor will review the protoc ol with the 
investigator. In addition, the monitor will explain the investigator’s reporting responsibilities and 
all applicable regulations concerning the clinical evaluation of the IMP.  
The investigator will permit representatives of Humacyte and the CRO  to monitor the study as 
frequently as Humacyte or the CRO deem necessary to determine that data recording and 
protocol adherence are satisfactory. The eCRF data and related source documents will be 
reviewed in detail by [CONTACT_112100], in accor dance with relevant standard operating 
procedures ( SOPs ) and ICH GCP regulations. This includes results of tests performed as a 
requirement for participation in this study and any other medical records required to confirm 
information contained in the eCRF such as past medical history and secondary diagnoses. The 
investigator and his/her staff will be expected to cooperate with the monitor and provide any 
missing information whenever possible.  
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831272] -PRO -V004   Version 4.0  
 
64 of 76 All monitoring activities will be reported and archived. In addit ion, monitoring visits will be 
documented at the investigational site by [CONTACT_76775] -specific monitoring log.  
10.7.  Case Report Form

on an ongoing basis.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that data are properly recorded on each patient’s 
eCRF and related documents. An investigator who has signed the protocol signature [CONTACT_624265].  
For data handled by [CONTACT_2024], eC RF data and some or all of the study -related data will be 
managed and stored electronically in the CRO’s database system. Validated data will 
subsequently be transferred to the sponsor.  
10.8.  Verification Procedures  
It is the investigator’s obligation to ensure documentation of all relevant data in the subject’s 
medical record. The subject’s medical record will be considered the source document. The eCRF 
should not be used as the source for study information.  
The investigator will maintain a subject identificatio n code list to enable unambiguous 
identification of the subjects (subject names and corresponding subject numbers). The subject 
identification code list is an essential document and as such should be maintained according to 
the ICH GCP guidelines.  
10.9.  Retentio n of Records  
All documentation pertaining to the study will be kept by [CONTACT_624260].  
The investigator will maintain a study file, which should be used to file the Investigator Brochure,  
protocol, and IMP records; correspondence with the IRB and Humacyte; and other study -related 
documents.  
The investigator agrees to keep records and those documents that include (but are not limited to) 
the identification of all participating subjects, med ical records, study -specific source documents, 
source worksheets, all original signed and dated informed consent forms, query responses, and 
detailed records of drug disposition to enable evaluations or inspections from regulatory 
authorities and Humacyte or its designees.  
The investigator shall retain records required to be maintained under this part for a period of 
[ADDRESS_831273] -PRO -V004   Version 4.0  
 
65 of 76 which it is being investigated; or, if no ap plication is to be filed or if the application is not approved 
for such indication, until 5  years after the investigation is discontinued. However, these documents 
should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_8146]( s) or if 
needed by [CONTACT_456]. In addition, the investigator must make provision for the subject’s medical 
records to be kept for the same period of time. No data should be destroyed without the agreement 
of Humacyte. Humacyte will inform the investigator  in writing when the trial -related records are no 
longer needed. Subject’s medical records and other original data will be archived in accordance 
with the archiving regulations or facilities of the study site.  
10.10.  Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is a ny noncompliance with the protocol or GCP requirements. The 
noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. 
As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_624261]. Although in principle protocol deviations are not permitted, under emergency 
circumstances, deviations may proceed without prior approval of the sponsor and the IRB to 
protect the rights, safety, and well -being of human subjects.  
All protocol de viations will be documented and reported by [CONTACT_624262]. All deviations will be reported to the sponsor who will agree on the 
necessary actions to be taken.  
If required per their guidelines, reports abou t protocol deviations must be reported to the local 
IRB. 
10.11.  Insurance and Indemnity  
Insurance coverage for damages emerging from the study will be provided according to applicable 
legal requirements. During the informed consent procedure, the investigator must inform the 
patient accordingly.  
10.12.  Audit  
It is the responsibility of CRO and Huma cyte to perform auditing (if applicable) as part of 
implementing quality assurance. The purpose of an audit, which is independent of and separate 
from routine monitoring or quality control functions, is to evaluate trial conduct and compliance 
with the pro tocol, SOPs, GCPs, and the applicable regulatory requirements. The auditor and 
regulatory authorities will require authority from the investigator to have direct access to the 
subject’s medical records.  
Humacyte, Inc.  Confidential  [ADDRESS_831274] operating procedures, the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is 
conducted and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the 
protocol, GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirements. Reports of monitoring activities will 
be submitted to Humacyte in a timely manner.  
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related areas, source data/documents, 
and reports for  the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456], and inspection by [CONTACT_12291].  
Quality control procedures will be implemented for data entry and the generation of data quality 
control checks and will be run on the database. Any  missing data or data anomalies will be 
communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution.

Abbreviations: AEs, adverse events; D, day; ECG, electrocardiogram; ET, early termination; HAV, human acellular vessel; M, month; PRA, panel reactive antibody.  
NOTE: Visits should be performed using the following time windows: Screening, Day -35 to -1; Day 5 (or prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], if earlier); Day 29, ±  4 days; 
Months 3,6,9,12, ± 14 days  
1 Physical examination includes focused vascular clinical exam of HAV site (incl. patency assessment) and physical exam for lym phadenopathy (at D5 and 
D29) and to evaluate AEs.  
[ADDRESS_831287] through Month 60  
 
If, at any of the scheduled visits through Month 12, duplex ultrasound surveillance suggests the development of a ≥ 50% 
stenosis within the HAV but immediate intervention is not required closer follow up should be considered. Intervention to 
manage any suc h stenosis is at the discretion of the investigator taking into account the degree and rate of progression of 
the stenosis.

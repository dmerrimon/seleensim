 Study Design:   
This is a phase 3 , multicenter, randomized vehicle controlled, double blind parallel group study  to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of A -101 45 % vs Vehicle in subjects with common warts . Investig ators 
will be required to identify at least 1 and up to 6 clearly identifiable c ommon warts for treatment with 
A-101 study medication.  All  identified common warts  will be treated twice a week for up to 8 weeks  
(maximum of 16 treatment applications) . Subje cts will be followed for [ADDRESS_335284] s will be randomized to one of 2  treatment arms in a 1: [ADDRESS_335285].   
 Safety will be evaluated based on clinical laboratory studies (hematology and clinical chemistry), vital 
signs, assessment of local skin reactions (LSRs), assessment of adverse events (AEs), physical exams, 
and concomitant medication review.   
 
Efficacy will be evaluated based on assessment of each identified common wart  according to the 
Physician  Wart  Assessment (P WA)scale .  The Investigator should NOT refer to any other assessments or 
previous assessments  to assist with this evaluation.  
 
Sites  will be required to take standardized color photographs to assist with the documentation of the 
appearance and location of each identified common wart  throughout the study.  These photographs 
are not to be used when performing the PWA.   
 
Number of Patie nts to be Enrolled:  
 Approximately 500 subjects will be randomized to the study.   
Number of Study Sites:  
 
This study will be conducted in the US only at approximately 25 treatment centers.

 5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Summary  
Warts are benign proliferations of the skin and mucosa that are caused by [CONTACT_274290][INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV) family.  Cutaneous HPV subtypes are a subset of this large 
group of the DNA papi[INVESTIGATOR_274252]. 
HPVs are ubiquitous in the environment and infection occurs most commonly through direct contact [CONTACT_274291] (evident  lesions) or sub- clinically, indirectly through exposure to 
contaminated surfaces, or even by [CONTACT_160817]. Cutaneous manifestations of HPV infection include common warts (verruca vulgaris), palmar and 
plantar warts, mosa ic warts, flat warts, and butcher’s warts. Common warts are generally small, rounded, 
hyperkeratotic, exophytic dome -shaped papules or nodules and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_160768] 
1, [ADDRESS_335306] com monly located on the fingers (including 
periungual and subungual regions), dorsal surfaces of the hands, and sites prone to trauma ( e.g., knees, 
elbows), but commonly occur at virtually any other anatomical location, potentially spreading by 
[CONTACT_274292]/hand lesions . 
In immunocompetent individuals, many common cutaneous warts (up to 2/3rds in some reports) may spontaneously resolve in less than [ADDRESS_335307] for many years, may be large and/or cosmetically unsightl y (e.g., face, hands), spread to distant anatomical regions by [CONTACT_160819], be painful 
and/or prone to trauma, and, importantly, provide a significant reservoir of HPV infection in the community, placing (especially immunocompromised) individuals at ri sk for significant morbidity . 
There are currently no specific antiviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_274253] -approved topi[INVESTIGATOR_274254]. Existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], many of which are off -
label uses of drugs approved for other indications, and many of which have never undergone the drug 
approval process, are  of unproven safety and/or efficacy, and are generally directed towards either the direct

Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is a compound that is ubiquitous in the environment. It is the simplest peroxide 
and a potent oxidizing agent commonly used in innumerable household goods including chlorine -free 
bleaches, general -purpose cleaning products, and disinfectants. Additionally, H 2O2 has been employed as the 
oxidizing component in hair dyes, and has been used in oral hygiene products and tooth- whitening systems 
for many years. In industry, it is employed in the treatment of wastewater. In high concentrations, it is used 
in bleaching paper, pulp, and textiles. Clinically, in addition to its use as an oral topi[INVESTIGATOR_160777], 
H2O2 is widely employed at low concentrations ( e.g., 3%-6%) as a wound irrigant and topi[INVESTIGATOR_274258]/disinfectant, and has been in use medicinally since its introduction into clinical practice by 
[CONTACT_160821] 1858.  ( Schumb, 1955)  (Chan, 200 8) (Richardson, 1866) (Richardson, 1891) (Watt, 2004) 
(Zonios, 2007) . 
H2O2 is an important oxidizing agent in biological systems. The local deleterious effects of reactive oxygen 
species on the skin are mitigated by [CONTACT_46917] a complex antioxidant defense system that includes, enzymes such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, thioredoxin reductase, lipoamine, 
lipid peroxidase and others, as well as non- enzymatic components including ascorbic acid, urates and uric 
acid, tocopherol, glutathione, ubiquinones, ubiquinol and other water -soluble groups.  The local application 
of supra -physi ologic concentrations of H
2O2 may overwhelm the antioxidant defense systems in the skin, 
allowing H 2O2 to act not only through its direct oxidation of organic tissues, generation of reactive oxygen 
species, and local lipid peroxidation, but also by [CONTACT_274294] O 2 that are toxic to 
the abnormal lesional (seborrheic keratosis) cells .

Group Study of A -101 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_274263] a Week in Subjects with 
Common Warts  (n=159).  
 
The results from Study A -101-WART -201 evaluated two concentrations of A-101 (H2O2) 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_28198]: 40% and 45% (w/w) compared with vehicle. The 45% (w/w) concentrations 
demonstrated clinically and statistically significant results in clearing warts  while the 40% 
concentration had no effect when compared with vehicle. Therefore, A -101 40% topi[INVESTIGATOR_274264] 2

showed that the 45% concentration applied once weekly resulted in a clinicall y and 
statistically significant clearing of warts at the end of the treatment period (Day 56) and at the 
end of a [ADDRESS_335311]- treatment follow- up (Day 134).  
 
The results from Study A -101-WART -203, which evaluated a 45% concentration of A -101

treatment with the A-101 study medication treatment .  However , treatment with the A -101 study 
medication should not be applied if any  of the following criteria apply to the identified common wart : 
• The common wart  has a pre-treatment LSR grade of 3 (severe) for any sign or sy mptom AND 
the grade has increased compared to the previous visit.  
• The common wart  is, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], not appropriate for a retreatment (the 
investigator must note the reason on the subject’s Comments CRF page).  
• The common wart , in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], cannot be visualized so the Investigator cannot 
assess the PWA.  
 If the identified common wart  meets the criteria for re -treatment during the in -office visit  (PWA>0), 
then the subject/parent/legal guardian should treat the common wart  at home on the protocol defined 
at home treatment days ( Days 4, 11, 18, 25, 32, 39, 46, 5 3.  A window of +1 day is allowed ).  If the 
subject is unable to tolerate treatment the day of an at home treatment visit due to severe skin 
irritation, then the treatment should be held and the investigational site should be notified.

assessments to assist with this evaluation. This evaluation IS NOT a comparison with the PWA  
performed  at any other  visit.  
  At every study visit, the Investigator will assess each identified common wart  and report the one 
integer that best describes the common wart  severity using the following scale. At any visit where a 
study medication treatment is performed, the PWA must be completed prior to the treatment 
visit.

2 A visible wart  ≥ 3 mm and < 6 mm in maximal diameter (or length)  
3 A visible wart ≥ 6 mm in maximal diameter (or length)  
The physician is encouraged to use a ruler or caliper and to feel the wart or skin area to help his/her assessment.  
At Visit [ADDRESS_335352] a PWA grade ≥ 2. 
At Visits [ADDRESS_335353] a PWA > 0 to be retreated. If the Investigator 
cannot assess the PWA for a common wart  (e.g., the common wart  cannot be visualized because of 
an LSR such as edema, scabbing, etc.) she/he must report the reason in the subject’s CRFs. The 
identified common wart  must not be retreated at that visit, and the subject should be seen at the next 
scheduled visit.  All at home treatment visits will be based on the PWA score during the in -office 
visit.

necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug.  An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study, or significant worsening of the disease under 
study (or any concurrent disease), whether or not considered related to the study drug.  
Accordingly, an adverse event could include any of the following : 
• intercurrent illnesses ; 
• physical injuries ; 
• events possibly related to concomitant medication ; 
• significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under 
study or other pre -existing conditions.  (N
OTE: A condition, recorded as pre -existing, 
that is intermittently symptomatic [e.g., headache] and which occurs during the study 
should be recorded as an adverse event ); 
• Drug interactions; 
• Events occurring during diagnostic procedures or any washout phase of the study;  
• laboratory or diagnostic test abnorma lities occurring after the start of the study (i.e., 
after screening and once confirmed by [CONTACT_15013]) that results in the withdrawal of the patient from the study, requires medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up, 
or is considered by [CONTACT_274306].  N
OTE: 
Abnormal laboratory test results at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study or receiving study treatment are not considered adverse events, but 
will be recorded to monitor data  from patients who do not meet screening criteria . 
Worsening of any of the identified common wart assessments should be reported as an 
AE ONLY if the use of the study medication is interrupted or discontinued or if therapy 
is required to manage the event . 
The investigator must, for any common wart  related AE, question the subject in detail 
to determine if there are any confounding factors ( e.g., irritation by [CONTACT_274307], 
sunburn) for any such AE . 
The investigator should, when certain, report a diag nosis rather than the signs, symptoms or 
clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. Otherwise, signs, symptoms or abnormal laboratory values may be used to describe the AE . 
Any C S abnormality discovered prior to the first study medication treatment should be 
reported as medical history, not as an AE .

    14.1.2. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death ; 
• Is life threatening ; 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] ; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or  
• Is an important medical event . 
 
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the su bject was at risk of death at the time of 
event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.  
 
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274281] -
patient basis, even if released the same day. Prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274282] . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre- existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE . 
 Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but are clearly of major clinical significance and may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definition above. These should also usually 
be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home 
for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
 
14.1.3. Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The investigator must start reporting non- serious AEs starting with the subject’s first study 
medication tr eatment continuing until Visit [ADDRESS_335362] signs the informed consent and continues until Visit 
11 (regardless of relationship to study medication).  If a subject  experiences a SAE after Visit [ADDRESS_335363] appropriate according to her/his medical judgment.  
Mild  – Awareness of signs or symptom,  but easily tolerated  
Moderate  – Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity  
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 
Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019  
 57  
    Severe – Incapacitating with inability to perform usual activity . 
14.1.5. Relationship to Study Medication 
The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study 
medication and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical judgment and consider all relevant factors ( e.g., temporal relationship, location of the event, the subject’s 
relevant medical history, concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_118199]) to determine the relationship of the AE to the study medication. The investigator will define the relationship of an AE to the study medication by [CONTACT_118238] . 
Related  – There is a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the study 
medication and the AE.  
Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship 
between the study medication and the AE . 
The term “reasonab le causal relationship” means there are facts or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship (International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A . 
14.2. Reporting Procedures  
14.2.1. Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  
At each post enrollment visit, the investigator or designee will question the subject to elicit AEs using a non- directive question such as “Has there been any change in your health since the 
previous study visit?”   
The Investigator/designee will monitor t he subject for at least [ADDRESS_335364]’s response to non- directed questioning regarding AEs, the 
investigator or designee will follow -up with directed questions and appropriate evaluations . 
Any AE noted during the reporting period must be reported in the source documents and on the appropriate AE CRF . 
AEs that are defined as “Not Related” to the study medications will be followed until they are resolved or until the subject’s last study visit. AEs that are defined as “Related” to the study 
medications will be followed until they are resolved or, if not resolved after the subject’s last 
study visit, until in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the AE reaches a clinically stable outcome 
with or without sequelae . 
14.2.2. Procedure for Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Upon becoming aware of a SAE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether or not re lated 
to the study medications, the investigator must:  
1. 
Take the appropriate medical action to ensure the subject’s safety  
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 
Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019  
 58  
    2. Immediately inform  Aclaris of the SAE:  
Serious Adverse Event Facsimile:  484 -324-2359  
 
3. Within 24- hours of becoming aware of the event, a SAE report form, an AE CRF and any other 
relevant information ( e.g., concomitant medication CRF, medical history CRF, laboratory test 
results) must be faxed to the SAE Fax line listed above. 
4. Monitor and document the progre ss of the SAE until it resolves or, if not resolved after the subject’s 
last study visit, until in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_118200] a clinically stable outcome 
with or without sequelae AND the investigator and Drug Safety Monitor  agree that t he SAE is 
satisfactorily resolved.  
5. Inform the Drug Safety Monitor  of SAE updates by [CONTACT_274308] e -mail.  
Comply with the appropriate regulatory requirements and Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. instructions 
regarding  reporting of the SAE to the responsible Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics 
Committee (EC) . 
14.2.3. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event  
Any patient who experiences an adverse event may be withdrawn from study drug at any time at the discretion of the invest igator.  If a patient is withdrawn wholly or in part because of an 
adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed at that time.  The patient will be monitored until the event has resolved or stabilized, until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made, or until the 
patient is referred to the care of a local health care professional.  The investigator must inform 
the medical monitor as soon as possible of all patients who a re being considered for withdrawal 
due to adverse events.  Additional reports must be provided when requested .

Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 
Amendment 3: Version [ADDRESS_335365] 26% for Active compared with 9% for 
Vehicle is anticipated.  Assuming a distribution of  treated warts per subject comparable to the 
Phase [ADDRESS_335366] responder rates  (all treated warts with PWA= 0) for Active over Vehicle groups of at least 11 
percentage points.  This le ads to a required sample size for the current study of approximately 
500 subjects to provide greater than 90% power to achieve statistical significance in the primary efficacy analysis . This projection tak es into account the impact  of the anticipated  subje ct dropout 
rate on power for the primary efficacy analysis, based on the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population 
and planned missing data imputation procedures.  
Additionally, a simulation was conducted in a manner that accounted for the distribution of 
multiple warts, the treatment effect in clearance between the different warts and the correlation in wart clearance among multiple warts.  Specific details of the s imulation are described in the 
SAP.  Results of this simulation indicate that data from 500 subjects (250 per group) will provide 
97% power to demonstrate the superiority of 45% A -101 topi[INVESTIGATOR_274283].  
15.2. Analysis of Popu lations 
The populations used for analyses will be defined as follows:  
• Intent -to-Treat Population (ITT): The ITT population includes all randomized subjects.  
• Per-Protocol Population (PP):  The PP Population includes all subjects who received at 
least one application of study medication and have no major protocol violations. 
• Safety Population: The Safety population includes all subjects who received at least one application of study medication. 
15.3. Statistical Analysis of Efficacy  
The ITT population will be used for primary and secondary efficacy analyses and summaries.  
The ITT population is defined as all subjects randomized to the study and analyzed as 
randomized.  The Per -Protocol (PP) population will be used for sensitivity analyses for the 
primary efficacy analysis an d all secondary efficacy analyses included in the hierarchical testing 
procedure.   Details on all analyses discussed below will be provided in the study Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  
The primary efficacy analysis will be a treatment compari son of A -101 45% compared to 
Vehicle at Visit 10 (Day 60).  It will be based on the proportion of subjects who achieve 
complete clearance (PWA=0) of all identified common warts.  A Cochran Mantel Haenszel 
(CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_274309], Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 
Amendment 3: Version [ADDRESS_335367] sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint will be an analysis based upon the PP 
population.  This analysis will use the same CMH model described for the primary analysis.   A 
second  sensitivity analysis will be conducted  for the primary endpoint using the same CMH 
model  for the ITT  population that includes  the imputation of missing PWA data using a fully 
conditionally specified (FCS) regression -based Multiple Imputation (MI) procedure . To assess 
the impact of missing data imputation on the primary analysis results a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_274284].  This analysis will shift the treatment coefficient in the regression model use d in 
the MI procedure to impose a worse mean maximum PWA for the A -101 45% arm and a better 
mean maximum PWA for the vehicle arm.   Details of this tippi[INVESTIGATOR_274285].  In addition, a model similar to the primary analysis mo del but stratified instead by 
[CONTACT_274289] a sensitivity analysis including a Breslow -Day test to evaluate 
heterogeneity across sites.   
Four  secondary efficacy analyses will be performed and tested in a hierarchical Fixed -Sequence ste p-
down method  to control alpha among secondary efficacy variables .  The predefined order of the tests is 
specified to be the order of these analyses as presented below.  All analyses will be conducted at the 
same alpha level ( 2-tail alpha = 0.05).  The res ults of the second analysis will only be reported if the first 
analysis reaches statistical significance at alpha = 0.05.  The results of the third analysis will only be 
reported if the first and second analyses reach statistical significance, each at alph a = 0.05.  The results 
of the fourth analysis will only be reported if the first, second and third analyses reach statistical 
significance , each at alpha = 0.05.  Each of the analys es will focus on the outcome of identified common 
warts at specified time p oints.   
The first secondary analysis will evaluate the effectiveness of A -101 45% compared to Vehicle at Visit 13 
(Day 137).  It will be based on the proportion of subjects who achieve complete clearance (PWA=0) of all 
identified common warts.  A Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test identical to the primary efficacy 
analysis model and stratified by [CONTACT_274310], with [ADDRESS_335368] analyses, the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275], and  
the site heterogeneity analysis.       
The second  secondary efficacy analysis will be based on a comparison between A -101 45% and 
Vehicle of the mean per -subject percent of treated warts that are Clear  (PWA=0)  at Visit 13 (Day 
137), using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with 2- tail alpha set at 0.05. 
The third secondary efficacy analysis will be a comparison between A -101 45% and Vehicle of 
the proportion of subjects with a single wa rt at baseline, whose wart is Clear (PWA=0)  at Visit 
10, using a CMH test stratified by [CONTACT_274311], with 2 -tail alpha set at 0.05 .

    The fourth  secondary efficacy analysis will a comparison between A -101 45% and Vehicle s 
with respect to the median time to achieve onset  of Clearance (PWA=0)  for all treated warts .  It 
will be conducted as a comparison of median time for a subject to first achieve C learance 
(PWA=0) of all treated warts , using a log rank test  with [ADDRESS_335369] , where time -to-event  curves will be compared with 
two-tail alpha = 0.05, and median time to event will be presented f or each treatment group. For 
each subject t he time to achieve onset of complete treated wart Clearance will be calculated from 
the date of randomization to the earliest visit date when all treated warts are clear.  In the event a 
subject does not attain co mplete wart Clearance, that subject’s time -to-event data will be treated 
as censored for the Kaplan -Meier analysis.    
15.4. Statistical Analysis of Safety Data  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated on the safety parameters using the Safety  Population and using 
actual treatment received . The proportion of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events will be 
tabulated and presented by [CONTACT_160843] (MedDRA) 
System Organ Class. Vital signs, LSR sco res and clinically relevant abnormal laboratory results will also be 
tabulated and presented by [CONTACT_160844]. No inferential testing will be performed.  
 
 Safety summaries by [CONTACT_274312], and changes from  pre-application values in vital 
signs. Adverse event summaries will be presented by  [CONTACT_118245], both  overall and by  [CONTACT_7204].   The version of 
MedDRA to be used for the analysis of this study will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

eliminate immediate safety concerns to the  study subjects  or when the change involves only 
logistics or administration.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_274286] . 
16.2. Protocol Violations 
A protocol violation  is defined as any divergence from the protocol -specif ic inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, subject is administered a prohibited medication , and/or GCP guidelines .  Protocol 
violations will be identified and recorded, by [CONTACT_223060], on the CRF . 
As a matter of policy, sponsor/CRO will not grant exceptions  to protocol -specific entry criteria 
to allow patients to enter a study.  If under extraordinary circumstances such action is considered ethically, medically, and scientifically justified for a particular patient, prior approval from sponsor/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, in accordance with the Sponsor/CROs Standard 
Operating Procedure (SOP), is required before the patient will be allowed to enter the study.  If 
investigative center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol eligib ility criteria 
was entered in a study (a protocol violation), they must immediately inform sponsor/CRO.  Such 
subjects  will be discontinued from the study, except in a rare instance following review and 
written approval by [CONTACT_3211]/CRO and the responsible I RB/IEC, according to the applicable SOP . 
16.3. Training  
For each investigational center, there will be an initiation visit prior to enrolling any study 
subjects . 
It is strongly recommended that all investigators, other evaluators, study nurses, study coordinator s or other applicable personnel attend this visit.  During this visit, participants will be 
trained to the protocol, study specific procedures, and the CRFs.  Those unable to attend the initiation visit must receive on -site training from an appropriately trained individual prior to 
participating in any of the procedures and evaluations in this study . 
Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) and other applicable personnel will be trained prior to study initiation to familiarize CRAs with the disease, the Standard  Operating Procedures (SOPs), 
the protocol and other study specific items.  Team organization, communication and operational issues will also be discussed . 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. will provide an investigational center file to each center .

CR-RR2015- [ADDRESS_369488]- operative pulmonary complications (PPC) are associated with significant excess 
morbidity, mortality and healthcare expenditure. The incidence of “important” PPCs, across 
all surgeries, is approximately 2 -5% in the general surgical population. There ar e factors, 
however, that place certain patients, and patients with certain procedures, at considerably higher risk for PPCs. One of the key factors in development of PPCs is the type of surgery. Following upper abdominal and thoracic surgery, pulmonary com plications are the most 
common surgical complications. Other risk factor s include advanced age, American Society 
of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification score > 2, functional dependency, 
congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Of these, ASA score > 
[ADDRESS_369489] -operative respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (PRF). PRF requiring prolonged 
mechanical ventilation (MV) or re -intubati on accounts for the majority of poor outcomes and 
high economic costs.
[1-4] Other risk factors that have been associated with increased risk of 
PPCs include history of COPD, smoking history and BMI > 30 kg/m2. [1-5] 
Although P
PCs are an incompletely understood multifactorial syndrome, atelectasis is 
recognized as a critical component .[6] Evidence has shown that atelectasis is a common 
precursor and concomitant feature of PPCs. Nearly all patients undergoing major surgery experience some degree of tran sitory, clinically unimportant atelectasis, most of these 
patients do not require aggressive therapy. There is, however, a more urgent need to treat atelectasis in subpopulations of high-risk individuals, in order to prevent more serious complications including progression to PRF.
[7]   
A variety of strategies have been shown to reduce the risk for development of post -operative 
atelectasis to at least some degree. These include but are not limited to pain control, monitoring of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -depressing medications, selective use of nasogastric 
decompression, secretion mobilization techniques and lung expansion (LE) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .
[6-9] 
However, the generally poor quality of clinical trials to evaluate these methods provides only limited, inconclusive evidence of efficacy. Among published studies, LE using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) breathing, particularly when used in hypoxemic high- risk 
patients, is the only modality to date demonstrating comparatively strong evidence .
[10,11] In a 
systematic review of qualifying randomized controlled trials (RCT), Lawrence et al sought 
to evaluate interventions intended to reduce the incidence of atelectasis, pneumonia and PRF following non- cardiothoracic surgery .
[11]  Their meta- analysis pooling all eligible studies  to 
determine “strength of evidence” found that only LE therapy merited a grade of “A”. These

LE therapy techniques included incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (IS), deep breathing techniques, chest 
physiotherapy (CPT), intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) an d continuous 
positive pressure (CPAP). Although data did not permit identification of a “best” modality, they did allow the conclusion that all lung expansion therapi[INVESTIGATOR_302341] > 50% compared with no treatment. Well -designed studies are needed to di stinguish which LE 
approach has the greatest potential to optimize patient care, clinical outcomes and cost savings. 
1.2 Research Rationale and Supporting Evidence Among LE devices, Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) devices have been in use 
for more than [ADDRESS_369490] clearance therapy (ACT) for patients with obstructive and/or restrictive lung diseases and conditions. The safety and efficacy of IPV 
have been demonstrated in clinical and laboratory studies.
[12-34]  
The MetaNeb® System is an LE expansion modality that incorporates all the physiological 
effects of IPV while providing additional therapeutic advantages intended primarily  to more 
effectively treat or prevent pulmonary atelectasis. Equipment consists of a pneumatic compressor that delivers continuous high- frequency oscillation (CHFO) and positive 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (CPEP) to 1) facilitate clearance of mucous from the lungs ; 2) provide 
lung expansion therapy and; 3) enhance delivery of aerosol therapy. This “triple” mode device can provide aerosol therapy while alternating between CPEP for lung expansion and CHFO for airway clearance. Supplemental oxygen therapy may also be delivered when used 
with compressed oxygen. The MetaNeb
® System has been cleared to market by [CONTACT_302384]. Clinical studies of The MetaNeb® System, however, 
are limited. The only peer -reviewed publication to date is a case report concerning a patient 
who on her 17th hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19156], following an adverse medication reaction, developed severe 
atelectasis secondary to toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] (Stevens - Johnson Syndrome). After 
initiation o
f therapy with The MetaNeb® System, atelectasis was completely resolved by 
[CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_19156] 21. The patient was discharged on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19156] 25 without further pulmonary complications .
[35] In addition to this publication, however, a number of abstracts and other 
reports have been presented or publ ished. An abstract presented at the American Association 
for Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1511] (AARC) Congress in 2009, found that patients participating in a progressive pulmonary protocol in an oncologic intensive care unit and who received LE therapy with either IPV or The MetaNeb
® System  had significantly better post- therapy chest 
x-ray results compared with patients treated with The Vest® System and EZ PAP .[35] An
earlier case study report presented at the AARC Congress in [ADDRESS_369491]-thoracosc opic surgical patient in respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]. The patient was treated with The

MetaNeb® System, expectorated large amounts of tenacious secretions, and after only [ADDRESS_369492] radiographs showed improved aeration 
and there was a reduction in oxygen requirement .[37] In a long- term care treatment protocol 
with intubated or tracheostomised patients on MV, patients were treated with The MetaNeb® 
System for 10 minutes every 6 hours until decanulation or discharge. Quality improvement results showed improvement in the percentage of patients weaned from MV along with a decrease in the need for bronchoscopy .
[38] Two more recent studies have been presented at 
conferences and await full -text publication. Patel et al. reported on a randomized parallel 
study comparing outcomes in 32 adult CF patients with severe pulmonary exacerbations and admitted for IV therapy. Patients were randomized to treatment with either The MetaNeb
® 
System or The Vest® System for up to 14 days. In this setting, results were positive but 
comparable.[39] Morgan, et al. investigated the feasibility, safety and efficacy of CHFO 
administered via The MetaNeb® System to [ADDRESS_369493] that CHFO may be beneficial by [CONTACT_302385] -induced atelectasis .
[40] 
1.3 Rationale for the Proposed Study 
Preliminary and anecdotal evidence suggests that use of The MetaNeb® System may be 
effective in postoperative patients prone to atelectasis and PPCs. The proposed study is 
intended to evaluate the effectiveness of this therapy in reducing the incidence of these complications in comparison to standard treatment.

3.5 Statistic
al Methods and Analysis  
3.5.1 Sample Size Estimation: 
This study is designed to provide information on the benefits of the addition of the MetaNeb
® System in reducing the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications 
(PPCs) in high -risk subjects undergoing high- risk surgical procedures (upper 
abdominal, thoracic, aortic).  The study will be conducted in 2 stages: 
•Stage I: To update/confirm the estimate of the current incidence of PPC’s with
current Standard of Care Practice. Recent published articles suggest incidence rates
between 5% -15%, depending on the patient population and type of surgery. This
stage of the s tudy will be a retrospective pre-intervention observational period,
conducted at 2 - 4 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]/ sites, with no intervention in the patients’ post -surgical

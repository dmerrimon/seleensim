2. Introduction 
This is the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for th e study titled “Early Cognitive Intervention in 
Delirium (ECID)” randomized trial.  This study was sponsored by [CONTACT_45429] 
(5R01AG065249).   
 
3. Background and Rationale 
Delirium is a form of acute brain failure that afflicts 17% of older emergency department (ED) 
and 25% of older hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643].1-4 Delirium is associated with accelerated long-term 
cognitive decline particularly in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD).
5-[ADDRESS_390064] been ineffective in improving 
outcomes.18-20 Cognitive training and rehabilitation may be a feasible intervention to preserve 
long-term cognition in delirious patients,21 but to our knowledge, has not been rigorously 
evaluated in older hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317034].   
 
4. Objectives 
To address this dearth in knowledge, we conducted a randomized trial with the following 
objective:  
Determine if early (< 24 hours) cognitive training performed twice daily during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317035] 12-weeks post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317036] 4-month global cognition in older delirious patients with and without ADRD.   We hypothesize that early cognitive training and 
rehabilitation will improve 4-month global cognition in older delirious patients with and without ADRD compared with structured usual care.  
 5. Study Population

6. Treatment arms  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317038] 1:2 ratio using permuted block 
randomization to either cognitive training and rehabilitation intervention or structured usual care 
defined as follows: 
 Intervention: Two daily 20-minute cognitive training sessions were administered during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317039] 24 hours of ED presentation.  The level of difficulty of the training was tailored to the patient’s current level of cognitive 
functioning. Cognitive rehabilitation was administered in the patient’s home within 1 week after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  Patients received cognitive rehabilitation once a week for 
12 weeks with each session lasting approximately 1 hour.   
 Usual care:  Daily delirium assessment without cognitive training occurred during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. No cognitive rehabilitation was performed in the usual care arm.  
 
7. Outcomes 7.1. Primary outcome at 4-months 
The primary outcomes for ECID was global cognition at 4-months, as determined by a 
comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Global cognition was assessed for using the 
Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) . The 
RBANS is a comprehensive neuropsychological battery for the evaluation of global cognition

 and has been validated in subjects with mild cognitive impairment, moderate to severe traumatic 
brain injuries, vascular dementias, and Alzheimer’s disease.23-27 In addition to providing a score 
for global cognition, it also provides individual scores for immediate and delayed memory, attention, visuospatial construction, and language.  Scores range from 40 to 160, with higher scores indicating better cognition.  
 
 
7.2. Secondary Outcome s at 4-months are listed in Table 2.  
   Study Assessment Description 
Executive function score Based on the Delis–Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Proverbs subscale (conceptual flexibility), the DKEFS Color Word 
Interference (inhibition), and DKEFS Verbal Fluency Category 
Switching subscale (monitoring).28  Scores range from 1 to 18, 
with higher scores indicating better executive function.  
Older American 
Resources and Services 
Activities of Daily Living 
Scale (OARS ADL)29 Assesses functional status and is based on 7 basic and 7 
instrumental activities of daily living. Scores range from 0 
(completely dependent) to 28 (completely independent). 
EQ-5D-5L 30-32 EQ-5D-5L characterizes quality of life and contains 5-dimensions (“5D”) related to everyday living: mobility, self-care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. EQ-5D-5L 
index values, validated for the US population, were calculated, 
and higher scores represented better quality of life.
[ADDRESS_390067] quality of life, whereas a score 
<0.0 indicates quality of life worse than death. The EQ-5D-5L also  
asks patients to grade their current global health status from 0 
(worst health you can imagine) to 100 (best health you can 
imagine). 
Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment34  This is a brief test of global cognition based on attention and 
concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and 
orientation.  Scores range from [ADDRESS_390068] review or informant interview.

8. Statistical Methods  
 
8.1. Descriptive Analysis  
To characterize the study sample, demographic, clinical, and lab data will be described overall 
and by [CONTACT_2939].  Categorical variables will be described using frequencies and 
proportions; continuous variables will be described using means and standard deviations as well Study Assessment Description 
Individual RBANS subscale domains Scores for each RBANS individual cognitive will be reported - Immediate and delayed memory, attention, language, visuospatial 
construction. 
Individual D-KEF domains Individual scores for each DKEF Subscale that make up the 
Executive Function Composite Score will be reported - Proverbs 
(conceptual scale flexibility), Color Word Interference (inhibition), 
and Verbal Fluency Category switching (monitoring). 
Clinical Frailty Score35 Characterizes frailty and is based on comorbidities, functional status, and cognition. This scale ranges from 0 (no frailty) to 9 
(terminally ill). 
Life Space Assessment
36  Characterizes mobility and physical activity by [CONTACT_7939] 9 questions characterizing the patient’s movement within his/her environment 
over the past [ADDRESS_390069] review or informant interview.

 as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) when appropriate. For the proportional odds logistic 
and logistic regression models, odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) 
will be presented.     
 
8.2. Primary outcome analysis:    
Our primary analysis will be an intention-to-treat comparison of 4-month global cognition between those who receive and do not receive the cognitive training and rehabilitation 
intervention.  The association of 4-month global cognition with the cognitive intervention vs 
usual care will be assessed using proportional odds logistic regression adjusting for a priori 
defined covariates as listed below in order of priority depending on the degrees of freedom available for each outcome:

[ADDRESS_390074] one degree of freedom available for every 10 to 15 patients with completed outcome measurements.
47  If the number of RBANS completed (our primary 
outcome) is lower than expected, then we will reduce the number of covariates incorporated into the model to minimize overfitting. We will evaluate if the covariates are highly correlated with

 each other; if two variables are highly correlated, the lesser priority covariate will be removed.  
We will not adjust for site (VUMC vs Nashville VA), because the proportion of patients enrolled 
in the Nashville VA is anticipated to be < 10% of those enrolled. Post-randomization covariates 
(e.g., interventions provided during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will not be adjusted for because they may 
potentially be affected by [CONTACT_317053].   
Unadjusted and adjusted medians with their interquartile ranges (IQR) will be reported for the 
intervention and usual groups. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with their 95% 
confidence intervals (95%CI) will also be reported.  
 
Multiple imputation for missing covariates based on predictive mean matching will be performed. As with our previous studies, multiple imputation will also be performed for RBANS with partially 
missing cognitive domains.
9,48,49 If < 5% of the RBANS is partially missing, then single 
imputation using a model-based approach will be used to calculate the RBANS global score.  If > 5% of RBANS is partially missing, then multiple imputation will be performed to calculate the 
RBANS global score.  Patients who had completely missing RBANS were removed from the 
statistical analysis. 
 
8.3. Sensitivity analyses for Primary Outcome:    
Several sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the robustness of our findings:  
1) We will perform a modified per-protocol analysis will be performed where we will 
determine if the total duration of cognitive training and total duration of cognitive 
rehabilitation is associated with our primary outcome.  Participants in the usual care 
group will be assigned cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation durations of 0. 
2) We will also see if the intervention is effective in a subset of patients who are only 
positive for other delirium assessments (bCAM, CAM, 3D-CAM) by [CONTACT_317054]. 
3) To account for the potential differences in survival between the intervention and usual 
care groups, we will treat death as the worst outcome in those who died before the 4-
month follow-up and assign these patients an RBANs score of 39. 
4) To determine how multiple imputation impacted our findings, we will do a complete case 
analysis of patient who had missing RBANS. 
We will re-run the proportional odd logistic regression models using the same covariates as our 
primary analysis.  
 
8.4. Heterogeneity of treatment effect analysis for primary outcome : 
Because detecting a statistical interaction may require significantly greater statistical power than detecting a main effect, a p-value for the interaction term < 0.[ADDRESS_390075] modification 
of the following variables: 
1) Age 2) Severity of illness as defined by [CONTACT_317055] 3) Years of education 
4) Enrollment delirium severity (CAM-S) 
5) Enrollment psychomotor subtype (hypoactive, hyperactive, mixed, normal)  
ECID Randomized  Trial  Statistical  Analysis Plan

7 
 6) Enrollment level of arousal (normal, decreased, increased) 
7) Enrollment etiology (drug, infection, metabolic/endocrine, organ dysfunction, CNS)  
8) Time from ED presentation to randomization, which is a surrogate to time to first 
cognitive intervention 
9) Hopkins Rehabilitation Engagement Rating Scale (HRERS), which is a measure of 
patient engagement with the cognitive intervention.  Patients in the usual care arm will be assigned a score of 0.  
For the heterogeneity of treatment effect analysis, we will re-run the proportional odd logistic regression models using the same cova riates as our primary analysis.  
 
8.5. Analyses for Secondary Outcomes:   All secondary outcomes analyses will be intention-
to-treat using the same approach as our primary outcome.   
1) Multivariable proportional odds logistic regression will be performed for executive 
function composite score, MoCA, OARS ADL, and EQ-5D-5L at 4-months using the 
same covariates.   
2) For 4-month mortality, multivariable logistic regression will be performed.  If there are 
less than 30 events, only a univariate analysis will be performed. 
3) For nursing home placement, multivariable logistic regression will be performed. If there 
are less than [ADDRESS_390076] one degree of freedom available for every 10 to 15 outcomes for our multiple logistic regression models.
47  We will incorporate the covariates in order of importance. 
Proportions and medians with their IQR will be reported for the intervention and usual groups for categorical and continuous outcomes, respectively. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 
with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) will also be reported. 
 
8.6. Analysis for Exploratory Outcomes (4-month and index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]):  All 
exploratory outcomes analyses will be intention-to-treat. For these outcomes, unadjusted 
comparisons using the Wilcoxon Rank-sum test s or chi-squared test will be performed for 
continuous and categorial variables, respectively. Unadjusted odds ratios will be reported. A p-value < 0.[ADDRESS_390077] deviation (SD) of that particular test to 
define the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) threshold. Based on our preliminary 
study,
9  the SD for the RBANS was 12.4, and we considered a 6.0 point difference to be the 
MCID threshold. Based upon a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and 80% power, we will need outcome data in a total of 153 patients (51 intervention and 102 usual care) to detect a 6.[ADDRESS_390078]-to-follow-up rate or withdrawal estimate

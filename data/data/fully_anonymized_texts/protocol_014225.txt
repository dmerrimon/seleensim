1. Abstract 
 
In outer retinal degenera tion, such as retinitis pi[INVESTIGATOR_1802] (RP) , the photoreceptors and their supporting 
retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_169732] a nd destroyed. In RP (incid ence 1:4000) legal blindness 
is reached after [ADDRESS_198126] generation Argus  16. The main differences are th at the Argus II provides more 
independent channels for stimulation and that the Argus II Implant antenn a and electronics are attached to 
the outside of the eye. Like the Argus 16 System, the Argus II system comprises three sub-system 
components: the internal Implant,  the external Video Processing Unit (VPU) and Glasses, and the 
supporting Clinical Fitting System. The critical steps leading to the presen t application are provided below. 
The device was approved by [CONTACT_81775] 2013.  Patients being implanted with the Argus II at JH U will be invited to join the FDA-mandated, SSMP-
sponsored post-approval study (PAS; NA_00087968). The FDA and SSMP have authorized participating 
centers to supplement the FDA protocol with their own ancillary research protocols aimed at improved 
understanding of the Argus II and the potential benefits obtained by [CONTACT_169734], who choose to enroll in the 
PAS (NA_00087968) and ancillary studies. 
 In this ancillary study we are asking Argus II users to perform visual acti vities under different experimental 
conditions, created by [CONTACT_169735] e imagery provided to the VPU. 
 In an amendment (July 2017) we are inviting sighted individuals to perform  experiments similar to those of 
the Argus II users, viewing simulated pr osthetic imagery in a video headset. 
 
2. Objectives  
The objective of this study is  to supplement the FDA-mandated post-approval study (PAS; 
NA_00087968) with additional functional tests and ima ge manipulations that will help us gain a 
better understanding of Argus II use, and potentia l benefits for the implantees.  We will be 
presenting the same visual inform ation (in simulated form  to sighted individuals, to compare their 
performance to that of Argus II users.

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_198127] 2009. As of November  2012, all subjects had been implanted for 
more than 3 years (with exception of one subject whose device was explanted after 14 months), and 
half of the subjects were followe d for over [ADDRESS_198128] been implanted 
(as of November 2012) for a total of over 125 implant -years. Data collected from this trial through 
March 2012 were reported to the FDA in a Huma nitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application. 
The Argus II device was granted HDE status by [CONTACT_169736] 2013. 
 4. Study Procedures  
In addition to the outlined testing in the pos t-approval study (PAS; NA_0 0087968) participants who 
have previously been implanted with an Argus II will be asked to practice specific tasks using their 
Argus II retinal prosthesis system, and perform multiple other functional tests to gain better understanding of their use of the device and  potentia l benefits for future im plantees.  These practice 
tasks and tests may be carried out in the la boratory, at Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (JHH), at 
participant’s home or in the participant’s commun ity. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_169733], interaction with  stationary or moving individua ls and obstacles, wayfinding in 
familiar and unfamiliar settings, a nd self-care.  The imagery provide d to implantees may be filtered 
or enhanced with the objec tive to improve the understand ing by [CONTACT_169737]
.  Two specific 
changes made to the imagery will be the use of a thermal camera that en hances human bodies and 
warm objects in the image, and the use of a distan ce-filtering mechanism that allows us to reduce 
image clutter by [CONTACT_169738]’s range 
of interest. 
In order to test the performance of  these systems in realistic situati ons it is important that they are 
tested in environments where other people are present, such as public spaces around the East 
Baltimore campus.  This raises the issue of vide o recordings, needed for post-hoc analysis of the 
study participant's interaction with the environment, in terms of co rrect detection and identification 
of events, but also of timing, e.g., how long it ta kes a subject to respond to a person passing by, or 
to a potential collision while walking.  In order to avoid inadvertent disclosure of JHM patients 
through such recordings we pr opose the following measures: 
- All video recordings made in JHH areas acce ssible to patients will avoid recording faces by 
[CONTACT_169739]  
- Any videos that inadvertently do capture identifiable 3rd persons will be promptly analyzed for 
participants' performance data, and destroyed  
- Any videos that will be saved for later analysis  will be stored on a server that is not network 
connected 
- Videos to be shown at scientific gatherings will be carefully select ed so no identifiable features 
of 3rd persons are shown 
We will recruit a small cohort of si ghted individuals and ask them to  perform the same experiments 
as the Argus II users, albeit with simula ted rather than real  prosthetic vision. 
All participants will be asked to agree to ha ving their tests audio and/or video recorded. 
 
5. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 
Only those enrolled in the Argus II post-app roval study(PAS; NA_00087968) or other interested 
post FDA-approval Argus II retinal implantees or th e Argus II Retinal Impl ant System feasibility 
study (NA_00008133) will be enrolled in this study.  In the sighted comparison group we will enroll 
adults with normal vision who are in good genera l health.  JHU undergradua tes and employees may 
be included.

 ARGUS II SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: 
The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System consists of the fo llowing main parts: 
• Argus II Retinal Prosthesis (referred to as the “Implant”) 
• Argus II Video Processing Unit (referred to as the “VPU”) 
• Argus II Glasses 
How Does the Argus II System Work? 
Patients will have the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis implanted in and around thei r eyeball. To turn on and 
use the implant, patients need to wear the glasses and VPU.  
When patients are using the system, a miniature video camera on the gla sses captures images in real time. 
The glasses send these images to the VPU.  The VPU c onverts these video images into electrical signals 
and send them back to the glasses. Th e coil on the glasses sends  the signals wirelessly  to the implant. The 
implant then sends out small pulses of  electricity to the retina in the patient's eye. These pulses stimulate 
their surviving secondary cells in the retina.  The reti na sends the nerve signals al ong the optic nerve to the 
brain, and the prosthesis wearer per ceives these pulses as patterns of li ght. Over time, they may learn how 
to interpret these visual pa tterns as objects and shapes.  
Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System(Implant) 
The implant consists of four parts: (1) the electronics case, (2) the implant coil, (3) the electrode array, and 
(4) the scleral band.  
 Only the electrode array goes inside the eye. The elec tronics case, the implant coil and the scleral band sit 
on the outside of the eye. The scleral band wraps around pat ient's eye and holds the implant in place.  The 
conjunctiva, a thin layer of tissue that covers the white  part of the eye also covers the parts of the implant 
that sit on the outside of the eye.  
A ribbon cable connects the electronics package to the electrode array. This cable enters patient's eye 
through an incision made during surgery.  At the end of cable is the electrode arra y. The electrode array is 
fastened over the surface of the retina with a retinal tack. 
The electrode array provides electri cal stimulation to patient's retina. It has [ADDRESS_198129] an electrode that is not working.  
Video Processing Unit (VPU) – External Equipment 
The VPU allows wearers to turn stimulation on and o ff.  Using the buttons on the VPU, they can change 
the stimulation program to suit their current environment.  
The VPU keeps track of when wearers turn it on and o ff, and it keeps a record of how well their implant 
and VPU are functioning.  The VPU also records when there is a disruption in the wireless link between 
the implant and glasses.  The clinician can check all of this informa tion when the wearer visits the clinic. 
Glasses– External Equipment 
The glasses have a miniature video camera in the br idge above the nose.  The glasses also have a coil on 
one of the earpi[INVESTIGATOR_6928].  The coil sends power to the im plant and communicates wirele ssly with it. The glasses 
connect to the VPU with a cable. Patient must wear  both the VPU and glasses for the system to work.

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_198130]-A pproval Study (NA_00087968) and Argus II re tinal Implant Feasibility Study 
(NA_00008133) , all practice and testing will take place under immediate supe rvision of study team 
members.  Moreover, these activities will be no different from those undertaken by [CONTACT_169740].  Therefore, the stud y will not add appreciable risk to that of being 
blind and having a retinal prosthesis system. No additional risks will exist for sighted par ticipants, who will also be closely supervised. 
9. Benefits 
The direct benefits of participation in this st udy may include greater prof iciency in the operation 
and use of the Argus II retinal prosthesis system.  There will be no benefit to sighted participants. 
 
10. Payment and Remuneration 
Sighted participants will receive a modest remune ration ($10/hr), while Argus II users will not be 
paid for this study. Travel reim bursement/lunch vouchers will be offered to all participants. 
 
11. Costs 
Tests will be at no cost to the participants. No additional costs anticipated.

Abstract  
 
Neonates and infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at high risk for perioperative 
bleeding and massive transfusion due to immature coagulation systems, cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_765607], hemodilution, and the complexity of surgeries .  The current treatment for 
post-by[CONTACT_765608], which increases the risk of volume overload, immunologic burden, morbidity, and mortality.   The average number of donor exposures for a neonate undergoing cardiac surgery requiring CBP at Children’s Healthcare of  Atlanta is nine exposures. Targeting 
transfusion strategies and alternative hemostatic agents that would reduce bleeding and 
transfusions would be a significant benefit to these patients.  
 The most common hemostatic derangement after CPB is an acute acquired hypofibrinogenemia, which compromises fibrin clot generation and platelet aggregation, resulting in increased bleeding and need for allogenic blood product transfusions.  Currently, management of this acquired hypofibrinogenemia is replaced with a blood product, cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047]. Fibrinogen concentrate, RiaSTAP  (CSL Bering), is a 
commercially available product that is being used off -label in cardiac and pediatric 
surgery to reduce bleeding and transfusions.  However, a study specifically targeting neonates undergoing open-heart surgery with CPB has not been done to determine the 
efficacy of RiaSTAP  in this population.  
 
In this study, we plan to complete a multi-center randomized, control trial comparing cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_765585].  Secondary outcomes will evaluate perioperative laboratory values, length of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], as well as adverse events. Overall,  we hope to use the results of this study 
to develop alternative transfusion strategies to treat post-CPB bleeding in infants.   
Introduction and Background  
 In patients undergoing open-heart surgery (OHS), transfusion of allogenic blood products is independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality (1,2). In response to this, research in adult cardiac anesthesia has focused on blood product usage and developi[INVESTIGATOR_381111]. Due to the smaller population, considera ble variability in patient characteristics, and wide range of procedures 
performed in pediatric cardiac patients, the literature regarding blood conservation strategies for pediatric cardiac patients is limited. In children undergoing OHS, there are no published algorithms even though product exposure, particularly in neonates, is significant. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has determined 
pediatric transfusion medicine (PTM) to be a high priority for clinical and translational 
LDowney Page 2 of 9 Version 02.03 .2017  research , specifically targeting transfusion strategies that could reduce short and long 
term morbidity and mortality (3).   
 
Approximately 10,[ADDRESS_1049668] year of life. Excessive bleeding after CPB is an independent predictor of increased 
adverse events and massive transfusions in neonates (4).  Higher perioperative 
transfusions of allogenic blood products during pediatric cardiac surgery are associated with increased mor tality, increased pulmonary complications, prolonged mechanical 
ventilation, prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], increased risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_765586] (5,6). Many children with failed single- ventricle surgical palliation 
become high er-risk heart transplantation candidates because of the allo- sensitization after 
donor blood exposure. Finally, exposure to blood borne infections is a potential complication from receiving human derived blood products. Therefore, developi[INVESTIGATOR_765587] a potential to reduce short and long- term morbidity 
and mortality.  
 Neonates and infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at high risk for perioperat ive 
bleeding and massive transfusion due to immature coagulation systems, cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] (CPB) effects (deep hypothermia, extreme hemodilution, large non-endothelialized surfaces) and complexity of surgery.  The most common hemostatic derangement after CPB is an acute acquired hypofibrinogenemia, which compromises fibrin clot generation and platelet aggregation, resulting in increased bleeding and need for allogenic blood product transfusions. Recent studies suggest that qualitative and quantitative  fibrinogen deficiencies may contribute to impaired hemostasis in neonates 
and infants (7). Using confocal microscopy, Brown et al demonstrated neonatal clot formation before and after cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_765609].  However, the addition of adult fibrinogen was able to establish more 
effective clot formation in neonates (7).  In conjunction with the decreased function of neonatal fibrinogen, the acute acquired hypofibrinogenemia after OHS contributes to impaire d fibrin clot generation and platelet aggregation. Currently, fresh frozen plasma 
and cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_765588], thus increasing the allogenic transfusion exposures.   RiaSTAP  (fibrinogen concentrate (F C)), an FDA-approved medication for congenital 
hypofibrinogenemia, is being used off- label for treatment of acute acquired 
hypofibrinogene mia associated with massive bleeding and CPB in adult and pediatric 
patients (8 -10). Fibrinogen concentrate has many potential advantages for pediatric 
patients including 1) smaller volume to achieve target levels of fibrinogen, 2) decreased exposure to allogenic blood products, 3) decreased risk of infectious transmission, immunologic or allergic reactions, and 4) no required cross-matching or thawing process that makes it rapi[INVESTIGATOR_765589]. Recent studies found that FC was as effective as cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_765590]- heart s urgery (9,10).  However, these studies did not 
specifically examine the neonatal and infant population, who are most vulnerable to the 
affects of hypofibrinogenemia, excessive bleeding and large transfusions associated with 
LDowney Page 3 of 9 Version 02.03 .2017  OHS .  We propose that FC poses many advantages over current options, but there is a 
clear need for a randomized, prospective study in this population.  After communication 
with the Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research (CBER) and the Office of Blood 
Research and Review (OBRR) at th e FDA, an IND exemption was granted for this study. 
A grant from The Child Health Research Institute at Stanford University and SPARK has 
supported the initial work on this study and will help support the center at Children’s 
Healthcare of Atlanta.  
 
Significance:  
 
Specific Aim  #1: 
Demonstrate that fibrinogen concentrate can reduce allogenic donor exposures when 
compared with cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_765591].   The most common cause of post -by[CONTACT_765610]. Secondly, immature neonatal fibrinogen does not function as well as adult fibrinogen in forming stable clots .  This acquired hypofibrinogenemia is currently treated with cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047], 
a human derived blood product, which requires blood type matching and time to obtain from the blood bank. Th e FDA has approved fibrinogen concentrate, a lyophilized 
protein with minimal side effects,  for use in pediatric and adult patients wit h congenital 
hypofibrinogenemia. Fibrinogen concentrate is being used off- label for treatment of acute 
acquired hypofibrinogenemia  associated with massive bleeding and CPB in pediatric 
patients . No studies have been done specifically in cardiac surgery patients <[ADDRESS_1049669]- by[CONTACT_765611] <[ADDRESS_1049670] -CPB bleeding and decrease total donor 
exposures by 20%.   
 
Specific Aim #2:  
Comparison of fibrinogen concentrate to cryoprecipit ate as a safe and effective 
hemostatic agent:  
By [CONTACT_765612], transfusion requirements, and outcomes, we will 
examine the effectiveness of FC in reducing transfusion related risks, such as 1) length of mechanical ventilation time , 2) length of ICU stay, 3) length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] , 4) adverse 
events within seven days of surgery, 5) preoperative and post-operative coagulation laboratory values.

Study Description:  
 This study is a prospective, randomized trial designed to evaluate the role  of fibrinogen 
concentrate versus cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_765595].  Prior to surgery, w e will randomize infants 
undergoing cardiac surgery to receive cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047] (standard of care) or fibrinog en 
concentrate (study arm ) as part of a post-by[CONTACT_381155].  
For patients enroll ed in the study, we will follow our standard anesthetic management, 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_381156], and transfusion thresholds in the operating room and 
ICU.   
 In each patient, results from our standard of care labs will be obtained at seven  different 
time points:  
1) Preoperative labs (for outpatients, preoperative baseline labs are obtained in the 
preoperative clinic; for inpatients, baseline labs are obtained in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_765596]) (CBC, Coagulation tests, Fibrinogen, Chemistry)
,  
2) After induction of anesthesia but prior to surgical  incision (ABG, TEG) ,  
3) 10min after initiation of CPB (TEG, Fibrinogen, ABG),  
4) After termination of CPB, protamine reversal and first cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047]/FC  
administration  (ABG, TEG, fibrinogen),  
5) After chest closure or placement of silastic patch if chest remains open (ABG , 
TEG ),  
6) Coagulation labs on immediate arrival to the ICU  as per ICU protocol (ABG, 
Fibrinogen, Coagulation studies, CBC, Chemistry), and  
7) On the morning of the first post-operative day in the ICU as per ICU protocol (fibrinogen, ABG , coagulation studies, chemistry, CBC ).   
Blood samples drawn prior to surgery ( i.e time number 1) will be done either by [CONTACT_765613][INVESTIGATOR_765597]. For all other time 
points, blood samples will be drawn from an indwelling line placed for the surgery.  
 After separation from by[CONTACT_6476], patients will receive either cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_381128] , 
depending on their randomization group.  For patients randomized to the study arm, the fibrinogen level measured on by[CONTACT_765614] a level of 300mg/dL after separation from by[CONTACT_6476].  In these patients, FC will replace cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_765598]- by[CONTACT_6476] t ransfusion algorithm

laboratory values, intraoperative and post -operative transfusion requirements, chest tube 
output, adverse events, length of ventilation time, ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_765600] a HIPPA secure database.  
 Fibrinogen Concentrate ( RiaSTAP ) Dose : 
  
Hypofibrinogenemia is one of the main reasons for the perioperative coagulopathy in major pediatric surgeries. This hemostatic derangement is amplified in the pediatric 
population undergoing cardiac surgery due to the hemodilutional effects of the cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_765615].  Therefore, post-by[CONTACT_765616][INVESTIGATOR_765601].   
 Haas et al  (10) found that maintaining a higher fibrinogen concentration level  (FIBTEM 
<13mm vs <8mm) significantly decreased bleeding and transfusion requirements for patients undergoing craniosynostosis (median age 10months), but not scoliosis patients (mean age 12 years) . Brown et al (7) recently demonstrated that clots formed with 
neonatal fibrinogen are more porous and less dense than adult clots.  The addition of adult fibrinogen to neonatal fibrinogen in higher concentrations creates a more three-
dimensional structure than neonatal fibrinogen alone. Using  these studies and our 
historical data that neonates undergoing cardiac surgery had a median post- operative 
fibrinogen level of 345mg/dL (258-469) (unpublished data), we chose to target a post-
transfusion fibrinogen level of 300mg/dL. 
 Fibrinogen Concentrate ( RiaSTAP )    
 Fibrinogen concentrate can be dosed two ways.  For unknown fibrinogen levels, the RiaSTAP  dose is 70mg/kg.  However, the dose of FC can be calculated to reach a target 
fibrinogen level.   
 
Dose = (Target Level -Measured Level)/1.7 x weight (kg) 
 As we have chosen a target fibrinogen level of 300mg/dL, we will use the above equation to calculate the RiaSTAP  dose for each patient in the study arm.  In order to account for 
the hemodilutional effects of the by[CONTACT_765617], t he “measured level” 
will be the fibrinogen level measured after 10min on the CPB machine, time point #2.  
 
Specific Aim #1:  
 
LDowney Page 7 of 9 Version 02.03 .2017  Rational: The goal of Aim #[ADDRESS_1049672]- by[CONTACT_765618].  As 
massive transfusion in infants is associated with worse outcomes, we hope that reducing transfusions will reduce the short and long term risks associated with allogenic donor exposures.  
 
Specific Aim #2:  
By [CONTACT_765612], transfusion requirements, and short- term outcomes, 
we will examine the effectivenes s of FC in post- by[CONTACT_381168].  We will evaluate 
hematocrits , fibrinogen levels, and thrombelastogram values to determine if FC is at least 
as effective as the standard of care in post-by[CONTACT_765619].  Secondly, we 
will evaluate secondary outcomes to determine if FC can decrease transfusion related 
risks such as increased mechanical ventilation, prolonged ICU/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], infection 
risks, and thrombosis.  
 
Sample Size/Statistical Analysis  
 The primary aim of this study is to determine if fibrinogen concentrate can decrease allogenic donor transfusions in infants undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_765620], cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047].   
Therefore, w e analyzed our blood product transfusion data from CHOA in infants 
requiring CPB. We counted the number of units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh 
frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047], and platelets the patient received.  Each unit was counted as one donor exposure. On average,  the patients had nine donor exposures. We 
propose replacing two units of cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_765602] a 
20% reduction in donor exposures. In order to achieve a power of 0.9, we plan to enroll [ADDRESS_1049673] University will provide assistance with data management, conducting data analyses, and interpreting statistical results.  Continuous 
variables will be compared by [CONTACT_765621] + 
standard variation if normally distributed or by [CONTACT_133763] (IQ range) if non- normally 
distributed.  Nominal variables will be compared by [CONTACT_60679]- squared analysis or Fisher’s 
exact test. Significance will be defined as a p -value less than or equal to 0.05. 
 
Adverse Events Reporting  
 
Monitoring of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) is an important 
aspect of data collection. The study subjects will be reviewed on a case -by-case basis. 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_765603].   
LDowney Page [ADDRESS_1049674]. Serious adverse Events (life-threatening, requiring intervention) will be reported to the IRB within the guidelines set by [CONTACT_1201].  
 The risk of Fibrinogen concentrate administration is low, but adverse events include 
headache, fever, chills, allergic reaction, or thrombosis.   The risks are comparable to the 
administration of cryopreci pi[INVESTIGATOR_047].  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan 
 A potential risk of this study is related to drug reactions including fever, chills, headache, allergic reactions, or thrombosis.  This medication has been used extensively in Europe and as part of transfusion algorithms around the [LOCATION_002].  Based on this data and the need to minimized transfusions in the infant population undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, the FDA has granted an IND exemption for use of this medication in this 
randomized, control trial.  
 The study subjects will be reviewed on a case- by-case basis by [CONTACT_765622] a committee of experienced cardiac anesthesiologis ts not involved in the 
study f or review of each study subject for potential adverse events and whether or not the 
event was related to the study.  
 A second risk of this study is patient confidentiality since protected health information is included in the study data. This risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_765623]’s objectives. Information directly identifying 
patients will be excluded  (names, addresses, telephone numbers, social security numbers, 
email a ddresses, and account numbers). A unique study number will identify the study 
subjects. The study information will be collected and stored in a password- protected 
database. Consents, along with the code linking a subject’s identity to an assigned 
number, will be locked in the office of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1461].

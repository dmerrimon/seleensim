Section C:  Background Information
     ***Please note that this is a reliance protocol***
Diabetes-related foot ulcers (DFUs) are a leading cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_842215], and account for 33%
of all direct costs of diabetes care in the US. Ulcers requiring acute care can result in treatment costs of up to US$70,[ADDRESS_1170380] and avoid hospi[INVESTIGATOR_842216],
wound should be immediately closed. But this is often challenging in diabetic foot with deep ulcers.W ound healing is a
dynamic process involving interactions between cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) and growth factors that reconstitutes
tissue following injury . ECM plays an important role in tissue regeneration and is the major component of the dermal skin
layer . Recognition of the importance of the ECM in wound healing has led to the development of wound products that aim
to stimulate or replace the ECM in particular in case of deep tissue destruction because of deep DFUs. It is known from
the literature that chronic or hard-to-heal wounds are characterized by a disrupted or damaged ECM that cannot support
wound healing. Thus treatment strategies based on use of biologic scaf fold materials for management of chronic and deep
wounds has increased dramatically during the past two decades. These scaf folds include those comprising an intact
extracellular matrix (ECM) or individual components of the ECM, and those comprising hybrids incorporating a synthetic
component with a biologic component. DermACELL (LifeNet Health,V irginia Beach, V A) is acellular dermal matrices
(ADM), which has been shown to be ef fective in treating chronic DFUs in a clinical trial. 
Another ADM product available in the market is made by [CONTACT_205846]® (Bilayer Matrix W ound Dressing, Integra LifeSciences).
However , advantages/disadvantages of one compared to the other are unclear . Figure 2 (Please see protocol in section
S)illustrates the case showed in the figure 1 treated by [CONTACT_842220] (One of the wound was treated by
[CONTACT_842221]). As it can be seen the thickness of Integra is higher than DermalCELL,
1/7/2020 Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=397862 3/13which may make it relatively more dif ficult to apply with potential further complications including likelihood of infection, poor
tissue mechanics outcomes (e.g. presence of scarring or tissue biomechanics properties leading to increase in shear or
pressure post healing thus increasing likelihood of recurrence of the ulcer), and patient centered outcomes like smell, pain,
and comfort.
 
Section D:  Purpose and Objectives
     ***Please note that this is a reliance protocol***
The primary objective of this prospective, randomized trial is to compare the outcomes of DermaCELL with Integra. W e
assumed that the wounds outcomes (e.g. weekly wound size change, time to heal, time to successful wound granulation)
are comparable between DermaCELL and Integra. However , from operation and patient centered outcomes, there may be
some noticeable dif ferences. For instance, DermaCELL, thanks to its mesh structure, thin thickness, and no need for
hydration, may be easier to apply with shorter time than Integra. The factors are of key importance in operation room (OR)
setting and could reduce overall cost of application and needs in using OR resources. Other important outcomes least
addressed in prior studies are number of grafts failing, adverse events (e.g. amputation, infection, etc), cost of wound
healing treatment, tissue biomechanics, which may lead to recurrence of ulcers (e.g. formation of tissue scarring), and
other patient-centered outcomes (e.g. pain, quality of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], wound smelling, etc). For instance, many patients are
unhappy with smelling of wounds, which make them embarrassed among their family members like grand kids. Thus
reducing wound smelling during activities of daily living is often considered as an important patient centered outcomes.

F2.  Procedure
     ** Reliance protocol ** There are a total of 17 study visits. 
Medical History: The presence of diabetes will be determined based on American Diabetes Association criteria. This will
include: duration and type of diabetes, type of diabetes medication (insulin, oral, combination therapy , diet), previous
history of foot ulcers, amputation (toe, foot), lower extremity by[CONTACT_6476], lower extremity angioplasty , Coronary artery by[CONTACT_254981] , cardiac angioplasty , arthritis, liver disease, osteoporosis, malignancy , and bone tumors. W e will use the Kaplan
co-morbidity index to record disease severity . 
Social and Economic Factors: W e will evaluate the following factors: marital status, years of education, type of work,
tobacco history (pack years, current smoker , current use of chewing tobacco, previous smoker , no tobacco history), drug
history (current, previous history , no drug history), and alcohol history . Also we will collect cost information for the subject's
treatment up to [ADDRESS_1170384] enrolls in the study . 
Questionnaires: Quality of Life, Frailty Status, Sleep Quality , Cognitive Status and Device Acceptability: T o evaluate
functional status we will use well-accepted questionnaires, SF-12 for Quality of Life, Sleep Quality questionnaire (PSQI),
MOCA and TSFI for frailty status. In addition, at each visit, we will interview the subject about their concern with their
wound and product (e.g. wound drainage, smell, pain, etc.), use of any medications for pain or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the cost of
transport to the clinic, any adverse events (e.g. infection, need to visit a specialist, etc), etc. T o see the timeline for each
questionnaire, please refer the table included in the ICF attached. 
Pain Intensity Assessment (V AS): Researchers will provide a numerical pain scale where subject will report their pain
intensity . Researchers will document pain level. 
Adverse Event Reporting: Researchers will document and report any study/non study related incident as per institution
regulations. 
Device Acceptability Questionnaire: The subject will be handed a questionnaire to evaluate the study device and provide
feedback to the research team. W e will be asking about level of satisfaction with the product. These may be questions
about the time spent to apply the product, the level of comfort, appearance of the product, the appearance of the healed
wound (e.g. presence of scarring), ease of walking or standing with the product and after healing, etc. 
Matrix Application: During the subject's wound treatment (either in OR or outpatient clinic), the physician will apply the
dermal matrix from the group they were placed. The researchers will write down the duration needed for full application of
the product. For accurate estimation of time needed for preparation and application, the whole process may be video-
recorded for of fline estimate of each time.
1/7/2020 Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=397862 5/13Vascular Assessment: W e will assess perfusion of the macro-circulation with arterial Doppler studies and micro-circulation
with Skin Perfusion Pressure measurements. Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) will be measured on both extremities. W e will also
use the SensiLase system (Väsamed) to measure Skin Perfusion Pressure (SPP) in mmHg. Additionally , we may use the
LUNA or SPY Device for Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging.For this purpose a fluorescent agent may be injected
into the subject's body to allow us observe the blood circulation to the wound. Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging
(SPY or Luna) may be performed based on the medical judgment of the physician. Highly qualified medical/clinical staf f
will perform this measurement. If so, measurement will take place only during baseline and treatment day .
Wound Photo: At every visit, the Medical/Researcher using a standard digital camera will take a digital photo of the wound.
We will ask the subject's permission to take photos/video. 
Wound Assessment: Evaluations will be based on data collected from wound assessments and photographs. W e use
acetate tracings and digital photos. Additionally , we will use thermal imaging to track inflammation. 
Thermal Image: A thermal camera will be used to obtain an image of the wound and observe swelling.
Wifi W ound Classification: Podiatrist or vascular surgeon will evaluate the health and wellness of the subject's feet in
compliance of standard of care
Granulation Assessment: The physician will be looking at how the wound heals. Specifically , they will look at the reddish
tissue developi[INVESTIGATOR_842217]. A digital photograph will be taken and comments made by [CONTACT_842225]. 
Wound Care: The physician will schedule regular visits after the surgery to provide care to the wound as according to
standard of care
Dressing Change: Medical and/or clinical staf f will change the subject's dressing weekly or as needed.
Peripheral Neuropathy: W e will use V ibration Perception Threshold (VPT) T esting to quantify neuropathy severity . VPT will
be evaluated at the distal great toe and 5th metatarsal head using a Biothesiometer . 
Upper Extremity Assessment: Investigators will measure the subject's arm motion using wearable sensors (LegSys). One
sensor will be placed around the wrist and elbow . While being at a comfortable position, they will be asked to flex and
extend their arm for [ADDRESS_1170385] speed. W e will ask to repeat this task but counting backwards (dual task). 
Optional Assessments ¿ These may occur at any visit. However , they do not need to be performed.
Physical Exam: The researchers will place 5 sensors named Legsys and Balanses (one on lower back, 2 on each upper
thigh, and 2 on each shin) attached with elastic straps to test balance and record your walking patterns. Researchers will
ensure that the straps are not too tight to avoid poor circulation
Physical activity: The researchers will provide you with a small sensor (Pamsys) that will be measuring physical activity for
[ADDRESS_1170386] the device and send it back to the investigating team after 48 hrs
Heart Rate Monitoring: A comfortable chest worn sensor (Zephyr BioHarness, Medtronic or BioStamp RC, MC10) will be
used to measure physiological signs such as heart rate, skin temperature, and physical activity . This device will be

Section G:  Sample Size/Data Analysis
G1.  Sample Size
How many subjects (or specimens, or charts) will be used in this study?
     Local: 50              W orldwide: 50
Please indicate why you chose the sample size proposed:
     There is no prior studies to report the major primary outcomes for comparison between DermaCELL and Integra. Based on
interviewing our podiatrist who worked with both Integra and DermaCELL, we estimated the time needed to apply each
matrices in the OR. W e hypothesized that time needed to apply DermallCELL is approximately 3±2 min while the time
needed to apply Integra is estimated to be 5±2min (Cohen¿s ef fect size d=1). Assuming an alpha of 5% and power of 80%
and two tailed t-test comparison, [ADDRESS_1170405] may be addressed to clinically validate the
1/7/2020 Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=397862 7/13observed noticeable trends. Alternatively , the sample size may be increased upon available of budget, approval of
sponsor , and noticeable observed trend based on the first 20 recruited subjects (ten per group).
G2.  Data Analysis
Provide a description of your plan for data analysis. State the types of comparisons you plan (e.g. comparison of means,
comparison of proportions, regressions, analysis of variance). Which is the PRIMAR Y comparison/analysis? How will the
analyses proposed relate to the primary purposes of your study?
     The primary outcomes are time to granulation, successful granulation at 8 weeks, and number of failures (e.g. amputation,
infection, rejection, re-application) within 8 weeks. Mixed models accommodate the longitudinal design; allow for testing
differences between groups in patterns over time as well as at specific time points; are consistent with an intention to treat
analysis (9), and are valid for data which are missing completely at random or at random (10). Number of failures as well
as number of recurrence of ulcers over the 6 month follow-up will be modelled with a generalized linear model using an
appropriate count outcome (Poisson, zero-inflated Poisson, negative binomial for overdispersion). Rate ratios comparing
intervention arms will be estimated from this model. Appropriate mixed models (linear or generalized linear , for non-
continuous outcomes or logistic regression for binary data) will be used to test the intervention ef fect for each of the
secondary outcomes (e.g. tissue biomechanics, mobility , patient centered outcomes, recurrence of ulcers, etc). A Kaplan-
Meier survivorship analysis will be used for estimating time to event for none successful healing probability over time by
[CONTACT_842226] p-value will be calculated using the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Hazard ratios will be used to indicate the
probability of closure at any given point in time for Derma-Cell v . Integra treatment. Univariate logistic regression analyses
will be performed to delineate predictive factors of successful granulation at 8 weeks, successful wound healing at 12
weeks, and successful wound healing at 16 weeks. Results will be controlled for potential confounding variables including
age, sex, BMI, HbA1c, neuropathy severity , vascular status, frailty , mobility status, and initial wound size. The p-values for
weekly % wound area and % wound area reduction through 16 weeks will be calculated using t tests. All p-values, for both
the categorical and continuous data, will be calculated using a two-sided alpha of 0.05.
 
Section H:  Potential Risks/Discomforts
H1.  Potential Risks/Discomforts
Describe and assess any potential risks/discomforts; (physical, psychological, social, legal, or other) and assess the likelihood
and seriousness of such risks:
     The study devices and assessment tools that will be used in the study are non-invasive, safe, non-toxic and do not emit
any radiation. However , like any battery-powered system, there is also a minimum risk of device malfunctioning and
overheating. W e will inform the subject to contact [CONTACT_14721] f immediately if they experience overheating or device
malfunctioning. In addition, the study devices are not waterproof, and although they use a low powered battery (similar to a
cell-phone battery), they should not be submerged in water . We will inform the subjects to remove the device when ever
they go swimming or take a shower .
Subjects will not be charged for any damage or loss of the device. W e will inform them to contact [CONTACT_106986] . The
device may be replaced upon availability .
There is a minimal risk of interference from Zephyr Bioharness in the functionality of pacemaker/ICD devices. Therefore, to
avoid any adverse events, it is recommend by [CONTACT_842227] a pacemaker/IDC. There are no hazards or adverse events reported regarding Zephyr Bioharness.
A vibration perception device will be used to monitor progress and diagnose severity of DPN in lower extremities. The
vibration range will be from 0-50 V olts. Participants may feel slight discomfort from the vibration. This device is compliant
with medical electrical device safety according to IEC 601-1.
H2.  Data and safety monitoring plan
     Do the study activities impart greater than minimal risk to subjects?
          No
H3.  Coordination of information among sites for multi-site research
Is the BCM Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_53770]-INVESTIGA TOR for this multi-site research?
          No or Not Applicable
Is BCM the COORDINA TING CENTER for this multi-site research?
          No or Not Applicable
 
Section I:  Potential Benefits
Describe potential benefit(s) to be gained by [CONTACT_30435] a result of participating in the planned work.
     There may be no direct benefit to the subject by [CONTACT_55825] . What the researchers find out from this study may help
other people with deep and/or chronic wounds. This research compares two dermal matrices after being applied to a deep

https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=397862 8/13wound.
Describe potential benefit(s) to society of the planned work.
     It is part of a larger prevention initiative to reduce the high number of diabetic amputations
The body of work in this area suggests opportunities for better patient care by [CONTACT_842228].
Do anticipated benefits outweigh potential risks? Discuss the risk-to-benefit ratio.
     Although there some risks involved in this study associated with the procedures involved, they are minimal and the study
does provide the possibility of benefit to subjects. Therefore, the benefits outweigh the risks involved.
 
Section J:  Consent Procedures
J1.  Waiver of Consent
Will any portion of this research require a waiver of consent and authorization?
     Yes
Please describe the portion of the research for which a waiver is required. (Example: chart review to determine subject
eligibility)
     We will be screening our patient charts for screening and to determine eligibility .
Explain why the research and the use or disclosure of protected health information involves no more than minimal risk
(including privacy risks) to the individuals.
     The PHI will not be reused or disclosed to (shared with) any other person or entity , except as required by [CONTACT_2371] , for
authorized oversight of the research study , or for other research for which the use or disclosure of the PHI would be
permitted under the Privacy Rule.
This is a minimal risk study . There is the possibility for loss of confidentiality . However , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_842218].
Also, electronic data will only be kept on our network password protected computers.
Explain why the waiver will not adversely af fect the privacy rights and the welfare of the research subjects.
     Patients will receive the same standard of care whether or not they participate in the research. Subjects are patients of the
Co-PI [INVESTIGATOR_805046]. So, their participation will not af fect the current or future care in the clinic by [CONTACT_9682].
Explain why the research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver and could not practicably be conducted
without access to and use of the protected health information.
     If we are not allowed to search our patient¿s records, we cannot identify and recruit the patients that are eligible for the
study . We have to be able to access the patient chart including their medical information from other physicians in order to
verify their eligibility for this study . 
This research will not af fect the subject¿s care as they are receiving the standard of care.
Describe how an adequate plan exists in order to protect identifiers from improper use and disclosure.
     As there is a possibility of a loss of confidentiality in this study , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_842219]. In addition all physical information will be kept in locked file cabinets. All electronic

injections, the injections  should be administered  in close physical 
proximity to each other (within approximately 1 inch).  
Injections  will be administered  by [CONTACT_619776]’ safety evaluation.  Recording 
and evaluation of safety information and laboratory data will be performed by [CONTACT_619777]’ treatment assignment.  
Part  1: 
There will be 2 administration methods  of rF1V vaccine with 
CpG 1018:  
• Group 1 (N = approximately 20): rF1V vaccine and CpG 
1018 will be co-administered  as 2 separate injections  on Days 
1 and 29;  
Day 183. 
• Group 2 (N = approximately 20):  bedside mix of rF1V 
vaccine + CpG 1018 (bedside mix is administered as 1 injection)  and placebo  will be administered  as 2 separate 
injections on Days 1 and 29; a  f 
placebo will be administered on Day 183  
In addition, rFIV  vaccine will be administered  alone  without  CpG 
1018:  
• Group 3 (N = approximately 20): rF1V vaccine and placebo  
will be  administered  as 2 separate injections on  Days 1 , 
 
All Groups  will receive 2 injections  at each treatment  visit to 
maintain the blind.  
A Data Monitoring Committee  (DMC) will review safety  for Part 
[ADDRESS_824045] dose:  
• [ADDRESS_824046] 6 subjects  
• [ADDRESS_824047] 18 subjects  
In addition,  the DMC  may review safety  data as needed  at any 
time during the study (as defined in the DMC charter).  
The administration method of vaccine utilized in Part 2 of the study will be selected by [CONTACT_619778] (DoD) after Day [ADDRESS_824048] 2  times  higher  than that 1 month 
after 2 doses of rF1V vaccine in Group 3. Prior to enrolling subjects in Part 2, the Pharmacy Manual will be updated to document  the method of administration of rF1V vaccine and CpG 
1018 selected for Part 2.  
Part  2: 
Part 2 will begin after immunogenicity  assessments from the Day 
57 visit in Part 1 are completed. The rF1V vaccine with CpG

Eligibility  Criteria:  Inclusion Criteria  
A subject must meet the following criteria to be eligible for 
enrollment  (defined  as receiving  study  treatment)  in the study:  
1) Adults  aged 18  to 55 years  
2) Healthy  participants  or participants  with pre-existing  medical 
conditions who are in a stable medical condition.  
Pre-existing stable medical condition means a subject who: has full capacity of daily activity and no major medication 
modification within 3 months prior to Day 1; has not undergone  surgical  or minimally -invasive intervention  or had 
any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/emergency room visit for the specific 
medical condition.  
3) Able to comply  with the protocol  schedule and procedures  
4) Able and willing  to provide  written  informed consent  
5) If female of child -bearing  potential and heterosexually  active, 
has practiced adequate contraception for [ADDRESS_824049] prior to 
vaccination and has agreed to continue adequate 
contraception until 28 days after vaccination. Adequate 
contraception is defined as a contraceptive method with a 
failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and 
correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the 
product label. Examples include the following:  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) 
hormonal  contraception  associated  with inhibition  of 
ovulation: oral, intravaginal, or transdermal

 2 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 
2.1 Plague  (Yersinia  pestis)  
Plague is a zoonotic infection with Yersinia pestis that is normally transmitted from rodents to 
humans  when humans  are bitten by [CONTACT_619785].  There are 3  manifestations  of the disease, with 
flea bites usually causing the bubonic form in which a painful swelling (bubo) of the draining lymph nodes occurs ( Vadyvaloo, Jarrett et al. 2007, Hinnebusch and Erickson 2008). Left 
untreated, the infection will cause sepsis and death in approximately half of the cases. Bubo formation is  not present in the second form of disease, which leads directly to sepsis, and occurs 
in about a third of the cases. Bubonic and septicemic infections occasionally progress to secondary pneumonic infections. Infection with Y. pestis also rarely occurs through inhalation of 
the organism, and, after 1 to 6 days, the  disease manifests in its pneumonic form, which is  nearly 
always fatal unless  the patient  is treated  with antibiotics  within  20 hours  of symptom  onset  (Daya 
and Nakamura 2005) . Clinical signs include fever with cough and dyspnea, and there may be 
production of bloody, watery sputum. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea may also be present. The pneumonic form spreads from person to person by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_619738] ( McGovern 1997, Perry and Fetherston 1997, Inglesby, Dennis et al. 2000, 
Koirala 2006, Prentice and Rahalison 2007).  
Historically, plague  (Y. pestis ) has  resulted  in three  pandemics  over the  last 1,[ADDRESS_824059] caused 200 million deaths worldwide. Y. pestis is currently classified as 
a Category A priority  pathogen by [CONTACT_619786] 
(NIAID) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Hart, Saviolakis et al.  
2012).  
2.2 rF1V  Vaccine  Background  
The proposed indication for Y. pestis Plague Recombinant Antigen (rF1V; F1 capsular protein 
fused to V antigen; Escherichia coli ) (rF1V Plague Vaccine) is to provide pre -exposure 
prophylaxis  to military  personnel  [ADDRESS_824060]  pneumonic  plague  resulting  from 
aerosol exposure to Y. pestis . 
The rF1V plague vaccine candidate was initially developed at the US Army Medical Research 
Institute  for Infectious  Diseases ([LOCATION_003]MRIID)  (Hart,  Saviolakis  et al. 2012) . It was  transferred  to 
the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (JVAP) (subsequently to the DynPort Vaccine Company 
[DVC], and most recently to the Office of the Surgeon General) in an early stage of 
development. In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug Designation to recombinant rF1V plague vaccine as a biodefense countermeasure on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The vaccine is intended to be administered to  
individuals considered to be at high risk for exposure to aerosolized Y. pestis . The target 
indication of this vaccine is protection of adults 18 to 55 years of age from disease caused by [CONTACT_619787] Y. pestis .

 Bridge  ELISA  
Bridge  ELISA  Bridge  ELISA  The rF1V vaccine candidate for plague comprises the F1 capsular protein and the V virulence 
protein  of Y. pestis Colorado 92 (CO92)  fused  into a single protein, which is produced in E. coli 
and formulated with aluminum hydroxide, Alhydrogel® 2%, (alum).  
2.3 Clinical Experience with  rF1V  Vaccine  
The rF1V  vaccine was evaluated  in one Phase 1 (rF1V -01), Phase 2a (rF1V -02a), and 1 phase 2b 
(rF1V -02b) clinical trial. In these clinical trials, assessments of vaccine safety and 
immunogenicity were the major objectives. The immune response to the vaccine was evaluated 
by [CONTACT_619788]1, rV, and rF1V by [CONTACT_619789]. Blood was 
also collected for passive transfer studies for evaluation of efficacy in animals. The safety population included all volunteers who received at least 1 dose of the rF1V vaccine and for 
whom any safety information was recorded. Reactogenicity, tolerability and safety were 
monitored in all vaccinated volunteers at multiple time points after vaccination using physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, and pre -specified or solicited adverse events (AEs) 
collected via volunteer diaries to enhance reporting of AEs by [CONTACT_32366].  
2.3.1 Effectiveness Data with  rF1V  Vaccine  – Bridge  Strategy  
The efficacy of the rF1V vaccine as a prophylactic for pneumonic plague, resulting from 
inhalational exposure, cannot be determined directly in humans and, therefore, was evaluated by [CONTACT_619790] (DVC) for the DoD in accordance with the Animal Rule. Use of the Animal Rule requires that the pathophysiology of disease and the mechanism by [CONTACT_619791]. The animal models that  DVC selected 
to evaluate vaccine efficacy were the Swiss Webster mouse and the cynomolgus macaque (CM). 
Aerosol model development studies have been performed in both animal species and have demonstrated sufficient similarity  to the pathology of disease in humans to serve as useful animal 
models for pneumonic plague. DVC evaluated the rF1V vaccine in these animal models for the 
purpose of licensure using the Animal Rule. The agreed bridging strategy for rF1V vaccine was based on modeling the animal survival status (endpoint of interest) as a function of anti- rF1V 
antibody concentration measured by [CONTACT_619792]1V (the correlate of protection).

2.4 CpG  1018 Background  
2.4.1 CpG  1018 Mechanism  of Action  
CpG 1018 is a synthetic oligonucleotide containing immunostimulatory cytidine -phospho-  
guanosine (CpG) sequence motifs that mimic bacterial and viral DNA. CpG 1018 exerts its 
actions solely through a single, well -defined pattern recognition receptor in the innate immune 
system, Toll -like receptor 9 (TLR9), a mechanism that is distinct from other commercial 
adjuvants, including oil -in-water adjuvants. CpG [ADDRESS_824072] the induction of helper T cells (Th) that are essential for the generation of antibodies and T and B cell memory  to vaccine antigens. CpG -[ADDRESS_824073] demonstrable off -target activities.  
2.4.2 Review  of Available  Clinical Data  Supporting  Rationale  for CpG  1018 with  rF1V 
Antigen  
There are no clinical data available adding CpG 1018 to rF1V antigen. There are substantial safety  and immunogenicity data available  where  CpG 1018  has been  added to hepatitis  B surface 
antigen (HBsAg) in preventive vaccines and a growing database of CpG 1018 combined with SARS -CoV- 2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_619739]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Summary  of Clinical Experience in  CpG  1018

CpG 1018 3000 mcg with HBsAg has been evaluated in the clinical development program for HEPLISAV -B
®, approved by [CONTACT_3557] 9 November 2017 ( Dynavax Technologies 
Corporation 2020) and by [CONTACT_3558] (EMA) on 18 February 2021 (Dynavax Technologies  Corporation 2021).  Data  are available  for 10,038 adult  subjects  between 
the ages of 18 and 70 years who received HEPLISAV -B in 3 phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518] (HBV -10, 
HBV- 16, and HBV -23) and [ADDRESS_824074] frequently observed TEAEs 
were local reactions. The incidence of local and systemic reactions and other TEAEs did not 
increase with re -exposure to the vaccine during the study. No late -onset safety issues were 
apparent during 12 months of follow -up.

In the HEPLISAV -B clinical  development  program  of over 14,000 subjects,  comparative  studies 
of 2 doses  of HEPLISAV -B (20 mcg HBsAg  + 3,000 mcg CpG 1018)  over 1 month  (Days  1 and 
29) with 3 doses of the alum adjuvanted Engerix- B® (20 mcg HBsAg + 500 mcg alum) over 6 
months (Days 1, 29, and 183) showed statistically significantly higher immunogenicity in 
HEPLISAV -B recipi[INVESTIGATOR_619740] -B recipi[INVESTIGATOR_89278] a similar safety and tolerability profile. 
Seroprotection rates (SPR; % with antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti- HBs] 2' l0 
mIU/mL) of more than 90% were produced in all populations studied and were statistically 
significantly higher than those induced by [CONTACT_619794]- B (Figure 2 -2). 
Figure 2 -2: Example  of Typi[INVESTIGATOR_619741]

(Halperin,  Ward  et al. 2012)  
PP = Per-protocol;  SPR = seroprotection  rate. 
Note:  The median  time to seroprotection  of the 2-dose HEPLISAV -B schedule  occurred  5 months  earlier  than the 
3-dose Engerix- B schedule, denoted by [CONTACT_450823]. Similar time courses of seroprotection were observed in 
HBV -16 (Heyward, Kyle et al. 2013 ) and HBV -23 (Jackson, Lentino et al. 2018 ). 
 
In the Dynavax study HBV -10 of adults 18 to 55 years of age, the SPR at four weeks after the 
second dose of HEPLISAV -B, at week 8, was statistically significantly higher than the SPR in 
the Engerix- B group at week 8 (88.4% vs 26.7%, p < 0.0001). It was also significantly higher 
than the peak  SPR following  three  doses of Engerix- B at week  28 (81.3%, p < 0.001). At  week  8, 
the geometric mean concentration (GMC) of anti -HBs antibodies was 83.1 mIU/mL in the 
HEPLISAV -B group and 6.5 mIU/mL in the Engerix- B group (p < 0.0001). The peak GMC in 
the HEPLISAV -B group (341.6 mIU/mL) was similar to the peak GMC in the Engerix- B group 
(352.1 mIU/mL).

Safety data are available for 9365 adult participants who received CpG 1018 in the three phase 3

the US since 2017 with benign spontaneous safety reports both to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) and Dynavax. 
HEPLISAV -B induces a similar frequency of local post -injection reactions (PI[INVESTIGATOR_619742]) and a lower 
frequency of systemic PI[INVESTIGATOR_619742] (including fever) compared to Engerix-B. Overall, 55.1% of subjects in 
the HEPLISAV -B arm experienced any PIR compared to 57.1% of subjects in the Engerix-B arm. 
Systemic PI[INVESTIGATOR_619743] 32.3% of the HEPLISAV -B group and 37.4% of the Engerix-B group, 
and local PI[INVESTIGATOR_619743] 42.8% of the HEPLISAV -B group and 41.1% of the Engerix-B group. 
Adverse events, serious adverse events, immune -mediated adverse events of special interest, and 
deaths were balanced between the HEPLISAV -B and Engerix- B groups. Changes in autoantibodies 
including ANA,  anti-dsDNA,  and ANCA  were similar  between  vaccine groups  (Hyer, McGuire  et al. 
2018).  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 CpG  1018 as a Biological  Response Modifier  in Ongoing  Clinical and Preclinical 
Programs  
Dynavax is evaluating CpG 1018 in multiple clinical development programs. In all of these 
studies, CpG 1018 was combined with aluminum hydroxide (ie, alum, Alhydrogel® 2%) as the adjuvant. Preclinical studies in multiple animal models, and now humans, have shown substantially greater adjuvant activity of a combination of CpG [ADDRESS_824077] demonstrated the 
immunogenicity  of two different SARS -CoV- 2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_619744] 1018 
and alum ( Arunachalam, Walls et al. 2021) (and unpublished data from NIH Vaccine Research 
Center). In the NIH study, monkeys were immunized twice with recombinant spi[INVESTIGATOR_619745] -CoV -2 and were fully protected when challenged 8 months later 
with the SARS -CoV- 2 beta variant, demonstrating the durability and breadth of the protective 
antibody response. Importantly, results from human studies with multiple COVID -19 vaccine 
antigens utilizing CpG -1018 and alum confirm the ability of this adjuvant formulation to 
stimulate high levels of IgG, neutralizing antibodies, and T cell responses with a 2- dose regimen 
with no safety concerns ( Hsieh, Liu et al. 2021, Richmond, Hatchuel et al. 2021) (Valneva and 
BiologicalE unpublished data).

 Importantly, in two of the above studies, same day mixing of CpG -1018 with antigen and alum 
(Alhydrogel  2%) was  employed, and the resulting  mixture  given  as a single  injection  (Richmond, 
Hatchuel et al. 2021) (Valneva unpublished data). 
The two most advanced subunit COVID -19 vaccines provide substantial evidence of the 
effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of the combined CpG 1018 + alum (Alhydrogel  2%) 
adjuvant. The immunogenicity of MCV -COV1901, a COVID- 19 vaccine using the NIH SARS - 
CoV- 2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_619746] 750 mcg of CpG 1018 and alum  was evaluated  in a phase  1, open- label 
dose-finding study. After the second vaccination with MCV -COV1901, the spi[INVESTIGATOR_619747] 7178 (low antigen dose), 7746 (middle  
antigen dose), and [ZIP_CODE] (high antigen dose) ( Hsieh, Liu et al. 2021). In addition, serum 
neutralizing activity geometric mean values were 1.8 to 3.9 times higher than those of a panel of 
control human convalescent sera. A phase 2 study of over 3800 participants > 19 years of age, randomized 6:1, has recently reported a geometric mean neutralization titer of 662, a GMT ratio of 163, and a seroconversion rate of 99.8% ( Hsieh, Liu et al. 2021).  These results meet the 
criteria established by [CONTACT_619795]. The vaccine was well 
tolerated  with no severe adverse reactions. Injection  site pain (71.2%),  most  of mild severity, was 
the most frequent post -injection reaction. The most frequent systemic post -injection reactions 
were fatigue (MCV -COV1901: 36%; placebo: 29.7%), myalgia (MCV -COV1901: 27.6%; 
placebo: 16.6%), and headache (MCV -COV1901: 22.2%; placebo: 20%). Fever was uncommon 
(MCV- COV1901: 0.7%; placebo: 0.4%)  (Hsieh, Liu et al. 2021)  
The safety and immunogenicity of  the second COVID -19 vaccine, SCB -2019, were evaluated in 
a phase 1, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled dose -finding study in healthy adults 
(Richmond, Hatchuel et  al. 2021). SCB -2019 is a protein subunit vaccine candidate containing a 
stabilized trimeric form of the SARS -CoV- 2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_144870] (S -Trimer) combined with [ADDRESS_824078] dose, but titers were greatly increased after the second dose, with GMTs of 478 –2440 on Day 36. High 
GMTs were maintained to Day 50, when seroconversion rates were 87.5 –93.8%. CpG 1018 + 
alum  titers  were  2.1-fold higher than those  recorded  in a panel  of convalescent  sera from patients 
with COVID- 19. SCB- 2019 elicited Th- 1-biased CD4+ T -cell responses.  
In a follow up analysis ( Richmond, Hatchuel et al. 2021), immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies 
were measured against SCB -2019, angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) competitive 
binding antibodies, and neutralizing  antibodies  against  wild-type SARS -CoV- 2 (Wuhan -Hu-1) at 
Days [ADDRESS_824079] 3 VoCs, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Gamma (P.1), in Day 36 sera. Titers waned from their peak at Days 36–50, but SCB -[ADDRESS_824080] wild-  
type SARS -CoV- 2 persisted at 25% –35% of their observed peak levels at Day 184. Day [ADDRESS_824081] the 3 VoCs.

 The vaccine was well tolerated  with no severe adverse reactions. Injection  site pain (62.5), most 
of mild severity,  was the most  frequent  post-injection  reaction.  The only systemic post-injection 
reactions were headache (SCB- 2019: 25.0%; placebo: 14.3) and fatigue (SCB -2019: 12.5%; 
placebo: 0).  
Based on a model by [CONTACT_619796] (Khoury, Cromer et  al. 2021),  both vaccines, with a 
ratio of neutralizing antibodies  to antibodies  in human convalescent  sera greater than  2, are likely 
to have an efficacy against COVID -19 greater than 85% to 90%. 
2.[ADDRESS_824082] an adaptive clinical trial to determine if CpG 1018, the adjuvant used in 
HEPLISAV -B, can be utilized as a Biological Response Modifier (BRM) to improve the 
operational utility of the current investigational rF1V vaccine for the Military without re - 
formulation of the  adjuvant. Dynavax will evaluate  both coadministration  (rF1V and CpG 1018 
administered in two concurrent injections in the same location), and a bedside mix (rF1V and 
CpG 1018 combined in a single syringe prior to vaccination) compared to rF1V alone to determine  the method of administration  that provides  an acceptable immune  response  conducive 
to field deployment. A two- dose schedule at Day [ADDRESS_824083] will support the development of 
next generation rF1V  vaccine(s) with  an enhanced operational  utility  for the military  and for the 
prevention and/or curtailment of a pneumonic plague outbreak.

4.1 Study  Design  
This is a phase 2, randomized, active-controlled, observer- blinded, multicenter trial of the 
immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of rF1V vaccine with CpG 1018 compared with rF1V 
vaccine alone  in adults. Approximately two hundred healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age  will be 
enrolled to compare a two -dose regimen of rF1V with CpG 1018 administered on study Days 1 
with a three -dose regimen  of rF1V  vaccine alone administered  
on study Days  
The study will be conducted in 2 parts (Part 1 and Part 2). The table below outlines study drug administration in both parts. When investigational product is co -administered as 2 separate 
injections, the  injections  should be administered  in close  physical proximity  to each other (within 
approximately 1 inch).  
Injections  will be administered  by [CONTACT_619800]’  safety 
evaluation. Recording and evaluation of safety information and laboratory data will be 
performed by [CONTACT_619777]’ treatment assignment.  
Part  1: 
There  will be 2 methods of rF1V vaccine with CpG  1018 administration:  
• Group 1 (N = approximately 20): rF1V  vaccine and CpG 1018 will be co-administered  as 2 
separate injections on Days ;  
 
• Group 2 (N = approximately 20): bedside mix of rF1V  vaccine + CpG 1018 (administered  as 
1 injection) and placebo will be administered as 2  separate injections on Days 1 and 29;  
 
In addition, rFIV  vaccine will be administered  alone without CpG 1018:  
• Group 3 (N=20): rF1V  and placebo  will be administered  as 2 separate injections  on Days  
 
All Groups will receive 2 injections  at each treatment  visit to maintain  the blind.  
A Data  Monitoring Committee  (DMC)  will review  safety for  Part [ADDRESS_824091] dose:  
• [ADDRESS_824092] 6 subjects  
• [ADDRESS_824093] 18  subjects  Day 183. 
29, and  183. 1, 2 separate  injections  of placebo  will be administered  on Day 183

 In addition, the  DMC may review  safety  data as needed  at any time during the study (as defined 
in the DMC charter).  
The administration  method of vaccine utilized in  Part [ADDRESS_824094] 2 times  higher than the 4 weeks after 2 doses of rF1V  vaccine in 
Group 3. Prior to enrolling  subjects in Part  2, the  Pharmacy Manual will be updated  to document 
the method of administration of rF1V vaccine and CpG 1018 selected for Part 2.  
• Part 2:  Part 2 will begin after immunogenicity assessments from the Day 57 visit in Part 1 
are completed.  The method of vaccine  administration  method  that is selected  from Part 1 will 
be evaluated in Part 2. Group 1 (if selected) (N=70): rF1V vaccine co -administered with  
CpG 1018  
• Group 3 (N=70):  rF1V  vaccine co-administered  with placebo

4.3 Randomization  and Blinding  
This is an observer -blinded clinical study. Both the study subjects and the study personnel 
involved in safety  assessment  (observers)  will be blinded to treatment  assignments.  Designated 
unblinded study- site personnel will be responsible for preparing and administering the study 
injection.  
In Part 1, subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to Group 1, 2, or 3. In Part 2, subjects will be 
randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 groups  (ie, either Group  1 and 3 or Group 2 and 3) as determined  from 
Part 1. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_3725].

Subjects  who are discontinued from the study will complete  the Early  Discontinuation/EOS 
Visit, if possible, not earlier than [ADDRESS_824113]  review  the informed  consent  form (ICF)  with each prospective 
subject to be certain that the prospective subject understands the procedures and risks of the 
study. Prospective subjects who wish to participate in the study must provide written informed 
consent by [CONTACT_619814].  
The information  from  the consent  form should be translated  and communicated  to the subject  in 
language understandable to the subject and/or legal representative.  
A copy of the signed and dated  consent  form  should be offered  to the subject  or subject’s legally 
acceptable representative before participation in the study. The subject or his/her legally 
acceptable representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes 
available that may be  relevant to  the subject’s willingness to continue participation in the study. 
The communication of this information should be documented. 
The investigator or designee will maintain  a log of all subjects  who sign the ICF. At  a minimum, 
the log will  include a subject identifier, the  dates of informed consent and screening procedures, 
the outcome of the screening, and, if a  screen failure, the reason the subject did not enroll in the 
study. Other items that will be collected on consented participants are age, sex, ethnicity and 
race. These will be captured in the study database.  
Additional  requirements  for informed  consent  are presented  in Section  13.2.

9.4.3 Laboratory Assessments 
Laboratory assessments are listed below and will be performed according to the Schedule of 
Events  (Appendix 1). Sample  collections  will be prior to  administration  of the study vaccine on 
injection days. 
• HIV,  HBV,  HCV  testing  at Screening  Visit 
• Pregnancy testing: For female of childbearing potential (ie, onset of menarche), a serum 
pregnancy test will be performed at screening and must be negative for the subject to participate.  Additionally,  a urine  pregnancy test will be performed  within  [ADDRESS_824120] to receive study 
injection.  
• Chemistry Panel: sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 
creatinine,  glucose, calcium,  aspartate transaminase  (AST),  alanine  transaminase (ALT), 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase  
• Hematology:  red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit,  white  blood cell  count  with 
differential, and platelet count  
• Reserve serum  aliquot  specimens will  be collected  and stored  frozen  at a central  location for 
possible future testing

Laboratory Manual.  
9.4.[ADDRESS_824121]-Injection  Reaction  Assessments 
Assessments  of PI[INVESTIGATOR_619742]  (Section  10.2) will be collected  for a minimum of 30 minutes  following 
each study injection at the clinical site.  
On Day 1 Day 29, and Day 183, subjects  will be asked  to complete  an e-diary  (or equivalent) to 
record any solicited local (pain, redness, pruritus [itchiness], and swelling at the injection site) and solicited systemic signs and symptoms (fatigue, temperature, chills, malaise, myalgia, gastrointestinal symptoms, and headache) during the 7- day follow -up period after vaccination. 
The severity of the post -injection reactions will be graded using the Toxicity Grading Scale for 
Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (Appendix 2 ).

from  Day 1 through Day 7 following each study injection  can be reconstructed  by [CONTACT_619815]. These will be included in the EDC AE dataset.  
Refer  to the eCRF completion  guidelines  for additional  details.  
9.4.5 Adverse Events  
All AEs, as defined in Section 10.0, will be evaluated and reported from immediately after the 
study vaccine injection  on Day 1 through EOS  (Week  56 or Early  Discontinuation) Visit. See  the 
Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1) for the AEs collection schedule.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious  Adverse Events  
All SAEs, as defined in Section 10.7.1, whether assessed as related or not related to study 
vaccine injection, will be evaluated from the time the consent is signed through completion of 
the subject’s  participation  in the study  (EOS  Visit). Any  SAE  must be  reported  to Dynavax or its 
designee within [ADDRESS_824122]  be followed 
until it is considered stable or resolved, including beyond the EOS Visit.  
Any SAE assessed  as not related  to study treatment will be followed  as clinically  indicated  until 
its resolution or, if non -resolving, until it is considered chronic or stable, or until study 
completion (EOS Visit).  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Type  1 Acute  Myocardial  Infarction  (AMI)  
SAEs  of myocardial  infarction  will be further classified  as Type  1 AMI if they  meet  the 
following criteria (Thygesen, Alpert et al. 2018 ): 
• Detection  of a rise and/or  fall of cardiac troponin (cTn) values  with at least [ADDRESS_824123] 1 of the following: 
• Symptoms  of acute myocardial  ischemia  
• New ischemic ECG changes  
• Development  of pathological  Q waves  
• Imaging  evidence  of new loss of viable  myocardium  or new regional  wall motion 
abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology  
• Identification  of a coronary thrombus  by [CONTACT_619816]1V Vaccine with CpG [ADDRESS_824124]’s  CRF  according to Section  7.5 and 
per the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1). 
9.[ADDRESS_824125]  safety  concerns. Procedures  for 
the visit will depend on the reason  for visit as determined  by [CONTACT_619817] [INVESTIGATOR_119251]-investigator. If an UNS Visit is performed because of a safety concern related to study 
treatments, at a minimum, the following should be performed:  
• A targeted  physical  examination  based  on subject -reported  symptoms  including measurement 
of vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature). For additional 
details, see Section 9.4.[ADDRESS_824126]  is discontinued early  from  the study, an Early  Discontinuation/EOS  assessment  should be 
conducted not earlier than [ADDRESS_824127] administration of study vaccine ( Section 9.7).  
9.7 Early  Discontinuation/End of Study  
An EOS Assessment is required at Week 56 (Day 393) in alignment with the protocol, GCP as 
defined in International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines and US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and applicable local regulatory requirements. The EOS procedures will be 
performed  as an Early  Discontinuation assessment at  least [ADDRESS_824128] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug, whether or not 
considered  drug related.  An AE can  therefore  be any unfavorable  and unintended sign (including 
a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the study treatment.  
Medical conditions present at Screening (ie, before informed consent is obtained) or present before the study vaccine injection (Day 1) are not AEs and are not recorded on the AE CRF. 
These medical conditions should be adequately documented on the Medical History CRFs. Any 
increase in severity  or frequency of a medical  condition documented as medical  history  after the 
study vaccine injection will be recorded as an AE and will be captured on the AE CRF.  
Post-injection reactions ( Section 10.2 ) persisting beyond 7 days after each study injection are 
considered  to be  AEs and need  to be  recorded  and reported as AEs.  These  will be included in the 
electronic data capture (EDC) AE dataset.  
If a PIR is inadequately recorded by [CONTACT_619818] e -diary and occurred during the diary 
period from Day 1 through Day 7 following each study injection, the investigator can retrospectively  evaluate  and report  at their discretion  (as a health  care provider),  as necessary, 
through the date of onset on the AE CRF page. These data will be included in the EDC AE 
dataset.  
An uncomplicated pregnancy is not an AE or SAE  and should not be reported  as an AE/SAE. 
Subjects should be followed as described in Section 10.9. 
The reporting  period for all non-serious AEs begins  at the time of the first study vaccine 
injection (Day 1) through EOS. All AEs will be captured on the AE CRF. The investigator will  follow  all related  non-serious AEs  observed during the study until the AEs 
are considered  resolved  or until EOS.  Dynavax or the Dynavax designee may  request  additional 
follow -up on specific unresolved events.  
AEs should be documented in terms  of a single  medical  diagnosis. When this is not possible, the 
AE should be documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by [CONTACT_456391].  
Any Grade  3 (severe) solicited  or unsolicited  AE that is considered possibly or probably related 
to treatment must be reported to Dynavax or its designee within [ADDRESS_824129] -injection reactions will be 
graded using  the Toxicity  Grading Scale for Healthy  Adult  and Adolescent  Volunteers  Enrolled 
in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials ( Appendix 2).  
Certain  local  and systemic events  are routinely  monitored in vaccine clinical trials  as indicators 
of vaccine reactogenicity. It is recognized that each of these events, and particularly those of 
systemic nature, may under  certain circumstances, in an individual  subject, have a  cause that is 
unrelated to study vaccine. However, as a matter of convenience and in accordance with common clinical practice, such events occurring within a specified period of time after immunization are herein termed ‘post -injection reactions’ and will be considered as related to 
treatment.  
Post-injection  reactions documented by [CONTACT_619819] a diary, reviewed  by [CONTACT_368849]/coordinator with the subject and recorded appropriately.  
10.3 Overdoses  
If an AE is  associated  with or resulted  from an overdose  of study vaccine (for the purpose  of this 
study defined as more than twice the protocol -specified dose), it will be documented on the AE 
CRF. If it is an SAE, it will also be  reported to Dynavax or the Dynavax designee following the 
SAE reporting process (see Section 10.9.2).  
10.4 Adverse Events  Associated  With  Cancer  
If an AE is  associated with or resulted  from cancer, it  will be  documented on the AE CRF.  If it is 
an SAE, it will also be reported to Dynavax or the  Dynavax designee following the SAE 
reporting process (see Section 10.9.2).  
 
 
10.5 Definition  of Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction  (AR)  is defined as any AE caused  by [CONTACT_2224] a pharmaceutical  product. 
ARs are a subset of all suspected AEs for which there is reason to conclude that the 
pharmaceutical product caused the event.  
10.6 Definition  of Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
Suspected  adverse  reaction  (SAR)  means any AE for  which  there  is a reasonable  possibility that 
the study treatment caused the AE. Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study treatment and AE. An SAR implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than AR, which means an AE caused by a study treatment.

Amendment  5 
CONFIDENTIAL  AND  PROPRIETARY  Page  57 of 79  
 10.7 Definition  of Unexpected  Adverse Event  or Unexpected  Suspected  Adverse 
Reactions  
An AE or SAR is considered  unexpected  if it is not listed  in the Investigator’s  Brochure  or the 
approved product label or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been previously 
observed.  
10.[ADDRESS_824130]  (imAESI) are defined  according to a pre- 
specified list of event terms including autoimmune, autoinflammatory, and hypersensitivity disorders (Appendix 3). Each subject will be assessed for AESIs  during the entire trial.  
10.9 Serious  Adverse Events  
10.9.1  Definition  of Serious  Adverse Events  
An AE is considered  an SAE  if it meets  any of the following criteria: 
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening  
Note:  An AE or SAR is considered  life-threatening if, in the view  of either the investigator  or 
sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an 
AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires  in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619753]  
• Results in persistent  or significant disability  or incapacity  
That is, the event  severely  or permanently  disrupts  the subject's  ability  to perform normal  life 
functions or daily activities.  
• Results in a congenital  anomaly or birth  defect  
• Is medically  significant  (Important  Medical Event)  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate  in other  situations,  such as important  medical  events  that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619754]. Examples 
of such events are allergic bronchospasm requiring treatment in an emergency room, serious 
blood dyscrasias, or seizures/convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. The 
development  of drug dependence  or drug abuse  would also be examples of important  medical 
events.  
Note: Elective  surgery is not an SAE.  Additionally, an Emergency  Room  visit does not fulfill the 
criteria of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619755].  
Dynavax  Technologies  Corporation 
rF1V Vaccine with CpG [ADDRESS_824131] 
information  for reporting  SAEs  will be  provided  to each site. General  SAE  reporting  instructions 
are as follows:  
• Submit SAE  documents  according  to instructions  provided.  
• Record  all SAEs  on the AE CRF.  
• For SAEs,  record  the primary  event  on the AE CRF;  describe  events  occurring  secondary  to 
that primary event on the SAE form in the narrative description of the case.  
• Death  is an outcome, not  an event. Record the event  that resulted  in the death  as the fatal 
event on the AE CRF.  
• For hospi[INVESTIGATOR_304867], record the illness leading to the surgical  or diagnostic  procedure  as the SAE,  not the procedure  itself. Capture  the procedure 
in the narrative as part of the action taken in response to the illness.  
• Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619756]. Complications  that prolong  elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619757].  Emergency 
room visits of less than 24 hours do not meet the criterion of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619758].  
 
The SAE  report  should contain,  at a minimum,  the following  information: 
• Subject  identifiers  (ie, subject  number)  
• Suspected  medicinal  product  
• AE term (must  be listed as  serious)  
• Contact  [CONTACT_619820] (Section  10.2). 
Follow -up information should be actively sought and submitted as it becomes available. 
The investigator will assess relationship to study treatment. In addition, the sponsor will assess relationship  to study treatment and determine  expectedness to study vaccine based  on the current 
study vaccine Investigator's Brochure and USPI. The sponsor will report all study vaccine suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to regulatory  authorities as expedited 
reports in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements (eg, 21 CFR 312.32[c] and 314.80[e] in the US). All other SAEs will be reported as part of regulatory safety updates, as required, such as in annual reports.  
Dynavax  Technologies  Corporation 
rF1V Vaccine with CpG [ADDRESS_824132] Results  
The severity  of AEs and laboratory  abnormalities  will be graded  based  on the United  States  Food 
and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Guidance for Industry: Center for Biologics Evaluation and 
Research  (CBER)  Toxicity  Grading Scale for Healthy  Adult  and Adolescent  Volunteers  Enrolled 
in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials in Appendix 2, with the modification that, by [CONTACT_559], all fatal AEs will be graded as Grade 5 (Fatal).  
All AEs  not listed in  the CBER  toxicity  grading scale  will be  graded as  shown in Table 10- 1.

Grade  4 – Potentially  life-threatening  Emergency  room  visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619759]  5 Death  
CBER = Center  for Biologics  Evaluation  and Research.  
 
For all AEs and SAEs,  if there  is a change  in the severity  after the event  onset, the  event  should 
be reported as a single entry with the maximum severity grading captured.  
10.10.2  Relationship of  Adverse Events  to Study  Treatment  
The investigator will determine  the relationship  of the AE to  study vaccine  using the definitions 
provided in Table 10- 2.

Definition  
Not Related  Another  cause of  the event  is most  plausible;  or clinically plausible  temporal  sequence 
is inconsistent with the onset of the event and the study treatment administration; or a 
causal relationship is considered biologically implausible.  
Possibly  Related  An event  that follows  a reasonable temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the study 
treatment or  a known or expected  response  pattern  to the suspected  drug,  but that could 
readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Probably Related  An event that follows  a reasonable temporal sequence from administration  of the study 
treatment, and there is a biologically plausible mechanism for study treatment causing 
or contributing to the AE, and the event could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_619821]’s  clinical  state.  In addition,  the relationship  may be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_619760].  
AE = adverse  event.  
 
If the  SAE  is assessed  as possibly or probably related  to study  vaccine,  the SAE  must  be 
followed until it is considered resolved, chronic or stable, including beyond EOS.  
Any SAE assessed  as not related  to study vaccine  will be followed  as clinically  indicated  until its 
resolution or, if non- resolving, until it is considered chronic or stable, or until [ADDRESS_824133] study injection. Follow -up information should be actively sought by [CONTACT_619822]. The 
investigator will complete the pregnancy reporting form and all other relevant eCRFs.  
Uncomplicated pregnancies are not considered an AE/SAE. A complicated pregnancy or a 
pregnancy with an adverse  outcome  may meet  criteria  for an AE or SAE  and would then also be 
reported according to the appropriate requirements. 
A subject who becomes pregnant will be instructed to report the pregnancy to the study site as 
soon as possible. The subject should be  followed by [CONTACT_619823]  (including beyond EOS).  A report  of the  pregnancy 
will be completed by [CONTACT_619824], outcome of pregnancy, and details of delivery.

multiplicity  adjustments  are made,  and all statistical tests will be conducted at 5% two-sided 
Type I level unless otherwise specified.  
All analyses of demographics, medical history, and safety will be summarized in a descriptive manner. In general, continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_249776], mean, standard  deviation, median,  quartiles,  minimum and maximum,  and categorical  variables will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_619825]. No 
specific safety hypotheses will be tested.

the protective efficacy in humans using a regression model. An initial predicted protection 
threshold  will be calculated  based  on the data generated  in this study in Group 3 after 3  doses  of 
rF1V vaccine. Once the threshold is  identified, it will be applied  to the study  groups  in Part 2 of 
the study to evaluate the objectives. In addition to the previous animal studies conducted to establish  protective  efficacy, a new animal model  utilizing  rF1V  vaccine with CpG 1018 will be 
developed to establish the protective level of antibody for CpG 1018 containing vaccines.  
Additional  analyses will include  a predicted  protection threshold that will be calculated  based  on 
the data generated  under  the new animal  model  after 2  doses  of rF1V  vaccine  with CpG  1018. In 
both instances, the animal -to-human immunobridge and the identification of the predicted 
protection thresholds will be documented in a separate report.  
A similar approach  was used to analyze the previous  Phase 2a and Phase 2b study data using the 
animal model from the  previous animal studies. Thresholds that corresponded to 50% predicted 
protective efficacy in humans were established for those trials. In a pooled analysis of these previous immunobridge studies, 93% (95% Clopper Pearson confidence interval [CI] = 85%, 98%) of subjects reached the predicted protection threshold.  
It is assumed that a similar percentage of the subjects in Group 3 will reach the threshold 
identified  in this study. When this threshold is applied  to both Part 2 study  groups, a  similar

95% Clopper Pearson  CI for different observed levels  of predicted  protection assuming  85 of the 
90 planned subjects (Part 1 N =  20 and Part 2 N =70) will have data available for the evaluation. 
Thus, with a predicted protection level of 93%, the lower bound of the 95% CI would be 85%.

Part 2 Exploratory  Objective  1: To assess  long term clinical  benefit  from  rF1V  vaccine  with CpG 
1018 compared with rF1V vaccine  
Endpoint:  Risk ratio of subjects with 2' 6 months clinical benefit between  rFlV  vaccine with 
CpG 1018 and rF1V vaccine  
Criterion for evaluation: 2' 6 months clinical benefit is defined as retaining the predicted 
protection  antibody level  for 2' 6 months. Previous rF1V  vaccine data showed  a small  percentage 
of subjects  who received 3 doses of rF1V  vaccine had 2' 6 months clinical benefit. Similar levels 
are expected for those who received 2 doses of rF1V vaccine with CpG 1018.  Endpoint: predicted  protection (percentage of subjects reaching  the threshold that 
corresponds to 50% predicted vaccine efficacy) at Week 8 after 2 doses of rF1V vaccine with  
CpG 1018 as that at Week  30 after 3 doses of rF1V  vaccine without CpG 1018  
Percentage of subjects reaching the  threshold and associated 95% two -sided 
Clopper- Pearson  confidence intervals  will be computed. Fisher’s  exact  tests will be used  to 
compare predicted protection rate between study groups.  
Criterion  for evaluation: similar percentage of subjects reaching  the threshold that 
corresponds to 50% predicted vaccine efficacy after 2 doses of rF1V vaccine with CpG 1018 as 
compared to that after 3 doses of rF1V vaccine.  
Part 2  Primary  Objective 2: To assess  the serum concentration to rF1V  vaccine 
with CpG 1018 compared with rF1V vaccine 28 days after the second dose of vaccine  
Endpoint: Ratio  of geometric  mean  ELISA  concentration (GMC)  between  rF1V  vaccine with 
CpG 1018 and rF1V vaccine at Week 8 
Criterion  for evaluation: 2- times  increase in GMC point estimate  after the second 
dose of rF1V vaccine with CpG [ADDRESS_824140] (IRB).

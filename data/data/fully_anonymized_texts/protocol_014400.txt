5 1. OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Study Desig n 
 
 
This study was designed to enroll 50 s ubjects with untreated  chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small 
lymphocytic lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) who meet IWCLL 2008 criteria for initiation of therapy will 
initiate single -agent idelalisib  (GS1101) , a PI3K delta specific inhibitor,  daily for the first two 
months on study, and begin ofatumumab at the start of the 3rd month following a complete 
response evaluation . The duration of combination therapy will be 8 months.  All subjects will 
receive 8 weekly doses of ofatumumab, following which they will under go another response 
evaluation.  They will then continue with idelalisib  during their 4 monthly doses of ofatumumab.  
The final primary endpoint response evaluation will occur two months after completi on of 
ofatumumab, at 10 months following start of thera py.  Therapy with idelalisib  will continue 
throughout the ofatumumab therapy and after, until development of progressive disease. Once 
participants  are receiving single agent idelalisib  therapy they will be seen in clinic every 2 
months. After treatment is  complete s ubjects will  be followed every 3 -6 months at the treating 
investigator’s discretion until initiation of a new therapy or death. Subjects who do not complete 
cycle 2 are not considered evaluable for the study efficacy objectives and may be replac ed. Their 
data will be included in all toxicity evaluations.  
  
As of 3/11/2016, [COMPANY_009] has observed an excess of infectious deaths in three trials, one i n upfront 
CLL, and as a result the FDA and [COMPANY_009] are discontinuing enrollment to upfront CLL tr ials as 
well as discontinuing the administration of idelalisib to patients previously enr olled on these 
trials.  All patients on this trial however may receive ofatumumab as planned and continue to be 
followed per protocol.  Correlative analyses will continue as previously planned.

 402 kinases in the Ambit KinomeScan; idelalisib  at 10 µM (0.42 µg/mL) inhibited PI3K 
enzymes but showed no activity against other enzymes.   
Potency and selectivity have been confirmed in cell-based in vitro assays.  In human whole 
blood, idelalisib  potently inhibited basophil activation via a PI3Kδ -dependent pathway, with an 
EC 50 of 62 nM; by [CONTACT_22242], inhibition of basophil activation via a PI3K γ-dependent pathway 
showed an EC 50 of 4,456 nM.  Idelalisib  also showed potent in vitro  inhibition of 
PI3Kδ -mediated processes in other cell types; activation of human B- cell proliferation via the 
B-cell receptor, neutrophil degranulation in response to bacterial peptide, and stim ulation of 
human T- cell proliferation via the T -cell receptor were inhibited with respective EC [ADDRESS_1281634], when examining PI3Kα - or PI3Kβ - mediated 
phosphorylation of AKT in primary mouse fibroblasts, idelalisib  showed EC 50 values of >[ADDRESS_1281635] permeability, indicating  efflux  driven by 
[CONTACT_912213] (for e.g., human P- glycoprotein (MDR1) and breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP) ); idelalisi b is a substrate for the efflux transporters MDR1 and BCRP; however, the 
permeability increases in a concentration -dependent manner, resulting in a lower efflux ratio at 
higher, clinically relevant concentrations of idelalisib.  
Idelalisib exhibits moderat ely high plasma protein binding in mouse, rat, dog, and human.  In 
dog and human plasma, the protein binding is concentration-independent between [ADDRESS_1281636] comparable free fractions.  In human plasma, idelalisib and GS-563117 (a metabolite  of 
idelalisib) have an average free fraction of ~16% and ~12%, respectively. 
After oral administration of [14C]idelalisib to rats and dogs, radioactivity is widely distri buted, 
but relatively excluded from bone, brain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], and eye lens in rats and from brain a nd 
eyes in dogs.  In rats, the radioactivity decline s steadily and most tissues have undetectable levels 
by [ADDRESS_1281637]- cannulated rats  and dogs, ≥ 69% of radioactivity is recovered 
in bile and urine, indicating high absorption of idelalisib in vivo. 
In hepatic tissues from nonclinical species, idelalisib is primarily metabolized by  [CONTACT_912214], CYP3A, and UGT1A4.  In vitro metabolism in dog and human yields [ADDRESS_1281638] GS-563117 i s 
the predominant metabolite in vitro and in vivo.  In preclinical species, plasma levels of GS-
563117 are below those of idelalisib.  However, in humans GS-563117 plasma levels 
significantly exceed those of idelalisib.  After oral administration of [14C]idelalisib to rats and 
dogs, b iliary excretion appears to be  the major route of elimination of idelalisib  and its 
metabolites  as the majority of radioactivity is found in feces or bile and little in urine.

November 1, [ADDRESS_1281639]/moderate inhibition of CYP2C8 (IC 50 = 13 µM), CYP2C19 (IC 50 = 76 µM), and CYP3A 
(IC 50 = 44 µM). GS-563117 shows insignificant inhibition of CYP1A, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, and is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A (IC 50 = 3.1 µM). 
Idelalisib shows insignificant inhibition of the transporters BCRP, OCT2, OAT1, and O AT3, and 
modest/moderate inhibition of MDR1 (IC50 = 7.7 µM), OATP1B1 (IC50 = 10.1 µM), 
OATP1B3 (IC50 = 7.0 µM), and the glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A1 (IC50 = 42.0 µM).  GS-
563117 shows insignificant inhibition of MDR1, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, 
and OCT2, and moderate inhibition of UGT1A1 (IC50 = 16.8 µM). 
In support of clinical development in patients with lymphoid cancers, idelalisib has  undergone 
toxicological evaluation in conformance with the International Conference on Har monisation 
(ICH) S9 guidance on nonclinical evaluation for anticancer pharmaceuticals  
[IP_ADDRESS]  General Toxicology 
Completed GLP toxicology studies have included 28-day evaluations in both rats and dogs a nd a 
study evaluating the hematological effects of co -administration of idelalisib  and 
cyclophosphamide [3]. These studies have shown idelalisib  to be tolerated at exposure levels 
greater than those expected to provide therapeutic activity and have identified si gnals to be 
monitored in the clinic. Reversible lymphoid depletion in rats and dogs was consistent wi th 
idelalisib -mediated inhibition of PI3K δ. In rats, partially reversible inflammation of the tongue 
was noted in idelalisib -treated animals; this may have represented an exaggeration of background  
effects related to gavage -mediated irritation. Mild congestion or hemorrhage in the large 
intestine has been seen in dogs receiving high doses of idelalisib . Rats also showed cardiac and 
hepatic chronic inflammatory infiltrates, although attribution to idelalisib  was uncertain because 
background infiltrates of a similar nature were observed in control recovery a nimals. In dogs, 
evidence of hepatocellular injury and chronic inflammation was accompanied by [CONTACT_912215] (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and serum aspar tate 
aminotransferase [AST]). These hepatic effects appeared dose -related, reversible, and 
monitorable using standard serum chemistry laboratory parameters. In both ra ts and dogs, 
persistent minimal to mild degenera tion of the seminiferous tubules and decreased spermatozoa 
were present in male animals receiving idelalisib . When co -administered with cyclophosphamide 
in rats, idelalisib  did not worsen cyclophosphamide- mediated changes in hematological 
parameters.  
Data from completed 13-week GLP toxicology studies in rats and dogs are available. These data 
confirm the 28-day toxicology findings. Idelalisib  was well tolerated with no notable clinical 
observation or changes in body weight at exposure levels approximating o r exceeding those 
observed in subjects at the planned clinical starting dose of 150 mg/dose administered twice per 
day (BID). In both species, dose-dependent lymphoid depletion was observed that was cons istent 
with PI3K δ inhibition by [CONTACT_912216] . In dogs, expected transient low -level elevations of serum 
IDELALISIB + Ofa  
November 1, [ADDRESS_1281640] idelalisib  dose were observed at Day 29 of the study; of 
note, animals showed spontaneous recovery during continued idelalisib  dosing, with no 
elevations at Day [ADDRESS_1281641]. In this study, mean serum ALT/AST values peaked at approximately Day 24 to Day 
27 and resolved spontaneously as the dogs continued on idelalisib  through the end of the study 
on Day 44. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Genotoxicity 
Idelalisib  was not genotoxic in a standard battery of assays [3]. In the Ames assay, idelalisib  did 
not cause mutagenic effects. In human peripheral blood lymphocytes, the compound induced no 
chromosomal aberrations. In a rat micronucleus study, idelalisib  did not show evidence of 
clastogenicity.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reproductive Toxicology 
A definitive embryo -fetal developmental toxicity study  of idelalisib was  performed in time -
mated pregnant female rats. Maternal toxicity was demonstrated by [CONTACT_2715]-depe ndent decreases in 
the body weight gains of the dams. Dose -dependent developmental findings included decreased 
fetal viability , greater numbers of early and late fetal resorptions, and reduced fetal wei ghts. 
Dose -dependent e xternal malformations included short tail or no tail in multiple fetuses, and 1 
instance each of hydrocephaly and microphthalmia.  The results of this study indicate that oral 
administration of idelalisib  is embryolethal and teratogenic in rats at maternally toxic doses.   
As noted in Sec tion [IP_ADDRESS], 28-day and 13-week general toxicology studies in rats and dogs 
indicated dose- dependent reductions in testicular weights, with persistent minimal to mild 
degeneration of the seminiferous tubules and decreased spermatozoa in rats and 
hypospermatogenesis in dogs. The impact of these testicular changes on fertil ity, if any, has not 
been assessed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Phototoxicity  
In vitro studies in embryonic murine fibroblasts have yielded equivocal results re lating to the 
phototoxic ity of idelalisib but suggest that its major oxidative metabolite, GS -563117, may 
enhance cytotoxicity when cells are simultaneously exposed to ultraviolet li ght. While 
nonclinical findings suggest the hypothetical potential for phototoxicity in humans, available 
clinic al data do not reveal a photosafety concern [3].

 inhibitors; and idelalisib  absorption, metabolism and excretion[4].  A Phase 1 study in subjects 
with allergic rhinitis has offered additional safety information and confirme d the expected 
immunomodulatory pharmacological effects of the drug.  A Phase 1 study in patient s with 
lymphoid malignancies has e xtended safety and pharmacokinetic observations; documented the 
clinical and pharmacodynamic activity of idelalisib  in patients with  CLL,  iNHL,  and MCL; and 
provided dosing information in support of further development[4-6].  Idelalisib was recently 
approved by [CONTACT_912217] b, as well as 
for the therapy of relapsed indolent NHL after at least two prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
2.2.1 Phase 1 Studies in Healthy Subjects and in Patients with Allergic Rhinitis  
Three studies in healthy subjects (Studies 101-01, 101-04, and 101-05) have provided 
information regarding drug safety, pharmacokinetics, food effects, and the potentia l for drug 
interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors [3, 4]. One of these trials also included a prelim inary 
evaluation of absorption, metabolism and excretion in healthy volunteers; in this tria l, unlabeled 
idelalisib  was co -administered with a trace amount of [14C] idelalisib  given either orally or 
intravenously and biological samples were assessed by [CONTACT_912218].  
Safety results from these studies indicated that idelalisib  was well tolerated when administered to 
healthy subjects at single doses through 400 mg (the highest dose level tested) and wa s also 
generally well tolerated when administered to healthy subjects over 7  days at dose levels through 
200 mg/dose BID (the highest dose level tested). Dosing with 200 mg/dose BID for 7 days 
resulted i n a skin rash in 3 out of 6 subjects; histological findings were consistent with a dela yed-
type hypersensitivity maculopapular exanthema. Rashes have sometimes occur red in patients 
with hematological malignancies receiving idelalisib , but have not typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y proved  dose- or 
treatment -limiting. In placebo -controlled single-dose and multiple- dose trials, repeated ECG 
evaluations performed in tandem with pharmacokinetic monitoring showed no evidence of dr ug-, 
dose-, or exposure- dependent effects on cardiac rhyt hm or cardiac intervals (eg, QT interval).  
Pharmacokinetic results indicated that plasma idelalisib  maximum concentration (C max) and area 
under the concentration- time curve (AUC) values were less -than-dose-proportional with 
increasing  single - and multiple -dose administration. Consistent with mean half- life (t 1/2) values 
in the range of [ADDRESS_1281643] .  
Idelalisib dosing after a high -fat, high- calorie meal delayed median time of maximum 
concentration (T max) from 0.75  hours to 3 hours ; mean C max was unaffected and mean AUC was 
~40% higher. These  changes in idelalisib  exposures are considered modest/clinically non-
relevant ; thus, idelalisib  may be given with or without food. 
Idelalisib is metabolized in humans primarily  by [CONTACT_231114], with some involvement of 
CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. Accordingly, w hen idelalisib  was administered following 4 days of daily 
dosing with ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4), modest/moderate increases in mean 
idelalisib  Cmax and AUC values of  ~30% and ~80% -higher , respectively , were observed, 
indicating that idelalisib is not a sensitive substrate for CYP3A4. Thus, co- administration of

 CYP3A4 inhibitors and idelalisib is not contraindicated and does not require special monit oring. 
GS-563117 is formed from idelalisib primarily via aldehyde oxidase. 
The 14C-labeled idelalisib huma mass balance results showed that the drug has moderate to hi gh 
oral bioavailability Idelalisib is eliminated mainly via hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion 
in the feces (~78% of dose); recovery in urine was < 15%. GS-563117, was the primary/only 
circulating metabolite observed in human plasma, and was also observed in urine and feces.  
Pharmacodynamic results showed that a n idelalisib  dose of 200 mg inhibited ex vivo basophil 
activation via the PI3K δ-specific, high -affinity immunoglobulin (Ig)E receptor (anti- FCεR1) in 
basophils collected from healthy volunteers. The findings were confirmed when t he drug was 
assessed ov er 7 days in a Phase 1b study in subjects with allergic rhinitis. In this study, idelalisib  
at a dose level of 100  mg/dose BID showed clinical and pharmacodynamic activity (attenuating 
adverse responses to allergenic challenge and decreasing markers of inf lammation) and was well 
tolerated.  
2.2.2 Phase 1 Study in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Hematologic Mali gnancies  
A Phase 1 dose- ranging study ( Study 101-02) of single- agent idelalisib  extended safety and 
pharmacokinetic observations; documented the clinic al and pharmacodynamic activity of 
idelalisib  in subjects with iNHL, MCL, and CLL; and provided dosing information in support of 
further development [7]. In this study, idelalisib  was administered in cohorts of subjects across a 
range of dose levels from 50 mg/dose BID to 350 mg/dose BID. Idelalisib  administration was 
continued as long as individual subjects were safely benefitting from therapy. S ubjects were 
evaluated in 4 -week cycles; response and progression assessments were based on standard 
criteria [8]. 
Altogether, 192 subjects were enrolled to the study, including 55 subjects with CL L. As expected 
given the demographics of these diseases, subjects were predominantly male and  were often 
elderly, ranging in age to 82 years for the subjects with CLL. The majority  (82%) of the subjects 
with CLL had bulky tumors ( ≥1 lymph node ≥5 cm in diameter) and 31% had the adverse 
prognostic factor of a 17p chromosomal deletion (which commonly confers a p53 mutation in the 
tumors of these subjects ). Subjects were heavily pretreated with chemoimmunotherapy; the 
median number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_912183] 5 among subjects with CLL, but rang ed up to 
15 prior treatments. Among those with CLL, prior rituximab, alkylator, and fludar abine use were 
nearly universal and 33 percent had received prior alemtuzumab. Considering only rituxi mab use 
after initial therapy, 35% had received single -agent rituximab at least once (some patients up to 3 
times) and a total of 51/54 (94%) had received rituximab given alone or in combination wit h 
other agents. In the estimation of the investigators, a substantial proportion (72%) of  these 
subjects had disease that was refractory to the last prior therapy. In thes e subjects, therapy was 
administered for a median of 9 cycles, ranging up to 24 cycles (ie, 96 weeks). 
In this single -agent experience, idelalisib  was generally well tolerated at dose levels through 
350 mg BID (the highest dose tested). No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was appare nt within 
the tested dose range. Fur thermore, subjects typi[INVESTIGATOR_912184] >2 years; there was no profile suggestive of bothersome chronic events  such as

related reductions in circulating CD4+ cells or serum Igs.  
Among Grade 3-4 nonhematological adverse events, pneumonia/pneumonitis was observed most 
frequently, occurring in 24% of subjects with CLL. In most instances, these case s were 
considered bacterial in origin, based either on culture results or on response to conventi onal 
antibiotics. Subjects with CLL have occasionally been diagnosed with Pneumocystis (carin ii) 
jiroveci pneumonia; the specific causal role of idelalisib  has been difficult to elucidate because 
infection was sometimes present before starting idelalisib  or the patients had other pre- existing 
risk factors. Such subjects were not receiving pneumocystis prophylaxis. The rat e of pneumonia 
over time (0.045 events/subject/month) with idelalisib  was not worse than the expected rate (0.06 
events/patient/month) reported historically in comparable patients with recurr ent CLL  [9] . 
Monitorable, reversible elevations of hepatic transaminases were observed in som e subjects; 
~5% of subjects with previously treated CLL had Grade 3-[ADDRESS_1281645]. 
The on set of changes was time -dependent; among those with serum ALT/AST abnormalities, 
onset typi[INVESTIGATOR_84718] 2 to 8 weeks after idelalisib  initiation. In subjects with Grade 1 -2 events, 
serum ALT/AST elevations resolved despi[INVESTIGATOR_912185]. In  subjects with Grade 
3-4 events, idelalisib  was temporarily interrupted. Upon resolution of serum ALT/AST 
abnormalities, resumption of idelalisib  at a reduced dose did not result in recurrence of serum 
transaminase increases in the majority (>70%) of subjects who were rechallenged.  This pattern 
suggests an adaptation to the effect similar to that observed in dogs receiving idelalisib . Such an 
adaptive response is commonly observed with other drugs that induce transaminase ele vations. 
Idelalisib  proved highly active in subjects with CLL, iNHL, and MCL. Among subjects with 
CLL, idelalisib  reduced lymphadenopathy in all 51 (100%) of those with ≥[ADDRESS_1281646]- treatment 
tumor assessment. In subjects with CLL tumors having a known 17p chromosomal deletion, 
substantial antitumor activity was observed, although PFS appeared shorter in the se subjects 
relative to other trial participants without such a deletion or in whom the 17p chromosomal 
deletion status was unknown. 
The pattern of changes in CLL was particular ly notable. Rapid and substantial reductions in 
lymph node size were observed in subjects with CLL with >80% of subjects showing a lym ph 
node response ( ≥50% reductions in index nodal lesions). Among subjects who entered the trial 
with baseline thrombocytopenia or anemia, idelalisib  induced sustained increases in mean 
platelet counts and hemoglobin levels. In study participants who entered the study wi th enlarged 
spleens due to CLL, >70% showed a resolution in splenomegaly. The median PFS was [ADDRESS_1281647] in subjects starting idelalisib  at doses of ≥150 mg/dose 
BID.  
A characteristic finding in the single -agent experience was that the majority of subjects had an 
initial increase in peripheral absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) from bas eline. The increase was 
maximal during the first 2 cycles and generally decreased thereafter but could  be persistent in

 some subjects or could be seen repeatedly in subjects who had interruption and resumption of 
drug therapy (eg, due to intercurrent illness). The characteristics of this l ymphocytosis indicated 
a mobilization of CLL cells from tissues rather than a proliferative event or a dis ease flair. The 
effect was evident within 4 hours of initiating treatment, was asymptomatic, and was  associated 
with quiescence of CLL cells as indicated by [CONTACT_533292] A KT phosphorylation and decreases 
in circulating levels of disease -associated chemokines, CCL3 and CCL4, and the stroma- derived 
chemokine, CXCL13. The lymphocyte mobilization phenomenon is consistent w ith in vitro data 
showing that idelalisib  depresses chemokine -mediated signaling between CLL cells and stromal 
cells [10]. These preclinical data support the concept that drug- mediated PI3K δ inhibition 
releases CLL cells from sanctuary sites in lymph nodes and bone marrow. This ac tion is not 
unique to idelalisib  alone. Drugs that inhibit spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) [11], Bruton tyrosine 
kinase (BTK) [12], or mTOR [13] cause a CLL cell redistribution from tissue sites to the 
peripheral blood. Because of the occurrence of this type of pattern, investigators worki ng with 
idelalisib  or inhibitors of these other pathways now rely upon measures of disease control other 
than peripheral blood lymphocyte count in determining whether a patient’s disease has  
progressed. 
An analysis of steady -state idelalisib  plasma concentrations (Day 28 C max, AUC 0-6h, or C trough) 
relative to dose in subjects with both NHL and CLL showed increases in these paramet ers 
through the dose level of 150 mg/dose BID. At higher doses, flattening of the mean dose -plasma 
exposure curve was observed, resulting in smaller incremental increases in ex posure. 
Considering all safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic findings together, t he data supported 
150 mg/dose BID as an appropriate idelalisib  monotherapy starting dose for future studies in 
patients with CLL and other lymphoid malignancies.   
2.2.3 Phase 1 Combination Study in Patients with Hematological Malignancies  
A separate Phase 1 trial (Study 101 -07) has evaluated the safety and preliminary activity of 
idelalisib  given in combination with ofatumumab to subjects with recurrent CLL [14].  
In this study, idelalisib  (150 mg BID) was co -administered with a total of 12  infusions of 
ofatumumab given over 24 weeks (300-mg initial dose followed 1 week later by 1,000 mg 
weekly for 7 doses, followed 4 weeks later by 1,000 mg every 4 weeks for 4 doses). Thereafter, 
subjects continued to receive single-agent idelali sib as long as the subject was safely benefiting 
from therapy. Subjects were evaluated in 4 -week cycles; response and progression assessments 
were based on standard criteria [8]. 
At the time of the data analysis, accrual of the cohorts was complete with 21 subj ects enrolled 
and evaluable. Median [range] age was 66 [43-79] years. The majority (14/21; 67%) of patient s 
had bulky adenopathy ( ≥1 lymph node ≥5 cm in dia meter). The median [range] number of prior 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26615] 3 [1 -6], including prior exposure to alkylating agents (18/21; 86%), rituximab 
(20/21; 95%), purine analogs (16/21; 76%), alemtuzumab (4/21; 19%), and/or ofatumumab 
(3/21; 14%). The median [range] of atumumab  treatment duration was 36+  [0-48+] week.   
IDELALISIB + Ofa  
November 1, [ADDRESS_1281648] all subjects (17/21, 84%) experienced marked and rapid reductions in lymphadenopa thy 
within the first [ADDRESS_1281649] Cycle 1 in only 1 pa tient. 
The ORR was 16/21 (76%) with 2/21 (10%) subjects showing evidence of complete response 
(CR), as reported by [CONTACT_473]. Elevated baseline levels of CCL3, CCL4, CXCL13, and 
TNFα were  significantly reduced after 28  days of treatment. At the time of the data analysis, 
overall PFS through 48 weeks was >75%  and a median PFS had not yet been observed. 
Collectively, the emerging data from this study support furthe r evaluation of idelalisib  together 
with ofatumumab in subjects with CLL and indicate that co -administration of idelalisib  with 
ofatumumab is tolerable when using idelalisib  at full dose, ie, at a starting dose level of 
150 mg/dose BID.  
 
2.2.4.  Updated Data on Early Treatment Trials, 3/11/16 
 
As of 3/11/16, [COMPANY_009] terminated enrollment on all upfront trials in CLL.  This was beca use an 
excess of mortality was observed on the idelalisib containing arms in three t rials:  GS -US_312-
0123, A Phase 3 Randomized Double Blind Placebo Controlled Study Evaluating the Efficacy 
and Safety of Idelalisib (GS1101) in Combination with Bendamustine and Rituximab f or 
Previously Untreated CLL; GS- US-313-0124, A Phase 3 Randomized Double Blind Placebo 
Controlled Study Evaluati ng the Efficacy and Safety of Idelalisib (GS -1101) in Combination 
with Rituximab for Previously Treated Indolent NHLs; and GS- US-313-0125, A Phase 3 
Randomized Double-Blind Placebo Controlled Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Saf ety of 
Idelalisib (GS1101) in Combination with BR for Previously Treated Indolent NHL.  In t otal, of 
664 patients on idelalisib containing arms, 7.4% had died, compared to 3.5% of [ADDRESS_1281650] deaths were due to infections including opportunistic infections, a nd 
prophylaxis had not been mandated.  
2.3 Ofatumumab  
 Ofatumumab is a human novel anti-CD20 antibody which binds to a different CD20 epi[INVESTIGATOR_912186], and induces potent complement–dependent cytotoxicity a gainst cells that express 
CD20 dimly, includin g CLL.  
2.3.1 Nonclinical Pharmacology  
 
Binding of ofatumumab causes clustering of CD20 on the cell surface and cell de ath through the 
induction of complement mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependent cell mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro  studies showed that ofatumumab is able to kill tumor B cells 
including those with low CD20 expression, such as primary chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(CLL) cells, and cells with high expression of complement defense molecules. The anti -tumor 
effects of ofatumumab w ere confirmed in  human B cell tumor xenograft models in mice.

 Statins were found to reduce the in vitro  ability of ofatumumab to induce CDC or ADCC 
mediated cell lysis .  Compared to rituximab, ofatumumab showed potential in nonclinical studies 
to be more potent at inducing CDC, especially in cells with low CD20 expression. Fur thermore, 
as a fully human antibody, ofatumumab is predicted to be less immunogenic than rituximab, 
which is a chimeric monoclonal antibody. 
2.3.2 Effects in Humans  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Pharmacokinetics and pha rmacodynamics  
 
Pharmacokinetic data are available from four completed studies (Study Hx -CD20 -001, Study 
Hx-CD20 -402, Study Hx- CD20 -403, and Study OMB111148), three concluded studies (Study 
Hx-CD20 -405, Study Hx- CD20 -407, and Study GEN414/OMS115102 (48-week  interim 
analysis completed)), and four ongoing studies (Study Hx- CD20 -406, Study Hx -CD20 -409, 
Study GEN410/OFA110635 (completed to 24 weeks), and Study OFA110867 (Day 169 analysis 
completed )). Ofatumumab was administered by [CONTACT_912219]110867, in which it was given by [CONTACT_10530].  After repeated IV administration, clearance 
and volume of distribution values were low and half-life values were long for ofatumum ab, as 
seen with other monoclonal antibodies.  Statistically signi ficant increases in AUC, Cmax, and t½ 
values and decreases in  clearance (CL) values were found between the first and last infusions. 
These findings are  likely due to the rapid and sustained depletion of CD20+ B cells after first 
infusion, leaving a reduced  number of B cells available for the antibody to bind at subsequent 
infusions. Subcutaneous administration of a single dose of ofatumumab ≥30 mg in  subjects with 
rheumatoid arthritis similarly resulted in rapid and sustained B -cell depletion. 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Summary of safety data 
 
Infusion reactions in the IV program are common adverse events (AEs) that are generally  mild to 
moderate in severity, and have been mitigated by [CONTACT_912220]. 
Severe infusion reactions have been reported, and have occasionally led to temporary 
interruption or withdrawal of ofatumumab. Adverse events in the SC program to date have al so 
shown severe reactions, but overall, most AEs have been generally mild to moderate, and h ave 
been considered as post- injection systemic  reactions (PI[INVESTIGATOR_429744]). Infectious events including lower 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_912187], anemia, and 
thrombocytopenia have been observed in oncology trials with ofatumumab, but these events a re 
commonly reported with the diseases under study and/or other concomitant therapie s. 
Neutropenia and serious infections have also been reported in RA studies, but these ge nerally 
occurred at a similar frequency between the ofatumumab and placebo groups. 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Efficacy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)  
 
As of 21 December 2010, efficacy results are av ailable from two completed studies  (Study Hx -
CD20 -402, Study 148) and 2 concluded studies in CLL (Study 406, Study 407).  In Study 402 
(N=33), ofatumumab treatment in subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL led t o a 48% ORR in 
the highest dose group, Group C (n=27; 1st dose: 500 mg; 2nd, 3rd, and 4th dose: 2000 mg) and

 included 12 (44%) subjects with PR and 1 (4%) subject with nodular partial response (nPR). One  
of the subjects showed all features of an nPR at  Week 19 except that residual lymphadenopathy 
was identified by [CONTACT_20420] (CT). For Group C, the median TTP was 15.6 weeks in 
the full analysis population and 23 weeks in the subgroup of responders. The median duration of 
response was 16 weeks and the median time to next CLL therapy was 52.4 weeks.   In Study 406 
(N=154 as of the interim data cutoff of 19 May 2008 and updated results as of cut off of 15 July 
2010), the results demonstrated that ofatumumab monotherapy is effective in subjects with CLL 
who are either refractory to both fludarabin e and  alemtuzumab (i.e., double refractory [DR]) or 
who are refractory to fludarabine and  considered inappropriate for alemtuzumab treatment due to 
the presence of bulky (>5cm)  lymphadenopathy (i.e., bulky fludarabine refractory [BFR]). 
Additionally, ofatu mumab  showed activity in “Other” subjects who failed fludarabine but were 
enrolled in the study prior to Amendment [ADDRESS_1281651] or BFR  defined in the amendment. 
 
The interim results of Study 406 were submitted  as the basis for a BLA to the FDA for  the use of 
ofatumumab for the treatment of CLL refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab ( DR), or 
refractory to fludararabine but considered inappropriate for alemtuzumab treatment due to bulky 
(>5 cm) lymphadenopathy (BFR). The FDA  reviewed the application and subsequently granted 
accelerated approval for ofatumumab  for the treatment of subjects with CLL refractory to 
fludarabine and alemtuzumab (DR population). The Arzerra Prescribing Informa tion describes 
the data presented to the FDA  for accelerated approval. As of the [ADDRESS_1281652] (N= 95), BFR (N= 111), and Other  
(N=17) groups. The ORR was  51% (48/95) in the DR group, 44% (49/111) in the BFR group, 
and 59% (10/17) in the Other group. Among the [ADDRESS_1281653] and BFR groups and 8.9 
months in the Other group. The median Overall survival (OS) was 14.[ADDRESS_1281654] group, 
17.4 months in the BFR group, and 28.3 months in the Other group. Additional data and analyses 
are ongoing.  
 
In Study 407 (N=61), subjects with previously untreated CLL were randomized to two dos e 
levels of ofatumumab in combination with FC (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide): 300 m g of 
ofatumumab (cycle 1) followed by 500 or 1000 mg of ofatumumab (cycles 2-6), in combination 
with FC, every 4 weeks for 6 cycles. The overall response rate in the 500 mg group was 77% and 
in the 1000 mg group was 73%. Complete responses were observed in 32% of subjects (10/31) in 
the 500 mg group and in 50% of subjects (15/30) in the 1000 mg group. Overall, across both 
dose groups 25 subjects had CR, 19 subjects had PR, 2 subjects had nPR, 5 subjects had SD, and 
7 subjects had PD. With the preliminary da ta, short median follow-up time of 8.2 months did not 
permit analysis of  time to event endpoints. 
2.4  Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia  
IDELALISIB + Ofa  
November 1, [ADDRESS_1281655] steadily progressive or aggressive disease.  These patients tend to experi ence shorter and 
shorter remissions, as well as cumulative effects of chemotherapy, which ha s significant toxicity 
to their normal bone marrow and immune system.  Over time the disease may become more 
aggressive, acquiring adverse prognostic markers including 11q and 17p deletions.  For this  
reason a highly effective novel therapy which does not induce the myelosuppressiv e and 
immunosuppressive effects of chemoimmunotherapy would be ideal.  Such a therapy which 
patients can remain on indefinitely for maintenance is even better.   The idelalisib  ofatumumab 
combination studied here has the potential to be such a therapy.   
  
2.5 Rationale  
 
The advent of chemoimmunotherapy has been very effective in the initial treatme nt of CLL, 
resulting in long remissions.  Increasing evidence suggests however that pa tients who relapse 
after chemoimmunotherapy often do not respond well to furthe r chemotherapy.  Furthermore, 
there is  an increasing awareness of the long term complications of chemoimmunotherapy , 
including delayed infections, pancytopenia and MDS/AML.  Novel agents that do not have thes e 
side effects, including antibodies and small targeted inhibitors, can be quite effe ctive even in 
refractory disease, and it is of interest to determine their efficacy in previo usly untreated patients, 
who may be able to attain prolonged remissions withou t the side effects of 
chemoimmunotherapy.  Ofatu mumab has a 51% response rate in patients refractory to 
fludarabine and alemtuzumab, and has been recently approved by [CONTACT_912221].  
Ofatumumab clears CLL from peripheral blood very effectively.  Its activit y in previously 
untreated CLL has  only recently been described, and the ORR is 55%[15].   
 
The investigational drug idelalisib  is a specific inhibitor of the delta isoform of PI3 kinase, which 
is expressed in hematopoietic cells and a ppears to be functionally critic al in B cells.  
Approximately [ADDRESS_1281656] been treated on the Phase I 
study of idelalisib .  At IWCLL and ASH 2009 and 2010, response rates of 60% in indolent 
lymphomas were reported.  Interestingly, in CLL, all patients have reductions i n 
lymphadenopathy, with 80% of patients reaching >50% reduction, often within 1-2 weeks, and 
apparently independent of high risk 17p or 11q deletions.  However, concomitant with this 
marked decrease in adeno pathy is an increase in lymphocytosis.  This lymphocytosis appears to 
represent a redistribution of lymphocytes from lymph nodes and possibly bone marrow to 
peripheral blood.  Because of the response criteria for CLL, however, this lymphocyt osis has 
prevented  a response from being called, even in a patient with marked improvement in bulky 
lymphadenopathy.  A recent revision to the response criteria supports that this lymphocytosis is 
not progressive disease, and that patients with nodal response with lympho cytosis may be 
considered as PRs with lymphocytosis.  However, this pattern of response suggests  that 
combining idelalisib ’s activity in nodal disease with another drug which would effectively clear 
the lymphocytosis should result in excellent and frequent clinical responses.  In fa ct, in 
previously untreated patients this may represent a potential paradigm fo r achieving excellent 
disease control without the side effects of chemotherapy.  Thus the combination of idelalisib  to 
IDELALISIB + Ofa  
November 1, [ADDRESS_1281657] therefore  previously amended  the protocol 
to significantly increase the frequency of LFT monitoring during the high ris k period .  
Additional observation has shown that  this transaminitis appears to be inflammatory, based on 
the results of two liver biopsies showing a CD8 T cell infiltrate and the respons e of these patients 
to steroids and/or mycophenolate mofetil.  We have developed an algorithm for the earl y 
initiation of steroids with the first signs of transaminitis which together with the fre quent 
monitoring has resulted in predictable safety and much shorter drug interruptions.  This 
amendment serve d to further refine that treatment algorithm.  
 An amendment was su bmitted in January 2015 to add correlative studies, in particular 
sequencing analysis of the clonal composition of CLL in PB vs BM at baseline, mi d treatment 
and at final restaging.  This analysis will still occur .  
 
Rationale for Current Amendment 3/14/16 
 
This amendment will take all patients off idelalisib, but allow them to receive ofatumumab  and 
be followed per protocol assessments.  All patients had discontinued idelalisib as of 3/ 11/16.  
They will undergo a full disease restaging with correlative sam ples within [ADDRESS_1281658] for overall survival.   
 
 
2.6 Correlative Studies Background and Rationale  
 
a) Prognostic correlates - Prognosis in CLL is widely variable and well- correlated with several 
key biologic prognostic factors.  We will therefore determine standard CLL  prognostic markers 
including FISH, IGHV  and ZAP-70 (by [CONTACT_912222])  in all patients in order 
to determine if a particular subgroup shows better response to ide lalisib -ofa than others, as well 
as to define the response rate in each subgroup.  We will employ CT scans in order t o compare 
response rates determined with and without CT scans, and a bone marrow biopsy will be 
incorporated at the end of single agent lea d-in, and combination therapy even for patients not in 
CR, in order to gain information on the effectiveness of bone marrow clearance with t hese two 
drugs.  The bone marrow biopsy at two  months on therapy will allow comparison of the features 
IDELALISIB + Ofa  
November 1, [ADDRESS_1281659]  to determine how 
long ofatumumab will remain detectable following completion of the course of ther apy.  We will 
also assess whether CD20 expression levels are altered with ofatumumab therapy .    
  
b) Activation studies of CLL B cells - CLL cells generally express markers of activation on their 
cell surface.  This may be related to the degree of activation of the BCR pat hway, which is 
inhibited by [CONTACT_912216].  We will therefore use flow cytometry to determine whether activation 
markers are altered by [CONTACT_912223] a single agent or in combination with ofatumumab.  We 
further hypothesize that idelalisib  will potently inhibit downstream signaling triggered by [CONTACT_912224], and we will therefore assess t he effects of in viv o 
inhibition of the PI3K delta pathway by [CONTACT_912225].  Other pharmacodynamic 
markers of PI3 kinase inhibition will also be assessed , including for example production of T cell 
chemokines, to see if these correlate with degree of response.       
 
c) CLL B cells and their microenvironment - CLL B -cells are shifted out of the 
microenvironment by [CONTACT_912216].  We will compare the biologic features of CLL cells  in PB and 
BM at baseline and again on idelalisib therapy, to see if these features shif t in the two 
compartments over time.  We will look at markers of activation and proliferation in bot h 
compartments.   We will look at whether in vivo therapy with idelalisib alters in vitro 
susceptibility to antibody therapy and to therapy with other BCR pathway inhibitor s. 
 
d) Predictors of response to idelalisib  - Little is known about predictors of response to 
idelalisib , or mechanisms of resistance.  [CONTACT_912270] will explore the baseline activity of  
the PI3K pathway and the degree of observed inhibition in this regard, and will also look for  
upregulation of alternative signaling pathways in resistant cells.  In addition,  we will  bank CLL 
cells from prior to all therapy, for assessment of copy number, somatic mutation, gene 
expression and mRNA and miRN A profiling.  [CONTACT_691851] has recently completed a large 
integrative analysis in CLL in which she identified amplifications of PIK3CA as a ssociated with 
poor outcome, and found that CLLs with PIK3CA amplification had a higher fraction of PI3K 
activity depende nt on alpha vs delta.  We therefore hypothesize that these amplifications may be 
associated with idelalisib  resistance, or may be acquired in patients who progress on therapy, and 
we plan to assess for them in patients with persistently elevated white c ounts, or who develop 
recurrent lymphocytosis on therapy.  Although we have not yet identified a significant rate of 
somatic mutations in PI3K genes in CLL, we have identified somatic RAS, MAPK  and mTOR 
mutations which could confer resistance, and we will plan to perform whole exome se quencing 
to assess for such mutations.    
e) Immune suppression correlative  studies - CLL progression is associated with 
hypogammaglobulinemia  [16-18], expanded T- regs [19, 20], and increased soluble 
immunosuppressive cytokines (TGF- β [21-23] , IL-6 [24-26] , IL-10 [24, 27-29] ) derived from 
the primary tumor cells that can promote both survival of the malignant clone and also pote ntial 
systemic innate  immune suppression. Similar to these well -characterized cytokines, expression 
of PD1 and PD1-L1 on activated CLL cells has the potential for suppression of the innate 
IDELALISIB + Ofa

20 
 immune system as demonstrated in other types of lymphoma [30, 31] and multiple myeloma  
[32]. The consequence of such innate immune suppression in CLL relative to antibody therapy  
is likely significant as exemplified by [CONTACT_912226]. While rituximab has signif icant 
activity in NHL (reviewed in  [33, 34]), success as monotherapy in CLL has been modest 
(reviewed in  [35, 36]). Furthermore, unlike NHL and other cancers where specific Fc γR SNPs 
predict for increased effectiveness of antibody therapy, work [37, 38] of John By[CONTACT_912227] [39] showed no such relationship in CLL for rituxima b. 
Several groups  [40],[41] have documented that one possible reason for innate immune 
dysfunction could be suppressive cytokines released by [CONTACT_7879]. Reversal of tumor  
immunosuppressive properties with respect to cytokine release represents a ne w potential way 
to augment antibody treatment that has not been approached to this point.  Preliminary da ta 
from John By[CONTACT_26752]’s laboratory demonstrate that idelalisib  can diminish expression of many of 
these immunosuppressive cytokines and ligands in vitro. As part of this proposal he will test the 
ability of the BCR signaling antagonist molecule idelalisib  to diminish these cytokines and 
improve innate immune therapy. 
f) Autoimmune toxicity:  The early phases of this study have identified a rap id transaminitis 
sometimes wit h fever or pneumonitis, and a later colitis, in a pattern very reminiscent of that 
seen in mice and humans with genetic defects in T regulatory cells.   In this study we are 
therefore going to investigate the changes in T regulatory cells that occur i n pati ents during 
idelalisib therapy, and attempt to identify findings that correlate with toxicity.  This is still 
possible as samples have already been banked on the patients previously enrolled. 
 
g) CLL subclonal composition and evolution, with outgrowth of r esistance.  The last several 
years have seen an explosion of genomic information in CLL, including the identific ation of 
SF3B1 and NOTCH1 as recurrently mutated in CLL[42-44] and the proposal that subclonal  
driver mutations are associated with shorter time to treatment and shorter o verall survival, both 
results from our group at DFCI[45].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_95053], very little is known about  the 
subclonal architecture over time in CLL and between compartments, including periph eral blood 
and bone marrow.   In particular, nothing is yet known about whether the redistribution 
lymphocytosis[46-48] associated with BCR inhibitors like idelalisib and ibrutinib cha nges the 
clonal architecture of the disease in the blood.  Some studies ha ve been initiated with ibrutinib 
but to date no studies have been initiated with idelalisib.  Furthermore, nothing is yet known 
about the genetic characteristics of the residual or persistent disease i n blood and bone marrow 
after treatment with BCR inhibi tors, and whether this residual disease eventually gives rise to the 
relapse clone.  We will therefore perform exome sequencing on selected patient s at baseline and 
after idelalisib therapy in order to assess chan ges in subclonal architecture, and will subsequently 
collect relapsed samples for comparison purposes. Similarly these studies will still be done as 
samples have already been banked.

4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
   
4.1 General Guidelines for DF/HCC and DF/PCC Institutions  
 
Institutions will register eligible participants with the DF/HCC Quality Assurance Office for 
Clinical Trials (QACT) central registration system . Registration must oc cur prior to the 
initiation of therapy. Any participant not registered to the protocol before treatment begins 
will be considered ineligible and registration will be denied. All subjects should also be 
registered to the CLL Research Consortium tissue bank but this enrollment wil l be through a 
separate protocol at each institution.  
 
An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will comple te the 
QACT protocol- specific eligibility checklist.  Following registration, particip ants may begin 
protocol treatment. Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed wi th the 
Overall Principal Investigator (PI). If a participant does not receive any protocol therapy 
following registration, the participant’s registration on t he study may be canceled. Notify the 
QACT Registrar of registration cancellations as soon as possible.  
 
4.2 Registration Process  for DF/HCC and DF/PCC Institutions  
 
The QACT registration staff is accessible on Monday through Friday,  from 8:00 AM to 5:[ADDRESS_1281673] registration line at 617 -632-3761 and follow the instructions 
for registering participants after hours.  
   
The registration procedures are as follows:  
 
1. Obtain written informed consent from the participant prior to the perfor mance of any 
study related procedures or assessments . 
 
2. Complete the  QACT  protocol -specific eligibility checklist using the eligibility 
assessment documented in the participant’s medical  record and/or research chart . To be 
eligible for registration to the protocol , the participant must meet all inclusion and 
exclusion criteri on as described in the protocol and reflected on the eligibility 
checklist.  
  
Reminder:  Confirm eligibility for ancillary studies at the same time as eligibility for the  
treatment study.  Registration to both treatment and ancillary studies will not be 
completed if eligibility requirements are not met for all studies.

 If an infusion reaction develops, the infusion should be temporarily slowed or interrupted. Upon 
restart, the infusion rate should be half of the infusion rate at the time the infusion wa s paused. If, 
however, the infusion rate was 12 mL/hour before the pause, the infusion should be restarted at  
12 mL/hour. Thereafter, the infusion rate may be increased according to the judgment of  the 
investigator, in the manner described in this section. If the infusion is not completed on da y 1, 
the remaining infusion may be completed on day [ADDRESS_1281682] infusion of 1000 mg ofatumumab (1 mg/mL) should be 12 mL/h. If no

Subsequent Infusions of 1000 mg Ofatumumab 
If the previous infusion has been completed without grade ≥ 3 infusion -associated AE s, the 
subsequent infusion of the 1000 mg ofatumumab (1 mg/mL) can start at a rate of 25 mL/hour 
and should be doubled every 30 minutes up to a maximum of 400 mL/h, according to Table 4. 
Duration of the infusion will be approximately 4 hours if this schedule is followed. If  the 
previous infusion has been completed with grade ≥ 3 infusion -associated AEs, the subsequent 
infusion should start at a rate of 12 mL/hour according to Table 3 for CLL.

During infusion the participant  should be monitored closely and appropriate measurements 
should be performed whenever ju dged necessary.   If the ofatumumab dose cannot be completed 
on day 1 in clinic, the remaining dose may be completed the following day with the sa me 
premedications. If the infusion is not completed on day 1, the remaining infusion may be  
completed on day 2 at the starting infusion rate used on day 1. 
 
5.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
To the extent possible, administration of any prescription or over- the-counter drug products other 
than study medication should be minimized during the study period.  Participant s should be 
discouraged from use of recreational  drugs, herbal remedies, self -prescribed drugs, tobacco 
products, Tylenol or excessive alcohol at any time during the clinical study.   
If considered necessary for the participa nt’s well -being, drugs for concomitant medical 
conditions or for symptom management may be given at the discretion of the investigato r.  The 
decision to authorize the use of any drug other than study drug should take into account 
participant  safety, the me dical need, the potential for drug interactions, the possibility for 
masking symptoms of a more significant underlying event, and whether use of the drug  will 
compromise the outcome or integrity of the study   
Participant s should be instructed about the importance of the need to inform the clinic staff of the 
use of any drugs or remedies (whether prescribed, over-the-counter, or illic it) before and during 
the course of the study.  Any concomitant drugs taken by a participant  during the course of the 
study a nd the reason for use should be recorded on the CRFs.   
Information regarding use or restrictions on specific concomitant medications , dietary measures, 
or other interventions is provided below. 
5.3.1 Antiemetics  
 
Nausea and/or vomiting have not been commonly observed with ofatumumab in prior studies.  
However, participant s who experience nausea or vomiting while on study therapy may receive 
antiemetics based on the judgment of the treating physician and local institutiona l practices.  At 
the occurrence of persistent nausea or vomiting of severity grade ≥ 1, it is suggested that the 
participant  receive an oral or transdermal serotonin antagonist (eg, dolasetron, granisetron, 
ondansetron, tropi[INVESTIGATOR_14960], palonosetron).  The neurokinin receptor antagonist, aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], may be 
considered but is a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4 and so may modestly increase idelalisib  plasma 
exposures.  Other classes of antiemetic medications that may be employed inc lude dopamine 
antagonists or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].  If possible, systemic corticosteroids should be avoide d other 
than as premedication for ofatumumab.

 Subjects initiating each study drug  should be given allopurinol 300 mg daily for approximately 10 
days unless contra -indicated, and tumor lysis laboratory testing should be done at the discretion of 
the treating investigator.  Allopurinol therapy should continue through ofatumumab therapy. If 
allopurinol is contra -indicated another uric acid reducing agent may be substituted or alter native 
plans may be discussed with the overall principal investigator. Intravenous fluid prophylaxis may 
also be given at the discretion of the treating investigator  and is recommended at the time of 
initiating therapy  with both idelalisib  and again with ofatumumab initiation at cycle 3 d ay 1.  
  
5.3.3 Granulocyte Colony -Stimulating Factors and Erythropoietin  
 
Granulocyte-macrophage colony- stimulating factor (GM -CSF) should not be administered given 
the potential for GM- CSF-related inflammatory symptoms.  Granulocyte colony- stimulating 
factor (G -CSF) agents  including pegfilgrastim if desired  and erythropoietic agents (eg, 
erythropoietin or darbepoetin) may be administered in response to Grade ≥3 neutropeni a or 
anemia, respectively.  Such use should be particularly considered if providing hemat opoietic 
support might help to maintain idelalisib -ofatumumab therapy.  Reference should be made to the 
American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines  [49, 50].

unless she has had a hysterectomy, a bilateral tubal ligation, or a bilateral oophor ectomy; has 
medically documented ovarian failure (with se rum estradiol and FSH levels within the 
institutional postmenopausal range and a negative serum or urine βHCG); or is menopausal (age 
≥55 years with amenorrhea for ≥6 months). 
 
Sexually active females of child -bearing potential must accept continuous heter osexual 
abstinence as a lifestyle choice or agree to use a protocol -recommended method of contraception 
during heterosexual intercourse throughout the study treatment period and for [ADDRESS_1281684] dose of ofatumumab (whichever is late r). The 
investigator should counsel subjects on the most effective methods for avoiding pregnancy 
during the trial. Protocol-recommended contraceptive methods are described in table below .

Sexually active male subjects who can father a child must  accept continuous heterosexual 
abstinence as a lifestyle ch oice; limit intercourse to female partn ers who are surgically sterile, 
post-menopausal, or using effective contraception (as noted in table above); or agree to use a 
protocol-recommended method of contraception during heterosexual intercourse throughout  the 
study treatment period and for 90 days following discontinuation of idelalisib (as not ed in table

5.3.7 Immunization  
 
Because of its actions to inhibit PI3Kδ -dependent B -cell function, high doses of idelalisib  can 
impair primary or secondary responses to immunization in animals.  The specific clinical 
relevance of these nonclinical findings is unknown.  However, for participants who are at 
substantial risk of an infection (eg, influenza) that may be prevented by [CONTACT_912231], 
consideration should be given to providing the vaccine prior to initiation of treatment wit h 
idelalisib  if at all possible, and if not, then vaccination should be provided during idelalisib  
therapy .

6. EXPECTED TOXICITIES AND DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
Dose delays and modifications will be made using the following recommendations. Toxic ity 
assessments  for non- hematologic toxicity  will be done using the CTEP Version 4.0 of the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) which is identified and located on 
the CTEP website at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.  Hematologic 
toxicity will be evalu ated according to the IWCLL 2008 guidelines as outlined below and in 
Appendix C.   
 
If possible, symptoms should be managed symptomatically. In the case of toxici ty, appropriate 
medical treatment should be used (including anti- emetics, anti -diarrheals, etc .). 
 
IDELALISIB + Ofa

study appear below and will determine wheth er dose delays and modifications will be made or 
whether the event requires expedited reporting in addition to routine reporting. 
 
Please note that if one study drug is held, the other will also be held.  If drugs are  held for more

Symptomatic adverse events are  infrequent, usually low-grade, and not clearly idelalisib -related .  
Among Grade ≥3 nonhematological adverse events  occurring in ≥5% of patients, pneumonia was 
observed most frequently, occurring in 24% of patients with CLL.  In most instances, the se cases  
were  considered bacterial in origin, based either on culture results or on response to c onventional 
antibiotics ; [ADDRESS_1281691] had pneumocystis pneumonia.  The observed rate of 
pneumonia of any type in patients with CLL receiving idelalisib  over 360 patient -months of 
observation has been 0.04 pneumonias/patient/month; this rate is modestly less than the rate of 
0.06 pneumonias/patient/month reported in the literature for a comparable population of CL L 
patients [9].  There have howe ver also been a few cases of what appears to be a steroid -
responsive idelalisib -related pneumonitis.  Other nonhematological adverse events in patients 
with CLL  have included diarrhea (4%), and fatigue (4%).  Grade ≥ 3 hematological laboratory 
abnormalitie s include neutropenia (8%), thrombocytopenia (4%), anemia (2%) and neutropenic 
fever (7%).   
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_1281692](s) for Ofatumumab  
 
The primary adverse event associated with ofatumumab is infusion rea ctions during drug 
administration.  The management of tho se is discussed under drug administration.  Other potential 
concerns include LFT abnormalities, hepatitis B reactivation, and PML , which has been observed 
with another CD20 antibody, rituximab.  
 
6.2 Toxicity Management 
 
Patients should be followed closely for adverse events or laboratory abnormalities that might 
indicate idelalisib  or ofatumumab- related toxicity.  Recommendations for idelalisib  dose 
modification and when to hold and restart drug are provided below.  If a patient experiences a 
idelalisib -relate d adverse event requiring dose modification during the course of idelalisib  
therapy, then study drug administration should be held, as necessary, until the adverse  event 
resolves or stabilizes to an acceptable degree.  Thereafter, idelalisib  may be reinsti tuted, but the

 dose of idelalisib  should be reduced by 1 dose level (except for hematologic toxicity or grade 3 
infections or grade 3 asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities , when dose may potentially be 
maintained  at the investigator’s discretion ); dose adj ustments may be made .  If the patient cannot 
tolerate idelalisib  at Dose  Level  -1 (100 mg/dose BID) then the patient should be discontinued 
from study drug therapy.  
After a dose is reduced, the dose need not be re- escalated, even if there is minimal or no toxicity 
with the reduced dose.  However, if the patient tolerates a reduced dose of idelalisib  for 
≥4 weeks then the idelalisib  dose may be increased to the next higher dose level, at the discretion 
of the investigator.  Such re- escalation may be particularly warranted if further evaluation reveals 
that the adverse event that led to the dose reduction was not study drug- related.  Successive 
adjustments to progressively higher dose levels can be made at 4- week intervals.  The starting 
dose level (150 mg BID ) should not be exceeded.  
Except as specified below for hematologic and liver toxicity, in most cases o f adverse events 
both study drugs will be held until resolution. 
                                                                Table 5

Management of Hepatic Adverse Events  in Patients on or soon after discontinuation of 
Idelalisib  
Based on Phase [ADDRESS_1281693] included pneumonias, rash, and colitis/diarrhea.  Hepatic laboratory 
abnormalities deserve particular attention and reversible Grade  ≥3 ALT/AST elevations  were seen in 
patients and attributed to idelalisib .  Onset has generally occurred 2 to 8  weeks after idelalisib  
initiation and resolution has usually been seen 2 to 6 weeks after idelalisib  interruption.  After 
resolu tion of ALT/AST changes, the majority of the patients who were rechallenged at the same 
or a reduced dose of idelalisib  were  able to resume treatment without recurrence of transaminase 
elevations.  Only 1 (0.9%) patient has had an elevation in bilirubin to >2 times the upper limit of 
normal; because of a recent history of biliary obstruction requiring endoscopic re trograde 
cholangiopancreatography for biliary and common bile duct stone removal, a caus al relationship 
to idelalisib  could not be established. 
In the initial phase of this study, grade 1-[ADDRESS_1281694] been seen beginnin g in week 3.  
Given the rapid rate of rise seen in two patients, a comprehensive metabolic panel ( electrolytes, 
BUN, creatinine, glucose, LDH, phosphate, uric acid, LFTs (to tal bilirubin,  direct bilirubin , AST, 
ALT, alkaline phosphatase)  will be obtained twice per week starting in week 3  and continuing up 
through week 16 in the absence of LFT abnormalities.  
 
IDELALISIB + Ofa  
November 1, [ADDRESS_1281695] or AL T elevations are noted  (very slight elevation of 1 to 5 points 
above normal may be repeated within 3 -4 days prior to initiating management as follows), 
dosing may continue with ongoing at least twice per week monitoring of levels  and initiation of 
prednisone [ADDRESS_1281696], idelalisib will 
be held  and prednisone will either be started or increased to 1 mg/kg daily, rounded up to the 
nearest multiple of [ADDRESS_1281697] or total bilirubin is elevated (grade 2 or higher) and not due to 
an obvious unrelated cause such as  hemolysis or gilbert's syndrome, drug should be held.  
Monitoring will continue twice weekly until LFTs trend towards normalizing, at w hich point labs 
may switch to once weekly, based on conver sation between the treating investigator and the 
overall PI. The labs on non-protocol specified treatment days may be obtained locally at the 
discretion of the site -responsible investigator but must be followed up the same day by [CONTACT_31390].  For patie nts with a grade 2-[ADDRESS_1281698] or ALT to normal 
(grade 0), consideration may be given to resuming idelalisib at a one dose level  reduction, at [ADDRESS_1281699] / ALT remain within normal limits, prednisone  may be tapered 
at a recommended rate of [ADDRESS_1281700]/ALT elevations  typi[INVESTIGATOR_912189] 3- 4.  If twice weekly monitoring shows stability at this level, , as either a n 
initial event or a subsequent event, initiation of prednisone and holding idelalisib will be  
discretionary if LFTs remain less than grade [ADDRESS_1281701] / ALT go back up to grade 1, idelalisib and prednisone may be continued at current  level 
or prednisone may be resumed or increased to 40 mg daily at the discretion of the treating 
investigator and PI, but if they rise to grade 3 or higher, follow above recommendations  for grad e 
2 or above (i.e. hold idelalisib and increase steroids back to 1 mg/kg).  Monitoring will continue 
twice weekly  until LFTs trend towards normalizing, at which point labs may switch to once 
weekly, based on conversation between the treating investigator and the overall PI . These 
additional labs should be continued at least twelve weeks after resuming study dru g. The labs on

 non-protocol specified treatment days may be obtained locally at the discretion of the  site-
responsible investigator.   
Alternative ma nagement plans for hepatotoxicity may be acceptable with prior approval of the 
overall PI, except in cases of fulminant grade 3/[ADDRESS_1281702]/ALT elevations at this point 
in the study, as either an initial event or a subsequent event.  Therefore initiati on of prednisone 
and holding idelalisib will be discretionary if LFTs remain less than grade 3.  O n initial 
observation of this finding, LFTs must b e repeated twice per week for at least 2 and up to 4 
weeks  or an alternative monitoring plan should be discussed with the overall principal 
investigator . Very slight elevations (approximately 1 -5 points) may not necessitate repeat labs in 
the absence of cl inical symptoms.  If at any point either AST or ALT reaches grade [ADDRESS_1281703] be held and LFTs re-checked within 2- 3 days ; prednisone may be started at the discretion 
of the treating investigator . If either AST or ALT is greater than [ADDRESS_1281704] be sta rted at 
1mg/kg and LFTs must be checked twice per week until resolution to grade 0, at which ti me 
Idelalisib may be resumed. If Idelalisib is resumed pre dnisone should be continued at current 
dose for at least one week prior to beginning taper as described above. All subjects w ill continue 
with at least weekly LFTs for up to [ADDRESS_1281705] remained stable grade 1 or within normal limits, the 
frequency of LFT checks may decrease to every 2 -4 weeks at the discretion of the treating 
investigator with communication with the overall PI. Some variation in these guidelin es may be 
considered  upon consultation of the treating investigator with the overall PI.  
Ofatumumab has also been associated with LFT abnormalities.  Of particular c oncern in this 
context is the possibility of reactivated or new hepatitis.  In particular, patients enrolled on study 
who had HBcAb positive with HBsAg negative may be at (low) risk for reactivation.  F or that 
reason, those patients were screened prior to enrollment for HBV DNA and requir ed to be 
negative.   If such a  patient develops any even grade [ADDRESS_1281706] dose.  If the subjects’ HBV DNA 
becomes positive during the study, the investigator should manage the clinical s ituation as per 
the standard of care of that institution,  likely including holding drug and instituting antiviral 
therapy . Also,  if a subject’s HBV DNA becomes positive during the study, notify [COMPANY_001]  
(contact [CONTACT_912233] 11.4.1). The risks and benefits of continuing or discontinuing 
ofatumumab should be discussed with the overall PI  [INVESTIGATOR_912190].  Subjects initiated on antiviral therapy who achieve suppressi on of their HBV 
DNA viral load may be eligible to continue on the study at the di scretion of the treating 
investigator and the overall PI. 
  
IDELALISIB + Ofa  
November 1, [ADDRESS_1281707] grade 2 elevations in ALT/AST and in bilirubin (only  if direct), 
drug should be held as noted above, and they should undergo the further workup below as well 
as the monitoring discussed above .  These patients will have ofatumumab held as well as 
idelalisib, until resolution .  Further workup is particularly warranted in patients who first 
experience a serum ALT/AST elevation [ADDRESS_1281708] an 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_912191].   Further workup may include: obtaining a history of 
recent symptoms/illnesses and of relevant past histor y (eg, history of hepatitis or of hepatitis A or 
hepatitis B vaccination); obtaining information regarding concomitant drug use (prescription and 
nonprescription medications, dietary supplements, alcohol, illicit drugs, special di ets); 
questioning the patient regarding potential exposure to environmental toxins; ruling out  viral 
hepatitis A, B, C, D (if hepatitis B is positive), and E, Epstein -Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, 
autoimmune hepatitis, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and Type 1 anti- liver kidney micros omal 
antibodies, alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hypoxic/ischemic  hepatopathy, and 
biliary tract disease; obtaining additional tests to evaluate liver function (eg, imagin g as 
appropriate, and prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] , 
international normalized ratio  [INR], albumin); and considering gastroenterology or hepatology 
consultation [FDA 2009] 
PML  
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a viral-induced demyeli nating disease of 
the central ne rvous system usually occurring in the immunocompromised individual. JC virus 
infection resulting in PML and death has been reported in rituximab- treated subjects with 
hematologic malignancies or with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an ind ication for wh ich 
rituximab  has not been approved. In the literature, PML has been reported to occur in 0.52% of 
CLL subjects and in approximately 5% of fludarabine- treated B -CLL subjects. One case of PML 
was reported in a very ill CLL subject treated with ofatumumab, p reviously treated with 
alemtuzumab and fludarabine and with very low CD4 cell count. 
Investigators and nurses should pay careful attention for signs and symptoms consi stent with a 
diagnosis of PML. Signs and symptoms of PML include visual disturbances, ocular movement s, 
ataxia, and changes in mental status such as disorientation or confusion.  These symptom s are 
not an exhaustive list and the investigator should exercise judgment in deciding to repor t signs 
and symptoms to the overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_912192].  Please see Appendix D for a symptom 
screening questionnaire.  
 
If a subject develops neurological signs or symptoms consistent with PML tre atment should be 
halted and the subject referred to a neurologist for evaluation.  The investigator w ill contact [CONTACT_912234] 24 hours of being notified of a participant’s potential signs and sympt oms of 
PML.  At a minimum, blood JCV PCR and/or MRI will be performed and if either is positive 
perform Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_17106] (CSF) JCV PCR. If blood JCV PCR and MRI are negative, the 
investigator will contact [CONTACT_912235]. If blood JCV PCR 
and/or MRI are positive, the subject should proceed to the Follow-Up Period. All such subjec ts 
will be followed until resolution.  Any subject wit h a diagnosis of PML will be withdrawn from 
ofatumumab. There are no known tests that can reliably determine who is at increased risk for

FISH will be determined on either peripheral bloo d or bone marrow for the common CLL probes 
(17p, 11q, +12, 13q and t(11;14) to rule out mantle cell lymphoma) at the local institutions  prior to 
enrollment, and this report will be supplied to the Coordinating Center at the time of Registration.  
IGHV, CD3 8 and ZAP70 will be determined by [CONTACT_912239] e bank .  
All participating CLL Research Consortium sites are required to enroll participants on the above 
tissue bank, using the dedicated consent form for that study at each ins titution.  Patients already 
enrolled in the CLL Research Consortium central tissue bank need to provide the  results of these 
tests to the Coordinating Center at the time of registration.   
At screening for this study three additional sodium heparin green top tubes of peripheral blood will 
be submitted  to the Tissue Bank for banking if a patient is already enrolled in the CL L Research

8.2.2 DFCI  Studies : Genomic  Profiling  
Four 10 cc sodium heparin (green top)  tubes of peripheral blood will be drawn at screening, and 
saliva will be collected using Oragene collection devices.  Heparinized bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (5 -10 
cc) should be sent in addition.   
At the time that  patients come off study for toxicity or progressive disease, four 10 c c sodium 
heparin (green top)  tubes of peripheral blood should again be drawn and shipped overnight at 
ambient  as below.   If a patient coming off study due to  progressive disease or tox icity is 
undergoing a bone marrow biopsy, and in particular if they do not have signific ant circulating 
disease, please also send heparinized bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (5 -10 cc).    
These samples will then be shipped overnight to  [CONTACT_912271] at the above  CRC

From the blood samples, PBMCs or CLL B -cells will be isolated and viably frozen, for 
subsequent use in SNP array, gene expression, miRNA profiling  and whole exome sequencing .  
Saliva will be isolated and stored according to the kit directions until DNA is prepared. 
8.2.3 DFCI Studies:  Elucidation of subclonal architecture of CLL treated with idelalisib  
 
The goal of this correlative study  is to elucidate the dynamics of CLL subclones during therapy 
with idelalisib, in particular by [CONTACT_912241].  We will also look at the acute alteration in the subc lonal 
architecture in blood after several weeks of idelalisib, in order to explore th e effect of 
redistr ibution lymphocytosis on the clones present in blood.  We will then compare these results 
IDELALISIB + Ofa  
November 1, [ADDRESS_1281733] that these data will greatly enhance our unde rstanding of 
the relationship of CLL cells in blood and bone marrow and how that changes with idelalisib 
therapy, as well as giving us critical information on both primary and acquired re sistance to 
idelalisib.  
 
Experimental Procedures :   We propose to perform serial exome sequencing (WES) on a 
select ion of patients from this  trial, selected to represent the range of CLL prognostic factors and 
a range of initial idelalisib responses.  We will include roughly half IGHV  mutated and 
unmutated patients, and half those who had stable disease (SD) after 2 months of singl e agent 
idelalisib vs those with partial response (PR) or partial response with lympho cytosis (PRL) after 
two months of therapy.   Relatively few patients on this study have high risk del 11q or de l 17p 
cytogenetics but we will prioritize thos e patients for analysis (n=3).  The plan will be to perform 
WES on baseline blood, bone marrow and germline (saliva) samples, on blood and bone marrow 
from end of single agent cycle [ADDRESS_1281734] aging at 
cycle 10 .  These samples will allow determination of the relative distribution of clones i n blood 
and bone marrow at the same timepoint, how this is altered by [CONTACT_912216], and ultimately  which 
clone(s) persist at the time of low level residual disease.  In additio n we will sequence peripheral 
blood at one additional timepoint, week 2- [ADDRESS_1281735] t wo 10cc sodium heparin green top tubes :

8.2.5 OSU Studies : Assessments of intrinsic innate immune suppression  
These correlative studies propose to confirm that idelalisib  can decrease immunosuppressive 
cytokines (IL -6, IL -10, TGF -β1, and T GF-β2) in vivo in CLL patients from pre -treatment to day 
29.  Additionally, we will demonstrate by [CONTACT_912242] -treatment and 
day [ADDRESS_1281736] less production of IL -6, IL -10 and also 
expression of CD279 and CD274.  Finally, we will  assess screening  and day 29 monocyte TNF -α 
production using ofatumumab; NK cell production of IFN -γ  and CD107a expression fol lowing 
exposure to immobilized ofatumumab and ofatumumab mediated ADCC against RAJI t arget cells; 
MDSC ex vivo  and inhibition of T -cell proliferat ion.  We  expect this work to demonstrate that 
idelalisib  treatment will inhibit evoked activation of IL -6, IL -10, CD279 and CD274 with innate 
immune function at day 29 of therapy as compared to pre -treatment. Collectively, this will provide 
support for ide lalisib  priming prior to administration of therapeutic antibodies .  
For these studies, three 8.5mL ACD (yellow top) tubes and one sodium  heparin (green top) tube of 
peripheral blood should be collected at screening, Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1  and cycle 3  day 1 
of therapy (prior to ofatumumab)   
 
These blood tubes will be shipped overnight ( ambient ) to Laura Rassenti at the CLL Research 
Consortium address above.  
8.2.6 OSU Studies : Effects of in vivo inhibition of the PI3K delta pathway on CLL cell 
signaling  
 
Detailed baseline profiling of tumor cells will be done for expression of PI3K isofor ms and 
activity of downstream B- cell relevant specific kinases targeted by [CONTACT_976]3 K. In vivo response to 
PI3K inhibition will be evaluated by [CONTACT_912243] 3- beta in 
CLL cells isolated from two  pre-dose 8.5mL ACD (yellow top) tubes of peripheral blood at cycle 
1 day 1, day 15, cycle 2 day 1 and two month restaging on  idelalisib  treatment.  During 
 treatment ex vivo response to chemoimmunotherapy wi ll be evaluated by [CONTACT_912244] 
(Annexin V/PI [INVESTIGATOR_358646]) at the same intervals.  
 
These tubes should be sent to the CLL Research Consortium Tissue Bank at the above addre ss,

study, which will not be considered evidence of progressive disease.  In fact, an isolated increase 
in lymphocytosis, in the absence of other signs of disease progression including wor sening 
lymphadenopathy, neutropen ia, anemia or thrombocytopenia or disease symptoms, will not in 
this study be sufficient to define progressive disease.  This modification to the  standard criteria is 
needed because idelalisib  can cause redistribution of CLL lymphocytes from sanctuary sites into 
peripheral blood, in the absence of progressive disease.    
10.1.1  Complete remission (CR)  
CR requires all of the following criteria present at one time point and still present when re-
assessed at least 2 months after initial documentation : 
 Peripheral bloo d lymphocytes (evaluated by [CONTACT_26850]) below 4 × 
109/L (4000/μL).  
 Absence of significant lymphadenopathy (eg, lymph nodes >1.5 cm in diameter) by 
[CONTACT_5292].  A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, pelvis will be used to confirm 
complete response if previously abnormal, and on that CT, lymph nodes should not be 
larger than 1.5 cm in long axis diameter.  
 No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly by [CONTACT_5292].   
 Absence of constitutional symptoms.  
 Blood counts above the following valu es: 
 Neutrophils more than 1500/μL without need for exogenous growth factors.  
 Platelets more than 100  000/μL without need for exogenous growth factors.  
 Hemoglobin more than 11.0 g/dL without red blood cell transfusion or need for 
 exogenous erythropoietin. 
 For patients on this study meeting the above criteria for CR, a marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_20325] e and 
biopsy must confirm CR .   To define a CR, the marrow sample must be at least 
normocellular for age, with less than 30% of nucleated cells being lymphocytes. 
Lymphoid nodules should be absent.  In some cases, lymphoid nodules can be found, 
which often reflect residual disease.55,56 These nodules should be recorded as “nodular 
PR.” Moreover, immunohistochemistry should be performed to define whet her these 
nodules are composed primarily of T cells or lymphocytes other than CLL cells or  of 
CLL cells. If the marrow is hypocellular, a repeat determination should be pe rformed 
after [ADDRESS_1281752] recovered. However, this time 
 .  
IDELALISIB + Ofa  
November 1, [ADDRESS_1281753] by [CONTACT_4133].  
Patients who fulfill all the criteria for a  CR (in cluding the marrow examinations described 
above) but who have a persistent anemia or thrombocytopenia or neutropenia appar ently 
unrelated to CLL but related to drug toxicity will be considered  CR with incomplete 
marrow recovery (CRi). For the definition of this category, CRi, the marrow evaluation should 
be performed with scrutiny and not show  any clonal infiltrate.  
10.1.2  Partial remission (PR)  
PR is defined by [CONTACT_912247], as well as one or more 
of the blood count requirements. To define a PR, these parameters need to be  documented for  a 
minimal duration of 2 months. 
 
 A decrease in the number of blood lymphocytes by 50% or more from the value 
before therapy.  
 Reduction in lymphadenopathy (by [CONTACT_912248]) as defined by [CONTACT_14504]:  (1)  A decrease in lymph node size by 50% or more either in the sum of the 
bidimensional products of up to [ADDRESS_1281754] diameter of the enlarged 
lymph node(s) detected prior to therapy AND (2)  No increase in any lymph node, and no 
new enlarged lymph node. In small lymph nodes (< 2 cm), an increase of less than 25% is 
not considered to be significant.   
 A reduction in the noted pretreatment enlargement of the spleen or liver by 50% or 
more on physi cal examination.  
 The blood count should show one of the following results:  (1) Neutrophils more than 
1.5 × 109/L (1500/μL) without need for exogenous growth factors.  (2)  Platelet counts 
greater than 100 × 109/L (100  000/μL) or 50% improvement over base line without need 
for exogenous growth factors.   (3)  Hemoglobin greater than 110 g/L (11.0 g/dL) or 50% 
improvement over baseline without requiring red blood cell transfusions or exogenous 
erythropoietin.   
10.1.[ADDRESS_1281755] one of  the  following: 
 Lymphadenopathy.  Progression of lymphadenopathy is often discovered by [CONTACT_912249]. In CLL, the use of CT scans usually does not add 
much information for the detection of progression or relapse. Therefore, the use of 
imaging methods to follow CLL progression is at the discretion of the treating phy sician.  
 Disease progression occurs if one of the following events is observed:  (1) Appearance of 
any new lesio n, such as enlarged lymph nodes (>1.5 cm),  splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, 
or other organ infiltrates.  (2)  An increase by 50% or more in greatest determined 
diameter of any previous site. (3) An increase in  the previously noted enlargement of the 
liver or s pleen by 50% or more or the de novo appearance of hepatomegaly or 
splenomegaly.

  Transformation to a more aggressive histology (eg, Richter syndrome). Whenever 
possible, this diagnosis should be established by [CONTACT_37409].  
 Occurrence of cytopenia (n eutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia) attributable 
to CLL.  
  During therapy.  Cytopenias may occur as a side effect of many therapi[INVESTIGATOR_912204] C.  
  After treatment.  The progression of any cytopenia (unrelated to autoimmune 
 cytopenia), as documented by a decrease of Hb levels by [CONTACT_726] 20 g/L (2 g/dL ) or 
 to less than 100 g/L (10 g/dL), or by a decrease of platelet counts by [CONTACT_726] 50% or  
 to less than 100 × 109/L (100  000/μL), which occurs at least 3 months after treatment, 
 defines disease progression, if the marrow biopsy demonstrates an infiltrat e of clonal 
 CLL cells  and there is no evidence for an autoimmune process.  
10.1.4  Nodal Partial Response with Lymphocytosis  
In this study, patients who achieve PR criteria for lymphadenopathy and/or splenome galy, but 
have a lymphocyte count which is elevated and/or does not meet PR criteria (and may be  
significantly above baseline), will be considered to have nodal PR with lymphocy tosis.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_1281756] stable disease (which  is equivalent to a 
nonresponse).   
10.1.6  Treatment failure  
Responses that should be considered clini cally beneficial include CR, PR and nodal PR with 
lymphocytosis; all others (eg, stable disease, nonresponse, progressive disease, o r death from any 
cause) should be rated as a treatment failure.  
10.1.7  Time to progression, progressio n-free survival, and overall survival  
Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time from study entry until objective  disease 
progression (see above).  Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time  from study entry 
until objective disease progression or death. Overall survival is defined as the time from study 
entry until death from any cause, and is measured in the intent- to-treat population.  
10.1.8  Relapse  
Relapse is defined as a patient who has previously achieved the above criteria of  a CR or PR  or 
nodal response with lymphocytosis, but after a period of 6 or more months, demonstrates 
evidence of disease progression as described above.  
10.1.9  Refractory disease  
IDELALISIB + Ofa  
November 1, [ADDRESS_1281757]. Either 4 -color flow cytometry (MRD flow) or allele -specific oligonucleotide 
PCR is reliably sensitive down t o a level of approximately one CLL cell in [ADDRESS_1281758] flow.   
10.2  Duration of Response 
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first record ed) until the first date that 
recurrence or PD is objectiv ely documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
Duration of clinical benefit: The duration of clinical benefit  is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR , PR or nodal PR with lymphocytosis,  until the 
first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of overall complete response: The duration of overall CR is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurr ent disease is 
objectively documented. 
Duration of stable disease : Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since 
the treatment started  
10.[ADDRESS_1281759] scans is required for all scans (  screening , cycle 2  day 22, cycle

 11. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
11.1  Definitions  
11.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An adverse event (AE) is  any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or experience that 
develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatm ent or any procedure 
specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the stu dy.  
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse event s only if they 
induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tes ts.  
11.1.2  Serious adverse event (SAE)  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any advers e event, occurring at any dose and regardless of 
causality that:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the person was at immediate risk of death 
from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypot hetically 
might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at least a  24-hour 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57892]). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the  study 
period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or diseas e 
existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not dete riorate in an 
unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planne d). 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined  as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or 
 Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may 
jeopardize the participant and require medical  or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above. Exam ples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Laboratory and Other Safety Assessment Abnormalities Reported as AEs and  SAEs 
 Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urin alysis) or 
other safety assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs  measurements), 
inclu ding those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs.

  Grade 4 uncomplicated hematologic toxicities that are common in this patient populatio n 
do NOT need to be reported as SAEs or reported to the DFCI IRB, unless resulting in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912205] t.   
 All events requiring patients to come off study due to liver toxicity must be recorded as 
an SAE.  
 However, any clinically significant safety assessments that are associated wit h the 
underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_912250]’s condition, are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs. 
 B cell depletion, lymphopenia, IgG below LLN, low CD19+ count, and 
hypogammaglobulinemia due to treatment with ofatumumab are not to be reported as 
AEs or SAEs.  
 Infusion related AEs may lead to a prolonged infusion time. Overnight stay at t he 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_248233] a SAE.    
 Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must  be reported 
as an AE or SAE.  Spontaneous abortions must be reported as a SAE.  Any SAE 
occurring in association with a pregnancy , brought to the investigator’s attention after the 
subject has completed the study and considered by [CONTACT_912251], must be promptly reported to [COMPANY_001] 
 
Not included as SAEs:  
 routine treatment or mo nitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures 
 elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
 emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling  the serious criteria outlined 
above and not resulting in inpatient admission 
 respi[INVESTIGATOR_912206] -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as SAEs  
An event which is part of the natural course of the disease under study (i.e., diseas e progression) 
does not need to be reported as a SAE.  However, if the progression of the underlying disea se is 
greater than that which would normally be expected for the subject, ends in death, or if the 
investigator considers that there was a causal relat ionship between treatment with investigational 
product or protocol design/procedures and the disease progression, then this must be reported as  
an SAE.  
 
Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation must be reported to the overal l Principa l 
Investigator and to [COMPANY_001].   To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy must be report ed to 
[COMPANY_001] within [ADDRESS_1281761] be foll owed up to 
determine outcome (including premature termination) and status of mother and child.  Pr egnancy 
complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as  an AE or SAE.  
Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE.

 Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy, brought to the investigator ’s attention after 
the subject has completed the study and considered by [CONTACT_912252], must be promptly reported to [COMPANY_001]. 
 
In addition, the investigator must attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female 
partners of male study subjects who become pregnant while the subject is enrolled in the study. 
Pregnancy information must be reported to [COMPANY_001]  as described above.  
11.1.3  Expectedness  
 
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expected adve rse event  
 
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as res ulting from 
administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is cons idered 
expected  when it appears in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure , the 
package insert or is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.    
 
Refer to Section 6.[ADDRESS_1281762] common expected adverse ev ents associated with 
the study agent(s).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unexpected adverse event  
  
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected  when it varies in 
nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current adverse eve nt list, the 
Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is not included in the inform ed consent 
document as a potential risk.   
11.1.4  Attribution  
 
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event  and the study 
treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
 
 Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
 Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study treatment.  
 Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
 Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related  to the study treatment.  
 Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.

 13.5  Multi -center Guidelines  
 
This protocol will adhere to the policies and requirements of the Dana -Farber/Harvard 
Cancer Center . The specific responsibilities of the DF/HCC Overall Prin cipal Investigator 
(or Protocol Chair), Coordinating Center, and Participating Institutions  are presented in the 
Dana -Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Multi -Center Data and Safety  Monitoring Plan (see 
Appendix D ). 
 The DF/HCC Overall Principal Investigator/Coordinating Center is respons ible for 
distributing all IND Action Letters or Safety Reports to all participating institutions for 
submission to their individual IRBs for action as required.  
 Mechanisms will be in place to ensure quality assurance, protocol compliance, and 
adverse event reporting at each site.  
 Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will  order the 
agent(s) directly from the supplier. A participating site may order the agent(s) only 
after the initial IRB  approval for  the site has been forwarded to the Coordinating 
Center.  
14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
Primary Objective:  
 
The primary objective for this phase II study is to estimate the overall r esponse rate or ORR  
(CR+PR)  of ofatumumab and idelalisib  in previously untreated CLL/SLL.   
 
Hypothesis:  
Null: 0.55 ORR  
Alternative: 0.7 5 ORR  
 
Sample size and power calculation:  
 
A two stage design is used to compute the sample size.   A total number of [ADDRESS_1281779] a 7 5% response rate, assuming the ORR for the null 
hypothesis is 55%, with 90% power and 4% type I error.   [ADDRESS_1281780] stage is 0.56 if the 
null hypothesis is true.   For the purposes of the two -stage design and in order to avoid 
potenti al closure to enrollment, we will use the four month response evaluation to decide  
about moving to the second stage.     
 
Primary Analysis:  
 
The overall response rate and a 90% confidence interval will also be calculat ed, using the

 method of Atkinson and Brown for a two stage study.  Patients’ baseline characteristics will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics (median, interquartile ran ge, proportions).    
 
Enrollment was discontinued at 27 patients and ORR will be estimated based on the data, wi th 
90% confidence interval.  
14.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 
Other Secondary Objectives:  
 
 To determine the CR rate and PFS of ofatumumab and idelalisib . 
 To determine the ORR, CR and rate of nodal PR with lymphocytosis for idelalisib gi ven 
alone for 2 months.   
 To assess the safety of ofatumumab and idelalisib  in combination. 
 To determine whether clinical response correlates with known CLL molecular p rognostic 
factors.  
 To determine whether the use of CT scans in response assessment improves the pre dictive 
power of ORR for progression -free or overall survival.  
 To determine whether serum ofatumumab levels in vivo predict response. 
 To assess whether idelalisib  alters the flow cytometric phenotype of circulating CLL cells.  
 To assess whether in vivo treatment with idelalisib alters CLL cell sensitivity to therapy 
with antibodies or other kinase inhibitors 
 To assess pharmacodynamic markers of PI3 kinase inhibition including AKT 
phosphorylation, production of T cell chemokines and response to CXCR 4/5 
 To determine whether response or resistance correlates with genetic alterations in PIK3CA 
or PIK3CD or other genes 
 To assess the clonal dynamics of CLL in peripheral blood vs bone marrow, and during 
therapy with idelalisib.   
 
Secondary Analysis: 
  
The CR rate of combination therapy, ORR rate, and rate of nodal PR with lymphocyt osis for 
idelalisib given alone for [ADDRESS_1281781] one dose of treatment will also be summarized. Associations of clinical  response rate 
and known prognostic factors will be assessed using Fisher’s exact test.  
14.[ADDRESS_1281782] treatment.  
IDELALISIB + Ofa  
November 1, [ADDRESS_1281783] one dose of study therapy will be assessed for response to treatm ent, even if there are 
major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. Each participa nt should be 
assigned one of the following categories: 1) complete response, 2) partial  response,  3) stable 
disease, 4) nodal response with lymphocytosis; 5) progressive disease, 6) early death from 
malignant disease,  7) early death from toxicity, 8) early death because of other cause, or 9) 
unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). By [CONTACT_912258], category 9 usually 
designates the "unknown" status of any type of data in a clinical database.  
15. PUBLICATION PLAN  
 
The overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_912209].  The data may be 
presented at a national or international meeting prior to full publication.  The manusc ript will be 
written within 6 months of study completion and submitted to [COMPANY_009] and [COMPANY_001] for their 
review pr ior to journal submission.

 1.   INTRODUCTION  
 
The Dana -Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Multi -Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
(DF/HCC DSMP) outlines the procedures for a DF/HCC Multi- Center research protocol. The 
DF/HCC DSMP should serve as a reference for any sites external to DF/HCC  that will be 
participating in the research protocol. 
 
1.1 Purpose  
 
To establish standards that will ensure that a Dana -Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) 
Multi -center protocol will comply with Federal regulations, Health Insurance Port ability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements  and applicable DF/HCC Stan dard Operating 
Procedures .        
 
1.2 Multi -Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan Definitions  
 
The Multi-Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan includes the following compone nts: 
 
DF/HCC Multi -center Protocol :  A research protocol in which one or more outsid e institutions 
collaborating with Dana -Farber/Harvard Cancer Center where a DF/HCC investigator is the 
sponsor. DF/HCC includes Dana -Farber/Partners Cancer Care (DF/PCC) Network Clinical Trial 
Affiliates . 
 
Lead Institution: One of the  Dana -Farber/Harvard Cancer Center consortium members (Dana -
Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH), Beth Israel Deaconess 
Medical Center (BIDMC), Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7724] (CHB), Brigham and W omen’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(BWH)) responsible for the coordination, development, submission, and approval of a protocol 
as well as its subsequent amendments per the DFCI IRB and applicable regula tory guidelines 
(Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Biotechnology Activities (O BA) etc.).  The 
Lead Institution is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_143000]/HCC Sponsor. The Lead Institution also 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_143001]/HCC Multi-Center  Protocol.   
 
DF/HCC Sponsor :  The person sponsoring the submitted Multi-Center protocol.  Within 
DF/HCC, this person is the Overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_345893], 
management and conduct of the protocol at all research locations. In applicable protoc ols, the 
DF/HCC Sponsor will serve as the single liaison with any regulatory agenc ies (FDA) . The 
DF/HCC Protocol Chair has ultimate authority over the protocol and is responsible f or the 
conduct of the study at DF/HCC and all Participating Institutions. In most cases  the DF/HCC 
Protocol Chair is the same person as the DF/HCC Principal Investigat or; however, both roles can 
be filled by [CONTACT_57945]. 
 
Participating Institution:  An institution that is outside the DF/HCC and DF/PCC consortium 
that is collaborating with DF/HCC on a protocol where the sponsor is a DF/HCC Inve stigator.

 The par ticipating institution acknowledges the DF/HCC Sponsor as having the ultimate authority 
and responsibility for the overall conduct of the study.    
 
Coordinating Center: The entity (i.e. Lead Institution, Medical Monitor, Contract Research 
Organization (CR O), etc) that  provides the administrative support to the DF/HCC Sponsor in 
order that he/she may fulfill the responsibilities outlined in the protocol document and DSMP , 
and as specified in applicable regulatory guidelines (i.e. CTEP Multi-Cente r Guideline s). In 
general, the Lead Institution is the Coordinating Center for the DF/HCC Multi -Center Protocol. 
Should the DF/HCC Sponsor decide to use a CRO, the CRO will be deemed the Coordinating 
Center.  
 
DF/HCC Quality Assurance Office for Clinical Trials: A unit within DF/HCC developed to 
computerize and manage data, and to provide a Quality Control and Quality Assurance funct ion 
for DF/HCC trials.

 3.2 Protocol Revisions and Closures 
 
The Participating Institutions will receive notification of protocol revisions a nd closures from th e 
Coordinating Center .  It is the individual Participating Institution’s responsibility to notify its 
IRB of these revisions. 
 
 Non life -threatening revisions:  Participating Institutions will receive written notification 
of protocol revisions regarding non life-threatening events from the Coordinating Center. 
Non-life-threatening protocol revisions must be IRB approved and implemented within 90 
days from receipt of the notification. 
 Revisions for life -threatening causes:  Participating Institutions will receive immediate 
notification from the Coordinating Center concerning protocol revisions required to prot ect 
lives with follow -up by [CONTACT_6791], mail, e -mail, etc.  Life -threatening protocol revisions will be 
implemented immediately followed by [CONTACT_912264]. 
 Protocol closures and temporary holds:  Participating Institutions will receive notification 
of protocol closures and temporary holds from the Coordinating Center. Closures and holds 
will be effective immediately.  In addition, the Coordinating Center, will update th e 
Participating Institutions on an ongoing basis about protocol accrual data so that t hey will 
be aware of imminent protocol closures. 
 
3.3 Informed Consent Requirements  
 
The DF/HCC approved informed consent document will serve as a template for the inform ed 
consent for Participating Institutions. The Participating Institution consent f orm must follow the 
consent template as closely as possibl e and should adhere to specifications outlined in the 
DF/HCC Guidance Document on Model Consent Language f or PI -Initiated Multi -Center 
Protocols.  This document will be provided separately to each Participating Insti tution. 
 
Participating Institutions are to send their version of the informed conse nt document and HIPAA 
authorization, if a separate document, to  the Coordinating Center for review and approval prior 
to submission to their local IRB. The approved consent form must also be submitted to t he 
Coordinating Center after approval by [CONTACT_1036]. 
 
The Principal Investigator (PI) at each Participating Ins titution will identify the physician 
members of the study team who w ill be obtaining consent and signing the consent form for 
therapeutic protocols. Participating institutions must follow the DF/HCC requireme nt that only 
attending physicians obtain informed consent and re -consent to interventional trials (i.e. drug 
and/or device trials).

  Approval letter of the Participating Institution's IRB  
 Copy of the Informed Consent Form approved by [CONTACT_57949]’s IRB  
 Participating IRB’s approval for all amendments  
 
It is the Participating Institution's responsibility to notify its IRB of protoco l amendments.  
Participating Institutions will have [ADDRESS_1281790] ( HIPAA). Any information, related to 
the physical or mental health of an individual is called Protected Health Information (PHI). 
HIPAA outlines how and under what circumstances PHI can be used or disclosed.  
 
In order for covered entities to use or disclose protected health informati on during the course of a 
study, the study participant mus t sign an Authorization.  This Authorization may or may not be 
separate from the informed consent document.  The Coordinating Center, with the approval fr om 
the DFCI IRB, will provide a consent template, which covered entities (Partic ipating Institutions) 
must use.  
 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will use all efforts to limit its use of protected health information  in its 
trials.  However, because of the nature of these trials, certain protected health i nformation must 
be collected per NCI requirements. These are the primary reasons why DF/HCC has chosen to 
use Authorizations, signed by [CONTACT_89438], rather than limited data  sets with data 
use agreements.  
 
3.6.1  DF/HCC Multi -Center Protocol Confidentiality  
 
All documents, investigative reports, or informatio n relating to the participant are strictly 
confidential. Whenever reasonably feasible, any participant specific repor ts (i.e. Pathology 
Reports, MRI Reports, Operative Reports, etc.) submitted to the Coordinating Ce nter must have 
the participant’s full nam e & social security number “blacked out” and the assigned DF/HCC 
QACT case number (as described below) and DF/HCC protocol number written in (w ith the

may not be initiated until the Participating Institution receives a faxed or e -mailed copy of the 
participant’s registration confirmation memo from the Coordinating Center. Ther apy must be 
initiated per protocol guidelines.  The DF/HCC Sponsor  and DFCI IRB must be notified of any 
exceptions to this policy. 
 
3.7.3 Eligibility Exceptions  
 
The DF/HCC QACT will make no exceptions to the eligibility requirements for a pr otocol 
without DFCI IRB approval. The DF/HCC QACT requires each institution to fully  comply with 
this requirement.  
 
3.7.4 Verification of Registration, Dose Levels, and Arm Designation  
 
A registration confirmation memo for participants registered to DF/HCC Multi -Center Protocol 
will be faxed or emailed to the registering institution within one business day of  the registration. 
Treatment may not be initiated until the site receives a faxed or e -mailed copy of the registration 
confirmation memo.  
 
3.8 DF/HCC Protocol Case Number  
 
Once eligibility has been established and the participant successfully reg istered, the participant is 
assigned a five digit protocol case number.  This number is unique to the participant on this  trial 
and must be used for QACT CRF/eCRF completion and written on all data and QACT 
correspondence for the participant.

 Federal Regulations require an IRB to review proposed changes in a research acti vity to ensure 
that researchers do not initiate changes in approved research without IRB revie w and approval, 
except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the participant. D F/HCC 
requires all departures from the defined procedures set forth in the IRB a pproved protocol to be 
reported to the DF/HCC Sponsor, who in turn is responsible for reporting to the DFCI IRB. 
  
For reporting purposes, DF/HCC uses the terms “violation”, “deviation” and “exce ption” to 
describe derivations from a protocol. All Participating I nstitutions must adhere to these 
requirements for reporting to the DF/HCC Sponsor and will follow their institutiona l policy for 
reporting to their local IRB.  
 
3.9.1 Definitions  
 
Protocol Deviation: Any departure from the defined procedures set forth in the IRB -approved 
protocol which is prospectively approved  prior to its implementation.  
 
Protocol Exception:  Any protocol devi ation that relates to the eligibility criteria, e.g.  
enrollment of a participant who does not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
   
Protocol Violation : Any protocol deviation that was not prospectively approved  by [CONTACT_912265].   
 
3.9.2  Reporting Procedures  
 
DF/HCC Sponsor:  is responsible for ensuring that clear documentation is available in the 
medical record and/or regulatory documents to describe all protocol exceptions , deviations and 
violations. The DF/HCC Sponsor will also be responsible for ensuring that all protocol  
violations/deviations are promptly reported per DFCI IRB guidelines.  
 
Participating Institutions : Protocol deviations require prospective approval from the DFCI IRB. 
The Participating Institution must submit the deviation request to the Coordinating Center who 
will then submit the deviation request to the DFCI IRB. Upon DFCI IRB approval the d eviation 
is submitted to the Participating Institution IRB, per institutional polic y. A copy of the 
Participatin g Institution’s IRB report and determination will be forwarded to the Coordina ting 
Center within [ADDRESS_1281792] be sent to the Coordinating Center in a timely manner.  
 
Coordinating Center:  Upon receipt of the violation/deviation report from the Participating 
Institution, the Coordinating Center will submit the report to the DF/HCC Sponsor for  review. 
Subsequently, the Participating Institution’s IRB violation/deviation repo rt will be submitte d to 
the DFCI IRB for review per DFCI IRB reporting guidelines.

 3.10  Safety Assessments and Toxicity Monitoring 
 
The study teams at all participating institutions are responsible for protecting the  safety, rights 
and well -being of study participants. Recording and reporting of adverse events that occur duri ng 
the course of a study help ensure the continuing safety of study participants.  
 
All participants receiving investigational agents and/or other protocol manda ted treatment will be 
evaluated for safety.  The safety parameters include all laborato ry tests and hematological 
abnormalities, physical examination findings, and spontaneous reports of adverse event s reported 
by [CONTACT_4317].  All toxicities encountered during the study will be evaluated ac cording  to the 
NCI criteria specified in the proto col. Life -threatening toxicities must be reported immediately to 
the DF/HCC Sponsor via the Coordinating Center.  
 
Additional safety assessments and toxicity monit oring will be outlined in the protocol. 
 
3.10.1  Guideline s for Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
 
Guidelines for reporting Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs ) are detailed 
in protocol section 11.4. 
 
Participating Institutions must report the AEs to the DF/HCC Sponsor and the Coordina ting 
Cente r following the DFCI IRB SAE Reporting Requirements.  
 
The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of all Participating Institution A dverse 
Event reports and be responsible for communicating to all participating investiga tors, any 
observations reportable under the DFCI IRB Reporting Requirements.  Participati ng 
Investigators will review any distributed AE reports, send a copy to their IR B according to their 
local IRB’s policies and procedures, and file a copy with their regulatory  documents. 
 
3.10.2  Guidel ines for Processing IND Safety Reports  
 
FDA regulations require sponsors of clinical studies to notify the FDA a nd all participating 
investigators of any adverse experience associated with the use of the investig ational agent that is 
both serious and unexpected. The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all IND Safety Reports a nd 
ensure that all IND Safety Reports are distributed to the Participating Institu tions.  The 
Participating Institutions  willreview  and submit  to their IRB according to their  institutional  
policies and procedures.

 The DF/HCC QACT develops a set of either paper or electronic case report form s (CRF/eCRFs), 
for use with the protocol.  These forms are designed to collect data for each study. The  DF/HCC 
QACT provides a web based training for eCRF users. 
 
Notations concerning adverse events will address relationship to protocol tre atment for each 
adverse event grade.  All adverse events encountered during the study will be evaluated 
according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria and CL L specific hematologic criteria in 
Appendix C, and all adverse events must be noted on the participant's Adverse Event (Toxici ty) 
Forms.  
   
3.11.1  Data Forms Review  
 
When data forms arrive at the DF/HCC QACT, they are reviewed for complete ness, protocol 
treatment  compliance, adverse events (toxicities) and response. Data submissions are moni tored 
for timeliness and completeness of submission. Participating Institutions are no tified of their data 
submission delinquencies in accordance with the following: 
 
Incomplete or Questionable Data  
If study forms are received with missing or questionable data, the submitting ins titution will 
receive a written or electronic query from the DF/HCC QACT Data Analyst or s tudy monitor.  
Responses to all queries should be completed and submitted within 14 calendar days.  Re sponses 
may be returned on the written query or on an amended paper case report form, or i n the case of 
electronic queries, within the electronic data capture (eDC) system. In the c ase of a written query  
for data submitted on a paper case report form,  the query must be attached to the specific data 
being re-submitted in response.   
 
Missing Forms  
If study forms are not submitted on schedule, the Participating Institution will r eceive a Missing 
Form Report from the Coordinating Center noting the missing forms.  These reports a re 
compi[INVESTIGATOR_163871]/HCC QACT and distributed a minimum of four times a year.  
  
4. REQUISITIONING INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG  
 
See main protocol Section 7.   
 
5. MONITORING: QUALITY CONTROL  
  
The quality control process for a clinical trial requires verification of protoc ol compliance and 
data accuracy. The Coordinating Center, with the aid of the QACT provides quality cont rol 
oversight for the protocol. 
 
IDELALISIB + Ofa  
November 1, [ADDRESS_1281793] on a frequent basis.  Further more, these 
are all tertiary care oncology centers with internal audit mechanisms.  We theref ore anticipate 
that monitoring will be primarily performed through the submission  of source documents to 
DFCI for review  (virtual monitoring)  at critical points in the therapy.   
 
At a minimum, the Coordinating Center, or designee, will monitor each participating site once a 
year while patients are receiving treatment.  Should a Participating Institution be monitored once 
and then not accrue any additional patients , additional monitoring visit s may not be necessary.  
 
Virtual Monitoring:  Participating Institutions will be required to forward copi[INVESTIGATOR_57912]’ 
medical record and source documents to the Coordinating Center upon request for remote 
monitoring purposes. Virtual monitoring  may include, but is not limited to,  review of the 
following: 
1. Eligibility and registration (diagnostic flow cytometry  and when available CT scans, 
bone marrow biopsy and FISH results) 
2. Restaging evaluat ions (end of cycle 2 ( idelalisib alone) , end of cycle 4 (weekly ofa)) 
3. Final restaging evaluation in both arms ( two months after monthly ofa, including 
bone marrow biopsy with MRD analysis  and CT scan)  
4. At tim e of off study for progressive disease  
 
If any issues are identified in the course of virtual monitoring, the participating institution may 
be subject to on-site monitoring conducted by [CONTACT_912266].  
 
On-Site Monitoring:  On-site monitoring visits will be conducted at the  discretion of the 
sponsor- investigator. The need for on -site monitoring  will depend on participant accrual, data 
compliance, virtual monitoring findings, and other factors. Participating Ins titutions will be 
required  to provide access to participants’ complete medical records and source documents fo r 
verification during any on -site monitoring visits. In addition, Participating Institutions should 
provide access to regulatory documents, pharmacy records, local policies  related to the conduct 
of research, and any other trial- related documentation maintained by [CONTACT_16529].

 5.2 Evaluation of Participating Institution Performance 
 
5.2.1 Monitoring Reports  
 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all monitoring reports for on -site and virtual monitoring of 
Participating Institutions to ensure protocol compliance and ability to fulfill r esponsibilities of 
participating in the study. The DF/HCC Sponsor may increase the monitoring ac tivities at 
Participating Institutions that are un able to comply with the protocol, DF/HCC Sponsor 
requirements or federal and local regulations. Participating Institutions ma y also be subject to an 
audit as determined by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Sponsor. 
5.3 Accrual Monitoring  
 
Prior to extending a protocol to an external site, the DF/HCC Sponsor will establish accrual 
requirements for each participating institution. Accrual will be monitored for eac h participating 
institution by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Sponsor or designee. Sites that are not meeting their ac crual 
expectations may be s ubject to termination.  
 
The minimum accrual requirements are 3 -5 patients per site/annually.  
 
6. AUDITING: QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
Auditing is a method of Quality Assurance. Its main focus is to measure whet her standards and 
procedures were followed. Auditing is t he systematic and independent examination of all trial 
related activities and documents.  Audits determine if evaluated activities were ap propriately 
conducted and whether data was generated, recorded and analyzed, and accurately r eported per 
the protocol,  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and the Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR).  
 
6.1 DF/HCC Sponsored Trials  
 
Participating institutions will be eligible for one on -site audit, to  be scheduled by [CONTACT_221854], 
after at least three participants have been treated on protocol at the site. Approximately 3-4 
participants would be audited at the site over a 2 day period.  If violations which impac t 
participant safety or the integrity of the study are found, more participant  records may be 
audited.  
 
6.2 Participating Institution  
 
It is the Participating Institution’s responsibility to notify the Coordinating Cente r of all 
scheduled audit dates and re -audit dates (if applicable), which involve this protocol. All 
IDELALISIB + Ofa  
November 1, [ADDRESS_1281794] a copy of final audit and/or re -audit reports and corrective action plans 
(if applicable) to the Coordinating Center, within 12 weeks after the audit date.  
 
6.3 DF/HCC Sponsor and Coordinating Center  
 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all final audit reports and corrective action pl ans if applicab le. 
The Coordinating Center, must forward these reports to the DF/HCC QACT per DF/H CC policy 
for review by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Audit Committee. Based upon the audit assessments the D F/HCC 
Audit Committee could accept or conditionally accept the audit rating and fina l report.

              SPECIAL NURSING CONSIDERATIONS UNIQUE TO THIS PROTOCOL Study Design 
 Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks ) are enzymes that regulate several cellular functions including motility, 
proliferations and survival.  PI3K signaling is mediated by 4 catalytic isoforms of the p110 subunit of the enzyme – 
α, β, γ and δ.  PI3K δ shows an expression pattern that is particularl y prominent in cells of hematopoietic origin.  
Idelalisib  can selectively inhibit PI3K δ function.  Ofatumumab  ia an anti-CD20 antibody that induces potent 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity against cells tha express CD20 dimly, including CLL.  Study Design  – Section

Acceptable Methods of Contraception  
 
Sexually active women of ch ildbearing potential and sexually active men who are able to 
father a child must choose from the methods of birth control listed below: 
 
 
Individual Methods  Combination Methods  
Hormone Methods 
(choose one and use with a 
barrier method)  Barrier Methods  
(use both OR choose one with a 
hormone method)  
IUD Estrogen and Progesterone Diaphragm with spermicide  
    Copper T 380A IUD       Oral contraceptives  Male condom (with spermicide)
 
     LNg 20 IUD       Transdermal patch  
Tubal Sterilization      Vaginal ring  
Hysterectomy Progesterone  
     Injection  
     Implant 
Abbreviation: IUD = intrauterine device 
 
Women who could become pregnant should a lways use barrier contraception in 
combination with other oral or  hormonal methods of contraception since it is possible 
that the study drug might make some oral or hormonal contraceptives less effective. If 
your partner had a vasectomy you must us e a hormone or barrier method as well. 
 
Your study doctor or personal health ca re provider can discuss the benefits and 
disadvantages of these birth control options with you.

Idelalisib possible interacti ons with other medications 
 
Idelalisib is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A.  Accordingly, coadministration of CYP3A 
substrates with idelalisib ma y result in an increase in their systemic exposures (eg, 
certain antiarrhythmics, calcium channe l blockers, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitors, phosphodiesterase-5 [PDE 5] inhibitors, and warfarin). Particular 
caution is recommended during coadministration of  idelalisib with drugs  that are highly 
dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are 
associated with serious and/or  life-threatening events, in cluding narrow therapeutic 
index CYP3A substrates (eg, alfentanil, cyclosporine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, cisapride, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], fentanyl, quinidine, ergotamine, dihydroergot amine, astemizole, and 
terfenadine). 
When coadministered with rifampin, a highly potent inducer of CYP3A, idelalisib 
exposures are approximately 75% lower. Coadm inistration of potent inducers of CYP3A 
(rifampin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, and St. John’s wort) with idelalisib should be 
avoided.

1.0 Objectives * 
 
1.1 Overview  
 
Caregivers (i.e., family and friends) are essential care providers during cancer treatment. Caregivers of 
patients with serious illnesses, especially cancer, experience significant caregiving burden with the increased shift 
to home healthcare.1 Growing evidence supports that caregiving burden is associated with increased 
psychological distress that results in poorer health outcomes (e.g., decreased quality of life [QOL], increased 
fatigue, depression, and sleep problems) for both the caregiver a nd patient being cared for.2 In addition to distress, 
caregivers of patients with serious illnesses report diminished positive psychological wellbeing (PPWB: e.g., 
optimism, resilience, positive affect, gratitude).3 Diminished PPWB  in caregivers has also been associated with 
higher levels of caregiver burden and frailty, and worse QOL.3-6 
 
Caregivers of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) experience tremendous 
burden and distress. HSCT is a potentially curative treatment for patients with hematologic malignancies. 
However, the treatment is intensive and accompanied by a protracted hospi[INVESTIGATOR_884408] -induced toxicities and early post -transplant complications.7-[ADDRESS_1237303]. As patients often grapple 
with elevated  rates of physical symptoms (e.g., severe diarrhea), psychological distress, and prognostic 
uncertainty, their caregivers experience a decline in QOL and an increase in symptoms of depression during the 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].[ADDRESS_1237304] and its recovery could result in significant disruptions in caregivers’ 
personal lives , especially concerning occupational and familial responsibilities.14-[ADDRESS_1237305] the patient and their 
caregiver.  
 
Population -specific empi[INVESTIGATOR_884409]’ needs over the cancer care and 
treatment cycle are especially limited among caregivers of HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].11, 17, [ADDRESS_1237306] 
QOL, and improve physical health.3, 20, 21 Positive psychology interventions (PPIs) entail exercises (e.g., writing 
a gratitude letter) completed systematically and deliberately to cultivate PPWB.22-[ADDRESS_1237307] been 
successfully used in other caregiver populations (e.g., caregivers of patients with dementia),27, [ADDRESS_1237308] . 
 
The primary goal of this study is to refine (phase 1) and test the feasibility  (phase 2)  of a positive -psychology 
based  intervention in caregivers of HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] . Data from this  study  will lay the groundwork  for randomized 
studies to examine efficacy of positive psychology interventions among  caregivers of patients who have 
undergone  HSCT.

1.2 Specific Aims /Objectives  and Hypothesis  
 
Specific Aim 1 ( Phase 1: Intervention Refinement ): To refine a positive psychology  intervention  (PATH ) in 
caregivers of HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_884410] -pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]  (N=5) . 
 
Specific Aim 2 ( Phase 2: Feasibility ): To determine the feasibility and acceptability  of the refined PATH 
intervention  and our assessment battery  in caregivers of patients who have undergone HSCT using a single -arm 
trial (N=20) . 
 
Hypothesis 1:  The intervention will be deemed feasible if >60% of eligible participants enroll and >60% of 
enrolled participants complete ≥6/9 positive psychology (PP) exercises.  
 
Hypothesis 2 : The intervention will be deemed acceptable if weekly ratings of ease and utility of the PP 
exercises are >7/10 on a 10 -point Likert Scale  (0=very difficult/not helpful; 10=very easy/very helpful).  
 
2.0 Background * 
 
From diagnosis to recovery and survivorship, c aregivers (i.e., family and friends) are essential care 
providers  for the entire  cancer care cycle . Caregivers of patients with cancer experience significant caregiving 
burden with increas ing shift to home health  care.1 However, rising c aregiving burden is associated with poorer 
health outcomes characterized by a myriad of physical and psychological distress symptoms , such as increased 
fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep problems and decreased quality of life [QOL]  for both the caregiver and patient 
being cared for.2 Additionally , caregivers of patients with serious illnesses report reduced  positive psychological 
wellbeing (PPWB: e.g., optimism, resilience, positive affect, gratitude).3 Diminished PPWB in caregivers has 
also been associated with higher levels of caregiver burden , frailty, and worse QOL.3-6 
 
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  (HSCT)  is potential ly curative  for some  patients with hematologic 
malignancies . However, the treatment is demanding  and accompanied by [CONTACT_884431][INVESTIGATOR_602] . Due to 
chemotherapy -induced toxic  side-effects  and early post -transplant  life-threatening  complications, patients often 
grapple with  elevated  rates of physical symptoms  (e.g., severe diarrhea, pain , nausea, fatigue ), and mortality.29,7-

associated with higher levels of caregiver burden and worse QOL.3-5 Inevitably , caregiver and patient

Positive psychological intervention s (PPIs) are empi[INVESTIGATOR_884413]  (e.g., heart failure, diabetes)  and their caregivers .42, [ADDRESS_1237315] -effective , and can be delivered via phone either individually or in groups by 
[CONTACT_184370] a wide range of training , including bachelor level clinicians.  PPIs entail positive psych ological 
exercises (e.g., writing a letter of gratitude, performing acts of kindness, recalling positive life events, leveraging 
previous successes, and expressing optimism) completed in a systematic and deliberate manner.22-[ADDRESS_1237316]: Informed by [CONTACT_102923],44

the Positive psychology for Allogenic Transplantation of Hematopoietic stem cell intervention (PATH) .  The 
PATH intervention is  a novel 9 -week phone -administered PPI. 
Preliminary testing of the PATH intervention via a one -arm proof -of-
concept study (18 -225) demonstrated that our intervention was feasible 
and acceptable in patients undergoing HSCT  and led to very small -to-
medium effect size improvements in patient -reported outcomes (e.g.,  
symptoms of depression and anxiety, QOL, fatigue) .[ADDRESS_1237318] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], we hope to use a n open -
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (phase -1) to refine the PATH intervention and then use a one -arm 
trial (phase -2) to establish feasibility and acceptability in caregivers of 
HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Results from this study  will assist in the refinement of 
our intervention for future larger efficacy  trials in the HSCT caregiver 
population.   
Conceptual Model : Our conceptual model in Figure 2 , adapted from th e 
Broaden and Build Theory of Positive Emotions44 and the Revised Stress and Copi[INVESTIGATOR_163648] ,45 proposes 
that PPWB could increase  caregivers’  emotional and cognitive resources for problem -solving strategies

3.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria*  
 
We will recruit 2 5 (5 for phase -1 and 20 for phase -2) consecutive caregivers of patients undergoing H SCT at 
Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DCFI) to participate  in this study . Caregivers will be recruited during the patient 
transplant consent visit, or over the telephone if patient identifies a potentially eligible caregiver  at the consent 
visit.  
 
 3.1    Screening Procedures:  
 
Screening and eligibility procedures will be the same for both phases of the project. Caregivers of patients 
undergoing H SCT will participate in this  study . Caregivers will be identified by [CONTACT_884432]. The primary caregiver must either live with the patient or have in -person contact [CONTACT_884433]. The research team will review the transplant clinic schedule to identify potentially eligible 
patients to be approached to identify their primary caregivers for study participation. The research team will 
contact [CONTACT_884434]’ oncology clinicians to inform them that we plan to approach the  patient’s primary  
caregiver and inquire about any concerns regarding the  caregiver’s  participation  in the study . If the clinician 
objects to the caregivers’ participation, we will document the reason and not approach those individuals. If the 
oncologist has no concerns regarding the caregivers’ participation, the research staff will approach eligible 
caregivers.  We will approach caregivers to participate during the HSCT hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], until the patient’s day 
[ADDRESS_1237319] -transplant. T he clinical research coordinator ( CRC ) will approach the patient during their HSCT 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_884415] [ADDRESS_1237320] up to two voicemails [Appendix A]. Caregivers will 
have the option of enrolling in the study over the telephone with a verbal consent [Appendix B] - we advocate for 
a waiver of written informed  consent because this study is no more than minimal risk and the goal is to prioritize 
participant safety and reduce their exposure to study staff in the setting of the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic. For 
the nature of this study, remote consenting is not feasi ble for our cohort as it requires a level of technical 
knowledge and maybe burdensome for some caregivers. Electronic consenting may also result in a selection bias 
in participation procedures. Lastly, in the setting of the pandemic, patients (especially t hose who are 
immunocompromised like our cohort) are increasingly conducting virtual visits with their oncology clinicians, 
limiting our ability to effectively conduct in -person consent procedures with their caregivers.  The CRC  will 
review the consent form with potential caregiver participants, which will clearly detail the nature of the study 
procedures and the time requirement.  
 
Phase -1: Caregivers who provide informed consent will then be registered with ODQ and scheduled for their first 
study intervention visit via telephone. Caregivers who withdraw from the study during the study period will not 
be replaced and they will count towards the accrual numbers.  
 
Phase -2: Enrolled caregivers will complete baseline self -assessment  questionnaire s [Appendix C]  within a week  
window from study enrollment. Caregivers who provide informed consent and complete the baseline 
questionnaire s will then be registered with ODQ and scheduled for their first study intervention visit via 
telephone. If a caregiver signs the consent form but does not complete the baseline questionnaire s, they will be

Patients with Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing H ematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  
 
 Page 8 of 31  
excluded from the study. Caregiver s who withdraw from the study during the study period will not be replaced 
and they will count towards the accrual numbers.  
 
 3.2    Eligibility Criteria  
 
Caregiver Inclusion Criteria:  
1) Adult caregivers (≥18 years) of patients undergoing allogeneic H SCT at DFCI. 
2) A relative or a friend who either lives with the patient or has in -person contact [CONTACT_884435] . 
3) Ability to speak English and able to complete questionnaires with minimum assistance of an interpreter.  
 
Caregiver Exclusion Criteria:  
• Cognitive deficits impeding a caregiver’s ability to provide informed consent or participate adequately 
in the study assessed via a commonly used 6 -item cognitive assessment with the Brief Interview for 
Mental Status (BIMS) screening tool that is sensitive and specific for screening for cognitive impairment 
in research subjects  [Apendix D]. 
 
Special Populations : 
• Individuals who are unable to verbally consent or are not yet adults (including infants, children, 
teenagers), pregnant women or prisoners will be excluded from the study.  
 
4.0 Study -Wide Number of Subjects*  
 
We propose to recruit a total of 25 caregivers  (5 for phase -1 and 20 for phase -2) of patients undergoing H SCT 
from one site – Dana Farber Cancer Institute  (DFCI ). We chose our sample size because these are the numbers 
commonly used in behavioral intervention refinement and single -arm feasibility testing trials.50, 51 This is not a 
multi -site study . 
 
5.0 Study -Wide Recruitment Methods  
 
5.1 Recruitment and Enrollment Procedures:  
 
Prior to study start, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_102895], recruitment, and enrollment procedures. The CRC will screen the 
DFCI HSCT clinic schedule to identify potentially elig ible pa tients. The CRC will approach caregivers for 
study participation  during a patient ’s HSCT hospi[INVESTIGATOR_884416] [ADDRESS_1237321] their caregiver via phone  [Appendix E]. 
Interested participants will be screened with the BIMS and  if eligible , will undergo verbal consent procedures.  
Caregivers will have the option of enrolling in the study in -person at the ir patient’s scheduled clinic v isit or over 
the telephone with a verbal consent [Appendix B].  
 
We are requesting a HIPAA Waiver of Authorization to review Preparatory to Research from the IRB.  
This Waiver is being requested to identify potential participants from a minimal chart review. In accordance 
with the DF/HCC policy, this waiver: 1) is being sought solely to review Protected Health Information as 
necessary to prepare a research protocol  and for recriuitment ; 2) will not include Protected Health Information 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Proof -of-Concept Trial of a P ositive Psychology Intervention for Caregivers of 
Patients with Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing H ematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  
 
 Page 9 of 31  
from the Covered Entity by [CONTACT_3021]; and 3) the Protected Health Information for which we are requesting 
access is necessary for research purposes.  
 
Participants  will be registered with the Clinical Trials Management System after they have verbally consented 
and completed baseli ne assessments. Participants who withdraw from the study or die during the study period 
will not be replaced and they will count towards accrual numbers.  
 
DF/HCC institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) 
Oncore as required by [CONTACT_102927]/HCC SOP REGIST -101. Registration must occur after the initiation of protocol -
specific procedures or assessments.  
 
For registration of pa rticipants  from the DF/HCC institutions, study  staff will complete the DF/HCC protocol -
specific eligibility checklist. Study staff will confirm that the participant meets all inclusion criteria as described 
in this protocol. Study staff will then register study participants through OnCore. Study staff will follow 
DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedure for Human Subject Research Titled Subject Protocol Registration (SOP 
#: REGIST -101) and register the participant on the protocol.  
 
Once the caregiver has been enrolled , they will be asked to  complete baseline study measures. Registration 
Process for DF/HCC Institutions DF/HCC Standard Operation Procedure for Human Subject Research Titled 
Subject Protocol Registration (SOP#: REGIST -101) must be followed. For each study participants, we will 
complete the following registration procedures:  
 
• We will obtain written informed consent from the participant prior to the performance of any protocol 
specific procedures or assessments.  
• We will complete the ODQ protocol -specific eligibility checklist using the eligibility assessment 
documented in the participant’s medical record and/or research chart. Only eligible participants will be 
registered . To be eligible for registration to the protocol, the participant must meet all inclusion and 
exclusion criteri a as described in this protocol and reflected on our eligibility checklist.  
• We will fax the eligibility checklist(s) and all pages of the consent form(s) to the ODQ at 617 -632-2295.  
• The ODQ Registrar will (a) review the eligibility checklist  and (b) register the participant on the 
protocol . 
• An email confirmation of the registration will be sent to the PI, study RA, treating investigator and 
registering person immediately following the registration .

person during  patient’s HSCT hospi[INVESTIGATOR_884420] a patient’s routine clinic visit anytime up to the [ADDRESS_1237325]-transplant period , or with patient permission over the phone if caregiver is not physically present at the 
consent visit for eligibility determination . Interested participants will be screened based on the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and verbal consent  would be obtained (via phone) .  
 
Upon consent to participate in the study , participants in Phase -2 will be asked to complete baseline 
questionnaires either in -person, over the phone , or via a REDCap survey link to participants. After baseline 
assessments are completed, participants will be given  an intervention manual  with 9 -weekly PP exercises  and an 
explanation of the exercises and intervention .  
 
Participants in Phase -1 will complete the intervention after consenting for the study. All participants in Phase -2 
will be asked to complete the 9-weekly PP exercises starting after the baseline questionnaires (i.e., after the

patient transplant consent visit) are completed in the pre -transplant phase and to speak with the study 
interventionist, a trained CRC, weekly. Immediately after the completion of  each exercise,  participants will rate 
the ease of exercise completion, overall utility of the exercise, and their current levels of positive affect . After 
the Week 9 intervention phone session , participants in Phase -2 will repeat self -assessment questionnaires 
completed at baseline either over the phone , in-person at a routine cli nic visit , or via a REDCap survey link 
emailed to participants . Additionally, participants will be asked to complete a recorded exit interview over the 
phone. These individual, semi -structured exit interviews will elicit feedback about the intervention (e.g., 
relevance and applicability of the chosen PP exercises, intervention length, timing, and delivery), study 
procedures, and the questionnaires. Exit interviews will be recorded, transcribed, coded and thematically 
analy zed. With the Oppenheimer Grants Program  funding, participants who complete study procedures will 
receive $ 100 renumeration for their time and feedback.  At study completion , we will inquire about participants’  
potential interest in being contact[CONTACT_102933].

Self-reported measures:  
• Demographic questionnaire:  Participants will self -report their age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, 
relationship satisfaction, religion, and education level, relationship status, relationship to the patient, and 
living situation [Appendix F].  
• QOL:  We will use the CareGiver Oncology QOL questionnaire (CarGOQOL) to measure caregiver QOL  
[Appendix G].56   
• Caregiving burden:  We will use the Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA) to assess caregiving burden 
[Appendix H].57 
• Mood: We will use the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS) to assess symptoms of depression 
and anxiety in all study participants [Appendix I].58  
• Self-efficacy:  We will use the Cancer Self -Efficacy Scale -transplant (CASE -t) to measure caregivers’ 
confidence in managing the impact of HCT [Appendix J].17  
• Perceived copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]: We will use the Measure Of Current Status (MOCS) to assess caregivers’ self -
perceived status on skills targeted by [CONTACT_884436], recognizing stress -inducing 
situations, restructuring maladaptive thoughts, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  [Appendix K]. 
• Optimism:  We will use the [ADDRESS_1237334] -Revised (LOT -R) to measure dispositional (trait) optimism. 
Higher scores indicate greater optimism.59 [Appendix L]  
• Positive Affect:  We will use the [ADDRESS_1237335] Schedule (PANAS) to measure positive affect; 
higher scores indicate greater positive and negative affect.60 [Appendix M]  
• Satisfaction:  We will use the 5 -item Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) to measure satisfaction with life; higher scores 
indicate greater satisfaction with life.61 [Appendix N]  
• Gratitude:  We will use the 6 -item Gratitude Questionnaire to   measure dispositional gratitude; higher scores indicate 
greater proneness to experience gratitude in daily life.62 [Appendix O]  
• Purpose and Flourishing:  We will use the 8 -item Flourishing Scale to assesses a person’s self -perceived success in 
critical areas such as engagement, relationships, self -esteem, meaning & purpose, and optimism; higher scores indicate 
many psychological resources and strengths.63 [Appendix P]  
• Physical activity:  We will use t he well -validated Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer,64for 7 days of wear; 
minimum acceptable use is 4+ days with 10+ hours of recorded data as in prior guidelines65-67 to measure 
minutes/day of light activity (100 -1951 counts/min68) along with sedentary leisure time (SL T),64, 69 given their 
links to health outcomes [Appendix Q]. Participants in Phase -[ADDRESS_1237336] week of the intervention.  
 
9.4 Qualitative Interview Guide  
 
We will use a semi -structured interview guide to explore  the following:  1) caregiver perception of the 
acceptability and content of the intervention; and 2) caregiver perceptions of the benefits of receiving the 
intervention. Facilitators will use probes to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the caregivers’ 
perspectives. The semi -structured interview guide is detailed in Appendix  R. The interview will last 
approximately [ADDRESS_1237337]

Patients with Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing H ematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  
 
 Page [ADDRESS_1237338] and enter all caregiver -reported data electronically using Research Electronic Data Capture 
(REDCap). The REDCap Survey is a tool for building and managing online surveys. Vanderbilt University, in 
collaboration with a consortium of institutional partners, has developed this software and workflow 
methodology for electronic collection and management of research and clinical trial data. Our research team has 
extensive experience using REDCap and will create and design the surveys in a web browser, with institutional 
information technology support. The REDCap Survey system offers secure, HIPA A compliant, web -based 
applications that provide an intuitive interface for participants to enter data, with real -time validation rules at the 
time of entry.  
 
Participants will  be e-mailed a remote access  link to the REDCap system [Appendix  S] containing 
questionnaires for them to complete or they can  complete questionnaires during in-person clinic  visits . If any 
participants refuse or are unable to complete the questionnaires on the computer, they will be permitted to use 
hard-copy paper . Participants will also be provided the option to complete  questionnaire s over the phone. The 
CRC  will contact [CONTACT_352935]  (in-person  or via telephone ) daily for two days to re mind them to complete and 
return the surveys. If study participants fail to complete the surveys within seven  days of the expected time 
point, we will report the data as missing and document the reason for incompletion. Table 4 details the schedule 
for administering the self -report measures.

9.7 Overview of Research Procedures  
 
Initial/Enrollment phone call:  During this initial approach during the  patient’s HSCT hospi[INVESTIGATOR_884420] a 
routine clinic visit up to t heir day [ADDRESS_1237339] -transplant, or with patient permission a phone call after the consent 
visit, the study procedures will be explained to potential participants. Those who are interested will be screened 
for eligibility. Eligible participants will be enroll ed and asked to complete  verbal consent procedures.  Consented 
participants  will also be mailed (or given in person  at a routine follow -up visit) the study intervention manual . 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Proof -of-Concept Trial of a P ositive Psychology Intervention for Caregivers of 
Patients with Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing H ematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  
 
 Page 15 of 31  
 
Baseline Assessments : At enrollment all participants will be mailed the Actigraph GT3X+  with instructions on 
how to use the Actigraph  for 7 days of wear; minimum acceptable use is 4+ days with 10+ hours of recorded 
data prior to the intervention initiation. After baseline physical activity data collection, participants will mail 
back the Actigraph in prepaid envelopes we will provide. Within a week  of consenting to participate  in the 
study , participants will be asked to complete baseline assessment questionnaires either in -person during a 
routine follow -up visit in clinic, over phone , or via a REDCap survey link that will be e -mailed to p articipants 
before intervention initiation.  
After completion of the baseline survey , the interventionist will review the mailed treatment manual with 
weekly PP exercises. Participants will be assigned the first exercise (gratitude for positive events) in preparation 
for their first phone session.  
  
Weekly phone sessions for positive psychology intervention : All participants will be asked to complete the [ADDRESS_1237340] 
approximately 15 -20 minutes. Prior to completing each phone session, participants will be asked to rate the ir 
current level of happi[INVESTIGATOR_102904], using a 10 -point Likert scale. Immediately after completing the 
exercise and phone session, participants will rate the ease of exercise/session completion , overall utility of the 
exercise/phone session, and their current levels of happi[INVESTIGATOR_102904], all using 10 -point Likert scales. 
These calls will be recorded so that a percentage (10%) of these recordings can be reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Amonoo , to 
ensure that the PP intervention is being delivered as described in the protocol. Given the results of our prior PP 
studies in medical populations yielding a 64 -85% completion rate of the exercises,  our recent proof -of-concept 
trial (18 -225) yielding 100% completion rate among HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] , and that this is a feasibility study (i.e., 
we want to assess participants’ willingness to complete the phone sessions), we will expect participants to 
complete at least [ADDRESS_1237341] 6 sessions, misse d sessions 
will not be considered a deviation from the protocol.  
 
Follow -up assessments:  At Week 9, participants will repeat self -assessment questionnaires obtained at the 
beginning of the study either in -person , during a routine follow -up clinic visit, over the phone , or via a REDCap 
survey link e -mailed to them, depending on participant’s preference.  A week prior to intervention completion,  
participants will be mailed the Actigraph GT3X+  for follow -up physical activity data collection and  participants 
will mail back the Actigraph in prepaid envelopes we will provide. Furthermore, participants will be asked to 
provide feedback about the program via a recorded exit interview over the phone.  
 
Positive Psychology Program Content : All phone sessions will include (a) a review of the ease and utility of the 
week’s PP exercise , (b) a discussion of the rationale of the next week’s PP exercise through a guided review of 
the PP manual, and (c) assignment of the next week’s PP exercise. During the calls, the interventionist and 
participant will also review the next section of the tr eatment manual and prepare for the upcoming week’s 
exercise.

Brigram /DFCI  server. Recordings will contain no personally identifiable inform ation (names or other 
identifying information on the recordings  will not be used ) and will be erased following review.  
 
10.0 Data and Specimen Banking : Not Applicable  
 
10.1. Data analysis  
 
We will use descriptive statistics (e.g., mean) for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables 
to summarize the demographic and clinical characteristics of caregivers enrolled in the study.  
 
Specific Aim 1 (Phase 1: Intervention Refinement): To refine a positive psychology intervention, PATH, 
in caregivers of HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_884422] -pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Informed by [CONTACT_726379],46  
our planned sample size (N=5) will allow us to obtain comprehensive feedback about the intervention  for 
refinement . The qualitative exit interviews will explore the following themes: 1) caregiver perception of 
intervention content; 2) barriers/challenges with the delivery method; and 3) modifications to promote caregiver 
engagement. All exit interviews will be recorde d, transcribed, coded , and thematically analyzed using a directed 
content analysis.70 Findings from phase -1 will be used to refine and finalize the intervention for feasibility 
testing in phase 2. Participant feedback of the study assessments/questionnaires will also help to refine the study 
procedures for the phase -[ADDRESS_1237344].  
 
Specific Aim 2 (Feasibilit y and Acceptability ): To assess the feasibility  and acceptability  of the PATH 
intervention for caregivers of patients undergoing H SCT. Based on prior work, we define feasibility as 
>60% of eligible participants enrolling for the study and > 60% of enrolled participants who start the 
intervention completing at least [ADDRESS_1237345] 95% binomial confidence interval around the 
proportion . We will assess acceptability using weekly ratings of ease and utility of each exercise (0=very 
difficult/not helpful; 10=very easy/very helpful) . The mean ease and utility of each exercise will be calculated, 
and we will use a threshold mean combined score of 7.0/10 for acceptability that was used in prior studies.19,57 
 
Qualitative Data Analysis: For all exit interviews, two research staff will independently review the transcripts 
to create a thematic framework for interpretation. Dedoose 8.0.35 software (SocioCultural Research 
Consultants, LLC: Los Angeles, CA) will be used for data organization a nd management. We will code and 
analyze the data using directed content analysis, a descriptive approach to qualitative analysis .74 Codes will be 
informed by [CONTACT_884437], and the framework for the coding tree will be 
informed by [CONTACT_884438].70 Overall with qualitative data, we will explore 
intervention acceptability, proposed intervention content (e.g., PP exercises), and delivery preferences (e.g., 
intervention duration, call frequency).

10.2 Sample Size Calculation & Power Analysis:  
 
Given that this pi[INVESTIGATOR_74489] a one -arm feasibility study, we will not be able to estimate sample sizes or complete a 
power analysis. Although we will be administering patient reported outcomes for phase 2, the primary reason is 
feasibility of study procedures and we are not powered to detect statistically significant group differences . 
 
10.[ADDRESS_1237346] been obtained and data analysis has been 
completed as discussed previously.  
 
Participants’ responses to survey questions will remain confidential unless there is active suicidal ideation 
confirmed by [CONTACT_5051]. Under these circumstances, as clearly stated in the pa rticipant  consent form, the 
study CRC  will inform the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_102906], psychiatry and/or take further 
action as deemed necessary.  
 
We will ensure that contact [CONTACT_884439] -related messages for 
participants unless expressly allowed b y participants. Upon enrollment, we ask all participants if it is acceptable 
to leave voice messages on their phones, as well as the appropriate times to call them. We will adhere to all 
participant  requests regarding contact.  
 
In addition, as stated previously, all study staff will undergo an extensive training on study procedures as well 
as data management to ensure data security and maintaining of confidentiality.  
 
10.4 Quality control for collected data:  
 
Our study staff will utilize double -data entry for approximately 10% of the data entered through REDCap to 
ensure high data quality. A CRC , blinded to the study intervention, will double enter 10% of the data through 
REDCap to check on data fidelity. If an error is found, the research coordinator will double enter an additional 
5% of the data through REDCap. This process will continue until no errors are found. Also, the CRC  will 
perform ‘test downloads’ of the data to ensure that it can be captured in the statistical package to be used in this 
study.  
 
11.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects * 
 
Purpos e of Data and Safety Monitoring Plan:  
The purpose of the data and safety monitoring plan is to establish standards that will ensure that this protocol 
complies with Federal Regulations, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements 
and applicable Dana Farber Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) Standard Operating Procedures.  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Proof -of-Concept Trial of a P ositive Psychology Intervention for Caregivers of 
Patients with Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing H ematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  
 
 Page 18 of 31  
General Roles and Responsibilities:  
[CONTACT_102972] will be responsible for all aspects of conducting the protocol, which includes:  
• Overseeing the development, submission, and approval of the protocol as well as subsequent 
amendments.  
• Ensuring that the research team members are qualified and appropriately resourced to conduct the 
protocol.  
• Training the clinical research coordinators prior to enrolling participants and throughout the trial’s 
conduct as needed.  
• Monitoring the progress and overall conduct of the study.  
• Reviewing data collection and entry , and maintaining timely submission of data for study analysis.  
• Ensuring compliance with all requirements as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, Dana Farber 
Harvard Cancer Center requirements, HIPAA requirements, and the approved protocol.  
• Committing to provisions that the protocol will not be rewritten or modified by [CONTACT_884440].  
• Monitoring accrual and address concerns if accrual goals are not met.  
 
The Dana -Farber Cancer Center is expected to comply with all applicable federal regulations and requirements, 
the protocol and HIPAA requirements. Specifically, it will be responsible for:  
• Overseeing the data collection process.  
• Maintaining documentation of Serious Adverse Events (SAE) reports and deviations/violations.  
• Maintaining regulatory documents which include but not limited to the following: IRB 
approvals/notifications, confirmation of Federal wise Assurances (FWAs), all SAE submissions, 
screening logs, IRB approved consents.  
• Conducting regular communications with overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_102907].  
• Documenting the delegation of research specific activities to study personnel.  
• Maintaining regulatory files.  
• Having office space, office equipment, and internet access that meet HIPAA standards.  
• Participating in quality assurance activities and meet with monitors or auditors at the conclusion of a 
visit to review findings.  
• Providing follow -up and/or corrective action plans for any monitoring queries or audit findings.  
 
Intervention Training and Supervision:  
• Study Staff Training:  We will conduct a full day training for the clinical research coordinator (CRC) to 
ensure consistent recruitment and enrollment procedures. We will train the CRC to: 1) identify 
potentially eligible patients via the transplant clinic schedule and/or databa se; 2) track potentially 
eligible patients; 3) communicate with the treating clinicians about patient eligibility; 4) obtain verbal  
informed consent from patients;  5) monitor pa rticipants  longitudinally and administer study 
questionn aires ; and 6) deliver the PATH intervention . In addition, [CONTACT_102972] will meet with the CRC 
weekly to address any study issues or concerns.  
• Assessment of Intervention Fidelity: To ensure the appropriate delivery of the intervention, 10% of all 
intervention calls will be recorded and reviewed with [CONTACT_102972] for consistency with explanation and 
delivery of positive psychology exercises. These measures will also provide accurate data on 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Proof -of-Concept Trial of a P ositive Psychology Intervention for Caregivers of 
Patients with Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing H ematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  
 
 Page [ADDRESS_1237347]. Amonoo  will also discuss any issues or concerns regarding the intervention 
fidelity.  
 
Informed Consent Requirements:  
The Dana Farber Harvard Cancer Center approved informed verbal consent document will serve as a template 
for the informed consent.  
 
Protocol Confidentiality:  All documents, investigative reports, or information relating to study participants will 
be kept strictly confidential. We will ensure confidentiality is maintained by [CONTACT_884441], visit numbe r, and date of visit. By [CONTACT_102945], all 
information will be considered 'de -identified,' and therefore compliant with the Standards for Privacy of 
Individually Identifiable Health Information ("Privacy Rule ") of the Health Insurance Portability Act of 1996. 
We will keep participant data in a computer file that is password protected. Only [CONTACT_102972] and research 
team will have access to the data. We will maintain a link between the participant name [CONTACT_102970] a 
separate password protected file.  
 
Data Management Organizational Structure:  [CONTACT_102972] and the CRC will develop the study specific database 
to ensure all data is entered appropriately. The CRC will routinely evaluate the data and discuss any problems 
and questions with [CONTACT_102972] at a weekly meeting. Data management formal report s on record status across 
the three following domains will be employed: entered, verified, and edited. These reports of data records will 
be evaluated once a month during the final team meeting of the month. To help  ensure data protection, backup 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014], automatically generated by [CONTACT_46768], will be available.  
 
Attrition Safeguards/Protection of Loss of Data:  A notable methodological consideration pertaining to the 
proposed research is protection against attrition. Our research group has conducted numerous clinical 
intervention studies. In our previous work, we have learned that individuals are best retained in  studies when 
there is 1) a familiarity with study personnel (e.g., ability to effectively establish rapport), 2) team -based 
persistence in conducting follow -up assessments, and 3) intervention sessions happening in tandem with 
ongoing medical appointments  or inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. Yet, it is worth noting here a number of key issues 
that we have thoughtfully considered in the construction of the present proposal related to attrition. Attrition in 
clinical research studies overall occurs from three majo r sources: (a) disease worsening/mortality, (b) refusal to 
participate, and (c) loss of contact.   
• Disease Worsening/Mortality:  Not likely for this study as this is for caregivers and not patients.  
• Refusal to Participate:  Participants who are successfully recruited into the study but later refuse to participate 
in subsequent intervention sessions pose a threat to the proposed study. In our previous trial, our refusal to 
participate rate after study enrollment was quite low  and all  participants who started the intervention actually 
completed the all the intervention sessions . Again, the CRCs  will maintain detailed records for patient refusals.  
• Loss of Contact:  [CONTACT_102946] -up assessments. Like attrition due to subject refusal, 
attrition due to loss of contact [CONTACT_102947] a threat to the  proposed study. We do not anticipate this to be a major 
issue for the proposed study given this is a  one -one feasibility study without many follow -up data collection. 
Also, the intensive and frequent outpatient follow -up visits for the ca regivers of patients with hematologic 
malignancies during the first six months post -HSCT.  
 
Data Safety and Monitoring Plan : 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Proof -of-Concept Trial of a P ositive Psychology Intervention for Caregivers of 
Patients with Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing H ematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  
 
 Page 20 of 31  
The following procedures will be followed, in compliance with NIH requirements, to ensure the safety of study 
participants and the validity and integrity of data.  
• Range of Safety Reporting:  [CONTACT_102972] will review all data pertaining to safety during the weekly research 
team meeting. These include adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), but also other data 
that may reflect differences in safety such as treatment retention rate s and reasons for dropout.  
• Data Repository:  [CONTACT_102972] will oversee all aspects of data collection for the study and the CRCs will 
have the operational responsibility of data management. Specifically, the research team will develop a study 
specific data management protocol and standard operating pr ocedures for the creation and testing of all 
study forms, data collection, quality control, and data extraction. These forms will be standardized. We will 
provide ongoing oversight of data management throughout the study, and will be respon sible for generating 
reports and datasets for quality control and data analysis. All data management activities will utilize 
REDCap, a software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of 
research and clinical trial data. R EDCap data collection projects rely on a thorough study -specific data 
dictionary defined in an iterative self -documenting process by [CONTACT_884442], Enterprise Research Infrastructure & 
Services (ERIS) group. REDCap provides secure, HIPAA compliant, web -based applications with an 
intuitive interface for users to enter data and have real time validation rules (with automated data type and 
range checks) at the time of entry .  
• Serious Adverse Events:  Expedited review will occur for all events meeting the FDA definition of a SAE 
(i.e., any fatal event, immediately life -threatening event, permanently or substantially disabling event, event 
requiring or prolonging inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any congen ital anomaly). This also includes any event 
that a study investigator judges to impose a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. 
Given that this is a supportive care study in caregivers , only SAEs that may p otentially be related to the 
study will be reported to the IRB. All relevant information will be reported to the IRB for each SAE 
including information about the event and its outcome, study condition, concomitant medications, the 
subject’s medical history  and current conditions, and all relevant laboratory data. Notification by [CONTACT_102949] e -
mail of all related study forms shall be made to the IRB within 24 hours of the occurrence of any SAE that 
might be relevant to the study. Information will be reviewed and a determination made of whether there was 
any possible relevance to the study interventions.  
• Non-Serious Adverse Events : The research team will review monthly summary reports of the numbers and 
rates of adverse events by [CONTACT_1570]. These reports will include types of events, severity, and 
treatment phase.  
• Other Safety -Related Reports : The research team will review weekly summary reports of treatment 
retention and reasons for dropout, by [CONTACT_1570].  
 
Monitoring of Data Quality by [CONTACT_5051]:  
The research team will review the following items on weekly basis to ensure data quality and completeness:  
• Total enrollment compared with anticipated enrollment  
• Number of ineligible patients registered  
• Proportion of missing data  
• Number of participants completing the study  
 
Additionally, the research team will receive a report on safety and outcome data for the trial:  
• Number and types of SAEs  
• Number and types of reportable AEs

 Page [ADDRESS_1237348]. Amonoo’s (PI) ove rsight. She will work closely with the Partners Human Research Affairs QI 
Program to register the trial prior to enrolling the first subject. Once a record is established, she will confirm 
accuracy of record content; resolve problems; and maintain records including content update and modification. 
She will also be responsible for aggregate results reporting and AE reporting at the conclusion of the project. 
We will ensure that summary results will be reported to clinicaltrials.gov no later than one year aft er the 
primary completion date.  
 
12.0 Withdrawal of Subjects*  
 
We do not anticipate any circumstances under which the subjects will be withdrawn from the research without 
their consent.  We do not anticipate any termination of pa rticipants . When verbal informed consent is being 
obtained from patients, we will emphasize to pa rticipants  that they can withdraw from the study at any time for 
any discomforts. Participant s who withdraw from the study will still have their data potentially analyzed 
depending on when in the study they withdraw , and pa rticipants  will be informed of this as well.  We will ensure 
that contact [CONTACT_884443] -related messages for participants  unless 
expressly allowed by [CONTACT_4317]. Upon enrollment, we ask all participants if it is acceptable to leave voice 
messages on their phones, as well as the appropriate times to call them. We adhere to any and all pa rticipant  
requests regarding contact.  If a participant requests withdrawal from the study, we will ask them if they are 
comfortable sharing the reason for withdrawal to ensure that there are no adverse events to report to the IRB. 
We will ask the study participant if they are still willing to  permit the study team to continue to monitor their 
health record, but withdraw from all other study procedures.  
 
13.0 Risks to Subjects*  
 
The risks to participating in this study should be relatively limited  and is no more than minimal risk . Given this 
is a supportive caregiver -oncology study, we do not anticipate any study -related events meeting the FDA 
definition of a SAE (i.e., any fatal event, immediately life -threatening event, permanently or substantially 
disabling event, event requiring or prolonging inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], or any congenital anomaly). This study 
population is comprised of caregivers of patients undergoing HSCT .  
 
We anticipate no physical risks to participating in this study. Study participants may experience discomfort 
from discussing psychological experiences and could experience the evaluation as intrusive. Study participants 
who do not find any benefit from partic ipation may find this upsetting. Activities to obtain data through the 
baseline and follow -up assessment  battery  may provide some inconvenience to study participants.  
 
Non-Serious Adverse Events:  The IRB will be provided with unblinded summaries of study related non -serious 
adverse events by [CONTACT_102952]. These reports will include types of events, 
severity, and treatment phase. To date, we have had very few non -seriou s events in our supportive care studies.  
 
As this is a behavioral study, there are no ingested medications, and no biomedical procedures. It is unlikely

that participants will be at any risk for physical harm as a result of study participation.   
 
Reaction Management:  Verbal consent will be provided  by [CONTACT_884444]. The consent will include all study procedures, information about potential risks and benefits of 
participation, and information regarding whom the participant can contact [CONTACT_102954]. It  also will state 
that participation is voluntary, that participants can refuse to answer any question, that they can withdraw from 
the study at any time, and that study participation is in no way related to their medical care. All study staff will 
complete the required human subjects training before working on any human subject aspects of the study.   
 
Should a participant exhibit or express distress, they will be reassured by [CONTACT_102955]. They will also be reminded that study participation is voluntary. If 
participants remain distressed, the study staff will notify both the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_884423]. 
Should several participants express distress over an individual item, the research team will review the 
questionnaire and contact [CONTACT_102956].  
 
If a participant reports severe distress or suicidal ideation during the study conduct, the CRC  will inform the PI . 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_884424]. The research team will review sensitive items regarding suicidal ideation within 120 hours (5 
business days) of receipt of completed surveys and will report any suicidal ideation to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_102911]. We will 
take all measures to ensure  that participan ts are  comfort able, and we will postpone or end intervention sessions  
at study participants’ requests. We will also ensure that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_884425] (due to pa rticipant  discomfort or to answer specific questions about the study), during 
intervention sessions  and assessments. We have  been thoughtful to use the briefest methods necessary to assess 
emotional states and other outcomes to reduce pa rticipant  discomfort.  
 
As with any study, there is the risk of a breach of confidentiality of the data collected. To minimize the potential 
loss of confidentiality, we will employ multiple safeguards and measures.  Study procedures and i nterv ention 
sessions  will be administered by a trained interventionist . Study participants will be assigned a unique study 
identification number , stored separately from personal identification information. All data, including telephone 
recordings and transcripts , will be securely stored in locked file drawers. All project file cabinets and computer 
databases will be secured in locked offices. We will ensure to not provide any data to third parties. Data will be 
aggregated and summary reports will be generated with out any personal identification information.  
 
14.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects*  
 
Positive psychology interventions are not a standard of care for caregivers of patients with any form of 
malignancy. To our knowledge, this trial is the first of its kind testing a positive psychology intervention in 
caregivers of patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing HSCT. Therefore, a potential benefit of the 
proposed research to human subjects is that participants may experience benefits from receiving the intervention 
as they reflect and share positive experiences in  their lives. As part of the intervention , participants  will be given 
the opportunity to identify positive emotions and consider ways to enhance their own positive emotions. 
Description of the PP exercises may enlighten them as to potential means of improving their own emotional 
states  and well -being . Additionally, some participants may enjoy the opportunity to complete study measures 
and reflect on the illness experience  of the patient . Some may also value the possibility that their contribution to 
the study may benefit other caregivers of patients with serious illnesses . It is also possible that some participants

Patients with Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing H ematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  
 
 Page 23 of 31  
may not derive these benefits. However, the risk from participation in the study is small (and will be minimized 
by [CONTACT_406660]), and overall risk to benefit ratio is favorable.  
 
15.0 Vulnerable Populations  
 
Not Applicable. This trial does not involve vulnerable populations including pregnant women, prisoners, adults 
who cannot consent, children or patients with cognitive difficulties.  
 
16.0 Community -Based Participatory Research  
 
Not Applicable. This trial does not involve community -based participatory research  
 
17.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects*  
 
Given the nature of the population included in the study, it is not appropriate to proactively contact [CONTACT_884445]. We anticipate that a proportion of  the p atients  our caregivers are caring for  may 
die during or within months of completing the study. We do not wish to cause unnecessary distress to caregiver s 
by [CONTACT_884446]. Therefore, we provide the 
research team contact [CONTACT_884447].  We hope to publish the results from the study in peer 
review journal articles but data will be de -identified  – participants  will be made aware of the fact that the results 
will be published.  
 
18.0 Setting  
 
18.1 Location  
 
As stated previously in the recruitment and enrollment procedures (section 5.1), caregivers of patients who are 
adult (age ≥18) and English speaking recruited from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) HSCT Program 
will be eligible for the study. Eligible study participants will be identified using the DFCI HSCT database. 
Caregivers  will be contact[CONTACT_884448]’s HSCT hospi[INVESTIGATOR_884426] [ADDRESS_1237349] and no research will be 
conducted outside the DFCI or its affiliates.  
 
19.0 Resources Available  
 
19.1 Team Qualification and oversight  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Proof -of-Concept Trial of a P ositive Psychology Intervention for Caregivers of 
Patients with Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing H ematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  
 
 Page [ADDRESS_1237350] ([CONTACT_102972]) is responsible for full oversight of the project. She will be meeting with the 
CRCs  on a weekly basis (and more often as urgent issues arise) to ensure the study process is being followed 
accurately and to address potential challenges or issues as they may arise. [CONTACT_102972] is a member of the 
MGH Cancer Outcomes Research Program (CORe). CORe h as extensive experience conducting clinical trials 
of supportive care interventions in oncology and has the necessary expertise to e nsure the success of the 
proposed project. [CONTACT_102972] is also a member of the MGH Cardiac Psychiatry Research Program (CPRP) 
which has extensive expertise in conducting positive psychology based intervention studies in patients with 
serious illnesses – resources from the CPRP will help to ensure the success of the project.  
 
19.[ADDRESS_1237351] program performs approximately 550 transplantations per year. We anticipate that  10% of 
caregivers  would be ineligible for study participation. Therefore, we will have approximately [ADDRESS_1237352] successfully enrolled >50% of potentially 
eligible patients in our prior studies . We therefore  conservatively estimate enrolling at least 50% of eligible 
patients and their caregivers to meet our recruitment goal of approximately 25 subjects  – enrolling 3-[ADDRESS_1237353]. Amonoo currently has 75% of her time protected to conduct research activities.   
 
If participants exhibit distress due to study procedures, both the PI [INVESTIGATOR_884427].  If participants report acute medical symptoms, they will be directed to emergency 
medical care, and their primary medical and transplant oncologists may be contact[CONTACT_122124]. If the 
patient is at imminent risk to self -harm, the study PI, psychiatrist, wi ll take all needed steps to ensure 
emergent psychiatric evaluation, which may include ensuring evaluation in the nearest emergency ro om. 
 
Participants will be informed of these measures to ensure confidentiality —and the limits of 
confidentiality, such as arranging for emergent medical or psychiatric care if safety is at imminent risk —
as part of the informed consent process. However, given th at this is a medical rather than a psychiatric 
population we anticipate the rate of suicidality in this population will be low.   
 
20.[ADDRESS_1237354] objections to their patients’  and caregivers  
participating in the study, the CRC will document the reason and not approach those individuals. If the 
transplant clinicians have no objections, the CRC will approach patients  and their caregivers  for study 
participation.

Patients with Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing H ematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  
 
 Page [ADDRESS_1237355] consent visit or with patient permission over the phone shortly after this visit  or during patient’s 
HSCT hospi[INVESTIGATOR_884428]. Upon agreement to participate 
in the study, participants will complete baseline assessments and receive a study intervention manual . 
Participants  will also be given the option to complete self -assessment questio nnaires via phone or mail or in-
person during their routine follow -up visit in clinic . Caregivers  who refuse study participation will be asked the 
reason for deferring.  
 
Caregivers  who complete informed consent and complete baseline questionnaires will then registered with the 
Clinical Trials Management System. If p articipants  provide consent, but do not complete baseline questionnaire, 
they will not count towards accrual numbers. DF/HCC institutions will register eligible participants in the 
Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) Oncore as required by [CONTACT_102927]/HCC SOP REGIST -101. Registration 
must occur prior to the initiation of protocol -specific procedures or assessments.  
 
For registration of patients from DF/HCC institutions, study staff will complete the DF/HCC protocol -specific 
eligibility checklist using the eligibility assessment documented in the participant’s medical record and/or 
research chart. Study staff will conf irm that the participant meets all inclusion criteria as described in this 
protocol and the criteria on the eligibility checklist.  
 
22.[ADDRESS_1237356] been obtained and data analysis has been completed as discussed previously.  
 
Participants’ responses to survey questions will remain confidential unless there is active suicidal ideation 
confirmed by [CONTACT_5051]. Under these circumstances, the study CRC will inform the PI. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_884429], psychiatry and/or take further action as deemed necessary.  
 
During  the informed verbal consent process, it will be emphasized to the  participant  that at any time  during the 
research, they are free to say they will not participate in the study. Their decision to participate in any part of the 
study will not in any way  interfere with their patients’ care at the DFCI.  We will also emphasize that only study 
staff will have access to the data . 
 
It will be emphas ized throughout the study that participants should not feel obligated to  answer any questions 
that is asked of them that causes uneasiness.  
 
24.0 Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Proof -of-Concept Trial of a P ositive Psychology Intervention for Caregivers of 
Patients with Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing H ematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  
 
 Page 26 of 31  
With the Oppenheimer Grants Program  funding we will renumerate participant with a $ [ADDRESS_1237357] or quality of care received. The CRC  will also 
clarify the potential minimal risks associated with the study: brea ch of confidentiality and feelings of distress 
from answering questions of a personal or sensitive nature , as well as possibly feeling 
inconvenienced/distressed when using the accelerometer . To ensure ongoing consent, the CRC will explain the 
participant’s right to withdraw at any time and will explain the appropriate means of contact[CONTACT_884449].  
 
Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process (consent will not be obtained, required information will not be 
disclosed, or the research involves deception) : Written informed consent will not be obtained. Instead, verbal 
consent will be obtained, and participants’ willingness to partake in the study  will be indicative of consent. We 
advocate for a waiver of written informed consent because this study is no more than minimal risk and the goal 
is to prioritize patient safety and reduce their exposure to study staff in the setting of the ongoing  COVID 
pandemic. For the nature of this study, remote consenting is not feasible  for our cohort as it requires a level of 
technical knowledge and maybe burdensome for some caregivers . Electronic consenting may also result in a 
selection bias in participation procedures. Lastly, in the setting of the pandemic, patients  (especially those who 
are immunocompromised like our cohort)  are increasingly conducting virtual visits with their oncology 
clinicians, limiting our ability to effectively conduct in -person consent procedures  with their caregivers . As part 
of the verbal consent proc ess, a study information sheet will mailed to all study participants in the study.  
 
27.0 Process to Document Consent in Writing  
 
As stated earlier , written informed consent will not be obtained. Instead, verbal consent will be obtained, and 
participants’ willingness to partake in the study will be indicative of consent. We advocate for a waiver of 
written informed consent because this study is no more  than minimal risk and the goal is to prioritize patient 
and caregiver safety and reduce their exposure to study staff in the setting of the ongoing COVID pandemic  and 
intermittent restrictions on caregivers accompanying patients with their visits . For the  nature of this study, 
remote consenting is not feasible for our cohort as it requires a level of technical knowledge and maybe 
burdensome for some caregivers . Electronic consenting may also result in a selection bias in participation 
procedures.  
 
28.0 Drugs or Devices  
 
No drugs or devices will be utilized in this study.

[ADDRESS_909341]  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common, morbid condition. Anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic strokes is a foremost priority in AF but adherence is challenging for patients and lapses in anticoagulation are common. Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a recognized program to enhance self-efficacy and improve adherence, quality of life, and patient-centered health outcomes. Rural patients with AF experience increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes due to geographic and social isolation, poor health care access, and limited health literacy. Study team will conduct a single-center parallel group randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of a relational agent to improve patient-centered care in AF delivered by [CONTACT_10753]. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_672783] – a computer character that simulates face-to-face conversation using voice, hand gesture and gaze cues to provide education, monitoring and problem-solving – to improve health behaviors and outcomes in individuals with limited computer and health literacy. Here, the team will expand its successful 30-day relational agent pi[INVESTIGATOR_672784] a novel CDSM program for AF. This study will combine the relational agent with the AliveCor Kardia smartphone heart rate and rhythm monitor. The team will implement a 4-month CDSM curriculum and assess its sustainability at 8 and 12 months. The trial randomizes 264 patients with AF who are receiving anticoagulation for stroke prevention to (1) the relational agent and Kardia intervention, accompanied by [CONTACT_672813]; or (2) the control, consisting of an AF educational session and a smartphone with a general health application (WebMD). Our aims are: (1) To assess the effect of the relational agent and Kardia intervention on anticoagulant adherence, as determined by [CONTACT_510591] (PDC), and self-report. (2) To identify the effect of the intervention on health care utilization, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], emergency visits, and AF-related procedures at 1-year follow up. (3) To determine the effect of the intervention on the patient-centered outcomes of quality of life and symptoms, as measured by [CONTACT_672814] (AFEQT) measure, specific to AF, and the general Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29 Profile at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months. (4) To examine mechanisms for the effect of the intervention by [CONTACT_672815], AF classification, health literacy and intervention use. The trial will additionally follow the cohort through the study period for exploratory analyses of rurality and outcomes associated with AF. Expected Results: In this project we will evaluate a scalable patient-centered intervention to improve anticoagulation adherence, health care utilization and patient-centered outcomes in vulnerable rural individuals with chronic AF. If proven successful, this intervention can be broadly disseminated to improve the care of patients with AF.  BACKGROUND Standard care is insufficient to address the combined challenges of AF, its complex symptoms and treatments, and the social determinant and health literacy obstacles that exacerbate outcomes with the condition. This study team has developed a novel, practical mHealth intervention that is accessible to high-risk patients such as those with limited social resources or health literacy.

 2. STUDY RATIONALE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESEARCH a) AF prevalence is estimated to reach [ADDRESS_909342] increased 1.6-fold since 1999.10 Among Medicare beneficiaries, the mortality rate following a diagnosis of AF is 19.5% at 1 year and 48.8% at 5 years.11 Even on optimal therapy, patients experience a stroke rate of 1.5%, heart failure of 4-5%, and mortality of 3% per year.[ADDRESS_909343] aims to reduce the morbidity and social costs of AF. b) Poor medication adherence results from the complex interaction between patients, their social environment, and the health care system and professionals.[ADDRESS_909344] higher unemployment and poverty rates, lower educational attainment,19 higher rates of low health literacy, less access to health care services,20 and worse control of cardiovascular disease and AF risk factors (hypertension, obesity, diabetes).21,22 Our program promotes longitudinal, patient-centered strategies for rural patients to overcome adherence challenges.23 c) Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) provides a paradigm for patients to establish practical strategies to negotiate the long-term self- care required to succeed with a disease such as AF.24-29 CDSM incorporates education and behavior change strategies. The general tenets of CDSM are: (1) patient-centered education on the causes and complications of chronic disease; (2) understanding medications; (3) managing common symptoms; (4) skills for partnership with physicians and the care team; and (5) self- assessment of goals for health-related quality of life (HRQoL). CDSM is available in only 8% of rural counties.30 The relational agent addresses the limitations of prior interventions to provide virtual CDSM and bridge the rural health divide. d) AF is a chronic disease with extensive symptoms, adverse outcomes, and resulting poor HRQoL. Anticoagulation is a mainstay of AF treatment but demands long-term – likely lifelong – daily adherence with concomitant monitoring for bleeding. AF symptoms are reported to diminish HRQoL, subjective health, and functional status. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393], patients described the effects of AF on general HRQoL: “It’s miserable…you never know when it’s going to hit…you’re physically drained…it scares me to death every day…I could have a stroke, it’s just a scary thing.” National and international guidelines emphasize improved social determinants exacerbate worse HRQoL and outcomes in AF. Our intervention addresses the poor HRQoL in AF that stems from symptoms, treatment burden, and clinical uncertainty. It is designed to empower patients, ameliorate health literacy related barriers to self-management, and improve patient-centered outcomes for vulnerable patients with AF. e) The relational agent is a mobile health (mHealth) application for patient education, monitoring and problem-solving. It is a virtual agent that uses interactive conversation for health counseling and guidance. We have extensive experience developi[INVESTIGATOR_672785]-management and HRQoL (e.g., 
5  
 R01AG028669, 1R01HL081307, NCI 5R21CA127511, R01HL116448). The agent speaks with synthetic speech accompanied by [CONTACT_672816], empathic counseling, and monitoring. The patient engages by [CONTACT_672817]. Patients converse with the agent, develop an empathic therapeutic alliance, and report/record across domains of CDSM. The relational agent (a) elicits symptoms and (b) gestures to enhance educational content. The intervention here integrates the relational agent with the AliveCor Kardia (Mountain View, CA) smartphone heart rate and rhythm monitor to guide Kardia use and enhance CDSM in AF. f) Our relational agent/Kardia intervention improves the current paradigm for rural AF care24 by [CONTACT_672818]: (1) Enhance patient-centered resources. AF is a complex condition that requires long-term patient engagement31-34 and the relational agent serves as an empathic coach to improve the patient experience of this chronic disease. We provide a non- pharmacologic, non-invasive approach that is accessible to patients, patient-centered, and disease-specific. (2) Synergize the relational agent/Kardia. Relational agent content prompts use of the Kardia when users report symptoms. The relational agent can correlate symptoms with heart rate and rhythm, improve symptom characterization, and guide CDSM to improve multiple patient-centered domains assessed by [CONTACT_33230]-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instrument used here.35 (3) Increase health-related attention. Rural individuals often have less access to resources for adherence support and disease-specific education.[ADDRESS_909345] of the relational agent/Kardia intervention on anticoagulant adherence. We will quantify adherence to anticoagulation with (a) proportion of days covered (PDC) obtained from pharmacy data, and (b) self-report, at 4, 8, and 12 months. Hypothesis: Intervention participants will have better anticoagulant adherence than control arm participants as measured by [CONTACT_235945]-reported assessments of adherence.  3.[ADDRESS_909346] of the intervention on health care utilization (HCU). We will quantify 12-month HCU for intervention administration. Hypothesis: Intervention participants will have lower HCU events compared to control arm participants. 3.[ADDRESS_909347] on QualiTy of life (AFEQT) instrument (specific to HRQoL in AF) and the Patient- Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 Profile. Hypothesis: 
[ADDRESS_909348] of the intervention. We will determine how patient- centered baseline factors including sex, race, health literacy, AF classification (paroxysmal versus chronic), and symptom burden moderate the intervention effect, and how intervention engagement and use, change in symptom burden, and AF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_672786]. 4. STUDY DESIGN 4.[ADDRESS_909349] of a smartphone-based intervention on health outcomes in people with the heart disease called atrial fibrillation. The study will enroll 264 patients residing in rural municipalities (defined as “rural” by [CONTACT_672819]) with this condition and randomize them to the intervention or control. Intervention participants will receive a smartphone with an application (or app) called a relational agent, which simulates conversation. In addition, they will receive an AliveCor Kardia for heart rate and rhythm monitoring, an FDA-approved, widely used instrument that pairs with the smartphone. Control participants will receive a smartphone with a general health application (WebMD) and they will not receive an AliveCor Kardia device. The intervention will last [ADDRESS_909350] to evaluate the efficacy of the relational agent and AliveCor Kardia heart rhythm monitor to improve patient-centered outcomes in patients with the debilitating chronic condition atrial fibrillation (AF). We will recruit [ADDRESS_909351] Pennsylvania. We will randomize participants 1:1 to receive the mobile relational agent and Kardia (n=132) or control (n=132) for [ADDRESS_909352] used in prior RCTs. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_672820] (warfarin or direct acting oral anticoagulant). We will assess the impact of our intervention at 4, [ADDRESS_909353] whether the relational agent and Kardia intervention can improve adherence to anticoagulation as quantified by [CONTACT_672821]- report. Our secondary hypotheses will evaluate 1) assessments of health care utilization between the intervention and control; 2) the improvement in health-related quality of life at 4, 8, and 12 months compared to the control, as measured by [CONTACT_672822], validated quality of life assessments; and 3) the mechanisms for the effect of the intervention, as evaluated by [CONTACT_672823]. All participants will have return visits at 4, 8, and 12 months. The outcomes will all be calculated without reference to intervention arm. We will use the intention-to-treat principle for all primary and secondary analysis. All analyses will be blinded to trial randomization arm. Statistical approach for Aim 1. The primary outcome for Aim 1 is anticoagulant adherence as assessed by [CONTACT_584904]. We will use the intention-to-treat principle for all primary and secondary 
7  
 analyses. We will analyze PDC as continuous (range 0-1, higher ratio indicating better adherence) and binary (optimally adherent if ≥0.8) variables. We will assess differences between the 2 study arms in PDC at 12 months with linear regression (for continuous PDC) or logistic regression (for binary PDC) adjusting for trial stratification factor (as suggested by [CONTACT_672824]37). We will conduct our secondary assessments of adherence at 4 8, and 12 months similarly. We will categorize individuals scoring ≥2 on any of the 3 self-report adherence items (range 1-5, Voils et al.38) as nonadherent. To assess whether the effect of the intervention changes over time, we will use linear (for continuous measures) or non-linear (for categorical measures) mixed-effect models with random intercepts with adherence measures modeled as a function of study arm, study visit and their interaction. We calculated the statistical power to detect a range of difference in PDC (our primary outcome) between the intervention and control arms. After accounting for 10% attrition through 12 months (consistent with our prior RCTs), we determined that a sample size of [ADDRESS_909354] a minimum difference in PDC between the two groups as small as 11.7% with 85% power (assuming a SD=30%). Our power calculations assume use of 2-sided tests with 0.05 significance level. With an additional, unexpected 10% attrition (n=106 per arm, to accommodate for relocation, loss-to- follow-up, institutionalization, or death), we will be able to detect a minimum difference in PDC as small as 12.4% (0.41 standardized mean difference) with 85% power. Both are considered small effect sizes per Cohen’s guidelines.[ADDRESS_909355] (EHR) in concert with 4-, 8-, and 12-month self-report to catalog events (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency room and ambulatory visits, medications, and procedures) and classify them as related to AF. We will determine person-year of follow-up as starting from the date of randomization to the 12-month visit. We will then classify HCU in aggregate and by [CONTACT_672825]. We will use generalized estimating equations (GEE) negative binomial regression models (chosen instead of Poisson regression due to expected over-dispersion in the data). Similar approaches will be used to assess counts for each HCU component. Based on preliminary data from an outpatient registry of individuals with chronic AF, we expect there will be 42.[ADDRESS_909356] 85% power to detect a minimum absolute reduction of 21 events per 100 person-years in the intervention group, assuming an equivalent number of events in the control group at 12 months with a sample size of 132 per arm. A 20% attrition in study participation (n=106 per arm) at [ADDRESS_909357] a minimum of absolute reduction of 23 events per 100 person-years in the intervention group with 85% statistical power. As exploratory analyses, we will perform survival analyses to compare the time to event between the intervention and control arms for preselected outcomes: AF-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency visit, or procedure; myocardial infarction; heart failure; stroke; and all- cause mortality. Participants will contribute 18 to 51 months of follow-up; those without the event of interest will be censored at the end of follow-up. We will examine the assumption of proportional hazards and use Cox regression models to estimate the hazards ratio for assigned treatment for each outcome. Statistical approach for Aim 3. We estimate that patients randomized to our intervention will have a clinically relevant improvement in HRQoL as demonstrated by [CONTACT_672826] 4-months follow-up vs. control. Our demonstration cohort (N=31) had a mean increase in AFEQT global score of 12±16 (from 64±23 to 76±19) over 30 days (range 0-100, greater scores indicating superior HRQoL). We will use linear regression adjusted for trial stratification factors and the baseline score as per Harrell41 to evaluate the differences in AFEQT global and domain-specific scores between study arms at [ADDRESS_909358] at 8 and 12 months using linear mixed models. Our power calculations assume a 90% 4-month assessment completion rate (to accommodate for 10% attrition), 2-tailed α=0.05, and standard deviation of 17 (representing the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the SD and consistent with the data used to determine the minimum important difference42). Based on these assumptions, we expect our sample size (119 per arm) will enable us to detect a minimum difference in AFEQT between the two study arms at [ADDRESS_909359] size.39 A 20% sample size attrition (n=106 per arm) at [ADDRESS_909360] by [CONTACT_672827]-centered factors: (1) sex; (2) race (white vs non-white); (2) health literacy, assessed using the Newest Vital Sign (NVS); (3) AF classification (paroxysmal vs permanent), (4) symptom burden, measured by [CONTACT_672828]; (5) anticoagulant type (warfarin or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)); (6) self-reported anticoagulant nonadherence (<2 or ≥2); and (7) duration of anticoagulation (<1 or ≥1 year). We will formally test for effect modification by [CONTACT_40397] a regression model for each outcome including the subgroup variable, the intervention assignment and the interaction between the subgroup variable and intervention and evaluating the significance of the interaction term. The false discovery rate43 will be used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Causal mediation analyses will be used to determine the degree to which intermediate patient-level factors explain the intervention effect as potential mediators of the primary and secondary outcomes.44-[ADDRESS_909361] effects of the intervention on outcomes accounting for (1) changes in symptom burden during follow-up, measured by [CONTACT_672828]; (2) introduction of new AF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_660488] 12-month study participation (antiarrhythmic, cardioversion or electrophysiologic study); (3) relational agent and Kardia usage; and (4) EHR alerts. Instead of emphasizing p-values, we will focus on estimation of mediation effect sizes. Race and sex. We will ensure our study cohort is 50% women and 30% non-white race, of whom 80% (24% overall) will be black race. (1) We have reviewed47 AF is less prevalent in blacks48-50 but associated with worse outcomes54 (2) Women have worse HRQoL and increased stroke risk than men.51-53 (3) We have developed strategies to oversample participants of black race and female sex. Although the current trial is not specifically design to assess racial/sex variability in the intervention effect, since the overall effect has not yet been established, subgroups analyses among all race/sex groups will set the stage for further studies that focus on racial/sex effects. We note our statistical power for such trial participation: (1) if we randomize [ADDRESS_909362] 85% power to detect a 22.8% PDC difference between trial arms. (2) Similarly, if we randomize 135 women, 51% of trial participants, then we will have 85% power to detect a 15.6% difference between trial arms. 6.[ADDRESS_909363], admin staff, PCPs, nursing staff

 and care managers at the UPMC clinics. They will visit these UPMC sites to introduce the study and present several educational discussions about the Atrial Fibrillation and the importance of this study for these patients as well as develop personal relationships with these clinic personnel. During these visits, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_672787] a newsletter which will briefly describe the study and will do a short presentation to clinicians and their staff. Study team will also include the following recruitment strategies:  1) Study staff will screen the EHR to identify potentially eligible participants. Study staff will then notify clinic practice managers and/or clinicians which patients with upcoming appointments are potentially eligible for the study. On the day of scheduled appointment, clinic staff will notify potential participants that study staff will meet with them to introduce the study. After learning about the study, those wishing to participate will be consented and enrolled.  2) Study staff will mail recruitment letters to eligible participants. They will follow-up with a phone call and/or email these potentially eligible participants. If the eligible participants are interested, study staff will conduct the 6-item screening to ensure that the participant meets eligibility criteria. Those who meet all eligibility criteria will be mailed a hard copy of the consent form, medical and pharmacy release of information forms, and the baseline survey. Study staff will schedule their baseline visit phone call at a time that is preferred by [CONTACT_672829]. Those eligible patients who are interested will be informed about the current study, and for those wishing to participate, verbal informed consent will be administered by [CONTACT_464].  3) Patient-centered brochures and posters will be placed in clinic waiting areas and in patient examination rooms. These materials will summarize the research study and will include study contact [CONTACT_672830].  4) The study team will receive lists of potentially eligible patients from R3, which is a service of the Department of Biomedical Informatics. Potentially eligible patients will also be accumulated from a UPMC AFib diagnosis list, and will use those lists to screen the EHR of said patients for eligibility.  5) The study team will have a study website (https://aflitt.pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887].edu) which will provide a direct portal for candidate participants and referring providers to communicate with study staff. Individuals will have the opportunity via the website to receive an electronic survey for first-pass eligibility assessment. 6) Study team will leverage the web-based research portal of the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]+me, pi[INVESTIGATOR_672788].com, https://www.facebook.com/pi[INVESTIGATOR_583379]/)/ which provides an accessible listing of research studies accompanied by [CONTACT_672831]. The CTSI Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]+Me team can screen candidate participants and direct them to study group if they are eligible. Participants who contact [CONTACT_672832][INVESTIGATOR_32887]+Me will be scheduled for their baseline visit. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]+Me will also mail newsletters to candidates living in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_672789]. Recruitment will be conducted by [CONTACT_672833].

 7. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Fig 1. Participant screening through Randomization Process  
 7.1 Pre-Screening  To identify potentially eligible participants:  1) Screening for eligibility will be performed by [CONTACT_672835]. Study staff will screen the EHR to identify these potentially eligible participants. 2) The study may also use R3, which is a service of the Department of Biomedical Informatics. R3 will create a list of patients who meet the study’s inclusion criteria and provide the list to study staff. Study staff will then verify the participant’s eligibility by [CONTACT_672836] “EHR Screening Form” checklist. 3) Participants can also contact [CONTACT_672837] (via phone call, email, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]+Me, study website) to express interest in participating in the study. Study staff will then screen the EHR to determine if the participant is eligible. Study staff can then schedule an appointment to talk with potential study candidate to provide more information about the study/consent participant. 4) If non-UPMC patients contact [CONTACT_672838], they will confirm with the patient that they will need to check the patient’s eligibility by [CONTACT_53828]. If the non-UPMC medical records are available in 

12  
 "EPIC Care Anywhere" (an option in EPIC that links to other healthcare systems that are also using EPIC), study staff will check their medical history to confirm eligibility. However, if their medical records are not available in EPIC Care Anywhere, study staff will request the participant to sign a medical release form to receive the necessary medical information to determine eligibility.  In-person recruitment: Study staff will then notify clinic practice managers and/or clinicians which patients with upcoming appointments are potentially eligible for the study. On the day of scheduled appointment, clinic staff will notify potential participants that study staff will meet with them to introduce the study. After learning about the study, those wishing to participate will be consented and enrolled.  Virtual recruitment: Study staff will also mail recruitment letters to these potentially eligible participants and will follow up with call and/or email. If they are interested, they will provide their verbal consent and complete the 6-item screening item to confirm eligibility. Study staff will then mail hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_377147], medical and pharmacy release forms, and the baseline survey. Study staff will then schedule their baseline visit phone call at a time that is preferred by [CONTACT_672829]. Those eligible patients who are interested will provide their verbal consent and complete the baseline survey. 7.2 Screening at Baseline Participants who are screened to be eligible will be scheduled to either meet with a study recruiter (Research Assistant/ Project Manager) or have a scheduled phone call with a study recruiter. Individuals who agree to participate will provide their verbal agreement and this will be noted in the “Clinic Screening Form” and will undergo a 6-item screener consisting of being asked to repeat and remember [ADDRESS_909364] (IRB) for approval. The written consent document will embody the elements of informed consent as described in the International Conference on Harmonisation and will also comply with local regulations. The informed consent will be completed online using a tablet that is provided by [CONTACT_5051], or will be given by [CONTACT_672839] a study team member during their baseline call. However, if a paper version will also be made available for use only when the online version cannot be accessed (e.g. no available tablets, no internet access, unable to access the REDCap system, etc.). Or, if a participant gives verbal consent over the phone to a study team member, they will sign and return a paper version of the consent for to the study team. If a paper version is completed, either in place of a virtual consent or if given verbally, then this paper consent form will be scanned and saved as a PDF and attached to the participant’s record. The paper version of the form will also be stored in a locked filing cabinet, behind two locked office doors. In-person consent: The informed consent will be conducted in a private location to respect subject privacy. Following the briefing of the research study, the study recruiter will provide the subject ample time to read the consent and study recruiter will answer any of their questions regarding the document. Prior to the subject’s participation in the study, the study recruiter will ensure that the participant understand the research study and their role in the study. They will be made aware of their responsibilities during the baseline visit, after randomization assignment, and 
[ADDRESS_909365]. Informed consent will be obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP, US Code of Federal Regulations for Protection of Human Subjects (21 CFR 50.25[a,b], CFR 50.27, and CFR Part 56, Subpart A), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA, if applicable), and local regulations. Verbal consent: Potentially eligible participants who are interested in participating in the study but unable to meet with a study recruiter, will be able to complete the consent and the baseline survey over the phone. Study staff will mail the consent form prior to calling the participant so that the participant will have ample time to read the consent form and understand the research study. Medical Release Form After the participant has e-signed the informed consent form, the study staff will review the Authorization to Use and Disclose Health Information form with the participant (in person or over the phone). This form is to be signed by [CONTACT_672840]. This Authorization to Use and Disclose Health Information form has an expi[INVESTIGATOR_243396] 12 months. Therefore, we will ask participants to sign 2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_672790] (one with the current date and another post-dated) to ensure that we get a whole year of pharmacy record information. The study participant will also be asked to sign two copi[INVESTIGATOR_672791], in the event that the participant is admitted to a non-UPMC hospi[INVESTIGATOR_672792]. 7.4 Survey Process Once the participant has provided their written or verbal consent, the participant will complete the survey. The surveys are to be completed at baseline, 4-, 8-, and 12-months after randomization. The surveys are to be completed online using the study tablet or over the phone with a study staff. Paper versions of the surveys (see Table 1 for assessments completed at each visit) will be mailed to participants who prefer to complete the surveys over the phone with a study staff. Each survey will have a “Q by Q” guide (specifying responses to sample questions participants may have for each question/item) for staff to refer to if participants raise questions during form completion supporting consistency. 7.5 Randomization Participants meeting all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of 2 groups, a control and an intervention group. To ensure flexibility in achieving the proposed allocation of patients between study arms, permuted block randomization will be used. Additionally, randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_672841], (warfarin or DOAC) as DOACs do not require monitoring and are associated with fewer major bleeding events compared to warfarin. If the participant is randomized to the treatment group, he or she will receive the ECA+Kardia app/hardware that will come pre-loaded onto a study iPhone that will be returned at the end of 
14  
 the study. These study iPhones will either be mailed or provided to the participant in person. Participants randomized to control will receive an educational session (over the phone or in person) and a brochure published by [CONTACT_672842]. Control participants will receive an Apple smartphone (identical to that received by [CONTACT_672843]) with the WebMD (www.webmd.com/mobile) application installed and directions for its use. The WebMD app provides general health content and can be used for enhanced self-care. We will inform control participants that they may use the WebMD app to track symptoms and record and learn about their medications for AF and other conditions. 7.6 Blinding This is a parallel-arm, randomized clinical trial. Neither the study participants nor the study staff will be blinded to assignment to intervention or control arm. The baseline and 4-follow-up visits will be completed either in person or over the phone with a study staff member. 7.7 Intervention   FIG 2. RELATIVE AGENT An example of a screen shot of the relational agent and a clinical encounter menu  Relational Agent The relational agent is a mobile health (mHealth)[ADDRESS_909366]. Bickmore has developed over 25 health interventions in which the relational agent is designed to foster a sense of therapeutic alliance. The relational agent speaks with synthetic speech accompanied by [CONTACT_672816], emphatic counseling and monitoring. The patient engages by [CONTACT_672817] (FIG 2). Patients thereby [CONTACT_672844], develop empathic therapeutic alliance, and report/record across domains of self-care. To adapt the relational-agent intervention specifically to this study population, in-depth interviews will be conducted with potential study participants prior to the start of recruitment. The interviews will capture anecdotal evidence regarding clinical encounters, barriers to care and medication adherence, and general experience living with atrial fibrillation that will inform content development and delivery. In addition, preferences for the relational agent’s physical persona will be queried. We integrate the relational agent with the AliveCor Kardia (Mountain View, CA) smartphone heart rate and rhythm monitor to guide Kardia use and enhance AF self-care monitoring.

 Kardia  The AliveCor (Kardia) is a FDA-approved, heart-rhythm monitor that is accessed via smartphone application. The device is attached to the smartphone and provides a lead I ECG rhythm strip with 30 seconds of finger placement on two poles (FIG 3), like metallic buttons (there is no electric current and participants have an experience analogous to the performance of a standard 10- second, 12-lead electrocardiogram used in routine clinical practice). The tracings are uploaded to a secure web-based portal with time stamps of use, duration of use, and heart rate and rhythm (sinus of AF). The Kardia has been principally used for AFib detection. The Kardia app will be downloaded to the participant’s study provided iPhone from the App Store. Study staff will create their Kardia account using the the participant’s first name, and substituting their last name [CONTACT_4490] “####” (where #### represents the participant’s assigned study ID). The date of birth, height and weight for every participant will be the same information (to ensure that study staff won’t enter identifying information). The study staff will assist the participant in running a sample EKG on their smartphone by [CONTACT_672845] 30 seconds (pi[INVESTIGATOR_280915]). They will also explain to the participant that he/she will not be able to see the first results immediately; however, the results of all other EKGs taken forward will be recorded immediately. We will instruct participants to use the Kardia a minimum of once daily. Kardia use is tracked automatically and review of the results will be completed by [CONTACT_978], who is a cardiologist and has the expertise to oversee Kardia interpretation (FIG 4).  FIG 3. KARDIA

All reports of utilization will be investigated using hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]. 9 Follow-up Visit Schedule Throughout the duration of baseline to 4 months All participants will receive scheduled check-in calls at study day 7, 14, 30, 60 and 90. These calls will serve to support participants and attend to any difficulties they may be experiencing with the study protocol and/or device(s) they are asked to use daily. Participants who haven’t mailed back their medical release forms will be reminded to do so during these calls. Study staff will maintain relational agent and Kardia results daily on a web-based dashboard developed by [CONTACT_672850][INVESTIGATOR_96466] (EDC). Agent dashboard results will consist of use statistics, reported symptoms, and self- 
[ADDRESS_909372] results will be reviewed daily. 2nd Study follow-up: - +~4 months Participants will complete the 2nd visit at 4 months in person or over the phone if the participant is unable to meet with study staff.

 10 Clinical Trial Oversight and Monitoring 10.1 Data Safety Monitoring This study will recruit subjects at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_45589] (UPMC) who have a chronic heart rhythm disease, atrial fibrillation (AF), and are receiving anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Participants are expected to constitute a high-risk population, as they will live in rural settings, have limited socioeconomic resources, and likely have low health literacy. The study will consist of 264 adults who will be randomized to an intervention or control cohort. The intervention cohort will receive (1) a smartphone with a relational agent application, described in the application as an embodied conversational agent, and (2) the AliveCor Kardia heart rate and rhythm monitor (described here as Kardia for simplicity). Topi[INVESTIGATOR_672795], including symptom monitoring, maintenance, and health-promoting behaviors. The relational agent will also provide education about AF and its treatments and outcomes, and health-related quality of life. The Kardia is an FDA-approved device that also uses the smartphone. It provides [ADDRESS_909375] (DSMB). The DSMB will be charged with evaluating the quality of trial administration, monitoring safety issues, and providing guidance on scientific, methodological and ethical issues. As its first priority, the DSMB will approve and codify the DSMB charter. Following approval by [CONTACT_4318], the charter will be submitted to the NHLBI for review and approval. The DSMB charter will describe the study protocol, data and safety monitoring plan, operation and format of DSMB meetings, Adverse Event (AE) definitions, AE reporting templates and case report forms, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_288872], and a schedule for conducting blinded assessments of study benefit and safety. The DSMB will be valuable for ensuring the quality and scientific validity of the study. It will be comprised of 3 individuals. Members will adhere to the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]’s policy on conflict of interest and are expected to participate for the duration of this clinical trial. The DSMB will have scheduled meetings every 6 months to evaluate and review safety, review any potential breaches in protocol, and discuss summaries of the interim AE and serious adverse event (SAE). The DSMB will make recommendations concerning (1) participant safety, (2) the benefit and risk ratio of the study, (3) the efficacy of the study intervention, (4) any possible amendments to the study protocol or consent, and (5) proposed ancillary studies and their impact on participant burden. Following each meeting, the DSMB will make recommendations on continuation, modification, or 
[ADDRESS_909376] to NHLBI participation. Additional meetings will be arranged as per the charter for the need to review events or issues arise (such as an unexpected number or severity of AE). For safety monitoring, discussion will take place on whether or not any reported incident is unanticipated and/or places subjects or others at greater risk of harm, and if protocols or consent processes need to be modified. The DSMB will review the annual progress report on (1) confirmation of adherence to the data and safety monitoring plan, (2) a summary of data and safety monitoring issues for the since the last report, (3) changes in the research protocol or data and safety monitoring plan, and (4) IRB status and approvals. 10.[ADDRESS_909377] with Federal mandates for human subjects’ protection and adverse event reporting. Identification of AE, SAE, and unanticipated problems. The study team will learn of AE, SAE, and unanticipated problems by [CONTACT_672851] 4-, 8- and 12-month assessments; direct contact [CONTACT_672852]-in calls; review of the electronic health record; communication from referring physicians or participants’ providers; or contact [CONTACT_672853]. Responding to AE, SAE, and unanticipated problems. Study staff will follow guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_32928][INVESTIGATOR_9109]’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the Human Research Protection Office. The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_672796], serving as the Data Coordinating Center (EDC) for the trial, will develop AE case report forms specific to this trial. The project manager and PI [INVESTIGATOR_672797], and then classify AE within 24 hours of identification using the following criteria: 1. Severity (mild, moderate, severe, life threatening); 2. Relationship to study intervention (not related, unlikely, possibly, probably, or definitely related); 3. Action take regarding study intervention (none, medical intervention, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], intervention discontinued, or other); 4. Outcome of AE (resolved, recovered with minor sequelae, recovered with major sequelae, ongoing or continuing treatment, condition worsening, death, or unknown); 5. Expected AE (yes or no); and 6. Whether the AE constitutes an SAE. All AEs and classification according to these criteria will be maintained in a log and signed by [CONTACT_978]. In accordance with the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_68348], all internal AEs which are (1) unexpected, fatal or life-threatening, and (2) related or possibly related to the relational agent /Kardia intervention will be reported to the IRB within 24 hours of learning of the event.   For this clinical trial, an example of an AE that would merit classification as an SAE would be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. AEs that are classified as SAEs will be further reviewed to determine if (1) they are unexpected, and (2) related or possibly related to the study procedure (relational agent relational agent and AliveCor). SAEs meeting these criteria will be reported to the IRB within 2 business days (48 hours) of learning of the event. In accordance with NHLBI regulations, SAEs 
[ADDRESS_909378] for timely response to the SAE. Unanticipated problems will likewise be reported to the IRB within 24 hours of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_672798]-threatening. The report will explain why the incident is considered an unanticipated problem and how the protocol will be modified. Incidents that do not meet the three criteria for unanticipated problems (unexpected, given the research procedures; related or possibly related to participation in the research; and suggest that the research places participants at a greater risk of harm than previously known or recognized) will be considered as either potential AE or classified as SAE as defined above. Unanticipated problems that are not SAEs will be reported to the IRB and the NHLBI within 14 days of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_245715]. Risk assessment. Participation in the proposed research may be considered moderate risk. This is because (1) the investigation may have direct implications for clinical care; (2) findings identified by [CONTACT_672854]; and (3) recruitment of high-risk populations (i.e., individuals with limited socioeconomic resources, low health literacy, and/or racial/ethnic minorities). As stated in the Informed Consent, use of the relational agent does not replace routine, urgent, or emergent clinical care. Participants in this trial will be instructed NOT to delay seeking care because they are using the relational agent to address a medical problem, question, concern or issue. All AE will be closely evaluated in order to ascertain if the AE is related or possibly related to participation in this research. Participant use of the relational agent and Kardia in proximity to the AE will be scrutinized for whether or not use of the intervention delays participants from seeking care. If necessary, participants will be directly interviewed to appreciate their understanding of the relation of their participation in this research and the occurrence of the AE. The project manager, co- investigators, and PI [INVESTIGATOR_672799]. The results of such examination will be recorded on a unique report form as prepared by [CONTACT_59743][INVESTIGATOR_672800]. An additional risk for participants is loss of confidentiality. The risk of breach of confidentiality is best addressed by [CONTACT_672855]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_672801], transfer, and communications in tracking participants by [CONTACT_672856], reviewing procedures and performing quality control reviews of study forms. Data and safety monitoring for continuation, modification, or termination of participation or the clinical trial. The DSMB will review summaries of AEs, SAEs, and Unanticipated Problems and make recommendations for the continuation, modification or termination of the trial. The trial is not expected to have an early termination. Data Management and Security to Protect Privacy. The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_672796] (EDC) has extensive experience with supervising the conduct and data management of clinical trials and will serve as the data coordinating center (DCC) for this study under the direction of [CONTACT_672863]. Study data will be maintained on University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_672802]. Security and integrity of study resources will be achieved via strictly enforced policies, standards and guidelines which are compliant with federal regulations and guidelines including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Federal Information Security 
[ADDRESS_909379] of 2002 (FISMA) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Access to the data system requires training and certification with respect to protocol, procedure and security. Access to data on EDC servers is managed by [CONTACT_672857]. Study data will be stored on an EDC SQL Server that is behind the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_672803] a server VLAN. Direct access to this database server is restricted and is only available to authorized EDC personnel with appropriate credentials and data privileges. Regularly scheduled backups and archives protect central and local information from hard disk failures. Permanent archives of critical project files are created and are stored in a secure off-site facility to prevent data loss due to catastrophic events. Data collection forms. The EDC will support the research team to develop required protocols, data collection forms and venues for the data collection (e.g., telephone interview, clinic visit). Data collection forms will be designed to ensure protocol compliance, optimize interview flow with branching logic, reduce missing data elements, minimize participant burden in self-reports, and support efficient data collection and analysis processes. Data Management Manual of Operations. The EDC will assist in developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Manual of Operations (MOP) to document all data collection and management procedures for the study. The MOP will include an overall description of the project, the study protocol, data collection procedures (including question by [CONTACT_672858]), and detailed descriptions of all other procedures required to conduct the study. In addition, an internal DCC Manual of Operations (DCC MOP) will be developed. The DCC MOP will provide documentation of the internal procedures, such as the creation of analytic data sets, the generation of reports, and the data freeze. The MOPs will facilitate consistency in protocol implementation and provide some protection against potential disruptions due to personnel turnover. Quality control/Data Collection Monitoring. The DCC will monitor all aspects of study performance and protocol compliance and will be responsible for monitoring the data from all study entities as well as adherence to established adverse event reporting. Electronic data capture methods will be implemented for this study. Study data will be subjected to extensive checks for completeness, accuracy, and consistency including data validations to verify the authenticity of participant IDs, prohibit duplicate record entries, and incorporate range, format, data type checks and alert values. To facilitate monitoring of study performance, data status reports will be generated and reviewed by [CONTACT_672859] a regular basis. These reports will include recruitment and retention, protocol adherence, data quality, and study participant characteristics. Creation of analytic datasets for statistical programming. The statistical programmer and analyst of the data management team will be responsible for cleaning the datasets and preparing the corresponding codebooks and statistical summaries. These datasets will be used to carry out the full range of data analysis activities needed to prepare monitoring reports, abstracts and manuscripts. This will include planning and developi[INVESTIGATOR_672804], statistical programming, and interpreting and summarizing data for internal and DSMB reports. 10.[ADDRESS_909380] will be provided $25 for the baseline visit, $50 for the 4-month follow-up visit, $25 for the 8-month follow up telephone assessment and $[ADDRESS_909381] 12-month telephone assessment as compensation for his/her time. This totals $150 of participant compensation if the entire study is completed.

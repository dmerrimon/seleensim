Adaptive Intervention Strategies to Optimize PrEP Clinical Evaluation and 
Uptake in Stimulant-Using Men
2) Objectives*
The overarching goal of this formative research is to examine whether—and in 
what combination—contingency management (CM) and motivational interviewing 
(MI) can facilitate entry of stimulant-using men who have sex with men (MSM) 
into the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) care continuum. 
Aim 1. Augment CM and MI with content to facilitate entry into the PrEP care 
continuum by [CONTACT_341741]-using MSM. 
Aim 2. Examine the feasibility and acceptability of adaptive treatment strategies 
combining CM with MI to promote clinical evaluation for PrEP, PrEP uptake, 
and PrEP care retention. 
Aim 3. Document implementation factors relevant the scalability  of CM and MI such as 
               perceptions of community-based HIV prevention providers to inform a full-
               scale sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) of the 
               interventions. 
3) Background*
Preliminary Data: There are no relevant preliminary data for this R34 project 
where the primary objective is to obtain preliminary data for a planned R01 
proposal.
Significance: The CDC estimates one-in-six MSM will acquire HIV in their 
lifetime, including one-in-two Black MSM and one-in-four Hispanic/Latino MSM. 
PrEP is highly effective for preventing HIV infection, but many MSM who are at 
elevated risk for HIV are experiencing difficulties with initiating and remaining on 
PrEP. As a biomedical intervention, PrEP offers tremendous protection against HIV 
infection without necessitating changes in sexual behavior. PrEP can also serve as a 
gateway into regular HIV testing as well as comprehensive sexual and mental 
health care. There is an urgent need to augment as well as tailor evidence-based CM 
and MI interventions to facilitate entry of stimulant-using MSM into the PrEP 
continuum.
MSM who use stimulants have been consistently shown to be at a 3-6 fold greater 
risk of HIV seroconversion. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_341727], recent methamphetamine use doubled from 2011-2014 (from 4% to 
9%) among MSM in [LOCATION_001] City (NYC). This trend is corroborated by 
[CONTACT_341742] 2005 peaks. In South

IRB Study Number: 20180823
Version #10.1; April 2023
Page 2 of 15 Revised: April 2023[LOCATION_012], the 12-month prevalence of stimulant use is among the highest nationally 
for MSM: 25% cocaine, 9% ecstasy, 6% crack-cocaine, and 6% methamphetamine. 
Stimulant use is also prevalent in ethnic minority MSM where HIV incidence is the 
highest. For example, we recently observed that one-in-five young black MSM in 
[LOCATION_007] reported stimulant use in the past two months.
Combining CM and MI could optimize HIV prevention in stimulant-using MSM. 
CM is an evidence-based substance use intervention where individuals receive 
tangible rewards as positive reinforcement for stimulant abstinence, which targets 
extrinsic motivation. One enduring concern with CM is the risk for relapse after the 
incentives are discontinued. Because MI explicitly targets intrinsic motivation, it 
could have synergistic, beneficial effects on long-term abstinence if delivered with 
CM. At the same time, MI alone may not adequately address structural factors (e.g., 
transportation) that are key obstacles to HIV prevention with stimulant-using MSM. 
CM incentives could amplify the benefits of MI by [CONTACT_341743]. 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_341728] (i.e., PrEP medical evaluation, PrEP uptake, and early 
PrEP care retention) to facilitate entry into the PrEP care continuum. In Phase I, we 
will implement formative qualitative research by [CONTACT_341744]-depth qualitative interviews 
with stimulant-using MSM. These data will inform our efforts to tailor the CM and 
MI interventions to simultaneously reduce substance use while optimizing 
engagement along the PrEP care continuum. In Phase II, we will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_341729], acceptability, and potential scalability of these motivational 
enhancement approaches.   
4) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria*
Recruitment: PrEP healthcare team members will be recruited via 
professional networks of the study investigators to complete key informant 
interviews regarding barriers and facilitators to delivering PrEP to stimulant-
using MSM. We will recruit stimulant-using MSM for in-depth qualitative 
interviews in Phase I as well as the pi[INVESTIGATOR_341730]. Participants will be recruited 
from a national sampling frame using social networking applications where 
men meet romantic and sexual partners (e.g., Scruff, Grindr). We will also 
recruit participants in South [LOCATION_012] from the community as well as through 
extant registries of HIV- MSM that are managed by [CONTACT_6283]. Carrico and Safren 
at the University of Miami as well as [CONTACT_341771] at the City University of 
[LOCATION_001]. More detailed information regarding our recruitment plan is 
provided below.

Exclusion Criteria for Phase II: Participants will be excluded if they: a) are 
under 18 years of age; b) are not a man who has sex with men; or c) are 
unable to provide informed consent at the assessment visit in English. 
5) Procedures Involved*
Phase I – We will conduct formative qualitative data collection to support our 
efforts to modify the extant CM and MI protocols to include content relevant to the 
PrEP care continuum. Key informant interviews and focus groups with 10-12 PrEP 
healthcare team members (e.g., physicians, nurse practitioners, social workers, and 
benefits navigators) will facilitate our efforts to obtain a more nuanced 
understanding of barriers and facilitators to optimizing the PrEP care continuum in 
stimulant-using MSM. We will also ask PrEP healthcare team members to elaborate 
regarding how they manage the complex care needs of stimulant-using MSM (e.g., 
addressing problematic patterns of stimulant use, safer injection practices, and 
referrals to substance use disorder and mental health treatment). The qualitative

Page 4 of 15 Revised: April 2023interview guide for our work with providers is attached. Because PrEP healthcare 
team members are completing this one time study visit in their professional role, we 
are requesting a waiver of signed informed consent. 
Approximately 30 stimulant-using MSM (15 not currently on PrEP and 15 currently 
taking PrEP) will complete in-depth qualitative interviews to explore the 
perspective of the target population regarding the planned interventions as well as 
barriers and facilitators to navigating the PrEP care continuum. We will purposively 
sample men who are not on PrEP and men who are currently taking PrEP to gain a 
fuller understanding of how participants are navigating distinct aspects of 
navigating the PrEP care continuum (e.g., uptake versus adherence). All 
participants will be asked to comment on what magnitude of incentives would be 
necessary for promoting stimulant abstinence during thrice weekly urine screening 
as well as PrEP medical evaluation and PrEP uptake. The qualitative interview 
guide for these in-depth interviews is attached. Signed informed consent will be 
obtained for all from all in-depth interview participants. Stimulant-using MSM will 
also be asked to provide consent to become part of a consent to contact [CONTACT_341745]. Participants will consent to this in a separate signature [CONTACT_341765] I informed consent. 
Procedures for conducting Phase I key informant interviews and focus groups with 
PrEP healthcare team members as well as in-depth qualitative interviews with 
stimulant-using MSM are outlined below. 
Telephone screen. Stimulant-using MSM will complete a brief telephone screen to 
determine eligibility for completing in-depth interviews based on inclusion criteria 
above (see attached). 
Informed consent. Participants will complete an informed consent that includes 
permission to re-contact [CONTACT_341746]. 
Key informant interviews or focus group with PrEP healthcare team members. 
PrEP healthcare team members will complete a 1 hour interview or join a 1 hour 
focus group about their experiences in providing PrEP and perceptions regarding 
the unique needs of stimulant-using MSM. PrEP healthcare team members will 
receive $[ADDRESS_422865] and time of their choosing. 
In-depth qualitative interviews with stimulant-using MSM.  In-depth interviews 
with stimulant-using MSM will be approximately one hour and cover topi[INVESTIGATOR_341732], attitudes and beliefs about PrEP. Those who are not on 
PrEP will be asked to describe on barriers and facilitators to accessing PrEP. Those 
who are currently taking PrEP will be asked to describe how they successfully

prevention effective PrEP adherence. After completing the interview, participants 
will complete a brief survey to assess demographic information and efforts to 
navigate the PrEP healthcare continuum (see attached). Stimulant-using MSM will 
receive $40 for completing this one time study visit. 
Phase II – We will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_341733] [ADDRESS_422866] not responded to the initial intervention will be randomized 
again to either: 1) continue with assessments only; or 2) switch to the other

procedures relevant to executing this pi[INVESTIGATOR_253225].
Telephone screen. Stimulant-using MSM will complete a brief telephone screen to 
determine eligibility for enrolling in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_341735] (see attached). This telephone screen has been modified to 
include items relevant to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which are also 
attached. The figure below describes the participant flow for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_253225].

concern because participants are not aware of the second-stage interventions until 
the 3-month follow-up assessment. Given these ethical and logistical concerns, we 
believe sequential informed consenting is a reasonable solution.

Page 7 of 15 Revised: April 2023participants over zoom at baseline. We will follow-up with remote HIV testing. 
Participants will be asked to indicate whether they consent to participate in the 
study and continue with the baseline assessment via Zoom. The baseline 
quantitative and qualitative assessment includes a detailed battery of measures and a 
brief in-depth qualitative interview. A codebook of the baseline quantitative 
measures as well as the qualitative interview guide are attached.  Participants will 
receive a $[ADDRESS_422868] or cash application payment for completing this 
assessment.
Remote HIV testing. To ensure that participants meet the inclusion criteria for 
Phase II, they will be asked to complete remote HIV testing by [CONTACT_341747] a saliva 
sample from a kit that our team will send to their home. Participants will receive 
$[ADDRESS_422869] positive for HIV will be excluded from this trial and 
referred for confirmatory testing in their local community.

randomization visit. For those who do not respond to attempts to schedule their 
randomization visit, after [ADDRESS_422870]. Carrico (a 
licensed psychologist) on delivering HIV test results and providing counseling to

for immediate linkage to confirmatory HIV testing. Participants residing in Miami-
Dade county who are test positive for HIV will be referred for confirmatory testing 
and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) with [CONTACT_341772]. 
Randomization visit. Approximately one week after baseline, participants who are 
confirmed to be HIV-negative will attend a separate randomization visit. Those 
randomized to CM will be introduced to incentives for PrEP clinical evaluation and 
uptake. Participants randomized to MI will receive their first session of this 
intervention. All participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_422871] been evaluated for PrEP by a medical provider ($50) and filled a

receive these intervention consistent with the protocols described above. 
Responders will continue with assessments only. Participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_422874] a 30-day window (+1 month) to complete their 
follow-up assessments. 
6-month follow-up assessment. We will re-administer the quantitative measures 
from the baseline assessment and a qualitative exit interview (see attached) via 
zoom. Participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_422875] a 30-day window 
(+1 month) to complete their follow-up assessments.
6) Risks
These study procedures meet the criteria for minimal risk research activities.  
However, possible risks include: 1) a breach of confidentiality; and 2) negative 
psychological reactions to study procedures. 
Breach of Confidentiality.  To mitigate confidentiality risks, all study files are 
located in a locked file cabinet in a secure filing cabinet.  Web-based data collection 
is employed such that all data is collected and stored behind the University of 
Miami firewall. All participants are also informed of mandated reporting guidelines 
for active suicidal/homicidal ideation, child abuse, and elder/dependent adult abuse 
in [LOCATION_012]. Because this study is funded by [CONTACT_4289], our notice of grant award includes 
a Federal certificate of confidentiality for this project to protect against court-
ordered disclosure of study-related information given the highly sensitive nature of

Version #10.1; April 2023
Page 9 of 15 Revised: April 2023the data collected. All assessment interview and intervention activities will be 
conducted via zoom, which is HIPAA compliant. 
Negative Psychological Reactions to Study Procedures.  In our experience, the vast 
majority of participants experience only transient negative reactions to completing 
HIV testing, self-report assessments, or clinical interviews. On rare instances, 
participants have experienced more severe negative reactions to study procedures.  
[CONTACT_100527] is a licensed psychologist in [LOCATION_012]. Data collection for this project will 
be exclusively conducted at the University of Miami. [CONTACT_341771] will assist with data 
collection in Miami and will have access to study data.  
Staff will receive extensive training and supervision to assess participants for signs 
of acute distress during the study visits.  Staff will be trained in a brief screening 
protocol to assess suicidal thoughts, plans and intent.  Specifically, they will 
administer a brief screening tool only where participants display signs of acute 
distress.  Those expressing any current plan or intent to harm themselves or 
someone else will be assessed further by [CONTACT_9154], a licensed psychologist in 
[LOCATION_012]. The vast majority of participants displaying signs of acute distress (e.g., 
crying) will not report any current plan or intent.  Referral sheets are available to 
provide linkages with community-based resources such as mental health treatment 
and substance abuse treatment that may assist participants with managing some of 
the issues that come up in their study activities.  Those who test positive for HIV 
will be immediately linked to confirmatory testing and immediate anti-retroviral 
therapy (ART) with [CONTACT_341772]. We will also work with [CONTACT_341773]-
Lewis to refer any participants who are newly diagnosed with HIV to the 
appropriate case management services at the Miami-Dade County Department of 
Health to assist these individuals with access HIV medical care. 
We acknowledge that participants who learn they test positive for HIV may 
experience acute distress. [CONTACT_100527] is a licensed psychologist and we are 
prepared to provide immediate, on-site support to assist participants in copi[INVESTIGATOR_341736], ensure there is no imminent threat of harm to self or others, and 
coordinate immediate linkage for confirmatory HIV testing. We will also provide 
referrals for community-based mental health treatment tailored specifically to meet 
the needs of those who are newly diagnosed. 
7) Data and Specimen Banking*
There will be no specimen banking in this modified protocol. Saliva samples 
provided by [CONTACT_341748]. These saliva samples will be tested for HIV by a collaborating laboratory 
and then destroyed.

Page 10 of 15 Revised: April [ZIP_CODE]) Data Management*
All patient-reported data will be stored on a secure server and labeled with the 
participant ID number only. Participant files will be completed using Redcap. Any 
paper files will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in [CONTACT_100527]’s office. 
Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we have not conducted a formal power analysis.  In 
fact, there is increasing recognition in clinical research methods that pi[INVESTIGATOR_341737] a more 
definitive study, not effect size estimation.
Feasibility. To evaluate feasibility of a more definitive trial, we will monitor rates 
of recruitment and effort required (e.g. number of staff hours) as well as the number 
of screenings conducted, proportion eligible, and proportion who agree to enroll. 
Feasibility of recruitment will be operationalized as an enrollment rate of 70% or 
higher, an established standard in the literature. We will also record number of 
rescheduled and missed assessment visits, CM visits, and MI sessions to estimate 
staffing needs and retention protocols for a planned R01. Feasibility of intervention 
delivery will be operationalized as attending three-fourths of scheduled MI sessions 
(3 of 4 sessions completed on average). Although power will be limited, we will 
conduct independent samples t-tests to describe the average number of MI sessions 
attended among non-responders randomized to switch (i.e., CM+MI vs. MI+CM). 
Acceptability. To measure acceptability, we will modify previous intervention 
satisfaction evaluation surveys that have been administered to methamphetamine 
users in [CONTACT_100527]’s clinical research. Measures include items such as, “How 
satisfied were you with the program in general?” and “How likely are you to 
recommend this intervention to a friend who uses stimulants?” Independent samples 
t-tests will describe mean acceptability ratings of CM and MI among non-
responders who are randomized to switch (i.e., CM+MI vs. MI+CM). 
Qualitative data will also provide meaningful insights into acceptability of the CM 
and MI interventions. All interviews will be digitally audio-recorded, transcribed 
verbatim, and transferred to Atlas.ti [ADDRESS_422876]. Grov. This program is 
designed for the storage, coding, retrieval, and analysis of qualitative data. Two 
complementary coding schemes will be used: 1) descriptive, which uses words or 
short phrases to summarize passages of data and 2) in vivo, in which actual 
language from participants is used to name [CONTACT_341766]. Extensive analytic 
memos will be written after each interview is conducted, coded, and throughout the 
analysis process to reflect on code choices, emergent themes and patterns, and 
conceptual models. Finally, the data will be themed, in which the final sets of codes 
and their meanings will be transformed into more descriptive themes to organize 
recurrent meanings. 
Quantitative Analyses.  The primary outcome for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_341738]-stage randomization. Secondary

Page 11 of 15 Revised: April 2023outcomes will include: PrEP uptake, early retention in PrEP clinical care, CAS, 
stimulant use (measured via self-report), motivation for PrEP initiation, and 
motivation for avoiding stimulant use. Logistic regression will examine differences 
by [CONTACT_341749]-up. Secondary outcomes involving longitudinal 
trajectories of continuous measures will be tested using multilevel random 
coefficient models (i.e., hierarchical linear modeling; HLM). Multilevel models for 
binary outcomes will be fitted using SAS PROC GLIMMIX with maximum 
likelihood estimation via adaptive quadrature. Exploratory mediation analyses will 
be undertaken using the logic of Kramer to estimate attenuation of the direct 
pathway in the presence of the hypothesized effect modifier in the regression 
model.  
Data Safety and Monitoring Plan.  The University of [LOCATION_004], Los Angeles Data 
Safety and Monitoring Board in Addiction Medicine (DSMB-AM) has agreed to 
serve as the DSMB of record for this trial. The DSMB will hold annual meetings to 
monitor trial progress the DSMB chair will be notified within 72 hours of any 
adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) regardless of whether it is 
judged to be related to study procedures by [CONTACT_3476]. All self-report data will 
be collected using a secure server behind the University of Miami firewall.  Any 
paperwork or data containing identifiers will either be in a secured cabinet in a 
locked office or on a password protected server.  Staff receive extensive training in 
data management and security protocols.  
 
9) Risks to Subjects*
Privacy risks including a breach of confidential information 
Psychological risks including negative reactions to study measures
Legal risks related to forced disclosure of information related to substance 
   use
Social and economic risks related to discrimination if there was a breach of 
confidential information such as substance use
Possible injury from rectal DBS or rectal swab collection
10) Potential Benefits to Subjects*
All participants in this study will receive some form of evidence-based treatment to 
reduce stimulant use (i.e., MI or CM). However, we are uncertain if these 
interventions will yield meaningful benefits for engagement along the PrEP care 
continuum. The proposed research has the potential to advance our understanding 
of promising intervention approaches to simultaneously target stimulant use and 
difficulties with engagement along the PrEP care continuum in MSM. This will be 
one of the first trials to test potentially scalable strategies for optimizing medical

Page 12 of 15 Revised: April 2023evaluation for PrEP and PrEP uptake in a high priority population of stimulant-
using MSM. 
11) Vulnerable Populations*
Although stimulant-using MSM are marginalized and underserved, this population 
is not classified as vulnerable under [ADDRESS_422877] any study procedures with incarcerated participants. 
12) Setting
All study procedures will occur at the University of Miami Miller School of 
Medicine. We will use a national sampling frame to recruit participants from 
social networking applications (e.g., Scruff, Grindr). We also plan to recruit 
participants from South [LOCATION_012] in partnership with local STI and PrEP 
clinics serving MSM in South [LOCATION_012] that are operated by [CONTACT_341750]. [CONTACT_341771] is an 
external collaborator on this project but no data will be collected at his site 
in [LOCATION_001]. He will assist with data collection in Miami as needed and 
have access to study data. 
13) Resources Available
[CONTACT_100527] has extensive expertise in the designing and conducting clinical 
research with stimulant-using MSM.  He has overseen multiple protocols that 
collected biospecimens for specimen banking with substance-using populations.   
14) Prior Approvals
This study was previously submitted to the IRB for approval as part of a just-in-
time (JIT) request. We are modifying this protocol to recruit a national sample and 
to be conducted entirely online due to difficulties with achieving our enrollment 
targets in South [LOCATION_012]. 
15) Recruitment Methods
The primary mechanism for recruiting participants will be using social 
networking applications (e.g., Scruff, Grindr). Participants residing in the 
[LOCATION_002] and Puerto Rico will be directed to a secure Redcap survey 
where the phone screening questions are administered. Participants will be 
asked to provide their contact [CONTACT_3031] (i.e., name, phone number, and 
email) if they wish to be contact[CONTACT_341751].

Version #10.1; April 2023
Page 13 of 15 Revised: April 2023Community-based recruitment will occur broadly in the community using 
palm cards and pull-tab flyers that will be distributed at bars and clubs, 
social media (e.g., Facebook), social networking applications (e.g., Grindr, 
Scruff), medical clinics that prescribe PrEP, referrals from active 
participants, and face-to-face recruitment at community events (e.g., Pride). 
Potentially eligible participants who contact [CONTACT_341752] a 
brief telephone screen or Redcap survey to determine eligibility. Flyers have 
been approved by [CONTACT_1201], including recruitment banner ads that will be 
used on social networking applications (e.g., Scruff, Grindr).
We will also recruit men from clinical registries of HIV-negative MSM that 
are maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_20196]. Safren at the University of Miami as well 
as [CONTACT_341771] at the City University of [LOCATION_001]. We will submit 
modifications to these protocols prior to contact[CONTACT_341753]. 
16) Local Number of Subjects
Across both phases of this project, we estimate that 20 PrEP healthcare team 
members and 100 stimulant-using MSM will participate.
17) Confidentiality
Consent forms and contact [CONTACT_341754] (a 
HIPAA compliant document management system administered by [CONTACT_341755]). Paper forms will be stored in a locked file cabinet. All data will be 
stored in a password protected file and password protected server. Confidentiality 
of information regarding participants will be maintained. Although not specifically 
mentioned in [ADDRESS_422878]. Carrico’s team takes extensive 
precautions to safeguard confidentiality of this information (e.g., certificate of 
confidentiality, electronic data collection on a firewall protected server). 
18) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects
Study visits will be conducted online from the University of Miami Miller School 
of Medicine or from the homes of our study team members during COVID-19. We 
will secure a private office to facilitate privacy and comfort during study 
assessments and intervention visits.  Only the study team will have access to

19) Consent Process
All potential participants will be told that their participation is voluntary. Their 
refusal to participate or withdraw from the study will not have any effect, including 
-       Study #: 20180823        Effective Date: 5/22/2023
IRB Study Number: 20180823
Version #10.1; April 2023
Page 14 of 15 Revised: April 2023on the clinical services they receive at the University of Miami. All participants will 
be told the objectives of the study.  
We are requesting prior approval to consent in order to conduct the study 
procedures via Zoom. Participants will be provided with a consent form to read and 
sign on their computers (where possible). If participants do not have device that 
allows them to sign electronically, they will indicate consent verbally. Where 
participants have any further questions or concerns regarding consent, these will be 
addressed in a private office or home of our study team members.
When questions arise or participants do not appear to understand the nature of the 
study, staff are trained to review the consent verbally and encourage participants to 
ask any questions as well as take time to consult friends or family before deciding 
to participate in the study. Staff are also trained to ask a series of open-ended and 
closed ended questions to confirm that participants comprehend the inherent risks 
and benefits of this project.  
20) Process to Document Consent in Writing
Potential participants will be scheduled for a baseline Zoom meeting during which 
they will be informed that their participation is voluntary in the study. If the 
participant is willing, he will be provided with a brief overview of the study. 
Participants will be asked to click a button confirming that they consent to 
participate and enter their name [CONTACT_341767]. 
Following the baseline assessment, those who are eligible will be asked to provide 
contact [CONTACT_3031]. Participants will be notified that they can decline to 
participate in the study at any time and contact [CONTACT_341756]. 
Participants will complete a second informed consent for Stage [ADDRESS_422879] any 
further questions or concerns regarding consent, these will be addressed with the 
designated study staff member prior to collecting self-report data or biospecimens.
Because PrEP healthcare team members are being interviewed only once and 
regarding their professional role, we are requesting a waiver of signed consent for 
key informant interviews or focus groups with these providers.

HIV testing: 
You will be asked to use the package sent from our team to mail in your saliva sample to be tested for 
HIV. We should be able to provide your results within a week after we receive your saliva sample. If 
you test positive for HIV, we may provide your preliminary HIV-positive results and your name [CONTACT_1639] a 
linkage coordinator in your area to help you get confirmatory HIV testing and treatment. The research 
will not be doing this, but we can help coordinate and call medical centers and/or physicians to help 
get you an immediate appointment for confirmatory testing in your area.
Testing for HIV is available at other locations near you. Our team will provide referrals for HIV testing 
in your area if that is helpful.  
Non-reactive (HIV-) test results will be shared with you during your randomization visit. If you do not 
complete your randomization visit or do not respond to the attempts to schedule this visit after 2 months,

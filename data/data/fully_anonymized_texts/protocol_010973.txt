1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
1.1 Glioblastoma Multiforme  
 
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, World Health Organization/WHO grade IV) is the most 
common malignant primary brain tumor and one of the most devastating cancers [ 1]. 
Between 2004 and 2007, there were 37,690 patients newly diagnosed with GBM, with an estimated incidence rate of 3 cases per 100, 000 people in the [LOCATION_002] [2]. The current 
standard of care for GBM includes maximal safe resection followed by [CONTACT_114658]  (RT)  
and temozolomide  (TMZ) . The incorporation of TMZ  in the treatment of these patients 
represent ed the first breakthrough against this fatal cancer in decades and was shown to 
significantly improve outcome in a randomized study. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_288853] -
modality therapy, the median survival is approximately 14 months, with a five -year 
survival of less than 10%  [3]. The combined RT and TMZ regimen was associated with 
relatively low rates of grade 3 -4 toxicities: 4% neutropenia, 3% thrombocytopenia, 3% 
infection, 7% fatigue, 1% rash, <1% nausea/vomiting. Completion of therapy was also very high: 5%  were  unable to complete 90% of RT (4% due to disease progression, 1% due to 
incompliance), 13% did not complete concurrent TMZ (5% due to toxicity, 4% due to disease progression, and 4% due to other causes) [ 4]. 
 Many institutions have attempted to increase the dose of  RT to improve tumor control using 
various methods , including radiosurgery and brachytherapy, but each method has failed to 
improve outcome  [5-7]. A recent retrospective study from our research group at 
Washington University showed that moderate RT dose -escalation with concurrent TMZ 
did not appear to improve outcome as compared to standard dose RT and TMZ  [8]. Thus, 
novel therapeutic approaches are desperately needed for this devastating disease.  
 
Recent evidence suggest s that a cellular hierarchy exists in GBM [9,10] . A small fraction 
of GBM cells have the ability to regenerate the entire tumor and share many similar characteristics as neural stem cells, such as self -renewal, extensive proliferation, and 
differentiation  [11-14]. Those cells have been referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs) or 
tumor -initiating cells. Experiments have shown that CSCs  are more resistant to  RT and 
chemotherapy than the rest of the tumor cell population [15,16]. Therefore, CSCs  may 
represent an important reason why GBM  may initially respond but invariably recur after 
chemoradiotherapy. Importantly , recent laboratory study has suggested that CSC hierarchy 
may be reversible and that non- CSCs can convert into CSCs  [17], which would imply that 
the optimal therapeutic approach to GBM would be to combine conventional therapy that 
eradicate s non-CSCs with CSC- directed therapy. Other preclinical studies have also 
suggested that disulfiram  (DSF) , a FDA -approved, non- cancer therapeutic drug, may target  
the CSC- like subpopulation of GBM. Its mechanism is still unclear but may be due to 
aldehyde dehydrogenase  (ALDH)  inhibition, O6-methylguanine -DNA methyltransferase 
(MGMT ) inhibition, NF-kB inhibition, proteasome inhibition, DNA repair inhibition, or 
increased intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation (Brar, et al. 2004; Klein, 
et al. 1994).   
 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 11 of 72 1.2 Disulfiram  
 
1.2.1 Current Usage of Disulfiram and Proteasome Inhibition  
 
Disulfiram (Antabuse, Teva  Pharmaceuticals, North Wales, PA ) is a n FDA-
approved medication that has been used for treating alcoholism since 1951. It  
inhibits ALDH , which leads to accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood after 
ingestion of alcohol. The resulting acetaldehyde causes unpleasant symptoms such as sweating, flushing, nausea , and vomiting. The association of these aversive 
reactions with drinking thus discourages further consumption of alcohol. More recently, disulfiram (DSF ) has also been used to treat cocaine addiction  [18]. Upon 
absorption, DSF is immediately reduced to its active metabolite, 
diethyldithiocarbamate (D DTC). DD TC is a potent copper  (Cu) chelator and can 
readily penetrate the blood brain barrier  [19]. Increasing data has emerged that the 
Cu-DDTC complex appears to be a proteasome inhibitor  [20,21].    
 A proteasome is a large multi -subunit complex in eukaryotes which  controls the 
degradation of intracellular proteins  [22]. As an important regulator of many 
cellular processes such as cell -cycle and apoptosis, proteasomes have emerged as a 
promising target for anticancer therapy  [23]. Proteasomes  contain at least three 
known catalytic activities: chymotrysin -like, trypsin -like, and caspase- like. 
Specifically, the inhibition of the proteasomal chymotrypsin -like activity has been 
shown to be associated with apoptosis of tumor cells  [24,25]. One of the first 
proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib (Velcade, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA), is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Bortezomib  
has also shown significant cytotoxic effect on GBM cells in vitro  [26] but has 
limited penetration across the blood brain barrier  [27,28] . It has been shown to be 
ineffective for recurrent GBM  [29]. Although the  results of th e phase II study of 
bortezomib combined with vorinostat are  disappointing, disease response  may be 
complicated by [CONTACT_151213]’s  poor intracranial penetration and its  focus on heavily 
pretreated tumors.  
     
1.2.[ADDRESS_352220] their normal tissue 
counterpart  [20,30,31] . Recently, a few studies have also demonstrated promising 
activity against GBM models. Hothi et al . have performed a high- throughput 
screening study of 2000 compounds and identified DSF as a potent inhibitor of 
patient -derived GBM stem cells (GSCs), with its greatest effect at a concentration 
above 0.[ADDRESS_352221] GSCs as compared to normal neural stem cells (IC
50 of 31 nM versus 283 nM, respectively). The study further identified that 
the effect is dependent on a complex formation with C u and its inhibition of 
chymotrypsin- like proteasomal activity  [32].  
 
Version 01/24/[ADDRESS_352222] GBM 
cell lines and provided evidence that DSF  preferentially targets the GSC 
subpopulation. They observed that the IC 50 ranged from 119.7 to 464.9 nM for 
different GBM cell lines. Furthermore, after only 3 hour exposure to 0.5 µM of 
DSF with 1 µM of Cu , the neurosphere -forming ability of different GBM cell lines 
was completely abolished, which is a key characteristic of the GBM stem -like cells . 
They also showed that DSF -Cu complex could induce intracellular reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) to trigger intrinsic apoptosis of GBM cells through activation of JNK and p38 pathways  [33].  
 In a third study, Triscott et al . showed that DSF is active against TMZ -resistant 
GBM cell lines and provided synergistic activity when combined with TMZ. They reported that the IC
[ADDRESS_352223] the G SC-like subpopulations 
and may also increase the efficacy of TMZ [ 34].  
 
1.2.3 In Vivo  Studies  of D SF 
 
Paranjpe et al. showed that DSF  increased sensitivity of GBM cells to TMZ through 
inhibition of O
6-methylguanine -DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and 
demonstrated that DSF  preferentially inhibited tumor MGMT in GBM xenografts 
as compared to MGMT in the liver . MGMT is a DNA repair protein that removes 
the mutagenic O6-akyl groups from guanines, which would negate the effect of 
TMZ on tumor cells. The inhibition of MGMT provided a mechanism explanation for the synergistic effect with TMZ  [35]. Lun et al. have also recently reported that 
a combination of DSF , Cu gluconate, and TMZ could significantly improve 
survival of mice with orthotopic GBM tumors.  They have also shown that DSF 
inhibited the 26S proteasome in a Cu -dependent manner and induced activation of 
both heat shock and unfolded protein responses  [36].  Altogether, the in vivo  studies 
have confirmed the findings of the in vitro  experiments and support clinical trial to 
test the synergistic benefit of  combining DSF and copper with RT and TMZ for 
treating GBM.   DSF has also been tested on breast and prostate cancer xenografts. Chen et al . 
injected 50 mg/kg of DSF  intraperitoneally daily for [ADDRESS_352224] cancer xenografts. They found that DSF  reduced tumor growth by 74% 
as compared to the control group. They also confirmed that the proteasom e 
chymotrypsin- like activity was inhibited by 87% in the tumor tissues treated with 
DSF as compared to the control. Along with the proteasome inhibition, there was 
also increased apoptosis within the tre ated tumor, including increased caspase -3 
activity and cleaved PARP  [20]. When given to mice implanted with prostate 
cancer xenografts, daily treatment of 200 mg/kg/day DSF  in olive oil for three 
weeks also reduced tumor growth by 40% as compared to olive oil alone  [31].  
  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 13 of 72 These preclinical studies further support the promising role of  DSF as a novel 
approach to treat cancer.   
 
1.2.4    Safety and  Toxicology 
 
DSF has been used clinically  for more than 50 years, so its safety profile is well  
known. The current FDA- recommended dose of DSF  is 250- 500 mg daily for 
alcohol abstinence . The primary pharmacological action of DSF is its ir reversible 
inhibition of ALDH , leading to an accumulation of acetaldehyde with ingestion of 
alcohol. The acetaldehyde then produces unpleasant DSF -ethanol reaction, 
characterized by [CONTACT_288881], palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], headache, nausea , and vomiting [18]. In the 
early clinical practice, a much higher dose of 1000- 3000 mg per day was used  [37].  
At high dosages, the DSF -ethanol reaction may be severe and even fatal , but such 
high dosage in the absence of alcohol is well tolerated . In the early 1950s, 4 patients 
(out of an estimated 11,000 patients prescribed high doses of DSF) died of sudden 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_288854] -ethanol reaction [38]. 
At such high dosages, there were also case reports of psychosis in the absence of alcohol ingestion [39,40] . A previous phase I study combining a single dose of oral 
DSF and cisplatin every 3 weeks observed dose -limiting confusion at 3000 mg/m
2 
(approximately 4800 mg) [ 41]. High doses of DSF  may inhibit cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_288855] B -hydroxylase  [42], and people with very low activity of dopamine 
hydroxylase may be prone to transient psychosis with such inhibition [ 43].    
 
Early toxicology studies done in mice, rats, dogs, and rabbits have show n that DSF 
has very low toxicity, with LD 50 between 1.8- 10g/kg when administered orally. At 
those extreme doses, demyelination of brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_288856] [44]. Interestingly, long- term administration of high doses of DSF  
to rats did not induce any laboratory or histological signs of liver damage  [45]. High 
doses of DSF  (up to 6 g daily) are relatively nontoxic in humans. Symptoms of 
overdose include vomiting, headache, apathy, ataxia, motor restlessness, irritability, hallucinations, psychosis, loss of consciousness and convulsions. Death occurs by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_13374], preceded by [CONTACT_288882], and pathological lesions are seen in the liver, spleen, kidney and CNS, with congestion in the adrenal gland and edema in the heart muscle.   
 1.2.5 Pharmacology and  Drug Metabolism  
 After oral ingestion, DSF  is partially reduced to DDTC in the acidic stomach, which 
in turn forms a complex with Cu to form  Cu(DDTC)
2. Both the parent DSF  and 
Cu(DDTC) [ADDRESS_352225]. Generally, more than 
80% of an oral dose is absorbed, and enteric formulation and oil may enhance improved absorption. After absorption, DSF  is again reduced to DDTC and then 
Cu(DDTC)
2. Downstream metabolites also include diethylamine, carbon 
disulphide, diethyldithiomethylcarbamate (Me -DDTC),  and glucuronic acid of 
DDTC. Me -DDTC is biotransformed into active inhibitors of ALDH [19]. 
Experiments with radiolabeled DSF  have shown distribution in the blood, liver, 
Version 01/24/[ADDRESS_352226] importantly , brain  [46].  
 
1.2.[ADDRESS_352227] 50 years. At the dose  of 250- 500 mg per day as  recommended by [CONTACT_1556], DSF is safe and well -tolerated  [18,37] . A few clinical studies have been 
reported in the literature on its use in cancer patients. A phase II study randomized 
[ADDRESS_352228] cancer patients after mastectomy to chemotherapy either 
with DDTC (the main metabolite of DSF ) or placebo. The group that received 
DDTC had significantly better disease -free survival (DFS) and overall survival 
(OS) as compared to the placebo group [47]. A phase I study treated non- metastatic 
recurrent prostate cancer patients with 250 -500 mg of DSF  (9 patients with 250 mg 
and 10 patients with 500 mg). Only [ADDRESS_352229] 6 months 
of DSF, and the biochemical response appeared to be minimal. There were 3 
patients with grade 3 toxicity for each dose level, including double vision, hearing loss, LFT abnormality, diarrhea, constipation, and ataxia. Due to lack of clear signal for treatment re sponse and the toxicities reported, the authors did not recommend 
additional testing of DSF in the recurrent prostate cancer population [ 48]. A recent 
double -blinded, randomized phase II study compared chemotherapy with and 
without DSF  for metastatic non -small cell lung cancer [49]. DSF was given at 40 
mg three times daily (TID ). Patients who received concurrent DSF  had significantly 
better PFS and OS than who received chemotherapy alone (5.9 vs. 4.9 months, and 10.0 vs. 7.1 months, respectively). The authors recommended a larger phase III 
studies to test DSF with chemotherapy for metastatic non -small cell lung cancer.   
 We have recently conducted a phase I  pharmacodynamic study combining 500-
1000 mg of DSF with adjuvant temozolomide for newly diagnosed GBM  patients 
after RT and concurrent TMZ , which has determined 500 mg of DSF  per day as the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in combination with adjuvant  TMZ. Dose -limiting 
toxicity, which was defined as within the first [ADDRESS_352230] month due to possibly DSF -related toxicity. One patient developed grade 3 delirium

extremity weakness and foot drop). Both toxicities resolved after discontinuing DSF. Grade 2 -3 toxicities that were possibly or probably related to DSF are

concentrations  [50,51] . Dose s as low as 100 mg of DSF  could produce detectable 
plasma concentrations of Me- DDTC and complete blockade of ALDH activity in 
erythrocyte s [52]. As seen in Figure 1, three  daily doses of DSF will allow for DSF 
and its metabolites to reach steady state.

Figure 1: Predicted pharmacokinetic profile of DSF and its metabolites (DDTC & Me -DDTC)  
 
 
 
The metabolites of DSF  are mainly excreted via kidneys, feces, and the lungs. Up 
to 20% of an oral dose may not be absorbed and thus excreted in the feces. About 
65% is eliminated through the kidneys, mostly as the glucuronide of DDTC and inorganic sulfates. The metabolite c arbon disulphide is mostly eliminated via the 
lungs  [19].  
 
In the blood, both DSF  and Me -DDTC are mostly bound to albumin, with average 
binding percentages of 96 and 80% over the ranges 200- [ADDRESS_352232] considerabl y 
different plasma concentration of DSF  and its metabolites. Both DSF  and Me -
DDTC are also very lipophilic, with Log P (octanol -water partition coefficient) of 
2.81 and 1.85, respectively [53], which support their ability to cross the BBB . 
However, specific measurement of DSF  and its metabolites in gliomas have not 
been conducted to date.

Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 17 of 72 concentration than low -grade gliomas but lower when compared to brain 
metastases, suggesting break -down of the blood- brain barrier plays an important 
factor in intratumoral drug concentration [ 54]. Previous studies have shown a 
sample size of [ADDRESS_352234] difference in drug concentration 
between dos e levels [ 55]. Given the tumor specimen invariably contain blood, high 
plasma concentration may lead to over -estimation of the tissu e drug concentration 
[56]. Thus, an accurate estimation of intratumoral drug concentration would require 
measurement of concurrent plasma level and would ideally be mea sured when the 
plasma level has peaked.      
 
1.2.9 Co-administration of Copper  (Cu)  
 
Previous in vitro  studies have consistently shown the effect of DSF  is dependent on 
Cu, at a concentration of approximately 1 uM. Based on 130 autopsy cases of non-
poisoned people, the Cu concentration of brain, blood, and stomach were 
approximately 49.0 uM (median) [range: 10.6- 118.3], 13.1 uM [9.0- 20.6], 15.7 uM 
[3.8- 76.7], respectively [57]. Furthermore, cancer cells including gliomas cells 
appear to contain highly elevated levels of Cu  as compared to surrounding normal 
tissues [58-60]. However, typi[INVESTIGATOR_288857] 1 mg of Cu  daily, less 
than the lower limit of 1.5 to 3.0 mg which is estimated as a safe and adequate daily 
dietary intake (ESADDI) of copper [ 61,62]. Therefore, dietary Cu supplementation 
may be required  for DSF to be maximally effective as an antineoplastic drug. The 
upper level of recommended daily elemental Cu  is 8 mg a day (Institute for 
Medicine 2002), administered as Cu  gluconate, a substance generally regarded as 
safe (GRAS) (Code of Federal Regulation 2004). Large amounts of ingested Cu  
could result in hepatic failure and hemolysis similar to that seen with Wilson's disease, the rare genetic syndrome from hyperabsorption of Cu . 
 
Prior reports have shown that [ADDRESS_352235] nor any significant increase of serum 
copper level [ 63,64] . A previous phase I study for patients with advanced liver 
metastasis has shown [ADDRESS_352236], and DSF  was given with the 
evening meals [ 65]. 
 
1.2.10 Potential Risks and Benefits  
 
The safety risks of DSF  are well established based on over 60 years of clinical use  
[18,37,66] . From 1968 to  1991, 154 adverse drug reactions were reported to the 
Danish Committee on Adverse Drug Reactions: hepatic (34%), neurological (21%), cutaneous (15%), psychiatric (4%), and other (26%). However, some patients may have received much higher doses than the cu rrently approved dosage  and may have 
consumed alcohol  while taking DSF. Rate of adverse event is estimated to be one 
per 200- 2000 patients per year  [67]. The more common and mild side  effects 
include: drowsiness, usually of short duration (can be managed by [CONTACT_288883] 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 18 of 72 medication in the evening); headache; nausea and vomiting; metallic or garlic -like 
aftertaste; allergic dermatitis; impotence; DSF -ethanol reaction after ingestion of 
alcohol (flushing, headache, nausea, sweating, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, tachycardia, 
hypotension, and rarely cardiovascular collapse). These symptoms are generally transient and typi[INVESTIGATOR_288858]. DSF -ethanol reaction can be 
avoided by [CONTACT_288884], and case reports of fatal DSF -ethanol 
reaction in the past occurred with much higher doses of DSF. Other rare but more 
severe toxicities include: hepatotoxicity or hepatitis, typi[INVESTIGATOR_288859] (should be followed with liver function tests); peripheral neuropathy ; optic neuritis; extrapyramidal symptoms; psychosis. Patients with 
hepatic dysfunction, active pregnancy, and idiopathic seizure disorder should not be given DSF .  
 
As discussed in S ection 1.2.6, our previous phase [ADDRESS_352237] his/her subsequent treatment.  As for 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_288860], DSF  appears to have preferential inhibition 
of tumor MGMT  versus liver MGMT in vitro, and our previous phase I study 
demonstrated safety when combining it with TMZ. Since DSF  may be 
radiosensit izing due to its possible effect on DNA repair  based on in vitro  studies , 
its tolerability with RT  is currently unknown. To monitor for severe toxicity, 
patients will be follo wed frequently  during RT  with weekly clinical ev aluation and 
CBC. Liver function test will be checked before starting DSF, and every month  
while taking DSF .

Version 01/24/[ADDRESS_352239] 
the potential  of DSF to improve clinical outcome of GBM patients.  Since Cu has been 
shown in the preclinical studies to be crucial for the activity of DSF, pati ents will also take 
Cu TID with meals to maximize the biological activity  of DSF . Therefore, the purpose of 
this study is to identify the optimal dose of DSF  to combine with RT and TMZ .   
 
The proposed study will be a single arm , phase I/II  study of  DSF/Cu in combination with 
adjuvant standard RT and TMZ for patients with newly diagnosed GBM. There will be an 
optional phase 0 pharmac okinetic  study where patients will take 3 days  of DSF/Cu prior to 
their surgery  to allow for collection of blood and tumor samples  during surgery for analysis 
of drug uptake.  
 As for the rationale for the proposed expansion cohort, this is based on the promising finding of the dose -escalation phase of the study . After enrollment of the 18 patients for 
the dose -escalation phase, 8  patients were treated with DSF of 250 mg/day (dose level 2) 
and 10 patients with 375 mg/day (dose level 3). Three dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were 
observed: 1 with 250 mg/day (grade 2 urinary incontinence and ataxia), and 2 with 375 mg/day (both grade  3 elevated liver enzymes). The TITE -CRM model est imated the DLT 
probability of DSF to be 10% (95% CI: 3- 29%) at 250 mg/day, and 21% (95% CI: 7 -42%) 
at 375 mg/day. Thus, we have declared that the MTD of DSF in combination with RT/TMZ/Cu for GBM is 375 mg/day, and the recommended phase II dose is 250 mg/da y. 
Furthermore, tumor mutations were evaluated with next -generation sequencing for all 
patients to explore possible biomarkers for response. Notably, GBM patients with IDH (n 
= 6), BRAF (n = 2), and NF1  (n = 1) mutations exhibited much better PFS and OS than 
those without these mutations  (n = 9) : 1-year PFS of 100% vs 22%, respectively, p = 0.001; 
1-year OS of 100% vs 42%, re spectively, p = 0.006. Given that the historical PFS and OS 
of newly diagnosed GBM patients treated with RT and TMZ is approximat ely 27% and 
60% at one year [ 4], respectively, the preliminary data of this molecular subset of GBM 
are thought -provoking and raise the possibility that these mutations make GBM tumors 
more sensitive to DSF/Cu in combination with chemoradiotherapy. Interestingly, all three mutations , which affect approximately 15- 20% of GBM tumors,  make tumor cells more 
dependent on glutamat e for cellular metabolism [ 68-70]. As DSF metabolite can affect 
glutamate uptake, this may be the biological mechanism for the improved outcomes for GBM with these mutations. Thus, we have proposed to add an expansion cohort to this phase I/II study to treat additional GBM patients with IDH, BRAF, or NF1  mutations to 
increase the statistical power of our preliminary finding . 
    
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 21 of 72 2.0 OBJECTIVES  AND ENDPOINTS  
 
Objectives  Endpoints  
Primary  
Dose -escalation Phase:  To determine the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 
disulfiram (DSF) when administered with 
concurrent radiation therapy (RT) and 
temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with newly 
diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM). 
 
Dose -expansion Phase:  To evaluate the OS 
of the molecularly -defined cohort of newly 
diagnosed GBM with IDH, BRAF, or NF1 
mutations when treated with the combination of DSF/Cu plus concurrent RT and TMZ. Dose -escalation Phase:  The maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) of DSF with concurrent RT+TMZ 
will be defined as the dose associated with a 20% probability of dose -
limiting toxicity (DLT). 
Toxicity will be coded using CTCAE version 4.0, 
and DLT will be defined as toxicity that occurs 
within [ADDRESS_352240] day of RT and is 
possibly, probably or definitely related to DSF/Cu (or 12 weeks from the completion of RT if there is a delay/interruption of RT).  
 
Dose -expansion Phase:  For the expansion cohort 
of GBM with IDH, BRAF, and NF1 mutations, 
the overall survival (OS) of this molecularly -
defined cohort will be measured from the first 
day of RT.  
Secondary  
1. To describe the toxicities of DSF when 
given concurrently with RT and TMZ.  
2. To evaluate the PFS of the molecularly-defined cohort of newly diagnosed GBM with IDH, BRAF, or 
NF1 mutations 
when treated with the combination of 
DSF/Cu plus concurrent RT and TMZ  
3. To determine the active DSF metabolite 
concentration in plasma and tumor 
tissues.  1. The adverse events will be graded by [CONTACT_128669] 4.0.  
2. Progression- free survival (PFS) will be 
determined from the first day of RT to the 
time of tumor progression or death, whichever 
occurs first. Tumor progression will be 
determined using the RANO criteria.  
3. Intratumor and plasma concentration of DSF metabolite (ditiocarb -copper complex) will be 
determined using mass spectrometer method.   
Tertiary/Exploratory  
1. To estimate rate of pseudo -progression 
after chemoradiotherapy  
2. To explore the pharmacodynamics effect of DFS on glutamate metabolism in plasma and tumor tissues  1. Pseudo -progression is defined as a transient 
increase of tumor after chemoradiotherapy that subsequently stabilizes without a change of therapy  
2. Pharmacodynamics studies on glutamate metabolism will include measurement of glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, glucose, and lactate levels in blood and tumor tissues 
using mass spectrometry method.

5.5 Laboratory Studies and Tissue Collection  during Chemoradiotherapy  
 
Routine laboratory studies (CBC, BMP, and LFTs) will be obtained before the start of 
chemoradiotherapy and weekly (for CBC) and monthly (for BMP and LFTs) during 
chemoradiotherapy or more frequently as clinically indicated . If , during 
chemoradiotherapy treatment, the patient develops disease progression and undergoes 
surgical resection of the glioblastoma, a portion of the tissue removed during surgery and along with blood will be archived for future research purposes  (please refer to Section 9.0) . 
 
5.6 Adjuvant  Temozolomide  and Disulfiram  Treatment  
 Approximately 4- 6 weeks after completion of RT with concurrent TMZ, adjuvant  TMZ 
may be administered for 6 cycles. Dosage of each cycle is 150 -200 mg/m
[ADDRESS_352254].  Tumor -treating fields or Optune device 
(Novocure) as per routine clinical care during adjuvant TMZ is permitted at the discretion 
of the treating physician.  
 
During adjuvant TMZ, the patient should be assessed every 2 months as per routine clinical 
care; however, more frequent visits may be performed as per the treating physician. During 
adjuvant  DSF with concurrent TMZ , if a patient develops disease progression and 
undergoes surgic al resection of the GBM , a portion of the tissue removed during surgery 
and along with blood will be archived for future research purposes (please refer to Section 9.0). 
 
5.7 Optional Preoperative Disulfiram before Salvage Surgery  
After completion of adjuvant DSF , patient s should be followed every 2 -3 months as per 
routine clinical care. If a patient develops recurrent tumor during follow -up and plans to 
undergo another resection, he/she may opt for an optional preoperative DSF study prior to salvage surgery. Patients who would like to participate in this optional portion of the study 
will be treated with a 5- day ( +/- 2 days) lead -in with oral DSF and Cu. DSF should be taken 
as 250 mg per day approximately 1 hour after dinner  in the evening, and Cu should be 
taken as 2mg TID with each meals. Patient should not  take DSF or Cu on the day of the 
surgery and should complete the drug diary (Appendix E) . 
Version 01/24/[ADDRESS_352255] patient wi ll be treated at D ose Level 2 with  250 mg of DSF  daily , and doses for 
subsequent patients will be provided at the time of registration based on the toxicity experience of the previous patients on study using the TITE -CRM  method, as detailed  in 
Section  13.3 .  
 
Dose Escalation Schedule  
Dose Level  Dose of Disulfiram  
Level 1  125 mg PO daily  
Level 2  250 mg PO daily  
Level 3  375 mg PO  daily  
Level 4  500 mg PO daily  
 
For patients enrolling in the expansion cohort, the dose of DSF during RT will be  250 
mg/day.  
 
5.9 Definition of MTD, DLT, Dose Escalation Criteria, and Toxicity, Response, and DLT Evaluations  
 
5.9.1 Definition of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) 
 The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DSF  is define d as the dose level at which 
20% of the  cohort experience DLT within 18 weeks from start of RT  (or 12 weeks 
from the end of RT if there is a delay in RT).  MTD is assessed from the first dose of DSF in combination with TMZ and RT; patients will not be assessed for DLT during the pre -surgery period when they are receiving the lead- in doses of DSF. 
 
5.9.2 Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) 
 A DLT is defined as a clinically significant adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications/ TMZ/adjuvant DSF  which occurs within  [ADDRESS_352256] dose of DSF  with RT +TMZ (corresponding to approximately 6 
weeks during RT and 12 weeks after RT) and meets any of the following criteria (all toxicity will be graded using CTCAE version 4.0):  
 
• Any delay in RT treatment > 14 days that is possibly, probably, or definitely 
related to DSF  will be considered a DLT.  
• Any adverse event that requires dose reduction or discontinuation of DSF during RT that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to DSF will be considered a DLT.  
• Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 29 of 72 Note: These dose limiting hematological toxicities are most likely due to TMZ 
and may be attributed to TMZ. However, as a conservative assessment of the 
ability to combine DSF  with RT and TMZ, these toxicities will be counted as a 
DLT as they would prompt discontinuation of TMZ.  
• Serum creatinine > 2.[ADDRESS_352257]  
• Total bilirubin > 2.[ADDRESS_352258]; AST or ALT > 3.[ADDRESS_352259]  
• Other grade 3 or grade 4 non- hematologic toxicity that is possibly, probably, or 
definitely related  to DSF , with the following specific exceptions:  
• Grade 3 fatigue  
• Grade 3 arthralgias/myalgias

• Diarrhea that can be adequately managed with outpatient medication such as loper amide and does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_288861] -sensitive intracranial 
structures (example: dura). The oncologists participating in this study are experienced clinicians accustomed to evaluation of brain tumor patients with headaches. Each patient with a headache is approached individually with a systematic assessment as to the etiology of the pain. Appropriate tests may include 
vital signs , CT or MRI scans,  or other investigations. If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_288862], the headache is due to DSF, then the toxicity will be graded as 
above, and if ≥ grade 3, it will be defined as a DLT.  Seizures are also a common complication associated with brain tumors. As noted in the preceding paragraph each patient will be approached individually and 
assessment for the cause of the seizure will be performed. If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_288863], the seizure is due to DSF , then the toxicity will be graded, and 
if ≥ 3, it will be defined as a DLT.  
 
5.9.[ADDRESS_352260] to receive the combination of DSF with RT+TMZ to be evaluable for DLT. Of note, DLT evaluation starts when patient starts DSF with 
RT and does not apply during the preoperative DSF administration. Patients who 
do not have at l east one dose of DSF with RT +TMZ  will not be evaluable for DLT 
and will be replaced.  
 
  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 30 of 72 5.10 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
The following medications and procedures are prohibited during the study:  
• Any antineoplastic therapy other than RT , temozolomide,  and DSF, except for the 
tumor -treating fields or Optune device when used in conjunction with adjuvant 
temozolomide and DSF  
• Any investigational therapy other than DSF   
 
All other medical conditions  or manifestations of the patient’s malignancy  should be 
treated at the discretion of the investigator in accordance with local community standards 
of medical care.  
 
Patients should not drive, operate dangerous tools or machinery, or engage in any other potentially hazardous activity that requires full alertness and coordination if they 
experience sedation while enrolled in this study.  
 Patients are to be instructed to abstain from alcohol while enrolled in this study.   
 
5.10.[ADDRESS_352261] with DSF  
through the cytochrome  P450 system , the use of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_288864].   
 
5.10.2 Diarrhea  
 
Antidiarrheal medications will not be used prophylactically; however, patients will be instructed to take loperamide, [ADDRESS_352262] 12 hours.  
During the night, patients may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours.  Fluid intake should be maintained to avoid dehydration.  
 
5.10.3 Central Nervous System Effects  
 
In our previous experience with 500- 1000 mg of DSF per day with adjuvant  TMZ, 
significant neurological toxicities, including delirium/psychosis, ataxia, visual changes, peripheral neuropathy, were observed, especially at the  1000 mg dose. 
Early signs of those symptoms should be carefully monitored. Once other causes such as tumor progression are ruled out, dose reduction of DSF during adjuvant 
TMZ should be considered if the toxicity is grade 2 or greater . If symptoms are not 
improving with dose reduction, DSF should be discontinued. Patients whose 
symptoms  are not considered immediately life -threatening should be carefully 
monitored . Each patient may be approached individually with a systematic 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 31 of 72 assessment to rule out other causes. Appropriate tests may include vital signs; CT 
or MRI scans or other investigations.  
 If the patient’s level of consciousness is considered to be life -threatening, the 
patient should be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_288865], ventilation, and intravenous access.  
 
5.10.4 Management of D isulfiram -Alcohol Reaction  
 Severe DSF reactions caused by [CONTACT_102]'s ingestion of alcohol  should lead to 
emergency evaluation and supportive measures to restore blood pressure. Other 
recommendations include: oxygen, carbogen (95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide), vitamin C intravenously in massive doses (1 g) , and ephedrine sulfate. 
Antihistamines have also been used intravenously. Potassium levels should be monitored, particularly in patients on digitalis, since hypokalemia has been reported.  
 
5.11 Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
Women of childbearing potential ( defined as women with regular menses, women with 
amenorrhea, women with irregular cycles, women using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, or  women who have had a tubal ligation) are required to 
have a negative serum pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_352263]  dose of the study 
treatment.   
 
Female and male patients (along with their female partners) are required to use a method 
of acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, during participation in the study and for [ADDRESS_352264] be notified in order to facilitate outcome follow -up. 
 
5.12 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, the protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation doc umented 
in the case report forms.  
 
  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 32 of 72 In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, DSF  treatment may continue until 
completion of 6 cycles of adjuvant  TMZ  or in the event of following:  
 
• Documented and confirmed disease progression  
• Death  
• Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug  
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
• Suspected pregnancy  
• Serious noncompliance with the study protocol  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Patient withdraws consent  
• Investigator removes the patient from study  
• The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study  
 
5.[ADDRESS_352265] . Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events 
will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  Follow -up after the 
conclusion of adjuvant  TMZ + DSF will be per routine clinical care.   Two years after the 
patient comes off study, the chart will be reviewed to collect data on progression and survival.  
 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
6.1 Temozolomide  Dose Modifications  during R adiation Therapy   
 
No dose reduction will be made, but delay or discontinuation of TMZ administration will 
be decided weekly according to hematologic and non- hematologic adverse events, as 
specified below .  Additionally, TMZ can be held at the discretion of the treating physician.  
If the administration of TMZ has to be interrupted, RT  will proceed normally. Missed doses 
of TMZ will not be made up at the end of RT . The total number of days and total dose of 
temozolomide will be recorded on the patient’s medication diary (Appendix C) . 
 If one or more of the following are observed:  
• ANC < 1. 5 x 10
9/ L (Grade 2)  
• Platelet count < 75 x 109/L (Grade 2 ) 
• Grade 3 non- hematologic AE (except alopecia, nausea and vomiting while on 
maximal antiemetic therapy, and fatigue)  
 
  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 33 of 72 Then treatment with concurrent  TMZ  will be withheld until all of the following conditions 
are met:  
• ANC ≥ 1. 5 x 109/L 
• Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L 
• Grade ≤ 1 non -hematologic AE (except alopecia, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue)  
In case of hematologic AE as defined above, a complete blood count (CBC) should be 
performed at least weekly. In case of non- hematologic AE, the patient should be assessed 
at least weekly with relevant laboratory test(s). As soon as all of the above conditions are 
met, the administration of temozolomide will resume at the same dose as used initially.  
 
If one or more of the following are observed:  
• ANC < 0.5 x 109/L (Grade 4)  
• Platelet count < 25 x 109/L (Grade 4) 
• Grade 4 non- hematologic AE (except alopecia, nausea and vomiting unless the 
patient has failed maximal antiemetic therapy, and fatigue)  
Then treatment with concurrent temozolomide should be discontinued.  
 
AE Value  Action  
Grade 3 neutropenia  ≥ 0.5 and < 1.0 x 109/L Hold TMZ until  
--ANC ≥  1.5 x 109/L 
--Platelet ≥ 75 x 109/L 
--Grade ≤ 1 non-hematologic AE  Grade 2 -3 thrombocytopenia  ≥ 25 and < 75 x 109/L 
Grade 3 non -hematologic 
(except alopecia, nausea/vomiting unless on 
maximal antiemetic therapy)  NA 
Grade 4 neutropenia  < 0.5 x 109/L Stop TMZ  
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  < 25 x 109/L 
Grade 4 non -hematologica 
(except alopecia, 
nausea/vomiting)  NA 
 
If RT has to be temporarily interrupted for technical or medical reasons unrelated to TMZ, 
then treatment with daily TMZ should continue. If RT  has to be permanently discontinued 
then TMZ should stop until it is re -initiated at the adjuvant  phase of treatment.  
 
6.2 DSF  Dose Modification s 
 During radiotherapy, i f a patient experiences any adverse event that requires dose reduction 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_288866], 
probably, or definitely related to DSF , DSF/Cu should be discontinued  and the event will 
be considered a DLT . If RT has to be temporarily interrupted for technical or medical 
reasons unrelated to TMZ or DSF/Cu, then treatment with daily TMZ and DSF/Cu should continue.  If RT has to be permanently discontinued then TMZ and DSF/Cu should stop until re -initiated at the adjuvant phase of treatment.  If TMZ is h eld due to toxicity  unrelated 
to DSF/Cu , DSF /Cu should continue as tolerated.  
 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 34 of 72 During adjuvant TMZ, the dose of DSF may be reduced from 500 mg per day to 250 mg per 
day due to toxicity or intolerance at the discretion of the treating physician. Expansion patients who discontinue d DSF during RT and concurrent TMZ  due to toxicity  may be 
considered to resume  DSF with adjuvant TMZ but at 250 mg/day as long as the toxicity has 
resolved prior to the start of cycle 1 of adjuvant TMZ and after discussion between the treating physician and the PI.  Special attention should be paid to neurologi cal symptoms 
such as delirium/psychosis, gait disturbance/ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. A grade 2 toxicity of the above neurological symptoms should prompt a consideration for further work-up and consideration of dose reduction if thought to be related to DSF . No second dose 
reduction  (below 250 mg/day)  is allowed —if a second dose reduction is required, DSF and 
Cu will be permanently discontinued. Of note, hematologic toxicity is uncommon for DSF and is likely related to TMZ.  
 
6.2.1 Administration of DSF  to Patients with Abnormal Hepatic Function  
 
DSF/Cu should only be administered if hepatic function is within the parameters 
established in the eligibility criteria. Hepatic toxicity from DSF/Cu is uncommon 
but may occur. Therefore, hepatic dysfunction that occurs while the patient is on 
study should prompt an evaluation to determine the cause, including the possibility of hepatotoxicity from concurrent medications  including TMZ .  
 
6.2.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions  
 Hypersensi tivity reactions rarely occur. If they do occur, minor symptoms such as 
flushing, skin reactions, dyspnea, lower back pain, hypotension, or tachycardia  may 
require no intervention;  however, severe reactions, such as hypotension requiring 
treatment, dyspnea requiring bronchodilators, angioedema, or generalized urticaria require immediate discontinuation of study drug administration and a ggressive 
symptomatic therapy. Patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction to DSF should discontinue DSF immediate ly and should not be re -challenged.    
  
7.0 REGULATORY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 The entities providing oversight of safety and compliance with the protocol require reporting as outline below.  
 The Washington University Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) requires that all events meeting the definition of unanticipated problem or serious noncompliance be reported as outlined in Section 7.2.

specifically the chymotrypsin -like activity. GBM cells and its stem -like 
subpopulation (also referred to as CSC) may be more susceptible to the effect of 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 38 of 72 proteasomal inhibition than normal brain cells.  DSF is very lipophilic and readily 
crosses the blood -brain barrier.  
 
  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 39 of 72 8.1.3 Supplier  
 
DSF (trade name [CONTACT_288902]) is commercially available and will be provided to 
participants by [CONTACT_1758] .   
 
8.1.4 Dosage Form  
 
DSF is supplied as white, round tablets of 250 mg. Each tablet also contains 
colloidal silicon dioxide, anhydrous lactose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline 
cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, and stearic acid.  The tablet may be cut in half to 
obtain 125 mg dose.  
 
8.1.5 Storage and Stability  
 
DSF is dispensed in a tight, light -resistant container. It should be stored at 
controlled room temperature (20° to 25°C or 68° to 77°F) in its original container to protect from bright light.  
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_352270] dose. In the rare event of a severe hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue DSF  immediately.  
 
8.2 Temozolomide (Temodar)  
 8.2.1 Temozolomide Description  
 Chemical name: 3,4- dihydro- 3-methyl- 4-oxoimidazo[5,1- d]-as-tetrazine -8-
carboxamide. Structural formula:  
 
 8.2.2 Clinical Pharmacology  
 Temozolomide is not directly active but undergoes rapid nonenzymatic conversion at physiologic pH to the reactive compound 5- (3-methyltraizen -1-yl)-imaidazole-
4-carboxamide (MTIC).  The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to be primarily due 
to alkylation of D NA.  Alkylation (methylation) occurs mainly at the O
6 and N7 
positions of guanine.  
 

Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 40 of 72 8.2.3 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
 
Temozolomide is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_288867] a peak plasma concentration (C
max) achieved in a median T max of 1 hour.  Food 
reduces the rate and extent of temozolomide absorption.  
 
Temozolomide is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH to the active species, 
MTIC and to temozolomide acid metabolite.  MTIC is further hydrolyzed to 5 -
amino -imidazole -4-carboxamide (AIC), which is known to be an intermediate in 
purine and nucleic aci d biosynthesis, and to methylhydrazine, which is believed to 
be the active alkylating species.  Cytochrome P540 enzymes play only a minor role 
in the metabolism of temozolomide and MTIC.  
 
About 38% of the administered temozolomide total radioactive dose is recover ed 
over 7 days : 37.7% in urine and 0.8% in feces.  Temozolomide is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_288868], with a mean elimination half- life of 1.8 hours.  
 
8.2.4 Supplier  
 
Temozolomide is commercially available.  
 
8.2.5 Dosage Form and Preparation  
 
Temozolomide capsules are supplied in child -resistant sachets containing the 
following capsule strengths: 5 mg, 20 mg, 100 mg, 140 mg, 180 mg, and 250 mg. 
 
8.2.6 Storage and Stability  
 
Store temozolomide capsules at 35°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15- 30°C (59-
86°F). 
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_352271] agreed to take part in collection of blood and tumor  samples. Drug concentration of DSF 
metabolites ( such as ditiocarb -copper complex)  from the serum and tumor samples will be 
measured by [CONTACT_288886]. Mart in Mistrik at Palacky University 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 41 of 72 Olomouc in Czech Republic  as previously described [ 71]. Of note, the tumor, plasma , cell pell et 
or lysate may be stored at - [ADDRESS_352272] 0.2 cubic cm or approximately  200 mg will be collected . At the time 
of salvage surgery, approximately 2 0 mL of periphe ral blood (10 mL into each of 2 green 
top tube containing sodium heparin) will also be collected. Tumor and blood samples will be submitted  at ambient temperature to Tissue Procurement Core (TPC)  for processing and 
storage .

time of recurrence, they may opt to take 5 days  (+/- 2 days)  of preoperative DSF  (250 mg per day in the evening) and Cu (2mg PO 
TID with meals) until the day before the planned surgery. Patient should not take DSF/Cu on the day of surgery.  
17. A portion of resected tumor tissue and blood will be collected for future correlative studies.  
 
 11.[ADDRESS_352281] – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 9 +/ - 1 
weeks.  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 9 weeks 
(not less than 4) weeks following initial documentation of objective response.  Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the updated response assessment criteria for high -grade gliomas: Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology 
(RANO) working group guideline [ 78]. 
   
Version 01/24/[ADDRESS_352282] Progression  Definition  
Progressive disease < 12 
weeks after completion of 
chemoradiotherapy  Progression can only be defined using diagnostic imaging if there is new 
enhancement outside of the radiation field (beyond the high- dose region or 
80% isodose line) or if there is unequivocal evidence of viable tumor on 
histopathologic sampling (eg, solid tumor areas [ie, > 70% tumor cell nuclei 
in areas], high or progressive increase in MIB -1 proliferation index 
compared with prior biopsy, or evidence for histologic progression or 
increased anaplasia in tumor). Note: Given the difficulty of differentiatin g 
true progression from pseudoprogression, clinical decline alone, in the 
absence of radiographic or histologic confirmation of progression, will not 
be sufficient for definition of progressive disease in the first 12 weeks after 
completion of concurrent c hemoradiotherapy.  
Progressive disease ≥ [ADDRESS_352283] -enhancing lesion outside of radiation field on 
decreasing, stable, or increasing doses of corticosteroids.  
2. Increase by ≥ 25% in the sum of the products of perpendicular 
diameters between the first postradiotherapy scan, or a subsequent 
scan with smaller tumor size, and the scan at 12 weeks or later on 
stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids.  
3. Clinical deterioration not attributable to concurrent medication or 
comorbid conditions is sufficient to declare progression on current 
treatment but not for entry onto a clinical trial for recurrence.  
4. For patients receiving antiangiogenic therapy, significant increase in 
T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesion may also be considered progressive 
disease. The increased T2/FLAIR must have occurred with the 
patient on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids comp ared 
with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy and not be a result of comorbid events (eg, effects of radiation therapy, 
demyelination, ischemic injury, infection, seizures, postoperative changes, or other treatment effects). 
 
 
Criteria for Response Assessment Incorporating MRI and Clinical Factors (Adapted from JCO 2010)  
Response  Criteria  
Complete response  • Requires all of the following: complete disappearance of all enhancing 
measurable and nonmeasurable disease sustained for at least 4 weeks.  
• No new lesions; stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions.  
• Patients must be off corticosteroids (or on physiologic replacement doses only) 
and stable or improved clinically. Note: Patients with nonmeasurable disease 
only cannot have a complete response; the best response possible is stable 
disease.  
Partial response  Requires all of the following:  
• ≥ 50% decrease compared with baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at 
least 4 weeks.  
• No progression of nonmeasurable disease.  
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 46 of 72 Response  Criteria  
• Stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose 
of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan; the corticosteroid dose at the 
time of the scan evaluation should be no greater than the dose at time of 
baseline scan.  
• Stable or improved clinically. Note: Patients with nonmeasurable disease only 
cannot have a partial response; the best response possible is stable disease.  
Stable disease Requires all of the following:  
• Does not qualify for complete response, partial response, or progression.  
• Stable nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of 
corticosteroids compared with baseline scan. In the event that the corticosteroid 
dose was increased for new symptoms and signs without confirmation of 
disease progression on neuroimaging, and subsequent follow -up imaging 
shows that this increase in corticosteroids was required because of disease progression, the last scan considered to show stable disease will be the scan 
obtained when the corticosteroid dose was equivalent to the baseline dos e.  
Progression  Defined by [CONTACT_39132]:  
• ≥ 25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing 
lesions compared with the smallest tumor measurement obtained either at baseline (if no decrease) or best response, on stable or increasing doses of 
corticosteroids
*. The absolute increase in any dimension must be at least 5mm 
when calculating the products.  
• Significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesion on stable or increasing 
doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after 
initiation of therapy* not caused by [CONTACT_186754] (e.g. radiation therapy, 
demyelination, ischemic injury, infection, seizures, postoperative changes, or 
other treatment effects).  
• Any new measureable lesion.  
• Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor 
(e.g. seizures, medication adverse effects, complications of therapy, 
cerebrovascular events, infection, and so on) or changes in corticosteroid dose.  
• Failure to return for evaluation as a result of death or deteriorating condition; or 
clear progression of nonmeasurable disease.  
• NOTE. All measurable and nonmeasurable lesions must be assessed using the same techniques as at 
baseline.  
• Abbreviations: MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; FLAIR, fluid -attenuated inversion recovery.  
• Stable doses of corticosteroids include patients not on corticosteroids.  
 
12.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease:  Bi -dimensionally measurable lesions with clearly defined margins 
by [CONTACT_212690] .  All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal 
fractions of centimeters).    
 
Non-measurable or evaluable  disease:   Uni -dimensionally measurable lesions or lesions 
with margins not clearly defined such as  areas of T2/FLAIR signal abnormality or poorly 
defined enhancing abnormality.  
 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 47 of 72 Note: For cystic lesions, the only measurable part is any enhancement area around the cyst 
that is  clearly defined and bi -dimensionally measurable. The cyst itself should not be 
considered measurable or non- measureable disease.  
 Target lesions:  All measurable lesions that are residual of the lesion treated with MLA 
should be identified as target l esions and recorded and measured .  Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in 
which circumstance the next largest lesion , which can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  When there are too many measurable lesions, choose the largest 3 lesions as target lesions to follow.  The other measurable lesions should be considered evaluable for the purpose of objective status determination.  
 Non-target lesions:  All non-measurable lesions should be identified as non- target lesions 
and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
 
12.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler .  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 2 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable on brain MRI when 
they are ≥  5 mm diameter as assessed using a ruler.  
 
Histology:  This technique  can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) and 
complete responses (CR) in rare cases when biopsy or surgical resection of a measureable 
lesion is clinically indicated.  
 
Perfusion/CBV: This advanced brain MRI technique can be used as an adjunct test to 
determine treatment response or disease status.  However, it should not be used as the primary or sole method to determine response or disease status.   Brain FDG -PET coupled with head CT or brain MRI:  This advanced metabolic 
imaging technique can be used as an adjunct test to determine response or disease status. 
However it should be used as the primary or sole method of determining response or disease status.  
 
12.3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disapp earance of all target lesions.  
 Partial Response (PR):   ≥ 50% decrease compared with baseline in the sum of 
Version 01/24/[ADDRESS_352284] 4 
weeks.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 25 % increase in the sum of products of 
perpendicular diameters of at least [ADDRESS_352285] 
sum of products of perpendicular diameters on study (this includes the baseline sum 
if that is the smallest on study).  The absolute increase in any dimension must be at 
least 5mm when calculating the products of perpendicular diameters.  
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of products of perpendicular diameters while on study. 
 
12.3.2 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non -target lesions .  
 Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of o ne or more non- target lesion(s).  
 Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions  on stable or increasing doses 
of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of 
therapy
* not caused by [CONTACT_186754] (e.g. radiation therapy, demyelination, 
ischemic injury, infection, seizures, postoperative changes, or other treatment 
effects). Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status.  
It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_36408], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investiga tor). 
 
12.3.[ADDRESS_352286] response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 Duration of stable disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 51 of 72 14.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
14.1 Definition of Primary Endpoint 
 
The maximum tole rated dose (MTD) of DSF  with concurrent RT +TMZ  will be defined as 
the dose associated with a 20% probability of dose -limiting toxicity (DLT). Toxicity will 
be coded using CTCAE version 4.0, and DLT will be defined as toxi city that occurs within 
[ADDRESS_352289] day of RT and is possibly, probably or definitely related to DSF /Cu 
(or 12 weeks from the completion of RT if there is a delay/interruption of RT). 
 For the expansion cohort of GBM with IDH, BRAF, and NF1  mutations, the overall 
survival  (OS)  of this molecularly -defined cohort  will be measured from the first day  of RT.  
 
14.2 Definition of Secondary and Exploratory Endpoints  
 
1. The adverse events will be  graded by [CONTACT_288887] 4.0.  
2. Progression- free survival (PFS) will be determined from the first day of RT to the time 
of tumor progression or death, whichever occurs first. Tumor progression will be determined using the RANO criteria.  
3. Intratumor and plasma concentration of DSF  metabolite (ditiocarb -copper complex) 
will be determined using mass spectrometer  method . 
4. Pharmacodynamics studies on glutamate metabolism will include measurement of 
glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, glucose, and lactate levels in blood and tumor tissues  
using mass spectrometry  method.  
5. Pseudo- progression is defined as a transient  increase of tumor after chemoradiotherapy  
that subsequently stabilizes without a change of therapy.    
 
14.3 Analytic Plan for Primary Endpoint  
 
14.3.1 Background of Time -to-Event Continual Reassessment Method ( TITE-
CRM ) and Trial R ules 
 
The standard phase I 3+3 design is poorly suited for trials of RT , for which 
toxicities may occur up to several months after treatment. In this case, the 3+[ADDRESS_352290] to openings and closings as patients present after a dose level potentially has filled, but before sufficient time has elapsed to be certain that treatment has not produced DLT.  
 As such, dose escalation for this trial will be guided by [CONTACT_288888] -to-Event Continual 
Reassessment Method (TITE -CRM).  TITE -CRM seeks to determine the target 
dose, defined as the dose most closely identified with the target rate, which is the largest accep table probability of toxicity, determined a priori by [CONTACT_288889] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_32270] 5% and 25%). As the trial progresses and patients do or do not experience toxicities at different doses, th e estimates of probability of toxicity are recalculated using a 
Version 01/24/25 , Amendment 6  Page 52 of 72 Bayesian expectation, and subsequent patients are assigned to doses under the 
principle to always treat at the target dose.  In a Monte Carlo simulation of 60,000 
phase I trials comparing 3+3 design to TITE -CRM in studies with delayed toxicity, 
the TITE- CRM trials were significantly shorter when toxicity observation times are 
long, treated more patients at or above the MTD , identified the MTD more 
accurately, but did not expose patients to significant additional risk [ 79]. 
Additionally, given that TITE -CRM concentrates most of th e accrual around the 
MTD , early estimates of efficacy are possible for a phase I trial.  
 The Time -to-Event Continual Reassessment Method (TITE -CRM) proposed by 
[CONTACT_288890] I design [ 80]. In a TITE- CRM clinical 
trial, patients enroll as they become available to be studied. Each participant is 
assigned to a dose level from a set of dose levels pre- defined by [CONTACT_288891]. The design is adaptive in that the dose level assigned to a ne wly enrolled patient depends on the dose level assignments and 
DLT  outcomes of the patients already in the study.  A patient's observation period 
ends at the occurrence of a DLT , or if a DLT does  not occur, after a fixed time T  of 
follow -up. The trial end s when a fixed number of patients, n, have been observed. 
Once the final patient has been observed, the MTD can be estimated using the available data. The TITE -CRM differs from the traditional CRM in that the 
estimation process is weighted to account for t he proportion of the observation 
period that each currently enrolled patient has been observed.  By [CONTACT_288892], new participants can be assigned a dose and begin evaluation as they become av ailable, subsequently 
shortening the overall duration of the study.  
 The Biostatistics Unit at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center has developed a program titecrm.sas for SAS 9 (SAS Institute, Inc.; Cary, NC) that 
makes all of the calculations necessary to determine dose allocation of a trial in real-time.  They have also developed simulation programs that allow the user to 
determine the efficacy of the trial based on a priori  estimates of the probabilities of 
toxicity and necessary sample sizes.   
 In order to properly utilize this type of trial, a few assumptions and many rules must be determined before the start of the trial.  The main assumption that must be determined is how many different dose levels will be included in the trial and a priori  estimates of the probability of a DLT at each of those dose levels.  For this 
trial, we have 4 dose levels (d
1,…, d 4) ranging from 125mg PO daily to 500 mg PO 
daily, with initial toxicity probability estimates (p 1,…, p 4) ranging from 0.05 to 
0.30, respective ly.  The following table shows the dose design with associated 
estimated probabilities of toxicity.  
  
Version 01/24/[ADDRESS_352291] information about the MTD will be obtained if many 
patients are treated at or near the MTD, thus the sooner the choice of dose can 
converge on the MTD the more effective the trial will be. However, with concerns about safety we will start a t the one dose level lower than the expected MTD . 
Therefore, our starting dose for this trial will be 250  mg PO daily.   
 The next thing to be considered is the dose escalation rules.  For this trial, we will only allow a single dose level escalation per new patient enrolled on the trial.  
Therefore, if the previous patient was treated at dose level, d
k, then a new patient 
can only be treated at dose levels d k+[ADDRESS_352292] to the target probability even if it has a higher estimated probability. For this trial we set the admissible margin to be 5%, therefore,  the MTD will be chosen as 
the dose that yields a posterior toxicity estimate closest to 20% while being between 15% and 25%.  The admissible margin is also used to help determine stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_288872].  In order to account for the possibility of poor initial outcomes we will employ a run- in of [ADDRESS_352293] dose 
level has a posterior probability higher than 25% then  the trial will stop.   
 
14.3.3 Simulation and S ample S ize C alculations  
 
The TITE- CRM manual details methods for utilizing trial simulation in order to 
obtain estimated posterior probabilities on toxicity estimates.  We utilize  the 
Version 01/24/[ADDRESS_352294] power calculation for this type of trial, 
the effectiveness of the trial’s sample size can be determined by [CONTACT_288893].  We ran 
1000 simulations under various increasing and decreasing prior probability estimates utilizing the previously described rules and assumptions for this trial and found that we wi ll be able to determine the MTD with 18 patients. Simulations 
showed that approximately 98% of the time the trial will come to completion after [ADDRESS_352295] dose level more than 95% 
of the time.  Therefore, the sample size of this adaptive phase I/II study will be [ADDRESS_352296] patient will be enrolled on the trial and treated at the 250  mg PO daily 
dose level, which is one dose level below the hypothesized MTD.  That patient will be entered into the titecrm.sas program and follow -up will begin from start of 
treatment (RT+TMZ+DSF+Cu) .  Although the entire study duration is [ADDRESS_352297] a delay in their treatment resulting in 
the need for a prolonged observation period (at least 12 weeks after completion of 
RT if there is delay/interruption of RT). This delay will be accounted for as needed 
for this study to ensure completed [ADDRESS_352298] 
occurred. The posterior probability and 95% credible intervals of dose limiting toxicity for each dose level is calculated.  At this point, the model determines the 
dose level that has an estimated toxicity rate closet to 20% within the 5% admissible 
margin.  The newly enrolled patient will be enrolled in the corresponding dose level 
if that dose level is within one dose jump from the dose level the most current 
patient is enrolled on.  If the suggested dose level is more than one dose level from the current dose level , the next patient will be enrolled on the dose level that is 
closest to the current level in the direction of the dose level determined from the 
estimated posterior probability.  This continues until the trial has accrued all [ADDRESS_352299] dose level is  higher t han 25% .  
 
Version 01/24/[ADDRESS_352300] of the addition of DSF/Cu to standard 
chemoradiotherpay for the subset of GBM with IDH/BRFA/NF1  mutation s, we 
propose to add an expansion cohort to further confirm that the addition of DSF/Cu to chemoradiotherapy may be a promising strategy to treat GBM with these mutations. Given historical data for a cohort of GBM is not readily available, some assumptions are used to derive a historical control benchmark. GBM with BRAF or 
NF1 mutations are not known to have different prognos is than typi[INVESTIGATOR_288873]-
wildtype GBM [ 81,82] , with historical OS of approximately 30% at 2 years and 
10% at 5 ye ars [3,83,84 ]. Both BRAF and NF1 mutations affect the RAS /MAPK  
pathway and can also occur in the same patient, thus we will combine both mutations into one molecular cohort. However, IDH-mutant GBM is known to have 
better OS than IDH- wildtype GBM, with 2 year OS of approximately 50% and 5 
year OS of approximately 20% [ 85], so we will define the second molecular cohort 
by [CONTACT_288894] .  Therefore, a cohort with equal proportion of 
IDH- mutant GBM and BRAF/NF1 -mutant GBM should theoretically have 2 year 
OS of 40% and 5- year OS of 15%. Based on such assumptions, a sample size of 24 
patients (including 12 with IDH mutations and 12 with BRAF/NF1  mutations) 
would provide 80% power with one -sided alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_352301] an improvement 
of 2- year OS from historical 40% to 60% (or a hazard ratio of 0.55). Since we have 
already enrolled 9 patients with these mutations (6 with IDH mutat ion, 2 with BRAF 
mutation, and 1 with NF1  mutation), only additional 15 patients will be needed: 6 
with IDH mutation, 9 patients with BRAF and/or NF1 mutation s.  For the dose -
expansion phase, patients are considered evaluable if a patient has received at least 
4 weeks of DSF with RT, at either the MTD (375mg/day) or the RP2D 
(250mg/day). Inevaluable patients will be replaced.

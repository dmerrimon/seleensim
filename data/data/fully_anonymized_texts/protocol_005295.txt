Background  
The Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14907] (EGFR) is highly expressed in SCCHN and its overexpression is 
associated with poor patient outcome. EGFR is a promising target of anticancer therapy. We have 
developed EGFR antisense DNA as a safe and potentially effica cious treatment for SCCHN as shown in a 
previous phase I study conducted at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]. Cetuximab (Erbitux or C225) is a 
chimerized EGFR monoclonal antibody that has produced positive results in a phase III trial in SCCHN 
when added to ra diation therapy and was approved by [CONTACT_865510]. Radiation plus cetuximab is considered a standard treatment, especially for patients who are not 
good candidates for chemotherapy. In the current study, we plan to eva luate the addition of intratumoral 
EGFR antisense DNA (EGFR AS) to standard radiation with concurrent cetuximab.  
 
Objectives  
1. To evaluate the safety of the combination of intratumoral EGFS AS DNA with standard cetuximab and 
radiation.  
2. To evaluate the locoregional progression -free survival in selected patients with locally advanced 
SCCHN treated with intratumoral EGFR AS DNA combi ned with standard radiation plus  cetuximab.  
3. To evaluate other efficacy parameters, including the objective response rate, distant control and 
overall progression -free survival, and overall survival.  
4. To determine the effect of EGFR antisense therapy on EGFR -related biomarkers. We will use reverse 
phase protein microarrays (RPPA) and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of tissue microarrays 
(TMA), on baseline and post -treatment tumor tissue, to determine the expression level and modulation 
of a panel of EGFR a nd EGFR -pathway related biomarkers, including (but not necessarily limited to) 
EGFR, pEGFR, Src, pMAPK, STAT3, pSTAT3, pSTAT5, pSTAT1, pAKT, p38, p21, p27, PARP, E - 
cadherin, p -ErbB3, and Ki67.  
5. To examine the transfection of the EGFR antisense gene therapy  in vivo. 
 
Subject population  
We will enroll patients with SCCHN who are suitable for intratumoral injections of EGFR antisense. Please 
see section [ADDRESS_1207274] visualizat ion, endoscopy, or 
imaging -guidance (ultrasound) as clinically determined (see sections 5 and 7 for detailed treatment plan 
and dose modifications). Patients will receive a total of up to 7 weekly intratumoral injections of EGFR 
antisense (or less if there  is no identifiable tumor) starting 2 weeks prior to radiation (see schema on the 
next page). Patients will receive standard radiation 70 Gy/200 cGy/daily, 5 days/week, with concurrent 
cetuximab 250 mg/m2, after a loading dose of 400 mg/m2 2 weeks prior to  starting radiation.

1. BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
 
Approximately 40,000 new cases of head and neck cancer are diagnosed annually in the [LOCATION_002].1 
Of these patients, two -thirds present with locoregionally advanced disease (AJCC stage III or IV) and one - 
third with early stage disease (AJCC stage I or II). At presentation 10% of patients may be found to have 
involvement of distant organs, most common ly the lung. In addition, 20% of patients will develop clinically 
detected distant metastases over the course of their disease. In autopsy series up to 50% of patients with 
head and neck cancer are found to have metastases.2,3 Approximately 90% of all head  and neck 
malignancies are squamous cell carcinomas.  
 
1.1 Locoregionally Advanced Disease (AJCC Stages III and  IV) 
 
Systemic agents, such as traditional chemotherapy and more recently cetuximab, an EGFR 
inhibitor, have been incorporated into the standard therapy of locally advanced HNSCC. For 
certain primary sites, such as oropharynx, nasopharynx, and larynx, nonsurgica l management with 
radiation plus systemic therapy is favored because it leads to good survival results and potentially 
better function outcomes and organ preservation. For patients with resectable locally advanced 
head and neck cancer, surgery and postoper ative radiation plus cisplatin is now considered 
standard therapy.  
 
A meta -analysis that included 63 randomized studies conducted between 1965 and 1993, 
demonstrated an absolute survival benefit of 8% at [ADDRESS_1207275] of these studies favored concomitant chemoradiotherapy with an 
approximately 20% gain in survival at three to five years (approximately 30% versus 50%), 
whereas the study by [CONTACT_865511].10 Cetuximab has been 
added to radiation in a large randomized  study.11 
 
1.2 Comorbidities in Patients with Head  and Neck  Cancer  
 
Due to their frequent history of exposure to tobacco and alcohol patients with head and neck 
cancer are in high risk for other co -morbidities associated with tobacco and alcohol, such as 
coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and l iver disease.12,13 These 
comorbidities are significantly increased in the elderly.14 In addition, patients with head and neck 
cancer are at high risk for the development of second primary tumors, synchronous or 
metachronous, that may involve the head and n eck region as well as other organs, predominantly 
the lung.15,16 A significant number of patients are ineligible for clinical trials due to poor 
performance status or comorbidities. The experience with chemotherapy and radiotherapy in these 
patients as wel l as the elderly is limited.

1.3 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14907]  (EGFR)  
 
The epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) is a member of the erb B receptor tyrosine kinase 
family that includes erb B -2, erb B -3, and erb B -4.17 It consists of an extracellular ligand -binding 
domain, a transmembrane region that anchors the receptor to t he plasma membrane, and a 
cytoplasmic region containing a tyrosine kinase domain. Among the known natural ligands of 
EGFR include epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169]  (EGF) and transfo rming growth factor  
(TGF-
) which both 
activate the receptor by [CONTACT_865512], followed by [CONTACT_865513]/ligand complex and auto - 
phosphorylation. It is now accepted that the EGFR signal tr ansduction network plays an important 
role in multiple tumorigenic processes, including cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, and 
metastasis, as well as protection from apoptosis.17,18 In this signal network, erb B -2 is the major 
partner of EGFR because ac tivated heterodimer complexes containing erb B -2 are more stable at 
the cell surface than complexes containing other EGFR family members.19,20 In addition erb B -2 
can decrease the rate of ligand dissociation from the cognate receptor EGFR.21 
 
1.4 Cetuximab  
 
Cetuximab binds specifically to the EGFR on both normal and tumor cells, and competitively 
inhibits the binding of epi[INVESTIGATOR_11915], such as transforming growth 
factor –alpha.22 Binding of cetuximab to the EGFR blocks phosphorylation and activation of 
receptor -associated kinases, resulting in inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, and 
decreased matrix metalloproteinase and vascular endothelial growth factor production. The EGFR 
is constitutively expressed in many normal epi [INVESTIGATOR_27771], including the skin and hair follicle.  
 
Human Pharmacokinetics  
 
Cetuximab administered as monotherapy or in combination with concomitant 
chemotherapy or radiotherapy exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics.22 The area under the 
concentration ti me curve (AUC) increased in a greater than dose proportional manner as 
the dose increased from 20 to 400 mg/m2. Cetuximab clearance (CL) decreased from 0.08 
to 0.02 L/h/m2 as the dose increased from 20 to 200 mg/m2, and at doses >200 mg/m2, it 
appeared to plateau. The volume of distribution (Vd) for cetuximab appeared to be 
independent of dose and approximated the vascular space of 2 -3 L/m2. 
 
Following a 2 -hour infusion of 400 mg/m2 of cetuximab, the maximum mean serum 
concentration (C max) was 184 µg/mL (ra nge: 92 -327 µg/mL) and the mean elimination 
half-life was 97 hours (range 41 -213 hours). A 1 -hour infusion of 250 mg/m2 produced a 
mean C max of 140 µg/mL (range 120 -170 µg/mL). Following the recommended dose 
regimen (400 mg/m2 initial dose/250 mg/m2 weekly  dose), cetuximab concentrations 
reached steady -state levels by [CONTACT_865514] 168 to 235 and 41 to 85 µg/mL, respectively. 
The mean half -life was 114 hours (range 75 -188 hours ).

Clinical Studies of Cetuximab in Head and Neck Cancer  
 
The addition of cetuximab to radiation produced promising results in a phase I trial in 
patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer.23 Sixteen patients were treated with 
radiation therapy plus cetuximab. Cetuximab was delivered as a loading dose of  100 to 
500 mg/m2, followed by [CONTACT_865515] 100 to 250 mg/m2 for [ADDRESS_1207276] acute adverse effects were associated with radiation 
(xerostomia, mucositis, and local skin toxicity). All patients achieved  an objective response 
(13 patients had a complete response). Based on these promising results, a phase III trial 
of radiation with or without cetuximab in stage III/IV head and neck cancer was conducted 
and recently reported results. The addition of cetux imab resulted in improved locoregional 
control and survival whereas the rate of mucositis was comparable between arms (see 
more details below).24 Based on the results of this study, cetuximab was approved by [CONTACT_865516] -based  chemotherapy.  
 
The efficacy and safety of cetuximab were studied in combination with radiation therapy in 
a randomized, controlled trial of 424 patients with locally or regionally advanced squamous 
cell carcinoma of the head and neck versus radiation alone. In a multicenter controlled 
clinical tri al, 424 patients with Stage III/IV SCC of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx 
with no prior therapy were randomized 1:1 to receive cetuximab plus radiation therapy 
(211 patients) or radiation therapy alone (213 patients). Stratification factors were 
Karnofsky Performance Status (60 -80 versus 90 -100), nodal stage (N0 versus N+), tumor 
stage (T1 -3 versus T4 using American Joint Committee on Cancer 1998 staging criteria), 
and radiation therapy fractionation (concomitant boost versus once -daily versus twice 
daily). Radiation therapy was administered for [ADDRESS_1207277]. The planned radiation therapy regimen was chosen by [CONTACT_865517]. For patients with ≥N1 neck disease, a post -radiation therap y neck 
dissection was recommended. Starting 1 week before radiation, cetuximab was 
administered as a 400 mg/m2 initial dose, followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly for the duration of 
radiation therapy (6 -7 weeks). All cetuximab -treated patients received a 20 mg tes t dose 
on Day 1. Cetuximab was administered 1 hour prior to radiation therapy, beginning  week  
2. Of the 424 randomized patients, 80% were male and 83% were Caucasian. The median 
age was 57 years (range 34 -83). There were 258 patients enrolled in US sites (61% ) and 
166 patients (39%) in non -US sites. Ninety percent of patients had baseline Karnofsky 
Performance Status 80% or greater; 60% had oropharyngeal, 25% laryngeal, and 15% 
hypopharyngeal primary tumors; 28% had AJCC T4 tumor stage. The patient 
characteris tics were similar across the study arms. Fifty -six percent of the patients 
received radiation therapy with concomitant boost, 26% received once -daily regimen, and 
18% twice -daily regimen.  
 
The primary endpoint of this phase III randomized trial was locoreg ional control and the 
sample size was adequate to show a 13% improvement in 1 -year locoregional control 
(from 44% to 57%). Study results were remarkable and demonstrated an overwhelming 
superiority of the combined modality arm versus the radiation alone ar m: locoregional 
control rate at 2 years was 50% versus 41% (HR 0.68, p=0.005); progression -free survival 
at 2 years was 46% vs. 37% (HR 0.70, p=0.006); overall survival at 3 years was 55% vs.  
CTRC# 11 -47

45% and the median survival 49 vs. 29 months (HR  0.74, p=0.03). The survival advantage 
achieved with the addition of cetuximab to radiation is comparable with the one achieved 
with the addition of chemotherapy to radiation. In a meta -analysis, the addition of 
concurrent chemotherapy to radiotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced SCCHN 
was shown to result in an 8% survival benefit at [ADDRESS_1207278] dreadful to xicities of combined modality therapy, were 
comparable between the two arms. Dermatologic toxicities, such as acneiform rash and 
pruritus, and infusional reactions were predominantly seen, as expected, in the cetuximab 
arm. Late toxicities were also compar able between the two  arms.

Single -Arm Trial in SCCHN  
 
Cetuximab alone was studied in a single -arm, multicenter clinical trial in [ADDRESS_1207279] dose of 
cetuximab on Day 1, followed by a 400 mg/m2 initial dose, and 250 mg/m2 weekly until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Upon progression, patients were given the 
option of receiving cetuximab plus the platinum regimen that they failed prior to  
enrollment. Tumor response and progression were assessed by [CONTACT_865518] (IRC). The median age was 57 years (range 23 -77), 82% 
were male, 100% Caucasian, and 62% had a Karnofsky Performance Status of 80% or 
higher. The objective response rate on the monotherapy phase was 13% (95% confidence 
interval (7% -21%). Median duration of response was 5.8 months (range 1.2 -5.8 months). 
Since expression of EGFR has been detected in nearly all patients with head  and neck 
cancer, patients enrolled in the head and neck cancer clinical studies were not required to 
have immunohistochemical evidence of EGFR expression prior to study  entry.  
CTRC# [ADDRESS_1207280] exposure to cetuximab in 208 
patients with locally or regionally advanced SCCHN who received cetuximab in 
combination with radiation. Cetuximab was administered as monotherapy in 103 p atients 
with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. Of the 103 patients receiving cetuximab 
monotherapy, 53 continued to a second phase with the combination of cetuximab plus 
chemotherapy. Patients receiving cetuximab plus radiation therapy received a median of 8 
doses (range 1 -11 infusions). The population had a median age of 56; 81% were male and 
84% Caucasian. Patients receiving cetuximab monotherapy received a median of 11 
doses (range 1 -45 infusions). The population had a median age of 57; 82% were male and 
100% Caucasian. The most serious adverse reactions associated with cetuximab in 
combination with radiation therapy in patients with head and neck cancer were:  
 
• Infusion reaction  (3%)  
• Cardiopulmonary arrest  (2%)  
• Dermatologic toxicity  (2.5%)  
• Mucositis  (6%)  
• Radiation dermatitis (3%)  
• Confusion (2%)  
• Diarrhea (2%)  
 
Fourteen (7%) patients receiving cetuximab plus radiation therapy and 5 (5%) patients 
receiving cetuximab monotherapy discontinued treatment primarily because of adverse

Late Radiation Toxicity  
 
The overall incidence of late radiation toxicities (any grade) was higher in cetuximab in 
combination with radiation therapy compared with radiation therapy alone. The following 
sites were affected: sali vary glands (65% versus 56%), larynx (52% versus 36%),  
subcutaneous tissue (49% versus 45%), mucous membrane (48% versus 39%),  
esophagus (44% versus 35%), skin (42% versus 33%), brain (11% versus 9%), lung (11%  
versus 8%), spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (4% versus 3%), and b one (4% versus 5%). The incidence of  
CTRC# [ADDRESS_1207281] previously demonstrated up -regulation of EGFR (mRNA and protein) in t umors and 
normal mucosa several centimeters away from the tumor, compared with expression levels in 
normal mucosa from patients without cancer.27,28 We also detected increased EGFR levels in 
premalignant lesions (that correlate with the degree of dysplasia) which progress to invasive 
cancer suggesting that up -regulation of EGFR occurs early in squamous epi[INVESTIGATOR_865470].[ADDRESS_1207282] designed for intratumoral injection. The criteria for selecting a gene transfe r 
vector were to: 1) transfect a high percentage of tumor cells in vivo ; 2) generate high expression 
levels of EGFR antisense RNA in each cell; and 3) demonstrate an anti -tumor response following 
treatment. To accomplish this, we selected the U6 small nucl ear RNA promoter, which has been 
engineered to express short antisense RNA sequences under the control of RNA polymerase III.31 
U6 is a small, stable RNA that exists as an abundant nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U6 snRNP) in all 
human cells where it plays cent ral roles in both spliceosome assembly and catalysis in nuclear  
pre-mRNA splicing. Compared with other RNA polymerase III -transcribed genes, such as tRNA, 
the U6 gene has no control region located within the sequence encoding the structural component 
of the RNA. Thus, nearly all of the structural U6 core can be replaced with any other sequence 
without affecting transcript production.32 
 
We cloned an oligonucleotide (39 bp) targeting the ATG start site of human EGFR in the antisense 
orientation under the con trol of the U6 promoter into the pNGVL1 plasmid backbone containing a 
kanamycin resistance marker. The pNGV1 plasmid had been previously approved for use in 
clinical trials. The pNGVL1 backbone was modified to eliminate the residual CMV promoter 
sequences to avoid potential interference with the U6  promoter.  
 
Using a murine xenograft head and neck squamous cell carcinoma model system, repeated 
intratumoral administration of the antisense (but not the corresponding sense) EGFR gene therapy 
construct (25 µg/3 x week for a total of approximately 8 injections), significantly inhibited the growth 
of established tumors (approximately 2 mm in diameter). The inhibition of tumor growth was 
sustained up to several weeks following cessation of therapy. Examination of th e treated tumor 
nodules revealed diminished expression of the EGFR protein. Although the mechanism of  
CTRC# [ADDRESS_1207283] suggested that liposomes only modestly augment gene transfer in vivo and 
may contribute to toxicity. We subsequently repeated our experiments in tumor -bearing animals 
and found that anti -tumor effects were observed without the use of liposomes. Therefore, we used 
injection of DNA alone (naked DNA) in our phase I clinical study.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1207284] that 60 µg of antisense DNA decreases tumor progression.33 
Therefore, we implemented a rapid dose escalation (100% increment increase between tiers) in 
the phase I clinical study of EGFR AS. Eli gible patients had recurrent SCCHN and have previously 
failed other treatments. Patients received weekly intratumoral injections for 4 weeks. The dose of 
EGFR AS was escalated in successive cohorts of patients (classic “3+3” design) as follows: level  1 
- 60 µg/60 µL, level 2 - 120 µg/120 µL, level 3 - 240 µg/240 µL, level 4 - 480 µg/480 µL, level 5 - 
960 µg/960 µL, and level 6 - 1.92 mg/1.92 mL. A total of 17 patients were enrolled. We reported 
results at the ASCO 2007 meeting.35 No grade 3 or 4 or any dose  limiting toxicities were observed 
at any dose level. A dose of up to 1.92 mg/1.92 mL of EGFR AS was well tolerated. There were 
four adverse events related to EGFR AS in this trial. All events were grade 1 and included two 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_865471]/s welling, one epi[INVESTIGATOR_865472]. No 
dose limiting toxicities were observed at any dose level. One patient developed dehydration that 
was thought to be unrelated to the drug injection. Five of 17 patients (29%) achieved an objectiv e 
response: 2 patients had a complete response and 3 patients had a partial response. In order to 
demonstrate transfection of the EGFR AS gene into the tumors, we performed polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) analysis on DNA extracted from pre - and post -treatm ent patient tissue specimens. 
We were able to detect EGFR AS in the tissue specimens taken two weeks after the last EGFR AS 
injection in both non -responders and responders. Moreover, we observed that STAT3 and EGFR 
expression levels at baseline correlated with efficacy outcomes. The final manuscript is in 
preparation.

and neck cancer, and may improve efficacy without significantly increasin g toxicity. Cetuximab is 
an EGFR inhibitor that is a potent radiosensitizer and has increased the survival of patients with 
stage III/IV head and neck cancer when added to radiation therapy. We would like to enhance the 
standard therapy of locally advanced  SCCHN by [CONTACT_865519], a 
novel and promising locoregional treatment, to standard radiation and cetuximab. We hypothesize 
that the addition of a second EGFR -targeted agent that inhibits EGFR at the intracellular level will 
improve the antitumor effect of standard radiation and cetuximab. Preliminary preclinical data from 
our group support this hypothesis. Based on our data, intratumoral EGFR AS therapy has shown 
promise as single treatment modality. The addition of EGFR AS t o standard radiation and 
cetuximab may further increase treatment efficacy and is of major interest. The goal of this study is 
to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and secondarily, the biologic effects in patients with locally 
advanced SCCHN of an antisense g ene targeting the EGFR in combination with standard  therapy

2. OBJECTIVES  
 
• To evaluate the safety of the combination of intratumoral EGFR AS DNA with standard cetuximab 
and radiation.  
• To evaluate the locoregional control (primary endpoint), in patients with locally advanced SCCHN 
treated with intratumoral EGFR antisense DNA combi ned with standard radiation plus  cetuximab.  
• To evaluate the toxicities associated with the above  treatment.  
• To evaluate other efficacy parameters, including the objective response rate, distant control and 
overall progression -free survival, and overall sur vival.  
• To determine the effect of EGFR antisense therapy on EGFR and EGFR -related biomarkers. We 
will use reverse phase protein microarrays (RPPA) and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of 
tissue microarrays (TMA), on baseline and post -treatment tumor tiss ue, to determine the 
expression level and modulation of a panel of EGFR and EGFR -pathway related biomarkers, 
including (but not necessarily limited to) EGFR, pEGFR, Src, pMAPK, STAT3, pSTAT3, pSTAT5, 
pSTAT1, pAKT, p38, p21, p27, PARP, E -cadherin, p -ErbB3, and Ki67. We hypothesize that the 
baseline expression or modulation of one or more EGFR signaling proteins will correlate with 
objective response rate and locoregional control after combined modality  treatment.  
• To examine the transfection of the EGFR antis ense gene therapy in  vivo.

5. TREATMENT  PLAN  
 
• Loading dose of cetuximab 400 mg/m2 IV over 120 minutes 2 weeks prior to starting  radiation.  
• Cetuximab 250 mg/m2 IV over 60 minutes weekly, the week prior and during days of radiation, until 
radiation is completed (diphenhydramine hydrochloride [Benadryl] premedication 30 -60 minutes 
prior to cetuximab infusion as required, see  5.1).  
• Intratumoral EGFR AS injections we ekly x 7 weeks (or less if there is no identifiable tumor), 
starting 2 weeks prior to radiation and after cetuximab is administered. Subsequent EGFR AS 
injections can be given before or after cetuximab is administered. Injections will be in the primary 
and/or lymph nodes. One site will be injected per weekly session. The intratumoral EGFR AS 
injections should occur during the same calendar day due to CTRC scheduling. If it is necessary 
the antisense injection can be scheduled within 1 business day of the or iginal schedule date and 
then resume the original  schedule.  
• EGFR AS will be administered by [CONTACT_865521], 
endoscopy, or imaging -guidance (ultrasound) as clinically determined. The same lesion (primary 
tumor or ly mph node) will be injected during  treatment.  
• Radiation therapy 70 Gy, 200 cGy/daily, 5 days/week (see 5.3). Radiation will start on a Monday, 
Tuesday, or Wednesday. Cetuximab will be given prior to  radiation.  
• A tumor biopsy will be performed prior to starting cetuximab and 2 weeks later but prior to starting 
radiation.  
• In the first stage, after three (3) subjects are enrolled and have received all EGFR AS injections, 
there will be a two -week waiting period to a ssess adverse events before enrolling additional 
subjects. After the two -week period, additional subjects may be  enrolled.  
 
5.1 Cetuximab Administration  
 
In an effort to prevent an infusion reaction, all patients should be premedicated with 
diphenhydramine hyd rochloride [Benadryl] 50 mg (or an equivalent antihistamine) by [CONTACT_483943] [ADDRESS_1207288] dose of cetuximab. Premedication may be administered prior to 
subsequent doses, but at the Investigator’s discretion, the dose of diphenhydramine (or  a similar 
agent) may be reduced.  
CTRC# 11 -47 
Version  date January  13, 2015  13 of 53 Confidential   
  
 
The initial dose of cetuximab is 400 mg/m2 intravenously administered over 120 minutes, followed 
by [CONTACT_865522] 250 mg/m2 IV over [ADDRESS_1207289] never 
exceed 5 mL/mi n. Patients must be continuously observed during the infusion for signs of 
anaphylaxis.  
 
Patients will be closely monitored for treatment -related adverse events, especially infusion 
reactions (see management of cetuximab adverse events) during the infusion  and the post - 
infusion observation hour, if necessary. For the initial cetuximab infusion, vital signs should be 
monitored pre -infusion, ½ hour into the infusion, and at the end of the infusion, and, if needed, [ADDRESS_1207290] -infusion; 
however, it is recommended that the patient be observed for [ADDRESS_1207291] will be observed for >1 hour, if necessary.  
 
 
For the duration that patients are on study therapy, adverse event monitoring will be done 
continuously. Patients will be evaluated for adverse events at each visit and are to be instructed to 
call their physician to report any adverse events between visit s. 
 
5.2 Intratumoral EGFR AS 
Injections  
The treatment will be administered in the outpatient setting . Pretreatment tumor biopsies 
will be performed in the operating room at the time of diagnosis or in the outpatient setting 
under local anesthesia. Intralesional (primary tumor or cervical metastases) EGFR AS will 
be administered weekly until there is no ide ntifiable tumor or a maximum of 7 weeks.  
 
• EGFR AS will be administered by [CONTACT_865523], endoscopy, or imaging -guidance (ultrasound) as clinically determined. 
Injection sites may be treated before injection with E MLA cream (or equivalent) to 
minimize discomfort. The primary tumor or cervical metastases will be injected with a 
single dose of DNA and monitored. The tumor will be inoculated with a 25 -gauge 
needle in an attempt to maximize the distribution of the gene transfer formulation in 
the injected lesion. Specifically, the needle will be introduced into the center of the 
tumor and the injection will be performed slowly as the needle is withdrawn from the 
tumor. Each dose will be given 7 days (+/ - 2 days) after th e previous dose. The same 
lesion (primary tumor or lymph node), which will be the dominant and most accessible, 
will be injected during treatment in each patient. In the first stage, after three (3) 
subjects are enrolled and have received all EGFR AS injec tions, there will be a two - 
week waiting period to assess adverse events. After the two -week period, additional 
subjects may be enrolled.  
 
To determine the in vivo efficacy of the antisense gene and the consequences of EGFR 
antisense gene therapy, we will obtain tumor biopsies under local anesthesia in the  
CTRC# [ADDRESS_1207292] of EGFR AS. Prior injection sites will be 
marked and attempts will be made to perform biopsies in the area of prior i noculation(s).  
Biopsies will be delivered to Drs. Carew and Nawrocki’s laboratory at CTRC and to [CONTACT_865561]’ laboratory at UPCI for molecular studies. The presence of EGFR antisense DNA 
in the tumors will be determined using PCR. EGFR and EGFR pathway wil l be evaluated 
using RPPAs and IHC (see correlative studies section).

EGFR AS Dose  
 
Patients will receive a total EGFR AS dose of 1.92mg/1.78mL on each weekly treatment. 
This dose may be delivered equally in the same tumor site per weekly session, the primary 
tumor or cervical lymph nodes.  
 
Dose/Schedule Modifications  
 
There will be no do se reductions. However, weekly doses will be omitted in the setting of 
locoregional toxicities (even if those are thought to be related to radiation).  
CTRC# 11 -47 
Version  date January  13, 2015  15 of 53 Confidential   
  
 
Based on prior experience, the expected toxicities of EGFR AS therapy may include local 
discomfort at the injection site, edema, bleeding and cutaneous erythema when the 
treatment is administered.  
 
Treatment with EGFR AS will be held in the setting of grade 3 or 4 mucositis/dermatitis.  
 
Treatment with EGFR AS will be discontinued if there is c ellulitis at the injection site 
requiring antibiotic therapy or grade 4 locoregional toxicities within the injected site 
develop (such as bleeding or tissue necrosis).  
 
Duration of Therapy  
 
Each patient will receive up to 7 weekly treatments. Treatment may be discontinued earlier 
if there is no identifiable tumor, a patient withdraws from study, develops intolerable 
toxicities, or their disease progresses (see section 7.8).  
 
Gene Transfer Efficiency and Biologic Activity  
 
These studies require a tissue biopsy and will be performed prior to initiation of therapy 
and on the second week of therapy. Tumor tissue will be biopsied for molecular studies as 
defined elsewhere. In order  to demonstrate transfection of the EGFR AS gene into the 
tumors, we will perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis on DNA extracted from 
pre- and post -treatment patient tissue specimens. Samples will be taken directly to [CONTACT_865562]’ laboratory and  the assays will be performed under her direction at the time points 
indicated above.  Samples from San Antonio will be sent to [CONTACT_865563] via Drs. Carew 
and Nawrocki’s laboratory.

5.3.1 Physical  Factors  
 
Equipment: Linear accelerator with appropriate photon and electron energies for 
supplemental boosting to the nodes.  
 
Photon energies of 4 to 6 MV and/or appropriate electron energies for boosting the nodes 
are allowe d. Photon energies > [ADDRESS_1207295] be ≥ 80 cm SSD (or SAD for isocentric techniques).  
 
5.3.2 Localization Requirements  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Simulation  
 
Simulation of all fields is mandatory. Patients must be reproducibly  
CTRC# [ADDRESS_1207296] is recommended and the 
data should be acquired using 3 mm slice width and spacing using the spi[INVESTIGATOR_865476].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Verification  
 
Checking the films should be done weekly. Beam portal films must be obtained to 
each fie ld. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Electron fields utilized for supplemental nodal boosting must be verified 
by [CONTACT_865524], simulation, or  diagram.  
 
5.3.3 Radiation Dose  
 
Treatment to the primary tumor and upper neck will be given at 2 Gy/fraction once each 
day, five days a week. A total dose of 70 Gy/35 fractions/[ADDRESS_1207297] 46 - 50 Gy (even in N0 
stage) at anatomic levels of lymph nodes usually 2 -4 cm beneath the skin surface.  
Clinically positive neck nodes should also receive a dose of 70 Gy/[ADDRESS_1207298] has been shielded. Hence, the total 
dose to the primary tumor and clinically positive nodes will b e 70 Gy. The anterior lower 
neck will be treated at 2 Gy/fraction once a day (3 cm depth or at depth determined by 3D 
imaging) from the anterior to a total dose of 46 -50 Gy/25 continuous fractions (if clinically 
negative) in [ADDRESS_1207299] will not exceed 45 
Gy as determined by a separate off -axis point dose calculation.  
 
5.3.4 Target Volume Irradiation and Radiation  Doses  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  A combination of lateral opposing fields are recommended for the 
treatment of the primary tumor site and upper neck. A single anterior AP 
field will be used to treat the lower neck below the fields of the primary 
tumor/upper neck. When there is clinically involved lymph nodes in the 
lower neck, an additional posterior (PA) field may be necessary to delive r 
a supplemental dose to the positive nodes. All fields must be treated at 
each treatment session. The upper and lower fields should be matched 
using a “three dimensional” technique (i.e., appropriate rotation of the 
treatment table and appropriate angulat ion of the collimator or beam split 
technique). However, if such a three -dimensional match is not possible, 
the upper neck and supraclavicular fields may be abutted at the skin. The 
latter case, a small block should be placed either in the lower lateral 
position in the upper neck fields, or in the midline of the  anterior

supraclavicular field (whichever is appropriate and does not block tumor) 
to the shield areas of potential overlap of diverging beams over the spi[INVESTIGATOR_36232].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Upper Neck Primary  Volume  
 
The primary treatment fields should encompass the primary tumor and/or 
suspected lymph node disease in the upper neck using the shrinking field 
technique as follows:  
 
The initial target volume should include the primary tumor, positive nodes 
with an approx imately 3.[ADDRESS_1207300] and final field reduction will occur at 60  Gy and continue to 70 
Gy with the new target volume encompassing the primary tumor and 
known areas of nodal disease with at approximately 1.0 cm margin.  
 
As a general rule, both ipsilateral and contralateral posterior cervical 
nodal chain and the adjacent  echelon of uninvolved lymphatic nodal 
drainage sites will be treated to a dose of 46 -50 Gy/5 weeks.  
 
5.3.5 Lower Neck  Volume  
 
A single lower neck field will be used to treat the lower neck and the supraclavicular 
fossae. When there is (are) positive node(s) in the lower neck, an additional posterior field 
may be necessary to deliver a supplemental dose to the positive node(s). Th e boost dose 
should not exceed [ADDRESS_1207301] below the clavicular head with 
appropriate margins when there are positive nodes in the supraclavicular fossa. The 
lateral borders of the lower neck field will exte nd to the intersection of the 
sternocleidomastoid muscle and the clavicle.  
 
For all patients with clinically positive nodes greater than 6 cm, or with clinically positive 
supraclavicular nodes, a mediastinal “T” field may be used. The lateral limbs of the T field 
will extend below the clavicular heads with margin, and the central portion of the field 
extends [ADDRESS_1207302] Doses  
CTRC# [ADDRESS_1207303] doses may be given through reduced field to persis tent tumor and/or 
clinically positive nodes, or to compensate for significant interruptions in radiation therapy 
treatments (i.e., > 57 elapsed days). The additional boost dose should not exceed 4 Gy 
(i.e., 70 Gy maximum). The spi[INVESTIGATOR_865477].  
 
5.3.7 Dose Calculations  
 
Photon Beam Portal Arrangements  
 
Dose specification for two parallel -opposed coaxial equally -weighted beams is to be on 
the central ray at mid -separation of the beams.  
 
Dose specification for two or more intersecting beams is at the intersection of the central 
ray of the beams.  
 
For other  complex treatment arrangements, dose is specified at the center of the clinical 
target volume.  
 
Note: There may be several target volumes.  
 
For a single anterior AP lower neck field, the prescribed does will be delivered at a depth 
of 3.0 cm as determined  by [CONTACT_106623] -axis “supraclavicular point”. A deeper prescription point 
may be required if distance to the supraclavicular fossa is greater or with clinically involved 
nodes. When AP -PA fields are used to treat the lower neck, the dose shall be prescribed 
at the mid -separation of the two beams along the central  ray. 
 
5.3.8 Isodose Distributions  
 
Isodose distribution at central axis is required. All treatment volumes and critical structures 
should be indicated. Complete isodose curves are required. Attempts should be  made to 
keep the dose variation within the planning target volume to be within +/ - 5% of the target 
dose.  
 
5.3.9 Electron Beam Dose Specifications  
 
The target dose shall be prescribed at the depth of maximum dose. The energy and field 
size shall be chosen so th at the target volume is encompassed within 90% of the 
prescribed dose.  
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_1207304] when they occur. If the total treatment interruptions 
exceed ten treatment days, the treatment will be considered a protocol deviation. The  
interruption of radiation therapy for grade 4 mucositis/dermatitis/dysphagia is at the 
discretion of the treating oncologist.  
CTRC# [ADDRESS_1207305] dose is 45 Gy.  
 
Mandibular osteoradionecrosis will rarely occur if pretreatment dental evaluation is 
conducted prior to radiation therapy treatment. Pretherapy extractions of badly diseased 
teeth should be carried out with conservation of restorable teeth when possible. I f an 
extraction site in the mandible has to be included in the irradiated field, 10 to 14 days 
should be allowed for healing before the initiation of irradiation.  
 
Radiotherapy Guidelines/IMRT  
 
5.3.11  Intensity Modulated Radiation (IMRT) is allowed in the  study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Following are the proposed radiotherapy  guidelines:  
 
All patients will have immobilization devices with treatment planning based on 
Computerized Tomography (CT) information in treatment position. The CT slice 
thickness through target will be [ADDRESS_1207306]/MRI data when necessary.  
 
The field sizes and arrangements will be at the discretion of the attending Radiation 
Oncologist. ICRU 50 guid elines will be used for various Tumor and Target 
Nomenclature.  
 
The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV): All gross disease determined from clinical 
examination and radiographic studies (CT/PET/MRI).  
 
The Clinical Target Volume (CTV): The area that potentially contain s microscopic 
disease. Lymph node groups at risk of microscopic disease will be outlined as part of 
corresponding CTV. The margin between each GTV and corresponding CTV can vary 
from 0.2 cm to 2.5 cm depending upon the proximity to the critical and uninvol ved 
structures.  
 
The Planning Target Volume (PTV): Provides a margin around CTV to compensate for 
internal motion and set up errors. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a 5 mm margin may be used around CTV.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Radiation Target and Dose  Specifications  
 
The following is the definition of targets and their dose specifications.  
 
Primary Target (PTV3): Includes PTV’s of primary tumor and the lymph nodes containing 
disease. The dose will be 70 Gy at 2 GY/ fractions.  
 
Secondary Target (PTV2): Includes PTV’s of area at moderate to high risk of microscopic 
disease i.e. first echelon no des. The dose will be 60 Gy.  
CTRC# 11 -47 
Version  date January  13, 2015  20 of 53 Confidential   
  
 
 
Tertiary Target (PTV1): Includes PTV’s of areas that are at low risk of microscopic disease  
i.e. second echelon lymph nodes. The dose will be approximately 46 -50 Gy.  
 
Low Neck  
The midjugular, low jugular, and s upraclavicular nodes can be treated with IMRT or 
alternatively with an AP field that is beam split to the IMRT fields. Dose Volume 
Histograms (DVH) will be generated for each plan. Radiation doses will be as outlined 
above.  
 
 
Treatment Planning  
Either forw ard or inverse planning can be used in order to achieve the following:  
 
The radiation dose will be prescribed to the isodose line that encompass 95% of PTV. 
No more than 15% of the PTV will receive >110% of the prescribed dose.  
The maximum dose within PTV does not exceed >25% of the prescribed dose.  
 
No more than 1% of the tis sue outside PTV will receive >110% of the prescribed dose. 
No more than 1% of any PTV will receive < 93% of the prescribed dose.  
Tissue heterogeneity correction is mandatory.  
 
The planning priorities include critical normal structure constraints followed b y prescription 
goals.  
 
Normal Tissues: The appropriate normal organs will be contoured. Dose Volume 
Histograms (DVH) will be generated. An attempt will be made to keep the maximum 
radiation doses to the following organs as follows:  
 
Brain Stems:  54Gy  
Optic  Nerve/Chiasm:  [ADDRESS_1207307]:  45 Gy 
Mandible/TM  Joint:  70 Gy or 1 cc of the PTV not to exceed 75 Gy 
Larynx  70 Gy 
 
Parotid Glands: Attempt will be to achieve mean dose ≤ [ADDRESS_1207308] 20cc of the combined volume of both parotid glands will receive < [ADDRESS_1207309] 
50% of the gland will receive < 30 Gy (should be achieved in at least one gla nd). 
 
Other Normal Structures: Submandibular/sublingual glands, inner and middle ears, eye, 
lens will be considered low priority. The aim should be to decrease the doses as much as 
possible without compromising target.  
CTRC# 11 -47 
Version  date January  13, 2015  21 of 53 Confidential   
  
 
5.3.12  Amifostine is not per mitted.  
 
5.3.13  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (Salagen) is allowed as per physician discretion. If used, all details 
must be recorded on the data  forms.  
 
5.4 Salvage Surgery  
Salvage surgery may be performed after radiation, if there is local and/or regional 
progression of disease.  
 
Elective (planned) neck dissection or other surgery required for residual but not 
progressive disease will NOT be considered treatment failure.  
Surgical removal (salvage) of the primary tumor: Directed biopsies at the site of the index 
lesions should not be performed in the absence of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_306796]. Criteria for biopsy 
after radiation includes a persistent mucosal abnormality or imaging st udies that are 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_865478].  
 
Surgical removal (salvage resection) of the primary tumor should be performed if biopsy - 
proven cancer remains more than two months after completion of chemoradiotherapy.  
This will be consider ed progression of disease for the evaluation of the primary endpoint. 
The nature of the surgical resection should be dictated by [CONTACT_865525]. The operation should be conducted using accepted criteria for primary surgical 
treatment of the cancer.  
 
Neck dissection: A neck dissection is recommended if a palpable or worrisome 
radiographic abnormality persists in the neck 8 weeks after completion of therapy.  
 
Cervical lymphadenectomy should encompass the original levels of lymph  node 
involvement. Preservation of the accessory nerve, jugular vein, and sternomastoid muscle 
is encouraged if consistent with complete removal of all residual nodal disease; however, 
the extent of the neck dissection will be at the discretion of the surg eon. 
 
5.5 Supportive Care  
 
All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will be given throughout the 
study.  
 
Concomitant Drugs  
 
The use of G -CSF, erythropoietin or amifostine is not allowed during radiotherapy. No 
other antitumor agents will be  given during protocol therapy.  
 
Prophylactic placement of a gastrostomy tube before treatment begins is at the discretion 
of the treating physician. Gastrostomy tube placement is strongly recommended in 
patients with significant dysphagia and weight loss at baseline.  
 
Aggressive oral and  skin care and analgesics are recommended.  
CTRC# 11 -47 
Version  date January  13, 2015  22 of 53 Confidential   
  
 
The use of amifostine is not permitted. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (Salagen) is not encouraged during 
treatment but is allowed. If used, it should be recorded in the treatment forms.  
 
6. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
This study w ill utilize the NCI CTCAE version 4.0 for toxicity and Adverse Event (AE) reporting 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm). All appropriate treatment 
areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  
 
Infusion reactions should be graded according to allergic reaction/hypersensitivity. Caution must be 
exercised with every cetuximab infusion, as there were patients who experienced their first severe infusion 
reaction during later infusions.  
 
6.1 Adverse Dru g Reactions Due to Gene  Therapy  
 
Note: A patient has died while being treated on a gene therapy protocol. That protocol used very 
high amounts of virus directly injected into the liver and treated a very different disease with a 
different gene than the one used in this study. This gene th erapy protocol does not use a virus. 
The underlying disease that this patient had also made him more susceptible to complications of 
the gene therapy.  
 
Risk of Cancer  
 
When retroviral vectors enter a normal cell in the body, the DNA of the vector inserts i tself 
into the normal DNA in that cell; this process is called integration. Most integration is 
expected to cause no harm to the cell or to the subject. However, there is a chance that 
there may be some regions of the normal human DNA where integration of the viral 
vector’s DNA may result in activation of neighboring genes. For example, if one of these 
genes were a growth factor, this may cause uncontrolled division of the cell, resulting in a 
cancer. This type of event has occurred in one animal study in m ice where the vector 
integration site correlates with the occurrence of cancer in these mice.  
 
More recently, the first reports of a similar event have been identified in two children who 
received a retroviral vector in an experimental gene transfer clinic al trial for X -linked 
Severe Immunodeficiency (X -SCID) conducted in [LOCATION_009], not under the jurisdiction of the 
[LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA). While most of the children who 
participated in this clinical trial appear to have been cured of their disease, these two 
children developed leukemia (a form of cancer of the blood) approximately [ADDRESS_1207310] results and concluded that the gene transfer caused the 
leukemia. These children appear to be responding to the treatment of his/her leukemia, 
but his/her long -term prognosis in unknown at this time.  
 
The risk of another cancer, including leukemia, developi[INVESTIGATOR_865479], is unknown; however, in contrast to the French study this protocol does not use 
a virus.

Soreness and/or bleeding at the injection site . 
 
Local inflammation (redness or swelling and/or discomfort) at the injection site.  
 
Fever, reactions at the injection site of the gene transfer, which could develop into local 
ulcers or sores that could get infected.  
 
Note : Administration of cancer gene transfer has been used before, although this specific 
EGFR antisense study drug has no t been previously given to cancer subjects. It is not 
known what impact this gene transfer will have on future conventional chemo/radiation 
treatments or future reproductive capabilities.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1207311]’s criteria for 
reporting can be found website at ( http://research.uthscsa.edu/irb/ ). 
 
6.2.1 Serious AE (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:  
• Results in death . 
• Is life-threatening . (The term "life-threatening"  in the definition  of "serious"  refers  to an event 
in which  the patient  was at risk of death  at the time of the event;  it does  not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more  severe).  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865480] (see 
clarification in the paragraph below on planned  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]).  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life  functions.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
 
Is a medically important event that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865481],  or involves  suspected  transmission  via a medicinal  product  of 
an infectious agent. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development  of drug dependency  or drug abuse;  any organism, 
virus,  or infectious  particle  (e.g.,  prion  protein  transmitting  Transmissible  Spongiform  Encephalopathy), 
pathogenic or non pathogenic, is considered an infectious  agent.  
 
6.2.2 NIH guidelines for reporting serious adverse events for trials involving gene transfer 
agents or recombinant DNA molecules are found at  http://www4.od.nih.gov/oba/rdna.htm .

molecules to the IRB according to the ir requirements.  
6.2.4 FDA Guidelines for Adverse Event Reporting  
 
All adverse events meeting the definition of serious, unexpected and associated to the 
research intervention will be reported to the IRB according to their guidelines found on the 
IRB’s website and the IND file according to the following guidelines and FDA  definition of 
events:  
 
Associated with the use of the drug : There is a reasonable possibility that the experience 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].  
 
Disability : A substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions.  
 
Lifethreatening adverse drug experience:  Any adverse drug experience that places the 
patient or subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the 
reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction that, had it occurre d in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
 
Serious adverse drug experience : Any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that 
results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or 
significant disability/ incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical 
events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865483] d a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this  definition.  
 
Unexpected adverse dru g experience:  Any adverse drug experience, the specificity or 
severity of which is not consistent with the current investigator brochure; or, if an 
investigator brochure is not required or available, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent w ith the risk information described in the general investigational plan or 
elsewhere in the current application, as amended. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, 
refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously observed (e.g.,  
include d in the investigator brochure) rather than from the perspective of such experience 
not being anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical  product.  
 
6.2.5 IND Safety  Reports  
 
The sponsor shall notify FDA and all participating investigators in a written IND safety 
report of:  
 
Any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and 
unexpected.  
 
Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests  a significant risk for human 
subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
CTRC# 11 -47 
Version  date January  13, 2015  25 of 53 Confidential   
  
 
Each notification shall be made as soon as possible and in no event later than 15 calendar 
days after the investigators initial re ceipt of the information.  
Telephone and facsimile transmission of safety reports. The sponsor/investigator shall also 
notify FDA by [CONTACT_865526] 7 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information.  
 
6.3 Data Safety and Monitoring Plan  (DSMP)  
 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Plan is required for all an individual protocols conducted at 
CTRC. All protocols conducted at CTRC are covered under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_865484].  
 
The CTRC Institutional DSMP global polic ies provide individual trials with:  
• Institutional policies and procedures for institutional data safety and  monitoring,  
• An institutional guide to  follow,  
• Monitoring of protocol accrual by [CONTACT_865527],  
• Review of study forms and orders  by [CONTACT_865528],  
• Tools for monitoring safety  events,  
• Independent monitoring and source data verification by [CONTACT_865529]/auditor,  
• Monitoring of UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]’s by [CONTACT_865530],  
• Determining level of risk (priority of au dit level score – pals),  
• Oversight by [CONTACT_497129] (DSMC),  and 
• Verification of protocol adherence via annual audit for all investigator initiated studies 
by [CONTACT_865531].  
 
Monitoring Progress and Safety  
Due to the risks associated with participation in this protocol, the CTRC DSMB #[ADDRESS_1207312] ion with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_865485], 
adverse event trends and treatment effects on this study. The CTRC DSMB #2 acts as an 
independent DSMB for IIS conducted at CTRC. The CTRC DSMB #2 will monitor data 
throughout t he duration of a study to determine if continuation of the study is appropriate 
scientifically and ethically. An additional layer of review is provided by [CONTACT_865532] (DSMC) who will review DSMB quarterly reports.  
 
Baseline events and adverse events will be captured using the CTRC Master Adverse 
Events Document for each patient using CTCAE V. 4.0 for the grading and attribution of 
adverse events. Usage of the CTRC Master Adverse Events Document centrally 
documents:  
• The event and grades the seriousness of the  event,  
• If the event was a change from  baseline,  
• The determination of the relationship between the event and study  intervention,  
• If the event was part of the normal disease process,  and 
• What actions were taken as a  result of the  event.  
 
Safety Definitions:

Version  date January  13, 2015  26 of 53 Confidential   
  
 
For this study, the following safety definitions will be applicable:  
 
Adverse Event Definition: An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward or 
unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject , including any abnormal sign (for 
example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally 
associated with the subject’s participation in the research , whether or not considered 
related to the subject’s participation in the research for this study, all adverse events will 
be documented starting with specify here when you want to start collecting adverse event

2. Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred);  
3. Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909];  
4. Results in a persistent or significant  disability/incapacity;  
5. Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  or

procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved 
research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteri stics of the subject 
population being studied (note: the unfounded classification of a serious adverse event as 
“anticipated” constitutes serious  non-compliance);

C. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or  recognized  
 
Reporting Requirements  
For this study, the Master Adverse Events Documents  collected on patients for this 
protocol will be reviewed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a quarterly basis to determine if a 
serious safety problem has emerged that result in a change or early termination of a 
protocol such as:

7. MANAGEMENT OF CETUXIMAB ADVERSE REACTIONS AND DOSE  MODIFICATIONS  
 
All toxicities will be graded according to NCI Common Toxicity Criteria AE version 4.0 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). 
 
7.1 Cetuximab Dose  Modifications  
 
Cetuximab  will be held or its dose  reduced  to dose  level -1 or -2 (see below)  for the following  toxicities 
(see sections 7.4 and  7.5). 
 
Cetuximab wi ll NOT be held or reduced for hematologic toxicities. 
Dose levels for cetuximab are as follows:  
Table 3: Cetuximab Dose Levels  
 
   Weekly Cetuximab  dose   
Starting dose  250 mg/m2 
Dose Level -1 200 mg/m2 
Dose Level -2 150 mg/m2 
 
There will be no dose level reductions below a weekly dose of 150 mg/m2. 
 
7.2 Management of Infusion Reactions  
 
Severe infusion reactions require the immediate interruption of cetuximab therapy and permanent 
discontinuation from further treatment. Appropriate medical therapy including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators, and oxygen should be available for 
use in the treatment of such reactions. Patients should be carefully observed until the complete 
resolution of all signs  and symptoms.  
 
In clinical trials, mild to moderate infusion reactions were managed by [CONTACT_865536] -medications (e.g., diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride [Benadryl]) in subsequent doses. If th e patient experiences a mild or moderate 
(Grade 1 or 2) infusion reaction, the infusion rate should be permanently reduced by 50%. For  
CTRC# 11 -47 
Version  date January  13, 2015  31 of 53 Confidential   
  
 
grade 1 or 2 reactions manifesting only as delayed drug fever, see below.  
 
Cetuximab should be immediately and permanently discontinued in patients who experience 
severe (Grade 3 or 4) infusion reactions.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1207318] use clinical judgment to determine if the fever 
is related to the study drug or to an infectious etiology.  
 
If a patient experiences isolated drug fever, for the next dose, pre -treat with acetaminophen or 
non-steroida l anti -inflammatory agent (investigator discretion), repeat antipyretic dose [ADDRESS_1207319] -dosing with 
an appropriate antipyretic, the infusion rate for subsequent dosing should be 50% of previous rate. 
If fever recurs following infusion rate change, the investigator should assess the patient’s level of 
discomfort with the event and use  clinical judgment to determine if the patient should receive 
further cetuximab.  
 
7.4 Management of Pulmonary  Toxicity  
 
In the event of acute onset (grade > 2) or worsening pulmonary symptoms which are not thought 
to be related to underlying cancer, cetuximab therapy should be interrupted and a prompt 
investigation of these symptoms should occur. If ILD is confirmed, cetuximab should be 
discontinued and the p atient should be treated appropriately.  
 
7.5 Management of Dermatologic  Toxicity  
 
Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_775896], and appropriate treatment of these symptoms 
initiated. Dose modifications of any future cetuximab infusion s should be instituted in case of 
severe (grade 3) acneiform rash. Treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_199]/or oral antibiotics should be 
considered; topi[INVESTIGATOR_604405].  
 
If a patient experiences severe acneiform rash, cetuximab treatment adjust ments should be made 
according to the following table. In patients with mild and moderate skin toxicity, treatment should 
continue without dose modification.

7.6 In-Field Toxicities During Radiation: Radiation Mucositis/Dysphagia/Dermatitis  
 
No cetuximab dose adjustments for grade 3 or less radiation mucositis, dysphagia, dermatitis.  
 
Grade 4 radiation mucositis/dysphagia or der matitis that develops at any time will require 
permanent dose reduction of cetuximab by [CONTACT_744606]. If radiation is 
given in the setting of grade 4 radiation mucositis/dysphagia/dermatitis, cetuximab will be 
administered with a  dose reduction by [CONTACT_30560].  
 
Delays in radiation as strongly discourages. Short delays may be required for the management of 
grade 3 /4 toxicities. If RT is held because of in -field toxicities, hold cetuximab until RT is resumed.  
 
EGFR AS will be he ld for grade 3 or 4 in -field toxicities (see section 5.2.3).  
 
 
 
7.7 Retreatment Criteria for  Cetuximab  
 
Cetuximab may only be administered if all the following criteria are met regardless of cycle, 
providing no criteria for discontinuation are met:  
 
• Acne -like rash is grade 2 or  less 
• All other grade 3 or 4 non -hematologic out -of-field toxicities (except fatig ue, electrolyte 
abnormalities, anorexia, pain) have improved to grade 2 or less.  
• For in -field toxicities see section  7.6

8. MEASUREMENT OF  RESPONSE  
 
Response will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_190793] (RE CIST v1.1) Committee.[ADDRESS_1207320] and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the best currently available and most 
reproducible methods for measuring target lesions. Conventional CT and MRI should be 
performed with contiguous cuts of [ADDRESS_1207321] disappeared.  
 
Clinical Examination  
CTRC# 11 -47 
Version  date January  13, 2015  34 of 53 Confidential   
  
 
FOR THIS STUDY evaluation of measurable disease in the primary site by [CONTACT_865537].  
 
Cytology and  Histology  
 
Cytologic and histologic techniques can be used to differentiate between complete and 
partial response in rare cases (e.g., after treatment to differentiate residual benign lesions 
and residual malignant lesions in germ cell tumors). Cytologic confirmation  of the 
neoplastic nature of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment is required 
when the measurable tumor has met response or stable disease criteria.  
 
The pathologic response after biopsy or neck dissection post chemoradiotherapy will be 
recorded.

10. DRUG FORMULATION AND  PROCUREMENT  
 
10.1 EGFR  Antisense  
 
EGFR antisense DNA is plasmid DNA and will be prepared under conditions consistent with cGMP 
as described in CFR 210 and 211. Production will occur in the Center for Biomedicine and 
Genetics, the National Gene Vector Laboratory (NGVL) designated site at th e Beckman Research 
Institute of the City of Hope in Duarte, [LOCATION_004], under the direction of [CONTACT_865564] A. Couture.  
Manufacturing and quality release testing will be performed as described in BB -MF 9778 (see 
cross reference authorization letter provided a s an attachment).  
 
Drug Information 
Production of Plasmid DNA  
Plasmid DNA was produced under GMP conditions at the Center for Biomedicine and 
Genetics (CBG) at the City of Hope according to City of Hope’s Master File BB -MF-9778. 
Briefly, a bacterial Master  Cell bank was produced in the STBLII competent cell line. Bacteria 
from the tested and released Master Cell Bank was used to inoculate “starter” and expansion 
cultures to seed 6 liter batches in a New Brunswick BioFlo3000 fermentor using proprietary 
bacte rial media optimized for plasmid DNA production. The 6 liter culture was grown at 35°C 
for 20 
4 hours with automated (PID loop) temperature, aeration and pH adjustment. 
Following fermentation the culture was harvested and bacterial pellets stored at -20°C for  
further processing.  
 
Bacteria were processed using a modified alkaline lysis method (Birnboim, H.C. and Doly, 
J.(1979) Nucl. Acids. Res. 7,1513 -1522). Briefly, bacte rial pellets are resuspended in 50mM 
Tris-Cl, 10mM EDTA and then lysed with an equal volume of 200mM NaOH, 1% SDS at room 
temperature. The lysate is neutralized with 3.0M potassium acetate and clarified by 
[CONTACT_865539], lip id and bacterial genomic DNA. The clarified 
lysate  is passed  through  a series of filters (50
 0.2
) and then concent rated 10-fold to 15-fold 
over a 30,000 NMWCO PES ultrafiltration device (Millipore ProFlux M12/Pellicon system). At 
this stage the concentra ted lysate was held for 24 hours at 4°C.  
 
Concentrated lysate was further clarified using depth filtration in the presence of filter aid and 
RNA removal was achieved by [CONTACT_865540] [ADDRESS_1207330] Flow
  
(GE Healthcare). Plasmid DNA devoid of RNA contaminants was treated with an endotoxin 
adsorbent to remove trace endotoxin contamination. The plasmid DNA was concentrated and 
reformulated into PBS using tangential flow filtration. Samples of the bulk material were taken 
for release  testing with the balance  of the material stored at -20
C. The bulk material that met 
the defined specifications for protein, endotoxin, RNA and contaminating bacterial genomic  
CTRC# [ADDRESS_1207331] I (BSL -1) since it 
does not co ntain viral elements, toxic proteins or oncogenes and will be shipped and handled 
as a research reagent as per biohazard material guidelines. The product will be supplied 
vialed and formulated in 1-2 mg/mL concent rations, stored at -[ADDRESS_1207332]. Any/all unused product will be returned to the NGVL. EGFR antisense DNA will be 
sent from the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_865497]'s Investi gational Drug Section 
(IDS). It will be shipped on dry ice for overnight delivery (Monday -Thursday). Upon arrival at 
IDS, drug will be inspected to ensure its intact/undamaged during  shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].

hydrochloride [Benadryl] will be used as described in Sections 5.[ADDRESS_1207335] of cetuximab. It can be managed with loperamide 
(Imodium).  
 
11. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1207336] stage, toxicity will be the primary endpoint. In the second 
stage (phase II component), the primary endpoint will be the locoregional progression free survival 
(PFS) at 1 year. Toxicities will also be evaluate d during the second stage using continuous 
Bayesian monitoring as described below.  
 
Sample size for the primary objective: 11 evaluable patients (stage 1); 31 evaluable patients 
(stage 2)  
 
First stage: [ADDRESS_1207337] stage 
(safety component), 11 patients will be treated and observed for serious adverse events (SAEs) 
that are due to EGFR AS (possibly, probably, or definitely), not cetuximab or radiation. In the first 
stage, after three (3) subjects are enrolled and have received all EGFR AS injections, there will be 
a two -week waiting period to assess adverse events. After the two -week period, additional 
subjects may be enrolled. Eligible patients will include stage IV or recurrent patients who would 
not be eligible for the subsequent study of efficacy, and their accrual to study is only for the 
assessment of safety. We seek to rule out an SAE rate of 20% or greater due to EGFR AS. If no 
grade 3/4 toxicities due to EGFR AS are observed among 11 patients, then an upper 90% 
confidence bound for the SAE rate is less than  20%.  
 
Second stage (phase II component): 31 evaluable patients. The efficacy -evaluable population 
consists of all patients who complete the treatment regimen.  
 
Sample size for th e second stage of study is based on the primary endpoint: 1 -year locoregional 
PFS. We use a historical control rate of 63% for [ADDRESS_1207338] a true improvement with the addition of EGFR AS, 
we use the reasoning of Fazzari et al.45 which advocates setting the null hypothesis to the upper 
bound of the 75 percent confidence int erval for the historical -control endpoint. By [CONTACT_105453] 1 - 
year locoregional PFS as reported by [CONTACT_865542] a

sample of 211 patients, the upper 75th percent confidence bound for 1 -year locoregio nal PFS is 
68%. Targeting a 50% reduction in the hazard rate for 1 -year locoregional PFS under our 
treatment regimen implies that 1 -year locoregional PFS would be improved to 83%. To achieve 
this objective, we plan a study with [ADDRESS_1207339] at α = 0.10 will provide 90% power with [ADDRESS_1207340] stage, which will assess the safety of the combination. 
Patients failing to complete treatment for reasons other than toxicity will be replaced.  
 
In the second stage,  31 efficacy -evaluable patients will be enrolled, provided safety is acceptable.  
 
11.2 Secondary Clinical  Endpoints  
 
Clinical secondary endpoints in phase II include adverse events, in -field and out -field, objective 
response rate, distant PFS, overall PFS, and overall survival.  
 
11.3 Accrual  
 
The study will be conducted at the CTRC at UTHSCSA. We anticipate that 42 evaluable patients 
([ADDRESS_1207341] stage and 31 in the second stage) will be accrued over two years, and that the 
monthly accrual rate will be approximately [ADDRESS_1207342] been characterized by a randomized 
study by [CONTACT_262504] 18 in which 208 patients treated with RT and cetuximab were evaluated for 
toxicity . Grade 3/4 radiation mucositis and radiation dermatitis were common toxicities occurring 
with high frequencies. The proportion of grade 3/4 events in the RT+cetuximab arm were 56% for 
mucositis and 23% for radiation dermatitis. While the intratumoral inje ction of EGFR AS is not 
expected to increase the rate of SAEs, we will nonetheless monitor patients for unexpected 
increases in mucositis and radiation dermatitis that may be attributable (possibly, probably, 
definitely) to the addition of EGFR AS, and wil l suspend the trial if there is evidence that the 
occurrences of these toxicities are greater than what would be expected from radiation and 
cetuximab without EGFR AS.  
 
We use informative prior distributions of SAEs to conform in part to the reported SAE f requencies 
in Bonner – probabilities of grade 3/4 mucositis of 56% and grade 3/4 radiation dermatitis of 23%. 
Our assumed prior probabilities are not as concentrated as the nominal uncertainty in the  
CTRC# 11 -47 
Version  date January  13, 2015  43 of 53 Confidential   
  
 
estimates from the Bonner study of 208 patients, but instead allow for greater variability, which can 
arise from different treatment populations. Specifically, we specify a 90% credibility interval for the 
probab ility of mucos itis as 56%
15%, and 23%
10% for the probab ility of radiation dermatitis; these 
are wider intervals than suggested by [CONTACT_865543].  
 
Assuming that the prior probability of an SAE follows a beta distribution, the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_865498]. As each patient is observed for SAEs, the posterior 
probability, which follows a beta distribution, of SAE can be calculated. If at any time during the  
trial the posterior probability is ≥ 0.80 that the rate of treatment -related grade 3/4 mucositis 
exceeds 56%, the study will be suspended pending review by [CONTACT_865544] (DMSC). Similarly, if the posterior probability is greater than 0.80 that the rate of 
treatment -related grade 3/4 radiation dermatitis e xceeds 23%, the study will be suspended for 
review by [CONTACT_6802]. To permit continuous monitoring of SAEs, a table (see below) based on the 
cumulative number of patients experiencing SAEs at any point during the trial can be used to  
signal when the study sh ould be suspended and reviewed by [CONTACT_512793].

The table above presents the minimum number of patients experiencing treatment -related SAEs 
(i.e., those SAEs judged to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study regimen) that 
would dictate suspension of the trial in accordance with the sto ppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]. For example, after the 
first [ADDRESS_1207344] completed treatment and been observed for toxicity, 9 patients experiencing 
treatment -related grade 3/4 mucositis, or 6 patients experiencing treatment -related grade 3/4 
radiation dermatitis, would trigger trial suspension pending review by [CONTACT_6802].  
 
11.5 Hypothesis Testing and Operating Characteristics for Correlative -Study  Endpoints  
 
Correlative studies will assess antitumor activity measured by [CONTACT_865545]. This 
will involve measurement of the following biomarkers from tumor tissue using RPPA: EGFR, 
pEGFR, Src, pMAPK, STAT3, pSTAT3, pSTAT5, pSTAT1, pAKT, p38, p21, p 27, PARP, E - 
cadherin, p -ErbB3, and Ki67. In some instances immunohistochemical staining of selected 
proteins will be performed to verify or validate RPPA results. Biomarkers will be tested for 
treatment -associated modulation (i,e., change from baseline) a s well as for association with 1 -year 
locoregional PFS (primary endpoint), and other efficacy parameters, such as objective response 
rate, PFS, and overall survival. These analyses will be exploratory in  nature.  
 
To estimate the power of our study to asses s whether significant modulation of biomarkers occurs 
from therapy, we assume that 80% of patients in phase II will have a 2nd biopsy after [ADDRESS_1207345] deviation was 0.7 on average for 
paired differences (log 2[post/baseline]) in proteins measured pre and post therapy. Assuming this 
standard deviation will apply, a two -tailed signed rank test at α = 0.01 ( to control the false -positive 
rate) in 24 patients will provide 80% power to detect a change of 0.55 (log 2 scale), which  
corresponds  to a change  of 
46% from the base line-expression level. Although  the search for 
individual biomarkers that change with trea tment is exploratory and hypothesis generating, we will 
report all nominal p -values along with those that remain significant using a 10% false discovery 
rate. 
 
It is also of interest to assess whether biomarker modulation within the treatment window is 
associated with PFS. To estimate power for these analyses, we use Cox proportional hazards 
regression to evaluate whether PFS depends on change in biomarker expres sion, considered for 
each biomarker individually. We assume that 25% of treated patients will have loco -regional 
progression within 1 year, i.e., PFS = 0.75, based on expectation averaged over the null and 
alternative hypotheses. We also assume that among [ADDRESS_1207346] of trend at α = .[ADDRESS_1207347] 80% power to dete ct a hazard 
ratio of 3.8, which corresponds to a one -unit change (i.e., 2 -fold increase or decrease) in the 
biomarker tested.  
 
With respect to assessing PFS in relation to baseline measurements of biomarkers, we assume 
that all [ADDRESS_1207348] loco -regional progression within the study time frame. For this  
CTRC# [ADDRESS_1207349] ratio would be 3.2 under the conservative assumption 
that variability in biomarker expression among patients is no greater than that within patients 
(greater variability would provide increased opportunity to detect  biomarker effects).  
 
The analyses of the correlative data are exploratory. A less restrictive test ( α = .05) is used for 
PFS to avoid missing important leads. Nominal p -values for all biomarkers associated positively or 
negatively with PFS will be reporte d along with a designation of those that fall within a 10% false 
discovery  rate. 
 
11.6 Additional  Analyses  
 
The data from all evaluable patients will be used in the analyses of safety (phase I and 
phase II), tumor response (phase II), and survival (phase II).  
 
Baseline Characteristics  
 
Baseline descriptive statistics on all evaluable patients will be provided on 
demographic variables (age, sex, and race/ethnicity), performance status, 
laboratory parameters, treatment regimens that were previously used, and disease 
characteristics, includ ing tumor size, number of nodes involved, and metastatic 
sites.  
 
Safety Profile  
Using NCI CTCAE (v4.0), the number of patients experiencing AEs over their 
course of treatment, and for [ADDRESS_1207350] day of therapy. Attribution of AEs to treatment 
(unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite) will be recorded, and the details 
of all treatment -related toxicities w ill be reported.  
 
Survival  
PFS will be measured from the initial date of treatment to the date of documented 
progression, or the date of death (in the absence of progression).  
 
Overall survival will be measured from the initial date of treatment to the rec orded 
date of death or for a total of 5 years follow up (See Section 12.3).  
 
PFS and overall survival will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method. The 
corresponding median survival times (with 90% confidence limits) will be 
determined, as will the cumulat ive percentage of patients remaining progression - 
free at selected time points after initial treatment.  
 
Tumor Response  
Response rates will be estimated by [CONTACT_417949] a best  
response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), o r stable disease (SD) 
by [CONTACT_13407], with corresponding exact 90% confidence limits being  
reported. The distribution of response duration (time to progression among  patients

achieving CR, PR, or SD) will be characterized by [CONTACT_865546], with the 
corresponding Kaplan -Meier estimate being made of PFS among patients 
responding to treatment.

13. CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
13.1 Reverse Phase Protein Microarrays  (RPPA)  
 
The last decade has witnessed a relative explosion in the development and availability of 
therapeutic reagents that block specific signaling pathways. While gene microarrays and 
transcriptional profiling can provide information regarding coordinate gene ex pression and 
transcriptional control mechanisms, they cannot capture fluctuating signaling events that occur at 
the protein and particular the post translational level. In addition, mRNA levels do not necessarily 
correlate with protein abundance. To fully realize the potential of molecular targeted therapy, it is 
critical to apply tools that can profile the cancer cell proteome in terms of both total levels and 
functional modifications. Only recently has technology been developed to measure the activation 
state of kinase driven signal transduction networks. Using antibodies that specifically recognize the 
phosphorylated and total isoforms of kinase substrates, reverse phase protein microarrays (RPPA) 
can multiplex and quantify a large array of activated prot eins.[ADDRESS_1207354] curves of peptide and phosphopeptide target. Approaches that rely on 
immobilized antibodies to capture their analytes from solution (forward phase approach) are limited 
by [CONTACT_865547] a relatively large amount 
of starting material as well as using a single condition for multiple antibodies. In contrast, the 
reverse phase approach (RPPA) is accomplished by [CONTACT_865548] 
a high protein -binding substratum such as a nitrocellulose slide using a robotic microarrayer 
requiring small amounts of input protein which has been boiled in SDS mimicking the rigorous 
conditions of western blotting. Each slide can accommod ate up to [ADDRESS_1207355]. Gordon Mills at MD Anderson 
Cancer Center (MDACC). Using RPPA, we are currently analyzing biomarker expression levels in

tumor biopsies obtained before, during and after intratumoral gene therapy treat ment using an 
EGFR antisense gene in patients with recurrent HNSCC. As shown in Figure 1, this technique 
provides quantitative information on the expression of critical proteins.

purified AKT, Phospho -AKT peptide were arrayed in duplicate and quantitated. The linearity and 
sensitivity (femtograms of purified protein) is represented in the plot. Panel B. Tissue lysate arrays are 
compared to Western blots of the same cell lysate treated with the KP86328 (AKT inhibitor) and 
LY294002 (PI3 kinase inhibitor). The squares highlight the detection of phospho -AKT upon EGF 
stimulation by [CONTACT_865549]. Quantitative results from tissue lysate arrays and Western Blot 
demonstrated remarkable concordance.  
 
Preliminary results from tumor biopsies collected from SCCHN patients treated on the first two dose 
tiers of a phase I clinical trial to d etermine the toxicity and biologic efficacy of EGFR AS demonstrates 
that expression of the target gene (EGFR) as well as its phosphorylated form and downstream targets 
can be measured using RPPA (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Detection of tot al EGFR and phosphorylated forms of EGFR (p -EGFR 992, p -EGFR 
1173) in SCCHN tissues by [CONTACT_663261] . Tissue lysates are prepared from SCCHN patients treated on an 
EGFR antisense gene therapy trial. Tissue is harvested before (Pre), during (Dur) and after (Post) 
treatment. Each sample is analyzed in duplicate serial dilutions. The RPPA panels represent results 
from two patients (patients A and B) treated on the first [ADDRESS_1207356] been validated for use in RPPA (see 
http://home.ccr.cancer.gov/ncifdaproteomics ). MDACC and NCI/FDA maintain a joint database of 
validated antibodies for RPPA. These antibodies detect a variety of proteins involved in 
phosphorylati on, apoptosis (activated and cleaved proteins) and cell cycle progression (cyclins, 
phosphohistones p21, p27). Although up to [ADDRESS_1207357] tier of proteins/phosphoproteins would include EGFR, 
pEGFR, Src, pMAPK, STAT3, pSTAT3, pSTAT5, pSTAT1, pAKT, p38, p21, p27, PARP, E - 
cadherin, p -ErbB3, and Ki67. Additional pathways/proteins can be evaluated as other antisera are 
validated and/or new hypotheses emerge from ongoing experiments.  
 
Frozen tumor will be homogenized with lysis buffer. Lysates will be boiled with 1% SDS, mimic king 
the stringent conditions used in immunoblotting. After centrifuging, the protein -rich supernatant can 
be stored at –80°C and transferred to the Mills laboratory at MDACC for RPPA. The cost of setting 
up a RPPA facility (~$500,000) requires that the ly sates be arrayed in the Mills lab. Serial dilutions 
with additional lysis buffer are generated from each lysate immediately prior to array preparation 
using a Tecan liquid handling robot. A robotic arrayer then creates a 640 spot array on 
nitrocellulose -coated glass slides where each spot on the array represents a precise dilution of a 
particular sample lysate. As many as 160 different samples with 4 serial dilutions can be studies  
on a single slide and with robotics, 24 identical slides can be printed at a time. The Mills lab has 
successfully transferred lysates from center to center with retention of signals. Each slide is then 
probed with a specific validated primary antibody under optimal blocking conditions to  minimize  

CTRC# 11 -47 
Version  date January  13, 2015  51 of 53 Confidential   
  
 
background noise.  Multiple controls are placed on each slide to facilitate quantitation. The signal is 
amplified using a DAKO catalyzed system and antibody to -actin and GAPDH can be used as 
controls. Slides are then scanned and analyzed by [CONTACT_865550] (Molecular Dynamics).  
The serial dilution “dot” intensities are quantitated using Microvigene software (VigeneTech, Inc.) 
The Mills lab has demonstrated t hat this technique is sensitive (to femtograms of protein) and 
reproducible. Serial dilutions allow an accurate determination of protein quantity using 
concentration curves of synthetic phospho - and non -phosphopeptides of the antibody -binding site 
for each  antibody.  
 
13.2 IHC Analysis of Tissue Microarrays  
 
Because RPPA is an emerging technology, which cannot identify the cells expressing the target 
protein, we will also carry out IHC analysis of the proteins identified by [CONTACT_865551] s amples. For high throughput immunohistochemical analysis and standardization 
of staining conditions, tissue microarrays (TMAs) will be constructed from formalin fixed paraffin 
embedded tissue blocks from the tumor biopsies. Using a manual tissue arrayer (M TA-1, Beecher 
Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI) 0.[ADDRESS_1207358] 
treatment tumor in triplicate and arrayed on 1 -2 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_865500]. The newly constructed array block will  then be warmed to 35 -37°C for 10 minutes to 
allow annealing of donor cores to the paraffin wax of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_865501]. 
Donor cores will range from 2 -4 mm in length. Hence each TMA will yield an estimated 100 to 200 
tissue sections ( 4 μm thickness). For TMA quality assessment morphologic confirmation of tumor, 
throughout the entire thickness of the block, one hematoxylin and eosin stained slide will be 
prepared from every five tissue sections. Immunohistochemical staining will be perf ormed to 
assess various biomarkers in the EGFR signaling pathway including EGFR, pEGFR, Src, pMAPK, 
STAT3, pSTAT3, pSTAT5, pSTAT1, pAKT, p38, p21, p27, PARP, E -cadherin, p -ErbB3, and Ki67  
on paraffin sections cut from the TMAs using standard methods. Secti ons will be deparaffinized 
with successive ethanol and xylene baths. These sections were then subjected to an optimized 
antigen retrieval method individualized to each antibody. Signal amplification will be performed 
using a proprietary micropolymer peroxi dase (ImmPRESS™, Vector, Burlingame, CA) conjugated 
to an anti mouse antibody. Immunoreactive cells will be visualized with the brown color resulting 
from incubation with diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogenic substrate at room temperature for [ADDRESS_1207359] methods. Sections will be deparaff inized

product of the percentage and intensity of staining. When appropriate, s eparate scores for each 
case will be assigned for cytoplasmic and nuclear staining.

administration of EGFR antisense DNA (pNGVL -EGFR -AS) compared with administration of the control EGFR sense 
DNA. The intratumoral DNA (25 g) was given  three times a week and the intravenous DNA (25 g) was 
administered daily after the formation of palpable tumor nodules (~10 -14 days) (right above).  
 
In addition to the efficacy data, we performed DNA distribution studies using the pNGVL -EGFR AS construct . As 
shown in the summary Table and figures below, the DNA was less widely distributed without co -administration of 
liposomes.38

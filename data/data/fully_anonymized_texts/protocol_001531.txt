Below is the tracked version of the Narrative :  
Narrative Template for Educational, Survey or Interview Research
Prepare a narrative, either within the project description section of the form, or upload an attachment into the web-based
system, which addresses all the questions below. Be sure to discuss in detail the role of the NIH research team and
every other entity who will assist or collaborate in the research, including companies with whom you are subcontracting.
Collaborators or subcontractors, who are not NIH employees and who are conducting the research off-site, will
commonly need IRB approval or an exemption from their own IRB of record. 
Remember to also upload a copy of any recruitment scripts, screening questions, survey, interview, or focus group
questions or scripts as well as the consent language that will be used for your project into the system. Note that the
functionality in the system only allows one document per upload.  If you have more than three documents to upload,
combine them into a single PDF and upload that instead. 
1.	What is the research question or purpose of this research activity?
At the Clinical Center Pain and Palliative Care Service (PPCS) we are currently offering a self-care program to NIH staff
and trainees, developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a self-care program for clinical fellows and attending physicians, the Mindfulness Based
Self-Care (MBSC) program. This program incorporates key components of the well-known mindfulness based stress
reduction (MBSR) which typi[INVESTIGATOR_565704] [ADDRESS_742960] be equitable or
otherwise justified here. (See NIH HRPP SOP 6, 6.12.)
The program is offered to NIH staff and trainees. will be offered to Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410707], as well as first,
second, and third year Hematology-Oncology fellows. Maximum enrollment is [ADDRESS_742961].   
3.	Which entity(ies) will conduct recruitment?  How will it be conducted (telephone, email, regular mail, on-line, in person
or some combination of these)?  If one entity will simply send out a link through a mass mailing, state that. Will that
entity receive and/or maintain any personal identifiers as part of this process? If so, what type of identifiers? (See the list
of possible identifiers is included in NIH HRPP SOP 5, Appendix 2.)
This project doesnt involve any outside collaborators. The class will be advertised by [CONTACT_565711] (dates, times, location, content) class information. an initial introductory lecture during the fellows orientation
sessions and followed up by [CONTACT_565712]/designee and Rezvan Ameli, Ph.D. that will include the
class information, brief description of each session, and information about the program evaluation.  
AAfter finalizing the list of participants, they will be invited to participate in the project as a volunteer.   Those on waiting
list will be invited to participate as the control subject group. fter the fellows have signed up for the class, another email
will be sent out inviting those who have not signed up to participate in the evaluation portion only.  [CONTACT_565722] will have
email addresses and names as part of her role in recruiting for, teaching the classes, and implementing the evaluation,
but none of the questionnaire data collected will be linked to these personal identifiers. 
4.	If the project involves any pre-screening for eligibility, which entity(ies) will conduct pre-screening?  How will it be
conducted specifically (telephone, email, regular mail, on-line, in person or some combination of these)?  Will that entity
receive and/or maintain any personal identifiers as part of this process? If so, what type of identifiers?
N/A.  
5.	What type of research procedures will be used? For example, will this project involve surveys, interviews, focus
groups, educational tests, etc.?  How will data collection be conducted (telephone, email, regular mail, on-line, in person
or some combination of these)?  If not through a website, which entity(ies) will be conducting the various activities?  If
different entities will conduct different parts of the data collection, be clear about which entity will conduct what part.  Will
that entity receive and/or maintain any personal identifiers as part of this process? 
EightSeven short paper and a demographic questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_565713]-participants.
The MBSC participants will also complete a class evaluation.  
MBSC class participants will complete the all eight questionnaires prior to participation in the class 1, after class 5r they
have completed the series, and at a two-month follow up. Therefore, besides the demographic questionnaire, they will
complete a total of 24 1 questionnaires in three time points (3 sets of 87 questionnaires at each time point).  In addition,
before classes 2, 3, 4, and 5 tThey will also complete fourthree short of the questionnaires (MBI, Stress/Anxiety
Thermometer (1 item), MAAS at Time of Assessment (5 items), and Mindful Self-Care (3 items) and after classes 1, 2, 3,
and 4, they will complete three short of the questionnaires (Stress/Anxiety Thermometer (1 item), MAAS at Time of
Assessment (5 items), and Mindful Self-Care (3 items))before and after each of the 5 class sessions.  Therefore tefore,
they will complete a total of 2830 questionnaires during the program (10 sets of 3 questionnaires) in addition to the
above three time points25 questionnaires. The MBSC participants will also complete a class evaluation.   
The non-MBSC class participants will receive the same eight questionnaires in three times points, i.e. before the start of
the class, at the conclusion of the class, and at a follow up as appropriateas the MBSC class but with slightly different
frequency.  
They will complete the questionnaires before, after the classes and at a two-month follow up. Therefore, they will also
complete a total of 21 questionnaires in these three time points (3 sets of 7 questionnaires at each time point).  They will
be also asked to fill out an activity record during the same 1.5 hours that the MBSC participants were in class, and the
same 3 questionnaires as the MBSC group for a total of 15 questionnaires (5 sets of 3 questionnaires).  The non-MBSC
class participants will pi[INVESTIGATOR_565705].
Each participant will be provided with a binder that includes uniquely numbered questionnaires with appropriate weekly
designation. The non-MBSC class participants will pi[INVESTIGATOR_565706].  The instructor will not maintain any link between these numbers and the participants names or
other identifiers.  The numbered questionnaires will allow the instructor to link the questionnaire data to the same
participant without the use of any personal identifiers.  No personal identifiers will be maintained that can be linked to the
data.  For participants, aAttendance will be obtained via an attendance sheet that will include numbers only.
[CONTACT_565722] will oversee the data collection.  The completed questionnaires by [CONTACT_565714].  The packet of numbered questionnaires will be handed to non-MBSC group in numbered envelopes in person
and collected in person at the designated time pointse conclusion of the program.  Group email reminders will be sent
out by [CONTACT_565715]. Both groups will be reminded that
they do should not send in this information by [CONTACT_6968].

Sample Size 
Using PASS software, sample size was determined based on a “Test for Two M eans in a Repeated 
Measures Design.” This compared MBSC and control groups, from baseline to post -intervention. Using 
the primary outcome of PSS -10, a detection of a 1.0 difference was determined to be a meaningful 
change.  
Sample size calculation details inclu ded: two -sided test, power set at 0.90, alpha at 0.05, with equal group 
allocation. The effect size tested a range of differences from 0.[ADDRESS_742970] -intervention, repeated 
measurements were specified as two intervals.  
Due to the repeated measure, the covariance structure specifications were set as compound symmetry, 
with a sigma of 1, and rho of 0.5.  
The estimates yielded the following range of sample sizes:

 Statistical Analysis Plan  
The study is a randomized control trial of MBSC intervention vs controls. The sessions will be 
repeated three times, enrollin g 15 participants and 15 controls each time to ensure adequate 
numbers. 
The analysis will be intent- to-treat based on randomized group allocation.  
The primary outcome is PSS -10, compared between MBSC and controls, and within groups over 
time. The secondary  outcomes are VAS -A, MBI -2, MAAS -T, MAAS -S, MSCS- G, and PANAS -
pos, and PANAS -neg. These will be obtained at three time points for the MBSC group (baseline, 
post-intervention, and 13 -week follow -up), and twice for the control group (baseline and post -
interv ention).  
Demographic characteristics include age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, religion, current 
position, presence of medical conditions, and presence of psychiatric conditions.   
Data will be assessed for their distributional assumptions, and analyzed accordingly either with 
parametric or non -parametric methods, as appropriate. Continuous data between MBSC and 
controls will be compared using two- sample t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Categorical data 
between groups will be compared using chi -square or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.  
For the main analyses, generalized linear mixed modeling (PROC MIXED) for repeated 
measures will be used to compare post -intervention and foll ow-up measures for each outcome. 
These models will involve both between and within group analyses, utilizing statistical power 
and accounting for missing data. In addition, within- subject correlations will be accounted for by 
[CONTACT_565720] s tructure. Post -hoc comparisons will be corrected using the 
Bonferroni method.  
Effect size will also be computed for both between and within groups, using bias -corrected 
Cohen’s d (Hedges’ g).  
Data will be described by [CONTACT_35043] (percentages), mean (SD), median (IQR), and 95% 
Confidence Intervals, accordingly.  
Data will be analyzed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).

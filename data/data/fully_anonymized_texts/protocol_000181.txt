Objectives
CNS metabolism is maintained at the cellular level via  interactions between neurons, 
glia, and the cerebral vasculature.  Previous work has  identified glial metabolism as a 
potential biological substrate driving hypoglycemia-associated  autonomic failure 
(HAAF). Specifically,  shown in an animal  model,  low glucose availability induces glial 
signaling in brain regions responsible for glucodetection, while others have detected 
altered glial metabolism  and substrate preference in human subjects  with HAAF.   The 
alterations in glial metabolism associated with HAAF are strikingly similar to those  
induced by [CONTACT_316636]. This raises  the intriguing possibility 
that HAAF  may be driven by [CONTACT_316637], normally induced only by [CONTACT_316638], which are triggered in diabetic  individuals by [CONTACT_3148]-induced exposure to 
severe hypoglycemia.  
Aim 1: Using a prospective observational study  design, test whether  a [ADDRESS_389572] will 
cause acute alterations in human glial metabolism.  
Hypothesis: Prolonged fasting will induce changes in glial metabolism similar to 
those previously measured in individuals with HAAF.  
Aim 2: Determine if variations in fasting induced hypoglycemia and hypoleptinemia  are 
correlated with changes  in glial adaptation.
Hypothesis: The magnitude of the hypoglycemia and hypoleptinemia experienced 
during fasting  will predict the level of glial adaptation measured  in each subject. 
Background
Although diabetes  is largely  regarded as a disease of hyperglycemia,  diabetics are 
particularly vulnerable to treatment induced hypoglycemia. Following the detection of 
severe hypoglycemia  by [CONTACT_223160] (CNS),  a series of physiological 
countermeasures return serum glucose to euglycemic levels. This process is rarely  
recruited in healthy adults, except in times  of prolonged starvation or in endurance 
athletics (1). Yet, due to the pancreatic dysfunction associated  with diabetes, diabetic 
patients are uniquely  reliant on this physiological response.  Tragically, repeated 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_316625] a progressive loss  of CNS hypoglycemic  counter 
regulation. This condition, termed  hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF),  
leaves diabetic  patients particularly vulnerable  to increasingly severe bouts of 
treatment-induced hypoglycemia (1-4). These  hypoglycemic crises are a significant

Version Date:  September 23, 2016 impediment to the maintenance of healthy  plasma  glucose levels in both type 1 and 
type 2 diabetics  (2, 3, 5, 6), and are associated with a 3.4 fold increase risk  of death (7).  
One insidious aspect  of HAAF is the development of hypoglycemic  unawareness,  a 
situation in which  the normal cues of hypoglycemia such as sweating, tremor, and 
anxiety are lost, thereby [CONTACT_316639] a diabetic’s  ability to behaviorally  counteract  
hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  (2, 5, 6). Results from long-term longitudinal studies suggest 
that between 6-10% of individuals with type 1 diabetes  (T1DM) die as a result  of acute  
hypoglycemia (8-10), undoubtedly a large majority of these  deaths are caused by [CONTACT_316640]  (11). Although HAAF can often be  reversed  by [CONTACT_316641], intensive glycemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_316626] (12-15). This 
subjects individuals with diabetes to an untenable Faustian bargain,  where reductions in 
long-term complications are acquired at the price of increased risk of acute death (16). 
The above only underscores  the need for a more complete understanding of the 
underlying dysfunction  which leads to HAAF, with the ultimate goal of  reducing the 
acute risk of hypoglycemia  associated with interventions utilizing  tight glycemic  control.
 
Although the precise mechanisms underlying the development  of HAAF are unknown,  it 
is thought to be driven  by [CONTACT_316642],  either in  the brain  cells which  detect low 
glucose availability directly, or in brain  regions  which contain  or regulate these  cells (1, 
2, 4). Various mechanisms of adaptation  have been proposed,  which include altered  
CNS glucose utilization, modified  CNS glycogen  storage,  and alterations in  
neurotransmission and/or  neuromodulation,  yet the data supporting each  of these  
mechanisms are largely  inconsistent (1, 4).  Recent advances in neuroimaging 
techniques have  provided novel insights regarding functional  and metabolic changes  in 
the CNS associated with exposure  to acute hypoglycemia (17). Most notably, studies 
utilizing innovative 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques have  
demonstrated that glial metabolism is altered in humans and animals with  type 1 
diabetes (18, 19), in diabetic patients with HAAF (20), as well as in animals models of 
HAAF (21). These findings suggest  that the development of HAAF could be  directly 
attributable to alterations in glial metabolism  following exposure  to hypoglycemia.  
Therefore, in order to gain a better  understanding of the mechanisms underlying the 
development of HAAF,  it is critical to directly link acute reductions in glucose availability  
to changes in glial metabolism in humans.  This is precisely the scientific goal of this 
research proposal.

Based on the investigative  team’s  clinical judgement, a subject may not be 
appropriate for participation in the study.
Our eligibility criteria for the study is limited  to males in an effort  to reduce  variability 
within our small sample size due to the known gender differences in the physiological 
response to hypoglycemia both acutely (22, 23), as well as during a 72-hr fast (24).  
Previous studies have  demonstrated  a reduced  release of counterregulatory hormones  
(e.g. epi[INVESTIGATOR_316627]) in response to hypoglycemia in women. Given that  this 
is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_100739] a limited number of participants to be studied, we have  chosen to 
minimize the potential  variability in our outcome  measures  caused by [CONTACT_316643], by [CONTACT_316644]. This will allow us to  minimize our 
participant numbers.

Study Procedure Descriptions
Acetate infusion/MRS procedure: Glial metabolism will be  measured via MRS  
utilizing a simultaneous intravenous infusion  of 13C labeled acetate. An intravenous 
catheter will be placed in  a vein of each arm, one to infuse 13C-acetate  and the 
other to draw blood samples. 
oParticipant alignment and baseline scans: [ADDRESS_389576]  
both preliminary alignment via MRI as well as baseline MRS scans.  
oAcetate infusion protocol:  The infusate,  350 mM [1-13C]  acetate (99% 
enriched; Microbiological/Pyrogen tested), will be prepared by [CONTACT_316647]. 13C-acetate will be administered for the first  hour  of the MRS 
procedure, at a rate of 6 mg/kg  per minute for the first 5 minutes, and 3 mg/kg  
per minute for the remainder.

Version Date:  September 23, 2016 oBlood sampling  protocol:   Venous blood samples (approximately 2 mL each)  
will be obtained about every  10 minutes, starting 20 minutes  before the 
beginning of the acetate infusion, and will be continued throughout the 
infusion (~15 total draws).  
oMRS protocol: During IV infusion of [1-13C] acetate, MRS  spectra will be 
collected every 10 minutes for 120 minutes  using  a 3 Tesla  GE SIGNA MRI 
scanner housed in the PBRC Biomedical Imaging Center. 
oAnalysis:  The blood collection will be used to measure changes in plasma 
acetate concentrations  and % C13 enrichment of  plasma  acetate over  time, 
via mass spectrometry.  The  MRS spectra  will be used to calculate changes 
in cerebral 13C enrichment of glutamine, glutamate, and  bicarbonate over 
time, which  reflects  glial metabolism  and glial amino acid synthesis.  
Anthropometrics: Fasting body weight will be collected with participants  wearing a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316629]. Height will be collected once at screening. 
Blood collection (study use): Approximately  37.5 mL of  whole blood  will be drawn  
during each acetate infusion/MRS assessment on Days 0 and 3 (described above), 
and approximately  10 mL of additional whole blood  will be collected  on Days 0, 1, 2, 
and 3. The total volume of blood  that will be collected during the study is  
approximately  115 mL (37.5 mL + 10 mL + 10 mL + 10 mL + 10 mL + 37.5 mL).  
Blood will be collected during  the MRS assessment to measure plasma  acetate 
concentrations and % C13 enrichment of plasma acetate via mass  spectrometry.  
Blood will be collected on  Days 0, 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_389577], such  as β-hydroxybutyrate, free fatty acids,  insulin, 
leptin, glucagon,  glucose, and catecholamine concentrations.      
Blood collection (future use): For participants who provide permission, whole blood 
will be collected for future research (10mL  at screening and  10mL at Days 0, 1, 2, 
and 3; 50ml total). Samples collected will be stored for  future use  by [CONTACT_316648].
Continuous glucose monitoring: Blood glucose will be assessed using continuous 
glucose monitoring (CGM).   Briefly, the abdominal area will be disinfected, and then 
trained staff from the Inpatient  Unit will insert  a glucose sensor under  the skin in the 
abdominal area.  The sensor has a small needle-like probe that  inserts into the 
subcutaneous fat of the abdomen and that measures blood glucose levels without  
removing blood from the body.  The  sensor  will then be attached to  the recording 
unit, and the set-up will be secured with adhesive to the participant’s body.   After an 
initial period of equilibration with interstitial glucose, the sensor will be calibrated 
about every 6-12 hours  by [CONTACT_316649]’s finger to measure  capi[INVESTIGATOR_316630].  The CGM device records blood sugar levels every  5 minutes.
DXA: Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans will be performed using a General  
Electric Lunar iDXA whole-body scanner  (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI) during 
the first day of the Inpatient stay.  The  protocol requires that  subjects lie on a table 
wearing a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316631], while the scanner  emits 
low energy  X-rays and a detector passes along the body.  The  scan takes

Data and Specimen  Banking
Biospecimens banked  for future  use will be stored indefinitely at  Pennington Biomedical  
in the Clinical Chemistry  and McDougal Laboratories. Data will be stored with  the 
participant’s de-identified  ID number. Specimens will be  labeled with the participant’s 
de-identified ID number and date of collection.  Data and specimens are accessible by 
[CONTACT_978], his staff and designated Clinical  Chemistry staff  in buildings with restricted 
access. Requests for release of data and/or specimens will be considered  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a 
study investigator. Upon agreement to release  data and/or specimens,  material and/or 
data transfer agreements will be drafted  and approved by [CONTACT_316650]. 
Power analysis
The primary outcomes of this study  are 13C enrichment of 
brain glutamine  and glutamate, measured by [CONTACT_38692].   An a 
priori power analysis  was performed by [CONTACT_316651][INVESTIGATOR_316632], standard deviations, 
and effect sizes previously reported  in a similar study (20). 
This analysis estimated that a sample  size of 6 would 
provide adequate  statistical power  for our primary outcome  variables (Table 2).  This 
protocol allows for enrollment of ten subjects  to account for withdrawals and allow for 
complete data on six subjects. 
Data and Specimen  Management
Study data collected and entered  into the Pennington Biomedical Database  is handled 
only by [CONTACT_316652]. Participant charts and hard copy data are stored  in locked offices  with 
restricted access. Electronic data has exclusive restricted access granted by [CONTACT_316653]/or the PI. For quality control, data and charts  will be 
audited for completeness and accuracy (when possible). 
Study data and specimens will be stored indefinitely at Pennington Biomedical in  the 
Clinical Chemistry  and McDougal Laboratories. Data will be stored with the participant’s

concentrations ([acetate] BR),  Glial acetate  oxidation rate (Vgac), and  astroglial TCA cycle 
rate (VTCAA).  Each subject will participate in two MRS  scans, one immediately  prior to, 
and one immediately  following a 72-h fast. Repeated measures ANOVA  will be used  to 
compare the mean values of percent  enrichment of cerebral glutamine, glutamate,  and 
bicarbonate over time, as well as [acetate] BR, Vgac, and VTCAA measured before and 
after the 72-h fast, i.e., differences between first and  second MRS  assessments.  P-
values < 0.05 will be considered significance.  
Serum hormone and metabolite measurements :  Mean values  of serum hormone  and 
metabolites (including glucose) measured at each time point will be compared via 
repeated measures  ANOVA.  P-values < 0.05 will be considered  significance.   
Additional analysis : Correlation analysis will also be used  to determine if changes in the 
parameters measured via our acetate infusion/MRS procedure are related to changes  in 
our serum  hormone and metabolite measurements.  
Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure  the Safety of Subjects
We will use the definitions of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse  Events,  and 
Unanticipated Problems Involving  Risks to Subjects or Others below. Events will be 
recorded from the participant during their inpatient stay by [CONTACT_316654].  For each  sign, 
symptom or adverse event, the following  information will be  recorded: 
A brief descriptor  of the adverse event 
Start and stop dates  
Intensity (mild / moderate / severe)  
Whether the AE was “serious” or not (as defined below) 
Causal association with the intervention assigned (none  / doubtful / possibly / 
probably / very likely) 
Outcome  (resolved  / resolved with sequelae / improving / still present and 
unchanged / death) 
Action taken with respect to the intervention (none / intervention temporarily  
discontinued / medical therapy required  / intervention permanently discontinued / 
other). 
The Pennington Biomedical  Research  Center’s Human Research Protections Program’s 
definitions for adverse event, serious adverse  event, and unanticipated problem 
involving risks to subjects or others (Policy 8) will be applied  in this study and are as 
follows: 
An adverse event  is any untoward physical or psychological occurrence in a 
human subject  participating  in research, including any  abnormal sign (e.g.,  
abnormal physical exam or laboratory  finding, symptoms  or disease associated  
with the research or the use  of a medical  investigational test article), symptom, or 
disease, temporally  associated with the subject’s participation  in the research. An 
adverse event  does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the 
research, or any risk associated with the research  or the research  intervention, or 
the assessment.

Version Date:  September 23, 2016 A serious adverse  event is defined as an adverse event  that is fatal or life-
threatening, permanently disabling, requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316633],  congenital anomaly or birth  defect.
An unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others is defined  as 
any incident, experience, outcome  or new information where  all three  elements 
exist:
oIs unexpected;
oIs related or possible related to participation in the research, and
oIndicates that subjects or others  are at a greater risk  of harm (including  
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm)  than was previously  
known or recognized. 
While federal  guidelines do not require the reporting of adverse events  to the IRB, 
unanticipated problems  involving risks to subjects or others  will be reported to the IRB 
within 10 working days of ascertainment  of the event per HRPP guidelines. 
Upon completion  of each participant, participant’s anthropometric and adverse event 
data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_94350] [INVESTIGATOR_316634]. When incidental findings on imaging studies or out of range 
values on lab tests are obtained by [CONTACT_24355], the participant will be notified  and a 
copy of the report sent to his physician.   For lab tests, this pertains only to  those tests 
for which  results are obtained in real-time. 
Withdrawal of Subjects
Participants may be withdrawn  from the research without their consent  if they fail to 
comply with the prolonged fasting  protocol  or leave  campus during  their Inpatient stay.  
Participants that withdraw from the research will not be followed  long-term as this 
protocol employs an acute intervention. 
Risks to Subjects
This study  does not involve major  risk to study participants.  To minimize the potential  
risks of the assessment methods and outcome variables, investigators  will frequently  
monitor the study to assure that no volunteer  suffers any adverse  effects from 
participating in the research.  Risks of complications will be  reduced  by [CONTACT_316655].  The inclusion and exclusion 
criteria were created to ensure participants  would  have minimal  risk for completing the 
study protocol. The Medical Investigator,  Kishore Gadde, MD, will monitor the study  
closely and review all non-serious and serious adverse events.  Potential risks  
associated with the study procedures include (listed  alphabetically):
Blood draw. There is the possibility of pain and bruising at the vein on  the arm 
where the needle is inserted.  Aseptic (sterile) technique and trained nursing  staff 
minimizes these  risks. Each  acetate  infusion/MRS assessment will collect 
approximately 30 mL of whole blood.   The  maximum amount of whole blood 
collected throughout  the 4 day evaluation period (including for future use) is 
about 165 mL.

Page 10 of 15
Version Date:  September 23, 2016 Blood pressure testing. Participants  may experience  discomfort during blood 
pressure recordings due to the pressure of the cuff inflating on  their arm. This 
discomfort is only temporary and individuals performing this assessment are  
experienced in clinical research studies.
Body  composition  assessment: Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry  (DXA) scans 
are determined to be minimal risk for study participants. The radiation exposure  
from a DXA scan with our equipment (the iDXA), which is 4 to 6 minutes in 
duration, is less than the equivalent of one day of  environmental sun exposure.
Body  weight: There is no risk to participants to have body weight  measured.
13C-MRS: There are no known  biological risks associated with  magnetic 
resonance scanning.  It has been used routinely  for over  20 years.  It produces 
side effects in very few situations.   Those situations include: 
oMetal: Because the magnetic resonance machine uses a magnetic field,  it 
can move any metallic objects that are inside the body.   This disruption of 
metal inside the body is extremely dangerous and may even be life 
threatening.  If the participant thinks  he/she  may have a cardiac stent,  
metallic implant, metallic pi[INVESTIGATOR_2982],  shrapnel,  or any  other metallic material 
in the body, it is of utmost importance that the pariticpant alert the study  
coordinator or MR technician. If the participant  has metallic materials  in 
the body that cannot be removed, we will exclude the participant from this 
study.  
oElectronics: Magnetic resonance imaging involves the use of radio  
frequency energy  that can  disrupt the functioning  of electronic devices.  If 
the participant possesses a pacemaker or any other electronic medical  
device inside the body, the participant will be excluded.
oTattoos and cosmetics : Some tattoos and cosmetics contain metallic 
materials that can heat up during scanning, especially if they are  located 
on the part of the body  being scanned.  If the metallic material heats  up 
enough, the participant  may feel an uncomfortable burning sensation, and 
a skin burn may develop. In some  cases, the amount of metallic  material 
in the area being scanned is so excessive that the scan cannot proceed 
without risk of a burn developi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  In other cases, a cold compress placed  
over the metallic  material can be used to prevent  burning.
oConfinement: During the MR scan,  the participant will be  lying down on a 
table inside of a metal tube.  The  metal tube is a confined place.  This 
might produce a feeling of claustrophobia,  which can be  distressing.  A 
participant who has experienced claustrophobia in the past might become  
too distressed to complete the scan.   In this case, the scan will be halted.
oNoise: The MRI machine creates a loud, rhythmic noise  that sounds like 
grinding or churning.   This can be distressing to those who are sensitive  to 
loud noises.  The participant will be provided with  earplugs to reduce the 
noise.  But, if the participant finds  the machine  noises distressing,  the MR  
technician can halt the scan.
oPeripheral nerve  stimulation:  During  the MR scan, the magnetic field 
around the body  goes through  rapid changes.   These  changes  are all 
within safety limits set by [CONTACT_2165].   But, some  
people experience  twitching in the nerves of their arms  or legs as a result

Version Date:  September 23, 2016 of these magnetic field changes.  This  twitching  is generally not painful, 
and it stops at the end of the MR scan.   But the feeling of  inadvertent  
muscle twitching may make individuals  feel disoriented or uncomfortable.   
Any participant who experiences this and wishes to stop the scan as a 
result will be allowed to do so.
Continuous Glucose  Monitoring  (CGM) :  Because CGM involves the placement 
of an implantable  device  below  the skin, there is the possibility of discomfort, 
pain, and bruising at the site where the device is inserted.  There is also a small  
risk of bleeding and a very small risk of infection  at the site of the blood draw.  
Aseptic (sterile) technique and trained personnel minimize these risks.  Finally, 
the adhesive  may cause redness or irritation of the skin.
Prolonged fasting  (72 hours) : The risks associated with prolonged fasting are 
minimal in healthy adults, and is routinely used  in clinical research  studies   (e.g. 
22, 23), as well as for clinical diagnoses of insulinoma (e.g. 23, 24, 25). 
Participants are likely to experience symptoms of hypoglycemia including cold 
seats, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], shakes, unsteadiness,  drowsiness.  The participants will be 
continually supervised by  [CONTACT_316656], 
and any adverse  events will be recorded. 
Intravenous 13C Acetate infusion: There  is the possibility  of pain and bruising at  
the vein where the needle associated with the IV line is inserted.  Aseptic (sterile) 
technique and trained nursing staff minimizes  these  risks.  We have  significant 
experience in preparing and administering sterile solutions intravenously.  All 
solution will be prepared by a licensed  pharmacist. 13C is a naturally  occurring 
stable isotope of carbon which is commonly use in clinical research  studies.  
There are no reported risks associated with administration of 13C labeled  
compounds.  The amount of acetate infused relative to  blood volume is very low 
and therefore plasma pH  is not anticipated to be affected.  
Urine  collection: There  is no risk to participants in  collecting their urine. 
Potential Benefits  to Subjects
There is no direct benefit to participants.

Medical School. It is intended to emulate, as closely as is possible in healthcare insurance  claims data, the PI[INVESTIGATOR_15597]6  trial described below. Although many features 
of the trial cannot be directly replicated in healthcare claims  data , key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and inclusio n/exclusion criteria, were selected 
to proxy thos e features from the trial. Randomization cannot be emulated  in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a st atistical balancing of measured 
covariates according to standard practice. Investigators assume that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect  estimate and that failure to replicate 
RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims data for emula tion for a range of possible reasons and does  not provide information on the 
validity of the original RCT finding.  
The PI[INVESTIGATOR_15597] 6 trial,  is a is a non -inferiority trial to evaluate the effects of oral semaglutide versus placebo in terms of cardiovascular safety (CV death, nonfatal MI, or 
nonfatal stroke) in patients with type [ADDRESS_594281] as an ac tive-comparator proxy for placebo. Sitagliptin and the class of dipeptidyl 
peptidase -4 (DPP -4) inhibitors have been demonstrated not to have an effect on MACE in a series of RCTs, and they are  used in similar stages o f disease/line of 
therapy as semaglutide, as well as being similarly costly.  
The study will use three data sources: Optum Clinformatics, Merative Marketscan, and Medicare.  
Optum: Study period between 20th Sept 2019 – 29th February 2024  
Marketscan: Study period between 20th Sept [ADDRESS_594282] Dec 202 2

negative control outcome , we 
wanted to include alternative 
negative control outcomes.

4.  Rationale and background 
The purpose of this protocol is to describe the emulation of the PI[INVESTIGATOR_15597]6  trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Market availability of oral Semaglutide began on 19th 
September 2019.[ADDRESS_594285] 122 events, w ith an  
assumption of 3% event rate in both arms over a period of 7 months, which would result in 90% power, to r ule out 80% excess cardiovascular risk to assess 
non-inferiority .2,3 
5.  Research question and objectives 
Table 1 Primary and secondary research questions and objective  
A. Primary research question and objective 
Objective: To evaluate the effect of oral semaglutide versus sitagliptin  (proxy for  placebo)  on MACE outcomes 
(CV death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke).  
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that semaglutide will be superior to sitagliptin at preventing MACE  
Popu lation (mention key inclusion-exclusion 
criteria): The study population includes patients with Type 2 Diabetes (Type2DM) , >=50 years with established 
cardiovascular disease OR >=60 years with subclinical cardiovascular disease . 
Patients were excluded if they had type 1 diabetes, secondary or gestational diabetes, recent use of 
GLP-1, pramlitinide, or DPP4 -I, had a history of diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, recent m yocardial 
infarction, stroke, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929] o r transi ent ischemic attack; heart failure class 
IV, personal or family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 o r familial medullary thyroid 
carcinoma, chronic hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, end stage liver disease, malignant ne oplasm 
within 5 years,  current or recent pregnancy, proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring 
treatment, history of major stomach surgeries  
Exposur e: Oral Semaglutide  
Com parator:  Sitagliptin  
Outcome: Major adverse cardiac event (MACE ), including myocardial infarction, stroke, and all cause death  
Time (when follow up begins and ends): [ADDRESS_594286] of outcome, disenrollment, end of study perio d, 365 days 
after cohort entry date, discontinuation (30 days grace and risk window), switch between the arms, 
6 
 start of any other GLP1 agonists (including injectable Semaglutide) , Other DPP4 or Pramlintide, 
Nursing home admission  
Setting: Patients may be treated in outpatient settings. The outcome will be measured from inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355]/or death.  
Main measure of effect: Hazard ratio  
 
B. Secondary research question 1 and objective 
Objective: To evaluate the effect of oral semaglutide versus sitagliptin on negative control outcomes, including A. 
cataract surgery, B. hernia and C. lumbar radiculopathy  
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that semaglutide will not have a different effect than sitagliptin  
Popu lation (mention key inclusion-exclusion 
criteria): The study population includes patients with Type 2 Diabetes (Type2DM), >=50 years with established 
cardiovascular disease OR >=60 years with subclinical cardiovascular disease . 
Patients were excluded if they had type 1 diabetes, secondary or gestational diabetes, recent use  of 
GLP-1, pramlitinide, or DPP4 -I, had a history of diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, recent myocardial 
infarction, stroke, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929] o r transient ischemic attack; heart failure class 
IV, personal or family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type [ADDRESS_594287] age liver disease, malignant neoplasm 
within 5 years, current or recent pregnancy, proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring  
treatment, history of major stomach surgeries . In addition, pati ents were excluded for baseline hernia 
or lumbar radiculopathy  when the negative outcome was hernia or lumbar radiculopathy  respectively.  
Exposur e: Oral semaglutide  
Com parator:  Sitagliptin  
Outcome: Separate analyses were run for cataract surgery, hernia, and lumbar radiculopathy  
Time (when follow up begins and ends): [ADDRESS_594288] of outcome, disenrollment, end of study perio d, death, 365 
days after cohort entry date, discontinuation (30 days grace and risk window), swit ch between the 
arms, start of any other GLP1 agonists (including injectable semaglutide)  
Setting: Patients may be treated in outpatient settings. The outcome will be measured from outpatient 
procedure codes

6.  Research methods 
6.1.  Study design 
Research design (e.g. cohort, case-control, etc.): New user active comparator cohort study  
Rationale for study design choice: For drug safety evaluations, a cohort study of new initiators is a powe rful design that may be able to address 
confounding by [CONTACT_35151]. It accomplishes this, in large part, through judiciou s selection of an appropriate active-comparator group.4,5 While 
selection of an appropriate comparator in the design phase is crucial, c ohort studies often require additional adjustment of measurable 
confounders. A common method for adjusting for confounding is via a propensi ty score (PS) .

 6.2.  Study design diagram 
 
Note: The CV disease inclusion may include acute MI codes but any acute MI in the 60 days is excluded. History of heart failu re is an inclusion criterion, but heart failure class IV is excl uded.

 6.3.  Setting 
6.3.1 Context and rationale for definition of time 0 (and other primary time anchors) for entry to the stud y population  
Time 0 in the database study was defined to emulate randomization to treatment oral semaglutide versus sitagliptin in the clinical trial design. See appendix 
tables 1 and 2 for operational definitions and d etailed code algorithms . 
6.3.2 Context and rationale for study inclusion criteria:  
Study inclusion criteria were defined to emulate the inclusion criteria for the trial. See appendix tables 1 and 2 for operational definitions and d etailed code 
algorithms . A flowchart of the study cohort assembly is provided in Appendix 3.  
6.3.3 Context and rationale for study exclusion criteria 
Study exclusion criteria were defined to emulate the exclusion criteria for the trial. See appendix tables 1 and 2 for  operational definitions and detailed code 
algorithms . A flowchart of the study cohort assembly is provided in Appendix 3.  
6.4.  Variables 
6.4.1 Context and rationale for exposure(s) of interest 
The exposure and comparator were defined to emulate the agents compared  for the trial , Oral Semaglutide versus Sitagliptin  (proxy for placebo) . See appendix 
tables [ADDRESS_594290]:  
Assuming the effect of the drugs  lasts for 30 days after the days’ supply  finishes , we allow 30 days gap between the dispens ing (grace period) and also add 
30 days  extension  at the end of days’ supply of  the last  dispens ing (exposure risk window) .  
6.4.2 Context and rationale for outcome(s) of interest 
The primary outcome for the database study was defined to emulate the primary outcome for the tria l of MACE. In the trial, th is was a combination of myocardial 
infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. In our e mulation, due to inability to capture caus e of death, our modified MACE outcome was measured as inpatient 
myocardial infarction, inpatient stroke, and all -cause mortality. See appendix tables 1 and 2 for operational definitions and d etailed code algorithms . Optum 
includes  death  information from the inpatient discharged dead status, s ocial security death master file, and deaths scraped f rom obituaries or other sources.  
MarketScan includes information from the inpatient disc harged dead status up until 2016.  Medicare includes information from the inpatient discha rged dead 
status, NDI cause of death, and social security death master file.  The positive predictive value for the myocardial infarction outcome  algorithm  using ICD -9 codes 
was observed  to be 88.4% and 94% in validation stud ies.6,7 The PPV for the ischemic stroke outcome algorithm was 88% and 95% in validation studies using ICD9 
10 
 codes.6,8 The ICD9 code algorithms were mapped to ICD10 codes and reviewed by a clinician, but the perform ance of the mapped codes was not further 
validated.  
Secondary outcomes from the trial that will be evaluated include:  
1. Myocardial infarction  
2. Stroke  
3. All cause d eath  
Control outcomes of interest include:  
1. Cataract surgery. This is a negative control outcome where no difference in effect is expected for semaglutide versus sitagli ptin. 
2. Hernia. This is a negative control outcome where no difference in effect is expected for semaglutide versus sitagliptin.  
3. Lumbar radiculopathy. This is a negative control outcome where no difference in effect is expected for semaglutide  versus sitagliptin.  
6.4.3 Context and rationale for follow up  
Both on -treatment (OT) and intention -to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted. Adherence in clinical practice is expected to be much worse than in the trial , therefore 
the OT analysis will be the primary analysis . The OT analysis  targets the relative hazard of outcomes while on treatment and may more close ly emulate the effect 
observed in highly adherent trial participants.

6.4.4 Cont ext and rationale for covariates (confounding variables and effect modifiers, e.g. risk factors, comorbidities, comedications) 
We identified a series of covariates that were likely confounders due to being strong risk factors for the primary outcome that were associated with choice of 
treatment. These include demographics, disease severity related variables, como rbid conditions, comedications, frailty, healthcare utilization and markers of 
health  seeking behaviour.

6.5.  Data anal ysis 
6.5.1 Context and rationale for anal ysis plan 
The study will use a propensity score (PS) based fine -stratification weighting method with [ADDRESS_594298] ratio for oral Semaglutide versus Sitagliptin inhibitor on MACE outcome in the weighted popul ation using a Cox 
proportional hazards model.  
Table 4. Primary, seconda ry, and subgroup analysis specification 
A. Primary anal ysis

be more aligned.  The measurement of these 
population characteristics may be 
measured differently in the RCT vs

levels of specificity and sensitivity.  
Negative control

radiculopathy  We evaluate negative control 
outcomes of cataract surgery, 
hernia, and lumbar 
radiculopathy, where no 
causal effect is expected from 
semaglutide or sitagliptin  We will evaluate the potential 
impact of residual 
confounding on this outcome

expected to be a causal effect  The evaluates the robustness of 
the interpretation of the primary 
analysis by [CONTACT_383292]-adjustment 
method  Instead of 1:1 PS matching, 
we will use PS fine 
stratification weights.  
The analytic cohort will be 
asymmetrically trimmed at 1% 
of the tails. The analytic 
cohort will be weighted to 
estimate the average effect in 
the treated (ATT).  
Each exposed patient will be 
assigned a weight = 1.  Use of fine -stratification 
weights will have more power 
than 1:1 matching  More power to estimate ATT  More complex to understand than 
simple 1:1 match, potentially less

performance of BenchExCal in 
an example where we emulate 
an RCT for an expanded

available.  The analysis will calibrate the 
primary result based on expected 
differences due to bias and/or 
design emulation differences and 
propagate uncertainty regarding 
the impact of these factors into 
the frequentist primary result  The ability to appropriately calibrate 
the result depends on how “close” 
the clinical context is between the 
initial and expanded indication. The 
approach assumes that the net 
effect of bias and design emulation 
differences is the similar.  
 
6.6.  Data sources 
7.6.1 Context and rationale for data sources 
Reas on for selection: The study will be conducted in 3 US health care claims databases: Optum Clinformatics (2019 -Feb 2024), Merative Marketscan (2019 -
2022) and Medicare (a sample that includes all patients with diabetes or heart  failure diagnosis, 2019 -2020).  
Strengths of data source(s): Each data source contains deidentified, longitudinal, date -stamped information on patient enrollment, demographics, 
inpatient/outpatient diagnosis and procedures, admission a nd discharge dates, and medication dispensation. The dea th data is captured in the  Optum database 
from inpatient discharge status, social security death master file, and deaths scra ped from obituaries or other sources. The death data in MarketScan is captured 
from the social security death master file and in patient discharge status. It is recognized that the social security death master file has hig h specificity and positive 
predictive value for deaths. While this data resource has under captured deaths since 2011, the captu re of deaths is not expe cted to be differential between 
compa red exposure groups. The death data is captured in the Medicare database from inpatient discharge status, and so cial security death master file .12-14  
Limitations of data source( s): Patient healthcare encounters are only observable when they are enrolled in an insurance plan that contributes to the databas e. 
Patients may change insurance plans for multiple reasons. Both Optum Clinformatics and Merative MarketScan are primarily empl oyer based insurance 
databases where patients may disenroll with job changes. Patients in Medicare may  move in and out of fee -for-service plans. We are excluding person -time in 
health maintenance organization (HMO) plans due to concerns about the completeness of capture of  diagnoses and procedures. This means that we require 
patients to be enrolled in Medicare parts AB and D during the baseline assessment window and censo r patients if they switch t o part C. In claims data, dispensing 
data for inpatient medication is unavailable. Diagnoses reflect billing practic es, therefore algorithms (preferably validated) are needed for accurate phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_383066].  Services that are not covered by [CONTACT_383293]. The trial evaluated cardiovascular deaths, however we will evaluate all 
cause death in the emulation because most deaths in this cohort of patients at high cardiovascular ri sk will be related to ca rdiovascular reasons, the cause of 
death is not recorded fo r databases not linked to NDI, and the perfor mance of NDI at identifying cardiovascular causes of  death may be suboptimal.14

6.7.  Data manag ement 
 Tracking data:  The Data Use Agreement (DUA) Custodian (Principal Investigator) and the Division Operations Manager (Winta Tekle) are responsible for receiving 
and creating a record of new data associated with the given request. The Operations Manager is responsible for al l indexi ng and archiving of documents and 
electronic media related to data that the Division receives  and will log data location, data contents, and associated DUA and Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
numbers in the Division’s centralized tracking system . 
Handling and storage: In-scope data will be stored utilizing Mass General Brigham approved information systems – i.e., Division servers and Mass General 
Brigham network storage.  
29 
 Archiving : Data retention and any removal will be executed by [CONTACT_463972] (Winta Tekle) and Data Manager (Todd Mac Garvey). The Division 
follows Mass General Brigham enterprise record retention policies and follow the term s of the agreement throu gh which the in -scope data was received.  
Information security: The Division follows Mass General Brigham’s Enterprise Information Security Program (EISP). The EISP h elps by [CONTACT_383295], use, disclosure , duplica tion, modification, or destruction in 
order to maintain their confidentiality, integrity, and availability. To th at end, the EISP policies, standards and procedure s create an information security framework 
that is aligned with the rec ommendations of the International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) publication [ADDRESS_594303] andards 
and Technology’s (NIST) publication 800 -53 Family of Controls and MGB regulatory and legal requirements (as a HIPAA covered  entity).  
 
Mass General Brigham workforce members are required to c omplete new workforce privacy and information security  training upon hire and annually thereafter. 
Refresh training is provided as appropriate. Mass General Brigham workforce m embers are required to review and sign a Confidentiality Agreement upon hire and 
annually thereafter. Additionally, we follow Enterprise Information Security and Privacy policies,  including Managing Workfor ce Members Information Security 
Responsibilities Policy, which was developed to help assure that Mass General Brigham workforce members are competent and eligible to support the informat ion 
security responsibilities associated with their role. Mass General Brigham workforce, including D ivision staff, are required to comply with Enterprise Information 
Security and Privacy Policies.  
 
Facilities:  The research team uses a highly secure, state -of-the-art, computing facility housed at Mass General Brigham’s Corporate Data Centers in Needham and 
Marlborough, [LOCATION_005]  as well as Amazon Web Services (AWS).  We maintain redundant storage for maximal data integrity and high -speed data access.  
The Division uses Mass General Brigham corporate provisioned servers to analyze and store data in c onnection with this projec t. There are strict access controls 
enforced by [CONTACT_383296] t o conduct d ata analyses and contracted data engineers are able to access 
data (e.g., Mass General Brigham Authentication (Active Directory) utilized; auditing, logging, and monitoring enabled; firew alls enabled; etc.). All Division servers 
used in this study are acce ssible to only authorized staff only through the MGB network and utilizing VPN as appropriate (i. e., users must be on the net work and 
logged into VPN to access). Mass General Brigham has a network info rmation security monitoring team and in -scope servers a re enrolled in enterprise security 
tools (e.g., vulnerability scanning service, antivirus, etc.).   
The Division also uses AWS. In -scope AWS services / resources have undergone review and assessment by [CONTACT_383297]’s Informatio n Security Risk 
Assessment Team/ InfoSec Risk Management Team as required and in alignment with NIST 800 -30: Guide for Co nducting Risk Assessments. In -scope AWS 
servers are for our exclusive use (reserved instances), are covered under our organization’ s Business Associate Agreement wit h AWS. In -scope servers are housed 
in anonymous facilities that are not branded as AWS fac ilities. Physical access is strictly controlled both at the perimet er and at building ingress points by 
[CONTACT_189266], intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means.  
Security attributes and controls for the Division’s use of in -scope AWS in connection with this project include: encryption at rest and in transit (industry standard 
AES-256 encryption, SSL/TSL), anti -malware, latest OS updates and patches as well as an ti-virus; multi -factor authentication (MFA), Identity and Access 
Management, including SSO; auditing and logging; princi ple of least privilege, including for traffic and po rts (e.g., deny al l default configurations), use of VPC 
enabled Step functions, etc.; separation between environments; minimum necessary (out of the box AWS roles are not used as they can be overly permissive); a ll 
data would reside in the US domestic regions – use only US east HIPAA compliant region; performance monitoring enabled and revie wed as per internal 
processes; passwords compliant with enterprise password policy and, as appropriate, more protective password requi rements; et c. Our Division’s AWS use is also 
subject to ongoing evaluation and monitoring as well – e.g., vulnerability sc anning and management, access review, etc.  
[ADDRESS_594304] of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS 
service in Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon VPC. CloudTrail captures all API [INVESTIGATOR_383067]2, Ama zon EBS, and Amazon VPC as events, including calls 
from the console and from code calls to the APIs. MGB IT/security staff have full access to Clou dTrail to ensure that CloudTr ail monitoring is available at all times. 
Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a ne ar-real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources. Amazon Cloud Trail can log, continuously 
monitor, and retain account activity related to acti ons across the MGB AWS infrastructure. CloudTrail pro vides event history of MGB AWS account activity. This 
event history simplifies security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting and complies with requirements to e nsure the data file inventory is 
controlled by [CONTACT_170327].  
Backups : Backups are created using industry recognized Cryptographic mechanisms (e.g., 256 -bit AES encryption) as appropriate and required. Data are backed 
up within the MGB network from the MGB Needham data center to the MGB Marlborough data center via replicatio n/mirroring and volume -level snapshots.  AWS 
Backup supports both instance -level backups as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and volume -level backups as separate snapshots based on the resource tags. 
AMIs allow MGB IT and security staff to create backup s of all S3 and EC2 instances. This backup approach allows elimination of EC2 instances when access to 
CMS data files is no longer needed. Use of temporary instances will allow highest security control to be applied regarding for whom and when CMS data fil es are 
accessible.  
In addition to the safeguards listed above, the Division follows enter prise privacy and information security policies and mai ntains internally procedures in 
connection with this project to safeguard the data in connection with this project as appropriate a nd required including: Physical Security and Environmental 
Controls for Electronic Information Policy; IT Access Control Standards for Users policy; Safeguarding Fax Copi[INVESTIGATOR_383068] T elephone Use and Pagers; Physical 
Removal and Transport of Protected Hea lth Information and Personal Information policy, etc.  
 
. 
6.8.  Quality control 
Senior Programmers and Research Specialists perform QA/QC on raw or common data model converted data via SAS/R/Aetion software. The protocol will be 
iteratively developed and pre -specified data checks including feasibility counts and balance on baseline covariates will be cond ucted with outputs reviewed  by [CONTACT_463973]. Team members will review code li sts to ensure  fidelity to intended algorithms  
6.9.  Study size and feasibility

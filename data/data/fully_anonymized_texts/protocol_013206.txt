This document is a protocol for a human research study. Th e study is to be conducted 
according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 
and International Conference on Harmoniz ation guidelines), applicable government regulations 
and institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1  Background  
In the [LOCATION_002], the estimated 12 -month prevalence of a DSM -IV alcohol use disorder 
(AUD) is 8.5%; this includes 4.7% of individu als with alcohol abuse and 3.8% with alcohol 
dependence (AD) (Grant, Dawson et al. 2004 ).  Although AUDs are associated with a range of 
problems and are a leading cause of preventabl e death in the [LOCATION_002] (Mokdad, Marks et 
al. 2004 ), their treatment is generally not evidence based (McGlynn, Asch et al. 2003 ).  Thus, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_237513], since 2005, NIAAA has recommended that medications with demonstrated 
efficacy be considered as a first -line treatment for AD, in pr actice, few people  receive such 
treatment  (Mark, Kranzler et al. 2003 ; Mark, Kranzler et al. 2003 ; Mark, Kassed et al. 2009 ).  In 
part, the reluctance of physicians to prescribe alc ohol treatment medications and of patients to 
take them stems from their limited efficacy (Mark, Kranzler et al. 2003 ; Mark, Kranzler et al. 
2003 ).  Further, although s ome studies have included subject s who are heavy drinkers, without 
necessarily meeting a di agnosis of AD (Kranzler, Armeli et al. 2003 ; Karhuvaara, Simojoki et al. 
2007 ; Kranzler, Tennen et al. 2009 ), most medication trials have been limited to individual s with 
AD, reducing their applicability  to heavy drinkers and other s who want to reduce their drinking .  
Recently, DSM -5 replaced the abuse/ dependence distinction with the diagnosis of AUD, which 
requires that only two of 11 criteria be met for the diagnosis.  This will increase the identification 
of individuals needing an intervention (Agrawal, Heath et al. 2011 ; Peer, Rennert et al. 2013 ).  
This study  will help to address that need by [CONTACT_237676][INVESTIGATOR_237514] -5 AUD 
who are  regular heavy drinkers.  
 
Currently , three  medications are FDA -approved to treat AUD : naltrexone, acamprosate, and 
disulfiram (Harris, Kivlahan et al. 2010 ). Emp irical evidence suggests that naltrexone reduces 
the reward properties of and cravings for alcohol (Sinclair 2001 ) and acamprosate supports 
abstinence (Mason, Goodman et al. 2006 ); however, their effect sizes compared to placebo are 
small (Mark, Kranzler et al. 2003 ; Rosner, Hackl -Herrwerth et al. 2010 ; Oliva, Maisel et al. 
2011 ). Disulfiram differs from naltrexone and acamprosate in th at it blocks the metabolism of 
alcohol’s primary metabolite, acetylaldehyde, which accumulates in the blood causing 
unpleasant effects when alcohol is ingested (Franck and Jayaram -Lindstrom 2013 ). There is 
limited evidence of the efficacy of disulfiram, and its potential for toxicity limits it use (2009 ). 
These concerns about safety and limited efficacy likely contribute to the fact that FDA -approved 
medications for AUD are not widely prescribed (Mark, Kranzler et al. 2003 ; Mark, Kranzler et al. 
2003 ). Indeed, only 2.8% of patients treated in the Veterans Health Administration who were 
diagnosed with an AUD received pharmacotherapy (Oliva, Maisel et al. 2011 ). Given these 
issues and concerns, several medications, other than the currently approved medications for 
AUD, have been prescribed off  label and have shown promise in reducing alcohol consumption.  
The anticonvulsant topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], though not approved to treat AD, substantially reduced t he 
frequency of heavy drinking  in four placebo -controlled trials and two open -label studies.  Based 
on th ese findings, topi[INVESTIGATOR_237515] -label to treat AD (e.g., in the 
VA Healthcare System).  Recently, we found that the ab ility of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237516]2832407, a  single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) in GRIK1 , the gene encoding the kainate receptor GluK1 subunit.  This 
finding for topi[INVESTIGATOR_237517] (TOP -G)  Page 8

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the  property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_237677], the beneficial effects of which are substanti ally enhanced by [CONTACT_237678]: 
naltrexone (which is moderated by a SNP in the mu -opi[INVESTIGATOR_9811], OPRM1 ) and 
ondansetron (which is moderated by [CONTACT_237679]6A4 , the serotonin transporter gene).  
Consistent with the goal of personalized t reatment for AD, these findings would allow clinicians 
to identify, in advance, which patients are likely to respond to each of these medications and 
which should be spared the unnecessary adverse effects that may accompany treatment in a 
likely non -respon der.  Of note, together, these three pharmacogenetic findings would make it 
possible to select the best medication to reduce heavy drinking  in ~75% of European 
Americans.  
1.1.1  Personalized Treatment of AUD Using Pharmacogenetics  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237518]:  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]’s effects , as mentioned above,  are moderated by 
[CONTACT_237680] , tetrameric assemblies that respond to glutamate.  The GluK1 and GluK2 
kainate subunits (encoded by [CONTACT_237681]1 and GRIK2 , respectively) are the ones for which 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]’s  effects  on AMPA/kainate receptors are most potent  and selective (Gryder and 
Rogawski 2003 ; Kaminski, Banerjee et al. 2004 ).  Kranzler , Gelernter  et al. (2009) examined 
variation in GRIK1 , on the hypothesis that evidence of association t o AD could identify a 
moderator of the effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237519] s with AD.  The study focused on variation in 
the 3’ -half of the gene, including the differentially spliced exons 9, 17, and 18.  The C allele of 
rs2832407 in intron 9 was significan tly overrepresented in AD  (Kranzler, Gelernter et al. 2009 ).  
GRIK1  was also nominally associated with successful attempts to quit smoking in pooled 
genomewide associatio n analyses (Uhl, Liu et al. 2008 ), suggesting that it may serve more 
generally as a moderator of treatment response in addictive disorders.  Ray et al. (Ray, Miranda 
Jr et al. 2009 ) examined the moderating effect of rs2832407 on topi[INVESTIGATOR_237520] [ADDRESS_288027] bo-controlled study of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237521] (Miranda Jr, 
MacKillop et al. 2008 ).  Although they found that the SNP did not moderate the therapeutic 
effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], carriers of the A allele reported more severe topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] -induced adverse 
events.  In our recently completed topi[INVESTIGATOR_237522] (Kranzler, Covault et al. 2014 ) we did not 
find a moderating effect of rs2832407 on adverse events.  However, we found that the SNP 
robustly moderated the therapeutic resp onse to topi[INVESTIGATOR_052].  Further, in that trial, use of a micro -
longitudinal approach, which previously supported the pharmacogenetics of naltrexone  
response (Kranzler, Armeli et al. 2013 ), helped to clarify the associated subjective effects of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], rs2832407, and their interaction.  Although there are no known coding SNPs in 
GRIK1 , rs2832407 is in a region of differential splicing and is upstream of a GRIK1  antisense 
RNA.  Thus, rs2832407 or other SNPs with which it is in linkage disequilibrium may act by 
[CONTACT_237682] e regulation of gene expression.  We are currently examining 
the SNP’s functional effects using expression assays in neural cultures derived from induced 
pluripotent stem cells (Lieberman, Levine et  al. 2012 ). 
1.1.[ADDRESS_288028] prospective study of a genetic moderator of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237523].  Currently, approximately 10% of  FDA-
approved medications contain ph armacoge netic labeling , which allows the prescriber to 
personalize treatment based on a genetic test, representing a paradigm shift in medical care 
(Hamburg and Coll ins 2010 ).  The public health implications of tailoring treatments to those with 
an AUD based on likely treatment response  are considerable .  Pharmacogenetics offers the 
potential to do that with topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] .  Additionally , topi[INVESTIGATOR_194130] a generic medicat ion for which 
there is no incentive for further commercial development .  However, combining a genetic marker 
with the medication offers the potential to develop a commercially viable entity that cou ld lead a 
company to develop topi[INVESTIGATOR_237524].  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237507] (TOP -G)  Page 9 
Version  18: February [ADDRESS_288029] previous studies.  In 
our recently completed trial (Kranzler, Covault et al. 2014 ), use of a 200 mg/day dosage 
enhance d treatment retention and provide d additional information on the optimal dosage of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_237525] (i.e., taking into account both its efficacy and tolerabili ty). 
Subject selection is also an important aspect of this study , and will be more inclusive than in 
previous studies . It will include  both individuals whose goal  is to reduce drinking and individuals 
whose goal is  to become abstinent, allowing us to gener alize the findi ngs regarding the utility of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_237526]2832407 to a more diverse population than prior 
studies, which were limited to people with a goal of abstinence (Johnson, Ait -Daoud et al. 2003 ; 
Johnson, Rosenthal et al. 2007 ) or a goal of reducing drinking (Kranzler, Covault et al. 2014 ).  
This will increase the  external validity of the study. Selected subjects  will also include individual s 
with DSM -5 AUD, a more inclusive diagnostic group than DSM -IV AD.  Given the shift to DSM -
5, this will increase the external validity and applic ability of  the study’s findings.  Our use of  daily 
data collection (i.e., a micro -longitudinal study design) to monitor daily processes  and drinking 
behavior  will provide  insight into  the subjective dimension of topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] ’s effects in reducing 
heavy drinking, both o verall  and as a function of genotype.   Finally, the use of functional 
magnetic resonance imaging to examine the effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237527]2832407 has not previously been done , and it may provide insights into the mechanism of the 
pharma cogenetic effect.  
1.2  Investigational Agent  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237528] f or the treatment of seizures, the  prevent ion of migraine headaches , and for the 
promotion of weight loss (in comb ination with phentermine) . Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237529], with 
peak plasma concentrations occurring at approximately 2 hours following a 400 mg oral dose. 
The bioavailability of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237530] 80% compared to a solution 
and is not affected by [CONTACT_8208]. The mean plasma elimination half -life is 21 hours after single or 
multiple doses. Steady  state is reached in about 4 days.  
According to the FDA -approved labeling, topi[INVESTIGATOR_237531] 
200 mg and 400  mg per day in adults.   
1.3  Preclinical Data  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_194130] a sulfate -substituted monosaccharide with multiple pharmacological effects.  It 
facilitates GABAergic function by [CONTACT_237683] a non -benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_237532] A 
receptor (White, Brown et al. 2000 ), antagonizes glutamate activity at AMPA and kain ate 
receptors (Gibbs, Sombati et al. 2000 ; Skradski and White 2000 ), modifies effects at NMDA 
receptors without directly blocking them ( McDonald and Rogawski 2006 ), blocks voltage -
dependent Na+ and L -type voltage -gated Ca++ channels, and inhibits carbonic anhydrase, and 
enhances K+ conductance ( McDonald and Rogawski 2006 ).  The drug’s effects on 
AMPA/kainate receptors are most potent and selective for those containing the GluK1 
(previously known as GluR5)  and GluK2 (previously GluR6) subunits (Gryder and Rogawski 
2003 ; Kaminski, Banerjee et al. 20 04). 
1.4.  Clinical Data  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237533]: 1) treat seizure disorder , 2) prevent migraine, and  3) 
promote weight loss  (in combination with phentermine).  It is associated with mild -to-moderate 
adverse effects and is best tolerated wh en initiated at a low dosage that is gradually in creased 
over a period of weeks.

(Johnson, Ait -Daoud et al. 2003 ) and a mu lticenter study  in subjects with AD  (Johnson, 
Rosenthal et al. 2007 ), showed it to have a medium -sized effect in  reducing HD . In the first 
study (Johnson, Ait -Daoud et al. 2003 ), [ADDRESS_288030] s received an escalating dosage of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] (beginning with 25 mg/day) or matching placebo for [ADDRESS_288031] s (Johnson, Rosenthal et al. 2007 ), topi[INVESTIGATOR_237534].  Miranda et al. (Miranda Jr, 
MacKillop et al. 2008 ) randomly assigned 61 non -treatment seeking heavy drinkers to receive 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] 200 mg/day, topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] 300 mg/day, o r placebo.  The medication was titrated to the 
target dosage over a 32 -day period and maintained there for one week.  During the titration 
period, the frequency of HD was significantly lower in both topi[INVESTIGATOR_237535].   
In a 12 -week, open -label trial (Rubio, Ponce et al. 2004 ), topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] (up to 400 mg/day) was 
well tolerated and associated with reduced drinking and cr aving by [CONTACT_5875] 2 and decreased  
carbohydrate -deficient transferrin  (CDT) levels beginning at week 6.   In a second open -label 
study  (Paparrigopoulos, Tzavellas et al. 2011 ), subject s completing inpatient alcohol 
detoxification were assigned to receive either topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] (u p to 75 mg per day) plus 
psychotherapy (n = 30) or psychotherapy alone (n = 60).  During a 4 -month follow -up period, 
significantly fewer (66.7%) of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] -treated subject s than the psychotherapy -only 
subjects  (85.5%) relapsed, with topi[INVESTIGATOR_237536]’ median time to relapse being 10 weeks 
compared with four weeks  for those  in the psychotherapy -only group, a significant difference.  A 
placebo -controlled study failed to show a significant advantage for topi[INVESTIGATOR_237537]  (Likhitsathian, Uttawichai  et al. 2013 ).  However, in that study, only 53% of the 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_237538] 47% of the placebo group completed treatment and adherence to the 
prescribed regimen was not evaluated, both of which seriously limit the interpretation of the 
results.  
Our recentl y published  placebo -controlled trial of topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]  200 mg/day in heavy drinkers 
(Kranzler, Covault et al. 2014 ) showe d a robust treatment effect . We randomly ass igned 138 
heavy drinkers ( 62.3% male, 92% with  DSM -IV AD) to receive 12 weeks of treatment with 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]  200 mg/day (n=67, 48.6%) or matching placebo  (n=71, 51.4%), with medical 
management  (MM, see section 6.7.2, below) .  The only demographic or clinical variable on 
which the groups differed was age: placebo  subject s were ~3.[ADDRESS_288032] s.  Using the Timeline Follow -back Method (TLFB ; see section 6.10 , below ) to measure 
drinking during the 90-day pre -treatment period, both groups drank heavily (men: > 5 drinks; 
women: > 4 drinks) on ~5 days/week and had 1 abstinent day/ week .  Fifty-six topi[INVESTIGATOR_237539]  (83.6%) and 61 placebo  subjects  (85.9%) completed the 12 -week treatment period 
(p=0.70 ). There was a main effect of medication group (p<0.001) and an interaction with 
treatment week (p<0.0001).  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237540] (HDD s) and

Dosage Rationale  
The dosage used in the only large prior study of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237546] 300 mg/day, which resulted in a 
differential dropout between active and placebo treatments ( Johnson, Rosenthal  et al. 2007 ). 
The dosage of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237547] (200 mg/day) is based on previous research 
indicating that 200 mg/day is the dosage at which heavy drinkers begin to show therapeutic 
effects (Johnson, Ait -Daoud et  al. 2003 ; Johnson, Rosenthal et al. 2007 ; Miranda, MacKillop et 
al. 2008 ). Further, our previous  study of 138 heavy drinkers who sought to redu ce their drinking 
received a 12 -week treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] 200 mg/day (N=67) or matching placebo and  
showed that topi[INVESTIGATOR_214390], with no serious side effects, and was efficacious at 
reducing heavy drinking da ys and increasing abstinent d ays (Kranzler , Covault et al. 2014 ). As 
recommended in the package insert, w e will reduce the dosage of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237548] -half (i.e., a 
maximum of 100 mg/day) for anyone with a creatinine clearance <70 mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_288033] common adverse effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237549] (49% vs. 6%).  The other most common side effects 
(experienced by 10 -31% of subject s) in clinical trials include: change in sense of taste, 
tiredness/sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], fatigue, dizziness, loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea, weight decr ease, 
difficulty concentrating and difficulty with memory. Cognitive adverse effects (e.g., confusion, 
psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration/attention, difficulty with memory, speech or 
language problems, particularly word -finding difficulties ) that were reported during 6 -month 
migraine prophylaxis studies (28% vs. 10% for placebo) were of mild -to-moderate severity.   
Other adverse effects (experienced by 5 -9% of subject s) in some clinical trials include: 
nervousness, slow thinking, abnormal vi sion, confusion, decreased sensitivity (hypesthesia), 
anxiety, abdominal pain, dry mouth, involuntary muscle contractions, and language problems.  
Depression and mood problems have also been reported (experienced by 5 -9% of subjects).  
Some individual s hav e had suicidal thoughts or actions (ex perienced by [CONTACT_2902] 1% of subject s).  
Although t hese adverse effects have not  been reported in alcohol -dependent subject s, study 
participants w ill be informed that, should they feel a change in their mood, feel depresse d, or 
feel they may harm themselves, they should contact [CONTACT_39635].  
An adverse effect of topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], which is less common but potentially serious is renal calculi 
(experienced by [CONTACT_2902] 2% of subject s).  Drinking an adequate volume of fluids is reco mmended 
while taking topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], and may reduce the risk of renal calculi.  Subject s will be counseled to 
drink water frequently throughout the day.  
Severe metabolic acidosis (incre ased bicarbonate levels) is associated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_237550] 3 -7% of  individuals taking the medication.  We will repeat bicarbonate levels at the 
visit six of the study to identify anyone with se vere acidosis.  Further, individual s taking carbonic 
anhydrase inhibitors will be excluded from this study, due to the added risk  of metabolic 
acidosis.  Treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_237551] (decreased sweating), which has 
primarily been reported in children.   
Acute secondary glaucoma has been described in some people  taking topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], usually 
occurring at the beginni ng of treatment (less than 1%).  Individual s with a history of narrow 
angle glaucoma will be ex cluded from this study.  Subject s will be informed that should they 
have sudden, significant worsening of vision, blurred vision, or eye pain to contact [CONTACT_43038] y 
doctor immediately. This adverse event is very rare.  Overdoses of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237552], drowsiness, speech disturbance, blurred vision, diplopia (double

agitation, dizziness and depression. Deaths have been reported in overdoses.  
Rare and isolated cases of liver failure/hepatitis and blistering skin rashes (bullous skin 
eruptions) have been reported with topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] (less than 1% for  both).   Careful instructions on 
the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237553].  Careful screening  using  module 2 of  the MINI International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview 6.0  (MINI)  will exclude individual s with s ignificant suicidal risk and  
ongoing monitoring throughout the study will serve to reduce the risk of intentional overdose or 
other suicidal behavior.  Suicidal risks will be assessed using the MINI Suicidality section (B) at 
each study visit, and if rated equal to or greater than 9 (i.e., clinically significant suicidal 
ideation), the physician will be consulted to decide the appropriate clinical management.  
It is possible that some hormonal contraceptives (birth contro l pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], hormonal implants or 
hormonal injections) may be made less effective by [CONTACT_12523][INVESTIGATOR_052].  If appropriate, the study do ctor 
will discuss alternatives or additional non -hormonal methods of birth control to be used during 
participation in the study.  Wome n of childbearing potential who are using hormonal 
contraceptives will be instructed to inform the study nurse about any changes in menstrual 
bleeding patterns. Further, at the time of randomization, for women using hormonal 
contraceptives, the study physi cian will discuss with the participant  non-hormonal methods of 
birth control to be used during her participation in the study.  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237554] a category D medication. This 
means that there are data in humans fr om investigational or marketing experience showing that 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_237555], but potential benefits may warrant the use of the 
medication in pregnant women despi[INVESTIGATOR_237556]. Data from pregnancy registries 
show that inf ants exposed to topi[INVESTIGATOR_237557] (oral clefts). Pregnancy testing of women of childbearing potential prior to study 
randomization  (Screening and Informed Consent  visit) and at visits 1 (week 1) , 5 (week 5) , 7 
(week 8) , and 9  (week  11) will minimize the risk of fetal exposure to study medication.    
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237558].  In placebo -controlled clinical trials o f topi[INVESTIGATOR_237559], 
individuals who consume alcohol have not reported ill effects of the combination.  This was the 
case in the recently completed study of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237521], who were drinking from 
the outset of the study.  The medicat ion was well tolerated in that study and there was no 
evidence of differential attrition in the topi[INVESTIGATOR_237542].  
 
Potential Benefits   
Benefits to subject s include careful evaluation of their medical and psychiatric status and 
alcohol use and potential re duction in or discontinuation of their alcohol consumption, which 
may improve their health and wellbeing. Benefits to society include a potential improvement in 
the effectiveness of treatment for problem drinking, which may reduce the personal and societal  
costs associated with the problem.  In addition, clinicians and scientists may better understand 
the effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237560].  An improved understanding of the genetic and 
other moderators of response to these medications will enhance their  clinical utility and the 
process of medications development for alcohol treatment.  
 
Risk/Benefit Ratio  
Although treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_237561] s, it has been shown to be safe when 
administered for the [ADDRESS_288034] been 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237507] (TOP -G)  Page 13 
Version  18: February [ADDRESS_288035] resolved upon discontinuation of the medication.  The potential risks of these 
treatments are minor compared to t he risk incurred by [CONTACT_237686].  
The risk/benefit ratio thus appears favo rable to the proposed treatment . 
2 Study Objectives  
2.1. Primary Objective:   To examine the moderating effect of rs2832407 in GRIK1  on the 
efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]  200 mg/day in reducing the frequency of heavy drinking  in the last six 
weeks of the treatment trial.   We expec t that subject s treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_237562]  (HDDs) than those receiving placebo .  
Our prim ary hypothesis is that the effect will be significantly larger in rs2832407 C -allele 
homozygotes than in A -allele carriers.  We will also examine the SNP’s moderatin g effects on 
the efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237563] -reported drinking measures (e.g., abstinent 
days), adverse consequences of drinking (e.g., the Sh ort In dex of Problems score : SIP; see 
section 6.8.3 below) , and biological measures of heavy drinking ( e.g., %dCDT , an improved 
assay for carbohydrate deficient transferrin ). Finally, we  will conduct [ADDRESS_288036] -
treatment assessments on the hypothesis that rs2832407 C -allele homozygotes  will show 
greater reduction in primary and secondary outcomes after the medication is discontinued.  
The primary outcome  for the study is the frequ ency of heavy drinking (defined as 4 or more 
drinks in a day for women and five or more drinks in a day for men).  
Secondary outcomes include the number of abstinent days, absence of any heavy drinking 
days during the last month of treatment , mean daily alc ohol consumption, drinks/drinking day, 
%dCDT and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase  (GGTP) levels, and severity of alcohol -related 
problems (i.e., SIP score), using models similar to those described below for the primary 
outcome.  
  
2.2. Secondary Objective : To examine daily processes, including expectancies regarding 
the positive effects of drinking and confidence in resisting heavy drinking and their interaction 
with genotype and medication group to predict the intensity of nighttime drinking.  We expect 
that e vening reports of a high level of positive expectations  regarding alcohol’s effects and a low 
level of confidence in resisting heavy drinking  will be associated with heav ier drinking later that 
night.  
Our s econdary hypotheses are that topi[INVESTIGATOR_237564] -outcome expectancies and confidence in resisting heavy drinking across the weeks of 
the study and nighttime drinking measured daily in rs2832407 C -allele homozygotes, but not A -
allele carriers.  
 
2.3 Optional MRI Sub-Study  Objective : Conduct an optional sub -study to examine  the 
effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237565] ( RB) cerebral blood flow and alcohol cue reactivity  
using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) . The goals, rationale, background and 
study methods for this objective are described in Appendix I : “Brain Mechanisms of

This material is the  property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_237687].  We will stratify the randomization on genotype and oversample rs2832407*C 
homozygotes, the most topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] -responsive genotype, to ensu re comparable numbers of 
subject s in the four medication x genotype groups.  We will compare the efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237567] s with AUD  using a two -arm, parallel -
groups design.  S ubject s will either have a goal  to reduce their drink ing to safe levels or to stop 
drink ing entirely .  We will use daily data collection to examine changes in relevant process 
variables and their interaction with genotype and medication group as predictors of HD.  This 
study will be registered on clinicaltria ls.gov.  
At each visit, all subject s will receive MM (Pettinati, Weiss et al. 2004 ) (see section 6.7.2 ), which 
was developed for the COMBINE Trial and which we modified to be relevant for both reducing 
heavy drinking and promoting abstinence.  Random assignment to tre atment group and double -
blind conditions will be maintained throughout the study.  Raters will be trained in the reliable 
use of all assessments.  We will use serum GGTP and percent disialotransferrin (%dCDT), an 
improved assay for carbohydrate deficient t ransferrin (Helander, Wielders et al. 2010 ), to 
validate subject  reports.  Following a one -week pre -treatment assessment period, subjects  will 
receive 12 weeks of treatment.  There will be a 6-day taper period, during which subjects will 
reduce their  dosage of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237568] .  Daily reports 
during the treatment period will be obtained using interactive voice response ( IVR) to identify 
subjective correlates of medication effects a nd to monitor medication use .  Following the [ADDRESS_288038]-treatment follow -up visits to evaluate the durability of treatment effects.    
Two hundred men and women of European descent  will be recruited  using referrals from 
treatment programs throughout Philadelphia; IRB -approved advertisements on mass transit, on 
local radio and television stations and in newspapers, social media, and broadcast email 
messages at institutions ( e.g., the University of Pen nsylv ania Health System ) that offer such a 
service and by [CONTACT_102219]/distributing recruitment materials in community and college settings.  To 
ensure adequate re presentation of Hispanic s of European descent, we will conduct outreach via 
English -language adver tisements in Spanish -language media in the greater Philadelphia area.  
Respondents will initially be evaluated by [CONTACT_237688] -person visit to the  Treatment 
Research Center  of the University of Pennsylvania Pe relman School of Medicine .   
 
Up to  100 men and women veterans of European de scent will  be recruited from the 
CMCVAMC . Recruitment at the CMCVAMC site will be focused on patients identified in primary 
care settings. The Behavioral Health Laboratory ( BHL) conducts clinical assessments on all  
patients referred from primary care.  At the completion of the clinical assessment, all patients 
potentially eligible to participate in this  research , which  has been approved by [CONTACT_237689], Education and Clinical Cente r (MIRECC) , will be informed 
of the project and asked if they may be contact[CONTACT_237690]’s procedures. Additionally, the study will seek referrals 
from the Mental Health Clinic (MHC ) and Addictions Recovery Unit (ARU) within the 
CMCVAMC .  An investigator  and study staff will meet with the staff of the BHL, the MHC and 
ARU  to explain the goals of the research study and ask for assistance with patient referrals.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_237569] -service meetings with the providers to facilitate 
engagement in the recruitment process.  Recruitment flyers and informational brochures will be 
available for potential participants in the Primary Care Clinic,  MHC, and ARU .  
At both the UPenn and CMCVAMC sites, we will stratify subjects based on their genotype to 
ensure comparable numbers of individuals who are rs2832407 C -allele homozygotes and A -
allele carriers  in each of the treatment groups .  We will also stratify by [CONTACT_237691] (i.e., reduced drinking or abstinence).

3.2.1  To examine the moderating effects of the GRIK1 SNP rs2832407 on the response to 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]:   The primary outcome measure will be the frequency of HDDs ( >[ADDRESS_288039] drinks 
in a day for men and >4 in a day for women).  We chose this outcome because it is a sensitive, 
clinically relevant measure in alcohol  treatment trials ( Falk, Wang et al. 2010 ).  Subjects  will be 
followed ir respective of whether they continue to receive treatment, so that the analysis of all 
outcomes will be based on all of the data available for all randomized subject s.  Drinking data 
for this aim will com e from the TLFB (see section 6.10  below).    
 
3.2.2  To examine the relations among daily process measures, medication use, and  
drinking level :  We will use multilevel models to evaluate the associations of alcohol 
expectancies and self-efficacy (confidence in resisting drinking and heavy drinking) with daily 
drinking and how these associations vary as a function of medication group and rs2832407 
genotype.  Similar to Kranzler, Armeli et al. (2013 ), we will focus on predicting nighttime drinking 
(i.e., drinks consumed after the early evening report), but here we will use alcohol -related 
expectancies reported during the early evening in the daily survey.  Nighttime drinking levels will 
be determined by [CONTACT_237692] t hat day (reported the following day).  
3.3  Secondary Study Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints  include : the number of abstinent days, absence of any heavy drinking 
days [the FDA -recommended outcome measure ( Anton, Litten et al. 2012 )], mean daily alcohol 
consump tion, drinks/drinking day, %dCDT and GGTP levels, and severity of alcohol -related 
problems (i.e., SIP score), using models similar to those described below for the primary 
outcome.   All outcomes (primary and secondary) will also be evaluated at [ADDRESS_288040] Selection and Withdrawal

9) Women of child -bearing potential (i.e., who ha ve not had a hysterectomy, bilateral 
oophorectomy, tubal ligation or is less  than two years postmenopausal):  must be non -
lactating  and practicing a reliable method of birth control, and have a negative urine  
pregnancy test prior to the initiation of treatment .  Examples of medically acceptable 
methods for this protocol include: the birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], intrauterine device, i njection of 
Depo -Provera, Norplant, contraceptive patch, contraceptive ring, double -barrier methods 
(such as condoms and diaphragm/spermicide), male partner sterilization, abstinence 
(and agreement to continue abstinence or to use an acceptable method of 
contraception, as listed above, should sexual activity commence), and tubal ligation.  
10) Willingness  to provide signed, informed conse nt and commit to completing the 
procedures in the study  
 
4.1.1 . Inclusion of Women , Children  and Minorities  
1) Based on prior tre atment studies for AUD , we estimate that approximately 32% of 
participants in this study will be women .  This approximates the proportion of the 
population with AUD that is female, so n o specific outreach will be required  to ensure 
adequate representation of women in the study sample .   
2) Children between the ages of 18 and 20 will be included in the study.  Because we will 
be recruiting on college campuses in Philadelphia, we anticipate that up to 10% of the 
sample will be in that age range.  We will limit c hildren to those who are at least 18 years 
of age because data  are insuff icient  to support the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237570].  
3) The primary hypothesis  to be tested in this study is genetic moderation of the response 
to topi[INVESTIGATOR_237571]2832407 .  Preliminary results in a 
sample of 8,051 individuals that were recruited to participate in genetic studies of alcohol 
and drug dependence showed that the prevalence of the rs2832407 C allele was 65.1%  
in European Americans , with 43.1% of individuals being C -allele homozygotes . In 
contrast, among A frican American s, the C allele was the minor allele, with a frequency of 
17.9% and a C -allele homozygote frequency of 3.5%.  Based on the low prevalence of 
the CC genotype ( which  is hypothesized to moderate the beneficial effects of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]), it is not feasible  to recruit an adequate number of African American  subject s 
to test th e hypothesis  in that population .  Thus, for scientific reasons, this study will e nroll 
only subject s who self -identify as being of European ancestry.  Of this number, about 
15% of the subjects will be Hispanic.  To ensure adequate representation of Hispanic 
subject s (~15% of the total), we will conduct outreach via English advertisemen ts in 
Spanish -language newspapers, radio, and television in the greater Philadelphia area.    
4.2  Exclusion Criteria  
1) A current, clinically significant physical disease or abnormality on the basis of medical 
history, physical examination, or routine labora tory evaluation, including direct bilirubin 
elevations of >110% or a transam inase elevation >300% of normal   
2) A history of nephrolithiasis   
3) A history of glaucoma  
4) Current treatment with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, due to the added risk of metabolic 
acidos is.

12) Judged by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_237573]  
4.[ADDRESS_288043] s at the UPenn site will be recruited  using the following methods: referrals from 
treatment programs through out Philadelphia; advertisements on mass transit, on local radio 
stations and in newspapers; social media; and broadcast email messages at institutio ns 
(including the University of Pennsylvania Health System,  Craigslist,  community agencies, local 
college campuses) that offer such a service; and by [CONTACT_102219]/distributing recruitment materials in 
community settings with public posting areas or other means of providing community access to 
materials (such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], town halls, public libraries, YMCAs, health fairs).  We will obtain 
permission at selected locations before distributing or posting the approved recruitment 
materials ( ensuring  compliance  with other institutions’ guidelines, including seeking IRB 
approval as needed to conduct recruitment activities). We will use the Penn Data Store to 
obtain patient demographics, medical diagnosis codes related to AUD, individual names and 
addresses, and provide r names. We will request permission of providers to contact [CONTACT_237693] -approved letter and recruitment materials (i.e. , the study  brochure , 
outreach letter ). We will also use Research Match (Vanderbilt University) , iConnect (UPenn)  
and the Treatment Research Center (UPenn) website  for Internet recruitment . 
To ensure adequate representation of Hispanic s (~15% of the total), we will conduct outreach 
via English -language advertisements in Latino  newspapers, radio, and television in the greater  
Philadelphia area. We will also invite individuals with Spanish surnames identified through the 
University of Pennsylvania Health System electronic medical record that appear to qualify for 
study participation to contact [CONTACT_237694].   The study sam ple will include children (i.e., 
individual s who are 18 -20 years old ). 
We will request a  partial waiver of consent and HIPAA Authorization from the IRB to allow for 
preliminary phone screening for calls initiated by [CONTACT_80361] s.  Individuals deemed eligible 
for in -person screening will sign a HIPAA Authorization and study consent form at their first 
visit. During the in -person screening visit (once telephone screening shows preliminary 
eligibility), each subject  will receive an explanation of the stu dy protocol and 2), its risks, 
potential benefits, and alternative treatments by a study staff member.  Following resolution of 
any questions, individual s who appear to understand the nature of the study and consent will 
be asked to sign the study consent form.  An entire copy of the informed consent form will be 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237507] (TOP -G)  Page 18 
Version  18: February [ADDRESS_288044] .  Based on our experience with this method of recruitment, we anticipate 
that about 30% of subject s eligible and willing to participate will be female.  Because of the 
genetic  moderator analysis, in which European Americans (EAs) have a higher prevalence of 
the C allele of rs2832407 than other population groups in the Philadelphia area (e.g., African 
Americans), we will limit study participation to self -identified E As.  Because  we will be enrolling 
individual s as young as [ADDRESS_288045] and asked if they may 
be contact[CONTACT_237695]. Additionally, the study will seek referrals from the Mental Health Clinic (MHC) and 
Addictions Re covery Unit (ARU) at the CMCVAMC .  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_237574], MHC, and ARU  providers to explain the goals of the research study and ask for assistance 
with patient referrals. An investigator and study staff will have ongoing in -service meetings with 
the providers to facilitate engagement in the recruitment process.  Recruitment flyers and 
informational brochures will be available for potential participants in the Primary Care Clinic, 
MHC, and ARU   
 
Subjects who are referred or who expres s interest by [CONTACT_237696] a telephone screening interview. We will describe the 
nature of the study, including the number of visits, subject protections and confidentiality. If the 
caller is  interested  in participating , we will obtain verbal consent to perform a phone screening 
interview. As part of the verbal consent process, callers will be told that if they are ineligible to 
participate in the study, the only information collected during t he interview that will be retained 
is their name, phone number, and the reason that they were deemed ineligible. They will not be 
told why they were excluded. Only individuals who give verbal consent will be asked to 
complete the phone screen interview.  I f we determine the applicant to be eligible based on this 
screening, s/he will be asked whether  s/he is interested in participating.  If the caller is still 
interested, s/he will be scheduled for an initial informed consent and screening visit. The 
informa tion collected during the phone interview will be retained only if the subject is eligible to 
participate and signs a study ICF at the screening visit. The phone interview will be stored in 
the research record once the participant has signed the ICF. We wi ll maintain a log of subjects 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], which will include their name, phone number, date of call, study status, eligible or 
not eligible, and, for those excluded, the reason the participant was not eligible to ensure that 
we don’t call the same person mu ltiple times.    
4.4  Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects with severe psychological symptoms (e.g., suicidal thoughts), those who fail to adhere 
to protocol requirements, and those who withdraw consent will be wit hdrawn from the study and 
if applicable, referred for appropriate clinical care. Suicidal risks  will be assessed using the MINI 
Suicidality section (B) at each study visit, and if rated equal to or greater than 9 (i.e., clinically 
significant suicidal idea tion), the physician will be consulted to decide the appropriate clinical 
management. If a subject is found to be pregnant during screening or during study, she will 
immediately be withdrawn from the study, referred for obstetric evaluation, and advised to

The form is used to identify the reasons for early termination (e.g., symptomatic failure, adverse 
effects) and othe r relevant circumstances.  Additionally, w e will make a strong effort (via phone 
calls and alternative contact [CONTACT_3031]) to obtain follow -up information on all subjects who are 
prematurely withdrawn from the project.   We will invite subjects to return to  the clinic for 
assessment at the time of their discontinuation from treatment and again at the scheduled end 
of treatment, as well as all post -treatment follow -up visits.  The following efforts will be made to 
contact [CONTACT_237697]: [ADDRESS_288047] (either with the subject or by [CONTACT_47067] a 
message on voicemail or a person answering the subject’s telephone, followed by 2 telephone 
calls by a study physician, followed by a letter.  Only if all of these efforts are unsuccessful in 
obtaining follow -up information (either during an in -person visit or a telephone interview), the 
subject will be considered to be lost to follow -up.

Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237575], the  prevent ion of  migraine hea dache, and for weight loss 
(in combination with phentermine) . The molecular formula  of this  sulfate -substituted 
monosaccharide  is C12H21NO8S  and the  molecular weight is 339.35. It is designated 
chemically as 2,3:4,5 -Di-O-isopropylidene -β-D-fructopyranose sulfamate. According to the FDA -
approved labeling, topi[INVESTIGATOR_237576] 200  mg and 400  mg per 
day in adults.   For more detailed information, see section 1.2 (Investigational Agent) . 
5.2  Treatment Regimen  
The maximal dosage of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237577]  200 mg/day  orally  in two divided doses , 
based on prior evidenc e of the efficacy and greater tolerability of this dosage (Kranzler, Covault 
et al. 2014 ). Although a [ADDRESS_288048] commonly to treat 
AD, we will use a lower dosage to reduce adverse effects.  We will use a six -week titration 
period  (see Table 1 below) , which we found in our completed topi[INVESTIGATOR_237578]. We will reduce the dosage o f topi[INVESTIGATOR_237548] -half for anyone with a creatinine 
clearance <70 mL/min/1.73 m2.

will be carefully documented in the study chart along with the clinical rationale.   The study 
nurse,  in consultation with the study physician , will provide guidance for subjects as they  
increase their medication dosage, per the titration schedule  (Table 1 in section 5.2) . At the end 
of the 12 -week treatment period, subjects will be titrated off study medication over a period of 6 
days  (i.e., 150 mg /day for 2 days, 100 mg /day for 2 days, and 50 mg /day for 2 days) . The 
titration schedule for subjects on a reduced dos age (less than 200 mg/day of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237580])  will be determined by [CONTACT_5989]  
5.3  Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions  using a block 
randomization scheme : topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] 200 mg/day (n = 100) or placebo (n = 100).  A designated 
randomization staff member who is not otherwise  involved in the conduct of the study  will work 
with the Investigational Drug Service (IDS) staff to implement the  randomization.  The process 
for randomization is: 1) a study coordinator  will complete a “ block randomization form,” which 
includes the variables to be entered into the block  random ization prog ram [ i.e., sex, genotype 
(i.e., C-allele homozygote vs A -allele carrier ), number of heavy drinking days in the past month  
(trichotomized )]; 2) the randomization staff member will enter the variables into the block  
randomization program ; 3) the randomizatio n staff member will fax the randomization group to 
IDS, who will assign a kit number to subject and fax kit assignment to research coordinator; 4) 
the research nurse or physician will dispense medication to the subject and complete and sign 
the IDS  prescri ption form included in the starter kit ; 5) the research coordinator will fax the 
completed form to IDS.  
 
Study drug for subsequent visits will be ordered by [CONTACT_237699] 
“Research Pharmacy Schedule” form  (following  the schedule in  Table 1) , a copy of which will be 
retained in the subject’s research file.  At each visit, the research nurse  will dispense a supply of 
study medication . In the event that scheduled visits change or the subject’s dosage is adjusted 
by [CONTACT_5989] , medication will be mailed via a UPS or Fedex to the subject, to ensure 
that they have enough medication to get them to their next scheduled visit. The study physician 
will approve all medication mailed to subjects and the study nurse or physician will docume nt 
the medication dispensed via mail and call to ensure and instruct the  patient on how the 
medication should be  taken and to  document all AEs. Study staff will also document whether the  
mailed medication was received by [CONTACT_423].  
Subjects with severe psychological symptoms or determined to be inappropriate for the study by 
[CONTACT_237700].  Subjects who are withdrawn completely will be 
referred for appropriate clinical care.   
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237507] (TOP -G)  Page 21 
Version  18: February [ADDRESS_288050] Compliance Monitoring  and Enhancement  
We will use three  methods to monitor medication adherence:  
1) IVR technology . At home, subject s will use  IVR daily to report their medication use . 
2) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685] . We will ask subject s to return any unused medication at  each visit , conduct pi[INVESTIGATOR_237581]. 
3) Medical Management . Subjects in both medication groups will receive Medical Management 
(MM; section 6.8.2  below ). MM support s the subject ’s efforts to reduce his/her  drinking  and 
improve medication adherence , with the study nurse making direct reco mmendations for 
positive behavior changes .

starts (i.e., no pharmacotherapy or empi[INVESTIGATOR_237582] 30 days). Subjects  
currently in a treatment program for alcohol use disorders may not participate. Self-help group 
participation will not be disqualifying and attendance  will be monitored to provide a measure of 
participation.  Concomitant  treatment with a psychotropic medication or a medication to treat AD 
is not permitted during the  12-week course of the study.  See exclusion criteria, section 4.2.  
5.7  Packaging

Version  18: February [ADDRESS_288054] access to.  The research  coordinator will maintain  100%  
drug accountability  at the clinic  for the duration of the study. The research coordinator will 
document all medication using a drug accountability log  to track the study medication  from time 
it leaves IDS to the time it is  returned to IDS for reconciliation and disposal . For the CMCVAMC 
site, the UPenn IDS will send a monthly report to the VA investigational pharmacy with a list of 
all subjects randomized to study medication.  
5.9.2   Storage  
Study drug will be stored at the IDS at controlled room temperature (59 -86 degrees F).  Study 
drug kits dispensed from the pharmacy to the clinic will be stored in a locked cabinet  under 
control room temperature  until dispensed. Any returned study medication will also be kept under 
locked condition until returned to the pharmacy for disposal . 
5.9.[ADDRESS_288055] will also document t he amount of study drug returned to the pharmacy 
and the date returned.   
5.9.4  Return or Destruction of Study Drug  
A final reconciliation of all remaining study medication will be made at the end of the study. All 
unused kits and medications dispensed and  later returned by [CONTACT_237701]. The IDS will be responsible for the disposal/destruction of all unused study medication. 
The study coordinator will return each subject’s unused study medication and empty medication 
bottles to I DS for reconciliation as each subject completes the treatment phase of the study. All 
attempts will be made to collect the study medication and bottles from subjects at the end of the 
study and during follow -up sessions as needed.  
6.1  Initial Telephone Sc reen ( approximately 20 minutes)  
Subjects will be recruited through  local advertisements. Subjects who express interest by 
[CONTACT_237702] a telephone screening 
interview. We will describe the nature o f the study, including the number of visits to the center, 
subject protections and confidentiality. If the caller is still interested, we will obtain verbal 
consent for the phone screening. Screening questions cover general health, psychiatric history 
and alcohol consumption. If we determine the applicant eligible based on this screening, s/he 
will be asked whether they accept or decline to participate.  If the caller is still interested, s/he 
will be scheduled for an initial consenting appointment.  
 
6.2  Informed Consent and Screening Visi t (Week 0 ) 
Upon arriving to the Informed Consent and Screening Visit, which will be conducted at the 
Treatment Research Center at [ADDRESS_288056] to ensure a breath alcohol 
concentration (B rAC) of 0.00% to ensure that the subject is able  to provide  informed consent. 
Reading ability will be evaluated ( Slosson Oral Reading Test -Revised (SORT -R; Shaw, 1998)  to 
verify reading ability at an eighth grade level and the capacity to understand the informed 
consent form.  Subjects will then be given the informed consent form  to read, which a  study staff

Version  18: February [ADDRESS_288059](s).   For subjects who are otherwise eligible and interested in pa rticipating in 
the MRI sub -study, an oral HIV test will be administered.  If the oral HIV test is positive, the 
nurse will inform the subject of the result s, counsel the subject regarding the need to confirm 
the finding with a blood test and to avoid poten tial exposure of others to HIV, and draw an  
additional tablespoon (i.e., a total of 4 tablespoons) of blood to conduc t a confirmatory HIV 
blood test. If the blood test is positive for HIV, the subject will be  referr ed for medical care 
and given a copy of t he test to provide to the doctor for the follow -up visit. 
Study staff with complete the following assessments with subjects:  
 Sociodemographic/general subject information: An assessment of medical history, 
personal and family history of alcoholism, marital status, educational and occupational 
information and substance abuse treatment history will be obtained, along with the 
individual’s self -identified ancestry.   
 Slosson  Oral Reading Test : A standardized  assessment used to determine reading 
level.   
 Locator i nformation:   The research coordinator will select subject locators on the basis of 
relationship to the subject, duration and current status of relationship, frequency of 
contact [CONTACT_1155], and willingness to participate. Locators are contact[CONTACT_237706] a subject are unsuccessful, which enhances retention of subjects in 
treatment and data collection.  
 The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -4 (SCID)  will be used to classify subjects 
according to the presence or absence of standard psychi atric disorders according to 
DSM -criteria. The alcohol use disorder criteria will be modified to permit a DSM -5 
diagnosis as well.  
 The International Neuropsychiatric Interview 6.0 (Mini 6 ): Suicidal risk will be assessed 
using the MINI Suicidality section (B) at each study visit and, if rated greater or equal to 
9 (i.e., clinically significant suicidal ideation), the physician will be consulted to decide on 
the appropriate clinical management . 
 The Family History Assessment Module  (Rice, Reich et al. 1995 ) systematically queries 
the subject about the presence of an alcohol use disorder (AUD) in relatives.  The 
subject will provide information concerning parents’ and siblings’ history of alcohol use 
without their being identified.   
 The Timeline Follow -back (TLFB)  (Sobell and Sobell 1992 ) will be used to estimate past 
90-day drinking at intake and at every treatmen t visit going back in time from the last 
assessment.  This interview procedure will provide quantity/frequency of alcohol 
consumption data for each day during the period prior to the interview.  The TLFB is 
reliable and valid when used by [CONTACT_237707].  However, it is less useful than 
daily measures for detecting patterns of alcohol consumption that vary on a day -to-day 
basis (Carney, Tennen et al. 1998 ; Sear les, Helzer et al. 2000 ).   
 Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWA)  is a verbal fluency test that takes 
approximately 5 minutes to administer and measures spontaneous production of words 
beginning with a designated letter (Ruff, Light et al. 1996 ). This measure will be used to 
examine the effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237584].  
 Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -Third Edition Digit Span subtest  (Wechsler 1997 ) will 
be used to assess verbal working memory and explore the potential effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237585].

 The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale –revised (CIWA -Ar) 
(Sullivan, Sykora et al. 1989 ) is a  10 -item scale for clinical quantification of the severity 
of alcohol withdrawal.  
6.3  Visit 1 (Week 1; Baseline and First Treatment Visits)  
Subjects will be informed of their eligibility status within [ADDRESS_288060] s will 
undergo a baseline  research eva luation (lasting up to 2 hours)  within [ADDRESS_288061]’s breath alcohol 
concentration is > 0.02%, an investigator will evaluate whether the subject  is too impaired to 
complete the study assessments. The study visit may be completed at the discretion of the 
investigator .  If the subject is deemed to be unabl e to complete assessments, the investigator 
may ask the subject to wait until his or her blood alcohol level decreases or if that is not feasible 
to return the next day after having consumed no alcohol.  Prior to discharge from the TRC, a  
clinician will assess the subject  to ensure that it is safe for the subject to leave . Study staff wi ll 
complete the following assessments  with all subjects (the exception being that only for women 
of childbearing potential, will study staff obtain a urine sample for a preg nancy test).   
 The Patient  Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9), a validated 9 -item self -report measure of

administered at each visit.  
 The International Neuropsychiatric Interview 6.0 (Mini 6 ): Suicidal risk will be assessed 
using the MINI Suicidality section (B) at each study visit and, if rated greater or equal to  9 
(i.e., clinically significant suicidal ideation), the physician will be consulted to decide on the 
appropriate clinical management . 
 Daily Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Telephone Call  (daily for 12 weeks, beginning 
with the initiation of treatment)  
a. Drinking diary:   Every evening, as part of the daily IVR diary report , subjects will 
record their alcohol consumption  by [CONTACT_237708], wine, liquor and "other" category .  The daily assessment will also include 
the number of  cigarettes smoked  that day .  To capture all drinking during the 
preceding 24 -hour period, subjects are asked to report separately drinking from 
yesterday (in total), and any drinking during the current day, up until the time of 
the IVR report.  This will allow us to examine lagged associations (Kranzler, 
Armeli et al. 2013 )  The time of the calls (5 -8 PM) was chosen to minimize the 
potential for subjects to have begun drinking heavily prior to making the calls.  
Subjects are taught to complete the telephone interview, which requires less t han 
5 minutes/day.  Daily measures of alcohol consumption obtained via IVR will 
enable us to examine co -variation of alcohol -related subjective reports and 
drinking behavior to test for moderator effects.  
b. Daily medication usage:  Subjects will use Interacti ve Voice Response (IVR)  daily 
to report  whether they took  their medication as prescribed .  We previously  found 
that subjects used the IVR system to report their use of medication that day,

c. Subjective Reports  
i. Daily mood :  Patients will be asked to rate their overall mood daily during 
the [ADDRESS_288062] consists of 4 mood adjectives , each of which will be rated on a 
5-point scale (0 = "no t at all" to 4 = "extremely").  The items will measure  
unpleasant ( sad, angry , nervous ) and pleasant ( happy ) mood.   
ii. Expectancies of the effects of alcohol:  These will include 4 items 
assessing anticipated positive  (n=3) and negative (n=1)  outcomes for 
drinking later that day. The positive expectancy items, adapted from 
existing expectancy scales (Rohsenow 1983 ; Fromme, Stroot et al. 1993 ; 
Leigh and Stacy 1993 ), correspond to the commonly identified 
expectancy domains of general pleasure, tension reduction,  and social 
expressiveness. Specifically, subjects will  be asked “If you were to drink 
tonight how likely is it that you” (a) “would have a good time?”, (b) “would 
feel less tense/more relaxed?”,  and (c) would be more outgoing/frie ndly? 
The negative expectancy item will be “would you get sick or have a 
hangove r later?”  Responses will be made on a 5-point.   
iii. Thoughts about drinking:  Based on anecdotal reports by [CONTACT_237710][INVESTIGATOR_237586] (which they differentiated from desire to drink), they w ill be asked 
to rate this measure daily on a 5-point scale.   
iv. Self-efficacy:   We will measure both confidence to avoid drinking and 
confidence to resist heavy drinking  on a 5-point scale.  
v. Desire to drink:   We will measure desire to drink using three  items from 
the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire  (Bohn, Krahn et al. 1995 ), which will be 
rated on a 5 -point scale  
vi. Experience of an alcohol -induced blackout :  We will ascertain whether the 
subject experienced an alcoho l-induced blackout using the following  
yes/no questions : (a) “Since your last call, after or while you were drinking 
alcohol, did you experience a period of time that you could not remember 
things you said or did? (b) (Follow -up question if the person resp onds 
yes): “When you experienced difficulty remembering something  you said 
or did while drinking, did you later remember when given cues or 
reminde rs about it?”  
 Medication Adverse Effects  Checklist :  Subjects will be interviewed by [CONTACT_237711] d to report adverse effects at each study visit using a check list of adverse 
medication effects derived from completed studies of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237587]. This 
method worked well in our completed trial using the 200 -mg/day dosage (Kranzler, Covaul t 
et al. 2014).  
 Measures of treatment received:   Records of medication taken will be kept and subjects 
will be asked to return the unused portion of study medication at each visit.  The nurse will 
also record the number of contact [CONTACT_237712].  
 The Short In dex of Problems (SIP).  The SIP, a 15 -item instrument subset of the 50 -item 
DrInC ( Miller, 1995 ), measures alcohol dependence symptoms and medical, psychological,

 The RAND 12 -Item Health Survey (SF -12) (Ware Jr, Kosinski et al. 1996 ), a self -report 
measure of life functioning in various domains, will be completed at study baseline and 
endpoint. We will focus on the mental health component of the SF -12. 
 Alcohol Urg e Questionnaire (AUQ)  (Bohn, Krahn et al. 1995 ) is an 8 -item, self -
administered state measure assessing the urge for an alcoholic drink at the time the 
questionnair e is completed and provides an index of acute craving. The AUQ contains four 
items pertaining to the desire to drink: two items regarding expectations of positive effects 
from drinking, and two items relating to the inability to avoid drinking if alcohol w ere present. 
This measure has strong correlations with measures of alcohol dependence and severity.  
 The Clinical Institute Withdraw al Assessment for Alcohol Scale –revised (CIWA -Ar) 
(Sullivan, Sykora et al. 1989 ) is a  10 -item scale for clinical quantifica tion of the severity of 
alcohol withdrawal.  
 Composite Scale of Morningness (CSM) is a [ADDRESS_288063]  alert in the morning or later in the day,  e.g. an “owl” or a “lark. ” (Smith, 
Reilly  et al. 1989)  
 Insomnia S everity Index (ISI)  is a five -item questionnaire that assesses the quality of 
sleep and its effect on activities of daily living . (Bastien, Vallieres et al. 2001 ) 
Study staff will train subjects  to use the IVR phone system. Subjects  will be instruct ed on w hen 
to call in each day and how to use the phone system to complete the daily assessment. They 
will receive a written copy of the directions with all of the questions and responses. Study staff 
will program subjects ’ study identification number  into the IV R phone system after they have 
been randomized to study medication.  
Subject s will receive the first counseling session and study medication  (topi[INVESTIGATOR_237588])  
durin g the first treatment session  scheduled on the same day as the baseline assessment  
(after all assessments have been completed) . At this visit, the subject will also meet with the 
physician. At this (and every) visit, the study nurse experienced in the use of  Medical 
Management in alcohol pharmacotherapy trials will use the method to counsel  the subject .  This 
provides a basic clinical intervention that was designed to be used in conjunction with 
prescribed medication, and to be easily implemented by [CONTACT_237714] -
specialty settings.  The treatment will support subjec ts’ efforts to stop or reduce their drinking, 
with the study nurse making direct recommendations for reducing drinking to sensible levels.   
The first counseling session ( which will last approximately 30 minutes) will consist of a review of 
the results of the initial evaluation, identifying any concerns  the subject may have .  The subject  
is then provided with a rationale and information about pharmacotherapy and the importance of 
adherence.  Subsequent treatment sessions (approximately 20 minutes) will be c onducted at 
each treatment visit.  During these sessions, the study nurse will obtain the subjects’  vital signs 
and weight, ask about medication side effects and concurrent medications, perform a brief 
assessment of the subjects’  drinking  and medication ad herence, and in some cases, make 
recommendations on strategies for the  subject  to follow until the next visit.  Men will be advised 
to consume no more than [ADDRESS_288064] drinks per week and 
women will be advised to consume no mo re than 2 drink s per day and 8 drinks per week.  
Because subjects  will not be physically dependent on alcohol, reduction of heavy drinking is a 
safe and ethical goal.

At each visit, the study nurse will dispense study medications as shown in  Table 1. In the event 
that scheduled visits change or the subject’s dosage is adjusted by [CONTACT_5989] , 
medication will be mailed via a UPS or Fedex to the subject, to ensure that they have enough 
medication to get them to their next scheduled visit. Th e study physician will approve all 
medication mailed to subjects and the study nurse or physician will document the medication 
dispensed via mail and call to instruct  the subject  on how the medication should be  taken and to  
document all AEs. Study staff wi ll also document whether the  mailed medication was received 
by [CONTACT_423].  
The dosage of medication will be increased only as tolerated and subjects experiencing 
intolerable adverse effects will have their dosage decreased gradually to the highest tolera ted 
dosage, which  will be determined by [CONTACT_5989] .  Upward titration following a dose 
reduction will be allowed during the trial  to minimize adverse effects while maximizing potential 
efficacy . Dose titration will be carefully documented in the s tudy chart along with the clinical 
rationale.   The study nurse, in consultation with the study physician , will provide guidance for 
subjects as they increase their medication dosage, per the titration schedule.  Subject s will be 
given study medication consi sting of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237589] a 
maximum of 200 mg/day of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237590] (see Table 1 ).

BrAC, weight, and vital signs will be measured. Subjects will be asked not to drink before 
coming to the scheduled visits.  Subjects will be asked to complete a breathalyzer t est.  If a 
subject’s breath alcohol concentration is > 0.02%, an investigator will evaluate whether the 
subject  is too impaired to complete the study assessments. The study visit may be completed at 
the discretion of the investigator.  If the subject is de emed to be unable to complete 
assessments, the investigator may ask the subject to wait until his or her blood alcohol level 
decreases or if that is not feasible to return the next day after having consumed no alcohol.  
Prior to discharge from the TRC, a c linician will assess the subject to ensure that it is safe for 
the subject to leave. Study staff wi ll complete the following assessments  with all subjects (the 
exception being that only for women of childbearing potential, will study staff obtain a urine 
sample for a pregnancy test).    
Subject s who are deemed suitable for assessment  will complete questionnaires  and be 
interviewed by [CONTACT_237715], adverse events, and 
protocol compliance.  At every treatment visit (i.e.,  for a total of 10 sessions), the  study  nurse 
will deliver the MM intervention.  Study staff will also administer the following assessments , as

At each treatment visit, all subject s will receive medical management ( MM), a standard, widely 
used, medically oriented intervention that supports the use of pharmacotherapy and enhance s 
medication adherence in the treatment of AU D (Pettinati,  Weiss et al. 2004 ).  Clinicians with 
minimal specialty training but who are knowledgeable about AUD can deliver this brief and 
effective intervention, which has been widely used .  In MM, the clinician highlights the 
individual ’s AUD symptoms and need fo r treatment.  The subject  is advised to reduce or stop 
drinking, is educated about AUD, is provided a rationale to take medication for its treatment, and 
is instructed on the importance of daily medication adherence.  The clinician and subject  jointly 
deve lop an individualized medication adherence plan and the subject  is given informatio n on the 
medications.  MM enhance s adherence and provide s treatment that is feasible in most medical 
settings, but unlikely to obscure a medication effect on drinking outcom es. 
Subject s will receive MM at each of the treatment visits.  The first MM session will last [ADDRESS_288071] ’s vital signs and weight, adverse effects, medication adherence, and concurrent 
medications; and make recommendations for the subject  to follow until the next visit.  Individual s 
with severe psychological symptoms (e.g., suicidal thoughts) will be withdrawn from treatment 
and referred for appropriate clinical  care. Suicidal risks will be assessed using the MINI 
Suicidality section (B) at each study visit, and if rated equal to or greater than 9 (i.e., clinically 
significant suicidal ideation), the physician will be consulted to decide the appropriate clinical 
management.   
 
Ensuring Adherence to MM Content and Procedures:  Gail Kaempf,  MSN, CRNP,  nurse 
practitioner, has more than 10 years of experience with MM (Pettinati, Weiss et al. 2004 ), 
including  in the completed topi[INVESTIGATOR_237596] (Kranzler, Covault et al. 2014 ). She will train the o ther 
nurses in its administration, which will entail a review of the protocol and MM manual, role -play, 
practice of initial and follow -up sessions, and review of taped practice sessions until adequate 
performance is achieved.  To assure the quality  and uniformity  of all sessions, a udiotapes  (with 
the consent of the participant)  will be used to monitor the MM sessions  for this study . The 
audiotapes will be reviewed by a trained clinician not involved in the counseling process . S/he 
will listen  to 10% of recorded visits  and will  evaluat e adherence to MM principles, record the 
total time in the treatment session, assess the therapeutic relationship, review the achievement 
of reduced drinking goals and clinical improvement during treatment, and provid e individual 
feedback.  One session from each subject will be reviewed with equal frequency for each of the 
nine different M M sessions.  Weekly  protocol adherence meetings will be held with the study 
nurse s to assure protocol adherence.  Audiotapes will be destroyed after review . 
6.10  Description of Laboratory/Medical Assessments:  
These assessments serve to:  1) screen subject s for medical exclusion criteria, 2) assess 
potential adverse effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] , and 3) corroborate self -reported drinking.  Prior to 
entrance into the study, each subject  will receive a physical exam, urinalysis and urine 
toxicology, CBC, a chemistry panel [which includes electrolytes, liver enzymes (ASAT, ALAT, 
GGTP), bilirubin, uric acid, BUN, and creatinine], %dCDT, and pregnancy testing  for women of 
childbearing potential .  Bicarbonate levels will be repeated a t the week six visit  because 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_237591] e can cause metabolic acidosis . Pregnancy testing for women of childbearing potential 
will also be repeated at visits 1 (week 1) , 5 (week 5), 7 (week 8), and 9 (week 11).  If a subject  
reports being pregnant or tests positive, she will immediately be exclu ded or withdrawn from 
treatment with medication, referred for obstetric evaluation, and advised to discontinue all 
drinking.  At the week six visit  and endpoint, GGTP and %dCDT will be repeated to corroborate 
self-reported alcohol consumption. %dCDT will b e measured in the laboratory of [CONTACT_237794][INVESTIGATOR_237507] (TOP -G)  Page 37

7 Statistical Plan  
7.1  Sample Size Determination  
Power for th e analys is for Specific Aim 1 , as described below , will be determined by [CONTACT_237724], so power estimates are based on weeks 7 through 
12 as a 6 -week trial, with adjustments for loss to attrition between baseline and week  6.  Based 
on our prior study  (Kranzler , Covault et al. 2014) , we anticipate that, through the first six weeks, 
94% of subjects  (i.e., n=47 per group) will provide data, despi[INVESTIGATOR_145708] 10% discontinuing 
medication.  We anticipate an additional 6% loss due t o dropout from research during the final 
six weeks, also with 10% discontinuing treatment.  In these power estimates, we use a square 
root transform to approximate the Poisson distributions by [CONTACT_237725], on which we 
base our estimates using the methods of Hedeker et al. (1995 ) and Stroup (1999 ).  Our primary 
comparison is the interaction effect of GRIK1  with TOP.  In our previous study, for the square 
root Poisson scale, we observed a standardized effect ( Cohen 1988 ) of d=0.27 for TOP relative 
to PLA in the AA/AC group and a standardized effect of d=0.[ADDRESS_288072] at 
=0.05, with a total of 4 x 47=188 subjects , with 6% research loss to attrition across six weeks. 
Finally, we assume a  within -subject correlation of  0.[ADDRESS_288073] 81% power for the effects observed in our p rior study. For Specific Aim 
2, we used simulation studies ( Kreft and De Leeuw  1998 ) to evaluate the adequacy of our 
sample size in relation to moderation by [CONTACT_237726]’s effects on the contingent 
relation between early evening outcome expectan cies and nighttime drinking ( Kranzler, Armeli, 
et al. 2013 ).  These show that designs having at least 30 level -2 units with 30 observations each 
(i.e., 900 total person days) will provide power of 80% to detect small effect sizes.  Assuming a 
rate of missi ng data of about 20% ( Kranzler, Armeli, et al. 2013 ), we will have approximately 
15,[ADDRESS_288074].  
7.2  Statistical Methods  
To examine  the moderating effects of  the GRIK1 SNP rs2832407 on the response to TOP  
(Specific Aim 1.)

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the  property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_237727] (Topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]/Placebo) by [CONTACT_237681]1 genotype (CC vs. AA/AC) groups will be 
compared on the weekly number of heavy drinking day s using mixed effects models for count 
responses (83 , 84), fitted using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS and the HGLM module of the HLM7 
program.  Estimates of effects over the final six weeks from the models, with associated 
standard errors and confidence intervals, will be used to test the primary hypothesis, i.e., 
medication group by [CONTACT_237728].   
The fixed effects for the primary models will include  binary factors for intervention group 
(Topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]/ Placebo ) and GRIK1  genotype (CC or AA/AC), and their interaction, with 
covariates for linear and quadratic time trends and further terms for group by [CONTACT_5586], genotype by 
[CONTACT_5586], etc., as appropriate for model  fit.  The random effects will include a random intercept and, 
if necessary, residual autocorrelations, random slopes, or other specifications will be used 
(Molenberghs, Verbeke  et al. 2005 , McCulloch, Searle et al. 2008 ).  Although the primary 
contrasts w ill concentrate on the final six weeks, these models utilize all available data from all 
subjects, so the analyses follow the intent -to-treat principle.  If the polynomial time trends 
described above do not capture the range of individual trajectories obse rved in the trial, then 
more flexible non -linear time trends can also be fitted.  Additional covariates can also be 
included in the models, allowing for sensitivity analyses for effects of covariate imbalances, and 
to examine moderation effects (see below)  and group by [CONTACT_237729] (reduced drinking or 
abstinence) interactions.  For example, we will also include the proportion of European ancestry 
as a covariate, to adjust for admixture.  Here, AIMs genotype data will be used to calculate 
ancestry prop ortions using a principal components method implemented in EIGENSTRAT 
(Price, Patterson et al. 2006 ) or PLINK (Purcell, Neale et al. 2007 ), and the proportion will be 
included in the model as a covariate.  The models can also be extended to allow for zero 
inflation, where weekly patterns of abstinence may yield more zero counts of heavy drinking 
days  than can be accommodated by a Poisson model.   
To examine the relations among daily process measures of expectancies, medication 
use, and drinking level (Speci fic Aim 2.)  
Multilevel models  similar  to those described above will be used to evaluate the associations 
between alcohol expectancies and daily drinking and how these associations vary as a function 
of medication group and rs2832407 genotype.  Similar to K ranzler et al. (2013 ), we will focus on 
predicting nighttime drinking (i.e., drinks consumed after the early evening report) , but here we 
will use alcohol -related expectancies reported during the early evening in the daily survey.  
Nighttime drinking level s will be determined by [CONTACT_237730] (reported the 
following day).  We will follow the general analysis scheme used by [CONTACT_237731] , Armeli  et al 
(2013 ), but will use mixed effects/multilevel models, rather than generalized estimating 
equations (GEE) models ( Walls, Jung et al. 2006 ,Schafer 2006 ).  We will examine the number 
of drinks consumed (using a Poisson model).  We will use the HGLM module of the HLM7  
program, as it is more flexible for some of our models than PROC GLIMMIX in SAS.  Analysis 
will focus on the last six weeks of treatment, consistent with the analyses of the primary 
outcome in Specific Aim 1.   
 Predictors in these models will include 6 day-of-the-week contrasts in the level -1 model  
(i.e., including responses that change over days within person), to control for day of the  week 
trending in the outcomes [ e.g., greater propensity to drink on weekends  (Armeli, Carney et al. 
2000 , Armeli, Tenne n et al. 2000 )], along with linear and quadratic study time contrasts and 
daytime drinking.  The day -level predictor of interest (i.e., expectation of positive effects of 
drinking) wil l also be included in the level -1 portion of the model.  The outcome exp ectancy

that do not change over days) will include treatment group, binary factors for rs2832407

8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1  Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related 
documents such as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators 
brochure, etc .) 
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means 
there is a reasonable p ossibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_3459])  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm).

This material is the  property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_237734]  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as 
adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic  procedures are considered to be adverse 
events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is conside red by [CONTACT_15369] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE 
that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persist ent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly 
of major clinical significance.   They may jeopard ize the subject, and may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, 
a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm 
in an emergenc y department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-
serious adverse events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must b e reported is normally defined as the 
period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  
For this study, the study treatment follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_288077] 
administration of study treatment.   
 
Pre-existing Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the 
condition worsens during the study peri od. 
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet 
the definition of an ad verse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_16469], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is o therwise explained.  At the last 
scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) 
that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to 
participation in this study.  T he investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237507] (TOP -G)  Page 41 
Version  18: February [ADDRESS_288078] that has participated in this study.  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be docum ented as an adverse event if any one of the 
following  conditions is met:   
 The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the 
abnormality  
 The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
 The abnormality is of a degre e that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic 
investigation, etc.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_237599] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in 
this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event 
if the condition meets the criteria for and adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_237600] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse 
event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was 
uneventful.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_237601].

should be recorded immediately in the so urce document, and also in the appropriate adverse 
event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal 
diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source document, though should be 
grouped under one diagn osis. 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of 
each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that 
the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any 
serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related 
to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.

 The reason the event is classified as 
serious   Investigator assessment of the 
association between the event and 
study treatment  
8.3.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
The DSMP is intended to ensure the safety of research partic ipants and the integrity of the 
study data.  [CONTACT_48579], M.D., the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_37105], or one of the 
other study physicians, will be charged with determining the severity rating of all adverse 
events. The study staff (P.I., co -investigators, clinical research coordinator) is responsible for 
collect ing and record ing all clinical data.  As these results are collected, all toxicities and 
adverse events will be identified, graded for severity and assigned causality, reported to the 
required entities, and compi[INVESTIGATOR_51376].  After assigning causality, the P.I. will 
decide the course of action for the study participant. The P.I. will evaluate every adverse event 
and determine whether it affects the risk/benefit ratio of the stu dy and whether modifications to 
the protocol or informed consent form are required.  The principal investigator (and, in his 
absence, physician co -investigators) will differentiate serious from non -serious adverse 
events.  Serious adverse events will be re ported to the Penn IRB and the NIAAA project 
officer within [ADDRESS_288081] (DSMB), 
which will be empanelled prior to initiation of the trial:  
• Summary of adverse events.  
• Dropout rates and reasons for the dropouts.  
• Number of patients who have completed the study.  
• Any oth er relevant information  
The DSMB, a full description of which is provided below, will follow guidelines established for 
monitoring clinical trials in the Center for Studies of Addiction.  It should be noted that, at no 
time will a DSMB member participate i n the review of a study in which he or she is a co -
investigator or otherwise actively involved.  
Any patients thought to be at risk from drinking or psychiatric or medical disorders during 
treatment will be referred to appropriate clinical services. Given t he anticipated moderate 
effect sizes, we will not conduct interim analyses, nor have we elaborated stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_237602] (TOP -G)  Page 43

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the  property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_237735].  An adequate evaluation of efficacy will require a sample size 
larger than what will be available befor e the study is completed as designed.  However, if it 
has been determined, for any reason, that the study should be suspended, we will discontinue 
enrollment of new patients, while continuing the treatment and monitoring of patients already 
enrolled in the  study, unless to do so would create a risk that is not justified by [CONTACT_237736].  
Women of Reproductive Age: As noted above, precautions for pregnant or reproductive age 
women are in accordance with NIAAA requirements and this will be  monitored as part of the 
DSMP. Women who are pregnant, nursing or of reproductive age and not using effective 
methods of birth control will be excluded from the study.  The study inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, in total and as specified in the protocol,  will be the basis for determining study 
eligibility.   As mentioned above, it is possible that some hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth 
control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], hormonal implants or hormonal injections) may be made less effective by 
[CONTACT_12523][INVESTIGATOR_052] .  If appropriate, th e study doctor will discuss with patients alternatives or additional 
non-hormonal methods of birth control to be used during participation in the study.  
Data and Record Safety/Confidentiality: Records, filed in the IRB office, verify that all research 
project personnel have completed training in the protection of human research subjects in 
accordance with the  guidelines of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS) and the Office for Hum an Research Protection (OHRP). The study staff (PI, clinic al 
research coordinator, etc.) will keep all study medical records (including any codes to de -
identified data) under lock and key in a secure location, as required by [CONTACT_2371]. All electronic data 
and files (e.g., database, spreadsheet, etc.) containing identif iable patient information shall be  
password protected. Any computer hosting such files shall have a BIOS password to prevent 
access by  [CONTACT_191394]. If patient data are to be exchanged with others, the data will be 
coded. If identification is necessa ry, then the data will be encrypted while en -route  to the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_237603] (≥128 bits for symmetric encryption (DES) and ≥1024 
bits for asymmetric encryption (RSA).    
All data and blood specimens will be stored without direct identifiable information, but will be 
identifiable via a  linking code. Blood will not be used for the purpose of establishing cell lines. 
Any hard copy records associated with the study will be kept in locked offices at the clinical 
site.  The secured research records are labeled with code numbers only (names a nd other 
identifying information are kept separate from research records). Access to hard copy data is 
only given to staff members working on the study. Only staff members designated to handle or 
analyze study samples will have access to the samples and th eir storage.  Coded blood 
samples are stored in clinic -specific refrigerators and freezers, which are located in secure 
rooms. As per routine in the Treatment Research Center, all electronic files (e.g., database, 
spreadsheet) will be password protected.  Any computer hosting such files will have a BIOS 
password to prevent access by [CONTACT_50000] -authorized users.  
Data used for safety monitoring will include serious adverse events, dropout rates and 
reasons for dropout, enrollment numbers, patient interviews, medicat ion compliance, review of 
symptoms or performance status, review of clinical/diagnostic test results, review of physical 
examination, review of vital signs, review of evaluation performed, protocol deviations, and 
blinded data. If it has been determined, f or any reason, that there will be a suspension of this 
study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_237604]/monitoring of 
previously enrolled patients if it is in the best interest of those patients. We have determined 
that this study involves more than minimal risk to patients, but that potential benefits outweigh 
potential risks of treatment.

8.3.[ADDRESS_288082]  
Introduction:  The Center for the Studies of Addiction, here after referred to as the Center, has 
identified the need to assist investigators  with meeting their ethical responsibility for ongoing 
study monitoring of treatment outcomes and safety monitoring.  Furthermore, NIH Guidelines 
(1998) specify that all clinical trials should have a system in place for appropriate oversight 
and monitoring  to ensure the safety of participants and the validity of the data. In order to help 
meet these needs the Center is establishing a committee called a Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB).  
Purpose: The purpose of the DSMB is to assure that the safety of study subjects is protected 
while the scientific goals of the ongoing studies are being met. Specifically, the DSMB is 
charged with monitoring the safety of participants and the quality of the data, as well as the 
appropriate termination of studies either when significant benefits or risks have been 
uncovered or when it appears that a clinical trial cannot be concluded successfully.  
Objectives:  
A.  To determine which studies conducted at the Center require a Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board.  
B.  To review initial protocols for studies to ensure the following (see Appendix 1):  
• Each protocol captures the information necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of the study when it is ongoing and completed and to provide recommendations that 
may improve the  protocol.  
• Each protocol includes a detailed Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (DSMP).  This 
plan, in turn, also references this DSMB plan as well as specifying modifications to the 
Board plan that are necessary.  The DSMP should also include stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_237606] a clinical trial.  In general, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_237607]:  
1. There is clear evidence of harm or harmful side -effects of the treatment;  2. 
There is no likelihood of demonstrating treatment benefit; or  3. There is overwhelming

evidence of a treatment effect after the prescr ibed level of power is reached).  
• The presence of early unanticipated therapeutic results, side effects or adverse 
consequences for each protocol, and independently make recommendations to

non-treatment compared to the treatment -as-usual arm).  
• The performance of each trial (e.g., protocol violations, improper entry criteria, slow 
accrual rate, low participation rate, failure of randomization, inadequate treatment 
adherence, inadequate follow -up rate, severely compromised validity), and to 
independently make recommendations for improvement or termination if the trial would 
be unable  to prove anything meaningful, regardless of modifications.  
8.3.3. Studies Requiring a DSMP and DSMB  
All clinical trials involving human subjects require study -specific IRB approval  and a detailed 
DSMP, and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_43466]’s DSMB. The DSMB w ill make a determination 
regarding studies that require ongoing DSMB review.  The National Institutes of Health policy 
on data and safety monitoring will serve as a guide to the DSMB in making decisions 
regarding trials that require DSMB oversight and moni toring.  As such, all phase III clinical 
trials are required to have data safety and monitoring in the form of a DSMB.  Phase I or II 
trials will be required to have DSMB oversight for the following reasons: if the investigator is 
the investigational new d rug (IND) holder, if the study has multiple clinical sites, is blinded, or 
employs a particularly high -risk intervention or vulnerable population.  Additionally, a DSMB 
may be indicated when there are special concerns regarding subject safety, a study 
investigator is inexperienced or where study integrity could be enhanced by [CONTACT_237740]. The DSMB’s role is oversight above and beyond that of the Institutional Review 
Board.  The intent of the board is not to place an onerous burden on invest igators.  If a trial 
has the oversight of an external DSMB there does not need to be duplication of effort.  
8.3.4. Scope of Data Monitoring  
The precise nature of the data to be monitored and the analyses used per protocol will be 
determined by [CONTACT_4318]. Th e primary source of the data will be the Case Report Form 
developed for each protocol. The study investigators, as requested by [CONTACT_4318], will provide 
additional detailed information regarding serious adverse events.  
A.  Study Admission Data:  The DSMB wi ll assess the sites’ performance with respect to 
subject recruitment. Monitoring of admission data will include the number of subjects calling 
for treatment for substance use/abuse problems, number of subjects scheduled for an intake 
appointment, number of  subjects who attended an intake appointment, and number of 
subjects admitted to the study. The DSMB may request a report of the reason why subjects 
were disqualified from participating in the study.  For subjects admitted to the study, the

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the  property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_237741] w eligibility criteria for admitted subjects, any protocol violations, and the 
demographic distribution of the subjects (by [CONTACT_237742]) (see Appendix 2).  
B.  Protocol Compliance:  The DSMB will monitor the data per protocol to assess compliance 
with the protocol including adherence to protocol participation rules for safety or administrative 
adherence. Examples of participation rules might include, for example, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_237608], s evere neuropsychiatric 
disturbances or changes in vital signs. The DSMB will also monitor the quality and 
completeness of the data being collected. For data collected at specified times the Board 
should monitor the frequency of missing or erroneous data, a nd presence and frequency of 
outliers.  
C.  Safety Data:  Monitoring of safety data will include per protocol a review of Adverse Events 
(AE’s) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE’s), and data commonly accepted to reflect 
differences in safety between treatmen t groups such as clinical laboratory data, treatment 
retention, and reason for drop out. Safety information for all studies will be reported to the 
Board in a blinded manner. The Board may determine if a review of unblinded data is 
indicated. Unblinded inf ormation will only be discussed during closed meeting sessions. 
Furthermore, the Board may request formal statistical analyses of the safety data.  
For non -serious AE’s, data may be summarized by [CONTACT_6660], with data on individual 
subjects available  for DSMB review as needed and if the study blind is not compromised. For 
SAE’s, data will include all of the adverse event data that meet the FDA definition of serious 
adverse events. In the assessment of SAE’s, the DSMB will review each individual case 
including treatment group assignment.  
After each meeting of the DSMB, the executive secretary will forward a summary report of all 
serious and unexpected adverse experiences to each investigator per protocol. The report will 
document that a review of data and outcomes took place on the date of the meeting. It will 
summarize the Board's review of cumulative serious and unexpected adverse events reported 
without specific disclosure by [CONTACT_2939]. Furthermore, the report will inform investigators 
of the Boa rd's recommendations with respect to progress or need for modification of the 
protocol. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_237609] s.  
The DSMB will follow up on the outcome of AE’s and SAE’s, and that all appropriate AE’ s 
and/or SAE’s are reported to the UPenn IRB, CMCVAMC IRB,  FDA, NIH or other pertinent 
regulatory agency.  
D.  Efficacy Data:  Efficacy data determined by [CONTACT_237743] c omponent which will be required 
to have been reviewed and accepted by [CONTACT_4318].  The data may be presented for all 
treatment groups combined or by [CONTACT_6660]. Data by [CONTACT_237744]. In the 
event that a safety concern arises that requires an interim analysis of efficacy data, an 
analysis may be made on a for -cause basis. Any for -cause interim analysis requested by [CONTACT_237745], the number of comparisons 
to be made for purposes of the analysis, the statistical method to be employed in the analysis, 
the significance required to reach a decision, and the new p value necessary to reject the null 
hypothesis should t he study run to completion (such that the probability of a Type 1 error is 
maintained at <0.05 for all primary analyses that would be conducted).  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237507] (TOP -G)  Page 47 
Version  18: February [ADDRESS_288083] will determine whether interim 
analyses of efficacy data are required. Studies that include interim analysis of efficacy data 
should provide the proposed number of interim analyses to be made, the specific comparisons 
to be made at each such analysis, the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_237610], 
including both standards for the determination of 'overwhelming efficacy' and  an 'inevitable 
failed trial', and the methods of statistical correction to be used to control the final overall Type 
[ADDRESS_288084] on the study if the study is largely completed before 
the conclusions are made, the interim review may be unnecessary.  
E.  Establishing a DSMB  
• Board membership:  T he DSMB will consist of at least four members.  Three members will 
constitute a quorum. The Center’s Executive Committee will approve the composition of the 
DSMB, and appoint the members. The term of membership for the DSMB will be for three 
years.  
• The D SMB members will include James McKay, Ph.D. (Chair), Kyle Kampman, M.D., 
Daniel Weintraub, M.D., Debora h Dunbar, MSN, CRNP, ANP -BC, David Metzger, 
Ph.D ., Reagan Wetherill, Ph .D., Cynthia Clark, Ph.D., CRNP, Kevin Lynch, Ph.D. 
(biostatistician) and Richard Feinn, Ph.D. ( alternate  biostatistician).  
• Because board members should be free of financial interest that could be 
substantially affected by [CONTACT_237746], conflict of interest disclosure 
documentation is necessary to avoid real or apparent co nflict of interest of the DSMB 
members. Individuals invited to serve on the DSMB should disclose in writing to the 
sponsor any potential conflicts of interest, actual or implied by [CONTACT_43463]. Should an 
unanticipated situation arise that the Board member f eels represents a conflict of 
interest, the Board member should recuse themselves from deliberations.  At the start 
of each new member's term, the individual will sign a confidentiality statement 
promising not to disclose any proprietary and nonproprietary  data. Furthermore, no 
disclosure should be made of the deliberations of the Board.  
• The DSMB may identify the need for inclusion of scientists or non -scientists that may 
provide unique insights to a particular study or aspect of a study.  These individu als 
could be a clinical pharmacologist, a medical ethicist or an individual that could bring 
the perspectives of the population under study.  Whenever a project is reviewed that 
directly involves one of the board members, alternate members will be chosen t o 
review the study or studies in question.  At no time will a board member be involved in 
the review of his or her own study.  
F.  Board meeting schedule:  The DSMB meetings will be held annually .  The Board has the 
option of expedited meetings to review un expected SAEs or other urgent issues that may 
arise during the course of the trials. Unscheduled meetings may be recommended and 
initiated by [CONTACT_237747] (or the principal investigator) of the study. 
The data and any other relevant  materials to be reviewed by [CONTACT_237748].  Investigators will be informed 
that their protocol is scheduled for on -going review by [CONTACT_237749][INVESTIGATOR_237507] (TOP -G)  Page 48 
Version  18: February [ADDRESS_288085] of the Meetings:  The DSMB meetings will be divided into three sessions: open, 
closed and executive. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_237611]. The open session may focus on the background of the study, the protocol, status of 
the study, problems with accrual and follow -up, baseline demographic data, complia nce 
issues, frequency of adverse events, documentation of endpoints, data quality issues, flow of 
forms, data based protocol modification issues, and any other issue regarding the studies 
under review that can be discussed without reference to interim comp arative results.  
Following the open session, a closed session will be held. During the closed session, the 
DSMB chair or representative  will conduct the review of all issues and put each issue to a 
vote.  A quorum for the DSMB is (4) voting members. This session will be attended by [CONTACT_237750], the DSMB executive secretary, and if necessary the principal investigator. 
During the closed session, the discussions will focus on the treatment safety, efficacy data, 
whether the primary study question has be en answered, the interim results by [CONTACT_2939] 
(usually masked), determining when study data may be released and reviewing requests for 
access to the results of the interim analysis, and updating the Board on actions taken related 
to their actions and r ecommendations of the previous meeting.  
Following the closed session, an executive meeting may be held. The executive meeting is 
restricted to DSMB members (voting and non -voting members). During these sessions, the 
Board may discuss any unmasked analysis  of a blind clinical trial and any sensitive issues 
surrounding the clinical trials under review.  
H.  Report Format:  Reports to the DSMB may include reports from the Data Management 
Center that reflects  the status of the study, progress or findings to da te, and any relevant 
issues.  Additionally, data are presented that describe the administrative status of the study 
including recruitment.  Reports should also provide a safety assessment and may include 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_237612].  Recommendations relat ed to clinical trials will be made in writing 
by [CONTACT_164950]'s Chairperson to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_95917]. Normally, results of the 
interim analysis will not be disseminated. Only under certain conditions should the results be 
released. The Board  should make the final decision related to the release of this information.  
The Board Chairperson will prepare the draft report of the meeting, with the assistance of the 
Executive Secretary. The Executive Secretary will be responsible for the preparation  of meeting 
minutes for inclusion in the DSMB report. The report will outline and summarize all discussions 
during the open and closed sessions of the meeting. Recommendations and action items will be 
clearly marked within the body of the report. If the DS MB decides to conduct an executive 
session, a statement will be included in the Minutes of the Meeting stating an executive session 
was conducted, but should not disclose the contents of the discussions. Minutes for the 
executive session will be recorded s eparately and not distributed beyond the DSMB members. 
The draft report will be reviewed and edited by [CONTACT_209648]. The Principal Investigators will ensure that their reports are sent to the UPenn IRB, 
CMCVAMC IR B, NIH or others , as indicated.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the  property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_237751], affiliated with a Penn research site, or otherwise responsible for saf ety reporting to the 
Penn IRB. The University of Pennsylvania IRB (Penn IRB) requires expedited reporting of those 
events related to study participation that are unforeseen and indicate that participants or others 
are at increased risk of harm.  The Penn I RB will not acknowledge safety reports or bulk 
adverse event submissions that do not meet the criteria outlined below.  The Penn IRB requires 
researchers to submit reports of the following problems within 10 working days from the time the 
investigator beco mes aware of the event:  
 Any adverse event (regardless of whether the event is serious or non -serious, on -site or 
off-site) that occurs any time during or after the research study, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_237613]:  
Unexpected  (An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, 
any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent 
document and o ther relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and 
package inserts.)  
AND  
Related  to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research procedures” if in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was more lik ely than not to 
be caused by [CONTACT_28821].)  
 
Reporting Process  
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported to the 
Penn IRB using the form: “Unanticipated Problems Posing Risks to Subjects or Others I ncluding 
Reportable Adverse Events” or as a written report of the event (including a description of the 
event with information regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, follow -up/resolution and 
need for revision to consent form and/or other study do cumentation).

Reporting Deaths :  more rapid reporting requirements  
Deaths that occur during the course of a research study and that are:  
 Unexpected; AND  
 Related to the research study; AND  
 When other participants are believed to be at an increased risk of harm  
 
Must be reported to the IRB within 3 days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the 
death .  
Other Reportable  events:  
For clinical drug trials, the following events are also reportable to the Penn IRB:  
 Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious 
unexpected adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as 
agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosis, Stevens -Johnson syndrome).  
 Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigators brochure, 
protocol or informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_237752].

terms of severity or frequency. For example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to 
treatment than initially expected.  
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more 
frequent than initially expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research 
study is of no therapeutic value.  
 Change in FDA safety labe ling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or biologic 
used in a research protocol.  
 Breach of confidentiality  
 Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazard to a research participant.  
 Incarceration of  a participant when the research was not previously approved under 
Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain 
on the study.  
 Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the 
complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
 Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB 
approved protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_237614], or affects the r ights or welfare of subjects.  
8.3.2   Sponsor reporting: Notifying the FDA  
 
N.B. This protocol is being submitted to the FDA as suggested by [CONTACT_237753].  The following information will only be relevant if an IND is r equired.  
 
The study sponsor is required to report certain study events in an expedited fashion to the FDA.  
These written notifications of adverse events are referred to as IND safety reports. The following 
describes the safety reporting requirements by [CONTACT_237754]:  
 
 Within 7 calendar days  
Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug  
– unexpected,  
– fatal or life -threatening, and  
 
 Within 15 calendar days  
Any study event that is : 
– associated with the  use of the study drug,  
– unexpected, and  
– serious, but not fatal or life -threatening  
-or- 
– a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable but is later found to 
fit the criteria for reporting (reporting within 15 calendar days from when even t was 
deemed reportable).

Additional reporting requirements  
Sponsors are also required to identify in IND safety reports all previous reports concerning 
similar adverse events and to analyze the significance of the current event in light of the 
previous reports.  
Reporting Process  
Adverse events may be submitted on FDA Form 3500A or in a narr ative format. If supplied as in 
a narrative format, the minimum information to be supplied is noted above at the beginning of

8.5  Medical Monitoring  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_193311].  This safety monitoring will 
include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, and 
the construction  and implementation of a site data and safet y-monitoring plan (see section 10:  
Auditing, Monitoring and Inspecting).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of 
the number and type of serious adverse events.  
[ADDRESS_288088] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those 
regulations require a signed subject authorization i nforming the subject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to rev oke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject

at the end of their scheduled study period.  
Separate  Certificate s of Confide ntiality from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism (NIAAA) will be obtain ed for both the main study and the sub-study described in this 
protocol. As per the NIAAA’s website: Certificates of Confidentiality are issued by [CONTACT_237756] 301 (d) of the Public Health Service U.S.C. Section 241 (d) to afford special 
privacy protection to subjects enrolled in biomedical, behavioral, clinical, or other research 
within NIH mission areas. A Certificate helps the researcher avoid  compelled 'involuntary 
disclosure' (e.g. , subpoenas) of identifying information about a research subject. It does not 
prevent voluntary disclosures such as disclosure to protect the subject or others from serious 
harm, as in cases of child abuse. Also, a researcher may not rely on a Certificate to withhold 
data if the subject consents to the disclosure.  When a researcher obtains a Certificate of 
Confidentiality, the subjects must be told about the protections afforded by [CONTACT_237757], and 
any exceptions  to that protection. This information is usually included in an 'informed consent'.  
All subjects will be informed about the protections afforded by [CONTACT_237758] -study using the language inserted bel ow: 
“To further help us protect your privacy, we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from 
the [LOCATION_002] Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  
With this Certificate, we cannot be forced (for example by [CONTACT_193689]) to d isclose 
information that may identify you in any federal, state, local, civil, criminal, legislative, 
administrative, or other proceedings. The researchers will use the Certificate to resist any 
demands for information that would identify you, except to pr event serious harm to you or 
others, and as explained below.  
You should understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you, or a member of 
your family, from voluntarily releasing information about yourself, or your involvement in this 
study.  
If an insurer or employer learns about your participation, and obtains your consent to receive 
research information, then we may not use the Certificate of Confidentiality to withhold this 
information. This means that you and your family must also a ctively protect your own privacy.  
You should understand that we will in all cases, take the necessary action, including reporting to 
authorities, to prevent serious harm to yourself, children, or others  (for example, in the case of 
child abuse or neglect) .” 
This language is located in the section of both of the Informed Consent Forms titled “ Who can 
see or use my information?  How will my personal information be protected? ” 
Records, filed in the IRB office, verify that all research project personnel have c ompleted 
training in the protection of human research subjects in accordance with the guidelines of the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Office for Human Research 
Protection (OHRP).  The study staff (PI, Clinical research coordin ator, etc.) will keep all study 
medical records (including any codes to de -identified data) under lock and key in a secure 
location, as required by [CONTACT_2371]. Only date and time of the research visit and lab specimen data will 
be placed in the client’s existing electronic medical record. All electronic data and files (e.g., 
database, spreadsheet, etc.) containing identifiable subject information shall be password 
protected.  Any computer hosting such files shall have a BIOS password to prevent access by 
[CONTACT_50000]-author ized users.  If subject data are to be exchanged with others, the data will be coded. If 
identification is necessary, then the data will be encrypted while en route to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_237616] (TOP -G)  Page 53

All data and blood specimens will be stored without direct identifiable information, but will be 
identifiable via a linking code. The secured res earch records are labeled with code numbers 
only (names and other identifying information are kept separate from research records). Access 
to hard copy data is only given to staff members working on the study. Only staff members 
designated to handle or ana lyze study samples will have access to the samples and their 
storage. Coded blood samples are stored in clinic -specific refrigerators and freezers, which are 
located in secure rooms. As per routine in the TRC, all electronic files (e.g., database, 
spreadsh eet) will be password protected. Any computer hosting such files will have a BIOS 
password to prevent access by [CONTACT_50000] -authorized users.  
Blood will be collected for DNA analysis.  The information derived from analysis of the subjects’ 
DNA will not be provided to the subject, since at the present time the existing preliminary 
genetic data for predicting response to topi[INVESTIGATOR_237617] a basis for genetic counseling. 
Should that situation change over the course of the study, procedures will be developed in 
conjunction with the UPenn IRB, to provide subjects with relevant information on genotype and 
to counsel them in relation to that information. While the study is open, DNA samples will be 
coded with a number that provides an indirect link to the subject’s identity (samples will be 
accessible only by [CONTACT_237738]). Upon completion of the 
study, the sample will be kept in storage indefinitely. However, the sample will forever be 
separated from all identifiers. These de -identified samples may be shared with other 
researchers and used in other projects. The lab procedures for storage include a passcode -
protected locked room, and secure storage freezers.  All samples will be retained securely as 
per lab protocols.   
Data used to pro cess subject payments with the Greenphire Clincard program are entered 
electronically using secure web -based interfaces. Greenphire Clincard is HIPAA compliant. 
Please see document titled, “ ClinCard Data Security and Privacy Statement,” located in the

13 Appendix I:   (Sub -study) Brain Mechanisms of Topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]’s 
Effects on Heavy  Drinking  
13.[ADDRESS_288096] leading risk factor for premature death and disability (Alcoholism 2013 ), as 
well as a leading cause of preventable cancers (Nelson, Jarman et al. 2013 ). Alcohol 
dependence affects 18 -20 million Americans (i.e. 1 in 12), and alcohol problems cost our society 
nearly $225 billion annually (Alcoholism 2013 ). Alcohol dependence is a chronic disorde r 
marked by [CONTACT_237771]. Relapses to drinking are often preceded by a strong desire or 
craving for alcohol when exposed to alcohol -related stimuli. Knowledge of the mechanisms 
underlying stimuli - or alcohol cue -induced craving may aid in the sear ch for additional viable 
pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_237627].   
Currently, there are three FDA -approved medications to treat alcohol use disorders (AUD): 
naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram (Harris, Kivlahan et al. 2010 ). Empi[INVESTIGATOR_237628] (Sinclair 
2001 ) and acamprosate supports abstinence (Mason, Goodman et al. 2006 ); however, their 
effect sizes compared t o placebo are small (Mark, Kranzler et al. 2003 ; Rosner, Hackl -
Herrwerth et al. 2010 ; Oliva, Maisel et al. 2011 ). Disulfiram differs from naltrexone and 
acamprosate in that it blocks the metabolism of alcohol’s primary metabolite, acetylaldehyde, 
which accumulates in the blood causing unpleasant effects when al cohol is ingested (Franck 
and Jayaram -Lindstrom 2013 ). There is limited evidence of the efficacy of disulfiram, and its 
potential for toxicity limits it use (2009 ). These concerns about safety and limited efficacy likely 
contribute to the fact that FDA -approved medications  for AUD are not widely prescribed (Mark, 
Kranzler et al. 2003 ; Mark, Kranzler et al. 2003 ). Indeed, only 2.8% of patients treated in the 
Veterans Health Administration who were diagnosed with an AUD received pharmacotherapy 
(Oliva, Maisel et al. 2011 ). Given these issues and concerns, several medications, other than 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237507] (TOP -G)  Page 60 
Version  18: February [ADDRESS_288097] shown 
promise in reducing alcohol consumption.  
One promising medication for the treatment of AUD is the GABA/glutamate modula tor, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]. Although topi[INVESTIGATOR_237629] -approved as an anticonvulsant, prophylactic treatment 
for migraine, and for weight loss, both preclinical (Hargreav es and McGregor 2007 ; Breslin, 
Johnson et al. 2010 ) and clinical studies (Johnson, Ait -Daoud et al. 2003 ; Rubio, Ponce et al. 
2004 ; Johnson, Rosenthal et al. 2007 ; Miranda, MacKillop et al. 2008 ) show that topi[INVESTIGATOR_237630]. Specifically, topi[INVESTIGATOR_237631] (Rubio, 
Ponce et al. 2004 ); had a moderate treatment  effect in reducing heavy drinking in three 
published placebo -controlled trials (Johnson, Ait -Daoud et al. 2003 ; Johnson, Rosenthal et al. 
2007 ; Miranda, MacKillop et al. 2008 ), and appears to have a larger effect size than naltrexone 
(Baltieri, Daro et al. 2008 ; Florez, Saiz et al. 2011 ) and acamprosate (Kenna, Lomast ro et al. 
2009 ). Kranzler , Covault  et al. ( 2014  found that 200 mg/day of topi[INVESTIGATOR_214390], 
reduced the number of heavy drinking days and increased the number of abstinent days more 
than placebo. In fact, during the last week of the [ADDRESS_288098] findings support the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237632], the mechanisms 
underlying its therapeutic effects  are not well understood. Thus, the present study aims to 
elucidate the brain and behavioral mechanisms that mediate topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]’s reduction of heavy 
drinking.  
Functional neuroimaging provides a powerful, non -invasive method to study addictive 
processes. Fo r example, we, and others, have identified a consistent neural substrate for 
reactivity to cocaine -, heroin -, cigarette -, marijuana - and alcohol -related cues using a variety of 
imaging modalities (Childress, Mozley et al. 1999 ; Grusser, Wrase et al. 2004 ; Hutchison, Rutter 
et al. 2004 ; Franklin, Wang et al. 2007 ; Langleben, Ruparel et al. 2008 ; Goldman, Szucs -Reed 
et al. 2013 ). In general , chronic, heavy substance users show greater neural activity in reward -
related brain regions, such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), striatum, and anterior cingulate 
cortex, during drug cue exposure than during non -drug cues. Neuroimaging techniques have  
also been used to determine how some pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_237633]. For example, naltrexone has been shown to reduce alcohol cue -induced 
activation in the ventral striatum (VS) and OFC in non -treatment -seeking alcoholic s (Myrick, 
Anton et al. 2008 ), suggesting that naltrexone’s effects are mediated through its reduction of 
reward -related cue reactivity. To date, there are no pu blished studies examining the effects of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_237634]. Based on our own recent finding that topi[INVESTIGATOR_237635] (Johnson, Ait -Daoud et al. 2003 ; Johnso n, Rosenthal et al. 2007 ; Miranda, MacKillop et al. 
2008 ) and self -reported craving (Rubio, Ponce et al. 20 04), we hypothesize that topi[INVESTIGATOR_237636] -related neural activity commonly associated with 
heavy drinking (i.e., alcohol cue reactivity). Further, our longitudinal, quantitative perfusion fMRI 
approach, which pro vides for the acquisition of resting brain cerebral blood flow (CBF: ml of 
blood/100 g of tissue/minute ) will provide invaluable information on the mechanisms underlying 
the ability of a GABA/glutamate modulator to blunt alcohol cue reactivity and heavy dr inking.   
Neurogenetics is a promising and novel addition to neuroimaging studies. Twin, family and 
adoption studies indicate that vulnerability to substance abuse is partially inherited. Individual 
response to medications will most likely be related to gen etic phenotypes. Genetics studies, on 
their own, require huge sample sizes and are expensive; however, when combined with 
neuroimaging, which offers a ‘pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103]’ of individual brains, we can learn why some individuals 
are vulnerable to alcohol and substance  use disorders and why others do not. For example,

opi[INVESTIGATOR_237637], and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems. As such, we will focus on genes 
associated with these sy stems, such as DRD4  (D4 dopamine receptor gene), GABRA2  (GABA A 
receptor alpha -2 subunit gene), OPRM1  (mu-opi[INVESTIGATOR_9811]), and GRIK1 (glutamate 
receptor, ionotropic, kainate 1 gene) (Kranzler and Edenberg 2010 ). Further , based on our 
previo us research showing that the C -to-A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2832407, in 
intron 9 of the GRIK1  gene is associated with alcohol dependence (Kranzle r, Gelernter et al. 
2009 ), this variant in GRIK1 will be our primary focus. Thus, those who have the A allele will 
likely show the strongest alcohol cue responses.  
In summary, the data reviewed above provide strong support for the need to identify the b rain 
and behavioral mechanisms underlying the effects of one of the most prescribed (Del Re, 
Gordon et al. 2013 ), yet poorly understood, medications to treat AUD, topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], on key factors 
contributing to heavy drinking. Given that topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] 1) has been shown to be effective in 
reducing heavy drinking (Johnson, Ait -Daoud et al. 2003 ; Rubio, Ponce et al. 2004 ; Johnson, 
Rosenthal et al. 2007 ; Miranda, MacKillop et al. 2008 ), 2) appears to have a larger effect size 
than naltrexone (Baltieri, Daro et al. 2008 ; Florez, Saiz et al. 2011 ) and acamprosate (Kenna, 
Lomastro et  al. 2009 ), and 3) has dual GABA A-mediated inhibitory impulses and AMPA and 
kainate antagonist effects (Johnson and Ait -Daoud 2010 ) that likely suppress reward -related 
mesocorticolimbic dopamine rel ease, we hypothesize that topi[INVESTIGATOR_237638] -related brain regions. The current study will 
elucidate the br ain and behavioral mechanisms underlying topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]’s effects and test our 
hypotheses using a randomized, double -blind placebo -controlled design, pseudo -continuous 
arterial spin labeling (pCASL) perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and 
other relevant assessments described below. This project will yield novel findings on brain and 
behavioral responses to alcohol cues, the neuromodulatory effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237639], and the mechanisms [resting baseline (RB) modulation] underlying the ability of this 
GABA/glutamate modulator to blunt alcohol cue reactivity and heavy drinking. Thus, the 
proposed research, although not a treatment trial , will examine the effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237640].    
13.2  Risk/Benefits  
Potential Risks  
The potential risks of this study include the small risk incurred by [CONTACT_237773], incl uding careful evaluation of their 
medical and psychiatric status. The potential benefits to society include a potential improvement 
in the effectiveness of treatment for problem drinking, which may reduce the personal and 
societal costs associated with the  problem.  
Risk Benefit Ratio  
The potential benefits of this study far outweigh the potential risks. Alcohol use disorders are 
serious disorders with mildly effective pharmacotherapy. Even in the best programs, relapse 
rates are high. Individuals accepted into this study will receive close medical and psychiatric 
monitoring. Subjects will be screened prior to admission into the study and those at risk for 
adverse reactions will be excluded.  
14 Sub-Study Objectives  
Objective 1 :  Demonstrate neuromodulatory eff ects of a GABA/glutamate modulator, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], on RB and alcohol cue reactivity

Version  18: February 19 , 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the  property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_237774] 1: We hypothesize that topi[INVESTIGATOR_237641] ‘at rest’ and during alcohol cue  exposure 
in reward -related regions, such as the amygdala, mOFC, VS, and the insula. In contrast, neural 
activity in placebo -treated individuals at rest and in alcohol cue reactivity will not differ from pre - 
to post -treatment.  
Objective 2 : Examine the mec hanism underlying topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]’s ability to blunt alcohol cue 
reactivity and reduce heavy drinking days  
     Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize that there will be a direct relationship between RB in the VS 
and mOFC and its effects on alcohol cue reactivity. Althou gh overall effects are expected, 
reductions in heavy drinking days will correlate with topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]’s ability to modulate reward 
circuitry responses.  
Exploratory Objective : Examine the moderating effects of rs2832407 on topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]’s effects 
on brain and beha vioral responses  
     Exploratory hypothesis: C-allele homozygotes at this locus will show the most robust 
effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_052].

16.[ADDRESS_288103] will be consented to the main study and 
complete all procedures for the main study screening visit and be deemed eligible, before being 
consented to the sub -study and completing the sub -study scree ning visit.  
At the sub-study screening visit, subjects who otherwise meet inclusion/exclusion criteria for the 
MRI sub -study and express an interest in participating in the sub -study will undergo oral HIV 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237507] (TOP -G)  Page 64 
Version  18: February [ADDRESS_288104] results to 
provide to the doctor of his or her choice for the follow -up visit. 
 
If the individual satisfies  study  inclusion/exclusion criteria and shows continued interest in 
participating in the sub-study, an appointment will be made for the Laboratory/MRI Scanning 
Session 1. This visit can be scheduled in conjunct ion with the subjects’ main study baseline visit  
or separately depending on the subject’s availability and MRI scan times .  This will help to 
ensure that the subject completes the screening visit and the MRI visit prior to  beginning the 
study medication  (i.e. before or at the ba seline visit) . The initial scre ening process will be 
described  and the individual will also be informed that s/he must be available for at least one 
more scan visit to be scheduled after the completion of  6 weeks of study medication  (to achieve 
a maximal dosage of topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] 200 mg/day or placebo equivalent) .  The second scan will be 
scheduled before the 8 -week treatment visit (i.e., [ADDRESS_288105] do se of the study 
medication).  
16.4  Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
16.4.1  When and How to Withdraw S ubjects  
Subjects with severe psychological symptoms (e.g., suicidal thoughts), those who fail to adhere 
to protocol requirements, and those withdraw consent will be withdrawn from the study and if 
applicable, referred for appropriate clinical care. Suicida l risks will be assessed using the MINI 
Suicidality section (B) at each of the Main study visit s, and if rated equal to or greater than 9 
(i.e., clinically significant suicidal ideation), the physician will be consulted to decide the 
appropriate clinical m anagement. If a subject is found to be pregnant during screening or during 
study, she will immediately be withdrawn from the study, referred for obstetric evaluation, and 
advised to discontinue all drinking.  Subjects that withdraw from the Main study will be withdrawn 
from this sub-study.  
The PI, [CONTACT_237797], will determine whether a subject who experienc es a serious adverse event 
judged  to be related to the study drug will be withdrawn from the sub-study.  
16.4.2  Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdra wn Subjects  
We will make a strong effort (via phone calls and alternative contact [CONTACT_3031]) to obtain 
follow -up information on all subjects who are prematurely withdrawn from the project.  
 
Study Procedures  
There are [ADDRESS_288106]’s availability, the parts may be 
combined with visits for the Main Study. Thus, i t is possible that one,  two or all three  of the MRI 
study visits  (i.e., screening and the two MRI scan visits) will be combined with regular study 
visits.  
16.5  Screening and Informed Consent (approximate ly1.5 hours ) 
Upon arriving to the Informed Consent and Screening Visit, subjects will be asked to complete a 
breathalyzer test to ensure a breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) of 0.00 g%. Subjects will then 
unde rgo the informed consent process. Specifically, subjects will be provided a standard HIPAA 
form that contains privacy laws, and a study staff member will review the consent form with the 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237507] (TOP -G)  Page 65 
Version  18: February [ADDRESS_288107].  S/he is also reminded that the 
consent expresses willingness to participate but that the subsequent screening process will 
determine final eligibility. Further, s/he is reminded that participation is voluntary, and at any 
time, s/he ma y withdraw from the study.  
Following consent, subjects will watch an fMRI video that simulates the experience of 
undergoing an MRI  and meet with study staff to complete study assessments.  They  will also be 
asked to complete an MRI safety sheet.  Baseline laboratory measures include: 1) urine drug 
screen  (to determine the presence of psychoactive drugs) ; 2) electrocardiogram; 3) oral swab 
rapid HIV test  (If the test is positive, study staff will draw a tablespoon of blood to conduct a 
confirmatory HIV blood  test); and 4) for all females : a urine pregnancy test .  In cases where 
blood samples are drawn and potential lab errors or abnormal findings occur, subjects will be 
asked to provide an additional blood sample to repeat the test(s).  
Measures obtained  (in addition to those obtained routinely for the Main Study ): 
 a. Menstrual Cycle Questionnaire (MCQ)  is a questionnaire administered by [CONTACT_237775], 
menstrual cycle length, and  premenstrual symptoms (PMS). This measure is acquired because 
hormone levels vary and cortical GABA levels decline from follicular to luteal phase of the 
menstrual cycle (Epperson, O'Malley et al. 2005 ), and these changes influence CBF (Krejza, 
Rudzinski et al. 2013 ) and behavior (Silveri, Sneider et al. 2013 ). Thus, this questionnaire (and 
progesterone/estrogen levels) will help us determine if females are pre -, peri - or post -
menopau sal. 
 b. Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) (Wechsler 1999 ) is a brief an d 
reliable measure of intelligence that provides an estimate of an individual’s IQ scores. We will 
use the two -subtest form (vocabulary and matrix reasoning) that offers an estimate of an  
individual’s cognitive functioning. Individuals with an intelligence  quotient of ≤ [ADDRESS_288108] being formally included in the study. 
Subjects will be called within 5 days  of the screening visit to be informed of their eligibility  for the 
sub-study . Eligible subjects will be booked for the Laboratory/MRI Scanning visit either before or 
on the day o f the Main Study baseline visit based on their and the MRI scanner ’s availability. 
Subjects must complete MRI  Scanning Visit 1 before starting to take the study medication.      
c. CogState computerized battery  is a 20-minute assessment of the cognitive effects 
of changes in drinking behavior and of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237644].  A practice session of the 
CogState will be administered at t he Screening and Informed Consent visit. Subsequent 
sessions of the CogState will be administered at the Laboratory/MRI session 1 and 2 visits. It 
consists of:  
 Detection Task (Psychomotor Speed) [2 minutes].  For this test, subjects must press a 
response k ey as soon as they detect an event. The software measures the response 
time to detect each event.  
 Identification Task  (Attention) [3 minutes].  In this task an event occurs in the center of 
the computer screen and the subject must decide whether the event meets a predefined 
and unchanging criterion.  The software measures the speed and accuracy of each 
response.

This material is the  property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_30292]   One Card Learning Task  (Visual Learning) [5 minutes].  In this task a pre -determined set 
of six cards is shown repeatedly four times. Each time the  set of six cards is presented 
the six cards are intermixed with eight distracter stimuli. Each distracter stimulus is 
shown only once in a task. Each time subjects see a stimulus presented in the center of 
the computer monitor they must decide whether the y have seen this card in the task 
before. The software measures the speed and accuracy of each response.  
 One Back Memory Task (Working Memory) [1 minute]:   On this task the subject is 
shown a single stimulus in the centre of the computer screen (a card tur ns face up). 
They must decide whether the current card matches the card they had seen on the 
immediately previous trial. The software measures the speed and accuracy of each 
response.  
 Shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96063]  (Verbal Learning and Memory) [5 minutes]: The test ad ministrator 
reads the subject a brief list of words at the rate of one word every [ADDRESS_288109] again. The total 
number of words recalled at initial recall and delayed recall are the outcome scores for 
this task.  
 Groton Maze Learning Test  (GMLT) (Reasoning a nd Problem Solving) [5 minutes]:   The 
task begins with a chase task to familiarize the subject with the task context. The subject 
is shown a 10 x 10 grid of tiles on a computer touch screen and is instructed to “chase” a 
moving tile around the grid. This i s followed by [CONTACT_237776], where they must 
chase the target for [ADDRESS_288110] is required to adhere to two rules: no diagonal moves or 
touching the same tile twice in succession and no moving backwards along the pathway. 
The subject learns the [ADDRESS_288111] 
been completed.  The software measures the total number of errors.  
 
16.6 Laboratory/MRI Scanning Visit 1 (approximately 3 hours)  
Upon arriving to the Laboratory/MR I Scanning visit , subjects will be asked to complete a 
breathalyzer test to ensure a breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) of 0.00 g%.  
 Baseline laboratory measures include:  
o 1) urine drug screen  (to determine the presence of psychoactive drugs);  
o 2) in all females : a urine pregnancy test and an additional blood sample for 
biochemical measurement of progesterone and estradiol levels to determine their 
menstrual cycle phase. A total of approximately 1 tablespoon of blood will be 
taken .

Measures obtained  (in addition to those obtained routinely for the Main Study ): 
a. CogState Computeriz ed Battery: Described above.  
b. Cognitive Bias Computer Tasks:  Individuals with emotional or dependence 
disorders exhibit biased attention toward stimuli associated with their disorder . This bias 
appears to diminish following successful treatment. Several tasks will be administered: the dot -
probe attention task, the primed attention task, the implicit association task, and a go/nogo 
inhibition task. Generally, subjects will be told that the purpose of the task is to see how quickly 
and accurately they can d etect targets presented on a display terminal.  During the tasks, the 
subject will be seated in front of an eye level computer screen. Alcohol, nonalcohol, pleasant 
and unpleasant pi[INVESTIGATOR_237645]. Subjects will be given specific 
instructions for each task and will be asked to respond appropriately by [CONTACT_7326] a button.  
 c. Within Session Rating Scale (WSRS):  This scale is used to assess a person’s 
desire to consume alcohol and their thoughts about the audio/visual images  viewed dur ing the 
scanning session.  
 
Prior to the scan session, subjects will complete the CIWA -Ar and the AUQ to assess 
withdrawal symptoms and alcohol craving. Study staff will walk or take a taxi with the subject to 
the 3.[ADDRESS_288113] on neural responses to 
cues. During the scanning session, subjects will be asked to lie still with their eyes open for a 5 
minute r esting baseline scan, followed by [CONTACT_1192] 10 -minute audio -visual clips consisting of either 
alcohol -related cues: individuals differing in race, age and sex who are drinking alcohol and 
using explicit language designed to induce appetitive desire for alcohol; or non -alcohol -related 
cues that are similar in content, but individuals relate interesting short stories that do not portray 
alcohol consumption or alcohol reminders. Subjects will also be asked their level of alcohol 
craving (on a scale from 0 -10) before  and after each audio -video clip.  
 
MRI scanning will be conducted on a Siemens 3.0 Tesla whole -body scanner (Siemens AG, 
Erlangen, [LOCATION_013]), using a standard Transmit/Receive head coil. A [ADDRESS_288114] localizer scan (sagit tal, axial and coronal) is acquired with FOV = 280 mm, TR/TE = 
20/5ms, 192x144 matrix, and slice thickness 5mm. Acquisition parameters for the 3D High -
Resolution MPRAGE structural in the axial plane are: FOV = 250 mm, TR/TE = 1620/3ms, 
192x256 matrix, slic e thickness 1 mm. The CASL technique will be used to acquire images 
during functional MRI (RB and SC exposure).  Interleaved images with and without labeling will 
be acquired using a gradient echo echo -planar imaging sequence. A delay of [ADDRESS_288115]. 
Acquisition parameters are: FOV=22cm, matrix=64x64, TR/TE = 3000/17ms, flip angle=90°. 
Fourteen slices (8mm thickness with 1.5mm gap) will be acquired from infer ior to superior in a 
sequential order. Each cue CASL scan with 200 acquisitions will be 10 minutes in length. The 
RB CASL scan will be 5 minutes with 100 acquisitions.

17  Sub-Study Statistical Plan  
17.1  Sample Size Determination  
The current sample size is based on our previous research examining drug cue reactivity using 
audio-visual videos both on - and off -magnet through computerized tasks and during fMRI 
scanning.  
17.2  Statistical Methods  
17.2.1  Imaging Data Processing  
Prior to performing analyses, brain data are examined for gross movement and full image 
acquisition. A Statistical Parametric Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (SPM) -based ASL data processing toolbox is used 
for data analyses. ASL image pairs are realigned to the mean of all control images and spatially 
smoothed with a 3D isotropic Gaussian kernel with full width at half maximum of 10mm. CBF 
image series are generated using a simplified two -compartment model with the sinc 
interpolation method for CBF calculations. The mean control image of each subject’s data is co -
registered to a high -resolution 3D T1 structural image using the mutu al information based co -
registration algorithm provided by [CONTACT_237777]8. The same co -registration parameters are used to co -
register the CBF maps to the structural image. The structural image is then spatially normalized 
to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI ) standard brain. The same parameters are used to 
normalize the CBF images to the MNI standard space. Each subject’s normalized mean control 
images are segmented using SPM8. The segmented gray matter masks are averaged and the 
overlap of subject’s gray mat ter is extracted. This final mask is used for calculating global CBF 
for each session.  
17.2.2  Imaging Data Analyses  
Global CBF time course will be included in the model as a covariate to examine the effects of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_237646]. No temporal smoot hing will be applied. Contrasts between 
conditions (alcohol cue vs non -alcohol cue; scan 1 vs scan 2) will be defined in the general 
linear model to assess the voxel by [CONTACT_237778]. Using the corresponding parametric 
maps of this contrast (  maps) , random effects analysis will be employed to test for a significant 
main effect of condition with a statistical parametric map of the T statistic at each voxel for 
population inference for each session for the placebo and topi[INVESTIGATOR_237647] (second -level 
analysis). A 2x2 factorial design matrix will be used to assess the effects of the pharmacological 
manipulation by [CONTACT_237779] (topi[INVESTIGATOR_237648]) and condition (scan 1 vs scan 2) as 
the two factors.  An associated contrast will be defined in th is model to examine administration 
effects. This two -stage analysis is theoretically equivalent to a [ADDRESS_288118] analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) . Simple regression analyses will be conducted on CBF with the change in craving 
scores [post -alcohol cue minus pre -alcoh ol cue craving scores, number of heavy drinking days 
during the past 30 days, and age] as covariates of interest to test for prognostic brain/behavioral 
correlations. For the exploratory aim, subjects will be grouped by [CONTACT_7631] (CC vs A -allele 
carrier) to  examine the moderating effects  of rs2832407 in GRIK1  on topi[INVESTIGATOR_237649].  We will limit this analysis to European

17.2.3  Behavioral Analyses  
Statistical significance tests use an alpha of .05 unless otherwise noted.  Continuous 
demographic variables (e.g., age, education, quantity/frequency of alcohol us e) are checked for 
normality, transformed if necessary, and summarized by [CONTACT_237781], standard deviations 
and ranges. Scores on each factor will be included as covariates of interest with respect to 
perfusion fMRI data and genetic variance. Analysis  of variance will be used to assess 
demographic differences across groups. Nominal demographic variables (e.g., race, sex, 
genotype) are summarized by [CONTACT_237782]. Demographic (age, years edu cation, monthly income) and clinical 
(depression, anxiety) will also be summarized.

18  Confidentiality  
 
A Certificate  of Confidentiality from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 
(NIAAA) that is separate from the one for the main study will be obtain ed for the sub -study 
described in this protoc ol. As per the NIAAA’s website: Confidentiality Certificates are issued by 
[CONTACT_237783] 301 (d) of the Public Health Service U.S.C. Section 241 (d) to 
afford special privacy protection to subjects enrolled in biomedical, behavioral, c linical, or other 
research within NIH mission areas. A Certificate helps the researcher avoid compelled 
'involuntary disclosure' (e.g. , subpoenas) of identifying information about a research subject. It 
does not prevent voluntary disclosures such as disclo sure to protect the subject or others from 
serious harm, as in cases of child abuse. Also, a researcher may not rely on a Certificate to 
withhold data if the subject consents to the disclosure. When a researcher obtains a Certificate 
of Confidentiality, th e subjects must be told about the protections afforded by [CONTACT_237757], 
and any exceptions to that protection. This information is usually included in an 'informed 
consent'.

With this Certificate, we cannot be forced (for example by [CONTACT_193689]) to disclose 
information that may identify you in any federal, state, local, civil, criminal, legislative, 
administrative, or other proceedings. The researchers will us e the Certificate to resist any 
demands for information that would identify you, except to prevent serious harm to you or 
others, and as explained below.  
You should understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you, or a member of 
your family, from voluntarily releasing information about yourself, or your involvement in this 
study.  
If an insurer or employer learns about your participation, and obtains your consent to receive 
research information, then we may not use the Certificate of Confidentiality to withhold this 
information. This means that you and your family must also actively protect your own privacy.  
You should understand that we will in all cases, take the necessary action, including reporting to 
authorities, to prevent serio us harm to yourself, children, or others (for example, in the case of

PRIVACY STATEMENT  
 
ClinCard Program: Data Security & Privacy Statement  
Updated 14 January 2016  
 
Confidentiality of Protected Health Information (PHI)  
All clinical trial participant information  is stored securely. Greenphire does not sell, use or distribute 
clinical trial participant information for any purpose other than those needed to execute, service and 
maintain the ClinCard program (including ClinCard Direct Deposit and Travel Reimbursemen t methods).  
Greenphire protects the privacy of Electronic Protected Health Information (“EPHI”), disclosed or provided 
to us in compliance with the Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health 
Information at 45 CFR Sections 160 and  164 (the “Security Rules”). Towards that end, Greenphire has 
implemented administrative, physical, and technical safeguards (detailed below) that reasonably and 
appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI; ensures that a ny agent or 
subcontractor to whom we provide EPHI agrees to implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards to 
protect it; and will report any Security Incident involving EPHI of which it becomes aware within five (5) 
days of learning of the Security Incid ent.  
 
Data Information Security  
As a matter of policy and commitment to clients and clinical trial participants, Greenphire takes great 
strides to protect all information relating to cardholders. Greenphire has deliberately designed its 
payments and comm unication platform including all of Greenphire’s externally facing web toolsto actively 
protect all data transfers and data stored with Greenphire’s infrastructure:  
 
Database and Encryption – All passwords within our database are protected using the one -way 
SHA1 algorithm to encrypt passwords, which are then encrypted by [CONTACT_71346] -way MD5 algorithm. Where

Version  18: February 19 , 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the  property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_237785], Greenphire’s platform makes use of encryption using the [ADDRESS_288120] (AES or otherwise known as Rijndael), which is one o f the most popular algorithms used in 
symmetric key cryptography. AES is approved by [CONTACT_237786] (NSA) for top 
secret information.  
 
Web Tools  – All of Greenphire’s web tools that are involved in transferring data between an end -
user's web browser and Greenphire’s platform (and vice versa) are secured by 256 bit Secured Socket 
Layer (SSL) with TLS 1.[ADDRESS_288121].com web 
tool. In addition, all user activities in the Greenphire Platform are auditable.  
 
Financial Data Transfer  - Communications between the Greenphire platform and financial 
networks are executed via Web Service  (API) or sFTP transport.  
 
Physical Protection  – Greenphire houses its internal database on servers that are located in a 
highly secure, off -site facility. Access to the physical servers at the facility is limited to Network Operations 
Center (NOC) Enginee rs and Technicians. The facility is secured with a bio -metric security system that 
can track access to the facility and is monitored by [CONTACT_237787], includes multiple 
suppliers for network connectivity and redundant power supplies i ncluding on -site power generation in the 
event of emergency.  
 
Authorized Access  – Greenphire restricts access to sensitive data to only a limited number of 
essential internal personnel. Authorized individuals are only permitted to access data if it is req uired to 
service our client, their authorized users or the clinical trial participant. The number of authorized 
individuals remains limited to protect against internal threats to the security of sensitive data.  
  
Proactive Design  - Greenphire’s internal te chnology platform has been intentionally designed to 
exclude the requirement of certain sensitive information that other similar companies require to be stored 
in their systems, such as PIN numbers. If new types of sensitive data must be introduced and sto red, per 
the design of a specific protocol, Greenphire will protect the data using the encryption methods described 
previously.  
 
Customer Service  - Greenphire provides all of its cardholders with 24/7/365 customer service. 
Customer service is handled by b oth an automated IVR system and a call center where live customer 
service representatives may provide financial assistance to cardholders. Customer service functionality is 
intentionally kept separate from implementation and client support and, consequentl y, no information is 
shared with customer service representatives related to the protocol, sponsor, structure of the trial, 
medical indication or other potentially sensitive information.  
 
Quality Control Process  - Greenphire’s Quality Control (QC) Departm ent performs system 
testing in an isolated environment to test and ensure that the software is functioning properly. Each new 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_237650]. In addition, QC conducts integration and regression 
testing before new c ode is approved for movement into production. When a change to the system 
necessitates a change to the database, the required changes and process to make the changes are 
documented and tested prior to being performed on production. No code is pushed to pro duction until it 
has passed QC testing. Data used in QC is test data and does not include data that is, or ever was, 
production data.  
 
Safe Harbor  
Greenphire has voluntarily obligated itself to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Commerce by

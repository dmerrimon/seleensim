21PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS
PRODUCT: [COMPANY_004]525762
PROTOCOL TITLE :A phase I/II open- label, dose escalation study  to investigate 
the safet y, pharmacokinetics, pharmacod ynamics and clinical ac tivity of [COMPANY_004]525762 
in subjects with relapsed, refractory  hematologic malignancies
PROTOCOL NO.: BET116183
U.S. IND NO.:   IND119332
EudraCT NO: 2013-000445 -39
CLINICAL PHASE:   I/II
STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION:  This study  is divided into 2 parts: Part [ADDRESS_529799] the recommended Part 2 dose (RP2D) 
based on the safet y, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles observed after 
oral administration of [COMPANY_004]525762.  Eligible subjects with select relapsed refractory  
hematolo gical malignancies (acute m yeloid leukemia [AML ], non -Hodgkin’s 
Lym phoma [NHL ]and multiple my eloma [MM]), will be enrolled in once daily  
(QD) cohorts until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is established .Subjects may  
continue treatment in the study  until d isease progression, unacceptable toxicity , or 
withdrawal of consent.  Part 2 will explore clinical activity  at the MTD or RP2D; 
separate expansion cohorts will be planned for m yeloid malignancies (high -risk 
myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS] or acute my eloid leukemia [AML ] that has 
evolved from an antecedent MDS, hereafter referred as the “m yeloid cohort”), and 
cutaneous T -cell ly mphomas (my cosis fungoides [MF] , Sézary  syndrome [SS], 
primary  cutaneous anaplastic large cell ly mphoma [pcAL CL], and large cell 
transformation of underly ing MF/SS; hereafter referred as the “ cutaneous T cell 
lymphoma [CTCL ]cohort”).
STUDY RATIONALE: Current data from [COMPANY_004]525762 preclinical development 
indicate a potential to inhibit the BET family of bromodomain (BRD) proteins and 
that this inhibition may  have clinical utility  in the treatment of various tumors, 
including hematological malignancies. Relapsed and/or refractory  hematological 
malignancies such as MDS, AML , NHL, and MM have an overall poor outlook. This 
is the first study  of this agent to be conducted in subjects with these relapsed and/o r 
refractory  hematological malignancies with few or no conventional treatment options 
that could be expected to provide an y lasting benefit. Dose escalation initially  
focused on AML, NHL ( without consideration to histologic subty pe), and MM, 
based on preclinical data.  Emerging clinical data demonstrated delay ed response in 
AML  subjects, many  of whom had evidence of antecedent MDS .  In the NHL cohort,
more robust clinical efficacy  was obser ved in subjects with CTCL compared to other 
NHL subty pes.  As a result of these observations, dose expansion (Part 2) was 
modified to evaluate MDS and CTCL  instead of AML  and unselected NHL, 
respectivel y. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

10% response rate suggesting no activity in subjects with MDS/AML.  This will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_420222] P0 ≤0.10 versus the alternative that 
P1≥0.30, assuming the maximum response rate for an ineffective drug is 0.10 and the 
minimum response rate for an effective drug is 0.30.
CTCL :A response rate, lasting more than 4 months, of 40% relative to a 20% res ponse 
rate suggesting no activity in subjects with CTCL .  This will be conducted by [CONTACT_420223] P0 ≤0.20 versus the alternative that P1 ≥0.40, assuming the maximum 
response rate for an ineffective drug is 0. 20 and the minimum response ra te for an 
effective drug is 0. 40.

321. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background
Bromodomains (BRDs) are small protein domains found in a variet y of proteins that 
recognize and bind to acety lated histone tails.  This binding affects chromatin structure 
and facilitates the localisation of transcriptional comple xes to specific genes, thereb y 
regulating epi[INVESTIGATOR_420082] (mRNA) elongation.  The BRD and extra -terminal (BET) 
family  of BRD proteins includes the BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT [testes] proteins.
The investigational agent [COMPANY_004]525762 is a potent inhibitor of the BET family of proteins 
and prevents the binding required for macromolecular complex assembly  and the 
subsequent transcriptional response [ Nicodeme , 2010].
[COMPANY_004]525762 inhibits growth in a broad spectrum of human hematological cancer cell 
lines and solid cancer cell lines.  I n cell line sensitivity  studies, [COMPANY_004]525762 consistently  
exhibits broad anti -proliferative activity  and induces cy totoxicity  in the majority  of these 
tumour derived cell lines including Acute My eloid L eukemia (AML), Chronic My eloid 
Leukemia (CML), Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), B -Cell Leukemia (BCL), 
Multiple My eloma (MM), and non- Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL).  [COMPANY_004]52576 2 is orally  
active in vivo in both solid and haematological xenograft tumour models of disease, and 
exhibits tumour growth inhibition and a significant survival advantage compared to 
vehicle treated animals in a MM mouse model [[COMPANY_004]525762 IB, GlaxoSmithKlin e 
Document Number 2011N113741_06]. 
Recent published data study ing another BET inhibitor [ Dawson , 2011] have also shown 
therapeutic promise in pre -clinical models of hematologic malignanci es and further 
support extending clinical evaluation of this novel therapeutic agent in a broad spectrum 
of hematological malignancies.
Parallel to study  BET116183, [COMPANY_004]525762 is being investigated in solid tumors 
(GlaxoSmithKline [[COMPANY_004]] Study  BET115521, NCT# [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])
1.2. Stud y Population Rationale
Myelodysplastic s yndromes ( MDS )and AML are related neoplasms of my eloid cells 
characterized b y an excess of immature myeloblasts in the bone marrow, as well as 
ineffective hematopoiesis leading to peripheral cytopenias.  MDS and AML exist along a 
spectrum defined b y the percentage of marrow blasts, with > 20% delineating the 
boundary  between the two diseases.  While AML  may  arise de novo, it may  also evolve 
from an antecedent my elody splasia or my eloproliferative s yndrome.  Both AML  and 
MDS are increasingl y defined by [CONTACT_420228], with cytogenetic abnormalities 
and mutations in genes involved in RNA splicing and epi[INVESTIGATOR_420083] y 
observed in MDS as well as AML that transformed from MDS.  T he only  approved 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_420084] 5 -azacitidine and decitabine; these 
agents are frequentl y used in patients with AML who are not suitable candidates for 
aggressive induction chemotherap y (e.g., as a consequence of advanced age or other  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

33comorbidity ).  To date, there are no second- line agents for subjects who did not respond 
to or who have progressed despi[INVESTIGATOR_420085], and overall survival 
for patients who have failed prior therap y is typi[INVESTIGATOR_420086] ( Prebet , 2011; 
Sekeres , 2014; Jabbour , 2010 ).
Non-Hodgkin’s l ymphomas are a famil y of more than sixty  malignancies arising from 
abnormal ly
mphoid, histiocy toid, or dendritic cell development ( Swerdlow , 2016 ).  They  
constitute a spectrum of diseases that may  be focal or sy stemic, indolent or aggressive, 
based on the underly ing cell of origin and other biological factors.  Therapy  is 
customized for each patient based on the disease subty pe and location and ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y 
involves radiation, sy stemic therapy , or both.  Recently , targeted s ystemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_420087].  However, NHL is 
an incurable disease for most patients and thus new approaches are necessary  in the face 
of inexorable progression and relapse.
Cutaneous T -cell l ymphomas are a famil y of NHLs characterized b y skin infiltration by  
[CONTACT_231237] 4 ( CD4)- positive T-cells.  These diseases are characterized b y 
erythroderma and/or tumor -phase growths on the skin, as well as intense pruritis as a 
consequence of upregulation of multiple pro -inflammatory  cytokines [ Ahern, 2012].  
Targeted s ystemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_420088], 
including those with limited- stage disease, both to control the disease itself as well as to 
reduce the overall symptomatic burden [Whittak er, 2016 ].  Recently , a role for BRD4 in 
the expression of ly mphoma -associated genes has been demonstrated ( Kohnken, 2017), 
making BET inhibition a rational approach for treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma
(CTCL ).
Multiple my eloma is a neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells.  In almost all cases, 
myeloma is incurable; though novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_420089] a half, 
most patients with multiple my eloma will die from their disease.   Thus, new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_420090] .
Relapsed and/or refractory hematological malignancies such as AML, MDS, NHL , and 
MM have an overall poor outlook.  These subjects are appropriate for clinical trials with 
new agents such as the BET inhibitor [COMPANY_004]525762. Preclinical studies have shown that 
small molecule based inhibition of BET protein binding to chromatin downregulates 
oncogene expression (e.g., down regulation of MYC oncogene expression and its 
downstream transcriptional functions) in several hematologi cal cancer cell lines.  This 
down regulation results in significant anti- tumour activity  both in vitro and in animal 
models of disease [ Delmore , 2011; Mertz , 2011].  Down -regulat ion of c -Myc protein 
expression has been reported upon exposure to [COMPANY_004]525762 in MM MM1S cells 
[Delmore , 2011], Burkitt’s Ly mphoma Raji cells and L P-1 m yeloma cells [ Mertz , 2011].  
Consistent with the published literature, [COMPANY_004]525762 inhibits proliferation and induces a 
cytotoxic response in cell lines across a wide range of hematological tumour ty pes

Number 2011N113741_06].
1.3. Dose Rationale
1.3.1. QD Dose Cohort
[IP_ADDRESS]. Starting Dose Calculations
The proposed starting dose for this clinical study  in subjects with hematologic 
malignancies is 5 mg once daily  (QD) based on the following, assuming a 70 kg adult 
with a body  surface area of 1.7 m2.  The dose of 5 mg dail y was based on preclinical 
considerations described Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 , preliminary  human pharmacokinetics (PK; 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ), clinical consideration including the aggressive nature of the relapsed 
and/or refractory  tumor (Section [IP_ADDRESS].3), and the desire to minimise sub -therapeutic 
exposures. This starting dose is different from the ongoing solid tumor st udy ([COMPANY_004] Study  
BET115521, NCT# [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in which the starting dose was 2 mg daily  (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 ).  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Preclinical Considerations
The following approaches have been considered to establish the starting dose for 
[COMPANY_004]525762:
1.One tenth of the rat STD (Severel y Toxic Dose) 10 as per International Conference 
on Harmonization (I CH) S9 guidance (based on dose):
a.Based on the observed morbidity  levels in the 30 mg/kg dose group following 1 
month of dosing, the Ra t STD10 was defined as 30 mg/kg.  One tenth of the rat 
STD10 as per the ICH S9 guidance is 18 mg/m2(this dose is also not severely  
toxic to dogs) which results in a starting human dose of 30 mg daily .
b.Assuming that 30 mg/kg may  not be tolerated for dosing periods greater than 1 
month without significant morbidity , a conservative Rat STD10 was defined as 10 
mg/kg.  One tenth of the rat STD10 is 6 mg/m2(this dose is also not severely 
toxic to dogs) which results in a starting human dose of 10.[ADDRESS_529825] Non Severely Toxic Dose (HNSTD) as per ICH S9 
guidance (based on dose):
a.Based on tolerability , the HNSTD was defined as 1 mg/kg in the dog.  One sixth 
of the dog HNSTD is 3.33 mg/m2 which translates to a starting dose in man of 
5.7mg.
b. Based on feedback from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), QTc 
prolongation was taken into consideration when defining the HNSTD.  The 
revised HNSTD was defined as 0.3 mg/kg in the dog.  One sixth of the dog 
HNSTD is 1 mg/m2, which translates to a starting dose in man of 1.7 mg that was 
rounded to 2 mg, based on tablet strength. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

BET116183
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Human Pharmacokinetics and Equivalent Exposure for NOEL for QTc 
prolongation
Average plasma s ystemic exposure in dogs at the repeat dose that resulted in QTc 
prolongation No observable effect level (NOEL) (0.3 mg/kg) was as follows: Area under 
concentration -time curve (AUC) - 642 ng.hr/mL total and 167 ng.hr/mL  free; Maximum 
observed concentration (Cmax) -80 ng/mL  total and 20.8 ng/ml free (fraction unbound 
[Fu] in plasma is 26%).  Extrapolating the free AUC to humans, the dose required for 
parity  is given by  [CONTACT_50726] = AUC x Clearance (CL)/Fu, where Fu is fraction unbound in 
plasma in humans (18.6%).  The average clearance observed in the [ADDRESS_529826] subjects in 
BET115521 who rec eived 2 mg was 9.7 L/hr, a value similar to the value predicted from 
animal data using allometric scaling.  Using the above expression, the predicted starting 
dose would be 167 ng.hr/mL  x 9.70 (L /hr)/0.186 = 8.7 mg.
Based on the Cmax observed in the two subjects who received a single 2 mg dose of 
[COMPANY_004]525762, the predicted free drug Cmax is about 50.4 ng/mL  for a 8.7 mg dose.  This 
predicted free Cmax is higher than the observed free Cmax in dogs (27.8 ng/mL) at QTc 
NOEL. This does not impact the proposed sta rting dose using exposure at the NOEL for 
QTc prolongation as the preclinicall y observed QTc prolongation is not consistent with a 
direct hERG blockade (i.e., free Cmax levels).  Taking this into consideration, the human 
dose which matches the average free exposure that did not result in QTc prolongation 
(QTc NOEL) in the dog is 9 mg dail y.
PK information obtained up to January  2017is available in the I nvestigator’s Brochure 
Section 5.2. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Clinical Considerations
Relapsed and/or refractory hematologic malig nancies have an aggressive and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_420091] 3 
week for the Dose Limiting Toxicity  (DLT) assessment to be done.  Therefore there is a 
need to minimise the number of patients exp osed to sub-therapeutic doses without 
compromising safet y.  The 5 mg starting dose provides adequate safet y margins for 
toxicities that can be clinically  monitored and are largel y reversible (excluding testicular 
long-term effects on  male and female reproductive function, which is being evaluated), 
while minimizing the number of patients with aggressive hematologic cancers exposed to 
predicted sub- therapeutic doses. Moreover, the starting dose of 2 mg daily  in the solid 
tumor trial (BET115521) has been suc cessfull y cleared. Taking all the above into 
consideration and the extensive clinical monitoring for QT prolongation, a starting dose 
of 5 mg QD is planned.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Predicted therapeutic dose range
Cell lines of hematological origin were generally more sensitive than the cell lines of 
other solid tumor origins, namely  small cell lung cancer (SCL C) and Colorectal cancer 
(CRC) cells.  The more sensitive cell lines had growth I C50 (gI C50) values as low as 50 -
100 nM.  The potential therapeutic dose for [COMPANY_004]525762 in hu mans was derived using 
available preclinical PK, data from in vitro cell lines of hematological origin, and 
efficacy  data from OPM -2 multiple my eloma tumour xenograft studies.  Based on  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

predicted human effective daily  dose is likely  to be in the range of 25 to 100 mg 
assuming 50 to 100% oral bioavailability .
1.3.2. Dose escalation steps
Human PK predictions suggest that exc eeding the sy stemic exposure of the preclinical 
4week maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (1 mg/kg in dogs and 10 mg/kg in rats) may  be 
required to achieve ≥50% target inhibition in the majority  of subjects.  The start of the 
predicted therapeutic range in human s is at parity  with the 4 week MTD exposure range 
in preclinical species.  The toxicities observed at exposures greater than the preclinical 
MTD are amenable to clinical monitoring and are largel y reversible (excluding testicular 
effects).  A stringent saf ety monitoring and evaluation process will be implemented and 
therefore semi -semi -log (≤2-fold) dose escalation above the preclinical MTD, conditional 
on acceptable safet y and tolerability, is permitted until the clinical MTD is established. 
The MTD of GS K525762 may  be different for AML /MDS, NHL, and MM.  To fully  
evaluate this, each dose escalation step will be evaluated separatel y for the three disease 
types.  Parallel cohorts will commence upon termination of accelerated dose titration 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) and follow the 3 + 3 design described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
1.4. Rationale for Study  and Endpoints
Safety  and efficacy  (Response Rate) are being assessed to address the pri mary  objectives 
of the study .  The safety  assessments along with PK will be important for determining the 
MTD.  The pharmacod ynamic assessments will further support the recommended Phase 
II doses (RP2D) and expand the understanding regarding mechanism of a ction.
The BET116183 stud y has 2 parts.  Part 1 is a dose finding study , which will include 
subjects with hematologic malignancies to determine an MTD.  Part 2 is a cohort 
expansion, which will study  the RP2D of [COMPANY_004]525762 to determine preliminary  efficacy ,
safet y and tolerability in three separate cohorts of subjects with myeloid neoplasms 
(myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS] or MDS that has transformed to AML) , and CTCL .
Originall y, Part 2 of the study  was designed to evaluate preliminary  clinical efficacy  in 
relapsed or refractory  AML , MM, and NHL.  However, after an evaluation of data from 
the Part 1 AML cohort, the following observations prompted changes to the Part 2 
cohort; clinical responses were observed at doses of [ADDRESS_529827] subjects with AML  
discontinued [COMPANY_004]525762 earl y in the course of their treatment as a consequence of their 
underly ing AML or disease complications.  Responses tended to be delay ed (at the four 
week mark or later, with many requiring more than [ADDRESS_529828]).  Thus, most 
subjects were not remaining on stud y for long enough to achieve benefit.  In order to 
maximize time on -study , Part 2 was updated to enroll subjects with a more slowly -
progressing disease that maintained man y of the clinical characteristics of the AML 
response s that were observed in Part 1 (i.e., MDS and MDS that has transformed to AML 
with a low burden of disease). 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

38The original study  design included a dose expansion in non -Hodgkin’s l ymphoma, 
enrolling subjects regardless of histological subt ype.  Furthermore, this cohort enroll ed
subjects with double -and triple -hit ly mphoma (i.e., B -cell l ymphomas with 
rearrangement and/or overexpression of m yc and BCL2 and/or BCL 6) in an exploratory  
sub-cohort.  However, interim anal ysis of the Part 1 data demonstrated limit ed activity in 
both B -cell ly mphomas in general as well as double/triple hit ly mphomas.  Responses, 
including very  deep, durable responses, were achieved in subjects with CTCL and other 
T-cell l ymphomas of the skin.  Therefore, Part [ADDRESS_529829]

1.5. Benefit: Risk Assessment
The investigational agent [COMPANY_004]525762 is a potent inhibitor of the BET family of proteins 
that prevents BET bindin g to acet ylated histone tails required for macromolecular 
complex assembly  and the subsequent transcriptional response of many  oncogenes 
[Nicodeme , 2010].  [COMPANY_004]525762 inhibits growth in a broad spectrum of human 
hema tological and solid cancer cell lines.  I n cell line sensitivity  studies, [COMPANY_004]525762 
consistently  exhibits broad antiproliferative activity  and induces cy totoxicity  in the 
majority  of these tumor derived cell lines including AML, CML, ALL, NHL, and MM.
[COMPANY_004]5 [ZIP_CODE] is orally  active in vivo in both solid and hematological xenograft tumor 
models of disease, and exhibits tumor growth inhibition and a significant survival 
advantage compared to vehicle treated animals in a MM mouse model.  Recent published 
data stud ying BET inhibitors [ Dawson , 2011] have also shown therapeutic promise in 
pre-clinical animal models of hematologic malignancies.  Considering the overall poor 
outlook of patients with relapsed and/or refractory hemat ological malignancy  and the 
therapeutic promise of [COMPANY_004]525762, clinical evaluation of this novel therapeutic agent in 
a broad spectrum of hematological malignancies is justified.
1.5.1. Risk Assessment
Summaries of findings from both clinical and non-clinical stud ies conducted with 
[COMPANY_004]525762 can be found in the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) [GlaxoSmithKline 
Document Number 2011N113741_06].   Toxicology  studies performed in dogs, rats and 
mice suggest that the primary  toxicities of [COMPANY_004]5257 62 are gastrointestinal, 
cardiovascular, pancreatic, hematologic and reproductive (see the [COMPANY_004]525762 IB 
[GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2011N113741_06] ).  The following Section 
outlines the risk assessment and mitigation strat egy for this protocol. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

Drug Interactions [COMPANY_004]525762 is a substrate for CYP3A4 
enzymes, and for P -gp and breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP) transporters. 
[COMPANY_004]525762 clearance is virtually solely via 
CYP3A4.  There is evidence of potential auto -
induction after repeat dosing in clinical studies 
since reduction in parent exposures (~25% at 
lower doses to ≥60% at doses ≥60 mg, 
mainly in BET115521 study) have been 
observed.
There is low potential for [COMPANY_004]525762 to 
inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or to 
inhibit P -gp or BCRP based on in vitro data.  
[COMPANY_004]525762 was shown to be an inhibitor of 
organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 
(OATP1B1) and organic anion transporter 3 
(OAT3) in vitro.
[COMPANY_004]525762 was shown to be a moderate 
inducer of CYP3A4 in a human hepatocyte 
induction study .Use of concomitant medications, 
herbal medicines and fruit juices 
that are strong or moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers 
should be avoided during the 
course of the study where possible 
as they may respectively decrease 
or increase exposure to

Potent inhibitors of breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP) and P -
glycoprotein transporters, such as 
cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or 
ketoconazole, should be avoided.
Use of concomitant medications 
that are sensitive substrates of 
OATP1B1 and OAT3 should be 
done with caution.
Medications that hav e a narrow

treatment of various tumors, including hematological malignancies.  Taking into account

3.2. Discussion of Design
3.2.1. Part 1: Dose Escalation
In Part 1, an accelerate d dose titration will be employ ed with one subject per dose level 
until the first instance of a ≥ Grade 2 drug related non
-hematological toxicity , (except for  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

50a pre -specified Grade 3 non- serious non-hematological drug related adverse event that 
would allow continuation of accelerated dose escalation; Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). During 
accelerated dose titration, there will be a single cohort comprised of all eligible subjects; 
parallel cohorts will not be evaluated during this stage. 
Thereafter, subjects will be enrolled in a standard 3+3 design.  Separate dose escalation 
cohorts will be opened for subjects with AML, NHL , and MM.
In the accelerated dose escalation cohorts and the 3+3 dose escalation cohorts, the dose 
will be escalated based on all available data, including PK data and the safety profile of 
prior cohorts, as well as the recommended dose from Neuenschwander continual 
reassessment method (N -CRM) design [ Neuenschwander , 2009].  N -CRM design is a 
type of Bay esian adaptive dose escalation scheme.  The method is fully  adaptive and 
makes use of all the DLT information available at the time of each dose assignment.  The 
DLT information of all subjects enrolled in the tri al are used to update the dose- toxicity  
relationship and provide supportive information in addition to 3+3 design in the next 
escalation/de -escalation decision.
Dose escalation will continue until an MTD is determined or until a dose of 200 mg per 
day is reached.  After the MTD has been determined in Part 1 for each disease ty pe, then 
the Part 2 dose expansion cohorts will be opened for that disease t ype. 
Due to the potentially  different MTD in subjects with my eloid neoplasms, NHL, and MM 
(Section 1.3.2), each dose escalation step will be evaluated separately  for the three 
disease t ypes. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dose Escalation and Schedule
A staggered dosing schedule will be implemented to monitor for safet y including an y 
delay ed toxic ity.  This approach allows repeat dosing in a step -wise fashion to detect 
changes in safet y, such as cardiotoxicity .  Based on a low risk of drug accumulation and 
the aggressive nature of relapsed and/or refractory hematologic malignancies, a three 
week pe riod will be used for DLT monitoring and dose escalation decision making.  
Alternative dosing regimens and/or schedule may  be implemented based on emerging PK 
and safet y data and without requiring a protocol amendment.
Extensive monitoring for cardiac safe ty signals will be performed including 12 -lead ECG 
on the day s indicated in the Time and Events Table. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Accelerated Dose Escalation in Part [ADDRESS_529836] experiences ≥Grade 2 drug related non- hematological toxicity , or DL T (except 
for pre -specified Grade 3 non- serious non- hematological drug related adverse event, see 
Section 3.2.2 ) (Table 2 ).  Once this occurs, the accelerated dose escalation will terminate, 
and subjects will be enrolled in one of three disease- specific cohorts (AML, MM, or 
NHL) under a standard 3+3 des ign (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).   2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

[IP_ADDRESS]. 3 +3 Dose Escalation in Part 1
Due to the potentially  different MTDs in m yeloid neoplasms, MM, and NHL, dose 
escal ation will be evaluated in three separate cohorts divided by  [CONTACT_420234].  These 
cohorts will be evaluated in parallel with each other, and DLT/MTD determination will 
be made separately for each cohort.  
Upon termination of accelerated dose titration, two additional subjects with the final 
disease t ype will be enrolled, for a total of three subjects with that disease type at that 
dose level.  Three additional subjects with each of the two other disease subty pes will 
also be enrolled at that dose level, for a total of nine subjects at each dose level.
Subjects unable to receive at least 75% of scheduled doses for reasons other than toxicity  
(e.g., acute illness, disease progression) will not be evaluable for DLT purposes and will 
be replaced in the cohor t.
For each cohort, if no DLTs are observed in any of the 3 subjects, then dosing will 
proceed to the next higher dose level ( ≤2fold increase in dose).  Subjects within each 
cohort will be entered in a staggered approach with at least [ADDRESS_529840] 
to minimize the risk of inadvertentl y exceeding the MTD in multiple subjects.  Each 
disease cohort may initiate dosing independent of the other two (i.e., subjects with 
different diseases may  start therapy  <3day s apart, but subjects with the same di sease must 
be separated b y at least three days). Escalation to the next dose level will not increase 
greater than [ADDRESS_529841] been exceeded ( Table 3). 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

than current dose or expand a prior cohort up to [ADDRESS_529842] 1 dose level below MTD, to confirm if the MTD is appropriate 
for AML, MM and NHL subjects. Up to an additional 6 subjects may  be enrolled at any  
dose level below the MTD in order to obtain additional clinical specimens for 
pharmacod ynamic biomarkers to better understand the dose/exposure/ pharmacod ynamic
relationship.  Additional cohorts (with daily  exposure not exceeding MTD expos ure) may  
also be initiated to explore alternative dosing schedules to optimize the PK, safet y and 
tolerability  profile.  The enrolment of additional subjects as described could be in parallel 
with Part 2 enrolment.  Although DLT will not be based on the ad ditional subjects 
enrolled into the study  to further evaluate safet y, PK, to obtain tumor tissue for 
biomarkers, data from these additional subjects will be considered in defining final MTD 
and RP2D ( Figure 3). 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

53Figure 3 Dose Escalation Schema (Part 1)
[IP_ADDRESS]. Alteration of Schedule
Alterations may  be made to the schedule of administration and/or PK/pharmacod ynamic
sampling schedule based on the results of emerging PK and safet y data.
Schedules that incorporate a recovery  period may  be explored (e.g., 2 weeks on, 1 week 
off).  This approach will be considered if the safety  and PK data suggest that a 
therapeutic exposure cannot be achieved using the initial schedule without excessive 
toxicity .  The starting dose fo r the alternate schedule will be the highest completed dose 
level (at or below MTD) with the initial schedule.  Escalation can then proceed as 
described using 3 + [ADDRESS_529843] the new dosing 
schedule.
Subjects may  need to undergo dose modification(s) to manage toxicities.  A dose 
adjustment may  be made after consultation with the [COMPANY_004] medical monitor. The 
investigator should use clin ical judgment to determine whether the dosing scheduling 
may be contributing to any  potential toxicity  necessitating dose adjustment, and make the 
appropriate change after consultation with the [COMPANY_004] Medical Monitor. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

54In Part 2, subjects approved to alter the ir current dose level with either a dose reduction 
or dose escalation may  require additional limited PK sampling (pre -dose, 0.5, and 3 
hours) at the new dose level, after at least 7 day s at the adjusted dose level.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Intra -Subject Dose Escalation
Intra -subject dose escalations may  be considered on a case -by-case basis, provided that a 
higher dose level cohort (accelerated phase or 3+3 phase) has been cleared, and after 
review of all safet y data and approval b y a [COMPANY_004] Medical Monitor and discussion with the 
investigator.  The subject on a lower dose level may be increased up to the highest dose 
level cleared.  In this case, the subject may  begin daily  dosing at the higher dose level as 
it will have alread y been demonstrated to be tolerable and monitoring will be performed 
as described in the protocol.
Subjects approved for intra -subject dose escalation may  require additional limited PK 
sampling (pre -dose, 0.5, 3 and 6- 8 hours) at the higher dose, as determined by  [CONTACT_420235] , after at least 7 day s at the adjusted dose level . Additional safet y 
assessments may  be specified at the time of dose escalation or schedule modification 
based on the safet y profile in previous subjects at the higher dose level.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Toxicity  Leading to Termination of A ccelerated Titr ation
The following events will result in an end to accelerated dose escalation:
Any Grade 2 or higher adverse event (except drug related Grade [ADDRESS_529844] medical care within 48hrs, Grade 3 or higher 
electrol yte abnormalities unrelated to underly ing malignancy  and corrected in 48 hrs) 
that is considered related to the study  medication and which do not improve with 
standard medical care within 48hrs. Disease related events such as abnormalities in 
hematologic par ameters for acute leukemia will not be considered.
Grade 2 QTcF prolongation (confirmed on triplicate ECGs by  [CONTACT_274232]) 
Grade 2 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase (unless clearly  attributed to the 
underly ing disease).
Any grade adverse events that are considered in the judgment of the investigator and 
[COMPANY_004] Medical Monitor to be serious and related to the drug and requiring addition of 
additional subjects to better understand the toxicity.
3.2.2. Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)
An event will be considered a DLT if it occurs within the first 3 weeks of treatment and 
meets one of the following criteria unless it can be clearl y established that the event is 
unrelated to treatment.  As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , subjects unable to receive at least 
75% of scheduled doses for reasons other than toxicity  (e.g., acute illness, disease 
progression) will not be evaluable for DLT purposes and will be replaced in the cohort. 
Prolonged m yelosuppression, as follows:

55Grade 4 neutropenia persisting for ≥7 day s or febrile neutropenia not 
responding to treatment within 24h 
Grade 4 thrombocy topenia lasting more than 7 day  and not responding to 
transfusions, or Grade 3 thrombocy topenia associated with blee ding (>10mL) 
Drug -related Grade 3 or 4 non -hematologic toxicity  (including QTcF prolongation) 
as described in the National Cancer Institute -Common Terminology  Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) v4.0 [NCI, 2009 ] (excluding abnormalities of alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (see criteria below).  In 
addition, the DL T exceptions include: rash, diarrhea, fatigue, mucositis, nausea, and 
vomiting or new electroly te disturbance that do respond to standard medical care 
within 72 hours.  Electrolyte disturbances associated with underl ying malignancy  are 
excluded.
Drug -related Grade 2 non- hematological toxicity  (at any  time during treatment) that 
in the judgment of the investigator and [COMPANY_004] Medical Monitor is dose -limiting.
Grade 2 Troponin T elevation (central laboratory  >Upper Limit of Normal [UL N]), 
measured on two separate occasions within 48 hours in order to confirm elevation 
andwith other clinical signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory testsconsistent with
cardiac toxicity .  In the event a troponin T [central laboratory  assessment] is not 
performed or a laboratory error occurs, considerations for a DLT criterion will 
involve review of two separate local troponin (I or T) assay s done within 48 hours at 
a local investigator site.  Troponin I or T elevations greater than the upper limit of 
normal will be considered as a Grade 2 elevation).
Treatment delay  of 14 day s or greater due to unresolved drug -related toxicity  
(Treatment delay s due to underly ing malignancy  are excluded).
ALT 3xULN + bilirubin ≥2xUL N (>35% direct) or ALT between 3- 5xULN with 
bilirubin <2xUL N but with hepatitis sy mptoms or rash or ALT 5xULN.
3.2.3. Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 
Dose (RP2D)
The MTD will b e exceeded if 2 or more subjects in a cohort of up to 6 subjects 
experience a DLT.
The RP2D will be determined based on the MTD or biologicall y active dose (example: 
clinical response), the safety  profile, and available pharmacod ynamic data generated from 
all subjects in Part 1 for that disease t ype.  If necessary  alternate schedules can be 
explored to determine additional biologically  active doses even after a RP2D is defined.
3.2.4. Part 2: Disease Specific Expansion Cohorts
Up to 32 subjects with my elody splasti c syndrome and up to 37 subjects with CTCL (as 
defined in Section 4.2.1 ), may be enrolled in an expansion cohort at the RP2D.  These will 
be conducted to gather more safety data and to further assess anti -tumor activity .  
Subje cts in Part 2 will start with a continuous daily dosing schedule unless safet y or PK 
data necessitate a different dosing schedule.  The final dose and regimen for Part 2 will 
be decided upon completion of dose escalation in Part 1. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_529845] eva luation criteria (see Appendix 6 , Appendix 7 and Appendix 8 ).  Patient-
reported outcome questionaire , Skindex 29 (Appendix 11 ) will be used to gauge the 
effects of treatment with [COMPANY_004]525762 on the quality  of life and other subjective measures 
in subjects with CTCL .
For each cohort, the first interim analy sis will be conducted after at least 10 subjects 
become evaluable (have had at least one-post baseline disease assessment, have 
progressed or died, or have discontinued from study  treatment) in the MDS and CTCL
cohorts respectivel y.The number of subjects may  be increased up to a total of 32 for the 
MDS cohort and up to a total of 3 7for the CTCL cohort, depending on the results 
observed; a separate decision will be made for each disease cohort.  The decision rules, 
specify ing the number of subjects with a clinical response needed for continuing 
enrolment or, st oppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589] , are indicated in Figure 4and Figure 
5.  The 
methodology  is based on the predictive probability of success if enrolment continues to 
maximum number of subjects for MDS and CTCL .  Subjects enrolled in Part 1 with the 
same ty pe of disease as Part 2, and treated at the RP2D, will be included in the Part 2 
analysis.  These rules are intended as a guideline.  Actual decisions will depend on the 
totality  of the data.
For MDS and CTCL cohorts: when [ADDRESS_529846] interim anal ysis,a

Completion Criteria
[IP_ADDRESS]. Permanent Discontinuation from Study  Treatment
Subjects will receive study  treatment until disease progression, death or unacceptable 
adverse event, including meeting stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_420097] [ADDRESS_529870].   For subjects with CTCL , 
in cases where the definition of progressive disease (PD) or relapse is met but t he clinical 
impression is questionable, documentation for a period of at least [ADDRESS_529871] being removed prematurel y from the stud y.
In addition study  treatment will be permanentl y discontinued for an y of the following 
reasons:
Substantial deviation(s) from the protocol
request of the subject or prox y (withdrawal of consent by  [CONTACT_377092] )
investigator’s discretion
a dose delay  of >[ADDRESS_529872]
intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of study  treatment(s)
subject is lost to follow -up
study  is closed or terminated
The primary  reason study  treatment was permanently  discontinued must be documented 
in the subjec t’s medical records and electronic case report form (eCRF).  If a subject dies 
while on study , the cause of death should be recorded in the eCRF.
If the subject voluntaril y discontinues from treatment due to toxicity , ‘adverse event’ will 
be recorded as th e primary  reason for permanently discontinuation on the eCRF.
Once a subject has permanently  discontinued from study  treatment, the subject will not 
be allowed to be retreated.
All subjects who discontinue from stud y treatment will have safet y assessments at the 
time of discontinuation and during post stud y treatment follow -up as specified in the 
Section 5Time and Events Tables.
All subjects who permanently  discontinue study  treatment without disease progression
will be followed for progression according to the protocol schedule until: 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

partners of male subjects will also be collected until [ADDRESS_529874] dose of study  
drug.  Upon discontinuation, any  samples previously  collected for pharmacody namic
and/or translational research will be retained and tested as defined in the protocol, unless 
consent is specifically  withdrawn.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Subject Completion
In Part 1, a subject will b e considered to have completed the study  if:
they complete screening assessments, the 21- day DLT observation period, and the 
end-of-treatment follow -up visit,
they progress or die while receiving stud y treatment, or
are receiving ongoing study  treatment at the time of the Sponsor’s decision to 
close the study .
In Part 2, a subject will be considered to have completed the study  ifthe subject is 
followed until death or the end of stud y.
Subjects who have not died, and are no longer being followed for surviva l are considered 
to have discontinued the study .  A subject will be considered to have withdrawn from the 
study  if the subject has not died and is lost to follow -up, has withdrawn consent, or at the 
investigator’s discretion is no longer being followed.  The End of Study  eCRF should 
only be completed when a subject is no longer being followed.  The study  may  be 
considered completed for purposes of a final anal ysis when 70% of subjects enrolled in 
Part [ADDRESS_529875]’s medical condition whether or not [COMPANY_004] is providing

The performance status assessment is based on the ECOG scale [ Oken , 1982].
Grade Descriptions
6.3.3. Vital Signs
Vital sign measurements will include sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and temperature.  The vital signs will be measured after resting for at least 5 
minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] -recumbent position.  Pain will be assessed using a visual 
analog scale (see Appendix 1 2).
6.3.4. Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF )Evaluation
For all subjects, evaluation of cardiac output will be performed at screening and at 
assessment times as outlined in Section 5.  While ECHO is the preferred modality  of 
imaging, MUGA scans may  be accepted as an alternative.  Subjects should have the same 
assessment modality  performed at each time point listed in Section 5.  When possible, 
ECHOs /MUGAs should be evaluated and compared to baseline b y the same reader. 
All ECHO /MUGA data may  be transferred and reviewed by  [CONTACT_28997].
6.3.5. Electrocardiograms
ECGs will be performed using a standard 12 -lead ECG machine that automatically  
calculates the Heart Rate (HR) and measures PR, QRS, QT and QTcF intervals. I n Part 1, 
the investigator will review the ECG data manually , and should not rel y solely  on the  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_529904] 12- lead ECGs (Safety  ECGs) will be performed as part of the real- time 
assessment of subjects and may  not be included in the primary  QT anal ysis.  Safety  ECGs 
should be reviewed b y the investigator on an ongoing basis for safety purposes.  The 
dosing for each new week in the first cy cle should not begin until the safety ECG has 
been reviewed and no significant abnormalities have been detected.
If asubject meets the corrected QT (QTc) interval duration criteria below, study  
treatment(s) will be withheld.
QTc interva l ≥530 msec OR interval increase from baseline 60 msec: 
Investigational product (IP) will be discontinued unless the benefits of 
therap y outweigh the risk of rechallenge in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], 
the [COMPANY_004] Medical Monitor, as well as the [COMPANY_004] medic al governance. In this 
situation, rechallenge may be permitted (see Section 7.7for rechallenge 
guidelines).
NOTE: QT interval duration criteria should be based on the average QTc value of 
triplicate electrocard iograms (ECGs) to include manual over -read. For example, if an 
ECG demonstrates a prolonged QT interval, obtain 2 additional ECGs over a brief period 
(e.g., within approximately  10 minutes of the abnormal ECG, if possible, and 
approximately  10 minutes apart from each other), and then use the averaged QTc values 
of the [ADDRESS_529905] study  treatment 
discontinued.
The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia’s formula 
(QTcF). 
For eligibili ty and withdrawal, QTcF will be used for all subjects. 
For purposes of data analy sis, QTcF will be used.
Baseline results are defined by [CONTACT_420241]. 
Abnormal ECGs should be evaluated manuall y prior to final decision making. ECG data 
may be transferred and reviewed by  [CONTACT_165540].
6.3.6. Clinical Laboratory  Assessments
All protocol required safety  laboratory  assessments, as defined in Section 5, are 
performed at the in stitution’s local laboratory .  All non -safet y assessments (e.g., PK 
samples, biopsy , translational samples) will be assessed by  a central laboratory .  Some 
laboratory  assessments can vary  throughout the day  such as testosterone.  It is 
recommended but not mandated that laboratory  assessments are collected at 
approximately  the same time on each clinic day .  If abnormal testosterone levels are 
observed, repeat measurements should occur at the approximate baseline timing to ensure 
this is a trend and not a sin gle outl ying event. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

6.4.1. Disease A ssessment
Response will be assessed as outlined in the Section 5Time and Events Table 7Table b y 
the investigator using the appropriate criteria for MM, ly mphoma , CTCL ,AML , and 
MDS, as noted in Appendix 6 , Appendix 7 Appendix 8 , Appendix 9, and Appendix 10,
respectivel y.  
Subjects enrolled in Part 1 at RP2D and Part 2 are to be followed until death for 
assessment of overall survival (OS).
6.5. Pharmacokinetics
6.5.1. Blood Sample Collection
Blood s amples to enable quantification of [COMPANY_004]525762 , and relevant metabolites, as 
applicable, in plasma will be collected at the time points indicated in the Section 5 Time 
and Events Tables. The actual date and time o f each blood sample collection will be 
recorded.  The timing of PK samples may be altered and/or PK samples may  be obtained 
at additional time points to ensure thorough PK monitoring.
6.5.2. Plasma Sample A nalysis
Plasma analy sis will be performed under the manag ement of Worldwide Bioanal ysis, 
Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics (DMPK), GlaxoSmithKline.  Concentrations of 
[COMPANY_004]525762 will be determined in plasma samples using the currentl y approved 
analytical methodology .  In addition, selected metabolites of [COMPANY_004]525762 may  also be 
quantified using approved anal ytical methodology. Raw data will be stored in the GL P 
Archives, GlaxoSmithKline.
In addition, plasma may  be anal yzed qualitativel y for other circulating compound -related 
material and the results will be repor ted under a separate DMPK protocol.
6.5.3. Activity
Subjects will abstain from strenuous exercise for 48 hours prior to each blood collection 
for clinical laboratory  tests. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_529907]  to treat 
patients with a BET inhibitor. Specificall y, the evaluation of responders, responders at 
relapse, and non -responders for gene mutati on status and/or pathway  activation may  lead 
to the discovery  of potential new diagnostic markers or novel combinations. Similarly , 
pre-and post -dose tumor specimens will be evaluated for markers of target engagement, 
tumor response, and/or evaluated for changes in gene expression; thus supporting 
identification of a biologically  effective dose and furthering our mechanistic 
understanding of BET inhibition in these settings. I n certain settings such as my eloid 
malignancies, samples may  be used to evaluate changes in leukemic stem cell 
populations or to generate PDX models.
The biopsies will be assessed for transcripts or proteins that reflect BET target 
engagement and/or tumor biology . Biopsies may  also be assessed for deoxy ribonucleic 
acid (DNA), RNA or pr oteins which may  be potential predictors of sensitivity  or 
resistance to BET inhibition based on emerging data.
During the accelerated dose escalation phase (Part 1), fresh pre -and post -dose biopsy  
collections will be optional until the standard 3+3 desig n is implemented.  During the 3+[ADDRESS_529908] -treatment biopsies are 
mandatory . For subjects in Part 1 and 2, if tumor tissue is not accessible, discussion with 
the [COMPANY_004] medical monitor is required. 
6.6.1. Tum or Specific Tissue Collection
The tissue collection and pharmacod ynamic tests for Part 1 are disease specific and 
outlined below: 
For subjects with AML, changes in specific protein markers and/or mRNA 
expression signatures will be assessed in bone marrow and/or tumor cell-
enriched PBMCs isolated from whole blood.
For subjects with l ymphomas, tissue biopsies will be required before and after 
treatment to evaluate changes in tumor -specific protein markers and/or gene 
expression signatures.
For subjects with MM, bone marrow will be evaluated for changes in tumor -
specific protein markers and/or gene expression signatures (for example, c -
Myc).
The tissue collection to support translational and mechanistic research for Part 2 is also 
disease specific and is simil ar to that described above.   2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_529909] -treatment sample collection is defined in the T&E table. See 
Study  Procedures Manual (SPM) and central lab manual for additional details.
6.6.2. Blood Sample Collection for Exploratory  Translational Research
Blood samples collected at time points described below and in the Time and Events 
tables for PK and pharmacody namic testing may  be required for all subjects.
Part 1 &2: At screening, date of bone marrow biopsy  (Part 2 MDS cohort only), 
disease assessment ( Table 7) and disease progression for isolating plasma for 
circulating biomarkers (eg, cfDNA) , PBMCs and neutrophils.
6.6.3. Unscheduled Safety  Biomarker Blood Samples
Unscheduled biomarker sample(s) may  be collected based on emerging sa fety.  One to 
three samples may  be collected in a day  to address specific safet y concerns.  Each sample 
would be up to 10 mL  of whole blood to look at cytokines, gene signature (mRNA) or 
other plasma proteins.  The timing of the samples will be based on em erging safet y data 
and would be discussed and determined b y [COMPANY_004] medical monitor and study team review.
6.7. Adverse Events (AE) and Serious A dverse Events (SA E)
The investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events t hat meet the definition of an AE or SAE as outlined in Section 6.7.[ADDRESS_529910].
Note: An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a medicinal product.  For marketed medicinal products, this 
also includes failure to produce expected benefits, abuse, or misuse.  Examples of events 
meeting the definition of an AE include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or grade of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even 
though it may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se w ill not be reported as an 
AE/SAE). 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0
2013N159121_10 CONFIDENTIA L
BET116183
90“Lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se is not to be 
reported as an AE or SAE.  However, an y signs and sy mptoms and/or clinical sequelae 
resulting from “lack of efficacy ” will be reported as an AE or SAE, if they  fulfill the 
definition of an AE or SAE.
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:
Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscop y, appendectom y); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE.
Situations where a n untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
The disease/di sorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s 
condition.
6.7.2. Definition of a SA E
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence that , at any  dose:
a.Results in death.
b.Is life -threatening.
NOTE: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetical ly might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23916]: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] 
(usually  involving at least an overnight stay ) at the ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_23917]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s 
office or out subject setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23918].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_420104], 
the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was 
necessary , the AE should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE.
d.Results in disability /incapacity , or
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which 
may interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.
e.Is a congeni tal anomal y/birth defect. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_529911] or may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the above definition.  These should also be considered 
serious.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, int ensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of 
drug dependency  or drug abuse.
g.Protocol -Specific SAEs are as follows:
All events of possibl e drug -induced liver injury  with hy perbilirubinaemia 
defined as ALT 3xUL N andbilirubin 2xUL N (>35% direct) (or ALT 
3xUL N and INR>1.5, if INR measured) or termed ‘Hy ’s Law’ events (INR 
measurement is not required and the threshold value stated will not apply  to 
subjects receiving anticoagulants).
NOTE: bilirubin fractionation is performed if testing is available.  If testing is 
unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary  bilirubin on dipstick 
indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting l iver injury .  If testing is 
unavailable and a subject meets the criterion of total bilirubin 2xUL N, then 
the event is still reported as an SAE.  If INR is obtained, include values on the 
SAE form.  INR elevations >1.[ADDRESS_529912] severe liver injury .
Any new primary  cancers.
Significant cardiac d ysfunction such as Grade 3 or higher decrease in LVEF 
and QTcF withdrawal criteria.
Grade 4 laboratory  abnormalities (not disease related).
Drug related hepatobiliary event leading to permanent discontinuation of 
study treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Cardiovascular Events
Investigators will be required to fill out event specific data collection tools for the
following AEs and SAEs:
Myocardial infarction/unstable angina
Congestive heart failure
Arrh ythmias
Valvulopathy
Pulmonary  hypertension
Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack
Peripheral arterial thrombosis
Deep Venous Thrombosis 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

92Revascularization
[IP_ADDRESS]. Death Events
In addition, all deaths, whether or not they  are considered SAEs, will require a specific 
death data collectio n tool to be completed.  The death data collection tool includes 
questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and 
non-cardiovascular death.
This information should be recorded within one week of when the death is first reported.
6.7.3. Labo ratory  and Other Safety  Assessment A bnormalities 
Reported as A Es and SA Es
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis), or 
other safet y assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements) 
including those that worsen from baseline, and events felt to be clinicall y significant in 
the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator, are to be recorded as an AE or 
SAE in accordance with the definitions provided.
In addition, an associated AE or SAE is to be recorded for any  laboratory  test result or 
other safet y assessment that led to an intervention, including permanent discontinuation 
of study  treatment, dose reduction, and/or dose interruption/delay .
Any new primary  cancer must be reported as a SA E.
However, an y clinicall y significant safet y assessments that are associated with the 
underly ing disease, unless judged by  [CONTACT_23996]'s condition, are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs.
6.7.4. Time Period and Frequency  of Detecting AEs and SA Es
The investigator or site staff is responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE.
AEs will be collected from the time the first dose of study  treatment is administer ed until 
[ADDRESS_529913] udy participation (e.g., protocol- mandated procedures, 
invasive tests, or change in existing therap y), study  treatment or [COMPANY_004] concomitant 
medication must be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study  
up to and including an y follo w-up contact.  All SAEs will be reported to [COMPANY_004] within 24 
hours, as indicated in Section 6.7.6 .
After discontinuation of study  treatment, the investigator will monitor all AEs/SAEs 
(including laboratory  abnormal ities such as an increase in troponins) that are ongoing 
until resolution or stabilization of the event or until the subject is lost to follow -up.  At  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_529914] be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs.  Open -ended 
and non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrence.  Appropriate questions include:
“How are you feeling?” 
“Have you had an y (other) medical problems since y our last visit/contact?” “Have you 
taken an y new medicines, other than those provided in this study , since your last 
visit/contact?” 
6.7.6. Prompt Reporting of SA Es and Other Events to [COMPANY_004]
SAEs, pregnancies, and liver function abnormalities and an y other events meeting pre -
defined criteria will be reported promptly  by [CONTACT_420244] 12 once the investigator determines the event meets the protocol definition for that 
event. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

6.7.7. Regulatory  reporting requirements for SA Es
Prompt notification of SAEs by  [CONTACT_420245] y of subjects are met.
[COMPANY_004] has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  authorit y and other 
regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a p roduct under clinical investigation.  [COMPANY_004] will 
comply  with country  specific regulatory  requirements relating to safet y reporting to the  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_529916] (IRB)/ Ethics Committee (EC) and 
investigators.
Investigator safety  reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions according to local regulatory  requirements and [COMPANY_004] policy  and are forwarded 
to investigators as necessary .
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) o r other 
specific safet y information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from [COMPANY_004] will file it with 
the IB and will notify  the I RB/ EC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
6.8. Pregnancy
6.8.1. Time period for collecting pregnancy  information
Reporting of an y pregnancies in female subjects and/or female partners of male subjects 
will be collected after the start of dosing and until [ADDRESS_529917]'s pregnancy .
The subject will also be followed to determ ine the outcome of the pregnancy .  
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to [COMPANY_004].  Generally , 
follow -up will be no longer than [ADDRESS_529918] pregnancy  information on the appropriate form and submit it to 
[COMPANY_004] within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy .  The partner will also be 
followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy .  Informa
tion on the status of the 
mother and child will be forwarded to [COMPANY_004].  Generall y, follow -up will be no longer than  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

966 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery  date.  Any  premature termination of the 
pregnancy  will be reported.
Procedures for pregnancy rep ort will be located in the SPM.
6.9. Pharmacogenetics
An important objective of the clinical study  is pharmacogenetics (PGx) research.  
Participation in PGx is optional, but all subjects who are eligible for the clinical study  
will be given the opportunity  to participate.  Subjects may  decline participation without 
effect on their medical care or care during the clinical study .  A separate consent 
signature [CONTACT_420322].
Subjects who provide consent will have a saliva sample taken for anal ysis.  The 
presence/absence of genetic variations in selected candidate genes in DNA from saliva 
will be anal ysed to determine their relationship with response (safety, tolerability , PK, 
and efficacy ) to treatment with [COMPANY_004]525762.
Information regarding PGx researc h is included in Appendix 5 .  The I RB/ EC and, where 
required, the applicable regulatory  agency  must approve the PGx assessments before 
these can be conducted at the site.  The approval(s) must be in writing and wil l clearly  
specify  approval of the PGx assessments (i.e., approval of Appendix 5 ).  In some cases, 
approval of the PGx assessments can occur after approval is obtained for the rest of the 
study .  If so, then the writ ten approval will clearly indicate approval of the PGx 
assessments is being deferred and the study
, except for PGx assessments, can be initiated.  
When PGx assessments will not be approved, then the approval for the rest of the study  
will clearl y indicate this and therefore, PGx assessments will not be conducted.
6.10. Qualit y of Life/Patient -Reported Outcomes
Patient- reported outcome, Skindex 29 ( refer to Appendix 11 )will be used to gauge the 
effects of treatment with [COMPANY_004]525762 on the qua lity of life and other subjective measures 
in subjects with CTCL .
7. STUDY TREA TMENTS
7.1. [COMPANY_004]525762 Investigational Product Dosage/A dministration
[COMPANY_004]525762 tablets will be provided to sites by  [CONTACT_23983].  The contents of the label will be in 
accordance with all applic able regulatory  requirements. An amorphous, free -base 
formulation of [COMPANY_004]525762 ( Table 13) and a cry stalline, besy late formulation ( Table 14) 
will be utilized.  
In the BET1 [ADDRESS_529919] of high -fat  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_529920] on the overall exposure (i.e. AUC) to [COMPANY_004]525762 administered as 
besylate coated tablets while administration with food tended to slightly  decrease Cmax. 
The fasting requirement is thus no longer necessary  in subjects taking the besy late 
formulation in Part 2.  
Either amorphous or besylate tablets may  be used in Part 1, based on the bioequivalence 
described above.  During the DLT observation period, subjects will only  receive one or 
the other formulation; any individual cohort will only  enrol subjects receiving a single 
formulation ty pe.  Upon completion of the DLT observa tion window, subjects may  be 
changed from amorphous to besy late tablets at the equivalent dose.
The bes ylate tablet will be utilized in Part 2.
Precaution will be taken to avoid direct contact [CONTACT_420246]. A Material 
Safety  Data Sheet (MSDS) d escribing the occupational hazards and recommended 
handling precautions will be provided to site staff if required b y local laws or will 
otherwise be available from [COMPANY_004] upon request.

7.3. Meals and Dietary  Restrictions
Subjects enrolle d under Part [ADDRESS_529925] one hour prior to each dose of study  
drug (amorphous free or besy late). No food or antacid should be taken for [ADDRESS_529926] overnight (i.e., at least 8 hours). After dosing, subjects will be 
asked to fast for an additional two hours.  These fasting requirements have been 
implemented in the protocol and informed consents to minimize PK variability .
If a subject vomits after taking study medication, the subject should be instructed not to 
retake the dose and should take the next scheduled dose.  Requirements for fasting befo re 
and after dosing may  be modified based on emerging PK, pharmacod ynam icand safety  
data.  An y change in fasting requirements will be communicated to each investigator and 
site staff in a future protocol amendment.  Should a twice dail y regimen be require d, 
additional consideration will be paid to this requirement once the escalation period is 
past.
Fasting will consist of avoiding the oral ingestion of calorie -containing products; 
however, ingestion of water is permitted.
Based on the results of the BET11 [ADDRESS_529927] on the overall exposure (i.e. AUC) to [COMPANY_004]525762 administered as 
besylate coated tablets, the fasting requirement is being lifted for subjects in Part 2 only   2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

After dosing, subjects will be asked to fast for an additional two hours.  These fasting 
requirement s have been implemented in the protocol and informed consents to minimize 
PK variability .
7.4. Treatment A ssignment
This is an open -labeled study .
Subjects will be identified by  a unique subject number that will remain consistent for the 
duration of the study .
Upon completion of all the required screening assessments, eligible subjects will be 
registered into RAMOS (Registration and Medication Ordering Sy stem), the [COMPANY_004] 
interactive voice response sy stem (IVRS), by  [CONTACT_109529].
7.5. Produc t Accountability
In accordance with local regulatory  requirements, the investigator, designated site staff, 
or head of the medical institution (where applicable) must document the amount of 
investigational product dispensed and/or administered to study  subjects, the amount 
returned b y stud y subjects, and the amount received from and returned to [COMPANY_004], when 
applicable.  Product accountability  records must be maintained throughout the course of 
the study .  Refer to the SPM for further detailed instructions on p roduct accountability .
7.6. Treatment Compliance
At each visit, an evaluation of subject compliance with taken medication will be 
performed.  The investigator will make every  effort to bring non -compliant subjects into 
compliance.
Compliance with [COMPANY_004]525762 will be assessed through query ing the subject during the 
site visits and documented in the source documents and eCRF.
A record of the number of [COMPANY_004]525762 tablets dispensed to and taken b y each subject 
must be maintained and reconciled with stud y treatment and compliance records.  
Treatment start and stop dates, including dates for treatment delay s and/or dose 
reductions will also be recorded in the eCRF.
7.7. Dose Modifications
7.7.1. Dose and Safety  Management Guidelines
The following dose modification criteria in Table 15should be used to provide guidance, 
but not act as a replacement for sound clinical judgment.  The investigator should use 
clinical judgment to determine which drug may  be contributing to the toxicity  
necessitati ng dose adjustment, and make the appropriate change for that drug. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

be used as clinically indicated.
8.2. Cautionary /Prohibited Medications
The use of certain medications and illicit drugs within 5 half -lives or 28 day s (if the drug 
is a potential enzy me inducer) prior to the first dose of study  medication (and for the 
duration of the study ) will not be allowed.  If a prohibited medication is required for 
single use (such as for a procedure) while stud y treatment(s) is held, the [COMPANY_004] Medical 
Monitor can approve such use.
Subjects must not rec eive other anti -cancer therapy  (including chemotherapy , 
immunotherapy , biologic t herap y, or hormonal therapy , whether approved or 
investigational) while on treatment in this study .  Short courses of steroids may  be co -
administered with permission from the [COMPANY_004] medical monitor.

given to co -administration with proton pump inhibitors.
Co-administration of medications that are associated with prolonged QT interval (please 
refer to crediblemeds.org for a complete list of these medications) is permitted as follows:
If a subject is taking a QT -prolonging medication prior to first dose of 
[COMPANY_004]525762, then the subject may  continue to take this medication without 
additional monitoring, so long as the baseline QTcF meets criteria as described in 
Section 4.2.2
If a subject must initiate a QT -prolonging medication whi le receiving 
[COMPANY_004]525762, then additional ECG monitoring should be implemented, per local 
standard, until the QT -prolonging medication achieves therapeutic concentrations.  
Refer to Table 15for QT management guideli nes.
During Part 1, Antacids should not be consumed for at least 1h before and 2h after 
administration of [COMPANY_004]525762.
Questions regarding concomitant medications should be directed to the [COMPANY_004] Medical 
Monitor for clarification.
8.2.1. Drugs Potentially  Affecting [COMPANY_004]525762 Pharmacokinetics or 
affected by  [CONTACT_23983]525762 
In vitro data suggests that [COMPANY_004]525762 is only  metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]3A4 and thus 
coadministration of potent inducers and moderate or potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should 
be avoided during the course of the stud ywhere possible as they  may  respectively  
decrease or increase exposure to [COMPANY_004]525762. Note: any  medication (including 
antibacterials, antifungals, or antivirals) which are necessary  for the health, well -being, 
and standard clinical care of patients with he matologic malignancies are exempt from the 
restrictions below.
[COMPANY_004]525762 is a moderate CYP3A4 inducer. Medications that have a narrow therapeutic 
index and that are substrates of CYP3A4 should be administered with caution, as their

pregnant) is defined as any  female who has had a hy sterectom y, bilateral oophorectom y 
(ovariectomy ) or bilateral tubal ligation, or is post -menopausal .
A practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate 
clinical profile, e.g., age appropriate, >45 years in the absence of hormone replacement 
therap y (HRT).  In questionable cases, the subject must ha ve a follicular stimulating 
hormone (FSH) value >40 mI U/mL and an estradiol value <40pg/mL  (<140 pmol/L).
A female of childbearing potential is defined as any  female who does not meet the 
criteria of non -childbearing potential as described in the previous paragraph.

11. DATA ANALYSIS AND ST ATISTICAL CONSIDERA TIONS
11.1. Sample Size Assumptions
No formal statistical h ypotheses will be tested in Part 1.  Anal ysis will be descriptive and 
exploratory .
11.1.1. Part I, Dose Escalation
The sample size in Part 1 is not driven by  [CONTACT_42371].  The total number of 
subjects will depend on the number of dose escalations needed.  However, the maximum 
anticipat ed number of subjects will be approximately  60-70.
Doses to be studied in Part 1 will be guided b y calculating the posterior probability  that 
the DLT rate falls within an acceptable range for each subsequent dose after each dose 
cohort observation period. The N -CRM method will be used to calculate posterior 
probabilities utilizing a pre- specified prior distribution.
Subjects in Part 1 treated at the RP2D may  be included in the efficacy  analy sis as 
described in Section 11.6.1 .
11.1.2. Part 2, Expansion Cohort
The primary  goal of Part 2 is to evaluate disease -specific efficacy  in subjects with MDS, 
and CTCL .
For MDS, efficacy  is defined as a clinicall y meaningful response rate (defined as the 
percentage of subjects that ha ve achieved a CR, marrow CR, or PR) of 30% relative 
to a 10% response rate suggesting no activity .  Historically , hypomethy lating agent 
failure has conferred a poor prognosis, with a response rate to second -line therapy  of 
10% or less ( Prebet , 2011).  Investigational agents have demonstrated a response rate 
of approximately  30%, though no effects on overall survival have been reported 
(Seetharam , 2012; Kantarjian , 2010).  Because of the high unmet medical need of 
relapsed/refractory  MDS, and because no agent to date has exceeded the 30%  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0
2013N159121_10 CONFIDENTIA L
BET116183
114response rate published above, 30% was chosen as a realistic goal for subjects with 
MDS.
For CTCL , efficacy  is defined as a clinicall y meaningful response rate (defined as the 
percentage of subjects that have achieved a CR, or PR lasting more than 4 months ) 
of 40% relative to a 20% response rate suggesting no activity .  Multiple clinical 
studies with acti ve and approved agents have demonstrated a response rate of 30-
40% in a comparable patient population (Duvic , 2007 ; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_79577] , 200 9; Whittaker , 
2010 ).  Therefore, a target response rate of 40% was chosen to represent the response 
rate of an active agent.  Conversel y, an agent with a response rate of 20% is unlikely  
to be developed further; this is approximately  the response rate of placebo described 
in the denileukin difitox package insert [ONTAK package insert, 2008] . Therefore, 
20% was chosen to represent the activity  of a futile agent.  
Bayesian statistics will be employ ed to calculate the predictive probability  that the 
response ra te is greater than the historic response rate at interim anal yses using a 
weak/non -informative prior. A Bay esian analy sis expresses uncertaint y about a parameter 
in terms of probability .  A prior distribution is defined to characterize the level of 
knowledge about a parameter before the data are collected.  Once the data are collected, a 
posterior distribution is formed using the prior distribution and the observed data.  A very  
weak prior Beta distribution with a mean response rate equal to the target resp onse rate is 
assumed.  Thus, the posterior distribution for the response rate will be primarily driven b y 
the data and can be derived as follows:
Let p denote the response rate, the number of responses in the current n subjects, x, 
follows a binomial distribution, Binomial (n, p).  Taking the Bay esian method and 
combining the prior distribution (e.g. Beta (0.03, 0.07)) and the observed data x, the 
posterior distribution of the response rate follows a beta distribution, i.e.
In the following case, 30% is the target response rate.
p Beta (0.03 + x, 0.07 + n- x) with posterior mean (0.03+ x)/(0.07 + n).
Futility  anal ysis for each disease cohort will begin when response data is available for at 
least 10 subjects treated at the RP2D in Part 1 and Part 2. Each disease cohort may  be 
stopped earl y for futility  if the predictive probability  of success ( response rate  > 
historical response rate) is less than 1%.  Futility  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_420118] 3.2.[ADDRESS_529941] a Type I Error ( ) of 0.034 and 87% power. Futility  anal ysis 
will be based on subjects who have at least one post -baseline disease assessment , have 
progressed or died, or have permanently  discontinued from study  treatment . The trial will 
be stopped early  for futility  if the predictive probability  of success ( that the response rate 
historical response rate) is less than 1%. If the true response rate is 10%, the average 
sample size is 20 and the probability  of earl y termination for futility  is 93%. If the t rue 
response rate is 30%, the average sample size is 31 subjects and the probability  of earl y 
termination is 9%.  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_529942] a Ty pe I Error ( ) of 0.0 49and 8 5.2% power. Futility  
analysis will be based on subjects who have at least one post -baseline disease assessment, 
have progressed or died, or have permanentl y discontinued from study treatment. The 
trial will be stopped earl y for futility  if the predictive probability  of success ( that the 
response rate  historical response rate) is less than 1%. If the true response rate is 20%, 
the average sample size is 2 3and the probability  of earl y termination for futility  is 92%. 
If the true response rate is 40%, the average sample size is 36 subjects and the probability  
of earl y termination is 11%.

No anal ysis of sample size sensitivity  was performed.
11.1.4. Sample Size Re -estimation
No sample size re -estimation will be performed.
11.2. Analysis Populations
All Treated (Safety and Clinical Activity) Population: This will consist of all subjects 
who received at least one dose of study  treatment.  Safety  and clinical activity  data will 
be evaluated based on this population.
The PK Concentration Population: This will consist of those subjects in All Subjects 
Population for whom a PK sample is obtained and anal yzed.
The PK Paramet er Population: This will consist of those subjects in All Subjects 
Population for whom a PK parameter is available.
The Pharmacodynamic Population: This will consist of those subjects in All Subjects

suitable summary  statistics.
11.3.4. Derived and Transformed Data
The PK param eters AUC, Cmax, and terminal half -life will be log- transformed prior to 
analysis.
11.3.5. Assessment Windows
Safety  assessments that occur prior to the administration of study  drug will be considered 
screening assessments.  Safety assessments that occur after dos ing has begun will be 
considered as having occurred while on treatment.
Disease assessments will be distinguished as belonging to either screening, continued 
therap y or post -study  phases of the study .

121samples collected on the specified day s will be used to assess attainment of steady  state.  
To estimate the extent of accumulation after repeat dosing, t he observed accumulation 
ratio (Ro) may  be determined from the ratio of AUC(0 -) in Week 2 Day  7 / AUC(0- ) in 
Week 1 Day  1.  The ratio of AUC(0 -) on Week 2 Day  7 / Week 1 Day  1 AUC(0- ∞) will 
be calculated to assess time invariance.  Plasma concentration- time data will be listed by  
[CONTACT_2715], dosing regimen, and summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard 
deviation [SD], median, minimum and maximum) by  [CONTACT_420260].  
Mean and/ or median values will be plotted over time.  I ndividual plasma and urinary  (if 
available) PK parameters values as well as a descriptive summary  (mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean, and the standard deviation, 
CV% and 95% confidence interval of log- transformed parameters [if applicable]) b y day, 
dose and dose regimen cohort will be reported.
Cmax and AUC (AUC(0- ∞), single dose, and AUC(0 -), stead y state) will be plotted as a 
function of the dose administered and dosing regimen.  If more than 2 dose cohorts are 
evaluated, dos e proportionality  of AUC and Cmax for [COMPANY_004]525762 will be assessed using 
the power model (details will be provided in the RAP).
Plasma concentration- time data from Parts 1 and 2 will be combined and may  be 
combined with data from other studies and further an alyzed using a population approach.  
A nonlinear mixed effects model will be used to determine population PK parameters 
(absorption rate, Ka, apparent clearance, CL/F and volume of distribution, V/F) and 
summary  exposure measures (Cmax, AUC and Average obs erved concentration 
(Cav) =AUC/ ) and identify  important covariates (e.g., age, weight, or disease related 
covariates). This anal ysis may  be reported separately .
11.9. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacody namic Analy ses
Observed or predicted concentrations will be combine d with safet y, efficacy, and/or 
pharmacod ynamic measures of interest to examine potential exposure response 
relationships.
The relationship between QTcF and concentration expressed as Cmax, Cav, and 
instantaneous time -matched concentration will be plotted graphicall y.  A linear mixed 
effects anal ysis of the slope of the QTcF -concentration responses adjusting for baseline 
will be evaluated as a means of estimating QTcF effect in lieu of a thorough QT study .
Other quantitative safet y parameters and biomarkers of interest including changes in 
troponin levels will be plotted graphicall y against summary exposure measures (e.g., 
Cmax, C , and Cav).  Where evidence of a signal is seen, linear and non -linear mixed 
effect models will be fitted to the data to estimate PK/pharmacod ynamic parameters of 
interest; slope, baseline (E0), exposure producing 50% of the maximum effect (EC50), 
and maximum effect (Emax).
Overall efficacy  data and overall tumor burden may  be described using 
categorical/continuous models with summa ry exposure parameters (e.g., Cmax, C , and 
Cav) as covariates derived from the population PK anal ysis.  Further model details will 
be provided in the RAP.   This analy sis may  be reported separatel y. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_529950] from all

follow up assessments within 24-72 hrs 
Monitor participants weekly until liver chemistries resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline
1. Serum bilirubin fra ctionation should be performed if testing is available. If serum bilirubin fractionation is not 
immediately available, discontinue study treatment for that participant if ALT 3xULN andbilirubin 
2xULN. Additionally, if serum bilirubin fractionation tes ting is unavailable, record presence of detectable 
urinary bilirubin on dipstick, indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury. 
2. All events of ALT 3xULN andbilirubin  2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) or ALT 3xULN andINR>1.5, if 
INR measured which may indicate severe liver injury (possible ‘Hy’s Law’), must be reported as an SAE 
(excluding studies of hepatic impairment or cirrhosis) ; INR measurement is not required and the 
threshold value stated will not apply to participants receiv ing anticoagulants
3. New or worsening symptoms believed to be related to liver injury (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, or jaundice) or believed to be related to hypersensitivity (such as fever, 
rash or eosinophilia )
4. Includes: Hepatitis A IgM antibody; Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis B Core Antibody (IgM); 
Hepatitis C RNA; Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody; Epstein -Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if 
unavailable, obtain heterophile antibody or monospot testing); Hepatitis E IgM antibody

Rechallenge Following Liver Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_420123] -induced l iver injury , drug rechallenge is associated with a 13% 
mortality across all drugs in prospective studies (Andrade , 2009). Clinical outcomes 
vary by [CONTACT_9934], with nearl y 50% fatalit y with halothane readministered within one month 
of initial injury . However, some drugs seldom result in recurrent liver injury or fatalit y.  
Risk factors for a fatal drug rechallenge outcome include:
Hypersensitivity (Andrade , 2009) with initial liver injury  (e.g. fever, rash,
eosinophilia) 
jaundice or bilirubin >2xULN with initial liver injury  (direct bilirubin >35% of 
total)
participant currentl yexhibits severe liver injury  defined by : [CONTACT_42386] 3xUL N, 
bilirubin 2xUL N (direct bilirubin >35% of total), or INR1.5
serious adverse event or fatality  has earlier been observed with drug 
rechallenges (Papay , 2009; Hunt , 2010)
evidence of drug- related preclinical liability  (e.g. reactive metabolites;  
mitochondrial impairment (Hunt , 2010)
Rechallenge refers to resuming study  treatment following drug induced liver injury  
(DILI). Because of the risks associated with rechallenge after DILI this should only  be 
considered for a participant for whom there is compelling evidence of benefit fr om a 
critical or life -saving medicine, there is no alternative approved medicine available, and a 
benefit:risk assessment of rechallenge is considered to be favourable.
Approval b y [COMPANY_004] for rechall enge with study  treatment can be considered where:

participant who is receiving compelling benefit with study  treatment that exceeds 
risk, and no effective alternative therapy  is available.  
Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Board approval for rechallenge with study  
treatment must be obtained, as required.

Diarrhea
General considerations for diarrhea management
Rule out other or concomitant causes. These include medications (e.g., stool softeners, 
laxatives, antacids, etc.), infection by C. difficile or Candida species, partial bowel 
obstruction, malabsorption/lactose intolerance, fecal impaction, diets high in fiber or 
lactose.
For uncomplicated Gr ade 1 to 2 diarrhea (i.e., mild to moderate and defined as 
NCI-CTCAE v4.0 [ NCI, 2009] Grade 1-2 with no complicating signs or s ymptoms):
Dietary  modifications: stop all lactose containing products and eat small meal s.  A 
BRAT (banana, rice, apples, toast) diet can be helpful.
Hydration: drink 8- 10 large glasses of clear liquids per day  (e.g., Gatorade or broth)
Consider administration of standard dose of loperamide (subjects should have 
loperamide available in order to start at the first signs of diarrhea):
Initial dose of 4 mg followed b y 2 mg every  four hours or after every  
unformed stool; maximum 16 mg/day .
Continuation of loperamide is suggested until diarrhea free for 12 hours
Consider a temporary  investigational drug dose interruption until sy mptoms have 
resolved to baseline or Grade 1.  Re -treatment with [COMPANY_004]525762 may  then be 
resumed at 100%.  Please refer to Section 7.7.2 for additional guidance.
If mild to moderate diarrhea persists for more than 24 hours, administer loperamide 
2mg every  two hours; maximum 16 mg/day .  Consider adding oral antibiotics.
If mild to moderate diarrhea persists after 48 hours total treatment with loperamide, 
start second- line agents (octr eotide, budesonide or tincture of opi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]).  Consider 
adding oral antibiotics.
For Grade 3 to 4 diarrhea or complicated Grade 1 to 2 diarrhea (i.e., crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
nausea/vomiting ≥ Grade 2, decreased performance status, fever, sepsis, Grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia, f rank bleeding, deh ydration):
The subject must call the investigator immediatel y for an y complicated severe 
diarrhea event.
Discontinue [COMPANY_004]525762 treatment and hold until sy mptoms resolve to ≤Grade 1 or 
baseline.  Consider re -starting therapy  at a reduced d ose.
If loperamide has not been initiated, initiate loperamide immediately .  Initial dose 4 
mg followed b y 2 mg every  two hours or after every  unformed stool; maximum 16 
mg/day . 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

administer octreotide.
Administer antibiotics as needed (e.g., fluoroquinolones), especially  if diarrhea is 
persistent bey ond 24 hours or there is fever or Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia.
Intervention should be continued until the subject is diarrhea free for a t least 24

Pharmacogenetics –Background
Pharmacogenetics (PGx) is the study  of variability in drug response due to hereditary  
factors in populations.  There is increasing evidence that an individual's genetic 
background (i.e., genot ype) may  impact the PK (absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
elimination), pharmacodynamics (relationship between concentrations and 
pharmacologic effects or the time course of pharmacologic effects) and/or clinical 
outcome (in terms of efficacy  and/or safety  and tolerability ).  Some reported examples of 
PGx analy sis include:

the gene. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_529962] of clinical studies.
Collection of saliva samples, may  enable PGx analy sis to be conducted if at any  time it 
appears that there is a potential unexpected or unexplained variation in handling or 
response to [COMPANY_004]525762.
Pharmacogenetic Research Objectives
The objective of the PGx research (if there is a potential unexpected or unexplained 
variation) is to investigate a possible genetic relationship to handling or response to 
[COMPANY_004]525762.  If at an y time it appears there is potential variab ility in response in this 
clinical study  or in a series of clinical studies with [COMPANY_004]525762 that may  be attributable 
to genetic variations of subjects, the following objectives may  be investigated
Relationship between genetic variants and the PK and/or pharmacody namics of 
study  treatment
Relationship between genetic variants and safet y and/or tolerability  of study  
treatment.
Relationship between genetic variants and efficacy of stud y treatment.
Study Population
Any subject who has given informed consent to participate in the clinical study , has met 
all the entry  criteria for the clinical study , and receives study  treatment may  take part in 
the PGx research.  An y subject who has received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant 
must be excluded from the PGx resear ch.
Subject participation in the PGx research is voluntary  and refusal to participate will not 
indicate withdrawal from the clinical study .  Refusal to participate will involve no penalt y 
or loss of benefits to which the subject would otherwise be entitled .
Study Assessments and Procedures
A saliva sample will be collected for the PGx research using an Oragene DNA self 
collection tube.  It is recommended that the saliva sample be taken at day  1, but may  be 
taken at an y time while the subject is participatin g in the clinical study  after the subjects 
provided informed consent for the PGx research.
The PGx sample is labelled (or “coded”) with a study  specific number that can be traced 
or linked back to the subject b y the investigator or site staff.  Coded samples do not carry  
personal identifiers (such as name [CONTACT_78207]).  The saliva sample is taken 
on a single occasion unless a duplicate sample is required due to inability  to utilize the 
original sample.
The DNA extracted from the saliva sample may be subjected to sample quality  control 
analysis.  This anal ysis will involve the genot ypi[INVESTIGATOR_420126]  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_529963] PGx anal ysis may  be identified after a study  (or set of studies) of 
[COMPANY_004]525762 has been completed and the study  data reviewed.  In some cases, the 
samples may  not be studied (e.g., no questions are raised about how people respond to 
[COMPANY_004]525762).
Samples will be stored securel y and may be kept for up to [ADDRESS_529964] 
completes the study  or [COMPANY_004] may  destro y the samples sooner.  [COMPANY_004] or those working 
with [COMPANY_004] (for example, other researchers) will use samples collected from the study  for 
the purpose stated in this protocol and in the ICF.
Subjects can request their sample to be destro yed at any  time.
Subject Withdrawal from Study
If a subject who has consented to participate in PGx research and has a sample taken for 
PGx research withdraws from the clinical study  for any  reason other than lost to follow -
up, the subject will be given the following options:
The sample is retained for PGx research.
Any PGx sample is destroy ed.
If a subject withdraws consent from the PGx research or requests sample destruction for 
any reason, the investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request 
sample destruction within the timeframe specified by  [CONTACT_420264].  In either case, [COMPANY_004] will only keep study 
information collected/generated up to that point.
Pharmacogenetics A nalyses
Specific genes sections of DNA may  be selected from areas of the genome (e.g., 
candidate genes) known to encode the drug target, drug metabolizing enzy mes, areas 
associated with mechanisms underly ing adverse events, and those linked to study  disease 
and, thus, linked to drug response.
These candidate genes that may  be investigated in this study  include the following: the 
[COMPANY_004] Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and E xcretion genes.  These play  a central 
role in drug PK and pharmacody namics .  In addition, continuing research may  identify  
other enzy mes, transporters, proteins or receptors that may  be involved in response to 
[COMPANY_004]525762.  The genes that may  code for these proteins may  also be studied.
Genome -wide scans involving a large number of poly morphic markers (e.g., single 
nucleotide poly morphisms) located throughout the genome, often correlated with a 
candidate gene, may  be studied to determine the.  This approach i s often employ ed when 
potential genetic effects are not well understood.
The results of PGx investigations will be reported either as part of the main clinical study  
report or as a separate report.  All endpoints of interest from all comparisons will be  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

appropriate statistical methods will be used to analyze the genetic markers in the context 
of other clinical data.  Statistical methods may  include, but are not limited to Hard y-

by [CONTACT_377118], Evaluation of Genot ypic Effects, Evaluation of Treatment by [CONTACT_420265] -Gene Interaction, Linkage Disequilibrium, Multiple Comparison and Multip licity  
and/or Power and Sample Size Considerations.  A detailed description of the anal yses to 
be conducted will be documented in the PGx RAP.
Informed Consent
Subjects who do not wish to participate in the PGx research may  still participate in the 
clinica l study .  PGx informed consent must be obtained prior to an y sample being taken 
for PGx research.
Provision of Study Results and Confidentiality  of Subject’s PGx Data
[COMPANY_004] may  summarize the cumulative the PGx research results in the clinical study  report.
In general, [COMPANY_004] does not inform the investigator, subject or any one else (e.g., family  
members, study  investigators, primary  care ph ysicians, insurers, or employ ers) of the 
PGx research results unless required b y law.  The information generated from PGx

Lymphoma (Part 1)
Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma Response Criteria
This study employ s response criteria from the International Workshop to standardize 
response criteria for No n-Hodgkin’s Ly mphomas [ Cheson , 2007].  These criteria use the 
following categories of response: Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), 
Stable Disease (SD), Relapse and Progression.  To be assigned a status of PR, Complete 
Response/Unconfirmed (CRu) or CR, changes in tumor assessment must be confirmed b y 
repeat studies performed at least four weeks after the criteria for response are first met.  
Because the criteria for Partial Response (PR) requires a decrease by 50% in sum of 
products of the diameters (SPD) in the six largest dominant nodes or nodal masses, six 
dominant nodes and/or nodal masses must be identified if > six involved nodes/nodal 
masses are present.
Complete Response
To be assigned a status of c omplete response, all changes must be confirmed by  [CONTACT_420266].
Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of 
disease and disappearance of all dise ase related B -symptoms if present prior to 
therap y, as well as normalization (normal limits of institutional labs) of those 
biochemical abnormalities (e.g., LDH) definitely attributed to NHL .
All ly mph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed to normal s ize.  Nodes that 
were 1.[ADDRESS_529965] 
decreased to < 1.[ADDRESS_529966] diameter after treatment or b y more than 75% 
in the sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters (SPD) o f all nodes 
initially  measuring 1.1 to 1.5 cm.  Nodes that were > 1.[ADDRESS_529967] decreased to < 1.[ADDRESS_529968] diameter.
The spleen, if considered to be enlarged before therap y on the basis of a scan, m ust 
have decreased in size and must not be palpable on phy sical examination.  Any  
macroscopic nodules in any  organs (i.e., splenic, hepatic) detectable on imaging 
studies should no longer be present.  Similarly , other organs considered to be 
enlarged prior to therap y due to involvement of lymphoma (i.e., kidney s, liver, etc.) 
must have decreased in size.
If the bone marrow was involved by  [CONTACT_248287], the biopsy  must 
be cleared. The biopsy  sample on which this determination is made must be a dequate 
(with a goal of > 20 mm unilateral core). If the sample is indeterminate by  
[CONTACT_5293] , it should be negative by  [CONTACT_9064] . A sample that is 
negative b y immunohistochemistry but that demonstrates a small population of 
clonal ly mphocy tes by [CONTACT_420267] a CR until data become 
available demonstrating a clear difference in subject outcome. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

BET116183
146Partial Response (PR)
To be assigned a status of partial response, all changes must be confirmed by  [CONTACT_420268].
A decrease of > 50% in the SPD (sum of the products of the diameters) of the six 
largest (or less) dominant nodes or nodal masses.
No increase in the size of the liver or the spleen.  No unequivocal progression in any  
nonmeasurable or nondominant site.
Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress b y > 50% in SPD (sum of the products of 
the diameters).
With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is 
considered nonmeasurabl e disease.  However, all extra -nodal sites should be 
followed.
Bone marrow assessment is not relevant for determination of a PR because it is 
assessable and not measurable disease.
No new sites of disease.
Stable Disease (SD)
Neither sufficient shrinkage t o qualify  for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify  for 
progressive disease taking as reference the smallest SPD since the treatment started.
Progression
For subjects who have not responded or have achieved PR.
Appearances of an y new lesions/sites during o r after therap y.
Increase of 50% in the SPD from nadir measurement of any  previousl y involved 
abnormal node or nodal mass.
Relapse
For subjects who have achieved CR or CRu.
Appearance of an y new lesions/sites during or after therap y.
Increase of 50% in t he SPD from nadir measurement of any  previousl y involved 
dominant node >1.[ADDRESS_529969] scans should be done even if those areas we re not initially  involved because of 
the unpredictable pattern of relapse in NHL.
Confirmation Measurement/Duration of Response
To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed 
by [CONTACT_420269] (4) weeks after the criteria for 
response are first met . 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

Amendment [ADDRESS_529980] of the Medicines and Healthcare 
products Regulatory  Agency  (MHRA), [LOCATION_008].  MHRA requested the removal 
of “until commercial supply  of [COMPANY_004]525762 becomes available” as a duration of exposure 
in accordance with the Commission Directive 2005/28/EC.  Changes are noted below 
with strikethrough of deleted words and an underlining of new language added to the 
amendment. In addition, the sponsor/medical monitor information page has updated 
information.
15.11.[ADDRESS_529981] of Changes
STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION:  This study  is divided into 2 parts; Part [ADDRESS_529982] the recommended Part 2 dose (RP2D) 
based on the safet y, pharmacokinetic, and ph armacody namic profiles observed after 
oral administration of [COMPANY_004]525762.  Eligible subjects with relapsed refractory  
hematological malignancies will be enrolled in the dosing cohorts until a maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) is established.  Subjects may continu e treatment in the study  
until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity , or withdrawal of consent 
commercial suppl y of [COMPANY_004]525762 becomes available to the subject .  An expansion 
cohort is planned in subjects with acute leukemias to further explore clinica l activity  
at the MTD (Part 2).

Revised Text:
Section 1.3.1. QD Dose Cohort
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Starting Dose Calculations
The proposed starting dose for this clinical study  in subjects with hematologic 
malignancies is 5 mg once daily (QD) based on the following, assuming a 70 kg adult 
with a body  surface area of 1.7 m2.   This is different from the ongoing solid tumor study  
(BET115521 ) in which the starting dose was 2 mg dail y.  This dose level has been 
successfull y cleared and a dose of 4 mg is currently being evaluated. The dose of 5 mg 
daily  was based on preclinical considerations described Section [IP_ADDRESS].1below, ),
preliminary  huma n pharmacokinetics (PK; Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ), clinical consideration such 
asincluding the aggressive nature of the relapsed and/or refractory  tumor (Section 
[IP_ADDRESS].3), and the desire to minimise sub -therapeutic exposures. This starting dose is 
different from the ongoing solid tumor study  ([COMPANY_004] Study  BET115521, NCT# 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in which the starting dose was 2 mg dail y (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 )
Section [IP_ADDRESS].1. Preclinical Considerations
The following approaches have been considered to establish the starting dose for 
[COMPANY_004]525762:
Section [IP_ADDRESS].2. Human PKPharmacokinetics and Equivalent Exposure for NOEL for 
QTc prolongation
Paragraph [ADDRESS_530047] dose is presented in Appendix 
13 (Section 15.13 )
Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 Clinical Considerations
Relapsed and/or refractory hematologic malignancies have an aggressive and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_420091] 3 
week for the Dose Limiting Toxicity  (DLT) assessment to be don e.  Therefore there is a 
need to minimise the number of patients exposed to sub -therapeutic doses without 
compromising safet y.  The 5 mg starting dose provides adequate safet y margins for 
toxicities that can be clinically  monitored and are largel y reversib le (excluding testicular 
effects long-term effects on  male and female reproductive function, which is being 
evaluated), while minimizing the number of patients with aggressive hematologic cancers 
exposed to predicted sub -therapeutic doses. Moreover, the st arting dose of 2 mg dail y in  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

BET116183
207the solid tumor trial (BET115521) has been successfully  cleared and a dose of 4 mg daily  
is currentl y being explored.
Taking all the above into consideration and the extensive clinical monitoring for QT 
prolongation, a starting dose of 5 mg QD is planned.
Starting Dose Based on Dose Level Cleared in the Solid Tumor Study
The key  safet y findings from the ongoing solid tumor study (BET115521) will be shared 
with the investigators in this hematologic malignancies study  (as described in Section ). 
Currently , the dose level of 2 mg has been cleared. I n the event a dose level of 4 mg or 
higher is cleared in the solid tumor study , and the next dose level to be tested is higher 
than 5 mg, then [COMPANY_004] would consider amending this protocol t o start at the same dose that 
the solid tumor protocol is testing at that time.
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Predicted therapeutic dose range
Cell lines of hematological origin were generally  more sensitive than the cell lines of 
other solid tumor origins, namely  smal l cell lung cancer (SCL C) and Colorectal cancer 
(CRC) cells.  The more sensitive cell lines had growth I C50 (gI C50) values as low as 50 -
100 nM.  The potential therapeutic dose for [COMPANY_004]525762 in humans was derived using 
available preclinical PK, data from invitro cell lines of hematological origin, and 
efficacy  data from OPM -2 multiple my eloma tumour xenograft studies.  Based on 
modeling, maximal efficacy  of [COMPANY_004]525762 may  require ≥ 50% target inhibition.  The 
predicted human effective daily  dose is likely  tobe 25 to 50 mg in the range of 25 to 100 
mg assuming 50 to 100% oral bioavailability .
Section 1.3.2. BID Dose Cohort 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Preclinical Rationale for BID
Recent clinical and pre -clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacod ynamic data suggests a 
potential benefit of a twice dail y (BID) dosing regimen compared to QD dosing 
[[COMPANY_004]525762 I B, GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2011N113741_03] . In mice, 
[COMPANY_004]525762 has a short half- life of about 1.[ADDRESS_530048] -dose; however, expression returned to pre- treatment levels within [ADDRESS_530049] been further explored in a number of in vivo xenograft efficacy  
studies. In a su bcutaneous, patient -derived model of SCL C, BID dosing at 12.5mg/kg 
resulted in improved tumor growth inhibition compared to 25 mg/kg QD (74% versus 
60%, respectively ).  Improved efficacy  with BID dosing was also observed in a cell line 
xenograft model of C RC. BID dosing at 12.5mg/kg resulted in 48% tumor growth 
inhibition, whereas 25mg/kg QD dosing resulted in 34% inhibition.  I n a third model, a 
cell line xenograft of SCLC, there was no significant difference in tumor growth  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

208inhibition resulting from 12.5mg/kg BID versus 25mg/kg QD dosing. Thus, we observe 
equivalent or improved efficacy  with BID dosing in all xenograft models tested.
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Rationale for BID
Pharmacokinetics of [COMPANY_004]525762 has been evaluated in subjects for studies BET1155 21 
and BET116183 following single and repeated daily administration of [COMPANY_004]525762 
(Section 15.13) . 
[COMPANY_004]525762 pharmacokinetics are characterized by a rapid absorption with maximum 
concentration occurring mostly  within the first hour after dosing. [COMPANY_004]525762 is 
eliminated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_420135] -life of 3 to 7 hours, leading to a 
lack of accumulation following once daily oral administration. Following single oral 
administration and repeated once daily  administration of 2 mg to 60 mg of [COMPANY_004]5 [ZIP_CODE], 
Cmaxand AUC tended to increase in a dose proportional fashion.
Based on the pharmacokinetics of [COMPANY_004]525762 observed to date, and evidence of a short 
half-life of about 5 hours, trough concentrations are predicted to be below the average in 
vitro I C50 (0.08 uM to 1.3 uM) for the tumor t ypes selected for this study. Furthermore, 
based on the pharmacokinetics to date, it is predicted that even 100 mg QD doses would 
result in the trough concentrations below the average in vitro IC50.  Dividing the daily  
dose into two doses administered about 12 hours apart would allow the trough 
concentration to be above the lower in vitro IC50 for doses around 30 mg BID.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Starting Dose for BID
The maximum starting dose for BID will be 20 mg provided the 40 mg QD dose cohort 
has been cleared. A lower BID starting dose will be considered depending on emerging 
safet y, PK, and PD data
Section 1.3.3. Dose escalation steps (QD and BID)
The MTD in subjects with leukemia may  differ from the MTD in subjects with multiple 
myeloma and ly mphoma therefore AML subjects will be enrolled initially  to determine 
the MTD for AML. Once the 40 mg dose cohort is cleared in AML, the MTD 
determination of MM and NHL subjects will begin at the 40 mg dose level.

Revised Text:
Thereafter, subjects will be enrolled in a standard 3+3 design. Separate dose escalation 
cohorts will be opened for QD and BID dosing.
In the accelerated dose escalation cohorts and the 3+3 dose escalation cohorts, the dose 
will be escalated based on all available data, including PK data and the safety profile of 
prior cohorts, as well as the predicted dose from N-CRM Neuenschwander continual 
reassessment method (N -CRM) design [Neuenschwander, 2009].  N -CRM design is a 
type of Bay esian adaptive dose escalation scheme.  The method is fully  adaptive and 
makes use of all the DLT information available at the time of each dose assignment.  The 
DLT information of all subjects enrolled in the trial are used to update the dose -toxicity  
relationship and provide supportive information in addition to 3+3 design in the next 
escalation/de -escalation decision.
Dose escalation will continue until an MTD is determined or until a dose of 100200mg 
per day  is reached.  After the MTD has been determined in Part1, then Part 2 dose 
expansion cohorts will be opened.
Due to the potentially  different MTD in subjects with acute leukemia compared to 
myeloma/l ymphoma (Section 1.3.3), MTD will initially  be established in subjects with 
AML  and subjects with MM/NHL  may  be enrolled at dose levels cleared in subjects with

Sectio n [IP_ADDRESS]. A ccelerated Dose Escalation in Part 1
Rationale for Change: Simplification by  [CONTACT_420279].
Revised Text:
One subject per dose level in the accelerated dose escalation schema will be treated to 
minimize suboptimal drug exposures, starting with Dose Level [ADDRESS_530054] experiences ≥ Grade 2 drug related non- hematological toxicity , or DL T (except 
for pre -specified Grade 3 non- serious non- hematologic al drug related adverse event , see 
Section 3.2.2 ( based on National Cancer Institute -Common Terminology  Criteria for 
Adverse Events Version 4.0 [NCI -CTCAE v4.0] [NCI , 2009]) that would allow 
continuation of accelerated dose escalation ;  (Table 2).  Once t his occurs, the accelerated 
dose escalation will terminate, and subjects will be enrolled under a standard 3+3 design 
(i.e., [ADDRESS_530055] cohorts, seeSection [IP_ADDRESS] ).

Revised Text:
Paragraph [ADDRESS_530057] lower tolerability  to [COMPANY_004]525762, then a lower MTD/RP2D could be 
selected for AML subjects. and NHL/MM subjects. Up to an additional 6 subjects may  be 
enrolled at an y dose level below the MTD in order to obtain additional tumour tissue for 
PD biomarkers to better understand the dose/exposure/PD relationship.  Additional 
cohorts (with daily  exposure not exceeding MTD e xposure) may  also be initiated to 
explore alternative dosing schedules to optimize the PK, safet y and tolerability profile.  
The enrolment of additional subjects as described could be in parallel with Part 2 
enrolment.  Although DLT will not be based on th e additional subjects enrolled into the 
study  to further evaluate safet y, PK, to obtain tumor tissue for biomarkers, data from 
these additional subjects will be considered in defining final MTD and RP2D (Figure 4).

Section [IP_ADDRESS]. BID dosing
Rationale for Change: Updated to reflect addition of BID dosing cohort to protocol 
and information how BID dosing will be implemented.
Revised Text:
Schedules that use a shorter recovery  period, e.g., twice Twice daily  (BID) dosing, 
maywillalso be explored initially  in subjects with AML as described in Section 1.3.2.  
This approach will be considered if the safet y, PK, and emerging PD data suggest that a 
sufficient therapeutic exposure cannot be achieved using the initial schedule.  If a shorter 
recovery  period is used, the .  The initial dose level for BID will be 50%a maximum of 
the highest completed 20 mg (ie 2x 20mg 12 hours apart, total daily dose of 40mg) or a 
dose level (at or below MTD) with the initial schedule lower than 20 mg depending on 
emerging safety , PK and PD data and dosing will be separated by  [CONTACT_3450]  12 
hours .  Escalation can then proceed as described using the 3 +3 dose escalation.  
Alternative schedules with intense s upportive care Subjects may  need to undergo dose 
modification(s) to manage toxicities.  A dose adjustment (e.g., QD at the same dose level
or lower BID dose level )may alsobe made after consultation with [COMPANY_004] medical monitor. 
The investigator should use clin ical judgment to determine whether the dosing scheduling 
may be exploredcontributing to any  potential toxicity  necessitating dose adjustment, and 
make the appropriate change after consultation with the [COMPANY_004] Medical Monitor . 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

sampling (pre -dose, 0.5, 3 and 6 -8 hours) at the higher dose, as determined by  [CONTACT_420235] .  Additional safet y assessments may be specified at the time of 
dose escalation or schedule modification based on the safet y profile in previous subjects 
at the higher dose level.
Section 3.2.2. Dose Limiting Toxicity  (DLT)
Rationale for Change: DLT criteria for m yelosuppression were differentiated by 
[CONTACT_420280].
Revised Text:
An event will be considered a DL T if it occurs within the first 3 weeks of treatment and 
meets one of the following criteria unless it can be clearl y established that the event is 
unrelated to treatment.   
Prolonged m yelosuppression, as defined b y the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
criteria specific for leukemia, i.e., marrow cellularity  <5% on day  42 or later 
(6weeks) from start of therap y without evidence of leukemia which can occur 
outside of the 3 week DLT window. follows: 
 For leukemia:
At 6 weeks, bone marrow biopsy  that demonstra tes no evidence of residual 
leukemia AND E ITHER:
Marrow aplasia, defined as <5% cellularity  by [CONTACT_420281] , OR
Peripheral cy topenias, defined as ANC ≤ 500/uL and/or platelets ≤25,000/uL (if 
baseline ANC and/or platelets were > 500/uL and/or 25,000/uL , respectively )
 For m yeloma or l ymphoma:
Grade 4 neutropenia persisting for ≥7 day s or febrile neutropenia in patients 
with my eloma or l ymphoma. not responding to treatment within 24h

217Section 3.2.4. Part 2 AML Expansion Cohort
Rationale for Change: Section was updated to reflect that anal ysis of Part 2 data will 
include anal ysis of Part 1 data; he nce fewer subjects are required for Part 2. Decision 
steps for interim and final analy sis were updated based on the updated number of subjects 
required for analy sis. 
Revised Text:
Up to 4032subjects with specific relapsed and/or refractory  acute m yeloid leukemias
(and/or other subsets), determined based on emerging data (preclinical and clinical data 
from Part 1), may  be enrolled in an expansion cohort at the RP2D.  This will be 
conducted to gather more safet y data and to further assess anti -tumor activit y.  Subjects 
in Part 2 will start with a continuous daily  dosing schedule unless safet y, PK or PD data 
necessitate a different dosing schedule.  The final dose and regimen for Part 2 will be 
decided upon completion of dose escalation in Part 1.
The Phase Part2 portion of the study  will employ  a Bay esian design that allows the trial 
to be monitored with the constraint of both Ty pe I and Ty pe II error rates .  Clinical 
response will be defined as CR, CRp, PR, or morphologic leukemia -free state.
The interim ana lysis will be conducted after efficacy  data at a dose level based on RP2D 
are available on a minimum of 10 patients. An initial total of 20 subjects will be recruited 
at a dose level based on RP2D.  The number of subjects will be increased up to a total of
40 32 depending on the results observed.  The decision rules, specify ing the number of 
subjects with a clinical response needed for continuing enrolment or, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_420137] 4.  The methodology  is based on the predictive probab ility of 
success if enrolment continues to 4032subjects [Lee, 2008].  These rules are intended as 
a guideline.  Actual decisions will depend on the totality  of the data.
For the interim anal ysis at N=17, if observe one or no response in the first evaluabl e 17 
subjects, the enrollment will be stopped due to futility .  Otherwise, the enrolment will 
continue.  For the final analy sis at N=32, if observe at least 7 responses in 32 evaluable 
subjects , sufficient statistical evidence has been provided in favor of declaring response 
rate >30%. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

Section 4.1. Number of Subjects
Rationale for Change: Section was updated to reflect that anal ysis of Part 2 data will 
include anal ysis of Part 1 data; hence fewer subjects are required for Part 2.
Revised Text:
The number of dose levels and the level at which the MTD will be reached cannot be 
determined in advance.  An adequate nu mber of subjects will be enrolled into the study  to 
establish a recommended dose(s) and schedule(s) of [COMPANY_004]525762 for further study .  To 
complete Part 1, it is estimated 20 to 30 evaluable subjects will be enrolled.  Part 2 will 
enroll up to 40 32subjects w ith specific relapsed and/or refractory  acute m yeloid 
leukemias. See Section 11.1 for sample size assumptions.

The primary  goal of Part [ADDRESS_530079] a clinicall y meaningful response rate (defined as 
the percentage of subjects that have achieved a CR, CRp, PR or a morphologic leukemia -
free state ) of 2030% in AML  relative to a 5 10% response rate suggesting no activity .
Symbolically , the null hypothesis is:
H0: RR≤510%
The alternative hy pothesis is:
HA:RR≥20 30%
Bayesian statistics will be employ ed to calculate the predictive probability  that the 
response rate ≥ 20% and 530% at interim and final anal ysis using a weak/non -
informative prior.
To determine a maximal sample size for Part 2, a traditional, 2 -stage Green -Dahlberg 
design [, 1992] was evaluated.  To test the h ypotheses (RR=20% versus RR=5%) b y 
Green -Dahlberg design, 40 subjects would be needed to minimize the Ty pe I (< 5%) and 
Type II error rate (i.e., Po wer > 85%).
Using this sample size, a Bay esian design was evaluated. A Bay esian analy sis expresses 
uncertaint y about a parameter in terms of probability .  A prior is defined to characterize 
the level of knowledge about a parameter before the data are coll ected.  Once the data are 
collected, a posterior distribution is formed using the prior and the likelihood (i.e., the 
data).  A very  weak prior Beta (0.0203, 0.0807) with a mean response rate of 2030% is 
assumed.  Thus, the posterior distribution for the r esponse rate will be primarily  driven by  
[CONTACT_420286]:
Let p denote the response rate, the number of responses in the current n subjects, x, 
follows a binomial distribution, Binomial (n, p).  Taking the Bay esian method and 
combini ng the prior and the likelihood of the observed data x, the posterior distribution of 
the response rate follows a beta distribution, i.e.,
p Beta (0.0203+ x, 0. 0807+ n-x) with the posterior mean (0.0203+ x)/(0. 1 + n).
Starting with a cohort of 2010subjects and allowing for a maximum sample size of 32 
subjects at the RP2D with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_420146] [IP_ADDRESS] 40,this 
Bayesian design will have a tType I error rate Error () of 5%0.04 and 8987% power.   For 
the interim anal ysis at N=20, if the predictive probability  that the response rate ≥20% 
(H1) is small (i.e., less than 2% chance) or equivalent to observe one or no response in 
the first evaluable [ADDRESS_530080] -baseline disease assessment.   
Otherwise, the enrolment will continue to the target The trial will be stopped earl y for 
futility  if the predictive probability  of success ( that the response rate ≥30%) is less than 
1%. If the true response rate is 10%, the average sample size of 40.  For the final anal ysis, 
if the posterior probability  that the response rate of >5% (H0) is large (i.e., greater than  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

Tumor : An increase in the product of two perpendicular diameters of a measured 
lesion by  50% over the size present at entry  on study  or for subjects who respond, 
the size at the time of maximum regression and/or the appearance of new areas of 
malignant disease.   Transformation to a more aggressive histology  (e.g., Richter’s

based on the safet y, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles observed after 
oral administration of [COMPANY_004]525762.  Eligible subjects with relapsed refractory  
hematological malignancies will be enrolled in once dail y (QD) and twice daily 
(BID) dosing cohorts until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is established. Subjects 
may continue treatmen t in the study  until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity , 
or withdrawal of consent.  Part 2 will explore clinical activity  at the MTD or RP2D; 
separate expansion cohorts will be planned for acute my eloid leukemia (AML ), non -
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL, including an exploratory  sub- cohort of subjects with 
myc and BCL2 and/or BCL 6 rearrangements/overexpression [double - and triple- hit

Second paragraph:
The MTD of [COMPANY_004]525762 may  be different for AML , NHL, and MM.  To fully  evaluate 
this, each dose escalation step will be evaluated separatel y for the three disease types.  
Parallel cohorts will commence upon termination of accelerated dose titration (Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]) and follow the 3 + 3 design described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. The MTD in subje cts 
with leukemia may  differ from the MTD in subjects with multiple my eloma and 
lymphoma therefore once the 40 mg dose cohort is cleared in AML, the MTD 
determination of MM and NHL subjects will begin at the 40 mg dose level. ML subjects 
will be enrolled in itially  to determine the MTD for AML . Once the 40 mg dose cohort is 
cleared in AML, the MTD determination of MM and NHL subjects will begin at the 40 
mg dose level.

Revised Text:
In Part 1, an accelerated dose titration will be employ ed with one subject per dose level 
until the first instance of a ≥ Grade 2 drug related non- hematological toxicity , (except for 
a pre -specified Grade 3 non- serious non-hematological drug related adverse event that 
would allow continuation of accelerated dose escalation; Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). During 
accelerated dose titration, there will be a single cohort comprised of all eligible subjects;
parallel cohorts will not be evaluated during this stage. 
Thereafter, subjects will be enrolled in a standard 3+3 design.  Separate dose escalation 
cohorts will be opened for subjects with AML, NHL , MM, as well as for QD and BID 
dosing.
In the accelerate d dose escalation cohorts and the 3+3 dose escalation cohorts, the dose 
will be escalated based on all available data, including PK data and the safety profile of 
prior cohorts, as well as the predicted recommended dose from Neuenschwander 
continual reasse ssment method (N -CRM) design [Neuenschwander, 2009].  N -CRM

MYC plus BCL -2 and/or BCL -6 genes (doub le-and triple -hit ly mphoma) will be 
enrolled.  These subjects will be evaluated separately  for efficacy , but hy potheses will not 
be tested.  See Section 11.1 for description of the plan for analysis of the NHL  cohorts.
Plasma samples for PK evaluation wil l be collected in all subjects.  Plasma samples and 
tumor biopsies other clinical samples (e.g. l ymph node or bone marrow biopsies) will be 
collected pre -and post -study  drug treatment as defined in the Time and Events Table in

evaluation criteria (see Appendix 6, Appendix 7 and Appendix 8).
TheFor each cohort, an interim anal ysis will be conducted after efficacy  data at a dose 
level based on RP2D are available on a minimum of 10 patients subjects in the AML  and 
NHL (no n-DHL) cohorts and a minimum of 13 subjects in the MM cohort. The number 
of subjects will may be increased up to a total of 32 for the AML and NHL(non -DHL) 
cohorts and up to a total of 37 for the MM cohort depending on the results observed ; a 
separate deci sion will be made for each disease cohort.  The decision rules, specify ing the 
number of subjects with a clinical response needed for continuing enrolment or, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_420153] ,are indicated in Figure 5 and Figure 6 Table 4.  The methodology  is based on

enrolment continues to 32 subjects for AML and NHL (non-DHL) and 37 subjects for 
MM [Lee, 2008].  These rules are intended as a guideline.  Actual decisions will depend 
on the totality  of the data.

Additional sampling may be instituted based on emerging data.
Section 6.6. Translational Research
Rationale for Change: The rationale and overall schedule for collection of biological 
samples was added as a reference.
Revised Text:
Blood and or tumor tissue specimens will be collected at various times throughout the 
study  in order to support research aimed at understanding the biological effect of 
[COMPANY_004]525762 and BET inhibition as well as identifying indicators of sensiti vity or 
resistance to [COMPANY_004]525762.
Toward that end the successful collection of quality tumor specimens will be critical to 
furthering our understanding of BET biology  and indentify ing the best way  to treat 
patients with a BET inhibitor. Specificall y, the ev aluation of responders, responders at 
relapse, and non -responders for gene mutation status and/or pathway  activation may  lead 
to the discovery  of potential new diagnostic markers or novel combinations. Similarly , 
pre-and post -dose tumor specimens will be evaluated for markers of target engagement, 
tumor response, and/or evaluated for changes in gene expression; thus supporting 
identification of a biologically  effective dose and furthering our mechanistic 
understanding of BET inhibition in these settings. 
The biopsies will be assessed for transcripts or proteins that reflect BET target 
engagement and/or tumor biology . Biopsies may  also be assessed for DNA, RNA or 
proteins which may  be potential predictors of sensitivity  or resistance to BET inhibition 
based on emerging data.
During the accelerated dose escalation phase (Part 1), fresh pre -and post -dose biopsy  
collections will be optional until the standard 3+3 design is implemented.  During the 3+[ADDRESS_530131] -treatment biopsies are 
mandatory . For subjects in Part 1 and 2, if tumor tissue is not accessible, discussion with 
the [COMPANY_004] medical monitor is required.
Section 6.6.1. Tumor Specific Tissue Collection

The tissue collection to support translational and mechanistic research for Part [ADDRESS_530132] -treatment sam ple collection is defined in the T&E table. See 
Study  Procedures Manual (SPM) and central lab manual for additional details.
All subjects in Part 1 and 2 will be asked to submit the following:
An archival (most recent) tumor specimen in order to conduct re trospective tests 
for the identification of potential markers of sensitivity  or resistance.  This 
exploratory  work may  include protein measurements, mRNA measurements as 
well as DNA (mutation, DNA copy number, translocation) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_18193] (DNA 
methy lation , microRNA) measurements.  Results of previous cy togenetic work 
performed on the subject will also be collected.
A biopsy  at progression or end of treatment, when feasible to collect.
Blood samples collected at various times:
At screening, disease assessme nt and disease progression for plasma isolation 
and study ing circulating biomarkers (eg, cfDNA).
At pre and post dose for treatment related changes in RNA.
At pre and post dose for treatment related changes in plasma cytokines.
A change in frequency  of blo od biomarker sampling times may  be implemented based on

[IP_ADDRESS]. Plasma for Changes in Cytokines, Chemokines, and Acute Phase 
Proteins
The set of analy tes identical to tha t used in the whole blood ex vivo assay  (including for 
example, MCP -1, MI P1-α, IL -8) will also be measured in plasma samples taken during 
PK sampling and at the time of an y Grade [ADDRESS_530133] using biomarkers such as pro-
inflammatory  cytokines and acute phase proteins and correlate the s ystemic response to 
drug with that in stimulated and unstimulated blood. These biomarkers are expected to 
change over day s rather tha n hours, based on the plasma half lives and pre -clinical data, 
such that sampling will also be performed after repeat dosing.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Whole Blood for Changes in mRNA
[COMPANY_004]525762 has been shown to modulate the expression of a number of different genes in 
unstimulated whole blood between 1 h and 6 h. The mRNA levels of 31 such genes form 
a ‘signature’ panel which will also be used as a biomarker of engagement of 
pharmacology  and will be measured using mRNA isolated from whole blood. The 
modulation of a number of these genes will also be measured as changes in sy stemic 
proteins as well as in the anal ysis of the ex vivo assay  blood samples (e.g. CCL2 and IL -
8) thus relating mRNA and protein expression with drug concentration.  Other 
translational research studies, such as transcriptomics profiling, may  also be performed 
using whole blood mRNA from selected patients.Subjects who consent to tumor PD 
assessments will also be required to provide pre -and post -treatment tumor specimens as 
appropriate in order to assess tumor PD response.    The PD tests and tissue required are 
disease specific as outlined below.
For subjects with leukemias, changes in specific protein markers and/or 
mRNA expression signatures will be assessed in bone marrow and/or tumor 
cell-enriched PB MCs isolated from whole blood.
For subjects with l ymphomas, ly mph node biopsies (or bone marrow, if

probabilities utilizing a pre- specified prior distr ibution.
Section 11.1.2. Part 2, Expansion Cohort
Rationale for Change: MM and NHL  cohorts were added to Part 2 and the statistical 
design for Part 2 was clarified in this section.
Revised Text:
The primary  goal of Part 2 is to evaluate disease -specific ef ficacy  in subjects with AML , 
MM, and NHL. 
For AML, efficacy  is defined as detect a clinicall y meaningful response rate (defined 
as the percentage of subjects that have achieved a CR, CRp, PR or a morphologic 
leukemia -free state ) of 30% in AML relative to a 10% response rate suggesting no 
activity .
For MM, efficacy  is defined as a clinically  meaningful response rate (defined as the 
percentage of subjects that have achieved a CR, VGPR, or PR) of 20% relative to a 
5% response rate suggesting no activity .
ForNHL, efficacy  is defined as a clinically  meaningful response rate (defined as the 
percentage of subjects that have achieved a CR, or PR) of 30% relative to a 10% 
response rate suggesting no activity.  For this cohort, double/triple -hit ly mphoma 
subjects w ill be excluded from initial efficacy  analy sis and will be evaluated 
separately .
Bayesian statistics will be employ ed to calculate the predictive probability  that the 
response rate is greater than the historic response rate at interim anal yses using a 
weak /non-informative prior. A Bay esian analy sis expresses uncertaint y about a parameter  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_530142] ed, a 
posterior distribution is formed using the prior distribution and the observed data.  A very  
weak prior Beta distribution with a mean response rate equal to the target response rate is 
assumed.  Thus, the posterior distribution for the response rate will be primarily  driven by  
[CONTACT_420286]:
Let p denote the response rate, the number of responses in the current n subjects, x, 
follows a binomial distribution, Binomial (n, p).  Taking the Bay esian method and 
combining the prior distribution (e.g. Beta (0.03, 0.07)) and the observed data x, the 
posterior distribution of the response rate follows a beta distribution, i.e.
In the following case, 30% is the target response rate.
p Beta (0.03 + x, 0.07 + n- x) with posterior mean (0.03+ x)/(0.07 + n).
Futility  anal ysis for each disease cohort will begin when response data is available for at 
least 10 subjects. Each disease cohort may  be stopped earl y for futility  if the predictive 
probability  of success ( response rate ≥  historical response rate) is less than 1%.  Futility

For the AML and NHL disease cohorts, >Symbolically , the null hy pothesis is:
H0: RR≤10%
The alternative hy pothesis is:
HA:RR≥30 %
Bayesian statistics will be employ ed to calculate the predictive probability  that the 
response rate ≥30% at interim and final anal ysis using a weak/non -informative prior. A 
Bayesian anal ysis expresses uncertaint y about a parameter in terms of probability .  A 
prior is defined to characterize the level of knowledge about a parameter before the data 
are collected.  Once the data are collected, a posterior distribution is formed using the 
prior and the likelihood (i.e., the data).  A very  weak prior Beta (0.0 3, 0.07) with a mean 
response rate of 30% is assumed.  Thus, the posterior distribution for the response rate 
will be primarily  driven by  [CONTACT_420286]:
Let p denote the response rate, the number of responses in the current n subje cts, x,

PGx Associations with Safety Events
Third paragraph:
Collection of whole blood saliva samples, may  enable PGx analy sis to be conducted if at 
any time it appears that there is a potential unexpected or unexplained variation in 
handling or response to [COMPANY_004]525762.
Study Assessments and Procedures
In addition to any  blood samples taken for the clinical study , a whole blood A saliva
sample (~10mL) will be collected for the PGx research using a nOragene DNA self 
collection tube containing eth ylenediaminetetra acetic acid (EDTA) .  It is recommended 
that the blood saliva sample be taken at the first opportunity  after a subject has been 
randomized and provided informed consent for PGx research day 1, but may be taken at 
any time while the subject is participating i n the clinical study  after the subjects provided 
informed consent for the PGx research .
The PGx sample is labelled (or “coded”) with a study  specific number that can be traced 
or linked back to the subject b y the investigator or site staff.  Coded samples do not carry  
personal identifiers (such as name [CONTACT_78207]).  The blood saliva sample is 
taken on a single occasion unless a duplicate sample is required due to inability  to utilize 
the original sample.
The DNA extracted from the blood saliva sample may  be subjected to sample quality  
control anal ysis.  This analy sis will involve the genoty pi[INVESTIGATOR_420166] y of individual samples.  If inconsistencies are noted in the anal ysis, 
then those samples may  be des troyed.

Screen and Baseline Failures
If a blood sample for PGx research has been collected and it is determined that the 
subject does not meet the entry  criteria for participation in the clinical study, then the 
investigator m ust complete the appropriate documentation to request sample destruction 
within the timeframe specified b y [COMPANY_004] and maintain the documentation in the site study 
records.
Informed Consent
Subjects who do not wish to participate in the PGx research may  still participate in the 
clinical study .  PGx informed consent must be obtained prior to an y blood sample being 
taken for PGx research. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

contraception methods (described in Section 9.1) for an appropriate peri od of 
time (as determined b y the product label or investigator) prior to the start of

subjects must agree to use contraception until at least [ADDRESS_530147] dose of study  medication.
Inclusion criteria 9: Male subjects must agree to use one of the methods of contraception 
specified.  This method must be used from the time of the first dose of study  medication 
until least [ADDRESS_530148] continue to use 
condoms for 7 day s after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_420167].
DOSAGE/DOSAGE FORM, ROUTE, AND DOSE REGIMEN: 
Rationale for Change: The original dos ing schedule (1,3,5,7) was designed to include 
a dosing break over the course of the first week to monitor for an y potential immediate 
toxicities before moving into continuous daily  dosing in the second week. As included in 
the rationale for removal of [ADDRESS_530149] was noted, however this did not lead to 
any marked prolongation and there were no individual subjects with delta >60ms or QTc 
>500ms. 
In an effort to achieve an optimal dosing schedule and further explore alternate dosing 
schedules (i.e.; two weeks of dosing, followed b y one week off stud y drug), the 
intermittent dosing was modified to allow subjects to begin continuous daily  dosing on 
Day 1. 
Revised Text:
Starting dose will be 5 mg, orally  (tablets), once a day .  Dose escalations will be 
performed in Part 1 and dose adjustments are allowed to address tolerability  and 
safet y issues.  BID dosing will be explored in a parallel cohort. Alternate dosing 
schedules e.g. intermittent dosing )may be required to manage toxicities and 
may be considered based on investigator assessment and after consultation with 
[COMPANY_004]; and may  be implemented if the safety , pharmacokinetic (PK), and 
pharmacod ynamic (PD) data suggest that a sufficient therapeutic exposure 
cannot be achieved using the protocol schedule and after without requiring a 
protocol amendment.
SAFETY MEASUREMENTS :  
Rationale for Change: After an internal QTc analysis and evaluation of cardiac safety 
data collected from all subjects up to the [ADDRESS_530150] 48 hours of treatment.Therefore the 
inpatient telemetry  on W1D1 and W1D2 was discontinued. Although the presence of a  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_530151] was noted, this did not lead to any  marked

in-patient telemetry  will only  be required on serial ECG/PK day s at sites that are unable 
to collect after -hours PK timepoi nts as outpatient.
Revised Text:
Routine phy sical examinations, vital sign measurements, echocardiograms, and 
monitoring of adverse events will be performed.  Stringent C ardiac safety  
monitoring will be required, consisting of at least [ADDRESS_530153] dose (overnight stay s in research facility  necessary ),24 hours 
of Holter monitoring at Screening, Week 1, and Week 4, and triplicate 12-lead 
ECGs prior to dosing on selected days and prior to drawing PK samples on 
serial PK sampling day s(overnight stay s in research facilit y ma y be necessary in 
Part 1).  Laboratory  testing includes, in addition to standard hematology , clinical 
chemistry , pancreatic, coagulation, and liver chemistry  panels, testing for 
troponin, N -terminal prohormone B- type Natriuretic Peptide (NT pro- BNP), c -
peptide, 1,5 -Anhydroglucitol (1, 5 AG), Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and thyroid

(decreased fetal body weight, fetal 
malformations or variations and / or pre -and 
post-implantation loss) occurred in rats given 
[COMPANY_004]525762 ≥1mg/kg/day from conception 
through gestation day 17 (of 21 days) and 
when dosed at ≥10 mg/kg/day for 14 days 
and dosing stopped prior to mating or 
continued until Day 6 pc. Systemic exposure 
in rats was approximately 80 -fold lower than 
current exposure in late stage cancer patients 
(at 60 mg/day). These results are consistent 
with observations that BRD2, BRD3, 
BRD4 and BRDT have crucial roles in 
reproduction and development [see the [COMPANY_004] 
525762 IB [GlaxoSmithKline Document 
Number 2011N113741_03] for references.
Based on the findings in these reproductive 
and developmental toxicity studies in rats with 
[COMPANY_004]525762, there is a substantiated risk for 
adverse effects on embryofetal development 
and imp acts on female fertility.
Section 3.2.1 .1. Dose Escalation and Schedule
Rationale for Change:   The original dosing schedule was designed to include a dosing 
break during the first week to monitor for an y potential immediate toxicities before 
moving into continuous daily  dosing in the second week. As included in the rationale for 
removal of 48- hour telemetry  and reduction of holter monitoring frequency , after an 
internal QTc anal ysis and evaluation of cardiac safety  data collected from all subjects up 
to the [ADDRESS_530160] was noted, however this did not lead to any  marked prolongation and 
there were no individual subjects with delta >60ms or QTc >500ms. 
In an effort to achieve an optimal dosing schedule and further ex plore alternate dosing 
schedules (i.e.; two weeks of dosing, followed b y one week off stud y drug), the 
intermittent dosing was modified to allow subjects to begin continuous daily  dosing on 
Day 1.  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

A staggered dosing schedule will be implemen ted to monitor for safet y including an y 
delay ed toxicity .  This approach allows repeat dosing in a step -wise fashion to detect 
changes in safet y, such as cardiotoxicity .  Based on a low risk of drug accumulation and 
the aggressive nature of relapsed and/or refractory hematologic malignancies, a three 
week period will be used for DLT monitoring and dose escalation decision making.  
Alternative dosing regimens and/or schedule may  be implemented based on emerging PK 
and safet y data and after without requiring a protocol amendment.
In Part 1, subjects will follow the dose schedule outlined below in Table 1 .  Alternative 
dosings regimens and/or schedule may  be implemented based on emerging PK and safet y 
data.   Specifically , in Week [ADDRESS_530161] will start daily  dosing which will 
continue until study completion (Section 4.2.3).
Extensive monitoring for cardiac safety  signals will be performed including in -subject 
teleme try during the first 48 hours after initial study  treatment as well as triplicate 12 -lead 
ECG and 24- hour Holter monitoring on the day s indicated in Table 1.

cohorts may be stopped.
Section 4.2.1. Inclusion Criteria
Ration ale for Change: Based on emerging data from pre -clinical fetal and embry o

subject number, age, and sex), treatment assignment, and study  day when Holter data
ECGs were collected.  The final intervals and morphology  anal yses entered into the 
database will be those generated b y the central ECG laboratory.
Baseline QT/QTcF values will be determined on Study  Day  -1 using time matched ECG s 
obtained from the Holter monitor at approximately  the same time points as described in 
the Section 5 Time and Events.  The mean from triplicate ECGs will be evaluated at each 
time point.  For a given time point, the mean QTcF from 3 separate beats should be 
analyzed on each ECG.  Analy sis of Lead II will be conducted with V5 as back -up and 
one of the remaining precordial leads as an alternative when T waves are not well defined 
in Leads II or V5.  QTcF for an individual beat will be calculated from the pr eceding RR 
interval since using the average heart rate (RR) intervals from the ECG could result in 
inaccurate QTcF calculations due to beat to beat variations in the RR intervals.
QT values should not be reported when the rh ythm is other than sinus rhy thm (sinus 
rhythm with normal respi[INVESTIGATOR_420173]), and in intraventricular

Rationale for Change: This section was revised to inc lude both amorphous free base 
and cry stalline bes ylate formulations of [COMPANY_004]525762 in the study .
Revised Text:
[COMPANY_004]525762 tablets will be provided to sites by  [CONTACT_23983].  The contents of the label will be in 
accordance with all applicable regulatory  requirements. An amorphous, free -base 
formulation of [COMPANY_004]525762 (Table 14) and a cry stalline, besy late formulation ( Table 15) 
will be utilized.   
In the BET115521 stud y, a sub- study  was conducted to evaluate the PK characteristics of 
the new bes ylate formulation. This sub -study  was an open- label, randomized, single dose, 
four period, cross over sub- study  performed to investigate the relative bioavailability  of 
the besy late tablet compared to the amorphous free -base tablet, the effect of high -fat 
high-calorie meal on the bioavailability  of the besy late tablet and the dose proportionality  
of two doses of [COMPANY_004]525762 administered as bes ylate tablets.  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_530174] on the overall exposure (i.e. AUC) to [COMPANY_004]525762 administered as

The fasting requirement is t hus no longer necessary in subjects taking the besy late 
formulation in Part 2.  
Either amorphous or besylate tablets may  be used in Part 1, based on the bioequivalence 
described above.  During the DLT observation period, subjects will only  receive one or 
the other formulation; any individual cohort will only  enrol subjects receiving a single 
formulation ty pe.  Upon completion of the DLT observation window, subjects may  be

STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION:  
Rationale for Change: Twice daily  dosing will no longer be completed prior to 
determining the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) if a twice daily  dosing is explored this 
will occur after the MTD/R2PD has been determined.
Revised Text:
Eligible subjects with select relapsed refractory  hematological malignancies(acute 
myeloid leukemia [AML], non- Hodgkin’s Lymphoma [NHL ]and multiple 
myeloma [MM]),   will be enrolled in once dail y (QOD) and/or twice dail y (BID)

toxicity , or withdrawal of consent.  Upon determination of the MTD, twice daily  
(BID) dosing cohorts may be opened to collect additional safety  data and evaluate 
the preliminary  efficacy  of [COMPANY_004]525762 administered BID.
STUDY RATIONALE
Rationale for Change: This section was updated to further clarify the disease 
subty pes.  
Revised Test: 
Current data from [COMPANY_004]525762 preclinical development indicate a potential to inhibit the 
BET family  of bromodomain (BRD) proteins and that this inhibition may  have clinical 
utility  in the treatment of various tumors, including hematological malignancies. 
Relapsed and/or refractory hematological malignancies such as Acute M yeloid L eukemia 
(AML), Adult Acute Lymphoblastic L eukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma 
(NHL ), andMultiple Myeloma (MM) and high -risk My elodysplastic S yndromes (MDS)
have an overall poor outlook. This is the first study  of this agent to be conducted in 
subjects with these relapsed and/o r refractory  hematological malignancies for which no 
standar d therapi[INVESTIGATOR_420136] a durable remission with few or no 
conventional treatment options that could be expected to provide an y lasting benefit . 
OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS:
Rationale for Change: This section was updated to remove twice dai ly dosing from 
the primary  objectives, Overall response rate and safet y and tolerability were added as 
secondary  endpoints and metabolite and urine excretion endpoints have been removed 
from exploratory  research.

[COMPANY_004]525762 is eliminated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_420135]- life of 3 to 7 hours ,

single oral administration and repeated once dail y administration of 2 mg to 60 mg of 
[COMPANY_004]525762, C maxand AUC tended to increase in a dose proportional fashion .
Based on the pharmacokinetics of [COMPANY_004]525762 observed to date, and evidence of a short 
half-life of about 5 hours, trough concentrations at 100 mg QD are predicted to be below 
the average in vitro IC50 (0.08 uM to 1.3 uM) for the tumor ty pes selected for this study . 
Furthermore, based on the pharmacokinetics to date, it is predicted that even 100 mg QD 
doses would result in the trough concentrations below the average in vitro IC50.   
Dividing the dail y dose into two doses administered about 12 hours apart would allow the 
trough concentration to be above the lower in vitro IC50 for doses around 30 mg BID.

Potential Risk of 
Clinical 
Significan ceData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
Drug Interactions There is low potential for [COMPANY_004]525762 to 
induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
enzymes or to inhibit P -glycoprotein (Pgp) or 
Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP).
The precise in vivo metabolic liability for 
[COMPANY_004]525762 has yet to be assessed.  In vitro
data suggests that [COMPANY_004]525762 has a 
negligible turnover and low potential to inhibit 
the major human CYP isoforms (IC50s ≥ 33 
μM) with no evidence for time dependent 
inhibition of CYP2D6 or CY P3A4.
[COMPANY_004]525762 is a substrate for CYP3A4 
enzymes, and for P -gp and BCRP 
transporters. 
[COMPANY_004]525762 clearance is virtually solely via 
CYP3A4.  There is evidence of potential auto -
induction after repeat dosing in clinical studies 
since reduction in parent exp osures (~25% at 
lower doses to ≥60% at doses ≥60mg, mainly 
in BET115521 study) have been observed.
There is low potential for [COMPANY_004]525762 to 
induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
enzymes or to inhibit P -glycoprotein (Pgp) or 
Breast Cancer Resistance Protei n (BCRP) 
based on in vitro data. [COMPANY_004]525762 was 
shown to be an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and 
OAT3 in vitro.The potential for drug -drug 
interactions will be monitored in 
clinical trials.
Use of concomitant medications, 
herbal medicines and fruit juices 
that are strong or moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers 
should be avoided during the 
course of the study where possible 
as they may respectively decrease 
or increase exposure to 
[COMPANY_004]525762.
Use of concomitant medications 
that are sensitive substrates of 
OATP1B1 a nd OAT3 should be 
done with caution.

Third and fourth paragraph
Subjects may need to undergo dose modification(s) to manage toxicities.  A dose 
adjustment may  be made after consultation with the [COMPANY_004] medical monitor. The 
investigator should use clinical judgment to determine whether the dosing scheduling 
may be contributing to any  potential toxicity  necessitating dose adjustment, and make the 
appropriate change after consultation with the [COMPANY_004] Medical Monitor.
In Part 2, subjects approved to alter their current dose level with either a dose reduction 
or dose escalation may  require ad ditional limited PK sampling (pre- dose, 0.5, and 3 
hours) at the new dose level, after 4 -7 day s at the adjusted dose level .
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. BID Dosing 
Rationale for Change: This section was updated to clarify  that BID dosing will occur 
after MTD is deter mined per disease subt ype.  
Revised Text:
Once the MTD of QD administration has been identified for a disease subty pe, a cohort 
may be opened to explore the safety , tolerability , PK, and efficacy  of [COMPANY_004]525762 when 
administered BID.  Initially , only  one cohort per disease t ype is planned, though lower 
doses may  be explored based on toxicity  observed after the initial few subjects.  The 
selected total dail y dose (administered in two approximately  equal doses) for BID 
administration will not exceed the QD MTD .  A lower starting dose may  be selected The 
initial dose level for BID will be a maximum of 20 mg (ie 2x 20mg 12 hours apart, total 
daily  dose of 40mg) or a dose level lower than 20 mg depending on emerging safet y, PK 
and PD data .and d Dosing will be separ ated by  [CONTACT_3450]  12 hours.  Escalation can 
then proceed as described using the 3 +3 dose escalation. The total number of evaluable 
subjects per disease type treated BID will not exceed 10 subjects.
Subjects may  need to undergo dose modification(s) to manage toxicities.  A dose 
adjustment (e.g., QD at the same dose level or lower BID dose level ) may be made after 
consultation with the [COMPANY_004] medical monitor. The investigator should use clinical 
judgment to determine whether the dosing scheduling may  be c ontributing to any  
potential toxicity  necessitating dose adjustment, and make the appropriate change after 
consultation with the [COMPANY_004] Medical Monitor.
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Intra -Subject Dose Escalation 
Rationale for Change: Minor updates were made to this section to further clarify  
when an intra -subject dose escalation may  occur. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

332Revised Text:
First and second sentence of first paragraph
Intra -subject dose escalations may  be considered on a case -by-case basis, provided that a 
higher dose level cohort (accelerat ed phase or 3+3 phase) has been cleared without a 
DLT, and after review of all safet y data and approval by a [COMPANY_004] Medical Monitor and 
discussion with the investigator.  The subject on a lower dose level may  be increased up 
to the highest dose level testedcl eared.  
Section 3.2.2. Dose Limiting Toxicity  (DLT) 
Rationale for Change: This section was updated to clearl y define the percentage of 
doses a subject must receive to be evaluable and to further clarify  Dose limiting 
toxicities.
Revised Text:
First paragraph
An event will be considered a DLT if it occurs within the first 3 weeks of treatment and 
meets one of the following criteria unless it can be clearl y established that the event is 
unrelated to treatment.  As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], subjects unab le to receive at least 
75% of scheduled doses for reasons other than toxicity  (e.g., acute illness, disease 
progression) will not be evaluable for DLT purposes and will be replaced in the cohort.
Third paragraph
Grade 4 thrombocy topenia lasting more than 7 day and do not responding to 
transfusions, or Grade 3 thrombocy topenia associated with bleeding (>10mL) 
Third bullet of third paragraph
Grade 2 Troponin T elevation (central laboratory  >Upper Limit of Normal [UL N]), 
measured on two separate occasions wit hin 48 hours in order to confirm elevation and
with other clinical signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory tests consistent with cardiac
toxicity .  In the event a troponin T [central laboratory  assessment] is not performed or a 
laboratory  error occurs, consider ations for a DLT criterion will involve review of two 
separate local troponin (I or T) assay s done within 48 hours at a local investigator site.  
Troponin I or T elevations greater than the upper limit of normal, and > 10% coefficient 
of variance (CV) for that assay  will be considered as a Grade 2 elevation).
Section 3.2.3. Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 
Dose (RP2D)
Rationale for Change: Minor update was made to further clarify that a separate RP2D 
will be determined per disease t ype. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

Second sentence
The RP2D will be determined based on the MTD or biologicall y active dose (example: 
clinical response), the safety  profile, and available PD data generated from all subjects in 
Part1 for that disease t ype.  
Section 4.1 Number of Subjects 
Rationale for Change: Added reference for evaluable subjects.
Revised Text:
The number of dose levels and the level at which the MTD will be reached cannot be 
determined in advance.  An adequate number of subjects will be enrolled into the st udy to 
establish a recommended dose(s) and schedule(s) of [COMPANY_004]525762 for further study .  To 
complete Part 1, it is estimated 60 to 70 evaluable (as described in Section 11) subjects 
will be enrolled.  Part 2 will enroll up to 111 subjects (three disease- specific cohorts of 32 
to 37 subjects each, depending on disease subty pe, and one disease -specific cohort of 10 
subjects)

Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Subject C ompletion
Rationale for Change: This section was modified to clearl y define in Part [ADDRESS_530200] who has completed the study .
Revised Text:
In Part 1, a subject will be considered to have completed the study  if:
they complete screening assessment s, the 21- day DLT observation period, and the 
end-of-treatment follow -up visit,
they progress or die while receiving stud y treatment, or
are receiving ongoing study  treatment at the time of the Sponsor’s decision to 
close the study .
In Part 2, a subject wi ll be considered to have completed the study  if:
they progressed or die while receiving study  treatment, or
are receiving ongoing study  treatment at the time of the Sponsor’s decision to 
close the study .
Subjects who have not died, and are no longer being followed for survival are considered 
to have discontinued the study .  A subject will be considered to have withdrawn from the 
study  if the subject has not died and is lost to follow -up, has withdrawn consent, or at the 
investigator’s discretion is no longe r being followed .  The End of Study  eCRF should 
only be completed when a subject is no longer being followed.  The study  may  be 
considered completed for purposes of a final anal ysis when 70% of subjects enrolled in 
Part [ADDRESS_530201] progressed or died.  If avail able, subjects continuing on treatment at the time 
of final anal ysis may  be offered the option to continue in a rollover trial.For Part 1 (dose -
escalation phase) subjects who are nottreated with the RP2D, a completed subject is one 
who has completed the s tudy [ADDRESS_530202] dies or is 
still in follow -up at the time the study is closed or terminated, whichever is sooner.  
For subjects treated at the RP2D (subset of Part 1 and all of Part 2), a completed subject 
is one who has discontinued study  treatment and was followed to death or has died while 
receiving stud y treatment.  
Document the cause of death in the CRF.  A subject will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study if the subject has not died and is lost to fo llow-up, has 
withdrawn consent, or at the investigator’s discretion is no longer being followed. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

In vitro data suggests that [COMPANY_004]525762 is only  metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]3A4 and thus 
coadministration of inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be avoided during the 
course of the stud y where possible as they  may  respectively  decrease or increase 
exposure to [COMPANY_004]525762. G SK525762 is considered to have a low risk of causing

enzy mes and/or PgP, BCRP, OATP1B3, OAT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2 -K, BSEP or 
MRP2 transporters either via direct or metabolism -dependent inhibition. Potential 
interactions with other Cy tochrome P450 metabolized drugs have not been assessed.
[COMPANY_004]525762 was shown to be an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OAT3 in vitro, however, the 
clinical impact of this inhibition is only  deemed a concern f or sensitive substrates of 
OATP1B1 or OAT3 (e.g. methotrexate).
[COMPANY_004]525762 has low potential to inhibit the major human CYP isoforms (IC50’s ≥ 33

samples collected on the sp ecified day s will be used to assess attainment of steady  state.  
To estimate the extent of accumulation after repeat dosing, the observed accumulation 
ratio (Ro) may  be determined from the ratio of AUC(0 -) in Week 2 Day  7 / AUC(0- ) in 
Week 1 Day  1.  The ratio of AUC(0 -) on Week 2 Day  7 / Week 1 Day  1 AUC(0- ∞) will 
be calculated to assess time invariance.  [COMPANY_004]525762 concentrations will be determined 
in urine samples to determine urinary  recovery  of unchanged drug and renal clearance.
Plasma concentration- time data will b e listed by  [CONTACT_2715], dosing regimen, and summarized 
using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum and 
maximum) by  [CONTACT_420260].  Mean and/ or median values will be 
plotted over time.  Individual plasma and urinary  (if available) PK parameters values as 
well as a descriptive summary  (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, 
geometric mean, and the standard deviation, CV% and 95% confidence interval of log -
transformed parameters [if applicable]) b yday, dose and dose regimen cohort will be 
reported.
Cmax and AUC (AUC(0- ∞), single dose, and AUC(0 -), stead y state) will be plotted as a 
function of the dose administered and dosing regimen.  If more than 2 dose cohorts are 
evaluated, dose proportionalit y of AUC and Cmax for [COMPANY_004]525762 will be assessed using 
the power model (details will be provided in the RAP).
Plasma concentration-time data from Parts 1 and 2 will be combined and may be 
combined with data from other studies and further anal yzed using a population approach.  
A nonlinear mixed effects model will be used to determine population PK parameters 
(absorption rate, Ka, apparent clearance, CL/F and volume of distribution, V/F) and 
summary  exposure measures (Cmax, AUC and Average observed concentrat ion 
(Cav) =AUC/ ) and identify  important covariates (e.g., age, weight, or disease related 
covariates). This anal ysis may  be reported separately .

2017) from the Protocol A mendment 7 (23 -JUN -2016)
Where the Amendment Applies
Amendment 8applies to all study  centres. 
General Protocol Changes
Amendment 8: 
The study population for the AML  cohort in Part 2 was amended from a populati on of 
subjects with AML  to a population of subjects with relapsed or refractory  
myelodysplastic s yndrome (MDS )or hypoproliferative AML that has arisen from an 
antecedent MDS. The Part 2 primary  and secondary  objectives along with the eligibility  
criteria were updated to include this new population.   The safet y assessments were 
updated to be in line with the I nvestigator Brochure. The dose limiting toxicity  criteria 
were modified to remove the specific criteria for leukemia. The time and events tables 
were updated to reduce the cardiac monitoring (ecg, holter and troponin), remove mRNA 
and cy tokine collection, add a Pain Assessment, addition of an exploratory  translational 
research blood draw and to add Factor VII assay  collection. The disease related 
events/outcomes section was removed and the pregnancy  reporting timeframe was 
reduced to 24 hours. Fever was removed from the dose adjusting/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_420069] y 
criteria. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_219213]- steroidal -anti-inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs ) were added to the 
Cautionary  medications. Response Criteria for MDS was added as an Appendix.
GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2011N113741_03 Version 3 changed to 
GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2011N113741_05 Version 5 throughout the 
document.
Table numbers are updated (Figure no.1 becomes Table no. 1 Three Week DL T 
monitoring: Dosing Schedule and Cardiac Monitoring (QD and BID) and Table No.1  
Accelerated Dose Escalation Procedures in Part 1is deleted, all other Table numbers are 
same). Figure numbers are updated throughout the doc ument (Figure no. 2 now becomes 
Figure no. 1, Figure no. 3 becomes Figure no. 2 and so on). Minor clarifications, 
formatting and ty pographical errors were also addressed in this amendment.
Changes are noted below with strikethrough to identify  deleted text and underlining to 
identify  new or replacement text .
PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS
STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION:  
Rationale for Change: After an evaluation of data from the Part 1 AML cohort, the 
following observations prompted changes to the Part 2 cohort: clinical re sponses were 
observed at doses of [ADDRESS_530247] subjects with AML  discontinued [COMPANY_004]525762  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

379early in the course of their treatment as a consequence of their underl ying AML  or 
disease complications. Responses tended to be delay ed (at the four week mark or l ater, 
with many  requiring more than [ADDRESS_530248]). Thus, most subjects were not 
remaining on stud y for long enough to achieve benefit. In order to maximize time on -
study , Part 2 was updated to enroll subjects with a more slowly-progressing diseas e that 
maintained man y of the clinical characteristics of the AML responses that were observed 
in Part 1.
Revised Text:
Part 2 will explore clinical activity  at the MTD or RP2D; separate expansion cohorts will 
be planned for myeloid malignancies (high-risk myelodysplastic s yndrome [MDS] or
acute m yeloid leukemia [AML ]that has evolved from an antecedent MDS, hereafter 
referred as the “m yeloid cohort” ), non -Hodgkin’s Ly mphoma (NHL, including an 
exploratory  sub- cohort of subjects with my c and B -Cell L eukemia (BCL)2 and/or BCL6 
rearrangements/overexpression [double - and triple- hit ly mphoma]), and multiple 
myeloma (MM).
STUDY RATIONALE:
Rationale for Change: This section was updated to include the MDS Population.
Revised Text:
Relapsed and/or refractory hematolo gical malignancies such as MDS , Acute My eloid 
Leukemia (AML ), non-Hodgkin’s Ly mphoma( NHL ), and Multiple My eloma (MM) have 
an overall poor outlook. This is the first study  of this agent to be conducted in subjects 
with these relapsed and/o r refractory  hemat ological malignancies with few or no 
conventional treatment options that could be expected to provide an y lasting benefit.

Section 1. 2. Study  Population Rationale
Rationale for Change:  After an evaluation of data from the Part 1 AML cohort, the 
following observations prompted changes to the Part 2 cohort: cli nical responses were 
observed at doses of [ADDRESS_530255] subjects with AML  discontinued [COMPANY_004]525762 
early in the course of their treatment as a consequence of their underl ying AML  or

Revised Text:
MDS and AML  are related neoplasms of m yeloid cells characterized by [CONTACT_420305], as wel l as ineffective hematopoiesis leading 
to peripheral cy topenias.  MDS and AML  exist along a spectrum defined by [CONTACT_420306], with > 20% delineating the boundary  between the two 
diseases.  While AML  may  arise de novo, it may  also evolve from an antecedent 
myelodysplasia or m yeloproliferative s yndrome.  Both AML and MDS are increasingl y

in rats and dogs and the effects contributed to 
the definition of severely toxic repeat dose in 
rats (30 mg/kg).
The effects manifested as hypocellularity in 
bone marrow, thymus, spleen and lymph 
nodes; decreased s pleen and thymic weight; 
mild hemolysis; decreased white cell

weeks following a 17 week off dose period .
Changes relating to coagulation were evident 
in both rats (considered non -adverse) and 
dogs (considered adverse at 3 mg/kg/day).  
These included a reduction in platelet counts 
(54%) and an increase in activated partial

and/or 25,000/uL , respectively )
Section 3.2.4. Part 2: Disease Specific Expansion Cohorts
Rationale for Cha nge: This section was updated to include the MDS population.
Revised Text:
Up to 32 subjects (per cohort) with acute m yeloid leukemia myelody splastic sy ndrome or 
non-Hodgkin’s ly mphoma (non- DHL), and up to [ADDRESS_530266] 10 subjects with tumor that is positive for rearrangement or overexpression of 
MYC plus BCL -2 and/or BCL -6 genes (double -and triple -hit ly mphoma) will be 
enrolled.  These subjects will be evaluated separately  for efficacy , but hy potheses will not 
be tested.  See Section 11.1 for description of the plan for analy sis of the NHL  cohorts.
Plasma samples for PK evaluation will be col lected in all subjects.  Plasma samples and 
other clinical samples (e.g. l ymph node or bone marrow biopsies) will be collected pre-
and post -study  drug treatment as defined in the Time and Events Table in Section 5 for 
the PD evaluation.
The Part 2 portio n of the study will employ  a Bay esian design that allows the trial to be 
monitored with the constraint of both Ty pe I and Ty pe II error rates .  Clinical response  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_530267] evaluation criteria (see Appendix 6 , Appendix 7 and 
Appendix 8 ).
For each cohort, an interim analy sis will be conducted after efficacy  data at a dose level 
based on RP2D are available on a minimum of 10 subjects in the AML MDS and NHL 
(non-DHL) cohorts and a minimum of 13 subjects in the MM cohort. The number of 
subjects may be increased up to a total of 32 for the AML MDS and NHL (non- DHL) 
cohorts and up to a total of 37 for the MM cohort depending on the results observed; a 
separate decision will be made for each disease cohort.  The decision rules, specify ing the 
number of subjects with a clinical response needed for continuing enrolment or, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_420153] , are indicated in Figure 4 and Figure 5 .  The methodology  is based on the 
predictive probability  of success ( response rate > historical response rate) if enrolm ent 
continues to 32 subjects for AMLMDS and NHL (non-DHL) and 37 subjects for MM 
[Lee, 2008].  These rules are intended as a guideline.  Actual decisions will depend on the 
totality  of the data.
For AML MDS and NHL (non-DHL) cohorts: Ten subjects will be en rolled in each 
cohort at the RP2D to examine safet y and efficacy.  If zero responses are observed in 
either cohort, then that cohort will be terminated and no further subjects will be enrolled 
due to futility . A single response in a cohort will be adequate to pursue further enrolment. 
The number of observed confirmed responses will guide further enrolment according to 
the rules summarized in Figure 4 . A maximum of 32 subjects per cohort will be enrolled 
at the RP2D.  All available data will be considered in making enrolment decisions.

Revised Text
Toward that end the successful collection of quality tumor specimens will be critical to 
furthering our understanding of BET biology  and indentify ing the best way  to treat 
patients with a BET inhibitor. Specificall y, the evaluation of responders, responders at 
relapse, and non -responders for gene mutation status and/or pathway  activation may  lead 
to the discovery  of potential new diagnosti c markers or novel combinations. Similarly , 
pre-and post -dose tumor specimens will be evaluated for markers of target engagement, 
tumor response, and/or evaluated for changes in gene expression; thus supporting 
identification of a biologically  effective d ose and furthering our mechanistic 
understanding of BET inhibition in these settings. I n certain settings such as myeloid 
malignancies leukemia specimens, samples may  be used to evaluate changes in leukemic 
stem cell populations or to generate PDX models.

Section [IP_ADDRESS] Whole Blood for Changes in mRNA
[COMPANY_004]525762 has been shown to modulate the expression of a number of different genes in 
unstimulated whole blood between 1 h and 6 h. The mRNA levels of 31 such genes form 
a ‘signature’ panel which will also be used as a biomarker of engage ment of 
pharmacology  and will be measured using mRNA isolated from whole blood. The 
modulation of a number of these genes will also be measured as changes in sy stemic 
proteins as well as in the anal ysis of the ex vivo assay  blood samples (e.g. CCL2 and IL -
8) thus relating mRNA and protein expression with drug concentration.  Other 
translational research studies, such as transcriptomics profiling, may  also be performed 
using whole blood mRNA from selected patients.

by [CONTACT_23983]525762 Pharmacokinetics
Rationale for Change: This section updated in response to new pharmacokinetic data.
Revised Text:
In vitro data suggests that [COMPANY_004]525762 is only  metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]3A4 and thus 
coadministration of potent inducers and moderate or potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should 
be avoided during the course of the stud y where possible as they may respectively 
decrease or increase exposure to [COMPANY_004]525762. 
[COMPANY_004]525762 is a moderate CYP3A4 inducer. Medications that have a narrow therapeutic 
index and that are substrates of CYP3A4 should be administered with caution, as their 
metabolism may  be affected by  [CONTACT_3252]-administration with [COMPANY_004]525762 and result in 
decreased exposure. These include alfentanil, cy closporine, dihy droergot amine, 
ergotamine, fentan yl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, and theophy lline.
[COMPANY_004]525762 is a substrate for breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and P -glycoprotein 
(Pgp) transporters. Therefore, potent inhibitors of these transporters, such as 
cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or ketoconazole, should be avoided. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

423[COMPANY_004]525762 is an inhibitor of organic anion transporter 1A1 (OAT1) and organic anion 
transporter 3 (OAT3) in vitro. Substrates of these transporters include agents such as 
methotrexate, penicillin G, and indomethacin. While co-administration of these agents 
with [COMPANY_004]525762 is not prohibited, they  should be used with caution and additional 
monitoring for adverse effects should be utilized.
[COMPANY_004]525762 is considered to have a low risk of causing clinicall y relevant perpetrator 
drug interactions with CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 enzy mes and/or PgP, BCRP, 
OATP1B3, OAT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2 -K, BSEP or MRP2 transporters either via 
direct or metabolism- dependent inhibition. Potential interactions with othe r Cytochrome 
P450 metabolized drugs have not been assessed.
[COMPANY_004]525762 was shown to be an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OAT3 in vitro, however, the 
clinical impact of this inhibition is only  deemed a concern for sensitive substrates of 
OATP1B1 or OAT3 (e.g. meth otrexate).

Section 11.1.2 Pa rt2, Expansion Cohort
Rationale for Change: After an evaluation of data from the Part 1 AML cohort, the 
following obse rvations prompted changes to the Part 2 cohort: clinical responses were 
observed at doses of [ADDRESS_530316] subjects with AML  discontinued [COMPANY_004]525762 
early in the course of their treatment as a consequence of their underl ying AML  or 
disease complications. Responses tended to be delay ed (at the four week mark or later, 
with many  requiring more than [ADDRESS_530317]). Thus, most subjects were not 
remaining on stud y for long enough to achieve benefit. In order to maximize time on -
study , Part 2 was updated to enroll subjects with a more slowly- progressing disease that 
maintained man y of the clinical characteristics of the AML responses that were observed 
in Part 1.
Revised Text:
Primary goals and 5thparagraph
The primary  goal of Part 2 is to evaluate di sease -specific efficacy  in subjects with 
AML MDS , MM, and NHL . 
For AML MDS , efficacy  is defined as a clinically  meaningful response rate (defined 
as the percentage of subjects that have achieved a CR, CRp, CR marrow CR, or PR) 
of 30% relative to a 10% respon se rate suggesting no activity .  Historically , 
hypomethy lating agent failure has conferred a poor prognosis, with a response rate to 
second -line therapy  of 10% or less (Prebet, 2011).  I nvestigational agents have 
demonstrated a response rate of approximate ly 30%, though no effects on overall 
survival have been reported (Seetharam, 2010).  Because of the high unmet medical 
need of relapsed/refractory  MDS, and because no agent to date has exceeded the 
30% response rate published above, 30% was chosen as a rea listic goal for subjects 
with MDS.
For MM, efficacy  is defined as a clinically  meaningful response rate (defined as the 
percentage of subjects that have achieved a sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR) of 20% relative 
to a 5% response rate suggesting no activity .  These values were identified in a 
recent meta -analy sis that suggested that a response rate of 20% or greater in the 
relapsed/refractory  population was highl y predictive of clinical success, whereas 
older agents with limited clinical activity  had a negligible resp onse rate (Kortuem, 
Zidich, Schuster, et al, Clinical Ly mphoma, M yeloma and Leukemia 2014).
For NHL, efficacy  is defined as a clinically  meaningful response rate (defined as the 
percentage of subjects that have achieved a CR, or PR) of 30% relative to a 10 % 
response rate suggesting no activity .  These response rates were consistent with  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

STUDY RATIONALE:
Rationale for Change: Part 2 was amended from a population of subjects with NHL 
to a population of subjects with cutaneous T -cell ly mphoma (CTCL) given the observed 
response rate in CTCL .  
Revised Text:
Addition at the e nd of the paragraph:
Dose escalation initially  focused on AML, NHL (without consideration to histologic 
subty pe), and MM, based on preclinical data.  Emerging clinical data demonstrated 
delay ed response in AML subjects, many  of whom had evidence of antecedent MDS.  I n 
the NHL cohort, more robust clinical efficacy  was observed in subjects with CTCL  
compared to other NHL subty pes.  As a result of these observations, dose expansion (Part 
2) was modified to evaluate MDS and CTCL  instead of AML and unselected NHL, 
respectivel y.
OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS:

4391.3.2 .1.Preclinical Rationale for BID
Recent clinical and pre -clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacod ynamic data suggests a 
potential benefit of a twice dail y (BID) dosing re gimen compared to QD dosing 
[[COMPANY_004]525762 I B, GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2011N113741_05]. I n mice, 
[COMPANY_004]525762 has a short half- life of about 1.[ADDRESS_530333] -dose; however, expression returned to pre- treatment levels within [ADDRESS_530334] been further explored in a number of in vivo xenograft efficacy  
studies. I n a subcutaneous, patient -derived model of SCL C, BID dosing at 12.5mg/kg 
resulted in improved tumor growth inhibition compared to 25 mg/kg QD (74% versus 
60%, respectively ).  Improved efficacy  with BID dosing was also observed in a cell line 
xenograft model of CRC. BID dosing at 12.5mg/kg resulted in 48% tumor growth 
inhibition, whereas 25mg/kg QD dosing resulted in 34% inhibition.  I n a third model, a 
cell line xenograft of SCLC, there was no significant difference in tumor growth 
inhibition resulting from 12.5mg/kg BID versus 25mg/kg QD dosing. Thus, we observe 
equivalent or improved efficacy  with BID dosing in all xenograft models tested.
[IP_ADDRESS] .Clinical Rationale for BID
As described in the [COMPANY_004]525762 IB, Section 5.2, [COMPANY_004]525762 pharmacokinetics 
following once and twice daily  administration is character ized by  a rapid absorption with 
maximum concentration occurring mostly  within two hours after dosing. [COMPANY_004]525762 is 
eliminated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_420135] -life of 3 to 7 hours.
Based on the pharmacokinetics of [COMPANY_004]525762 observed to date, and evidence of a short 
half-life of about 5 hours, trough concentrations at 100 mg QD are predicted to be below 
the average in vitro IC50 (0.08 uM to 1.3 uM) for the tumor ty pes selected for this study . 
Dividing the daily dose into two doses administered abo ut 12 hours apart would allow the 
trough concentration to be above the lower in vitro I C50 for doses around 30 mg BID.
[IP_ADDRESS] .Starting Dose for BID
As detailed in the [COMPANY_004]525762 IB, Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_530335] been a dministered to subjects with solid tumors.  The PK and 
safet y/tolerability  profile for the 30 mg BID dose is comparable to subjects treated with 
an equivalent total dail y dose (i.e., 60 mg once daily ).  In this study , once the QD MTD 
of [COMPANY_004]525762 has been identified for each disease subty pe (AML/MDS, MM, and 
NHL), an exploratory  cohort may  be opened in one or more of the  disease ty pes to 
evaluate safet y, tolerability , and preliminary efficacy  of BID dosing.  
For each disease subt ype, the total daily dose selected for BID evaluation will be no 
higher than the once -daily  MTD, divided approximately  equall y between two doses  
administered approximately  12 hours apart.  A lower BID dose may  be considered 
depending on emerging safet y, PK, and PD data. 2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

Rationale for Change: Part 2 was amended from a population of subjects with NHL

Revised Text:
Paragraph 2 sentence 3
Part2 is a cohort expansion, which will study  the RP2D of [COMPANY_004]525762 to determine

myeloid neoplasms ( myelody splastic s yndrome [MDS] or MDS that has transforme d to

Paragraph 4
The original study  design included a dose expansion in non -Hodgkin’s l ymphoma, 
enrolling subjects regardless of histological subt ype.  Furthermore, this cohort enrolled 
subjects with double -and triple -hit ly mphoma (i.e., B -cell l ymphomas with 
rearrangement and/or overexpression of m yc and BCL2 and/or BCL 6) in an exploratory  
sub-cohort.  However, interim anal ysis of the Part 1 data demonstrated limited activity  in 
both B -cell ly mphomas in general as well as double/triple hit ly mphomas.  Responses, 
including very  deep, durable responses, were achieved in subjects with CTCL and other

Drug Interactions [COMPANY_004]525762 is a substrate for CYP3A4 
enzymes, and for P -gp and breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP) transporters. 
[COMPANY_004]525762 clearance is virtually solely via 
CYP3A4.  There is evidence of potential auto -
induction after repeat dosing in clinical studies 
since reduction in parent exposures (~25% at 
lower doses to ≥60% at doses ≥60mg, mainly 
in BET115521 study) have been observed.
There is low potential for [COMPANY_004]525762 to 
inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or to 
inhibit P -gp or BCRP based on in vitro data.  
[COMPANY_004]525762 was shown to be an inhibitor of 
organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 
(OATP1B1) and organic anion transporter 3 
(OAT3) in vitro.
[COMPANY_004]525762 was sho wn to be a moderate

induction study There is low potential for Use of concomitant medications, 
herbal medicines and fruit juices 
that are strong or moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers 
should be avoided during the 
course of the study where possible

30% relative to a 10% response rate suggesting no activity in subjects with MDS/AML.  
This will be conducted by [CONTACT_207102] P0 ≤0.10 versus the alternative 
that P1 ≥0.300, assuming the maximum response rate for an ineffective drug is 0.1 0 and 
the minimum response rate for an effective drug is 0.30.
Multiple myeloma: A response rate of 20% relative to a 5% response rate suggesting no 
activity in subjects with multiple myeloma.  This will be conducted by [CONTACT_420291] P0 ≤0.05 versus the alternative that P1 ≥0.20, assuming the maximum 
response rate for an ineffective drug is 0.05 and the minimum response rate for an 
effective drug is 0.20.
CTCL :Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (non -double hit lymphoma [DHL]): A response rate, 
lasting more than 4 months, of 430% relative to a 210% response rate suggesting no 
activity in subjects with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma CTCL .  This will be conducted by [CONTACT_420311] P0 ≤0.210 versus the alternative that P1 ≥0.430, assuming the

Paragraph 4 onwards:
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_420116] 81 100 mg per day.  Non -steroidal 
anti-inflammatory  agents should be avoided except where they  provide benefit over other 
analgesics; if administered, they  should be used with caution and consideration should be 
given to co -administration with proton pump inhibitors.
Co-administration of medications that are associated with prolonged QT interval (please 
refer to crediblemeds.org for a complete list of these medications) is permitted as follows:
If a subject is taking a QT -prolonging medication prior to first dose of 
[COMPANY_004]5 [ZIP_CODE], then the subject may  continue to take this medication without 
additional monitoring, so long as the baseline QTcF meets criteria as described in 
Section 4.2.2
If a subject must initiate a QT -prolonging medication while receiving 
[COMPANY_004]525762, then addi tional ECG monitoring should be implemented, per local

Section 11.1.2. Part 2, Expansion Cohort
Rationa le for Change: The study  population for the NH L cohort in Part 2 was 
amended from a population of subjects with NHL to a population of subjects with 
cutaneous T -cell ly mphoma (CTCL ).  The Part 2 primary  and secondary  objectives along 
with the eligibility  criteria were updated to include this new CTCL population , and 
removal of expansion into multiple my eloma in Part 2 .  
Revised Text:
Paragraph 1:
The primary  goal of Part 2 is to evaluate disease -specific efficacy  in subjects with MDS, 
MM, and CTCL NHL .
Bullet point 2 onwards:
For MM, efficacy  is defined as a clinically  meaningful response rate (defined as the 
percentage of subjects that have achieved a sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR) of 20% relative 
to a 5% response rate suggesting no activity .  These values were ide ntified in a 
recent meta -analy sis that suggested that a response rate of 20% or greater in the 
relapsed/refractory  population was highl y predictive of clinical success, whereas 
older agents with limited clinical activity  had a negligible response rate (Kor tuem, 
2014).
For cutaneous l ymphomaNHL CTCL , efficacy  is defined as a clinically  meaningful 
response rate (defined as the percentage of subjects that have achieved a CR, or PR
lasting more than 4 months ) of 430% relative to a 210% response rate suggesting n o  2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.[ADDRESS_530367] 
demonstrated a response rate of 30 -40% in a comparable patient population ( Duvic, 
2007; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_79577], 2007; Whittaker, 2010 ).  Therefore, a target response rate of 40% was 
chosen to represent the response rate of an active agent.  Conversel y, an agent with a 
response rate of 20% is unlikely  to be developed further; this is approximately  the 
response rate of placebo described in the denileukin difitox package insert (ONTAK 
package insert) . Therefore, 20% was chosen to represent the activity of a futile agent. 
These response rates were consistent with multiple ongoing studies of single agent, 
targeted therap y in Phase I  clinical trials for subjects with relapsed/refractory  NHL.  
For this c ohort, double/triple -hit ly mphoma subjects will be excluded from initial 
efficacy  anal ysis and will be evaluated separatel y.
Paragraph 6 onwards:
For the MDS and cutaneous ly mphomaNHLCTCL disease cohort s, starting with a cohort 
of [ADDRESS_530368] a Type I Error ( ) 
of 0.034 and 87% power. Futility  anal ysis will be based on subjects who have at least one 
post-baseline di sease assessment , have progressed or died, or have permanently  
discontinued from study  treatment . The trial will be stopped early  for futility  if the 
predictive probability  of success ( that the response rate historical response rate) is less 
than 1%. If the true response rate is 10%, the average sample size is 20 and the 
probability  of earl y termination (PET) for futility  is 93%. If the true response rate is 30%, 
the average sample size is 31 subjects and the probability  of earl y termination PET is 9%. 
For the MM disease CTCL cohort, starting with a cohort of 1310subjects and allowing 
for a maximum sample size of [ADDRESS_530369] a Ty pe I Error ( ) of 0.032049 and 
85.2% power. Futility  analy sis will be based on subjects who have at least one post -
baseline disease assessment , have progressed or died, or have permanently  discontinued 
from study  treatmen t. The trial will be stopped early  for futility  if the predictive 
probabi lity of success ( that the response rate historical response rate) is less than 1%. If 
the true response rate is 520%, the average sample size is 2223and the probability  of

INR measured which may indicate severe liver injury (possible ‘Hy’s Law’), must be reported as an SAE 
(excluding studies of hepatic impairment or cirrhosis) ; INR measurement is not required and the 
threshold value stated will not apply to participants receiving anticoagulants
3. New or worsening symptoms believed to be related to liver injury (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, or jaundice) or believed to be related to hypersensitivity (such as fever, 
rash or eosinophilia)
4. Includes: Hepatitis A IgM antibody; Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis B C ore Antibody (IgM); 
Hepatitis C RNA; Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody; Epstein -Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if 
unavailable, obtain heterophile antibody or monospot testing); Hepatitis E IgM antibody 
5. If hepatitis delta antibody assay cannot be pe rformed, it can be replaced with a PCR of hepatitis D RNA

Rechallenge Following Liver Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_420123] -induced liver injur y, drug rechallenge is associated with a 13% 
mortality across all drugs in prospective studies (Andrade, 2009) . Clinical outcomes 
vary by [CONTACT_9934], with nearl y 50% fatalit y with halothane readministered within one month 
of initial injury . However, some drugs s eldom result in recurrent liver injury or fatalit y.   2020N438745_00116183 | Study Report Modular Appendix-bet116183--protocol-amend-9 15 Mar 2018 | TMF-11709318 | 1.0

482Risk factors for a fatal drug rechallenge outcome include:
Hypersensitivity  (Andrade, 2009) with initial liver injury  (e.g. fever, rash, 
eosinophilia) 
jaundice or bilirubin >2xULN with initial liver in jury (direct bilirubin >35% of 
total)
participant currentl y exhibits severe liver injury defined by: [CONTACT_42386] 3xUL N, 
bilirubin 2xUL N (direct bilirubin >35% of total), or INR 1.5
serious adverse event or fatality  has earlier been observed with drug 
rechallenge s (Papay , 2009; Hunt, 2010)
evidence of drug- related preclinical liability  (e.g. reactive metabolites;  
mitochondrial impairment (Hunt, 2010)
Rechallenge refers to resuming study  treatment following drug induced liver injury  
(DILI). Because of the risks a ssociated with rechallenge after DILI this should only  be 
considered for a participant for whom there is compelling evidence of benefit from a 
critical or life -saving medicine, there is no alternative approved medicine available, and a 
benefit:risk assessm ent of rechallenge is considered to be favourable.
Approval b y [COMPANY_004] for rechallenge with study treatment can be considered where:
Investigator requests consideration of rechallenge with study  treatment for a 
participant who is receiving compelling benefit w ith study  treatment that exceeds 
risk, and no effective alternative therapy  is available.  
Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Board approval for rechallenge with study  
treatment must be obtained, as required.   
If the rechallenge is approved by  [CONTACT_90652], the 
participant must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and 
risks of study  treatment administration, including the possibility  of recurrent, more 
severe liver injury  or death.  
The participant mus t also provide signed informed consent specifically  for the 
rechallenge with study  treatment.  Documentation of informed consent must be 
recorded in the study  chart.  
Study  treatment must be administered at the dose specified by  [CONTACT_23983].
Participants approved by [CONTACT_420319] a week for liver chemistry  tests until stable 
liver chemistries have been demonstrated and then standard laboratory  monitoring 
may resume as per protocol.
If after study  treatment rechallenge, participant meets protocol -defined liver

Possible study  treatment -induced liver injury  has been excluded by  [CONTACT_90653]. This includes the absence of markers of h ypersensitivity  
(otherwise unexplained fever, rash, eosinophilia). Where a stud y treatment has an 
identified genetic marker associated with liver injury  (e.g. lapatinib, abacavir, 
amoxicillin/clavulanate), the presence of the marker should be excluded. If study  
treatment -related liver injury  cannot be excluded, the guidance on rechallenge in 
Section 7.7 will apply .
There is no evidence of alcoholic hepatitis.
Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Board approval of study  treatment restart 
must be obtained, as required.
If restart of study  treatment is approved b y [COMPANY_004] Medical Governance in writing, the

Background Information on Drug Restart/Rechallenge
Following drug -induced liver injury , drug restart or rechallenge is associated with a 
13% mortality across all drugs in pros pective studies [Andrade, 2009].  Clinical 
outcomes vary  by [CONTACT_9934], with nearl y 50% fatality with halothane readministered in one 
month of initial injury .  However, some drugs seldom result in recurrent liver injury  or 
fatality .  Risk factors for a fatal dru g restart/rechallenge outcome include: 
hypersensitivity 1 with initial liver injury  (e.g., fever, rash, eosinophilia), jaundice or 
bilirubin>2xUL N or INR>1.5 suggesting severe liver injury , prior IP -related severe or 
fatal drug restart/rechallenge [Papay , 2009; Hunt, 2010] or evidence of drug -related

Phase Feasibility/Phase II  
Methodology Open  
Study Duration 8 years  
Study Center(s) University of Pennsylvania  
Objectives  1. The primary objectives are to determine feasibility and the acute 
toxicity profile of accelerated partial breast radiation using 
protons.  
2. Additional objectives of late toxicities, cosmesis, and clinical efficacy are evaluated in these patients on the phase II portion of 
the trial . 
Number of Subjects [ADDRESS_1143734] conserving therapy (BCT) has been conclusively shown in multiple randomized 
controlled trials to provide outcomes that equal to mastectomy in terms of disease- free and 
overall survival ( 1, 2).  There may also be for most women improved quality of life from organ 
preservation.  On this basis the NCI has designated BCT as an equal alternative option for treatment for the majority of women with early stage invasive breast cancer  (3). 
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_824740], mastectomy rates remain high ( 4, 5).  The causes of the apparent 
underuse of BCT are likely multifactorial.  One significant barrier to the more widespread application of BCT may be the inconvenience associated with breast radiotherapy which traditionally has been administered over a period of 5- [ADDRESS_1143735] RT  (6, 7). 
1.[ADDRESS_1143736] is accomplished in a shorter period of time (3-5 weeks) by [CONTACT_824763] ( 8-10).  
In each of these studies, the goal was to deliver a hypofractionated dose schedule that is biologically equivalent to the standard fractionation breast dose of [ADDRESS_1143737] treatment (mastectomy) with another (whole breast radiation), a significant number of women may have more limited disease that could be treated by a more targeted  approach to only a small portion of the breast.   
 
Proton Radiotherapy for APBI in Early Stage Breast Cancer  Page [ADDRESS_1143738] cancers appear to be confined to the tumor bed ( 11-14).  Partial breast irradiation is usually delivered with 
hypofractionation, or use of greater than a standard 1.[ADDRESS_1143739] irradiation (APBI).  
 ABPI [INVESTIGATOR_824741].  APBI is intended to improve the convenience of radiation therapy as a part of breast conservation by [CONTACT_824764] [ADDRESS_1143740] local recurrences by 
[CONTACT_824765] (particularly for recurrences away from the area of previous high dose APBI).  This last possibility is the subject of an ongoing RTOG trial.    The major techniques of APBI can be divided into external beam radiation therapy or delivery of radiation through sources placed inside temporary internal catheters (brachytherapy).  There are advantages and disadvantages to each method.   
• The method with the longest duration of follow up is interstitial breast brachytherapy.  This method uses interstitial catheters placed in the breast either at the time of lumpectomy or at a later date.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_824742] a reasonably homogeneous dose distribution, interstitial breast brachytherapy has never been widely adopted because it is time-consuming, invasive, and requires a highly skilled operator.  This also may be restricted if there is small breast size, difficult lumpectomy cavity geometry or narrow balloon distance from the skin.  T he catheter  
protrudes form the breast for the entire course of treatment, and therefore may cause discomfort, inconvenience to the patient, and possible infection.   
• To address these shortcomings, the MammoSite catheter, a single lumen HDR brachytherapy catheter housed within a saline-inflated balloon, was developed.  The FDA approved the device in May [ADDRESS_1143741] been developed which attempt to improve upon the original MammoSite catheter in a number of ways.  The Contura and MammoSite ML catheters employ multiple channels that allow for reduction in dose to the skin and/or chest wall by [CONTACT_824766].  The Savi catheter uses a cage- structure rather 
than a saline filled balloon; its purported advantage is that it more closely resembles interstitial brachytherapy and that it eliminates the problem occasionally encountered 
Proton Radiotherapy for APBI in Early Stage Breast Cancer  Page [ADDRESS_1143742] tissues to the surface of the 
balloon.  
• As a result of the aforementioned drawbacks of catheter -based brachytherapy, an 
alternative method of delivering APBI has been with 3D- conformal external beam 
radiotherapy (3D -CRT).  This technique typi[INVESTIGATOR_79458] 3-5 photon and/or electron 
fields that converge on the tumor bed.  In the ongoing RTOG randomized trial of WBI 
versus APBI, approximately 2/[ADDRESS_1143743] tissue receiving the prescription dose is considerably in excess of the planning target volume (PTV).    On RTOG [ADDRESS_1143744] irradiation, the normal 
tissue constraints allowed up to 60% of the whole breast reference volume to receive 50% of the prescription dose and up to 35% of the whole breast to receive up 100% of the prescription dose.   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_824743], a trial conducted at the University of Michigan of APBI using IMRT and respi[INVESTIGATOR_824744] 7/34 patients developed new unacceptable cosmesis at a median follow -up of 2.5 years ( 15).  Investigators at Tufts 
University and Brown also found high rates of soft tissue toxicity when following these parameters for external beam photon APBI ( 16). 
 In addition to treating large volumes of normal breast tissue, the 3D-CRT method may also result in significant exposure of the ipsilateral lung, or in patients with left- sided breast cancer  the 
heart.  P atients treated on a phase II trial of ABPI [INVESTIGATOR_824745] a higher than expected 
rate of radiation pneumonitis ( 17).   
 
1.[ADDRESS_1143745] studies is short ( 18-22).  These favorable outcomes have been 
achieved using careful clinicopathologic selection factors that usually include small, unifocal cancers, nonlubular, and without an extensive intraductal component.  The degree to which age or adverse pathologic features such as extensive intraductal component, lobular carcinoma in situ, or basal-like molecular profile will influence local control are unknown.

A consensus group by [CONTACT_824767] a clinical trial ( 23).  A most suitable group was considered women age ≥ 60 years, with no known 
BRCA mutation, T1 ( ≤ 2 cm size ), > 2 mm margins, lymphovascular space invasion not present, 
ER positive, unicentric, invasive ductal or other favorable histology, extensive intraductal component not present, and lymph nodes negative for metastases .  Other patients with less 
favorable features were either considered  cautionary or unsuitable outside of a clinical trial.   
Similar patient and tumor- related characteristics were used to define a low risk subgroup of 
patients who could be good candidates for APBI by [CONTACT_824768]éen de Curiethérapie-European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (GEC- ESTRO) breast cancer 
working group based on clinical evidence (Polgar et al 2009) but the age parameter was defined 
as > 50 years.  
 Our trial originally excluded lobular histology for two reasons: one that there was relatively little data on outcomes for invasive lobular with partial breast radiation, and two because the ASTRO consensus placed this histology in the category of cautionary outside of a clinical trial (likely due to that relative lack of data).   There have since been published [ADDRESS_1143746] radiation.   The GEC -
ESTRO trial had a patient make -up of approximately 10-13% lobular, the Florence Italy trial 
about 10-15% lobular or mixed ductal and lobular.  There were no differences seen by [CONTACT_824769] [ADDRESS_1143747] been 
utilized; however, these techniques still entail both an entrance dose to normal tissue as it penetrates to reach a tumor at depth in tissue, and an exit dose as it exits the body in a straight path beyond the tumor.  Proton radiotherapy differs from photon radiotherapy in that most of the energy is deposited at a specific depth known as the Bragg peak. The dose immediately beyond the Bragg peak is essentially zero, which allows tissues on the posterior side of the tumor to be spared.  The clinical application of protons provides an improvement over photons in the ability to deliver a high-dose- volume to any configuration within an anatomical site while maintaining 
lower doses to surrounding normal tissues, resulting in decreased short- and long- term morbidity, 
due to the unique Bragg Peak phenomenon of the dose distribution of protons. Theoretically, this should ease the current limitation of normal tissue tolerance as a dose- limiting factor , particularly 
for larger tumors , as well as allow greater dose to be delivered to the tumor/target volume.   
 Protons have a similar biologic effect to photons against tumors.  The biological effect of radiation is dependent on its linear energy transfer (LET).  LET is defined as the rate of energy transferred by [CONTACT_824770].  To compare different types of radiation, we use the relative biologic effectiveness (RBE), which is defined as the ratio of the dose of particle radiation to the dose of 60Co radiation producing the same biological endpoint.  Standard photon radiation therapy has a RBE of 1.0; the RBE of protons is thought to be between

This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_4530]  1.05 to 1.25 ( 24-26).  A recent review of in vivo and in vitro experiments concluded that RBE 
varies with dose or dose per fraction and increases with an increasing depth in the spread out 
Bragg Peak (SOBP) and is most significant at the distal edge of the SOBP.  Overall though, based on the data to date, an average RBE of approximately 1.1 in the entrance of the SOBP is reasonable to assume ( 27).  The clinical advantage of proton beam radiotherapy over standard 
photon radiation results from the more favorable dose distributions achievable with its particular physical properties as previously described.  The advantage of protons has been demonstrated for medulloblastoma and prostate cancer, and comparative treatment planning using protons versus photons has shown a clear advantage to protons in terms of dose distribution ( 28-33). 
 Proton therapy, due to its unique dosimetric characteristics, may offer women who are candidates for APBI the convenience and noninvasiveness of 3D-CRT combined with the superior conformality of brachytherapy.  Because protons deposit dose at a finite range that depends on the energy of the beam, the exit dose seen with protons is dramatically reduced compared with photon therapy.  A reduction in exit dose would be expected to significantly reduce the volume of normal breast tissue receiving the prescription dose and to dramatically reduce exit dose to the underlying heart and/or lung.    The group from Mass achusetts General  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824746] ( 34) and dosimetric comparison studies with protons versus photon 
APBI ( 35).   
• In their first study ( 34), from March 2004 to June 2005, 25 patients with tumors < or =2 
cm and negative axillary nodes were treated with proton APBI.  The prescribed dose was 32 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE) in 4 CGE fractions given twice daily. One to three fields were used to provide adequate planning target volume (PTV) coverage and dose homogeneity.  Excellent target coverage and dose homogeneity were obtained in all patients with one to three proton beams. The median volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of the prescribed dose was 23%.  Median volumes of ipsilateral lung receiving 20 CGE, 10 CGE, and 5 CGE were 0%, 1%, and 2%, respectively and contralateral lung and heart received essentially no radiation dose.   
• In their second study ( 35), twenty- four patients with fully excised, stage I breast cancer 
treated with proton APBI had treatment plans generated comparing them to mixed-modality, photon-electron APBI.  Proton APBI reduced the volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of the prescribed dose by [CONTACT_5554] 36%.  Proton APBI significantly reduced the volume of irradiated nontarget breast tissue, including ipsilateral lung, contralateral lung, and heart.  
 Moon et al. ( 36) reported a dosimetric study comparing four different methods of APBI in [ADDRESS_1143748] ipsilateral lung dose and heart dose.  
1.7 Clinical e xperience with Protons and APBI  
The group from Mass General has reported their initial clinical experience (37) using proton 
beam radiation for APBI.  [ADDRESS_1143749] Cancer  Page 7 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_824771] a Phase I/II clinical trial.  With a median follow -up of 12 months, no recurrent disease was 
detected.  There was an unexpectedly high rate of acute skin toxicity:  moderate to severe skin 
color changes developed in 79% of patients at [ADDRESS_1143750] 
desquamation in 22% of patients at [ADDRESS_1143751] with only 3 patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_824747], 3 patients reporting rib tenderness, and one patient developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a rib fracture.  Nor did the severity of the acute skin toxicity appear to portend adverse cosmetic outcomes.  W ith a 
median follow-up of 12 months (range 8-22 months), global breast cosmesis was judged by [CONTACT_824772] 89% and 100% of cases at [ADDRESS_1143752] cosmesis as good or excellent in 100% of cases at [ADDRESS_1143753] follow -up, 95% of patients reported total satisfaction with proton APBI. 
 The group from Loma Linda University Medical Center has reported the results of a phase II trial of proton beam APBI ( 38).  Eligible patients included women with invasive breast cancer, 
nonlobular histology, size ≤  3 cm, negative margins ≥  [ADDRESS_1143754] primary in an adjacent quadrant more than 5 years after 
treatment .  Acute toxicities were limited to mild grade 1 radiation dermatitis  in 26 patients and 
grade 2 in 4 patients. Late skin toxicities included 3 grade 1 telangiectasias. There were no posttreatment infections or ulcerations and no cases of fat necrosis, rib fractures, radiation pneumonitis, or cardiac events.  Ninety percent of patients rated their cosmetic result as good or excellent (54% excellent, 36% good) with the remaining ten percent fair.  The severity of the acute skin toxicity observed in the phase I/II trial from Harvard was likely the result of the treatment techniques used in that study.  Patients were treated with only 1-[ADDRESS_1143755] majority (84%) of the patients receiving treatment with only [ADDRESS_1143756] 2 fields treated daily. Care was taken to minimize the volume of skin encompassed by [CONTACT_941] 90% isodose.    In the original Loma Linda partial breast experience with protons cited in the protocol, the fractionation used was [ADDRESS_1143757], allowing once daily fractionation could improve study enrollment by [CONTACT_824773]/unwilling to wait in the department for a second treatment [ADDRESS_1143758] study, investigators from MDACC developed a modified proton beam treatment approach employing 3-4 passive scattering beams that are individualized based on patient-specific anatomy and target location (39).  In a planning study they generated comparative proton and photon APBI plans for 11 
patients.  The proton plans employed beam arrangement described above.   The 3DCRT plans used 3-5 coplanar and noncoplanar beams.  The target dose and specified normal tissue constraints followed the NSABP B-39/RTOG [ADDRESS_1143759] skin by 47.3%, 39.9%, 27.8%, and 18.9% respectively; the V90 for breast skin was comparable for protons and photons.  As expected, the dose to normal breast tissue, lung, and heart were also reduced with protons compared with photons.  Treatment with protons resulted in absolute reductions in the V100, V90, V75, V50, and V20 for normal breast tissue of 3.4%, 8.6%, 11.8%, 17.9%, and 23.6%, respectively. The proton plan also significantly reduced the dose to the heart and lung.  Analysis of the impact of range uncertainty and patient set-up uncertainty (including respi[INVESTIGATOR_64947]) revealed that the proton plans remained robust in the face of these uncertainties.  
 Although recent planning studies such as the one from MDACC described above have demonstrated the dosimetric advantages of protons beam ABPI [INVESTIGATOR_824748], clinical experience with proton beam APBI remains limited.

3.[ADDRESS_1143765] successfully completed patient oriented research training.  Subjects will receive all treatment in the Radiation Oncology Clinic of the University of Pennsylvania.  Subjects will not be paid for participating in the 
study.  All medical costs will be the responsibility of the subjects and/or their insurers.  Cost of living expenses will be the responsibility of the subjects.    
At the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971], we currently treat approximately [ADDRESS_1143766]. We anticipate that with the 
availability of proton radiotherapy, these numbers may increase.  We estimate an annual accrual 
of 10-12 subjects per year.  Following its approval by [CONTACT_1201], this protocol will be listed on our 
website.  Physicians within the Penn Radiation Oncology Network sites and our referring physicians will also be informed about the availability of this study.  3.3.1 Inclusion of Minorities  The University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center reports that minorities accounted for 14% of all patients (adult and pediatric) enrolled on therapeutic clinical trials.  Furthermore, it is estimated that approximately 30% of cancer patients admitted to the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824751] (Source:  University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center Grant).  The University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center has developed a number of minority outreach strategies.  These include development of relationships with local community organizations, presentations or distribution of materials to local groups regarding trials, advertisements in minority newspapers and magazines, and presentations to professional organizations.  If under-accrual of minority subjects is determined to be a problem, we will employ these methods to improve accrual.    3.3.[ADDRESS_1143767] Cancer  Page 12

3.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects 
• Recurrent or Progressive Disease: Subjects who have clinical or radiologic evidence of 
recurrent disease will undergo an evaluation to document the nature of the abnormality.  If recurrent or progressive cancer is diagnosed, the subject will be considered off study at that time but all efforts will be made to follow patients for survival for as long as the patient chooses to be clinically followed. 
• At the discretion of the Principal Investigator :  [INVESTIGATOR_824752]’s best interest.
   In this event, the 
reasons for withdrawal will be documented. 
• Treatment is interrupted for reasons of treatment -related toxicity for more than 5 days. 
• Subject Participation:  Refusal to continue treatment, follow -up, comply with the protocol or 
withdrawal of consent. In this event, the reasons for withdrawal will be documented. 
 
• Any grade [ADDRESS_1143768]’s records and on the CRF.  The investigator will assess each subject for response at the time of withdrawal.   
Every effort will be made to follow subjects off study for toxicity and survival.  Acute toxicities

after the planning CT was obtained. All  CT scan s should be acquired with the subject in the 
same position and using the same immobilization device as for treatment. Treatment planning will be done using a 3D based CT treatment planning system. All tissues to be irradiated must be included in the CT scan. Based on the 4DCT evaluation an active motion management should be employed for target motion > 1cm for passive scattering proton techniques or as indicated by [CONTACT_824779]. Treatment planning will be performed on the average CT data set or breathold CT data set.  
 
4.1.[ADDRESS_1143771] all target structures will be derived based on the target motion during the breathing cycle ( inhale, exhale phase) on the average CT.   
4.2.1 The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) is defined as the boolean volumetric combination of 
the seroma (radiographic abnormality seen in the breast corresponding with fluid and/or scar tissue in the lumpectomy cavity) and surgical clips (or other fiducial markers)  as determined 
from CT, MRI, and other relevant clinical information. 
 4.2.2 The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) is defined as the GTV with a margin of [ADDRESS_1143772] tissue extent  at 
the pectoral muscle (chest wall and pectoralis muscles are not to be included).  
 4.2.3 The Planning Target Volume (PTV), defined as a uniform 5 mm expansion around the 
CTV, will provide a margin the CTV to compensate for set-up variability and target volume motion due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. 
 4.2.4 The Evaluation Planning Target Volume (PTV_Eval) is equivalent to the PTV but 
excludes any part of the PTV that extends outside the patient, the first [ADDRESS_1143773] tissue (i.e., chest wall, pectoralis muscles, and lung are excluded). Clinical Target Volume (CTV inhale ) is defined as the GTV inhale plus areas that are conside red t o contain potential 
microscopic disease on the inhale phase CT data set.

boolean of the CTVinhale and CTVexhale  of the target on the average CT data set. 
Alternatively it can be derived based on the 4D analysis of target motion or can be manually edited by [CONTACT_824780] 4DCT data sets available . 
 
4.2.7 The Planning Target Volume (PTV), defined as a uniform [ADDRESS_1143774] will define two structures: Skin-2 (2 mm thick surface) and Skin-PTV (all 
PTVs subtracted from the surface contour). Skin-PTV is the normal tissue structure that is all 
tissue other than what is contoured as something else.  
4.3.2 Organ at risk volume (OAR) is contoured as visualized on the planning CT or MR scan.  
Planning organ at risk volume (PAR) is the OAR volume expanded for setup uncertainty or 
organ motion.  The physician will contour the OAR.  The dosimetrist will create the PAR by [CONTACT_445660] 2-3 mm, depending on the situation.  
4.3.3 The following normal structures will be contoured:  skin, ipsilateral and contralateral 
whole breast reference volumes, thyroid, lung (right/left), heart and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831].  
  
4.4 Dose fractionation and specification  
4.4.1  A total dose of 38.5  Gy (RBE)  will be prescribed to the ICRU reference point 
(usually isocenter).  Two fractions, each of 3.85 GY (RBE)  separated by [CONTACT_2669] 6 
hours, will be administered on 5 treatment days (over a period of 5 to 10 days) for 
a total of 10 fractions .  A fractionation schedule of 3.85 Gy once a day for 10 
fractions over 2- 3 weeks is also permitted.  
 
4.5 Treatment Planning   
4.5.1 The dose will be prescribed to the ICRU reference point (usually the isocenter) to be 
consistent with the ongoing RTOG 04-13 study.   
4.5.2 Dose constraints for PTV_Eval: 95% of the prescription dose should cover at least 95% 
of the PTV_Eval. 
4.5.3 Dose Constraints for normal tissues: 
• Uninvolved normal breast : Less than 60% of the whole breast reference volume should 
receive ≥ 50% of the prescribed dose and < 35% of the whole breast reference volume should 
receive the prescribed dose.  
• Contralateral breast : The contralateral breast reference volume, contoured using the same 
methods described for the ipsilateral breast reference volume, should receive < 3% of the 
prescribed dose to any point. 
• Ipsilateral lung: < 15% of the lung can receive 30% of the prescribed dose.   
• Contralateral lung: < 15% of the lung can receive 5% of the prescribed dose.

with favorable S tage 0, I or II breast cancer. The trial will be conducted in two phases: first, a 
feasibility study and then, a phase II  study. Since proton therapy is a new treatment modality at 
PENN, the first proton trial conducted in each cancer site (and here proton is prescribed on an 
accelerated treatment schedule) will be a feasibility study, in order to gain experience on both the logistics of proton planning, dosimetry, scheduling, and delivery, as well as patient safety issues.

efficacy are evaluated in these patients on the phase II portion of the trial.  
 
7.1.3  Endpoints 
Primary Endpoints  
Feasibility  will be based on multiple radiation planning and treatment parameters. Should a patient 
experience one of the following events, treatment will be deemed infeasible:  
 a) Patient cannot be given treatment because anatomy is such that a dosimetrically satisfactory treatment 
plan cannot be devised. For example, the dosimetry is unsatisfactory if <  95% of the target volume is 
covered by 95% of the dose. b) Patient is unable to tolerate more than 20% of  treatments using proton radiotherapy (i.e., >2 of the 10 
fractions). This can be for any reason, including the inability to set the patient up within acceptable limits 
of tolerance, or the patient is unable to tolerate treatment position or immobilization for duration of 
treatment. Thus, up to 20% (i.e., 2 of the 10 fractions) of treatments could be delivered using photons. 
c) Patient is unable to complete all treatment within 5 days of the estimated date of treatment completion 
or requires a treatment break of  > than 5 days. 
d) No more than 20% of patients experience an acute toxicity, as defined below. 
 
Acute toxicity  is defined as any grade [ADDRESS_1143784] scoring system (scale = excellent, good, fair, poor) and CTC 
Version 5.0. In addition, cosmesis will be scored by [CONTACT_824783] (BCTOS) instrument.  
 
Clinical Efficacy . Time to local failure will be defined as the time from the start of radiation therapy to 
local failure.  Overall survival will be defined from the time from the start of radiation therapy to death 
due to any cause or last patient follow -up. These outcomes will likely be summarized during the phase II 
study.

Feasibility  
We will assume a beta (5,1) prior, which is information equivalent to feasibility established in 5 of 6 
treated patients. A feasibility rate > 90% is considered acceptable. If the number of patients in whom 
proton is deemed feasible is less than or equal to  the number in the table below then termination will be

7.2  PHASE II STUDY. 
 
7.2.1 Design and Objectives.  
Once feasibility and safety are established, then the phase II portion of the study will commence. A total 
of 57 patients will be enrolled; 12 patients are included from the feasibility study and 45 additional patients are enrolled in the phase II study. The two primary objectives are: to determine whether the rate 
of Grade 3+ acute toxicity is < 20% and whether the rate of maintained  excellent to good cosmesis is 
>85% at [ADDRESS_1143788] decided to continue Bayesian monitoring of acute toxicity throughout the course of the phase II study. Assuming a beta (1,5) prior, if the number of patients with Grade 3 or higher 
acute toxicity is greater than or equal to the number in the table below, then termination will be 
considered, because it is likely that the toxicity rate is >20%, as noted by [CONTACT_824786].

include scatter plots, box plots, mean (+SE) plots and histograms. The distribution of continuous variables 
will be characterized with mean, median, standard deviation and range, while the distribution of categorical variables will be described with frequency, percentage and 95% CI. Toxicities will be 
categorized as acute or late and will be graded and tabled by [CONTACT_824787]. The Grade 3+ acute toxicity 
rate and confidence interval will be calculated and a one sample chi -square test will be performed. The 
rate of excellent to good cosmesis at [ADDRESS_1143790] will be performed. Time to local failure and overall survival will be estimated 
by [CONTACT_8761]- Meier method.  
 
7.3 SAMPLE SIZE/POWER  
 
Acute toxicity.  A total of [ADDRESS_1143791] -XRT is 
expected.  With 57 patients, there is 90% power for a chi -square test at a 1 -sided 10% significance level, 
to test the null hypothesis that the acute toxicity rate is ≥ 35% (clearly unacceptable) versus the alternative 
hypothesis that the acute toxicity rate is ≤ 20%. This  analysis will be performed when [ADDRESS_1143792] 
progressive disease before 2 years and who are not scored as fair or poor cosmesis (i.e., considered a 
failure) at a time point prior to [ADDRESS_1143793] -XRT. With 
50 patients, there is 90% power for a chi -square test at a 1 -sided 10% significance level, to test the null 
hypothesis that the cosmesis rate is ≤  70% (clearly unacceptable) versus the alternative hypothesis that the 
cosmesis rate is ≥ 85%. 
 
7.4 TRIAL DURATION.  
A total of 57 patients will be enrolled. With an expected monthly accrual of 2 patients, this study will 
enroll for approximately 2.5 years and the total duration of the study is approximately 4.5 y ears, in order 
to follow patients for 2 year cosmesis.    
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
The principal and secondary investigators will be responsible for detecting, documenting and 
reporting all events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as defined in this protocol. 
8.1Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, illness/disease 
(new or exacerbated) or experience that develops or worsens in severity temporally associated with the use of the proton APBI and is considered by [CONTACT_824788].  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_824789].  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be 
adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal 
• is associated with a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
• is considered by [CONTACT_824790]:  
 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscopy, appendectormy); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE.   
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (elective and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuation of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen in grade or severity. 
• The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s condition. 
• Grade 1 adverse events that are not in the following categories: fatigue, skin, breast, 
ribs, heart, and lungs. 
 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A Serious Adverse Event  is any 
medical occurance that at any dose:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
Note:   (the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event, not events that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824754] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824755], the subject has been detained [at least an overnight stay] at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824756]/treatment that would not have been appropriate in a physician’s office or outpatient setting).   
Note:  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_810010], diagnostic purposes or a pre -existing 
condition that did not worsen from baseline in not considered an AE or SAE.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824757].   
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
Note:  A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
Not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• an important medical event  
Proton Radiotherapy for APBI in Early Stage Breast Cancer  Page [ADDRESS_1143794], and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824758].   All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as adverse events (AEs)  per protocol definition.  
 
Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Assessments  
Any abnormal laboratory test result (.e.g. hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis) or 
other safety assessment (e.g. ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs), including those that worsen from baseline and are felt to be clinically significant  in the medical and scientific 
judgement of the investigator are to be recorded as AE or SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE, as defined above.  However, any clinically significant safety assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_1173]’s condition, are not  to be recorded as AEs or reported as 
SAEs.  
 The investigator will exercise his/her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  This assessment will be documented on the lab report or in a timely clinic/progress note. 
 Disease Related Events and/or Disease-Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as SAEs An event that is part of the natural course of the disease (e.g. disease progression) does not 
need to be reported as an SAE.  Progression of the subject’s cancer will be clearly recorded in the clinic/progress note.  Death due to progressive disease is not an SAE.  However, if the progression of the underlying disease is greater than that which would normally be expected for the subject or if the investigator considers that there was a causal relationship between the investigational agent/treatment/device and the disease progression, then this must be reported as an SAE.  Any new cancer must be reported as an SAE. 
 
Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study, prior to 
administration or exposure to any protocol agents/treatments/devices.  A preexisting condition should be recorded as Medical History and becomes an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period as defined by [CONTACT_760].    Radiation Effect  
Radiation side effects are typi[INVESTIGATOR_317974] (during radiation and up to 1 month after radiation ) and those that occur later (>[ADDRESS_1143795]-radiation). 
Proton Radiotherapy for APBI in Early Stage Breast Cancer  Page [ADDRESS_1143796] tissue adversely 
affecting cosmesis and/or causing breast pain, rib fractures, pulmonary fibrosis, and radiation -induced heart disease.  Another rare but serious late side effect is the development 
of second tumors. It is hoped that proton radiation will substantially reduce both acute and late side effects by [CONTACT_824791].  For acute and late radiation effect s CTCAE 5.[ADDRESS_1143797] of the protocol and the occurrence of each AE/SAE.  The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the investigational aspect of the protocol should be considered and investigated.   
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_16469], the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1143798] seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_179546], examination and review of clinical documentation (e.g. lab reports, radiology reports).  Information on all adverse events, as defined by [CONTACT_760], should be recorded immediately in the source document and also on the adverse event Case Report Form (CRF).  It is preferred that events are recorded by [CONTACT_637] (where applicable) instead of through signs/symptoms/test results.  For example, shortness of breath, chest pain and nausea may have been confirmed as a myocardial infarct through lab test and an ECG, therefore, “MI” or “myocardial infarct” or “heart attack” should be recorded instead of all of the signs/symptoms.  All adverse events meeting the protocol definition, occurring during the study period must be recorded.  Full documentation of an event includes start/stop dates, event, grade, expectedness, attribution and outcome.  The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.   
 All Adverse and Serious Adverse Events will be assessed using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (CTCAE 5.0).  Expectedness will be captured for all adverse events  
8.3Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.[ADDRESS_1143799] dose/treatment with any experimental aspect of the protocol.  Therefore, only treatment emergent events will be evaluated.  For this study, the study treatment follow-up is defined as [ADDRESS_1143800] administration of study treatment.   
8.3.2 IRB Notification by [CONTACT_824792]:  
The University of Pennsylvania IRB (Penn IRB) requires expedited reporting of those events related to study participation that are unforeseen and indicate that participants or others are at increased risk of harm.  The Penn IRB will not acknowledge safety reports or bulk adverse event submissions that do not meet the criteria outlined below.  The Penn IRB requires researchers to submit reports of the following problems within 10 working days from the time the investigator 
becomes aware of the event:  
• Any adverse event (regardless of whether the event is serious or non- serious, on- site or 
off-site) that occurs any time during or after the research study, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_237613]:  
Unexpected  (An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB-approved informed consent document and other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts.) 
AND  
Related  to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research procedures” if in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was more likely than not to be caused by [CONTACT_28821].)

This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_4530]  8.5.1 Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
The Abramson Cancer Data and Safety Monitoring Committee is charged with the 
responsibility of reviewing all SAEs, deviations, Medical/Safety Monitoring reports for all cancer based protocols conducted at the University of Pennsylvania.  The DSMC reviews these document and data on a monthly basis and makes recommendation necessary to ensure subject safety and study integrity.  Additionally, the DSMC monitors and audits the progress and conduct of all cancer based studies in accordance with their NCI approved Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. 
 Protocol Deviations/Exceptions Occasionally, the investigator may need to deviate from the approved protocol.   Exception   A one time, intentional action or process that departs from the IRB and CTSRMC approved study protocol, intended for one occurrence. If the action disrupts the study progress, such that the study design or outcome (endpoints) may be compromised, or the action compromises the safety and welfare of study subjects, advance documented IRB and DSMC approval is required.    • For in-house studies with a Medical Monitor or Safety Monitoring Committee (not DSMB),  approval must be obtained from the Medical Monitor or Safety Monitoring Committee prior to  submitting your exception request to the DSMC.   Upon receipt of a deviation request, the DSMC (or only the Chair as appropriate) will review the  request within 24 hours and notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_824760]’s decision.  The DSMC may request  additional information to assist with the determination.  The IRB will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_824761].      Deviation  A one time, unintentional action or process that departs from the IRB and CTSRMC approved study protocol, involving one incident and identified retrospectively, after the event occurred. If the impact on the protocol disrupts the study design, may affect the outcome (endpoints) or compromises the safety and welfare of the subjects, the deviation must be reported to the CTSRMC within five business days and the IRB within ten business days.    Examples of Exceptions/Deviations that must be submitted (not meant to be inclusive)  May/can/have affects/affected subject safety. So, a subject missing a visit is not an issue  unless a critical/important treatment or procedure was missed and must have been done at  
that specific time.   
 • Violate eligibility  
 • Dose adjustment   • Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]   • Affect sample size (adding more subjects, decreasing number of subjects, changing the  number of subject in a specific arm/cohort)      Other deviations should be explained in a memo to file or on a deviation log.  Upon receipt of a deviation request, the DSMC (or only the Chair as appropriate) will review the report and notify

This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_824796] [INVESTIGATOR_824760]’s assessment of the impact of the deviation.  The DSMC may request 
additional information to assist with the assessment.  The IRB will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_824762].  The DSMC may also request the DOCM conduct follow-up compliance activities to address issues revealed by [CONTACT_824797].      All deviations from the study protocol will be handled as follows:  Eligibility -  Deviations from established eligibility criteria will not be allowed.  If the 
investigator believes that a subject would truly benefit f rom the protocol therapy and there are no 
other viable options, then the protocol should be amended to reflect the change in restrictions.  There may be situations where the deviation from eligibility may not warrant a study amendment (e.g. a necessary test/procedure being a few days outside of the eligibility window, subject taking a concomitant med ication  within recent timeframe etc.).  These deviations must still be reviewed 
and approved in advance of enrolling the subject.     The IRB must be notified of the planned deviation and a copy of all applicable amended study documents must be sent to the IRB.  The planned deviation must also be submitted to the DSMC for evaluation.  The DSMC does not approve deviations but rather provides and unbiased assessment of the appropriateness of the request.  Both committees must be given sufficient time to review the request, gather additional information as necessary and make a decision.  
 Other Reportable - Deviations that affect the protocol treatment administration (i.e. dose 
administered, route/method of administration etc.), dose adjustment schema, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], modification to follow -up, removal of safety assessments/follow-up visits, accrual goal or any 
deviation that may affect  the study outcome analysis or study integrity must be approved by [CONTACT_824798].    Non-Reportable-  During the course of a study, there may be times when deviations are outside 
of the control of the investigator (i.e. subject not showing up for a study visit, lab errors, subject confusion etc.).  These type of deviations are not reportable (unless they occur at a level that impacts any of the reportable categories) but must be documented in a timely manner to show the impact of the deviation and corrective/follow-up actions that were taken.  Documentation can be in the clinic/progress notes or note/memo to file.  Notes/memos should be signed and dated.   Reporting Deviations/Exceptions Reports to the IRB and DSMC will be done via HS -ERA and the DSMC website

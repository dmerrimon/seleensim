 SPECIFIC AIMS  
Concisely state the objectives of the study and the hypothesis being tested. 
 
The purpose of this study is to examine the relative effectiveness of omega -
3 fatty acid s plus inositol versus N -acetylcysteine (NAC) in reducing 
symptoms of emotional dysregulation in children and adolescents (ages 5 -
17) with non -verbal learning disability ( NVLD ) and /or autism spectrum 
disorders ( ASD). We hypothesize that omega -3 fatty acids plus inositol 
combined intervention will result in improved outcomes relative to using NAC as monotherapy.  
 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Provide a brief paragraph summarizing prior experience important for understanding the 
proposed study and procedures. 
 
Emotional dysregulatio n affects a sizeable minority of  children with non -
verbal learning disability (NVLD) and related conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The occurrence of a mood disorder in these 
children and adolescents further compromises their problematic course and 
outcome. Unfortunately , none of the current conventional treatments for 
mood disorders can claim a high level of efficacy combined with easy tolerability in all individuals. Increasingly, clinicians, researchers, and 
patient s and their families are turning to natural products considered 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_308654] to support 
the use of these dietary supplements in pediatric populations.  
 Omega -3 fatty acids (including EPA and DHA) are important components of 
cell membranes and are important for cell -to-cell communication in the 
brain. However, abnormalities in fatty acid composition of phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_253690] (Horrobin & Bennett, 1999; Horrobin, Glen, & Vaddadi, 1994; Peet, Murphy, Shay, & Horrobin, 1998; Stoll et al., 1999). 
With reduced omega -[ADDRESS_308655] of , the phosphatidylinositol 
(PI) cycle and is therefore common and widely found, located primarily within cell membranes (Baraban, Worley, & Snyder, 1989). Although the 
mechanism of action of inositol remains unclear, we can indirectly presume 
from the avail able evidence that subjects with mood disorders experience a 
decrease in brain myo -inositol, which adversely affects the functioning of the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_253691], which in turn results in mood changes. Dietary 
supplement with inositol, therefore, could improve the functioning of the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_253692].  
 N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an acetylated amino acid and a precursor of 
glutathione that acts as an antioxidant in the brain to reduce oxidative stress, which has been implicated in bipolar disorder and major depression 
(Magalhaes et al., 2011). The main interest in psychiatry involves NAC as a 
precursor to glutathione, which acts as a potent antioxidant diminishing free radicals that can lead to cell damage and death. Glutathione is a major 
endogenous antioxidant in the brain. Glutathione is a molecule compr ising 
three peptides: glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. The addition of the cysteine is the rate -limiting step, and NAC provides this key substrate for 
the creation of glutathione.  
 
Recent work by [CONTACT_253705] -3 fatty acids (Wilens et al., 2017; 
Wozniak et al., 2007) and an even more robust outcome when combining omega -3 fatty acids with inositol (Wozniak et al., 2015 ; Wozniak et al., 
2016). Work by [CONTACT_253706] r group also suggests that N -acetylcysteine (NAC) is 
helpful in the management of emotional dysregulation in youth. However, 
these studies are not directly comparable as they were conducted at 
different times with differe nt study clinicians and age groups.

Briefly describe study procedures.  Include any local site restrictions, for example, “Subjects 
enrolled at Partners will not participate in the pharmacokinetic portion of the study.”  Describe 
study endpoints.
 Interested parents/guardians will first complete a phone screen with the 
study coordinator or a research assistant. If the child meets eligibility criteria 
based on the phone screen, the parent/guardian will be asked to complete the Child Behavior Checklis t (CBCL) via RedCap, a secure online data 
capture system. The parent/guardian will be provided with an online consent statement and asked to indicate their agreements to participate in the online 
questionnaire portion of the study before they are brought t he CBCL.  
 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October 15, 2014     6  If a parent/guardian has completed pre -screening procedures for another 
research study or the clinic in our department within the past [ADDRESS_308660]’s 
legal guardian will then answer questionnaires regarding current medicatio ns 
and demographic details. They will also complete the BRIEF, SRS, P -YMRS, 
and CDI questionnaires. A study clinician will complete the Columbia Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) to asse ss past and current suicidality and 
self-harmful behaviors ; conduct an observational mental status exam; 
record baseline severity scores of Clinical Global Impression (CGI) for mania, 
depression, and overall bipolar disorder;  and will review current medications 
and recommend any medication taper.  A trained member of study staff will 
obtain and record height and weight for all subjects.  A urine pregnancy test 
will be conducted for all female subjects who have reached menstruation. If the test is positive, the subject will not be able to participate in the study 
and she will be informed of the results, along with her parent/guardian if she  
agrees. Even if she does not agree, the study doctor may still decide, based on the subject’s age, maturity, or medical condition, to inform the 
parent/guardian.   
 In the case that it is deemed necessary at the in -person screening/baseline 
visit (i.e. if a subject has plans to make changes to concomitant medications 
or cannot begin active participation in the study at the time for some other 
reason), the subject will be allowed to enroll in the study and complete study 
tasks that require the subject to be in the office at that time and to complete 
all other tasks that can be completed remotely at a later date, without 
returning to the office.  
 During the COVID -19 pandemic, the screening/baseline visit will be 
conducted remotely. Revised timeline: parental consent and child assent   
dispensation of study medication   week 99/[ADDRESS_308661] and their parent(s)/guardian will complete a tele -visit with a study clinician in order to 
complete all study procedures requiring a clinician. All typi[INVESTIGATOR_253694]/rating scales can safely and effectively be completed 
remotely during the tele -visit with the study clinician and the subject and 
their parent(s)/guardian. The study coordinator will also complete a phone 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_308662] and their parent(s)/guardian on the same day as the 
tele-visit with the study clinician in order to complete the following 
procedures. Parents/guardians will be asked to self -report height and 
weight. It will be noted that these measu rements were provided by a 
parent/guardian report rather than study staff measurement. For any female subjects who have begun menstruation, a pregnancy test will be ordered 
using study funds and sent directly to the subject’s home address. The test 
will be  ordered in advance to ensure delivery before the w eek 99/[ADDRESS_308663]/subject’s parent or guardian will 
verbally report the result to the study coordinator, and will also send visual 
confirmation (i.e. a photo of the test with results send via secure email) 
prior to beginning the study treatment. Finally, the study coordi nator will 
send an email link to the parent(s)/guardians to complete a battery of 
assessments/rating scales via REDCap. All typi[INVESTIGATOR_253695]/rating scales can safely and effectively be completed remotely. 
These assessments/rating scal es are already approved to be completed via 
email link to REDCap for the week [ADDRESS_308664] CGI (Severity and 
Improvement) scales for mania, depression, and overall bipolar disorder, 
record any side effects or adverse events , and review and confirm parent -
reported info rmation.  
 
At endpoint, parents will report current weight and complete the BRIEF and SRS questionnaires in addition to the weekly questionnaires. 
 
For studies involving treatment or diagnosis, provide information about standard of care at 
Partners (e.g., BWH, MGH) and indicate how the study procedures differ from standard care.  
Provide information on available alternative treatments, procedures, or methods of diagnosis.
 
Families with children and adolescents with NVLD/ASD and emotional 
dysregulation can speak with their primary care doctor to obtain a 
prescription for medication to treat mood disorders or receive a referral to a 
specialist. Available medications for treating severe mood problems in 
children include atypi[INVESTIGATOR_253696]. The study doctor can discuss the risks and 
benefits of other treatments with potential participants and their 
parent/gua rdian prior to enrollment.  
 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_308665]’s response to study drug is closely 
monitored. Previous studies by [CONTACT_253707]. All procedures used in 
this study are consistent with sound research design and do not 
unnecessarily expose subjects to risk. Clear drop criteria will be employed, 
as described below.  
 We will be using secure Partners workstations to access Vidyo, a 
videoconferencing platform, in combination with Skills Based Routing (SBR), 
a patient management software, to conduct the weekly study visits. Both 
Vidyo and SBR are secure mediums. Partners Information Systems and MGH 
Health Information Services have already approved this technology for use.  
 
Describe explicitly the methods for ensuring the safety of subjects.  Provide objective criteria for 
removing a subject from the study, for example, objective criteria for worsening disease/lack of 
improvement and/or unacceptable adverse events.  The inclusion of objective drop criteria is 
especially important in studies designed with placebo control groups.
 
Each week, a study clinician will record  any adverse events.  
 Poor response to treatment, leading to drop from the study, will be 
measures by a CGI- bipolar score that is 2 points higher (more severe) than 
baseline for more than 2 consecutive weeks or a P -YMRS score that is 30% 
higher than baseline for more than 2 consecutive weeks  only if the P -YMRS 
is in a clinically significant range of >[ADDRESS_308666] should score a 4 or 
higher on the C -SSRS, he or she will be dropped from the study. The study 
clinician will assess the level of risk and take appropriate actions, including an immediate referral to emergency services.  
 
In addition, drop from the study will occur at clinician discretion for 
worsening of clinical course, non- compliance with treatment, or inability to 
tolerate study treatment.  
 
Subjects who fail to keep study appointments or are non- complaint (less 
than 70% compliance for 2 weeks or longer) may be dropped from the study. If a subject becomes pregnant or is found to be abusing substances 
during the study, he or she will be dropped from the study. These study 
subjects will be given a referral for local treatment.  
 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October 15, 2014     9  FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
Provide a brief description of any foreseeable risks and discomforts to subjects.  Include those 
related to drugs/devices/procedures being studied and/or administered/performed solely for 
research purposes.  In addition, include psychosocial risks, and ris ks related to privacy and 
confidentiality.  When applicable, describe risks to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_17779].
 
Potential side effects are few and will be monitored for throughout the 
research study. Consent forms will clearly list potential treatment side 
effects. Since they are natural products, it appears that omega -[ADDRESS_308667] a low potential for unwanted side effects or negative effects on the child’s growth and development. It should also be noted that 
no important toxic effects have been reported in previous use in humans and animals.  
 The treatment omega -[ADDRESS_308668] been reported include fatigue, 
nervousness, vivid dreams, heartburn, pruritus (without rash), and headaches (Berk et al., 2008;  Ghanizadeh & Moghimi -Sarani, 2013;  Gray et 
al., 2012;  Hardan et al., 2012;  Mardikian, LaRowe, Hedden, Kalivas, & 
Malcolm, 2007) . Serious side effects are uncommon.  
 Answering detailed questionnaires may create a mild degree of 
inconvenience or emotional upset for the subjects. T he PI [INVESTIGATOR_253697] 
(available by [CONTACT_37160] 24 hours per day). All of the information about 
participants will be treated confidentially. Subjects may refuse to answer any 
of these questions.  
 Having treated hundreds of bipolar patients, we are aware that this is a  
group of very highly disturbed children at risk for psychosis, suicide and  
disruption in the family. Although it is unlikely that these risks will be  
exacerbated by [CONTACT_760], we will be vigilant regarding the potential for  
patient decompensation or dangerousness to self or others. In the execution  
of research protocols, our primary concern is always the safety of the  
research participant. Given the especially unstable nature of bipolar  
patients, we will be available to the study staff and to handle clinical  
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_308669] 
in the event of a crisis with call to 911 and local police.  
 
EXPECTED BENEFITS  
Describe both the expected benefits to individual subjects participating in the research and the 
importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result from the study.  Provide 
a brief, realistic summary of potential benefits to subjects, fo r example, “It is hoped that the 
treatment will result in a partial reduction in tumor size in at least 25% of the enrolled subjects.”  
Indicate how the results of the study will benefit future patients with the disease/condition being 
studied and/or socie ty, e.g., through increased knowledge of human physiology or behavior, 
improved safety, or technological advances.  
 
There may be no direct benefit to the subjects participating in this trial. 
Potential benefits to the subjects include rapid access to treatment, free 
psychiatric assessment, and a free trial of potentially useful treatments with 
low associated risks, and the opportunity to contribute to medical science 
and thus help others with the same disorder(s).  
 
EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS  
The risks and benefits of the research must be fairly distributed among the populations that stand 
to benefit from it.  No group of persons, for example, men, women, pregnant women, children, 
and minorities, should be categorically excluded from the resear ch without a good scientific or 
ethical reason to do so.  Please provide the basis for concluding that the study population is 
representative of the population that stands to potentially benefit from this research.
 
We do not include pregnant or nursing women due to the unknown effects of 
study treatments on fetuses and infants . We do not involve prisoners or 
institutionalized individuals in our studies. Those who are economically or educationally disadvantaged, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253698], or patients from medical 
practices of the investigators are eligible to participate in our studies  
provided that they meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. Females and 
minorities are also welcome to participate as study subjects, provided t hat 
they meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
 
When people who do not speak English are excluded from participation in the research, provide 
the scientific rationale for doing so.  Individuals who do not speak English should not be denied 
participation in research simply because it is inconvenient to t ranslate the consent form in 
different languages and to have an interpreter present.
 
Subjects who do not understand English cannot participate in our studies, for 
the study requires that subjects and their parents be able to verbally

RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES  
Explain in detail the specific methodology that will be used to recruit subjects.  Specifically 
address how, when, where and by [CONTACT_94878].  Include any specific recruitment methods used to enhance r ecruitment of women 
and minorities.
 
We will use advertisements on the Internet, including advertisements posted 
on the Partners Clinical trials website, and flyers to recruit participants. 
Individuals who respond  to advertising will go through a phone screen with 
the study coordinator or research assistant via phone and will then be screened by a study clinician.  
 
Participants may also be recruited from the referral pool of existing and new 
patients in the Pediatric Psychopharmacology Program and the MGH Child 
Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic , from the pool of children screened for 
participation in Protocol #2019 -P-000846 (“ An Open- Label Clinical Trial 
Conducted via Telepsychiatry of Complementary and Alternative Treatments (Omega -3 Fatty Acids and Inositol vs. N -acetylcysteine) for the Management 
of Emotional Dysregulation in Youth ”), or via advertising in the local med ia. 
Clinicians may introduce the study to appropriate patients and their 
parent/guardian and provide those who may be interested in participating 
with the study coordinator’s contact [CONTACT_3031]. The patient and their 
parent/guardian may then contact [CONTACT_253708].  
Prospective subjects and their  parents/  guardians will not be contact[CONTACT_253709].   
 
All subjects that enter the study will undergo standard screening and 
diagnostic procedures.  
 
Provide details of remuneration, when applicable.  Even when subjects may derive medical 
benefit from participation, it is often the case that extra hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], meals at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],

CONSENT PROCEDURES  
Explain in detail how, when, where, and by [CONTACT_17844], and the timing of consent 
(i.e., how long subjects will be given to consider participation).  For most studies involving more 
than minimal risk and all studies involving investigational drugs/devices, a licensed physician 
investigator must obtain informed consent.  When subjects are to be enrolled from among the 
investigators’ own patients, describe how the potential for coercion will be avoided.
 
Informed consent and assent will be obtained prior to performing any protocol procedures and prior to administration of study treatment. The 
informed consent and assent documents will be used to explain in simple 
terms the risks and benefits of study parti cipation to the subject and his/her 
parents/guardians. The nature of the study will be fully explained to the subject and his/her parents/guardians by a board- certified physician who is 
either the primary investigator or co -investigator. The subject and his/her 
parents/guardians will be encouraged to ask questions pertaining to their 
participation in the study, and they may take as much time as they feel 
necessary to consider their participation, as well as consult with their family 
members or physician. Pa rticipation in this study is voluntary and the 
subjects may withdraw from the study at any time.  
 
Assent for adolescents ages 14 -17 will be documented on a separate line of 
the parent/guardian consent form. Assent for children ages 7-[ADDRESS_308672] 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October 15, 2014     13  re-sign on a designated line on the parent/guardian consent form when they 
reach the age of maturity.  
 
Should a subject be enrolled from a clinician’s own patients, the subject will 
be offered the opportunity to take as much time as they feel necessary to 
review to consent form at their convenience and consider their participation 
in the study. Study staff will be available to contact [CONTACT_253710]. All subjects recruited 
from among the investigator’s own patients will be offered the opportunity to 
discuss participation with a physician colleague  before deciding whether or 
not to participate. In this case, the investigator will also reinforce that participation in voluntary and the decision not to participate will not affect 
their care, now or in the future.  
 During the COVID -19 pandemic, informed consent will be obtained remotely. 
This may be done in 2 ways:  
1. Using Adobe eSignature : [CONTACT_253716] (when applicable) to subjects in PDF form ready for Adobe 
eSignature [CONTACT_35256] a brief statement (email template submitted) 
explaining why they are receiving this form and further instructions. 
Study staff will schedule a time for the subject and their 
parent(s)/guardian to meet with a study clinician via phone to complete 
consent. The study clinician  will have a conversation by [CONTACT_253711](s)/guardian to obtain consent in the usual fashion: review the consent form, review inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
review risks and benefits of the study, review alternatives to 
partic ipation, and answer any questions subjects and their 
parent(s)/guardian may have. If the subject and their parent(s)/guardian decide to participate, they will sign the consent form and assent form 
(when applicable) using Adobe eSignature. The study clinician will also sign the consent form using Adobe eSignature [CONTACT_253717]. Subjects will be sent a copy of the signed form by 
[CONTACT_35239].  
2. Mailing a physical copy of forms : Study staff will send the consent form 
and assent form (when applicable) to subjects via mail or secure email 
along with a brief letter explaining why they are receiving this form and 
the phone number to call once they receive it. Study staff will schedu le a 
time for the subject and their parent(s)/guardian to meet with a study clinician via phone to complete consent once they receive the forms via 
mail or email. The study clinician will have a conversation by [CONTACT_253712](s)/guardian to obtain consent in the usual 
fashion: review the consent form, review inclusion and exclusion criteria, review risks and benefits of the study, review alternatives to 
participation, and answer any questions subjects  and their 
parent(s)/guardian may have. If the subject and their parent(s)/guardian 
decide to participate, they will sign the consent form and assent form 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  October 15, 2014     14  (when applicable) and mail it to the study clinician, who will also sign the 
consent form prior to beginning any study procedures. Subjects will be 
sent a copy of the signed form by [CONTACT_253713].  
 
NOTE: When subjects are unable to give consent due to age (minors) or impaired decision-
making capacity, complete the forms for Research Involving Children as Subjects of Research 
and/or Research Involving Individuals with Impaired Decision- making Capacity , available on

DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
Describe the plan for monitoring the data to ensure the safety of subjects.  The plan should 
include a brief description of (1) the safety and/or efficacy data that will be reviewed; (2) the 
planned frequency of review; and (3) who will be responsible for this review and for determining

collected.  This typi[INVESTIGATOR_17786]/or medical 
record numbers; removing face sheets or other identifiers from c ompleted 
surveys/questionnaires; proper disposal of printed computer data; limited access to study data; 
use of password -protected computer databases; training for research staff on the importance of 
confidentiality of data, and storing research records in a secure location.   
 
NOTE: Additional measures, such as obtaining a Certificate of Confidentiality, should be 
considered and are strongly encouraged when the research involves the collection of sensitive 
data, such as sexual, criminal or illegal behaviors.
 
Subject information collected during the study will be kept confidential by 
[CONTACT_253714]. Subjects will be assigned code -names and ID 
numbers. Only study staff and c o-investigators will have access to the 
information linking subjects to their ID numbers. Information will be held 
and processed on a computer. Access to these computerized records will be 
password protected and restricted to study staff.  
 
Data will be collected using RedCap, an electronic data capture system that 
streamlines data collection and management and ensures data integrity. 
RedCap software allows researchers to design and implement study surveys 
for collection, storage, retrieving, and manipulating data electronical ly. 
Subjects and their guardians will enter survey responses into electronic assessment forms, using personal computers. Study staff will use terminals 
at the research site or encrypted computers. The responses will then be 
transmitted securely via an encr ypted connection and stored in a secures 
database. Electronic data capture obviated the need for subsequent data entry by [CONTACT_3655], thus minimizing human error.  Data will be collected on paper 
versions of scales or assessments and entered manually if the electronic data capture system, RedCap, is not functioning properly.

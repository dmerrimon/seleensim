trauma. We hypothesize that a stationary head CT (s -HCT) system based on the 
carbon nanotube linear array x-ray source can provide diagnostic quality head CT 
images.  Patients included in the study will be [ADDRESS_1140874] scan of the head . 
1.2 Disease Background   
The diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become of paramount importance in combat casualty care. In a resource poor environment, the lack of advanced cross-sectional imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) limits the ability of forward  surgical teams to diagnose life threatening head 
injuries. As a result, the vast majority of patients with head trauma must be transported to facilities with CT or MRI capabilities to better assess the extent of head trauma. This approach leads to medically unnecessary transport of soldiers and potentially delays in appropriate care. Unfortunately, conventional imaging modalities such as ultrasound and conventional radiographs are essentially useless in diagnosing life-threatening conditions in the brain, including intraparenchymal hemorrhage, subdural or epi[INVESTIGATOR_76211]. To achieve the appropriate level of care, advanced imaging modalities are necessary. Current computed tomography systems, unfortunately, are highly complex instruments requiring the rapid rotation of an x-ray tube and detector system. This approach does not lend itself to use except for in well controlled environments, such as within a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
1.[ADDRESS_1140875] developed the carbon nanotube (CNT) linear x- ray source 
array. This x-ray generation approach utilizes field emission which allows two 
primary advantages: precise x-ray pulse control and close physical placement of multiple x -ray sources.  A solid state x -ray source array can provide the necessary 
x-ray projections to generate CT images without any mechanical motion of components. The goal of this study is to evaluate a solid -state no -rotation x- ray 
CT system for applications in head trauma imaging in the field.   We have designed  a solid -state head CT system to enable head CT scanning at 
Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) and potentially in patient transport vehicles (ambulance or helicopter). A number of mobile dedicated head CT scanners are commercially available.

opposite a set of three detectors that are positioned similar to Figure 1(b), with the position of the head represented by [CONTACT_822666] (brown cylinder with small inserts). The x -ray tubes, Model IND1645, are manufactured by [CONTACT_822667] 
(http://www.nuraytech.com/en/ ) and were custom developed for this purpose.  
 The detectors that will be used are the  Xineos 2301 (Teledyne DALSA) 
(https://www.teledynedalsa.com/en/products/imaging/medical-x- ray-
detectors/xineos-scanning/, a [ADDRESS_1140877], such that the patient is positioned within the head holder on the scanner. Then, once scanning begins, the patient will be automatically advanced into the system across the scan range of the head, during which the necessary x- ray projections will be acquired.

1.4 Rationale 
The current Neurosurgery and Severe Head Injury guidelines in the Joint Trauma 
System (JTS) Clinical Practice Guide (CPG) dictate that all moderate to severe head injuries received a head CT. However, though neurosurgical support is available at Role [ADDRESS_1140878] also shown that 
identifying intracranial hemorrhage, is an essential component in providing the appropriate level of care and predicting patient outcomes. 
 
Computed tomography (CT) has become one of the most commonly used imaging modalities. The popularity of CT as a diagnostic imaging tool is understandable – no other modality offers 3- D imaging with the same rapi[INVESTIGATOR_822661]. An  estimated [ADDRESS_1140879]  for the detection of a hemorrhage 
using a reader study. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
• To estimate  specificity of stationary head CT for the detection of a 
hemorrhage using a reader study. 
• To estimate  sensitivity of stationary head CT for the detection of a fracture 
using a reader study. 
• To estimate  specificity of stationary head CT for the detection of a fracture 
using a reader study. 
• To evaluate the reader confidence for the stationary head CT in detecting 
hemorrhage or fracture as compared to a conventional CT.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1140880] for the detection of a hemorrhage using a reader 
study is defined as the ability of readers (radiologists) to use the stationary head CT to predict hemorrhage using the clinical assessment at [ADDRESS_1140881]. The interpretation of the clinical data will be made by [CONTACT_9154] (Brian D. Sindelar). A neuroradiologist (J. Keith Smith) may  re-interpret images 
as necessary at the request of the PI.

4.2 Study Procedures  
4.2.1 Enrollment/Recruitment  
We will recruit [ADDRESS_1140883] system. We will 
recruit medically stable patients with head trauma or known intracranial hemorrhage (subdural or intraparenchymal) or skull fractures with recent CT imaging. Subjects will be serially recruited with the assistance of the neurosurgery department at  our institution. If the attending physician deems a patient stable , a 
clinical coordinator will obtain informed consent from the subject.  If the 
coordinator has questions about patient competency to provide informed consent, a qualified healthcare provider will make the appropriate determination.  In some cases, patients may have recently suffered from a trauma and may be seen for a follow up appointment.  In these cases, the s-HCT scan may be obtained prior to the follow up head CT as long as it meets the 5 day window.  Given our high institutional volume of ruptured brain aneurysms and our Level I trauma status, we do not anticipate difficulty with patient volume.  
 Participants’ involvement is limited to one single visit, which will include the s -
HCT scan.  No follow- up is necessary.   
4.2.[ADDRESS_1140884] Abstraction  
Data will be collected from participants and their medical records, as applicable.  We will follow participants’ medical records for 3 months following imaging to

hemorrhage or fracture.    We will document clinical information using the TBI common data elements

(CDE) and a local data research electronic data capture system (REDCap ). 
However, as these patients and their imaging data are obtained in a sub- acute 
setting and from a variety of pathologies, we will not utilize the full TBI CDE data documentation. Specifically, we will utilize the General Core, Demographics, and Injury Presentation. Our clinical scans adhere to the Imaging Diagnostic Imaging Parameters for MRI and Protocols for MRI and CT Guidelines. 
4.2.[ADDRESS_1140886]. We hypothesize that the sensitivity of reader’s in the interpretation of images from the s -HCT system will be similar to 
that of the conventional CT imaging. The paired images will be presented to five readers. Readers will be blinded to which imaging modality is being presented.  There is, however, readers may be able to distinguish the imaging modality based on the images.  Our readers will consist of a trauma surgeon,  neurosurgeon or 
neuro radiologist and non-study radiologists to better reflect the different clinical backgrounds that may be available in a Role [ADDRESS_1140887] images wil l be presented in random order, and the readers will be asked 
to identify the presence of hemorrhage (yes/no), the location of the pathology if present and confidence level (0 through 100% in 10% increments). Readers will also be asked to perform interpretations with the appropriate Imaging CT CDE, including the Marshall CT TBI classification code  30, hemorrhage and fracture 
elements. Four weeks later, the other modality for each patient will be presented in a random order and the same scoring obtained. 
 
 The scoring scheme used by [CONTACT_822668] 1) hemorrhage (yes/no) with confidence 0-100% in 10% increments, 2) fracture (yes/no) with confidence 0-100% in 10% increments, 3) streak artifacts (yes/no), and ) other artifacts (yes/no).

• The device will not be implanted. 
• The device is not intended to support or sustain human life. 
• The device is not being used of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease. 
• The device does not present a potential for serious risk to health, safety, or welfare of a subject.

commencement of imaging.  Practically, we anticipate that many of the scans will be obtained in a subacute post- trauma / event time frame, to insure there is no additional risk to the subjects 
due to subject transport.   Claustrophobia (fear of being enclosed in tight spaces) may occur during the procedure and the noise of the x-ray machine could be uncomfortable. Some people may feel discomfort lying on the CT table or may experience anxiety while the table slides in and out of the CTscanner. 
6.0 UNANTICIPATED CONCERNS (DEVICES)  
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL  Non-Oncology Imaging Protocol Template  
DEPARTMENT OF RADIOLOGY   February [ADDRESS_1140891] (UADE)  
The investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations define an unanticipated 
adverse device effect (UADE) as “any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect,  problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare  of subjects” 
(21 CFR 812.3(s)). 
6.2 Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
As defined by [CONTACT_11604]’s IRB, unanticipated problems involving risks to study subjects refers to any incident, experience, or outcome that: 
• Is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, 
such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent 
document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; 
• Is related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the research; and  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the research than was previously known or recognized.

the FDA, the manufacturer of the device and the UNC  IRB as soon as possible, 
but in no event later than [ADDRESS_1140893] learns of the event (§ 812.150(a)(1)), using the MedWatch Form 3500A.   The s ponsor- 
investigator  must immediately conduct an evaluation of a UADE and must report the results of the evaluation to FDA, the UNC IRB , and participating investigators 
within [ADDRESS_1140894] (§§ 812.46(b), 812.150(b)(1)).   For this device study, we will submit a report of a UADE to the manufacturer and the IRB as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_1140895] learn of the event.

Any events that meet the criteria for “Unanticipated Problems” as defined by 
[CONTACT_11604]’s IRB must be reported by [CONTACT_65479]’s web-based reporting system.    Any unanticipated problem that occurs during the conduct of this study and that 
meets at least  the first two criteria listed in  section 6.[ADDRESS_1140896] be reported to the

  A table of power calculations for various values of N and various equivalence differences is shown below. For reference, a recent review of the sensitivity of skull radiographs to intracerebral hemorrhage gives a sensitivity range of 3 to 75%. 
[ADDRESS_1140899] statistic from the model parameter estimates will be used to 
compare the mean sensitivity / specificity metrics between the conventional head CT and the simulated solid -state head CT. Possible interactions between the 
modalities and the readers and the hemorrhage type/locations will also be included and tested for statistical significa nce. Sensitivity and specificity on the 
presence of clinically actionable pathology will also be assessed, based on consensus read of the conventional imaging.     For each confidence comparison, the average confidence scores and the corresponding standard deviations will be reported. To test whether the mean Power vs D0.L by N

[ADDRESS_1140901]. Additionally, a random intercept is used in the model to account for the correlation among readers when reading the images from the same patient. The Wald’s test based on model fit will be used to test whether the grand mean parameter is larger than zero. When the p -value from this tes t is less than 0.05, it will be concluded that 
there exists significant evidence that readers have more confidence with the s-HCT  modality compared to the other modality. ROC curves will be evaluated. 
 We will also descriptively compare inter -reader agreement by [CONTACT_822671], confidence in image interpretation, presence and location of hemorrhage, and presence and location of fractures by [CONTACT_822672]’ kappa.     All statistical estimates of population parameters will be tabulated along with 
corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) and/or standard errors (SEs) to convey levels of precision / imprecision.   Hypothesis tests that are deemed to be not 
statistically significant will be indicated as  inconclusive.  
8.[ADDRESS_1140902] (IRB) Approval and Consent 
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in 
accordance with federally mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the consent form and protocol. 
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.    Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by [CONTACT_44316]. Once this essential information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by [CONTACT_10001]-approved consent form. 
 Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_23522].

8.3.1 Data Collection and Documentation  
We will utilize TBI CDE to document the imaging data of patients for data 
analysis purposes. The online REDCap software system provided by [CONTACT_11604]’s TraCS Institute will be used for data collection and management , which will 
ensure that data collected are consistent and follow standardized coding. Data will be entered in to REDCap  by [CONTACT_152378] 5 business days. 
 All data requested on the case report forms ( CRF s) will be recorded  by [CONTACT_20234] .  All missing data will be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left 
blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, the study team will write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, the study team will write “N/A”.  Every attempt will be made to ensure that there is as little missing data as possible including reminder phone calls and follow -up 
phone calls, if a subject misses a visit.   However, this study is limited  to a single 
subject visit so missing values will be minimal.   If subjects withdraw, the reason 
for subject withdrawal will be documented in the study database.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_1140903] Operating Procedures to ensure data quality , 
completeness, and accuracy are maintained for this study. The Department of Radiology’s Internal Quality Assurance program will verify a random selection of

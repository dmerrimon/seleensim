1.2.2  To evaluate biomarkers of therapy efficacy as well as initiate patient derived xenograft 
 (PDX) models:  
• Targeted or whole exome sequencing for BRCA pathway mutations and other somatic 
and germline alterations  
• RNA sequencing  
• Evaluation of changes in immune response  
• Transcriptional profile to assess TNBC subtype, BRCA -ness signature [CONTACT_816207]  
• Functional proteomics with reverse phase protein array (RPPA)  
• Generate PDX models and mammosphere cultures from patient derived tumors  
• PTEN, gamma -H2A.X, Ki -67 and cleaved caspase 3 by [CONTACT_4658]  
 
 
1.3 Research Hypothesis  
 
Sequential administration of Talazoparib followed by [CONTACT_816174] a known BRCA deleterious mutation will be well tolerated and show respon se to 
single agent therapy.  
 
A biomarker -defined population can be identified in which a higher pCR rate is observed in 
subjects treated with Talazoparib followed by [CONTACT_816175].  
 
PDX models will provide models to understand s ensitivity and resistance mechanisms.

Version 15 ; July 29, [ADDRESS_1130026] common cause of death in 
women (after lung cancer), and is the main cause of death in women between the ages of 45 and 55. 
[1] However , over the last decade the mortality rate has declined in the [LOCATION_002] and United 
Kingdom largely because of widespread use of mammog raphy, breast cancer screening programs, 
advances in evaluation technique, and more effective adjuvant treatments . [2] 
 
Studies that compared preoperative (neoadjuvant or primary systemic therapy) and adjuvant 
chemotherapy in patients with early stage brea st cancer have shown no difference in overall 
survival or disease free survival. [3] Primary systemic therapy (PST) is increasingly being used in 
the management of patients with early breast cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy allows for 
monitoring of respons e to chemotherapy and enhances chances of breast conservation surgery 
and/or a better cosmetic outcome following mastectomy in patients with locally advanced breast 
cancer. [4, 5] Additionally, the neoadjuvant setting is ideal for correlative studies to id entify breast 
cancer patients likely to best respond to therapy. The provision of a surgical specimen, at the end of 
therapy, allows for a more rapid assessment of response (pathological responses) than adjuvant 
trials. Pathological complete response (pCR)  is widely accepted as a valuable prognostic indicator 
of long -term outcome after neoadjuvant therapy. [6]  
 
2.2 Primary Systemic Therapy: Historical Perspective  
 
The rationale for considering the evaluation of primary systemic therapy (PST) in patients wit h 
operable breast cancer began to evolve as clinical observations demonstrated the utility of this 
approach in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), [7 -9]  and inflammatory breast 
cancer (IBC). In addition, preclinical observations, [10, 11]  and mathematical models of tumor 
growth, dissemination, and development of resistance to chemotherapy support the use of PST 
rather than adjuvant therapy. These could lead to achieve longer disease -free survival (DFS) and 
overall survival (OS), presumably  through early treatment of systemic micrometastatic disease. 
Since its initial use in the early 1970s, PST has become the standard of care for management of 
LABC and IBC, and increasingly been used for treatment of large operable and more recently for 
early-stage breast cancer.  
 
Chemo -, hormone -, and anti -HER2 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_816155] - types 
of breast cancer. PST provides several advantages, including down -staging allowing surgery for 
non-operable breast cancer, and increas ing breast -conservative surgery rate in patients with large 
operable breast cancer.  It also provides an early surrogate factor, pCR, for long -term outcome and 
in-vivo model to assess clinical benefit and finally a research tool for understanding breast ca ncer 
biology and treatment mechanisms of action(s). pCR has also been recently added as an appropriate 
endpoint for FDA approval pathways in breast cancer.  
2014 -0045  
Version 15 ; July 29, [ADDRESS_1130027] cancer other than 
directly measuring survival (DFS, and OS), which requires a large number of patients and long 
term follow -up. These endpoints included clinical response, radiologic response, rate of breast 
conservative surgery (BCS), and pathologic response. The results of several studies have been 
shown that pCR is predictive of long -term survival. [12 -15] At present, the achievement of pCR 
has emerged as the primary end point of mo st interest in the clinical research literature. Attainment 
of pCR is associated with a favorable prognosis; such patients have a far lower risk of subsequent 
recurrence than do patients with residual invasive tumor at the time of surgery, and also seem to  
have improved overall survival. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_816156], there is no consensus on the measurement of this important endpoint. Clinical and 
pathological responses are both frequently used as objective measurem ents of effectiveness of PST.  
Three of the most commonly used criteria in the literature are those by [CONTACT_684790] [15], Feldman 
et al, [12] and most recently Symmans and collaborators from the University of [LOCATION_007], MD 
Anderson Cancer Center. The first [ADDRESS_1130028] part, differ 
from each other.  
 
In general, 60% to 90% of patients with invasive breast cancer show clinical response, however, 
only 3% to 30% of patients achieve pCR. Two large studies using PST, NSABP B-[ADDRESS_1130029] and axillary tissues removed at the time of surgery. [7]  
 
Symmans et al [16] showed a continuous index combining pathologic measurements of the primary 
tumor (size and cellularity) and nodal metastase s (number and size) and tested as an independent 
predictor of distant relapse -free survival. Patients with minimal residual disease (RD) (RCB -I) 
carried the same prognosis as pCR (RCB -0). On the other hand, patients with extensive RD (RCB -
III) had poor pro gnosis. RCB was independently prognostic in a multivariate model that included 
age, pretreatment clinical stage, hormone receptor status, hormone therapy, and pathologic 
response (pathologic complete response [pCR] vs. RD; hazard ratio = 2.50; 95% CI 1.70 to 3.69; P 
< .001).  Seventeen per cent of patients had minimal RD (RCB -I). These patients carried the same 
prognosis as pCR (RCB -0).  Extensive RD (RCB -III) was seen in 13% of patients.  It was 
associated with poor prognosis, regardless of hormone recepto r status, adjuvant hormone therapy, 
or pathologic American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of residual disease. The calculation 
formula and detailed description can be found at a dedicated Web site:

compared with adjuvant systemic treatment.  
 

2014 -0045  
Version 15 ; July 29, [ADDRESS_1130031] (NSABP) conducted a large 
phase III study (NSABP P -18) to compare PST and post -operative chemotherapy.  [6, 17, 18]  
  
 
A total of 1,[ADDRESS_1130032] cancer were randomized to rece ive four cycles 
of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) either as PST or adjuvant therapy. Breast tumor size 
was reduced in 79% of patient after PST, and 36% had a clinical complete response (cCR) rate, 
43% clinical partial response (cPR), and a 13% pCR. Clinical nodal response was observed in 89% 
of patients with node -positive disease; 73% had nodal cCR, and 44% of these patients had pCR.  At 
9 years, the authors reported no difference in DFS (67% for both groups) or OS (69% PST vs. 70% 
adjuvant groups; P  = .80).  However, there was a favor trend in favor of PST in women less than 50 
years old (HR 0.85, P = .053). The investigators reported that the use of PST improved BCS from 
60% to 67% (P < .01). Even with improved rates of BCS, there was no statistical ly significant 
difference in the rate of local recurrence between treatment groups (P =  
.12). A marginal increase in the rate of local recurrence for patients who were converted from 
proposed mastectomy to segmental mastectomy (15.9%) was seen when compare d with patients 
who were eligible to undergo segmental mastectomy as per initial plan (9.9%) (P = .04). This 
difference loses statistical significance after controlling for age and initial clinical tumor size.  
 
NSABP B -27, a large prospective randomized tr ial, [14, 19] was designed to evaluate whether the 
addition of docetaxel to AC PST would prolong DFS and OS and improve clinical and pathologic 
tumor response rates.  Women with operable breast cancer (n = 2,411) were randomly assigned to 
receive either [ADDRESS_1130033] AC followed by [CONTACT_44850] (Group 1), 4 cycles of AC followed by 4 
cycles of docetaxel, followed by [CONTACT_44850] (Group 2), or 4 cycles of AC followed by [CONTACT_684791] 
4 cycles of docetaxel (Group 3).  The addition of docetaxel to AC increased pCR rate (26.1% vs 
13.7%; P < .001).  pCR was a significant predictor of OS (HR 0.33, P <  
.0001).  The pathologic nodal status after chemotherapy was also a significant prognostic factor for 
OS (P < .0001).  However, this study did not prospectively assess the role of docetaxel in 
patients with residual disease after PST AC.  There was no stratification after AC. The patients with 
all eight cycles of PST administered up front had a trend toward improvement in RFS. [14] One 
caveat with this study is that at the t ime it was conducted, all patients received tamoxifen, which 
was initiated concurrently with chemotherapy, regardless of hormone -receptor status. The 
simultaneous administration of tamoxifen and chemotherapy may have decreased the benefit from 
chemotherapy . 
 
The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Trial [ADDRESS_1130034] or adjuvant 
FEC-100. [20] The primary objective of this study was to determine th e impact of timing of therapy 
on DFS and OS. After a follow -up of 4 -years the OS was 82% for PST group compared to 84% for 
those treated in the adjuvant setting (P = .38). For patient who received PST, the overall response 
rate (ORR) (cCR + cPR) was 49% an d cCR 7%. Thirteen of 350 patients (4%) in the PST group 
had a pCR. For this study, response was determined by [CONTACT_816176], possibly explaining the low overall clinical CR. PST was associated with an 
increased r ate of 35% BCS compared to 22% for the control group. The rate of locoregional 
recurrence was equivalent between treatment groups.  
 
The European Cooperative Trial in Operable (ECTO) Breast Cancer randomly tested the efficacy 
of postoperative chemotherapy d oxorubicin followed by [CONTACT_207135], methotrexate, and  
2014 -0045  
Version 15 ; July 29, 2019  
 
10 
 5-fluorouracil (CMF) or doxorubicin and paclitaxel (AP) followed by [CONTACT_816177].  [21, 22] A total of 1,[ADDRESS_1130035] induced 
a clinical response in 78% of the patients and pCR 23%. There was no significance in RFS when 
AP/CMF was given before surgery compared with the same regimen given after surgery (HR, 1.21; 
P = .18) However, the rate of breast -conserving surgery was significantl y higher with preoperative 
chemotherapy (63% vs. 34%; P < .001)  
 
The wide variety of PST clinical trials recently completed or ongoing in early breast cancer reflects 
the pressing need to identify the most effective agents and regiments to optimize both su rgical and 
long-term outcomes for these patients.  
 
Lastly, Buzdar el al [23] compared two taxane schedules (weekly paclitaxel [WP] x 12 versus 3 - 
week docetaxel plus capecitabine (DC) x 4 cycles, followed by: [CONTACT_456363] -100 x 4 cycles. Patients were 
randomized 1: 1 and stratified by [CONTACT_684794] (PST vs. adjuvant). A total of [ADDRESS_1130036] and 107 were randomized to WP arm and 109 to DC arm. The pCR rates 
were 18.7% and 17.4% on each arm, respectively (P = .81). The DC arm had higher i ncidence of 
hand foot syndrome, and myelosuppression, and WP treatment higher neurotoxicity. The primary 
endpoint was DFS, and the secondary endpoint pCR. The study was designated to include [ADDRESS_1130037] 80% power. After interim analysis in June [ADDRESS_1130038] setting had 
same efficacy and WP was associated with better tolerance and less toxicity.  
 
 
2.5 Current Primary Systemic Chemotherapy R egimens  
 
Pathological complete response rates are generally higher with anthracycline -based combinations 
than with regimens not containing anthracyclines (doxorubicin or Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962]). Consequently, most 
PST regimens for breast cancer are anthracycline -based  combination: AC 
(doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide); FAC (fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide); CE 
(cyclophosphamide/epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962]); and FEC (fluorouracil/epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962]/cyclophosphamide). However, 
other non -anthracycline based drug combinations, such as CMF 
(cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil) with or without a taxane, are also in common use. 
Increased duration of chemotherapy administration from 12 to 18 weeks or longer improves pCR 
rates. [5] The addition of paclitaxel or docetaxel to anthracyclines b ased regimes has resulted in 
pCR of up to 28.2%. [24] The Aberdeen study showed that tumors that did not respond to an 
anthracycline -based regimen may respond to docetaxel. Additionally sequential and non - 
concomitant addition of taxane to anthracycline -based chemotherapy results in higher pCR rates. 
[25] 
 
Additionally, from data presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in 2013 by [CONTACT_816178], 
et al [26] evaluated the addition of both carboplatin and bevacizumab in a 2 x 2 trial design to 
neoadjuvant weekly paclitaxel and AC. There was a 13% absolute difference in pCR. However, 
given toxicity profile, this combination has been administered but as of the date of this protocol, not 
added to the Institutional or NCCN guidelines. Therefore given that this trial is being written while 
there  is a shifting landscape of neoa djuvant regimens in the neoadjuvant setting, we will refer to the 
physician’s treatment of choice that includes a taxane, anthracycline and may or may not include 
carboplatin.

2.[ADDRESS_1130039] reduces the size of the primary tumor and lymph node metastasis in 
greater than 80% of cases, increasing the probability that brea st-conserving surgery can be 
performed. [12 -15] A second advantage of this sequencing schedule is that it permits the 
assessment of response of the primary tumor to the particular chemotherapy regimen. This 
assessment allows the opportunity to “cross -over”  to a different regimen for an individual patient if 
2014 -0045  
Version 15 ; July 29, [ADDRESS_1130040] (NSABP) began the B -[ADDRESS_1130041] whether sequencing chemotherapy before 
surgery would improve outcomes. [12 -14] The trial enrolled [ADDRESS_1130042] carcinoma and randomized them to receive fou r cycles of 
doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide (AC) either before or after surgical treatment. The primary end 
points of this trial were disease -free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). With respect to these 
end points, the trial was a negative study. Afte r 9 years, the OS and DFS were nearly identical 
between the two groups (P = .80, P =0.5, respectively). A second large randomized prospective trial 
that directly compared the sequencing of chemotherapy and surgery was performed by [CONTACT_816179] (EORTC). [15] This trial randomized 
698 patients to preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy comprised of four cycles of FEC (5 -
Fluorouracil, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], and Cyclophosphamide). Like the NSABP B -18 trial, the EORTC stu dy 
demonstrated equivalent survival and rates of distant metastases between the two treatment arms.  
 
Gianni el al, [16] randomized 1,[ADDRESS_1130043] cancer > 2 cm to three groups: adjuvant 
doxorubicin (A) followed by [CONTACT_207135], methotrexate , and 5 -FU (CMF) (Sx→A→CMF); 
adjuvant doxorubicin and paclitaxel (AT) followed by [CONTACT_684796] (Sx→AT→CMF); and neoadjuvant 
AT followed by [CONTACT_684796] (AT→CMF→Sx). pCR rates in the neoadjuvant arm were 23% in breast 
only and 20% in breast plus axilla patients. The breast c onservative treatment rate was also better in 
this arm (65% vs. 34%; P <.001). At [ADDRESS_1130044] in terms of freedom for progression (P =.24) and OS (P = .81)  
 
A recent meta -analysis addressed directly the qu estion of neoadjuvant versus adjuvant 
chemotherapy. [17] Nine randomized clinical trials involving 3,[ADDRESS_1130045] was associated with a higher locoregional recurrence (risk ratio, [RR] 1.22; P = 
.15). This greater risk was largely attributed to those trials in which radiation alone without surgery 
was used in patients who achieved a clinical complete response to PST. (RR, 1.53; P =.009).  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1130046] Cancer  
 
A pathological complete response (pCR) implies the absence of residual invas ive disease following 
PST. Pathological complete response is associated with long -term survival, and has been adopted 
as the primary end point for neoadjuvant trials.  While it is generally held that a definition of pCR 
should include patients without resi dual invasive carcinoma in the breast (pT0), the presence of 
nodal metastasis, minimal residual cellularity, and residual in situ carcinoma are not consistently 
defined as pCR or residual disease (RD). When there is no residual invasive cancer in the breas t, 
the number of involved axillary lymph nodes is inversely related to survival. [18] Conversely, 
patients who convert to node -negative status after treatment have excellent survival, even if there is 
RD in the breast. [19] Symmans and collaborators, [31] recently introduced a residual breast cancer 
burden (RCB) index as a novel independent new risk factor that improves the prediction of distant 
relapse after PST co mpared with currently used risk factors. RBC can be divided in four categories: 
patients with  minimal residual disease (RBC -I) have the same 5 -year prognosis as those with pCR

 (RBC -0), irrespective of the type of neoadjuvant chemotherapy administered, adjuvant hormonal 
therapy, or the pathologic stage of RD. Extensive RD (RBC -III) was associated w ith poor

therapy or the pathologic stage of RB.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1130047] and ovarian cancers through the use 
of genetic linkage analysis.[32 -34] Since that time, over [ADDRESS_1130048] been identified including both private and founder mutations.[35]  Overall these mutations are 
estimated at 0.1% in the general population. [36 -38] 
 
A recent meta -analysis of ten studies estimated the lifetime risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 
mutation -carriers to be 47 -66% and 40 -57% in BRCA2 mutation -carriers.  The ovarian cancer risk 
was estimated at 35 -46% in BRCA1 mutation -carriers and 13 -23% in BRCA 2 mutation 
carriers.[39]  Other studies have estimated these risks to be even higher.[40]  Given this increasing 
risk of cancers, women with cancers in the family at young age, or multiple cases of breast and/or 
ovarian cancer have sought genetic testing, not only to further manage their own cancer risk, but 
also to share with their family members.  
 
In an analysis by [CONTACT_816180], et al. women with a known BRCA mutation who received neoadjuvant 
therapy at The University of [LOCATION_007] MD Anderson Cancer Center were evalu ated.[41]  Of the 
BRCA1 carriers, 26/57 (46%) achieved a pCR.  In the multivariate model, both BRCA1 and triple 
receptor negative breast cancer (TNBC) were independent predictors of pCR.  In this cohort >80% 
of the patients received an anthracycline and ta xane based therapy.  Other studies have shown a 
significant increase in response to platinum -based therapy in a similar cohort. Silver, et al. 
evaluated 28 women with TNBC who received 4 cycles of cisplatin at 75 mg/m2 every 21 days 
with 22% achieving a pC R.[42]  Both of the BRCA1 mutation carriers had a pCR in this small 
cohort.  Therefore neoadjuvant chemotherapy in BRCA mutation carriers will be important to 
further identify responders and non -responders.  
 
Interestingly, some studies suggest that BRCA mu tation carriers are less sensitive to taxane 
chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.[43] Therefore BRCA mutation status as well as optimizing 
PST will be ever more important in the early breast cancer setting and may have implications as to 
the systemic re gimes evaluated in clinical trials and ultimately chosen for patient care in the future.  
 
At our institution, women and men are referred to the Clinical Cancer Genetics service where they 
are seen and counseled by a genetic counselor as well as a physician .  This service is staffed in the 
Breast Center by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jennifer Litton and [CONTACT_816209] and there are [ADDRESS_1130049] identified over 1000 patients  at our institution with a BRCA mutation with that number 
expected to increase given the increase in awareness and through outreach through the Women’s 
Moonshot Program.  
 
Once a consultation is done, blood is obtained with a usual turn -around time of 2 weeks. Patients 
eligible for this protocol and who mee t National Testing Guidelines [ 44] will have a genetics 
consultation expedited so as not to delay start of preoperative systemic therapy.

2.9 PARP inhibitors  
 
Poly-(adenosine diphosphate [ADP] -ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a family of enzymes responsible 
for multiple cellular processes, including DNA repair through the base excision repair (BER) 
process as well as maintains genetic stability.[45]During DNA repair, when a cell is BRCA 
deficient, the DNA is unable to be repaired through homologous recombinat ion (HR) and therefore 
depends on BER.  PARP inhibitors (PARPi) work by [CONTACT_816181]. Therefore when both HR 
and BER DNA repair pathways are impaired, DNA repair is thwarted cau sing “ synthetic 
lethality.”[46]  Although PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_816157], s olid tumors, most activity has been 
seen to date as single agents concentrated in patients with known BRCA mutations.  
 
Several trials have evaluated PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_816158] (TNBC) as well 
as in BRCA mutation carriers.  Due to o verlappi[INVESTIGATOR_816159], it has been difficult to 
give in combination with other systemic chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_816160].  [47, 48]  
 
Below is a brief overview of selected studies that have reported to date.  Of note, In iparib is not 
included as it was not shown to have superior efficacy when added to gemcitabine and carboplatin 
and late r was not found to inhibit PARP. [49]

Poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) -ribose polymerase (PARP) represents a family of enzymes, of 
which at least 2 (PARP1 and PARP2) play important roles id deoxyribonucleic acid  (DNA) repair. 
The study drug, t alazoparib, is a potent and specific inh ibitor of PARP [ADDRESS_1130057] cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) 
and breast cancer susc eptibility gene 2 (BRCA2), both of which are key components in the pathway 
of repair for DNA double -strand breaks. Treatment with a PARP inhibitor results in cell cycle 
arrest and apoptosis.  
 
2.10.1  Nonclinical Study Findings for Talazoparib  
 
The nonclinical study findings for t alazoparib are described in full in the IB.  The main nonclinical 
findings were early hematological changes and subsequent bone marrow and lymphoid organ 
depletion, as well as focal necrosis, after repeat administration of t alazoparib. These findings were 
in accordance with the mechanism of action and the exposure/ distribution pattern of the study drug 
and were reversible. The hematological changes, which consisted of decreases in the reticulocyte, 
platelet, red blood cell ( RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) counts, were a sensitive and early 
marker of target organ toxicity and were used to clinically monitor safety.  
 
2.10.[ADDRESS_1130058] udies (PRP -001 and PRP -002) of t alazop arib are ongoing and one Phase 3 study

17 
 subjects with advanced hematologica l malignancies was initiated in July 2011.  This study enrolled 
subjects with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or 
mantle cell lymphoma.  
 
The primary objective of the Phase 1 studies is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
once daily, orally  administered t alazoparib, and to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), 
pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy in an expanded cohort of subjects with genetically 
defined tumors.  
 
In June 2013, preliminary da ta from PRP -001 were presented at the American Society of Clinical 
Oncology (ASCO) 2013 that are described below  [54].  As of June 2013, 70 subjects (60 women/10 
men) enrolled into the study; 39 subjects (33 women/6 men) with solid tumors were enrolled in the 
dose escalation phase of the study in 9 cohorts ranging from 25 to 1100 µg/day that defined a MTD 
of 1000 µg/day.  On defining the MTD, [ADDRESS_1130059] cancer, ovarian, and pancreas 
cancer with deleterious germline mutations; a small cell lung cancer; and Ewing’s sarcoma, were 
enrolled in the expansion phase of the study  to further characterize safety and efficacy.  The median 
(range) age for all 70 subjects was 51.5 years (18 to 81), performance status (PS) was 0 (0 to 1) and 
number of prior th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_26615] 4 (1 to 13), with 47 subjects having deleterious BRCA mutations.  
Tumors (number with deleterious BRCA ½ mutations) included 34 ovarian/primary peritoneal (28); 
[ADDRESS_1130060] (18); 8 Ewing’s; 4 pancreas; 2 colon; 1 prostrate (1), and 1 mullerian ca rcinosarcoma. A 
total of 27 and 21 subjects had BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, respectively.  
 
Dose -limiting thrombocytopenia occurred in 1 of 6 subjects at 900 µg/day and 2 of 5 subjects at 
1100 µg/day, respectively.  Based on these results, the MTD was define d at a dose of 1000  
µg/day.  Related adverse events (AEs) occurring in >10% of all 70 subjects included fatigue (30%), 
nausea (29%), alopecia (21%), anemia (20%), thrombocytopenia (19%), and neutropenia (11%).  
One subject had drug -related Grade [ADDRESS_1130061] (1%), anemia and thrombocytopenia each in 9 subjects (13%) and neutropenia in 4 subjects 
(6%).  Dose reductions occurred in 11 subjects due to myelosuppression.  No subjects discontinued 
due to AE s. 
 
Inhibition of PARP activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cell was observed at doses > 100  
µg/day.  Talazoparib plasma concentrations peaked [ADDRESS_1130062] -dose; in general, exposure 
increased dose proportionally.  Steady state plasma concentratio ns were reached by [CONTACT_816182]; mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax): 0.30 to 25.4 ng/mL 
and area under the concentration time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0 -24): 3.96 to 203 ng -hr/mL 
across the 25 to 1100 µg/day dose ran ge after 28 days of daily dosing.  
 
Objective (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors [RECIST] v.1.1) and/or cancer antigen 
(CA) -125 responses occurred at doses >  100 µg/day in 11 of 25 (44%) and 19 of 27 (70%) subjects 
with BRCA -carrier ovarian and peritoneal cancer, respectively.  Clinical benefit (complete 
response [CR]/partial response [PR]/stable disease [SD]>24 weeks) occurred in 23 of 28 subjects 
(82%) with BRCA -carrier ovarian and peritoneal cancer.  
 
Objective responses (ORs) occurred in 10 of 18 (56%) BRCA -carrier breast -cancer subjects. 
Clinical benefit (CR/PR/SD>12 weeks) occurred in 14 of 18 (78%) of BRCA -carriers.

 Overall, talazoparib was well tolerate d with impressive anti -tumor activity in subjects with BRCA 
mutations with a single agent recommended Phase 2 trial dose of 1000 µg/day due to dose - limiting 
thrombocytopenia.  
 
Study 673 -301, initiated on 30 October 2013, is an open -label, randomized, para llel, 2 -arm study of 
talazoparib versus protocol -specific physician’s choice therapy in subjects with germline BRCA 
mutation locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer. As of 30 November 2013, a total of 3 
subjects had been enrolled in the study.  
  
 
2.10.3 Preliminary Findings from this Trial as of 3/11/2016.  
 
As this study was initially written as a feasibility to see if patients could tolerate therapy and if 20 
patients could accrue within 2 years, the team has reviewed the current status of this tr ial as of 
3/11/2016.  At this time [ADDRESS_1130063] been enrolled.  Although approval was 04/2016, it was not 
until 08/[ADDRESS_1130064] completed 2 months of therapy, the average shrinkage has been 76% decrease (Length x  
width x height x π)/6, (range  =29-97% decrease in volume). One of t he [ADDRESS_1130065] observed 0/11 toxicities, we invoke t he 
beta-binomial probability model. Assuming a n uninformative beta (1 , 1) prior, the posterior 
probability that the toxicity rate > 30% (i.e., Pr  (Ptox > 0.3 | data)) is 1.4%. A 90% credible interval 
on the estimated toxicity rate is 0% to 22%.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1130066] demonstrated defects in homologous 
recombination (HR) and have been shown in several trials to have response to PARP inhibitors. 
Therefore understanding the mechanisms of r esponse and resistance to PARP inhibitors as well as 
identifying patients who may not avoid prolonged cytotoxic therapy would be best studied in the 
neoadjuvant setting.  
 
It is important prior to the outset of a larger randomized clinical trial to evaluate  this strategy in a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_816161].  First we need to understand if it is safe to give preoperative talazoparib under close 
monitoring.  If we discover significant benefit, we may proceed with tailoring the definitive clinical 
trial by [CONTACT_816183].

resistance.  
 
Expansion Phase: After the first 13 patients were enrolled, discussions with the investigators and the 
sponsors discussed the results available from these patients with an average tumor volume decrease 
of 76% , median decrease of 88% after  just [ADDRESS_1130068] cancer who carry a BRCA deleterious 
mutation. An initial feasibility portion of the study was conducted to estimate toxicity, response, 
and ability to accrue. After 13 patients were accrued to the study an expansion cohort was added  
and once approved by [CONTACT_1201], would close the feasibility portion of this study.

4.3 Treatment Administration Plan  
 
All subjects will be registered in CORe and the data will be entered in PMDS/CORe, the 
electronic CRF. Given the early responses seen in the first 11 patients with 2 months of 
talazoparib, understanding the pCR rate of single agent talazoparib in this setting will be 
2014 -0045  
Version 15 ; July 29, [ADDRESS_1130075] of 28 days  (+/-3 days) . At 
the time of surgery, residual disease will be quantified  by [CONTACT_761075] .  After surgery, 
the patient and physician may proceed to receive or not receive physician’s choice of systemic 
therapy.  Dose modifications will continue as per section 4.6.  
 
Talazoparib is considered a cytotoxic agent; precautions regarding appropriate secure storage 
and handling must be used by [CONTACT_129000], including personal protective clothing, 
disposable gloves, and equipment. Subjects should be advised that oral anticancer agents are 
toxic substances and that (other than the subject) caregivers should always use gloves when 
handling the capsules.  
 
  Once the Expansion cohort amendment portion of this trial is approved by [CONTACT_816186] , we will stop accruing to the feasibility portion of this trial.  
 
 
 
4.3.1  Study Visits  
 
Study visits are as outlined in Section 10.  Due to scheduling , these visits can occur +/ - 3 days from 
the required time of follow -up.  Given that there may be cytopenias associated with this therapy, 
weekly CBCs will be obtained (+/- 7 days). During the expansion phase  CBC’s will be every 2 
weeks x 3 and then monthly  after that.  On days where no other testing is required these blood tests 
can occur at any CLIA -certified laboratory (Cycle 1, Day  15). The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_816163], determine clinical significance fo r abnormal labs, and 
sign and date the report.  
 
4.3.2  Biopsies/Correlative Studies  
 
Ideally up to 4 core biopsies will be obtained at each time point if enough material is available, for 
a total of up to 12 core biopsies for the trial.  Up to t wo fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026] (FNAs) will also be 
obtained at each time point for a total of up to 6 FNA’s for the trial, which will be used for the 
patient derived xenograft models. Pre -study biopsies, as well as biopsies within [ADDRESS_1130076] ultrasounds will be performed after every 2 cycles  (+/- 7 days). Therapy 
will be discontinued  if the Physician or PI [INVESTIGATOR_816164].  A 
biopsy of the tumor at the time of progression will be obtained prior to switching to the standard of 
care treatment  of the physician’s choice. T issue samples  at the time of progressive disease may

Version 15 ; July 29, 2019  
 
23 
 occur at the time o f surgery  in the form of residual tissue  and therefore a biopsy would not be 
required.  
 
During the expansion phase of this trial , ultrasounds will be obtained every  2 cycles  (+/- 1 week), 
and at progression with biopsy if progression occurs and further systemic therapy is given prior to 
definitive surgery.  
 
These tissue specimens will be evaluated for response and biological markers of response and/or 
resistance.  
 
4.3.[ADDRESS_1130077] of care therapy of the treating physician’s choice or 
proceed to surgery if the treating physician feels that is in the patient’s best interest. A biopsy of the 
tumor will be obtained prior to switching to the standard of care regimen of the physician’s choice.  
 
If progressive disease occurs while on standard of care treatment, the subjects should remain in the 
study until after they have undergone definitive surgery.   
 
As an exploratory endpoint , during the tumor core biopsy, patients will also be offered an optional 
contralateral breast core biopsy to evaluate biomarker changes in the unaffected, yet high risk, 
breast tissue. BRCA mutation carriers have an up to 60% risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_816165]. Since no prevention agents exist for BRCA mutation carriers, this preliminary data 
would help us to further understand the potential (preventative) e ffects of PARP inhibitors in high 
risk breast tissue. Without any preliminary knowledge, it will not be possible to conduct a 
preventative study with PARP inhibitors in women without breast cancer. Biomarkers that will be 
evaluated will be similar to the o nes that will be evaluated in the tumor core biopsy (section 1.2.1) 
with the exception of the generation of PDX models and transcriptional profile to assess TNBC 
subtype. Currently there is no data in the literature related to biomarker changes in high ris k breast 
tissue in women treated with PARP inhibitors.

et al[26] evaluating the addition of both carboplatin as discussed in the background, the treating 
physician may choose to add o r not add carboplatin to this standard of care regimen as well.  
 
For those patients participating in the Expansion Cohort, all systemic therapy will be at the 
discretion of the treating physician after surgery.  
 
Participants will be followed until the time  of surgery. Any available remaining tissue collected 
from this surgery will be used for the correlative studies.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5 STUDY DESIGN SCHEMA  (Original Study Schema)  
 
  
* Therapy will be discontinued at progression of disease. A biopsy  of the tumor at the time of 
progression will be obtained prior to switching to the standard of care regimen of the physician’s 
choice. Tissue samples at the time of progressive disease may occur at the surgical visit in the form 
of residual tissue and the refore a biopsy would not be required. (See Section 4.3.2).

  Expansion Cohort  
   
*Therapy will be discontinued at progression of disease. A biopsy of the tumor at the time of 
progression will be obtained prior to switching to the standard of care regimen of the physician’s 
choice. Tissue samples at the time of progressive disease may occur at the surgical visit in the form 
of residual tissue and therefore a biopsy would not be required.  
 
During the expansion phase , ultrasounds will be obtained ever y 2 cycles  (+/- 1 week) , and at 
progression with a biopsy if progression occurs and further systemic therapy is given prior to 
definitive surgery.  
 
 
 
4.6 Dose modification  
 
 
Talazoparib Dosing  
 
Talazoparib should be taken orally once daily (i.e., continuous daily dosing) at approximately the 
same time each day (preferably in the morning).   
Patient s will document the time of dosing on a “pi[INVESTIGATOR_816166]”. This will be reviewed by [CONTACT_816189], along with reconciliation and documentation of any remaining 
study drug. The completed pi[INVESTIGATOR_816167]. 
Daily dosing of talazoparib can be interrupted for recovery from toxicity for up to 28 days. 
Thereafter, treatment at the same or a reduced dose can be considered based on a discussion 
between sponsor or designee and investigator if evidence of respons e or clinical benefit to 
talazoparib is noted.  
 
 
 

2014 -0045  
Version 15 ; July 29, 2019  
 
26 
 Dose modifications should be made based on observed toxicity as follows:  
 
• Grade 1 or 2 toxicity: No requirement for dose interruption or dose reduction.  
 If the toxicity persists at grade 2, a dose reduction to the next lower dose level (e.g. from 
 1.0 mg/day to 0.75 mg/day) may be implemented at the discretion of the Investigator  
 
• Grade 3 toxicity: Daily dosing should be stopped.  
 Talazoparib dosing may resume at the next lower dose level (e.g., from 1.0 mg/day to  
 0.75 mg/day, 0.75 mg/day to 0.5 mg/day) when toxicity resolves to grade [ADDRESS_1130081] therapy if drug is 
 held more than 28  days.  
 
• Grade 4 toxicity: Daily dosing should be stopped.  
 With the approval of the PI, talazoparib may be resumed at a lower dose level (1 or 2 
 dose level decrease) when the toxicity has resolved to grade [ADDRESS_1130082] therapy if drug is held more than 28 days.  
 
 
                        Dose Modifications for Toxicities Dose Level  
  Initial dose level    1.0 mg/day  
  First dose level reduction   0.75 mg/day  
  Second dose level reduction   0.5 mg/da y 
  Third dose level reduction   0.25 mg/day  
  
 
 
 
 
4.7 Concurrent and supportive care  
 
In general, the use of any concomitant medication/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_816168], including drugs given prophylactically (e.g., Antiemetics +/ - steroids, colony 
stimulating factors), with the following exceptions:  
 
• No other investigational therapy should be given to patients.  
 
• No anticancer agents other than the study medications administered as part of this study 
 protocol should be given to patients.  
 
 
The concurrent use of all other drugs, over -the-counter medications, or alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_816169] . 
 
 
4.8 Criteria for discontinuation of study drug  
  
All patients will be analyzed on an intent -to-treat basis. Treatment will continue until one of the 
following criteria is met:  
 
2014 -0045  
Version 15 ; July 29, [ADDRESS_1130083] of care therapy.  Management  of the systemic therapy and further local therapy will then 
be per the treating physician’s preferences.  
 
If a patient develops unacceptable toxicity (defined as toxicity necessitating the discontinuation of 
study drug) the patient will be removed from th e study treatment plan. Further treatment will be 
individualized for these patients.  
 
Completion of all prescribed protocol therapy.  
 
In the judgment of the investigator that the treatment is not in the best interest of the patient. 
Removal from study  
Data  will be collected  until the day after surger y. The patient will then come off study with regards 
to data collection.  
 
Should a patient withdraw consent, the patient will be removed from study at that time and no 
further data will be collected.  
  
 
 
 
4.[ADDRESS_1130084] been enrolled.  If greater 
than 33% of the patients enrolled have either a grade 4 toxicity possibly, probably, or definitely 
related to the treatment as attributed by [CONTACT_079], or requires a delay in treatment 
for greater than 4 weeks due to toxicity, we will suspend accrual to the trial  
 
The secondary endpoint will be to assess response as per radiographic evaluation of the tumor by 
[CONTACT_816190] 2  cycles  of single agent talazoparib. Bi -dimensional measurements will be 
used to evaluate response. A 20% increase in bi -dimensional primary tumor size or 20% increase in 
the size of any measurable, biopsy -proven regional lymphadenopathy will constitute progressi on 
and removal from the talazoparib single agent treatment.   In addition, pathologic complete 
response (pCR) and RCB will be measured and documented in the pathology report. pCR is defined 
in this study as complete absence of any viable invasive cancer ce lls in the resected breast and 
lymph nodes.  
 
In cases where [ADDRESS_1130085], the volume of the lesion 
will be estimated by:  
 
2014 -0045  
Version 15 ; July 29, 2019  
 
28 
 (Length x width x height x π)/6.  And changes in tumor volume can then be estimated. If usi ng the 
3 dimensional measurements, there is a > 20% increase in the volume measurement, the patient will 
be taken off of study and then proceed with physician’s choice chemotherapy.  
 
In the Expansion Cohort,  the endpoint will be pathologic response and res idual cancer burden 
(RCB).  
 
In the initial phase of this study, feasibility will be considered achieved if the treatment is proven 
safe and all 20 patients are able to be accrued within 2 years from initiating accrual.  
 
However, after the initial 13 patie nts were accrued, given the significant response to single agent 
therapy, the protocol was amended to allow an expansion group of patients to continue to 4 and up 
to 6 months , then proceed to surgery and receive systemic therapy after surgery in the adjuva nt 
setting.  
 
4.10   Definition of Residual Cancer Burden  
 
The residual cancer burden (RCB) as a continuous variable derived from the primary tumor 
dimensions, cellularity of the tumor bed, and axillary nodal burden. RCB can also be divided into 
four classe s (RCB -0 to RCB -III) and may be collected as part of the study when all information is 
available in order to calculate.  
RCB -0 (pCR), Minimal RCB (RCB -I), Moderate RCB (RCB -II), and Extensive RCB (RCB -III). 
The following parameters are required from pathologic examination in order to calculate  
Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) after neoadjuvant treatment:  
 
 
 
1. The largest two dimensions (mms) of the residual tumor bed in the breast (largest tumor bed 
if multicen tric disease)  
 
2. Submission of the entire largest cross -sectional area of the residual tumor bed for histologic 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], with specific identification of those slides in the pathology report (e.g. "the largest cross -
sectional area of primary tumor bed was submitted in cassettes A5 - A9")  
 
 • If the residual tumor is large (i.e. largest di > 5 cm), then at least [ADDRESS_1130086] cross -sectional area are sufficient, but should be   
  identified in the original patholog y report (e.g. "representative sections from the  
  largest cross - sectional area of primary tumor bed were submitted in cassettes A5  
  - A9")  
 
3. Histologic assessment of the percentage of the tumor bed area that contains carcinoma 
 (all carcinoma, i.e. invasive and in situ), select one of the following:  
 
 0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%  
 
 • To assess cellularity it is helpful to scan across the sections of tumor bed and then  
  estimate the average cellularity from the different m icroscopic fields.  
 
2014 -0045  
Version 15 ; July 29, 2019  
 
29 
  • When estimating percentage cancer cellularity in any microscopic field, compare  
  the involved area with obvious standards, e.g. more or less than half, one quarter,  
  one fifth, one tenth, one twentieth, etc.  
 
 • Expect there to b e variable cellularity within the cross section of any tumor bed,  
  but estimate the overall cellularity from the average of the estimates in different  
  microscopic fields of the tumor bed.  
 
 • e.g. if cellularity in different fields of the tumor bed we re estimated as 20%, 10%,  
  20%, 0%, 20%, 30%, then an average estimate of overall cellularity would be  
  20%.  
 
4. Histologic estimate of the percentage of the carcinoma in the tumor bed that is in situ, 
 select one of the following:  
 
 0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%  
 
5. The number of positive (metastatic) lymph nodes  
 
6. The largest diameter (mm) of the largest nodal metastasis

5.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
5.1 Biopsies  
Up to f our core biopsies at each time point, will be obtained prior to initiation of therapy with 
talazoparib, within 7 days prior to the completion of talazoparib (prior to initiation of systemic 
chemotherapy) and residual tissue available af ter surgery will be collected once all diagnostic 
testing needed for patient care is completed. Additionally, up to two FNA’s will be collected at 
each time point to be used for the patient derived xenograft models. For expansion cohort patients, 
biopsies will only be obtained prior to the initiation of therapy. Tissue collected from participating 
subjects will be de - linked from all personal identifiers per institutional tissue banking procedures.  
 
The following tissue analyses will be completed if suffici ent tissue is able to be obtained:  
• Targeted or whole exome sequencing for BRCA pathway mutations and other somatic 
 and germline alterations  
• RNA sequencing  
• Evaluation of changes in immune response  
• Transcriptional profile to assess TNBC subtype, BRC A-ness signature [CONTACT_816208]  
• Functional proteomics with reverse phase protein array (RPPA)  
• Generate PDX models and mammosphere cultures from patient derived tumors  
• PTEN, gamma -H2A.X, Ki -67 and cleaved caspase 3 by [CONTACT_4658]  
 
 
5.2 Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX)  
Fresh tumor tissue obtained from patients with BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1130087] cancer will be used to:  
2014 -0045  
Version 15 ; July 29, 2019  
 
30 
  
 • Process the tumor for implanting into the humanized mammary fat pads of NOD  
  SCID mice to create a collection of HIM/PDX  models of BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1130088] cancer.  
 
 • Process the tumor to generate mammosphere cultures for performing   
  comprehensive functional genomic screens in vivo.  
 
We intend to build a collection of Human -In-Mouse (HIM) models of BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1130089] cancer 
and to explore the efficacy of novel targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. To create these models, we “humanize” the 
4th mammary fat pads of NOD SCID mice by [CONTACT_816191][INVESTIGATOR_816170] a human stromal microenvironment. Tumor cells 
obtained from patients with BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1130090] cancer are then engrafted into the humanized 
mammary fat pads of these mice. A  major strength of the HIM model is that it uses tumors that are 
obtained directly from patients and immediately transplanted and propagated in the context of 
humanized mammary fat pads of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_241628], resulting in a closer resemblance to the human 
tumo r counterpart than established cell lines. Once established, the tumors will be expanded in 
mice to generate a collection of BRCA1/2 -mutant HIM models. To ensure that our HIMs maintain 
their similarity to the initial tumors we will perform gene expression analysis and IHC at regular 
intervals. We will use these established models as pre - clinical models of BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1130091] of cell cycle checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination with DNA 
damaging agents and PARP inhibitors. Models established from tumors that do not respond to 
therapy will be used to understand resistance mechanisms.  
 
Methods:  
In parallel with establishing the HI M models, we will culture BRCA1/2 -mutant tumor cells under 
conditions that enrich for tumor initiating cells (TICs). TICs  are reportedly responsible for the 
establishment and maintenance of all primary breast tumors and their metastases. TICs can be 
mainta ined in culture by [CONTACT_816192], serum -free media (Mammocult) on 
low binding plates. Under these conditions, cells do not attach to the plate, but rather grow as 
spheres (mammospheres) that retain a relatively high frequency of TI Cs. Mammosphere cultures 
will be established by [CONTACT_816193] (obtained directly from biopsies) into single cells 
suspensions and culturing them in vitro in Mammocult media (STEM cell technologies) on 
ultralow attachment plates. These cells can  be manipulated in vitro and then placed back in the 
mice for phenotypic analysis. We will use these cult ures to perform both gain of function and loss 
of function screens to identify tumor dependencies.  In addition, synthetic lethal screens will be 
conducted in vivo to identify tumor vulnerabilities.  
 
Mouse surgical procedures  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_816171] 4th mammary gl and to create "cleared fat pads” in 
NOD -SCID mice. Three week old female mice will be anesthetized with ketamine ( 86.98 mg/kg 
body weight) and xylazine (13.4 mg/kg body weight) via IP injection. When asleep, tape will be 
applied to the appendages to restrain the animal on its back. An inverted Y -shaped incision will be 
made along the thoracic -inguinal region to expose  the mammary glands. Using the dissecting 
microscope, the 4th nipple is located and cauterized, as well as the blood vessel near the junction 
by [CONTACT_816194] a point on the fat pad bridge between the 4th and 5th fat pads. The 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_816172] a is carefully excised and discarded to create a "cleared fat pad" into which human

matrigel will be 1/2 to 1/[ADDRESS_1130093] generation 
(P1) reaches a diameter of 1.5 cm – [ADDRESS_1130094] generation of xenografts. This 
will continue up until the 10th generation.  
 
5.3 Circulating Biomarkers  
 
 Blood will be collected for germline normal comparison s. One lavender top tube will be collected 
and isolated for PBMC and cfDNA analysis. PBMCs will be collected at pre -treatment on Day 1, 
on week 2 (Day 8), and week 4 (Day 22) for assessment of PARP levels and  
PAR -producing activity.  The collected blood wi ll be institutionally logged using a research 
specific z -code.   
For the Expansion Cohort  - PBMCs will be collected at baseline and at Cycle 3 Day 1 - (Week 9 
Day 1).  
  
Plasma for cfDNA will be collected pre -treatment on Day 1, and within 7 days prior to the 
completion of the 2 months of talazoparib.  Plasma will be collected for exploratory proteomic 
analysis.   
During Expansion  – cfDNA will be collected at baseline, Cycle 3 Day 1, and  if necessary, at the 
time of progression prior to the patient being pla ced on chemotherapy treatment.  
 
5.4        Sample and Data Sharing  
 
Sample sharing:  In some cases samples may be sent to or received from outside collaborators such 
as Broad Institute for next -generation sequencing and/or analysis.  All samples will be sent under a 
specific contract or Material Transfer Agreement (MTA).  We will protect participant’s privacy by 
[CONTACT_816195][INVESTIGATOR_535690].  Data 
will be kept on secure computers and samples will be kept in freezers in locked laboratories and 
buildings.  Additionally in some  other cases, samples may be provided from outside collaborators or 
institutions for discovery and research purposes. In such cases, the samples should be obtained under 
IRB-approved protocols at these outside collaborators and institutions to allow them f or participation 
2014 -0045  
Version 15 ; July 29, 2019  
 
32 
 in this protocol and under a specific grant/ contract or Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) with MD 
Anderson Cancer Center.  
Internal/External Sequencing may be done  here at MD Anderson, in one of the Core labs such as 
Cancer Genomics Lab, b ut in some cases samples may be sent to outside collaborators for sequencing 
and/or analysis such as Broad Institute.   Sequencing performed by [CONTACT_816196]  (MTA).     
Data Sharing:   Researchers can do more powerful studies when they share with each other the 
information they get from studying human samples.  NGS data may be placed in a local M.D. 
Anderson Institutional Data Repository (IDR), such as the acce ss controlled Confederated Data 
Warehouse; where both deposition of and access to data require governance and approval.   In some 
cases, grant requirements may require deposition of large -scale data into the public Genotypes and 
Phenotypes database (dbGaP)  an access controlled database overseen by [CONTACT_29077] (NCBI).  In other cases peer reviewed Journals may require data to be 
shared through a resource such as dbGaP.  Data submitted to those repositories will only be s hared 
in a de -identified fashion and without associated clinical data or identifiers.  This data will be used 
only for research purposes, and the data elements collected and analyzed   will only be those that are 
necessary to conduct this research.  
Database  access additional protections:  The precedent to publically broadcast sequence data has been 
set by [CONTACT_816197], such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Encyclopedia of 
DNA Elements (ENCODE), in order to maximize data utility.   Howeve r, we know there is the 
potential for privacy risks associated with the release of sequence data to databases and while the risk 
may be small it could grow in the future as technology advances.  To minimize this potential, we will 
implement good faith effo rts to ensure patient confidentiality and reduce patient exposure.   The 
database of Genotypes and Phenotypes and others like it are extremely access restricted.  Only 
authorized researchers may deposit or access the data and either or both efforts require  MD Anderson 
institutional approval.  Sequence data will only be broadcast through secure transmission processes.  
All samples will be de -identified with access to the linking table available only to the MD Anderson 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_43865]/her designees.  Only non -identifiable data will be deposited to dbGaP i.e., no linking table 
or access to a linking table will be available.  Research records will be kept separate from medical 
records and patients will not have access to any of the research data.  
 
Protected health in formation (PHI) may be collected from medical records that are related to health 
and/or disease history including test results, medical procedures, and images (such as X -rays) in 
addition demographic and environmental factors may be requested. Researchers will use this 
information to better understand how genes affect health and response to treatment.   All samples 
will be de -identified with access to the linking table available only to the MD Anderson PI [INVESTIGATOR_43865]/her 
designees.

6.0 STUDY DRUG COMPLIANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
6.1 Assessment of Compliance  
 
To ensure that each patient has been complying adequately with his or her study regime, study 
medication will be returned, counted, and recorded at each patient visit. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_816173].  If the 
records show that the patient is taking less than 80% of the required dose, the patient should be 
counseled about her compliance. If compliance continues to be a probl em (as per the physician’s 
discretion or his designated appointee) study drug should be stopped and patient removed from 
study.  
 
 
6.[ADDRESS_1130095] not be used outside the context of the protocol. Under no 
circumstances should the investigator or other site personnel supply study drug to other 
investigators, patients, or clinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by [CONTACT_3181]. 
Institutional policies wi ll be followed as applicable for drug accountability and disposal of 
investigational drugs.  
 
7.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING AND DATA COLLECTION  
 
7.1 Adverse Events  
According to the ICH definition, an adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a 
patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, and that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory find ing), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related 
to the investigational product.  
 
This definition includes intercurrent illnesses or injuries that represent an exacerba tion (increase in 
frequency, severity, or specificity) of pre -existing conditions. Whenever possible, it is preferable to 
record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series of terms relating to a diagnosis.  
 
Adverse event information will be collected in an ongoing fashion through patient reporting AEs to 
their physician or health care provider. Seriousness and relatedness will be assessed by [CONTACT_30780], with appropriate reporting.

7.2 Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE)  
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ser ious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
 • Death  
 • A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places  
  the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the  
  adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that,  
  had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 • A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to  
  conduct normal life functions.  
 • A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or re quire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_45790] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in th is definition. Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependen cy or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).  
 
• Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious   
 adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if 
 deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_693013] I ND Sponsor, IND Office.  
 
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE 
 must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in 
 “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Cen ter Institutional Review Board 
 Policy for Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and 
 Devices”.  Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, 
 must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attri bution (within 5 working days of 
 knowledge of the event). All SAEs (expected or unexpected, causally related or not) must 
 also be reported to  [COMPANY_007] ’s drug safety vendor, [COMPANY_007] U.S. Clinical Trial Department within     
24 hours of the Investigator’s awareness as follows:  
 
 [COMPANY_007] U.S. Clinical Trial Dept.  
 Fax: [PHONE_065]  
   
 
 
Protocol specific reporting criteria:  
 
Pregnancy  
 
2014 -0045  
Version 15 ; July 29, [ADDRESS_1130096] should be reported immediately (within 24 
hours of becoming aware of the pregnancy) to [COMPANY_007] U.S. Clinical Trial Department by [CONTACT_816199] 3500A (MedWatch Form). Every effort should be made to follow the patient through 
resolution of the pregnancy (termination or delivery) and report the resolution of the FDA 3500A 
(MedWatch Form) to [COMPANY_007] U.S. Clinical Trial Department as follows:  
 
 [COMPANY_007] U.S. Clinical Trial Dept.  
 Fax: [PHONE_182]  
   
 
 
• All life -threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related to the study drug, 
 must have a written report submitted within 24 hours (next working day) of knowledge of 
 the eve nt to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.  
 
• Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for safety 
 reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB.  
 
• Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the fir st protocol -specific 
 intervention, until [ADDRESS_1130097] study treatment/intervention, unless the 
 participant withdraws consent. Serious adverse events must be followed until clinical 
 recovery is complete and laboratory tests have returned to bas eline, progression of the 
 event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.  
 
• Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_1130098] be reported to the IND Office. This may include the 
 development of a secondary malignancy.  
 
Reporting to FDA:  
 
• Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] (Safety Project 
 Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_157749], Good Clinical Practices, the protocol 
guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1130099].  
 
Beyond 30 days of treatment, completion of only those SAEs that, in the judgment of the 
investigator, are definitely, possibly or probably related to the study treatment will require 
reporting. Talazoparib serious, related, un labeled, (unexpected) adverse events will be reported to 
the FDA as required by 21 CFR 312.32 by [CONTACT_737]/Sponsor. These reports may be filed 
2014 -0045  
Version 15 ; July 29, 2019  
 
36 
 utilizing the MDACC SAE form.  The Investigator/Sponsor will provide [COMPANY_007]  Drug Safety, with a 
copy of th is report.  
 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) and pregnancy reports whether or not considered drug -related 
should be reported to [COMPANY_007] U.S. Clinical Trial Department (contact [CONTACT_31307]) within 24 
hours of receipt by [CONTACT_093]/sponsor by [CONTACT_816200].  
 
 
For Comparator Drugs / Secondary Suspects (Concomitant Medications), all serious adverse 
experiences will be forwarded to the product manufacturer.  
 
[COMPANY_007] will review AE data as documented in the final study report submitted.  
 
Clinicians should not wait to collect additional information that fully documents the event before 
notifying [COMPANY_007] U.S. Clinical Trial Dept. of an SAE or pregnancy. [COMPANY_007] may be required to report 
certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being notified about the event; 
therefore it is important that clinicians submit additional information requested by [CONTACT_4618] U.S. 
Clinical Trial Dept. as soon as it b ecomes available.  
 
Reporting of SAEs to the IRB will be done in compliance with the standard operating procedures 
and policies of the IRB and with applicable regulatory requirements.

7.4 Monitoring  
 
This study will be monitored for compliance by [CONTACT_472686].  
 
 
7.5 Adverse Event Data Collection  
 
The following information will be collected for all adverse events:  
 
 • Start and stop dates  
 • Severity (grade)  
 • Relationship to study drug (attribution)  
 
Whether or not the subject discontinued treatment due to the AE  
 
Note all AEs on the Adverse Event Case Report Form (CRF) whether or not related to study drug.  
 
Adverse e vents will be graded using CTCAE (version 4.03).  
 
AE grading and assignment of attribution require documentation by [CONTACT_684810].  
2014 -0045  
Version 15 ; July 29, 2019

7.6 AE/SAE Follow up  
 
All AEs/SAEs, including labo ratory abnormalities, that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684787], will be followed up accor ding to good medical practices.  
 
NOTE: If a subject begins a new anticancer therapy, the adverse event reporting period for non - 
serious adve rse events ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be reported if it 
occurs during the serious adverse event reporting period after the last dose of investigational 
product, irrespective of any intervening treatment.  
 
 
 
8.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_816202].  Toxicity will be monitored at each of the study visits and 
documented.  The aggregate toxicity rate will be es timated along with 95% confidence intervals, as 
will the proportions of patients in each of the ultrasound response categories (responding, stable, 
progression) and the RCB categories along with 95% confidence intervals.  
 
As there is currently no data avai lable regarding these endpoints, this feasibility study will provide 
the first available data in order to plan a larger randomized clinical trial with pCR as an endpoint.  
 
Feasibility will be considered to be achieved if the treatment is safe and all [ADDRESS_1130100] been enrolled.  If greater 
than 33% of the patients enrolled have either a grade 4 toxicity attributable to th e treatment, or 
require a delay in treatment for greater than 4 weeks due to toxicity, we will suspend accrual to the 
trial. 
 
Response as evidenced by [CONTACT_816203].  A partial response by [CONTACT_816204]’s g reatest dimension has decreased by 20% or greater. Progression 
will be documented if bi -dimensional primary tumor size or size of any measurable, biopsy -proven 
regional lymphadenopathy has increased by 20% or greater.  Residual Cancer Burden will also be 
calculated when available at the time of definitive surgery.  
 
Biomarker results will be compared between patients with and without pCR as well as by [CONTACT_816205]’s exact test.  
 
Expansion Cohort:  
 
After the first [ADDRESS_1130101] both hormone receptor positive and negative patients, a single agent therapy with a 
2014 -0045  
Version 15 ; July 29, 2019  
 
38 
 30% rate of RCB0 and RCB1 would warrant further investigation into a subsequent larger, 
randomized trial.  This estimat e will be needed to inform and plan for the subsequent definitive 
study. Should 6 patients of these 20 patients in the expansion experience an RCB0 or RCB1 
pathologic response at the time of surgery, this would estimate the RCB0 + RCB1 response of 30% 
with a 95% confidence Interval of 12% - 54%.  
 
9.0 PUBLICATION OF TRIAL RESULTS  
 
Publications resulting from this trial may be developed by [CONTACT_816206] (within 30 days before submission or other public disclosure) to prospectively 
review any proposed publication, abstract or other type of disclosure that reports the results of the 
study.

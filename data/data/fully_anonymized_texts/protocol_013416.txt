1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Background and Rationale 
 
 Background 
 
The Perclose ProGlide Suture-Mediated Closure System and the Perclose ProStyle Suture-
Mediated Closure and Repair System (hereinafter referred to as Perclose SMC) is indicated for 
the percutaneous delivery of a suture for closing the common femoral artery and vein access 
sites of patients who have undergone diagnosis or interventional catheterization procedures. 
The devices can be used for access sites in the common femoral vein, 5F to [ADDRESS_173825] (ASD) 
closure and cardiac ablation.  
 
The use of multiple catheters (sheaths) within the same vein is the standard practice of atrial 
septal defect (ASD) closure. Mahadevan et al. evaluated 65 ASD patients who underwent 
femoral vein closures with the ProGlide SMC and concluded that two ProGlide devices can be 
safely used at two different access sites in the same vein[1]. Hamid et al. reported the safety 
and effectiveness of vein closure, including 107 ASD closures with ProGlide [2]. Cardiac 
ablation is a procedure that can correct arrhythmias. Cardiac ablation uses multiple catheters for 
ablation, imaging (echo), and diagnosis (mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), also pacing when appropriate.  There is no 
standard practice in the selection of the access site of these catheters. Some prefer two access 
vessels (such as two sheaths from the left femoral vein and two from the right femoral vein), and 
some use a single vessel for all sheaths. When vein access is used for ablation (such as 
treatment of atrial fibrillation), manual compression is the most widely used method to achieve 
hemostasis after the sheath removal. However, manual compression is known to have frequent 
vessel complications and require more time for hemostasis and mobilization compared to 
vascular closure devices. 
 
In these procedures, manual compression (MC) is the standard of care, and figure of 8 (Fo8) 
suturing technique is also used. Each sheath size of these procedures (4-15F) is smaller than 
the 24F sheath size used during the MitraClip procedure. 
 
Abbott is aware that the current Instructions for Use contains the warning: "do not use the 
ProGlide SMC if there are multiple punctures since such punctures may result in a hematoma or 
retroperitoneal bleed". However, this warning is intended for multiple vessel punctures in a 
    
Study Name: [CONTACT_150763]-Access DUS Trial  
Clinical Investigation Plan  
 
 
 
                 
      t

single access site, not for multiple access sites in a single vein. Abbott believes vessel closure 
in multiple site access can be performed safely. 
 
Abbott proposed to use 3 Abbott-funded real-world Investigator Sponsored Studies to evaluate 
the safety and effectiveness of the Perclose SMC for closure of multiple site access procedures 
such as cardiac ablation. The FDA accepted Abbott's proposal but also requested prospective 
duplex ultrasound (DUS) "sub-study" in which femoral DUS exams are performed in subjects 
undergoing atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter ablation procedures involving multiple femoral venous 
access sites per leg that are closed with the Perclose SMC to confirm the safety of the Perclose 
SMC in asymptomatic subjects. 
 
 Rationale for Conducting this Clinical Investigation 
 
Femoral DUS is not routinely done in the standard practice of medicine and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_150728]-related complications are visible (such as hematomas) and/or symptomatic. 
However, asymptomatic vascular complications are not always benign or insignificant. 
Therefore, this study will assess access site-related complications, including asymptomatic or 
non-visible, associated with multiple access site closures with the Perclose SMC by [CONTACT_150735] 30 days. 
 
2.0 CLINICAL INVESTIGATION OVERVIEW  
2.1 Clinical Investigation Objective 
 
The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of multiple access site closure in a single 
vein with the Perclose SMC by [CONTACT_150736] 30 days (if vascular 
complications observed at discharge) in asymptomatic or non-visible subjects. 
 
2.2 Devices Used in the Clinical Investigation 
 
 Name [CONTACT_26157](s) Under Investigation 
 
Devices used in this study are the commercially available Perclose ProGlide® Suture-Mediated 
Closure System and the Perclose Prostyle Suture-Mediated Closure and Repair System 
(Perclose SMC). The Perclose SMC is designed to deliver a single monofilament polypropylene 
suture to close femoral vessel access sites following diagnostic or interventional catheterization 
procedures. 
 
Abbott will cover the cost of the study device/s for subjects who participate in the study. The 
study is an investigation using market released devices and device accountability is not required 
for this investigation.

 Description of the Device(s) Under Investigation 
 
The Perclose SMC is market-released. The U.S. indication for use is the percutaneous delivery 
of suture for closing the common femoral artery and vein access site of patients who have 
undergone diagnostic or interventional catheterization procedures. The devices are under 
evaluation in this study for multiple access site closure in a single vein . The closure 
methodology for each access site is the same with the single access site closure. Please refer 
the Instruction for Use for more details.

discharge and at a 30-day follow-up visit (if any access site-related vascular complications 
(either symptomatic/visible or asymptomatic/nonvisible), nerve injury, or infection at discharge, 
by [CONTACT_150737]). All DUS images are assessed by [CONTACT_150738]. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_173828] be obtained prior to the registration. 
 
The ablation procedure and access site closure should be done per the site's standard practice.  
If the pre-close technique is used, the subject is considered to be registered in this study at the 
insertion of the 1st Perclose SMC into the body (in the case that the ablation procedure is not 
performed after pre-close by [CONTACT_150739], then the subject will be de-registered). If only the 
post-close technique is used, the subject is considered to be registered in this study at the 
insertion of the 1st Perclose SMC into the body after the ablation procedure. 
 
3.2 Measures Taken to Avoid and Minimize Bias 
 
The independent DUS core laboratory is used to assess DUS-detected vascular complications 
to avoid inter-site bias.

3.3 Early Termination of the Clinical Investigation 
 
No formal statistical rule for early termination of the trial is defined. However, the Sponsor 
reserves the right to discontinue the study at any stage or reduce the follow-up period with 
suitable written notice to the investigator. Should the clinical investigation be discontinued by [CONTACT_429], the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_150729]/her site, if appropriate, and subjects will be followed per routine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13707]. 
 
A Principal Investigator, IRB, or regulatory authority may also suspend or prematurely terminate 
participation in the clinical investigation at the investigational site(s) for which they are 
responsible. The investigators will follow the requirements specified in the Clinical Trial 
Agreement. 
 
4.0 ENDPOINTS  
4.1 Primary Endpoints and Rationale 
 
The primary endpoint of this study is: 
 
 Vascular complications detected by [CONTACT_150740] 30 days in 
asymptomatic/non-visible complication subjects 
 
In real-world practice, femoral DUS is not routinely done in ablation procedures and only done 
when access site-related complications are visible (such as hematomas) and/or symptomatic. 
Therefore, a scheduled femoral DUS in asymptomatic or non-visible complication subjects will 
support the overall safety of Perclose SMC in multiple access site closures in a single vein. Any 
visible and/or symptomatic access site-related complications will be also be captured but will be 
excluded from the primary endpoint analysis.  
 
The primary endpoint is further categorized as major or minor.  Major complications are defined 
as those which require surgical, interventional, or pre-specified repair and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. All 
other complications are considered to be minor complications. 
 
Vascular access site-related complications include, but are not limited to:

 Subject Recruitment and Screening 
 
Subjects admitted for an ablation procedure must be screened for the clinical study.   
 
Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be informed about 
the clinical study and asked to sign an informed consent. As the study-specific procedure is 
limited to femoral DUS at discharge and at [ADDRESS_173831] management. 
 
 Informed Consent 
 
The Investigator or his/her authorized designee (if applicable) will conduct the Informed Consent 
process, as required by [CONTACT_26137]’s IRB. This process will include a 
verbal discussion with the patient on all aspects of the clinical investigation that are relevant to 
the patient’s decision to participate, such as details of clinical investigation procedures, 
anticipated benefits, and potential risks of clinical investigation participation. Sites must inform 
patients about their right to withdraw from the clinical investigation at any time and for any 
reason without sanction, penalty, or loss of benefits to which the patient is otherwise entitled. 
Withdrawal from the clinical investigation will not jeopardize their future medical care or 
relationship with the investigator.  
 
During the discussion, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorized designee will avoid any 
improper influence on the patient and will respect patient’s legal rights. Financial incentives will 
not be given to patients. Patients may be compensated for time and travel directly related to the 
participation in the clinical investigation. The site shall provide the patient with the Informed 
Consent form (ICF) written in a language that is understandable to the patient and that has been 
approved by [CONTACT_16018]’s IRB. The patient shall have adequate time to review, ask questions, 
and consider participation. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorized designee will make 
efforts to ensure that the patient understands the information provided. If the patient agrees to 
participate, they must sign and date the Informed Consent form, along with the person obtaining 
the consent prior to any clinical investigation-specific procedures. The site will file the signed 
original in the patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26107], and provide a copy to the patient. 
 
Sites should report any failure to obtain informed consent from a patient to the Sponsor within 5 
working days and to the reviewing center’s IRB according to the IRB’s reporting requirements. 
 
If, during the clinical investigation, new information becomes available that can significantly 
affect a subject's future health and medical care, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorized 
designee (if applicable) will provide this information to the subject. If relevant, sites will ask the 
subject to confirm their continuing informed consent in writing.

 Enrollment of Medicare Beneficiaries 
 
This clinical investigation will enroll Medicare beneficiaries and therefore conforms to all 
standards of Medicare coverage requirements. The Risks and Benefits section describes how 
all enrolled subjects, including Medicare beneficiaries, may be affected by [CONTACT_150742]. 
 
A portion of the subjects enrolled in the clinical investigation display characteristics consistent 
with the Medicare population based on age.  The clinical investigation results will be analyzed 
by [CONTACT_654] (< 65 years and > 65 years) and compared to ensure that the outcomes are similar 
between the Medicare and non-Medicare populations. 
 
 Historically Under-Represented Demographic Subgroups 
 
The Sponsor intends to implement FDA's guidance on sex-specific data in medical device 
clinical investigations to ensure adequate representation of women and other traditionally under-
represented demographic subgroups in this clinical investigation.  As noted in the guidance, 
some barriers to participation of women and ethnic minorities in clinical investigations have 
traditionally been: 
 
 Lack of understanding about main obstacles to participation of such subgroups in clinical 
research  
 Inclusion/exclusion criteria potentially not needed to define the clinical investigation 
population may unintentionally exclude specific subgroups  
 Under diagnosis of disease etiologies and pathophysiology leading to under referral of 
demographic subgroups  
 Avoidance of specific subgroups by [CONTACT_150743]  
 Fear of fetal consequences (for female participants)  
 Family responsibilities limiting women's ability to commit time for follow-up requirements 
 
5.[ADDRESS_173837] shall remain in the clinical investigation until completion of the 30-day 
follow-up period; however, a subject's participation in any clinical study is voluntary and the 
subject has the right to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefit. 
 
however, a subject’s participation in any clinical investigation is voluntary and the subject has 
the right to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefit. Conceivable reasons for

 Subject’s follow-up is terminated according to Section 3.3, Suspension or Early Termination 
of the Clinical Investigation. 
 
Sites must notify the Sponsor of the reason(s) for subject discontinuation. Investigators must 
also report this to their respective IRB as defined by [CONTACT_1385]’s procedure(s).  
 
No additional follow-up is required or data recorded from subjects once withdrawn from the 
clinical investigation, except for the status (deceased/alive). 
 
However, if a subject withdraws from the investigation due to problems related to the safety or 
performance of the device under investigation, the investigator shall ask for the subject's 
permission to follow his/her status/condition outside of the clinical investigation. 
 
In case of subject withdrawal of consent, the site should make attempts to schedule the subject 
for a final clinical investigation visit. At this final follow-up visit, the subject will undergo the 
following assessments: 
 
 Review and report adverse events in electronic case report form (eCRF) 
 Review and report protocol and concomitant medications in eCRF 
 Complete subject reported outcomes in eCRF 
 
Lost-to-Follow-up 
 
If the subject misses two consecutive scheduled follow-up time points and the attempts at 
contact[CONTACT_150744], then the subject is considered lost-to-
follow-up. Site personnel shall make all reasonable efforts to locate and communicate with the 
subject (and document these efforts in the source documents), including the following, at each 
contact [CONTACT_7206]: 
 
 A minimum of two telephone calls on different days over the specified follow-up windows to 
contact [CONTACT_150745], including date, time 
and initials of site personnel trying to make contact. 
 If these attempts are unsuccessful, the site should send a letter (certified if applicable) to the 
subject. 
 If a subject misses one or more non-consecutive follow-up contact [CONTACT_150746], it will be 
considered a missed visit. The subject may then return for subsequent visits. If the subject 
misses two consecutive time points and the above-mentioned attempts at communicating 
with the subject are unsuccessful, the subject will be considered lost-to-follow-up. 
 
Note:  Telephone contact [CONTACT_150747], non-clinical investigation cardiologist or 
relative without the presence of the subject or indirect documentation obtained via discharge

If a subject has any access site-related vascular complications (either symptomatic/visible or 
asymptomatic/nonvisible), nerve injury, or infection at discharge, the follow-up must be done by 
a site visit.  For those subjects who had vascular complications detected on femoral DUS at 
discharge, a repeat femoral DUS must be done at the 30-day visit in the leg or legs in which the 
vascular complication(s) was (were) found at discharge. 
 
For a subject who does not have an access site-related vascular complication, nerve injury, or 
infection, 30-day follow-up can be done by [CONTACT_24646]. The investigator or the designee 
should ask whether the subject has any signals of vascular complications. If the subject has a

susceptive signal, he/she is asked to visit the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_150730], and this site visit 
is regarded as the 30-day follow-up. If the telephone contact [CONTACT_150748], it is 
not regarded as the deviation even though the site visit occurs outside of the window. 
 
6.6 Unscheduled Visit  
 
Additional visits, such as unscheduled visits (other than the protocol required visits), may occur 
as clinically warranted. In this case the subject should be managed per the site standard practice.  
 
If a DUS is performed, the data should be reported on the eCRF. In the case no complications 
are observed at unscheduled DUS, 30-day DUS is not required. 
 
If a medication or AE assessment is performed, the data should be reported on the eCRF.  
 
If the unscheduled visit is done prior to the 30-day follow-up (FU) window (< 23 days), 30-day FU 
is still required, via either the site visit (if vascular complications are detected at discharge DUS 
and/or unscheduled DUS) or telephone contact.

     Page [ADDRESS_173845] be recorded as adverse events. In addition to vascular 
complications, serious adverse events (SAE) and device-related adverse events (adverse 
device effect) must be recorded in the CRF. Any Device Deficiency/Device Malfunction must 
also be recorded. Additional reporting criteria are listed under 7.3 Adverse event reporting.  
 
7.1 Definitions 
 
 Adverse Event 
 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or 
untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users, or other 
persons, whether or not related to the medical device under investigation. 
 
Note 1: This definition includes events related to the medical device under investigation 
or the comparator. 
Note 2:  This definition includes events related to the procedures involved. 
Note 3:  For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to 
medical devices under investigation. 
 
 Serious Adverse Event 
 
If the AE meets any of the criteria below, it is regarded as a serious adverse event (SAE).  
 
a) Led to a death, 
b) Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in  
1. a life-threatening illness or injury, or 
2. a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or 
3. in-subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 
4. medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury 
or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function. 
5. chronic disease  
c) Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
 
Note:  A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912]-existing conditions without a serious deterioration in 
health, is not considered to be an SAE. 
 
  Device Deficiency/Device Malfunction 
 
Device deficiency is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device related to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety or performance, such as malfunction, misuse or use error, and 
inadequate labeling. This includes the failure of the device to meet its performance

specifications or otherwise perform as intended. Note: Performance specifications include all 
claims made in the labeling of the device. 
 
A device malfunction is the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or 
otherwise perform as intended when used in accordance with the instructions for use. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_173846] or 
device under investigation caused or contributed to an AE is to be determined by [CONTACT_150749]. Determination should be based on an 
assess temporal relationships, evidence of alternative etiology, medical/biologic plausibility, and 
subject condition (pre-existing condition). 
 
 Unanticipated (Serious Adverse) Device Effect [U(S)ADE] 
 
Unanticipated serious adverse device effect ([LOCATION_003]DE) refers to any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a 
device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to 
the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
 
 
7.3 Adverse Event and Device Deficiency/Device Malfunction Reporting 
 
 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting 
 
In this study, all vascular complications (regardless of the seriousness), all serious adverse 
events, procedure-related adverse events, and adverse device effects related to Perclose SMC 
must be reported. 
 
Safety surveillance and reporting starts when the first Perclose SMC enters the subject's 
vasculature and will continue until a 30-day follow-up visit has been performed, unless the 
subject is deceased, or the subject withdraws from the clinical study. Adverse events will not be 
collected on de-registered subjects (unless specifically required by [CONTACT_150750]). Safety surveillance and reporting will continue until sites perform the last 
follow-up visit, the subject is deceased, the subject concludes participation in the clinical 
investigation, or the subject withdraws from the clinical investigation.  Sites will collect all 
adverse event data, including deaths and device deficiency data (if applicable), throughout the 
period defined above and will report these events to the Sponsor on a CRF. Sites should update 
additional information regarding an adverse event on the appropriate CRF.

from the day the site personnel became aware of the event or as per the 
investigative site's local requirements, if the requirement is more stringent than those outlined above.  
 
The Sponsor will provide an offline form to allow the investigator to report SAEs in the event the 
entry cannot be made in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC). This does not replace the EDC 
reporting system. Sites should still enter all information in the EDC system as soon as feasible. 
 
 
The date the site staff became aware the event met the criteria of an SAE must be recorded in 
the source document.  The Investigator will further report the SAE to the local IRB according to 
the institution's IRB reporting requirements. 
 
Adverse Device Effect (ADE) 
 
An adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical device.  
 
This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for 
use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the 
investigational medical device. 
 
This definition includes any event resulting from the use error or from intentional misuse of the 
investigational medical device. 
 
  Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE) Reporting to Sponsor 
and IRB 
 
The Sponsor requires the Investigator to report any [LOCATION_003]DE to the Sponsor within 3 calendar 
days of the investigator’s knowledge of the event, unless local requirements are more stringent, 
and to the IRB/EC per IRB/EC requirements. 
 
 Device Deficiency/Malfunction Reporting 
 
All device deficiencies/malfunctions for the investigational device must be reported on the 
appropriate eCRF form. Device deficiencies/malfunctions must be reported to the Sponsor no 
later than 3 calendar days from the day the site personnel became aware of the event or as per 
the investigative site's local requirements if the requirement is more stringent than those 
outlined.

15.0 RISK ANALYSIS  
This clinical study is designed to confirm the frequency of asymptomatic/non-visible vascular 
complication possibly related to Perclose SMC by [CONTACT_150760] [ADDRESS_173860] practice of ablation and vessel closure procedures and 
discharge, and the 30-day DUS (if complications are observed at discharge DUS) is the only 
study-specific requirement.

Although "scheduled" femoral DUS is not a routine practice after the catheterization procedure, 
it is used for further confirmation of symptomatic or suspected vascular complications as the 
standard practice. Femoral DUS is a non-invasive modality and no additional risks are 
expected. Therefore, this study is a non-significant risk study.

APPENDIX II: DEFINITIONS 
 
DUS-detected Vascular Complication Definitions 
 
Hematoma  - A collection of blood outside of the blood vessel.  Characterized on 
ultrasound by a hypoechoic region adjacent to the blood vessel with no flow on doppler 
interrogation.  
 
Pseudoaneurysm  - A blood vessel abnormality resembling an aneurysm (localized 
abnormal dilatation of a blood vessel) but consisting of a collection of blood with 
persistent flow outside an artery, contained by [CONTACT_106218] a leaking 
hole through all layers of the arterial wall. The leaking hole is due to injury of (e.g., 
rupture of or trauma to) the arterial wall, and is related to the access site 
 
DVT (Deep Venous Thrombosis)  - Clot in the deep venous system.  The age of 
the clot is categorized as Acute, Age-Indeterminate or Chronic. 
 
Acute:  
Homogenous hypoechoic thrombus. 
Thrombus poorly organized. 
Dilated vein wall (if occluded). 
Edema surrounding vessel wall. 
Age Indeterminate:  
Shares characteristics of acute and chronic thrombus. 
Lightly echogenic thrombus. 
Less organized thrombus. 
Vein wall appearing close to normal in size. 
Partially compressible. 
Chronic:  
Hyperechoic thrombus. 
Thrombus well organized with well-defined borders. 
Thrombus attached to vessel walls. 
Collaterals may be present. 
 
AV (Arterio-Venous) Fistula  - an abnormal narrow connection between an artery and 
vein.  The doppler characteristics include high turbulence within the fistula and 
arterialized/ pulsatile flow in the vein cephalad to the fistula.  The artery may 
demonstrate a low resistive flow cephalad to the fistula tract.  
 
Dissection  - A tear of the vessel wall that allows blood to separate the intima and 
media from the externa.  This appears a hyperechoic line within the vessel.  Doppler

flow within the dissection depends on the extent of the dissection flap. It may range from 
a to-and-fro pattern to complete occlusion of the involved vessel. 
 
A complete perforation on duplex ultrasound  - a visible jet of color doppler traveling 
through the vessel wall resulting in a non-organized anechoic or heterogenous 
collection outside of the vessel that is actively increasing in size.  
 
A complete tear on duplex ultrasound  - a combined dissection/perforation duplex 
appearance with a jet of color doppler traveling through the vessel wall resulting in a 
non-organized anechoic or heterogenous collection outside of the vessel actively 
increasing in size, as well as possible visibility of a linear echogenic structure visible 
within the vessel lumen. 
 
 
Other Access Site Related Complications 
 
Access site-related nerve injury - Dysfunction with a loss of movement or sensation in parts 
of the legs due to damage to the femoral nerve. It may be caused by [CONTACT_150761] (trauma), 
prolonged pressure on the nerve compression, stretching, or entrapment of the nerve. 
 
Infection - The invasion and growth of germs in the body. The germs may be bacteria, viruses, 
yeast, fungi, or other microorganisms. Infections can begin anywhere in the body and may 
spread all through it. An infection can cause fever and other health problems, depending on 
where it occurs in the body. 
 
Pulmonary embolism - A pulmonary embolism (PE) is a sudden blockage in a pulmonary 
artery by a substance that has moved from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream. 
DVT is the main cause of PE. 
 
Venous access site injury including vessel laceration - Access site injury is defined as any 
untoward harm associated with a therapeutic or diagnostic health care intervention. Vessel 
laceration is defined as a tear in tissue caused by a shearing or crushing force. 
 
Venous bleeding, retroperitoneal bleeding - Venous bleeding is defined as a continuous 
blood flow from a vein. Venous bleeding is less severe than arterial bleeding, but it can still be 
life threatening. Retroperitoneal bleeding is defined as bleeding into the retroperitoneal space.

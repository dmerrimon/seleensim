Nicotine Concentration and Forms: Differential Appeal to Smokers versus Non -smokers  
3 
 I. Summary, Background, and Objectives  
A. Summary  
 The tobacco industry frequently manipulates nicotine in cigarettes to promote smoking. 
Similarly, e -cigarette (EC) manufacturers manipulate nicotine dimensions, including concentration and 
form. These manipulations have increased palatability and nicotine delivery, leading to increased appeal 
and addictiveness, particularly among young people. While ECs pose less risks to smokers who 
completely switch from cigarettes to ECs, EC use among young people is alarming. Regulating nicotine can potentially make pro ducts unappealing to young people while still providing smokers with a less 
harmful alternative with sufficient satisfaction. The overall aim of the proposed study is to determine if an EC product standard requiring a minimum level of free -base nicotine (n icotine form) would reduce 
the appeal of ECs for young adults but not older adult smokers who are more accustomed to the harshness of free -base nicotine. A single -visit, double -blind, randomized crossover design will be used, 
where young adult exclusive EC  users with minimal or no history of smoking and older adult smokers 
complete EC puffing sessions and assess outcomes of appeal and sensory experience, using e -liquids 
that differ by [ADDRESS_682251] regu lations that reduce appeal in young people who do not smoke but 
not in adult tobacco users.  
 
B. Background  
E-cigarettes (ECs) provide a less harmful substitute for smokers who completely switch, but they 
pose significant risks to young non -smokers. Evidence is conclusive that completely substituting ECs for 
cigarettes reduces users’ exposure to tobacco -specific toxicants and carcinogens.
1,[ADDRESS_682252] that ECs can benefit smokers but pose potential risks among 
young non -smokers challenges the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate ECs in a way that 
allow ECs to remain as appealing substitutes for current smokers while reducing their ap peal to young 
people. Manipulating nicotine dimensions is potentially an effective regulatory strategy to increase the appeal of ECs to smokers while reducing their appeal to young people. EC manufacturers, for instance, manipulate nicotine to increase palatability and nicotine delivery, maximizing their appeal and 
addictiveness. ECs have evolved from using EC liquids with unprotonated ‘free -base’ nicotine to 
protonated ‘nicotine salts.’  The use of nicotine salts made EC aerosols easier to inhale especiall y for 
nicotine naïve users, allowing the EC industry to significantly increase nicotine concentration.
[ADDRESS_682253] 
appeal and abuse liability. Such studies will help FDA determine how to effectively regulate nicotine to 
benefit public health.    
Nicotine Concentration and Forms: Differential Appeal to Smokers versus Non -smokers  
[ADDRESS_682254] of e- liquids with nicotine varying in freebase (FB) 
levels (5, 25, 45, 65, 85%) and concentrations (20 or 50 mg/mL) on appeal among young adult EC users 
with minimal/no history of smoking (n= 75) and older adult smokers (n= 75), using a single -visit, double -
blind, randomized crossover trial design. The study will determine freebase nicotine fractions that 
minimally appeal to young adult EC users but sufficiently appeal to older adult smokers, across 
ecologically valid nicotine concentrations. The study will test a hypothesis that increasing FB levels (i.e., 
decreasing nicotine salts) will make ECs less appealing to young adult EC users but not for older adult smokers, especially at higher nicotine concentration.  
 
II. Research Methods & Activities  
A. Design Overview  
In the proposed study, a sample of young adult (21 -24 years) exclusive EC users with no or 
minimal history of smoking (n= 75) and older adult (25 -50 years) smokers (n= 75) will complete a single -
visit, double -blinded, within -subject randomized crossover trial. Participants will vape e -liquids 
containing varying freebase (FB) nicotine fractions (5, 25, 45, 65, 85%) at 20 or 50 mg/mL 
concentrations. The FB fractions were sel ected to cover a wide range with the lower end consistent with 
JUUL and disposable pod -based ECs that are popular among youth
[ADDRESS_682255] of five free -base levels of nicotine at two nicotine 
concentration levels and determining the ‘sweet spot’ level of free- base nicotine that can be tolerated 
by [CONTACT_525764] -smokers.  
 
B. Study Procedures  
Participants will be screened initially through an online screener, which will be  linked to our 
study advertisement and administered using REDCap . Eligible participants interested in participating will 
be scheduled for the study visit  via phone or e -mail.  Participants will be instructed that they must 
remain nicotine abstinent for 12 hours before their visit and will receive a reminder the evening before.  
Each participant will make one laboratory visit, which will take up to 3 hours. After obtaining 
their informed consent  at the study visit , eligibility to participate in vapi[INVESTIGATOR_525754]. 
Smoking status will be biochemically confirmed via an exhaled carbon monoxide reading (eCO) of 
≥4ppm and a urine cotinine testing kit, and exclusive EC use status will be confirmed with eCO (< 4ppm) 
and the cotinine test, and cross -validated against self- reports.
16 Older adult smokers’ 12- hour 
abstinence from smoking will be confirmed with eCO (≤10ppm ). A urine pregnancy test will be 
Nicotine Concentration and Forms: Differential Appeal to Smokers versus Non -smokers  
5 
 administered if the participant’s biological sex is female . Urine  sample will be collected and analyzed for 
the level of total NNAL , a metabolite of NNK that is found only in cured tobacco and is present at 
extremely low levels in EC users,16 using validated methods17-20 following study visits. As a semi- bogus 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_525755]21 to improve the truthfulness of self -reports , participants will be told that the urine 
sample will be analyzed at the time of the visit to confirm current smoking in smokers ( ≥0.15 pmol/mL 
urine total NNAL ) and no concurrent use of combustible and smokeless tobacco use among young adult 
exclusive EC users (<0.15  pmol/mL ). Those who do not meet the criteria will be replaced post hoc with 
additional participants . Blood sample will also be collected as a semi- bogus pi[INVESTIGATOR_525756] . Participants will be told that their abstinence will be confirmed at the time 
of visit via blood plasma nicotine analysis (this is a semi- bogus pi[INVESTIGATOR_525757] 3mL venous blood sample will 
not be analyzed in real -time but collected for later analysis and those with baseline plasma nicotine 
levels  >=3ng/mL will be replaced post hoc with another participant).  
Vapi[INVESTIGATOR_525758] s, tobacco use history, and dependence on  ECs and cigarette s. Guided by [CONTACT_464], 
participants will take two puffs of each of the 10 study conditions (5 freebase nicotine fractions x 2 
nicotine concentrations) using the study EC device, followed by a 10 -minute washout period between 
conditions. During the washout period, participants will be instructed to rinse their mouths and spit 
three times with room -temperature water before sampling the next preparation to minimize carryover 
effects. The washout period was deemed sufficient based on an arteria l study showing a return to 
baseline plasma nicotine levels 40 minutes following a 10 -puff vapi[INVESTIGATOR_143523] (hence, 4 min utes  are 
needed for nicotine levels to return to baseline after each puff).[ADDRESS_682256] 1  second  
for each puff, but other puffing parameters (i.e., flow rate, maximum puff duration, puff volume, rate of exhalation) will not be controlled.  
After each condition, participants will complete General Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS)
14 and 
Labeled Hedonic Scale23 to rate the degree of liking or disliking of sensations and the strength of sensory 
attributes of e -liquids including throat hit, smoothness, harshness, sweetness, and bitterness. 
Participants will also rate overall acceptance on a tobacco industry -designed thermometer scale (from 0 
“the very worst” to 100 “the very best”, with 50 indicating “indifferent”).24 Drug Effects/Liking 
Questionnaire,25 the modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire (mCEQ), and the adapted version of 
behavioral intentions for continued use (from 1 “extremely unlikely” to 7 “extremely likely”)26 will also 
be collected to assess subjective responses to ECs (e.g., reward, satisfaction).[ADDRESS_682257] at the OSUCCC’s Center for Tobacco Research, where participants 
will complete a consent form, screening procedures, vapi[INVESTIGATOR_119696], and online questionnaires and 
surveys on a tablet.  
 
C. Recruitment  
1) Number of Participants  
A total of 1 50 participants will be recruited, including young adult e -cigarette (EC) users with 
minimal or no history of smoking (n= 75) and older adult smokers (n= 75).  
 
2) Participant Population  
Participants who meet the following eligibility criteria will be included in the study. Inclusion 
criteria: 1) current exclusive young adult EC user (daily use  of ≥ 1 vapi[INVESTIGATOR_5842], defined as taking around 
15 puffs or vapi[INVESTIGATOR_525759] 10 minutes) for at least the past 3 months (confirmed by [CONTACT_525765]) 
between 21 -24 years old with no/minimal history of smoking cigarettes (<10 cigarettes in entire life), or 
Nicotine Concentration and Forms: Differential Appeal to Smokers versus Non -smokers  
6 
 current older adult smoker (daily use, ≥100 cigarettes in entire life) aged 25 -50 years  not currently 
engaged in smoking cessation activities; 2) willing to abstain from all nicotine product  and marijuana  use 
for at least  12 hours before the study visit; and 3) read and speak English. Exclusion criteria: 1) currently 
attempting to quit nicotine or tobacco products; 2) currently pregnant (will be verified with urine 
pregnancy test), planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding; 3) use of nicotine products other than ECs or cigarettes  (use of ≥  10 traditional cigars, cigarillos, or filtered cigars in entire life; use of smokeless 
tobacco products ≥  10 times in entire life; or hookah in the last 30 days) ; 4) self -reported diagnosis of 
lung disease including asthma, cystic fibrosis, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and 5) self -
reported new or unstable cardiovascular disease diagnosed within the past 12 months. Upon completion of the study, we will provide participants with information on free tobacco d ependence 
treatment through the Ohio Tobacco Quitline.  
3) Participant Identification  
Participants will be recruited from the general community via targeted internet and social media 
advertisements as well as flyers and word- of-mouth advertising in the Columbus metropolitan area. 
Recruitment will be conducted in collaboration with the OSUCCC Social Media team, our marketing partner  (Eclectic), and the OSU Registrar Office. Eclectic is a full- service marketing firm that will provide 
advertising copy development, strategy (e.g., targeting variables, rotation plans), and management of 
ads throu gh various platforms. Advertisements will be spread across various online and social media 
outlets.  Additionally,  the OSU registrar’s office will provid e us with a  list of students enrolled  at the main 
campus  who  are [ADDRESS_682258] 5 years, our team has 
worked with Eclectic to coordinate the recruitment of other studies of similar design as the proposed 
with outstanding success.  
4) Incentives to Participate  
Participants will receive $125 for the prolonged lab visit (~3 hours). Payments will be made in 
person using the Greenphire ClinCard to increase accountability and facilitate ease of payment. We will also facilitate study visits by [CONTACT_525766], maintaining multiple avenues 
of contact (call, text, email, and mail), and multiple methods to reduce participant burden (e.g., reducing the length of visits, rideshare, etc.). The cost of rideshare will be provided to participants who l ive within 
20 miles of OSUCCC CTR , except for those who take other forms of transportation.  
 
D. Measurement  
1) Self-report measures  
Participants will complete questionnaires on sociodemographic s, tobacco use history, and EC and 
cigarette dependence upon enrollment. Sociodemographic measures will assess participant age, sex 
(male/female), marital status, ethnicity, employment status, years of education, and annual household 
income. Tobacco use his tory will assess years of tobacco use, age of first use, tobacco type, brand, 
frequency, quantity, and duration of using all nicotine products including cigars, cigarillos, little cigars, pi[INVESTIGATOR_5836] t obacco, chewing tobacco, snuff, snus, EC/vape/mod/APV/e -hookah, and hookah tobacco. 
Cigarette Dependence will be measured with the 10 -item Penn State Cigarette Dependence Index
28 and 
the 12 -item Cigarette Dependence Scale.29 EC Dependence will be measured with both a modified 12 -
item EC Dependence Scale and the Penn State EC Dependence Index.29,30 
After taking two puffs of each of the 10 study conditions (5 freebase nicotine fractions x 2 
nicotine concentrations), participants will complete the General Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS)14 and 
Labeled Hedonic Scale23 to rate the liking or disliking of sensation and the strength of sensory attributes 
Nicotine Concentration and Forms: Differential Appeal to Smokers versus Non -smokers  
7 
 (throat hit, smoothness, harshness, sweetness, bitterness), and a tobacco industry -designed 
thermometer rating scale of overall acceptance (from 0 “the very worst” to 100 “the very best”, with 50 
indicating “indifferent”).24 Participants will also complete the Drug Effects/Liking Questionnaire which 
will assess the desire and liking of study products, positive and negative effects, and perceived strength 
and effectiveness.25 The modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire (mCEQ)27 and behavioral intention 
to continued use26 will also assess subjective responses to ECs (e.g., reward, satisfaction).  
2) E-cigarette Device and E -liquids  
Study EC Device: JUUL will be used as EC device by [CONTACT_525767], a refillable 
pod-based device.  
Study E -liquids:  As there are no known commercial e -liquids that match the requirements for 
the proposed study, we will prepare the [ADDRESS_682259] 
liquids will be prepared using USP -grade nicotine, benzoic acid, glycerol,  and propylene glycol, and 
flavored with tobacco flavoring. We will submit an ITP application to the US FDA to receive approval for the e- liquids. The study team has successfully completed ITP applications for other tobacco products, 
includ ing the production of e -liquids (e.g., U01 DA045537; U01 DA045530; R01 CA209961; R01 
CA229306).  
 
E. Data Analysis  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Demographic and 
other participant characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_525768]. Continuous variables will be 
presented as mean ± standard deviation and compared with t -tests while categorical variables will be 
presented as counts and proportions and compared with chi -squared tests. We will apply 
transformations to normalize  the distribution and stabilize the variance of the residuals where 
appropriate.  
The primary goal of the study is to identify a nicotine fraction limit that is appealing to smokers with 
a minimal appeal to young adult EC users. Generalized linear mixed models will be employed for 
measures of appeal (e.g., industry thermometer rating and sensory appeal metrics). Models will include 
demographic and smoking history as covariables, random effects for subject, main effects for user  group 
(smokers vs. EC use), FB fraction (numeric), and concentration (categorical), and interaction effects between smoking group and each of the condition parameter variables (i.e., FB fraction and 
concentration). A significant interaction between smoking group and a condition parameter variable would indicate that the variable differentially affects appeal betwee n the two user  groups. Because of 
multiple measurements tested, we will assume a significance threshold of p=0.01. Conservatively, considering 120 participants, a correlation of 0.5, and alpha=0.01, a two -sided paired t -test achieves 
80% power to detect an  effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_682260]. For FB fraction, with 120 subjects, the model achieves 80% power to detect a 
slope of 0.31, considering alpha=0.01. We estimate the power for the categorical interactions by 
[CONTACT_525769] (with two 2 -level variables there are a total of 4 
groups) and adjust the p -value to account for the 6 possible pairwise comparisons (0.01/6=0.0017=p). 
With [ADDRESS_682261] achieves over 80% power to detect a 1.7 -fold 
difference between any of the two groups in the interaction term, considering alpha=0.0017 and coefficient of variation=0.5. For interactions with FB fraction, group sizes of 60 achieve 80% power to detect a difference in slopes of 0.43, considering alpha=0.01. Interactions between condition parameter variables will also be explored. Since our goal is to find combinations of the condition parameter that are appealing to smokers but not young adu lt EC users, we will compare condition combinations directly to 
identify the condition parameter combinations that result in the largest difference in appeal between 
Nicotine Concentration and Forms: Differential Appeal to Smokers versus Non -smokers  
8 
 the two user  groups. Carryover effects will be explored by [CONTACT_525770] a given condition 
with the preceding treatment and period effects tested by [CONTACT_525771].  
 
III. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
A. Informed Consent Process  
Informed consent (including a description of the nature, purpose, risks, and benefits of the study) 
will take place through both oral and written explanation of the study. A legally valid signature [CONTACT_304230]. The voluntary nature of the s tudy and the participant’s right to withdraw at any 
time will be stressed during the consent process; a copy of the informed consent will be provided to the participant in written form at the time of consent for them to keep via e -mail. Informed consent wi ll be 
collected  in person  by [CONTACT_1744] -approved study personnel. The Ohio State University Institutional Review 
Board will approve recruitment scripts and materials, consent forms, and all study procedures.  All participants will provide written consent before any study data are collect ed. 
B. Privacy of Participants  
To ensure privacy study visits will take place in a secure laboratory setting at the Center for 
Tobacco Research where access is limited to study personnel. Researchers will work with only one 
participant at a time to protect the privacy of participants. Given that participants may find questions 
about EC use intrusive, they will be informed about the nature of questions in advance.  
C. Confidentiality of Data  
Study subjects’ confidentiality will be always maintained. Participants will be assigned a unique 
study identification number (study ID). All study data will be identified by [CONTACT_74218]. Tablets will be supplied by [CONTACT_525772] c data. Electronic data (e.g., questionnaire data and 
laboratory data) will be obtained directly from participants. The electronic data will be entered, stored, and secured through REDCap and managed by [CONTACT_304211], which will only be accessible to authorized study personnel who have the necessary password(s). All computer systems will be password protected against intrusion; all network -based inter -site communications of confidential information will 
be encrypted. Access to computer -stored inform ation will require simultaneous knowledge of the data 
format, computer language, file name [CONTACT_304231]. Participant information will be accessible only to research staff, who are pledged to confidentiality and complete training in the ethical conduct of research (i.e., both HIPAA and CITI trainings). Physical materials will be stored in a locked file cabinet, locked office or suite at the Center for Tobacco Research, [ADDRESS_682262] of nicotine dimensions (e.g., freebase nicotine fractions) on product appeal and vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007] b ehaviors. Such knowledge will inform future 
regulatory actions such as requiring a minimal level of freebase nicotine fractions, which may offer 
health benefits to young adult exclusive EC users and older adult smokers.   
B. Potential Risks  
As the research protocol calls for current EC users and adult smokers to use a study e -cigarette, 
the participants are already smoking or using ECs and will only be asked to use what will be a fully 
characterized EC device and e -liquids for which an FDA IT P will be submitted and “approved” (i.e., 
Nicotine Concentration and Forms: Differential Appeal to Smokers versus Non -smokers  
9 
 receive an FDA letter of “no concern”).  The risk of side effects and adverse events following using ECs 
are very low.  These products are sold online, and at EC specialty stores and convenience stores nationwide, without a prescription. Lab studies of tox in exposure suggest that ECs incur no greater risk 
to health than conventional cigarettes. Indeed, ECs generally show lower levels of harmful and 
potentially harmful constituents. To date, EC studies discussing adverse events report mild and tolerable 
side effects, such as mouth/throat irritation, cough, and headache, that generally resolved completely 
over time with continued use. In previous randomized clinical trials, no serious adverse events were 
reported and the EC group and the nicotine patch group h ad comparable levels of adverse events in two 
studies, with the most common being mouth irritation, throat irritation, dry cough and headache. 
Questionnaires, urine , and exhaled breath procedures are all non -invasive and involve minimal risk to 
study parti cipants. The risks involved in drawing blood from a vein may include, but are not limited to, 
momentary discomfort at the site of the blood draw, possible bruising, redness, and swelling around the site, bleeding at the site, feeling of dizziness or lighth eadedness when the blood is drawn, nausea, and 
rarely, an infection at the site of the blood draw.  
 
C. Protections Against Risk  
All participants will be screened for general medical precautions (pregnancy, cardiovascular disease) and monitored for adverse events during the study period. Any serious adverse events will be reported to the study’s PI [INVESTIGATOR_525760]. Participants who have a serious adverse event 
or have a cardiovascular or pulmonary event during the study will be withdrawn from the study. Blood 
will be drawn by [CONTACT_7628]/research nurse. IVs will be placed by [CONTACT_412032]. Sterile 
instruments will be used, and for blood draws, the participant’s skin will be cleaned with an alcohol wipe 
at the site of the needle stick. Following the completion of the study, we will encourage all participants 
to quit their use of ECs and they will be provided the number to the Ohio Tobacco Quit Line (1 -900-784-
8669).  
 
D. Assessment of Risks & Benefits  
In general, this study will provide a benefit to future EC users and smokers as the findings will be 
reported to public health officials and the FDA to inform policy, for encouraging smoking cessation, 
identifying abuse liability effects, and reducing toxicity (if any). All participants will be encouraged to 
quit smoking and/or using ECs at the completion of the study. Adequate protections are in place in the event of unlikely and mild risks to study participation. Research results will not be returned to participants. Overall, it is expected that the potential benefits to participants in the proposed study 
outweigh the potential risks.

Page 4 of 42 01/26/[ADDRESS_581796] Summary/Abstract  
Due to the age associated sarcopenia and reduced cardiovascular fitness, f rail older 
adults experience  significant decrease  in physical function which comprises of mobility, 
endurance, muscle strength and balance  control [1,2,3]. The impaired physical function 
results in poor quality of life and reduced community participation, leading to increase d 
frailty and long-term disabilit y [8]. Further, compared to cognitively intact frail older 
adults, cognitively impaired frail older adults experience greater deterioration of such 
physical function , specifically during dual -task performances (i.e., simultaneous 
performance of cognitive and motor task).  This deterioration occurs due to increased 
cognitive -motor interference as a result of dual -tasking and is known to increase 
exhaustion among frail older adults [7].  Previous studies have used multicomponent 
trainin g and have shown to improve physical function and maintain cardiovascular 
functioning [4,5,6 ]. However, the capacity of such interventions to improve cognitive 
function along with physical function is not known or unclear.  Further, the concurrent 
comorbid ities that occur  along with psychosocial issues such as depression present as 
barriers and lead to reduced compliance to therapy leaving only a few of them to benefit 
from it  [40,41] .  Alternate forms of therapy  such as exergaming  with explicit cognitive 
training has shown promising effects  in improving motor and motor function in disabled 
populations  [38,39] .  These studies use a cost -effective, off the shelf device such as 
Nintendo Wii or Microsoft Kinect  to deliver the training which is easily available and 
clinically translatable .  Further, such training has demonstrated increase in brain 
connectivity enhancing cognitive functions associated with balance control [10].  
However, there is limited literature examining the effect of exergaming in older frail  
population and the efficacy of such training is unknown . Therefore, this study proposes 
a randomized controlled trial to examine the feasibility of CogXergaming program with 
an aim to improve locomotor -balance control, cognition, muscular system and 
cardi ovascular fitness.

Page 5 of 42 01/26/21 2.0 Background/Scientific Rationale  
The population of adults aged 60 years and older has been growing  with around half  of 
the people older than 85 years estimated to be frail [14,15 ]. Age-related changes in 
multiple systems affecti ng balance, mobility, muscle strength, motor processing, 
cognition, nutrition, endurance and physical activity  (PA) results in frailty [3]. Studies on 
frail older adults have reported improvement in mobility and functional level following 
exercise interven tions [16]. Regular physical activity in this population has helped 
improve cardiovascular conditioning and quality of life, thus allowing these frail older 
adults a chance at independent living in the community [17,18,19,20,21 ]. In addition to 
physical co morbidities, the presence of psychosocial issues such as depression may 
act as a barrier to community participation. Several PA interventions have demonstrated 
limited long -term effect and sustainable behavioral change in this population [22,23 ]. An 
eviden ce-based fall prevention program called Matter of Balance (MOB) was developed 
to reduce fall risk and improve physical function and maximize activit y participation in 
older adults [11,12,13]. Meanwhile, Exergaming, a task -specific interactive gaming, has 
been gaining attention as a novel therapeutic alternative that promotes motor recovery 
in healthy and disabled populations [24,25,26 ]. Exergaming involves repetitive -task 
specific exercises with movement execution fe edback and motivation provided in real 
time [22,24,25,26]. Studies have shown  Exergaming  improved symmetrical weight 
shifting, multi -directional steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], single -stance, rapid movement training and self -
initiated postural weight shifts in the participants [27,28 ]. This anticipatory postural 
contr ol training helps significant ly improve  balance control and mobility 
[8,24,26,27,28,29 ,30]. In addition to the physical function domains that underlie physical 
frailty, executive cognitive domain functions also predict late -life physiological 
impairments [ 31]. Thus, we postul ate that PA facilitated through Exergaming and 
accompanied by [CONTACT_455003] a novel approach to counter and 
inhibit frailty associated with physical function and cognitive decline.   
 
3.0 Objectives/Aims  
 
Aim 1:  To test  the feasibility (compliance and effectiveness) of cognitive -motor 
exergaming (CogXer gaming) in the frail older adults and to compare the  improvements 
in behavioral biomarkers in this group across balance, muscle fitness, cardiovascular 
fitness and global cognition to the group receiving the Matter of Balance training .  
Hypothesis:  Participants will respond well to  CogXergaming training paradigm and 
demonstrate significa nt improvements in balance, muscular fitness , cardiovascular  
fitness and global cognitio n as compared to the Matter of Balance training group .

[CogX to reduce fall s in f rail elderly ] Version 7 
Page 6 of 42 01/26/21 Aim 2:   To examine the effect of CogXergaming on physical activity levels and quality of 
life measures post -intervention.  
Hypothesis:  The participants who received CogXergaming  will demonstrate signif icant 
improvement in physical activity and quality of life post-training as compared to their  
own pre -training scores.  
Aim 3:   To examine the effec t of CogXergaming structural and functional connectivity 
within the cognitive -motor areas pre and post traini ng to establish effect size.  
Hypothesis : Post-training, participants will demonstrate improved memory 
consolidation, attention, motor planning and execution compared to pre-training  
indicating improved functional connectivity within the cognitive -motor ar eas.

5.[ADDRESS_581797]  Enrollment  
 
A total of 120 participants will be enrolled in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (see Research Design and 
Procedures for details).  
We will initially recruit the participants by [CONTACT_455004] (approved by [CONTACT_455005]) at Geriatric and internal medicine  by [CONTACT_55175]. Tanjeev Kaur , giving 
presentations to potential participants at various exercise centers and seni or homes.  
We will also use social media, suc h as Facebook, Twitter, etc. to post flyer for 
recruitmen t.  As a part of recruitment procedure, we will n ot be accessing the EMRs, 
and will get referrals fro m different phy sicians for those who are potentially eligible to 
participate in our study. Our research staff team will travel to various locations to 
provide the background education about our study and explain the procedures through 
the study involved an d will show the m the consent form.  The consent form  will provide 
enough information about the study and the interested people will be asked to provide 
their contact [CONTACT_3031], which  will be noted down on a sheet .  Later, one of the 
researchers mentioned  on the Appendi x P will contact  [CONTACT_272433] a telephone screening.  
Individuals making the initial contact [CONTACT_455006]/read about the study.  
The initial telephon e screening wou ld determine their general health condition, 
preliminary eligibility .  They will be asked to choose a group that they prefer to 
partici pate which includes 3 options - 1) Group 1: In-person a ssessments and in -
person traini ng (where  all the tes ts and trainin g sessions will be conducted in the 
labor atory ); 2) Grou p 2: In-person assessments and online training  (where only 
the tests before and after  training will be con ducted in the labor atory and  they

assessments and online training  (where all the te sts and training will be 
conducted online via zoom application).   Those  who choose to be in Group 1  or 
Group  2, they will be screened for claustrophobia using t he claustrop hobia 
questionnaire (Napp, A. E.  et al 2016)  and individuals who score an average of 1.2 or 
less will be given the option of being included for fMRI study participation . Once he/she 
meets t he inclusion criteria, t hey would be scheduled for an in-person lab oratory 
screening at Room 415, B56 or 725 of the College of Applied Health Sciences building. 
The laboratory s creening involves evaluating the individual’s  performance on various 
clinical m easures balance, muscle strength, endurance and cognit ion. The part icipants 
will also undergo osteoporosis screening using an ultrasound device to measure their 
heel bone densit y. During the bone density testing, their hee l will be squeezed  by [CONTACT_455007] m embranes of the testing apparatus. As a result, they w ill experienc e some 
pressure, and/or mild tingling, cold or warm sensation on the heel from the membranes  
or the gel used d uring the testing.   While Group [ADDRESS_581798] 
measure s followed by [CONTACT_455008].   
 
All participants’ information will be recorded in a database in the form of an excel sheet 
that will include the information of the participants eligible and those not eligible for 
study. For p articipants not eligible for the s tudy, the  reason for withdrawal or exclusion 
from the study partici pation as per the telephonic interview will be recorded. An excel 
file woul d be maintained to document the results of participants’ initial telephone 
scree ning, osteoporosis screening, clin ical asse ssment and laboratory dynamic stab ility 
test.  
 
To minimiz e coercion and undue influence on the participants, the potential participa nts 
will directly call research coordinators in response to a flyer and/or other  recruiting 
materials  or by [CONTACT_72683] o f mouth.  In case of interested participants referred by [CONTACT_455009], the researcher will collect the contact  
[CONTACT_455010] a telephonic screening.   Participation is 
voluntary and individu als' deci sions will not be influenced  by [CONTACT_455011] - or post -training assessments .

Basic Step is a challenging game w hich wi ll be replace d by [CONTACT_39780] 2 games ace d for 
2 consecutive sessions. Each game will be superimposed with any 3 of the 6 cognitive 
tasks (word list generati on consist ing of verbal fluency (VF)  and catego ry fluency ( CF), 
digit recall (DR), analogies (AN), m ental arithme tic (MA), repeated  letter ( RL). In the VF 
and CF task, Participant s will be asked to recite as many words as  they can, from a 
given cat egory or  an alphab et (e.g., participants wil l be asked to say as ma ny names of 
“animals”, “fruits” or  words from a given alphabet letter, s uch as “S ”). In the digit recall 
task, the participant will require to repeat the digits t he researc h personnel told (e.g., 
please repe at the digits 153, and the  participan t is expecte d recite the 3 digits). 
Participan ts will  be asked to respond to analogi es asked,  e.g., “ Bird is to fly, and fish is 
to ____ ”. In the mental arithmetic task, the participan t will be asked t o mental ly calcula te 
and provide an answer t o the m ath equation giv en, e.g., 4+2=?  the participant is  
expect ed to reply “6”. In the repeate d letter task, the participant is simply asked to 
repeat only a specific letter and not re peat all the letter, e.g., please r epeat the letter “A” 
only when you h ear me say “A” and igno re all the others, the personnel w ill sta rt saying 
a series of letter - B N O A, a nd the participant is expected to respond “A”. The cognitive 
tasks will be random ized makin g sure that all t he cogni tive tasks  are played with all the 
games. The c ognitive and  balance board game scores will be  noted on the scorin g 
sheet for each s ession. T he cognitive and physical demand will be assessed after each 
game in the sub -session across  the 12 sessions via NASA  TLX [32 ]. The NASA TLX 
scores will be collecte d on an iPad/iPhone  using the NASA TLX applica tion an d the 
data wi ll be exported in the form of .csv file. Participants will be asked to rate their level 
of exertion on the B org scale after each sub -session to  determine  the fatigue level of the 
training [3 3]. Blood pr essure (BP) and heart rate (HR) wi ll also  be monitored  prior to and 
after each su b-session. A total [ADDRESS_581805] intervals will be used to obtain HR and blood pressure for safety 
monito ring. The projected total t ime spen t on inter vention is estimated to be  60 minutes  
(10 minutes  warm -up + 30 minutes Exergaming +  20 min utes break). A physical

85% of the age predicted maximum heart rate to continue t esting and tr aining. All 
participants will be provided  with a feasibility questionnaire and their compliance  will be 
recorded at the end of the 4 w eeks o f training. Participants a re provided with a set of 
balance exercises, which are demonstra ted via anima ted avatars. The balance 
exercises includes non -interactive balance games (steppi[INVESTIGATOR_454980], backw ard, 
sidew ays), Tai-Chi, Weight shifting (to righ t leg,  left leg an d practice dis tributing equal 
weights  on both the legs), Ae robic (steppi[INVESTIGATOR_454981]), dance , strength, a nd stretching.

Each game will be superimpose d with any  3 of the 6 cognitive tasks (word list 
genera tion co nsisting of verbal fluency (VF) and catego ry fluency (CF), digit  recall (DR), 
analo gies (AN), me ntal arithmet ic (MA), repeated letter (RL). In the V F and CF task, 
subjects will be asked to recit e as many word s as they can, from a given categor y or a n 
alpha bet (e.g., particip ants will be asked to s ay as many names of “a nimals”, “fruits” o r 
words from a given alpha bet letter, such as “S”).  In the digit  recall task, the participant 
will require to repeat the  digits the research personnel  told (e.g., pl ease rep eat the di gits 
153, and the  participant i s expected recite the 3 digi ts). Particip ants will be asked to 
respond t o analogies asked, e.g., “Bird is to fly  and fish is to ….”.  In the  mental 
arithmetic tas k, the participant will be asked to mentally calculat e and  provide an 
answer to the math equat ion given, e.g., 4+2=?, the participant i s expected to  reply 6.  
In the repeated letter task, the participant is  simply asked to repeat only  a specific letter 
and not repeat all the letter, e.g., please repe at the letter “A” only whe n you hea r me say 
“A” a nd ignore all the others, th e personnel w ill start say ing a series of le tters- B N O A, 
and the participant is e xpected to respond “A”. The cognitive tasks will b e randomized 
making sure that all the cogniti ve tasks  are playe d with a ll the ga mes.  The cogn itive 
and physical demand wi ll be assesse d after each game via NASA TLX (20,21).  The 
NASA TLX is a numerical 20  point -scale and participant s will respond to the cogn itive 
and physical demand questions accor dingly.   Participants will  be asked  to rate their  
level of exertion on the Bo rg CR10 scale  to determine  the fatigue level  of the training 
(22,23).  In case of an y fatigue noticed or the par ticipant demands a bre ak, they will be 
asked to sit back in a chair  and the y will be asked to  monitor their vitals a nd report to 
the remote research personne l to ensure s afety.  All partic ipants compliance will be 
calculated across th e training  sessions

in-person  training) and Online version for Group 2 (in-person ass essments  and 
online training) , Group 3(online a ssessm ents and online training) ] 
 
Participants will unde rgo matter of balance training for  8 weeks (one sessi on a week for 
2 hours/day) .  The prog ram emph asize s practical copi[INVESTIGATOR_454982] s, mutu al problem so lving, exercises t o impr ove strength, coordination and 
balance, and a home safety evaluation. The program wi ll be offered by g raduate and 
post-doc resear ch asso ciate s in the  UIC Physical Therapy Departm ent who will be 
certified A Ma tter of Bal ance ( AMOB ) coaches. The detail s of the exercise intervention 
are provided in the m anual attached.  Similar intervention f or AMOB traini ng will be 
provided online for participants in  Grou p 2 and Group 3.  All the onli ne training  sessions 
will be c arried out  on 1-on-1 basis.   
 
6.3 Safe ty  
 
Safety during  in-person procedures: Participa nts will be wearing  a safety harness 
system dur ing the laboratory pre - and post -tests perfor med on m otorized e quipment  
such as the Balance Ma ster and treadmill. F or clinical tests, p articipants w ill be sec ured 
with a gait belt and will be allowed to use th eir assistive devic e (if using one) with close 
moni toring by [CONTACT_455017]. Du ring the  training sessions , the par ticipants 
will also wear a gait bel t, and external assi stance (conta ct guard s upport) will be given 
for safety.  
Safety during onl ine procedures: Participants will be provided w ith a heart -rate, oxygen 
saturation and  physic al activity  monito r which will be ma iled to them afte r telephone 
screening.  To further ensure  safety , 2 additional steps  will b e followed  prior to 
participation in the study :  
1) If the partici pant’s resting O2 saturations is < 90%  and heart rate is >85% of  age 
predicted maximal heart rate , they will be excluded  or given the option of obtaining 
physician cons ent to be included  in the study .  The health coach will monitor 
participant’s res ting he art rate and O2 saturation at the beginning of every 
testing/train ing session and at regular intervals during the training.  
2) We will remotely administer [ADDRESS_581808]  (shortened version of [ADDRESS_581809]) 
during the online assessment session for Gro up 3 (online assessment and online 
training). In this test, participant s will march in spot  or around the room (with health 
coach able to see them on the screen)  in front o f the health coach for 2  minutes with 
the pulse oximeter on. On completion , the heal th coach will obtain the heart rate and 
oxygen saturation .  If the HR e xceeds 85% of age appropriate HR max and O2 
saturation falls below 90% then they will be exclude d from the study.   
For the tes ting procedure  as wel l as the training proce dure research p ersonnel  will 
engage wit h one participant only. During every zoom meet ing, particip ants will not 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
[CogX to reduce fall s in f rail elderly ] Version 7 
Page 16 of 42 01/26/21 proceed with any further testin g or intervent ion if HR exceeds 85% of HR max, or an 
increase in HR > [ADDRESS_581810] will be stopped if 
the remote research personnel  observes any of the following sig ns occur duri ng 
testing indicating cardiovascular intolera nce: marked dyspnea, pallo r, volitional 
fatigue, and imbalance during training.  Further more, subjects will be asked to a lert 
the remote research personnel  and the helper budd y if they experience an y 
discomfort such  as tightness in the chest, excessive swe ating, pain in chest, ligh t 
headedness or d izzine ss, heada che, and nausea.  The test will be stopped if any of 
the above symptom s is reported by [CONTACT_455018]. 
Particip ants will als o be required to place a sturdy chair approve d by [CONTACT_455019] p ersonnel  in front  of them for sup port, if needed throughout the training 
sessi on. The helper bu ddy must be present to assist or provide physical suppor t if 
needed  during th e procedures.    
 
We will use an application called “Zoom” for our online screening an  intervention. 
This zoom application will be HIPAA compliant version of ‘Zoom’ for all  the sessions.  
This service includes access and authentication measure, all communications are 
safegua rded with end -to-end AES-256-bit encryption, and the platform integrates with 
the Epi c electronic health record network to support healthcare workflows. 
Additionally, Z oom has “conduit exception” which means the application does not 
have access to personal  health information ( PHI). ‘Zoom’ does not have access to 
identifiable PHI and protec ts and encrypt all audio, video, and screen sharing data .  
Participan ts will only use t he link pr ovided by  [CONTACT_147849] , which would 
have: https://zo om.us/ follo wed by a long string of numbers, letters  both capi[INVESTIGATOR_454983] -case. For every t estin g/training session, we will be pro viding a new li nk to  
the participants  to maintain security with only the research personnel  having the 
rights to admit. No per sonal health information will be asked or reco rded during these 
meetings.

Aim 1: B alanc e and Gait tests :  
Balance: 
For In-Person Assessment (Group 1 and 2) 
Intentio nal b alance control   
Intentional postural sway will be examined via the Limits of Stabili ty test protocol (Single 
task – ST) on t he Balance Ma ster (Natio nal Instruments etc.)  and will also be ex amined 
while co ncurr ently performing an oral trail  making task , i.e. letter -number seq uencing 
(dual -task condition, dual - DT) and /or Auditory Clock T est. The Equitest is a special 
equipment  consisting o f metal fra me embedding forcepla tes w ith a surroundi ng visual 
display. P articipants will be in a harne ss for their safety in case they get  unsteady during 
any of the conditions inducing a sensory conflic t. This will take about [ADDRESS_581811] 
quantitativel y asse sses t he pa rticipant’s ability  to use visual, proprioceptive and 
vestibular inputs for maintain ing their posture in quiet standing.  Th e test will b e 
administe red under single and dual-task (simultane ous performance  of m otor and 
cognitiv e tasks) cond itions.  The  test will take approxim ately [ADDRESS_581812] under single 
and dual -task conditions (simult aneous  performance of l etter numb er sequencing task 
or audi tory c lock task). The partic ipant  will be prepared w ith [ADDRESS_581813] d on several  joints on the body (kne e joint, ankle joint , wrist, 
shoulder, hip, sacrum,  neck). The p articipant will be in a harness and instr ucted to sta nd 
shoulder  width apart on the Ac tive Step Treadmill  making sure bo th his feet are on the  
treadmill bel t. The harne ss pr ovides support maki ng sure the participants knee do not 
land on the treadmill surfa ce and avoid injury. A [ADDRESS_581814] starts  and will be instructed to resp ond naturall y when an

[CogX to reduce fall s in f rail elderly ] Version 7 
Page 19 of 42 01/26/[ADDRESS_581815] involves maintainin g stance position 
without losing balance at five different posit ions (eyes open on a solid surface, eyes 
closed on a solid surfa ce, eyes open on a foa m sur face, eyes clo sed on a foam s urfac e, 
eyes open in t andem stance p osition on a  solid surface). The iPod will be clipped on the 
gait belt which will be buckled around the participants ’ waist. This test will t ake [ADDRESS_581816], the participant 
will be ask ed to walk up and down  the 60 feet walkwa y for two minut es. T he total 
distance  covered will be recorded in a chart provided by t he application on the iPad. 
 
For Online Assessment (Group 3)  
Balance will be determined with the followin g tests:  
1) 30-second chair stand test .  This test is conducted t o 
assess leg st rengt h and endurance. Participants w ill be asked  
to stand in front of a sturdy chair and monitored by [CONTACT_455020] g the test. The participants will be 
instructed to sit in the middl e of the chair. Pl ace t heir hands on 
the op posite shoulder  crossed, at the wrist s. Keep their feet 
flat o n the floor and bac k straight with arms against their 
chest. Then the f ollowing inst ruction “On “Go,” rise to a full 
standin g position, then s it back d own again. 6. Repe at this for 30 seconds” i s provided 
to conduc t the test and as sessed b y the resear ch pe rsonnel  remotely.  This test is easy 
to perform and require s a sturdy chair (availab le at every home) and will be performed 
in front of the camera d uring the zoom meetin g for  the research personnel  to monit or 
and collect the required data.

Page 20 of 42 01/26/21 2) To test the d ynamic balance and to assess the person’s abili ty to step over objects 
forward, side ways, and backwards, a Four -step square test will be used.  The 
participants will be instructed to stand in square 1 facin g square 2 (see fig below).  The 
participants  are instructed to step as fast as possible 
into eac h square in the following sequence: 
2,3,4,1,4,3,2, and [ADDRESS_581817], an d sideways to the right and left. 
Participants will be provided with t he fo llowing 
instruction ““Try to complete the sequenc e as fast as 
possible withou t touching the sticks. Both feet must  
contact [CONTACT_455021]. If po ssible, face 
forward  during  the entire sequen ce.” The research 
personnel  will instruct a nd moni tor the participants  remot ely and not e the time the 
participants took to  complete four -step square test.  This requires a  removable tape to 
be pasted on the floo r (which will be mailed in  case they  do not h ave a  tape at home).  
The test is easy to b e performed by [CONTACT_455022].   
3) To assess the static  balance of participants in sensory inte gration taxing condition, they 
will be assess ed on  Sharpened Romberg  (27,28). Participan ts will be show n on the 
screen the positions  they need to stand  in and will be assessed by [CONTACT_455023] .  Furth er the participants will also be assesse d on One-legged Stance test  
to assess stat ic postu ral and balance control (27,29).  Participan ts will be instructe d the 
followi ng” Stand on one leg, pl ace your arms across your chest with your hands 
touching your sho ulders and do not let your legs touch ea ch other. Look straight ahe ad 
with your ey es open and focus on an object about 3 feet in front  of you. Ideall y do this 
with the  shoes off.” Remote research personnel  will assess the performance of the 
participant.  T his test does not require any equipment and is safe to administer 
remotely.    
 
All these tests will be performed on single and dual task co nditions.  Unde r dual-task 
condi tions , conc urrently  performed with an oral trail making task, i.e., letter -number 
sequencing (dual -task condition, dual - DT) and/or Auditory Clock tes t. The participant s 
will be asked to place a sturdy chair in front of the m for their safety in case they get 
unstead y during  any of the above tests.  
 
Gait function  
For In -person Assessment  (Groups 1 and 2)  
Subjects will be asked  to walk on the GAITRite, a n electronic mat ( CIR Systems, Inc ., 
Sparta, NJ, [LOCATION_003]). It consists of se nsors embedded into 12 × 2 feet m at which m easures 
spatial and temporal gait parameters via the accompanying GaitRite  software (GaitRite 
Gold, Version 3.2). Dual-task performance will also be performed while walking.

Performance Oriented Mobility Assessmen t will be evaluated remotely to assess g ait 
problems in older adult s (30,31). A safe area visible to the research personnel  remotely 
will be chos en and only then the test will be adm inistered .  During this test, the research 
personnel  will ensure that he/s he is constantly visible in the screen a nd measure the 
time taken t o complete the tes t 
 
Muscular Fi tness  
For In -Person Assessment (Groups  1 and 2)  
Participants will  be tes ted for low er extre mity muscle strength and muscle size using  
isokinetic dynamometer . The Peak muscle torque/power generated  by [CONTACT_455024] l area will be examined.  
Muscle cross -sectional area: For  this, the p articipant w ill be  asked  to stand in a 
comfortable relaxed position.  The midpoint of thigh  will be ma rked for measuring the 
muscle thickness  of quadriceps femoris.  B -mode Ultrasonograph y via Sonosite M 
Turbo  machine will be u sed to measure th is muscle thickness  with a [ADDRESS_581818] on the marked surfaces without compressin g the skin surface .  Then, 
the transducer head will be pos itioned perpendic ular to the longitudinal  axis of the 
quad riceps f or which the machine will provide with ultrasound images and elec tric 
calipers will be used for noting th e muscle thickness.   
Cardio vascular exercise tolerance  
For In -Person Assessment (Groups 1 and 2)  
Participants’ Heart rate variability will be t ested du ring all laboratory measures using the 
Polar ProTrainer [ADDRESS_581819] : Prior to testing, the participan ts will be  asked 
to notify the research personnel if they experience any discomfort such as nausea, 
dizziness during testing .  The participants will pedal on the cycle e rgometer for  1 minute 
as a warm -up without resistance at a rate of 50  revolutions  per m inute (rpm) . The 
participant will continue to pedal  at 50 rpm with increased resista nce ([ADDRESS_581820] 
workload) . We will r ecord the heart rate at [ADDRESS_581821] the heart rate at 4  minutes. Based on the 
steady -state hear t rate (HR) reached, we wil l increase the wor kload for the second 
stage or workloads beyond the fourth  stage and/o r increase t he intensity by 2 5 watts 
(0.5 Kp) until the termination heart rate is reached (85% of age predicted max). The 
participant will coo l down after the last stage  has been complete d.

2-minute step in pla ce test: The participant  is as ked to stan d up str aight next  to the 
wall while a mark is placed on the wall at the level corresponding to midway between 
the kneecap and top of the hi p bone. The subjec t then marches in place for two 
minutes, lifting the knee s to the hei ght of the m ark on  the wall. Resting is allowed  and 
holding onto the wall or a stable chair is allowed . Stop after two minutes of steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
The remote research personnel  records the total  numb er of times the right knee 
reaches the tape level in two m inutes. 
 
Cognitive Funct ion 
For In -Person  Assessments (Group s 1 and 2)  
1) Neuropsychological battery of tests : This will be adminis tered using DirectRT  software 
[34] which has be en validated and i s a r eliable tool to determine cognitive function ing. 
The parti cipant will be prov ided with a pair of he adphones with an attached microphone 
for his responses to be audio recorded. A keyboard  and mouse will be p rovided for use 
during the games as required.  1) Visual Stroop test is a demonstration of inte rference in 
the reaction time of a tas k. In this test, the participant will be asked to read the ink color 
in which the wo rd is printed and no t read the word. 2) Category Fluency Task: This  task 
assesses sem antic  fluency and requires the participant to rec ite as many wo rds he can 
pertaine d to the category hear d, e.g., animals, boys’ names, and fruits in one minute. 3) 
Verbal Fluency Task: In thi s test, the particip ant will be asked to recite  as many words 
as possi ble from the letter cue heard, e.g., “A”. 4)  Reaction time  task: The particip ant 
will be asked to h it a number on the keypad corresponding to the position of the yell ow 
dot on the screen . 5) Paired Associat ed Learning: In this task, the participant is  
instructed to observe numbers with their positio ns on the grid  which will appear for only 
a few seconds , and when the cue, i.e., a specific number from the grid is given,  the 
participant is expected to respond to the position the number was on the grid he  
obse rved. 6) Spatial Working Memory: The partici pant is asked to use the mouse to  
click on the red boxe s to find a star. He will be instructed to avoid clicking on the bo xes 
he already found  the star in and fin d the stars in all the boxe s for the game to progr ess. 
The game consists of 3 levels and the l evel progresse s with the level of  difficulty. The 
game will not progress if he does not complete that level given. 7) Audi tory stroop task: 
The participant will h ear words “High” and “Low” at high or low pit ches.  His/her task is to 
respond to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_454984] n ot repeat the word.  The responses will be  audio 
recorded.  
2) NIH cognitive toolbox [35,36,37 ] measures will be used to determine th e change in     
the cognitive function. It is a  standardized test  widely used which is highly reliable and 
valid t o use among th e mild cognitively impai red older adults administered via the iPad 
using the NIH Toolbox application. All th e responses will be recorded by [CONTACT_455025] 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
[CogX to reduce fall s in f rail elderly ] Version 7 
Page 23 of 42 01/26/21 scores will be generat ed accordingly whi ch ca n then be exported via excel sheet. 1) 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_454985]: This tes t eva luates the epi[INVESTIGATOR_454986]. The participant recalls a series of pi [INVESTIGATOR_454987] a particul ar manner described 
before. For example, the pa rticipant is shown  pi[INVESTIGATOR_454988]. A 
series of pi [INVESTIGATOR_454989] o n building a te nt to fishing. For the  test, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_454990],  and the participant is expected to  place those pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] s in the same order 
described. The number of ad jacent pairs of pi [INVESTIGATOR_1103] s placed correctly will score a point. 
The s cores are appl ication generated. 2) Flanker inhibitory control and attention test: In 
this test, the individual is instruc ted to click on the arrow on the keyboar d that matches 
the directio n of the middle ar row i n the stimulus given on the screen. Accuracy  of the 
respon ses are recorded, a nd th e scores are appl ication generated. 3) List Sorting 
Memory test: The test is divided  into two subsets to  evaluate working me mory. The 
participant will be shown a pi[INVESTIGATOR_454991]. For the first subset, the task for t he 
participant  is to name [CONTACT_455040] e to the largest size. The second 
subset involves a category of foo d along with pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] s of animals. The ta sk of the 
participant is to  say the food firs t and  then name [CONTACT_455041] s ize. The accuracy o f the  participants’ re sponse will be recorded by [CONTACT_229638]. 4) Dimensional Change c ard sort: This test involves three subse ts 
assessing executive func tioning. For the f irst subset, the participant is expected to 
choos e the same sha pe of the stimulus provi ded, for example,  if the stimulus given is a 
boat, and for the answers from which th e participant is sup posed to choose is g iven as 
rabbit and boat, he  is expected to cl ick on the boat. In the second subset, the partic ipant 
is expec ted to click on the  object that matches t he color of the stimulus and avoid 
clicking  on the same shape. The last subset involves  playing the first a nd the second 
subset togeth er in a randomized  order generated by [CONTACT_99023]. 5) Pattern 
comparison Proc essing speed test: This test involves the  participant to hit the yes or no 
button depending on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_454992]. Similarit y of shapes of 
objects, col ors are provided a s stimulus. This test evaluates the processing sp eed of 
cogniti ve functioning. 
 
3) Auditory Clock test: The  participant will hear times of day. His/her task is responding  
yes if both the hour an d minute hands are o n the same side of the cloc k face and 
respond  no if the hands are not on the same side o f the clock fa ce. The responses w ill 
be audio recorded.  
 
4) Letter  number sequencing:

into two subs ets to evaluate working memory. The participant wil l be shown a pi[INVESTIGATOR_454994].   For the first su bset, the task for the participant is t o name [CONTACT_455042]. The seco nd subset involves  a category of food a long 
with pi[INVESTIGATOR_454995]. The task of  the participant is  to say the f ood first and then 
name [CONTACT_455043] f rom smallest size to the largest size. The accuracy of the 
participant’s respon se will be audio recorded.  Dimensional Chang e car d sort- This 
test involves  three subsets assessing executi ve functioning. For  the first su bset, the 
participan t is expected to say the same shape of the stimulus prov ided, for example, if 
the stimulus given  is a boat, and for the ans wers from which th e par ticipant is 
supp osed  to ch oose is given as rabbit and boat , he is expec ted to  say “boat”. In the 
second subset , the participant  is expected to say the object that mat ches the color of 
the stimulus and avoid  naming the shape.   The las t subset involves playing the first and  
the secon d subset together.  Pattern compa rison Process ing sp eed t est- This test 
involves the participant to sa y the yes or no depending on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_454996]. The si milarity of shapes of objec ts, colors are pro vided  as stimulus.   This 
test e valuates the processing speed of  cognitive function ing.

7.0 Expected Risks/ Benefits  
 
Potent ial Risks: Pertaining In-Person asses sment and trai ning 
Reactive bal ance control:  During the stance perturbation test, there is a slight ri sk of 
falls and i njury (e.g., a musc le pull at shoulder or leg, muscle at the back).  
 
Train ing sessi ons: As the tra ining se ssions involve high intensi ty training, the initial 
sessions may cause some muscle soreness in the lower limbs which may cause some 
discom fort d uring  the first week of training, which will then be settled once the training 
sessions p rogress.  
 
MRI scanning : The p articipants may experi ence di scomfort  as they are in an enclosed 
place with a loud noise generated during the MRI procedure. The pa rticip ants will be 
given ear p lugs to eliminate the MRI generated noise.  
All particip ants will  be monitored t hroughou t the M RI sc anning procedure through a 
camer a while he/she is  in the MRI scanner. They will be instructed that if any kind of 
discom fort is expe rienc ed to let us know i mmediately.  
 
Preventing falls during the stance perturba tion test  (SPT) and limi ts of st ability  test 
(LOS): For both intentional and  reactive balance  control experiments, all the participants 
would be asked  to wear a ful l-body  prote cted harness to prevent any part of the body 
other than the feet contact[CONTACT_455028] (SPT)/for ce platform (LO S). T he harness 
has ad justable should er and leg straps and will be attached to an overhead metal arch 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
[CogX to reduce fall s in f rail elderly ] Version 7 
Page 27 of 42 01/26/21 that will allow the par ticipants to  perform movements freel y having neither the knees nor 
hands from touching the treadmill belt/force p latform . Dur ing the threat t o balance 
control in stance  posit ion d uring t he re active balance control experiment, the safety 
harness will hold t he participa nt an d prevent him/her f rom falling. During the past 
several years, in more tha n [ADDRESS_581826] 
area (>1500 cm2), primarily in regions  that are ab le to w ithstand larger force s without 
injury ( i.e. the pelvis  and buttock s). S houlder suspension of the harness provides 
protection against bot h forward an d bac kward falls, with n egligible risk of straps 
entanglement. Finally, the ext ent of bod y descent be fore ha rness  assistance begi ns is 
limited ([ADDRESS_581827] rage),  very carefu lly calibrated and controlled. Our calculations 
indicate that, during a wors t-case  fall into the harness, an individual who weighs 1000 N 
would be Participated  to a peak p ressure of < 0.3 MP a, we ll below the str ess threshold 
for even a mo derate  musc le cont usion  (1.9 MPa), requiring no medical treatment.  
 
Preventing falls dur ing training  sessions:  There is also  a risk of balance loss and falls 
while participating i n the actu al balance t raining  on the Wii-Fit balan ce board. For that 
reason, partic ipant s will always be made to wear gait belt  and supervised by a research 
personne l ment ioned in Ap pendix P during the  training sessions. Blood pressure and 
heart rate will be monitor ed prior to the tra ining  session, after each sub -session 
(completio n of 4  game s). Par ticipants will be given a chair to sit back after each sub -
session (co mpletion of 4 gam es - approximately 10 minutes considering each game 
played for 1.5 minutes ) or if he /she feels tired du ring the game (i.e., ≥ 15 on Borg scale 
for perceived exertion) or  if the blood pressure is beyond normal limits (i.e. > 85% of 
age-predicted maxima l hea rt rate). More than or equal to [ADDRESS_581828], or 
fatigue. The research personnel will  observe for an y cha nges in particip ant’s facial 
expression indicating anxiety or  discomfort. In case of any discomfort, the session will 
be terminated, and the ti me of  the training session will be noted.

precautiona ry features, evolved through a decade of rese arch, against such injuries. To 
further reduce the risk of injury, all Participant s will undergo a series of stretching and 
warm -up exercises at the start of the  experiment an d training. A p hysic al therapi[INVESTIGATOR_454997]. Stretches will encompass 
all major muscle groups of the  lower  limbs and trunk. Warm -ups include activities such 
as walking, lunges, squats, high steppi[INVESTIGATOR_454998].  
 
 
Potential Risks: Pertaining Online assessment and training  
 Clinical test related risks  
1. The clinical ba lance tests performed pre -and po st-interven tion would present with 
a mild risk of losing balance while performing the activities. S ubject would be  remo tely 
monitored b y the research personnel  and also asked to pl ace a sturdy chair in front of 
them while performi ng these assessments.  
2. The wal king tests ([ADDRESS_581829] some questi ons 
about perso nal health info rmation  and daily physical activity habits an d the subjects 
may be some discomfort while answer ing those questions.  
5.  During asse ssment and training sessions of Group 2 and 3, we will ask the "helper 
buddy" to note what the participant may be feeling. Incase of events like shortness of  
breath, exc essive sweating, fatigue or muscle crams - the session will be stopped and 
the part icipant will be discontinued from the study

8.0 Data Collection and Management P rocedur es 
 
The overall goals of dat a management are to ensure: 1) that the collected data i s 
properly documented and accurately ent ered; 2) the confidentiality of the participa nt 
data is  maintained giv ing a ccess to the p rimary investigators for retrieving data an d 
exporting to statistical p ackages. A codebook will be created consisting of P rior to data 
collection and entry, a codebook will be created which will contain the variab le names,  
descriptions, and v alue codes of e ach variable/item collected during t he stud y. 
Following development of the codebook, a database will be created in Micros oft Ex cel 
to facilitate data entry. The progra m permits logic checks on input and checks fo r invalid  
entries. One r esear ch staff member  will enter all data separately, and  anothe r 
researcher will verify the  data entry to identify any mismatching data value s, var iable 
names, or observation numbers thus , to eliminate data entry errors. Several dat a quality  
checks will al so be  conducted, inc luding descriptive statistics and gr aphic p lots to detect 
outliers and influential observations. All computer data will b e stor ed in a password -
protected network serve r with back -up scheduled every midnight. The original raw data 
will b e sto red in a locked  cabinet accessed only by [CONTACT_455030] t perso nnel. The motion 
analysis da ta would be backed up on a portable hard drive and  store d in a locked 
cabinet accessed only by k ey project personnel.  
  
Each laboratory sessi on will b e recorded with  a video camera syst em for further 
analysis of body resp onses. The 3D motion cameras will d etect small ball -shaped 
markers that is placed on differ ent parts of the body, including the fee t, ankles, knees, 
hips, shoulders, elbows, an d wrists to represent bo dy mo vement. Each se ssion will also 
be recorded on a vid eotape using a camcorder. Only the investigators related to this 
project will have ac cess t o these files. The videotape or its repr oduction may be used 
for research purposes su ch as pub lication in sci entific journals or presentations at 
educational or scie ntific meetings and teaching purpos es in the future. All the videos are 
taken from th e side  and back, where no facial feature will be identifiable. Thus,  the 
participant would not be re cognizable by a  stranger without ot her identification from the 
record. ID code s will be at a single office  and in a locked file. They will be destroyed 
along with  the videotape of the experiment [ADDRESS_581831] the access key, and there are  no duplicate keys.  
For Group 1 and 2: All th e details desc ribed above will  be used for d ata collection and 
storage.

Protections against  Study Risk. We bel ieve that there is a m inimal risk of injury to the 
participants in this study. These risks include a slight risk of muscle sore ness 
associated with i ncreased phys ical activity or stretching during training sessions, an d a 
leg or shoulder m uscle pull, and l eg or back sprain due to expose to unexpected s lip-
perturbation during the testing session. There may also be the risk of anxie ty due to the 
slip tes t. In case of  any injury, participants will be encouraged to (a) cons ult their 
primary hea lth care provider  before initiating any  new physical activity; a nd (b) p erform 
physical activities at a pace that is comfortable for them and in  a way that is consist ent 
with any recommendations from their medical providers. Other risk s include the

Group 3 ( online -assessments an d online-training i nformed consent process will 
occur remotely ( online)  using REDCap . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_143168] s an account through which 
participants will be  provid e their Informed consent via e-sign.  This process will 
be explained via ‘Zoom meeti ng’ to walk them thro ugh every process.   
 
 
13.2 Participant  Confidentiality  
Participants’ conf identiality would  be maintained as all the identifying information wi ll be 
de-identified using an alpha -numeric code at the time of enrollment and the Participa nt 
specific uni que c ode w ill be  used for  all the data collection purposes. All stud y records 
will be kept confide ntial by [CONTACT_2329] a numerical code. A participant will not be identified 
personally in any  report of the results. We will keep the identif ying inf ormation at a 
centra lized single locatio n which will be locked,  and it will be dest royed after t he 
completion of the entire project. Only those who are active member s of th e research 
team will have ac cess to the raw data. This research doesn’t invo lve the use and 
disclos ure o f protected  health i nformation.  
13.3 Unanticipated Problems  
 
Any unanticipat ed problems will be reported to the IRB by [CONTACT_17258] a “Prompt Repor t” 
form.

Title of Study:  
A Phase [ADDRESS_215028] an Inadequate Response to 
Antidepressant Therapy (the FORWARD-2 Study) 
Investigators: 
This will be a multicenter, multinational study.  
Study Period:  
First subject consented: Q2  [ADDRESS_215029] completed: 2017  Phase of development:  
3 
Objective:  
• To assess the long -term safety and tolerability of ALKS 5461 for use as an adjunctive therapy 
to antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD)  
Methodology: ALKS  [ADDRESS_215030] consisting of BUP and samidorphan in a 
1:1 (weight/weight) ratio. Throughout this protocol ALKS 5461 dose levels will be referred to as dose 
of BUP/samidorphan expressed as weight in mg (eg, a 2 mg BUP:2 mg samidorphan dose will be 
expressed as ALKS  5461 2/2). 
This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability, and explore the treatment effect of ALKS  [ADDRESS_215031] had 1 to  2 inadequate responses to an approved antidepressant therapy (ADT).  
Subjects will have been treated with an adequate dose of an approved ADT for at least [ADDRESS_215032] 4 weeks prior to study entry. An adequat e dose is defined as a dose that is 
greater than or equal to the minimum effective dose on the [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_181994] (ATRQ), inclusive of up to 3 weeks for titration 
into the adequate dose range. 
Subjects will enter into the study in one of the following 3 ways, based on their previous experience 
with ALKS  5461: 
1. 
New Subjects:
2.  those who have not been randomized in a prior study of ALKS 5461 within 
2 years  
Continuing Subjects:
3.  those who have completed the treatment period of study ALK5461-205, 
ALK5461-206, ALK5461-207, or ALK5461-[ADDRESS_215033] 10 days  
Lead -in Subjects:  those who participated in study  ALK5461-205, ALK5461-206, or 
ALK5461-[ADDRESS_215034] 10 days, and met the criteria for respo nse to ADT during the 
prospective lead -in (PLI) period of that antecedent study, but did not meet the criteria for

(Amendment #3)  ALK5461-208 
Page 4 remission  
All New Subjects will be initially evaluated for eligibility at screening (Visit 1), to occur up to [ADDRESS_215035] a separate screening visit and 
will begin participation in this study at Visit 2.  
At Visit 2, all eligible, consenting subjects will begin the treatment period. Subjects who are not 
receiving ALKS 5461 at s tudy entry will require a 1-week titration period. Subjects entering the study 
already receiving ALKS  5461 will not require a titration period. To maintain the blinded dosing 
scheme in ALK5461-206 and ALK5461-207, Continuing Subjects from those studies will be blinded to 
whether or not they receive a 1- week titration.  
Starting on Day 8 (Visit  3), the target dose for the remaining 51  weeks for all participating subjects will 
be ALKS  5461 2/2. Attempts should be made to achieve and maintain the ALKS 5461 2/2 dose 
throughout that period, if it is tolerated. However, flexible down- titration to ALKS  5461 1/1 or 0.5/0.5 
is permitted at the investigator’s discretion, if tolerability issues persist. Once a subject has stabilized after down -titration, attempts should  again be made to achieve and maintain the target dose of 
ALKS  5461 2/[ADDRESS_215036]’s experience with 
study drug tolerability. 
Dose adjustment of ADT during the treatment period is permitted for optimal therapeutic effect within 
the recommended dose range, however ADT dose adjustment should not be made within the same 
week as ALKS 5461 dose adjustment. Furthermore, subjects are not permitted to change ADTs during 
the course of the study period. 
During the 52- week treatment period, subjects will return to the clinic for periodic scheduled visits 
(Visits 2 -14) at which safety, tolerability, and treatment effect over time will be assessed.  
A 4-week safety follow -up period will occur following the ALKS 5461 treatment period. During the 
4-week follow-up period, there are a total of 4 clinic visits (Visits 15- 18), as well as 7 safety 
assessments by [CONTACT_648]. The clinic visits will occur 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks following the 
end of treatment visit (Vis it 14). The phone assessments will occur daily for the first week between 
visits, and weekly during the second and third week.  
If any adverse events (AEs) are reported that relate to opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351] (eg, nausea, vomiting, 
restlessness, hyperhidrosis) dur ing a phone assessment in the follow-up period, the subject will be 
asked to come into the clinic as soon as possible to receive a Clinical Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2433] 
(COWS) assessment.  
Number of Subjects (planned):  
It is estimated that approximately 1, 500 subjects will be enrolled in this study.  
Main Criteria for Inclusion:  
The main criteria for study eligibility are as follows:  
• New Subjects must have a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, 
Text Revision (DSM -IV-TR) MDD diagn osis and an inadequate response to current 
approved ADT. They will not have participated in a prior trial of ALKS 5461 within 2 years. 
• Continuing Subjects must have completed the treatment period of ALK5461-205, 
ALK5461-206, ALK5461-207, or ALK5461-210 within 10 days of the baseline visit for this 
study. 
• Lead -in Subjects must have completed  the PLI period of ALK5461-205, ALK5461-206, or 
ALK5461-207 within 10 days of the baseline visit for this study and met the criteria for response to ADT during the PLI, but not for remission.

(Amendment #3)  ALK5461-208 
Page 5 Study Drug, Dosage, Duration, and Mode of Administration: 
ALKS  5461 consists of buprenorphine (BUP), a [LOCATION_002] Drug Enforcement Administration 
(US DEA) Schedule III narcotic, and samidorphan, a US DEA Schedule II controlled substance.  
The following doses will be used in the study: 
• ALKS  5461  0.5/0.5 (0.5 mg BUP:0.5 mg samidorphan) 
• ALKS  5461  1/1 (1 mg BUP:1 mg samidorphan) 
• ALKS  5461  2/2 (2 mg BUP:2 mg samidorphan) 
Tablets will be administered sublingually, daily for up to 52 weeks.  
Reference Therapy, Dosage, Duration and Mode of Administration: This safety study has no reference therapy.  
Study and Treatment Duration:  
For New Subjects, the study duration will be up to 60 weeks, which includes up to 4 weeks for the 
screening p eriod, 52 weeks for the dosing period, and 4 weeks for the follow-up period. 
For Continuing Subjects and Lead-in Subjects, the study duration will be up to 56 weeks, which includes 52 weeks for the dosing period, and 4 weeks for the follow-up period. 
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety and Tolerability: 
The following assessments will be collected to evaluate safety and tolerability throughout the study:  
• AEs 
• clinical laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis)  
• vital signs  
• body weight 
• electrocardiogram (ECG) 
• Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
• COWS  
Efficacy:  The following assessments will be made for exploratory evaluation of treatment effect over 
time:  
• Montgomery- Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS)  
• Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM -A) 
• Clinical Global Impression – Severity (CGI -S) 
Pharmacokinetics:  
Plasma samples will be collected at specified time points from consenting subjects enrolled in the U S 
only. These samples will be used  to quantify concentrations of BUP, samidorphan, and relevant 
metabolites. Concentrations of background ADTs that subjects report taking during the study may be 
quantified, as appropriate.  
Statistical Methods:  
Safety: Safety and tolerability analyses will be performed using data from the safety population, 
defined as all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of ALKS 5461. Reported AE terms will be coded 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA® ) preferred terms and system organ 
class categories.  
Safety assessments will  be summarized using descriptive statistics along with supportive listings.  
Revised Clinical Study Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc.  
(Amendment #3)  ALK5461-208 
Page 6 Efficacy: Exploratory evaluation of treatment effect over time will be performed using data from the 
full analysis set (FAS), defined as all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_215037] -baseline efficacy assessment (MADRS).  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Plasma concentration data for BUP, samidorphan, and relevant metabolites as well as background 
ADT s will be listed and summarized . Additionally, concentration data obtained from this study may be 
combined with data from other studies for population PK analysis , which will be reported separately.  
Sample Size Considerations:  
It is estimated that approximately 1, 500 subjects will be enrolled in order to ensure that a minimum of 
100 subjects achieve 12 months of exposure to ALKS 5461 and a minimum of 300 subjects achieve 
6 months of exposure.

Page 14 5. INTRODUCTION 
Alkermes is developi[INVESTIGATOR_182000] 5461, a fixed-dose combination tablet consisting of 
buprenorphine (BUP) and samidorphan  in a 1:1 (weight/weight) ratio for once-daily sublingual 
administration for use as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).  
MDD is a serious, and in some cases life -threatening, condition. Current therapy is limited and 
insufficient. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or serotonin-norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] (SNRI) are recommended as first -line therapy; however, the large majority of patients 
do not experience an adequate response  [Rush, 2006]. For patients with MDD who have an 
inadequate response to approved first- line antidepressant therapy (ADT) the only currently 
approved agents for adjunctive treatment are atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709]. However, this class of medicines is associated with serious toxicity, including tardive dyskinesia, which may be 
irreversible, as well as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and agranulocytosis, both of which are 
potentially fatal. These conditions and other side effects of the atypi[INVESTIGATOR_182001] [ Spi[INVESTIGATOR_182002], 2013]. 
The development of an adjunctive treatment that avoids the toxicity associated with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_182003]. ALKS [ADDRESS_215045] 8 published studies of BUP in depressed patients [ Spi[INVESTIGATOR_182002], 2013 ]. These studies 
demonstrated striking antidepressant effects with BUP treatment, particularly in patients with 
MDD who have had multiple prior inadequate responses to therapy. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_182004], the risk of diversion, abuse, and dependence have precluded routine clinical use of BUP, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_182005], in the treatment of depression. 
ALKS 5461 is a fixed-dose combination of BUP (a μ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_182006]) and 
samidorphan (a μ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2634]). Samidorphan is a new chemical entity optimized for high potency and high sublingual (SL) bioavailability to facilitate co- formulation with BUP 
for SL administration. ALKS [ADDRESS_215046] the subjective, rewarding and addictive 
properties of BUP and thus address the risk of abuse and dependence. 
Subjects treated with ALKS 5461 in Phase 1 and the Phase 2 studies showed substantial and 
clinically important improvements in depressive symptoms compared with those treated with 
placebo. Safety and tolerability data from these studies showed that ALKS 5461 was safe and 
generally well tolerated, and furth er no evidence has been found that ALKS 5461 is associated 
with motor disorders or metabolic dysregulation, the important toxicities associated with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_91874]. All together these findings indicate that ALKS 5461 has the potential to address 
an unmet medical need in this serious and in some cases life-threatening, condition. 
Full summaries of nonclinical and clinical results available to date on the pharmacokinetics (PK), 
safety, and efficacy of ALKS  5461, as well as of samidorphan and buprenorphine as individual 
and co -administered therapeutic agents are summarized in the Investigator’s Brochure  (IB).

Page 15 5.1. Study Rationale  
Subjects with MDD and an inadequate response to concomitant ADT who were treated with 
ALKS 5461 in both a Phase 1 study (ALK33BUP-201) and a Phase 2 study (ALK5461-202) 
showed substantial and clinically important improvements in depressive symptoms compared 
with those who received placebo. Safety and tolerability data from these studies showed that ALKS [ADDRESS_215047] over time.  
5.2. Dose Selection  
Note: Throughout this protocol ALKS 5461 dose levels will be referred to as dose of BUP/samidorphan expressed as weight in mg (eg, a 2 mg BUP:2 mg samidorphan dose will be 
expressed as ALKS 5461 2/2). 
Doses for the current study were identified based on completed studies of ALKS 5461 including 
a drug -drug interaction study of BUP with samidorphan (ALK33-008), and a Phase 2 
(ALK5461-202) study in adults with MDD and inadequate response to concomitant ADT. 
Study ALK33-008, the drug-drug interaction study, showed that a 1:1 ratio of BUP and 
samidorphan in doses up to 8/[ADDRESS_215048] effects of BUP. Thus doses in the current study, which use a 1:1 ratio, are expected to 
mitigate BUP’s subjective, rewarding, and addictive effects.  
Study  ALK5461-202 was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
sequential -parallel -comparison -design clinical trial which evaluated ALKS 5461 at doses of 2/2 
and 8/8. The ALKS 5461 2/2 dose was shown to be safe, well tolerated, and efficacious. After 4 weeks of dosing, statistically significant improvements from baseline were found for the 
ALKS  5461 2/2 group versus the placebo group for the primary efficacy endpoint (change in the 
17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM -D] total score), as well as several 
secondary endpoints, (change in Montgomery- Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] total 
score and  Clinical Global Impression - Severity [CGI -S] score). Additionally,
 the rate of 
treatment response and the rate of remission as defined by [CONTACT_182090] 5461 2/2 group versus the placebo group. 
The selection of the ALKS 5461 2/2 dose is further supported by [CONTACT_182091] 5461 8/8 dose.

study entry. An adequate dose is defined as the minimum effective dose or higher according to 
the applicable current approved label, inclusive of up to 1 week for titration into the adequate 
dose range.  
Subjects will enter into the study in one of three ways, based on their previous experience with 
ALKS  5461: 
1. New Subjects:
2.  those who have not randomized in a prior study of ALKS 5461 within 
2 years  
Continuing Subjects:
3.  those who have completed the treatment period of study 
ALK5461-205, ALK5461-206, ALK5461-207, or ALK5461-[ADDRESS_215075] 10 days  
Lead -in Subjects:
All New Subjects will be initially evaluated for eligibility at screening (Visit 1), to occur up to [ADDRESS_215076] 10 days, and met the criteria 
for response to ADT during the PLI period of that antecedent study, but did not meet the 
criteria for remission . Criteria for co mpletion of the PLI includes 1) at least [ADDRESS_215077] 5 weeks at the minimally effective dose and 2) completion of Visits 1a through 1f.

Dosing is described in detail in Section  9.1.2. From Week  2 to 52, all participating subjects will 
take ALKS  5461 2/[ADDRESS_215080] dose of ALKS  5461 at Visit 2 (Day 1). From that point on 
during the treatment period, according to the schedule of visits as shown in Table 2, the staff will 
dispense ALKS 5461 for subjects’ self- administration. Subjects will be advised to take the study 
drug at bedtime. 
During the 52-week treatment period, subjects will return to the clinic for periodic scheduled 
visits (Visits 2 -14) at which safety, tolerability, and treatment effect over time will be assessed.  
A 4-week safety follow -up period will occur following the ALKS 5461 treatment period. During 
the 4 -week follow -up period, there are a total of 4 clinic visit s (Visits 15 -18), as well as 7 safety 
assessments by [CONTACT_648]. The clinic visits will occur 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks 
following the end of treatment visit (Visit 14). The phone assessments will occur daily for the 
first week between visits, and week ly during the second and third week. See Table 3 for the 
schedule of assessments during the follow -up period. 
If any AEs are reported that relate to opi [INVESTIGATOR_43351] (eg nausea, vomiting, restlessness, 
hyperhidrosis) during a phone assessment in the follow-up period, the subject will be asked to come into the clinic as soon as possible to receive a Clinical Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2433] (COWS) 
assessment.  
After completing the study, ADT may be continued for up to 3 months, as appropriate, based on 
the investigator’s clinical judgment.

All male and female subjects must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception for the 
duration of the study unless they are surgically sterile or post- menopausal (see below). At a 
minimum subjects must agree to use one of the following. Additional restrictions, if required, 
will be clarified in the locally approved informed consent form (ICF). 
• Double-barrier protection (eg, a condom with spermicide or a diaphragm with spermicide)  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
Revised Clinical Study Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc.  
(Amendment #3) ALK5461-208 
Page 38 • Hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], a vaginal ring, contraceptive patch, 
contraceptive implant; must be initiated and at a stable dose for at least 30 days prior 
to screening; see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Subjects who are abstinent are eligible, provided they agree to use an acceptable contraceptive 
method should they become sexually active.  
Subjects who are surgically sterile are exempt from the requirement to use contraception. 
Women who have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936]-
oophorectomy are considered surgically sterile. Men who have undergon e a vasectomy are 
considered surgically sterile. Partner vasectomy is not considered an approved acceptable 
method of contraception for a female subject. 
Women who are postmenopausal are also exempt from the requirement to use contraception. For 
the purpose of this study, postmenopausal is defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation for at least [ADDRESS_215104] fill out a Pregnancy Report Form and submit the information to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy, 
irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred. The end -of-treatment and safety follow-
up visits will be scheduled. 
The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination and 
notify the outcome to the sponsor. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for 
immediate classification as a SAE, the investigator should follow the procedure of reporting SAEs (See Section  13.2).  
8.4.2. Concomitant and Prohibited Medications  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Concomit ant Medications  
All medications taken by a given subject within 30  days of screening through follow-up will be 
recorded as detailed in Section 8.3.10. The concomitant medication review on each visit will 
include all prescription medications including ADT, OTC medications, and vitamins and dietary supplements. Concomitant medications will be reviewed at all clinic visits and all phone assessments.  
Subjects will be permitted to continue taking concomitant medications during the study provided that these medications are not prohibited (see Sections  7.2 and [IP_ADDRESS]) . The investigator may 
discontinue or adjust the dose of any of these concomitant medications to ensure subject safety. 
At the investigator’s discretion, new concomitant medications may be administered during the 
course of the study for the treatment of an AE or a change in disease state. If a prohibited 
medication is needed, the investigator should notify the medical monitor as soon as possible to 
discuss the continued participation of the subject in the study. 
Dose adjustment of approved ADT during the treatment period is permitted for optimal 
therapeutic effect within the recommended dose range, however ADT dose adjustment should 
not be made within the same week as ALKS 5461 dose adjustment. Further, subjects are not 
permitted to change ADTs during the course of the study period.

The use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_74453] (eg, codeine, oxycodone, tramadol, morphine) or opi[INVESTIGATOR_40500] 
(eg, naloxone, naltrexone) within 14 days before screening through the final follow-up visit is 
prohibited. Use of extended -release opi[INVESTIGATOR_182020] 2 months prior to screening 
through the final follow-up visit is prohibited. 
The initiation or dose adjustment of hormone replacement therapy (including testosterone) or an 
oral contraceptive within [ADDRESS_215105] 30 days prior to screening and the same stable dose is expected to be taken throughout the study. 
Hypnotic agents for insomnia (eg, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], trazodone) are not permitted if 
started within [ADDRESS_215106] 30 days before screening not more than

and will contain a ratio of 1:1 BUP: samidorphan as free base equivalents by [CONTACT_8497]. BUP is a Schedule III  narcotic and samidorphan is a Schedule II controlled substance. Thus, ALKS 5461 
should be treated as a Schedule II controlled substance in the US. Outside the US, ALKS 5461 should be handled according to local regulations. See Section  10 for information on storage and 
handling of controlled substances. 
The study drug formulation contains common pharmaceutical excipi[INVESTIGATOR_182029] “GRAS” (Generally Recognized As Safe [GRAS]) and accepted for use as food additives in 
Europe: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, sucralose, citric acid,

9.1.2. Study Drug Dose and Dosing Regimen 
Dosing begins at Visit 2, with a 1- week titr ation for subjects not already taking ALKS [ADDRESS_215110] not be 
swallowed.  Eating and drinking should be avoided for 15 minutes after dosing. At Visit 2, study 
site personnel will administer the ta blet and visually confirm that the tablet has dissolved 
completely. From Day 2 on, subjects will self- administer the daily SL dose; it is recommended 
that subjects take ALKS  [ADDRESS_215111] until the following visit. Subjects will be instructed to 
bring the bottle or blister pack (as applicable, see Section  10.1) with them to each subsequent 
visit. Subjects will also be instructed to bring in containers of their ADT. Drug adherence will be reviewed with subjects at each visit.  
9.3. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  
Three different groups of subjects will be enrolled in this study, some of whom will require a 
1-week ALKS  5461 titration, as described in Section  8.1. From Day 8 on, all participating 
subjects will receive  ALKS  5461 2/2. 
Revised Clinical Study Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc.  
(Amendment #3) ALK5461-208 
Page 42 9.4. Blinding  
Subjects who are not already taking ALKS 5461 on study entr y will begin treatment with a 
1-week titration period. As explained in Section  8.1 and Table 1, to maintain the blinded dosing 
scheme in antecedent studies ALK5461-206 and ALK5461-207, subjects entering from those 
studies will be blinded to whether or not they will participate in the 1 -week titration. Study 
subjects, investigators, site staff and the sponsor will remain blinded to the treatment assignment 
in all applicable  antecedent studies. 
Beginning on Day 8, all participating subjects will receive open -label ALKS  5461 2/2, as 
tolerability allows.  
9.5. Study Drug Dose Adjustment and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_182030] 8 (Visit 3), attempts should be made to achieve and maintain the target dose of 
ALKS  5461 2/2 over the course of treatment, if tolerated. However, at any time during the study, 
flexible down- titration to ALKS  5461 1/1 and then to ALKS 5461 0.5/0.5 is permitted at the 
investigator’s discretion , if tolerability issues p ersist. Once a subject has stabilized after down-
titration, attempts should again be made to achieve and maintain the target dose of 
ALKS  5461 2/[ADDRESS_215112]’s experience 
with study drug tolerability.  
Dose adjustment of approved ADT during the treatment period is permitted for optimal therapeutic effect within the recommended approved dose range, however ADT dose adjustment should not be made within the same week as ALKS 5461 dose adjustment. Furthermor e, subjects 
are not permitted to change ADTs during the course of the study period.  
The study may be stopped at any time or study sites may be closed at the sponsor’s discretion.

10.1. Packaging and Labeling  
A subset of subjects in North America may receive ALKS 5461 in child- resistant bottles. 
Otherwise, study drug will be packaged in child- resistant blister packs. All packaging will be 
labeled in a manner that meets applicable local and regulatory requirements.  
Dosing for Week 1 will be in accordance with Table 1. During this period subjects will receive 
either child -resistant bottles or child -resistant blister  packs containing 9 tablets to cover the week 
from Visit 2 to Visit 3 (+2 day visit window). During Week 1, titration packaging will be either 
blinded or unblinded dependent on the antecedent study, as outlined in Ta ble 1. 
All subjects will receive open -label child -resistant bottles or open- label child -resistant blister 
packs of ALKS [ADDRESS_215113] be stored in accordance 
with local co ntrolled substance requirements, and in the US, restrictions related to Schedule II 
controlled substances. 
The investigator will take adequate precautions, including storage of the investigational drug in a 
securely locked, substantially constructed cabinet, or other securely locked, substantially 
constructed enclosure, access to which is limited, to prevent theft or diversion of the substance into illegal channels of distribution.  
Complete details on storage condition requirements can be found in the Inves tigator's Brochure . 
10.3. Accountability  
The investigator will be responsible for the oversight of recording the receipt and administration of ALKS 5461, and for insuring the supervision of the storage and allocation of these supplies. 
The investigator is required to maintain current drug dispensing and accountability logs 
throughout the study. The investigator may delegate accountability duties to an appropriate and 
qualified pharmacist or staff member who is under the supervision of the investigator. 
The invest igator or designee must allow the Clinical Research Associate or equivalent to perform 
drug reconciliation during each study monitoring visit. All unused supplies will be checked 
against the study drug movement records before investigational drug is returned or destroyed. 
Subject -level study drug accountability will be documented in the subjects’ source documents 
and eCRFs. If drug cannot be accounted for, a ctions will be taken that are appropriate for a drug

Revised Clinical Study Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc.  
(Amendment #3) ALK5461-208 
Page 47 13. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed on the basis of:  
• treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs)  
• clinical laboratory parameters (ie, hematology, chemistry, and urinaly sis) 
• vital sign measurements (ie, oral body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, 
and pulse) 
• weight  
• ECG findings 
• C-SSRS results  
• COWS  
13.1. Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any unt oward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product. The occurrence, which may or may not have a causal 
relationship with the investigational treatment, may include any clinical or laboratory change that does not commonly occur in that subject and is considered clinically significant.  
Illnesses present prior to the subject signing the informed consent form (ICF) are considered to be pre-existing conditions (which may include AEs from a previous ALKS 5461 study for Continuing Subjects or Lead- in Subjects) and are documented on the medical history eCRF. 
Pre-existing conditions that worsen during the study are entered on the AE eCRF. 
All out-of- range laboratory values will be deemed as clinically significant or not clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_093]. Clinically significant values will be considered AEs and recorded 
as such on the eCRFs. 
Pregnancy is not considered an AE, although a subject will be withdrawn from the study if a 
pregnancy occurs. As described in Section  8.4.1, the pregnancy must be reported to Alkermes 
and additional follow-up may be required. 
13.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE, occurring at any dose and regardless of causa lity that: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. The subject is at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurs. This does not include reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182031], Inc.  
(Amendment #3) ALK5461-208 
Page 48 • Results in disability/ incapacity (eg, a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182032], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed above. 
Some outcomes of pregnancy may meet the criteria of an SAE. These include: spontaneous 
abortion (including miscarriage or missed abortion), stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital 
anomaly (including that in an aborted fetus, stillbirth, neonatal death). All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_215116] to causality. In 
addition, any infant death occurring more than 1 month after birth that the investigator assesses 
as possibly related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should be reported. See Section  8.4.1 for details on reporting pregnancies. 
13.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The assessment of study drug relationship to each AE will be reported on the appropriate source document (and SAE form, in the event of an SAE) by [CONTACT_093] (or designated sub-investigator) according to his/her best clinical judgment. The criteria listed in Table [ADDRESS_215117] be present to be indicative of a particular drug relationship. All study drugs are considered “test drugs” for the purposes of the definitions listed in the table.

the final safety follow -up visit. Any AE or SAE having an onset after the final safety follow -up 
visit will not be collected or reported unless the investigator feels that the event may be related to 
the study drug. 
Subjects will be instructed by [CONTACT_182110]. 
All volunteered, elicited, and observed AEs are to be recorded on the AE eCRFs. 
The investigator will assess all AEs regarding any  causal relationship to the study drug 
(see Section  13.3), the intensity (severity) of the event, action taken, and subject outcome. 
The following criteria should be used to guide the assessment of intensity (severity): 
• Mild:  Causes awareness of sign or symptom, but is easily tolerated; does not interfere 
with usual activities  
• Moderate:  Causes discomfort enough to interfere with usual activities  
• Severe:  Is incapacitating; results in inability to work or perform usual activities  
All AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by [CONTACT_093], or until the 
subject is deemed by [CONTACT_182111]-up. 
For clinical  study safety reporting purposes, the most recent version of the IB will be used as the 
reference document to designate event expectedness.  
Withdrawal from the study as a result of an AE and any therapeutic measures that are taken shall 
be at the discretio n of the investigator . If a subject withdraws from the study for any reason

INTERVIEWER  
The first question for each item should be asked exactly as written.  Often this question will elicit enough 
information about the severity and frequency of a symptom for you to rate the item with confidence.  Follow -up 
questions are provided, however, for use when further exploration or additional clarification of symptoms is necessary.  The specified questions should be asked until you have enough information to rate the item confidently.  In some cases, you may also have to add your own follow -up questions to obtain necessary 
information.  
  
Time period
 .  The interview questions indicate that the ratings should be based on the patient's condition in the 
past week.  
 
Referent of "usual" or "normal" condition
 .  Several of the interview questions in the HAM- D refer to the 
patient's usual or normal functioning.  In some cases, such as when the patient has Dysthymia or Seasonal 
Affective Disorder, the referent should be to the last time they felt OK (i.e., not depressed or high) for at least a few weeks.  
 
This instrument provides an interview guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale (Hamilton, Max:  A rating scale for depression.  J Neurol 
Neurosurg Psychiat  23:56- 61, 1960) .  The anchor point descriptions, with very minor modifications, have been taken from the ECDEU 
Assessment Manual (Guy, William, ECDEU Assessment Manual for Psychopharmacology , Revised 1976, DHEW Publication No. (ADM) 
76-338).  Additional designators were added in parentheses to the depression scale anchor points by [CONTACT_182126], Lipsitz and Williams to 
further standardize ratings.  A reliability study of the SIGH -D (interview guide for the HAM -D alone) was published in the Archives of 
General Psychiatry
  (1988;45:742- 747).

Past 12 Months 
Actual Attempt: 
A potenti ally self-in jurious act committ ed with at least some wish to di e, as a result of act. Behavior was in part though t 
of as method to k ill oneself . Inten t does no t have to be 1 00%. If there is any intent/des ire to die  associated with t he act , 
then it can be consid ered an actual s uicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury o r harm, just the potential 
for injury or harm. I f person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth b ut gun is broken so no injury results , this is consid ered 
an attempt. 
Inferring Inten t: Even if an  individual denies intent/wish to  die, it may be inferred cli nically from t he behavi or or 
circumstances. For exam ple, a highly lethal act that i s clearly  not an accident so no other intent b ut suicide can be 
inferred (e.g. , gunshot to head, jumpi [INVESTIGATOR_182056] m window of a high f loor/story). Also, if some one denies intent  to die, b ut 
they thought that what they did co uld be lethal, intent m ay be inferred.

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must a sk about all types)   
Since Last Visit  
Actual Attempt: 
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some w ish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as 
method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%. If the re is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be 
considered an actual suicide attempt. There  does not have to be any injury or ha rm, just the potential for injury or harm.  If 
person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt. 
Inferring Intent: Even if an individ ual denies intent/w ish to die, it may be infer red clinically  from the behavior or circumst ances. 
For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to 
head,  jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_182065] a high floor/story ). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they th ought that what they did could 
be lethal, intent may be inferred. 
Have you m ade a suicide at tempt? 
Have you d one anything to ha rm you rself?  
Have you d one anything da ngerous where  you could have di ed? 
What did y ou do? 
Did you   as a way to end your  life?  
Did you want to die (even a litt le) when  you    ? 
Were you trying to end your  life when you  ? 
Or did you t hink it was possible you could h ave died from  ? 
Or did you do it purely  for other reasons / w ithout ANY i ntention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, 
get sy mpathy, or get something else to happen)? (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

prevented from pulling trigger. On ce they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised 
to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang - is 
stopped from doing so.

INTERVIEWER: The questions in bold for each item should be asked exactly as written. Often these questi ons will 
elicit enough information about the severity and frequency of a symptom for you to rate the item with confidence. Follow- up questions are provided, however, for use when further exploration or additional clarification of symptoms is 
necessary. The  specified questions should be asked until you have enough information to rate the item confidently. In 
some cases, you may also have to add your own follow -up questions to obtain necessary information. Note that 
questions in parentheses are optional, for use, for example if information is unknown.   
   
 
 
NOTES:  
 
Time period.  The ratings should be based on the patient's condition in the past week.  
 Change from baseline . In general, a symptom is rated as present only when it reflects a change from before th e 
depression began (baseline) . The interviewer must  identify a [ADDRESS_215163] time the person felt all right (i.e. not depressed or high) for at least a few weeks.  When a clear baseline cannot be 
established because of chronic depressive symptoms, current symptoms should be rated as observed over the past 7 
days.  
 
 
 
  
This interview guide is based on the Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (Montgomery SA, 
Asberg M: A new depression scale designed to be sensitive to change. Br J Psychiatry 
;1979 134: 382-9). The scale 
itself has been retained in its original form, except for reversing  the order of the first two items. This guide adds 
interview questions to aid in the assessment and application of the MADRS. Previous versions of this guide appeared in 1988, 1992, 1996, and 2005.

Janet B.W. Williams , D.S.W. 
 
 
INTERVIEWER : The first question for each item should be asked exactly as written. Often this 
question will elicit enough information about the severity and frequency of a symptom for  you to 
rate the item with confidence. Follow -up questions  are provided,  however,  for use when further 
exploration or additional clarification of symptoms is necessary. The specified questions should be 
asked until you have enough information to rate the item confidently. In some cases, you may also 
have to add you r own follow -up question s to obtai n necessar y information . For some of the HAM -
A items , you ma y find you have alread y asked abou t some of the symptom s (for a previous item) . 
You do not need to 
repeat question s about these symptom s unles s you need additiona l informatio n to rate the 
severity.  
All of th e items have the same ancho r points . The followin g may be usefu l as guide s to rating 
item severity:   
 
MILD : Occurs irregu larly and for short periods of time. 
MODERATE : Occur s more constantl y and of longe r duration , requiring  
considerabl e effort on the part of the subject to cope with it. 
SEVERE: Continuous and dominates  the subject’s life. 
VER Y SEVERE : Incapacitati ng.   
Interviewers may find it helpfu l to ask the patien t the followin g question s to hel p clarify th e 
severit y of a symptom : How much time does (the symptom ) take up? Has (the symptom ) been 
irregula r or constant? Has it been easily manageable? How sever e has it been when you get it? 
How much time over the last week has it been bothering you?    
NOTES : Time period .
 The rating s shoul d be based on the patient’ s conditio n in the past week.    
Panic Attacks. If the patien t has panic attacks, this wil l affect th e rating s of many of the 
symptoms . It is recommended that you conside r the total amount of time durin g the past week that 
the panic attac k symptom s occurred , as well as their severity . Therefore , for example, a patie nt who 
has few severe but short –lived panic attacks during the week, but wh o otherwis e does not have 
many anxiet y symptoms , woul d probabl y not have a very high total HAM -A score.  
 
This instrumen t provide s an intervie w guide for the Hamilto n Anxiet y Scale (Hamilto n M: The assessmen t of anxiet y states by [CONTACT_35254] . Brit  
J of Med Psychol  32:50- 55, 1959;  Hamilton M: The diagnosis  and rating of anxiety, In Studies of Anxiety , MM Lader , Ed., Meedley 
Bros. , Kent , 1969) . The ancho r point description s for the scale have been taken from the ECDE U Assessmen t Manue l (Guy, William, 
ECDEU Assessment Manual for Psychopharmacolog y, Revised 1976,  DMEW Publicatio n No. (ADM) 76-338), excep t that “sighing” 
and “dyspn ea,” which appea r twice in that version, have been taken out of the item “cardiovascula r symptoms, ” and left under

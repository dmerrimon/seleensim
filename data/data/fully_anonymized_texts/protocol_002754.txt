1.0 Introduction  
 Evidence shows that although clinical trial s are aimed at producing new strategies for 
reducing cancer morbidity and mortality , participation remains suboptimal for all 
populations , especially those from racial and ethnic groups  [1-3].  Although some 
interventions have been found to be effective at enhancing participation, few studies 
have tested tailored communication activities  using innovative communication 
techniques  (perceptual mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007])  with aims to  address barriers and facilitators for 
patients  and facilitate  more  engaged discussions with their providers  in real world 
settings .   We therefore aim to fill that gap by [CONTACT_6310] a culturally  diverse  and patient 
guided mHealth decision tool called mychoice , which  allows patients to explore their 
concerns and questions related to clinical trial participation , as well as  create a 
customized and personalized set of questions to enhanc e patient -provider 
communication and increase informed decision making.  This study employ s a mixed -
methods approach using both qualitative and quantitative data to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the mychoice  intervention for patients and to explore the prov ider and 
organizational factors that impact implementation. A randomized controlled trial will be 
performed with [ADDRESS_342412] cognitive de -briefing interviews after the intervention is completed 
with key stakeholders at the participating institutions , which will inform a larger 
implementation study  in the future . 
 
2.0 Objectives  
 The prima ry objective  of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the mychoice  
mHealth tool  on perceived patient self -efficacy and decisional conflict , and whether 
these results are enhanced in minority patients . 
 
 The secondary objective  of the study is to descr ibe the acceptability and feasibility of 
implementing mychoice  in oncology services at three  leading cancer centers in 
Philadelphia.   
 
 Purpose of the study : mychoice  was conceptualized and developed with a Fox Chase -
Temple NODAL grant, using  extensive for mative research, including the use of 
commercial marketing techniques  (perceptual mappi[INVESTIGATOR_280762])  and 
IRB # [ADDRESS_342413] that will provide critical understanding on feasibility to ensure 
scalability in a large medical setting. Results could inform how a tool like mychoice  could 
be implemented in a cancer center and e nhance communication about clinical trials 
between patients and doctors.  
 
 Specific Aims :  
o AIM  1:  Test the perceived usefulness  and effectiveness of mychoice  to 
increase patients ’ self-efficacy and decrease decisional conflict.  
o AIM 2 :  Describe  the accept ability and feasibility of implementing mychoice  
in oncology services at three  leading cancer centers in Philadelphia by 
[CONTACT_280777].   
 
 The following hypotheses  are prop osed for Specific Aim 1:  
o H1:  Compared to a non -tailored education aid, mychoice  will improve self -
efficacy in making a decision about participating in clinical trial s for all 
patients as well as a subsample of underrepresented patients ( non-white ). 
o H2: Compared to a non -tailored education aid, mychoice  will reduce 
decisional conflict about clinical trial participation for all patients, as well as a 
subsample of underrepresented patients ( non-white ). 
 
3.0 Background/Rationale  
 Background :  Evidence shows tha t ethnic and racial minorities are significantly 
underrepresented in clinical trials, which are critical to producing new strategies for 
reducing cancer morbidity and mortality for all populations [4 -22].    Recognizing the 
complexity of barriers to partic ipation in clinical trials, research has focused on 
potential strategies to enhance participation. Interventions have shown that 
provider referrals of minority patients, community outreach, acknowledging and 
addressing issues of trust, flexibility in inter vention methods, and population 
targeted materials are effective [23-26]. Few studies, however, have tested tailored 
communication activities to address barriers and facilitators for patients using 
innovative communication techniques in real world settings  – meaning ways these 
IRB # [ADDRESS_342414] visit improves knowledge, attitudes, and preparation for 
decision making about clinical trials [ 27] and integrating these tools into the clinical 
encounter is critical. In addition, using innovative communication techniques 
(perceptual mappi[INVESTIGATOR_280763] ) to validate and explore salient messages 
across diverse cancer patients provide d new insights into tailor ing messages and 
personaliz ing patient/provider communi cation .  Insight gained from validation of the 
intervention  will improve the decision making process, and inform a large scale 
integration of mychoice  to affect patient perceptions and increase willingness to 
participate in clinical trials , especially in m inority patients . 
In addition, we will assess barriers to implementation when introducing  the tool in 
diverse cancer centers, each with different protocols and patient populations, to 
inform a future proposal.  Using the Consolidated Framework for Implemen tation 
Science (CFIR), one of the predominant implementation science research 
frameworks, we will focus on five domains : intervention characteristics, outer 
settings, inner setting, characteristics of individuals (patients and providers), and 
process  [28].  Implementation science is becoming an important component of 
intervention implementation and we aim to use this framework to ensure success.   
o Preliminary Data : To address the issue of clinical trial participation, we 
developed mychoice  (IRB #14 -811)  to target unique barriers of 
underrepresented populations and prepare them for a discussion about clinical 
trials with their providers [ 29-38]. The intervention was developed with 
stakeholder (both patients and providers) involvement and includes real life 
stories of cancer patients. The intervention, initially focused on African American 
cancer patients, was based on mixed -methods formative research including in -
depth interviews (Phase I), a survey of African American cancer patients using 
perceptual mappi[INVESTIGATOR_280764] (Phase 2), and message and 
user testing of the mHealth tool with African American cancer patients who had 
never participated in clinical trials (Phase 3).  
In Phase 1 we conducted in -depth interviews with 16 African American cancer 
patients. Investigators reviewed and developed themes/subthemes, which 
resulted in eight themes:  knowledge , benefits , disadvantages , social support , 
decision influencers , provider b eliefs , personal history , and value of clinical trials. 
Results from these interviews were used, along with a thorough literature 
IRB # [ADDRESS_342415] over 
half (53.7%)  of whom  indicated they had never participated in a clinical trial.  
Surveys occurred either in person or over the phone and participants were asked 
to report how much they agreed or disagreed on a 0 -10 sc ale (0=strongly 
disagree, 10=strongly agree) with statements regarding clinical trials’ 
helpfulness, benefits, barriers, value, support from those around them, and 
beliefs about healthcare providers. T -tests revealed significant perceptual 
differences betw een individuals who had participated in a clinical trial and those 
who had not. Based on the perceptual maps that were generated, the research 
team  developed message strategies to address those issues found to be 
important in the maps .   
The resulting mych oice mHealth prototype was then developed, working with an 
app development company and in consultation with our research staff and 
oncologists. This iterative process included many changes to content, visuals and 
narrative. In addition, since patient -provi der communication and informed 
decision making was a main theme, we chose to make the mHealth tool 
interactive to provide patients with an easy way to ask providers questions that 
were tailored to their interests. The tool combines text, animation, and vid eos of 
real patients discussing the identified themes.   User testing of the mychoice 
prototype showed that the communication tool was easy to use and understand 
and was perceived to be very helpful in prepar ing patients to discuss clinical 
trials.  Feedbac k from the user testing with predominately African American 
patients indicated that the patient videos should be more diverse showing a 
broad representation of races and ethnicities.   In addition, a more culturally 
diverse, rather than a targeted interven tion for only African Americans , would be 
more representative of real world settings.  Therefore, the patient videos are 
being expanded for the current version.   
 Significance : Participation in clinical trials is a serious and complex decision, and 
many pa tients of all races and backgrounds have limited knowledge and 
understanding of clinical trials as a treatment option. Although much research has 
been conducted to explore the barriers to participation, there has been a call for 
more intervention research to address these barriers  [39]. A fundamental aspect of 
patient  focused interventions is an exploration of their personal questions and 
concerns, without which  it is difficult for patients to be come  empowered to 
participate in a n informed or shared decisio n making process. However, there 
remains limited empi[INVESTIGATOR_280765] a 
diverse range of patients to improve decision making, and how decision tools can be 
tailored to enhance the patient -provider communication d yad.  This research will 
provide insight into that process when the decision is participation in clinical trials.

 4.0 Study Design  
a) Recruitment methods  
o We will recruit a total of 270 patients ( 100 130 at FCCC via the medical 
oncology, radiation oncology,  and surgery units and 100 at TUHS via the 
cancer center).  The remaining  40 70 patients will be recruited at  Thomas 
Jefferson University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_280766] 20% of the participant pool will be non -white 
which should provide sufficient number to perform sub -analyses of effects.  
We will monitor this during recruitment, however, and if we find that we are 
not reaching this number of non-white participants, we will change the 
protocol to focus on recrui ting only non -white participants.  
o There are three ways that patients will be recruited for the study  at FCCC .  
This is shown in Figure 1.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o (1) First, a t FCCC, [CONTACT_280792]  will collaborate with FCCC  oncologists to 
identify patie nts who might be offered a clinical trial but who  have  not 
participated in a clinical trial previously.  A patient information card and a 
flyer have been developed for oncologists to provide to patients (see 
 
IRB # 17 -8013  
Page 8 of 22 
 
Page 8 of 22 
 Appendices A and B).   Oncologists will suggest the study to patients at 
regular visits and be instructed to either go to the Resource and Education 
Center at Fox Chase, or find a study representative in the waiting area at a 
table who is wearing a mychoice pin. Mychoice study staff will be in the 
waiti ng areas of participating oncologists on days/times that are busiest.  If 
staff are not available that day , they can go to the REC.  If the patient 
approaches a study staff, they  will meet the patient in a designated private 
space , consent them , and give t hem the option of doing the study then on 
either a provide d iPad  or go  to the REC to do the study on a computer.   
o (2) Study staff will also be available in the common areas of FCCC at a table.  
Patients can come up to the table and ask about the study.  We  will also have 
a small “wheel” that is a game that patients can play to win small prizes 
(candy, umbrella, $5 gift cards). All patients who come up to the table can 
play and win a small prize; there is no requirement to enroll in the study to 
play. If the y are interested in the study, we will provide an information card 
and answer any questions they have.  They can then complete consent and 
do the study then (as above) or have the option to complete the study at 
home.   
o (3) Another way  for patients to part icipate is through a referral by [CONTACT_280778].  
When patients go to the REC, staff will provide information to the patients 
about the stud y.  If they are intere sted, REC staff will go through the above 
steps to consent a patient and provide them an iPad or co mputer to 
complete the study.  
o (3) The last way for patients to participate will be by [CONTACT_6270] -referral.  Cards and 
posters will be available throughout the waiting areas.  On this card are the 
study email and phone number. Patients could use these to contact [CONTACT_280779]. 
Because this consent is occurring over the phone, staff will use a script 
(provided) to explain the  study and screen for eligibility. A waiver of 
document of consent has been provided to assist with this process. After 
they have verbally been consented for the study, they will be sent a link to 
the study through the RedCAP system and provided informatio n on how to 
complete the study. They will be directed to review the study consent and 
indicate their willingness to participate by [CONTACT_280780] e -
signature.  They then will be asked to do the same with the HIPAA waiver.  
Once they agree, they will be directed to the baseline survey.  
o Patients recruited at TUH , Jefferson,  and HUP will  follow the same 
recruitment strategies, but will only  be recruited by [CONTACT_280781]-Referral. There are no REC staff at these institutions , so recruit ment 
strategies will rely solely on study staff and physicians. Study staff will be in 
the waiting rooms prepared for any referrals during busy clinic days.  
IRB # [ADDRESS_342416] them sign in the 
REDCap  system to indicate they agree to participate (script for staff to follow 
in Appendix C)  and to the HIPAA waiver . Study assignment will be random 
and programmed into the system  
o The email  link will provide a contact [CONTACT_2300], phone number, and email should 
the participant have any questions or concerns.  If they ch oose to come to the 
REC because they do not want to do the study at home , we will make an 
appointment with them to meet them at a designated day/time.  
o The REDCap link will include  pre/post -tests (Appendi ces D and E) for all 
patients, and the appropriate pa tient education materials based on 
randomization. (Note:  Baseline surveys take a pproximately [ADDRESS_342417] surveys take approximately 5 minutes, based on testing.)   The pre 
and posttests as well as the consent form will be integr ated into the 
materials through REDCap .   All patients will then be contact[CONTACT_280782] a follow -up 
survey (Appendix F – Treatment Arm; Appendix G – Control Arm).  In some 
cases (i.e. at TUH) follow -ups w ill be done in person when the patient has 
returned for an appointment.  
o The experimental condition will receive the mychoice  mHealth Tool (Screen 
shots (http://mychoice.sandstorm.notss.com ) of the tool ar e provided in 
Appendix G.) The entire tool is available at the URL. The control condition will 
receive the NCI material on clinical trials: Taking Part in Cancer Treatment 
Research Studies ( https://www.cancer.gov/publications/patient -
education/CRS.pdf ).  Both will be provided on the device through the RedCAP 
system .  Participants  in the experimental condition  will receive a pair of ear 
buds  (which they can keep)  to listen to audio /video segments and will 
receive a printed version of the questions they identify as important to them.      
o Patient p articipants will receive a total of $50 compensation, provided as a 
$[ADDRESS_342418] at initial testing and an additional $25 upon follow -up survey.   
These will be provided in person if they choose to complete the study in 
person or via mail if they choose to complete the study at home.  Recruiters 
and physicians interviewed about implementation will not receive 
compensation.  
b) Inclusion and excl usion criteria  
o Eligibility criteria for participation in the RCT are:  1. 18 years of age or over; 
2. Active diagnosis of invasive cancer  (any diagnoses) ; pre or post 
chemo/radiation/surgery ; 3. Able to speak and read English   
o Exclusion :  Participated  in a therapeutic trial  in the past

 To assess implementation issues and address Specific Aim 2, w e will use the Consolidated 
Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to guide the implementation evaluation, 
focus ing on the acceptability and feasibility of implemen ting the mychoice  study as well as the 
integration of this tool in ongoing practice.  This evaluation is descriptive in nature.  To evaluate 
the acceptability and feasibility of the proposed mychoice  study, we will collect data from the 
initial planning mee tings, review of recruitment logs and files, as well as surveys from 
physicians who have patients that are participating in the study.   Meeting notes will be kept 
and used to design the recruitment process, procedures , and logs.   Prior  to the start of 
recruitment  (using REDCap ; Appendix H ) and at project end  (will be developed based on how 
interventio n is implemented in sites) , an online survey will be conducted with each physician 
who has patients who are participating in the study.  The survey will a ssess level of 
commitment to the project and potential barriers.   The survey will include key constructs from 
CFIR, such as  perceptions of intervention strength, relative advantage, trialability, patient 
needs, self -efficacy, and champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458].   During the recr uitment  period  and throughout the  study, 
recruiters will keep logs of the number of identified patients, number of consented patients,  
and notes regarding challenges and opportunities in the recruitment process.   At the end of the 
recruitment, the PIs wil l conduct debriefing interviews with the stakeholders  (guide to be 
developed based on implementation)  at each site to more fully explore the challenges and 
opportunities for ongoing implementation and sustainability  (Figure 3).  Table 2 describes the 
measu res for the implementation evaluation.

5.0 Risks to P articipant s 
 Participating in this study does not pose direct physical risk to patients. Participants 
may have questions about clinical trials after taking the surveys , in which case they  
will be instructed to talk with their oncologist about medical or eligibility q uestions 
related to clinical trials. Participants may also be directed to the Resource and 
Education Centers at TUHS for additional information about clinical trials.  
 
6.0 Potential Benefits to P articipants  
 Participating in the study does not pose direct physical benefit to participants. This is 
not a therapeutic study, but rather an evaluation of an educational app. The results 
of the research will be used to modify the app thereby [CONTACT_276483] a more appropriate 
and useful decision -making tool to help Afric an American, and other cancer patients , 
make better informed decisions concerning clinical trial participation.  
7.0 Provisions to Maintain the Confidentiality of D ata 
 All information collected for this study will be kept confidential.  Subjects will be tol d 
that all information will be kept in strict confidence.  All deidentified survey data will 
be downloaded from RedCAP and stored on computer files or in locked filing 
cabinets to which only select members of the research staff will have access.  
 RedCAP  survey data and user data from the mHealth tool  will be identified only by 
[CONTACT_280785].   
 ipads have been purchased for this study and will be used to implement the 
intervention , along with computers used e ither at the REC or in the participant ’s 
home .  All ipads and REC computers are  password protected with only study staff 
having that information. No files will be saved or downloaded on the ipad s or 
computers , and no data will be accessible on the ipads or computers that would 
identify patients.  Participants  will go to a RedCAP study URL which will then 
randomize them to condition.  All data from the surveys will be gathered by [CONTACT_280786].   
 All participating s ites will direct patients to the RedCAP URL to begin the study.  No 
data will be shared with them and they will not have access to the data.  Only study 
PIs and the study coordinator will have this access.   
 For medical staff personnel, surveys will also b e sent via email where they will be 
provided a RedCAP link.  When conducting interviews, a digital recorder will be used 
to capture the interview.  These will be transcribed and then destroyed.  No 
identifying information will be recorded on the transcript ions.  In-depth implementation

  All data will be housed behind the firewall at Fox Chase Canacer Center  using 
RedCAP.  The PIs and study coordinator, will have access to this data and will 
download de -identified data for analysis to share with the biostatistician to be used 
in SAS.  A special study ID and password will be required to enter into RedCAP.  In 
addition, any additional files will be password protected and kept on secure, fire -
wall protected servers at Temple University  and Fox Chase Cancer Center . 
8.0 Costs to P articipan ts 
 There are no costs to participants.   The study will take approximately 1 hour initially 
([ADDRESS_342427]).  The one month follow survey will take approximately 30 minutes.   
 For med ical staff participants, surveys will take less than 5 minutes; post -
intervention interviews will take approximately 30 minutes.  
 
9.0 Consent P rocess  
 The study coordinator will introduce the study and review the consent document  
either in person or over th e phone . If providing consent over the phone, the staff 
member will read the consent to the participant (script provided).  If they verbally 
agree, they will be directed to the link in their email for the study.  The study 
consent  document  is then also  emb edded into the RedCAP  baseline survey that will 
be on the iPad  or computer .  Participants will read through the consent and provide 
consent by [CONTACT_280787] a designated  button.  They then will be 
asked to do the same for the HIPAA consen t. These consent s will be recorded and 
the participant will be allowed to proceed to the baseline survey.  If the participant 
has any questions about the study or consent s, the site recruiter will be available  in 
person or over the phone .  Staff will have copi[INVESTIGATOR_280768] a copy to take home ; those doing at home can download a 
pdf of the consent to have a copy . The script s for the staff person to explain this is 
included (App C).  A telephone screening consent script is also provided.  
 Participants will be able to decide to continue or discontinue at any time.  
 All participants will be English speaking.

 12.0 Multi -Site Research Study  
 •        Fo x Chase Cancer Center serves as the primary site, with participating sites 
including sites Temple University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Thomas Jefferson University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971]. [CONTACT_280792] serves as the PI [INVESTIGATOR_280769]. Each site will have their own 
IRB oversight and coordinating investigator [INVESTIGATOR_280770] (e -
consent and protocol) to meet their institutions requirements. [CONTACT_280792] and the 
study coordinat or at FCCC will oversee the other sites regulatory by [CONTACT_280788]’s Human Subjects training and expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659]. They will also track 
all sites Continuing Reviews to ensure compliance across all 4 coordinating sites.  
 [CONTACT_280792] and the s tudy coordinator at FCCC will also oversee protocol 
management by [CONTACT_280789]’s 
protocol. The study coordinator will conduct on -site visits monthly to review 
recruitment and study progress. All sites will pa rticipate in a monthly full team call to 
discuss updates and address any recruitment/implementation issues.  
 Each site will be provided an Operations Manual that incorporates important 
protocol specific information to provide support onsite. Each member of the study 
staff will have [ADDRESS_342428] periodic recruitment training to reinforce operations and protocol 
compliance.  
 Data management will take place at FCCC via REDCap weekly by [CONTACT_280790]. The Study Coordinator will review quality and completeness of the data 
on a weekly basis and provide feedback to each site PI [INVESTIGATOR_280771].  
13.0 Statistical  Analysis  
 General analyses: After screening for potential differences across  sites on the key 
outcome variables, all data will be graphed and tabulated by [CONTACT_19313] (i.e., mychoice  
vs. control) for review of distributional properties and anomalous values prior to the 
main analyses. Continuous and normally distributed variables will be  summarized 
with means and standard deviations. All parameter estimates will be bound by 95% 
confidence intervals. Tests of significance will be based on adjustments for alpha to 
protect family -wise error rates at 5% using the method of Benjamini and Hochb erg 
[40]. Data will be analyzed using an intent -to-treat (ITT) approach where subjects are 
analyzed according to their treatment assignment at randomization, regardless of 
level of participation or engagement. Because an ITT analysis is planned, we will 
evaluate models suitable for non -ignorable (missing not at random) data within a 
sensitivity analysis framework in order to determine the extent to which analysis 
conclusions depend on the assumptions being made about unobserved values. We 
will perform model -based analyses with direct maximum likelihood methods, 
including those for data missing not at random (MNAR) if necessary. We will screen 
for violations of assumptions for all statistical tests involved. All analyses for specific 
aims will be conducted us ing SAS 9.4 . 
IRB # 17 -8013

  H1 Analysis : The principle endpoint will be 1-month follow -up, i.e., one month after 
completion of either the  mychoice  or control education . We will conduct a mixed -
effect regression models for each repeatedly measured continuous outcome (i.e. , 
self-efficacy and decisional conflic t at post intervention and 1-month follow -up) on a 
dummy groupi[INVESTIGATOR_164572] ( mychoice , as compared to Control), adjusting for baseline 
level of this outcome  and covariates discovered to be unbalanced between the two 
groups, and moderators of interest.  In these models, we will treat time as a 
categorical variable and examine the fixed effects for time, intervention group, and 
their interactions.  We will specify the covariance structure within patients using an 
unstruct ured model to account for the in -patient correlation over time.   
 
In addition, the dichotomous race ( White  vs. non -White ) variable and the non-
White -Treatment interaction will be entered in each regression model as predictors, 
to understand possible differ ent effects of mychoice  for non-White  vs. White  
participants. A significant, positive regression coefficient of the non-White  
Treatment interaction indicates non-white  participants’ benefits more from the 
treatment than their White  counterparts.   
 Power:  Power analyses were performed using G*Power 3.1, with 2 -sided tests and 
an adjusted alpha level of .0 25 (= .05/ 2) for multiple group comparisons. We 
performed power analyses for comparisons on primary and secondary outcomes for 
Aim 1.  Effect size (mean dif ference between groups divided by [CONTACT_24703]) is a common measure for assessing the magnitude of a treatment effect 
on continuous outcomes.  The number of participants needed for Aim [ADDRESS_342429]  scales , our trial would need 88 patients pe r group, presuming 
alpha = .025 and beta = .20 (power = 80%). Of note, this effect size is comparable to  
prior studies (please c ite some papers). Including a 20% adjustment for dropout and 
loss of degrees  of freedom when adjusting for possible additional confounding 
variables, a total of [ADDRESS_342430] by [CONTACT_280791], bringing the total 
needed to 270.  
 H2 Analysis : Descriptive statistics will be employed for the analysis of t he 
quantitative feasibility and acceptability data.  All qualitative data collected through 
the meeting notes and debriefing interviews will analyzed the Krueger method of 
analyzing narrative data will be used; familiarization, identifying a thematic 
framew ork indexing, charting, mappi[INVESTIGATOR_280772] [80]. Recordings will be 
listened to and transcriptions read to become familiar with what participants said. A

barriers.   
14.0 Data Sa fety Monitoring Plan  
o This is a minimal risk study.  We will monitor the study and any participant 
complaints or issues.  In general, we believe data will be accurate based on 
self-reported attitudes.  
 
15.0 Adverse Event  Reporting  
 In accordance with FCCC gu idelines, this protocol will employ the following 
mechanisms for adverse event reporting: 1) alert the FCCC review committees of 
any and all reports of adverse events; 2) inform all members of the study team of 
any all reports of adverse events.  If 3 or m ore adverse events are reported, the 
study team will assess potential causes of the adverse events and, if events are 
clearly linked to study participation, discontinue the study.  
 
16.0 Quality Assurance Procedures and Participant Confidentiality  
 Informat ion about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to 
the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability  and Accountability Act of 1996 
(HIPAA). Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the 
subject of the f ollowing: The protected health information (PHI) that will be 
collected from patient ; who will have access to that information and why; who will 
use or disclose that information; the rights of a research subject to revoke their 
authorization or use their P HI. In the event that a participant revokes authorization 
to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all 
information prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  To ensure 
confidentiality , only a participant  identifier will be recorded and used with collected 
electronic data .  All records will be secured in a locked location.   
 While we will not access private health information during the study  accrual , but 
may access information on their participation in a clin ical trial when we are analyzing 
data while the IRB is still open .  As a result we will maintain the HIPAA waiver in the 
consent process.

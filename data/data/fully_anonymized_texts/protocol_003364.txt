commonly used for atrial fibrillation ablation, which requires two sheaths/catheters to be 
inserted into the left atrium. Puncture through the interatrial septum is typi[INVESTIGATOR_92285] a needle, which is pushed through the fossa ovalis and into the left atrium. The 
major risk of transseptal puncture is inadvertent injury to the wall of the left atrium by [CONTACT_92291], potentially resulting in pericardial bleeding, 
cardiac tamponade, and even death.
2. STUDY RATIONALE
Prior studies have shown that a radiofrequency (RF) transseptal needle is superior to a 
standard, manual needle with regard to left atrial access time. Recently, a novel RF wire 
system has been developed to further enhance the speed and safety of transseptal access. 
With this technique, an atruamatic RF wire can be used to both traverse the fossa ovalis 
and shield the left atrial wall from traumatic injury secondary to the advancing sheath.
While this new RF wire system has recently become clinically available, there is no data 
substantiating its enhanced efficacy and safety compared to standard needle-based 
transseptal techniques.
3.STUDY OBJECTIVES
Primary Objective: To determine if the Baylis Versacross RF wire results in a shorter time to 
successful transseptal puncture compared to the conventional Baylis RF needle.
Secondary Objectives:
To determine if the Baylis Versacross RF wire results in greater first attempt transseptal 
puncture success compared to the conventional Baylis RF needle.
To determine if the Baylis Versacross RF wire results in less complications compared to 
the conventional Baylis RF needle.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015To determine if the Baylis Versacross RF wire results in less right atrial needle/wire 
exchanges compared to the conventional Baylis RF needle.
4. STUDY DESIGN
This is a randomized, single blinded clinical trial comparing transseptal access using the 
Baylis Versacross RF wire versus the conventional Baylis RF needle among individuals 
undergoing atrial fibrillation catheter ablation.
Sedation, intubation, vascular access, and catheter ablation will be performed according to 
usual clinical care. Transseptal puncture will be performed using intracardiac ultrasound 
guidance. Each patient will undergo two transseptal punctures.
For participants randomized to the RF wire access system, the following equipment will 
be used:
o VersaCross™ RF Wire (Baylis, Montreal, Canada)
o VersaCross™ Transseptal Sheath (Baylis, Montreal, Canada)*
o VersaCross™ Steerable Sheath (Baylis, Montreal, Canada)*
*Because the transseptal wire does not provide the same mechanical support as a RF 
needle, these sheaths and their accompanying dilators must be used with the RF wire.
For participants randomized to the RF needle, the following equipment will be used:
o NRG® transseptal needle (Baylis, Montreal, Canada)
o SL1 sheath (Abbott Medical, Santa Clara, [LOCATION_004]).
o Agilis steerable sheath (Abbott Medical, Santa Clara, [LOCATION_004])
The primary endpoint is time to complete transseptal puncture. Timing will start when the 
transseptal sheath wire is inserted into the femoral vein short sheath and will stop when 
the transseptal dilator is removed from the long sheath after placement in the left atrium. 
For each transseptal, the number of unsuccessful attempts requiring rewiring will be 
recorded. Fluoroscopy time, fluoroscopy dose, number of RF applications, procedural 
complications, and total procedural time will also be determined.

11. ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
a. Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a 
patient. It does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE is 
therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the administration of an investigational 
product, whether or not related to that investigational product. An unexpected AE is one 
of a type not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure or of greater severity or frequency than expected based on the information in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.
The Investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence of AEs 
during each subject visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.
Adverse events will be recorded in the patient CRF. Adverse events will be described by 
[CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to 
study intervention, or if unrelated, the cause.

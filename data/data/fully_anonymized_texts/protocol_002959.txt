Title: Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376926] : E. Sherwood Brown, M.D., Ph.D.  
 Funding Sponsor : None, submitted to NIAAA  
 
IND: This study is exempt from IND requirements  (FDA -Approved, Unapproved Use)  
 1. Introduction and Purpose:  
Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376927] a promising potential treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD) , is currently 
FDA-approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder (BPD), and may be well suited for dual -diagnosis 
populations. However, its utility may be limited by [CONTACT_376994], as well 
as the outcomes  used  and populations chosen for previous study. To address these problems we propose to 
1) use a dual -diagnosis population because aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376928], 2) use a dose of only 15 mg/day unless the patient qualifies for the exploratory phase or the 
patient is on strong CYP3A4 inducers which increase aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376929], 3) use participants with high impulsiveness since this may predict a favorable aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376930], and 4) use a primary outcome measure that is sensitive to aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376931]. This study will be one of a very small number of controlled trials in BPD and substance use disorders, and will be an adequately 
powered trial in an important and under -researched population. Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376932] a low cost treatment 
since a generic formulation should be available prior to the end of the study. This study will include both English - and Spanish- speaking participants.  
Primary Aim: Determine if aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376933]- on therapy is associated with a greater reduction in alcohol 
use than placebo therapy in outpatients with BPD  or Schizoaffective Disorder ( Bipolar Type) and alcohol use 
disorder.  
 Secondary Aim: 1) Determine if aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376933]- on therapy is associated with a greater reduction in 
alcohol craving than placebo therapy in outpatients with BPD  or Schizoaffective Disorder ( Bipolar Type) and 
AUD.  
 
Additional Exploratory Analyses: 1) Determine if aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376933]- on therapy is associated with a greater 
reduction in manic and depressive symptoms than placebo therapy in outpatients with BPD  or Schizoaffective 
Disorder ( Bipolar Type) and AUD. 2) Determine whether changes in alcohol craving and mood occur before or 
after changes in alcohol use with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]. 3) Determine if impulsivity decreases with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376934]. 4) Assess rates of attrition, safety and tolerability of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]. 5) Examine genotype as a 
predictor of response to aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]. 6) Explore safety, tolerability and efficacy of an increase in aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376935] [ADDRESS_471672] one  heavy  drinking day at week 12. 7) Determine if 
inflammation decreases with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376936].  
 
2. Background:   
Drug and alcohol abuse are common in persons with BPD.1-4 In a community -based study, person s 
with bipolar I disorder had a 46% lifetime prevalence of alcohol -related disorders compared to 14% in the 
population as a whole.5 Odds ratio of alcohol dependence is 5.5 for bipolar I disorder and 3.1 for bipolar II 
disorder. BPD is also much more common in people with alcohol dependence than the general population, with 
a 6% prevalence in men (odds ratio 12) and 7% in women (odds ratio 5).6 Although disulfiram is effective for 
highly motivated patients, lack of adherence  and safety concerns limit its use.7-9 Acamprosate is an effective

Page 2 of 17 medication based on some,10-12 but not all,13 large randomized, controlled trials. Selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) may decrease alcohol consumption in some persons.[ADDRESS_471673], aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376937], while augmenting dopamine at  low dopamine concentrations. Thus, 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376938] “normalize” dopaminergic tone and may act in a region -specific fashion to 
either increase or decrease dopamine levels.22 Consistent with this view are data suggesting that aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376939] D2 autoreceptors in the ventral tegmental area (a brain region thought to be involved in AUD)23 
and thereby [CONTACT_376995].24 By [CONTACT_376996], aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376940] (decreased dopamine) or 
relapse to drinking (high dopamine).[ADDRESS_471674] specifically examined the pharmacotherapy of patients 
with BPD and  AUD. Thus, more research is much needed in this important population. We examined a group 
of patients with BPD and substance use disorders (n=20) switched from their current atypi[INVESTIGATOR_67128] 
(generally quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) to aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]. Mean depression and manic symptom scores significantly improved. In the subset (n=17) with AUD, the switch to aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376941] a reduction in both alcohol use and craving. Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376942]. Scores on scales for antipsychotic side effects (akat hisia, 
extrapyramidal symptoms, abnormal movements) did not change significantly. The findings, while preliminary in nature, suggest that aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376943].  Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376927] a promising potential treatment for AUD. 
However, its utility may be limited by [CONTACT_376994], as well as the outcomes and population chosen. To address these problems we propose to 1)  use a dual -diagnosis 
population because aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376944]  2) use a 
dose of only 15 mg/day except in an exploratory phase, unless the patient qualifies for the exploratory phase or the patient is on strong CYP3A4 inducers which increase aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376945] 3) use participants with high impulsiveness since this may predict a favorable aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376930], and 4) use a primary outcome measure that is sensitive to aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376931].  
 
3. Concise Summary of Project:   
We will conduct a 12-week, randomized, double- blind, parallel- group, placebo- controlled study of 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_297557] 132 persons with AUD and bipolar I, II, or NOS  disorder . Primary Aim will be to assess change 
in alcohol use by [CONTACT_376997] (TLFB) method.
29, 30 Secondary Aim will include change in alcohol 
craving using the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS).31 Changes in psychiatric symptoms (mania/hypomania 
and depression) and predictors of response will be assessed. Participants with ≥ [ADDRESS_471675] titration to 30 mg/day for those in the active treatment 
group. The placebo group will remain on placebo. 
 At the participant’s last visit, the participant will be detitrated according to the following schedule: 
• If at 10 mg qAM:  5 mg qAM for 2 days, then 2 mg qAM for 2 days  
• If at 15 mg qAM:  10 mg qAM for 2 days, then 5 mg qAM for 2 days, then 2 mg qAM for 2 days  
• If at 30 mg qAM:  15 mg qAM for 2 days, then 10 mg qAM for 2 days, then 5 mg qAM for 2 days, 
then 2 mg qAM for 2 days

If the patient is taking strong CYP3A4 inducers, the participant’s last visit, the participant will be 
detitrated according to the following schedule:  
• If at 10 mg qAM:  4 mg qAM for 2 days  
• If at 20 mg qAM:  10 mg qAM for 2 days, then 4 mg qAM for 2 days  
• If at 30 mg qAM:  20 mg qAM for 2 days, then 10 mg qAM for 2 days, then 4 mg qAM for 2 days,  
 
Subjects will be discontinued from the study if any of the following conditions occurs: change in 
diagnosis to other than bipolar I, II, or NOS  disorder and AUD, development of active suicidal or homicidal 
ideation with plan and intent , worsening in mood symptoms, that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_297567], p regnancy , development of seve re or life -threatening medical condition, i nvoluntary psychiatric 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_297568], or significant alcohol withdrawal (e.g. delirium tremens) based on clinical 
judgment  (increases in CIWA -Ar scores will initiate a careful clinical assessment of possible worsening of 
withdrawal symptoms).

Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression34 17-item version (HRSD 17), potential withdrawal symptoms from alcohol 
via the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Use- Revised35 (CIWA -Ar), recent alcohol use (and, 
if present, other substance use) will be assessed using the Timeline Follow Back29, 30 (TLFB) method, 
impulsivity will be asse ssed with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale36 (BIS- 11), and blood will be drawn for

A urine sample for drug screen and pregnancy test (if applicable), psychiatrist assessment, physical 
exam, collection of weight and vitals can be completed at either Baseline 1 or Baseline 2.   
 
For Baseline 2 (~1.5 hours) , recent depressive symptoms will be assessed via the Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology –Self-Report37-40 30-item version (IDS -SR 30), and drinking behavior will be characterized using 
the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale31 (PACS), safety and side effects will be assessed with the Psychobiology of 
Recovery in Depression III - Somatic Symptom Scale42 (PRD- III), the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale43 
(AIMS), Barnes Akathis ia Scale44 (BAS) and Simpson-A ngus Scale45 (SAS), and Go/No- go task.46, 47. The 
Treatment Impressions Inventory (TII) is a survey about  the participants’ feelings and impressions towards 
medical treatment.  The TLFB will be repeated to account for drinking behavior since the last visit and CIWA -Ar 
will account for any withdrawal symptoms. The aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376946] 2 mg/day in the morning, increased (if well tolerated) to 5 mg at week 1, 10 mg at week 2 and 15 mg/day (or equivalent

Version #1, 12/14/15  
Page 5 of 17 Participants will be offered an optional genetic component of their study participation and will not be 
prevented from partic ipating if they choose to not contribute to this genetic component.  Additional blood 
(20mLs)  will be drawn  if this component is elected. These blood samples will be sent for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_376948]. Genetics studies implicate the T102C 
HTR2A polymorphism,48, 49 and - 1438 A/G polymorphism of the serotonin 2A (5- HT2A) receptor gene,50 as well 
as the rs7916403 in serotonin receptor gene HTR7 on chromosome 10q235,51 (both receptors with affinity for 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]) in alcohol dependence. Impulsivity in alcohol dependence is also associated with the -1438A 
polymorphism in the promoter region of the 5 -HT2A receptor.52 The L/L genotype of the 5 -HTTLPR promoter 
region of the serotonin re -uptake transporter (5 -HTT) is associated with early onset of AUD and reduction in 
alcohol use with ondansetron.53-55 Alcohol-dependent persons homozygous or heterozygous for the seven (or 
longer) -repeat allele of the DRD4 VNTR responded to olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_376949] -elicited craving as well 
as alcohol consumption.56 We will als o consider adding additional genetic analyses if promising new 
associations should emerge (e.g. a predictor of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376950]), based on the 
available literature at the time of the analysis .

8. Sources of Research Material:   
Clinical information  will be obtained via the Structured Clinical Interview fo r DSM (SCID)32, the Clinical 
Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Use- Revised35 (CIWA -Ar), the Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression34 17-item version (HRSD 17), Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology –Self-Report37-40 30-item 
version (IDS -SR 30), Young Mania Rating Scale33 (YMRS), Penn Alcohol Craving Scale31 (PACS), the 
Psychobiology of Recovery in Depression III - Somatic Symptom Scale42 (PRD -III), Abnormal Involuntary 
Movement Scale43 (AIMS), Barnes Akathisia Scale44 (BAS) and Simpson -Angus Scale45 (SAS),  the Barratt 
Impulsiveness Scale36 (BIS- 11), the Go/No -go task.46, 47, the Timeline Follow Back29, 30 (TLFB).  
 
Biological information will be obtained via blood drawn (18mLs)  for laboratory analyses including a 
complete blood count (CBC) and Comprehensive Metabolic Panel ( CMP, includes a liver panel with AST, ALT, 
as well as lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]), high- sensitivity c -reactive protein (hs -CRP), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), 
carbohydrate- deficient transferring ( CDT), and aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376947]. In addition, blood will be obtained at 
baseline (with the participant’s consent) for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (an additional 20mLs) . A redraw may be requested if 
the first sample cannot be processed.  A physical examination will be performed, weight obtained,  and a urine 
sample collected for a drug screen  and pregnancy testing.  
 
9. Recruitment Methods and Consenting Process:  
Participants will be recruited from the community through advertisements, by [CONTACT_377000] (PNE), and by [CONTACT_297584]. Recruitment can be challenging in dual-diagnosis studies. By [CONTACT_377001] (bipolar type) , the rate of enrollment is generally not as fast as in studies of patients 
with AUD alone. However, we have had great success in recruiting this patient population. Over the past 16+ 
years, we have conducted some of the largest trials in BPD and substance use, including trials of quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_376953] [ADDRESS_471679] about the study and participation. If the individual chooses 
to sign the informed consent document, he or she may begin testing for the study.

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant  
Syndrome (NMS) may occur with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]. Rare cases of NMS have been reported with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253].  
 A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, facial or body movements, called tardive dyskinesia, may 
develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. The presence of these symptoms will be regularly 
evaluated.  
 
Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) has been reported in some patients treated with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_376955]. Glucose levels will be checked at entry to and during the study.  
 Increases in lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (e.g. cholesterol) have been observed in some patients treated with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_376956]. Lipid levels will be checked at entry to and during the study.  
 
Psychological Stress  
Some of the questions asked as part of this study may make the participant feel uncomfortable.  They may 
refuse to answer any of the questions, take a break or stop participation in the study at any time. 
 
Loss of Confidentiality  
Any time information is collected; there is a potential risk for loss of confidentiality.  Every effort will be made to keep your information confidential; however, this cannot be guaranteed.  
 
Risks to Sperm, Embryo, Fetus or Breast -fed Infant  
Males:  Being in this research may damage sperm, which could cause harm to a child that a participant may 
father while in this study. Subjects who participate in this study and are sexually active, must agree to use a medically -acceptable form of birth control. Medically -acceptable forms of birth control include:  
(1) surgical sterilization (vasectomy), or  
(2) a condom used with a spermicide (a substance that kills sperm).  
 
Females:  Subjects participating in this study while pregnant or breast -feeding an infant may expose the 
unborn child or infant to risks.  For that reason, pregnant and breast -feeding females are excluded from 
participating in the study.  If a participant can become pregnant,  a urine pregnancy test will be done and it must 
be negative before participation in this study. Subjects who participate in this study and are sexually active, Black Box Warning

(1) surgical sterilization (such as hysterectomy or “tubes tied”), 
(2) approved hormonal contraceptives ( such as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patch or ring; Depo -Provera, 
Implanon),  
(3) barrier methods (such as condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide (a substance that kills 
sperm), or  
(4) an intrauterine device (IUD).  
If a subject does become pregnant during this study, they are informed that they must tell the researchers 
immediately.  
 
Risks of Blood Drawing  
Risks associated with drawing blood from the arm include minimal discomfort and/or bruising.  Infection, 
excess bleeding, clotting, and/or fainting also are possible, although unlikely.  
 
Placebo 
Receiving a placebo means that no active medication will be administered for a health problem.  If the problem 
becomes worse, participation in the research will stop.  If this happens, the study doctor can discuss alternative care with the participant.  
 
Psychological Stress  
Some of the questions asked as part of this study may make the participant feel uncomfortable.  They may refuse to answer any of the questions, take a break or stop participation in this study at any time.  
 
Loss of Confidentiality  
Any time information is c ollected; there is a potential risk for loss of confidentiality.  Every effort will be made to 
keep information confidential; however, this cannot be guaranteed.  
 11. Subject Safety and Data Monitoring:  
The likely risks from the study are primarily medication side effects and the risk of untreated alcohol use 
disorder or bipolar disorder. Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376957]. Approximately half of the subjects will not receive active 
medication during the study; however, they will receive frequent monitoring and follow -up appointments with a 
psychiatrist and research coordinator, in addition to Medical Management (MM), and their concomitant bipolar 
disorder medications (e .g. lithium ,valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin).  Thus, both groups will receive care 
for both alcohol use disorder and mood symptoms. At the end of study, patients will be given follow -up 
appointments at treatment facilities we have worked with in the past, and will be followed by [CONTACT_377002] 4 weeks (week 18 phone visit) to assure a smooth transition of care. If at any point in the study, including the follow -up phase, any participants develop a severe worsening of psychiatric symptoms that makes them a 
danger to themselves or others, they will be referred to the Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_376958]. If aftercare arrangements cannot be finalized prior to study completion 
then study physicians will continue to provide care until these arrangements are fully in place.
 These are our 
standard procedures for research studies and have been in place for over [ADDRESS_471681] developed an algorithm for the study (see below). 
STU102015- 062, Brown, FormA -Protocol, Mod_35, 05 -19-23  
Version #1, 12/14/15  
Page 9 of 17 Management begins with adjustment of the time of administration of study and concomitant medication (e.g. 
changing valproic acid from 750 mg BID to 500 qAM and 1000 mg qHS) and sleep hygiene instructions 
(Appendix A). This approach is common clinical practice in patients with bipolar disorder. If this does not improve sleep, then melatonin is added. If this approach is not successful, then trazodone is added.  Although trazodone is an  antidepressant in high doses, a review of the literature does not reveal evidence of either 
improvement in depressive symptoms or induction of manic symptoms at modest nighttime doses. The next step is the use of ramelteon (a prescription melatonin recept or agonist). If these approaches fail to control the 
insomnia, then the combination of ramelteon and trazodone will be allowed. It is also important to note that insomnia is frequently a transient side effect with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]. Data from large aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376959] 12% at week 1 to 5% at week 3 in patients who continued in the trials.
57 Thus, it may resolve in many cases without the use of concomitant medications.  
 
Insomnia Management Algorithm  
1) Adjustment of timing of administration of study drug and concomitant medications, current medications AND sleep hygiene instructions.  
2) Mela tonin  
a. Begin melatonin at 3mg po qHS —to be taken one to two hours prior to bedtime.  
b. If no significant improvement in insomnia, increase melatonin to 6mg po qHS —to be taken one 
to two hours prior to bedtime.  
c. If no significant improvement, discontinue melatonin and proceed to step #3.  
3) Trazodone  
a. Begin trazodone at 25mg po qHS —to be taken 30- 60 minutes prior to bedtime.  
b. If no significant improvement in insomnia, increase trazodone as tolerated to 50mg po qHS.  
c. If no significant improvement in insomnia, increase trazodone as tolerated to 100mg po qHS. 
d. If no significant improvement in insomnia, discontinue trazodone and proceed to step #4.  
4) Ramelteon  
a. Begin ramelteon at 8mg po qHS —to be taken 30 -60 minutes prior to bedtime.  
b. If no significant improvement, proceed to step 5.  
5) Combination therapy using ramelteon and trazodone.  
 Fatigue and disturbance in attention may both be related to the sedating properties of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]. It 
appears to be a medication that can cause restlessness and insomnia, as well as fatigue, sedat ion and 
somnolence. These daytime side effects of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376960] 1) timing of study drug dosing (qHS rather than morning), and 2) adjustments in timing of concomitant medications (e.g. greater proportion of total dose in early evening than in the morning).   
Finally, although not as common as the above side effects, nausea and vomiting are sometimes 
reported with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]. Nausea was uncommon in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (section 3.3.a) and in the aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376961]
[ADDRESS_471682] with a low- starting 
dose and the use of a slower dose titration when needed. If nausea is reported, the participants will be instructed to take the study drug with a meal (per package insert aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376962]).  
Please note that all side effect management will be conducted in a double- blind fashion. In all of the 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376963], side effects were also reported in the placebo group. Thus, the development of side effects does not necessarily suggest that the participant is taking aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253].      
In order to minimize the risks related to the use of placebo, we will schedule frequent appointments with 
a psychiatrist investigator and research coordinator. If participants have a worsening of symptoms, such as active suicidal ideation, study participation will be discontinued, and we will provide them with referrals for 
appropriate care.  
All investigators and research staff will be available [ADDRESS_471683] 
STU102015- 062, Brown, FormA -Protocol, Mod_35, 05 -19-23  
Version #1, 12/14/[ADDRESS_471684] extensive experience 
working with patients with bipolar disorder and substance use disorders. 
All women of childbearing potential (premenopausal and without a clearly documented hysterectomy, 
ovariectomy or bilateral tubal ligation) must have a urine pregnancy test with negative results prior to receiving 
study medication. These participants will also be asked to use effective forms of contraception during the study. Pregnancy or failure to use contraceptives will result in discontinuation from the study.  
Potential safety concerns will result in discontinuation from the study protocol. However, standard care 
will be provided until referral to another physician for further care can be arranged. The following conditions would require consideration of discontinuation from the study:  
• Change in diagnosis to other than bipolar I , II, or NOS disorder and AUD.  
• Development of active suicidal or homicidal ideation with plan and intent.  
• Worsening in mood symptoms, that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_376964].  
• Pregnancy.  
• Development of severe or life- threatening medical condition. 
• Involuntary psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_297568].  
• Significant alcohol withdrawal (e.g. delirium tremens) based on clinical judgment. Increases in CIWA -Ar 
scores will initiate a careful clinical assessment of possible worsening of withdrawal symptoms.  
 These are general guidelines. In all cases, physician judgment will be used to determine whether or not 
a participant can safely remain in the study. Some level of suicidal ideation is common in the participants we research. However, we want to take steps to prevent risk of suicidal acts. Thus, the emergence of intense suicidal thoughts with a clear plan (e.g. overdose) and the intent to  act on the plan would require 
discontinuation from the study. However, recurrent suicidal thoughts accompanied by a clear understanding that the participant does not plan to act on these thoughts would not require discontinuation.  
A breathalyzer will be used to assess whether or not the participant is currently intoxicated (defined in 
[LOCATION_007] as a blood alcohol level ≥0.08%). On rare occasions, patients in our alcohol treatment studies have arrived at our clinic intoxicated. We handle this on a case -by-case basis by [CONTACT_377003],   if necessary, later calling a friend to take 
them home. We do not allow participants to leave our clinic while intoxicated. If a patient insisted upon leaving the clinic while intox icated, we would call campus police.  
For participant safety and the internal validity of the study, concomitant medications for bipolar disorder 
will be managed in order to prevent discontinuation due to symptoms unrelated to the primary outcome of alcohol use, while providing consistency and structure to the medication management.  
The proposed study is placebo- controlled and in a group of patients with a major mental illness and substance 
abuse. Given the potentially vulnerable nature of the participants, in addition to the monitoring and review by [CONTACT_329724], we have implemented an additional data and safety monitoring plan that includes the formation of a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  
 
Adverse Events  
1) Exclusion criteria include active suicidal ideation, pregnant or nursing women, or prisoners to minimize risk 
to vulnerable populations or adverse events.  
2) All adverse events will be discussed with and evaluated by a physician investigator as soon as reported by [CONTACT_423].  
3) Adverse events will be appropriately reported to the IRB and DSMB.  The UT Southwestern IRB Policy it to 
only accept Adverse Events that are “Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) and  Definitely 
or Probably related and  Serious or otherwise suggests that the research places subjects or others at a 
greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  Serious adverse events meeting these criteria are to be individually reported within 
two business days to the IRB. We will report serious adverse events to the NIAAA within 24 hours and can also report these adverse events to the IRB within 48 hours rather than two business days.  We will report 
the adverse events that the IRB does not review to the DSMB for the study.  Unexpected, but not serious, 
adverse events  will be reported  within 5 working days of our being informed by [CONTACT_377004]. Nonserious, expected adverse events will be reported to the IR B and DSMB in 
periodic summary reports. As part of this reporting process, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_376965], its relationship to the study, and whether changes in the protocol are warranted. Adverse events will also be reported to NIAAA in annual progress reports.

Page 11 of 17 4)  We will also report all AEs occurring during the follow -up period to the NIAAA in an annual report and will 
report reportable AEs to the IRB. AEs will also be reviewed at DSMB meetings  
5) In addition to the IRB review of adverse events outlined above, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_376966]. When necessary, the IRB will be consulted for further guidance.  
6) The PI, co -investigators involved with clinical care and the research coordinators will be available [ADDRESS_471685] of Subroto Ghose, M.D., Ph.D. (chair), Marisa Toups, M.D. and Mary Ellen Bret, M.D.  
[CONTACT_377009] is Associate Professor of Psychiatry at UT Southwestern. He completed a psychi atry 
residency at Georgetown University Medical School and a fellowship in neuropathology at the National Institutes of Health. [CONTACT_377010] is Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at UT Southwestern. She works with the Department’s Depression Center and has a K  award focusing on biomarkers for depression from NIMH. [CONTACT_377011] completed a psychiatry residency at the University of [LOCATION_007] Medical School at Houston and a geriatric psychiatry fellowship at UT Southwestern. She is currently Associate Professor of Psychiatry at UT 
Southwestern and director of the Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_376967]. None of the proposed members is a co -investigator or consultant on the proposed grant or other grants by [CONTACT_978], and none currently serve on 
the UT Southwestern IRB. Thus, the board will provide an independent review and oversight mechanism for the study.  
As for the logistics of the proposed board, we propose that the members be unblinded so they can 
make a meaningful assessment of the data from both placebo and active medication groups. We currently 
have ongoing DSMBs for other NIH -funded clinical trials and have proposed a similar design for the proposed 
board. The board will meet immediately prior to the initiation of enrollment in the study, after 25, 50, [ADDRESS_471686] been enrolled, and at the end of the study. The study's biostatistician will present safety data to the board for review, including changes in psychiatric symptom severity and alcohol use/craving. The PI ([CONTACT_46792]) will attend the meeting at the beginning and end, but will not be present if any unblinded data are reviewed in order to preserve integrity of the blind. In addition, materials provided to the IRB, including serious adverse events (SAEs) leading to death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_376968]. The 
board will review preliminary data on adverse events and outcomes. If, based on this review, the board feels that protocol modifications are needed, it will have the authority to modify safety procedures and temporarily or permanently discontinue enrollment if needed. At each DSMB meeting a careful consideration of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_376969]. If the number of total SAEs in the aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376970] ≥ [ADDRESS_471687] will then provide written documentation and justification of a decision to continue or stop enrollment. This approach is based on the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_376971].
58 Because stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_376972], multisite trials, we 
modified the recommendations for a smaller study. Instead of using a predetermine significance, such as p < .001 to prompt consideration of discontinuation we use the value of three times greater than with placebo. We selected this approach because statistical significance might be virtually impossible to achieve with relatively uncommon, dichotomized events from relatively small numbers of participants.  Rather than attempting to 
categorize the SAEs, which would result in very small numbers in each category , we will use total SAEs to 
prompt review. At this point the DSMB can review specific types of SAEs and look for patterns. We will review the proposed procedures of the DSMB with the NIAAA program official and seek their guidance and approval prior to enrollment.    
 
12. Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality:  
Blood specimens will be provided to Quest Diagnostics for analysis, removing identifying information 
(e.g., name) that could be linked to the patient’s identity  prior to sending for analysis. The blood  provided to 
Quest will have the participant’s date of birth to correctly link the results to the participant. The results of this 
test will be de -identified and added to the rest of the de- identified data. Once de- identified, only the identified 
investigators can learn/discover the names of participant.

Page 12 of 17 Data Management Plan  
All data related to the participant’s participation in this study will be given a study ID which cannot be 
traced back to the patient except by [CONTACT_464].  All personal information which can identify the patient’s 
identity will be kept separately from study documents and assessments.  All clinical assessments will be 
collected in paper form and scores transferred to a computer database maintained on a password protected 
computer, on a secure server behind a firewall.  The paper forms will be kept in binders marked only with the patient’s study ID and will be kept in a locked room for the required time period following the completion of this 
study.   
 
A Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained for this study. 
 
13. Potential Benefits:   
Bipolar disorder is a severe, persistent, and common psychiatric illness that is associated with a 
staggering 46% lifetime prevalence of alcohol -related disorders, being associated with numerous adv erse 
consequences including increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], poor outcome during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], violence towards self 
and others, and treatment nonadherence. The atypi[INVESTIGATOR_376973] a particularly promising 
medication which may lead to the development of effective treatments for patients with bipolar and alcohol use 
disorder. This rare placebo- controlled trial in patients with bipolar disorder and alcohol use disorder may be an 
important step forward toward advancing the successful treatment of this patient population. Minimal data are 
available on the treatment of persons with BPD  and substance abuse. However, these illnesses occur together 
at high rates. Thus, the primary benefit of the study will be for persons with BPD  or schizoaffective disorder 
biplar typeand alcohol use disorder to determine whether aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376974]. There may, however, be some benefit to the subjects who participate in the study as they will receive 
a careful screening for mood sy mptoms as well as MM.  Approximately half of the subjects will receive an active 
medication that, in some cases, will likely improve their mood symptoms.  
The primary risks of this study are medication side effects and the risk of receiving inactive medicati on, 
though aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376927] a generally safe and a reasonably well -tolerated medication. We feel it is 
essential for this study that a placebo group be included as the efficacy of even standard medications in dual -
diagnosis patients is not well established. Thus, the benefits of the study are great and will include a better 
understanding of the treatment of bipolar disorder with comorbid alcohol use disorder.  This will be the first 
controlled study of this medication in patients with bipolar disorder and alcohol use disorder, and will provide valuable data on its efficacy in this population and the relationship between mood symptoms and drug use. Thus, we feel that the risks, though clearly present, are greatly outweighed by [CONTACT_377005].  
 
14. Biostatistics:   
Randomization:  A biostatistician will perform the randomization, and we will stratify based on baseline 
use of lithium vs.  anticonvulsant  (valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin)  as a mood stabilizer  and baseline 
drinks per drink ing day of ≥ 8 and < 8 (based on use patterns in our prior studies in this population) . In the 
event that a patient takes both lithium and an anticonvulsant, he or she will be stratified to the lithium group. 
Patients not taking a mood stabilizer will be stratified with the anti -convulsant group.  
Primary Aim:  Determine if aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376933]- on therapy is associated with a greater reduction in 
alcohol use than placebo therapy in outpatients with BPD  or Schizoaffective Disorder (bipolar type ) and alcohol 
use disorder.  
Participants completing baseline and at least one post -baseline assessment will be used in the analysis 
(ITT sample). In the spi[INVESTIGATOR_376975], data will be collected even on participants who miss assessments or discontinue medication but continue in the study. Data on participants who do not complete the study will be analyzed up to the point of study discontinuation.  A random regression that includes all data will be conducted with treatment group as the between- subjects factor; ti me as the within -subjects factor; and a group by [CONTACT_377006] (primary outcome), number of heavy drinking days, and number of drinking days, CDT, GGT, AST, and ALT (secondary outcomes) as the dependent variables. The m odel will 
allow for random slopes and intercepts while all other factors will be fixed effects. A secondary data analysis will be conducted using multiple imputation (MI) so the results from boanti th analyses can be compared. SAS Proc 
Mixed will be used. The need for additional covariates, transformations of variables, as well as goodness of fit of the final model, will be investigated. The following covariates will be considered: age, gender, type of  diagnosis , 
baseline BIS- 11 and GNG scores, baseline use of substances other than alcohol, presence of anxiety disorder, 
STU102015- 062, Brown, FormA -Protocol, Mod_35, 05 -19-23  
Version #1, 12/14/15  
Page 13 of 17 baseline use of psychotropic medications, and change in use of psychotropic medications. C ovariates will be 
included if they significantly improve the fit of the final model. An a priori alpha of 0.05 will be used for all other 
analyses. The influence of exit aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376976], secondary and exploratory aims will 
also be examined.  
Secondary Aim:  1) Determine if aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376933]- on therapy is associated with a greate r 
reduction in alcohol craving than placebo therapy in outpatients with BPD  or Schizoaffective Disorder (bipolar 
type) and AUD.  PACS scores will be compared between groups with an ITT sample and using a random 
regression as described above.  
Additional Exploratory Analyses:   
1) Determine if aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376933]- on therapy is associated with a greater reduction in manic and 
depressive symptoms than placebo therapy in outpatients with BPD or Schizoaffective Disorder (bipolar type ) 
and AUD.  Between -group dif ferences in YMRS, HRSD 17 and IDS -SR 30 scores will be compared using a 
random regression as above.  
2) Determine whether changes in alcohol craving and mood occur before or after changes in alcohol 
use with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253].  We will explore correlations between  baseline to exit changes in mood (e.g. HRSD 17) 
and alcohol use/craving assessments using a Pearson’s correlation coefficient in aripi[INVESTIGATOR_34824]. In addition, a panel model with lagged effects
59 will be used to analyze 12- week longitudinal data (SAS 
Proc Panel) in order to explore serial correlations between changes in alcohol use with mood and craving with lagged effect (e.g. one week, two week). Panel model will be constructed for each alcohol use, alcohol craving, depressive and manic symptom, and cognitive outcome, and test if change in alcohol use follows changes in craving, mood or cognition at subsequent visits and vice versa.  
3) Determine if impulsivity decreases with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376977].  BIS-11 and GNG  scores will 
be compared between groups as with the Primary Aim above. Correlations between BIS -11 scores and GNG  
scores, and alcohol use measures, as well as lagged effects will be compared as with Exploratory Aim 2 above.   
4) Assess rates of attrition, safety and tolerability of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_34770] e. Length of time in the study in weeks 
will be compared between groups using Cox proportional hazards regression. Scores on the PRD -III, AIMS, 
BAS and SAS will be compared between -groups as with the Primary Aim above.  
5) Examine genotype as a predictor of response to aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]. The purpose of this analysis is to 
identify whether genotype (e.g. 1438A polymorphism in the promoter region of the 5- HT2A receptor, LL 
compared with the LS/SS of the 5- HTTLPR promoter region of the 5 -HTT) is a moderator of trea tment effect. 
Treatment effect is determined by [CONTACT_1570], main effect and treatment group by [CONTACT_377007]. The potential moderator of genotype will be included in the random regression model for the primary outcome along with variable by [CONTACT_377008]. Significance for either interaction term would indicate that the variable is a moderator. 
 6) Explore safety, tolerability and efficacy of an increase in aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376978] [ADDRESS_471688], as appropriate. Scores on 
outcomes measures including alcohol use (e.g. heavy drinking days) and side effect scales (e.g. BAS) will be compared between groups at week 16 using analysis of covariance. Week 12 value of the outcome will be the 
covariate.  
7) Determine if inflammation decreases with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376979].  Analysis described for 
Exploratory Aim 3 (above) will be used with hs -CRP data to test this aim.  
Power analysis:  One potential guide to calculate effect size comes from a recent study comparing 
naltrexone alone and with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376980].[ADDRESS_471689] value of the quantity (placebo mean – aripi[INVESTIGATOR_376981]) / 
standard deviation that will produce a p -value of .009. This quantity (i.e. the effect size) is 0.841. This effect 
size would be classified as a large effect size which may not be reproducible in another sample with a different design and patient population. If we assume a medium effect size of 0.5, 80% power, a two -sided t -test, and 
STU102015- 062, Brown, FormA -Protocol, Mod_35, 05 -19-23  
Version #1, 12/14/15  
Page 14 of 17 alpha=.[ADDRESS_471690] 
completers, will be inclu ded in the analysis. However, we frequently see some attrition (approximately 3%) 
between baseline and the first post -baseline assessment, therefore, final sample size will be 132.

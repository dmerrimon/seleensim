Summary of Clarifications and Rationale  
 
This Clarification Memorandum (CM) updates protocol specifications to reflect current policies of the 
Division of AIDS (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and National 
Institutes of Health (NIH). It also updates the word ing related to the IMPAACT Network Certificate of 
Confidentiality and adds the protocol IND number . These updates do not impact the study design or 
study -specific procedures.  
 
 
Implementation  
 
This CM will be submitted to the Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board , which serves as 
the single Institutional Review Board (sIRB) for IMPAACT 2032 , for their information ; however , 
approval of this CM is not required by [CONTACT_876391] . Sites may submit this 
CM to their local  IRBs/ECs for their information or, if required by [CONTACT_876392]/ECs, for their approval 
prior to implementation.  
 
IRBs/ECs may have acknowledged and/or approved remote site monitoring strategies prior to the 
issuance of this CM. If so, sites should file  documentation of th is acknowledgement and/or approval in 
their essential document files for IMPAACT 20 32. This CM and any applicable IRB/EC correspondence 
should also be filed in  essential document files for IMPAACT [ADDRESS_1224114] current DAIDS policies for clinical site monitoring , which 
allow for on -site and remote monitoring. T he prior contents of this section are replaced with the 
following:  
 
Under contract to DAIDS or NICHD, site monitors will inspect study site facilities and review 
participant study records — including informed consent forms, paper -based CRFs (if used), 
eCRFs, medical records, laboratory records, and pharmacy records — to ensure protection of 
study participants, compliance with the  sIRB approved protocol, and accuracy and 
Clarification Memorandum # [ADDRESS_1224115] of, or in addition to , onsite visits to ensure 
the safety of study participants and data inte grity (1). Site investigators will make study 
documents available for site monitors to review utilizing a secure platform that is 21 CFR Part 
11 and HIPAA compliant. Potential platform options include: Veeva SiteVault, Medidata Rave 
Imaging Solution, Medid ata Remote Source Review, site -controlled SharePoint or cloud -based 
portal, and direct access to electronic medical records. Other secure platforms that are 21 CFR

 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Background  
 
As of November 23, 2020, Centers  for Disease Control  and Prevention ( CDC ) received 12,175,921 
COVID -19 case reports for the [LOCATION_002] ( U)S since January 22, 2020. There were slightly more 
women (52%) than men (48%) included in these reports  (1). The most recent tracking data from CDC 
includes 39,857  case reports  of US pregnant women with COVID -19 received between January 22 and 
November 23, 2020, with 53 deaths and 8,284  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], although the se data did not distinguis h 
between hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53763] -19 conditions from admissions for pregnancy -related indications, 
such as delivery. The ra ce/ethnicity breakdown of the pregnancy COVID -19 cases was 37% Hispanic, 
35% White Non -Hispanic, 19% Black Non -Hispanic, 3%, Asian and 6% Multiple/Other  (2). In an earlier 
MMWR publication describing the p eriod between January 22 and June 7, 2020, CDC reported receiving 
notifications of 326,335 women of reproductive age (15 –44 years) with positive SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1224181] 
results. Of the 91,412 of these women with pregnancy data, 9% (8,207) were pregnant. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_876366] 31.5% of pregnant women compared to 5.8% of nonpregnant women but the data did not 
distinguish between hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53763] -19 conditions from admissions for pregnancy -related 
indications, such as delivery. After adjusting for ag e, presence of underlying medical conditions, and 
race/ethnicity, pregnant women were significantly more likely to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (aRR = 5.4, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 5.1 -5.6), to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (aRR = 1.5, 95% CI =  
1.2–1.8) and to receive mechanical ventilation (aRR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2 –2.4) than nonpregnant women  
(3). Increased need for intensive care during pregnancy has also been reported in Swedish women with 
COVID -19 (4). A review of published data on severe  coronavirus infections in pregnancy reported 
adverse pregnancy outcomes, including maternal death, preterm delivery, stillbirth and neonatal death, as 
well as respi[INVESTIGATOR_876367], in pregnant women with 
COV ID-19, although at lower frequency than with MERS -CoV and SARS -CoV -1 (5).   
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_876368] -19 in pregnant women associated with adverse 
pregnancy and maternal health outcomes, pregnant women are routinely excluded from participation in 
research protocols within COVID -19 drug development programs (6). The physiological changes 
associated with pregnancy can have a dramatic impact on drug disposition and use of therapeutic agents 
during pregnancy poses unique safety concerns (6). As a result, drugs cannot be used safely and 
effectively during pregnancy without their pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety being evaluated in pregnant 
women.  Only a few of the many COVID -19 clinical treatment trials currently listed on clinicaltrials.gov 
include pregnant women (7). Those that do involved use of hydroxychloroquine , which has been used 
extensively in pregnant women for malaria treatment but is no longer recommended for routine use in 
treatment of COVID -19 due to a lack of proven efficacy in the presence of significant risk of major 
toxicity (8). 
 
Remdesivir  (GS-5734TM) (RDV), a nucleotide prodrug originally developed for the treatment of Ebola 
virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is the first drug licensed for use against  COVID -19, the 
disease caused by [CONTACT_30096] -CoV -2 virus (9). RDV has been shown to shorten time to recovery 
from severe COVID -19 (10-12). In an activation process analogous to that of tenofovir alafenamide 
(TAF)  and sofosbuvir  (SOF) , RDV  is metabolized to an intracellular nucleotide triphosphate which 
inhibits viral RNA polymerases. Now that RDV is licensed , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_876369] -
19 can receive RDV  part of clinical care ; however,  since all RDV  research protocols exclude d pregnant 
women  there are no RDV pregnancy PK data and only limited RDV  in pregnancy  safety data from 
observational cohorts (13). 
 
The routine exclusion of pregnant women from drug development programs results in therapeutic agents 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_876370] -pregnant adults in the absence of pregnancy specific PK and safety 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.[ADDRESS_1224182] its use in pregna ncy 
were issued, during which time cobicistat was used routinely as part of clinical care for pregnant women 
living with HIV (6). A similar delay in the availability of pregnancy PK and safety data for drugs shown to 
be effective against COVID -[ADDRESS_1224183] drug with preliminary evidence of efficacy in COVID -19(14). RDV  is a prodrug that 
requires several steps of metabolism to generate its active intracellular nucleo tide triphosphate (NTP, GS -
443902), following a similar activation sequence as SOF (Figure 2). RDV is a monophosph oramid ate 
prodrug of an adenosine analog that is made 
more lipophilic by [CONTACT_876396] -alanine 
and phenyl phosphate esters. RDV  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_876371] a  
nucleoside analog  monophosphate . Inside cells  
the nucleoside analog mono phosphate is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_876372] (GS -
443902), which competes with natural  
adenosine triphosphate  (ATP) to selectively 
inhibit RNA -dependent RNA polymerase. 
Dephosphorylation of the nucleoside analog 
results in GS -441524, which  is not as efficiently 
rephosphorylated  as RDV . 
 
The in vitro EC50 against SARS -CoV -2 has 
been reported at 0.137 µM (83 ng/mL) and 0.77 µM (460 ng/mL ) in Vero cells (11, 15). In a human lung 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_114239] (Calu3), in vitro EC50s for RDV and GS -441524 were 0.28 uM (169 ng/mL),and 0.62 
uM (181 ng/m L) by [CONTACT_95288]. RDV demonstrated greater potency in human airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_876373]50 of 0.01 uM (6 ng/mL), likely due 
to higher GS -[ADDRESS_1224184] Ebola (16). See Table 1 
below for summary plasma PK parameters.  In 
this study, Day 1 peak plasma concentrations 
after a 200 mg intravenous (IV) dose 
administered over 30 minutes were 9.0 µM 
(5440 ng/mL) for RDV  and 0.5 µM (152 
ng/mL) for GS -441524. AUC 0-24h were 4. 8 µM-h (2920 ng*h/mL) for RDV  and 7.7 µM -h (2240 
ng*h/mL) for GS -441524  (15). Sparse PK results in a [ADDRESS_1224185] also been detailed (17). Median peak RDV concentrations of 4.54 uM (2737 ng/mL) and Figure 3: Expected PK of Remdesivir and GS -[ADDRESS_1224186] of pregnancy  Figure 2: Remdesivir and sofosbuvir  structure.

 5.50 uM (3317 ng/mL) were measured in each of these patients, respect ively, on infusion Days 3 -9. GS -
441524 AUC 0-24h was 10.7 uM -h (3117 ng*h/mL) in the male patient, and 21.1 uM -h (6131 ng*h/mL) in 
the female patient, who had 1.[ADDRESS_1224187] under 1 hour. Following single doses ranging from 3 – 225 mg IV, PK of GS -441524 were linear.  
GS-441524 reaches steady -state in 4 days and accumulated 1.9 -fold based on AUC, cons istent with its 
~24-hour half-life. The intracellular phosphorylated metabolite GS -443902 has a median half-life of 
32.23 to 48.38 hours. Renal and biliary excretion were the major routes of elimination in rats and 
monkeys. (15) In the mass balance study, mean total recover y of the dose was greater than 92%, 
consisting of approximately 74% recovered in urine and 18% recovered in feces . The majority of the IV 
RDV  dose recovered in urine  was the GS -441524 metabolite  (49%) followed by [CONTACT_876397]  (10%) and other 
metabolites (18). The impact of pregnancy on hydrolase activity and RDV  PK is unknown. A simulation 
from modelling based on pregnancy PK data for other renally eliminated drugs is presented in Figure 3 
(19-22). The modelling and simulation suggest that increased  glom erular filtration rate  (GFR ) and renal 
tubular secretion associated with pregnancy will increase GS-441524 elimination.  Because RDV is 88 -
94% prot ein bound, while its metabolites are only 1 -2% protein bound  (9), pregnancy related changes in 
plasma protein concentrations  due to volume expansion and drug displacement from protein binding sites 
may also affect unbound RDV concentrations.

RDV  is currently licensed for use in adults and pediatric patients ([ADDRESS_1224188] 40 kg) for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (9). 
The only RDV  PK data currently available are from  healthy non -pregnant adult volunteers , for which 
resul ts by [CONTACT_876398], and sparse PK results from two patients with COVID -19(9, 16, 17). No 
data describing RDV PK  in pregnant women or non -pregnant women with COVID -19 are available. 
Clinical data with RDV use in pregnancy are limited to the experience of 6 pregnant women in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo who received RDV  as Ebola treatment  and 67 pregnant and 19 
postpartum women who received remdesivir for COVID -19 under the [COMPANY_009] compassionate use 
protocol (13, 23). Remdesivir was well tolerated by [CONTACT_876399] (23).  The 
pregnant and po stpartum women who received RDV for COVID -19 under the [COMPANY_009] compassionate use 
protocol all had room air oxygen saturation 94% or lower. There was one spontaneous miscarriage and 
one postpartum women who died but no pregnant woman or live born infant died . None of the pregnant 
women developed gestational hypertension or pre -eclampsia. Ninety three percent of pregnant women 
and 89% of postpartum women recovered from COVID -19.  Serious adverse events  (SAEs)  were 
observed in 29% of women, including deep vein thrombosis, hypertension, hypoxia and pleural effusion.

concomitant medications (see Section  5.3). 
 
4.[ADDRESS_1224197] ensure that  information about the 
study is provided to the potential participant or her LAR (as applicable)  including detailed review 
of the study informed consent form, time to address any questions or concerns the potential 
participant or LAR may have , and an assessment of unde rstanding, before proceeding to informed 
consent  decision . Refer to Section 13.[ADDRESS_1224198] be completed prior to en rollment . Screening evaluations may be performed up to and on the 
day of enrollment ; however,  all required screening outcomes  must be available prior t o 
enrollment.  
 
Each site must establish SOPs for eligibility determination that describe where and when 
screening procedures will be performed; roles and responsibilities for performing the required 
procedures; roles and responsibilities for assessing and  confirming eligibility; and procedures for 
documenting the process, taking into consideration the required timing of entry .  
 
Prior to enrollment, and after informed consent is obtained, sites will assign a participant 
identification number (PID) to the p articipant . The IMPAACT Data Management Center (DMC) 
Subject Enrollment System (SES) will be used to enroll participants in this study . For women  
found to be eligible, enrollment will occur upon successful entry of required eligibility data into 
the SES. Successful entry into the SES will generate a study identification number (SID ), for each 
enrolled participant . Refer to Section 9.5 for more information on monitoring participant accrual 
in this study.   
 
For Arm 1, only maternal participants will be enrolled in the study; fetuses /infants  will not be 
enrolled. However,  as some limited data will be collected on infant outcomes at birth as well as 
newborn physical exam findings , participants will be asked to  provide consent for data collection 
on their infants , as described in the sample consent forms in Appendix II. PI[INVESTIGATOR_876376] .

may voluntarily withdraw  from the study. Participants may also be discontinu ed from study  
participation  by [CONTACT_439447] : 
 
• Investigator or designee determines that continued participation in the study would be unsafe 
or otherwi se not in the best interest of the participant, after consultation with the  Clinical 
Management Committee ( CMC). 
• The study is stopped or canceled by [CONTACT_421570], government or regulatory authorities, or the 
sIRB .  
• Site participation in the study is cancelled by [CONTACT_421570], government or regulatory 
authorities,  or the sIR B.  
• The participant does not initiate RDV  within 7 days from study entry .   
 
For any participant who withdraws  or is discontinued  from the study prior to scheduled 
completion of follow -up, study staff will document the reason for the withdrawal or 
discontinuation  in detail  and enter the reason into  the appropriate eCRF . No final evaluations are 
required in the case of early study dis continuation or withdrawal .  
 
 
 DRUG UNDER STUDY   
 
No study  drug is provided as a part of this study.  The drug being evaluated in this study  is 
remdesivir ( RDV ) (GS-5734TM) and is referred to as the “drug under study .” RDV will not be 
supplied as part of this study. RDV is approved by [CONTACT_876404][INVESTIGATOR_876378] .   
 
The RDV Prescribing Information is   available  at:  
https://www.gilead.com/ -/media/files/pdfs/medicines/covid -19/veklury/veklury_pi.pdf  
 
5.1 Remdesivir Formulations  
 
RDV is available in two different formulations: lyophilized powder for reconstitution (100 mg) 
and premixed injection solution 5mg/mL  (100 mg) . RDV should be stored consistent with details 
as provided by [CONTACT_11339] -study sources who supply the drug to the par ticipants.  The formulation 
administered to each participant at each infusion will be captured on eCRFs as described in 
Section  6.4. 
 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.[ADDRESS_1224199]  dosage of RDV is a single loading dose of 200 mg infused 
intravenously over 30 to 120 minutes on Day 1 followed by [CONTACT_8206] -daily maintenance doses of 100 
mg infused intravenously over 30 to 120 minutes for up to 10 infusions  (30 minute  infusion 
administration  is recommende d where possible) . Based on the prescribing information, it is 
expected that participants who do  not require  invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) will receive a 5 -day course of treatment , and participants 
requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO will receive a 10 -day course of treatment ; 
however, treatment may be discontinued early in either case  as determined by [CONTACT_30780].  After an infusion is complete , at least 30 mL of 0.9% saline will be use d to flush the 
line. The prepared diluted solution will not be administered with any other medications. The 
compatibility of RDV  injection with IV solutions and medications other than saline is not known.  
The dose  and volume  administered to each participant at each infusion will be captured on eCRFs 
as described in Section  6.4. 
 
5.3 Concomitant Medications  
 
The term concomitant medications refers to medications (prescription and non -prescription  as 
well as other investigational agents ) other than RDV received by [CONTACT_193134]. All 
concomi tant medications must be source documented ; a subset of concomitant medications will 
be entered into eCRFs as part of the medical and medication histories obtained at data collection 
timepoints as described in  Section  6. 
 
RDV is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_876379] a nucleotide monophosphate, which can be further 
phosphorylated to the active triphosphate form, or dephosphorylated to GS -441524. GS -[ADDRESS_1224200] the PK of other medications. However, RDV is a substrate 
for P -glycoprotein and OATP1B1 and its transport  may be affected by  [CONTACT_876405]. PK results will be carefully evaluated in relation to concomitant medications  
during data analysis .  
 
5.4 Disallowed Medications at Entry  
 
Due to potential interactions with RDV or the formation of its active trip hosphate metabolite, GS -
443902 , the following medications are exclusionary if taken or administered within 48 hours prior 
to entry:  carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, 
phenytoin, rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, ritonavir, St. John’s wort.

 Intensive PK Sampling  and Optional Breast Milk Sampling  
 
Intensive  PK samples will be collected around  either the 3rd, 4th, or 5th infusion. Sites may choose 
which infusion is most convenient for collection of the intensive  PK samples. Intensive PK 
sample collection must be co mpleted within a single dosing interval (i.e., specific timepoints  may 
not be spread over different infusions). Intensive PK timepoints are shown in Table [ADDRESS_1224216], an intravenous catheter will be placed in an arm vein for serial blood 
collection. Plasma will be stored at each timepoint; additionally, PBMC and DBS will be isolated 
and stored from these samples at the pre-dose and 23-hour post -end of infusion (EOI) timepoint s 
to assess intracellular concentrations of GS -443902 . Additional blood  volume   will be collected at 
the pre -dose sample to assess the protein binding capacity of RDV , and will be processed 
separately from  the intensive PK plasma samples (see LPC) . Plasma will also be isolated from the 
pre-dose sample for quantification of α1 -acid glycoprotein (AAG).  
 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.[ADDRESS_1224217]  milk 
sample will  be collected once  on the intensive PK day, at either the EOI, 0.75 -hour,  1.5-hour,  3-
hour,  or 5-hour EOI PK timepoint  (at site discretion).  Breast milk must be collected within [ADDRESS_1224218] milk sample (e.g., breast pump not permitted 
in participant room due to infection control measures, participant too sick to express milk), 
collection of this sample may be omitted . The date and time of breast milk sample collection will 
be source documented and entered into eCRFs. See the LPC for processing instructions.  
 
A study  staff member must be  physically present for each PK sample collection timepoint ; 
samples within each b lock may be collected  either by  a non -study clinical care provider under the 
supervision of the study staff, or by a study staff member  (see Section 6.4.3 ). Due to the unique 
processing requirements of the specimens ( see the LPC ), PK sample collection has been 
organized into 4 suggested  sample collection “blocks” which do not exceed [ADDRESS_1224219] 2032 study staff member is responsible for batch transporti ng specimens to the 
processing lab  at the end of each block. Samples may be transported to the processing lab more 
frequently  than at the end of each block if time, resources and infection control measures permit, 
as long as a study staff member is able to  supervise  PK sample collection at each timepoint.

that day. Single PK specimens are also subject to the unique PK specimen processing 
requirements ( see the LPC ). See the LPC for additional instruction . The date and time of PK 
sample collection  will also be source documented and entered into e CRFs.  
 
 PK Sampling Supervision by [CONTACT_50847] [ADDRESS_1224221] process for interacting with and supervising the non -study clinical care 
providers for successful completion of PK sampling.  
 
6.5 Safety Follow -up Period  (48-Hour, 7-Day and [ADDRESS_1224222] Inf usion)  
 
The Safety  Follow -up period begins from the first day after the  last RDV  infusion and continues 
for [ADDRESS_1224223] infusion may be the 5th infusion, or may be an 
infusion earlier (if RDV was discontinued by [CONTACT_1963]) , or an infusion between [ADDRESS_1224224] 
infusion .   
 
This period  is divided into three data collection timepoints : 48-Hour, 7-Day, and [ADDRESS_1224225] Infusion . In addition to chart abstraction, telemedicine visits  may be used to obtain  and/or 
supplement or clarify  medical history information  after the participant has  been discharged from 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. At each data collection timepoint , a data lookback will take place  beginning  from the 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.[ADDRESS_1224226] day after the end  of the prior data collection timepoint  until the current data collection 
timepoint;  only the data elements spe cified in Table [ADDRESS_1224227] infusion  data collection is complete. For Arm 1 participants, who deliver after the 
Safety Follow -up period, study participation will end after delivery data collection  period is 
complete .  
 
NOTE: For Arm 1 participant i f delivery falls within the Safety Follow -up period, data for both 
periods should stil l be collected  and reported . If there is a gap in time between the Safety Follow -
up and Delivery periods, no data are to be collected during that time unless specified in Table 6.

6.6 Delivery  Period  (Arm 1)  
 
The Delivery period is for Arm 1 women only. The Delivery  period is defined as  from onset of 
labor or start of Cesarean section  through 24 hours after delivery . In the Delive ry period, 
procedures include collection of c linical and laboratory data per Table 6 for the mother and 
infant ; as well as PK sampling for the subset of participants who have received a RDV infusion 
within [ADDRESS_1224235] ete. If 
delivery falls within the Safety Follow -up period, data collection should be collected for both 
periods , and study participation will conclude and participants will be taken off study after the 
Safety Follow -up period data collection is complete.

further PK sampling done. These women will be followed for safety and clinical outcomes 
throughout the duration of the study follow -up period, and clinical and laboratory data will 
continue to be collected as indicated in the SOE.  
 
6.8 Additional Considerations for Laboratory Procedures  
 
Each study site and laboratory involved in this study will comply with the DAIDS policy on 
Requirements for DAIDS Funded and/or Sponsored Laboratories in Clinical Trials Policy, which 
is available at:  
https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/daids -clinical -research -policies -standard -procedures  
 
 Specimen Collection  
 
Specimens will be collected for this study as indicated in the SOE and per detailed guidance 
provided in the  LPC, which will be available on the study -specific webpage at : 
http://impaactnetwork.org/studies/IMPAACT _2032 .asp. 
 
In accordance with NIH recommendations,  for participants 18 years of age or older,  adult blood 
collection will not exceed 10.5 mL/kg or 550 mL, whichever is smaller, over any eight -week 
period . For participants less than 18 years of age,  pediatric blood collection will not e xceed 5 
mL/kg in a single day or 9.5 mL/kg in any eight -week period.   
 
Site investigators should review the participant chart to ensure that blood volume limits have not 
been exceeded prior to PK sampling. If limits will be reached , PK sampling should not be done or 
should be limited . In the event that blood collection must be limited, available specimens should 
be prioritized for use in the following order: (1) plasma for PK, (2) DBS for PK, (3) PBMC for 
PK. In this event, the CMC should also be notified a nd may provide guidance.   
 
 Specimen Prep aration, Testing, Storage, and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_876385]: blood samples  must be kept  
on ice before processing, a precisely measured proportion of stabilizing agent  must be added  to 
the specimens during plasma separation , and processed plasma samples  must be frozen  at -70 
degrees Celsius  or colder within 4 hours of specimen collection . All specimens collected for this 
study will be labeled, transported, processed, tested, stored , and/or shipped in accordance with the 
DAIDS policy referenced in Section  6.8, site and local laboratory SOPs, and the LPC.  The 
frequency of specimen collection will be directed by [CONTACT_576505] . Plasma, DBS, and PBMC 
specimens will be stored on -site and shipped for batch testing, according to the schedule listed in 
the LPC.  Refer to the LPC  for additional instruction related to PK specimens  shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] . The 
Laboratory Data Management System (LDMS) will be used to document specimen collection, 
testing, storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_421544].

with contaminated needles, blood, and blood products.  Appropriate respi[INVESTIGATOR_696],  blood, and 
secretion precautions will be employed by [CONTACT_876408][INVESTIGATOR_876386], as currently recommended by [CONTACT_876409], the World Health Organization ( WHO ) internationally and the NIH. 
The current  CDC guidelines for SARS -CoV -2 specimen collection and handling are available: 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/lab/resources.html .  
 
All specimens will be shipped using packaging that meets requirements specified by [CONTACT_876410] t Association Dangerous Goods Regulations for  United Nations  (UN) 
3373, Biological Substance, Category B, and Packing Instruction 650.  If samples are processed 
through an intermediate location, central lab or other, should agai n decontaminate the outside o f 
the Styrofoam shipment container prior to shipment to lab.  Samples from this study must be 
shipped separately from any other studies. No sharing of a single container for multiple studies.  
 
 
 SAFETY ASSESSMENT , MONITORING,  AND REPORTING  
 
Participant safety will be carefully assessed, monitored, and reported at multiple levels 
throughout this study. Section [ADDRESS_1224241] Study 
Monitoring Committee (SMC)  are briefly referenced in Section 7.[ADDRESS_1224242] 2032 is an opportunistic study  and RDV is not provided as part of this study ; it is 
expected that site investigators will not be the treating physicians  of COVID -19 infected patients 
receiving RDV.  The treating physician has primary respo nsibility for RDV clinical management 
and toxicity monitoring . It is expected that RDV will be provided, administered, and managed by 
[CONTACT_3038]’ non -study treating  physician consistent with the prescribing information for 
RDV.

7.3 Expedited Adverse Event (EAE) Reporting  
 
 EAE Reporting to DAIDS  
 
Requirements, definitions and methods for expedited reporting of adverse events are outlined in 
Version 2.0 of the DAIDS EAE Manual, which is available at:  
https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/manual -expedited -reporting -adverse -events -daids  
 
The DAIDS Adverse Experience Reporting System (DAERS), an internet -based reporting 
system, must be used for EAE reporting to DAIDS. In the event of system outages or technical 
difficulties, EAEs may be submitted using the DAIDS EAE Form. This form is avail able at:  
https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/paper -eae-reporting.  
 
For questions about DAERS, please contact [CONTACT_50787]: 
[EMAIL_946]  
 
Queries may also be sent from within the DAERS application itself.  
 
For questions a bout expedited reporting, please contact [CONTACT_163409]: 
DAIDSRSCSafetyOffice@tech -res.com  
 
 EAE Reporting Requirements for this Study  
 
The SAE  Reporting Category, as defined in Version 2.0 of the DAIDS EAE Manual, will be used 
for this study.  
 
Expedited reporting will be required for remdesivir (RDV) , the drug under study .  
 
In addition to the SAE  Reporting Category identified above, any fetal l oss under [ADDRESS_1224257] be reported in an 
expedited manner (i.e., as an EAE).  
 
 Grading the Severity of Events (applies to EAEs and all other adverse events)  
 
Adverse events will be graded , initially by [CONTACT_876412] 2032 site investigator as described in 
Section 8, according to the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of  Adult and 
Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table), Corrected Version 2.1, dated July 2017, 
which is available on the RSC website at:  
https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/daids -adverse -event -grading -tables  
 
For participants who are e ntering the study during pregnancy  (Arm 1), creatinine and creatinine 
clearance will be graded based on absolute values only and not change from baseline.  
 
Note: The DAIDS AE Grading Table Parameter for unintentional weight loss excludes 
postpartum weight  loss. Therefore, maternal weight loss  after delivery in Arm [ADDRESS_1224258] RDV infusion administration and ends 
when the participant complete s all study follow -up. This includes any gap in time between the 
end of the Safety Follow -up Period and Delivery for women in Arm 1  -- EAEs should be reported 
for this ti me period if the site becomes aware of them .  
 
After the protocol -defined EAE reporting period, unless otherwise noted, only suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reactions ( S[LOCATION_003]Rs ) as defined in Version 2.0 of the DAIDS EAE 
Manual will be reported to DAIDS  if the study staff become aware of the events on a passive 
basis (from publicly available information).   
 
 PARTICIPANT MANAGEMENT  
 
No study  drug is provided as a part of this study.  As such, all clinical management and toxicity 
monitoring of participants r eceiving RDV will be the responsibility of the non-study treating 
physician.   
 
All adverse events identified in this study will be source documented in participant  research 
records, consistent with the policies and pro cedures referenced in Section 11. Among other 
details, source documentation will include the severity of each event (graded as described in 
Section  7.3.3 ). Relationship assessments will  be made initia lly by [CONTACT_876413] 2032  site 
investigator with guidance, as is feasible, from the treating physician.  If relationship assessment is 
not able to be made by [CONTACT_6962], the attribution should be marked as “unknown.” The 
CMC will review and confirm  all classifications ; in cases where relationship was marked as 
“unknown,” the CMC will be responsible for classifying the event  if possible . Where there is 
discordant assessment between the IMPAACT 2032 site investigator and the CMC, the site will 
be quer ied for more information. Ultimately, the CMC classification will be used for data 
analysis. Relationship  assessments  will be  according to the following categories  and definitions:  
 
Related  There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may be related to  RDV  
Not related  There is not a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may be related to  
RDV  
 
Further standardized guidance on determining whether there is a reasonable possibility of a 
relationship is available in the DAIDS EAE Manual, referenced in Section 7.[ADDRESS_1224259] be followed  to resolution 
(return to baseline) or stabilization , while the participant is on study.  
 
With respect to IMPAACT [ADDRESS_1224260]  infusion; Arm 1 women who are still pregnant at that time will continue to be followed 
for safety at delivery.  
 
The target sample size is 20 PK -evaluable women for each arm. A participant’s PK data will be 
deemed unevaluable  by a protocol pharmacologist for a specific analysis if they do not have 
adequate PK evaluations to determine the PK parameter of interest for that analysis (see Section s 
9.6 and 10.2 for details). If a participant is deemed unevaluable for PK , the CMC will determine 
how to proceed with replacement . All women who receive any amount of RDV after enrollment 
will be evaluable for the safety analyses.  
   
The primary objectives are  to describe  the pharmacokinetics of RDV and its metabolite, GS -
441524, after administration to pregnant women as part of clinical care and to describe clinical 
and laboratory safety outcomes  in pregnant women receiving RDV as part of clinical care . The 
secondary objectives are to describe  the pharmacokinetics  of RDV and its metabolite, GS -
441524, after administration to non -pregnant women of childbearing potential  as part of clinical 
care, and to describe clinical and laboratory safety outcomes  in non -pregnant women receiving 
RDV as part of c linical care . Other objectives are  to describe placental transfer with collection of 
plasma and cord blood samples at delivery in mothers who have received RDV within the 
preceding  5 days , to compare the pharmacokinetics of RDV and its metabolite, GS -[ZIP_CODE] 4, in 
pregnant women to those observed in non -pregnant women of childbearing potential , to describe 
and compare intracellular concentrations of RDV’s active intracellular nucleotide triphosphate 
(GS-443902 ) in pregnant and non -pregnant women, to develop a PopPK model of RDV and its 
metabolites in pregnant and non -pregnant women  and evaluate associations between clinical 
characteristics and RDV and GS -[ADDRESS_1224261] adult doses of RDV. A preliminary analysis approach  for this 
study is to assess if  drug exposure during pregnancy  is within 30% of the PK outcome measure (s) 
for a comparison population of  non-pregnant  adults , including healthy non-COVID -19 infected  
adults  (see Table 1 in Section 1.2) as well as adults with COVID -19 and non-pregnant women 
enrolled in Arm 2 of this study . Additional analyses to assess adequacy of dosing during 
pregnancy will be performed as more information on the PK and pharmacodynamics of RDV in 
adults with COVID -19 becomes available , including data from Arm 2 (non -pregnant women) of 
this study . The statistical analysis plan (SAP)  will be updated  as more data become available.  
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.[ADDRESS_1224262] that the results 
of this study may not generalize to the full population of women who start RDV will be discussed 
as a limitation of the study in presentations and publications of results.  
 
The Primary Completion Date (PCD) for this study will be the date on which data collection is 
complete for all the primary outcome measures, i.e., the last study visit. The primary d ata 
analyses will be performed after study completion.  
 
9.2 Outcome Measures  
 
Note:  The numbering of the outcome measures in this section corresponds to the numbering of 
the objectives in  Section 2. 
 
Primary and secondary outcome measures listed below  in Table 7 will be addressed in the study’s 
primary SAP, which will define the conten t of the Primary Analysis Report. This report will form 
the basis for the primary manuscript and results reporting to ClinicalTrials.gov. Outcomes of

9.4 Sample Size and Accrual  
 
 Sample Size  
 
As noted in  Section 9.1, the target number of participants in each a rm is 20  PK-evaluable women . 
This target was selected based on sample size calculations (below) regarding the ability of the 
study to indicate whether or not t he PK outcome measures in pregnant women are within 30% of 
the PK outcome measures for non-pregna nt comparison populations . We also calculated the 
precision provided for estimating the risk of adverse events  and the probability of observing zero 
events and of observing 1 -10 event(s) . As described in more detail in Section 9.5.[ADDRESS_1224271] at specified timepoints as well as d escriptive statistics of safety outcomes.  
 
To determine an appropriate sample size  for the PK primary objective , we considered the 
precision for estimating the PK parameter with different target sample sizes, as measured by [CONTACT_876414] (CI) expressed as a percentage of the mean value . CI 
were calculated using the modified Cox approach (24). Currently, there is limited  PK data 
available for RDV in huma ns(15, 16). As was shown in Table 1, coefficient of variation (CV) 
estimates for RDV and GS -441524 AUCs  and C max range from 12.7% to 30.3% (i.e., 0.127 to 
0.303), based on data from 8 healthy adult  non-pregnant volunteers (15). Because the  protocol 
team e xpects study participants  will have a wide r range in age, disease severity, and stage of 
pregnancy (for Arm 1), resulting in a  higher variability than the available data,  we describe the 
precision with an assumed CV of 0.2, 0.3, or 0.4.   
 
Table 8 below illustrate s the upper and lower confidence limits  and width of the 90% CI for the 
mean PK parameter (e.g., AUC, T1/2, or Ctrough), express ed as a percentage of the mean, for 
different N and CV. With a sample size of 20 evaluable women and a CV equal to 0.3, the 90% 
CI will range from 89 – 112.3% of the mean, and the corresponding CI width will be 23.3% of 
the mean.  This relatively narrow CI would provide a very good indication of whether or not our 
data suggest  a greater than 30%  difference  from the PK parameter in non-pregnant comparison 
populations .

Because a n important objective , if feasible,  is to compare PK parameters  between Arm 1 and 
Arm 2 , we also calculated the power to achieve this objective, namely correctly detecting whether 
or not the PK parameter during pregnancy is more than 30% different from the PK parameter in 
non-pregnant women. We used an equivalence framework; i.e., we used PASS 15 to calculate the 
power to conclude that the 90% CI for the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of the PK parameter is 
within 0.7 to 1.43  (25).  
 
Table 9 below presents the power to conclude that the PK parameter in study pregnant women is 
not more than 30% differen t than the PK parameter in  non-pregnant women  (i.e.: the 90% CI of 
the GMR is within 0.7 to 1.43)  under the assumption that the geometric means of the PK 
parameter are the same (GMR = 1.0) or the geometric mean of pregnant women is 10% less than 
the geometric mean of non -pregnant w omen (GMR = 0.9). For a GMR = 0.9, t he power to 
conclud e that there is evidence that the PK parameters are not more than 30% different  for N = 20 
in both arms is 0.99, 0.84, or 0.63 with CVs=0.[ADDRESS_1224272] 2 0 evaluable women in each arm is necessary to provide a power above 63% if the CV is 
0.4 or less. With a sample size of 20 evaluable pregnant women and only 10 evaluable non -
pregnant women, the probability would still be above 68% if the CV is 0.3 or less but only 42% if 
the CV is 0.4.

For the safety primary objective, w e calculated  the precision for potential proportions of 
participants experiencing Grade [ADDRESS_1224273] binomial (Clopper -Pearson) 95% upper and lower confidence 
limits . With a sample size of 20 evaluable women  and an observed adverse event rate of 20% , the 
95% CI will range from 6% – 44%.

  Accrual  
 
Each arm will open to accrual independently and will accrue independently over approximately [ADDRESS_1224276] enrollment in each arm . If it take s longer to reach the accrual target for Arm 
2 (non -pregnant women) than for Arm 1 (pregnant women) , the protocol team may decide to 
close accrual to Arm [ADDRESS_1224277] 
completed their study follow -up, s ince the study primary objectives only involve Arm 1 women 
and do not involve Arm 2 women .   
 
The initial enrollment limit will be 25 in each arm, based on an anticipated 20% unevaluable . The 
determination of evaluable participants is done by [CONTACT_604856]  (see Section 
10.2). The CMC may increase the enrollment limit in either arm to achieve the target number of 
20 PK -evaluable women. Changes to the enrollment limit will be implemented in the Statistical 
and Data  Management Center ’s (SDMC) enrollment system and sites will be notified and 
instructed via email . The IMPAACT Management Oversight Group ( MOG ) will also be notified.  
 
Refer to Section 9.5.[ADDRESS_1224278] procedures.  Detailed plans for s tudy monitoring will be outlined in a Study Progress, 
Data, and Safety Monitoring Plan (SPDSMP) developed by [CONTACT_876415] . Sections [ADDRESS_1224279] (e.g., data and specimen completeness) based on reports generated by [CONTACT_876416].  
 
Determination of PK evaluability will be made by a protocol pharmacologist  and tracked in the 
study database  (see Section 10.2 for the definition of PK unevaluable).  If a participant is deemed 
unevaluable, the CMC will determine how to pro ceed with replacement, and the SDMC will 
implement the decision in the data management system and SES.   
 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.[ADDRESS_1224280] monthly  (see Section 8 for details of the 
review of the assessed relationship of adverse events  to RDV ). At the time of each call, the 
DAIDS Medical Officer may, when possible,  also review any EAEs (defined in Section 7.3) 
reported to the DAIDS Safety Office that are not yet reflected in the data reports.  As drugs are not 
being provided in this study, there are no planned safety -related study action triggers o r stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37626]; however, t he CMC (and specifically, the clinician members) will continually evaluate the 
pattern and frequency of reported events and assess for any individual occur rences or trends of 
concern. If recurrent instances of a serious toxicity  are observed, appropriate authorities, such as 
the FDA and/or the pharmaceutical company, may be notified.  
   
 Monitoring  by [CONTACT_876417] (SMC)  
 
An independent IMPAACT SMC will review the SPDSMP  in an introductory initial review , 
following policies described in the IMPAACT MOP .  
 
After the initial review, SMC reviews will only occur on an  ad hoc  basis if any issues or concerns 
arise , as determined by [CONTACT_876418]. The MOG will regularly review, at a minimum,  
accrual and retention reports. Also, as described above in Section 9.5.1, the CMC will closely 
monitor the study and will raise any issues or concerns to the IMPAACT MOG, part icularly with 
regard to accrual, feasibility, and participant safety.  The MOG will then determine if an ad hoc 
SMC review should be convened. F or ad hoc  SMC reviews, limited data will be reviewed, 
focusing on the events that triggered the reviews.    
 
Base d on any of its reviews, the SMC may recommend that the study proceed as currently 
designed, proceed with design modifications, or be discontinued.  The SMC may also provide 
operational recommendations to help address any study implementation challenges tha t may be 
identified during their reviews.   
 
9.6 Analyses  
 
This section provides a brief summary of the planned statistical analyses. Details will be specified 
in a separate, comprehensive SAP. Section 10.4 describes the pharmacology data analyses and 
modelling, including the non -compartmental and population PK analyses.  
 
The data analyses to address the primary and secondary PK and safety objectives will  include 
descripti ve statistics. PK outcome measures will be summarized using geometric means, 
arithmetic means, % CVs, and 90% CIs. The 90% CI for the arithmetic mean will be calculated 
on the log scale using the modified Cox approach (24). Continuous safety outcome measures , such 
as newborn birth weight,  will be summarized using mean and median as measures of location and 
the standard deviation  and quantiles of minimum, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, and maximum  
as measures of dispersion . Categorical safety outcome measures will be summarized using 
proportions and exact binomial (Clopper -Pearson) 95% CIs. Descriptive statistics will also be 
presented by [CONTACT_876419] [ADDRESS_1224281] 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 54 of 79 18 December 2020  For the objectives that compare PK parameters between arms, 90% CIs for the geometric mean 
ratio (GMR) of the PK parameters in study pregnant women versus non -pregnant women will be 
calculated to assess whether or not there is a greater than 30% difference  in exposure in pregnant 
women versus non -pregnant women. The confidence coefficient will be 90% rather than 95% to 
match the usual practice in the PK literature. We will use Schuirmann’s two one -sided tests 
(TOST) approach to show that the means of the tw o groups do not differ by [CONTACT_876420] 30% 
margin of equivalence, i.e.: the 90% CI of the GMR is between 0.7 and 1.43 (26). As di scussed in 
Section 9.1, the 30% margin is a  preliminary analysis approach  (due to paucity of available data), 
and the SAP will be updated to include a dditional analyses to assess adequacy of dosing during 
pregnancy as more information on the PK and pharmacodynamics of RDV in adults with 
COVID -[ADDRESS_1224282] blood with 
concentrations in maternal plasma at delivery using the GMR with a 90% CI.   
 
The intracellular concentrations of GS -443902 at each timepoint and in each arm will be 
summarized using descriptive  statistics and compared between pregna nt and non -pregnant 
women  using the GMR with a 90% CI. Individual -level concentrations over time will also be 
visualized using spaghetti plots and compared within individual .   
 
The RDV free fraction from ex vivo  experiments will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
for pregnant and non -pregnant women, as will the unbound RDV concentrations  (calculated as 
follows: total concentration x free fraction)  and the Albumin and AAG concentrations.  
 
For lactating women meeting breast  milk collection criteria, the number  and percentage  of 
women with detectable maternal breast  milk concentration s for RDV and GS -[ADDRESS_1224283] milk/plasma ratios,  will be  calculated and summarized using descriptive statistics. Timing 
of breast milk and plasma sample collection since EOI will also be summarized.  
 
All analyses will include all participants with evaluable data for that analysis (see Section  10.[ADDRESS_1224284], 4th, or 5th infusion (at site discretion), as described in Section 6.4.[ADDRESS_1224285] of care (SOC) labs on the days of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th 
infusions, as described in Section 6.4.[ADDRESS_1224286] block  (pre-dose through [ADDRESS_1224287] -EOI)  intensive  PK samples are collected , and at least 
1 sample in the 2nd block ([ADDRESS_1224288] -EOI), and either the pre -dose or [ADDRESS_1224289]. PK results from women who had incomplete PK sampling due to early 
discontinuation of RDV may be included in population PK modeling and simulations.  
 
10.3 Pharmacology Outcome Measures  
 
Pharmacology outcome measures are described in Section 9.2.  
 
10.4 Pharmacology Data Analysis and Modeling  
 
 Non-Compartmental PK Analyses  
 
Descriptive presentat ion of the concentrations and the various collection times will be 
summarized. A non -compartmental PK analysis (NCA) will be performed on the plasma 
concentration -time data generated for each participant. Calculated PK parameters will include, as 
permitted by [CONTACT_33653]:  
  
• RDV AUC  
• RDV C max  
• GS-441524 Ctrough  
• RDV terminal elimination rate constant (λ z) and  
• RDV the terminal elimination half -life (T1/2). 
 
RDV C max will be taken directly from the observed concentration -time data and is expected to 
occur at the end of the infusion. Data permitting, the RDV terminal slope, λ z, will be determined 
from log -linear portion of the curve and the terminal half -life (T 1/2) calculated as 0.693/ λ z. RDV 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.0                    Page 56 of 79 18 December 2020  AUC will be determined using the linear trapezoidal method. In absence of adequate PK data to 
perform an NCA , other appropriate compartmental analyses may be undertaken to describe the 
plasma PK of RDV  and GS -441524. The random s parse (single) PK sample concentrations on 
days 2-[ADDRESS_1224290]-infusion, intracellular concentrations in DBS and PBMC , RDV 
protein binding results , and among lactating women, frequency of RDV and/or GS -[ADDRESS_1224291] milk/plasma ratio  will be summarized descriptively.  
 
 Population PK Analyses  
 
Population PK analyses will be performed for RDV and GS -[ADDRESS_1224292] the study team with assessment of safety 
or adequacy of dosing during pregnancy. With data from 20 pregnant  and 20 non -pregnant 
women, the population PK modeling and approximately 12 PK samples per participant, the power 
to build complex PK models will be limited. Thus, the population PK analysis will focus on 
determination of mean  clear ance (CL) and volume of distribution  (V) for GS -[ADDRESS_1224293] adult doses of RDV . A preliminary analysis approach for this study is to assess 
if drug exposure during pregnancy is within 30% of the PK outcome measures for a comparison 
population of non -pregnant adults, including healthy non -COVID infected adults ( see Table 1 in 
Section 1.2) as well as adults with COVID -19 and nonpregnant women enrolled in Arm 2 of this 
study . If toxicities are noted, relationships  with RDV and GS -441524 exposures may be explored. 
Additional analyses to assess adequacy of dosing during pregnancy will be performed as more 
information on the PK and pharmacodynamics of RDV in adults with COVID -19 becomes 
available, including data from Arm 2 (non -pregnant women) of this study. Since this is an 
observational and opportunistic study, which does not dictate therapy, actual dose modifications 
in study participants will not occur and are not applicable.

The NIH is mandated by [CONTACT_439482] (27, 28). Recent national and international guidance also recommends 
the inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials (29, 30). This study re sponds to these  mandate s 
and will provide clinical research data to inform treatment of COVID -19 in pregnant women. Per 
the US Code of Federal Regulations  (CFR) , the sIRB and local IRB  must consider the potential 
risks and benefits to maternal  participants , and their fetuses , as described in 45 CFR 46 Subpart B 
(for pregnant women, fetuses, and neonates)  and 45 CFR 46 Subpart D (for children).  
Additionally, women  who are severely ill with COVID -19 to the point of being incapable of 
giving consent would be  considered vulnerable per the definition of ICH E6 (R2) 1.[ADDRESS_1224299] pay special attention to safeguarding the rights, safety, and well -
being of these participants . While fetuses/ infants  of Arm [ADDRESS_1224300] to 45 CFR 46 Subpart B, the sp ecifications of 45 CFR 46.204 (d) are expected  to 
apply  to this study . There is no prospect of direct benefit for the woman nor the fetus, risk to the 
fetus from participation in this study (which is limited to blood draws  on the mother  while the 
fetus is in utero ) is not greater than minimal,  and the purpose of this research is the development 
of important biomedical knowledge that c annot be obtained by [CONTACT_86416] (as further 
described in Section 1.3). Therefore, pregnant participants  (or their LAR ) will be asked to provide  
informed consent  for their own  study participation  (including abstraction of infant outcome data)  
under [ADDRESS_1224301]. N o procedures are performed directly on the infant. As such, the research is not 
greater than minimal risk. Per 45 CFR 46.408 (b), it is expected that the sIRB will find  that the 
consent of one parent is sufficient for research to be conducted under 46.404 . 
 
13.3 Informed Consent  
 
Refer to Section 4.5 and the study -specific MOP for further information on informed consent 
procedures for this study.  A sample  informed consent form  is provided in Appendix II.  
 
Informed consent for study participation will be obtained from each  participant before any study -
specific procedures are performed.  If the participant is unable to provide informed consent (e.g . 
impaired capacity, as determined by [CONTACT_876421]) 
written informed consent will be obtained from the participant’s LAR  on behalf  of the participant 
in accordance with [ADDRESS_1224302] of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 Public 
Health Emergency dated March 2020, updated May 14, 2020, while FDA regulations generally 
require that the informed consent of a participant be documented by [CONTACT_2224] a written consent 
form that has been approved by [CONTACT_876422] (21 CFR 50.27(a)), in lig ht of COVID -[ADDRESS_1224303] be documented in the participant’s research 
record.  
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the site investigator must comply  with 
applicable regulatory requirements, ICH GCP guidelines, and ethical principles. The informed 
consent form must be approved by [CONTACT_876423] . The informed consent process will 
include information exchange, detailed discussion, and assessme nt of understanding of all 
required elements of informed consent, including the potential risks, benefits, and alternatives to 
study participation.   
 
In light of the circumstances presented by [CONTACT_876424] -19, the informed 
consent SOPs for all sites must include the following information:  
 
• The method to be used to assess the decision -making capacity of participant s. 
• The process for  obtaining consent when a participant is not capable to consent on her own 
behalf (i.e., lacks decision -maki ng capacity).  
• Information about who can serve as a LAR  and the process for LAR selection , in accordance 
with applicable local laws . 
 
13.[ADDRESS_1224304] study pr ocedures are routine medical procedures that are associated with minimal to no risk 
in participants. Blood collection may cause pain, bruising, swelling, or fainting. There is a very 
small chance of infection where the needle is inserted.   
 
13.6 Reimbursement/C ompensation  Plan  
 
Pending sIRB  approval, participants will be compensated  for time and inconvenience  associated 
with completing  data collection and  PK sampling  visits  as part of this study . Specific 
compensation amounts will be determined by [CONTACT_876425]/data collection.  Participants 
will be compensated  one payment  between  $10 - $50 for each data collection  time period (i.e., 
baseline, infusion period, safety follow -up, and delivery ) for a total of up to [ADDRESS_1224305] for 
data collection . On days where there is also PK sampling, participants  will receive an additional 
$50-[ADDRESS_1224306] participant privacy and confidentiality to the extent possible.  
Participant information will not be released without written permission to do so except as 
necessary for review, monitoring, and/or aud iting as described in Section 11.2. Data or 
information from the study may be shared with drug companies  who have agreements with 
 
IMPAACT 2032, FINAL  Version 2.[ADDRESS_1224307] and/ or the US NIH, or regulatory entities, but ind ividual participants will not be 
identified.  
 
All study -related information will be stored securely.  Participant research records will be stored 
in locked areas with access limited to study staff.  All laboratory specimens, CRFs, and other 
documents that may be transmitted off -site will be identified by [CONTACT_50815].  Likewise, 
communications between study staff and Protocol Team members regarding individual 
participants will identify participants by [CONTACT_50815].   
 
Study sites are encouraged but not required by [CONTACT_421612].  All local 
databases must be secured with password protected access systems.  Lists, log books, appointment 
books, and any other documents that link PID numbers to personal identifying information should 
be stored in a separate, locked location in an area with limited access.   
 
In addition to the above, a Certificate of Confidentiality has bee n obtained for this study from the 
US Department of Health and Human Services.  This certificate protects study staff from being 
compelled to disclose study -related information by [CONTACT_133099], state, or local civil, criminal, 
administrative, legislative,  or other proceedings.  It thus serves to protect the identity and privacy 
of study participants.

Key Information  
 
Here is a summary of important information about the study:  
 
• You are being asked to take part in this study because you are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19 and are 
currently  getting,  or may get in the future,  remdesivir medication for treatment of COVID -19. 
•  You will not receive remdesivir through this study if you choose to join this study. You will  continue 
to get care and treatment for COVID -[ADDRESS_1224322] whether or not you receive remdesivir for treatment of COVID -19.   
• The primary  purpose  of the study  is to determine  how much  of the remdesivir  medication  is in a 
woman’s  blood . Another  purpo se is to look at how safe remdesivir  is for a woman.   
• If you choose to join the study, you will have blood samples taken at the same time that you are  
having remdesivir infusions.

• It is possible to join this study and then not receive remdesivir infusions. If you do not start 
remdesiv ir infusions within 7 days after joining the study , you will not stay in the study.  
• There is  no direct benefit to you from being in the study. However, this study may help doctors learn 
information that will help in the treatment of future patients with remdesivir for COVID -19.  
• The most likely risk to you is from blood drawing - including pain, which is usually minor, and 
infection, which is rare .  
• There could be risks of disclosure of your information.  
• Your decision  about this study  will have no effect on the medical care that you would normally 
receive from your clinic al care provider , the cost of your care,  or your clinical care provider’s 
decision to treat you with remdesivir . Your access to services, and the benefits and rights y ou 
normally have, will not be affected.  
 
More information is given in both parts of this form about the study, its risks and benefits.  You should feel that 
you understand the study before deciding whether to participate. After you understand the study, and  if you decide

About the study  
 
This study is being done by [CONTACT_133103] 
(IMPAACT).  
 
The study will measure the amount  of remdesivir in the blood of pregnant women and non -pregnant women. The 
study will include about [ADDRESS_1224323] information on 
your baby [CONTACT_876432]’s  birth . We may also collect breast milk from women who are lactating (making breast milk).   
 
The [LOCATION_002] National Institutes of Health and [COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. are paying for this study.  
 
1. The study will measure the amounts of remdesivir in the blood of pregnant women and  non-pregnant women 
being treated for COVID -19.  
 
The amount of remdesi vir needed during pregnancy to treat COVID -19 while being safe for pregnant women and 
their babies has not yet been studied. In this study, we will measure the levels of remdesivir medicine in the blood

their baby [CONTACT_876433], we will also measure t he amount of remdesivir  found in blood from 
the baby’s umbilical cord and compare that  to the amount of remdesivir  in mother’s  blood at the time of delivery . 
We will also try to measure the amount of remdesivir found in breast milk of women whose bodies are making  
breast milk around the time of receiving remdesivir.  
 
2. Only pregnant women  and non -pregnant women  who are eligible can join the study.  
 
If you decide to join the study, we will first talk to you about the study and collect some information about you to 
find out if you are eligible. More information about this is given in section #4 below. If you are e ligible, you can

remdesivir.  
 
• On one infusion day (either your 3rd, 4th or 5th infusion) , [ADDRESS_1224326] sample, we will draw 1 7 mL (a little over 3 teaspoons).  For the next 6 samples, at each collection  
time we will draw 2 mL ( about ½  teaspoon ) of blood, for a total of 12 mL (about  2.5 teaspoons). For the 
last sample, we will collect 11 mL (a little more than 2 teaspoons) of blood. If one is not already there, a 
small plastic c atheter (soft tube) will be placed in a vein in your arm on this day  before we start collecting 
the blood samples , so that blood can be drawn multiple times without having to stick you with a needle 
several times. The tube may stay in place until all of th e blood samples are drawn for this day.

hours. Additionally , if you are still in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_876388] ( [ADDRESS_1224328] infusion) , we will also collect this 2mL blood sample  in the same way.  
 
If you start receiving remdesivir, but then stop receiving it  before your 5th infusion, we will not collect any more 
blood samples  from you after you stop your remdesivir, but you will stay  in the study  and w e will continue to 
collect information from your medical records.  
 
9. If you are pregnant and received remdesivir close to the time you deliver, you will have blood drawn at the 
time of delivery.

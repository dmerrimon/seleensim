1.1 Study Objectives
The long-term objective of this study is to determine whether a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-
1R) agonist, liraglutide (brand name [CONTACT_704343]®), can improve clinical outcomes in patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_46212] (OUD). We propose to study the efficacy and safety of liraglutide treatment and its effects 
on craving in OUD patients within a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blinded, parallel arm clinical 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_704238]:
1) To evaluate the efficacy of liraglutide (vs placebo), administered daily, in reducing craving for 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_704239]. Well-validated measures of craving, 
including visual cue-elicited craving, and ecological momentary assessment (daily smartphone 
assessments) will be used to assess craving. Based on our preclinical studies, we hypothesize that 
liraglutide will decrease craving among patients in treatment for OUD. 
2) To evaluate the safety of liraglutide, administered daily, in humans seeking treatment for OUD. 
We will measure how liraglutide changes respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, and heart rate as well 
as blood concentrations of glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and fructosamine, over the course 
of a 18-day titration (3-dose intervention) or 30-day titration (5-dose intervention) to full 
treatment dosage. 
1.2 Primary Study Endpoints
The primary objectives of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_56096] 1) to determine whether liraglutide can reduce cue-elicited 
drug craving over 3-5 weeks while participants are in residential treatment for OUD, and 2) to study 
whether liraglutide can reduce ambient (daily) drug craving over approximately 21-33 days while 
participants are in residential treatment for OUD.  
1)Cue-elicited Drug Craving. Change in self-reported cue-elicited drug craving from baseline (Day 1) to 
the end of the target drug dose (Day 19 [and additionally until Day 31 for 5-dose intervention]) will 
be measured on a 0-100 point visual analog scale (VAS), where 0= no craving, 100= maximum 
craving. Assessments are taken prior to, and immediately after, exposure to visual drug cues in the 
Cue Response Task.
2)Ambient Drug Craving.  Change in ambient drug craving over time will be measured throughout the 
study (Days 1-21 [and additionally until Day 33 for 5-dose intervention]) using a 0-100 VAS delivered 
via smartphone using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) [ADDRESS_956875] day 
(Days 1 and 19 [and additionally Day 31 for the 5-dose intervention]) and on the first two days and 
last 2 days of each treatment dose.
1.3 Secondary Study Endpoints
The secondary objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_704240].
1)Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_704241] 
a.Blood Pressure . Change in blood pressure from baseline (Day 1) to: i) the beginning of each 
study drug dose (Days 2, 8, 14, 20, 26); ii) end of the target drug dose (Day 19 [Day 31 for 5-
dose intervention]); and iii) rebound follow-up (Day 21 [Day 33 for 5-dose intervention]). 
b.Heart Rate. Change in heart rate from baseline (Day 1) to: i) the beginning of each study 
drug dose (Days 2, 8, 14, 20, 26); ii) end of the target drug dose (Day 19, [Day 31 for 5-dose 
intervention]); and iii) rebound follow-up (Day 21 [Day 33 for 5-dose intervention]). 
c.Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Change in respi[INVESTIGATOR_704242] (Day 1) to: i) the beginning of each study 
drug dose (Days 2, 8, 14, 20, 26); ii) end of the target drug dose (Day 19 [Day 31 for 5-dose 
intervention]); and iii) rebound follow-up (Day 21 [Day 33 for 5-dose intervention]).

rebound follow-up (Daily, from Days 1 to 21 [Days 1-33 for 5-dose intervention]). 
3)Glycemic Control. Glycemic control will be monitored by [CONTACT_704294] 
A1c. Fasting blood sample measurements change slowly overtime (i.e., across weeks and months) 
and therefore will be evaluated only on Days 2 and 19 [and additionally Day 31 for 5-dose 
intervention] via venipuncture. 
4)Adverse Events. Frequency of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) deemed related 
to treatment throughout the study period (Days 1-21 [1-33 for 5-dose intervention]), and at [ADDRESS_956876]-intervention (Day 49 [Day 61 for 5-dose intervention]).
1.4 Exploratory Endpoints
1)Prefrontal Cortical Response to Drug Cues. Change in blood oxygenation level response to visual 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_704243] (Day 1) to end of the target drug dose (Day 19 
[additionally Day 31 for 5-dose intervention]) using Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRs).
2)Rebound Ambient Drug Craving. Change in ambient drug craving as measured by 0-[ADDRESS_956877] 2 days of 
each treatment dose from end of rebound follow up (Day 21 [Day 33 for 5-dose intervention]) to 
baseline (Day 1) and to end of the target drug dose (Day 19 [Day 31 for 5-dose intervention]).
3)Rebound Blood Pressure. Change in blood pressure from end of the target drug dose (Day 19 [Day 
31 for 5-dose intervention]) to rebound follow up (Day 21 [Day 33 for 5-dose intervention]).
4)Rebound Heart Rate. Change in heart rate from end of the target drug dose (Day 19 [Day 31 for 5-
dose intervention]) to rebound follow up (Day 21 [Day 33 for 5-dose intervention]).
5)Rebound Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Change in respi[INVESTIGATOR_704244] (Day 19 [Day 31 for 5-
dose intervention]) to rebound follow up (Day 21 [Day 33 for 5-dose intervention]).
6)Long-term Glycemic Control. Change in HbA1c and fructosamine levels from Day 2 to end of the 
target drug dose (Day 19 [Day 31 for 5-dose intervention]).
2.0 Background 
2.1 Scientific Background and Gaps
An estimated 5.6 percent of the global population used illicit drugs in 2016, with 34 million using 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]; worldwide in 2015, 450,000 people died as a result of drug use, with opi[INVESTIGATOR_704245] 76 
percent of deaths in those with drug use disorders [1]. In the [LOCATION_002], in 2017, approximately 51.8 
million people aged 12 or older used an illicit drug or abused any psychotherapeutic medication. Of 
those, 11.4 million used an opi[INVESTIGATOR_704246] [2]. According to 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between July 2016 and September 2017 there was a 
30% increase in the number of emergency room visit for opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211] [3]. There were 70,237 drug 
overdose deaths reported in the [LOCATION_002] in 2017, and of these, 67.8%, or 47,600, involved opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] 
[4], costing the nation an estimated $51.2 billion annually [5], or $504.0 billion (2.8% Gross Domestic 
Product) when including non-fatal impacts [6].
Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) and Substance Use Disorder. A great deal of attention has focused on 
the reward pathway and the view that drugs of abuse hijack natural reward substrates [7, 8]. Drug-
seeking animals and humans, however, are driven by a need state not unlike that of water, food, or salt  
[9]. GLP-1 is a hormone produced by L cells in the small intestine that reduces intake of food, in part, by 
[CONTACT_704295], decreasing glucagon release, and decreasing gastric emptying [10], producing 
a ‘satiety’ effect. GLP-[ADDRESS_956878] (NST), and these cells 
project widely throughout the brain including to reward and feeding circuitry [11, 12]. Treatment with 
GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists inhibits ingestion of palatable sweets, water when thirsty, and salt 
when sodium deficient [11, 13-19]. As such, treatment with this ‘satiety’ signal, GLP-1, was predicted to 
reduce drug seeking and taking in humans, as well as rats. 
STUDY00013559
Approval: 11/21/2023
Page 5 of 46 (V.01/21/2019) In preclinical studies, treatment with the GLP-1R agonist, Exendin-4 (Ex-4), has been shown to reduce a 
conditioned place preference for, and the accumbens dopamine response to, nicotine, cocaine, and 
amphetamine, and reduces cocaine self-administration in rats [15, 16, 20, 21]. Likewise, treatment with 
Ex-4, in a dose that does not affect responding for sucrose, decreases fixed and progressive ratio 
responding for cocaine [18] and, when administered centrally, cocaine-induced reinstatement [22]. 
Finally, the use of a GLP-1R agonist increases insulin secretion, while inhibiting glucagon, only in 
response to increases in glucose levels [23, 24].  As such, this treatment can potentially be used in 
patients with OUD without diabetes without the risk of hypoglycemia. Substantial evidence from 
randomized controlled trials indicate that the use of a GLP-1R agonist can produce significant, sustained 
weight loss in obese but non-diabetic people without causing any adverse effects on circulating glucose 
blood pressure, HbA1c or their lipid profile [25-27],  suggesting it could be used safely in OUD patients. 
GLP-1R agonists, then, are promising for the treatment of substance use disorder (SUD) in humans. 
Further, the intervention can be readily translated for a new indication, as various formulations of GLP-
1R agonists are approved for treatment of obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in humans [21, 
28] and already are in clinical trials for nicotine and alcohol use disorders [29-34].

administration of Ex-4 (2.4 µg/kg ip) during 
abstinence and prior to test (i) in rats with a 
history of heroin self-administration decreased 
cue-induced heroin-seeking (Figure 1, left) and (ii) 
abolished drug-induced reinstatement of heroin-
seeking (Figure 1, right). In a second preliminary 
study, we tested the longer acting GLP-1R 
agonist, liraglutide [0.1 mg/kg subcutaneous, 
(sc)]. The half-life for liraglutide in rats is about 
4 h [35]. Our results showed that daily 
liraglutide treatment beginning on the 11th day 
of heroin self-administration and continuing 
through abstinence: (i) reduced heroin self-administration (Figure 2, left), (ii) failed to reduce seeking 
during extinction (Figure 2, middle), possibly due to a slower onset of the longer acting liraglutide 
(liraglutide was injected 1 h before extinction testing), and (iii) significantly reduced heroin-induced 
reinstatement of heroin seeking behavior (liraglutide was administered 6 h prior to the reinstatement Figure 1: Mean (+/- SEM) number of infusion attempts/h during 
cued extinction testing (Left) and heroin-induced reinstatement 
testing (Right) in rats with a history saline or heroin self-

Page 6 of 46 (V.01/21/2019) test, Figure 2, right).  Taken together, these data provide strong support that GLP-1R agonists hold 
promise as a novel intervention for OUD.  
GLP-1R agonist treatment 
in humans.  GLP-1R 
agonists have been studied 
for decades and are, as 
mentioned, an approved 
and effective treatment 
for obesity and (T2DM) in 
humans [27, 36, 37]. In 
131 patients with T2DM, 
treatment with GLP-1R 
agonists led to significant 
improvement in glycated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c) and 
BMI [38]. Likewise, GLP-1R 
agonists in patients with 
T2DM led to controlled 
blood glucose, along with positive effects on body weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol [10]. 
Furthermore, neuroimaging studies have shown that GLP-1R agonists reduce brain responses to food 
cues in obese and T2DM participants, but not in lean participants. Specifically, Van Bloemendaal et al. 
[39] demonstrated that the GLP-1R agonist exenatide (relative to placebo) decreased functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures of brain activation in the amygdala, insula, putamen, and, 
importantly, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in response to a series of food related cues (i.e., food vs non-
food pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]) in subjects with obesity and T2DM. This effect was not observed in lean control subjects. 
The most common side effects of GLP-1R treatment are nausea and diarrhea; less common is injection-
site bruising or “reactions” (i.e. erythema, pruritus, and rash) [36]. One meta-analysis found evidence of 
a slight increase in heart rate, a modest reduction in blood pressure, and no association with 
hypertension across 60 trials employing 14 different GLP-1R formulations [40]. Further work reported 
decreased cardiovascular risk [41] and a reduction in major adverse cardiac events including nonfatal 
stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality [42] in T2DM patients treated with 
GLP-1R agonists compared with placebo.
All GLP-1R agonists are not the same with regard to treatment of obesity or T2DM. Ex-4 (exenatide) is a 
short acting GLP-1R agonist with a half-life of 2.4 h in humans [43]. Liraglutide has a longer half-life of 
about 13 h in humans [44] and, as such, has been found useful as a once/day sc injectable formulation 
for the treatment of obesity [27, 45] and T2DM [46, 47]. A meta-analysis determined no cause for 
concern regarding neuropsychiatric safety associated with liraglutide [48]. 
Although liraglutide was approved for human use in 2010, there are no data testing the effectiveness in 
patients with an OUD. The objective of the proposed research is to test whether treatment with a GLP-
1R agonist can reduce craving in humans with OUD. Here, we will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_704247] a 
residential treatment facility for OUD, and who are either receiving counseling (CO) or counseling plus a 
common medication assisted treatment (MAT), buprenorphine/ naloxone (BUP/NA). We chose 
liraglutide for this initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_704248] [ADDRESS_956880] not 
been found to be strong predictors of relapse behavior [49], we will assess craving using an array of 
verbal, emotional, physiological, and neural indices. Emotional and physiological feedback will be Figure 2: Mean (+/- SEM) number of infusions/6h in rats self-administering saline or 0.06 mg/inf 
heroin iv and treated with saline or liraglutide (0.1 mg/kg sc) (Left). Mean (+/- SEM) number of 
infusion attempts/h during cue-induced extinction (Middle) and heroin-induced reinstatement testing 
in rats with a history saline or heroin self-administration and pretreated with saline or liraglutide (1.0 
mg/kg sc) (Right).

can reduce craving in humans with OUD. Understanding how a ‘satiety’ agent may affect craving and 
brain responses to drug cues in an OUD population would provide entirely novel information. If 
liraglutide shows a trend towards efficacy, and safety of the GLP-1R agonist is demonstrated in this 
population, it would provide an indication to run the second phase, multi-center clinical trial of GLP-1R 
agonist in OUD patients.

treatments and/or buprenorphine/naloxone. 
All participants, at the time of consent, will be enrolled in the 3-dose study procedure which takes [ADDRESS_956892] recruitment pool possible and provides a common procedure that all 
participants will complete. By [CONTACT_2006] 18 of the 3-dose procedure, participants will be asked whether they 
are able to, and willing to, continue the study for an additional 12 days (past Day 21) and receive 2 
additional doses of the treatment medication (now considered the 5-dose study procedure). It is 
expected that not all participants will be willing or able to extend their study participation; additionally 
participants may either know their expected length of stay early (i.e., at admission to residential 
treatment) or not until close to completion of treatment. The decision to transition into the 5-dose 
procedure will be based on the participant’s availability (i.e., whether the stay in treatment at Caron will 
be longer than the average 28 days) and on the participant’s choice to extend their length of study 
participation.
7.2 Study Procedures
Physical and Psychological Screening Procedures: The screening will include:
o12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG)
oUrine pregnancy test if female with childbearing potential
oPsychiatric assessment including: the M.I.N.I International Neuropsychiatric 
Interview (M.I.N.I. 7.0.2), Form 90-Drug Inventory (Form 90-DI), Hamilton 
Depression scale (HAM-D), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y1), and Columbia 
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)
The C-SSRS will be administrated by [CONTACT_30801]. All C-SSRS 
scores will be reported to the Caron Treatment Center Medical Director of Research 
and the Director of Research. At risk participants will be immediately reported to 
the Directors of Research. Any participant that reports recent suicidal ideation or 
behavior on the screening C-SSRS will be referred for further immediate evaluation 
by a clinician. Clinical judgement and additional consult with the Caron Medical 
Director, study PI, and/or study staff will be used to further clarify if the subject is 
eligible to continue in the study. Participants not at risk will be reported weekly.
The Directors will refer the clinical decision to the psychology and medical team. If 
the patient is deemed to be suicidal, and is willing to get help, the psychology staff 
will utilize their typi[INVESTIGATOR_704252] a local 
psychiatric facility (e.g., Philhaven, Lancaster Behavioral Health). The patient may be 
transported via ambulance or via Caron transportation (depending on how safe staff 
feels it is to transfer) to the facility for admission. In the case that the participant is 
uncooperative, Service Access and Management, Inc. (SAM) will be notified to assist 
with emergency planning. Any participant who develops active suicidal ideation with 
some intent to act with or without a specific plan will be discontinued from study 
treatment.
STUDY00013559
Approval: 11/21/2023
Page 14 of 46 (V.01/21/2019) Body Weight:  Body weight will be measured daily throughout the study (Days 1-21 [Days 1-
33 for 5-dose intervention]). 
Blood glucose: 
oBlood samples to assess changes in more long-term indices of glycemic control, such 
as hemoglobin A1c (HbA 1c) and fructosamine, will be collected prior to the first dose 
of study drug (Day 2) and at the end of the target dose (Day 19 [and additionally at 
Day 31 for 5-dose intervention]). Samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_704298]’s clinical 
laboratory.
Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_704241]: Recordings will be collected using a portable cardiovascular 
autonomic cart at CaronTC. The data will be recorded via a data acquisition system 
(PowerLab, ADInstruments). After instrumentation, participants will rest for 10 minutes, 
followed by 15 minutes of continuous recordings of cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_108951]. 
oBlood pressure, heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_704253] (Day 
1), during study drug administration (Days 2, 8, 14, 19, 20, 26, and 31), and at the 
end of rebound follow-up (Day 21 [Day 33 for 5-dose intervention]). At each of 
these time points, participants will be placed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. 
Blood pressure will be measured continuously using the finger volume 
clamp method (NOVA Finapres Medical Systems or similar) and 
intermittently by [CONTACT_704299] (Philips SureSigns VS3 
or similar). 
A 3-lead EKG will be used to continuously measure heart rate (Cardiocap/5 
GE Healthcare or similar). 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_704254] a pneumography belt, and oxygen 
saturation by [CONTACT_704300] (BCI 3301 or similar). 
Cue-elicited drug craving will be evaluated. This will be evaluated using Visual Analog Scales 
(VAS) on Day 1 and Day 19 [and additionally at Day 31 for 5-dose intervention].
oCue-elicited craving will be measured on a 0-100 point VAS, where 0= no craving, 
100 = maximum craving. Assessments will be taken prior to, and immediately after, 
exposure to visual drug cues in the Cue Response Task.
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA): EMA data will be collected throughout the study 
(Days 1-21 [Days 1-33 for 5-dose intervention]) [ADDRESS_956893] 
3 days (Days 1-3) and then on a rotating “4-days on, 2-days off” schedule starting Day 6. 
Data to be collected include: Ambient Drug Craving; Positive and Negative Mood; 
Pain/Discomfort; and Sleep on 0-[ADDRESS_956894] an app (the Wear-IT 
app) that will be put on the study smartphone provided to the participant while they are in 
the study. This smartphone will have a security application installed that prevents user 
access to all other applications that are not associated with data collection. Smartphones 
will not be activated on a cellular network resulting in the disabling of voice, text, and 
internet functions. Research staff will use brief in-person meetings (every other day) as a 
means to ensure devices are being charged, build rapport, answer participant questions, 
monitor compliance, and to manually download data for backup storage for upload to a 
secure server, Virtual COLO, at University Park in State College. Participants will need to plug 
the phone in to charge each night.
Physiological Wearables: A “wearable” wristband will be worn throughout the study (Days 
1-21 [Days 1-33 for 5-dose intervention]) to monitor stress responses, including acute 
STUDY00013559
Approval: 11/21/2023
Page 15 of 46 (V.01/21/2019) changes that may be associated with the drug delivery via injection. Data collected include 
heart rate, actigraphy for sleep and activity measurement, and stress responses (including 
acute changes in these measures that may be associated with the drug delivery via 
injection). A body temperature compliance sensor will be used to validate that the device is 
being worn. So that participants do not have to charge the actigraphy wristband themselves, 
participants will have up to two actigraphy wristbands assigned to them, and they will be 
charged or, if necessary, swapped out at their check-in sessions. Participants may wear the 
actigraphy wristband while showering or swimming if they wish.
Neurophysiology Lab Day Measures: Participants will be tested at baseline (Day 1) and at 
the end of the target dose (Day 19 [and additionally Day 31 for 5-dose intervention]) for 
cortical activity using Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and VAS during:
oVisual cue reactivity task to: (a) opi[INVESTIGATOR_59794]; (b) non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_704255]; (c) natural 
reward cues (e.g., pleasant pi[INVESTIGATOR_249841], puppi[INVESTIGATOR_014], positive relationships, etc.) 
and (d) emotionally neutral stimuli (e.g., images of household objects) 
oThe VAS measure of craving pre-post visual cue reactivity task
oBalloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)
fNIRs data files will be placed into the REDCap database, with access to these files provided 
to key investigators at Drexel University for signal processing and return for data analyses. 
These data will be de-identified and will consist only of the unique study id number, raw 
data, stimulus markers, and date/time stamps that have been modified so that they do not 
contain the actual visit date.
Study drug/placebo administration: Participants will be taught self-administration by 
[CONTACT_3449]/nursing staff. 
oAll self-administrations will occur via blinded, multi-dose subcutaneous injection 
pens, and will be observed by [CONTACT_704301]. 
oParticipants will receive medications daily at a specified time (prior to breakfast) 
throughout the study, starting on Day 2. 
oParticipants will be taught to inject the solutions subcutaneously in the abdomen, 
thigh, or upper arm, and will administer daily injections under the supervision of a 
study nurse or staff member. 
oParticipants will be taught by [CONTACT_704302], check the 
drug/vehicle flow, select the dose, inject the dose, remove the needle, and dispose 
of the needle.
oParticipants will always use a new needle for each dose administration in the study. 
Adverse Events: Adverse events will be monitored continuously throughout the study (Days 
1-21 [Days 1-33 for 5-dose intervention]), and at [ADDRESS_956895]-intervention (Day 49 [Day 61 
for 5-dose intervention]).

7.4.1 Description
Liraglutide (Saxenda®, Novo Nordisk) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor 
agonist approved by [CONTACT_240066] T2DM (1.8 mg/day) and obesity (3.0 mg/day) 
and has been deemed safe for use in populations with a history of substance use disorder 
(American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, 2016; see also Saxenda package insert, 
Plainsboro, NJ: Novo Nordisk A/S; 2015).
Liraglutide 6 mg/ml (Novo Nordisk), will be provided as a solution in a pre-filled, multi-dose pen 
that delivers doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg, or 3 mg of liraglutide as a subcutaneous 
injection.
Liraglutide and placebo will be delivered as a solution (liquid) in identical multidose pens.  In 
order to use Saxenda® as a blinded comparator in the clinical trial, the presentation has been 
modified from the Marketed product. For Saxenda® (Comparator) the primary packaging 
materials are identical to what is approved in the Marketing authorization, except that the 
cartridge for the comparator is produced with an army green closure cap. The closure cap in the 
currently marketed Saxenda® product is a light blue cap. The cap is not in contact [CONTACT_704305]. For Saxenda® (Comparator) the 
pen is identical to what is approved in the Marketing Authorization, except for the color of the 
cartridge holder and the pushbutton, where the Marketed version is purple and the clinical 
comparator is light brown. The pen is not in contact [CONTACT_704306]. 
New, unused liraglutide/vehicle pens will be stored according to the information stated on the 
trial product label. Pens will be disposed of after 30 days of initial use.  
7.4.2 Treatment Regimen
The recommended maximum dosage is 3 mg/day, administered any time of day. This choice in 
dosage is based on the current FDA-approved dosing regimen for liraglutide to help patients 
manage craving in obesity. The initial dose will start at 0.6 mg/day for the first 6 days, then 
titrate by 0.6 mg every 6 days – to reduce the likelihood of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms – 
until 1.8 mg/day is reached for the 3-dose intervention and 3 mg/day is reached for the 5-dose 
intervention. Participants will be taught self-administration by [CONTACT_3449]/nursing staff. All self-
administrations will occur via blinded, multi-dose subcutaneous injection pens, and will be 
observed by [CONTACT_704301].
Participants will receive medications daily at a specified time (prior to breakfast) throughout the 
study. Participants will be taught to inject the solutions subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, 
or upper arm, and will administer daily injections under the supervision of a study nurse or staff 
member. Participants will be taught by [CONTACT_704302], check the 
drug/vehicle flow, select the dose, inject the dose, remove the needle, and dispose of the 
needle. Participants will always use a new needle for each dose administration in the study. 
Dosages will be chosen based on current titration level in the study.
There is no provision to provide study treatment after the study.

Page 25 of 46 (V.01/21/2019) 7.4.[ADDRESS_956903] to Treatment Groups
Participants will receive either liraglutide or placebo in a two-arm parallel group study. 
Interventions will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using permuted-block randomization algorithm. 
The randomization will be performed using a random number generator via the PLAN procedure 
within SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Personnel in the Department of 
Public Health Sciences (PHS) will use the PLAN procedure within SAS software to generate a 
randomization list using variable-size, random permuted blocks to ensure that the number of 
participants in each arm is balanced after each set of B randomized participants, where B is the 
block size. Personnel in PHS will choose the block sizes without revealing it to any of the 
investigators or study personnel who will be collecting and reviewing outcomes data. The 
randomization sequence will be uploaded to a secure REDCap database. Synergy Pharmacy will 
be given access to this REDCap database to provide the blinded, randomized labeling prior to 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_704261] 
7.4.[ADDRESS_956904] Compliance Monitoring
Nursing staff will chart administration of study drug into the patient’s Caron EMR and study 
personnel will monitor and document the completion of all study procedures. Compliance is also 
being assessed through the wearables discussed above (Section 7.2) by a temperature sensor.
7.4.[ADDRESS_956905] Article
The study drugs will be blinded to participants and investigators (double blind) through the 
distribution of identical injection pens. Injection pens will be ordered from Novo Nordisk and 
received in boxes by [CONTACT_704307], an off-site pharmacy that works with the CaronTC. Each 
study drug pack will be sent to Synergy Pharmacy in a box containing a de-identified label for 
blinding purposes. Each box will have a specific Dispensing Unit Number (DUN).  A total list of 
the DUNs (Total DUN list; TDL) will be supplied by [CONTACT_704308] “liraglutide” or 
“placebo” for each DUNS number. 
Unblinded personnel at Synergy Pharmacy will be available to handle the lists that reveal if the 
blinded product contains liraglutide or placebo. The laboratory staff analyzing the blood samples 
(as opposed to study coordinators) will be unaware of the condition and the treatment of the 
participants for whom they will conduct the assays as the samples will be identified only with a 
study number. The results of the laboratory measurements will not be shared with the treating 
physicians, and will not impact patient care except in an emergent situation.
7.4.6 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return 
[IP_ADDRESS] Receipt of Test Article 
The study drug (liraglutide or placebo) will be obtained from Synergy 
pharmacy after the subject is enrolled into the study. After enrollment, 
study team members will inform Synergy Pharmacy and will provide the 
information about study subjects required for dispensing the study drug. 
Novo Nordisk will supply the clinical variant of Saxenda® (Comparator) and 
placebo in a pre-filled, multi-dose pen that delivers doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 
1.8 mg, 2.4 mg, or 3 mg of liraglutide as a subcutaneous injection. Each 1 ml 
of Saxenda solution contains 6 mg of liraglutide; each pre-filled pen contains 
a 3 ml solution of Saxenda equivalent to 18 mg of liraglutide. 
Upon receipt of study shipments from Synergy, a Caron pharmacy 
technician will inventory/check the shipment using the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_704262], expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], breakage, storage condition, and total 
quantities. The shippi[INVESTIGATOR_704263]. The shipment will 
STUDY00013559
Approval: 11/21/2023
Page 26 of 46 (V.01/21/2019) be refrigerated during shipment, and recorded on the study drug 
accountability log. The shippi[INVESTIGATOR_704264]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Storage
The storage of the medication will be at the medical detox unit at the 
CaronTC. In this unit is a locked room (nurses’ clinic) that contains a locked 
refrigerator where the medication will be stored. Therefore, the medication 
will be double locked. Only Caron nurses will have access to the medication. 
The study drugs will be refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C during storage. Caron 
nurses will check and record temperature daily.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preparation and Dispensing
Synergy Pharmacy will prepare and deliver the medication after receiving a 
scanned signed informed consent from Caron. Synergy Pharmacy will use 
the randomization log to prepare the study medications for each 
participant. The study medications will be pre-filled injectable pens that are 
identically labeled for double blinding. Dispensed study medications will be 
labeled with the label from the Synergy Pharmacy’s Computer System, 
conforming to state and federal law. The study’s required labeling will be 
attached to the dispensed product in addition to the pharmacy label. No 
parts of the study’s label will be obliterated by [CONTACT_704309]. All study 
medications will be labeled with the caution, “New Drug- Limited by [CONTACT_4496] 
(or [LOCATION_002]) law to investigational use.”
The study drug (liraglutide or placebo) will be ordered by [CONTACT_704310], stored in the medical unit, and dispensed using the supplied, pre-
filled, multi-dose pens that deliver doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg, 
or 3 mg of liraglutide as a subcutaneous injection. Study staff will maintain 
medication logs including information on time of administration, batch 
number, and expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]. Study drugs will not be used after the 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_527108]-by [CONTACT_568]. 
Study treatment injection pens (liraglutide or placebo) will look identical. 
The study drug will be obtained from the study nurse and self-administered 
by [CONTACT_704311].
[IP_ADDRESS] Return or Destruction of the Test Article
Once the study drug is prepared for the subject, it can only be administered 
to that subject. Final reconciliation of the medication will take place at the 
CaronTC, if appropriate. The CaronTC performs these procedures according 
to DEA regulations. Non-controlled substances are stored in locked medical 
bins, which are then shipped to a company that will safely destroy the 
medication. Patients who do not complete the entire study will have their 
medication destroyed via Caron’s established medication disposal protocols. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior and Concomitant Therapy
A concomitant therapy is any medication which is administered between 
study enrollment and the end of the study drug treatment phase. All 
concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_704265]00013559
Approval: 11/21/2023
Page 27 of 46 (V.01/21/2019) once weekly by [CONTACT_704312]. 
The subjects recruited will be current patients in a residential facility for the 
treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561]. Since the physicians at Caron will be 
approving patient eligibility, they will know current and past patient 
medication regimes. Subjects may be taking concomitant 
medicines/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_704266]. The 
pharmacy staff at Caron will also know which medications may not be 
permitted to take with the medication during the study, due to potential 
counteracting affects.
Precautions: Saxenda is contraindicated with the use of insulin or any other 
GLP-1R agonist; the use of these medications are identified in the exclusion 
criteria.

8.[ADDRESS_956906] Numbers and Statistical Plan
8.1 Number of Subjects
This study will enroll 50 opi[INVESTIGATOR_704268].
8.2 Sample size determination
This is an exploratory study to accumulate pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]. The primary endpoint of this study is cue-elicited 
self-reported craving VAS scores. A sample size of N=20 per group will give 80% power to detect an 
effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_956907] with a significance level of alpha=0.05. 
Accounting for an estimated 20% attrition rate, we plan to randomize a total of 20*2/0.8=[ADDRESS_956908] whether liraglutide reduces craving in patients recovering from OUD in 
residential treatment. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare liraglutide versus 
placebo treatment groups controlling for baseline values of craving. Linear mixed effects models for 
repeated measurements will also be used to evaluate the difference in changes in these primary 
outcomes between treatment groups. The baseline and post-treatment outcomes are treated as 
dependent variables in the mixed model. Subjects with missing values can be incorporated in the mixed 
model analysis when data are missing at random. The moderating effect will be assessed by [CONTACT_704313].
SAS (version 9.4) and R (version 3.2.5) software will be used for analyses with a significance level of 0.05. 
Summary statistics including means, medians, ranges, and standard deviations will be computed for 
each continuous variable and frequencies with percentages for categorical variables. Identified data 
outliers will be further examined to determine if they are data entry errors, in which case they will be 
modified when possible; otherwise, values will be kept for final analysis. 
Primary outcomes to assess efficacy are: (1) cue-elicited drug craving rated on a 100-pt VAS; and (2) 
ambient drug craving, derived from EMA of daily craving throughout the study period. Data analyses for 
cue-elicited craving will consist of a 2 x 2 ANOVA with medication status (pre- vs post-medication) as a 
within-group variable and medication type (liraglutide vs placebo) as a between-group variable. 
STUDY00013559
Approval: 11/21/2023
Page 28 of 46 (V.01/21/2019) Secondary analyses of self-reported craving measures will evaluate the role of MAT, specifically BUP/NA, 
in these results. 
EMA and Wearable Assessment: Ambient drug craving derived from the EMA will be analyzed as a 
multilevel model in the regression framework and will test effects of medication status within-person 
and medication type between-person. Secondary analyses of EMA will examine the effect of time (e.g. 
study day) to identify differences across condition in the rate of decline in craving across time.  
Data reduction including derivation of summary features for continuously collected data (e.g., sleep 
data, physiological data) will be performed before formal statistical analysis. Descriptive analysis will be 
performed to explore distributions of data and identify potential outliers. Assumptions and goodness of 
fit of statistical models will be assessed. Missing data, including mobile and ambulatory attrition and 
drop-out will be examined to ensure the validity of statistical models used.  Because ambulatory and 
mobile monitoring will continue during laboratory assessment days, correlation analyses will be used to 
confirm the agreement between corresponding measures from the two approaches; this will both speed 
harmonization for follow-up analyses, and provide additional validation of the measures used in the 
both cases.
The primary endpoints of the EMA assessment will be the rate of reduction of craving across the 
approximately [ADDRESS_956909], and pain and discomfort. 
Sleep and activity will be measured using a multimodal approach with self-report via the morning EMA 
survey and wearable actigraphy to measure and account for subjective biases in sleep timing. Craving 
reduction will be primarily measured using EMA assessment, and will be modeled using linear mixed 
models in the multilevel modeling (MLM) framework. In MLM, subject-specific random effects are 
combined with population-level fixed effects to account for variability both within each individual and 
between individuals in a manner that allows participants with incomplete data to be included in the 
model. Craving reduction will be modeled as an effect of time in treatment, and differences in rate of 
craving reduction will be tested as an interaction between treatment state and time. Drs. Brick, 
Cleveland, and Kong each have extensive experience analyzing similar data in the multilevel modeling 
framework.
For secondary safety outcomes, intensive longitudinal methods such as time-varying effect models will 
be used to assess for changes in continuously measured outcomes (e.g. blood pressure, heart rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], body weight) to account for repeated measures. The proportion of participants 
experiencing AE and SAE will be compared between treatments using chi-square analysis. 
For exploratory outcomes, analysis of fNIRs-based neuroimaging will utilize a 2 (Medication Status) x 2 
(Medication Type) ANOVA to evaluate the change in oxygenation in prefrontal cortex in response to 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_704269], with a region of interest in left middle frontal gyrus. Analysis of safety 
outcomes from baseline to the end of target dose and to end of rebound follow-up will be analyzed 
using intensive longitudinal methods similar to the analysis of secondary outcomes. Changes in indices 
of glycemic control measured at baseline and at end of the target dose (e.g. HgA1c, fructosamine) will 
be calculated as deltas, with comparisons made between treatments using unpaired t-tests or Mann 
Whitney U tests as appropriate. 
Interim Power Analysis: one or more interim power analyses may be conducted during the study to 
assess the effect size needed to observe a significant drug effect for primary, secondary, and/or 
exploratory endpoints based on the data collected at that time. These analyses would not bias type [ADDRESS_956910] (UH phase).  In 
particular, the confidence intervals around the parameters representing the primary endpoint will be 
used as an approximation of the power available for our primary endpoints using the current data.  This 
STUDY00013559
Approval: 11/21/2023
Page 29 of 46 (V.01/21/2019) will be weighed against the original proposed power and the PI’s estimates of likely power after 
completion of the grant period to determine whether an interim analysis is warranted.
9.0 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
9.1 Periodic evaluation of data
To monitor safety throughout the course of the study, every effort will be made to remain alert to 
possible Aes/SAEs. If an AE/SAE occurs, the first concern should be for the safety of the subject; 
CaronTC’s medical staff is available 24/[ADDRESS_956911] been given the names and telephone numbers of study site staff for reporting 
Aes/SAEs and medical emergencies.
In this study, any AE/SAE experienced by [CONTACT_704314] [ADDRESS_956912] any new Aes/SAEs or updates to previously reported Aes on the 
electronic case report form.
9.2 Data that are reviewed
Data collected as primary outcomes, secondary outcomes, exploratory outcomes, and safety profile for 
the study will be reviewed. Primary outcomes include cue-elicited drug craving and ambient drug 
craving. Secondary outcomes include blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], body weight, and AE. 
Exploratory outcomes include prefrontal cortical response to drug cues, markers of long-term glycemic 
control and rebound in ambient drug craving, blood pressure, heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].
9.3 Method of collection of safety information
Safety information will be collected in the REDCap research database throughout the study. The safety 
of the study drug will be evaluated by [CONTACT_704315].
9.4 Frequency of data collection
Primary outcome data for cue-elicited drug craving will be collected on the day before drug treatment 
(Day 1) and Day 19 (additionally Day 31for the 5-dose intervention). Ambient drug craving data will be 
collected on test days and on the first two days and last 2 days of each treatment dose (Days 1-21 [Days 
1-33 for 5-dose intervention]). Secondary outcome data for the physical/psychological screening will be 
collected on Day 1. Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_704270] 
(Days 1, 2, 8, 14, 19, 21 [5-dose intervention: 1, 2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 31, 33]). HbA1c and fructosamine 
monitoring (blood draw) data will be collected on Days 2 and 19 [additionally Day 31 for 5-dose 
intervention]. See also table of study events, section 7.2.
9.5 Individuals reviewing the data
The DSMB will be responsible for safeguarding the interests of participants in this trial. This 
responsibility will be exercised by [CONTACT_704316], based on assessment of safety. The DSMB may also formulate recommendations related to the 
selection, recruitment or retention of participants, their management and adherence to protocol-
specified interventions, and the procedures for data management and quality control. The DSMB will be 
advisory to the PI, to the medical monitor ([CONTACT_704344]), and to their co-investigators. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_704271].

10.[ADDRESS_956915] liraglutide during study treatment 
Potential risks associated with the study drug: There is a potential risk of experiencing side effects from the 
investigational drug. Common side effects of liraglutide include: nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased 
appetite. These side effects dissipate over time and are minimized with appropriate dose titration. Other 
potential side effects, though expected to be rare, include: hypoglycemia, constipation, headache, dyspepsia, 
fatigue, dizziness, abdominal pain, increased lipase, and vaso-vagal response if there is a history of vaso-vagal 
response. Serious side effects include: risk of thyroid c-cell tumors, acute pancreatitis, acute gallbladder disease, 
risk of hypoglycemia with concomitant use of anti-diabetic therapy, heart rate increase, renal impairment, and 
STUDY00013559
Approval: 11/21/2023
Page 31 of 46 (V.01/21/2019) suicidal behavior and thoughts. There is also potential risk of irritation at the injection site, and increased drug 
craving in response to needle use.
An allergic reaction to liraglutide can include hives; fast heartbeat, dizziness, trouble breathing or swallowing, 
and swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat. There is also potential risk of irritation at the injection site, and 
increased drug craving in response to needle use. The side effects of acute withdrawal from liraglutide include 
nausea and vomiting. With a half-life of 13 hours, liraglutide should be completely eliminated in 65 hours, within 
the 4-day rebound follow-up observation period. Since liraglutide has not been previously used in patients with 
OUD, it is considered an investigational drug. Since this drug has not been previously given in OUD, there may be 
risks that are not known at this time.
Overdose of the study drug, according to the literature, is limited to severe nausea and vomiting and occasional 
abdominal pain and diarrhea. None of the reported cases resulted in hypoglycemia.
Hypoglycemia signs and symptoms
• Feeling shaky
• Being nervous or anxious
• Sweating, chills and clamminess
• Irritability or impatience
• Confusion
• Fast heartbeat
• Feeling lightheaded or dizzy
• Hunger
• Nausea
• Color draining from the skin (pallor)
• Feeling Sleepy
• Feeling weak or having no energy
• Blurred/impaired vision
• Tingling or numbness in the lips, tongue, or cheeks
• Headaches
• Coordination problems, clumsiness
• Difficulty concentrating
• Slurred speech
• Nightmares or crying out during sleep
• Seizures
• Loss of consciousness
 
Blood Pressure and Heart Rate:  Frequent blood pressure measurements with the cuff around the arm or finger 
may be inconvenient and may produce some discomfort and occasional bruising of the upper arm. There is a 
minimal risk of skin irritation from the EKG patches.
 
Blood Sampling: There are minor risks and discomforts associated with blood sampling. We will draw blood 
from the antecubital veins which may cause a brief period of pain and possibly a small bruise at the site. 
Occasionally, a person feels faint when their blood is drawn. There is a small risk of bleeding after removal of the 
needle, which can be prevented by [CONTACT_704318]. Rarely, an infection develops which can be treated. 
Rarely, a clot could form. It is possible that exposure to needles during blood sampling may serve as a trigger for 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_704275].
 
Pregnancy: This treatment may hurt an unborn child. Subjects will be advised to use approved birth control such 
as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], birth control shots, IUD, diaphragm, or condoms while in this study. Subjects will be 
instructed to inform us if they become pregnant or father a child while in this study. Women able to become 
pregnant will have a urine test to make sure they are not pregnant before receiving treatment in this study and 
STUDY00013559

Page 32 of 46 (V.01/21/2019) at Day 19 [an additional pregnancy test will be given at Day 31 for the 5-dose intervention]. They will be 
encouraged to use birth control or refrain from intercourse throughout the study. Study drug will be 
discontinued in case of pregnancy.
 
Potential risks associated with exposure to drug-related cues: There is a risk of relapse to those in recovery 
when they are exposed to drug cues in the cue reactivity task. Participants may experience an increase in craving 
in response to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related images.  
 
Risks related to exposure to fNIRs: There are no known discomforts or risks associated with the brain imaging 
study. Risks of fNIRs were previously found to be minimal. FDA approval has been granted for research purposes 
for the technology that is used in this specific device (FDA 510(K) Numbers K011320; K042501). In this fNIRs 
Devices system: 1) No voltage in excess of 12.2 volts is available; 2) The sensor pads can be washed, disinfected 
and autoclaved; 3) The safety of fNIRs for use on brain tissue can be demonstrated by [CONTACT_704319]. The instrument used in the current research employs 
light emitting diodes (LEDs) to generate the near infrared light for measuring changes in hemoglobin. LEDs are 
electronic devices that are illuminated when electricity is passed through them. LEDs use a semiconductor diode 
that emits light when charged. There currently exists no specific safety regulations applied to LEDs, although 
they fall within the Class I standards for safety.  In other words, the risks associated with spending 20-30 minutes 
in a protocol utilizing fNIRs are less than the risks associated with spending an equivalent amount of time in the 
sunlight in the US without a hat. In summary, exposing the brain to the infrared light generated by [CONTACT_704320] (about 1 hour) exposed to sunlight.  There is 
minimal risk of headache from the use of sensors.
 
Actigraphy/Wearables:  There is no known risk to wearing the wrist actigraphs. A minor skin rash may develop 
from the wristband, but this risk is very slight.
 
Questionnaires: The interviews and forms are routine, standardized forms for psychology research. They pose 
no known risks, although certain questions may be mildly upsetting because they may probe sensitive 
psychological areas and others inquire about family history of medical and psychological illness or alcohol and 
substance use. Appropriate referrals are offered if areas of concern arise in the course of collecting this 
information. Research participants are free to skip any questions that make them uncomfortable.
Other risks
There is a risk that blood tests will reveal that patients are positive for hepatitis or HIV. These infections are 
required by [CONTACT_704321].
There is a risk of loss of confidentiality if a patient’s information or identity is obtained by [CONTACT_461905], but precautions will be taken to prevent this from happening. The confidentiality of the 
patients’ electronic data will be maintained as required by [CONTACT_704322]. Absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.
There is a risk from randomization as patients will be assigned to a treatment program by [CONTACT_3364]. The treatment

humans, whether or not considered drug related
Adverse reaction An Adverse Reaction is an adverse event for which the causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event is suspected.
Suspected adverse 
reactionAny adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the adverse event.  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than “adverse reaction”.
Reasonable possibility.  For the purpose of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.
Serious adverse 
event or Serious 
suspected adverse 
reactionSerious adverse event or Serious suspected adverse reaction: An adverse event 
or suspected adverse reaction that, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth 
defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_704277] a serious adverse event.
Life-threatening 
adverse event or 
life-threatening 
suspected adverse 
reactionAn adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator (i.e., the study site 
principal investigator) or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or research 
subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.
Unexpected 
adverse event or 
Unexpected An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if 
it is not listed in the investigator brochure, not listed as per the reference 
safety information (Prescribing information), or elsewhere in the current IND 
application; or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been

effectAny serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem 
or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence 
in the investigational plan or IDE application (including a supplementary plan 
or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.
18.2 Recording of Adverse Events
All Aes (serious or non-serious) and abnormal test findings observed or reported to study team which 
are believed to be associated with the study drug will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) or the 
abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator.
Pregnancy: Pregnancy complications will be recorded as AE. Outcome of the pregnancy will be followed 
up. If the infant has a congenital anomaly/birth defect this must be reported and followed up as an SAE. 
Any pregnancy occurring during the trial period will be reported to the IRB, NIDA, and Novo Nordisk 
within the same timelines described for reporting of AE.

reasonable possibility that the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_5257](s) or device(s); and 3) if the 
adverse event meets the criteria for a serious adverse event.
If the investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship to the 
study drug(s) or device(s)”, the adverse event will be classified as associated with the use of the study 
drug(s) or device(s) for reporting purposes.  If the investigator’s final determination of causality is 
“unknown but not related to the study drug(s) or device(s)”, this determination and the rationale for the 
determination will be documented in the respective subject’s case history.

Page 43 of 46 (V.01/21/2019) Study Objectives
Preliminary data suggest that the study medication, liraglutide, may help to improve sleep. Liraglutide decreases 
orexin transmission, which, in turn, reduces arousal, leading to improved total sleep time and increases 
percentage of slow wave (Stage III) sleep. The supplemental part of the study will evaluate the effect of 
liraglutide on objective measures of sleep, assessed with overnight polysomnography (PSG). 
1.To evaluate the efficacy of liraglutide (vs placebo), administered daily, in improving objective total 
sleep time (TST) as measured by [CONTACT_704329][INVESTIGATOR_704289]. 
Specifically, we hypothesize that: liraglutide will be more effective than placebo in increasing objective 
TST in OUD patients undergoing residential treatment for OUD. 
2.To evaluate the efficacy of liraglutide (vs placebo), administered daily, on the objective measures of 
%slow wave sleep (%SWS), as measured by [CONTACT_63175], in opi[INVESTIGATOR_704290]. Specifically, we hypothesize that liraglutide, relative to placebo, will increase the %SWS, 
which will contribute to overall sleep quality. 
Primary end point
The primary objectives of the supplemental study is to determine whether liraglutide can improve objective TST 
measured by [CONTACT_704330] 3-[ADDRESS_956939] dose of 
liraglutide (Night 1) and the night after receiving the final target drug dose (Night 19). For the 5-dose 
intervention, change in TST will be measured by [CONTACT_704331] (prior to receiving the first dose of 
liraglutide, Night 1), the night after receiving the final 1.8 mg (third) drug dose (Night 19), and the night after 
receiving the final 3.0 mg (fifth) drug dose (Night 31).
Secondary end point
The secondary end point of the study is to determine whether liraglutide improves %SWS measured by [CONTACT_704330] 
a 3-5 week period while participants are in residential treatment for OUD. For the 3-dose intervention, change in 
%SWS will be measured by [CONTACT_704331], i.e., prior to receiving the first dose of liraglutide (Night 
1) and the night after receiving the final target drug dose (Night 19). For the 5-dose intervention, change in 
%SWS will be measured by [CONTACT_704331], i.e., prior to receiving the first dose of liraglutide (Night 
1), the night after receiving the final 1.8 mg (third) drug dose (Night 19), and the night after receiving the final 
3.0 mg (fifth) drug dose (Night 31).
Exploratory end point
The exploratory end point is to determine if the improvement in TST and %SWS is accompanied by [CONTACT_704332], insomnia severity, and prefrontal cortical brain response to visual drug cues following 18-[ADDRESS_956940], %SWS, and craving and insomnia severity as measured by [CONTACT_6270]-report and prefrontal 
response to drug cues. 
Background
Scientific Background and Gaps
Sleep problems are common – and undertreated – symptoms in most substance use disorder syndromes, 
including OUD [56-62]. Sleep problems are 8-9 times more prevalent among patients in early treatment for 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2537] (OUD) than the general population [63-67]. Aside from misuse, or abuse, even regular, 
chronic use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_704291], leading to increased Stage I [68-
70] and Stage II sleep [70], reduced levels of sleep efficiency, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep [57, 58, 69-74], 
and percentage of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) slow wave sleep (%SWS) [57, 58, 71-74]. Peles et al. [75] 
also found that the %SWS was correlated with of the severity of OUD. Thus, the persistence of insomnia, 
STUDY00013559
Approval: 11/21/2023
Page 44 of 46 (V.01/21/2019) especially when associated with decreased SWS, is a predictor of relapse following discharge from residential 
treatment with an OUD. Sleep problems may persist for months following withdrawal, contributing to high rates 
of relapse [76-78]. To date, there are no approved medications for insomnia in patients with OUD. The standard 
hypnotic medications used to treat sleep disorders cannot be used in OUD patients because of their addictive 
properties. The two most commonly used FDA-approved medications for OUD treatment, methadone and 
buprenorphine, do not improve sleep for the majority of patients [67], and indeed, may make is worse due to 
their agonism or partial agonism on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328]. Trazodone and other antidepressants like 
doxepin/mirtazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], are commonly prescribed off-label for the treatment of insomnia in the general 
population [79, 80], and are the standard of care for the treatment of insomnia in SUDs [80, 81]. However, 
previous studies with trazodone and other antidepressants in post-withdrawal SUD participants have shown 
mixed efficacy, with little to no relief for a large percentage of the population [82, 83]. Collectively, these 
findings suggest that there is a significant need to develop more efficacious treatments for insomnia in patients 
with SUDs in general, and OUD in particular.
Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1), Orexins and Sleep
In addition to its potential to reduce craving in OUD patients, there is evidence that the study drug, a GLP-1r 
agonist, may also improve sleep. In a mouse model, the GLP- 1R agonist Exendin-4 was shown to increase NREM 
sleep time (Stage III %SWS sleep) by 93% over the first 6 hours of the dark cycle in mice [84]. We are unaware of 
any study of the effects of a GLP-1r agonist on sleep architecture in humans. We believe its effect on sleep may 
due to the effect of GLP- 1R agonism on orexin transmission.
Orexin is one of the wake neurotransmitters that play a role in the wake-sleep cycle. It is believed that orexin is 
involved with sending wake signals to other parts of the brain. Inhibiting the action of orexin by [CONTACT_704333]. The orexin type-[ADDRESS_956941], Ex-4 has been 
shown to increase both orexin 1 [85] and orexin 2 (unpublished) receptor mRNA expression in the nucleus 
accumbens shell. This effect suggests that GLP1 agonism decreases orexin transmission, leading to a 
compensatory increase in orexin receptors in the nucleus accumbens. The orexin receptor antagonist, 
suvorexant, decreases arousal and improves sleep in humans (marketed as Belsomra) and is FDA approved for 
the treatment of primary Insomnia. Given that a GLP1 agonist can decrease orexin neurotransmission, and 
thereby [CONTACT_704334], treatment with a GLP-1r agonist may improve sleep - in addition to decreasing craving. 
As such, we hypothesize that the GLP-1r agonist, liraglutide, is a novel and promising therapeutic to improve 
sleep in patients with OUD, as it may not only decrease craving, but also improve sleep by [CONTACT_704335]-
mediated arousal and reward pathways.
Study Rationale
The rationale for the proposed research is to develop an intervention that can improve sleep outcomes in 
addition to reducing craving in OUD patients, a combination of factors which contribute to early relapse. 
Although liraglutide was approved for human use in 2010, there are no data testing the effectiveness in craving 
and sleep in patients with an OUD. Because of its importance to health and well-being, and its role in relapse, 
both objective (wrist actigraphy) and intensive subjective (Ecological Momentary Assessment, EMA) measures of 
sleep were included in the parent UG3 grant study, in addition to well-validated self-reported sleep inventories. 
However, the existing animal research model shows that GLP-1r agonism improved the percentage of slow wave 
sleep (%SWS), an important aspect of sleep architecture that cannot be measured with self-report or wrist 
actigraphy. 
The objective of the proposed supplemental research is to use the gold-standard, polysomnography, to evaluate 
the hypothesis that treatment with a GLP-1R agonist can improve sleep in humans with OUD. If liraglutide shows 
a trend towards efficacy in improving sleep, and safety of the GLP-1R agonist is demonstrated in this population, 
it would provide an indication to run a multi-center clinical trial of GLP-1R agonist in OUD patients.

Page 45 of 46 (V.01/21/2019) The inclusion, exclusion criteria, recruitment methods and consent process for the polysomnography studies are 
the same as those described above for the primary study. 
Study Design and Procedure
Study Design
The polysomnography portions will be inserted into the study design (described above) on Nights 1, 19, and 31, 
as described below.
Study procedures
Following randomization and full screening, the first PSG recording will be collected on baseline night (Night 1) 
before starting liraglutide/placebo. A second PSG study will be conducted [ADDRESS_956942] PSG study will be conducted 6 days after 
reaching the 3.0 mg dose of liraglutide, on Night 31. PSG studies will be performed at Caron treatment center in 
the patients’ own rooms. An appropriately trained study team member (Project Coordinator or Research 
Support team member) will set-up the sleep recording. Training for the Sleep Project Coordinator will be 
provided by [CONTACT_704336] & Treatment Center involved in 
research and/or clinical care and supervised by [CONTACT_704337]-investigators (Krishnamurthy, Fernandez-Mendoza) 
in this study. Training will include all aspects necessary for a gold-standard, ambulatory PSG recording, including 
1) application and removal of electrodes, 2) set-up of PSG equipment, 3) calibration of signals, 4) software and 
hardware management, 5) disposal and/or clean-up of supplies for research purposes, and 6) secure transfer of 
the sleep data files to the PSHealth network using Kiteworks. Data transferred via Kiteworks will be scored by [CONTACT_704338] (sleep scorer) not involved in data acquisition. 
The polysomnography (PSG) assessments will only be set up and taken down (patient unhooked from 
equipment and electrodes) by [CONTACT_704339] (Project Coordinators). 
The use of portable PSG units (not in-lab PSG) requires a trained technician to get good signal, but does not 
require a Registered Polysomnographic Technologist (RPSGT) to successfully gather good-quality data. RPSGTs 
are required for accreditation of clinical sleep centers, but not for research studies as long as the investigator 
team includes sleep specialists with demonstrated experience who assure appropriate training and skills with 
adequate expertise and resources. The study team includes two board-certified sleep specialists and sleep 
researchers who have demonstrated experience in PSG and in training research technicians for successful 
outcomes. The Penn State Project coordinator will be trained by [CONTACT_704340]-certified sleep specialists, 
including hands-on training with other human research technicians trained in PSG and/or RPSGTs currently 
working in the clinical sleep center and within the sleep research division 
The appropriately trained study team member will be using a Natus Trex HD ambulatory PSG system, and 
standard PSG methodology. The PSGs will include two central, frontal, and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_704292], two electrooculograms, chin and limb electromyograms, and an electrocardiogram during the baseline 
and follow up. Additional sensors to detect sleep disordered breathing events, including chest and abdominal 
bands, a thermocouple, a nasal cannula, and a pulse oximeter, all of which are standard in PSG studies, will be 
included. Application of the PSG sensors will begin around 9:15, and participants will be instructed to go to bed 
at the time closest to their habitual bedtime, within a time range of 10pm to 11pm, and to get up at 6am (which 
is within their Caron-scheduled wake time.  (All morning patient medication at Caron is provide at the Neag 
Medical Center from 6:15am to 6:50am, so this time is consistent with their typi[INVESTIGATOR_704293].)
Data from the PSG study will be collected on a study-dedicated laptop. The data will be securely transferred to 
the Sleep Research and Treatment Center (SRTC), Penn State Health and Penn State College of Medicine via 
https://kiteworks.pennstatehealth.net for further storage, scoring, interpretation and analysis using Cerner’s 
environment within Penn State Health secure network. Data sent to the SRTC from the study team will be 
identified by [CONTACT_2299]’s random ID number only. This will allow investigators to pair the polysomnographic 
sleep study data with the clinical data collected in the primary study, described above.

Page 46 of 46 (V.01/21/2019) Sleep records will be manually scored by a trained technologist following the current version of American 
Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) Manual. Standard PSG sleep parameters, including total sleep time, wake 
after sleep onset, and the percentage and duration of each sleep stage will be calculated using Sleepworks 
(Natus) software.
Participants will be allowed to request a sleep physician report of their sleep stages, breathing patterns (e.g., 
sleep apnea) or other physiologic measures that they may share with their primary care provider, if desired, for 
further clinical care outside of the study.
All other aspects of the study (e.g., drug and placebo administration, adverse event monitoring, enollment and 
randomization, duration of the study procedure, etc), including self-reported craving (0-100 VAS) will be 
conducted as described in the primary study above. Subjects will also complete the 7-item self-reported 
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the gold-standard subjective measure of insomnia severity in clinical trials (PMID: 
21532953; PMID: 33164741). The ISI  is already embedded into REDCap from our previous studies and will be 
added to this optional sleep study to measure the potential improvement in subjective insomnia severity from 
baseline (initial evaluation, Night 1) to post intervention (Nights 19 and 31), as mentioned in the exploratory 
endpoints above.
Risks
There are no known risks associated with the polysomnographic recordings of sleep. On rare occasions, some 
individuals can have mild allergic reactions to the tape applied over the electrodes, or allergies to latex. We will 
minimize this risk by [CONTACT_704341]. There can be some mild discomfort in applying the skin 
electrodes as the skin is cleaned, or while wearing the electrodes at night.
Subject payment and travel information
In addition to the reimbursement for participating in the main parts of the study, participants will receive an 
additional reimbursement of $[ADDRESS_956943] PSG, $90 for the second PSG, and $[ADDRESS_956944] PSG [5-dose 
intervention only] for a total of $180 [$270 for three nights] for participating in the supplemental 
polysomnographic sleep recordings. Reimbursements will be paid using Target gift cards as neither alcohol nor 
tobacco products can be purchased at Target.

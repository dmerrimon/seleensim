Protocol Date: 25June2020 1.0 Background  
 
Chronic hyperglycemia worsens both microvascular and macrovascular complications for patients with T1DM
1,2. After acute diabetes complications, 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for adult T1DM patients3, 
making the prevention of chronic hyperglycemia critically important. Carbohydrate quantity and ty pe affect post -prandial glycemia more than any other dietary factor in 
non-diabetic populations
4,5. Additionally, consuming larger meals is associated with 
underestimation of carbohydrate quantity and mealtime insulin dose, leading to 
increased glucose variability5. These findings serve as the theoretical basis for 
implementing a carbohydrate restricted diet to improve HbA1c and decrease glycemic 
variability. Current dietary recommendations from the ADA for patients with T1DM6 align 
with guidelines from the Institute of Medicine for healthful eating in the general population
7. While the ADA recommends individualization  of dietary plans for patients 
with T1DM, most recent guidelines state that “evidence is inconclusive for an ideal 
amount of carbohydrate intake for people with diabetes”6. 
 
While LCDs have been associated with improved HbA1c in adults with T1DM, 
no randomized, prospective studies have evaluated the effect of a LCD on 
outcomes in the pediatric T1DM population.  Cross sectional and prospective studies in adults with T1DM have demonstrated improvement in HbA1c after a LCD
8-11, 
but these studies have significant limitations including small sample size9 and 
methodologic flaws such as using HbA1c as both a dietary adherence marker and 
outcome  measure10. Large observational12 and survey studies13 have re vealed 
associations between lower carbohydrate intake and lower HbA1c in pediatric patients 
with T1DM. However, existing studies have major limitations, including significant 
selection bias and methodologic concerns, such as recruiting highly motivated 
participants from a social media group and using self- reported HbA1c as the primary 
outcome13.  No study to date has prospectively investigated the impact of a LCD 
intervention on glycemic control in children with T1DM  in a randomized controlled 
design. To fill this knowledge gap, in Aim [ADDRESS_163766] -prandi al glycemia while also 
influencing low- density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C)
14.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_144029] -C above 100 mg/dL is associated with increased 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in patients with T1DM15. One study surveyed a social 
media group of pediatric T1DM patients who consumed a very low- carbohydrate diet 
(VLCD) and found glycemic control was excellent (HbA1c = 5.7%), but total cholesterol 
and LDL -C were elevated13.  These findings contrast with larger studies showing that 
LCD reduced LCL -C in adult populations of both non -diabetic and diabetic patients16.  
Further, experts have noted that directly measuring the number and size of LDL particles (LCL -P) using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) may better capture CVD risk
17 
as suggested by [CONTACT_144050]18 and prospective studies 19-22.  In one 
prospective, para llel isocaloric nutrition study in overweight men, the percent dietary 
carbohydrate consumption was directly proportional to smaller (i.e. worse) LDL -P size23. 
No study has yet prospectively investigated the influen ce of a LCD on lipid profiles in 
Protocol Version  #: 6   4 
Protocol Date: 25June2020 children with T1DM. In Aim 2, we will use NMR spectroscopy to comprehensively 
quantitate the atherogenic lipoprotein load by [CONTACT_144051]. 
 
Dietary intake influences several life domains that may affect QOL,  including 
social interactions, personal satiety, economic, physical, and psychological domains24. 
Significant challenges in prospective dietary intervention trials include high rates of attrition and difficulty maintaining participant compliance
25, both of which are ultimately 
linked to the impact of the diet on QOL. While improved QOL with LCD interventions has been demonstrated in patient populations including obese adults
[ADDRESS_163767] -carbohydrate diet (SCD).  We further hypothesize that differences in 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_144030] (QOL) between the groups will be minimal. To test 
our hypotheses, we will employ a pragmatic nutrition education intervention.  The study 
will randomize adolescent patients (ages 13- 21 years) to one of three groups (n = 15 
per group). We will instruct participants to consume a LCD (group 1) or a SCD (group 2), or provide no specific recommendations regarding diet (group 3). We will prescribe isocaloric diets for groups 1 and 2 equaling the estimated energy requirements of the 
Institute of Medicin e
7. Part icipants on the SCD intervention will consume 45- 65% of total 
daily caloric intake from carbohydrates, 25- 35% from fat and 10- 30% from protein.  
Participants on the LCD intervention will consume 25- 35% of total daily intake from 
carbohydrates, 45- 65% from fat and 10- 30% from protein. Group [ADDRESS_163768] of receiving any nutritional prescription.  
 Nutrition interventions are effective in producing dietary behavior change among 
adolescents
27, partic ularly when information and communication technologies (ICT) are 
incorporated28. Previous brief nutrition interventions teaching LCD or low glycemic index 
diets in T1DM patients have resulted in appropriate dietary adherence29,30. We will 
provide both traditional and ICT -based education and monitor dietary adherence with a 
smart -phone based nutritional tracking tool.  
 
Aim 1 will provide preliminary estim ates of improvement HbA1c after a 
nutrition intervention that teaches a LCD versus education reinforcing a SCD to families of pediatric T1DM patients. To determine the primary outcome —change 
in HbA1c —we will obtain HbA1c at baseline and at 12 weeks after the nutrition 
intervention.  Additionally, we will quantify glycemic variability using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) as a secondary outcome. Low rates of severe hypoglycemia, diabetic 
Protocol Version  #: 6   5 
Protocol Date: 25June2020 ketoacidosis and growth attenuation have been reported in pediatric  T1DM patients on a 
VLCD13, therefore, we anticipate low rates of these adverse events with the LCD 
intervention.  
 
Aim 2  will provide preliminary estimates of the change in the atherogenic 
lipoprotein profile in pat ients on a LCD versus SCD.  The primary outcome 
measure will be change in total LDL -P from baseline to 12 weeks after the nutrition 
intervention.  As secondary outcomes, we will measure the change in other contributors 
to atherogenic lipoprotein load, such  as high -density lipoprotein particle (HDL -P) 
number, small LDL -P number, and LDL size.   
 
Aim 3  will provide preliminary estimates of the change in QOL in patients on a 
LCD versus SCD.  Participants will complete the PedsQL, a validated QOL measure in 
T1DM patients,  and Problem Areas in Diabetes -Teen (PAID -T), a validated measure of 
diabetes -specific distress,  at baseline  (week 0)  and at 12 weeks after the nutrition 
intervention31,32.  Additionally, parents of participants will complete the WHO -5 Well -
Being Index, a questionnaire for assessing subjective psychological well -being33, and 
Problem Areas in Diabetes -Parent Revised version (PAID -PR), a validated measure of 
perceived parental burden associ ated with caring for a child with diabetes.[ADDRESS_163769] to compare outcomes between groups, 
in addition to multilinear regression analysis to account for potentially confounding covariate s, such as total daily dose of insulin, weight change, glycemic variability as 
measured by [CONTACT_41131] (CGM), and age.  
 This proposed research will be the first prospective study to determine the effect of a 
LCD intervention on key diabe tes outcomes in a pediatric T1DM population. This study 
will also provide a basis of training for a new pediatric investigator in the conduct of 
clinical trials under the mentorship of a highly successful mentorship team including [CONTACT_144065] der and [CONTACT_144066].   
 
3.0 Animal Studies and Previous Human Studies  
3.1 Previous Human Studies – Adult T1DM Population  
A recent systematic review described eight studies that investigated the effect of a low- carbohydrate diet on glycemic control using Hb A1c as th e 
primary outcome.  Of these studies, four reported non -significant changes 
in HbA1c with a LCD while three reported statistically significant 
reductions
8. 
 
3.2 Previous Human Studies – Pediatric T1DM Population  
Published studies focused on the effects of a low carbohydrate d iet on 
outcomes in pediatric T1DM have been limited to observational and 
survey studies.   
 One study surveyed an online social media group of pediatric T1DM patients who consumed a very low- carbohydrate diet (VLCD) with an 
average carbohydrate intake goal  of 36 +/- 15 grams of carbohydrates 
per day and found glycemic control was excellent with a reported mean 
Protocol Version  #: 6   6 
Protocol Date: 25June2020 HbA1c of 5.7%13.  There were low rages of adverse events, including 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_144031] (1%), hypoglycemia with seizure or 
coma (2%), hypoglycemia requiring assistance from others (12%), and 
hypoglycemia requiring glucagon (4%)13.   
 A large cross -sectional observational study in 46,010 patients wit h T1DM 
aged 1 – 18 years in [LOCATION_013] and Austria found that lower carbohydrate 
intake was associated with lower HbA1c (p < 0.001) with the average 
HbA1c being 0.2% lower in the lowest quartile of carbohydrate intake 
than in the highest quartile

adherence a member of the team will contact [CONTACT_144055].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Text Messaging  
Participants will receive text messages 2 to 4 times per week36 
that will provide reminders regarding key components of the 
dietary intervention , encouragement regarding diabetes 
management , and gen eral positive quotes . The study team will 
create a bank of 50 text messages for each dietary intervention (LCD and SCD),  and participants will receive 2 to 4 of these text 
messages per week.  Examples of message content include: “Try 
a breakfast high in protein! An omelet with a side of bacon would 
be a great choice ” and “The only way of finding limits of the 
possible is by  [CONTACT_144056] – Arthur 
C. Clarke.”   The text message will be sent using the text 
messaging feature in RedCap with the Twilio messaging service  
and will contain no protected health information.   Text messaging 
will continue unti l participants have c ompleted study visit 3.  
 
6.1.5  Telephone Visits (Week s 2, 4, and 8)  
The study team will monitor adherence by [CONTACT_144057]’s dietary log, CGM data, and insulin pump data.  The team will conduct a 30 to 60-minute  telephone sessi on (either via Facetime, Sk ype, or phone 
call) with the participant. The study team will review with the participants 
their nutritional intake and reinforce key concepts from the diet to which 
they are assigned (LCD or SCD).  If the CGM is being worn less than 80% 
of the time or insulin pump is not being used to record more than [ADDRESS_163780] an additional telephone visit at  week 12.  We will

7.0 Risks 
 
7.1 The following risks associated with particip ation are considered: 
7.1.1  Suboptimal growth  
Adherence to a  low carbohydrate diet has  the potential to result in a low 
total caloric intake  and lead to suboptimal growth.  One small case series 
describes o utcomes in 6 pediatric patients who consumed between 22 – 
75 grams of carbohydrates per day, including poor lin ear growth 
velocity13. However,  both diet plans will be designed to maintain weight 
by [CONTACT_144058] r formula to calculate each 
participant’s individual estimated energy requirement  and will provide a 
significantl y larger number of grams of carbohydrates per day than the 
previously described case series .  Anthropomorphic measures will be 
taken at each study visit and participants will be removed from the study if they experience weight l oss more than 10% from basel ine. 
 
7.1.2  Hypoglycemia  
Protocol Version  #: 6   18 
Protocol Date: 25June2020 Hypoglycemia is encountered intermittently by [CONTACT_23270] T1DM as 
part of the natural consequence of diabetes management with exogenous 
insulin administration, and we do not anticipate that this risk will be  
increased by [CONTACT_144059] a lo w carbohydrate diet.  
 
One study surveyed an online social media group of pediatric T1DM patients who consumed a very lo w-carbohydrate diet (VLCD) with an 
average carbohydrate intake goal of 36 grams per day and found low 
rages o f adverse events, including hypoglycemia with seizure or coma 
(2%), hypoglycemia requiring assistance from others (12%), and hypoglycemia requiring  glucagon (4%)
13.  We anticipate that the rates of 
these events will  be considerably lower in th e current study given that the 
carbohydrate intake in both the low- carbohydrate and standard -
carbohydrate groups will be substantially higher than in the previously 
mentioned study.  
 We will use the following safety provisions t o minimize risk of 
hypoglyce mia: Participants will wear a continuous glucose monitor 
throughout the study period and will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_144060][INVESTIGATOR_51943] (blood gl ucose <70).  If 
hypoglycemia occurred, the study team would instruct the patient t o be 
treated orally (administer 15 grams of carbohydrates in liquid form or 
with glucose tablets) if the patient is res ponsive and able to consume the 
treatment orally.  If the patient is unresponsive, the study team would instruc t the participant’s caretaker to administer intramuscular glucagon.  
The study team will ensure that the participants have an up to date 
glucagon  kit at time of enrollment.  
 
7.1.3  Diabetic Ketoacidosis  
During very low carbohydrate intake, the transition to u tilizing fatty acids 
as a fuel source leads to production of ketone bodies in state known as 
dietary ketosis37.  In severely uncontrolled T1DM (ie when exogenous 
insulin is not adequately suppli ed), ketone bodies are produced in 
supranormal quanti ties and cause ketoacidosis37. In the T1DM population, 
consuming a low carbohydrate diet could potentially lead to dietary 
ketosis.  Howev er, the low carbohydrate diet that we are utilizing in t his 
study is not intended to induce ketosis. Particip ants will continue to 
consume enough carbohydrates at each meal to necessitate insulin 
administration, which suppresses ketosis.  
 
However, we anti cipate that rates of ketoacidosis will be low given low 
observed rates of DKA in a population of adolescent T 1DM patients on a 
very low carbohydrate diet (about 1%)13. Carbohydrate intake was 
significantly restricte d in the very low carbohydrate study to less than half 
of the amount that we propose in the current study.  T herefore, we 
anticipate that  rates of DKA will be equivalent to that typi[INVESTIGATOR_144039] T1DM.  
 
Protocol Version  #: 6   19 
Protocol Date: 25June2020 To monitor for ketosis, we will m easure beta hydroxybutyrate levels at 
study visits [ADDRESS_163781] 
children as outlined in 45 CFR 46, Subpart  D. 
 
7.2.1  Justification and rationale for inclusion of adoles cent subjects with 
T1DM  
Chronic hyperglycemia worsens  both microvascular and macr ovascular 
complications for patients with T1DM1,2. After  acute diabetes  
complications, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death 
for adult T1DM patients3, and it is clear that the mechanisms that 
contribute to macrovascular disease are present early in the natural history of  T1DM
38.  The atheros clerotic changes of macrovascular disease 
in T1DM app ear to begin in childhood an d adolescence39,40. Therefore, 
identifying strategies for the prevention of ch ronic hyperglycemia  to 
prevent micro - and macrovascular complications is critically important in 
the childhoo d and adolescent T1DM population.  
 
Carbohydrate quantity and type affect post -prandial glycemia more than 
any other dietary factor in non -diabetic populations4,5. Additionally, 
consuming larger meals is associated wit h underestimation of 
carbo hydrate quantity and mealtime insulin dose, leading to increased 
glucose variability5. These findings serve as the theoretical basis for 
implementing a carbohydrate restricted diet to imp rove HbA1c and 
decrease glycemic variability  with the ultimate goal to prevent CVD.  
 
7.3 Assessment of risk to adolescent participants relative to 45 C FR part 46, 
subpart D  
It is our impression that T1DM subjects would fall under 45 CFR 46.406, 
as outlined in Vanderbilt’s Human Research Protections Program Policy 
Number IX.A, section II.C.  The proposed research is likely to yield generalizable knowledge  about these adolescents’ condition. Specifically,  
 
7.3.1  The risk represents a minor increase over minimal risk.  
7.3.2  The procedure presents experi ences to participants that are 
reasonably commensurate with those inherent in their actual or expected medical situatio n. 
7.3.3  The procedure is likely to yield generalizable knowle dge about the 
participants’ disorder or condition, wh ich is of vital importance for 
the understanding or amelioration of the participants’ disorder or 
condition.  
Protocol Version  #: 6   20 
Protocol Date: 25June2020 7.3.4  Adequate provisions are made for solic iting assent of the children 
and permission of their parents or legal guardians as detailed in 
the present IR B application.  
 
7.4 Discussion o f Risks as Part of the Consent Process  
The study team will discuss all procedures, risks, and benefits with potential study participants, as part of the consent process. An IRB 
approved written informed consent document will be  required for 
participation in this study. It is understood that consent is a process and 
not a discrete event.  A participant’s decision to withdr aw consent will be 
respected throughout the duration of each subject’s participation in this study. It is als o understood that there may be as -yet unknown or 
unanticipated adverse effects of this study. The study team will continually monitor for these effe cts and consider altering the protocol as 
needed to ens ure patient safety.  Changes in the procedures of the  study, 
as well as any chang e(s) in the risks and/or benefits will be presented to 
and discussed with the subjects upon approval from the IRB for implementation of such revision(s), and any IRB revised written consent 
will be signed, as appropriate.   
  
8.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk 
to Participants or Others  
 
8.1 Serious Adverse Events  
8.1.1  Defining Serious Adverse Event s 
Consistent with FDA guidelines, serious adverse events  (SAEs) will 
be defined as any untoward medical occur rence that:  
- requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
- results in persistent or significant disability  
- is suspected to cause a congenital anomaly or birth defect in a 
subject's unborn child  
- is life-threatening  
- results in death  
- is considered to be an important medi cal event based on 
appropria te medical judgement (e.g. bronchospasms requiring 
emergency department referral, seizures that might not result in hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). 
 
8.2 Assessing relationship between a SAE and  relationship to study 
procedures  
An SAE's relationship to the study procedures w ill be assessed and 
graded as either: not related, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_163782] ance with Department of Health and Human Services guidance 
and consistent with 45 CFR part 46, an "unanticipated problem" will 
Protocol Version  #: 6   21 
Protocol Date: 25June2020 include any incident , experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following  criteria: 
1. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or  frequency) given  
a. the research procedures that are described in the protocol -
related documents, including the IRB- approved research 
protocol and  informed consent document; and  
b. the characteristics of the subject population being studied; 
related or poss ibly related to participation in the research; and  
2. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm.  
3. related or possi bly related to participation in the research;  
4. suggests t hat the research places subjects or others at a great er risk 
of harm than was previously known or recognized.  
 
8.4 Unanticipated, non -serious AEs  
All unanticipated, non -serious AEs and the study team’s re sponse to the 
non-serious AE will be included in a repor t at the time of annual 
continuing review.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_144040] (DSM) and the IRB of any changes needed to the protocol. If 
needed, appropriate changes will b e made to the consent form.   
 
8.5 Unanticipated SAEs  
In accordance with IRB policy, any unanticipated SAE that i s considered 
possibly relate d to participation in the study will be reported within 7 
calendar days of the PI's notification of the event to the IR B and DSM. 
The study team will continue to follow or obtain documentation of the 
resolution of any SAE.   
 
8.[ADDRESS_163783] completed their participation and until a sufficient amoun t 
of time has passed beyond which any study -related AEs are unlikely.   
 This protocol will be reviewed annuall y (at a minimum) by [CONTACT_144061].  The goal of this process is to determine the risks and benefits of the 
study in the actual experience of  subjects and that measures taken to 
minimize risks are adequate  
 9.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
Subjects will be free to withdraw from the study at any time, which will be made clear at 
enrollment. Subjects will be withdrawn from the study if:  
- Pregn ancy is detected  
Protocol Version  #: 6   22 
Protocol Date: 25June2020 - The PI’s (or designated MD, NP, or PA  KSP) medical judgement is that  
participation places the subject at risk for harm  
 
10.[ADDRESS_163784] size and variance  of the LCD as a means to reduce 
HbA1c in T1DM in a future definitive trial. We utilized the method of Whitehead et al.  to estimate our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]’s optimum accrual, which 
proposes stepped increases in sample size based on the an ticipated 
standard differe nce, d, between interventions
41,42.  We defined the 
minimum important differen ce (MID) in ΔHbA1c between LCD and SCD 
interventions as 0.3% and estimated a pooled SD of 0.8% based on our 
literature review9.  If d=MID/SDpooled=0.3%/0.8%=0.38, a sample size 
of [ADDRESS_163785] udy, while allowing for up to 40% dropout.  Second, t his 
sample size allows for up to [ADDRESS_163786] -interventi on values 
from each aim (∆Hb A1c, ∆LDL -P, and ∆QOL score) between the two 
groups.  We will also perform a series of multivariable linear regression 
analyses with change in primary outcomes from each aim (∆HbA1c, 
∆LDL-P, and ∆QOL score) from baseline to [ADDRESS_163787]- intervention as 
the dependent variable. Explanatory variables in the multivariable linear 
regression modeling will include mean total daily dose of insulin 
normalized for body mass, weight change, coefficient of variation of glucose as measured b y CGM, and age.   
 
 11.0  Privacy/Confidentiality Issues

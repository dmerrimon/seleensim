Study Objectives:  
Primary Objective : 
 To compare  the efficacy and duration of analgesia following bilateral ultrasound -guided lateral and medial 
pectoral nerve block with  HTX -011 to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_829648].  
Secondary Objectives : 
 To evaluate the efficacy and duration of analgesia for HTX -011 administered using different techniques in this 
study pop ulation . 
 To evaluate additional efficacy parameters  in this study population.  
 To characterize the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39852] (PK) profile s of HTX -011 in this study 
population.  
 To determine the optimal administration technique of HTX -011 in this surgical model.  
 To further assess the safety and tolerability of HTX -011 in this study population.  
Methodology : This is a Phase 2B , randomized, double -blind, active - and saline placebo -controlled multicenter  
study in subjects undergoing bilateral subm uscular augmentation mammoplasty under general anesthesia .  
Subjects will be screened within 21 days prior to study drug administration. Subjects who meet the Screening 
eligibility criteria will be randomized . Randomization may be done up to 1 business day  prior to study drug 
administration. Subjects  will be administered a single dose of study drug (HTX -011, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39855], or saline placebo) via bilateral ultrasound -guided lateral and medial pectoral nerve block  and/or 
instillation  into the surgical site . For subjects receiving s tudy drug via ultrasound -guided lateral and medial pectoral 
nerve block , study drug will be administered  within 4 hours prior to undergoing mammoplasty . For subjects 
receiving study drug via instillation, study drug will be administered prior to the end of surgery . 
Dexamethasone  cannot to be administered prophylactically before surgery . During surgery, t he use of fentanyl up to 
4 µg/kg will be permitted . In order to decrease the inherent variability in pain control on postoperative pain 
perception , subjects in Cohort s 2 and 4  will receive protocol -specified fentanyl 50 µg intravenously (IV)  just prior to 
the end of the surgery.  Intraoperative administration of  other opi[INVESTIGATOR_829649] (including ketamine) , 
local anesthetics  (except for ropi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] ), or anti -inflammatory agents (except as specified by [CONTACT_760] ) is 
prohibited, unless needed to treat an adverse event  (AE)  that occurs after signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF) 
or for pretreatment prior to a needle placement . 
Following surgery and immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be transferred to the postanesthesia care unit 
(PACU). Subjects will remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/research facility  for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1151266] been completed, subjects may be 
discharged.  Subjects will return to the study site at 120  ±6 hours, and on Day 10 and Day 28 to complete follow -up 
assessments . 
An internal  Interim Review Committee  (IRC) will review unblinded, summary -level efficacy, safety, and P K data 
from each cohort to determine if enrollment should be initiated in the next cohort  and to guide Phase  [ADDRESS_1151267] 80% of the planned number of subjects have all  of their pain

Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background Information and Study Rationale 
It is estimated that up to 80% of patients suffer from moderate to severe pain during the first 
24 to 48 hours after surgery (Gan 2014) . Consequently, many are given narcotic analgesics for 
pain management. Administering a local anesthetic is a relatively simple and safe means of 
providing postoperative pain relief and promoting a quicker recovery; however, a major 
limitation of local anesthetics is their short duration of effect (6 to 12 hours following surgery) 
(Kehlet 2011) . The development of an extended release local anesthetic that would provide pain 
relief during this critical postoperative timeframe and reduce the need for narcotics would be of 
clinical significance. 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been used in the treatment of 
postoperative pain (Moote 1992) , and there is evidence that there may be a synergistic 
interaction between local anesthetics and NSAIDs when locally administered together (Ortiz 
2011 ). 
In the past decade, the use of regional anesthesia in general, in particular peripheral nerve blocks, 
has increased dramatically. These techniques may allow for more rapid discharge from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_829661]. Developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a long-acting agent that can be used in nerve 
block would help to further facilitate this trend. 
Heron is developi[INVESTIGATOR_39880]-[ADDRESS_1151298] that contains bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (a local anesthetic as 
the free base) and low -dose meloxicam (an NSAID) incorporated in a bioerodible polymer 
(termed Biochronomer®). When HTX-011 is administered, the polymer undergoes controlled 
hydrolysis in the tissue, resulting in the extended release of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39881]. 
The extended release is achieved using a proprietary vehicle formulation consisting of the novel 
tri[ethylene glycol]-based poly[orthoester] polymer (AP135) in combination with different 
excipi[INVESTIGATOR_39882] (dimethyl sulfoxide, glycerol triacetate [triacetin], and 
maleic acid). 
This is a Phase 2B, randomized, double-blind, active- and saline placebo-controlled, multicenter 
stud
y in subjects undergoing augmentation mammoplasty to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, 
safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of HTX-011 when administered via bilateral 
ultrasound-guided lateral and medial pectoral nerve block before surgery and/or instillation into 
the surgical site. 
1.2. Rationale for Study Design, Doses, and Control Groups 
Augmentation mammoplasty is an accepted model of postoperative pain. Augmentation 
mammoplasty produces generally reliable and persistent pain symptoms for a period typi[INVESTIGATOR_829662] 72 hours from the surgery, which allows for analysis of acute analgesia over 
a
n extended period of time.  
Protocol No: HTX- 011-[ADDRESS_1151299] been evaluated in previous HTX-011  Phase 2 clinical studies. A 
Phase 1, saline placebo-controlled study evaluated single doses of 100 , 200, and 400  mg of 
HTX-011 administered to healthy volunteers via subcutaneous injection.  All doses were well 
tolerated, and demonstrated therapeutically relevant plasma bupi[INVESTIGATOR_829663] 2 to 3 days in the absence of the large initial peak observed with commercially available 
formulations of the drug (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]). The analgesic effects of HTX-[ADDRESS_1151300] also been administered in concluded and ongoing Phase 2 studies; current data 
show that they have been generally well tolerated . 
Nonclinical and clinical data support a dose of HTX-011  400 mg/12 mg (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]/meloxicam 
doses) administered as a 100 mg dose to each of the lateral and medial pectoral nerves 
bilaterally.  These data include results from a femoral nerve block toxicity study in the dog with 
HTX-011 doses of 60 mg and 120 mg via ultrasound guided administration that showed no gross 
or microscopic changes related to HTX-011. Moreover, the summary PK results from the 
HTX-011 doses of 120  mg/3.6 mg and 240 mg/7.2 mg in Cohorts 2 and 3 reviewed by [CONTACT_829683][INVESTIGATOR_10319] C max was relatively linear with dose. 
Thus, extrapolation to a dose of 400 mg/12 mg is reasonable and yields a projected mean 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] C max of approximately 700 ng/mL. Further, mean bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] C max values for the 
120 mg/3.6 mg and 240 mg/7.[ADDRESS_1151301] 80% of the p lanned number of subjects have all 
of their pain intensity and opi[INVESTIGATOR_39860] 72-hour postoperative assessments entered 
into the electronic clinical database for that  cohort. The choice of [ADDRESS_1151302] selection as well as efficacy and safety assessments. Specific members of the site’s 
pharmacy staff and surgical staff will not be blinded to the treatment assignments because 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-[ADDRESS_1151303] is 
transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), the Investigator and all staff involved in 
efficacy and safety assessments will be blinded to treatment assignments until after database 
lock.  
As a postoperative pain study, the primary endpoint is the area under the curve (AUC) of the 
Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain intensity scores with activity (NRS-A ) from the start of study 
drug administration through [ADDRESS_1151304] use of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_39890], as recommended by [CONTACT_39964] (FDA) 
guidelines (FDA Draft Guidance for Industry, Analgesic Indications: Developi[INVESTIGATOR_39891]  [February 2014]). 
1.3. Potential Risks and Benefits 
As of [ADDRESS_1151305] been exposed to 1 of 3 different 
formulations of HTX-011 in 6 clinical studies. Studies included healthy volunteers and subjects 
unde
rgoing elective surgery (bunionectomy, herniorrhaphy, and abdominoplasty). In healthy 
volunteer studies, the [ADDRESS_1151306] common adverse events (AEs) when HTX-011 was administered 
subcutaneously were contusion and erythema at the site of administration. 
All subjects undergoing surgery received a single dose of an HTX-011 formulation ranging from 
30 mg to 600 mg (based on bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39886]) via local administration into the surgical site 
(injection, instillation, a combination of injection and instillation, or injection using a Mayo 
block). HTX-[ADDRESS_1151307] of the treatment-related AEs (TEAEs) were 
mild or moderate in severity and resolved without sequelae. When administered to subjects 
undergoing surgery, the [ADDRESS_1151308] events were self-limiting, mild or moderate in severity, and resolved 
without intervention or sequelae. 
Potential risks for bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39892]-related cardiovascular (CV) and central nervous 
system toxicity (MARCAINE USPI 2011 ; MARCAIN SmPC 2016) . Close attention should be 
given to conditions that may represent reported toxicities associated with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39893], 
but not limited to, perioral tingling, metallic taste, visual and auditory disturbances, muscle 
twitching, seizure, acidosis, shortness of breath, bradycardia (heart rate <50 beats per minute 

Protocol No: HTX- 011-211 Page 23 of 73 
Version 6 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential with symptoms), hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or symptomatic decrease from 
baseline), low oxygen saturation (≤90% for ≥1  minute), and cardiac arrest. 
Potential risks for meloxicam include CV adverse reactions and g astrointestinal bleeding 
(MOBIC SmPC 2015 ; MOBIC USPI 2016) . NSAIDs may cause an increased risk of serious CV 
thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal, and this risk may 
increase with duration of use. Patients with CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at 
greater risk. NSAIDs may also cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal AEs including 
bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. Elderly 
patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events. It is unclear how applicable these 
potential risks are for meloxicam when given as a single local administration (a novel 
administration method for meloxicam) for postoperative pain as part of a fixed-ratio combination 
(eg, HTX-011).

3.1. Description of the Study Design 
3.1.1.  Overall Study Design 
This is a Phase 2B, randomized, double-blind, active- and saline placebo-controlled, multicenter 
stud
y to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety, and PK of HTX-011 administered by [CONTACT_829684]/or instillation into the surgical site in subjects undergoing bilateral submuscular 
augmentation mammoplasty under general anesthesia.  
Subjects will be screened within 21 days prior to study drug administration. Subjects who meet 
the Screening eligibility criteria will be randomized. Randomization may be done up to 
1 business day prior to study drug administration. Subjects will be administered a single dose of 
stud
y drug (HTX-011, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39861], or saline placebo) via bilateral 
ult
rasound-guided lateral and medial pectoral nerve block and/or instillation into the surgical 
site. For subjects receiving study drug via ultrasound-guided lateral and medial pectoral nerve 
block, study drug will be administered within 4 hours prior to undergoing mammoplasty. For 
subjects receiving study drug via instillation, study drug will be administered prior to the end of 
surgery (see Section 5.5 for details on study drug administration ). 
Dexamethasone cannot be administered prophylactically before surgery. During surgery, the use 
of fentanyl up to 4 µg/kg will be permitted. In order to decrease the inherent variability in pain 
control on postoperative pain perception, subjects in Cohorts 2 and 4  will receive 
protocol-specified fentanyl 50 µg intravenously (IV) just prior to the end of the surgery. 
Intraoperative administration of other opi[INVESTIGATOR_608075] (including ketamine), local 
anesthetics (except for ropi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]), or anti-inflammatory agents (except as specified by [CONTACT_829685]) is prohibited, unless needed to treat an AE that o ccurs after signing the Informed

4.2. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Subjects who meet the Screening eligibility criteria will be randomized. Randomization may be 
done up to [ADDRESS_1151319](s) and 
his/her verifier, and the unblinded clinical monitor. No subject may receive study drug prior to 
randomization. 
4.2.1.  Procedures for Handling Randomized Subjects Who Do Not Meet the Study 
Eligibility Criteria 
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibility criteria should not, under any circumstances, receive 
study drug.  
Subjects who meet the Screening eligibility criteria and are randomized, but who do not meet the 
eligibility criteria on Day [ADDRESS_1151320] does not meet the eligibility criteria but is 
randomized and receives study drug, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor immediately. 
The Sponsor ’s Medical Monitor and the Investigator will discuss whether to allow the subject to 
continue on study.  
4.3. Blinding 
The study will use a double-blind design . Specific members of t he site’s pharmacy and surgical 
staff will not be blinded to the treatment assignments because HTX-[ADDRESS_1151321] to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_829670],  and the volume of study drug to be administered 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-[ADDRESS_1151322] ensure he/she does not impress upon the subjects any 
visual or verbalized cues as to the treatment. Once surgery is completed and the subject is 
transferred to the PACU , the Investigator and all site staff involved in safety and efficacy 
assessments will be blinded to the treatment assignments until after database lock. The Sponsor’s 
study team will also be blinded to the treatment assignments with the exception of the clinical 
trial material (CTM) staff, the clinical observers, the bioanalytical staff, and an unblinded 
statistician who will perform the randomization and interim analysis data reviews, but will 
otherwise be uninvolved in the conduct of the study. In addition, an  internal IRC will be 
unblinded during the interim reviews of summary-level efficacy, safety, and PK data from the 
study. 
4.3.1.  Breaking the Blind 
The study blind should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the subject requires knowledge of the study drug she received.  An attempt 
should be made to contact [CONTACT_39967]. If the Sponsor cannot be 
reached and the blind is broken by [CONTACT_737],  the reason for unblinding must be 
documented and the Sponsor must be contact[CONTACT_11252] [ADDRESS_1151323] ( IP) and that potentially require 
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities.  
All circumstances leading to the premature unblinding must be clearly documented. 
4.4. Subject Withdrawal and Replacement 
4.4.1.  Subject Withdrawal 
Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to further treatment. 
A subject may also be withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_39968]’s best interest t o continue participation.  
Possible reasons for early withdrawal include the following: 
 Adverse event 
 Consent withdrawal 
 Death 
 Lost to follow up 
 Investigator’s decision  
 Sponsor’s decision  
 Screen fail on Day 0 
The date and the primary reason for early withdrawal will be recorded on the electron ic Case 
Report Form (eCRF). At the time of withdrawal from the study,  every attempt should be made to 
complete the Early Termination Visit assessments (s ee Section 7.4).

Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential 5. STUDY TREATMENT 
All subjects will receive a single dose of study drug. Study drug is defined as HTX-011 ( IP) , 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39861] (active control), or saline placebo (control).  
HTX-[ADDRESS_1151325] 
HTX-011  is a slightly yellow,  viscous , semi-solid gel liquid. HTX-011  is supplied in prefilled 
sterile syringes and/or vials. The prefilled syringe and vials serve only as a closed container for 
the drug product. For administration of study drug, the formulation in the prefilled syringes 
and/or vials will be aseptically transferred to sterile syringes. 
5.2. Manufacturing, Packaging,  and Labeling 
HTX-011 will be manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practices, and packaged and 
labeled by [CONTACT_16015]. HTX-011  will be packed and dispatched to comply with 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_39910]. HTX-011  labeling will comply with all applicable federal and 
local laws and regulations.  
5.3. Storage 
HTX-011 should be stored at the study site in a refrigerator at 2ºC to 8ºC. The refrigerator should 
be in a locked area with restricted access. A temperature log should be maintained to monitor the 
refrigerator ’s temperature. 
S
aline placebo and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_829671] 
5.4. Preparation 
Study drug will be prepared at the study site by [CONTACT_250989]. Refer to the 
P
harmacy Manual for details on study drug preparation.  
5.5. Study Drug Administration 
Study drug should be prepared and study drug administration equipment should be assembled 
and primed as outlined in the Pharmacy Manual. 
Study personnel who are present during the administration of study drug are unblinded and 
cannot perform postoperative assessments. 
5.5.1.  Nerve Block 
For bilateral ultrasound-guided lateral and medial pectoral nerve block, approximately half the 
total volume of study drug should be administered to each side and equal amounts should be 
administered per nerve. 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-[ADDRESS_1151326] capacity for color and needle localization software, if 
needed for ease of needle placement.  With a linear array transducer in a sterile sleeve, the nerve 
will be identified in a transverse (short-axis) view below where it comes off at the brachial 
plexus; the internal appearance of the peripheral nerve bundle should appear to be a mixture of 
hypoechoic neural tissue (fascicles) and hyperechoic connective tissue (perineurium and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_41821]). Once the optimal image of the nerve is obtained, a local anesthetic skin wheal (1% 
lidocaine) may be raised near the ultrasound transducer. A needle will be inserted through the 
skin wheal and directed medially in plane beneath the ultrasound transducer toward the nerves; 
the study drug will be injected around the nerves. 
The surgeon should administer 5 mL of 0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_829672]. 
5.5.2.  HTX-011 Instillation and Saline Placebo Nerve Block 
To maintain the study blind for instillation only administration, a nerve block will be performed 
as described in Section 5.5.1  using saline placebo. In addition, the Investigator will instill HTX-
011 into the surgical site in a manner to be specified by [CONTACT_829687]/Study 
Manual.  Note: HTX-011  is to be instilled, not injected,  into the tissue. 
The surgeon should administer 5 mL of 0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_829672].  
5.6. Study Drug Compliance 
All study drug must be administered in accordance with the treatment assignment.  
5.7. Study Drug Accountability 
The IP provided for this study will be used only as directed in the study protocol. In accordance 
with GCP, Investigators are required to maintain accurate and up- to-date records of all IP to 
permit reconciliation of study drug. The Investigator or designee must maintain adequate records 
of distribution, including the date received, number and units received, lot numbers, dispensing, 
and return or destruction of all IP (ie, accountability or dispensing logs). 
All study drug records must be readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_779] ’s unblinded clinical 
monitor and/or auditor. No IP can be returned to the Sponsor or designee or disposed of at the 
study site until the unblinded clinical monitor has verified the accuracy of the study drug records 
at the study site. All returns, disposal,  or destruction must be approved by [CONTACT_39974]. 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-[ADDRESS_1151327]’s 
medical records from their primary care physician is not required. Data collected will include 
medical and surgical history. 
6.1.2.  Demographics 
Demographic information collected will include age, sex, race, and ethnicity. 
6.2. Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
All medications taken by [CONTACT_829688] [ADDRESS_1151328]’s eCRF . For subjects entering on a stable dose of permitted medication, 
any change in dose should also be recorded. 
Medications include prescription or over-the-counter medications (including herbal products and 
vitamins). 
During surgery, the use of fentanyl up to 4 μg/kg is permi tted. In addition, subjects in Cohorts 2 
and 4 will receive protocol-specified fentanyl 50 µg intravenously (IV) just prior to the end of 
the sur
gery. As the prescribing information for fentanyl citrate (Fentanyl Citrate USPI 2012)  
specifies that for intraoperative use a “moderate dose” of 2 to 20 μg/kg IV is necessary in orde r 
to allow the anesthesiologist to respond to any signal that the surgical stress is increasing or 
anesthesia lightening, this dose was chosen to be in the lowermost portion of that range and 
therefore not interfere with assessment of postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_39851]. As clinically appropriate, 
the minimum possible fentanyl dose should be used. 
Medications that are prohibited during the study are described in Section 9.1. 
6.3. Efficacy Assessments 
6.3.1.  Pain Intensity Assessment  
Subjects will be asked to evaluate their current pain level at scheduled timepoints after surgery. 
Subjects will receive training by [CONTACT_39976]. 
Pain intensity scores will be assessed using an 11-point NRS (0 –10) where 0 represents “no 
pain” and 10 represents “worst pain imaginable.” NRS scores will be recorded at rest (NRS-R; 
in a dependent position) and with activity (NRS- A). For the prescribed activity, the subject will

6.3.4.  Patient Global Assessment of Pain Control 
Subjects will be asked to evaluate the performance of study drug as a pain treatment at different 
intervals using a 4- point rating scale where 0 represents “poor” and 3 represents “excellent”  
(Rothman 2009) . See Appendix D for the PGA scale. 
6.3.5.  Discharge Readiness 
Discharge readiness will be assessed using the MPADSS criteria (Chung 1995) . Refer to 
Appendix B. 
Note: This study instrument assesses a subject’s potenti al readiness to be discharged and should 
be repeated at all scheduled timepoints. It is not meant to be used to decide on whether or not to 
discharge a subject from the study. Subjects are required to remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/research 
facility for [ADDRESS_1151332]’s  response to the following statement “I am satisfied with postoperative pain control ” 
will be recorded using a 5-point Likert scale where 1 represents “strongly disagree” and 5 
represents “strongly agree.”  
The blinded assessor will also be questioned about his/her satisfaction with return of sensory and 
m
otor function using a 5-point Likert scale. 
6.3.7.  Overall Benefit of Analgesia Assessment 
The subject will be questioned about their overall benefit of analgesia using a 7-item, 
multidimensional,  quality assessment questionnaire (Lehmann 2010) . The 7 items address pain, 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-[ADDRESS_1151333] signs 
the ICF through Day 28. See Section 8 for details. 
6.4.2.  Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity Assessment 
Subjects should be assessed on a regular basis to identify early neurologic and cardiac signs and 
symptoms that may be attributed to local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST ; eg, 
metallic/strange taste, perioral tingling, ringing in ears, visual disturbance, tremors, muscle 
twitching, dizziness/lightheadedness, convulsion/seizure, bradycardia, arrhythmia, hypotension) 
(Vasques 2015) . Additional monitoring of subjects for safety should be performed as needed (eg, 
vital signs, ECGs). 
Signs and symptoms that are clinically significant and may be attributed to LAST should be 
recorded as AEs. 
6.4.3.  Physical Examinations 
Scheduled physical examinations will include an evaluation of the following: head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat as well as CV, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, neurological, dermatological, and 
musculoskeletal systems. 
Baseline height and weight measurements, and calculation of BMI (BMI = weight [kg]/height 
[m2]) will be conducted. 
Unsc
heduled physical examinations may also be performed (the extent of which is to be 
determined by [CONTACT_737]) at any time during the study if indicated by a change in the 
subject’s medical history or condition.  
6.4.4.  Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure,  resting heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_11943]. Subjects should be in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] (includes sitting in a recliner chair) for at least 
[ADDRESS_1151334] digital 12-lead ECG results will be 
recorded in triplicate. Subjects should be in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] (includes sitting in a recliner 
c
hair) for at least 5 minutes before each ECG recording. The mean of the 3 ECGs will be used as 
the baseline result. 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-[ADDRESS_1151335] prior to the operation and replaced immediately after the 
operation, if needed. The limb leads should not be removed during the operation.  
The ECG and Holter monitor results will be reviewed by a central reader and the information 
provided to the sites.  Refer to the Cardiac Manual for instructions on collecting and transmitting 
results. Clinically significant findings after study drug administration will be recorded as TEAEs . 
6.4.6.  Wound Healing Assessment 
Surgical wound healing will be evaluated by [CONTACT_39977]; every attempt should be made by [CONTACT_829689]. The findings will be graded according to the Southampton Wound Scoring 
System (Bailey 1992) ; see Appendix C. 
6.4.7.  Motor Function Assessment 
Motor function will be assessed by [CONTACT_829690], clasp hands together, and hold that 
position for at least [ADDRESS_1151336] will be asked “Can you detect cold?” The results (Yes 
or No) will be recorded on the eCRF. 
6.4.9.  Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood and urine samples will be collected for diagnostic screening tests and for safety laboratory 
tests (hematology and serum chemistry). See Table [ADDRESS_1151337] of clinical laboratory tests and 
parameters. Blood samples will be tested by a central laboratory. Urine samples will be tested by 
[CONTACT_28130]. 
Laboratory results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. Any laboratory values outside of the 
normal reference range will be evaluated for clinical significance. Clinically significant findings 
after study drug administration will be recorded as AEs. 
Refer to the Laboratory Manual for detailed instructions on sample collection, processing, and 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_4585]. 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-[ADDRESS_1151338]. If there is no response, the assessments at these timepoints may be recorded as 
“Not  Done .” Assessments that can be done without awakening the subject (eg, blood collection 
for PK sample) should be completed. Additional visits and/or assessments are permitted if 
clinically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689].  
When the following assessments are scheduled at the same timepoint, it is recommended that 
they be performed in this order: 
 NRS-R pain intensity assessment  (assessed in a dependent position) 
 PGA of pain control 
 OBAS assessment 
 Vital signs 
 12-lead ECG 
 NRS-A pain intensity assessment (assessed by [CONTACT_829691], clasp hands together, 
and hold that position for at least 5 seconds) 
 Blood sample collection 
 Physical examination 
 Wound healing assessment 
 Subject’s satisfaction with postoperative pain control  
7.1. Screening Period 
After providing written informed consent, potential study subjects will undergo Screening 
procedures to confirm eligibility to participate in the study. Screening procedures must be 
performed within [ADDRESS_1151339]’s medical history and the results of all Screening 
assessments to determine study eligibility before the subject is randomized. Screening laboratory 
test results that do not meet the eligibility criteria may not be repeated without the Sponsor's 
approval.  
Screening procedures and assessments will include the following: 
 Medical history 
 Demographic recording 
 Physical examination including weight, height, and BMI calculation 
 Vital signs measurements 
 12-lead ECG (triplicate) 
 Ur
ine collection for pregnancy test (female subjects of child bearing potential only)

Subjects will be required to have a continuous reading of the Holter monitor at least 24  hours 
before surgery (Day 0).  
Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria may be randomized up to 1 business day prior to study 
drug administration.  Subjects do not need to be present for randomization to occur. 
7.2. Study Drug Administration, Surgery, and Observational Period 
7.2.1.  Day 0, Prior to Surgery 
On the day of surgery (Day 0), su bjects will be reassessed for study eligibility. Subjects who 
continue to meet the eligibility criteria can continue on study and the following study procedures 
and assessments will be performed before study drug administration: 
 Vital signs measurements 
 Urine sample collection for the following assessments: 
 Drug screen 
 Pregnancy test (female subjects of childbearing potential only) 
 Subject training for pain intensity assessments (refresher training) 
 NRS-R pain intensity assessment

After all assessments have been completed, study drug will be administered within 4 hours prior 
to surgery for subjects receiving study drug via ultrasound-guided lateral and medial pectoral 
nerve block. See Section 5.5 for complete details on the method of study drug administration. 
The start and stop times of study drug dosing will be recorded in the eCRF. Details of 
administration will be recorded on a worksheet, which will be used in the dictation of the 
surgical notes and will become part of the source document. 
A sensory function assessment (cold test) will be performed on the upper outer quadrant of the 
breast on the side of the dominant hand at 15, 30, and [ADDRESS_1151340] to or in the 
operating room, the assessment may be avoided and “ Not Done ” recorded on the eCRF.

in the operating room. 
7.2.3.  Surgery (Day 0) 
Subjects will be admitted to the surgical unit and will undergo a bilateral submuscular 
augmentation mammoplasty under general anesthesia. Sites should follow intraoperative safety 
monitoring in accordance with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA ) Standards for 
Basic Anesthetic Monitoring (American Society of Anesthesiologists 2015) . The start and stop 
time of surgery and additional surgical details should be recorded in the eCRF. Concomitant 
medications used during surgery and AEs will be recorded.  
For subjects receiving study drug via instillation, study drug will be administered prior to the end 
of surgery. See Section 5.5 for complete details on the method of study drug administration. The 
start and stop times of study drug dosing will be recorded in the eCRF. Details of administration 
will be recorded on a worksheet, which will be used in the dictation of the surgical notes and will 
become part of the source document. 
Note: The end of surgery (defined as placement of last suture) will be considered as Time 0 
for all efficacy and safety assessments. 
After immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be transferred to the PACU.   
7.2.4.  Postoperative Observation Period (72 Hours) 
Subjects will remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/research facility for 72 hours after surgery. Study procedures 
and assessments that will be performed are listed below.

7.5. Unscheduled Visits and Assessments 
Unscheduled visits and assessments should be performed if clinically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15960]. Except when  urgent clinical evaluation is necessary, it is expected that the 
Investigator will have the subject return for an unscheduled visit rather than directing the subject 
to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9487]. The following procedures and assessments are examples of what 
may be performed at an unscheduled visit, depending on the clinical situation: 
 Vital signs 
 Physical examination 
 ECG 
 Wound healing assessment 
 AE recording 
 C
oncomitant medication recording 
 Blood sample collection to determine plasma bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39875] (if the unscheduled 
visit is potentially related to a cardiac or neurological TEAE) 
 Blood sample collection for clinical safety laboratory tests (hematology and chemistry) 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-[ADDRESS_1151342] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not 
considered causally associated with the use of the study drug. Any abnormal laboratory value, 
vital sign result, or ECG finding deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_737], regardless of 
causal relationship, must be reported as an AE. A clinical diagnosis, rather than the changes in 
laboratory analyte or other assessment, should be recorded (eg, anemia rather than low 
hemo globin value). 
Examples of AEs include the following: 
 Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or indication under 
study.  
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including either an increase 
in frequency or intensity of the condition (eg, abnormal physical examination finding). 
 Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. 
 Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study drug or a 
concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE, unless 
nonse
rious or serious sequelae occur). 
 The following abnormal laboratory results: 
 Any laboratory abnormality suggestive of a new disease/organ toxicity or a worsening of 
a pre-existing condition  
 Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to have IP interrupted or 
discontinued 
 Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific treatment for the 
abnormality 
 Any laboratory abnormality that required additional monitoring and follow-up visits 
 Any laboratory abnormality requiring further diagnostic investigation 
The following examples are not considered AEs: 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-211 Page 49 of 73 
Version 6 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy), although the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE. 
 Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) (including 
laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
 The disease or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease or disorder being studied, unless they become more severe or occur with a greater 
frequency than expected for the subject’s condition . 
 Transient paresthesia that is considered to be clinically normal (would be expected to occur 
as a long-acting local anesthetic wears off). 
8.1.2.  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death. 
 A life-threatening AE (ie, presented an immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. 
This criterion is  not intended to include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.) 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
The following events do not meet the definition of an SAE: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39939] a pre-existing condition that does not worsen from baseline, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a standard 
procedure for study drug administration and routine monitoring of the studied indication not 
associated with any deterioration in condition, social or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
prolongation of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39940], or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39941] 24 hours. 
According to 21Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 812.3(s), an unanticipated adverse device 
effect means any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or 
death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application 
(including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-211 Page 50 of 73 
Version 6 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential 8.1.3.  Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction 
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the AE was caused by [CONTACT_5257]. 
8.1.4.  Definition of a Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction 
A serious suspected adverse reaction is any suspected adverse reaction that is determined to be 
serious, based on the outcomes of an  SAE described in Section 8.1.2 . 
8.1.5.  Definition of Unanticipated Problems 
Unanticipated problems are incidents, experiences, or outcomes that meet all of the following 
criteria: 
 Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that 
are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the research protocol and informed 
consent document approved by [CONTACT_20601] (EC; includes Institutional Review 
Boards [IRBs], Independent Ethics Committees [IECs], and Research Ethics Boards [REBs]) 
and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied. 
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is 
a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_3459]). 
 Suggest that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized. 
An unanticipated adverse device effect is defined in Section 8.1.2 . 
8.2. Classification of Adverse Events 
8.2.1.  Severity of Adverse Event s 
The Investigator will assess the severity of each AE based on his/her clinical judgment using one 
of the following categories: 
 Mild:  Event is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort, and does not 
interfere with everyday activities.  
 Moderate:  Event results in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
 Severe:  Event interrupts a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or 
incapacitating.  
8.2.2.  Relationship to Study Drug 
The Investigator will assess the relationship of each AE to study drug based on his/her clinical 
judgment. The Investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study drug is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-[ADDRESS_1151343]. The Sponsor’s assessment of relationship may differ from the 
Investigator’s assessment.  
Relationship to study drug will be assessed according to the following guidelines: 
 Possibly related: The AE is known to occur with the study drug, there is a reasonabl e 
possi
bility that the study drug caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the 
study drug and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study drug and the AE. 
 Unlikely Related: There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
drug
 caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study drug and event 
onset, or an alternate etiology has been established. 
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for initially reporting an SAE, it is 
important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before 
entering the information into the eCRF or completing the SAE reporting form, in the event 
electronic data capture (EDC) is not available. The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. The Investigator may change his or 
her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information and amend the SAE information 
accordingly in the eCRF or the SAE reporting form, as applicable. 
8.3. Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow Up 
8.3.1.  Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Monitoring  
All AEs regardless of causality or seriousness will be recorded from the time the subject signs 
the ICF through Day 28. 
If an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE that occurs in a subject more than [ADDRESS_1151344]’s condition. All AEs and SAEs 
documented at a previous visit or contact [CONTACT_829692]. 
Nonserious AEs will be followed after the last scheduled study visit until the event resolve s, the 
condition stabilizes, or until the event is otherwise explained or judged by [CONTACT_39981] (unless the subject is lost to follow-up  or withdraws consent). 
The Investigator will assess the outcome of each AE using the following categories: 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-211 Page 52 of 73 
Version 6 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  Resolved: The event resolved or the subject recovered without sequelae. An event (either 
se
rious or nonserious) occurred and had an endpoint, and the subject experienced no 
restrictions. Examples include stent placement for coronary artery disease (a device 
implanted is not a sequela), an appendectomy (a scar is not a sequela), a postoperative wound 
infection, or an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]. 
 Resolved with sequelae:  The event has at least one secondary outcome that may result in 
permanent disability, functional limitation, or both. Such sequelae are usually limited to 
SAEs. Examples include hip replacement resulting in foot drop (foot drop is not the intended 
outcome but is a risk of surgery), stroke resulting in paralysis, or emboli formation after a 
bacterial infection resulting in a renal infarct and loss of renal function. 
 Not resolved: At the end of the study, a nonserious event either has not changed in intensity 
or may not have recovered to baseline values, and the outcome is unknown. Examples 
include headache, low-grade fever, or nausea. 
 Unknown:  The subject has withdrawn from the study prematurely or is lost to follow-up, 
and the status of the event is unknown. 
 Death 
SAEs will be followed until the event resolves (ie, when the event no longer meets any of the 
seriousness criteria), the condition stabilizes, or until the event is otherwise explained or judged 
by [CONTACT_39982] (unless the subject is lost to follow-up  or 
withdraws consent). The Investigator will ensure that follow-u p information provided to the 
Sponsor includes results of any additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathologic 
examinations, or consultations with other healthcare professionals that serve to clarify the nature 
of the event, the cause of the event, or both. New or updated information will be recorded as 
outlined in Section 8.4.1 . 
8.4. Reporting Procedures 
8.4.1.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor 
If the Investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE due to any 
cause that occurs during the course of this study, regardless of relationship to study drug, he/she 
must notify the Sponsor by [CONTACT_829693] [ADDRESS_1151345] 
also enter the SAE information into the eCRF as soon as possible thereafter. 
Email Address:  [EMAIL_3880]  
In the initial email, the Investigator must provide to the Sponsor the following eCRF pages, 
completed to the greatest extent possible: 
 AE record 
 Medical history 
 Prior and concomitant medications 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-211 Page 53 of 73 
Version 6 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential Also, the following documents are to be forwarded: any laboratory results, diagnostic test results, 
or medical reports relevant to the SAE. 
EDC is the preferred method for notification of SAE information. In rare circumstances and in 
the absence of email capacity, notification by [CONTACT_39984], with a copy of the 
SAE reporting form sent by [CONTACT_9338]. Initial notification via telephone does not replace the 
need for the Investigator to complete the SAE information in the eCRF within the time frames 
outlined. 
If the Investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she must not wait to 
receive additional information before notifying the Sponsor of the event. The SAE must be 
updated when additional information is received. Follow-up information received on all SAEs 
must be forwarded to the Sponsor using the same timelines as for an initial report. 
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor by [CONTACT_829694] [ADDRESS_1151346]. 
8.4.2.  Reporting Unanticipated Problems to the Sponsor 
If the Investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an unanticipated 
problem, he/she must notify the Sponsor by [CONTACT_39985] [ADDRESS_1151347] also enter the information into the eCRF as soon as possible thereafter. 
Email Address:  [EMAIL_3880]  
The following information will be included with unanticipated problem reporting: 
 Protocol identifying information: protocol title, protocol number, and Investigator’s name.  
 A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome. 
 An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome

Intraoperative administration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_608075] (including ketamine), local 
anesthetics, or anti-inflammatory agents except as specified by [CONTACT_760] (ie, HTX-011, 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974], ropi[INVESTIGATOR_31974], and fentanyl) is prohibited, unless needed to treat an AE that 
occurs after signing the ICF or for pretreatment prior to a needle placement.  
With the exception of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_39942] 3.1.[ADDRESS_1151350] use an 
acceptable form of contraception in the event of sexual activity during the study and for 30 days 
after study drug administration. Acceptable forms of contraception include double-barrier 
contraception or an insertable, injectable, transdermal, or combination oral contraceptive

All safety and efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_22975]/or cohort, as 
appropriate. Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of subjects with data 
(n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Selected continuous 
variable summaries will also include the standard error (SE). Categorical variables will be 
summarized using frequency counts and percentages.  
Unless otherwise specified, all statistical hypothesis testing will be two-sided using α = 0.05. 
10.2. Determination of Sample Size 
The sample size of up to approximately 240  subjects in this study was selected empi[INVESTIGATOR_829675].  
10.3. Analysis Populations 
Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Population : All subjects who are randomized and d o not screen fail on 
Day [ADDRESS_1151352] disposition 
a
nalyses only. 
Modified ITT (mITT) Population : All subjects in the ITT Population who have at least 
[ADDRESS_1151353]-treatment NRS-A pain intensity score will be included in the mITT Population. This 
population will be used as the primary analysis population for all efficacy endpoints.  
Safety Population : All subjects who receive study drug will be included in the Safety Population. 
This population will be used for all summaries of safety data. 
10.4. Statistical Analysis Methods 
10.4.1. Disposition and Demographics 
The number and percentage of subjects in each analysis population will be summarized. Subject 
disposition, including the number of subjects screened, randomized, dosed, completing the 
72-hour postoperative observation period, completing Day 28, and not completing Day [ADDRESS_1151354] demographics and 
baseline characteristics will be summarized for the mITT Populat ion and will include age, age 
category, sex,  race, ethnicity, height, weight, and BMI. 
10.4.2. Efficacy Analysis 
For the purposes of statistical hypothesis testing, data from subjects randomized to saline placebo 
will be pooled across cohorts into a single saline placebo treatment group, and data from subjects

Version 6 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential randomized to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_829676] a single bupi[INVESTIGATOR_829677].  Data from subjects randomized to HTX-011 will neither be pooled across dose 
levels nor pooled across methods of administration within a dose level. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary analysis of mean AUC 0-24 of the NRS-A pain intensity scores will be carried out on 
the m
ITT Population using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment as the main 
effect. Each dose of HTX-[ADDRESS_1151355]-squares mean differences and SEs with associated 
95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values . To account for the duration effect of opi[INVESTIGATOR_57286], the windowed worst observation carried forward (wWOCF) method will be 
implemented as the primary analysis method for endpoints involving NRS pain intensity scores. 
In this method, pain intensity scores observed during the analgesic window (duration of effect) 
of any opi[INVESTIGATOR_39944] (highest) postdose nonmissing 
NRS pain intensity score observed prior to the rescue medication window, with the following 
exception: if the NRS pain intensity score for a windowed observation is higher than the worst 
pre-window score, then it will not be replaced. Sensitivity analyses for endpoints involving NRS 
pain intensity scores will analyze the data without adjustment for the effect of opi[INVESTIGATOR_697785]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in a manner similar to that specified 
for the primary endpoint. 
Categorical endpoints will be analyzed using Fisher’s exact test . Results will be expressed as the 
number and percentage of subjects meeting the relevant endpoint, differences in proportions with 
95% CIs, and p-values.

methods. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Handling of Missing Data 
Due to the required 72-hour inpatient post-surgery observation period, the amount of missing 
data is expected to be very low. For any missing data observed, NRS pain intensity scores will be 
imputed via last observation carried forward (LOCF), in which the most recent postdose 
nonmissing value is used for a subsequent missing value. For subjects who do not have a 
postdose value prior to their first missing value, the median of the postdose values at the relevant 
timepoint from subjects with observed data in the same randomized treatment group will be 
used. Predose values will not be carried forward to postdose timepoints. Analyses that adjust for 
the effect of opi[INVESTIGATOR_39946] (ie, perform 
LOCF first, then apply wWOCF). Other continuous efficacy endpoints with missing data will be 
handled using LOCF. In general, subjects with missing categorical data at a timepoint will be 
assumed to have not met the endpoint at that timepoint. For the analysis of time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_829678], subjects who withdraw from the study prior to completing the 72-hour 
postoperative observation period or complete the 72 -hour postoperative observation period

for review and, if applicable, approval: study protocol, ICF(s), IB, recruitment materials, 
information about study compensation to subjects, any information for presentation to potential 
subjects by [CONTACT_39989].  
The Investigator is responsible for providing the Sponsor with the written EC approval prior to 
commencing the study (ie, before shipment of study drug to the site). All amendments to the 
protocol require review and approval by [CONTACT_39990]. 
All changes to the ICF will be approved by [CONTACT_1383]; a determination will be made regarding 
whether previously consented participants need to be re-consented. If any other information 
approved by [CONTACT_829695], the 
Investigator is also responsible for ensuring EC review and approval. 
Study sites must adhere to all requirements stipulated by [CONTACT_39992]. This may include, 
but not be limited to, notifying the EC of serious and unexpected AEs or other local safety 
reporting requirements, submitting a final status report, or providing a synopsis of the study 
report upon study completion. 
12.4. Informed Consent Process 
Note: All references to “subject” in this section refer to the study subject or her legally 
authorized representative. 
The Sponsor (or its designee) will provide Investigators with a multicenter ICF for this study. 
Investigators may adapt the information to suit the needs of their institution, if necessary 
(although it must reflect the required elements of informed consent specified in 21 CFR 
Part 50.25). The final ICF must be accepted by [CONTACT_39993]. 
Investigators must provide the Sponsor with an unsigned copy of the final ICF before and after it 
is approved by [CONTACT_1383]. If any new information becomes available that might affect a subject ’s 
willingness to participate in the study, or if any amendments to the protocol require changes to 
the ICF, the Sponsor will provide Investigators with a revised ICF. 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-[ADDRESS_1151361]’s personal and personal health information for purposes of conducting 
the study. The ICF will include details the requirements of the participant and the fact that she is 
free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason and without prejudice to her further medical 
care. Before informed consent is obtained, the subject should be given ample time and 
opportunity to inquire about the details of the study . All questions must be answered to the 
satisfaction of the subject. 
Once signed, the original ICF will be stored in the Investigator’s site file and made available for 
review by [CONTACT_1034]. Documentation of the informed consent discussion must be noted in the 
subject’s case history . All subjects will receive a copy of her signed and dated ICF. 
If the ICF is revised during the study and requires the subject to be re-consented, informed 
consent will be obtained in the same manner as for the original ICF. 
12.5. Confidentiality 
All information provided by [CONTACT_39994], Inc. and all data and information generated by 
[CONTACT_39995] (other than a subject’s medical records) will be kept confidential by 
[CONTACT_39996]. This information and data will not be used by [CONTACT_829696] . These restrictions do 
not apply to the following: 1) information that becomes publicly available through no fault of the 
Investigator or site staff, 2) information that must be disclosed in confidence to an EC solely for 
the evaluation of the study results, 3) information that must be disclosed in order to provide 
appropriate medical care to a study subject, or 4) study results that may be published as 
described in Section 13.6. If a written contract for the conduct of the study is executed and that 
contract includes confidentiality provisions inconsistent with this statement, that contract’s 
confidentiality provisions shall apply rather than this statement provided, however, that the 
confidentiality provisions in any written contract shall not be less restrictive than this statement.  
The Investigator agrees to comply with all applicable national, state, and local laws and 
regulations relating to the p rivacy of subjects’ health information . The Investigator shall ensure 
that study subjects authorize the use and disclosure of protected health information in accordance 
with the privacy regulations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
and in a form satisfactory to the Sponsor. 
The subject’s contact [CONTACT_21225]. Throughout the study, a subject’s source data will only be linked to the 
Sponsor’s clinical study database or documentation via a unique identification number. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309]

Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential Protocol deviations fall into 2 categories: those with approval prior to the event (protocol 
exemptions) and those occurring during the course of the study without prior approval (protocol 
violations). If an exemption from the protocol design (eg, a missed study visit or an unmet 
inclusion or exclusion criterion) is desired for an individual subject, other than those to eliminat e 
immediate hazard, the Investigator must request an exemption from the Sponsor or designee. The 
Investigator will notify the EC of exemptions and deviations, as required by [CONTACT_829698]. Exemptions (with rationale) will be documented at the site and in the Sponsor 
files. For any protocol violation, the site will document the protocol violation in the subject’s 
source documents. In the event of a significant violation, the site will notify the Sponsor or 
designee. Significant violations include, but are not limited to, those that involve fraud or 
misconduct, increase the health risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary study 
assessments. The Sponsor is responsible for notifying the regulatory authorities, if required. 
13.4. Financial Disclosure

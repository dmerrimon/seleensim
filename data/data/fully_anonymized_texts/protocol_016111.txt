Protocol Version 2.12.[ADDRESS_755145] summary  
 
The 52 mg levonorgestrel -releasing  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS, trade name “Mirena” 
or “Lil etta”) is a highly effective method of preventing pregnancy , but it s use is often associated 
with early “nuisance bleeding” which may lead to  discontinuation . Given that the LNG-IUS is 20 
times more effective at pregnancy prevention than oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], strategies to increase 
its acceptability will translate into improved prevention of unplanned pregnancies  (1). Many 
medications have been studied with progestin -only contraceptives such as the LNG-IUS to 
manage irregular bleeding.  The only study to demonstrate a s ustained reduction in bleeding 
lasting f or two months was the selective estrogen recep tor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen  in 
users of the levono rgestrel (LNG) contraceptive implant  (2). The proposed  research project will  
be the first to  test the effectiveness of tamoxifen  to improve bleeding patterns  in users of the 
LNG-IUS.  
 This is a randomized, controlled, double blind clinical trial enrolling new users of the 
LNG-IUS to try to improve frequent or prolonged bleeding  after insertion . Participants are 
randomized to recei ve tamoxifen 10mg or placebo twice daily  for seven  days  starting  [ADDRESS_755146] a reduction in bleeding /spotting  days compared to placebo  in the 30 days 
after star ting study drug .

1.1 Rationale and objectives of the study  
 
1.1.1 Rationale  
The 52 mg levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine system  (LNG -IUS) is a highly effective 
method of reversible contraception with a failure rate within the first year of less than 1% (3).  
Like other progestin -only methods, the LNG-IUS is associated with bleeding pattern changes 
ranging from amenorrhea, infrequent and irregular bleeding, to frequent or prolonged bleeding.  
Bleeding irregularities apart from amenorrhea are most pronounced in the first six months of 
use. Between 1 1-26.3% of women experience frequent or prolonged  bleeding  during LNG-IUS 
use (4–8).  Discontinuation of the  LNG-IUS within the first year ranges from 7-30% of users, 
with the majority of women citing bleeding pattern changes as one of their primary motivation s 
for discontinuation  (4–7,9).  Patients with excessive bleeding or spotting were 2.7 or 1.8 ti mes 
more likely to discontinue  LNG-IUS, respectively  (7).  Preventing  frequent or prolonged bleeding 
in LNG-IUS users should decrease discontinuation .  Given that long -acting, reversible 
contraceptives (LARCs) including the LNG-IUS are 20 times more effective at pregnancy 
prevention than oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], strategies to increase their acceptability will translate 
into prevention of unplanned pregnancies  (1).  
  Many prior studies have examined strategies to manage irregular bleeding resulting 
from progestin -only contraceptiv es. Mechanisms for irregular bleeding are multifactorial and 
poorly understood, but may involve changes in vascular growth , vascular fragility,  estrogen 
withdrawal, and disruption in repair mechanisms within the endometrium  (10–16). These 
theories have inspi[INVESTIGATOR_575249] -steroidal anti -inflammatory medications, antibiotics, and 
estradiol preparations to stabilize endometrium and reduce bleeding, but no single approac h 
has shown a consistent benefit (2,15,17,18) . The most commonly prescribed medication for 
persiste nt bleeding is combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], but these have shown conflicting 
success in decreasing bleeding, may cause side effects, and are not a therapeutic option for 
women with contraindications to estrogen (15). Selective progesterone receptor modulators 
(SPRMs) including mifepristone have shown some promise in reducing bleeding, possibly due 
to induction of an atrophic endometrium or promotion of tissue repair  mechanisms (12,19 –21). 
In humans, single doses of at least 50mg of mifepristone or similar SPRMs consistently reduced 
either the duration of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], total number of bleeding days, or percentage of 
bleed ing days in users of progestin -only pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]  (11), depo medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)  
(22), LNG-IUS (23), and LNG implant (24,25) .  
 Few studies  have investigated medications to prevent or treat frequent or prolonged  
bleeding early in LNG -IUS use. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_575250], non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, and estrogen patches (16,23,26,27) .  As 
mentioned above, mifepristone adminis tered in doses of 100mg monthly starting at LNG -IUS 
insertion and repeated monthly for three months showed a significant reduction in duration but 
not frequency of intermenstrual bleeding/spotting in one small , non-randomized, open -label trial 
(23). Tranexamic acid and mefenamic acid both failed to sig nificantly alleviate breakthrough 
bleeding in the first 90 days after LNG -IUS insertion when participants were randomized to take 
them versus placebo when experiencing a bleeding or spotting epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (27).  In another 
randomized controlled prevention trial, Naproxen 500mg twice daily for five days every 4 weeks 
over 12 weeks after insertion did show a 10% reduction in bleeding/spotting days compared to 
placebo (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.84 -0.97) whereas estradiol  patch use was associated with increased 
bleeding/spotting days compared to placebo (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.17 -1.34) (26).  
 In another randomized controlled trial , Warner et al  investigate d use of a different 
selective progesterone receptor modulator, CBD -2914, for prevention of unscheduled vaginal 
bleeding in the first 4 months after LNG -IUS insertion (16).  Participants were randomized to 
OHSU IRB# [ADDRESS_755149] No. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Protocol Version 2.12.[ADDRESS_755150] 21 days of use , 
women  reported bleeding/spotting on 70.6% of days (placebo) and 64.7% of days (CBD -2914) . 
In the first [ADDRESS_755151] treatment, the percentage of bleeding/spotting days in the 
treatment arm was an average of 10.6% less than placebo (mean difference of 3 days , 
p=0.011). However, this effect was attenuated after the second t reatment , and bleeding/spotting 
actually increased  in the treatment arm compared to the placebo arm after the third treatment 
(38.2% days with bleeding/spotting vs 28.7%, 6 day increase, p = 0.022) , suggesting that CBD -
2914 offered only an early, short ter m benefit (16).  
 One study examined the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen to 
reduce bleeding days in users of a LNG contraceptive implant who complained of vaginal 
bleeding irregularities  (2).  Women were randomized to receive 10mg of tamoxifen or placebo 
twice daily for [ADDRESS_755152] two months after dosing (6.24 vs 
12.29 days in month one, p=0.0003; 6.78 v 11.87 days in month two , p=0.0008).  The effect 
waned by [CONTACT_73546]. This is the only treatment for progestin -induced bleeding which has 
shown  a sustained bleeding reduction that lasted beyond the treatment period (18).  Bleeding 
stopped within 7 days of starting the medication for 82% of tamoxifen users (compared to 56% 
of placebo, p=0.005). Women re ported a higher level of satisfaction with tamoxifen compared to 
placebo, there were fewer discontinuations due to bleeding over the course of the study (2 vs 
9), and side effects were minimal.  
 Exogenous progestins such as LNG cause decidualization of th e endometrium with 
proliferation of fragile and thin walled vessels, which may be responsible for unscheduled 
bleeding  (13,14) . Tamoxifen is a mixed agonist -antagonist to estrogen and competitively inhibits 
estrogen binding at the estrogen receptor.  Whether its effect is agonistic or antagonistic 
depends on the promo tors present in each cell type  (28,29) . In the endometrium, tamoxifen acts 
as an antagonist to estrogen receptor beta cells, which may contribute to downregulation of 
endometrial angiogenesis, leading to dec reased breakthrough bleeding  (21,28,30) . Given the 
impressive ability of tamoxifen to stop an epi[INVESTIGATOR_575251], it is promising that tamoxifen may have a simil ar ability to reduce 
irregular bleeding in users of the LNG-IUS.  Developi[INVESTIGATOR_575252] a benefit to women and clinicians managing this common contraceptive side effect.   
 This project will address whether administration of  a short course (seven days) of 
tamoxifen can reduce early bleeding/spotting days in users of the LNG-IUS. Similar to the 
Warner study, study medication will be administered for 7 days starting 21 days after insertion of 
LNG-IUS, and bleeding outcomes will  be assessed for 30 days after treatment .  
 
1.1.2 Objectives and hypotheses  
Hypothesis :  Users of the LNG-IUS who receive  tamoxifen  [ADDRESS_755153] a reduction in bleeding /spotting  days over the next 30 days  compared to placebo.

1.2 Previous similar studies  
 Tamoxifen  has never been studied as an adjunctive therapy to the LNG-IUS.  Similar 
prior studies using other medications were addressed in the rational e section (1.1.1).  
 
1.3 Design and methodology  
1.3.1 Research design and general methodological approach   
This is  a randomized, controlled, double blind clinical trial of 42 women initiating the  
LNG-IUS. The study will assess the efficacy  of oral tamoxifen  to decrease bleeding days when  
taken prophylactically at a dose of 10mg twice daily for seven  days starting on day 21  after 
insertion . The study will be conducted at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in 
Portland, Oregon. Each subject’s involvement will last [ADDRESS_755155] a clinically significant 40% reduction in bleeding/spotting 
days over [ADDRESS_755156] of tamoxifen on bleeding 
patterns in LNG-IUS users.  The study on CBD -2914 and the LNG -IUS reported mean 
bleeding/spotting days for 30-day intervals after IUS insertion .  Between days 22 -51 (analogous 
to our 30 -day follow up period), placebo users had a mean of 18 days of bleeding/spotting with 
a standard deviation of 7 days (16).  Our sample size was calculated to be able to detect a 40% 
difference in bleeding days (+/ - 7 days out of 30)  with tamoxifen compared to placebo at 80% 
power and α=0.05 (Aim 1).  We propose to enroll 42 women, 2 1 women in each group 
(experimental and placebo) to account for a 20% dropout rate  (17).  
 
1.3.3  Criteria for the selection of subjects  
Subjects : This study will  prospectively  enroll English  and Spanish  speaking women 15-45 years 
of age seeking initiation  of LNG-IUS for contraceptive purposes  at the OHSU OB/GYNS clinics . 
They must have access to a reliable cell phone and must be willing to receive and respond to a 
daily text or email message to assess bleeding.   
 
Exclusion criteria : Postpartum within six months,  pregnant, breast -feeding, LNG -IUS prescribed 
to treat abnormal uterine  bleeding, switching from DMPA, IUS removal and replacement, 
undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding  pre-dating placement of  IUS, bleeding dyscrasia, 
anticoagulation use, active cervicitis, allergy  to tamoxifen , history of venous thromboembol ism, 
current or past breast or uterine malignancy, use of medication contraindicated with tamoxifen  
(coumadin, letrozole, bromocriptine, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], aminoglutethimide, phenobarbital).

6 Additional exclusions prior to randomization:  noncompliance with electronic bleeding diary; 
clinical evidence of IUD complication (e.g. heavy bleeding suspi[INVESTIGATOR_575253] (complete or 
partial);  unusual pelvic pain; fever and clinical exam suggesting endometritis.  
 
No vulnerable populations will be specifically rec ruited or included in this study. Subjects 
between the age s of [ADDRESS_755158] recruitment and allocation  
 We plan to recruit patients se eking LNG-IUS insertion through targeted recruitment at 
the OHSU OB/GYN clinics .  The decision to initiate IUS use will be made by [CONTACT_575261].  Women who are scheduled for  LNG-IUS insertion in the OHSU Center 
for Women’s Health will be screened by [CONTACT_575262].  On this phone call, study staff will describe the study using standardized text 
and assess interest in pa rticipation.  
 We will also advertise on the OHSU website or with Craig’s List, as other OHSU 
Women’s Health Research Unit  (WHRU)  projects are advertised , targeting ads to women who 
are p lanning to initiate the LNG -IUS. Women who call the WHRU  will be scre ened for 
inclusion/exclusion criteria  and directed to an appropriate OHSU clinic  for LNG -IUS insertion 
and study enrollment , if desired . These recruitment documents will refer to tamoxifen as “drug” 
or “medication,” and not list the study drug by [CONTACT_2300] (as was done in a previous study using the 
same drug - OHSU IRB#[ZIP_CODE]).  We found in the last tamoxifen study that potential subjects 
were being misinformed by [CONTACT_575263], and that 
allowing subjects to learn ab out the drug directly from study staff avoided this misinformation 
and improved recruitment. A through discussion about the study drug, tamoxifen, will take place 
at the initial visit before enrolling women into the study to avoid any misinformation from t he 
internet.   
 At the time of the ir clinic visit for IUS insertion, those women previously indicating 
interest and those we were not able to reach in advance will be approached by [CONTACT_575264].  The decision to obtain the LNG-IUS and the insertion process will 
be completed with the patient’s medi cal provider independent of the  study. Those women who 
are eligible based on inclusion/exclusion criteria and who are willing to participate will complete 
the informed consent and e nrollment proce ss as described in section 1.3.[ADDRESS_755159] 14 days  (responding 12 or more days, approximately 
90% response rate ) will be invited by [CONTACT_575265] 1  (occurring between 14 -21 
days after IUS insertion) . On this scheduling phone call, post -insertion exclusions will be 
reviewed. Eligible w omen scheduled for study visit [ADDRESS_755160] access  to the randomization scheme  or treatment 
assignments . The research pharmacy will maintain allocation concealment until completion of 
the study. Study drug (oral tamoxifen  10mg) will be purchased and routed through the OHSU 
research pharmacy, and identical placebo will be compounded by [CONTACT_56636] .  At 
OHSU IRB# [ADDRESS_755161] No. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Protocol Version 2.12.[ADDRESS_755162] will receive a total of seven days of  medication to take home ( 14 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]). They will be instructed to start this medication on day 21 after insertion of their LNG -IUS. 
 Women with inadequate responses to the text message diary (less than 12 of 14 days) 
during the 14-day observation period will be contact[CONTACT_575266], and they will stop receiving automated text messages.  
 
1.3.5  Description of the drug  to be studied  
 Tamoxifen is a nonsteroidal agent with antiestrogenic properties. Following an oral dose 
of 20mg, peak plasma concentration occurs about five hours after dosing. The elimination half -
life is 5 -7 days.  Administration of 10mg tamoxifen given twice daily for three months results in 
average steady -state plasma concentration  of 120ng/ml, which occurs after four weeks of 
continuous dosing  (31).  After oral administration, tamoxifen undergoes metabolism to its 
primary N -desmethyl  tamoxifen metabolite, which has similar biologic activity to tamoxifen. It is 
a substrate of cytochrome P -450 3A, 2C9 and 2D6, and is an inhibitor of P -glycoprotein.  
Excretion is primarily fecal  (31).   
 Tamoxifen is approved by [CONTACT_575267] 20 -40mg 
daily (divided dosing twice daily) and is primarily utilized for its antiestrogen properties  as an 
adjuvant therapy to prevent recurrence of estrogen receptor  (ER) positive breast carcinoma in 
post-menopausal women following mastectomy, axillary dissection and breast irradiation. It is 
also approved to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in high risk women (those with a 5 year 
predicted risk over 1.67% according to the Gail Model ). Usual dose and duration of therapy is  
20-40mg daily taken for up to  five years.  
When tamoxifen has been used previously at a dose of 10mg twice daily for [ADDRESS_755163] common reported effec t was 
headache, reported in up to 20% of users  (2). There are reported  serious adverse effects from 
long term tamoxifen use, but the short course of therapy in this study is unlikely to result in any 
of these adverse events. Risks with longer term use of tamoxifen may include endometrial 
changes such as hyperplasia, polyps, or malignancy, risk of venous thromboembolism, stroke or 
ovarian cysts. Of note, venous  thrombosis events were not reported until at least two 
consecutive months of use.  Likewise, an increased risk of endometrial cancer has only been 
demonstrated in postm enopausal women with use between [ADDRESS_755164]  cancer receiving tamoxifen  (31).  
   Use of tamoxifen  for this study is exempt from the requirements to submit an 
Investigational New Drug application to the FDA. This study is not intended to be used for 
support of new FDA indication for use or labeling for tamoxifen . This study is also not intended 
to support a significant change in advertising for tamoxifen . Lastly, this study does not use a 
route of administration or dosage level that is known to significantly increase th e risks 
associated with use of tamoxifen . As the dosage used in this study will be 10mg twice daily for 
seven days, it is anticipated that associated side effects will be rare and mild as previously 
reported when tamoxifen was used for a similar purpose fo r a 10 day course (2). In trials that 
have shown a non -statistically significant increased risk of pulmonary embolism and stroke in 
patients taking tamoxifen, >85% of these events have occurred in women 50 years of age or 
older who will not be included in this study  (31). More severe side effects as noted above are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_575254].  
 
1.3.6  Admission procedure  
OHSU IRB# [ADDRESS_755165] No. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Protocol Version 2.12.[ADDRESS_755166], cervical cytology evaluation (if not completed within 
the ASCCP recommended screening interval), and testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia (if 
indicated based on Centers f or Disease Control and Prevention screening algorithms ) will be 
performed  at the insertion visit  by [CONTACT_575268] .  Patients will have access to 
these results which will be in their primary medical records.  Bedside ultrasound may be 
performed to ensure correct fundal placement of the IUS per provider preference, but this is not 
routine care and will not be required.  Patients will be instructed on how to palpate their IUS 
strings.   
After the medical visit is  complete, interested and eligible participants will meet with 
study staff to complete the informed consent process. Consenting of Spanish -speaking patients 
will be performed with use of an in -person or phone Spanish interpreter to ensure inform ed 
consent.  Study forms translated into Spanish will be available. Baseline demographic 
information will be collected by [CONTACT_575269], including menstrual history, contraception history, 
sexual and pregnancy history, BMI/weight, ethnicity, age, and baseline use of  panty liners (as 
advised by [CONTACT_575270]/spotting days)  (32). Subjects will 
receive training on the use of the bleeding diary procedures  including the text message/email 
and paper diaries . Estimated tim e to complete study procedures during the clinic visit is [ADDRESS_755167] in participating in the study but are unsure of their 
desire to enroll immediately, there will be the option of returning  to the clinic  within three days of 
IUS insertion to complete the enrollment study procedures as described above. Prospective 
bleeding data will be collected starting on the day of enrollment. Women who enroll after their 
insertion visit will verbally provide data for b leeding or spotting that occurred after insertion and 
prior to enrollment.   
Between IUS insertion and study visit 1 (occurring 14 -21 days after insertion), b aseline 
bleeding with the LNG-IUS will be prospectively collected using bleeding diaries.  This da ta will 
be used later as a covariate in analysis. A co-investigator (ob/gyn physician) will call each 
subject after at least [ADDRESS_755168] ion 1.3.4 . Subjects reporting concerns 
with their IUS will be referred to their primary provider or scheduled for a triage visit in family 
planning clinic to be examined by a physician as clinically indicated.  
At study visit 1, bleeding diaries will be rev iewed, and VAS scales (0-100mm) will be 
completed  to obtain baseline asse ssment of bleeding satisfaction with  the LNG-IUS. Each 
subject will receive one bottle of their assigned medication.  Participants will be instructed to 
begin use of the study medication on day 21 after the insertion of their LNG -IUS and continue to 
take a twice daily oral dose of 10 mg for seven  days.  Estimated time to complete this visit is 15 
minutes. Participants will  receive a single text message or email reminder on the day they are 
due to start study medication.  There will not be any spe cimens collected at this visit and there 
will be no results to share with subjects.  
 
1.3.7 Follow -up procedure  
Bleeding diaries  
 The primary outcome  variable  of this study is the total number of bleeding/spotting days 
over [ADDRESS_755169] 
bleeding data, all subjects will be asked to complete  both paper and electronic bleeding diaries.   
For the electronic bleeding diary, after initial enrollment, participants will start receiving a daily 
text or email message from a study -affiliated messaging service ( developed with Mir3, San 
Diego, CA) prompting a response about their bleeding for the day.  Subjects can indicate at 
enrollment whether they want to receive the message via text or email. This approach using the 
OHSU IRB# [ADDRESS_755170] No. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Protocol Version 2.12.2016  
 
9 same service prov ider has been previously used by [CONTACT_575271] -
time response rates (>90%) (33). The text message /email  bleeding diary for this project was 
uniquely designed by [CONTACT_575272]3 to fit the needs of this study.  Subject ID numbers and 
their cell phone numbers or email addresses are entered into the system to allow subjects to  
receive messages and send responses to the study database.  The company adheres to a strict 
privacy policy for phone numbers in the system, wh ich is  detailed in section 1.3.10 .  In the daily 
text or email  message, subjects are asked to classify their bleeding using the terminology 
recommended by [CONTACT_575273]  (32).  This includes for a given 24-hour period whether the 
woman has experienced:  
 1. Bleeding – any day during which bleeding requires the use of protection with a 
tampon, pad or panty liner.    
 2. Spotting – Minimal blood loss that does not require the use of any pro tection including 
panty l iners (Use of precautionary liners does not qualify as spotting).     
 3. No bleeding  
A second message will be sent one minute after the first to inquire whether subjects took the 
study medication that day.  If the subject does not respond to the text  or email  messages, a 
second set of texts or emails (2) will be sent the following morning.  The subject has only these 
two chances to report their bleeding information for that day, and otherwise must use the paper 
diary.  Responses to the messaging system wi ll be compi[INVESTIGATOR_40177] a secured web database by 
[CONTACT_575274]3, which can be accessed by [CONTACT_575275].  Paper diaries will also be provided for use in case of technical difficulty in receiving 
or responding to text  or email  messages.  Subjects are encouraged to complete paper diaries in 
addition to the electronic diary.   
 
Follow up visits  
 Thirty days after initiating study drug, p articipants will receive an email with a link to a 
final study online survey via REDCap (attached). This survey will include questions assessing 
side effects, adverse events, and bleeding and IUS satisfaction. The satisfaction questions will 
utilize a n electronic  100-mm vi sual analog scale.  This study survey should take approximately 
5-10 minutes to complete.  Subjects not returning the survey within 7 days will be contact[CONTACT_54407], text or email (based on stated contact [CONTACT_66178]) and reminded to reply.   
 
Compensation  
  Subjects will be compensated $10 at enrollment and $[ADDRESS_755171] study visit , which 
totals $ 40.  Additionally, subjects will be provided with compensation for completing the 
electronic bleeding diaries  after use of study drug . Subjects wi ll receive an additional $1 each 
day that they respond to the electronic messages  (up to 30 days total)  and $20 for completing 
the final survey .  This is a total of up to $ [ADDRESS_755172] is a maximum of $ 90. Compensation 
will be loaded onto a debit card, which participants will receive at the enrolment visit.  
 
1.3.[ADDRESS_755173] common 
side effects reported with long term use are hot flushes (33%), bone pain (6%), gastrointestinal 
distress  (5%) , or fatigue  (4%)  (31). Risks of endometrial pathology including endometrial 
hyperplasia have been associated with long -term use of tamoxifen, but not with short -term use 
(31). Other risks of long -term use include increased risk of blood clots and stroke. Among 
women who developed pulmonary emboli, diagnosis occurred at a mean of [ADDRESS_755174] event reported at 2 months of treatment (31). Women 
OHSU IRB# [ADDRESS_755175] No. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Protocol Version 2.12.[ADDRESS_755176] reported was headache in up to 20% of women  
Women with a contraindication to tamoxifen use will b e excluded from this study. This 
includes pregnant women given concern for teratogenicity. It is not known if tamoxifen is 
excreted in breast milk, but it has been shown to inhibit lactation. It has also been shown to 
cause reproductive tract lesions in ex posed neonatal rodents (31), thus lactating women will 
also be excluded. Women regularly taking medications that interact with tamoxifen will also be 
excluded as described in section 1.3.3.  
Other risks to participants include time spent participating in study without guarantee of 
benefit. It is estimated that daily time spent on participation will be no more than five minutes per 
day, in addition to the [ADDRESS_755177] a right to refuse 
disclosure of any questions they do not wish to discuss.  
 
Benefits :  
Participants  may or may not personally benefit from being in this study. There is a 
possibility the study drug will improve participants’  bleeding pattern s and satisfaction with their 
LNG-IUS.   
 
1.3.[ADDRESS_755178] for any 
reason; the reason for withdrawal will be recorded in detail. Subjects wishing to discontinue their 
LNG-IUS while enrolled in the study will terminate their participation with the study as of  IUS 
remo val.  These subjects will be asked to complete the final online study survey  prior to  IUS 
removal to review bleeding profiles and satisfaction questions.  No further data will be obtained 
from the patient once withdrawal occurs. Any data obtained up to this point will be analyzed in 
accordance with intention to treat.  
 We will have close contact [CONTACT_575276].  
Failure to respond to the bleeding diary for three consecutive days will prompt a phone call from  
the study coordinator to inquire about technological difficulties versus disinterest in the study.  If 
we are unable to reach a subject  by [CONTACT_648] , email or letter over two weeks, their participation will 
be terminated.  Likewise, subjects declining to retu rn for the study visit  or complete the final 
survey  will be discontinued from the study.  Any data obtained up to this point will be analyzed in 
accordance with intention to treat.  
 If a subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study, her partici pation will be 
discontinued.  She will be asked to come in for a study visit with the investigator.  Her study 
medication will be unblinded and she will receive counseling from the investigator on how to 
seek medical care.   
   
1.3.[ADDRESS_755179] institutional practices will be followed as described in the OHSU Information

Analysis will be performed with the blinded data.  P value of 0.05 defines statistical significance.  
Randomization will be as sessed and if there is imbalance found between treatment and placebo 
groups, regression analyses will be completed to accommodate these differences.   
 
Primary objectives : The primary measurement for this study will be the  mean  number of 
bleeding or spotting (b/s) days experienced by [CONTACT_575278] [ADDRESS_755185] baseline data on b/s days 
in the 21-day run-in period  to confirm that the  random ization was successful in allotting women 
with equivalent baseline b/s days to each group.  Each day, subjects will indicate via numeric 
coded text  or email  message response whether they had spotting, bleeding, or no ne.  From 
these diaries, c ounts of total bleeding/spotting  days will be obtained. Other secondary bleeding 
outcomes will be examined including number of bleeding/spotting epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], the number of 
prolonged bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (>8 days), and the longest bleeding -free interval . Comparis ons 
between groups will be made using a n independent  samp le two sided  t-test. Data will be 
analyzed in an intention -to-treat fashion. If data are very skewed, non -parametric methods will 
be used to compare groups.  
  
Secondary objectives : 
1. Satisfaction  and side effects  
 At the study visit and in the final survey,  subjects will answer questions regarding their 
satisfaction with the IUS and their bleeding patterns, acceptability of bleeding, as well as side 
effects and adverse events. Satisfaction respons es will be quantified using a visual analog scale 
between 0 -100mm. Discontinuation from the study and discontinuation of the IUS during the 
study will be monitored as markers of dissatisfaction. Comparison of means between tamoxifen  
and placebo groups will  be made using two sided t -tests , and side effects will be reported 
descriptively.  
 
 
1.3.1 2 Study limitations  
Medication dosing :  The only prior published study to evaluate tamoxifen for this indication 
utilized 20mg daily (split dosing) for 10 days.  However, the differences in bleeding patterns 
were detected within 3 -7 days of starting medication; 82% of tamoxifen users stopped bleeding 
OHSU IRB# [ADDRESS_755186] No. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Protocol Version 2.12.2016  
 
13 within 7 days, compared to 56% of placebo (p=0.005).  A shorter medication course is easier for 
patients and would b e preferred if the clinical effect was the same , and a completed study at 
OHSU utilized a seven -day course .  Therefore, we are also studying a seven -day course of 
tamoxifen, administered 10mg twice daily.  
 
Study follow up : In prior similar studies, subjects recorded prospective daily bleeding diaries for 
[ADDRESS_755187]. Jeong Lim in the department of Ob/Gyn  at OHSU.   
 
1.5 Links with other projects  
This study is not linked to other projects.  
 
1.6 Main problems anticipated  
Recruitment : The family planning clinic  at OHSU provides insertion of approximately 3-[ADDRESS_755188] clinics.  By 
[CONTACT_575279], we anticipate 
that recruitment will be feasible to complete within six months.  
 
Retention : The short duration of the study and minimal follow up procedures should maximize 
retention.   Similar prior studies in the LNG-IUS had low dropout rates , all with <20% loss to 
follow up (16,26,27) .  The proposed  project is shorter duration ( 51 days  total), which should 
decrease dropout  even further .  Nevertheless, o ur sample size was designed to acco unt for a 
20% dropout rate due to this risk of poor retention in women experiencing ongoing  bleeding.  
Details on how we will manage loss to follow up are included in section 1.3.7.  
 
Bleeding diaries :  The text or email  message bleeding diary through Mir3 has been utilized in 
similar studies with excellent response rates.  However, a portion of participants in older studies 
had difficult receiving or responding to text messages due to incompatible cell phone  
technology.  Subjects who have difficulty receiving or responding to daily text messages can opt 
to receive identical email study survey messages instead and will have a paper diary to use as 
backup, which will utilize the exact same question and response  categories.   
 
Any unanticipated problems will be addressed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_575258] -investigators , with 
changes to the protocol as needed.  Unanticipated problems could include  medication side 
OHSU IRB# [ADDRESS_755189] No. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Protocol Version 2.12.[ADDRESS_755190] 4 0%.  We anticipate that subjects using tamoxifen  to manage bleeding will 
report higher satisfaction with their bleeding profiles and with the LNG-IUS, and t hat more 
women receiving tamoxifen  will report their bleeding as acceptable.  Overall, improvements in 
bleeding patterns will translate into better overall acceptability of this highly effective LARC, 
which should imp rove continuation and uptake.  Increasing the uptake and continuation of 
LARCs such as the LNG-IUS  will lead to a reduction in unplanned pregnancies, which is  a 
major public health concern  (1,9). 
 The results of this study will be submitted for publication in a journal specific  to obstetrics 
and gynecology, and will be presented to the national family planning professional community at 
the annual Family Planni ng Fellowship meeting.

Bleeding diary guide  
(to be reviewed at the first visit, and given to each subject to take home)  
 
Every day that you are in the study, you should receive two messages at about 8pm.  The first 
message will ask about your bleeding.  You should respond with the number that corresponds 
to your bleeding for that day.   
You can choose:  
1. Bleeding – any day when your bleeding requires the use of protection with a tampon, 
pad or panty liner.  It can be light or heavy.   
2. Spotting – Minimal bleeding that does no t require the use of any protection.  For 
example, spotting just on toilet paper.  
3. No bleeding - If you wear a pantyliner “just in case,” but don’t have bleeding, choose 
this response.   
 
The second message will ask if you took the study drug on that day .   
You can choose:  
 1. Yes  
 2. No  
 
When you fill out the paper diary, please use this same code.

First-Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655854]:  Schizophrenia  
Objective(s):  The primary objective of the study is:  
• To determine the effectiveness of treatment with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655855] (TAU) as defined by [CONTACT_656003][INVESTIGATOR_602].  
The secondary objectives of the study are to:  
• Determine the effect of treatment with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655856] 2 -year study 
duration  
• Determine the effectiveness of treatment with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655857].  
The outcomes are:  
o Reducing the number of days in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371891] [ADDRESS_883195] of care  
o Improving neuropsychological functioning  
Study Design:  This is a cluster randomized, two -arm, rater -blind, multi -center, parallel -group study 
designed to compare the effectiveness and changes in brain structure volumes of 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655858] -epi[INVESTIGATOR_655859] (EP) schizophrenia.  
Approximately 40 sites will participate in the study in order to enroll approximately 
500 subjects during 1  year of recruiting.  Subje cts will be recruited into two cohorts:  the 
first-epi[INVESTIGATOR_655860], with approximately [ADDRESS_883196] -epi[INVESTIGATOR_655861] r for the target is reached.  
Sites, as a cluster, will be randomized , with half of the sites assigned to the long -acting 
injectable (LAI) aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655862].  
One screening visit will occur over approximately [ADDRESS_883197] their assessments.  
After screening, two baseline visits will occur, which will be no more than 4  weeks apart .

Following the baseline visits and once tolerability has been established , subjects at the LAI 
sites wi ll be scheduled for once monthly medication v isits for aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655869] , and subjects at the TAU sites will be scheduled for medication visits  as required 
based on their TAU  medications (i.e., at a minimum of every 3  months) .  All subjects will 
receive bimonthly phone calls inquiring about any visits to emergency rooms and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] s.  All subjects will receive phone calls ever y 4 months to complete the 
SURF .  The calls will be conducted by [CONTACT_656007].   All subjects are required to attend an  
in-person  visit every 6  months ( i.e., 6, 12, 18, and 24 months) during the [ADDRESS_883199] them at any time.  At the 6 -, 12-, 18-, and 24- month visits, the 
following assessments will be performed:  
• Information on use of services, insurance status, work, school attendance, and 
other service use outcomes will be assessed using the SURF (i.e., 12 - and 
24-month visits only)  
• Height, body weight, waist circumference, temperature, pulse and blood pressure 
will be measured  
• Fasting blood samples for clinical laboratory testing will be collected including a 
lipid panel (i.e., cholesterol:  total, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides), a metabolic 
profile, prolactin and fasting insulin concentrations, and a CBC with differential  
• Urine pregnancy test  
• Asse ssments for psychopathology using BPRS and CGI -S (i.e., 12 - and 24-  month 
visits only)  
• Completion of C -SSRS (i.e., 12 - and 24- month visits only)  
• Administration of LAI medications including aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655870]  
• Completion o f the Medication Visit Record , including details of dispensing, 
prescribing, and administration information where appropriate 
• Reporting and recording of adverse events  
• Completion of the RBANS to measure neuropsychological function ( i.e., 12- and 
24-month visits only)  
• Completion of QLS  (i.e., 12- and 24- month visits only)  
Because subjects  with schizophrenia have an estimated 8.5 -fold greater risk of suicide than 
the general population, with young patients particularly at risk , subjects in this study will 
be monitored closely for suicidality at each study visit.   Instances of suicidality will be 
captured using an expanded serious adverse event form, and potential for suicidality will be 
monitored using the C -SSRS at the 12 - and 24- month visits and at any othe r appropriate 
time, per the investigator’s judgment.  
In addition, a subset of an expected [ADDRESS_883200]-epi[INVESTIGATOR_655871] 
10 clinical sites will undergo MRI at the baseline,  12- and 24- month visits to measure brain 
structure volumes and white matter integrity.  
The MRI sites ( i.e., Five  TAU and Five  LAI) will be selected based on close proximity to 
centers with research MRI capabilities.  The first 57  subjects at both the TAU an d LAI sites 
consenting to MRI will be enrolled into the MRI portion of the study.

Amendment 2.0  7 INTRODUCTION  
Non-adherence remains an enormous challenge in schizophrenia.  Long -acting injectable (LAI) 
antipsychotics have been shown in some mirror  image, naturalistic , and ra ndomized clinical trials 
(RCT s) to significantly reduce rates of relapse and re- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655895].  However, a recent meta -analysis 1 of RCTs did not show  an overall advantage.  
This change from a previous analysis published only 2 years ago2 is largely due to the findings of 
two recent studies funded by [CONTACT_92524]’s Administration and National Institutes of Mental 
Health3,4, which were both unable to demonstrate superiority for LAIs, despi[INVESTIGATOR_655896] e-of-the-art 
methodology.  Given the apparent disconnect between some naturalistic data5,[ADDRESS_883221] tra ditionally been 
conducted do not really succeed in recruiting representative patients or in fully achieving an 
effectiveness treatment trial model for LAIs.  A well -designed effectiveness trial that overcomes 
the limitations of prior studies is necessary to better address the question of the utility of LAIs in 
settings that approximate real world care.   Health policy makers, payers and providers , particularly 
those in the [LOCATION_002] ( US), will be less likely to actively facilitate the use of LAIs, unless  
there is compelling evidence to support their use , including cost effectiveness data. 
Given the increasing recognition that early and effective interventions hold the greatest promise 
for improving the overall trajectory and outcome of schizophrenia , including rates of recovery, it 
is particularly important to determine the impact of “guaranteed medication” in the earliest 
possible phases of illness.  This is underscored by [CONTACT_65357] -documented enormous challenge of 
medication acceptance and adherence among  first-epi[INVESTIGATOR_655897] (EP) patients.  In 
addition, there are some suggestions that LAI medication administration may be particularly 
effective in the early phase of schizophrenia 7-10. 
Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655898] a large simple trial because monthly 
administration more closely mirrors clinical practice.  In both recent LAI studies, risperidone microspheres were used, which require  biweekly  administration .  Moreover, the relatively lower 
side effect burden of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655899], 
including  paliperidone, the only other once -monthly second gener ation antipsychotic, increases its 
acceptability for and utility in EP  patients.  
7.1 BRAIN
 CHANGES  IN SCHIZOPHRENIA  
Antipsychotic medications are widely prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders ; thus, understanding their potential impact on the brain has significant health 
implications.  Moreover, better understanding of how brain changes relate to long -term 
antipsychotic treatment could improve our understanding of the mechanisms of antipsychotic 
efficacy  (especially in the  developi[INVESTIGATOR_38866]) , inform neurobiological models of schizophrenia , and 
translate into improved clinical care by [CONTACT_656010] -term cognitive and 
functional outcome.  The early phase of psychosis is likely the most critical period for tre atment 
intervention, and the ideal time to study key mechanisms associated with brain plasticity.  
There is now considerable evidence that both typi[INVESTIGATOR_655900].  Initial longitudinal studies

Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (ABILIFY®) is a dopamine partial agonist discovered by [CONTACT_35022].,

of countries in Asia, Europe, and Latin America.  The aripi[INVESTIGATOR_123130] -release IM injection 
formulation is approved for agitation in schizophrenia and bipolar mania in the US and EU.  In addition, an oral solution formulation and orall y disintegrating ( i.e., dispersible) tablets have been 
approved and marketed for use in the US and EU.  The favorable side effect profile of oral 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], including its low incidence of extrapyramidal s ide effect s (EPS), low risk of prolactin 
elevatio n, decreased adrenergic and anticholinergic side effects, and minimal weight gain, makes 
it an excellent candidate for an LAI formulation.  The aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655905].

It seems likely that the favorable safety and tolerability profile of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], including its low incidence of EPS, lack of prolactin elevation, decreased adrenergic and anticholinergic side effects, and decreased weight gain, is also mediated by [CONTACT_123258].

15, 20, and 30 mg for the treatment of acute relapse of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  The two 4- week studies ( i.e., 31-97-201
27 and 31- 97-[ZIP_CODE]) each included two fixed doses of 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] ( i.e., 15 mg and 30 mg for 31- 97-201 and 20 mg and 30 mg for 31 -97-202), an active 
comparator for comparison of safety profiles, and placebo.  R eview of the data from these studies 
indicated that all of the doses of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_123136].  All aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655907] (PANSS)

expected, the active comparators  haloperidol and risperidone  demonstrated effectiveness in the 
treatment of psychosis as measured by [CONTACT_123259].  The third double -blind, 
placebo -controlled, Phase  3 study ( i.e., CN138001)
29 was 6  weeks in duration and included 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_123138] 10, 15, and 20 mg.  All doses of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_123139]. 
Three Phase 3, double -blind, controlled studies were conducted to show the long -term efficacy of 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253].  Study CN138047
30,31 was a 26 -week study designed to document the long -term 
efficacy of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 15  mg compared with placebo in stable schizophrenic subjects.  The 
primary efficacy variable was time to relapse from randomization, as measured by [CONTACT_656012]- Improvement score ≥  5, PANSS scores for hostility or uncooperativeness ≥  5, or 
≥ 20% increase in  PANSS total score.  The results indicated that subjects treated with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 
15 mg daily experienced a significantly longer time to relapse over the 26 -week assessment period 
compared with those receiving placebo.  Two 52- week studies ( i.e., 31-98-217 and 
31-98-304-01)32,33 of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 30 mg versus haloperidol 10 mg were conducted in acutely 
relapsing schizophrenic subjects with the intention of pooling the data for analysis.  On the primary efficacy measure ( i.e., time to failure to maintain response in responders) , no difference was seen 
between aripi[INVESTIGATOR_123140].  However, analysis of secondary efficacy measures showed that aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] [ADDRESS_883225] -rated and investigator -rated acceptabil ity of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655908]- label studies.  Subjects treated with open -label aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 10  to 30 mg for 8  weeks

7.4.2 Agitation Studies with Injectable Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655912] -release IM aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655913] -term ( i.e., 24-hour) placebo- controlled studies38.  Two studies in agitated inpatients 
with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder showed that

28-day washout, subjects who qualified ( i.e., based on no significant adverse events [AEs] or 
clinical laboratory abnormalities) received a single dose of 15, 50, 100, 200, 300, or [ADDRESS_883229] AEs were mild (43%) to moderate (33%) in 
severity.  The most commonly reported treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) were 
headache (4  subj ects, 19%) and anxiety (3 subjects, 14.3%).  All other AEs occurred in ≤  2 
subjects.  There were no discontinuations due to AEs and none of the AEs appeared to be 
dose-related.  There were two serious adverse events (SAEs) ( i.e., attempted suicide and 
exacerbation of schizophrenia) that were considered to be unrelated to study drug.  
Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Inc. conducted a P hase 1B study ( i.e., 
31-05-244) to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of multiple doses of the arip iprazole once 
monthly  formulation in subjects with schizophrenia.  The results showed that once  monthly 
administration of the 400 -mg and 300- mg IM injections resulted in mean aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655914] 10 to 
30 mg oral aripi[INVESTIGATOR_123153].  All three doses of 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_123104]  (i.e., 200, 300, and 400 mg) demonstrated acceptable safety, 
tolerability, and potential effectiveness39.

placebo and reported by ≥ 5% of subjects receiving aripi[INVESTIGATOR_123104] .  The increased rate 
of tremor over placebo treatment was consistent in studies with oral aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], as also reported in the aripi[INVESTIGATOR_123161].  Generally, AEs of tremor were m ild in severity and occurred 
with a low frequency throughout the study.  No report of tremor was classified as a SAE or was associated with discontinuation of treatment.  There were no clinically relevant findings with regard to laboratory values, vital si gns, weight, electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, EPS, 
suicidality, or injection site.

subjects were treated with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92563] 180 days or longer , 2,259 (15.0%) subjects received 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655916] 360  days, and 933 (6.2%) subjects continued  aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655917] 720  days.  
Across the short -term, double -blind, placebo -controlled studies conducted in schizophrenic 
subjects, the AE profile of oral aripi[INVESTIGATOR_123164].  There was little difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to AEs between aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] -treated 
(7%) and placebo -treated (9%) subjects.  Akathisia was the only commonly observed AE that 
occurred in ≥  5% of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] -treated subjects and with  an incidence of more than twice that of

In the pooled analysis of the two 52- week studies comparing aripi[INVESTIGATOR_123166], the 
incidence of EPS -related AEs was significantly higher for haloperidol (58%) compared with 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (27%).  In the one 52- week study in which prolactin levels were measured, 
significantly fewer aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] -treated subjects (3.4%) experienced prolactin elevations above the 
upper limit of normal compared with the haloperidol group (61%)33.

Elderly patients with dementia -related psychosis treated with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_123176], including

10-week, placebo -controlled studies of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655920]’s disease, the rate of death in aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] -treated subjects was 3.5%, compared 
with a rate of 1.7% in the placebo group during or within [ADDRESS_883233] of the deaths 
were either cardiovascular ( e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious ( e.g., pneumonia ) in 
nature.  Overall, 1.3% of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] -treated subjects reported cerebrovascular AEs ( e.g., stroke, 
transient ischemic attack) compared with 0.6% of placebo -treated subjects in these studies.  This 
difference was not statistically significant ; however , in one fixed -dose study, there was a 
significant dose -response relationship for cerebrovascular AEs in patients treated with

accidental overdose with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_123180] ( i.e., up to 195 mg) in children were received with no 
fatalities.  The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported  included somnolence 
and transient loss of consciousness.  In the patients who were evaluated in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69225], there were no reported observations indicating clinically important adverse changes in vital signs, laboratory assessments, or ECGs.  Additi onal information can be obtained from the ABILIFY US

Collaborative Protocol COL.AOM.2013.[ADDRESS_883234] significantly greater effectiveness than treatment as usual 
(TAU) based on time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655921].  
The proposed study will also test the hypothesis tha t better antipsychotic medication compliance 
using aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655922].  Ultimately, the identification of in vivo  
biomarkers , such as change in brain structure volumes or cortical thickness,  that reflect these 
processes could help clarify mechanisms of action for effective treatment intervention.  
In addition, we believe that treatment with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655923]:  
• Reducing total number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371891] 2 years of follow -up 
• Reducing psychopathology than TAU  
• Significantly lower cost of care than TAU  
• Improve cognitive functioning and quality of life  
We believe that LAIs are grossly under used in much of the world and should be the TAU standard for patients receiving antipsychotics.  The current design directly addresses the question if a 
clinician has  a patient on oral medication should they keep that patient on their ongoing oral regime 
or switch to an LAI?  The answer to this question could change current clinical practice.  
Regarding the risk of deterioration, in the 52 -week, placebo- controlled trial of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655924]
41, there was a 3% "lack of efficacy" discontinuation rate in the switch to oral aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655925] a 2% "lack of efficacy" discontinuation rate in the switch from oral to aripi[INVESTIGATOR_123104].  We believe that the 3% discontinuation rate is relevant to the present discussion, whereas the 2% discontinuation rate is an inevitable part of the process of switching t o the LAI formulation 
of the same drug.  
In this study (i.e., COL.AOM.2013.005), we will employ training for all LAI sites on the proper process for switching from oral medications to LAIs  using a two -stage model t hat 1) facilitate s 
engagement and developme nt of a therapeutic alliance, followed by 2) completion of enrollment 
in the study and administration of LAI aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253].  This model has been used successfully in prior trials and is designed to provide information regarding the possibilities and potenti al value 
of LAI treatment7.  
In the Stroup et al. study

mass index (BMI) ≥  27 and non- high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ≥  130 mg/dl who were

Twenty -two (20.6%) of the patients who switched and 18 (17.0%) of the patients who stayed on 
their medication experienced protocol -defined efficacy failure.  Although overall more patients in 
the switch versus stay arm discontinued the study prematurely (43.9% versus 24.5%), it is 
important to note that there was no significant difference in time to efficacy failure ( i.e., hazard 
ratio for switching  = 0.747; 95% confidence interval  = 0.395 – 1.413, p = 0.3703).  There were 
also no differences between groups in psychopathology changes as measured by [CONTACT_656013], change in CGI -S score, or change in the Medical Outcomes Study 12- Item Short -Form 
Health Survey mental health scores.  
In a 16 -week, double -blind study, 173 subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who 
were previously treated with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_655926] (n =  88) 
or stay on olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (n = 85)43.  Primary and secondary endpoints were me an weight change from 
baseline and percentage change from baseline in fasting triglyceride levels, respectively.  Patients 
must have been on olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_655927] [ADDRESS_883235] 24 and a 
CGI-S score of ≤  4 (i.e., moderately ill , mean  = 3.0 ±  0.9) to be included in the study.  In this study, 
56 (63.6%) of the 88 patients who switched to oral aripi[INVESTIGATOR_34829] 63 (74.1%) of 85 patients who 
stayed on their previous olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_655928] 16 -week study.  This was a differ ence 
of 9.5% when switching from one of the most antihistaminergic and anticholinergic second -generation antipsychotics.  Specifically, discontinuations in the switch arm from 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_655929] 8% and 9% for intolerability and 8% versus 0% for inefficacy, respectively.  
Although there were some increased rates of discontinuation in the switch arm compared with the 
stay arm  in both studies reviewed above , the differences were not large.  Moreover, in our opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], 
this risk would be even lower in first -epi[INVESTIGATOR_655930], as they tend to be more responsive 
to medications in general and less likely to deteriorate when switched from one drug to another.  
This argument is further supported by [CONTACT_96101] a diffe rence in efficacy between antipsychotics 
in first -epi[INVESTIGATOR_34923], including even clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_53530] a comparator
44,45. 
In addition, for stable EP patients, there is no ethically acceptable rationale to require a change in medication from one oral formulation to another, unless there are side effects or clini cal symptoms 
justifying such a change.  Parenthetically, a switch due to intolerability or inefficacy may very well be an outcome in the naturalistic oral antipsychotic comparison group during the duration of the trial, so that at the end the two groups wi ll not be as polarized as 100% switch versus 0% switch.  
On the other hand, the change from oral to an LAI is ethically justifiable, as we are hypothesizing 
that for stable patients this will lead to a better long -term outcome.  If we required all patients to 
be appropriate for a medication change, based on lack of efficacy or intolerability, this would limit 
an already precious sample to a degree that would make the study impossible to do.  Moreover, as suggested above, the thrust of this study of using LAI  formulations as a preemptive and preventive 
step in all patients who can be expected to relapse as time goes on would be undermined.

41, our healthy volunteers 
demonstrated strong correlations between DS and dorsal prefrontal cortex , including both lateral 
and medial aspects, and between VS and ventral prefrontal cortex ( i.e., primarily me dial).  
Importantly, upon re -scanning after 12 weeks, healthy subjects showed no significant longitudinal 
changes in functional interactions of DS or VS.  As symptoms improved in patients , both of the 
striatal structures showed an increase in correlative activity within the prefrontal cortex in the “normal” dorso- ventral pattern ( Figure  2).  Specifically, DS showed an increase in functional 
connectivity in a region within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as positive symptoms improved.  
Similarly, as positive symptoms improve d, functional connectivity of VS  was increased to a region 
within the ventral prefrontal cortex.  Overall , these results suggest that “frontalization” and 
normalization of frontostriatal connections may underlie the successful treatment of psychosis.

the subject may be pregnant.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Blood Pressure  
Blood pressure  measurements ( i.e., systolic and diastolic blood pressure [mmHg] ) will be obtained 
at the visits designated on the Schedule s of Assessments ( Table 3 and Table 4)  by a validated 
method.  Blood pressure will be measured after the subject has been sitting for 5 minutes and then 
standing after 3  minutes, but no longer than 5 minutes .  All blood pressure  measurements should 
be performed on the same arm, preferably by [CONTACT_3194].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events and Other Events of Interest  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational product.  An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study drug .  For this study, the study drugs are  aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655954].  
The criteria for identifying AEs are:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (incl uding an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product  
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease  
• Any deterio ration in nonprotocol -required measurements of a laboratory value or other 
clinical test ( e.g., ECG or x -ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation of study drug 
Collaborative Protocol COL.AOM.2013.005  
 Page 43 of 73 29 October 2015  
Amendment 2.0  • Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition ( e.g., headache)  not present pretreatment 
(i.e., baseline)  
• An abnormal laboratory test result should be considered an AE if the identified laboratory 
abnormality leads to any type of intervention, whether prescribed in the protocol or not  
A laboratory result should be considered by [CONTACT_76702]:  
• Results in the withdrawal of study drug 
• Results in withholding of study drug pending some investigational outcome  
• Results in an intervention, based on medical evaluation ( e.g., potassium supplement for 
hypokal emia)  
• Results in any out of range laboratory value that in the investigator’s judgment fulfills the definitions of an AE with regard to the subject’s medical profile  
All AEs observed during the study will be reported on the CRF.  All AEs, regardless of relationship 
to study drug or procedure, should be collected beginning from the time the subject signs the study ICF through the last visit.  Serious AEs will be collected for [ADDRESS_883267] dose or at the 
Follow -up Visit, whichever comes later . 
Abnormal laboratory values should not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered part of the 
clinical syndrome that is being reported as an AE.  Any laboratory abnormality considered to constitute an AE should be reported as an AE on the CRF. 
It is the  responsibility of the investigator to review all laboratory findings in all subjects and 
determine if they constitute an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified a s an AE.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to review the results of the C -SSRS  in all subjects and 
determine if any result constitutes an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated suicidality rating  scale response should be classified as an AE (see 
Other Safety Assessments [ Section  [IP_ADDRESS]] for a description of the C -SSRS ). 
Every effort must be made by [CONTACT_256391].  
A
SSESSING SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
AEs will be graded on a 3- point scale ( i.e., mild, moderate, and severe) and reported in detail as 
indicated on t he CRF.  The definitions are as follows:  
Mild:  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption of normal daily activity  
Moderate:  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
Collaborative Protocol COL.AOM.2013.005  
 Page 44 of 73 29 October 2015  
Amendment 2.0  Severe:  Incapacitating, with inability to work or to perform normal da ily activity  
The criteria for assessing severity are different than those used for seriousness (see Serious 
Adverse Events and Other Events of Interest [ Section  [IP_ADDRESS]] for the definition of an SAE).  
The causal relationship of the study drug to an AE will be assessed as related or unrelated, as follows:  
Related:  
Definite:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the AE, 
when the event responds to withdrawal of the study drug (i.e., dechallenge), and recurs with rechallenge by [CONTACT_123268].  
Probable:  There is a reasonable caus al relationship between the study drug and the AE.  
The event responds to dechallenge.  Rechallenge is not required.  
Possible:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the AE.   
Dechallenge is lacking or unclear.  
Unrelated:  
Not Likely:  There is a temporal relationship to study drug administration, but not a 
reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the event.  
Not Related:  There is not a temporal or causal relationship to the study drug 
administration.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events and Other Events of Interest  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening ( i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE  as it 
occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the child of a subject who was exposed to the study drug 
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], when ba sed on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes in the definition of SAE listed above 
Collaborative Protocol COL.AOM.2013.[ADDRESS_883268] include pregnancy or exposure to study drug through breastfeeding; AEs associated with study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error; and any treatment -emergent significant laboratory abnormality.  These events of interest are 
to be captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered SAEs only if they meet one of the above criteria.  All AEs associated with events of interest are to be reported on the CRF whether 
or not they meet the criteria for SAEs.  
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3517] “adverse event” (i.e., there is no untoward medical occurrence) associated with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28689]: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3095]  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655955] -study drug administration  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3521] a device ( e.g., battery replac ement) that was in 
place before study entry  
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Safety Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Body Weight, Body Mass Index, Height  
An assessment for potential of prolactin- related effects will be performed via measurement of body 
weight (kg), height (m, for determination of BMI), and determination of BMI.  
The calculation for BMI is:  
weight (kg)  
[height (m)]2 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_883269] is a standardized form on which the medication name, dose, and regimen 
are recorded for prescribed medications.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Suicidality  
All subjects will be treated as usual in the clinic for any suspected suicidality or suicidal ideation, irrespective of study involvement.  For the purpose s of the study, in these cases, suicidality 
information will be collected on the SAE form, and a clinical intervention assessment of risk will be performed per the PI’s judgment.  
In addition, the C -SSRS will be performed at 12- month intervals during the st udy. 
Collaborative Protocol COL.AOM.2013.005  
 Page 46 of 73 29 October 2015  
Amendment 2.0  COLUMBIA SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE  
The C -SSRS was designed to distinguish the domains of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior.  
The baseline C -SSRS form will be completed at baseline of Phase  1.  Later  C-SSRS assessments  
will be completed at 1 year and 2  years . 
Four constructs are measured:  
1. The severity of ideation ( i.e., the “severity subscale”)  is rated on a 5 -point ordinal scale 
with 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts 
with methods, 4 = suici dal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. 
2. The intensity of ideation subscale ( i.e., the “intensity subscale”)  rates frequency, duration, 
controllability, deter rents, and reason for ideation on a 5- point ordinal scale. 
3. The behavior subscale  rates  actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; 
and non- suicidal self -injurious behavior on a nominal scale.  
4. The lethality subscale assesses actual attempts; actual lethality is rated on a 6 -point ordinal 
scale, and if actual lethality is 0, potential lethality of attempts is rated on a 3 -point ordinal 
scale.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_883270] review 
guidelines about study  participation for women of childbearing potenti al.  The topi[INVESTIGATOR_444441]:  
• General information  
• ICF 
• Pregnancy prevention information 
• Drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives  
• Contraceptives in current use  
• Guidelines for the follow -up of a reported pregnancy  
Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of 
avoiding pregnancy during study  participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy.  Specifically, investigators will review with subjects all applicable information about 
pregnancy and lactation in the FDA -approved prescribing information for medications in the 
protocol.  The subject must sign an ICF stating that the above -mentioned risk factors and the 
consequences were discussed with her.  
Collaborative Protocol COL.AOM.2013.005  
 Page 47 of 73 29 October 2015  
Amendment 2.0  [IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_883271] is asked to answer a “yes” or “no” 
question regarding each one of nine settings pertaining to inpatient, emergency room, and crisis stabilization trea tment.  If the subject answers “yes” to any of the questions, additional information 
regarding the “yes” answer is elicited.  The questions are:  
Did you spend any nights in the following treatment settings:  1) medical program, 2)  surgical 
program, 3) psyc hiatric program, 4) substance use program, 5) nursing home, 6) halfway house 
or staffed residence, 7) emergency room for medical reason, 8) emergency room for psychiatric or substance abuse reason, and 9) crisis stabilization for psychiatric or substance a buse reason. 
For “yes” answers, the total number of times and the total number of nights are recorded.  In addition, continuing for inpatient care, and the longest duration of the emergency room stay and overnight stay status is also recorded.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Clinical Glo bal Impression–Severity  
The severity of illness for each subject will be rated using the CGI -S scale.  To assess CGI -S, the 
rater or investigator will answer the following question:  “Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?”   Response 
choices include:  0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not ill at all; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3  = mildly 
ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill 
patients.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale  
The BPRS is a rating scale that a clinician or researcher may use to measure psychiatric symptoms 
such as depression, anxiety, hallucinations , and unusual behavior.  Each symptom is rated 1 (not 
present) to 7 (extremely severe).  A zero is entered if the item is not assessed.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Assessments  – Neuropsychiatric Function  
PREMORBID ADJUSTMENT  SCALE  
The Premorbid Adjustment Scale is a rating scale designed to evaluate the degree of achievement of developmental goals at each of several periods of a subject's life before the onset of 
schizophrenia.  The Premorbid Adjustment Scale has been found to be useful in identifying 
patients likely to become chronically hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655956].  
The scale is divided into a general scale and four developmental age periods:  
1. Childhood to age [ADDRESS_883272] on neurocognitive status.  The RBANS was developed for two primary 
applications:  
1. As a stand -alone “core” battery for the detection and neurocognitive characterization of 
dementia.  
2. As a brief neurocognitive battery for the detection and tracking of neurocognitive deficits in a variety of disorders.  
The RBANS consists of ten subtests that  give five scores, one for each of the five domains tested 
(i.e., immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional, language, attention, and delayed memory).   
The RBANS requires approximately 25  minutes to administer, and is a “pencil- and-paper” test, 
with onl y a stimulus booklet and record form needed for administration and scoring.  
S
ERVICE UTILIZATION AND RESOURCES FORM  
The SURF questionnaire is comprised of seven domains with 49 questions.  The domains are:  
• Work  
• General Health  
• Outpatient Mental Health Visits  
• Use of Outpatient Medical/Surgical Treatment Services  
• Substance Use  
• Justice System Contacts  
• Insurance Coverage  
All questions in the SURF refer to the 30 days prior to the date of the interview.  The subjects are 
asked questions with either “yes” or “no” a nswers, a rating scale to circle all that apply, or

and the information in question. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Assessments – Quality of Life  
HEINRICHS -CARPENTER QUALITY OF LIFE SCALE 
The QLS is a [ADDRESS_883273]’s self -report and the interviewer’s judgment based on all 
available information.  The QLS combines subjective reports a nd objective data, and raters are 
instructed to weight their assessment more heavily than the subject’s self -assessment.  The QLS 
assesses four domains:  1) interpersonal relations, 2) instrumental role functioning , 3)  intrapsychic 
foundations ( i.e., cogn itive-emotional functioning), and 4) common objects and activities ( i.e., 
extent of involvement with routine daily life activities).  Each item is rated on a [ADDRESS_883274] instrument for assessing change in quality of life in clinical trials and, based on our 
preliminary work, provides an optimal balance between subjective and objective perspectives . 
9.5.2 Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
The dependent measures wi ll include volumes of brain structure ( e.g., gray matter, white matter , 
and subcortical regions), white matter integrity assessed using diffusion tensor imaging , and 
indices of fMRI task -based and resting state activity.  
To accomplish scanner stability, each site will purchase and employ the Magphan® Quantitative 
Imaging Phantom, commonly known as the ADNI phantom (http://www.phantomlab.com/  
products/magphan_adni.php) . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Structural and Diffusion Tensor Imaging  
Each exam will  include acquisition of structural images, including a sagittal localizer and 
high-resolution T1- weighted sequence.  In addition, we will collect diffusion- weighted, spin- echo 
echo  planar imaging  (EPI)  scans , and a reference T2 -weighted image.  Functional imaging will 
utilize a gradient echo, EPI [INVESTIGATOR_655957]- oxygen -level -dependent  signal, 
acquired along the anterior/posterior commissure .  A field map will be collected to control for 
distortions in the EPI [INVESTIGATOR_359552].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Resting State fMRI Acqui sition  
Resting state fMRI will be collected in the absence of task demands and subjec ts will be instructed 
to keep their eyes open.   This permits  the assessment of functional connectivity while the subjects 
are at rest .

A subject may elect to discontinue the study at any time for any reason without p rejudice.  All 
subjects who discontinue the study are to complete the early discontinuation procedures indicated 
in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4) whenever possible. 
The investigator will promptly explain to the subject involved that the study will be discontinued for that subject and provide appropriate medical treatment and other necessary measures for the subject.  A subject who has ceased to return for visits will be followed up by [CONTACT_2319], phone, or other means to gather information , such as the reason for failure to return, the status of treatment 
compliance, the presence or absence of AEs, and clinical courses of signs and symptoms.  This information will be recorded in the CRF.  
Subjects who discontinue early from the study will be discontinued for one of these primary reasons:  AE(s), lost to follow -up, subject choice , inadequate therapeutic effect, withdrawal of 
consent, pregnancy, study term ination, or other (to be specified).  In addition to the primary reason, 
the subject may indicate one or more secondary reasons for discontinuation.

analytical plan will be provided in the SAP, which will be finalized before database lock.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Endpoint  
The primary  endpoint of the study is:  
• Time to the first hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints of the study are:  
Collaborative Protocol COL.AOM.2013.005  
 Page 57 of 73 29 October 2015  
Amendment 2.0  • Change from baseline to the 1-  year and 2- year time  points in gray matter and white matter 
volume, and cortical thickness .  The 2- year time point is the primary time point.  
• Time to all epi[INVESTIGATOR_655883], including total times (e.g., time from 
randomization to first, second, or any subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) as well as gap times 
(e.g., time between first and second hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], second and third hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], etc.)  
• Total number of days of inpatient psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655964]  
• Change from baseline in BPRS and CGI -S 
• Cost of care from the SURF  
• Change from baseline in neuropsychological function ( i.e., RBANS)  
• Change from baseline in quality of life (i.e., QLS)  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of Analysis Sets  
The Safety Analysis Set (SAS) is the group of subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug and had at least one postdose safety assessment.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is the group of randomized subjects who meet all of the inclusion 
criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  
The Randomized Set is the group of subjects who were  randomized. 
The Per Protocol Set is the group of subjects who sufficiently complied with the protocol.  Details 
of the evaluability criteria will be determined before database lock and will be specified in the SAP.  
Subjects at LAI sites who do not agree to an injection of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_537769] m onthly will be 
continued in the study.  These subjects will be given continued education about aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655965].  
For subgroup analyses of subjects at LAI sites, two gr oups are being specified prior to the start of 
data analysis.  The tolerated aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655966] a maximum of 6  weeks of 
initiating treatment with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655967] (i.e., tolerability can be declared at times earlier than 6  weeks).  The timely initiation of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655968] [ADDRESS_883284] tolerates aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253].

Amendment 2.0  [IP_ADDRESS] Subject Disposition  
The summary of subject disposition for all enrolled subjects will be provided for the study overall 
and by [CONTACT_3725].  The summary will include the number of subjects enrolled, completed, and discontinued, including the reason for discontinuation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics for the FAS will be summarized for each treatment 
group using descript ive statistics.  
Continuous variables , such as age, will be summarized by N (i.e., sample size), mean, standard 
deviation, minimum, median, and maximum.  Categorical variables, such as sex, will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_3228]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior and C oncomitant Therapy 
Medical history and medication history will be summarized.  The use of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_655969]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be performed on the SAS .  Safety data, presented by [CONTACT_2948], will 
be summarized on an “as treated” basis using descriptive statistics ( e.g., n, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables; n [%] for categorical 
variables).  Safety variables , such as TEAEs, clinical laborat ory parameters, and vital signs  will 
be summarized.   Study Day  [ADDRESS_883285] dose of 
study drug.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Extent of Exposure  
Treatment exposure will be characterized according to the number of subjects exposed, the 
duration of exposure, and the dose to which they were exposed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Adverse Events  
The AE verbatim descriptions ( i.e., investigator terms from the CRF) will be classified into 
standardized medical terminology using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Adverse events will be coded to the MedDRA (Version 15.1 or higher) lower level 
term closest to the verbatim term.  The linked MedDRA preferred term (PT ) and primary system 
organ class are also captured in the database.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE that : 
• Emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment ( i.e., baseline)  
• Reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment ( i.e., baseli ne) but 
stopped before treatment  
Collaborative Protocol COL.AOM.2013.005  
 Page 59 of 73 29 October 2015  
Amendment 2.0  • Worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is 
continuous  
Only those AEs that were treatment- emergent will be included in summary tables.  All AEs, 
treatment -emergent or otherwise, w ill be presented in subject data listings.  
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  The incidence of TEAEs will 
be reported as the number ( i.e., percentage) of subjects with TEAEs by [CONTACT_557049].  
A subject will be count ed only once within a system organ class and PT, even if the subject 
experienced more than one TEAE within a specific system organ class and PT.  The number ( i.e., 
percentage) of subjects with TEAEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_764] ( i.e., mild, 
moderate, or severe).  
The number ( i.e., percentage) of subjects with TEAEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_427939] ( i.e., possibly related, probably related, and not related).  
The number ( i.e., percentage) of subjects with treatment -related T EAEs will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_557049].  Treatment -related TEAEs include those events considered by [CONTACT_656023].  The number ( i.e., percentage) 
of subjects with treatment- related TEAE s will also be summarized by [CONTACT_764] ( i.e., 
mild, moderate, or severe). 
Adverse events will be summarized using the SAS .  The number of AEs and number and incidence 
(%) of subjects with AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_656024].  To obt ain the 
incidence (%), the number of subjects with at least one  event and the percentage of subjects with 
AEs by [CONTACT_656025].  Incidence (%) by [CONTACT_656026].   For clinically significant events, time of 
onset and recovery will be reported.  
The number ( i.e., percentage) of subjects with TEAEs leading to death will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_656027].  A subject data listing of all AEs 
leading to death will be provided. The number ( i.e., percentage) of subjects with SAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_656028].  A subject data listing of all SAEs will be provided.  
The number ( i.e., percentage) of subjects with TEAEs leading to discontinuation from study drug 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_656027].  A subject 
data listing of all AEs leading to discontinuation from study drug will be provided. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Labor atory Values  
Laboratory results will be summarized using Système International units, as appropriate.  For all 
quantitative parameters listed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] Safety Assessments (Laboratory Measurements), 
the actual value and the change from baseline to each postbaseline visit and to the end of treatment (i.e., defined as the last on -treatment value) will be summarized by [CONTACT_567164].  Qualitative parameters listed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] will be summarized using 
frequencies ( i.e., number and percentage of subjects), and changes from baseline to each 
Collaborative Protocol COL.AOM.2013.[ADDRESS_883286] results will be assigned a low/normal/high classification according to whether the value was below, within, or above the laboratory parameter’s reference range.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Blood Pressure  
Descriptive statistics for  blood pressure  parameters ( i.e., diastolic and systolic ) and changes from 
baseline will be presented by [CONTACT_3232]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_883287] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655970] (CR) 
modeling strategies proposed by [CONTACT_585686]
49.  The proportional hazards regression (PHREG) 
procedure in the Statistical Analysis System software  will be utilized for this analysis.  The newly 
available random effects option in the PHREG procedure will be explored to incorporate the within -cluster correlations.  We will also consider a recently proposed population average CR 
regression model for cl ustered data
50 using the crrSC package in R.  Percent CIF macro in the 
Statistical Analysis System software will be used to implement Gray’s method51 for testing 
differences of the cumulative incidence functions between the two treatment groups.  The SRATA parameter in the %CIF macro will also be used to perform the stratified version of Gray’s test
51.  
In the event that a subject dies from causes unrelated to schizophrenia before a hospit alization, the 
death will be considered a competing event instead of a censoring event.  Subjects discontinued 
without an event ( i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838] ) will be censored on the last known day without an event.   
We will also assess for the misspecification o f the regression model for the subdistribution hazard 
of a CR using the diagnostic plots recommended by [CONTACT_656029]52. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Secondary Efficacy Analys is 
Time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655971]:  
• Time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]:  Total times ( e.g., time from randomization to first, second, or 
any subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) as well as gap times ( e.g., time between first and second 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], second and third hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], etc.) will be considered.  The conditional 
models of Prentice, Williams , and Peterson will be used , with the risk set for the (k + 1)st 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655972] s who already had k hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], to compare the 
total time endpoints between the treatment groups.  For comparison of gap time endpoints, 
a marginal approach proposed by [CONTACT_174207], Lin , and Weissfeld  will be used . 
• Days of inpatient psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  The total number of days of inpatient 
psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655973] ( i.e., every 3  months) of  the 2- year 
study period will be counted .  This will generate longitudinal measurements with eight 
time points (i.e., corresponding to eight quarters) for each subject.  
Collaborative Protocol COL.AOM.2013.[ADDRESS_883288] drops out partially or completely for any quarter, the outcome for that particular 
quarter will be considered a missing value.  The l inear mixed effects model with time x group 
interaction will be used to compare the longitudinal trajectories of number of days of psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655974].  
Change from baseline or postbaseline assessments i n psychopathology ( e.g., BPRS and CGI -S), 
cost of care from the SURF, quality of life from the QLS, and change from baseline at the 1 -year 
and 2- year time points in neuropsychological functioning ( e.g., RBANS) will be analyzed using 
linear contrasts in a m ixed model with a nested design (e.g., subjects nested within clusters).  This 
design will take into account the within -cluster correlations as well as within -subject correlations .  
The treatment effects, treatment differences, and the associated 95% confi dence intervals will be 
presented.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Change from baseline to the 1- year and 2 -year time points in gray matter and white matter volume, 
and cortical thickness will be analyzed using  linear contrasts in a mixed model with a nested design 
(e.g., subjects nested within clusters).  This design will take into account the within -cluster 
correlations as well as within -subject correlations.  The 2 -year time point will be the primary time 
point for this variable.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_883289] psychiatric admission was 53.5%
46, 
which was similar to the 53.7% cited by [CONTACT_265172]47 in a previous study.  These  
rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_655975].  Subjects for the proposed study include subjects who are slightly more advanced in the course of their illness.  Therefore, we project a 60% rehos pi[INVESTIGATOR_655976].  In addition, a subset of [ADDRESS_883290] , and Ware (2004) for a 
longitudinal study.  We a ssum e that changes in neuroanatomic measures can be expressed in terms 
Collaborative Protocol COL.AOM.2013.005  
 Page 62 of 73 29 October 2015  
Amendment 2.0  of a linear trend over time , in years , and that these effects can be expressed as the difference 
between slopes in the treatment conditions (i.e., δ).  We based our analysis on data provided in 
Bartzokis et al20, which reported study standard devi ations for the rate of change in neuroanatomic 
measures ranging from 0.[ADDRESS_883291] δ  of 1.25  (effect size =  0.75) with 80% power (alpha  = 0.05), with a sample size 
of 28 in each treatment arm at the 2 -year follow -up.  Assuming a 30%  drop-out rate, the sample 
size needed at baseline would be 57 per group.  Included in the 30% drop- out rate are dropouts for 
the imaging analyses, subjects who drop out of the study completely (i.e., all study procedures), 
and those that drop out of the imaging com ponent only.  
Sample size calculations were done using the formula developed by [CONTACT_656029]48 proportional 
hazards modeling of CR.  The proportion of “failures of interest” ( i.e., first hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) was 
set at 60% for the TAU arm.  For the sample size calculation, we hypothesized the corresponding 
proportion in the LAI arm to be 30% so that the overall proportion of the patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_655977], in both treatment arms combined, is 45%.  The minimum detectable subdistribution 
hazard ratio at 80% power and a 5% significance level with 398 subjects equally allocated in the two treatment arms is  1
48.  Accounting for a 20% drop-out from the rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_655978], the 
corresponding sample will be 498, or 249 per treatment group.  With 400 completed subjects  (i.e., 
200 per group ), the cause- specific hazard ratio that could be estimated at 80% power and 5% 
significance level was  1.38.  The 1.[ADDRESS_883292] size , but it is large enough that it would influence both prescriber decisions about 
individual patients but also crucially health policy makers’ decisions about the advantages of treatment with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_123104].

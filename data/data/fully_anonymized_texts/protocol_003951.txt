The
future
of
neuromodulation
is
expected
to
become
more
patient
centric
and
will
focus
on
various
unserved
needs
patients
have
today.
One
of
these
needs
is
to
be
free
from
the
need
to

set
out
to
provide
a
solution
to
both
of
these
needs
by
[CONTACT_51315]
.
The
insert
functions
as

an
electrical
conduit
(coupler),
transferring
current
applied
to
the
skin
(e.g.
via
TENS)
via
a
very
low
impedance
down
to
the
nerve
of
interest
(figure
1).
In
essence,
this
conduit
provides
the
last
mile
connection
for
electrical
signals
from
the
skin
to
the
target
nerve.

Preclinical
animal
and
benchtop
work
has
been
successfully
conducted
to
prove
out
the
technology.
The
conduit
placement
is
designed
to
be
very
similar
to
a
lidocaine
injection
pain
physicians
provide
as
part
of
their
daily
practice
today,
utilizing
fluoroscopic
or
ultrasound
visualization
during
the
procedure.
Using
a
needle
of
2
to
5
mm
diameter
as
a
trocar,
a
wire
rope
is
inserted
to
be
in
close
proximity
to
the
nerve
at
one
end
of
the
conduit,
while
the
other
(“current
collector”)
end
is
left
as
a
loop
in
the
subcutaneous
tissue.
After
closing
the
puncture
wound
with
steri
strips
or
sutures,
the
patient
will
be
allowed
to
recover
for
a
few
days,
allowing
the
injected
conduit
to
stabilize.
After
a
few
days
of
recovery,
electrical
current
to
stimulate
the
nerve
is
applied
on
the
outside
of
the
skin
with
a
TENS
unit,
from
where
it
reaches
the
collector
end
just
below
the
skin.
Once
the
current
reaches
the
collector
end,
it
is
transferred
at
a
very
low
electrical
impedance
to
the
nerve
target,
providing
the
neuromodulation
treatment.
The
advantages
of
this
solution
are
(1)
that
the
signal
generator
is
outside
the
body,
eliminating
the
need
for
battery
replacement
surgeries
and
(2)
that
the
puncture
wound
to
place
the
conduit
leaves
a
significantly
smaller
scar
than
current
procedures
to
place
neuromodulation
electrodes,
leads
and
signal
generators.
This
conduit
represents
an
injectable
electrode
that
is
formed
into
its
final
shape
inside
the
body,
or
Injectrode
for
short.
While
Neuronoff,

has
tested
all
components
of
this
system
in

While
interfacing
with
a
nerve
at
a
depth
of
2
to
3
cm
would
be
a
possibility
for
an
early
feasibility
study,
it
was
determined
that
a
subcutaneous
placement
of
the
shortened
study
device
would
provide
the
same
biocompatibility
data
and
the
same
electrical

capabilities
efficacy
data,
while
subjecting
the
study
participants
to
a
very
minimal
and
controlled
amount
of
Non-Significant
Risk
(NSR).
Under
21
CFR
812.3(m),
an
NSR
device
study
is
one
that
does
*not*
meet
the
definition
for
an
SR
device
study.
Below
we
cover
all
criteria
that
define
an
SR
device
and
then
detail
why
the
Basmati
Injectrode
does
*not*
meet
these.
Specifically,
as
per
21
CFR
812.3(m),
an
SR
device:
1.
Is
intended
as
an
implant
and
presents
a
potential
serious
risk
to
the
health,
safety,
or
welfare
of
a
subject.
The
commercial
version
of
Neurnoff’s
Injectrode
will
be
an
implantable
electrode.
However,
this
early
feasibility
prototype
is
limited
to
28
days
of
use
to
avoid
risk
resulting
from
long-term
implantation
duration
where
regular
follow-up
is
impractical
or
impossible.
Therefore,
the
Basmati
insert
does
not
meet
the
definition
of
an
implant.
In
this
study,
the
Basmati
will
be
used
to
document
the
clinical
biological
response
after
a
placement
duration
of
28
days
only.
According
to
FDA
guidance
,
“Use
of
International
Standard
ISO
[ZIP_CODE],
“Biological
Evaluation
of
Medical
Devices
Part
1:
Evaluation
and
Testing”
(2013):
a
device
that
makes
contact
[CONTACT_51316]
a
period
of
time
less
than
[ADDRESS_54189].
The
material
of
the
Injectrode
is
99.99%
gold,
a
material
commonly
used
in
neuromodulation
electrodes
that
is
bioinert
and
very
well
received
by
[CONTACT_51317]
.
The
method
of
removing
the
Injectrode
at
the
end
of
the
safety
study
will
follow
a
procedure
similar
to
a
Mohs
procedure,
a
standard
clinical
practice
that
poses
little
risk
to
study
subjects.
Subjects
will
be
followed
for
signs
of
inflammation
of
the
surgical
site,
granulomas,
irritation.
This
early
feasibility
study
aims
to
document
the
clinical
biological
response
to
an
Injectrode,
roughly
the
size
of
a
Basmati
rice
grain,
placed
temporarily
into
up
to
10
healthy
volunteers
for
a
duration
of
up
to
28
days.
The
efficacy
of
the
device
is
assessed
by
[CONTACT_51318].
These
data
are
intended
to
provide
rationale
for
a
follow-up
study
testing
a
therapeutic
intervention.
Risk
to
the
study
participant
is
further
minimized
by
[CONTACT_51319]
a
quick
minimally
invasive
explant
procedure
before
the
28
day
mark
if
deemed
necessary
by
[CONTACT_51320].
This
non-significant
risk
(NSR)
study
is
the
first
of
two
early
feasibility
studies.
This
first
NSR
study
is
designed
to
subject
the
study
participants
to
a
minimal
risk
while
collecting
first
human
biocompatibility,
electrical
interface
and
neurostimulation
data.
The
expected
data
set
is
designed
to
enable
a
follow-up
study
investigating
the
placement
of
a
longer
Basmati-style
Injectrode
that
ranges
from
the
subcutaneous
tissue
to
a
nerve
located
at
an
approximate
depth
of

prior
to
explanting
the
device,
two
very

will
be
placed
approximately

Accordingly,
the

will
be
controlled
using

The
complete
histopathological
report
is
included
in
the
appendix
(REC-020).
The
histopathologist
drew
the
following
conclusions:
There
was
normal
fibrous
capsule
formation,
with
the
most
prominent
finding
being
the
expected
inflammatory
response
to
any
implanted
material.
The
fibrotic
response
was
variable
–
some
devices
had
a
higher
degree
of
inflammatory
and
foreign
body
giant
cells
than
others.
Responses
range
from
+1
to
+3
(mild
to
moderate)
responses,
the
histopathologist
stating
that
this
range
did
not
seem
concerning
and
that
he
assumed
it
to
simply
be
inter-subject
variability.
He
cited
the
variable
response
of
patients
to
COVID
as
a
case-in-point.
There
was
no
evidence
of
adverse
granuloma,
necrosis
(e.g.,
no
acute
toxicity),
tumor
formation
or
infection.

details

Visit
begins
with
an
examination
of
the
study
participant’s
arm
to
capture
and
interpret
the
result
of
the
gold
allergy
skin
test
by

is
verified,
the
participant
advances
to
the
group
of
up
to
[ADDRESS_54209]
as
necessary
with
the
Basmati
Injectrode
insert
procedure.
The
recommended
placement
location
for
the
device
on
the
left
or
the
right
hip
region
(figure

Placement
of
the
Basmati
Injectrode
is
the
hip
region
of
the
study
participant
at
approximately
the
height
of
the
naval.
Prior
to
the
placement
of
the
insert,
the
surgical
location
near
the
hip,
approximately
at
the
height
of
the
naval,
is
cleaned
and
sterilized
following
standard
OR
procedures
(betadine,
70%
isopropyl
alcohol).
Following
an
injection
of
subcutaneous
lidocaine
(1%),
a
small
(~5mm)
incision
is
made
using
a
scalpel
followed
by
[CONTACT_51331].
Blunt
dissection
technique
is
used
to
create
a
tunnel
of
about
3-5
mm
diameter,
at
a
depth
of
approximately
2mm
measured
from
the
surface
of
the
skin,
and
up
to
2
cm
long
(

EFFICACY
&
EXPLANT
VISIT
(IN-PERSON,
day
28)
This
visit
has
two
parts.
The
total
duration
of
this
visit
is
expected
to
be
approximately
[ADDRESS_54210]
part
of
the
visit
is
focused
on
capturing
stimulation
thresholds
of
cutaneous
afferent
nerves
to
provide
information
about
the
Injectode’s
capabilities
to
conduct
current
at
low
electrical
impedance
values.
This
first
part
is
anticipated
to
last
for
approximately
[ADDRESS_54211]
for
approximately
30
minutes
and
will
include
image
capturing
for
purposes
of
documentation.
Part
I:
Impedance
and
stimulation
threshold
data
acquisition
Materials:
Stimulation
will
be
provided
using
a
DS7A
Constant
Current
Stimulator
unit
(Digitimer),
a
device
with
CE
and
FDA
clearance.
Electrical
impedance
will
be
measured
with
a
handheld,
battery-powered
oscilloscope
(Fluke
ScopeMeter)
that
is
certified
and
calibrated.
Sterile
clinical
grade
standard
needles
intended
for
single
patient
use
(30
gauge)
will
be
used
to
directly
interface
percutaneously
with
the
Injectrode.
Details
for
this
interfacing
approach
are
provided
below.
A
clinical
grade,
disposable,
surface
patch
electrode
will
be
used
as
a
distal
return,
referred
to
as
a
TENS
electrode/patch
in
this
document.
The
Stimulator,
Oscilloscope,
Needles
and
TENS
electrodes
will
be
connected
together
using
standard
leads
(Pamona,
Comed).
Methods:
The
setup
for
these
stimulation
and
impedance
tests
are
done
under
two
types
of
visualization.
First,
visualization
is
done
via
ultrasound
according
to
a
Mohs’
surgery
plan.
Second,
the
setup
is
visualized
with
fluoroscopy
to
ensure
that
the
needles
are
placed
precisely
within
the
subcutaneously
implanted
Basmati
Injectrode.
All
equipment
will
be
turned
on
prior
to
use,
followed
by
[CONTACT_51332]
7a
through
7e
below.
Data
will
be
recorded
for
every
measurement.
Prior
to
beginning
the
measurements,
test
leads
will
also
be
hooked
up
to
the
stimulator
in
parallel.
Generally,
measurements
during
this
visit
will
be
recorded
at
a
current
amplitude
ranging
between
0.1
and
10
mA
and
pulse
widths
ranging
from
50
µsec
to
1500
µsec.
Reference
impedance
values
will
be
recorded
at
a
current
amplitude
at
1mA
and
a
pulse
width
of
200
µsec
using
a
reference
resistor
of
1
kOhm.
The
sensory
stimulation
thresholds
(“Measurement
1”
through
“Measurement
3.3”)
below
will
be
conducted
with
a
preferred
pulse
width

using
70%
Isopropyl
alcohol
at
the
site
of
the
Injectrode
with
a
margin
of
3cm
around
the
site,
identified
via
palpation
of
the
skin.
Two
[ADDRESS_54213]
leads
with
hooked
ends
will
be
attached
to
the
needle
shaft
extending
out
of
the
skin
and
taped
to
the
skin
to
keep
the
leads
secure
and
from
pulling
on
the
needles
should
the
study
participant
or
lead
move.
Measurement
1:
Once
the
leads
are
properly
attached
to
the
needles
and
TENS
patch,
testing
may
commence.
The
first
measurement
will
establish
the
stimulation
activation
(sensation)
threshold
of
afferent
nerves
in
the
skin
of
the
hip
region
of
the
study
participant
in
the
vicinity
of
where
the
Injectrode
is
present.
Needle
D
and
TENS
patch
C
will
first
be
connected
to
the
stimulator
(as
shown
in
figure
8a),
and
step
wise
increments
in
stimulus
amplitude
will
be
performed
until
the
study
participant
notes
that
they
can
perceive
the
stimulation
(e.g.
step
size
amplitude
=
100
µA,
pulse
width
=
200
µsec).
The
study
participant
will
be
asked
to
report
when
they
perceive
a
paresthesia,
essentially
a
tingling
sensation
of
the
skin.
The
current
and
pulse
width
values
for
the
initial
report
of
paresthesia
will
be
recorded
and
may
be
verified
with
a
second
measurement.
The
values
allowing
the
study
participant
to
perceive
a
tingling
paresthesia
sensation
are
expected
to
be
an
order
of
magnitude
smaller
than
currents
needed
to
cause
the
perception
of
pain.
If
the
study
participant
reports
pain
during
the
stimulation
then
the
clinician
will
adjust
their
testing
approach
accordingly
to
avoid
such
participant
feedback.
Once
the
stimulation
activation
threshold
is
determined,
lead
D
may
be
unplugged
and
needle
D
removed
from
the
skin.

and
their
answer
recorded.
If
needed,
the
stimulation
current
will
be
increased
in
increments
of
100

Explant
(Device
Removal)
Methods:
The
explant
surgical
plan
will
be
verified
with
images
from
ultrasound
and
fluoroscopy
taken
earlier
the
same
day.
The
explant
is
a
Mohs
style
surgery.
The
injection
site
is
anesthetized
via
lidocaine
(solution
1%),
and
a
sharp
cut
is
made
above
the
Basmati
Injectrode.
Next,
tissue
forceps
are
used
to
hold
onto
the
device
while
dissection
is
performed
around
the
Injectrode
in
naïve
tissue
at
a
target
distance
of
about
0.5
to
1
mm.
Once
removed,
the
explanted
Basmati
Insert
is
placed
in
a
glass
vial
containing
Formalin
(10%
formaldehyde
solution),
labeled
in
code
with
sequential
numbers
for
each
study
participant
in
compliance
with
HIPAA
requirements.
The
subsequent
wound
is
closed,
in
layers
if
applicable.
The
incision
is
closed
with
steri-strip,
surgical
skin
glue
or
sutures
as
per
the
surgeon’s
discretion.
The
closed
wound
is
then
bandaged
as
per
standard
protocol.
At
no
time
from
explant
to
histological
analysis
report
generation
will
Neuronoff,
Inc.
be
in
possession
of
the
device,
samples,
or
data.
The
device
will
be
left
in
Formalin
for
24
hours,
at
which
time
the
solution
will
be
exchanged
for
70%
ethanol
by
[CONTACT_51333].
The
fixed
samples
will
then
be
shipped
to
the
following

ADVERSE
EVENT
REPORTING
During
the
study,
the
investigator
will
determine
whether
any
adverse
events
(AE’s)
have
occurred.
For
the
purpose
of
this
protocol,
an
adverse
event
is
any
undesirable
clinical
occurrence
in
a
subject
that
can
be
attributed
to
the
device
or
incision
closure
procedure.
10.1
ADVERSE
EVENTS
In
this
study,
study
participants
should
be
encouraged
to
report
AE’s
spontaneously
or
in
response
to
general,
non-directed
questioning
(e.g.,
“How
has
your
health
been
since
the
last
visit?”)
per
Neuronoff
SOP-38.
Any
time
during
the
study,
the
study
participant
may
volunteer
information
about
any
event
that
resembles
an
AE.
If
it
is
determined
that
an
AE
has
occurred,
the
investigator
should
obtain
all
the
information
required
to
complete
the
AE
Form
of
the
CRF.
The
following
categories
of
adverse

severity
are
to
be
used:
Mild
Awareness
of
a

the
interests
of
science
and
society.
6.
The
primary
purpose
of
medical
research
involving
human
subjects
is
to
improve
prophylactic,
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
procedures
and
the
understanding
of
the
aetiology
and
pathogenesis
of
disease.
Even
the
best
proven
prophylactic,
diagnostic,
and
therapeutic
methods
must
continuously
be
challenged
through
research
for
their
effectiveness,
efficiency,
accessibility
and
quality.
7.
In
current
medical
practice
and
in
medical
research,
most
prophylactic,
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
procedures
involve
risks
and
burdens.

the
confidentiality
of
the
study
participant's
information
and
to
minimize
the
impact
of
the
study
on
the
subject's
physical
and
mental
integrity
and
on
the
personality
of
the
subject.
13.
In
any
research
on
human
beings,
each
potential
subject
must
be
adequately
informed
of
the
aims,
methods,
sources
of
funding,
any
possible
conflicts
of
interest,
institutional
affiliations
of
the
researcher,
the
anticipated
benefits
and
potential
risks
of
the
study
and
the
discomfort
it
may
entail.
The
subject
should
be
informed
of
the
right
to
abstain
from
participation
in
the
study
or
to
withdraw
consent
to
participate
at
any
time
without
reprisal.
After
ensuring
that
the
subject
has
understood
the
information,
the
physician
should
then
obtain
the
subject's
freely-given
informed
consent,
preferably
in
writing.
If
the
consent
cannot
be
obtained
in
writing,
the
non-written
consent
must
be
formally
documented
and
witnessed.
14.
When
obtaining
informed
consent
for
the
research
project
the
physician
should
be
particularly
cautious
if
the
subject
is
in
a
dependent
relationship
with
the
physician
or
may
consent
under
duress.
In
that
case
the
informed
consent
should
be
obtained
by
a
well-informed
physician
who
is
not
engaged
in
the
investigation
and
who
is
completely
independent
of
this
relationship.
15.
For
a
research
subject
who
is
legally
incompetent,
physically
or
mentally
incapable
of
giving
consent
or
is
a
legally
incompetent
minor,
the
investigator
must
obtain
informed
consent
from
the
legally
authorized
representative
in
accordance
with
applicable
law.
These
groups
should
not
be
included
in
research
unless
the
research
is
necessary
to
promote
the
health
of
the
population
represented
and
this
research
cannot
instead
be
performed
on
legally
competent
persons.
16.
When
a
subject
deemed
legally
incompetent,
such
as
a
minor
child,
is
able
to
give
assent
to
decisions
about
participation
in
research,
the
investigator
must
obtain
that
assent
in
addition
to
the
consent
of
the
legally
authorized
representative.

Research
on
individuals
from
whom
it
is
not
possible
to
obtain
consent,
including
proxy
or
advance
consent,
should
be
done
only
if
the
physical/mental
condition
that
prevents
obtaining
informed
consent
is
a
necessary
characteristic
of
the
research
population.
The
specific
reasons
for
involving
research
subjects
with
a
condition
that
renders
them
unable
to
give
informed
consent
should
be
stated
in
the
experimental
protocol
for
consideration
and
approval
of
the
review
committee.
The
protocol
should
state
that
consent
to
remain
in
the
research
should
be
obtained
as
soon
as
possible
from
the
individual
or
a
legally
authorized
surrogate.
18.
Both
authors
and
publishers
have
ethical
obligations.
In
publication
of
the
results
of
research,
the
investigators
are
obliged
to
preserve
the
accuracy
of
the
results.
Negative
as
well
as
positive
results
should
be
published
or
otherwise
publicly
available.
Sources
of
funding,
institutional
affiliations
and
any
possible
conflicts
of
interest
should
be
declared
in
the
publication.
Reports
of
experimentation
not
in
accordance
with
the
principles
laid
down
in
this
Declaration
should
not
be
accepted
for
publication.
3.
ADDITIONAL
PRINCIPLES
FOR
MEDICAL
RESEARCH
COMBINED
WITH
MEDICAL
CARE
1.
The
physician
may
combine
medical
research
with
medical
care,
only
to
the
extent
that
the
research
is
justified
by
[CONTACT_51342],
diagnostic
or
therapeutic
value.
When
medical
research
is
combined
with
medical
care,
additional
standards
apply
to
protect
the
study
participants
who
are
research
subjects.
2.
The
benefits,
risks,
burdens
and
effectiveness
of
a
new
method
should
be
tested
against
those
of
the
best
current
prophylactic,
diagnostic,
and
therapeutic
methods.
This
does
not
exclude
the
use
of
placebo,
or
no
treatment,
in
studies
where
no
proven
prophylactic,
diagnostic
or
therapeutic
method
exists.
3.
At
the
conclusion
of
the
study,
every
study
participant
entered
into
the
study
should
be
assured
of
access
to
the
best
proven
prophylactic,
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
methods
identified
by
[CONTACT_45662].
4.
The
physician
should
fully
inform
the
study
participant
which
aspects
of
the
care
are
related
to
the
research.
The
refusal
of
a
study
participant
to
participate
in
a
study
must
never
interfere
with
the
study
participant-physician
relationship.
5.
In
the
treatment
of
a
study
participant,
where
proven
prophylactic,
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
methods
do
not
exist
or
have
been
ineffective,
the
physician,
with
informed
consent
from
the
study
participant,
must
be
free
to
use
unproven
or
new
prophylactic,
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
measures,
if
in
the
physician's
judgment
it
offers
hope
of
saving
life,
re-establishing
health
or
alleviating
suffering.
Where
possible,
these
measures
should
be
made
the
object
of
research,
designed
to
evaluate
their
safety
and
efficacy.
In
all
cases,
new
information
should
be
recorded
and,
where
appropriate,
published.
The
other
relevant
guidelines
of
this
Declaration
should
be
followed.

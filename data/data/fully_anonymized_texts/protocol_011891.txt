Investigational Drug  Active substance: VX -150 
 Activity: Na v 1.8 blocker  
 Strength and route of administration: [ADDRESS_374454] will participa te in the 
study for approximately 11 weeks.  
  
Study Design  This is a Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, 
multicenter study. Up to a pproximately 114 subjects with small fiber neuropathy will 
be randomized 1:1 to VX -150 or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_306013]. Subjects with diabetes will not exceed approximately 60% of 
the total number of subjects. Subjects with diabetes and HbA1c ≥8% and <11% at 
screening will not exceed approximately  20% of the total number of subjects.  
This study will include:  
• A 7-day Run- in Period to establish the baseline NRS pain score  
• A 6-week Treatment Period  
• A 28 -day Safety Follow -up Period 
  
Assessments  Efficacy : NRS, DSIS, PGIC,  
Safety: AEs, C -SSRS, clinical laboratory assessments, clinical evaluation of vital 
signs, ECGs, and physical examinations (PEs). 
PK: Plasma PK parameters of VRT -1207355 and VRT -1268114 
 
  
Statisti cal Analyses  The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the weekly average of 
daily pain intensity on the 11 -point NRS, as reported in the daily diary, at Week  6. 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be a within -group treatme nt 
comparison  in the VX- 150 treatment group. The analysis will be conducted using a 
mixed -effects model fo r repeated measures (MMRM). The  between -group treatment 
comparison  will also be generated  using the same MMRM.  
The model will include the change fro m study baseline in the weekly average of daily 
NRS pain score as the dependent variable; treatment, sex, diagnosis of diabetes, 
week, and treatment -by-week interaction as fixed effects; subject as a random effect; 
and baseline pain intensity score as a covariate. In the model, week will be treated as 
a class variable, and an unstructured covariance matrix will be assumed to model the 
within- subject variability.  
The estimated mean and corresponding 95% CI for VX -[ADDRESS_374455] be used to facilitate the comparison with 0; this 
will be followed by a comparison with 0.8. In addition, the estimated mean and corresponding 95% CI for the between -group difference will be provided .

2, 3 In addition, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-
induced hyperalgesia also limits the long-term use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. While the incidence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-induced hyperalgesia is not known, it is encountered regularly in clinical practice and creates 
significant challenges in pain management.
4 The limited treatment options for pain, particularly 
chronic pain indications, combined with a growing awareness of the risks of the current standards of care underscore the need for new pain management therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Voltage-gated sodium channel s (Na
v) play a critical role in pain signaling based on both 
nonclinical and clinical evidence. Evaluation of the role these channels play in normal 
physiology and the pathological states arising from mutations in sodium channel genes and animal models, as well as the pharmacology of known sodium channel modulating agents, all point to the critical role of Na

To prepare for study participation, subjects will be instructed on the study restrictions 
(Section  9.4). During screening, subjects will discont inue their current pain treatments as 
outlined in Section  9.4.1.  Subjects will be permitted to take acetaminophen as needed (prn), 
following the guidelines in Section  9.4.1. 
Subjects will be instructed during screening on appropriate expectations around their participation in a clinical study and the importance of consistently and accurately reporting their pain throughout the study (e.g., “Participating in a Research Study” and “Reporting Your Pain”, 
Analgesic Solutions, Natick, MA). Review of these educational materials may be repeated for 

Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version  5.0 Page 22 of 54 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   some or all subjects depending on findings of an ongoing blinded data review (e.g., if pain score 
variability is increased on a su bject or site level).  
Subjects who do not meet the eligibility criteria may not be rescreened, with the following exceptions, all of which require medical monitor approval: 
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but had an intercurrent illness (e.g.,  upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_306001]) in the [ADDRESS_374481] study drug dose that was 
properly evaluated and which resolved fully 
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but were not able to obtain required documentation within the allotted scree ning window 
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but transiently (for personal reasons) are unable to 
commit to all study procedures 
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but are not randomized for administrative reasons (e.g., interactive web or voice response system [IXRS] is temporarily inaccessible or 
nonfunctional, or study drug is not available at the study site) 
Any subject granted approval by [CONTACT_306021] [ADDRESS_374482] dose of study drug, 
all screening assessments, except skin biopsy and NCS, need to be repeated. Repetition of any screening assessment that did not meet eligibility criteria is not permitted, unless there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g., hemolysis of sample). In all cases, the medical monitor must authorize retesting.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_374483] a Safety  Follow-up Visit 28 (±  7) days after the last study drug dose. Safety 
Follow- up Visit assessments are listed in  Table  3-2. 

Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version  5.[ADDRESS_374484] prematurely discontinues study drug treatment, an Early Termination of Treatment 
(ETT) Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the subject decides to terminate study drug treatment.  
Subjects who prematurely disco ntinue treatment will also be required to complete the Safety 
Follow-up Visit, approximately 28 days (± 7) days after their last dose of study drug. The assessments performed at the Safety Follow -up Visit are listed in  Table  3-2. If the ETT Visit 
occurs [ADDRESS_374485] withdraws consent for the study, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 
9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. The 
randomization code will be produced by [CONTACT_14448] a qualified randomization vendor. The Vertex study biostatistician will review and approve the production of the final randomization list, which will be reviewed and approved by a designated unblinded biostatistician who is not a member of the study execution team (SET). 
9.[ADDRESS_374486] is due either to the potential subjective nature of pain measurements and/or the effect of treatment with VX -150. For the primary endpoint, daily NRS pain scores will be averaged over a 
weekly period to reduce the impact on the analyses of individual high or low pain scores. 
9.3.2 Study Drug Dose and Duration 
The VX-150 dose selected for this study will be 1250 mg qd administered under fasting 
conditions using a capsule formulation.
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 

Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version  5.0 Page 24 of 54 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   9.3.3 Rationale for Study Assessments 
11-point NRS: Pain intensity is the FDA -recommended efficacy endpoint for studies of pain 
drugs .16, [ADDRESS_374487] pain assessment scale used in many pain registration 
studies. The 11 -point scale ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain).  
The minimum clinically important difference for an individual is considered to be a 1-point 
change from baseline, approximately equivalent to 15% to 20% improvement. Changes of 2 points are considered equivalent to approximately 30% to 36% improvement (i.e., meaningful improvement); and changes of ≥4 points are considered equivalent to ≥50% improvement (i.e., substantial improvement).
17, 18  
DSIS: Pain frequently interferes with sleep and sleep is important to quality of life. The FDA recommends evaluating the effect of analgesics on sleep.
16, 17 DSIS is commonly used in 
neuropathic pain studies and is assessed on an 11 -point NRS. The 11- point scale ranges from 0 
(none) to 10 (severe).  
PGIC:  The PGIC is commonly used in neuropathic pain studies, and the IMMPACT group 
recommends it as a core outcome measure for chronic pain studies .17 There is some evidence that 
PGIC may be more sensitive in neuropathic pain studies than pain intensity assessments because 
it may assess additional quality of life measures.18 The assessment consists of a single item on a 
7-point scale from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). 
C-SSR
S: The FDA recommends the evaluation of suicidality in clinical studies. The C- SSRS 
evaluates this through a series of questions about suicidal thoughts and behaviors. 

Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version  5.0 Page 25 of 54 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   NCS:  NCS are a standard assessment for the diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy. Normal NCS 
are part of the diagnostic criteria for small fiber neuropathy. NCS will be performed to rule out 
large nerve fiber involvement. 
Skin biopsy : Punch skin biopsy will be performed at screening to confirm the diagnosis of small 
fiber neuropathy based on the epi[INVESTIGATOR_192102]. Skin biopsy is considered the gold 
standard for diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy.

11.5 Efficacy  
11-point NRS: Pain intensity will be evaluated using the 11-point NRS. From Day -[ADDRESS_374503] 24  hours 
on the NRS. The NRS scores from the daily diary will be used in the primary endpoint analysis, and the proportion of subjects with ≥30% and ≥50% reduction in weekly average scores as reported in the daily diary and at study visits will be used in the secondary endpoint analyses.  
DSIS: The DSIS will be completed each morning in an electronic diary to describe how pain 
interfered with the subject’s sleep.  
PGIC:  The PGIC will be completed at study visits to quantify the change in subjects’ overall 
status.  
11.6 Safety  
Safety evaluations will include AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, clinical evaluation of vital 
signs, ECGs, physical examinations (PEs), and the C- SSRS.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Additional tests at screening: The following additional tests will be performed during screening 
to assess eligibility:  
• Serum beta- huma n chorionic gonadotropin (β -hCG) for all female subjects 
• Serum follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) for suspected postmenopausal female subjects 
only. Levels will be within the laboratory’s range for postmenopausal levels for subjects 
to be considered of non-childbearing potential. 
• Serology includes testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2 (HIV 1/HIV  2). 
• HbA1c (for subjects with diabetes only) 
• Thyroid function test  
• Methylmalonic acid 
• Vitamin B12  
Clinical laboratory assessments from screening will have no clinically significant findings that 
preclude participation in the study, as judged by [CONTACT_093], for a subject to receive study drug on Day 1. 
Pregnancy testing for female subjects of childbearing potential (as defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]
): 
Pregnancy test results must be negative for female subjects of childbearing potential to receive 
study drug. During treatment, if a urine or serum pregnancy test is positive, all study drug dosing will stop 
and the pregnancy will be confirmed with a serum β -hCG test. If confirmed, the pregnancy will 
be reported and the subject will be permanently withdrawn from study drug dosing as discussed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. If a pregnancy test is positive, the procedures outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] 
will be followed.  
Drug and alcohol testing: Opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], methadone, amphetamines/methamphetamines, cannabinoids, 
cocaine, barbiturates, and benzodia zepi[INVESTIGATOR_306003] a urine test. Alcohol will be 
assessed by a blood, urine, or breath test. Subjects may undergo random drug and alcohol testing if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093]. Drug and alcohol test results must be negative for all subjects to receive study drug. 
Additional Evaluations:  Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by [CONTACT_94295]. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94248]), the investigator may base the assessment of an AE o n the local laboratory value . 

Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version  5.[ADDRESS_374508] 
study visits ( Table  3-1 and Table  3-2). At other visits, symptom- directed PEs will occur at any 
time during the study if triggered by [CONTACT_139366] . 
A PE includes a review of the following systems: head/neck/thyroid; eyes/ears/nose/t hroat; 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as AEs.  
The neurological component of the Day 1 complete PE includes the bedside sensory testing kit (BSTK) for the purpose of standardized assessment and phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_306004]’ pain, using the usual components of the neurological examination. Included in the BSTK are standard  tools used 
in assessment of the neurological system, including a turning fork, foam brushes, von Frey fiber, and safety pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115].  
A focused neurological examination will be performed at all other visits after the Day 1  Visit. 
The focused neurological examination includes: testing of strength via the Medical Research 
Council (MRC) rating scale, reflexes, sensation to light touch, and pin prick. 
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature (ora l), pulse rate, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. These will be assessed following at least a [ADDRESS_374509] 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table  3-1 and Table  3-2) . Additional standard 12- lead ECGs will be 
performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines: 
• The subject will be instructed to rest in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5  minutes before 
having an ECG performed. 
• The ECG will be performed before any procedures that may affect heart rate, such as 
blood sampling. 
The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site at the Screening Visit and Safety 
Follow- up Visit. A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by [CONTACT_306025]. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through the Safety Follow- up Visit will be recorded as AEs.   
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60  msec from the baseline or an absolute 
QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be performed approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshol d value (>60 msec from baseline or 
≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from [ADDRESS_374510] with a QTcF value above the threshold valu e will discontinue dosing.

The C -SSRS will be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  3-2).  
11.6.6 Contraception and Pregnancy 
[IP_ADDRESS] Contraception  
Following the recommendations outlined by [CONTACT_306026], study participation requires a commitment from the subject that he/she and his/her partner use [ADDRESS_374511] dose of study drug. Additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to local regulations and/or requirements. 
The contraception requirement for the couple is waived for the following: 
• True abstinence for the subject, when this is consistent with the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject. True abstinence must be practiced from the Screening Visit 
through [ADDRESS_374512] dose of study drug. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
• If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility may be documented 
through examination of a semen specimen. 
• If the female is of non-childbearing potential. To be considered of non-childbearing 
potential, the female m ust meet at least 1 of the following criteria:  
o Postmenopausal: Amenorrheic for at least 2 years and a serum follicle- stimulating 
hormone level within the laboratory's reference range for postmenopausal females 
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or hyste rectomy  
• Same sex relationships  
Unique situations that may not fall within the above specifications may be discussed with the sponsor’s medical monitor or designee on an individual basis.

contraceptives; however, they are not considered an acceptable form of contraception due to the potential for 
drug-drug interactions between hormonal contraceptives and VX -150 resulting in reduced exposure and  
contraception failure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy 
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during study treatment and for [ADDRESS_374516] becomes pregnant while participating in the 
study, study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS within 24  hours of the site's knowledge of the subject’s (or 
partner's) pregnancy using the Pregnancy Safety Information Collection Form. 
If confirmed to be on active drug, the subject or partner will be followed for safety (adverse 
events) until the end of the pregnancy and similarly, the infant will be followed for 1 year after the birth, provided informed consent is obtained. A separate ICF will be provided to explain these follow-up activities. Pregnancy itself does not constitute an AE. 
12 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS  
This section presents a summary of the planned analyses for this protocol. Statistical analysis 
details will be provided in the statistical analysis Plan (SAP), and clinical pharmacologic analysis details will be provided in the clinical pharmacology analysis plan (CPAP), both of which will be finalized before the clinical data lock for the study and treatment unblinding. 

Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version  5.0 Page 37 of 54 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   12.1 Sample Size and Power  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the weekly average of daily pain 
intensity on the 11-point NRS, as reported in the daily diary, at Week 6. The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be a within -group treatment comparison in the VX-150 
treatment group. The 95% CI for the within -group change will be  used to evaluate if there is any 
significant change from baseline ( within -group change against 0). Additional analyses will 
include an evaluation of this within -group change against 0.8, an expected change from the 
placebo group, and a 95% CI for the between-group comparison of change from baseline. 
Assuming a within -group change of 0.8 for placebo and a bet ween -group treatment difference of 
1.25

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   12.3 Statistical Analysis  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of VX-150 in treating pain caused 
by [CONTACT_306018].  
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses of efficacy and safety. The 
Vertex Biometrics department will analyze the data derived from this study. Statistical Analysis 
System Version 9.2 or higher will be used to generate all statistical outputs (tables, figures, listings, and data sets).  
Statistical analysis and presentation details will be provided in the SAP. 
12.3.[ADDRESS_374520] data for all individual subjects randomized or exposed to study drug will 
be presented in data listings. Continuous data will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, SE, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max). Categorical data will be summarized using counts and percentages. 
Baseline value for the NRS daily diary scores and the DSIS will be defined as the average score 
from Day -[ADDRESS_374521] recent 
non-missing measurement collected before the initial administration of study drug. 
12.3.2 Background Characteristics  
[IP_ADDRESS] Subject Disposition 
The disposition summary will be based on the All Subjects Set. 
The number and percentage of subjects in each of the following disposition categories will be 
summarized based on the FAS: completed treatment, prematurely discontinued the treatment and the reason for discontinuation, completed study (i.e., completed Safety Follow- up Visit), and 
prematurely discontinued study with a breakdown of the reasons for discontinuation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_155427]: sex, age, race, ethnicity, weight, height, BMI, diagnosis of diabetes, and pain 
in the Run-in Period. 
No statistical tests will be carried out to evaluate any baseline imbalance between treatment 
groups. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Medications taken 28 days before the Screening Visit and up to the Safety Follow- up Visit will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_306027] -Drug Dictionary 
Enhanced (WHO- DDE) for the FAS as frequ ency tables in 2 parts:  
1. Prior medication: Medication that started before the first dose of study drug, regardless of 
when dosing of the medication ended. 
2. Concomitant medication: Medication received at or after the first dose of study drug, medication that was received before initial dosing and continued after initial dosing of study drug, or medication with missing stop date. 

Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version  5.[ADDRESS_374522] dose of study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Exposure and Compliance 
Exposure to study drug (i.e., duration of treatme nt) will be summarized for the FAS in terms of 
duration of treatment a subject received (in days), defined as the last day minus the first day of 
study drug plus 1. 
Dosing compliance will be summarized for the FAS, and is calculated as the actual number of  
dosing occasions at which study drug was administered, as a percentage of the planned number 
of dosing occasions. 
Duration of treatment and dosing compliance will be summarized by [CONTACT_306028].  
12.3.3 Efficacy Analysis  
Assessment of efficacy of VX -150 is the primary objective of this study. All efficacy endpoints 
will be analyzed based on the FAS.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Primary Variable 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the weekly average of daily pain intensity on the 11-point NRS, as reported in the daily diary, at Week 6. 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be a within-group treatment comparison in the 
VX-150 treatment group. The analysis will be conducted using a mixed- effects model for 
repeated measures (MMRM). The between -group treatment comparison  will also be  generated  
using the same MMRM. The model will include the change from study baseline in the weekly average of daily pain intensity score as the dependent variable; treatment, sex, diagnosis of diabetes, week, and treatment -by-week interaction as fixed effects; subject as a random effect; 
and baseline pain intensity score as a covariate. In the model, week will be treated as a class 
variable, and an unstructured covariance matrix will be assumed to  model the within -subject 
variability. The denominator degrees of freedom for the F- test for fixed effects will be estimated 
using the Kenward-Roger approximation. 
The e stimated mean and corresponding 95% CI for VX-[ADDRESS_374523] be used to facilitate the comparison with 0; this will be followed 
by a comparison with 0.8. In addition, the e stimated mean  and corresponding 95% CI for the 
between -group difference will be provided.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Variables 
Secondary endpoints are:  
• Proportion of subjects with ≥30% reduction in the weekly average of daily pain intensity 
on the 11-point NRS, as reported in the daily diary, at Week 6. This endpoint will be evaluated using descriptive statistics.  

Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version  5.0 Page 40 of 54 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Proportion of subjects with ≥50% reduction in the weekly average of daily pain intensity 
on the 11-point NRS, as reported in the daily diary, at Week 6. This endpoint will be 
evaluated using descriptive statistics.  
• Change from baseline in the DSIS at Week 6 . The analysis of this endpoint will be 
similar to the primary analysis.  
• Proportion of subjects categorized as improved at Week 6 on the PGIC assessment. This 
endpoint will be evaluated using descriptive statistics. 
• Change from baseline in pain intensity on the 11-point NRS, as reported at study visits, at Week  6. The analysis of this endpoint will be similar to the primary analysis. 
12.3.4 Safety Analysis  
The overall safety profile of VX-150 will be assessed in terms of the following safety and 
tolerability endpoints:  
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Clinical laboratory values (including coagulation studies)  
• ECG outcomes 
• Vital signs  
• C-SSRS  
Safety analyses will be based on the Safety Set.  
All safety data will be presented in in dividual subject data listings.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events 
AEs will be coded according to MedDRA. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing an AE will be summarized by [CONTACT_306029], as well as by [CONTACT_1570]. AEs will be classified as pretreatment or treatment -emergent as follows:  
Pretreatment AEs are defined as AEs that were reported or worsened after signing the ICF up to the start of study drug dosing. 

Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version  5.0 Page 41 of 54 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs that were reported or wo rsened on or after the 
start of study drug dosing through the Safety Follow- up Visit.  
Only TEAEs will be summarized in tables. All summaries of TEAEs will be presented by [CONTACT_209211]. Some rules that will apply to the summarization of AEs are (1) a subject with multiple occurrences of the same AE or a continuing AE will only be counted once; (2) only the maximum severity level will be presented in the severity summary; and (3) only the worst relationship level w ill be presented in the 
relationship summary.  
AEs leading to death, SAEs, AEs leading to dose discontinuation, and study discontinuation will be listed separately. All AEs through the Safety Follow- up Visit will be listed in an individual 
subject data list ing, including pretreatment AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
All statistical analyses of laboratory values will be performed using SI units. Hematology (including coagulation) and clinical chemistry results will be summarized by [CONTACT_139402]. The number and percentage of subjects with at least 1 potentially clinically significant (PCS) event will be summarized by [CONTACT_139402]. A listing containing individual subject laboratory measurements meeting the PCS criteria 
will be provided. For each subject in the listing, laboratory measurements at all time points will be included. The PCS criteria for clinical laboratory data will be provided in the SAP. Urinalysis results will be listed only in individual subject data listings. These results will not be summarized. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings will be reported as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram  
A summary of raw values and change from baseline values will be provided by [CONTACT_306030]: PR, QT, QRS, and QTcF intervals and heart rate. In addition, the number and percentage of subjects by [CONTACT_2078]- treatment 
value of QT/QTcF intervals, categorized as ≤450 msec, >450  msec and ≤480 msec, >480  msec 
and ≤500 msec, and >500  msec, as well as maximum on -treatment change from baseline value of 
QT/QTcF intervals, categorized as ≤0  msec, >0  and ≤30 msec, >30  and ≤60 msec, and >60 msec, 
will be provided. Clinically significant abnormal findings will be reported as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
The following vital signs will be summarized by [CONTACT_139402]: systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), body temperature (
°C), pulse rate (beats per 
minute), and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (breaths per minute). Clinically significant abnormal findings in vital signs will be reported as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination 
PE results will be presented in individual subject data listings only. Clinically relevant results identified after screening will be reported as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Safety Analysis 
Responses to the C -SSRS will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].

Details of the analyses will be provided in the CPAP. 
12.4.2 Pharmacodynamic Analysis  
12.4.3 Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
A population PK analysis of plasma concentration versus time data of VRT -1207355 and 
VRT -1268114 may be performed using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach. A 
population approach may also be used to investigate the exposure-response relationship for the 
efficacy and safety variables. A more detailed description of the methodology will be presented in the Population PK/PD Analysis Plan. The results of the population PK and PK/PD analysis (if done) will be reported in a separate document.  
13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADMI NISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity Grading, and Reporting 
13.1.1 Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition  of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g.,  increase in its severity or 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinically Significant Assessments 
Study assessments in cluding laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically -significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the 
abnormal test result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin). 
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following: 
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment  

Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version  5.0 Page 43 of 54 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_093].  
A laboratory value that is Grade [ADDRESS_374525]’s clinical status indicates a life- threatening AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time ICF is signed until the following time points:  
• For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure (e.g., screen failure, 
withdrawal of consent)  
• For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow- up Visit: th rough the Safety Follow-up 
Visit  
• For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow- up Visit, the earliest of  
o [ADDRESS_374526] dose of study drug 
(see Secti on 9.1.5)  
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as [ADDRESS_374527]'s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE:  
• Description of the event 
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  
• Severity  
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or othe r treatment given  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), V ersion  4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed August 
2015). AEs of CTCAE Grades  4 and 5 will be documented as “life-threatening.” The severity of 

Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version  5.0 Page 44 of 54 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in 
Table  13-1.  
Table  13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening (Grade  4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effo rt will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table  13-[ADDRESS_374528] been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of th e 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such 
as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely  related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories shown in  Table  13-3.  
Table  13-[ADDRESS_374529] to an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in r esponse to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicabl e Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt , or withdraw treatment is possible.  
 

Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version  5.0 Page 45 of 54 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Outcome 
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table  13-4.  
Table  13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/Resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/Resolved With 
Sequelae  Reso lution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not Recovered/Not 
Resolved (Continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing 
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least po ssibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow -up) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Given 
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 
13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes: 
• Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during p articipation in the study or occurs 
after participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to 
administration of the study drug) 
• Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as 
it occurred  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home)  
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139355], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_306005]16 -150-102, Version  5.0 Page 46 of 54 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94252]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94253] (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will not be considered to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on su bject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation of Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the 
Safety Follow -up Visit, regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_306031]. In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow -up Visit and are considered related 
to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24  hours . 
SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Clinical Trial Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form”) usi ng a recognized medical term or diagnosis that 
accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_94316](s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be as sessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes 
unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the SAE Form.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator is r esponsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, 
regardless of the presumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow -up information on previously 
reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow -up information as soon as it becomes 
available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities.  
Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via:

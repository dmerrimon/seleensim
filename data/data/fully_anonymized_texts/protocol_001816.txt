1.1 Na me of Study Disease/Stage: Breast cancer with brain metastases 
 
1.2 Na me of Investigational Agent: Eribulin Mesylate  
 
1.3 Clinical Data for Eribulin: 
Er
ibulin mesylate (Halaven®) is a microtubule inhibitor approved by [CONTACT_797868].  
Multiple phase [ADDRESS_1100397] established the efficacy of 
eribulin mesylate (Halaven®) in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) (1-4). The efficacy 
of 
eribulin mesylate has also been evaluated in other advanced solid tumors. These phase [ADDRESS_1100398] the therapy of physician’s 
choice (TPC) (4). Eribulin mesylate 1.4mg/m2 was administered intravenously over 2-5 minutes on 
days 1 and 8 of 21 days cycles; the median duration of treatment was 3.9 months. TPC included 
chemotherapy (96% received single agent vin ore lbine, gemcitabine, capecitabile, taxanes, or 
anthracyclines) or hormonal therapy. The median duration of treatment in the TPC arm was 2.[ADDRESS_1100399] 2 prior chemotherapy treatments including an 
anthracycline and taxane unless contraindicated either the adjuvant or metastatic setting. Overall, 
16% of the patients had human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2)-positive disease and 
19% were estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2- negative (triple-
negative). Although only 2 previous chemotherapy regimens were mandatory for enrollment, 9% 
of patients had received 4 or more chemotherapy regimens. For the 508 women treated with 
eribulin mesylate, the median overall survival ( OS) was 13.1 months; the median OS was 10.6 
months in 254 women in the TPC arm (p = 0.041). A significantly higher overall response rate 
(ORR) was also found with eribulin mesylate compared to TPC (12% vs. 5%) (p = 0.002). Further 
a
nalysis of the study results suggested that survival benefit with eribulin mesylate was independent 
of age without resulting in additional toxicity in older patients. Hence, it was recommended that 
age alone should not preclude older patients from receiving the drug regimen (5 ). Overall, this 
study demonstrated that eribulin mesylate  was an effective agent associated with survival benefit 
compared to other standard regimens in heavily pretreated patients with locally advanced breast 
cancer or MBC.   This trial formed the basis for the [ADDRESS_1100400] cancer after two or more 
chemotherapy regimens. 
 
1.3.1 Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Eribulin: 
Er
ibulin mesylate when dosed at 1.4 mg/m2 as an intravenous bolus has been shown to be well 
tolerated at 2 dosing schedules: on days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles and on days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-
day cycles in patients with MBC (1-4). Eribulin is a colorless, sterile solution for injection. Each 
vial contains 1 mg of eribulin as a 0.5-mg/mL solution in a 5:95 ratio of ethanol to water (6). 
Er
ibulin does not require pretreatment with corticosteroids or antihistamines (6) since its water 
solub
ility negates the requirement for a lipophilic vehicle such as polysorbate 80 (docetaxel) or 
CASE 7113 05. 25.18 
 8 Cremophor (paclitaxel), which have the potential to cause a hypersensitivity reaction. Eribulin is 
freely soluble in water and various organic solvents including ethanol, benzyl alcohol, and 
dimethyl- sulfoxide (7). Eribulin vials should be stored at 25 degree Centigrade and should not be 
fr
ozen (6).  The pharmacokinetic profile of eribulin is linear and dose proportional. When 
administered intravenously, eribulin has a rapid and extensive volume of distribution, slow 
elimination phase, and biexponential plasma disposition (8-13). The  mean plasma half-life of 
eribulin is approximately 37.8hours, which allows for prolonged drug exposure to exert the 
antimitotic action (11). Er ibulin is eliminated primarily via theliver, where it is metabolized to 4 
monooxygenated metabolites by [CONTACT_097]3A4. The CYP3A4-mediated biotransformation of eribulin is 
slow, which results in delayed hepatic clearance (14).  A minor amount of eribulin (~7%) is renally 
excreted as the parent compound (10).  Dose adjustments for patients with moderate renal 
impairment, with creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 mL/min, are recommended (17).  In a 
clinical setting, eribulin presents an insignificant risk for drug-drug interactions with CYP3A4 
inhibitors and inducers (17).  Hepatic impairment decreases clearance and prolongs the elimination 
half-life of eribulin (15).  B ecause of a significant risk of grade3/4 neutropenia, it is recommended 
to reduce the eribulin dose by [CONTACT_797869] (16). 
 
1.4  Study Rationale 
B
rain metastases occur in 20-40% of all cancer patients (18) and account for more than half of all 
int
ra-cranial tumors in adults with approximately 170,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the Unite d 
States alone (19). Breast cancer represents the primary tumor in 15-20% of patients with brain 
meta
stases (19). The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_797858] (20), stage of the disease and effe ctiveness of systemic therapy. Among women 
with advanced breast cancer, the long term cumulative risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_797859] 10- 15% (21). The [ADDRESS_1100401] cancer has been reported as 10% (22) but has been reported to be 46 % following 
the
 diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer (23). In HER-2 positive disease, the incidence may be up to 
36%
 following the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer (24, 25) and has been recently estimated as 
a
lmost 50% based on data in long term follow up patients with both early and advanced HER-2 
positive disease (26).  
 
B
rain metastases are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The most common 
presenting symptoms of brain metastases are headache, cognitive impairment and focal weakness, 
seizures and ataxia. Treatment of brain metastases are mainly palliative and typi[INVESTIGATOR_797860] (WBRT), stereotactic surgery (SRS) or surgical resec tion. In patients with 
brain metastases from breast cancer the median survival depending on the subtype is 4-7.5 months 
(
27) and median survival with SRS is 7-18 months (2 8, 29). 
 
Currently there is no approved drug therapy for brain metastases from metastatic breast cancer. 
Conventional cytotoxic drugs penetrate the brain poorly and intracranial response rates are low and of 
short duration. Paclitaxel which has become a standard of care for breast cancer has very little 
penetration across the blood-brain barrier (20) and has not demonstrated efficacy against breast 
meta
stases to brain. Targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_797861] [ADDRESS_1100402] cancer with a response rate of 3-6% (31). Furthermore, the use of cytotoxic drugs is limited by 
s
ystemic toxicity; restrictions imposed by [CONTACT_797870]. Patient outcomes with brain metastases are poor. Median survival following development of 
CASE [ADDRESS_1100403] cancer is approximately 4 months with combine modality 
of WBRT with chemotherapy (22). Outcomes are generally better for patients with HER 2 positive 
bra
in metastases (32) but when progression after cranial irradiation occurs, outcomes are similarly 
poor
 even after administration of a combination of capecitabine plus lapatinib. Given the poor 
prognosis of patients with brain metastases and the lack of effective drug treatment options, there is a 
need for development of new therapeutic agents and technology to evaluate early response to these 
therapeutic agents.   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_797862], eribulin mesylate’s therapeutic 
effectiveness on brain metastases from breast cancer has not been studied in a prospective clinical 
study. Matsuoka and colleagues described a case of a woman with brain metastases from breast cancer 
who had a significant response in brain that persisted for 4 months  whe n treated with eribulin  mesylate 
(33). 
Additi
onally t wo patients with brain metastases from breast cancer treated at University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_797863]. Based on these observations, we 
h
ypothesize that eribulin may have activity in patients with brain metastases from breast cancer.   
 
We propose to study a clinically meaningful endpoint, the 3-month CNS-progression free survival 
(PFS) , of eribulin mesylate  in breast cancer patients with brain metastases.

CASE 7113 05. 25.18 
 10 3.0  STUDY DESIGN 
 
3.1 Design: 
This is a phase II study that will require 20 patients to evaluate the primary objective (CNS PFS at 
3 months). Study patients will have a baseline brain MRI and a second MRI at 12 weeks to 
evaluate disease. 
 
3.2 Number of Subjects:  A total of 20  evaluable patients will be required for the study:  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1100406] Participation:  Death or disease progression or toxicity.  
 
3.4.  
 Duration of Therapy 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue on study until 
one of the following criteria applies: 
 
 S ystemic or CNS disease progression, 
 I ntercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, 
 The  investigator considers it, for safety reasons, to be in the best interest of the patient.  
 Una cceptable treatment related toxicity, NCI CTC AE version 4.0.  Grade 3 or 4 that fails to 
recover to baseline or < Grade 2 in the absence of treatment within 4 weeks 
 Ge neral or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatment in the judgment of the investigator,  
 Patient decision to withdraw from treatment (partial consent) or from the study (full consent), 
 P regnancy during the course of the study  
 De ath 
 
The date and reason for discontinuation must be documented.  Every effort should be made to 
complete the appropriate assessments.  
   
3.5 Duration of Follow Up:   
 
30-Day Follow- Up: Patients will be followed for toxicity  for [ADDRESS_1100407].  
 
Long term Follow- Up: Patients will be followed for survival  every 3 months until death after 
discontinuation of study medications. 
 
The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  
 
Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will necessitate follow-
up to determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and 
is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation will be recorded 
and reported immediately.

7.0   DOSING DELAYS / DOSE MODIFICATIONS :  
 
7.1.     Dosing  
The recommended starting dose of eribulin mesylate is  1.4 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 2 
to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. No calculation of Child-Pugh score is necessary for 
those w
ithout known hepatic impairment from hepatitis, cirrhosis or liver metastases. 
 
CASE 7113 05. 25.18

c
ycle.  
 
7.1.2     The recommended dose of eribulin mesylate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
(Chil
d-Pugh B) is 0.7 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-
da
y cycle.  
 
 7.1.3    The recommended dose of eribulin mesylate in patients with moderate renal impairment  
(c
reatinine clearance of 30-50 mL/min) is 1.1 mg/m2 a dministered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes 
on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. 
 
7.2  Dose Modification  
 
Asse
ss for peripheral neuropathy and obtain complete blood cell counts prior to each dose.  
 
It is not necessary to recalculate the BSA (Body Surface Area) for each treatment if the patient’s 
weight has not changed by [CONTACT_726] 10% from baseline.  P rior to each administration of study drug, 
the nurse recalculates the BSA, the daily dose and the total dose of all chemotherapy treatment 
drug(s). A 5% variance rule is utilized between the ordered dose and the recalculated dose. As long as 
the r
ecalculated dose is within 5%, it is acceptable to proceed. 
 
Recommended dose delays  
Do not administer eribulin mesylate on Day 1 or Day 8 for any of the following:  
ANC < 1,000/mm3  
Platelets < 75,000/mm3  
Grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicities.  
 
The Day 8 dose may be delayed for a maximum of 1 week.  
If toxicities do not resolve or improve to ≤ Grade 2 severity by [CONTACT_2006] 15, omit the dose.  
If toxicities resolve or improve to ≤ Grade 2 severity by [CONTACT_2006] 15, administer eribulin mesylate at a 
reduc
ed dose and initiate the next cycle no sooner than 2 weeks later.  
 
Recommended dose reductions:  If a dose has been delayed for toxicity and toxicities have recovered 
to Grade 2 severity or less, resume eribulin mesylate at a reduced dose as set out in Table 1. Do not re-
e
scalate Eribulin dose after it has been reduced.

8.1 Adverse Events and Potential Risks  
 
8.1.1    Adverse Effects related to eribulin mesylate 
 
8.1.2     Neutropenia  
 Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose, and increase the frequency of 
monitoring in patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias. Delay administration and 
reduce subsequent doses in patients who experience febrile neutropenia or Grade 4 
neutropenia lasting longer than 7 days.  
 S
evere neutropenia (ANC <500/mm3) lasting more than 1 week occurred in 12% 
(62/503) of patients. Patients with elevated liver enzymes >3 × ULN and bilirubin >1.5 × 
U
LN experienced a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia than 
patients with normal levels.  
 Gr
ade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 28% and 29%, respectively, of patients 
who received eribulin. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 5% of patients and two patients 
(0.4%) died from complications. Table 2: Recommended

 16 8.1.3    Peripheral Neuropathy 
 Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 8% of patients, and Grade 4 in 0.4% of 
patients who received eribu lin. De lay administration of eribulin until resolution to Grade 
2 or less.  
 Ne
uropathy lasting more than 1 year occurred in 5% of patients. Twenty-two percent of 
patients developed a new or worsening neuropathy that had not recovered within a 
median follow-up duration of 269 days (range 25-662 days)  
 Peripheral neuropathy (5%) was the most common adverse reaction resulting in 
discontinuation  
8.1.4     Pregnancy Category D 
 
 Er
ibulin is expected to cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and 
patients should be advised of these risks  
8.1.5     QT Prolongation 
 I
n an uncontrolled ECG study in 26 patients, QT prolongation was observed on Day 8, 
independent of eribulin concentration, with no prolongation on Day 1. ECG monitoring 
is recommended for patients with congestive heart failure; bradyarrhythmias; 
concomitant use of drugs that prolong QT interval, including Class Ia and III 
antiarrhythmics; and electrolyte abnormalities.  
 C
orrect hypokalemia or hypomagnesaemia prior to initiating eribulin mesylate and 
moni
tor electrolytes periodically during therapy. Avoid in patients with congenital long 
QT syndrome.

F
or patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic and/or moderate 
(CrCl 30-50 mL/min) renal impairment, a reduction in starting dose is recommended. 
  
8.2  MRI 
 
8.2.1       Adverse Events related to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
 
A 
known risk related to MRI examinations is that the MRI magnet could attract certain kinds of 
metal that may cause injury to the patient. In order to avoid that, patients will be screened for any 
hazardous metal object that they may have or is implanted inside their body which includes 
pacemakers, intracranial aneurysm clips, heart valve prostheses and other implanted devices that 
are not compatible with MRI. Although there is no risk from ionizing radiation with MRI, subjects 
will be exposed to strong magnetic fields and radio waves, neither of which are associated with 
any known detrimental health effects. 
For MR perfusion imaging we will use a contrast agent, gadolinium. This agent is approved by [CONTACT_797871]. There is a risk of an allergic or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) 
re
action. Allergic (anaphylactic) reactions to gadoliniu m contrast medium have occurred but are 
CASE [ADDRESS_1100416] 
risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_797864], 
including pa
tients with acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic, severe kidney disease (with a glomerular 
filtration rate or GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2). Higher than recommended doses or repeat doses of 
GBCAs also appear to increase the risk for NSF.  
Generally, an injection of 10-[ADDRESS_1100417] a patient’s 
hearing. In order to protect patient from this sound, they will be provided earplugs during the 
exam. There might also be some claustrophobia-related discomfort involved with being required to 
lie still in a small space. If this occurs, patients can signal the technologist attending the MRI who 
will terminate imaging. The subject will be removed from the MRI machine and regarded as being 
withdrawn from the study, with the exception of following the patient for any sign of adverse event 
to the injected study drug.  
 
8.3  Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events (AEs) 
All 
participating investigators will assess the occurrence of AEs throughout the subject’s participation 
in the study.  Subjects will be followed for toxicity for [ADDRESS_1100418]’s case report form, subject’s medical records, and/or any other institutional 
requirement. Source documentation must be available to support all adverse events.  
 
A laboratory test abnormality considered clinically relevant (e.g., causing the subject to withdraw from 
the study), requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by [CONTACT_1275], should be reported as an adverse event.   
 
The investigator will provide the following for all adverse events: 
 Description of the event 
 Date of onset and resolution

the definitions stated below.  (Note: Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the 
end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) 
 
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are 
evaluable, but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle 
of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for non-target 
disease. The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of 
the lesions.

recorded in millimeters. 
 
Note: Tumor lesions that are previously treated with stereotactic radiosurgery are not allowed as 
target lesion.  
 
Non-measurable disease All other lesions including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm are 
considered non-measurable disease.  
 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
CASE 7113 05. 25.18 
 26 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions if 
they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. 
 
Target lesions:  All measurable brain metastases > 10 mm should be identified as target lesions and 
recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size 
(lesions with the longest diameter but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance, the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducible should be selected. A sum of the diameters for all target lesions will 
be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Non-target lesions:  All other lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded a t baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or 
in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up. 
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_1100427] slice thickness greater 
than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is 
also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body scans). 
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI which greatly impact image 
qua
lity, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable 
globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, 
as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the 
lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the 
RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition 
protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed 
with breath-holding techniques, if possible.  
 
PET- CT At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET-CT is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the 
site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a 
diagnostic CT (with IV contrast), then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST 
measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring 
CASE [ADDRESS_1100428] introduces additional data 
which may bias an investigator if is not routine or serially performed. 
 
11.1.4 Response Criteria  
Measurement of Response  
Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI will be checked at baseline, 12 weeks after after starting treatment, 
and every 12 weeks thereafter until progression. The slice thickness of MRI should be less than 5 mm 
throughout the brain (2 to 3 mm thickness is highly recommended). MR imaging will be collected 
electronically for ad hoc central review of responses. 
 
Response in the brain also will be measured using dimensional measurements (WHO/modified 
McDonald’s criteria). Systemic responses will be assessed using the revised Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) (Eisenhauer 2009). 
 
Time to CNS Progression 
Patients will be followed clinically and radiographically. The date at which the tumor is documented 
to have first enlarged (brain or systemic progression) by 25% from best response (steroid dose stable 
or increased, neurologically stable or worse) will be considered the date of tumor progression. Time to 
progression will be the interval between the date of study entry and the date of tumor progression. In 
the event of a discrepancy and for the purposes of analysis, the treating physician's date of tumor 
progression will be deemed to be correct. Tissue confirmation of CNS tumor progression by 
[CONTACT_797874] a cause of 
radiographic worsening. Ancillary imaging techniques such as PET imaging, perfusion MRI, or MR 
spectroscopy of all "recurrent” or “progressive” lesions of CNS is recommended for patients at centers 
with access to these technologies.   
 
Responses in the CNS and systemic compartments will be assessed by [CONTACT_797875]. CNS disease will be imaged by [CONTACT_778200], and 
systemic disease will be imaged by [CONTACT_797876]. 
 
De

PR or CR should be confirmed at least 4 weeks after scan showing response. 
 
C
omplete Response (CR) : shall be defined as the circumstance when the tumor is no longer seen by 
[CONTACT_95425], with the patient off all steroids, or on adrenal maintenance only; CR will be coded only 
if confirmed by a second CT/MR scan performed a minimum of 4 weeks after the initial scan coding a 
response. 
 
Partial Response (PR) : Decrease of >50% in the product of two diameters with the patient off all 
steroids, or on adrenal maintenance only; PR will be coded only if confirmed by a second CT/MR scan 
pe
rformed a minimum of 4 weeks after the initial scan. 
Stable Disease (SD) : shall be defined as the circumstance when the scan shows no change. Patients 
should be receiving stable or decreasing doses of steroids. This will not need a confirmatory scan. 
 
CASE 7113 05. 25.18 
 28 Progression (P): shall be defined as a > 25% increase in tumor area (two diameters) provided that the 
patient has not had his/her dose of steroids decreased since the last evaluation period. This will not 
need a confirmatory scan. A concomitant decrease in steroid dose will rule out a progression 
designation during the first two months after completion of XRT. (Note: Under exceptional 
circumstances disease progression may be declared in the absence of an increase in tumor siz e)

11.[ADDRESS_1100430] – Non-CNS Metastases 
 
Althoug
h non CNS response is not the primary endpoint of this trial, subjects with measurable disease 
will
 be assessed by [CONTACT_48928]. For the purposes of this study, subjects should be re-evaluated 
e
very 4 cycles of treatment.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed 
b
y the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J 
Ca 45:228-247, 2009]. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 
c
riteria.  
 
11.2.1 Definitio ns 
Eva
luable for toxicity: All subjects will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment 
with er
ibulin.  
  
CASE 7113 05. 25.18 
 30 Evaluable for objective response: Only those subjects who have measurable disease present at 
ba
seline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re - evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for response. These subjects will have their response classified according to the 
de
finitions stated below. 
 
Note: Subjects who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be 
c
onsidered evaluable. 
 
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response: Subjects who have lesions present at baseline that are 
eva
luable, but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle o f 
ther
apy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for non-target disease. 
The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions. 
 
11.2.2 Disease Parameters 
Me
asurable Disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at 
lea
st one dimension (longest diameter for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions to be 
re
corded) as > [ADDRESS_1100431] x-ray, as > [ADDRESS_1100432] scan, or > [ADDRESS_1100433] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). 
 
Ma
lignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must 
be
 > [ADDRESS_1100434] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no 
grea
ter than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non
-measurable disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diame
ter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with > 10 to < 15 mm short axis) are considered non-
mea
surable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
l
ymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by 
C
T or MRI) are considered as non-measurable. 
 
Target lesions: All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
re
presentative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions a nd recorded and measured 
at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diame
ter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend 
themse
lves to reproducible repeated measurements. 
 
Non
-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and 
a
bove the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at 
ba
seline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases 
unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up. 
 
11.2.3 Response Criteria 
 
Response Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR): 
Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must 
ha
ve reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
CASE 7113 05. 25.18 
 31 Partial Response (PR): 
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum 
of dia
meters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD): 
At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest s um 
on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative 
incr
ease of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
Note : the a
ppearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. 
 
S
table Disease (SD)” 
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
 
E
valuation of Non-Target lesions 
Response Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes 
must
 be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis). 
Note
: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a subject to 
be considered in complete clinical response. 
 
Non
-CR/ Non-PD[Incomplete response/Stable Disease (SD)] 
Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
norma
l limits. 
 
P
rogressive Disease (PD) 
Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. 
Unequivocal progression shoul d not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of 
overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase. Although a clear progression of ‘non-target’ 
lesions onl
y is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_36408], 
a
nd the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal 
I
nvestigator). 
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_1100435] response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
r
ecorded since the treatment started). The subject’s best response assignment will depend on the 
a
chievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

13.0     STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
Overview 
This is a prospective, single arm Phase II study to determine the 3-month CNS – progression fee 
survival for patients with breast cancer with brain metastases treated with eribulin mesylate , 
which is the primary objective of the study. To detect treatment response of brain metastases we 
will enroll [ADDRESS_1100439] that a therapy 
would induce
 a 35% 3-month PFS rate.  A 15% rate would not be considered meaningful, and thus 
anything statistically significant > 15% would be considered a positive study. The 3-month CNS 
PFS of 35% as an indicator of efficacy was based on studies of chemotherapy in brain metastases, 
which demonstrated 3-month CNS PFS rates in the range of 22%–50% (34-36). If 8 or more 
pa
tients (out of 20) remain progression free at three months this will be taken as evidence that 
e
ribulin may have a positive impact on PFS, as the estimate of the proportion of patients with PFS 
would be 40%, and the 95% CI would be 18.5-61.5%, which does not include 15%.  Thus, we 
have determined that a total of [ADDRESS_1100440] 
ha
ve baseline and week 12 MRI. 
 
13.1 
Methods to address the study objectives 
Primary Objective :  CNS PFS at [ADDRESS_1100441] 35%. We will generate a Kaplan- Meier curve of CNS PFS and estimate 
the PF
S and 95% CI of the PFS. 
 
Secondary Objective 2.2.1 : Objective RR 
W
e will calculate the proportion (and 95% CI) of the patients with complete and partial response 
and duration of CNS response. 
 
S
econdary Objective 2.2.2 : Toxicity 
W
e will evaluate rates (and 95% CI) of toxicity in patients treated with eribulin. 
 
Secondary Objective 2.2.3:  CBR at 12 weeks 
W
e will sum the proportion of the patients with complete response, partial response and stable 
disea
se at 12 weeks (CBR).  We will then calculate the proportion (and 95% CI) of patients with 
CBR at 12 weeks. 
 
Secondary Objective 2.2.4:  Systemic Disease RR 
F
or this objective, we will estimate systemic disease response rate (and 95% CI) and perform a 
Kaplan -Meier analysis for systemic response in this patient population 
 
Secondary Objective 2.2.5: Ove rall Survival 
We will generate a Kaplan-Meier curve of OS. Point estimates (and standard error) of OS will be 
calculated.

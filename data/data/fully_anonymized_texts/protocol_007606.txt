1. Introduction  
This document is a protocol of a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to US and international standards for Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government r egulations and 
Institutional research policies and procedures.  
 1.[ADDRESS_469232] prevalent chronic diseases in the U.S. (1 ) and represents a source of 
significant burden to patients and healthcare systems. Acute exacerbation of asthma is characterized by [CONTACT_374830], bronchoconstriction, increased production of airway mucous, and decreased mucociliary clearance with fo rmation of mucous plugs (2, 3) . While 
corticosteroids are often the treatment of choice, their use is associated with a number of adverse effects, particularly when administered systemically. Currently there is an unmet need for non-steroidal treatment options for asthma, and Vitamin E has been proposed as one such treatment to combat inflammatory features of asthma.   
Among the isoforms of vitamin E that can be tested in asthma are α -tocopherol (αT), the 
predominant isoform found in over the counter Vitamin E supplements, and gamma tocopherol (γT), the predominant isoform found in foods. Intervention trials of αT in hum ans with asthma 
have been generally disappointing (4, 5). However, γT and its primary metabolite 2,7,8-
trimethyl-2- (B-carboxy-ethyl)-6- hydroxychroman (γ -CEHC) have been shown to have a number 
of anti- inflammatory activities not observed with αT and its met abolites (6-10). These actions 
include scavenging reactive nitrogen species to form 5 -nitro -y-tocopherol (5- NO2 -γT) (6) and 
inhibition of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX -2) and 5-lipooxygenase, reducing inflammatory 
eicosanoid production (7 -9).  
Particulate matter (PM) is a leading cause of respi[INVESTIGATOR_374809] -wide. Wood smoke particles (WSP) derived from wildland and other 
fires account for a significant fraction of ambient air PM. Health effects associated with WSP include acute bronchitis, asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, cough and systemic inflammation. While these effects are seen in both healthy and asthmatic individuals, many studies indicate that asthmatics have increased susceptibility  to the effects of WSP. Our center has developed a 500 
μg/m3 WSP exposure protocol (levels similar to those encountered by [CONTACT_374831] (Vitamin E) and airway inflammatory responses, IND 136873

 in close proximity to wildland burn sites) that induces airway and systemic inflammation in 
healthy volunteers. As with other pollutants, these inflammatory responses modulate non-specific bronchial reactivity (NSBR), inflammatory cell recruitment to the airways (primarily neutrophils), and potentially cardiovascular function. 
Our team has focused on gamma tocopherol as a nutritional intervention to prevent inflammatory 
responses to air pollutants such as WSP. Building on animal and in vitro preclinical studies, we have established that 1400 mg/day of oral γT -enriched supplement for 7 and 14 days in healthy 
volunteers and mild asthmatics, respectively, inhibited neutrophil influx into the airways, reduced production of sputum mucins, and improved mucociliary clearance following challenge with inhaled endotoxin, another common component of PM (10, 11). The findings occurred in the context of significantly increased plasma concentrations of γT and its active metabolite γ -
CEHC. Given our findings in these early phase clinical trials, γT supplementation is an attractive approach to prevent WSP -induced adverse health effects. We propose to use γT supplementation 
in a human model of WSP inhalation to mitigate key features of airway inflammation: inflammatory cell recruitment, production of inflammatory cytokines and mucous, and changes in airway physiology.  1.2. Investigational Agent  
 Gamma E Gems 548 mg softgels ,  (J.R. Carlson Laboratories, Inc., [ADDRESS_469233] 
Arlington Heights, IL [ZIP_CODE].)  1.3. Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  Gamma tocopherol will be administered in softgel form, with each softgel containing 874.1 mg of tocopherols, , including:  Alpha Tocopherol: 141.0 mg/sg (softgel) Beta Tocopherol:   18.1 mg/sg Gamma Tocopherol:  548.0 mg/sg  Delta Tocopherol:  167.0 mg/sg  Subjects will consume two softgels by [CONTACT_96488] [ADDRESS_469234] inflammation in healthy adults (11) and adults with 
asthma (26). These studies tested a [ADDRESS_469235] used supplements containing predominantly αT as opposed to γT. The Alpha Tocopherol Beta Carotene cancer prevention

 study, a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial of αT and b-carotene supplementation 
in middle aged male smokers, found that alpha tocopherol supplementation was associated with increased risk of fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage (13). To our knowledge, there are no published 
studies of γT supplementation that show an increased risk of bleeding. In our own previous studies, we have not observed any significant bleeding events nor any changes in PT, aPTT, or INR with γT supplementation at doses simil ar to the proposed study.  
An additional area of concern was raised by [CONTACT_374832] (CARDIA) study, a population-based observational study. In this study, higher plasma γT levels in young adults (not taking Vitamin E supplements)  were 
associated with lower lung function measurements ( FEV
1 and FVC) (14). However, others have 
shown that increased dietary  vitamin E intake had protective effects on lung function in adults 
(15). Plasma γT levels have not been significantly associated with risk of asthma or asthma 
outcomes. However, increased dietary vitamin E, which is predominantly gamma tocopherol (γT), has been associated with decreased occurrence of asthma in both children (16-18) and adults (19). 
Based on our own previous studies, the most common adverse effects of γT are diarrhea, 
flatulence, abdominal bloating, and nausea. In our most recent randomized, placebo controlled crossover study evaluating 14 days of γT -enriched supplementation (1400 mg daily) in 23 adult 
volunteers with asthma (26), diarrhea was reported in 6 participants (26%) on active treatment, compared to 1 participant (4.3%) on placebo. Nausea was reported in 6 participants (26%) on active treatment, compared to 2 participants (8.7 %) on placebo. Bloating and flatulence were 
reported in 2 participants (8.7%) and 1 participant (4.3%) on active treatment, respectively, with no reports of these symptoms in subjects receiving placebo. One participant withdrew from the study due to intole rable gastrointestinal symptoms. In all other participants, gastrointestinal 
symptoms were transient in nature, beginning after the first or second dose of study drug and self-resolving despi[INVESTIGATOR_374810] [ADDRESS_469236] inflammatory cell recruitment and cytokine production, and mucous production,. We anticipate 3 years will be 
required for completion of study visits for all participants.

 Upon successful completion of two screening protocols (one as a general screen to determine 
eligibility for airway challenge studies and a second to identify those individuals who are deemed “responders” to WSP inhalation, defined as ≥10% increase in sputum PMNs following exposure), participants will be enrolled to participate in a randomized, double blinded , placebo-
controlled, crossover study consisting of 8 visits . Participants will be randomized to γT or 
placebo treatment followed by [CONTACT_374833]. After a 4 -week washout period, 
participants will cross  over to the alternate treatment group.  
Following randomization to placebo or gamma tocopherol treatment, subjects will return for b
aseline (V0 ) and training visits (V1). Participants will consume 1 400 mg of γT -enriched 
supplement or placebo once daily for 7 days. Participants will undergo WSP exposure (V 2), then 
return the following day for a [ADDRESS_469237]- exposure visit (V 3). After a 4 week wash out period, 
subjects will present for a review of medical history and adverse events and cross over to the alternate treatment (V4). They will undergo a second WSP exposure (V 5) followed by a [ADDRESS_469238]- exposure visit (V 6). Five to 10 days after the exposure, participants will return for a study 
completion visit (V7 ).  
 3.2. Primary Study Endpoint The primary endpoint will be change in sputum %PMNs [Δ  (post WSP (4 hr) – preWSP)[ γT] vs

2. Pregnant/nursing women and children (< 18 years as this is age of majority in N orth 
Carolina ) will also be excluded since the risks associated with woodsmoke exposure to 
the fetus or child, respectively, are unknown and cannot be justified for this non-therapeutic protocol. Individuals over 45 years of age will not be included due to the 
increased possibility of co -morbidities and need for prohibited medications.  
3. Inability or unwillingness of a participant to give written informed consent.

Participants will be terminated early from the study for the following reasons:  
1. The participant elects to withdraw consent from all future study activities including follow up. 
2. The participant is “lost to follow up” (i.e., no further follow up is possible because attempts to reestablish contact [CONTACT_73880]).  
3. The participant dies.  
4. The participant develops a medical condition or is started on a new medication(s) not previously mentioned in the list of prohibited medications that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], may pose additional risks from participation in the study, may interfere with the participant’s ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality of the data obtained from the study. 
5. The participant meets any of the individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_374813]. 
6. The study is terminated for any reason. 
Participants with early termination from this study will not be replaced.  
5. Study Procedures  
 
5.1. Schedule of Events  
Each subject will have 8 study visits (excluding the general screening visit and wood smoke 
exposure screening visit to identify responders, which are under separate protocols): 
 5.1.1. S
creening Visits 
General Screening :  To identify non- asthmatic and asthmatic subjects suitable for WSP exposure, 
subjects will complete a general screening protocol (UNC IRB approved study #98-0799, Database and Screening Protocol for Research Studies of the Center for Environmental Medicine & Lung Biology ). 
 Screening WSP exposure :
  This protocol will identify subjects who experience a ≥ 10% increase

 5.2. Protocols for Measurements and Observations  
 5.2.1 Woodsmoke particle chamber exposure  
We will employ the exposure protocol described by (20) .
  We will heat white oak wood on an 
electric heating element (Brinkmann, Dallas, [LOCATION_007], [LOCATION_003])  in a Quadrafile 3100 woodstove 
(Colville, Washin gton, [LOCATION_003]) to generate wood smoke. The smoke wil l be extracted from the 
chimney and injected into the chamber air stream, and wood smoke particle concentration will be

 controlled using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Franklin, [LOCATION_005], [LOCATION_003]) to measure the chamber concentration. A DustTrak 8530 aerosol 
monitor (TSI, Shoreview, Minnesota, [LOCATION_003] ) will also be used as an alternative monitor for 
independent verification of proper TEOM  operation. The particle number concentration will be 
measured with a Model 3022A CPC (TSI, Shoreview, Minnesota, [LOCATION_003]) and the number and size 
distribution will be measured with a Model 3080L SMPS (TSI). The particle concentration will be verified by [CONTACT_374835] a versatile air pollution sampler (VAPS; URG, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]). The chamber temperature and humidity will be controlled to approximately 22°C and 40%, respectively. The target average concentration of WSP we will use for this  study will be  500 μg/m
3, with mild exercise to increase minute ventilation (20 
L/min/m2 BSA) for [ADDRESS_469264]-albuterol spi[INVESTIGATOR_302623] . The FEV
1 values that match a 10% and 20% fall from baseline will 
be calculated. An ultrasonic nebulizer will be filled with 15 mL of 3% hypertonic saline (inhalation grade for respi[INVESTIGATOR_374816]) to begin the test. The nebulizer will be set to the maximum output setting and turned on. The subject wi ll be instructed to breathe normally (i.e. 
tidal breaths) through the nebulizer mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_230161] [ADDRESS_469265] will also be 
encouraged to come off the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_374817] a sputum sample from the low er 
airways (i.e. not from the back of the throat) is ready for expectoration. The sample will be coughed into a sterile specimen jar and capped. Following repeat measurement of FEV
[ADDRESS_469266] 7 minute inhalation period, the concentration of saline will be increased from 3% to 4%, provided the FEV
1 falls by <10% from the baseline value. The same procedure will be followed 
for the final 7 minute inhalation period using 5% hypertonic saline. The nebulization will be stopped at that point, or earlier, if a sputum sample of good quality is obtained (i.e. visible sputum plugs). The 4% and 5% saline solutions will be mixed for each induction by [CONTACT_374836] a volume of 15-20 mL will be used on each occasion.  
5.2.3. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_374818] A merican Thoracic S ociety  guidelines. Subjects will 
inhale as deeply as possible, then exhale as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_374819]. Measurements obtained from each maneuver include the FVC, the FEV
1, the 
maximal mid -expi[INVESTIGATOR_216965] (FEF 25 -75%) and the peak flow (PF). The largest FVC and 
FEV 1, from at least [ADDRESS_469267] meet the 
appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria based on comparison of the subject’s measurements to the predicted value for an individual of his/her gender, age, race and height with NHANES III as the predicted set.  
5.2.4. Flow mediated dilation measured by [CONTACT_374837]: 
Gamma Tocopherol (Vitamin E) and airway inflammatory responses, IND 136873 
Sponsor:  David Peden, MD, MS 
 
18 
 Vascular endothelial function will be assessed by [CONTACT_374838]- mediated dilation of the 
brachial artery . Ultrasound images of the right brachial artery proximal to the antecubital fossa 
will be acquired using a Philips EPIQ 7 ultrasound machine equipped with a high-frequency (L9-
3) broadband linear-array transduc er. The baseline images will be obtained after [ADDRESS_469268]. Flow -mediated (endothelium- dependen t) dilation will be assessed by [CONTACT_374839]. Reactive hyperemia will be 
induced by [CONTACT_57094] a pneumatic occlusion cuff placed around the upper fore arm to a 
suprasystolic pressure (approximately 200 mmHg) for five minutes. Images of the artery will be 
recorded for two minutes after cuff deflation. Gated end- diastolic images will be stored in a 
digital format on a personal computer for subsequent offline quantification. Measurements will be performed using customized software (Brachial Tools, Medical Imaging Applications, LLC). 
Arterial diameter will be measured from the lumen -intimal interfaces of the proximal and distal 
arterial walls. Data from at least ten end -diastolic frames wi ll be averaged for the baseline 
measurement and from at least three frames at maximum dilation during  reactive hyperemia 
FMD will be calculated as the percent change in diameter from baseline.  
 5.2.5. Left ventricular strain  
LV strain  will be assessed by [CONTACT_374840] 2-dimensional speckle 
tracking echocardiography.  Speckle tracking imaging is a relatively new technique with which myocardial mechanics can be quantified by [CONTACT_374841].  Global longitudinal strain, the average fractional change in myocardial segment length, is a more sensitive index of LV contractility than ejection fraction or other standard measures.  Api[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 4 -
chamber, 2-chamber, and long axis 2- dime nsional ultrasound images of the heart will be 
acquired using a Philips EPIQ 7 ultrasound machine and stored for subsequent off-line analysis.  Global longitudinal strain will be quantified using Philips QLAB advanced quantification software.

 6. Statistical Plan  
 
6.1 Sample Size Determination  
The primary endpoint of this study is Δ sputum %PMNs  (post WSP – pre WSP [ γT]) at 4 hour 
vs (post WSP – pre WSP [ placebo])  at 4 hours,  and ( post WSP – pre WSP [ γT]) at 24 hours vs 
(post WSP – pre WSP [ placebo]) at 24 hours. Preliminary analyses from our screening study of 
the effects of 500 µg/m3 WSP exposure on sputum neutrophilia in healthy volunteers and mild 
asthmatics demonstrated that , among “responders ” (those participants with a ≥ 10% increase in 
sputum neutrophils following WSP exposure), the mean increase in sputum %PMNs was 
28.5±1 3%. In our studies of γT vs placebo for mitigating LPS -induced change in sputum 
%PMNs in healthy volunteers (11) and mild asthmatics (26), we found a γT treatment effect size of 14.5% ±25.9. Assuming β =0.8 and α=0.05, a sample size of [ADDRESS_469272] size. To account for a 25% 
attrition rate with human studies, we will inflate the sample size to [ADDRESS_469273] variability by [CONTACT_374842] ≥ 10% increase in WSP -induced %PMNs in sputum during the screeing 
protoco l (the so -called “responders”).  
 6.2. S
tatistical Methods 
Our analytic plan was developed in collaboration with [CONTACT_374857], the biostatistician for the CEMALB, who will oversee all statistical analysis.  For analysis of sputum and circulating PMN 
responses as well as cytokine changes within each treatment group, we will use (i) descriptive analy sis, (ii) two -sample comparison test, and (iii) random effects regression analysis (Equation 
1) designed to take advantage of the crossover design (22). Specifically, we will use the tabular and graphic methods to describe/explore the basic relationship between the groups. We will then 
follow up by [CONTACT_17921] Δ sputum %PMNs (post WSP – pre WSP [ γT]) vs (post WSP – 
pre WSP [ placebo]) using two -sample tests,  either parametric (T -Test) or nonparametric 
(Wilxocon signed- rank test ), depending on whether the normality assumption is met. We 
will transform the data to achieve normality if needed. Finally , we will employ a random 
effect  regression modeling technique  (Equation 1 ) that allow s us to assess treatment effect while 
accounting for potential period effect and carry- over effect s. This approach is similar to those we 
have previously described to assess genotype effects (including the  GSTM1 null genotype) on 
response to pollutants  (11, 23-25) and is shown below . In all analyses, criterion  for significance 
will be p≤0.05. To address potential missing data, we will employ multiple imputation methods  
to address this issue when appropriate; using techniques we have previously described (24).   
Linear mixed model approach for global unified analysis of data for secondary and exploratory outcomes: 
    
 
  
 Y_11k=μ+π_1+τ_1+βX_k+s_1k+ ϵ_11k; Y_12k=μ+π_2+τ_2+λ_1+βX_k+s_1k+ ϵ_12k 
 
Y_21k=μ+π_1+τ_2+βX_k+s_2k+ ϵ_21k; Y_22k=μ+π_2+τ_1+λ_2+βX_k+s_2k+ ϵ_22k     
 
μ is the grand mean, π1 and π2 are period effects, τ1 and τ2 are treatment effects, λ 1 and λ2 
are carryover effects for different sequences, ς1k and ς 2k are individual random effects 
within each sequence, and ε's are random errors. Subscript k is for subjects.

6.3. Data Management Study coordinators will be responsible for efforts and computations for database management. 
Data will be initially collected by [CONTACT_374843]. Clinical data such as health history will be collected by [CONTACT_374844], such as vital signs, spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], etc. All paper forms (source documentation) are maintained by a study coordinator or PI [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a binder, [ADDRESS_469274] virtually any type of data (including 21 CFR Part 11, FISMA, and HIPAA-compliant environments). It is specifically geared to support online or offline data capture for research studies and operations. Missing data will be noted and a comment made in the database to explain the missing data. Time stamps will be used wh en 
appropriate. At minimum, the visit number will be indicated.   Biological samples collected by [CONTACT_374845]. On receipt in the lab, samples are initially entered into a software program called LDMS (Lab Data Management System) which  tracks samples. 
Processing of these samples is done per the SOP maintained in the CEMALB quality assurance plan, as some samples are processed immediately and others are processed in batches at later time points. This data is entered into REDCap at appropriate intervals, based on sample analysis.  
 We will use the data dictionary or REDCap codebook as our course for data codes. All data will be collected by [CONTACT_374846]. Once the data is entered and confirmed by a 2
nd person, it will be considered “locked” and will not be 
changed without documentation with the reason for the change. REDCap limits and monitors who can change data, a feature developed to ensure data integrity.  6.4. Randomization plan The randomization schedule will be generated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Haibo Zhou (biostatistician) and provided to the investigational pharmacy. Only [CONTACT_374857] and the pharmacist will have access to the randomization schedule. Subjects will be allocated to begin the first period of the crossover study with placebo or γT  treatment using permuted block randomization with a block size of 4 ([ADDRESS_469275] treatment period of the protocol).  
 
7. Monitoring and Risk Minimization  
 
7.1. Definition of Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded and reported according to [ADDRESS_469276] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug whether or not considered drug related and will also include failure of any of the safety criteria outlined in section “3.4.”.  Additionally, minor upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_374821] 96 hours of the exposure will be considered adverse events.  Other non- specified clinical illnesses or symptoms , which occur during the treatment 
period or within 96 hours of each challenge, will also be reported as an AE.  Any decrease in lung function or increase in symptom score, as outlined in section “3.4,” will be considered an 
Gamma Tocopherol (Vitamin E) and airway inflammatory responses, IND 136873 
Sponsor:  David Peden, MD, MS 
 
23 
 adverse event. Any symptoms that induce a volunteer to seek medical attention from any 
provider during study drug treatment or within 7 days of completing study drug treatment or  
within 96 hours of challenge will be considered an adverse event.  A serious adverse event will also be defined as any event that requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_302631], permanent (or likely to be permanent) illness or injury, or death if these events occur 
during study drug treatment or within 7 days of completing study drug treatment or within 96 hours of challenge (or if the clinical scenario leading up to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], illness, injury or death begins during study drug treatment, within 7 days of completing study drug treatment or within  
96 hours of a challenge).   
7.1.1. Grading criteria  
In addition to determining whether an adverse event fulfills criteria for a serious adverse event or 
not, the severity of adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_374847] 7.1.2 below.   This 
document provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events.   
All adverse events whether or not listed in the Toxicity Grading Scale will be graded on a scale from 1 to 4  according to the following standards (A semi- colon indicates ‘or’ within the 
description of the grade.): Grade 1 = Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2 = Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL (preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc). 
Grade 3 = Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self care ADL (bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using he toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden).  
Grade 4 = Life-threatening consequences; or urgent intervention indicated.  
7.1.2. Protocol specific potential AE’s  
Adverse events which have relative specificity for this protocol will be recorded and graded 1 to 4 according to the grade definition provided below:

7.2. Risks to Subjects 
 7.2.1. Potential risks of gamma tocopherol  
There is a rare chance that higher doses of αT may effect coagulation (PT and a PTT) and 
predispose to bleeding. It is possible that γT carries the same risk , though this has not been 
demonstrated in prior studies of γT. An observational study of un- supplemented individuals 
suggested that higher plasma γT levels were associated with reduced lung function, specifically FVC and FEV
1 (14) . Finally, our prior studies with γT have demonstrated risk for mild 
gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, bloating, and flatulence  that tended to 
occur early on during treatment and to self- resolve within a few days despi[INVESTIGATOR_177640]. In our most recent randomized, placebo controlled crossover study evaluating 14 days of γT supplementati on in adults with asthma, diarrhea was reported in 26% of subjects on active 
treatment, compared to 4.3% of subjects on placebo.  
 
7.2.2. Potential risks of WSP  
Concentrations of wood smoke exhaust proposed for this study (500 μg/m3) are below those reported for individuals using biomass burning for heating and food preparation and those living 
in the area of a forest fire or agricultural burning. No major adverse health effects were observe d 
in a recently completed study which exposed healthy volunteers to concentrated C hapel Hill air 
particles at the EPA Human Studies facility (Physiological and Biochemical Changes Associated 
with Exposure to Air Pollution Partic les; Andrew Ghio, MD, PI; IRB# 95- EPA -310)1. The mean 
particulate matter (PM) was 485 + 84 μg/m

neutrophilia after WSP exposure for inclusion into this study. In addition to the mild, transient symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_374848], these seven asthmatic participants have experienced transient chest tightness following WSP exposure. This symptom has not been accompanied by [CONTACT_374849][INVESTIGATOR_038], and chest tightness has resolved spontaneously within a few minutes following exposure and without any intervention. We will assess for any symptoms following WSP exposure with the WSP exposure questionnaire immediately after exit from the chamber and again 4 hours later.

albuterol will be given for rescue. Finally, our Center has previously performed inhaled challenges with ozone and LPS in the allergic asthmatic population. With ozone and LPS we have not e xperienced any serious adverse events, and we expect the response to the wood smoke 
challenge to be similar.   7.2.3. Potential Risks of the Induced Sputum Procedure  
The saline solutions (3%, 4% and 5%) nebulized during sputum may cause throat irritation, but it is uncommon for the duration of discomfort to last more than a few minute s post procedure. The 
procedure also has a minimal risk of inducing bronchospasm, which is a potential concern for individuals with asthma. Thus, all volunteers with a history of asthma will be pre -treated with [ADDRESS_469278]. Cutting off blood flow to the arm may result in mild discomfort or temporary sensations of tingling or numbness in the hand u ntil the 
blood pressure cuff is released. About 1 in 200 patients develop a painless rash on the arm w here 
the blood pressure cuff is placed; this disappears over several days.

7.2.6. Potential Risks of Measuring Left Ventricular Strain  
There are no significant risks associated with ultrasound imaging to measure left ventricular strain.  
7.2.7. Potential Risks associated with other study procedures  
Bruising during the venipuncture and vasovagal response to phlebotomy are the anticipated risks of venipuncture. There are no anticipated risks for completion of questionnaires or collection of a urine sample from female subjects.  Light bicycle exercise (used to increase minute ventilation) 
presents a potential, but minimal risk. Side effects of exercise include occasional muscle soreness, cramps or general fatigue. These effects are temporary and not typi[INVESTIGATOR_374825]. It is also possible that exercise might uncover a previously unidentif ied pre -existing 
cardiac condition that could present a health risk to a volunteer.   Additionally there is a risk of Breach of Confidentiality and Privacy.  7.3. Measures to Minimize Risk  
 7.3.1. Protections to Minimize Risk of Gamma Tocopherol  
Tocopherols may affect coagulation. We will query volunteers for bruising and bleeding prior to enrollment and during the dosing period, and will monitor PT and a PTT values prior to t he first 
dose of study drug and at the end of the dosing period. They may be checked at any time the subjects experiences abnormal bruising. Any participant with an abnormal baseline PT, a PTT or 
INR will be excluded from receipt of study treatment. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_374826] γT dosing period to monitor for any changes in lung function. As to the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms, we will recommend that γT supplements be taken with a high- fat meal to promote intestinal absorption of γT and mitigate many associated diarrhea  or 
bloating. Participants will receive a GI symptom diary to be completed daily while taking the study drug and returned to study coordinators on the morning of the challenge visit s (Visit 2 or 
5). All female subjects, except those who have had a hysterectomy with oophorectomy, will 
undergo urine pregnancy testing prior to beginning treatment and prior to WSP exposure . A 
positive pregnancy test will exclude the subject, and they will be withdrawn if they become pregnant during the course of the study. Study medication, including placebo, will be dispensed by [CONTACT_374850][INVESTIGATOR_600].  
 7.3.2. Protections to Minimize Risk of Wood smoke exposure Prior to enrollment, subjects will have completed either the CEMALB screening protocol at which time a  detailed medical history will be  obtained. Only otherwise healthy volunteers who 
meet study  inclusion/exclusion criteria will be considered for this study, and the maximum age 
of participants will be [ADDRESS_469279] ECG telemetry leads attached to monitor cardiac rate

[ADDRESS_469280] . An emergency “crash cart” with standard emergency 
medications, IV fluids and a defibrillator are is also readily available at the CEMALB in the unlikely event of a medical emergency during any challenge or study visit.   For safety reasons, pulse oximetry will be performed during the exposures to wood smoke and filtered air, and the subject will be withdrawn from th e chamber if the value is <90%. The risk of 
discomfort associated with exercise will be limited because ability and response to exercise will be assessed at the training visit, and subjects with orthopedic issues that limit ability to pedal a 
bicycle will be excluded. All female subjects, except those who have had a hysterectomy with oophorectomy, will undergo ur ine pregnancy testing on the morning (prior to) of each exposure. 
A positive pregnancy test will exclude the subject. Various engineering system controls will be used during woodsmoke exposures. A Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM®) will be used control and monitor wood smoke part icle concentration in the chamber. If the 
concentration measured by [CONTACT_374851]® exceeds a pr edetermined level, the exposure will be 
terminated and the subject removed from the chamber. A DataRAMTM particulate measurement  
device will also be used during exposure as an alternative monitor for independent verification of proper TEOM® operation. Additionally, gas analyzers continually monitor the chamber environment during exposures and will alarm if the carbon monoxide level exceeds [ADDRESS_469281] with a drink (wate r, juice etc) and a 
snack after induction. All subjects with a history of asthma will be pretreated with [ADDRESS_469282]’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_374827], sputum sampling will be deferred. Baseline FEV
1 and force vital capacity (FVC) will be measured before the start of 
the induction and at the end of each level (concentration) of saline inhalation. The FEV 1 values 
that match a 10% and 20% reduction from baseline will be calculated and recorded. Subjects who have a 10- 20% decrease in FEV
1 after the 3% or 4% level of saline will not be advanced to 
a higher concentration of saline and will continue at the same level. If the FEV 1 drops by > 20%, 
the induction will be stopped and the subje ct will be treated with [ADDRESS_469283] experiences any

Subjects will be screened for orthopedic injuries or conditions which would increase the likelihood of injury. Additionally, subjects will be trained on the proper use of the bicycle, and w ill be monitored

 7.3.8. Protections for Minimizing Risks Associated with Breach of Confidentiality and Privacy All phone conversations/i nterviews as well as collection of personal medical history will be 
carried out in private offices or p rivate examination rooms in the CEMALB research facility. All 
physical examinations will be carried out in a private examination room. Access to subject’s identity will be limited to the investigators and staff directly involved in the protocol.  
CRF’s/worksheets generated as part of these studies will be kept in a locked room, and the database will not contain personal identifiers and will also be password protected and acc essible 
only to the appropriate study coordinators and investigators. Subjects’ names will not be used in any publication. Risks to Confidentiality will be also be minimized by [CONTACT_374852] -
house a nalysis with coded identifiers. The ID label for any samples sent outside of the UNC 
Health Care S ystem will be also be cod ed and without any personal identifiers (i.e., no DOB, 
gender etc will be indicated on the tube or lab request form). Clinical blood samples (PT, a PTT, 
WBC) are typi[INVESTIGATOR_374828], Burlington, NC, without identifiers. All subjects are 
discharged to home with [ADDRESS_469285] information for a physician who is familiar with the  
study.   7.4. Reporting of AEs and SAEs All SAEs will be reported to the CDER  of the FDA as well as to the UNC Biomedical IRB 
within 24 hours of recognition of the event. Adverse events will be reported to both the FDA and UNC IRB on no less than a quarterly basis, or when the protocol is completed.  If criteria for suspension of t he protocol are met, then the FDA and UNC IRB will be notified within 24 hours.  
All subjects with a non -fatal SAE will be evaluated medically by a study physician, in concert 
with their own physician as appropriate. Likewise all subjects with an adverse event will be examined and evaluated by a study physician. All assessments will in clude the same lung 
function and vital sign assessments outlined for challenge observation. Other assessments will be undertaken as needed. Any unspecified event, which in the judgment of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7966], constitutes an unusual, unexpected or prolonged event (greater than 96 hours) will be reported to 
both the FDA and the UNC IRB.

[ADDRESS_469286] confidentiality will be minimized by [CONTACT_374853]. All samples will be stored with codes only (no personal identifiers). The CEMA LB is located in the US 
Environmental Protection Agency’s Human Studies Facility on the UNC campus, which has a security guard and limited access 24 hours/day, 7 days/week.   All data and specimens will be coded with unique identifiers assigned to the subject at the time of enrollment, and actual identity cannot be ascertained exclusively from these data. Conversations and interviews with the subject, as well as collection of p ersonal medical history, 
will be carried out in private examination rooms or private offices in the CEMALB research facility. All physical examinations will be carried out in a private examination room. Access to study records containing identifiable priva te information will be provided only to those 
individuals associated with the study who require access to the data to perform their duties. These individuals will have completed ethics training as required by [CONTACT_374854]. Records containing PHI will be kept in a locked office.

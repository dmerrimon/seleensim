BACKGROUND  
Individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) experience difficulty participating in meaningful activities in 
their homes and communities due to slowing and increased energy expenditure of walking. Exercise that 
involves repetitive practice of steppi[INVESTIGATOR_133222] , tango dancing or  use of external cueing to 
facilitate larger steps improve walking performance in the PD population.1-[ADDRESS_150781] difficulty adhering to regular exercise due to barriers including lack of access to exercise facilities, 
physical, cognitive, and ps ychologic (i.e., depression) impairments, and lack of motivation and/or self-
efficacy.[ADDRESS_150782] among researchers and clinicians 
in the neurorehabilitation field because they can deliver high repetition task -specific training, while 
reducing the manual labor burden on therapi[INVESTIGATOR_133223].6  Clinical trials of 
robot -assisted treadmill training in individuals with PD demonstrate significant improvements in 
functional mobility, gait speed, walking endurance, freezing of gait, and quality of life.7-11 While these 
studies showed that people with PD accept and benefit from the use of robots, the robots used in these studies were large, heavy, complex robots (i.e., Lokomat, G -EO) that are cost prohibitive for most people 
and require months of training before they can be used independently. Recently, Honda Research and 
Development (R&D) developed a robotic exoskeleton called the Honda Walkin g Assist device (Honda 
R&D Co. Ltd., Wako, Japan) that is lightweight and portable with a goal of affordab ility and ease of use  
for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_133224].
12 The HWA facilitate s walking in people with gait deficits with little  robotic 
interference while providing  repetitive training of a symmetrical gait pattern in the home environment 
(Figure 1).  The device is worn around the user’s waist and thighs, and assists  with hip 
flexion during swing initiation and hip 
extension during stance. The robot automatically calibrat es leg movements to  
spatial and temporal cadence targets.
13 The 
device does not interfere with sitting and is 
not active during sit to/from stand 
transfers. Variable device settings allow for 
personalized, specific assistance. Advantages of wearable robotics such as 
the HWA include  easy donning and dof fing, 
and greater ease of use and free movement 
in the home and community, all of which 
yield  greater walking practice.
14  By [CONTACT_133234] -based exer cise in the home and 
community, the use of the HWA has the potential to overcome exercise/activity barriers, thereby 
[CONTACT_133235].  Previous laboratory -based studies have examined the effects of HWA device 
usage on gait spat iotemporal parameters and efficiency in healthy adult and neurological populations.14-
[ADDRESS_150783] the health and well -
being of individuals with PD. Specific Aim 1: Determine the short- term impact of mechanical gait 
assistance on efficiency and ease of walking in individuals with PD. With disease progression , individuals 
with PD develop gait impairments (e.g., slower gait velocity, shorter step lengths, increased step -to-step 
variability, and freezing of gait), that interfere with their abilities to perform daily living tasks  and 
participate in work, home, and social activities and predispose them to falls.[ADDRESS_150784] that HWA usage can 
ameliorate gait impairments in individuals with PD, and thereby [CONTACT_133236], participate in work, home, and social activities, and reduce their fall risk. Specific 
Aim 2 : Determin e the effect of long -term HWA device usage on the ease and ability to walk unassisted 
in the home and community in individuals with PD. Angular sensors embedded in the HWA monitor the 
cadence, angular velocity, and degree of hip extension and flexion of th e device user.14 When the user 
initiates walking, the HWA automatically adjusts leg movements to reach target walk ratios (step length/cadence) by [CONTACT_133237] f lexion and/or extension using power supplied by [CONTACT_133238]. Thus, the HWA applies continuous, step -by-step cueing to individuals with PD to take bigger and 
more symmetrical steps, thereby [CONTACT_133239] a faster and more efficient walking pattern. By [CONTACT_133240] e 
HWA device over an extended period of time, individuals with PD will repetitively practice walking with 
a more “normal” gait pattern, possibly driving neuroplastic changes that will trans late to improve 
unassisted walking. We hypothesize that an 8 -week i ntervention of HWA device usage will improve gait 
efficiency, gait parameters, perceived ease of walking, self -confidence, and daily physical activity in the 
home and community in individuals with PD with and without the use of the device . Positive finding s 
would justify larger clinical trials to determine the efficacy of HWA device usage to encourage adherence 
to rehabilitation programs and to promote maintenance of an active lifestyle in individuals with PD.  
 
METHODS  
 
Participants : Adults aged 50 -80 (n=46) who ambulate without assistance (Hoehn & Yahr stages 1 -3) with 
diagnosed idiopathic PD and on stable doses of Parkinson’s medications for at least 4 weeks prior to the 
study will be recruited from the Ohio State Movement Disorders Clinic and commun ity support groups. 
Exclusion criteria will be: presence of other significant cardiac, neurological or orthopedic problems that affect gait,  weight more than 220 pounds and height greater than 6’8”, electronic medical devices 
embedded in the body, particip ating in any physical therapy, and inability to understand instructions

 required by [CONTACT_1758].  Study Design : Proof -of-concept of the HWA  device has already been  established 
in prior single arm studies.14-18 This study will be a prospective Phase II randomized  controlled trial to 
assess prelimin ary efficacy.  HWA  Device : The HWA device weighs 5.95 lbs and has two motors that run 
on a single rechargeable battery  (Figure 2). The device is equipped with angle and established in prior 
single arm studies.14-18 This study will be a prospective Phase II randomized  controlled trial to assess 
preliminary efficacy.  HWA  Device : The HWA device weighs 5.95 lbs and has two motors that run on a 
single rechargeable battery  (Figure 2). The device is equipped with angle and current sensors to monitor 
hip joint angle and torque output respectively. The assist torque is transmitted to the user’s thighs via 
thigh frames. A trained healthcare 
professional, who operates the device, can 
remotely change assist settings through software that runs on a mobile device.  Honda 
will provide the researchers with a minimum of [ADDRESS_150785] points of 
adjustability at the Wais t Frame and Thigh 
Frames (Figure 2 ), such that the devices can 
accommodate ~75% of adult, [LOCATION_002] 
(US) body sizes.  Randomization: After 
obtaining written informed consent, 
participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 
groups (Trained –  HWA  group,  Untrained – 
usual care group).  Randomization allocation 
will be  1:1 and  stratified by  [CONTACT_133241] & Yahr  stage .  Each stratum randomization scheme will be generated 
in permuted blocks of varying size.  These techniques will help to ensure a balance in the rando mization 
among stage . The randomization scheme will be prepared, uploaded and overseen by [CONTACT_1758]’s 
biostatisticians. Given the nature of the intervention proposed, participants will know the intervention to which they have been assigned. Therefore, it w ill only be possible to blind assessors in this study . 
Procedures : Demographic information will be collected (i.e., age, sex, disease duration, Parkinson’s 
medications, numbers of falls in past 6 months) and a neurologist with UPDRS motor rating certificat ion 
will administer the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III –Motor Scale 
23 to assess 
motor impairments  and determine the Hoehn and Yahr stage . A researcher who is blinded to the 
participants’ group allocation and trained on relevant assessments will perform all outcome assessments. Assessments will be collected with participants in the ON phase at around one hour after taking their 
usual Parkinson’s medications. The primary outcome measure, gait velocity, will be used to validate the 
effectiveness of the HWA to improve gait parameters for both Aim 1 and 2.  Gait velocity (e.g., walking 
speed) correlates with functional ability and has been linked to clinically meaningful changes in quality of 
life and in home and community walking behavi or.
24  Aim 1 : Only participants randomized to the Trained 
group (n=23) will complete this part of the study to eliminate exposure of the Untrained group to the HWA device. Gait assessments will be conducted first during unassisted walking followed by  [CONTACT_133242]-
assisted (i.e., wearing the HWA device) walking , with rest breaks allowed between tests. Prior to HWA-
assisted walking , the researcher will select the appropriate sized HWA device, assist the participants to 
correctly don the device, and adjust the HWA  device settings to maximize the participants’ safety while 
walking. The PIs are experts  in application and use of the HWA device (preliminary d ata and unshown 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602]). Initi al device settings will be symmetrical flexion and extension assist bilaterally . The 
research therapi[INVESTIGATOR_133225]. If the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_133226] a safe gait pattern the testing  will be 
ended and the device removed. Safe gait is defined as one that results in no increase in incidence of

 stumbles and/ or balance loss during HWA -assisted walking as compared to unassisted w alking. 
Outcomes : Gait efficiency will be assessed with  the six- minute walk test  (6MWT),25 gait parameters  (i.e., 
velocity, stride length, swing time, double support, and their coefficients of variability) using GAITRite , 26 
gait safety using counts of observed epi[INVESTIGATOR_133227]/or loss of balance, and participants’ 
perceived ease of walking as indicated on a visual analog scale (100 mm line with anchors “Not at all 
easy” on the left end and “Extremely easy” on the righ t end). The GAITRite System® (CIR systems, Inc.: 
Havertown PA)  is a 4.[ADDRESS_150786] with sensors arranged in a gridlike pattern to capture 
footfall contacts.  The application software (version 3.9) processes the raw data into footfall patterns and  
computes spatial and temporal parameters. Participants will walk at a normal, comfortable pace across the walkway  for [ADDRESS_150787] trial under each condition will be a practice trial and the data from the 
remaining three trials for each condition w ill be averaged.  Aim 2: All individuals  (n=46) will participate in 
this part of the study . Intervention : After undergoing the pre -assessment , participants randomized to the 
Trained group will be fitted with the HWA device in their home by a research physic al therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. They  will 
be directed to walk with the device on and the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_133228] a safe gait pattern is 
obtained. The i nitial setting used will be the  one that produced the safest walking at the pre- assessment . 
Adjustments wi ll be made based on the response to this initial setting. Participants who achieve a safe 
gait pattern will receive phy sical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_133229] -based walking training 
wearing the HWA device [ADDRESS_150788] of walking 
in and outside of the home while encouraging larger  and more symmetrical steps with practice of 
activities (e.g., multi -directional steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], turning, navigating around obstacles) that challenge the 
person’s balance and motor control . Rest breaks will be allowed as needed . If the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_133230] a safe gait pattern , the session  will be ended and the device removed.  The 
Untrained group will continue their usual daily activities including any exercise regimen that they typi[INVESTIGATOR_133231].  However, they will be asked not to start any new exercise program during the study period . 
Outcome s: All assessments will be perfor med within one week prior to and after the 8 week intervention 
in the researcher’s laboratory at the Ohio State University with the exception of the activity monitors. 
The Untrained group will only perform gait assessments without use of the HWA. The same outcomes will be used from Aim [ADDRESS_150789] Self-Efficacy for Measuring Chronic Disease  6-Item 
Scale (SSE)  
27 questionnaire to measure part icipants’ confidence in performing daily activities. The SSE has 
been found to have good reliability and validity in individuals with Parkinson’s disease.28 To determine 
changes in activity levels, all participan ts will wear activity monitors (e.g., Biosensics LEGSysTM and 
PAMSysTM system wearable accelerometers) to quantitatively measure physical activity (e.g., number of 
step s, time spent walking, gait parameters, number of falls) for [ADDRESS_150790] any falls (i.e., an event which causes the person 
to rest inadvertently on the ground or floor) or other adverse events that occur in a diary. Sample Size :  
The primary outcome for Aim [ADDRESS_150791] 80% power to detect a difference of 0.[ADDRESS_150792] 80% power with [ADDRESS_150793] with type I error rate of 0.05.  Assuming a loss to follow -up rate of 20%, 
 
5 
 we will enroll 23 patients per group for Aim 2.  Data Analysis : The 
primary outcome for Aim [ADDRESS_150794] of 
the with/without HWA gait  change will be two -sided and at the 
0.05 level.  Exploratory analyses may consider associations of 
difference with patient characteristics such as Hoehn & Yahr stage.  Secondary outcomes for Aim [ADDRESS_150795] will be two -sided and condu cted at the 0.05 
significance level.  Sensitivity analyses will examine the per protocol population (those who followed the assigned treatment correctly) and will utilize methodology for handling missing data (i.e., multiple imputation) to account for loss  to follow -up.  
Exploratory analyses may explore differences in the treatment effect across baseline patient characteristics (such as Hoehn & Yahr stage).  Secondary outcomes for Aim [ADDRESS_150796] an interim analysis to ensure that the rate of patients in the treatment arm unable to attain a safe gait is not unacceptably high.  We will evaluate the failure rate after 10 patients in the treat ment 
arm complete the study.  If 5 or more of the 10 patients fail to attain a safe gait with the device, the study will stop to determine if termination is warranted.  Assuming an acceptable failure rate is 20%, we would 
have a 62% chance of correctly sto ppi[INVESTIGATOR_133232] 0.5.  With the 
same assumptions, we also have a 3% chance of incorrectly stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]. According to Honda R&D 
personnel , all participants who have met inclusion criteria during studies with the d evice have been able 
to safely use the device during walking.  Therefore, the failure rate of 20% is an estimation and not based 
on preliminary findings.  We will also conduct an interim analysis of data to ensure data quality and refine 
data analysis proces ses at the end of 12 months.

1.   Why  is this study  being done? People with Parkinson’s disease develop 
difficulties with walking over time that prevent them for doing their daily activities and put them at higher risk of falling.  There is some emerging evidence that the use of mechanical walking devices (also known as robotic devices) can improve the w alking 
ability of people with Parkinson’s disease. The purpose of this research is to determine 
the immediate and long -term impact of using  a light-weight mechanical walking assist 
device that is worn around a person’s waist and thighs and helps to move a person’s legs 
to take bigger steps on the walking ability of people with Parkinson’s disease.

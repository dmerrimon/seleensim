 Page 7 1. INTRODUCTION  
V onoprazan belongs to a novel class of acid suppressants known as potassium- competitive 
acid blockers (PCABs ) that suppress gastric acid secretion by [CONTACT_11749], potassium-adenosine triphosphatase ( H+, K+ -ATPase ). V onoprazan is formulated 
and administered orally as its fumarate salt, vonoprazan fumarate (MW 461.46). Following 
oral administration, the fumarate salt is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_11725] (MW 345.39),  
and vonoprazan fumarate is not detectable in human plasma. V onoprazan fumarate is also 
referred to as TAK -438,  and the free base form of vonoprazan is also referred to as 
TAK -438F. V onoprazan was discovered and developed by [CONTACT_11750] P harmaceutical Company, 
Japan and is being developed by [CONTACT_11751] (Phathom)  in the [LOCATION_002], 
Europe, and Canada for the treatment of heartburn in patients with symptomatic non -erosive 
gastroesophageal reflux disease  (sGERD), healing of all grades of erosive esophagitis  (EE) 
and relief of heartburn, maintenance of healing of all grades of EE and relief of heartburn, 
and treatment of Helicobacter pylori  infection. V onoprazan has been studied in a number of 
other gastric acid -related diseases including healing of gastric ulcer/duodenal ulcer and for 
the prevention of recurrence of peptic ulcer during nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_11726]. V onoprazan is approv ed in Japan and other countries in Asia, Latin 
America , and Russia  for a variety of these indications  in adults . 
1.1 BACKGROUND  
The gastric H+, K+ -ATPase, also known as the proton pump, is responsible for acid secretion 
from parietal cells in the stomach. It is inactive in cytoplasmic vesicles  but relocates  from the 
cytosol to the secretory membrane of parietal cells when food is present in the stomach, 
thereby [CONTACT_11752][INVESTIGATOR_007] H+ ions out of cells and into the canaliculi in 
exchange for K+ ions. The gastric proton pump represents an attractive pharmacological 
target because it is the final step of the acid secretion process. Two classes of 
pharmaceuticals, with distinct mechanisms of action for inhibiting the gastric proton pump, 
have been developed for clinical application: proton pump inhibitors ( PPIs) and PCABs. As a 
PCAB, vonoprazan has a unique mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics ( PK) relative to 
PPIs, as follows: 
• Acid activation and stability: Conventional PPIs are prodrugs that are activated by [CONTACT_11753] H+, K+- ATPase; however, activated PPIs are not stable under acidic 
conditions. In contrast, vonoprazan does not require acid activation, is stable under acidic 
conditions, and does not require enteric- coated formulations; thus, vonoprazan has a 
more durable effec t than conventional PPIs. Furthermore, vonoprazan is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_11727], Inc.  V onoprazan 
Protocol No. VPED -101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1 
 Page 8 protonated in the parietal cell canaliculi, which concentrates the drug proximal to H+, 
K+-ATPase  (Scarpi[INVESTIGATOR_11728] 2019). 
• Activity against active and inactive proton pumps: Vonoprazan inhibits acid secretion by 
[CONTACT_11754] H+, K+- ATPase. Vonoprazan 
selectively concentrates in parietal cells in both rest ing and stimulated states, binds to 
active pumps, and remains associated with active and inactive  pumps. In contrast, PPIs 
covalently bind H+, K+-ATPase only when the pump is active, as an acidic environment 
is required for the activation and accumulation of PPIs in parietal cell s (Scott  et al 2015). 
• Vonoprazan maintains acid control over 24 hours with once daily  dosing ( Engevik  et al 
2020). Vonoprazan can also be dosed in the presence or absence of food, while most PPIs 
require dosing before a meal to optimize their acid suppressant effect because activated 
pumps are at their highest level post prandially due to activation of pumps by [CONTACT_941] m eal 
(Shin and Kim 2013). 
• Extended half- life: The plasma half -life of vonoprazan is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 7  to 8 hours after 
single and multiple once daily administration . This is significantly lon ger than the 
half-life of conventional PPIs (<2 hours) ( Shin and Kim 2013). 
• Metabolism: Vonoprazan is predominantly metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 
(CYP)3A4/5 , which lacks a high degree of genetic polymorphisms compared with 
CYP2C19, the primary enzyme responsib le for the metabolism of PPIs  (Shin and 
Kim 2013). Therefore, vonoprazan can be administered without regard to CYP2C19 
metabolizer status.  
These unique aspects of vonoprazan’s mechanis m of action and PK relative to th ose of PPIs 
translate into a greater magnitude and duration of gastric acid suppression, which are 
reflected in the pharmacodynamic profile ( Jenkins  et al 2015; Sakurai  et al 2015). 
V onoprazan is absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_11729], with the median  time of peak 
plasma concentrations ( Tmax) typi[INVESTIGATOR_11730] 1.5 to 2 hours after once daily dosing. 
V onoprazan exhibits time-independent pharmacokinetics, and steady state concentrations are 
achieved by [CONTACT_2006] 3 to 4. There is little accumulation of vonopr azan in plasma after multiple 
once daily doses, with an accumulation ratio index based on an area under the plasma 
concentration versus time curve ( AUC ) of <1.2 for doses ranging from 10 to 40 mg. Overall, 
vonoprazan has been well tolerated in healthy subj ects in Phase 1 studies, as well as in 
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  V onoprazan 
Protocol No. VPED -101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1 
 Page 9 subjects with gastric acid -related diseases  who completed Phase  2 and 3 studies in the United 
States, Europe, Japan, and Asia (outside of Japan). 
Further information on the study drug can be found in the investigator’s brochure ( IB) 
([COMPANY_005] Pharmaceutical  2022).  
1.[ADDRESS_11137]. 
The current adult formulation and size of vonoprazan tablets are appropriate for 
administration in pediatric  subjects  12 years of age or older, who are capable of swallowing 
tablets. However, different strengths and formulations will need to be developed to support 
the pediatric clinical program for the pediatric age group <12  years of age and for pediatric 
patients inca pable of swallowing tablets. Phathom is investigating a sprinkle capsule 
formulation for these pediatric patients.  Therefore, this study will investigate the 
bioavailability (BA) of vonoprazan in healthy adult subjects  when administered as 20 mg 
sprinkle c apsules  on pudding or on applesauce relative  to 20 mg tablets, in accordance with 
the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) Guidance  for industry: Bioavailability and 
Bioequivalence Studies Submitted in NDAs or INDs – General Considerations 
(DHHS 2014). The use of healthy adult subjects is appropriate for the BA study prior to 
initiation of studies in pediatric patients . 
Relative BA  will be based on the maximum observed plasma concentratio n (Cmax), area 
under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time [ADDRESS_11138] quantifiable 
concentration ( AUC 0-t), and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 
time 0 extrapolated to infinity ( AUC 0-inf) to determine the peak and total drug exposure. 
Analysis of plasma concentrations will characterize the single -dose PK of vonoprazan 20 mg 
sprinkle capsule (either sprinkled on pudding or on applesauce ).

7. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLANS  
7.1 SAMPLE SI ZE CALCULATIONS  
The sample size for this study is based on a statistical power calculation.  
This crossover study will enroll 27 subjects to ensure 24 subjects complete the study, 
assuming an approximate dropout rate of 15%. With [ADDRESS_11163] 97% power to conclude bioequivalence between the test treatments and the 
reference treatment, assuming that the vonoprazan PK parameters C max, AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-inf 
are log -normally distributed, the true GMR is 1, and the intras ubject coefficient of variation 
is no greater than 20%. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment sequences in a 
1:1:1 ratio. 
7.2 ANALYSIS SETS  
The analysis populations are as follows: 
• The PK population will include subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_11164] 1 PK 
parameter . Subjects who experience vomiting  within 2 times the median T max after study 
drug dosing will be excluded from the PK analysis. 
• The safety population will include all subjects who receive at least 1  dose of study drug.

 Page 24 7.3 STATISTICAL ANALYS ES 
Details of all statistical analyses will be described in a separate statistical analysis plan. All 
data collected will be presented in data listings. Data from subjects excluded from an analysis 
population will be presented in the data listings but not included in the calculation of 
summary statistics.  
For categorical variables, frequ encies and percentages will be presented. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, median, 
standard deviation [ SD], minimum, and maximum). 
Baseline demographic and background variables will be summarized overall for all subjects. 
The number of subjects who enroll in the study and the number and percentage of subjects 
who complete the study will be presented. Frequency and percentage of subjects who 
withdraw or discontinue from the study, and the reason for withdrawal or discontinuation, 
will also be summarized.  
7.3.1 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Individual plasma concentration and time deviation data will be presented in a data listing. 
Plasma concentration data will be summarized by [CONTACT_11758]: number of subjects, arithmetic mean, SD, coefficient of 
variation ( CV), median, minimum, and maximum. Individual and mean plasma concentration 
versus scheduled time profiles will be presented in figures on both l inear and 
semilogarithmic scales.  
V onoprazan PK parameters will be calculated using actual sampling times. All parameters 
will be calculated using the latest version of Phoenix® WinNonlin® (Certara [LOCATION_003] Inc., 
Princeton, New Jersey) or SAS® (SAS Institute In c., Cary, North Carolina). The individual 
PK parameters will be presented in data listings and summarized by [CONTACT_11759]: number of subjects, mean, SD, CV , median, minimum, and 
maximum. Geometric means  and geometric CV will be included for AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and 
Cmax. 
A linear mixed model with fixed effects  for treatment, sequence, and period and subject 
within sequence as a random effect will be performed on the natural log- transformed values 
of AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max to assess the relative BA of the test dose form (vonoprazan 
sprinkle capsule [either sprinkled on pudding , Treatment  A, or on applesauce , Treatment  B]) 
to the reference dose form ( vonoprazan tablet , Treatment C). The  geometric least square

applesauce) and the reference treatment (20  mg tablet) are wholly contained within 0.[ADDRESS_11165] 
version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ). All AE data will be 
presented in a data listing . Treatment -emergent AEs will  be summarized by [CONTACT_11761], as well as by [CONTACT_11762]. Serious AEs and AEs l eading to 
discontinuation of study drug will also be presented in the data listings and summarized by 
[CONTACT_11763].  
Actual values and changes from baseline for clinical laboratory test results, vital sign 
measurements, and 12-lead ECG results will be summarized at each time point using 
descriptive statistics ( number of subjects, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum). 
Shift tables will be generated for clinical laboratory test results. Physical examination 
findings will be presented in a data listing.  
7.4 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA

[IP_ADDRESS]  General Criteria  for Withdrawal  
Subjects can withdraw consent and discontinue from the study at any time, for any reason, 
without prejudice to further treatment. 
The investigator may withdraw a subject from the study if the subject meets any of the 
following criteria:  
1. Is noncompliant with the protocol 
2. Experiences a n SAE or intolerable AE(s) that, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], requires 
withdrawal from the study 
3. Has laboratory safety assessments that reveal clinically significant hematological or 
biochemical changes from ba seline values (if a subject’s ALT or AST or total bilirubin is 
>3 × ULN at any time during study medication treatment, the study medication should be 
discontinued immediately with appropriate clinical follow -up, including repeat laboratory 
tests, until the  subject’s laboratory profile has returned to normal/baseline status) 
4. Develops symptoms or conditions that are listed in the exclusion criteria during the 
course of the study 
5. Requires a medication prohibited by [CONTACT_760] 
6. Requests early discontinuation for any reason 
7. Becomes pregnant  
The investigator can also withdraw a subject upon the request of the sponsor or if the sponsor 
terminates the study. If withdrawal is considered because of an SAE or intolerable 
pre-treatment event ( PTE)/AE, the investigator will confer with the sponsor. If a subject is 
discontinued because of a PTE/AE, the event will be followed until it is resolved, stable, o r 
judged by [CONTACT_11755].

REPORTING  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF 
and reported to the sponsor, regardless of their relationship to study drug or clinical 
significance . If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event 
should be reported. 
9.3.[ADDRESS_11173] who has signed informed 
consent to participate in a study; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship 
with study participation. 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject enrolled in this study 
regardless of its causal relationship to study drug. An AE can therefore be an unfavorable 
sign or symptom, or a disease temporally associated with the use of study drug. 
A treatment -emergent A E is defined as any event that occurs after the first dose of study drug 
or any event at baseline that worsens in either intensity or frequency after the first dose of 
study drug. 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that meets one of the 
following criteria:  
1. Results in death. 
2. Is life -threatening. The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was 
at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.  
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
6. Is an important medical event that satisfies any of  the following:

Protocol No. VPED -[ADDRESS_11176] AEs for this study. 
Reporting of Abnormal Liver Function Tests: 
If a subject is noted to have an ALT or AST value >3 × ULN and a total bilirubin value 
>2 × ULN  during the treatment or follow-up period for whi ch an alternative etiology has not 
been identified, the event should be reported as an SAE . The investigator must contact [CONTACT_11768], such as acute viral hepatitis A or B , other acute liver disease , medical history , or 
concurrent medical conditions. Study drug should be discontinued immediately as per 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . Laboratory tests should be follow ed-up as described in Section 6.2.[ADDRESS_11177] >3  × ULN and a  
2-fold increase above baseline, follow- up laboratory tests (at a minimum, serum alkaline  
phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transferase, and INR) should be 
repeated within a maximum of [ADDRESS_11178] >5  × ULN,  
follow-up laboratory tests (at a minimum, serum alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total 
bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transferase, and INR) should be repeated within a maximum of 
[ADDRESS_11179] 
>8 × ULN, follow -up laboratory tests (at a minimum, serum alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, 
total bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transferase, and INR) should be repeated within a maximum  of 
[ADDRESS_11180] administered study drug (Day 1). Routine 
collection will continue until the follow -up visit or withdrawal from the study. 
On each study day, the investigator will assess whether any subjective AEs have occurred. A 
neutral question such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” may be asked. 
Subjects may report AEs occurring at any other time during the study. Subjects experiencing 
a serious PTE must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant 
changes in laboratory values have returned to baseline or there is a satisfactory explanation 
for the change. Nonserious PTEs, related or unrelated to the study procedure, do not need  to 
be followed up for the purposes of the protocol. All subjects experiencing AEs, w hether 
considered associated with the use of the study drug or not, must be monitored until the 
symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in laboratory values have returned to 
baseline or until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes  observed. 
In addition to subject observations, AEs will be documented from any data collected on the 
AE page of the eCRF (eg, laboratory values, physical examination findings, and ECG 
changes) or other documents that are relevant to subject safety.  
9.3.3 Reporting Adverse Events  
All PTEs and AEs will be documented on the PTE/AE page of the eCRF, regardless of 
whether the investigator concludes that the event is related to drug treatment. Information to 
be collected includes event term, start and stop date, seriousness, severity, investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_11739](s) 
(related or not related ; not applicable for PTEs), action concerning study drug (not applicable 
for PTEs), any required treatment or evaluations, and the outcome of the event. 
Any AE s resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to 
concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will 
be followed until they are resolved, stable, or judged by [CONTACT_11769]. Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened but 
does not deteriorate should not be reported as an AE. However, if the medical conditio n 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it should be recorded as an AE. Section 9.3.4  
provides additional details. The MedDRA  will be used to code all AEs. 
Any AE that is considered serious by [CONTACT_11770] 
(Section  9.3.1 ) must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours (after the investigator has 
confirmed the occurrence of the SAE). The investigator will assess whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that the study drug (s) caused the SAE. The sponsor will be responsible

 Page 37 for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of any SAE as outlined in US Title 21 Code 
of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) Parts [ADDRESS_11181] (IRB) directly.  Contact [CONTACT_11771] 6.2.[ADDRESS_11182] finding generally may involve the following: 
• Indicates a ne w diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre-existing condition 
(pre-existing conditions or underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or AEs) 
• Necessitates therapeutic intervention  
• Requires an invasive diagnostic procedure 
• Requires discontinuation or a change in dose of study drug or a concomitant medication 
• Is considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_11772]-treatment events /AEs caused by a study procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should 
be recorded as a PTE/AE.  
Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms: 
• Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs 
(including abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be 
recorded as additional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, signs or symptoms should be 
recorded appropriately as PTEs or as AEs.  
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  V onoprazan 
Protocol No. VPED -101 Clinical Study P rotocol Amendment 1 
 Page 38 Laboratory values and ECG findings: 
• Changes in laboratory values or ECG findings are only considered to be PTEs or AEs if 
they are judged to be clinically significant (ie, if some action or intervention is  required 
or if the investigator judges the change to be beyond the range of normal physiologic 
fluctuation). A laboratory or ECG retest or continued monitoring of an abnormal value or 
finding is not considered an intervention. In addition, repeated or additional noninvasive 
testing for verification, evaluation, or monitoring of an abnormality is not considered an 
intervention. 
• If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there 
is an overall diagnosis (eg, increased creatinine in renal failure), only the diagnosis 
should be reported as a PTE or an AE. 
Pre-existing conditions: 
• Pre-existing conditions (present at the time of signing of informed consent) are 
considered concurrent medical conditions and should NOT be record ed as PTEs or AEs. 
Baseline evaluations (eg, laboratory tests, ECGs, etc) should NOT be recorded as PTEs 
unless related to study procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or 
complication of such a concurrent medical condition, the worsening or complication 
should be recorded appropriately as a PTE (if the worsening or complication occurs 
before administration of study drug) or an AE (if the worsening or complication occurs 
after administration of study drug). Investigators should ensure th at the recorded event 
term captures the change in the condition (eg, “worsening of…”). 
• If a subject has a pre -existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_11740] (eg, asthma, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]), any occurrence of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_11741] a PTE/AE only if the 
condition becomes more frequent, serious, or severe in nature. Investigators should 
ensure that the recorded AE term captures the change in the condition from baseline (eg, 
“worsening of…”). 
• If a subject has a degenerative concurrent medical condition (eg, ca taracts, rheumatoid 
arthritis), worsening of the condition should only be recorded as a PTE/AE if it occurs to 
a greater extent than would be expected. Investigators should ensure that the recorded AE 
term captures the change in the condition (eg, “worsening of…”). 
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  V onoprazan 
Protocol No. VPED -101 Clinical Study P rotocol Amendment 1 
 Page 39 Worsening of PTEs or AEs: 
• If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a PTE after the start of study 
drug, the worsening or complication should be recorded as an AE. Investigators should 
ensure that the recorded AE term captures the  change in the PTE (eg, “worsening of…”). 
• If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any change in 
study drug, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators 
should ensure that the recorded AE term captures the change in the condition 
(eg, “worsening of…”). 
Changes in intensity of AEs/serious PTEs: 
• If the subject experiences changes in the intensity of an AE/serious PTE, the event should 
be captured once with the maximum intensity recorded. 
Preplanned procedures (surgeries or interventions): 
• Preplanned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
informed consent are not considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is 
performed early (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre-existing condition, 
the worsening of the condition should be recorded as a PTE or an AE. Complications 
resulting from any planned surgery should be reported as AEs. 
Elective surgeries or procedures: 
• Elective procedures  performed when there is no change in the subject’s medical condition 
should not be recorded as PTEs or AEs but should be documented in the subject’s source 
documents. Complications resulting from an elective surgery should be reported as AEs. 
Insufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy):  
• Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic action should NOT be recorded 
as an AE. The investigator must make the distinction between exacerbation of 
pre-existing illness and lack of therapeutic efficacy. 
Overdose: 
Cases of overdose with any medication without manifested side effects are NOT considered 
PTEs or AEs but instead will be documented on the overdose page of the eCRF. Any 
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  V onoprazan 
Protocol No. VPED -101 Clinical Study P rotocol Amendment 1 
 Page 40 manifested side effects will be considered PTEs or AEs and will be recor ded on the AE page 
of the eCRF.  
9.3.5 Assessment of Severity  
The severity (or intensity) of an AE refers to the extent to which it affects the subject’s daily 
activities  and will be classified as mild, moderate, or severe using the following criteria: 
• Mild:  The event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423] . 
• Moderate:  The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual 
activities . 
• Severe:  The event  causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities . 
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow the duration of the event at 
each level of intensity to be assessed. An AE characterized as intermittent does not require 
documentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
9.3.6 Assessment of Causality  
The i nvestigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study drug is part of the 
documentation process but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the 
study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be 
reported. 
The investigator will assess  causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study drug caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will be classified as 
follows: 
• Not related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of a drug and/or can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as 
underlying diseases, complications, concomitant drugs, and concurrent treatments. 
• Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
study drug (including the course after withdrawal of the drug) or for which possible 
involvement of the drug cannot be ruled out, although factors other than the study drug, 
such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant drugs, and concurrent 
treatments, may also be responsible.

Protocol No. VPED -101 Clinical Study P rotocol Amendment 1 
 Page 41 [IP_ADDRESS]  Relationship to Study Procedures  
Relationship (causality) to study procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs. 
The relationship should be assessed as related if the investigator considers that there is 
reasonable possibility that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship 
should be assessed as not related. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Start Date  
The start date of the AE/PTE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were not ed by [CONTACT_11773]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Stop Date  
The stop date of the AE/PTE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved 
with sequelae, or the subject died. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Frequency  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_11742]/PTE s (eg, vomiting) or those that occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive 
days are intermittent. All other events are continuous. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Action Concerning Study Drug  
• Drug withdrawn: The study drug is stopped due to the particular AE. 
• Dose not changed: T he particular AE does  not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_11743]. 
• Unknown: Only to be used if it cannot be determined what action was taken. 
• Not applicable: Study drug is stopped for a reason other than the particular AE; eg, the 
study was terminated, the subject died, or dosing with study drug was already stopped 
before the onset of the AE. 
• Dose reduced: The dose i s reduced due to the particular AE.  
• Dose increased: The dose i s increased due to the particular AE.  
• Drug interrupted: T he dose is interrupted due to the particular AE. 
Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  V onoprazan 
Protocol No. VPED -101 Clinical Study P rotocol Amendment 1 
 Page 42 [IP_ADDRESS]  Outcome 
• Recovered/resolved: The subject returns to first assessment status with respect to the 
AE/PTE.  
• Recovering/resolving: The intensity is decreased by 1 or more stages, the diagnosis or 
signs/symptoms have almost disappeared, the abnormal laboratory value has improved 
but has not returned to the normal range or to baseline, or the subject dies from a cause 
other than the particular AE/PTE with the condition remaining “recovering/resolving”. 
• Not recovered/not resolved: There is no change in the diagnosis, signs, or symptoms; the 
intensity of the diagnosis, signs/symptoms, or laboratory value on the last day of the 
observed study period is worse than when it started; the condition is an irreversible 
congenital anomaly; or the subject died from another cause while the particular AE/PTE 
state was “not recovered/not resolved”.  
• Resolved with sequelae: The subject recovers from an acute AE/PTE but is left with 
permanent/significant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis ). 
• Fatal: AEs/PTEs that are considered the cause of death.  
• Unknown: The course of the AE/PTE cannot be followed up due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1670]’s participation in the study. 
9.3.[ADDRESS_11183] report beco mes available at a 
later date, the  investigator should update the SAE eCRF form and transmit it immediately 
within 24 hours of receipt. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1672] (eg, ECG 
result s, laboratory test result s, discharge summary, postmortem results) should be provided, if 
requested.  
All SAEs should be followed up until resolution or permanent outcome of the event. The 
timelines and procedure for follow- up reports are the same as those for the initial report.

deviation from, or a change to, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study 
subjects without prior IRB approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the 
implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendments 
should be submitted to the IRB for review and approval, to the sponsor for agreement, and to 
the regulatory authorities, if required. 
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or 
procedures defined in the protocol. An important deviation (sometimes referred to as a major 
or significant deviation) is a subset of protocol deviations that leads to a subject being 
discontinued from the study, or significantly affects the subject’s rights, safety, or well -being 
and/or the completeness, accuracy , and reliability of the study data. An important deviation 
can include nonadherence to inclusion or exclusion criteria or nonadherence to FDA 
regulations or ICH E6(R2) guidelines. 
Protocol deviations will be documented by [CONTACT_11782]. The investigator will be notified in writing by [CONTACT_11783].

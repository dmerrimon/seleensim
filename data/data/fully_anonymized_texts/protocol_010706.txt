Title of Study: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_893352] (AIMSS)   
 
Hypotheses:  Baseline plasma oxylipin profiles can be used to predict who is at risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_893353].  
 Primary Objectives:  
 
• To compare baseline oxylipin levels in women that do vs. those that do not develop AIMSS  
 
Secondary Objectives: 
 
• To correlate changes in oxylipin panels with changes in tendon stiffness   
• To correlate changes in levels of oxylipi[INVESTIGATOR_893354] 6-month AI treatment.  
 
Study design: This is a prospective single arm  study  enrolling patients (n = 35) with breast 
cancer scheduled to start adjuvant hormonal therapy. Patients would have completed all 
their primary treatments (surgery±  radiation therapy) and are scheduled to start their 
adjuvant hormonal therapy. They get baseline blood drawn for oxylipi [INVESTIGATOR_2115]. They start 
adjuvant anastrozole and have blood drawn at 3mths and 6mths for measurement of oxylipi[INVESTIGATOR_2115] .. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_893355]. Once pi[INVESTIGATOR_893356], 
goal is to apply for funding for a larger trial to further evaluate and validate these biomarkers

Statistical analysis 
 
Statistical Considerations:  This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_893358] a larger study.  The primary objectives are to estimate the baseline oxylipin levels 
in patients who develop with AIMSS vs. those who do not develop AIMSS.  Analysis will 
be based on descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals for each group.  
Although we will not formally test for differences between the two groups, we will estimate the difference with a 95% confidence interval to inform the design of a larger 
study.   
 The secondary objectives are to correlate changes in oxylipin levels with changes in pain 
scores.  These analyses will be based on all 20 women, irrespective of whether they develop AIMSS.   
 Feasibility Issues:  From 2015 to 2016, ~ 40 patients were started on adjuvant 
anastrozole therapy who meet our eligibility criteria. Thus, we anticipate accrual of 2 -3 
patients per month and completion of accrual this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] w ithin 8 -12 months of study 
initiation. Based on previously published studies, it is  expected that 50% of women 
initiating AI will develop AIMSS within one year, with most women experiencing symptoms by [ADDRESS_1251099].Martinez will be overseeing the oxylipin data analysis.

Protocol Version 4 dated December 2, 2020  
 1. Introduction  
 
Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs), Adherence, Musculoskeletal Symptoms and Mortality. 
Adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy is the recommended first -line adjuvant 
treatment for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast 
cancer based on  improved disease- free survival (DFS) compared to tamoxifen in 
randomized control trials. More recently extended adjuvant AI therapy (for 10 years) has 
been shown to improve DFS when compared to placebo in women who completed [ADDRESS_1251100] AI therapy .1,2 However, AI therapy has been associated with 
significant, activity -limiting musculoskeletal symptoms including arthralgia, myalgia and 
joint stiffness or AI -induced musculoskeletal syndrome (AIMSS).[ADDRESS_1251101] commonly reported and 
debilitating side effects of adjuvant AI therapy;[ADDRESS_1251102] Cancer 
Action, 27% of respondents reported that they had discontinued adjuvant AI use because of adverse effects (AE), with AIMSS being the leading AE.
12 In a cohort study in 
[LOCATION_004], 61% of patients on AIs developed joint and/or bone pain resulting in 
discontinuation of therapy in 20% of patients.13 In a recent study, full adherence, defined 
as full duration and optimal schedule, was observed for only 49% of breast cancer (BC) patients prescribed any hormone therapy (HT) and was related to higher mortality in 
those who discontinued [Hazards Ratio (HR) = 1.26 (Confidence interval (CI) 1.09– 
1.46)] or were non- adherent to HT [HR = 1.49 (CI 1.23– 1.81)].
14 This study is concerning 
and consistent with clinical trial evidence from prior tamoxifen studies showing higher 
recurrence rates and worse outcomes with < [ADDRESS_1251103] in part, to a) loss of the 
anti-nociceptive action of estradiol - resulting in greater sensitivity to stimuli and b) 
presence of underlying inflammation and the nociceptive activity or pain- inducing 
response of PGE 2. In aromatase -knockout mice, which lack endogenous estrogen 
production and serve as an animal model of AI therapy, estrogen deprivation results in a 
dominance of pro- nociceptive (pain) over anti -nociceptive response mechanisms 
following noxious stimuli such as formalin injection.20 Results from experimental models 
to determine the role of estradiol in inflammation and specifically in cyclooxygenase 
(COX) -mediated PGE 2 are inconsistent and model dependent. Hunter et al  
demonstrated that ovariectomized rats exhibited greater sensitivity to a pain stimulus, as 
7 
Protocol Version 4 dated December 2, 2020  
 measured by [CONTACT_893390].21 Serum levels 
of PGE 2 were increased in these rats, indicating an increase in inflammation. Pain 
sensit ivity was reversed with estradiol replacement but serum PGE 2 levels did not 
change, indi cating a separate mechanism for  inflammatory response. The addition of a 
COX2 inhibitor increased latency to paw withdrawal compared to estradiol replacement 
alone, indicating a reduced pain response for these animals, and again indicating separate roles for inflammation and estradiol in pain response.
22 Using this same model, 
ibuprofen (a non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug, NSAID; a COX inhibitor) + estradiol 
replacement was shown to be more effective in reducing pain than either estradiol or 
ibuprofen alone.22 Collectively, these results indicate that the loss of estrogen alone 
does not increase pain by [CONTACT_893391] 2; but in the presence of PGE 2-mediated 
inflammation, estrogen deprivation increases sensitivity to inflammatory pain. Therefore, if PGE
[ADDRESS_1251104] established estradiol as having both anti -
inflammatory and anti -nociceptive properties.
24 Increased inflammation with aging, 
mediated by [CONTACT_480428] -inflammatory prostaglandins (PGs), including PGE 2, 
has been mechanistically linked to hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to painful stimuli) 
and allodynia (painful response to what would normally be an innocuous stimulus). Thus, 
inflammation and injury that stimulate PG release are thought to result in a heightened nociception and allodynia with the decline in estradiol levels with menopause.
[ADDRESS_1251105] -generation AIs in routine clinical 
use cause different levels of estradiol suppression,26 toxicity profiles are similar for all of 
them.27-29 Further, many studies show that  there is no correlation with degree of estrogen 
depletion and pain in women on AI, regardless of AI type.30,31 Differences between 
agents in terms of quality of life (QOL) and tolerability are very important when selecting 
the optimal therapy for individual patients. Randomized clinical trials comparing 
tolerability and QOL between letrozole and anastrozole did not show any significant 
differences between the QOL scores. They did report that subjects who were intolerant 
to one AI were nonetheless able to tolerate another agent.32,[ADDRESS_1251106] also 
demonstrated that switching AIs can result in improvements of AIMSS.33,34 This is a 
significant finding given that —despi[INVESTIGATOR_893359] —AIMSS can 
sometimes be managed by [CONTACT_893392] .   
AIMSS management is an area of active research interest. For patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_893353], the re is evidence that acupuncture
,35,36 high dose vitamin D37 or exercise38 might 
help in alleviating their symptoms. Yet results are not always consistent  and are limited 
by [CONTACT_893393]. Recently, a randomized, placebo- controlled study 
reported a 50% decrease in AIMSS symptoms with ω -3 fatty acid supplementation; 
however, this change was not significantly different when compared to the placebo arm.
39 Retrospective clinical data reported a significantly decreased recurrence and 
longer disease- free survival in obese women with ER+ tumors who take NSAIDs.[ADDRESS_1251107] gastrointestinal and cardiac side effects. Currently, for a patient who 
develops AIMSS, routine management  involves i) pain control with NSAID’s or other 
pain medicines, ii) stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_893360] a different AI or tamoxifen, iii) stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_893361]) referral to orthopedic surgeon based on 
[ADDRESS_1251108] -studied metabolite of arachidonic 
acid metabolism, arachidonic acid and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (i.e., ω -3 and ω -
6) are also metabolized by [CONTACT_893394] (LOX) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
enzymes, yielding distinct sets of metabolites with their own biological activities. 
Collectively, these COX, LOX and CYP metabolites are called oxylipi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]. The oxylipin 
metabolites of ω -3 and ω -6 fatty acids comprise over 100 metabolites, each of which 
exhibit potent biological effects, including acting as modulators of inflammation (pro - and 
anti-) as well as activators of angiogenesis and mediators of hyper algesia and 
allodynia.41-[ADDRESS_1251109] and downstream epoxyeicosatrienoic acids in vitro .45 It is well 
established that downregulation of PGE 2 production through inhibition of COX2 
alleviates inflammatory pain. Preliminary evidence implicates both the CYP450 and LOX pathways in the development of tendinopathy.
46,47 Two earlier clinical trials showed that 
12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12 -HETE) was significantly correlated with pain in 
menstruating women,48,49 suggesting interplay between 12-H ETE and hormonal 
changes. Our preliminary data in AI -treated women participating in an intervention with 
sulindac (a non -selective COX2 inhibitor) suggests involvement of 12 -HETE and other 
LOX metabolites in AIMSS (see Approach). If we successfully show that oxylipi[INVESTIGATOR_893362], there are already pharmacologic agents available (COX and LOX inhibitors) or in development (CYP pathway inhibitors) that can 
be implemented to target these pathways

 Plasma and urine samples are collected before and after a 3 -month observation period 
(months -3 and 0), and after 3, 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_1251113] -menopausal women 
diagnosed with ER+ breast cancer. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study 
regarding breast cancer history are the similar as the proposed work except that 
participants in the Sulindac trial must have been stable on AI for [ADDRESS_1251114] conducted oxylipin profiling in the plasma and urine 
in 10 women after the 3 month observation period (selected based on availability of 
samples). We quantified [ADDRESS_1251115] cancer patients.86-88 Levels of target oxylipi[INVESTIGATOR_893369] a 3 -month observation 
period (PGE 2 and 12 -HETE) in women on AI are presented in Table 1.  
Pain and oxylipi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]. How much pain interferes with daily activities such as walking ability 
was evaluated using the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI -SF). Oxylipin levels after a 
3 month observation period were correlated with questionnaire items at the same time-
point. Table 2  presents the results from linear regression comparing how much pain 
interferes with walking ability and selected plasma oxylipin levels in 10 women stable on 
AI.  PGE 2 levels were not correlated with how much pain interfered with walking ability. 
However, plasma levels of the LOX metabolite, 12- HETE, were significantly correlated. 
While not statistically significant, a similar pattern was observed across multiple LOX 
metabolites. This trend could still be observed in only 10 participants with overall  low 
scores for how much pain interferes with walking ability (mean ± SD; 2.48 ± 2.45), which 
suggests a role for the LOX arm of the oxylipin pathway in the development of AIMSS. 
There was no correlation (positive or negative) with CYP450- derived metabolites and 
pain scores (data not shown).  
While these results are promising and suggest that the LOX pathway may be related to AIMSS, samples from this clinical trial have several limitations. First, participants in this 
study were stable on AI for at least 6 months. Therefore, there is no true “baseline” to 
quantify oxylipi[INVESTIGATOR_893370]. Second, hand -specific symptoms, common in AIMSS, were not 
evaluated. Third, there is no BPI -SF score that specifically addresses AIMSS 
development. Fourth, while we have presented  our preliminary data from the baseline 
(post -NSAID washout and 3 month observation period) only, women in this study initiate 
intervention with sulindac (a non- specific COX2 inhibitor). Thus, it is likely that the 
oxylipin cascade will be modulated by [CONTACT_25234], and stored samples from this trial 
will not be appropriate to determine changes in oxylipi[INVESTIGATOR_893371]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_141859], these data demonstrate that oxylipi[INVESTIGATOR_893372], and that they are present in a wide 
enough range of levels to relate to pain scores.

5. Study Procedures  
 5.1 Pretreatment  
 Patients will be consented and evaluated for participation based on the following procedures before being registered and starting trial:  
• History and physical exam (should be performed within 28 days of trial entry)  
• Eligibility as determined by [CONTACT_21198] 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1251122] Team Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) from 8:00 a.m. to 5 :[ADDRESS_1251123] Time, Monday through Friday, (excluding holidays)  
 
Registration Guidelines 
 
Before a subject participates in the trial, the investigator or delegate is responsible for 
obtaining written informed consent after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, subject responsibilities and potential hazards of the study and before 
any protocol -specific screening  or study medications  are administered. All patients must 
be registered before the start of treatment.   
  
 
 
[ADDRESS_1251124] blood for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_893376].  
Fasting blood will be drawn at the pre -determined time points (figure 1)  and sent to [CONTACT_893405]’s laboratory at the University of Arizona Cancer Center for further processing.  
 5.[ADDRESS_1251125] Cancer Prevention Trial –Musculoskeletal Symptom (BCPT -
MS) subscale and The Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) have been validated as the most responsive tools for evaluating the development of 
AIMSS.
62 These tools will be administered by [CONTACT_74309]. 
BCPT -MS: Individuals with a subscale score of ≥1.[ADDRESS_1251126] developed AIMSS, and it is expected that 50% of our sample will develop 
AIMSS.62,63 Our primary study endpoints will be correlated to three items on the BCPT-
MS: general aches and pains, joint pain, and muscle stiffness.64,[ADDRESS_1251127] cancer survivors.66 The subscale score consists of the mean of responses to 
three questions addressing general aches and pains, joint pain, and muscle stiffness(questions 8,9,10 of the attached subscale). Scores range from 0–[ADDRESS_1251128] responsive to changes in AIMSS with 54% of women developi[INVESTIGATOR_893377] 6 months.
62   
WOMAC:  The WOMAC is a 24 -item instrument developed to assess pain, stiffness, and 
physical function in participants with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis.68 This instrument is 
well validated and has been modified from its original form, and used extensively to 
examine specific joint pain changes following treatment, including drug- based (NSAID) 
interventions for back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia.69-78  For our study, we 
will use the 5 -point Likert format.  
Depression Questionnaire. It has been reported that up to 50% of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients have symptoms of depression or anxiety
79 and perception of pain 
may be altered in individuals with symptoms  of depression.80 Therefore, we will also 
administer the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) -[ADDRESS_1251129] of care by [CONTACT_4676]’s treating physician.  
  
[ADDRESS_1251130] 10 patients to develop AIMSS and 10 who do not develop AIMSS. The g oal is 
to prospectively evaluate for any  baseline levels in both groups and for  changes in oxylipin 
panels.  
 
 
7. Statistical Considerations:   
 This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_893378] a larger study.  The primary 
objectives are to estimate the baseline oxylipin levels in patients who develop AIMSS vs. 
those who do not develop AIMSS.  Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals 
will be computed for two baseline oxylipin levels (PGE
2 and 12 -HETE)  for each group .  
Based on clinical observation, it is expected that 50% of the women will develop AIMSS.  Ten patients in each group will allow us to estimate the 95% confidence interval with width 1.[ADDRESS_1251131] for 
differences between the two groups, we will estimate the difference between the means 
with a 95% confidence interval, to inform the sample size justification for a larger study.  
 
 The secondary objectives are to correlate changes in oxylipin levels with changes in pain 
scores.  These analyses will be based on all [ADDRESS_1251132] that only a small number of women may switch to another AI due to the development of AIMSS.  For these women, we will use the values obtained 
at the time of the switch.  Linear regression will be used to estimate the change in pain 
scores (as measured by [CONTACT_893397] -MS) versus changes in PGE
2, 12-HETE.  
Additionally, we will control for changes in depression levels as measured by [CONTACT_127659] -9. 
This model will allow us to estimate the effects of each of the oxylipin measures adjusted 
for depression in a single model.

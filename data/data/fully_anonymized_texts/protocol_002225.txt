Version 4.0 9-21-2021  11 1.0 Background  and Rationale : 
Patients with acute decompensated HF  (ADHF) are generally admitted due to 
symptoms of congestion a nd 90% are treated with a loop diuretic.[ADDRESS_394881] of these patients are inadequately decongested due primarily to “diuretic 
resistance”  and/ or “cardiorenal syndrome” .2,3 The inability to achieve decongestion is 
associated with a worse prognosis and a higher rate of re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320013].2 
More than 40%  of all patients admitted with ADHF have diabetes and that percentage is 
growing both in Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction ( HFrEF ) and Preserved 
Ejection Fraction  (HFpEF ).4  
The admission blood glucose is elevated in approximately one -half of ADHF 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. 5,6 We recently demonstrated the admission blood glucose was within 
50mg/dl of the chronic average blood glucose in 66% of patients with diabetes admitted 
with ADHF.7 The median (IQR) admission blood glucose change from the chronic blood 
glucose was only -7 (-29, 26) mg/dl.[ADDRESS_394882] failed to improve 
outcomes in either the chronic or acute heart failure patients.8,9 Diuretic resistance and 
hyperglycemia are common problems in ADHF admissions and represent a therapeutic 
opportunity for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].5,10 
The sodium -glucose  cotransporter -2(SGLT2) inhibitors, now approved for the anti -
hyperglycemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_320014] .[ADDRESS_394883] decrements in systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure with a marked drop in albuminuria and a small drop in 
estimated GFR ( -5 mL min-1.1.73 m-2) which returns to baseline over time.11  In patients 
with diabetes the SGLT2 transporte r likely accounts for as much as 14%  of total sodium 
chloride absorption.  In the acute setting following a single dose, SGLT2 inhibitors did 
not increase urine volume .[ADDRESS_394884] not been studied 
in a population with heart failure with or without concomitant hyperglycemia who are 
undergoing diuresis. To our knowledge, no current trials are investigating the effects of 
SGLT2 inhibition in ADHF. The current studies planned in HF are investigating the 
acute effects of SGLT2 o n stable  HF ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), the chronic effects of SGLT2 
inhibition in compensated, chronic  HF ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , changes in pulmonary pressure hemodynamics in patients monitored 
by [CONTACT_320056] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), and effects on cardiopulmonary exercise 
fitness in chronic HF ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ).  
 
Congestion remains the major cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320015]. Therefore, w e propose to test the 
Version 4.0 9-21-2021  12 decongesting effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapa gliflozin  in patients with or without 
Type II diabetes admitted with an acute decompensation of chronic heart failure.  
2.0  Study Outcomes : 
2.1 Primary Outcome  
• The change in weight in kilograms  per 40mg of IV furosemide equivalents  from 
enrollment baseline to day 5 or discharge  (if earlier)  
o Standing weights will be performed by [CONTACT_320057] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320016]). The patient will be requested to empty their bladder and 
bowels if needed prior to each weight assessment.  
o The cumulative loop diuretic dose includes all IV and oral doses 
administered in the study period, converted to IV furosemide equivalents.  
Diuretic conversion: 80mg oral furosemide = 40mg IV furosemide = 20mg 
oral torsemide = 1mg oral/IV bumetanide  
 
This primary outcome investigates the decongestive potential of dapagliflozin by [CONTACT_320058]. Higher diuretic efficiency has been associated with better 
outcomes in multiple AHF populations.13,[ADDRESS_394885] practices of 
initiating dapagliflozin during an AHF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n, setting the stage for continuing it 
into the outpatient setting. T he established benefits of such a strategy would emerg e 
over the coming months to years. In addition to mechanistic and diuretic endpoints, 
additional secondary outcomes are designed to establish the safety across  
hemodynamic , renal,  and glycemic outcomes.

• In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320011]  
• Inpatient mortality  for causality  
 
All criteria and definitions will be pre -specified in detail in the Clinical Events Committee 
Charter . Only outcomes adjudicated as such by [CONTACT_320067]. If there are valid reasons for questioning an adjudication, such as an 
inexplicable outlier during analysis, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_320032] a 
review o f the case. In such situations, the Clinical Events Committee has final 
determination.  
6.[ADDRESS_394894] developed a standardi zed protocol for 
diabetic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_320033] . Participants will be monitored throughout the treatment phase of the study, 
throughout hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and at 30 -day follow -up. Further, an independent DSMB will 
monitor safety of the participants throughout the study.  
 
7.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to 
Participants or Others  
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the 
deterioration of a pre -existing medical condition following or during exposure to a 
Version 4.[ADDRESS_394895]. An 
undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, 
tachycardia,  enlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an investigation (eg, laboratory 
findings,  electrocardiogram). In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable 
medical  condition occurring at any time, including run -in or washout periods, even if no  
 
study treatment has been administered. The term AE is used to include both serious 
and non -serious AEs.  The time period of AE evaluation in this study will start after 
signature [CONTACT_320072] 30 
days after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
 
 
 
7.1 Safety Standards  
The determination of adverse event severity rests on medical judgment of a medically 
qualified investigator. The severity of AEs will be graded using the following definitions:  
• Mild:  awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated;  
• Moderate : discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity and may 
warrant intervention;  
• Severe : incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly affects 
clinical status, and warrants intervention.  
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an adverse event that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  

Version 4.0 9-21-2021  21 • Requires prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186600]  
• Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a 
body structure  
• Requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a 
body function or permanent damage to a body structure  
Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening,  
or prolong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320034].  Example of such medical events include: allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse. Medical and scientific judgment must be exercised when classifying 
event s as serious.  
Serious Adverse Events (SAE) related to dapagliflozin will be categorized as:  
• Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R):  
o unintended response to dapagliflozin , which is not listed in the applicable 
product labeling, and meets the severity definition(s) of a SAE as above  
• Suspected Serious Adverse Reaction (SSAR):  
o unintended response to dapagliflozin , which is listed as a potential 
adverse reaction in the product labeling, and meets the severity 
definition(s) of a SAE as above  
7.2 Adjudication and Reporting of Re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320035] 30 -day follow -up period  
We will evaluate all re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320036] 30 -days from the date of discharge 
from index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320037]. Thirty -day 
rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_320038]. The 
purpose of this is to clarify if the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a study outcome, AE, or both.  
Version 4.0 9-21-2021  22  
*Definitely or possibly related to study drug  = the rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_320039] U.S. marketed 
dapagliflozin package insert  or according to investigator judgement in accordance with  
Section 7.[ADDRESS_394896] study day  and are definitely/possibly 
related to the study drug will be reported as Adverse Events according the procedures 
detailed in protocol Section 7.4. All other rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_320040] 5.4.  
7.[ADDRESS_394897] assess the relationship of any AE to the use of 
study drug, based on available information, using the following guidelines:  
Causality  
Possibly Related  - There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may 
have  been caused by [CONTACT_5257]. The temporal relationship of the adverse 
event to study drug administration makes a causal relationship possible, and 
other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not provide 
sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
Not Possibly Related - It is unlikely that the event was caused by [CONTACT_5257]. 
The temporal relationship of the adverse event to the study drug administration 
makes causal relationship unlikely and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or 
underlying conditions provide a m ore likely explanation for the event.  
Expectedness   

Version 4.0 9-21-2021  23 The expectedness of an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction shall be 
determined according to the package insert for U.S. marketed furosemide and 
dapagliflozin.  Any AE that is not identified in nature, severity, or specificity in the 
current U.S. package insert is considered unexpected. Events described in the 
U.S. package insert as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological proper ties of the drug, but not specifically mentioned as 
occurring with the particular drug und er investigation are considered unexpected.  
 
7.4 Reporting of Adverse Events and SAEs 
All adverse events occurring from signing of the Informed Consent  through the 30 -day 
follow -up period will be collected  and reported . The Site Investigator is responsible for 
monitoring the safety of patients enrolled into the study. The following adverse events 
are anticipated, disease related -events in patients with decompensated heart failure ; 
however , they should still be reported on the Adverse Event form in the REDCAP 
Database (some may require reporting as study endpoints):  
• New Ventricular Arrhythmia : Ventricular tachycardia lasting longer than 30 
seconds, or frequent non -sustained VT causing hemodynamic instability with 
MAP < 60 mmHg requiring intervention or > 1 intra -cardiac defibrillation or 
external cardiac defibrillation shock or ventricular fibri llation requiring defibrillation  
or requiring transfer to the intensive care unit  
• Hypotension : SBP < [ADDRESS_394898] 30 minutes or symptomatic hypotension necessitating clinical 
intervention (defined as vasopressor support, intravenous fluid boluses, or 
initiation of inotropes)  
o Hypovolemic hypotension : subset of “hypotension” requiring fluid 
administration for hypovolemia  
• Cardiac arrest : any ventricular arrhythmic or pulseless electrical event that 
requires immediate life -sustaining medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
• Acute kidney injury  requiring renal replacement therapy : an acute renal failure 
event that began during the study period and necessitates new renal 
replacement therapy  during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157194] a result of the following safety outcomes: 
hypotension requiring medical intervention or hypoglycemia requiring medical 
intervention  
• Diabetic ketoacidosis  as adjudicated by [CONTACT_15741]  
• Death  
 
All serious adverse events must be recorded in the Adverse Event Record of the  
patient’s REDCAP database. All serious adverse events should be monitored until 
stabilization or resolution.  
The process of reporting of SAEs will be as follows:  
Version 4.0 9-21-2021  24 1. The investigator team informs the site investigator of an SAE  
2. The site investigator reports the SAE to the local IRB and to the coordinating 
center and PI  [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of being aware of the event. The site investigator 
will electronically submit the necessary supporting documentation to the 
coordinating site.  
3. The coordinating center and PI  [INVESTIGATOR_320041].  
4. If the coordinating set determines the SAE is a S[LOCATION_003]R, the coordinating site will 
report the S[LOCATION_003]R to the FDA.  
 
Reporting to the Coordinating Site  
All serious adverse events will be reported to the coordinating center (Vanderbilt) by [CONTACT_320068] 24 business hours of being aware of the event.  
Reporting to Local IRB . Investigators are also responsible for promptly reporting 
unexpected adverse events (serious and non -serious) to their reviewing IRB in 
accordance with local requirements. The Vanderbilt investigational site will report DSM B 
reports to the Vanderbilt IRB annually at the time of continuing review at a minimum. 
SAEs will be reported to the local IRB  within [ADDRESS_394899]  
Adverse event reports will be generated and presented to the DSMB at each meeting 
for review. The DSMB will also be alerted to SAEs prior to scheduled meetings if the 
number of individual SAEs in the data safety and monitoring plan are met.   
Reporting to [COMPANY_008]  
The coordinating center will notify [COMPANY_008]  of each SAE . The SAE will be submitted 
as an individual case report. The causality of SAEs (their relationship to all study 
treatments/procedures) will be assessed by [CONTACT_093](s) and communicated to 
[COMPANY_008]. The Investigator is responsible for informing the local authorities (FDA) 
and ethical committees, of any SAEs as per local requirements, and concurrently 
[COMPANY_008]. When reporting to [COMPANY_008], a cover p age will accompany the SAE 
form indicating the following:  
• External Sponsored Research (ESR)  
• The site investigator’s and coordinating center’s name [CONTACT_3816]  
• The trial name/title and [COMPANY_008] ESR reference number  
SAEs will be reported by [CONTACT_8307]’s designated fax line: [PHONE_6693] 
4114 or email if a secure is set up: [EMAIL_661]  
 
7.[ADDRESS_394900] at the end of the study. Non-serious AEs will be presented to the DSMB at 
each interim analysis.  
The following events are examples of potential non-serious suspected adverse 
reactions  unless the seriousness meets criteria for a SAE as defined above .  
•  Incidence of mycotic genital infection, defined as a new symptomatic 
infection requiring treatment  
• Incidence of symptomatic cystitis, defined as new symptoms of dysuria, 
frequency, and/or urgency, plus a urine culture with at least 102 colony 
forming units of a uropathogen requiring treatment with antibiotic therapy  
• Incidence of symptomatic pyelonephritis, defined as new symptoms of 
dysuria, frequency, and/or urgency plus acute flank pain, plus a urine culture 
with at least [ADDRESS_394901] 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. The out come of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth or congenital abnormality) will be followed up and documented even if the patient 
was discontinued from the study. All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy will be 
reported to [COMPANY_008]’s designated fax line: +[PHONE_2704] or email: 
[EMAIL_661]  
 
8.[ADDRESS_394902] and report all access to data. Electronic CRFs (eCRFs) will be 
identified by [CONTACT_34161], to ensure participant anonymity. No participant 
identifie rs will be used in the presentation of data. Study records that might identify 
participants will be kept confidential as required by [CONTACT_2371]. Except when required by [CONTACT_2371], 
participants will not be identified by [CONTACT_2300], personal identification number (e.g. social 
security number, social insurance number), address, telephone number, or any other 
direct personal identifier in study records. Participants will be informed that the study 
physician and his/her study team will report the results of study -related tests to the 
investigators and to the NIH. Participants will be informed that their records may be 
reviewed in order to meet federal, state or regional/local regulations. Reviewers may 
include the study team monitors, IRBs/ECs, the NIH, other government regulators as 
dictated by [CONTACT_1769], or their delegates. Study records will be maintained by [CONTACT_320069] a period of six (6)  years following the expi[INVESTIGATOR_320042], whichever is longer.  
9.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
A patient may withdraw at the study at any  time. The patient will inform the site 
investigator of their desire to withdraw. All study -based therapy will stop at this point, 
and the attending cardiologist will perform any further care. All study data collected to 
that time point will be included in the analysis. The withdrawal reason will be 
documented. All patients will be followed per the study protocol through Day 30.  
 
10.0 Statistical Methods  
The full statistical methods are detailed separately in the Statistical Analysis Plan . 
The primary analysis model will be the semiparametric proportional odds (PO) ordinal 
logistic regression model16 for continuous outcome variables17.  The PO model does not 
make any distributional assumption for the response variable,   is robust to extreme 
values, and is invariant to transformations of the response variable.   It is also extremely 
efficient when compared to linear regression if normali ty holds. The Wilcoxon 
nonparametric two -sample test is a special case of the PO model, but the PO model 
allows for baseline covariate adjustment.    Note that we use covariate adjustment 
instead of change from baseline so as to not assume that (1) the base line variable is 
linearly related to the response variable and (2) the slope of the baseline variable is 1.0.  
 
For binary outcomes we will use the special case of the PO model that is the binary 
logistic regression model.  
 
Version 4.[ADDRESS_394903] -randomization values of these variables.   These continuous analyses w ill also 
provide estimates of incidence of such outcomes as hyper - and hypo -kalemia, but will 
be more sensitive than using only binary responses.

The averag e cumulative median weight loss/40mg furosemide across these trials was 
0.34 (IQR 0. 78, 0.09) kg/40mg . Patients with this diuretic efficiency metric in the lower 
two quartiles had higher incidence of adverse outcomes including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320043] [ADDRESS_394904] been confirmed by [CONTACT_320070]/40mg IV 
furosemide in several other populations. In an AHF population at our medical center, we 
also found a  the weight based diuretic efficiency to be similar, with a mean 0.25 
kg/40mg but a higher standard deviation (0.47 kg/40mg).   
Version 4.[ADDRESS_394905] an increase in diuretic  efficiency by 0.1kg/40mg IV furosemide in the 
dapagliflozin arm to be a  clinically meaningful difference.   We project that our diuretic 
protocol  will decrease variations in loop diuretic dosing, which drive large  standard 
deviations.   We project a normally distributed standard  deviation within each  arm to be 
0.25kg/40mg.   A sample size of [ADDRESS_394906] 87% power to  detect a probability of 0.[ADDRESS_394907] of care arm using a  Wilcoxon (Mann -
Whitney) rank -sum test with a 0.05 two -sided significance  level . 
 
For descriptive statistical analyses of baseline characteristics  we will compute 
proportions for categorical data. Continuous variables will be described by [CONTACT_320071], mean, and Gini's mean difference will be descrbied using sample quantiles.

#Basal insulin regimen  
Glargine once daily - starting daily dose:  
• Patients with BG between 140 -200 mg/dL= 0.2 units per kg weight per day.  
• Patients with BG between 201 -400 mg/dL= 0.25 units per kg weight per day.  
• Glargine insulin will be given once daily, at the same time of the day.  
• Patients will receive the full -dose of glargine insulin (even if NPO) except for 
those that have GFR <50 ml/min.  
• Patients with GFR <50ml/min will receive only one -half of the calculated insulin 
dose  
Supplemental (correction) insulin:  
• Give supplemental insulin lispro following the “ correctional  scale” protocol* for 
elevated blood glucose  
• If a patient is able and expected to eat all, give supplemental lispro insulin after 
each meal and at bedtime following the high dose correctional  scale  
• If a patient is not able to eat, give supplemental lispro insulin every 6 hours (6 -
12-6-12) following the moderate dose correctional  scale  
Daily insulin adjustment:  
• Fasting and pre -meal BG between 100 -140 mg/dl without hypoglycemia the 
previous day: no change  
Version 4.0 9-21-2021  34 • Fasting and pre -meal BG between 141 -180 mg/dl: increase glargine dose by 
10% every day  
• Fasting and pre -meal BG >180 mg/dl: increase glargine dose by 20% every 
day 
• Fasting and pre -meal BG between 70 -99 mg/dl: decrease glargine dose by 
10% every day  
• If a patient develops hypoglycemia (BG <70 mg/dL), decrease glargine dose by 
20%.  
• If a patient develops hypoglycemia (BG <40 mg/dL), decrease glargine dose by 
30-40%.  
Blood glucose monitoring:  
• Measure BG before each meal and at bedtime (or every 6 hours if a patient is 
not eating) using a glucometer.  
 
$Basal and Bolus Meal Coverage Insulin  
Glargine once daily - starting daily dose:  
• Patients with BG between 140 -200 mg/dL= 0.4 units per kg weight per day.  
• Patients with BG between 201 -400 mg/dL= 0.5 units per kg weight per day.  
• Half the total insulin daily dose will be given as glargine and the other half as 
lispro.  
• Glargine insulin will be given once daily, at the same time of the day.  
• Patients will receive the full -dose of glargine insulin (even if NPO) except for 
those that have GFR <50 ml/min.  
• Patients with GFR <50ml/min will receive only one -half of the calculated insulin 
dose  
• Insulin lispro will be given in three equally divided doses after each meal. To 
prevent hypoglycemia, if a subject is not able to eat, the dose of lispro will be 
held. Patients with GFR <50ml/min receive one-half of the calculated insulin 
dose.  
Supplemental (correction) insulin:  
• Give supplemental insulin lispro following the “ correctional  scale” protocol* for 
elevated blood glucose  
• If a patient is able and expected to eat all, give supplemental lispro insulin after

• Fasting and pre -meal BG between 141 -180 mg/dl: increase glargine dose by 
10% every day  
• Fasting and pre -meal BG >180 mg/dl: increase glargine dose by 20% every 
day 
Version 4.0 9-21-2021  35 • Fasting and pre -meal BG between 70 -99 mg/dl: decrease glargine dose by 
10% every day  
• If a patient develops hypoglycemia (BG <70 mg/dL), decrease glargine dose by 
20%.  
• If a patient develops hypoglycemia (BG <40 mg/dL), decrease glargine dose by 
30-40%.  
Blood glucose monitoring:  
• Measure BG before each meal and at bedtime (or every 6 hours if a patient is

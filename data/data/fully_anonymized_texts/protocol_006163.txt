9.0 STUDY  DESIGN  
9.1 Description of Study Design   
This is a multicenter, randomized 2:1, parallel, bilateral, double -masked study at 7 to 
10 inves tigative sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US) comparing the Bausch  + Lomb c ustom 
samfilcon B ( test) lens with the hioxifilcon D, 54% water, Alden Optical® HP Sphere 
(control)  lens. 
Approximately [ADDRESS_1090375] lens  (custom samfilcon B lenses ) and the other one -third  
eligible subjects  will be randomized to receive the control lens  (Alden Optical HP 
Sphere). Both groups will wear their assigned lenses on a daily wear basis throughout the 
study with visits planned for Screening (Visit 1), Dispens ing (Visit 2), 1 Week (Visit 3), 1 
Month (Visit 4), 2 Months (Visit 5), 3 Months (Visit 6) and/or a final Exit Visit.   
Subjects will be randomized  sequentially by [CONTACT_791018]. Subjects will be dispensed product according to their assigned treatment  and 
will remain masked during the entire study period.  
Subjects will be provided with test or control lenses as part of the dispensing package 
along with  instructions for the use and care of the lenses.  
Subjects will be provided with ReNu MultiPlus® Lubricating  and Rewetting  Drops for 
use as needed  during the study.   
Subjects will store their worn study lenses in a lens case filled with Bausch  + Lomb 
Biotrue® multi -purpose solution (MPS).

conduct the study. The Sponsor and IRB must approve any advertising used to recruit 
subjects prior to use of that advertising.  
All consented subjects must be accounted for, whether they participate in the study or 
not. Bausch + Lomb will provide a Screening Log on which to enter information for each 
Study # [ADDRESS_1090377] who signs an Informed Consent Form (ICF).  All screened s ubjects must be 
entered onto the Screening Log, in the order in which they were consented, where they 
will be assigned a sequential subject identification (ID) number. Once a potential subject 
is consented and their initials are entered onto the Screening Log, the Investigator should 
proceed with Screening procedures.  
Potential subjects are deemed either “Screen Pass ” or “Screen Fail. ” “Screen Fail ” 
subjects  are subjects who  have not met the study inclusion criteria or have met the 
exclusion criteria  and ca nnot be randomized into the study .  
“Screen Pass ” subjects have met all of the study inclusion criteria and have not met any 
of the exclusion criteria. Only “Screen Pass ” subjects can be randomized to receive the 
study lenses  and can be assigned a subject identification (ID) number from the 
randomization system . 
Once a subject is randomized, a subject is considered active and must be accounted for at 
every visit until exited (completed or discontinued) from the study, even if they are not 
dispensed study ma terials. Refer to Section 9.2.[ADDRESS_1090378] lens correction from -1.00 diopter (D) to -

10.[ADDRESS_1090390] Accountability Log will be provided to the sites to maintain 
records of the study lenses assigned to each enrolled subjec t. 
At time points throughout the study and/or upon completion of the study, the 
Sponsor/Sponsor's representative will review and verify the Investigator's Product 
Accountability Logs . Following verification, and as directed by [CONTACT_1034], all worn and 
unworn  lenses must be returned to the Clinical Trial Materials  Supply Management at the 
address listed on the Personnel and Facilities page.  
10.7 Masking/Unmasking  
This study is double -masked; therefore, the Investigator/site staff, subjects, and Bausch + 
Lomb perso nnel or designee(s) involved in the collection of study data will be masked to 
the study lenses.  Each site must have an unmasked designee that will be responsible for 
dispensing and accountability.  This designee shall not participate in study assessments 
that may cause bias to the study data.  Study Monitors will become unmasked during site 
visits when they perform product ac countability.  
Lens markings on both products are not product -specific. Markings and lens tints are 
similar between products and  are indistinguishable.  
Randomization will be produced prior to study enrollment by [CONTACT_791025]. An unmasked designee will be responsible for 
dispensing the test and control lenses according to the randomization system . 
Investigators will not have access to the randomization system  information  and lenses 
will be dispensed directly t o the subject, thereby [CONTACT_791026]. In an 
effort to ensure that both the Investigator and subject remain masked, the unmasked 
designee MUST dispense the study lenses and MUST remove lenses from their glass 
vials  out of the Investigator ’s and subject ’s sight immediately prior to dispensing. 
Subjects will not be given additional replacement lenses to take home, thereby 
[CONTACT_26769] # [ADDRESS_1090391] should be retained in -office at 
all times in case a non -scheduled lens replacement is required . If the reserve  is used, an 
immediate replacement order is required . Any additional/repla cement of test or control 
products (in the case of loss or damage) must be ordered through Clinical Trial Materials 
using the Replacement Lens Order Form for Study #886. Do not order through 
Bausch  + Lomb Customer Service . The form can be  scanned to

11.[ADDRESS_1090393] and control lenses.  

Study # [ADDRESS_1090394] to the 
proportion of eyes with any s lit lamp findings Grade >[ADDRESS_1090395], the Investigator (or designee) will explain 
the purpose of the study, procedures, risks/benefits, and subject responsibilities to the 
potential subject. The subject ’s willingness and ability to meet the follow -up 
requirements of the study will be determined. If the subject chooses to participate in the 
investigation, written informed consent will be obtained. The subject and the person 
obtaining written consent will sign and date the IRB -approved ICF. Both the Inve stigator 
and subject must keep the signed ICF document. It is strongly preferred that the signed 
original document be retained in the subject ’s records, while a copy be provided to the 
subject. In addition, the applicable privacy regulation requirements mu st be met.   
12.1.1  Screening Visit (Visit 1)  
NOTE:  All VA measurements MUST be made using a phoropter.  
A Screening Log will be provided by [CONTACT_741974]. Once all available lines on the Screening Log 
have been completed, or the Investigator has fulfilled  his/her  quota of subjects, the 
Investigator will sign and date the form to verify that all the subjects who interviewed for 
the study have provided informed consent  and Health Insurance Portability 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization  and any other applicable state  requirements . 
The Investigator will send a copy of the Screening Log to the Sponsor. The Investigator 
will retain the original document for his/her  records.  
After obtaining written informed consent, prospective subjects will be screened to 
determine whether they meet the entry criteria for the study.  
Screening will proceed as follows:  
a. Enter the subject information on the next available line of the Scre ening Log.  
b. Collect subject ’s medical history  
c. Collect the following lens history information from the subject:  
‒ Average number of days per week worn  
‒ Average daily wearing time , hours per day   
‒ Average hours of comfortable wear  per day

13.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
13.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
For the purposes of this study, AEs includ e ocular AEs in the study eye(s) , all ocular and 
non-ocular serious adverse events (SAEs) , adverse device effects (ADEs) , and 
unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs). AEs, SAEs, ADEs , and UADEs are 
defined as follows : 
13.1.1  Adverse Events  
An adverse event  (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, 
or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in a subject, user, or 
other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device. This defini tion 
includes events related to the investigational medical device, comparator, or the 
procedures involved. For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events 
related to investigational medical devices.  
Throughout the course of this study,  all efforts will be made to remain alert to possible 
AEs. The term “AEs” includes both SAEs and significant non-serious A E. Each are 
defined below.  
If an AE occurs, the first concern will be the safety of the subject and appropriate medical 
intervention w ill be made. All AEs ( SAEs and significant non -serious AEs) that occur 
will be reported in this study.  
AEs should be differentiated into device related and non -device related. Any corneal 
infiltrate, ulcer, neovascularization, etc. shall be presumed to be device related, in the 
absence of an alternative explanation.  
All AEs occurring after signing of informed consent and through the subject ’s end of 
participation in the study must be reported. All AEs must be followed until the event 
resolves or stabilizes.  
All AEs should be photo documented and communicated to the CRO and Sponsor in 
electronic form.  
13.1.[ADDRESS_1090408] (ADE)  is an AE related to the use of an investigational medical 
device. This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions 
Study # 886 Protocol  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Version  3.0, January 2 5, 2019   Page 26 of 69    for use; deployment, implantation, installation, or operation; or any malfunction of the 
investigational med ical device. This definition also includes any event resulting from use 
error or from intentional misuse of the  investigational medical device.  
13.1.[ADDRESS_1090409] (ASADE) is a serious  adve rse device effect 
which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome has been previously identified in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application)  and/or 
in the risk analysis report. A SADE s may include but are not limited to:   
• Corneal ulcer (infectious or non -infectious)  
• Keratitis  
• Sensitivity to light (photophobia)  
• Excessive eye secretions including mucopurulent discharge  
• Blurred vision, rainbows or halos around obj ects 
• Poor visual acuity (reduced sharpness of vision)  
• Moderate to severe eye pain not relieved by [CONTACT_288830]  
13.1.[ADDRESS_1090410]  (UADE)  is any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if 
that effect, problem or death was not previously identified in nature, severity or degree of 
incidence in the investigationa l plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that 
relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
13.1.5  Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
• Serious adverse event is an AE that:  
o Led to death;  
o Led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that resulted in:  
‒ A life-threatening illness or injury; or  
‒ A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function 
(eg, blindness); or  
‒ Inpatient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or  
‒ Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness 
or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body 
function;  
o Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth 
defect.  
NOTE:  Plann ed hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition, or a procedure required by 
[CONTACT_760], without serious deterioration in health, is not considered an SAE.  
Serious adverse events are those events that result in, or have potential to cause, either 
permanen t impairment of an ocular function or damage to an ocular structure and may 
necessitate medical or surgical intervention.  
Study # [ADDRESS_1090411] article, including  the following:  
• A presumed infectious ulcer (defined as a progressive erosion of the corneal 
tissue). For the purposes of reporting , this includes : 
o Central or para -central location;  
o Penetration of Bowman’s membrane;  
o Infiltrate ≥ 2 mm diameter;  
o Associated w ith iritis Grade ≥2;  
o Associated with any increase in intraocular pressure;  
o Culture positive for microorganisms;  
o Increasing size or severity at subsequent visits;  
Note: Signs of a presumed infectious corneal ulcer may include irregular focal infiltrates, 
active lesions with raised edges, significant diffuse infiltration, anterior corneal to 
mid-stromal involvement, erosion with overlying staining, conjunctival and lid 
edema, anterior chamber reaction (iritis), and severe bulbar and limbal redness. 
Symptoms associated with a presumed infectious ulcer (microbial keratitis) may 
include pain of rapid onset, severe redness, purulent or mucopurulent discharge, 
tearing, and photophobia.  
• Any central or paracentral (within 6 mm of cornea) corneal event that results i n 
permanent opacification (such as vascularization);  
• Any serious adverse ophthalmic events including hypopyon and hyphema;  
• Any neovascularization within the central 6 mm of the cornea;  
• Permanent loss of ≥2 lines of BSCV A;  
• All cases of iritis.  
13.1.6  Significant Non -Serious Adverse Events  
Significant non-serious A Es should include : 
• Peripheral non -progressive non -infectious corneal ulcers;  
• All symptomatic corneal infiltrative events;  
• All cases of corneal staining Grade ≥3; 
• A temporary loss of ≥2 lines of BSCVA (for ≥2 weeks);  
• Neovascularization cases Grade ≥2. 
Any ocular event that necessitates temporary lens discontinuation of ≥2 weeks  
13.1.7  Non-Significant Non -Serious Adverse Events  
Non-significant non-serious A Es may include but are not limited to:           
• Bacterial conjunctivitis;

13.[ADDRESS_1090412] of care.  
For purposes of this study, the Sponsor requests that cultures should be obtained in cases 
of corneal ulcer or suspected ocular infection, unless medically contraindicated. Cultures 
should be taken from the cul -de-sac, lower eyelid margin, and the corneal lesion (if 
applicable). The culturing techniques are outlined in APPENDIX F . 
When a culture is obtained, the contact [CONTACT_791029]. 
Microbial data generated from returned subject supplies (eg, lenses, lens cases , and/or 
lens case solutions) are for information on ly. Because microbes may be introduced into 
subject supplies during use, recovery of microbes from returned subject supplies cannot 
be presumed to indicate etiology or direction of organism transmission.  
The ocular cultures, along with the associated conta ct lenses and contact [CONTACT_791030], will 
be sent to the clinical laboratory designated by [CONTACT_240377]. The clinical 
laboratory will report the culture results to both the Investigator and to the Sponsor.  
13.2.[ADDRESS_1090413] requires medical treatment (prescription medication) for an 
ocular condition, treat the subject as appropriate to prevent further complications and to  
potentially resolve the event.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_1090414] determine if the event is serious (refer to 
Section 13.1.5  for criteria)  and assess the severity of symptoms  and the relationship of the 
event to the study device using the following guidelines:  
13.3.1  Severity  
• Mild:  Subject awareness of a sign or symptom that is easily tolerated, requires no 
treatment, and does not interfere with subject ’s daily activities.  
• Moderate:  Subject awareness of a sign or symptom which may be a low level of 
concern to the subject and may interfere with daily activities but can be relieved 
by [CONTACT_119106].  
• Severe:  A sign or symptom that interrupts the subject ’s daily activity and req uires 
systemic therapy or other treatment.  
Study # 886 Protocol  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Version  3.0, January 2 5, 2019   Page 29 of 69    13.3.2  Relationship to  Study Device and/or Rewetting Drops 
• Related: There is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to 
the study device and/or Rewetting Drops . Reasonable possibility means that there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relationship or association between the study 
device and/or Rewetting Drops and the AE. Also referred to as an ADE.  
• Unrelated:  There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE /SAE is related 
to the study device and/or Rewetting Drops. This assessment implies that the 
AE/SAE has no evidence to suggest either a causal relationship or association to 
the study device and/or Rewetting Drops and a more likely or certain alternative 
etiology exists.  
13.4 Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse Events , Unanticipated Adverse 
Device Events, and Significant Non -Serious Adverse Events  
Events classified as SAE/UADE  or significant non -serious AEs require expeditious 
handling and reporting to the Sponsor or designee to comply with regulatory 
requirements , as follows:  
• Must be immediately reported to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event using the Sponsor -provided form (SAE/UDE reporting 
form) by [CONTACT_791031] . The 
Medical Monitor will email a copy of the form to: 
; 
 upon receipt. The Medical Monitor will email/fax 
a copy of the form immediately (within 24 hours) for SAEs only  to 
upon receipt.  
• Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document 
the event before notifying the medical monitor and Sponsor/ designee of a n 
SAE/UADE /significant non -serious AE . If only limited information is initially 
available, follow -up reports are required. Additional relevant information such as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_791014]/designee 
as soon as th ey are available.  
• The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the 
subjects: notably, he/she should follow a subject with an SAE/UADE /significant 
non-serious AEs  until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized . This 
may imply that follow -up will continue after the subject has left the study, and 
that additional evaluations may be requested by [CONTACT_1034].  
In the case of an AE (serious and significant non -serious) or medical treatment (non -AE), 
the Investigator must:  
• Report the AE or medical treatment to the Medical Monitor and Sponsor/ designee 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event using the Sponsor -provided form 
(SAE/UADE Report Form) by [CONTACT_791032] S ponsor/ designee.  
• Indicate on the Initial SAE/UADE Report Form whether the SAE/UADE is 
presumed to be not study  related, lens  related, solution  related, or both 
lens/solution related.  

Study # 886 Protocol  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Version  3.0, January 2 5, 2019   Page 30 of 69    • Ensure that the subject's identity is protected and the subject's identif iers in the 
clinical trial are properly mentioned on the form.  
• BEGIN TREATMENT OF THE AE IMMEDIATELY BY A SUITABLY 
LICENSED EYE CARE PROFESSIONAL.  
• Enter the SAE/UADE /significant non -serious AE  into the eCRF within 3 business 
days of submitting the Initial SAE/UADE Report Form.  
• Continue to update the eCRF, if applicable, each time the subject is seen during 
the management of the incident and at resolution of the incident. Whenever 
possible, it is suggested that the Investigator take photographs of all AEs and 
forward them to the Sponsor.  
• Cases requiring medical treatment will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1034]. Upon review 
of the medical treatment, Bausch + Lomb Clinical Operations represe ntatives may 
contact [CONTACT_741979].  
• Submit all bills, prescription receipts, and culture reports/fees related to the AE to 
Bausch + Lomb Clinical Operations.  Expenses incurred for study -related med ical 
treatment will be paid by [CONTACT_59268]  + Lomb Clinical Operations.

Study # [ADDRESS_1090419] logMAR lens V A will be averaged over all scheduled 
visits as the primary endpoint. A non -inferiority upper bound of 0.06 (3 letters) will be 
used to assess the difference ( test – control) in mean logMAR lens V A. 
14.1.[ADDRESS_1090420] to the 
proportion of eyes with any slit lamp findings Grade >[ADDRESS_1090421] and control lenses. A non -inferiority upper bound of 0. 10 will be used to as sess 
the difference ( test – control) in proportions of slit lamp outcomes.  
14.2 Hypotheses  
14.2.1  Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  
The null hypothesis ( H0) for the primary effectiveness endpoint is that the difference 
between the test mean (μT) and the control mean (μC) in distance high-contrast logMAR 
lens V A averaged over all scheduled visits is ≥0.06. The alternative hypothesis  (H1) is 
that the difference is <0.06.  
𝐻0: 𝜇𝑇−𝜇𝐶≥0.06 
𝐻1: 𝜇𝑇−𝜇𝐶<0.06 
14.3 Primary Safety Endpoint  
The null hypothesis ( H0) for the primary effectiveness endpoint is that the difference 
between the test (πT) and the control (πC) in the proportion of eyes with any slit lamp 
findings Grade >2 at any follow -up visit is ≥0.10. The alternative hypothesis (H 1) is that 
the difference is <0.10.  
𝐻0: 𝜋𝑇−𝜋𝐶≥0.10 
𝐻1: 𝜋𝑇−𝜋𝐶<0.10 
14.4 Sample Size  
Sample size calculation  inputs (eg , standard deviations  [SDs]  and expected percentages)  
were estimated  based on the results of a previous clinical trial evaluating the test lens.[ADDRESS_1090422] 99% power to reject the null hypothesis that the test lens is inferior to the

Version  3.0, January 2 5, 2019   Page 34 of 69    control  lens (the difference in means, T - C, is ≥0.060) in favor of the alternative 
hypothesis that the test lens is non -inferior to the control lens , assuming that the expected 
difference in means is 0.[ADDRESS_1090423] group, the upper limit of the 
observed 1-sided 95% confidence interval wil l be expected to be <0.100 with 99% power 
when the control  proportion, C, is 0.[ADDRESS_1090424] expected proportion, T, is 0.012; 
results are based on [ADDRESS_1090425] the confidence interval.2 
14.4.3  Overall Power and Sample Size  
Assuming independence of the primary endpoints, t he overall power of the study to show 
non-inferiority for both endpoints is 9 8%. Accounting for up to 10% losses , 
approximately  168 eyes ( 84 subjects) should  be enrolled . 
14.5 Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms in a 2:1 ratio  (test:control) , wearing 
either test or control lenses in both eyes for the duration of the study. Randomization will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_76537].   
Subjects will be randomized , after they are  deemed eligible to participate, according to 
subject -specific randomization information  provid ed by [CONTACT_240358] .  
14.6 Study Populations  
14.6.1  Intent -to-Treat Population  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) p opulation will consist of all randomized eyes.  Eyes will be 
included in treatment groups according to the treatments to which they were randomized 
for ITT population summaries.  
14.6.2  Per-Protocol Population  
The per-protocol (PP) p opulation will consist of all randomized eyes without the 
following important protocol deviations : 
• Ineligible when randomized  
• Not dispensed study lenses  
• Use of an incorrect lens type (eg , due to improper randomization , erroneous 
dispensing, return to habitual lens brand, etc. ) 
• Use of a lens care system other than the lens care system dispensed  
• Failure to wear the assigned lenses at least 80% of the expected days  
• Failure to provide non-missing  distance high-contrast logMAR lens V A data at all 
of the scheduled visits  (Dispensing  Visit and  1-Week, 1 -Month, 2 -Month, and 3 -
Month  Visits )

14.7 Statistical Analysis  
A full declaration of planned statistical analyses will be documented in a formal statistical 
analysis plan (SAP). Any dev iations from the SAP will be documented in the final study 
report.  
14.7.[ADDRESS_1090427] deviations will be presented with 2 more 
decimal places than the recorded raw data. Minima and maxima will be presented with 
the same number of decimal places as the recorded raw data. Values with magnitude <1 
will be presented with a leading zero to the left of the decim al (eg, 0.123 or 0.123).  
Categorical data will be summarized using frequencies and percentages. Percentages will 
be presented with [ADDRESS_1090428] logMAR lens VA will be assessed at each scheduled 
visit ( Dispensing  Visit and  1-Week , 1-Month, 2 -Month, and 3-Month  Visits ). VA will be 
converted to logMAR units. For each eye, l ogMAR V A will be averaged over all 
scheduled visits  resulting in 1 value of “All Study ” logMAR lens V A per eye . 
“All Study ” logMAR lens V A will be presented using  continuous summary statistics for 
the P P population by [CONTACT_121610] a table at the eye level. A 2-sided 9 0% 
confidence interval for the difference ( test – control) in “All Study ” logMAR  lens V A will 
be constructed using an analysis of variance ( ANOV A) model with fixed factors of 
treatment and site.  If the upper limit of the confidence interval is ≤0.[ADDRESS_1090429] lens will be statistically successful in this 
outcome.  
The previous analysis will also be completed using the ITT Population  as a sensitivity 
analysis . For this sensitivity analysis, missing logMAR V A values will be imputed 25

PP population) by [CONTACT_791034] a 2-sided 90% confidence 
interval for the difference between treatments.  
 Primary Safety Analysis  
Graded slit lamp findings will be assessed at each scheduled follow -up visit (1 -Week, 1 -
Month, 2 -Month, and 3-Month  Visits ) and, optionally, at unscheduled visits. Each eye 
will be classified with respect to having 1 or more observation s with Grade >2 (Yes, No)  
at any follow -up visit, including unscheduled  visits . 
The number and percentage of eyes with findings Grade >2 at any follow -up visit will be 
presented for the safety population by [CONTACT_121610] a table. A 2-sided 90% 
confidence interval for the difference ( test – control) between treatment grou ps will be 
constructed using the Newcombe -Wilson score method. If the upper confidence limit 
≤10% (0.10)  then the null hypothesis will be rejected and the test lens will be statistically 
successful in this outcome.  If both treatment groups have 0 eyes with  a slit lamp finding 
Grade >2, then the confidence interval will not be calculable, the null hypothesis will be 
rejected, and the test lens will be statistically successful in this outcome.   
14.7.2  Multiple Comparisons  
Adjustment for multiple comparisons will not be necessary because statistical success 
will require success in both primary endpoints.  
14.7.3  Interim Analyses  
No interim analyses are planned.  
14.7.4  Missing Data   
Missing data will be imputed for the ITT population sensitivity analysis of the pr imary 
effectiveness endpoint as described above. Unless otherwise specified, m issing data will 
not be imputed .

 Both active and sham (placebo) interventions will be administered sequentially to the left and right dorso -lateral prefrontal cortex. The total time of stimulation or sham is less than 7 minutes. Active  
or sham intervention will be ad ministered for 6 weeks ( Monday to Friday).  A total of 20 subjects 
will ben randomized.  Changes in mood from baseline to the end of 6 weeks will be measured 
using The Montgomery -Asberg Depression scale. Executive function at baseline and end of study 
will be evaluated with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox executive domain battery. 
Safety assessments will include: The 21 item Scale for suicidal ideation SSI. The frequency, 
intensity and burden of side effects rating ( FIBSER) and the Altman Self Rating Mania scale ( 
ASRM). Ancillary depression measures include the The self-reported Quick Inventory of 
Depressive Symptoms ( QIDS) and the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement scale.  
 Subjects will undergo functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) before and after the study interventions to tests the effects of iTBS vs. placebo on brain’s functional  connectivity.

B Background 
 
B1 Prior Literat ure and Studies  
 
Late Life depression is associated with executive impairment:   
 
Major depression epi[INVESTIGATOR_729829], known as Late Life Depression (LLD), are frequently associated with executive impairment. Executive functions are 
specialized cognitive processes integral to social and occupational success and overall 
quality of life. These functions involve planning, goal -directed activity, impulse inhibition 
and capacity for change and adaptation. Three main executive domains have been consistently described: 1. Inhibitory control; 2. working memory; and 3. cognitive flexibility.4 Brain regions within the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC), particularly the Dorso-
Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) have been proposed to orchestrate executive 
control.[ADDRESS_996870] shown recruitment of PFC regions when subjects perform tasks related to executive domains. Meta-analytic evidence supports the key involvement of a superordinate Cognitive Control Network (CCN)  involving 
fronto-parietal brain regions including the DLPFC (Brodmann Area 9, 46), anterior 
cingulate (Brodmann Area 32) inferior (Brodmann Areas 39, 40) and superior (Brodmann 
Area 7) parietal lobe and pre-cuneus (Brodmann Area 19) subsuming executive function. The CCN is involved in “top-down” control and executive tasks. Besides, dysfunction of this network may be responsible for deficits in attention, working memory and slowed processing speed in LLD.   
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 [ADDRESS_996871] characterized 
executive deficits, shown volume reduction and white matter tracks ischemic changes in 
frontal and limbic brain regions and more recently connectivity changes in key cortical networks including the Cognitive Control Network (CCN) and the Default Mode Network. The resultant LLD with co-occurring executive function deficits has devastating consequences including a protracted and treatment-resistant depression course, poor quality of life and increased risk for suicide. No optimal treatments exist for this problem. 
Selective serotonin reuptake antidepressants do not improve executive impairments and 
psychotherapy is less helpful with co- occur ring executive deficits. Therefore, an effective 
and well -tolerated treatment is needed to improve executive function, depression burden 
and overall quality of life.   
Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) enhances neuroplasticity:  
TBS is a highly efficient form of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). TMS is a standard FDA approved treatment for depression. In TBS, magnetic stimuli are delivered in “bursts” of 3 stimuli at 50 Hz (i.e. 20 ms between each stimulus) given every 200 milliseconds (i.e. 5 Hz). This pattern of stimulation has been used to probe synaptic efficiency of the motor cortex using in vivo slice preparations of animal tissue, but has 
been adapted for stimulation of the human brain using magnetic stimulators and has 
shown to induce faster effects on synaptic plasticity than conventional TMS. The excitability of the corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_729830] (iTBS) and continuous (cTBS). Although they both induce a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory effects, it is generally accepted that iTBS induces facilitation of the motor -evoked response indicating predominant 
excitatory, long-term potentiation (LTP) effects and cTBS decreases the motor evoked response indicating predominantly inhibitory, Long-Term Depression (LTD) effects. Both LTP and LTD mechanisms are triggered by [CONTACT_729864]+ to the post- synaptic neuron. 
Since iTBS increases LTP indicating enhancement of the brain’s plasticity, it is conceivable that iTBS may lead to increase synaptic efficiency and connectivity in key 
brain networks.  
 
Rationale for the use of iTBS to relieve depression and executive 
impairment in older adults:

 [ADDRESS_996875] the effects of iTBS on brain function using resting state 
functional connectivity measures:  
Resting State Functional Connectivity (rsFC) has allowed a further understanding of 
brain systems in relationship to depression. rsFC is based on the principle that 
functionally related brain regions exhibit correlated activity in intrinsic very low frequency (<~ 0.1 Hz) Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) s ignal.
34-[ADDRESS_996876] measure of spontaneous neural activity.34,37,38 
This approach proposes canonical resting state networks defined as neural systems exhibiting intrinsic brain activity which is temporarily correlated with widely distributed 
brain regions
39-41. Networks relevant to LLD include the Cognitive Control Network 
(CCN) a fronto-parietal circuit involved in top down attention dependent executive 
control, the Default Mode network (DMN) which is involved in self-referential processes, 
and the affective fronto-limbic circuits, involved in emotion regulation.[ADDRESS_996877] of this proposal given its control of executive function.  This 
network involves fronto-parietal regions including the DLPFC (Bas 9,46), anterior 
cingulate (BA 32) inferior (BAs 39, 40) and superior (BA 7) parietal lobe and pre-cuneus 
(BA 19) subserving executive function43. Multiple lines of evidence indicate an 
association between altered CCN function and executive impairment in depression: 1) 
Dysfunction of CCN regions has been linked to executive impairment in depression42,44,45 
2) Cognitive regulation of emotions is deficient in depression46,47 3) Middle aged and 
older adults with depression exhibited low rsfMRI connectivity within the CCN48,49; which 
was linked to dysexecutive behavior and antidepressant resistance48 4) A pattern of 
decreased activity in the DLPFC during cognitive tasks and decreased connectivity between the DLPFC and the Dorsal Anterior Cingulate
14 has been found in depression.  
 
In summary, LLD with executive dysfunction is associated with poor outcomes. Such a “malignant” depression variant appears to be the end result of aberrant connectivity in the CCN. iTBS is a novel kind of magnetic stimulation treatment, which offers the 
potential to improve mood and executive function by [CONTACT_729865]. This intervention has the potential to provide an effective treatment approach for LLD with executive dysfunction and the study will compare the effects of this intervention 
against sham (placebo).

Aim 3 . To examine the association between change in clinical symptoms and neurocognitive 
assessments and changes on brain connectivity within the CCN.  H 3 Among older adults who 
receive iTBS, changes in connectivity within the CCN will correlate with changes in depression 
and executive function.  
 
C3 Rationale for the Selection of Outcome Measures  
 
Depression Measure:  
The Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale, is a standardized mood rating scale, 
widely used in depression studies.  The scale is particularly sensitive to treatment 
effects, demonstrating greater sensitivity to change (between responders and non-responders) to antidepressant treatment than other scales such as the Hamilton  
Depression Rating Scale.  
 Executive function measures:  
The flanker inhibitory control, the Dimensional Change Card sort test and the List Sorting 
Working memory test will measure executive function.  These scales are state of the art 
scales  and are recommended by [CONTACT_729866].  
NIH Toolbox measures are brief and standardized for assess ing function from ages 3 to 
85.  The NIH toolbox monitors behavioral function over time and across developmental 
stages. This makes it possible to study changes across the lifespan, and evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment.   
 
Brain’s connectivity measure: Resting State Functional Connectivity (rsFC) is based on 
the principle that functionally related brain regions exhibit correlated activity in intrinsic 
very low frequency (<~ 0.1 Hz) Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal. Such 
low-frequency BOLD fluctuations constitute an indirect measure of spontaneous neural 
activity. This approach has identified canonical resting state networks, defined as neural 
systems exhibiting intrinsic brain activity which is temporarily correlated with widely 
distributed brain regions. Using resting state fMRI we will measure functional 
connectivity within the Cognitive Control Network (CCN) in depressed older adults  
before and after study intervention. We will also explore functional connectivity within and between other networks that are relevant to depression including the Default Mode 
network  and the cingulo-opercular networks.

2.c Subject Recruitment Plans and Consent Process 
Depression is common in older adults: up to 15% of older adults experience a major  
depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. We will recruit Community -dwelling older adults with depression via 
advertisement as well as referring care providers. The Clinical Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation service directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cristancho as well as [CONTACT_155371]’s outpatient geriatric 
practice at Washington University will also provide recruitment sources. Recruitment 
strategies for subjects will involve the use of IRB approved advertisements, in the print, advertisement via electronic media such as facebook, referrals by [CONTACT_6063], 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 [ADDRESS_996883] provided ongoing access to older  adults 
with depression.  
 
Consent process:  
The Pi [INVESTIGATOR_729834]'s verbal consent prior to doing a phone screen to determine study eligibility. After completion of the phone screen if the subject is 
determined eligible, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_729835]. The subject will be told that study 
participation is optional and it will not affect their care. Per subject’s request a copy of 
the consent form will be mailed, faxed or e-mailed to the subject, so he/she has time prior to his/her visit to review and discuss with family/friends. A screening visit will be 
scheduled.  
 
During the screening visit the PI [INVESTIGATOR_729836], page by [CONTACT_729868]. The subject will be told that study participation is optional and it will not affect their care. If 
subject agrees, his/ her signature [CONTACT_729885] [INVESTIGATOR_729837].   A note to file will be used to document the consent process.  
 
2.d Randomization Method and Blinding:  
Subjects who consent to study participation will be randomized to receive six  weeks of 
either iTBS or sham. Each subject enrolled in the study will have equal probability to be 
randomized in each study arm and permuted blocks of randomly varying sizes (4, 6, and 
8) will be used to generate the scheme. Each block will contain equal numbers of 
assignments to iTBS and sham providing a balanced design. Neuropsychological 
testing, mood assessments and fMRI scans will be performed pre- and post-
interventions. 
 
Blinding:  To deliver the stimulation we will use One treatment coil (B-65 A/P) capable of 
delivering iTBS and sham.  Subjects randomized to iTBS will receive iTBS and those 
randomized to sham will receive sham (placebo) s timulation.  Sham stimulation is 
ensured by [CONTACT_729869], which reduces the 
magnetic field strength to < 5% of active field which is biologically inactive.  The c oil’s 
symmetric design and identical clicking noises during both active and sham. The coil has 
a built-in position sensor to ensure that the correct (active or sham) side of the coil faces 
toward the subject’s head.  We will use synchronized gentle electrical stimulation to the 
scalp via pre-gelled surface stimulation electrodes to simulate scalp sensations on the 
sham delivery, which will mimic the active stimulation. Subject’s assignment to the intervention will be defined by [CONTACT_729870].  Assignments are stor ed on individualized USB memory devices . 
 At intervention end, subjects will be queried about what they believed was their 
intervention assignment.
 
 
 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 [ADDRESS_996884] delivery is assessed based on the risk associated with TMS therapy  
(FDA approved treatment for depression) and based on published clinical trials using 
TBS intervention.  
 Risk of common side effects: Most frequent side effects included headaches, dizziness, nausea, vertigo, pressure in the head, twitching in superficial muscles of the face while 
receiving stimulation, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_729838]. These have been reported to be mild and 
moderate tolerability.  
Stimulation may affect hearing due to the loud sound of the magnetic stimulator. As in clinical practice subjects are required to wear earplugs throughout the entire session.  
 Risk of serious side effects: Seizure during stimulation is a potential risk. No seizures 
have been reported in TBS literature in depression studies. The largest reported 
naturalistic study (N = 87) estimated an incidence rate range of seizure or other serious adverse effects at 0.011 per patient (95% CI, 0-0.362). We will comply with the 
International Safety guidelines for TMS administration, and we have a written protocol to handle seizures at the TMS suite.  
 
Intervention emergent mania or hypomania: This is a theoretical concern, as such as 
reaction has not been reported with iTBS. The rTMS literature estimates the risk for intervention emergent mania or hypomania at 0.84% but this was not statistically 
different from sham 0.73%.   
Risk of mood worsening: Due to the clinical course of depressive illness it is concei vable 
that subject’s assigned to either iTBS or sham may experience worsening of mood 
during their participation in the trial. 
 
Suicide risk: Patients who are identified, as being acutely suicidal will be excluded from 
the study. Nevertheless, since the rate of completed suicide in the [LOCATION_003] remains high 
(i.e., about twice the rate of homicide) and most Americans who commit suicide suffer from depression, all subjects eligible to participate in this study are statistically at a relatively higher risk for suicide than the general population. Participation in the study does not create or increase the risk of completed suicide. Actually, most experts believe that one of the most efficient ways to decrease suicidal risk in older depressed 
individuals is to treat their depression. A Recent study by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_729839].   Breach of confidentiality: this is a potential risk of clinical research due to the need to 
inquire about health related information. 
 For protections against risk see letter F subheading, below.  
 Risks associated with MRI 
 
Likely risks : During scan and behavioral task procedures, patients may experience 
boredom or get tired.  
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 13  
Less likely risks:  Because patients are asked to lie still during the scan they may 
experience mild muscle aches and pains. Participants are offered cushions to plac e at 
pressure points or beneath the knees to reduce discomfort. Participants will be exposed 
to the MRI scanner acoustic noise. They will be provided with earplugs to dampen the noise. Participants may feel anxious or even experience claustrophobia (fear of being in 
closed spaces) while in the scan. Participants are able to communicate with staff 
throughout the scan and are encouraged to tell the staff if they feel anxious and whether they want to interrupt or stop the scan.  
 
Rare risks:  Because the scanner uses a high strength magnet, subjects with ferro-
magnetic metallic objects inside their bodies are at substantial risk. Metallic objects can be pulled by [CONTACT_729871]. The following medical devices and body implants can be affected by [CONTACT_729872]: cardiac pacemaker, implanted cardioverted defibrillator (ICD), aneurysm clip, implanted insulin/drug pump, neurostimulator (TENS unit), 
biostimulator/bone growth stimulator, hearing aid/cochlear implant, Gianturco coil 
(embolus coil), vascular clip, surgical clip or staples, heart valve prosthesis, Greenfield Vena Cava filter, middle ear implant, penile prosthesis, shrapnel or bullets, wire sutures, tattooed eye liner, body pi[INVESTIGATOR_55443], permanent contraceptive implants such as diaphragm/ UID and pessaries, intraventricular shunts, wire mesh, artificial limb or joint, any orthopedic item that is ferro-conductive (ei, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115], rods, screws, nails, clips, plates, 
wire etc) dentures, any type of dental item held in place by a magnet, dental braces or 
any type of removable dental item, any other implanted item not mentioned. There may be unknown risks to the unborn fetus during pregnancy. Prior to the MRI, each subject will be carefully  screened for the presence of any of these devices or implants.  
 
Benefits of study participation: Benefits to subjects include the possibility that their 
depression improves with this intervention. There are theoretical grounds and other research evidence indicating that TBS has potential beneficial effects on depression and executive dysfunction. The side effect profile for TBS is predicated on the side effect profile of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). TMS was cleared as a depression treatment by [CONTACT_34033] 2008.  According to [CONTACT_729886][INVESTIGATOR_729840]’s 
clinical experience (Director of the TMS clinic at Washington University), patients often seek alternative treatments to medications, because medications have the potential for systemic side effects. TMS is generally an amenable treatment to patients. 
 
Benefits to society:  Depression in older adults with co-existing executive function 
impairment has devastating consequences including a protracted and treatm ent 
resistant depression course, poor quality of life and increased risk for suicide.  Testing TBS intervention will inform research in this area of significant public health relevance.  
  
2.f E arly Withdrawal of Subjects  
 
Subjects can terminate their participation at any time.  Subjects will be terminated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_729841] a new event that will compromise their safety to receive the study intervention.  For example, subject becomes sick and 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 14 her/his  new condition precl udes the use of the study intervention.  Or, subject 
experiences a seizure during the intervention administration;  this will preclude further 
study intervention sessions. Subjects can be withdrawn due to other medical or 
psychiatric events that in the judgment of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_729842]’s safety to 
receive iTBS.  
 
In addition, subjects may be terminated due to missing sessions.  More than four  
consecutive missed sessions will cause withdrawal from study. Missed sessi ons will 
have to be made up, in this way the subject will still receive the entire 20 -30 
interventions , but over a longer time period (i.e. greater than 4-6 weeks). Missing more 
than six non-consecutive sessions ( 20% of the intervention), which cannot be made up 
will also lead to study withdrawal .  
 
  All missed intervention days will be recorded in a log for each participant. 
 
2.g When  and How to Withdraw Subjects  
 
Subjects can withdraw their consent to participate at any time.  Subjects should inform 
the study team about their wish to withdraw or sent a withdrawal letter.  
 
Subject’s termination from study by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_729843].   
2.h Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn S ubjects  
 
All data collected from subjects up to their withdrawal date will be used for analysis.   If a subject decides to withdraw, we will ask him/ her to come for a close out visit to  
complete the same mood and executive function assessments that were recorded at  
baseline.  
 
D3 Study Device:  rTMS device  
 
3.a Description of the rTMS device used to deliver iTBS vs sham 
(placebo )  
 
We will use the rTMS device currently available at our institution for clinical and research applications.  The stimulator is a MagPro R 30 magnetic stimulator manufactured by 
[CONTACT_351253] A/S (Farum, Denmark) and FDA approved for treatment of major 
depressive disorder.  Equipment components include: 1) R30 magnetic stimulator 2 ) coil 
cooler unit 3) dedicated C -B60 butterfly coil for Motor threshold assessments only 4 ) 
Treatment chair with neck rest and cloth cover, subjects will recline in this comfo rtable 
motorized recliner during intervention delivery  5) Head Stabilizer System (Airtight Pi[INVESTIGATOR_729844]).  
 
The intervention will be delivered using: 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 15 • A Coil- cool B65 A/P butterfly coil. This coil functions as both active and sham 
coil. The coil has a symmetrical design, one side of the coil delivers active 
treatment and the other side delivers sham. Both sides of the coil are identical.  
• Theta burst delivery software 
Maglink software, this software interfaces with the B65 A/P coil to deliver the 
randomization assignment.  The software provides codes assignments according 
to the randomization schedule to ensure double -blind conditions  
 
The Magpro R30 is a non-significant risk device because:   - It is not an implant  
- It is not for use in supporting or sustaining human life  
- It does not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of study 
 3b. Other devices used:  
 
MRI guided neuronavigation equipment:  This  frameless stereotactic system 
(Brainsight; Rogue Research, Quebec, Canada), co-registers the patient's head in a 
standardized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) space. The equipment allows for accurate coil targeting of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex within and between Theta Burst stimulation sessions.  The equipment is located at the Laboratory for Applied Brain 
Plasticity (LABP), which is also equipped with a Magstim Super Rapid and a  Magstim 
BiStim² (The Magstim Company Ltd, Wales, [LOCATION_006]) and various coi l types for brain 
stimulation (TMS).   
 
 
3T Prisma MRI Scanners  
The newest-generation fMRI scanner from Siemens, the Prisma 3T Magnet Resonance 
Imaging Scanner, will be used for this project.  Washington University (WU) has 
Prisma Fit at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology (MIR), operational since October 
2015.  A Prisma Fit upgrade to a TRIO in the Center for Clinical Imaging Research 
(CCIR) is scheduled for December of 2017. These two Prismas will be running the same 
software version and will be equipped with identical equipment and resources for the 
structural and functional sequences proposed in this application. The Prisma scaners at 
the MIR and the CCIR are fully research dedicated scanners and available for use [ADDRESS_996885] commercial scanner to offer 80 
mT/m gradients with a slew rate of 200 T/m/s. These gradients are the product version 
of the research gradients used in the WU  Human Connectome Project (HCP) Scanner. 
The key benefit to these gradients is the ability to achieve high diffusion sensitivity at 
shorter echo times than is possible with the previous generation of gradient system. The 
Prisma platform is also notable for  64 independent RF channels. Our scanners are (or 
will be) configured with both 32 and 64 element head coils to ensure protocol 
compatibility across multiple centers. These coils enable high acceleration factors during 
traditional parallel imaging approaches as well as the more modern techniques of 
simultaneous multislice and multiband acquisitions utilized in the HCP. Together, these 
technologies enable whole brain imaging with submillimeter structural MRI, sub-second 
BOLD fMRI and high angular resolution diffusion imaging with higher signal to noise than 
is possible on traditional, widely available 3T MR scanners. The new Prisma platform 
offers parallel RF transmission that enables uniform RF excitation and thus prospective 
signal homogeneity and inner volume imaging without aliasing. These state of the art 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 16 technologies built into the Prisma will ensure neuroimaging data of optimal quality and 
maximal compatibility with HCP data.  
MRI Scanner Peripheral Equipment:  The Prisma Suites will also contain the nec essary 
equipment to present experimental stimuli and acquire responses including (1) a rear 
projection system; (2) an S14 fMRI Compatible Insert Earphones system (Sensimetrics Corporation, Malden, MA); and (3) ergonomic subject response devices.

3.b Intervention Regimen  
 
iTBS delivery :  
According to Huang et al, each burst consisting of three stimuli at 50 Hz, repeated every 
200ms will be administered using a two-seconds train repeated every 10 seconds for a 
total of 190s (600 pulses). We chose this paradigm due to its excitatory effects and LTP 
properties and given the best available evidence for effects on depression and executive function.  iTBS will be delivered over bilateral Dorso- Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC ) 
(600 pulses left/ 600 pulses right). TBS will be administered for a total of six weeks, one 
daily session, 
Monday thru Friday.  The coil (B -65 A/P) will be used to deliver the iTBS 
intervention.  
 
Sham (placebo) delivery:  To deliver sham, we will use the same B-65 A/P coil. Sham 
stimulation is ensured by [CONTACT_729869], which 
reduces the magnetic field strength to < 5% of active field which is biologically inactive.  
The coil’s symmetric design and identical clicking noises during both active and sham . 
The coil has a built-in position sensor to ensure that the correct (active or sham) side of 
the coil faces toward the subject’s head.  We will use synchronized gentle electrical 
stimulation to the scalp via pre-gelled surface stimulation electrodes to simulate scalp 
sensations on the sham delivery, which will mimic the active stimulation. Subject’s 
assignment to the intervention will be defined by [CONTACT_729873].  Assignments are stored on individualized USB memory 
devices. 
 
Localization of the Dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)  for iTBS and placebo 
interventions : Subjects assigned to either iTBS or sham intervention will receive 
stimulation on the DLPFC. We will target the DLPFC because it is a key prefrontal cortex 
structure involved in orchestration of executive function.[ADDRESS_996886]’s structural MRI 
scans will be used to localize the DLPFC stimulation target. The DLPFC target 
comprises an area between the center of Brodman area (BA) 9 and the border of BA9 and BA 46
77, the Tailarach coordinates for left DLPFC stimulation will be  [x = -45 y=45, 
z = 35] and  [x = +45 y=45, z = 35] for the right DLPFC.78,79 This neuronavigated target 
has been successfully used in previous rTMS depression studies78,79 and it is expected 
to reduce variability resulting from localization of the stimulation, which has been problematic with previous localization approaches such as the 5cm rule.
80,81  
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 17 Neuronavigation procedures: Following randomization and baseline MRI subjects will 
undergo neuronavigation, the target locations will be specified by [CONTACT_729874]-registration 
from a stereotaxic coordinate on the Tailarach template brain, onto each subject’s 
anatomical MRI. Neuronavigation will proceed using the frameless stereotactic system Brainsight (Rogue Research, Quebec, Canada), to position the coil for maximal field strength at the left and right target regions of the DLPFC for each subject.  
Neuronavigated coordinates will be marked on a textile cap and subjects will wear this cap during each intervention session, ensuring delivery of stimulation on the DLPFC 
target. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_729846]. This 
will help investigators get a better visualization of where the coil should be placed after 
the subject undergoes neuronav igation. 
 
Motor Threshold Determination: Each subject’s Motor Threshold (MT) will be assessed 
using a dedicated C -B60 butterfly coil before the first intervention session. The MT will 
be re-assessed at the beginning of intervention weeks 2, [ADDRESS_996887] 
stimulation intensity required to induce a motor response of the Abductor Pollicis Brevis 
(APB) muscle in the contralateral hand. MT will be measured via the visualization 
method, by [CONTACT_729875]. Because of our subjects’ age range, we will “dose” iTBS at 120% of the resting MT. This dosing is 
necessary to adjust for prefrontal atrophy in the elderly.  This dosing has  been used in a 
large sample without serious adverse events.  
 
In order to ease subjects into stimulation we will begin the first intervention at the level of 
MT and titrate up to 120% of the MT during the first week of intervention.  Subjects will 
achieve 120% of MT by [CONTACT_281114].   The TMS device to be used in this study for delivery of the interventions is currently 
employed in clinical operations and is housed at the West Pavilion, suite [ZIP_CODE], 
Outpatient Psychiatric Clinic at [ADDRESS_996888] once study is finished. Therefore, there is not need for maintaining device shipment and receipt records.  The equipment used for neuronavigation procedures is located at the Laboratory for 
Applied Brain Plasticity (LABP)  on the East Building located at [ADDRESS_996889]. 
Louis, MO [ZIP_CODE] and it is currently used in research operations.  
 
Scanning facilities :.  
 Scanning facilities: MRI scans will be performed at the following scanning facilities at 
Washington University:  
 
• Center for Clinical Imaging Research (CCIR):  The CCI R is located on the [ADDRESS_996890] possesses f our 
dedicated resea rch scann ers, whi ch include a 3T MRI Siemens scanner which 
will undergo Prisma Fit upgrade.  
 
• The MRI facility at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology:  located at  
[ADDRESS_996891] equal probability to be randomized in each study arm and permuted blocks of randomly varying sizes (4, 6, and 8) will be used to generate the scheme. Each block will contain equal numbers of assignments to iTBS 
and sham providing a balanced design. Neuropsychological testing, mood asse ssments 
and fMRI scans will be performed pre- and post-intervention. 
 
3.d Subject Compliance Monitoring  
 
Subjects will receive a total of 3 0 study intervention sessions, administered once daily, 
Monday thru Friday for six  weeks.  Single- day intervention sessions missed due to 
expected ( holidays) or unexpected ( eg. Inclement weather , illness, transportation 
difficulties) reasons will have to be made up, in this way the subject will still receive the 
entire 30 interventions , but over a longer time period (i.e. greater than 4-6 weeks).  
More than four  consecutive missed sessions will cause withdrawal from study. Missing 
more than six non-consecutive sessions (20% of the interventions ), which cannot be 
made up will also lead to study withdrawal .  
 
All missed intervention days will be recorded in a log for each participant, and reviewed 
(weekly if no adherence is detected, so that study staff can intervene) by [CONTACT_978].  
 
 
3.e Prior and Concomitant Therapy   
 
Subjects may continue existing antidepressant treatments (which are not part of 
excluded medications). However , subjects  will be asked not to make changes on 
antidepressant doses in order to maintain a consistent regimen of medications during 
TBS intervention.  Likewise, is  a subject is receiving psychotherapy, this regimen should 
not be modified.  
 
 
E Study Procedures   
 
E1 Screening for Eligibility  
 
A phone screen will be performed prior to the first study visit.  Over the phone the 
participant will be given a detailed description of the study including risk/benefits. They 
will be asked to provide information to help determine eligibility. Questions include demographics and health questions related to subject’s history of depression, 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 19 medications.  Other questions include those to rule out contraindications to TMS such as 
metal in the head, a personal history of seizures or severe head trauma.  Questions 
about contraindications to MRI will be asked as well. If participant meets eligibility criteria based on that information an appointment will be scheduled to review and discuss the informed consent in person. 
 
E2 Schedule of Measurements  
 
After providing informed consent the following procedures will begin.  
 Screening visit (Visit 0)  At this visit a psychiatric interview will be performed by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_85374], during the visit the diagnosis of major depressive disorder will be confirmed, and information about subject's health status and ongoing medications will be obtained. Also a safety 
assessment will be performed to rule out the presence of active suicidal ideation with 
plan and imminent danger which will preclude study participation.  
Screening assessments include:

Motor Threshold determination: Each subject’s Motor Threshold (MT) will be assessed 
using a dedicated C -B60 butterfly coil.  Motor Threshold for the left and the right 
hemisphere will be determined. MT will be repeated every two weeks afterwards at the 
beginning of each intervention week. MT will be  re-checked in situations such as recent 
medication changes, changes in sleep habits as determined necessary by [CONTACT_978].  MT is 
the lowest stimulation intensity required to induce a motor response of the Abductor 
Pollicis Brevis (APB) muscle in the contralateral hand. MT will be obtained by [CONTACT_729876], by [CONTACT_729877]. Motor Threshold determination takes about 20 minutes to complete.  
 
Determination of stimulation site: Stimulation will be delivered over the scalp over the 
brain area corresponding to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann areas 9 and 
46). Stimulation will be bilateral, subsequent left and right. We will localize the DLPFC 
using subjects’s structural scans and the foll owing Tailarach coordinates: [x = -45 y=45,

E3 Safety and Adverse Events  
 
Interventions and precautions to minimize subject’s risk during TBS intervention:  
 • Treating personnel is trained to act as first line responder, and will have cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training, in case of a seizure event.  • Intervention will be delivered in a suite equipped with necessary materials to assist the subject in case of a seizure (oxygen, pulsoxymetry monitor, etc.).  
Besides the suite is located in house Barnes Jewish hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729847].  The TMS treater will call the emergency response team in case of a seizure or other event deemed an 
emergency.  
• The TMS suite has a written protocol to handle a seizure occurrence  
• Subjects with increased risk of seizure or history of head trauma that may increase seizure won’t be eligible for intervention.  Besides we will screen subjects with The TMS 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 22 Adult Safety Screen (TASS) prior to iTBS intervention.  
• Cognitive function is monitored throughout the intervention.  
• Side effects of the intervention will be monitored weekly with the Frequency, Intensity 
and Burden of Side Effects rating (FIBSER).  If deemed clinically necessary side effects will be also monitored by [CONTACT_5989]. Besides, subjects will be asked about side effects and will be monitored on all intervention days by [CONTACT_729878].  
• Hearing will be protected by [CONTACT_729879]:  
• Depressive symptoms will be monitored weekly  and every day subjects will be asked 
about how is their mood. Standardized mood scales are administered pre and post 
intervention.  
• Emergent suicidal ideation will be monitored daily during the intervention and suicidal 
ideation will be assessed weekly with the 21-ite m Scale for Suicidal Ideation SSI,  
• During the course of the intervention if necessary, [CONTACT_729886][INVESTIGATOR_729848] a safety assessment. If clinically indicated, severely depressed patients will be advised 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729849]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729850] a serious adverse event and the participant will be terminated from the study 
protocol.  
 
Confidentiality: Subject’s confidentiality will be assured through a multi -layered 
approach, entirely compliant with HIPAA regulations. We will have the following formal 
mechanisms limiting access to information that can link data to individual participants. 
Data forms that include identifying information will be kept in locked cabinets. Only the unique ID number, assigned by [CONTACT_729880], data transfer, data analysis, or other file management procedures. To facilitate tracking, a password-protected computer file will 
be maintained containing the identity of participants, their ID numbers, and information 
about how they can be reached. This file, however, will contain no clinical data. Only members of the investigative group will have access to secured files or to master lists for participant code numbers and will be well informed regarding the protection of patients’ rights to confidentiality. Identities of participants will not be revealed in the publication or presentation of any results from this project.  
 
Interventions to Minimize Risk of MRI: 
To minimize the risk of claustrophobia, participants could do a mock scan on fake scanner, which can help them ease this. In addition, during the scan, participants will be able to talk with the MRI staff through a speaker system and can tell them to stop the 
scan at any time. 
To minimize the risk of injury caused by [CONTACT_729881] , participants will be asked a series of questions about metal exposure 
over the course of their lifetime from work experiences and medical procedures.  
To minimize the risk of boredom, tiredness, muscle aches and anxiety, participants may take breaks as needed throughout the study. They will also be told they can take breaks.  
Participants are offered pi[INVESTIGATOR_729851].  Participants will be able to communicate with study staff at all times during the scan and will be told they can stop the scan at any time for any reason. Earplugs will be offered to 
decrease the exposure to the scanner’s acoustic noise.   
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 23 Participants will be screened at the time of the phone screener and again before the MRI 
scan using the 3.0 T MRI Recruitment/Pre-entry Screening form and will not receive an 
MRI scan if the screen is positive. Individuals with fear of confined spaces may become 
anxious during an MRI. There are no known long-term risks or consequences of MRI scans. The length of scan will be about 60 mins.  
 
 
3.a Safety and Compliance Monitoring  
 
At each intervention session, the intervention administrator will monitor subjects for 
safety and compliance with study procedures.    Compliance monitoring: All missed intervention days will be recorded in a log for each 
participant, and reviewed (weekly if nonadherence is detected, so that study staff can 
intervene) by [CONTACT_978].  
 
3.b Medical Monitoring   
 
At each intervention session, the intervention administrator or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_151602], will 
monitor subjects ’ safety during study procedures.  
 
[CONTACT_729886][INVESTIGATOR_729852] a board-certified psychiatrist with expertise in mood disorders and brain stimulation treatments (TMS).  She will be overseeing all study procedures. Subjects will be provided with her office number and a 24-hour emergency contact [CONTACT_729882]’ concerns.  
 
3.c Definitions of Adverse Events  
A. Definition 
 An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject temporally associated with participation in the clinical study or with use of the TMS device.  An adverse finding can include a sign, symptom, abnormal assessment (laboratory test value, vital signs, electrocardiogram finding, etc.), or any combination of these.  
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse event that results in one or more of the following outcomes: 
 
• Death 
• A life-threatening event 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important medical event based upon  appropriate medical judgment  
 
 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 [ADDRESS_996895]. 
An AE will be termed “mild” if it does not have a major impact on the subject, 
“moderate” if it causes the subject some minor inconvenience, and “severe” if it 
causes a substanti al disruption to the subject’ s well being.  
Additionally they will be classified as expected or unexpected.  
 
 
AE Attribution Scale  
 AEs will be categorized according to the likelihood that they are related to the study intervention or other study procedures. Specifically, they will be labeled definitely 
unrelated, definitely related, probably related, or possibly  related to the study 
intervention or procedures .   
 
 
3.e Data Collection Procedures for Adverse Events  
 
We will syste matically collect AEs and summarize them in a running table throughout the 
study, including date of onset/offset, type of AE, severity, and interventions if any. Per Washington University IRB policy, reportable AEs are those that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study intervention or procedures.  
 
Throughout the study interventions, each subject will be queried about any adverse 
events since the last iTBS/ placebo session to date. The study research assistant or the 
blinded intervention administrator will do the questioning of AE’s.  
After an adverse event occurrence, a detailed note will be generated.  Note will include 
time, point in the intervention session, subject’s symptoms or complaints, and any steps 
taken.  Steps taken may include physical examination, medical care delivered, etc.   
3.f Reporting Procedures  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a sub-PI [INVESTIGATOR_729853]’s, all severe expected AE’s, and 
all AE’s which meet the qualifications of serious (SAE’s). If an adverse event occurs then PI [INVESTIGATOR_729854]. Intervention (iTBS or placebo) -
related events or any safety issue will  be addressed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cristancho.  
 
A compi[INVESTIGATOR_729855].  
 
SAEs that are unanticipated, serious, and possibly related to the study intervention will be reported to the IRB, and NIH/NCATS  in accordance with reporting guidelines.

 [ADDRESS_996896] to their safety and the integrity of the research data. 
Likewise the PI [INVESTIGATOR_729856], FDA and or the National Institute of Health.  All participants will be reviewed by [CONTACT_729883]; exclusion criteria (e.g., suicidality, contraindications to study intervention) will reduce the risk to participants. Participants will be carefully monitored during the study. Additionally, the study will have a 24-hour answering service with physician coverage.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cristancho Pi[INVESTIGATOR_729857]; inclusion/exclusion criteria; case report form review; adverse events and other Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) required monitoring and reporting activities. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_729858]. This 
information will be included in yearly renewals with the HRPO.  
 [CONTACT_729887] (Professor at the Department of Psychiatry ) will be fully available to provide guidance regarding issues related to the safety of study participants and the 
integrity of the study. [CONTACT_155371] will participate in research meetings to review accuracy 
of screening, subject accrual, and all subjects who withdraw from the study. Likewise, he will be available to assess with issues regarding participant accrual, overall study progress, intervention efficacy, adverse events, ethical concerns, quality of monitoring, and protocol adherence. The entire investigative team with [CONTACT_729888] , [CONTACT_155371] and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_729859].  
 
 We will follow procedures pertaining to adverse events and serious adverse events as specified in the DSMP document  
E4 Study Outcome Measurements and Ascertainment 
 
Primary outcome measures:  
The effects of the study intervention depression will be measured using the Montgomery  
Asberg Depression Rating Scale.  
The effects of the study intervention on executive function will be evaluated using the 
Flanker inhibitory control , the Dimensional change sort task and the  
List Sorting Working memory test will measure executive function,  from the NIH Tool box 
executive function domain.   
Brain’ s connectivity measure: Using resting state fMRI we will measure functional 
connectivity within the Cognitive Control Network (CCN) in depressed older adults 
before and after study intervention. We will also explore functional connectivity within 
and between other networks that are relevant to depression including the Default Mode 
network  and the cingulo-opercular networks.  
 
 
F Statistical Plan   
 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 26  
Statistical Analyses: We will use intention-to -treat principles. We will use t-test or its 
non-parametric equivalent to compare the distribution of continuous variables and the 
changes in the main outcome measures between active and sham groups. χ2 tests will 
be used to compare categorical variables between groups. We will use a mixed general linear model (GLM) to accommodate data from our within- and between-participant study 
design to examine changes from baseline to post-intervention, and compare them 
between active vs. sham groups. The GLM explores estimated marginal means by 
[CONTACT_729884]- and between-participant variability, adjusting for confounders 
and allowing exploration of significance of within-participant and between-group 
interaction effects. Differences between groups in behavioral outcome measures and 
network connection changes will be evaluated through 2-way interaction effect 
(time*group). Through the 2- way interaction iTBS*Fazekas score we will explore the 
modification effect of grade of white matter burden on the impact of iTBS in the observed network connectivity changes. Pearson’s correlation will examine the correlation 
between changes in behavioral measures with changes in network connectivity. We will 
use Hayes’ PROCESS
[ADDRESS_996897] intervention as 
mediator of change for iTBS and bootstrap and Monte Carlo confidence intervals will be 
calculated. All stati stical tests will be two-sided and evaluated at the alpha level of 0.05. 
SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R 3.2.3 statistical software packages will be used 
for all analyses. Sample size justification: For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], I plan to enroll 20 elderly  
subjects and randomized them to iTBS arm or placebo arm (10 in each group).  The sample size of [ADDRESS_996898] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_729860]:  
 
Study data will be kept for potential future analysis. Records will be maintained for at least [ADDRESS_996899] pavilion 15th floor at BJH Psychiatry Department at the TMS 
clinic suite. Only the minimally necessary number of personnel will be present. MRI 
scans will be performed at scanning facilities at Washington University: The 
CCIR and t he MRI facility at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology .  
 
G2 Training   
 
All staff involved in TBS administration will be trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cristancho Pi[INVESTIGATOR_729840] 
(director of the TMS clinic).  
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 [ADDRESS_996900] the following formal mechanisms 
limiting access to information that can link data to individual participants: Data forms that 
include identifying information will be kept in locked cabinets. Only the unique ID number, assigned by [CONTACT_729880], data transfer, data analysis, or other file management procedures . 
 Electronic case report forms will be created using the same confidentiality procedures described above.  Data will be stored into a secure data base on the university network.

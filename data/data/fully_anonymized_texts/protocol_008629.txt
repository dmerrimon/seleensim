Prohibited Medications and Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) during the study.  
Study Procedures  The study will consist of a Baseline Visit, follow -up visits at LTF -Months 1, 
3, 6, and 9,  and follow -up phone calls at LTF -Months 4.5 and 7.5. For 
subjects in the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_794009] (CB -03-01 
cream, 1% twice daily), the total treatment period will be 12 (3+9) months; 
whereas for those subjects in the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] s tudies randomized to 
vehicle, the total treatment period will be 9 (0+9) months.  
 
For this Long- Term Follow -Up (LTF) study, subjects must rollover from the 
Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397] (CB -03-01/25 and CB -03-01/26) into this study AT or 
WITHIN THREE (3) DAYS of Visit 4- Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735].  
 
During the LTF study, subjects will treat facial acne per protocol for nine months. Treatment of truncal acne is optional and will be discussed by [CONTACT_794032] (see Section 10.3). If truncal acne is to be treated, 
the subject must continue to treat the designated treatment area for the 
remainder of the study as detailed in Section 6.2
. Treatment on face and/or 
trunk for a subject may be discontinued if/when acne is under successful control (achieves an IGA of grade 0 or “minimal” grade 1) and re- instated

investigator for each respective treatment area. Subjects must be seen by [CONTACT_794033] a scheduled or unscheduled visit to change (i.e., restart or 
stop) test article dosing.  Acne will be managed per p rotocol as detailed in 
Section 6.2 and Section 8.2. 
 
Visit 4 -LTF (Baseli ne): At Visit 4 -LTF, study staff will explain the study 
procedures and an informed consent/assent must be signed prior to the 
initiation of any study -related procedures. At this visit, inclusion/exclusion 
criteria will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. Demographics and medical/dermatological history data will be used from the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397]. A brief physical examination including vital signs and a UPT (if 
applicable) will be performed. Note: If Visit 4- Pi[INVESTIGATOR_794010] 4- LTF occur 
on the  
same day, the results of the UPT performed during the End of Study 
(EOS) visit of the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_794011]. IGA

performed during the EOS Visit of the  Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397] (Visit 4 -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735]) 
will be used as Baseline data. Treatment of truncal acne will be discussed by 
[CONTACT_136713]. If the subject desires, the truncal treatment area 
will be defined and agreed upon by [CONTACT_27379], with the 
percent body surface area (BSA) to be treated recorded. If the investigator

Sponsor Name: [CONTACT_229771] S.p.A.  Protocol Date: September 9, [ADDRESS_1094893] do not designate a treatment area for truncal acne at this visit, one may be  designated at subsequent visits (e.g., if acne worsens in the truncal 
area); however, once treatment begins in such truncal treatment area, the subject must continue to treat this area for the remainder of the study as 
detailed in Section 6.2. If applicable, IGA and LSRs [pre- application] for the 
trunk will also be assessed at this visit. Ongoing concomitant medications 
and procedures will be reviewed. The subject (and parent/guardian, if 
applicable) will be instructed on how to apply the investigational test article (ITA). ITA and subject diary will be dispensed. The first dose will be applied 
during this visit under supervision of the investigator, except for thos e 
subjects with clear facial acne and no truncal acne. LSRs post -application 
(for both face and trunk separately, as applicable) and adverse events (AEs) 
will be assessed. The subject will be scheduled for the first follow -up visit.  
NOTE: If a subject’s a cne is totally clear (i.e., IGA=0) on face and/or trunk, 
the subject will not receive or apply the ITA at home for the first month of 
the study and be reassessed at Visit 5 or earlier (after an unscheduled visit), 
if acne worsens (be it on the face and/or the trunk) before Visit 5.  
 
Visits 5 (LTF Month 1), 6 (LTF Month 3), and 8 (LTF Month 6) : Subjects 
will return to the clinic. IGA, LSRs, and AEs will also be assessed. 
Concomitant medications and procedures and ITA compliance will be 
reviewed. A UPT (if ap plicable) will be performed at Visit 8. Assessment of 
the subject’s acne will be made on face and trunk to determine if the subject requires on -going therapy or if treatment needs to be started (i.e., for subjects 
with an IGA=0 at Baseline [Visit 4- LTF]) o r restarted (after a previous 
discontinuation due to acne clearing). Based on this determination, ITA and 
a subject diary will be dispensed/returned (as required). For subjects starting 
treatment at this visit, the first dose of the ITA will be applied und er 
supervision of the investigator. The subject will be scheduled for a follow -
up visit (at Visit 5 and Visit 6) or end of study (EOS) visit (at Visit 8).  
 
Visit 7: Phone Call 1 (LTF Month 4.5) and Visit 9: Phone Call 2 (LTF Month 
7.5):  The site staff will contact [CONTACT_794034]. Site staff will query the subject about any AEs and will confirm the next appointment. In the event there is:  
 
a) improvin g or worsening of the subject’s acne such that the treatment may 
be discontinued or restarted, respectively, OR  
 
b) a concern regarding an AE or the subject’s progress based upon the Phone Call visit,  
 
the subject may be seen in the clinic as an unscheduled visit at the discretion 
of the investigator. However, to change (i.e., restart or stop) test article 
dosing on either treatment area (face and/or trunk), the subject must be seen 
and evaluated in person by [CONTACT_1719].  
 
Visit 10 (Month 9): End of Study (EOS) Visit & Early Termination.  Subjects 
will return to the clinic for the final visit. UPT (if applicable) will be 
performed. IGA, LSRs, and AEs will be assessed. Concomitant medications

Sponsor Name: [CONTACT_229771] S.p.A.  Protocol Date: September 9, [ADDRESS_1094894] will exit the study.  
 
Unscheduled Visit: [If/As Needed]. Note: Subjects must be seen by [CONTACT_794033] a scheduled or an unscheduled visit to change (i.e., restart 
or stop) test article dosing on either treatment area (face and/or trunk).  
Subjects may return to the clinic at the discretion of the investigator. LSRs, 
AEs, and any changes in concomitant medications and procedures will be 
assessed, as needed. In addition , IGA, to document acne 
improvement/clearance (i.e., achieves an IGA of grade 0 or “minimal” grade 1) or significant worsening (IGA ≥2), shall also be assessed to support treatment modifications. ITA will be dispensed/returned (as required). The 
next regul ar follow -
up visit will be confirmed prior to the end of the 
unscheduled visit.  
Study Measurements  Safety  will be assessed by [CONTACT_794035]/phone call.  
 
LSRs including telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, and scaling/dryness will be assessed by [CONTACT_794036] (face and trunk) using a five-
point ordinal scale from 0=none to 
4=severe at each visit (Visit 4 -LTF [post -application, if applicable], and 
Visits 5, 6, 8, and 10, and any Unscheduled Visits, as needed). Subjects will 
be asked to rate the severity of stinging/burning and pruritus for each 
treatment area (face and trunk) using a four -point scale from 0= none to 
3=severe at each visit (Visit 4 -LTF [post -application, if applicable], and 
Visits 5, 6, 8, and 10, and any Unscheduled Visits, as needed).  
 Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_794037]. IGA performed 
on the face during the End of Stud y (EOS) Visit of the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397] 
(i.e., Visit 4 -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735]) and IGA performed on the trunk at Visit 4- LTF will be 
used as Baseline data. If treatment of the trunk begins post -Visit4 -LTF, the 
Baseline data will be assessed at the visit where treatmen t is first applied.  
 
Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) : Overall severity of acne using a 
five-point scale from 0=clear to 4=severe will be conducted at Visits 5, 6, 8, 
and 10 for each treatment area (face and trunk) and any Unscheduled Visits, as needed. This is a static morphological scale that refers to a point in time 
and not a comparison to Baseline.  
Study Endpoints  Safety Endpoints:  
• Incidence of any local and systemic treatment emergent AEs 
(TEAEs). 
• Number of subjects with presence (and sever ity) of each individual 
LSR (telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, scaling/dryness, stinging/burning, and pruritus) for each treatment area, as applicable, at each time point collected (Baseline, and LTF -

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  • Number of subjects with each IGA severity score for each treatment 
area, as applicable, at each time point collected (Baseline and LTF -
Months 1, 3, 6, and 9).  
Sample Size 
Calculations  For large samples, the two -sided confidence interval for a single proportion 
extends a distance ω =𝑧𝑧1−𝛼𝛼
2�𝜋𝜋(1−𝜋𝜋 )
𝑛𝑛 from the observed proportion in both 
directions. An incidence no greater than 1% of important AEs out of 100 
subjects will provide the estimate of no greater than a 3% prevalence of 
important AEs at the 95% confidence level with a much larger number of subjects exposed for the same duration (i.e., 12 months). Applying the same 
approach, an incidence no greater than 1% of important AEs out of 300 
subjects will provide the estimate of no greater than a 2.1% prevalence of important AEs at the 95% confidence l evel with a much larger number of 
subjects exposed for the same duration (i.e., 6 months).  
 
Approximately six hundred (600) subjects will be enrolled in order to have 
300 subjects on -study at 6 months and 100 subjects on -study at 12 months.  
These treatmen t durations include the 0 or 3 months of active treatment in 
the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491] (CB -03-01/25 and CB -03-01/26).  
Statistical Methods  All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise 
stated. Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will 
be provided for baseline variables, efficacy variables, and safety variables. Continuous variables will be described by [CONTACT_9086] (n, mean, 
standard deviation, CV%, minimum, median, and maximum). Frequency 
counts and percentage of subjects within each category are provided for 
categorical data.  
 
Study Sets:  
Subjects who complete [ADDRESS_1094895] article (CB -03-01 cream, 1%) dosing per protocol 
will count towards the desired [ADDRESS_1094896] article. The intent -to-treat (ITT) set will include all 
enrolled subjects. The per -protoc ol (PP) set will be a subset of the ITT set 
and will include subjects who completed the study without any significant protocol deviations. The analysis of safety will be conducted on the Safety set. The analysis of efficacy will be conducted on both the IT T and PP sets.  
 
Safety Analyses:  
Extent of Exposure  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize exposure to test article for 
the Safety, ITT, and PP sets. The total amount of test article used (grams applied) will be calculated for each subject from t he weights of the returned 
test articles. The mean daily amount of test article applied (total amount of test article used/number of days of treatment) will be calculated for each subject. The number of applications and days dosed for each treatment area 
(face and/or trunk from Subject Diary) will also be summarized.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  1. BACKGROUND  
CB-03-01 (cortexolone 17α- propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]) is a steroidal antiandrogen that is being developed 
as a 1% cream for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_112930], an androgen -depende nt skin 
disorder. CB -03-[ADDRESS_1094909], is a physiological 
component of the pool of endogenous corticosteroids, and is an intermediate in the synthesis of glucocorticoids, but it only exhibits weak glucocorticoid properties [ 1]. 
 CB-03-01 could offer advantages over existing products for acne vulgaris due to its 
potential efficacy and lack of systemic antiandrogen activity. Because its pharmacological action appears to be limited to the local site of application, use of CB-03-01 may be able 
to mitigate the side effects related to systemic exposure to hormonal agents currently used in the treatment of acne.  
2. RATIONALE  
To date, CB -03-01 cream has been used for treatment of acne vulgaris for up to 12 weeks 
with no material sa fety issues to note. Given that acne vulgaris is a chronic condition which 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_794017] (and sometimes intermittent) treatment, this study is designed to investigate the long -term safety of CB -03-
01 cream,  1%. 
3. OBJECTIVE  
The primary objective of this study is to determine the long -term safety of CB -03-01 cream, 
1% applied twice daily for an additional nine months in subjects with acne vulgaris that participated in the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_794008] a total trea tment of up to 12 months. 
4. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a multicenter, open label, long- term extension study for CB -03-01 cream, 1% 
focused on safety in male and female subjects, 9 years or older who completed one of the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491] [CB -03-01/25 and CB -03-01/26]. Subjects will apply the active 
medication (CB -03-01 cream, 1%) twice daily to the entire face and, if designated by 
[CONTACT_794031], truncal acne for nine additional months of treatment. Thus, overall subjects will be exposed to CB -03-01 cream, 1% for a total treatment of up 
to 12 months (0 or 3 months in the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_794018]- term safety study).

truncal area), but once treatment begins in such treatment area, the subject must continue to treat this area per protocol for the remainder of the study.  
 Treatment on the face and/or trunk may be discontinued if/when acne clears (achieves an IGA of grade 0 or “minimal” grade 1) and re -instated if/when acne worsens (IGA ≥2), 
according to the assessment of the investigator for each respective treatment area (i.e., face and trunk). Note: Subjects must be seen by [CONTACT_794041] a routinely scheduled study visit or an unscheduled visit to change (i.e., restart or stop) test article dosing on either treatment area (i.e., face and trunk).  
 Subjects (approximately 600) will be rolled over from the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491] [CB -03-
01/25 and CB -03-01/26] into this long -term, safety study in order to achieve at least 300 
subjects on- study at 6 months and 100 subjects on- study at 12 months. These treatment 
durations include the 0 or 3 months of active treatment in the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491] (CB-03-01/25 and CB-03-01/26).

Acne Management:  The intent of the study is to limit the use of other acne medications 
to facilitate the safety assessment of long -term use of the investigational test article over a 
one year period of time.  In the event that the study drug does not suff iciently control the 
subject’s acne, the Investigator, at their election, may prescribe select additional 
medication(s)[ADDRESS_1094929] article. Ideally these 
measures should be used only for brief period(s) of ti me, if medically necessary, to 
reasonably control the subject’s acne, during the study.  These medications are limited to 
certain products (e.g., topi[INVESTIGATOR_900] -acne cleansers, oral antibiotics, or intralesional steroid 
injections for cyst/nodular lesions) a s detailed in the list of allowed medications or 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_794026].  
9. STUDY PROCEDURES  
The study will consist of a Baseline Visit, follow -up visits at Months 1, 3, 6, and 9, and

10.1 Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA)  
Overall severity of acne using a five- point scale from 0=clear to 4=severe will be evalu ated 
for the face and trunk, separately. This is a static morphological scale that refers to a point 
in time and not a comparison to Baseline. IGA performed on the face during the End of Study (EOS) Visit of the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397] (i.e., Visit 4 -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] ) and IGA performed 
on the trunk at Visit 4- LTF will be used as Baseline data.  
 
[ADDRESS_1094934] Clear  Rare non -inflammatory lesions with no more than one small 
inflammatory lesion. 
2 Mild  Some non -inflammatory lesions with no more than a few 
inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only; no nodular/cystic 
lesions). 
[ADDRESS_1094935] some 
inflammatory lesions but no more than one nodular/cystic lesion. 
4 Severe  Up to many non -inflammatory lesions and inflammatory lesions 
but no more than a few nodular/cystic lesions.  
 
IGA, to document acne improvement (i.e., achieves an IGA of grade 0 or “minimal” grade 
1) or worsening (IGA≥2), should also be assessed to support treatment recommendations at regularly scheduled visits and any unscheduled visits, as needed.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  10.2 Local Skin Reactions (LSRs)  
At every  in-clinic study visit and unscheduled visits, the investigator or designee will 
document the severity of the following LSRs known to be associated with application of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_794029] (face and trunk, separately):  
• Telangiectasia  
• Skin atrophy 
• Striae rubrae  
 A five -point ordinal scale will be used to assess the severity of these reactions (0=none, 
1=trace, 2=mild, 3=moderate, and 4=severe).  In addition, the investigator or designee will evaluate the severity of the following LSRs known to be associated with acne vulgaris in the treatment areas (face and trunk, separately), using the five-point ordinal scales described below: 
• Erythema  
• Edema  
• Scaling/dryness  
 Erythema:  
0 None  
1 Minimal – barely perceptible erythema  
2 Mild – predominantly minimal erythema (pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]) in the treated area with or without 
a few isolated areas of more intense erythema  
3 Moderate – predominantly moderate erythema (red) in the treated area with or 
without a few isolated areas of intense erythema (bright  red) 
4 Severe – predominantly intense erythema (bright red) in the treated area with or 
without a few isolated areas of very intense (fiery red) erythema  
 Edema:  
0 None  
1 Minimal – scant, rare edema  
2 Mild – easily seen edema, minimally palpable, involving up to 1/3 of the 
Treatment Area  
3 Moderate – easily seen edema and typi[INVESTIGATOR_229764], involving between 1/3 to

Scaling/ dryness: 
0 None  
1 Minimal – barely perceptible desquamation  
2 Mild - limited areas of fine desquamation in up to 1/3 of the treatment area  
3 Moderate – fine desquamation involving 1/3 to 2/3 of the treatment area or limited 
areas of coarser scaling  
4 Severe – coarser scaling involving more than 2/3 of the treatment area or limited 
areas of very coarse scaling  
 In addition, subjects will be asked to rate the severity of the following LSRs that occurred in the treatment areas (face and trunk, separately ) since the last visit, using the four -point 
ordinal scales described below:  
• Stinging/burning 
• Pruritus  
 Stinging/burning: 
0 None  
1 Minimal, barely perceptible – tolerable and little discomfort  
2 Moderate – tolerable, but causes some discomfort  
3 Severe – very uncomfortable or intolerable  
 Pruritus (itching):  
0 None - no evidence of itching  
1 Mild - only aware of itching at times, only present when relaxing, not present when 
focused on other activities  
2 Moderate - often aware of itching, annoying, som etimes disturbs sleep and daytime 
activities  
3 Severe -constant itching, distressing; frequent sleep disturbance, interferes with 
activities  
 These LSRs will be collected independently of AEs. Only LSRs that require medical intervention (e.g., prescription medication) or require withholding the application of the test articles will be documented as AEs. Any LSRs that are not listed above will be recorded as AEs.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  10.3 Truncal Body Surface Area (BSA)  
Treatment of truncal acne will be discussed by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator and subject. If the subject 
desires, the truncal treatment area will be defined and agreed upon by [CONTACT_794050]. Percent BSA to be treated will be estimated using the assumption th at 1% BSA is equivalent to the area of the subject’s hand 
with fingers held together. Once this truncal treatment area has been defined, the subject must continue to treat this area for the remainder of the study until the area is clear (an IGA of grade 0 or “minimal” grade 1) as determined by [CONTACT_794051] -initiate 
treatment (as/if required) per protocol for worsening (see Section 6.2). 
11. PHOTOGRAPHY  
Photography documentation is not required in this study. However, the investigator may 
elect to photograph the subject to document the effects of treatment, AEs or other findings during the trial. All photographs taken as part of this study are for informational purposes only and are not to assist in grading or for any other assessment.   Note: Subjects may decline to have photographs taken during the conduct of the study. If a subject initially consents to photographs, then declines further photography, the  Sponsor 
may use the photographs taken under consent for the purposes noted above. 
12. LABORATORY TESTS  
12.1 Urine Pregnancy Tests (UPTs)  
The UPT will be performed at the study site if the site meets local country requirements to 
perform the testing (e.g., United S tates sites registered and conforms to Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments  (CLIA) regulations for such testing [site possesses at a 
minimum a current valid CLIA Certificate of Waiver]) or at an appropriately registered reference laboratory. A UPT wi ll be performed at Visit 4 -LTF (or Visit 4 -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], if the 
visits occur on the same day) (i.e., Baseline), Visit  8 (LTF -Month 6), and Visit  10 (EOS) 
on all WOCBP (see Section 5.1 for definition). The investigator will report the UPT results 
on the CRFs, in the subject’s medical records and, if applicable, in independent records maintained at the study site. The UPT used must have a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU of 
β-HCG/mL of urine.  
13. END OF STUDY CRITERI A 
At the end of each subject’s participation in the study, the investigator will complete an

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  An AE (also referred t o as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with any drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  Information on the medical condition of subjects should begin following the subject’s written consent/assent to participate in the study and a medical history should be taken at screening. Other changes in subject health information becomes AE data when the subject begins dosing with the test article and therefore AE data should be collected from the date of the first d ose of test article. These data are considered treatment -emergent AEs.  
 Timely and complete reporting of all AEs assists the contract research organization (CRO) in identifying any untoward medical occurrence, thereby [CONTACT_17155]:  
1) protection of the safety of study subjects;  
2) a greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the test article;  
3) recognition of dose- related test article toxicity;  
4) appropriate modification of study protocols;  
5) improvements in study design or procedures; and  
6) adherence to worldwide regulatory requirements.  
 Test article is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or vehicle/placebo being tested or used as a reference in the study, whether blinded or unblinded. AEs may be either spontaneously reported or elicited during questioning and examination of a subject. All AEs must be completely recorded on the AE CRF. If known, the investigator should report the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder, rather than its individual sympt oms. Subjects experiencing AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of test 
article, or those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of their participation in the study should receive follow -up as appropriate. If possible, report the outcome of  any AE 
that caused permanent discontinuation or that was present at the end of the study particularly if the AE is considered by [CONTACT_47747]- related (i.e., 
definitely, probably, or possibly related to test article). 
14.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
All AEs must be recorded on the AE CRF. AEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization (if possible), and reported as serious adverse events (SAEs) if they become serious.  LSRs that have been reported in subjects treated with CB -03-01 creams (0.1% -1% 
concentration) include (with decreasing frequency) erythema, pruritus, scaling/dryness, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, stinging/burning, edema, and telangiectasia; however most LSRs were typi[INVESTIGATOR_229765]. No subjects discontinued tre atment due 
to these LSRs.

Sponsor Name: [CONTACT_229771] S.p.A.  Protocol Date: September 9, [ADDRESS_1094940] been reported in subjects treated with CB -03-01 creams (0.1 -1% 
concentration) were minimal, typi[INVESTIGATOR_229766], and most were recovered/resolved without sequelae at the end of the study. Only two AEs in one (1) subject were judged as 
probably or possibly related to treatment; both of these treatment -related AEs (burning and 
cold at application site) were mild in severity. Two SAEs have been reported to date; both were not related to treatment and were resolved at the end of the study. In addition, one subject discontinued early from the study due to an AE (urinary tract infection), which was not related to treatment.  
 The investigator will instruct the subject to report any AEs that may occur during the study.  
At each visit, the investigator should ask the subject, in non- directive fashion, about any 
change in the subject’s overall condition since the previous visit.  The severity of each AE, as judged by [CONTACT_093], will be recorded on the appropriate AE CRF and will be graded according to the following scale: 
 
Mild - The AE is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].  
 
Moderate - The AE causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual 
activities.  
 
Severe - The AE causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual 
activities, and may be incapacitating or life -threatening. 
 The investigator must determine the relationship of the AE to the test article according to the following categories:  
Definite  - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_47732], and reappearance of the event on repeated exposure (re- challenge).  
 
Probable  - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_794052][INVESTIGATOR_28215]; and that is unlikely to have been caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness or other drugs, procedures, or other causes. 
 
Possible  - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern 
to the test article; but may have been caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness, other drug, procedure, or other causes.

pattern to the test article, or most likely was caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness, other drug, procedure, or other causes, because of their known effects.  
 
Not Related  - An event almost certainly caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness, 
other drug, procedure, or other causes.  
The investigator should categorize the outcome of the AE according to the following categories:  
  Fatal - Termination of life as a result of an AE. 
  Not Recovered/Not Resolved - AE has not improved or the subject has not 
recuperated.  
  Recovered/Resolved - AE has improved or the subject has recuperated.  
  Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae - subject recuperated but retained the 
pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury.  
  Recovering/Resolving -  AE is improving or the subject is recuperating.  
  Unknown - Not known, not observed, not recorded or subject refused. 
 The investigator should report the action taken with the test article due to the AE according 
to the following categories:  
Dose Not Changed  - An indication that a medication schedule was maintained.  
 Dose Increased  - An indication that a medication schedule was modified by 
[CONTACT_60267]; either  by [CONTACT_60268], strength or amount. 
 Dose Reduced  - An indication that a medication schedule was modified by 
[CONTACT_58413], either by [CONTACT_60268], strength or amount.  Drug Interrupted  - An indication that a medication schedule was modified by 
[CONTACT_229782] a prescribed regimen of medication.  
 Drug Withdrawn  - An indication that a medication schedule was modified through 
termination of a prescribed regimen of medication.  
 Not Applicable  - Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context.

its pharmacological action or may be unpredictable in its occurrence.  
 A suspected adverse reaction  is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the event.   For the purposes of IND (and other national health authority)  safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.   An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the in vestigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic 
enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are n ot specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
14.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An event that is serious must be recorded on the AE CRF and on the CRO SAE Report Form, and requires expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements.  An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_28216], it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death.  
• Life-threatening event.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  • Is an important medical event - defined as a medical event(s) that may not result in 
death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient/subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. Examp les of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 Events NOT considered to be SAEs are: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28217], which was elective or pre -planned, of a pre -
existing condition that did not worsen, and 
• Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis, for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of “serious” given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. 
 
AEs classified as “serious” by [CONTACT_794053]. All serious 
AEs, whether related or unrelated to test article, must be immediately reported by 
[CONTACT_28262], in the event that he/she is unavailable, to the 
Project Manager listed on the first page of the protocol.  Written notification of all SAEs 
should be sent to the Project Manager by [CONTACT_28263]. These 
include those SAEs listed in the protocol or investigator brochure and must include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.   
 Study endpoints that are SAEs (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be reported in accordance 
with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In this case, the investi gator must immediately 
report the event to the Sponsor. In addition, such information should also be provided to the site’s respective IRB per their governing guidelines for SAE reporting.   If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. Should the 
investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to test article) that occurs within [ADDRESS_1094943] be reported in accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. In the event of death, if an autopsy is performed, a copy of the report should be sent to the CRO, if available.  As required, the CRO will notify participating investigators of all suspected adverse reactions that are serious and unexpected. This notification will be in the form of an IND (and other national health authority) safety report of potential serious risks as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor determines that the information is “reportable” according to the criteria listed in 21 CFR Section 312.32. These are:

analyses, or other clinical studies that suggest a significant risk in humans 
exposed to the test articles,  
iii) Findings from animal or in vitro tests that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the test articles or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure, and 
iv) Clinically important inc reases in the rate of occurrence of serious suspected 
adverse reactions.  
 Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB will determine if the informed 
consent/assent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB procedures for reporting any other safety information. Where required, submission of safety updates by [CONTACT_428].  
14.3 Pregnancy  
WOCBP (see Section 5.1 for definition) must have a negative UPT prior to study 
enrollment and must use a highly effective method of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failur e is minimized. Prior to study enrollment, 
WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. The subject and parent/guardian must sign an informed consent/assent form documenting this discussion. 
 
During the study, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_229784] (e.g., missed or late menstrual period).  
 WOCBP enrolling into the study must have a pregnancy test prior to study therapy, and at EOS. The study therapy must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are known, and a negative UPT must be confirmed to continue in the trial. If pregnancy is confirmed during screening, the subject must not receive test article and must not be enrolled in the study.  If a subject or investigator suspects that a subject may be pregnant at any time during the study, the test article must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not apply further test article and must be discontinued from the study.  If following initiation of study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a trial subject 
was pregnant or may ha ve been pregnant at the time of test article exposure, the investigator 
must immediately notify the Medical Monitor of this event, and record the pregnancy on 
the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form. The form will be sent to the CRO. The

Other appropriate pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated, 
including counseling of the subject by [CONTACT_28266] (e.g., obstetrician). In addition, the investigator must report to the CRO, on the appropriate CRO pregnancy surveillance form(s), any follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Although pregnancy itself is not an AE, any complications during pregnancy should be recorded as AEs (or SAEs, if they fulfill the SAE criteria). Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous should be reported as an SAE. Offspring should be followed for a minimum of eight weeks. Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a subject exposed to the test article(s) should be recorded as an SAE and details documented in the pregnancy surveillance form.  
15. BLINDING/UNBLINDING

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  17. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
17.1 Sample Size  
For large samples, the two -sided confidence interval for a single proportion extends a 
distance ω=𝑧𝑧1−𝛼𝛼
2�𝜋𝜋(1−𝜋𝜋 )
𝑛𝑛 from the observed proportion in both directions. An incidence 
no greater than 1% of important AEs out of 100 subjects will provide the estimate of no 
greater than a 3% prevalence of im portant AEs at the 95% confidence level with a much 
larger number of subjects exposed for the same duration (i.e., 12 months). Applying the same approach, an incidence no greater than 1% of important AEs out of 300 subjects will provide the estimate of no greater than a 2.1% prevalence of important AEs at the 95% 
confidence level with a much larger number of subjects exposed for the same duration (i.e., 6 months). 
 Approximately six hundred (600) subjects will be enrolled in order to have 300 subjects on-study at 6 months and 100 subjects on- study at 12 months. These treatment durations 
include the 0 or 3 months of active treatment in the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491] (CB -03-01/25 
and CB-03-01/26). 
17.2 Endpoints  
17.2.1  Safety Endpoints  
Safety endpoints will include: 
• Incidence of any local and systemic treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs).  
• Number of subjects with presence (and severity) of each individual LSR 
(telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, scaling/dryness, 
stinging/burning, and pruritus) for each trea tment area, as applicable, at each time 
point collected (Baseline, and LTF -Months 1, 3, 6, and 9, and any Unscheduled 
Visits).  
• UPT results in all WOCBP at Baseline, LTF -Month 6, and EOS. 
17.2.2  Efficacy Endpoints 
Efficacy Endpoints will include: 
• Number of subjects with each IGA severity score for each treatment area, as 
applicable, at each time point collected (Baseline and LTF -Months 1, 3, 6, and 9). 
17.3 Statistical Methods  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. Summar y 
tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for baseline variables, efficacy variables, and safety variables. Continuous variables will be described by [CONTACT_9086] (n, mean, standard deviation, CV%, minimum, median, and

 Subjects who complete [ADDRESS_1094946] article (CB -03-01 cream, 1%) dosing per protocol will count towards the desired 
[ADDRESS_1094947] article. The intent -to-treat (ITT) 
set will include all enrolled subjects . The per -protocol (PP) set will be a subset of the ITT 
set and will include subjects who completed the study without any significant protocol deviations. The analysis of safety will be conducted on the Safety set. The analysis of efficacy will be conducte d on both the ITT and PP sets. 
17.3.[ADDRESS_1094948] article used (grams applied) will be calculated for each subject from the weights of the returned test articles. The mean daily amount of test 
article applied (total amount of test article used/number of days of treatment) will be calculated for each subject. The number of applications and days dosed for each tr eatment 
area (face and/or trunk from Subject Diary) will also be summarized.  
 
Local Skin Reactions (LSRs)  
LSRs (telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, scaling/dryness, stinging/burning, and pruritus) will be summarized by [CONTACT_794054], separately.

closure, containing [ADDRESS_1094965] number (carried over from Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397] [CB -03-01/25 or CB -03-01/26]) 
and provided with sufficient test article in standard packaging for the designated treatment 
period during the study.  
Tube Labels  
Each tube will contain, at a minimum, the following information: the study/protocol numbe r, subject identifiers (e.g., subject number [to be filled in]), the contents, the tube 
number (to be filled in) with test article batch number), an investigational test article disclaimer (e.g., Caution: New Drug Limited by [CONTACT_120906]), and the appropriate storage conditions for the test article. 
A 3.[ADDRESS_1094966] be dispensed only to study subjects and only at study sites specified on the form FDA 1572 (or other documents required by [CONTACT_794062]) by [CONTACT_202413].  Sufficient test article will be provided to each subject as needed for the designated treatment period. For those subjects with clear facial acne and no truncal acne at Baseline (Visit 4 -LTF), the test a rticle will NOT be dispensed and the subject will be reassessed at 
Visit 5 or earlier (after an unscheduled visit), if acne worsens (be it on the face and/or the trunk) before Visit 5.  As test article is dispensed and collected at clinic visits, tubes will be weighed to the nearest tenth gram (0.1 gram) and information should be recorded on the Study Medication Accountability Log. If treatment is discontinued on the face and trunk, all containers of the test article should be collected. If treatment is re -instated, sufficient test article will be 
dispensed to the subject; previously returned test article should NOT be re -dispensed, 
rather new containers of the test article will be dispensed as needed to the subject. Every effort to obtain the return of all dispensed tubes of the test article should be made. If these 
efforts fail, the reason should be recorded on the drug accountability CRF and a detailed note of the reason for failure should be made in the source documents.

according to the assessment of the investigator for each respective treatment area.  If skin irritation or rash develops, subject should discontinue use and contact [CONTACT_3452]. In the event that the inves tigator believes dose modification is necessary due to tolerability

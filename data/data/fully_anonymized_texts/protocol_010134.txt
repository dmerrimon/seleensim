 PROTOCOL OVERVIEW  
In this study we plan to offer SARS -CoV- 2 screening tests at up to 62 selected US Renal Care 
dialysis in order to: reduce transmission, and detect early cases and prevent serious illness. This clinical trial is part of the NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Underserved Populations 
(NIH -RADx -UP) initiative (https://radx -up.org/about/
), whose goal is to improve access to 
COVID-[ADDRESS_246829] an 8-fold higher risk for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478] 15 -fold higher risk for death from COVID -19 compared with the 
general population.  Patients receiving dialysis also disproportionately belong to racial/ethnic minority and economically disadvantaged groups. Thus the goals of this project are to increase availability of highly sensitive and specific testing for SARS- CoV- 2 infection in a medically 
vulnerable and disadvantaged population.   
Approach : 
 This is a pragmatic cluster (facility -level) randomized clinical trial to test the patient 
level acceptability of two strategies for offering test-based screening  at  the dialysis facility. We 
will be offering ante rior nares, rtPCR tests at a static frequency  (arm 1) versus a dynamic 
frequency anchored to county COVID-19 spread (ar m 2). After a pi[INVESTIGATOR_206960], we plan 
to scale up the study to up to 62 dialysis facilities within US Renal Care. Ascend Clinical 
Laboratory will provide testing suppli es, process testing, and return results to facilities. Abbott 
Molecular will provide supplies for the Alinity m SARS -CoV -2 rtPCR assay (approved under 
FDA EUA) at discounted costs. Stanford University will lead study design, data analysis, and dissemination of results.  
Arm 1 —Static frequency: selected facilities will offer testing once every two weeks to all 
patients coming to dialysis  
Arm 2 —Dynamic frequency: selected facilities will offer testing  to all patients coming to 
dialysis  once a week if county COVID-19 spread is high, once every two weeks if county 
COVID-19 spread is low or moderate, and once a month if COVID-19 spread is minimal or eliminated.   
Intervention time frame: 3 months  
We will assess the following outcomes:

3 Facility level Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206961] a highly acceptable universal testing strategy for patients receiving dialysis and prevent serious complications from SARS -CoV-2 by [CONTACT_206985].   
  
Protocol for SARS -COV -2 Screening in Dialysis Facilities  | v3 
[ADDRESS_246831] impaired immune responses to viral infections and vaccinations. 
Universal testing offered at hemodialysis facilities could shield this vulnerable population from 
exposure, enable early identification and tre atment for those affected, and reduce transmission to 
other patients and family members.  
2.1 Patients receiving dialysis are an underserved, medically vulnerable 
population   
The average patient on dialysis in the US is between 65-74 years old and has advanced diabetes 
causing kidney failure(1). Among patients on hemodialysis, 47% have diabetes as the primary cause ESKD, 62% have cardiovascular disease, and 32% have heart failure. Patients receiving dialysis are also disproportionately from racial/ethnic minority groups (1, 2) . One striking pi[INVESTIGATOR_206962]: 12% of 
persons in the US self -identify as Black; in contrast, 30% of patients on dialysis are Black . 
Thirty -five percent of patients on dialysis in the US live in poor neighborhoods (i.e., 
neighborhoods with 20% of persons living below the federal poverty line) (3). In a seminal 
analysis, Volkova et al.(4)  determined that persons living in poor neighborhoods had 3 to 5- fold 
higher likelihood of incident ESKD (compared with neighborhoods with < 5% of persons living 
below the poverty line), with larger risks experienced by [CONTACT_206986].  
Requirement for in -ce nter visits to complete dialysis can amplify the risk for SARS -CoV-2 
transmission within the facility and in the community (5). Patients wear masks but may need to 
take them off to ingest prescribed medications and nutritional supplements; they have 
interactions in lobbies with friends on dialysis, often their only social interaction of the day . As 
with the rest of the US population, 40% of patients receiving dialysis with SARS -CoV -2 
infection may be asymptomatic (6), potentiating the risk for transmission. Corbett et al. (5) report 
from the [LOCATION_006] that dialysis facility characteristics such as distance between dialysis chairs, waiting room size, and staff symptomatic illness all correlated with facility COVID -[ADDRESS_246832] case scenario: a highly comorbid, 
elderly and socially disadvantaged population, with impaired immune responses and frailty, sharing small indoor spaces for prolonged periods.(7, 8)  
2.2 Patients receiving dialysis face  high risk for death & hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206963]- 19 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) data indicate that patients receiving dialysis have the highest rate of COVID -19 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206964], 8- fold higher than 
population average(9). Early on in the pandemic, nearly one third of patients who were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19 in [LOCATION_001](10) died. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_206965], a 
nationwide analysis continues to estimate mortality rates exceeding 20%(11), and CMS data 
continue to report high numbers of excess deaths. In addition to the innate factors of older age, comorbidity, and clustering, there has been also “renal- ism” in use of treatments (12, 13). For 
Protocol for SARS -COV -2 Screening in Dialysis Facilities  | v3

 example, remedesivir—an early promising therapy—was considered ‘contra-indicated’ in 
ESKD, although any concerns for a theoretical risk from its carrier had been previously debunked(14, 15).  
2.[ADDRESS_246833] recurrent ‘outbreaks’ of COVID -19 extending into 2025 if infection or 
vaccination does not result in sustained immunity (16-20) . Boosters, and requirements thereof for 
subsets of the population are as -yet uncertain, but it is becoming clear that a sizeable portion of 
patients on dialysis (21- 23), patients on immunosuppression(24), and other subgroups(25) have 
impaired responses to vaccination. Prior data on vaccination in the dialysis population 
corroborates emerging data (26, 27). In multiple prospective studies of Hepatitis B, only 60 -70% 
of vaccinated patients receiving dialysis mounted a sufficient response and, of these, 40% lost 
immunity within 1 -3 years(28, 29).  In influenza studies, one focused on H1N1 strain alone(30) 
and one(31) on trivalent vaccine including H1N1 strain, 57% and 46% of patients receiving dialysis mounted sufficient titers to be considered immune to H1N1 at 4 weeks, compared with 90% or more of healthy volunteers. Patients receiving dialysis will likely face exce ss risk for 
COVID-[ADDRESS_246834] as they do for influenza(32) despi[INVESTIGATOR_206966].  
2.[ADDRESS_246835] of patients’ lives. Evidence from other 
settings suggests that universal screening in a clustered popu lation dramatically improves the 
detection rate. For example, a universal screening protocol implemented in 11 nursing home facilities led to a 3 -fold higher detection of SARS- CoV-2(33) (34, 35) . Similar data (of only two 
secondary transmissions) were reported from a boarding school implementing universal rtPCR testing (36). Thus, universal screening has the potential to save lives in high- risk, clustered 
populations .  
Since dialysis facilities are staffed by [CONTACT_206987], technicians, dieticians, and social workers, dialysis facilities can also serve as a conduit for the provision of primary health care to patients receiving dialysis and for mitigation of risks for SARS -CoV-2. Many foundational 
primary care interventions, including vaccines, diabetic foot checks, and social support 
assessments, occur at the dialysis facility, which many patients consider as their ‘medical home.’ 
Facilities are partnered with central laboratories, with processes in place for rapid specimen shipment and results return in the electronic medical record. Most importantly facilities stock monoclonal antibodies. Data from patients treated with bamalanivimab at US Renal Care suggest dramatic improvements in requirement for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206967] 15% among 40 patients receiving the antibody, compared with 57% among patients on dialysis with COVID-19 matched for age, sex, self -reported race, and diabetes status(37). The two other large dialysis 
organizations reported <10% hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206968](37) .

 Mina and Anderson present a framework for selecting and applying testing strategies based on 
the health scenario. Patients on dialysis require testing for both “personal health” (given their high vulnerability) and “public health” (given the risk for trans mission) indications (38).  
 TRIAL OBJECTIVES  
3.[ADDRESS_246836] this hypothesis by [CONTACT_206988] a static (every two weeks) 
frequency (arm 1 ) or offering testing at a dynamic frequency tied to community COVID-19 
rates. Among the two arms, we will assess differences in:  
 
1) Primary outcome  (assessed during the three-month period of the intervention) : Proportion 
of offered tests accepted: # of times individuals respond yes / total # of times individuals are asked to perform the test during the 3 -month period of the intervention  
3.2 To evaluate effectiveness of the SARS -CoV -2 testing strategies in  patients 
receiving dialysis  
We will evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the two testing strategies by [CONTACT_206989]:

3) Deaths  
3.3 Determine risk factors for serious illness with COVID- 19 among patients 
receiving dialysis   
By [CONTACT_206990]-19 during the study, we 
will be able to determine risk factors for serious illness requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. This will further enable identification of the subgroup requiring aggressive and early therapy with antivirals or monoclonal antibodies.  
 STUDY ORGANIZATION 
4.1 Collaborating Institutions  
Key investigators are outlines in below figure. Three organization s will work integrall y: study 
design input will come from Stanford, followed by [CONTACT_4676]- facing implementation at US Renal 
Care facilities with laboratory support from Ascend Clinical Laboratory. Stanford University investigators are physicians, epi[INVESTIGATOR_187543], health policy experts, statisticians, and clinical trialists who are well qualified to design and implement the proposed study, with established 
Protocol for SARS -COV -2 Screening in Dialysis Facilities  | v3 
[ADDRESS_246837] of research, handling protected health information (PHI), and study 
analysis. US Renal Care is a for profit dialysis network with over 350+ nationwide dialysis facilities, and actively participates in multiple clinical trials and epi[INVESTIGATOR_206969].  Finally Ascend Clinical is a CLIA -certified, high 
throughput clinical laboratory specializing in testing for patients receiving dialysis; this laboratory processes more th an 2 million  tests per month.   
US Renal Care and Ascend  Clinical will transfer data with limited protected health information 
(PHI) to Stanford University. Stanford University investigators will be responsible for data preparation, analysis, and transfer to NIH RADx- UP. The  “Rapid Acceleration for Diagnostics 
Program (RADx) Institutional Certification ” for studies using data generated for the RADx 
program, is located in the Appendix. In addition, Abbott Molecular will discount the anterior 
nares rtPCR testing kits and associated supplies (Alinity m SARS -CoV- 2 assay).

 4.2 Role of RADx -UP 
The NIH RADx -UP consortium (https://radx -up.org/about/ ) is funded by [CONTACT_206991]. The goal of the consortium is to engage community and academic partnerships to expand availability of SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_246838] and share data on a set of “Common Data Elements”: https://radx -
up.org/learning- resources/cdes/ .  
Furthermore,  studies receive support in terms of translation, materials to enhance test uptake, and 
logistical support for procuring tests.  
 
 STUDY DESIGN 
5.1 Study Overview  
We plan a pragmatic cluster randomized clinical trial at the dialysis facility -level. We will 
compare rtPCR SARS -CoV- 2 screening performed at a static (every two weeks) frequency 
versus a dynamic frequency (ranging from once a week to once every four weeks) anchored to county COVID- 19 case rates among patient dialyzing at up to 62 facilities within US Renal Care  
(Figure 1 ). This design builds on a recently supported NIDDK initiative – the pragmatic facility -
based cluster randomized trial. The Time to reduce Mortality in  End-stage Kidney Disease 
(TiME) trial (https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/30/5/890/tab- article -info) showcased the ability 
of dialysis facilities to provide accurate and complete clinical data for exposures and  outcomes 
(death and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]), the willingness of >99% of patients to participate in and share clinical data using an 'opt out' consent, and feasibility of implementation without on- site research 
staff.   

Protocol for SARS -COV -2 Screening in Dialysis Facilities  | v3

 Anterior nares rtPCR SARS -CoV- 2 tests will be offered to all patients in the  selected facilities 
(at a frequency decided by [CONTACT_206992]). Patients may decline tests at any time 
during the 3- month study period. We will record test acceptance (primary outcome of the study). 
If a participant accepts the test, results will be relayed back to the patient and the facility within [ADDRESS_246839] facility procedures: asymptomatic persons wil l be advised to quarantine and will be isolated during dialysis to 
prevent further transmission, and symptomatic persons will be considered for antiviral therapy or referral to higher level of care based on the most updated Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention guidelines. 
After study completion, in addition to clinical data from the electronic health record,  responses to 
the In -Center Hemodialysis Consumer Assessment of Healthcare (ICH CAHPS)  of patients 
dialyzing at participating facilities will be tracked. Since participants are familiar with this 
survey and it is mandated to be implemented biannually, its use fits within the pragmatic 
framework of the trial.

5.[ADDRESS_246843] acceptability. Briefly, we followed formulas given by [CONTACT_206993] (2000) for the design of cluster randomized trials comparing probabilities for two groups with an adjustment for the clust ered design (Variance

 Inflation Factor) by [CONTACT_206994]. Assuming a type I error of 𝛼𝛼 = 0.05, 80% power ( 𝛽𝛽= 0.2 ), 
a test acceptability proportion equal to 0.4 in the static arm and 0.65 in the dynamic arm – corresponding to a 25% absolute difference, a high degree of correlation between patients within 
the same facility (Interclass correlation coefficient, ICC=0.5), and that we will be able to recruit 
~40 patients per facility (median number of patients per facility at US Renal), we will require [ADDRESS_246844] 25% for 
acceptability rates in the static arm ranging from 10% to 60%.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_246845] been demonstrated to correlate with clinical case 
data during the COVID-19 pandemic (Wolfe 2021, Karthikeyan 2021, Graham 2021, Huisman 2022). We will combine disease surveillance estimates based on wastewater samples with community surveillance data from the CDC to monitor current epi[INVESTIGATOR_206972].  
Using data from the preceding week, we will establish testing frequency for each facility for a period of four weeks.  Facilities with high, medium, and low evidence of community  COVID-19 
transmission will be assigned to once weekly, once every two weeks, and once every four weeks testing respectively. After each four- week intervention period, facilities will be assigned a new 
testing strategy based on the current county level of COVID-19 transmission.  
The data that will inform the facility assignment to testing strategies will be:  
1)  SARS -CoV -2 RNA wastewater percent ile levels  
Or  
2) Number of new cases per 100,000 persons Or 
3) Number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8800] 100,000 persons 
Protocol for SARS -COV -2 Screening in Dialysis Facilities  | v3 
13 
 
 High, medium and low evidence of community COVID -19 transmission will be determined by 
[CONTACT_094]-defined thresholds in these indicators (Table 1). If indicators suggest different transmission 
levels, the highest level is selected, with facilities falling into th e highest frequency of testing 
when any one of the indicator criteria are met.  
If at any given time during the trial, 95% of facilities do not meet criteria for high frequency testing then facilities will be assigned to testing frequency strategies using trial -wide tertiles of 
current COVID -19 incidence.

5.[ADDRESS_246847] University investigators can generate reports about 
performance of participating facilities. These reports will be provided to the dialysis provider organization research teams who,  in turn, can communicate with clinical leadership at the

practice at all dialysis units. Accordingly, members of the multi- disciplinary care teams in 
dialysis units are trained to pay close attention to adherence these protocols. The multi -
disciplinary teams will be encouraged to review adherence to rtPCR testing protocols 1) during routine monthly multidisciplinary care rounds, 2) during routine monthly quality improvement meetings, or 3) through direct communication from the trial project managers to the dialysis unit clinical leadership.

 PARTICIPANT ENROLLMENT  
In this cluster randomized trial, potential participants will be patients dialyzing at selected US 
Renal Care facilities. In considering informed consent for our study, there are three major components ( Figure 2) :  
 
1. A s
urvey of RADx -UP Common Data Elements  which covers topi[INVESTIGATOR_206979]-
[ADDRESS_246851]  (i.e., the intervention) at a frequency dictated by 
[CONTACT_206997]  
3. The sharing of li mited PHI clinical electronic health record data with the study team  to 
assess outcomes  
 T
here will be 2 research information sheets associated with the study: Research Information 
Sheet – Trial will cov er the overall study design and all three components (Appendix A) . 
Research Information Sheet – Survey will be specifically shared prior to the electronic RADx -
UP survey (Appendix B).   
Following the precedent of the pragmatic TiME trial, which was conducted under waiver of 
consent (see Dember et al JASN May 2019, 30 5 890-903; DOI: 
https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.[PHONE_4449]), we request waiver of consent for components 2&3. 
The detailed TiME trial rationale for waiving consent is attached to this IRB application. The TiME trial showcased the willingness of patients to share clinical data for the purposes of research, as >99%  of enrolled patients allowed data sharing.

 6.1 Rationale for Waiver of Informed Consent  
 
6.1.1 The intervention involves no more than minimal risk  
All three components of the study are considered no more than minimal risk because:  
i) the intervention consists of a SARS -CoV- [ADDRESS_246852] offered at varying frequency, 
which is being routinely administered in many settings in the [LOCATION_002] (including in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], schools, offices and airports) as well as in many other countries, without informed consent. Patients may opt out of taking the offered test at any time . 
ii)  There are minimal to no safety concerns related to SARS -CoV- 2 screening tests. The 
selected SARS -CoV- 2 screening tests (the Abbott Alinity rtPCR test) has a positive and 
negative agreement rate of 100% and level of detection 100 virus copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL. Thus, we expect minimal false positive or false negative result rates.  
iii) The NIH mandated RADx -UP survey is a validated instrument currently employed  across 
more than [ADDRESS_246853] number as available, i t will be accompanied by a 
clear research information sheet identifying the PHI data components  in simple language. 
The research sheet will also explain to the patient how identifiable information will be stored and managed separately from anonymized data, and clearly explains in simple 
terms the processes for privacy protection.  
iv) Electronic health record dat a obtained from US Renal Care will be anonymized with a 
limited PHI obtained zip  code of dialysis facility, dates of SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_246854] the 
opportunity to ‘opt out’ of sharing any clinical data by [CONTACT_206998] a designated member of their care team likely to be  the dialysis nurse  at any point dur ing the study. 
Working with the US Renal Care clinical research  coordinator, any patients deemed by 
[CONTACT_206999] ‘opt out’  consent will be eliminated 
from the dataset.  Any patients requesting to opt out will also be eliminated from the 
dataset.  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_246855] the rights and welfare of 
the participants  
All patients already dialyzing at selected facilities will receive Research Information Sheet – Trial explaining the study aims and design, including information about opting out of testing and 
anonymized data sharing. P atients initiating dialysis treatment at a participating facility during 
the time period of the study will be provided with the Research Information Sheet – Trial at the time they start dialysis . The screening tests will be offered without any mandate to  the 
participant. P atients will be pro vided with an opportunity to opt  out of electronic health record 
data sharing. No changes will be made to current dialysis facility standards of care around the COVID- 19 pandemic.

gleaned from such a study will not be informative of the real -world effect of offering SARS -
CoV- [ADDRESS_246857] -based screening in dialysis facilities.  
Furthermore, to generate information valid nationally and enriched with information from the underserved populations, we plan to enroll up to 62 facilities throughout the US Renal Care 
Network, including those in remote areas (e.g., Alaska). We also plan a short and synchronous time period —3 months —in order to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_206980]- [ADDRESS_246858] available study 
personnel for informed consent across all selected facilities, covering all potential patient interface times (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 5 am-  9 pm, 7 days a week).     
Two research information sheets --one for  the overall trial, one tied to  the specific electronic 
survey-- will be distributed and will cover the typi[INVESTIGATOR_206981]. 
Requiring signed consent will make this minimal risk study infeasible.  
 
6.1.4 For research using identifiable private information or identifiable 
biospecimens, the research  could not practicably be carried out without using such 
information or biospecimens in an  identifiable format  
For participants who opt to take the NIH RADx -UP Common Data Elements survey , they will 
be requested to share following PHI elements:  
• Name  
• Date of birth  
• Address, including zip code  
• Email  
• Medical record number   
• COVID- [ADDRESS_246859]  on all patients in the participating facilities.    
Protocol for SARS -COV -2 Screening in Dialysis Facilities  | v3

 • Patient residence zipcode  
• Dates of SARS -CoV- 2 screening tests offered and resulted  
• Dates of COVID- 19 vaccination  
• COVID- 19 dates  
• Dialysis facility USRC ID and zip code  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], dates and admission and discharge diagnosis as applicable  
• Death, dates and cause as applicable  
• Transfer out of facility date as applicable  
This limited PHI dataset is required to track test results, facilitate appropriate care, and enable 
assessment of key secondary outcomes (cases, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602],  and deaths). This outcome 
assessment will help to generate a model for surveillance of COVID- [ADDRESS_246860] the underserved population should opportunities for additional interventions arise (e.g., among participants expressing vaccine hesitancy). Participants will receive detailed information about data protection for their identifiable health information, including that these data will be kept in a separate repository hosted o nly at the RADx -UP CDCC and the initial project site 
(Stanford University). Stanford University also requires limited PHI data from patients at the selected facilities in order to assess key secondary outcomes (detected cases, deaths, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) that will factor into determining the effectiveness of the intervention. We will 
offer patients the option to ‘opt out’ of inclusion in this limited PHI dataset, although we expect few will take this option  based on the precedence of the TiME trial.  
 
6.2.2 The research cannot be practically conducted without the waiver 
This pragmatic intervention will be implemented across up to 62 facilities over a short time 
frame. The goal is to develop a scalable system that can be integrated within clinical care. For

[ADDRESS_246861] extent feasible . Furthermore,  the RADx -UP data coordinating center 
has developed processes for separating identifiable information and anonymizing the remaining 
data so as to enable wider use while minimizing risks to patient privacy.  Finally the RADx -UP 
Common Data Elements survey is an ‘opt in’ process, thus patients can chose not to participate or provide protected health information as they take the survey.   
The risks for participants for the opt out electronic health record data sharing process are low 
since data shared with Stanford University will not be traceable back to the participant.  
 
 TRIAL IMPLEMENTATION  
Below we outline trial implementation according to anticipated chronological timeline.  
7.[ADDRESS_246862] responsible for facility -level 
operations. The governing body typi[INVESTIGATOR_206971] (nephrologist), facility 
manager, and members of the nursing or social work teams. This governing body meets monthly to review facility data on census, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], regulatory reviews etc. Among the selected facilities, we will review study goals and procedures for the selected facilities. The governing body can request to opt out of the study.  
7.2 RADx -UP Survey   
Among participating facilities, Research Information Sheet – Trial will be provided to all 
patients dialyzing at the facility, and to new patients during their admission process to the facility. Patient facing flyers, in English and Spanish, will be posted throughout the facility, advertising the opportunity for participation in the RADx -UP Common Data Elements survey 
(Appendix C). For patients expressing interest, they will be able to follow a web address on their smart phone or use the facility iPAD to ac cess the survey. The survey will begin with Research 
Information Sheet – Survey, and among those proceeding, we expect a ~30- minute survey 
(Appendix X for Common Data Elements Survey). Data from this survey will be stored on Stanford University’s PHI secure servers, accessible to Stanford PIs, analysts and statisticians only. Data will be downloaded, cleaned, and submitted to the NIH RADx -UP Data Coordinating 
Center (see Section X, Data management)

 7.3 Randomization  
We will sort US Renal Care facility ID numbers by [CONTACT_207000]. Within US census region ( Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) and facility size strata (< median or >=median 
size), we will randomly select two facilities per county, oversampling by 30%.  
7.4 Intervention: SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_246863], facility staff will use the 
following PPE surgical face mask, gloves, gown and eye protection. He/she will perform the anterior nares test following CDC guidelines (
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-
nCoV/lab/guidelines- clinical -specimens.html ) for anterior nares swab:  
Anterior nasal specimen (performed by a healthcare provider or the patient after reviewing and 
following the collection instructions): 
• Insert the entire collection tip of the swab provided (usually ½ to ¾ of an inch, or 1 to 1.5 
cm) inside the nostril.  
• Firmly sample the nasal wall by [CONTACT_207001] a circular path against the nasal wall at least 4 times.  
• Take approximately [ADDRESS_246864] any nasal drainage that may be present on the swab. 
• Repeat in the other nostril using the same swab. 
• Place swab, tip first, into the transport tube provided.  
Staff will then follow standard procedures including labeling and batch shipment to Ascend Clinical Laboratory at the end of the day. The intervention of testing will be offered for a period of three months.     
7.[ADDRESS_246865] monthly laboratory testing performed, while 
undergoing dialysis a nd without requiring needlestick/phlebotomy. The monthly laboratory tests  
are standard of care and  inform dialysis prescription and medication changes (e.g., hemoglobin

expected time frame of < 48 hours (i.e., prior to the return of the patient to the facility for dialysis ).  
7.[ADDRESS_246868] processes for notification of facilities of ‘critical results’ are already in place, due to the 
extant clinical partnership between US Renal Care and Ascend Clinical Laboratory. As part of this study, any positive SARS -CoV- [ADDRESS_246869]  (PHI is

Data Coordinating Center (Duke Clinical Research Institute), who will store data in  
two separate files, one hosting all identifiable information and one with anonymized  
data. These data will stay in a password -protected secure electronic system and only  
staff responsible for maintaining the security of data at Stanford University and the  
RADx -UP DCC will be able to access this information. If applicable these data will be  
linked with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services claims data to enable  
further research into outcomes. If the participant permits, these data will also be  
used to contact [CONTACT_207003].  
 
7.8.[ADDRESS_246871]  
Each patient at a selected dialysis facility will be assigned a unique (random) research 
identification number . This ID number will be associated with all participant data  
that are collected, entered, and analyzed for the study. If a pa tient is identified by [CONTACT_207004]/or if he/she selects to  
opt out of the limited PHI data sharing, he/she will not receive this research ID  
number. If the opt out selection occurs during the trial, the research ID will be  
eliminated from future data sharing processes.  
The link between participants’ names and study ID numbers will be kept in a separate electronic file on secure US Renal Care  servers . US Renal Care will  ensur e that all data prepared for 
analysis are anonymized, prior to transfer to Stanford University Investigators .  
Protocol for SARS -COV -2 Screening in Dialysis Facilities  | v3

 7.9 Data extraction and transfer procedures  
 For the purposes of this study data will be collected using two methods: a) by [CONTACT_207005] -UP survey 
and b) through limited PHI data extraction from electronic health records . 
 
7.9.[ADDRESS_246872] University School of Medicine servers. A log (saved in REDcap) will be maintained to track when, and by [CONTACT_207006] (including what data are downloaded and for what specific purpose). Only study staff at Stanford University will have download access. Study staff will subsequently clean and upload the data to RADx -UP Data 
Coordinating Center (Duke Clinical Research Institute) servers.  
 
7.9.[ADDRESS_246873] (data elements specified under 6.7.). Patients participating in the study will be identified using their research identification number. US Renal Care will collate the selected data fields for each research ID from the electronic health record, and transfer anonymized data to Stanford University using a secure data pi[INVESTIGATOR_206982]. Only study sta ff at Stanford University will have access to the data.  
7.[ADDRESS_246874] (# of times individuals respond yes / total # of times individuals are asked to perform the test) in the static versus dynamic testing frequency arms. We will use a log -binomial model 
predicting the probability of acceptability (Y ) from intervention arm applying a generalized 
estimating equation (GEE) approach to take into account the clustering by [CONTACT_207007]. A  similar method will be used for estimating the effect of 
the intervention on the outcome of death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Alternatively, we will use a frailty model which allows for a survival analysis of heterogeneous populations due to the clustering within  facilities and multiple observations for each individual(46).  
 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
We do not anticipate serious complications from the implementation of this pragmatic study.  
We identified the following potential risks: loss of privacy and possibility of a false positive  or 
negative result. We have significant experience and will put in place rigorous processes for 
protecting patient- level identifiable health information, including by:  
1) using HIPAA and PHI secure electronic platform to undertake the RADx-UP Common 
Data Elements, eliminating the need for paper forms   
Protocol for SARS -COV -2 Screening in Dialysis Facilities  | v3 
24 
 
 2) storing and transferring data on HIPAA and PHI secure servers  
3) separating PHI containing files from other anonymized data, and rendering strict password protection on PHI containing files   
The possibility of a false positive  or negative  result is minimized by [CONTACT_207008] , which 
is the best available testing technology .  Another important protocol we will put in place for 
patient safety is to  ensur e appropriate notification and triage of positive results. Standard 
processes for a potentially time sensitive test result  already exist, due to the extant clinical 
partnership between Ascend Clinical Laboratory and US Renal Care, in which Ascend Clinical Laboratory notifies facilities about positive results. All positive results will be returned as ‘critical’ results, which under standard processes require that Ascend Clinical Coordinators make at least two attempt to reach dialysis facility RNs to relay results. As a failsafe the US Renal Care project manager  will be notified if dialysis facility RN cannot be reached.  After a pi[INVESTIGATOR_206983], these workflows will be reviewed and revised by [CONTACT_207009], the US Renal Care Associate Medical Officer, Ascend Clinical Chief Operating Officer, and the US Renal Care project manager.    
Prior to the start of the study, we will form a Data Safety and Monitoring Board consisting of faculty with nephrology, health policy, and clinical trial expertise. This DSMB will review patient facing materials, study procedures including procedures for n otification to patient and 
facility of a positive result, and data extraction and transfer processes. The Board will meet after 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_206984] [ADDRESS_246875] availability to our medically vulnerable population of patients receiving dialysis.

 EXIT SURVEY  
 
In order to assess the feasibility and acceptability of this pragmatic trial on a facility level, 
we plan to implement an Exit survey (see Attachment labeled “Exit survey”)  
 The survey will be sent electronically to facility managers,  care coordinators and social workers of the 62 selected facilities participating in the trial. The survey will be anonymous. Participants will be asked to label their facility name, but will not be asked to identify themselves or their roles. Following our prior protocols (see Garcia et al. JASN 2020 J Am Soc Nephrol. 2021 Jul;32(7):1575-1581. doi: 10.1681/ASN.[PHONE_4450]) where we implemented a nationwide survey of COVID19 vaccine acceptability, we will provide detailed information about the goals 
of the survey, and privacy protections prior to start of the survey. Participants will be assumed to have given consent if they proceed with the survey after reviewing this information .  
 We will administer the survey as a link or QR code embedded in an email communication sent from US Renal Care staff. Data will be hosted on HIPPA -protected servers at Stanford 
University; all analyses will conducted within this HIPPA -secure environment as well.

Hello, my name [CONTACT_832]:  ___________________ and I  am from ( circle one :) Nueva

SHARE and I are part of a team that is doing a research study  called “ Nueva Vida Intervention for Latina Breast Cancer 
Survivors and Caregivers ”. This study is being led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kristi Graves at Georgetown University and ( circle Site PI :) 
Margaret Darling, Migdalia Torres, Ivis Febus- Sampayo, Ysabel Duron at ( Circle one:) Nueva Vida; Gilda’s Club NYC; 
SHARE ; Latinas Contra Cancer . We want to learn more about how to improve quality of life for Latina breast cancer 
survivors and their caregivers.

You are being invited to participate in this study because you are Latina breast cancer survivor  or a primary caregiver for 
a Latina breast cancer survivor  and you are between  [ADDRESS_1217586] talk with one of our team members from Geo rgetown on the phone 
who will ask you questions about your experiences [ and your loved one’s experiences] with breast cancer, its treatment 
and how you are feeling now. We will ask a range of questions at different times throughout the study. Then you [and 
your caregiver / and your loved one] would be assigned by [CONTACT_3364] – like the flip of a coin – to either a new program we 
are testing or to any of the usual services here at (circle one :) Nueva Vida; Gilda’s Club NYC; SHARE ; Latinas Contra 
Cancer . You can of course go to any groups or programs that we usually offer whether you want to be in the research 
study or not. Saying “ no” to the study will not take away any of the services you can use here.  The new program we are 
testing is one that has been used at an organization called Nueva Vida in Washington D.C. If you [and your 
caregiver/loved one] get assigned by [CONTACT_871727], you would come to eight workshops here at ( Circle 
one:) Nueva Vida; Gilda’s Club NYC; SHARE ; Latinas Contra Cancer . After about 4 months, we would ask you [and 
your caregiver/loved one] to complete another telephone survey and then a third and final survey in about [ADDRESS_1217587] ways possible. If you decide to be a part of this research study, y ou would be contributing to research that 
may benefit other Latina survivors and their families in the future.

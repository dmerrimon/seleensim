PROTOCOL  SYNOPSIS  
 
Study Title  Proactive Outreach for Smoking Treatment (POST)  
Funder  NIH/NIDA  
Clinical Phase  N/A 
Study Rationale  The US Public Health Service (USPHS) designated tobacco 
dependence as a chronic disease.  This is especially true for smokers 
with serious mental illness (SMI) who make more cessation 
attempts and are less successful sustaining long -term abstinence 
than the general population. There is a significant health disparity 
wherein individuals with SMI have a higher tobacco use prevalence 
and a greater risk for tobacco -related mortality than the general 
population.  Chronic care models suggest chronic disease 
management requires a multidisciplinary care team to assess 
tobacco use, administer treatment, support patient self -management, 
and moni tor progress. Proactive telephone outreach to smokers and 
brief provider interventions are two effective chronic disease 
management strategies.  Community based mental health centers 
(CMHCs) are a primary treatment access point for many smokers 
with SMI.  However, rates of intervention with smoking by [CONTACT_500948].  In order to implement the chronic care model for 
tobacco dependence for CMHCs, comprehensive implementation 
strategies are needed.  
Study Objective(s)  Primary   
• To develop an implementa tion strategy to implement proactive 
tobacco cessation treatment into community mental health 
treatment settings  
Secondary  
• To test the effectiveness of the implementation strategy as 
well as the effectiveness of a proactive tobacco cessation 
treatment strategy.  
 
Test Article(s)  
(If Applicable)  The study intervention combines provider intervention about 
tobacco (asking patients if they use tobacco, advising patients to 
quit, assessing willingness to quit, assisting with quitting via 
counseling or medication or referral for treatment, and arranging for 
follow -up), and proactive outreach (calling smokers in the health 
system and offering treatment).  
Study Design  
 There are  [ADDRESS_645159] Population  
Key Criteria  for 
Inclusion and Exclusion:  Participants will be patients and employees (leadership and clinical 
staff) at two community mental health centers in Minnesota.  
Inclusion criteria for employees are to be on staff at the two 
community mental health center re cruitment sites.  There are no 
exclusion criteria for employees .  Patient inclusion criteria include 
being English -speaking, current smokers (>25 days/month) , patients 
at the community mental health center .  Patient exclusion criteria 
includes judged by [CONTACT_500949] (due to cognitive impairment or any other 
reason), no access to a telephone , no access to an address at which

Study 2 & 3: participants’ mental health providers will be informed 
about their study participation.  If participants note a worsening of 
their mental health symptoms, we will inform their providers, take 
appropriate clinical action if necessary, and evaluate whether this 
change is due to changes in their smoking, and report to the IRB as 
an adverse event.   
Statistical And Analytic 
Plan  Interviews will be coded using deductive and inductive codes.  We 
will then conduct a framework matrix analysis.  We will sum marize 
implementation data with respect to treatment delivery and 
utilization, and patient outcome data.  For patient outcomes, we will 
explore the adjusted effects using a series of generalized linear 
mixed effects models adjusted for potential confounder s, baseline 
values and clustering.

2 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND RATIONALE  
The US Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) designates tobacco dependence 
a chronic disease  because tobacco users require several interventions and make several quit 
attempts over their lifetimes.[ADDRESS_645167] higher relapse rates than smokers without SMI.2-5 There is a significant health 
disparity among individuals with SMI wherein the smoking prevalence is between 44 -66%.5-7 
Individuals with SMI die 15 -25 years earlier than those without, due, in large part (64%),[ADDRESS_645168] to general population declines.5,12-14 One explanation is that 
available treatments are not reaching smo kers with SMI.  
Chronic care management strategies are effective at reducing tobacco use .  Chronic care 
management relies on population -based care to ensure that guideline -consistent interventions reach 
all patients.  The chronic care model15,16 proposes four essential chronic disease management 
activitie s: (1) periodic review of patients’ disease course and management, (2) help for patients to 
self-manage their disease, (3) interventions to optimize disease control, and (4) continuous follow -up 
of patient progress.  Chronic care management requires a mult idisciplinary team, including individuals 
with behavioral treatment skills. The CPG recommends using the 5A’s approach for the management 
of tobacco use.1 Provi ders should Ask all patients’ their smoking status at each visit, Advise  smokers 
to quit, Assess  willingness to quit, Assist  patients in quitting, and Arrange  for follow -up.  “Ask” doubles 
the odds of abstinence, “Advise” increases abstinence by 30% and a 1-3 minute provider -delivered 
intervention increases patient abstinence rates by 40%.[ADDRESS_645169] (EMR) prompts, monthly follow -up of smokers aimed at treatment engagement 
following tobacco cessation treatment, and teleph one care management.15-[ADDRESS_645170] them to tobacco cessation treatment.  
Proactive outreach to patients has bee n found in 3 large -scale pragmatic trials to be more effective 
than addressing smoking solely at medical visits.  In two studies conducted by [CONTACT_15957] -I Fu (preliminary 
studies 1&2), proactive outreach (compared to usual care) resulted in a 5 -6 fold increase in cessation 
counseling utilization, a 2 fold increase in medication use, and a 2 -6 fold increase in patients who 
used both counseling and medication (consistent with CPG recommendations).19,[ADDRESS_645171] trial in VA 
mental health clinics (preliminary study 3) found proactive outreach resulted in a doubling of 
medication utilization, a [ADDRESS_645172] found promising effects of a range of pr ovider interventions including 
brief intervention,28 motivational interviewing,29 group therapy focused on cessation or wellness,30-34 
peer intervention,35,36  intensive individual counseling37 and face to face smoking cessation counseling 
+ smoking cessation care coordination.[ADDRESS_645173] 
~$1.69 per caller.25 Quitline counseling can help smokers with psychiatric diagnoses to quit, for 
example,16% of Quitline callers with a psych iatric diagnosis were abstinent at [ADDRESS_645174] 
enrollment.39 However, quit rates for callers with psychiatric diagnoses were 20% lower than those 
without.  Telephone counseling outcomes are improved with: mental health tailoring,40 when 
combined with care coordination with providers,41 or in-person group counseling.32 In one study, 
mental health tailored telephone counseling was as effective as face -to-face counseling and better 
attended.42 With sufficient dose and mental health tailoring, te lephone cessation counseling is highly 
effective. Telephone counseling and care coordination could be added to brief provider interventions 
to provide patients with the intensity of treatment needed for smokers with SMI.  
Community mental health centers (CM HCs) are an ideal venue to implement chronic care 
management for tobacco dependence.   CMHCs were established by [CONTACT_500950] 1963, which shifted SMI treatment into the community.  CMHCs provide comprehensive 
mental health treat ment, including medication management, case management and counseling.  For 
patients with SMI, CMHCs could be a better place to implement proactive, chronic care management 
for tobacco dependence than primary care.  CMHCs represent the primary treatment ac cess point for 
SMI patients. They comprise a comprehensive treatment team including psychiatric prescribers, case 
managers, and counselors.  Psychiatric prescribers see their patients more often than primary care 
providers and are better equipped to adjust  psychiatric medications following cessation.[ADDRESS_645175] rates of intervention with tobacco use of any healthcare providers.40,44 
Among psychiatrists, rates of intervention with tobacco use are declining.23 The administration of 
smoking cessation treatment is especially low in CMHCs (only 30% of providers discuss smoking with 
at least ha lf their patients annually and providers report low confidence in providing cessation 
interventions).45-47 Provider barriers include: undervaluing tobacco addiction as a problem, lack of 
knowledge of evidence -based treatment,  lack of se lf-efficacy to change patient behavior, competing 
priorities, and required cross -discipline collaboration.33,48,[ADDRESS_645176] showed 
increased knowledge of smoking cessation treatment following a mental health provider training 
 page 3   
program.33 A pi[INVESTIGATOR_500928] (N=304) in 6 CMHCs increased mental health providers’ use of 
the 5 As for tobacco cessation.28 This implementation strategy included didactic training (for both staff 
and psychiatrists) and access to ongoing external coaching from a physician clinic liaison.  This 
strategy was associated with a significant increase in patient receipt of 5A’s at the 6 - and 12 -month 
follow -up assessments, and increased smoking abstinence rates among patients at the 12 -month 
follow -up. Another model, the Addressing Tobacco Use Through Organ izational Change Model 
(ATTOC) has shown promise in substance use treatment facilities.  This model includes: a [ADDRESS_645177], the ATTOC model requires an 
initial 3 -day on -site consultation as well as extensive off -site traini ng for tobacco treatment specialists: 
this level of training may be difficult for resource constrained CMHCs. Second, no prior 
implementation approaches have included ongoing performance feedback on the agency’s 
implementation process. Multiple experimenta l studies have supported didactic training combined 
with ongoing performance feedback and coaching as the most effective staff training approach, 
relative to self -study or selected components (e.g., didactic training only, didactic + feedback, didactic 
+ coaching).58-[ADDRESS_645178] been tailored to specific types of 
providers such as mental health specialists or substance use treatment pro viders. A chronic care 
model requires use of a multidisciplinary team, suggesting that the implementation strategy needs to 
be flexible enough to meet the needs of a variety of stakeholders (i.e., psychiatrists, case managers, 
social workers, etc.). Fourth , because only one previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_500929], the effects of the prior implementation strategies on 
smoking cessation in psychiatric patients are not well understood.28 Finally, the focus of prior 
implementation strategies has been on early phases of the imp lementation process (i.e., preparation 
and implementation), with less of an explicit focus on strategies to promote long -term sustainment. 
Thus, implementation strategies are needed that can be adapted for low resource settings and 
multidisciplinary teams,  that consider both implementation and patient outcomes, and that include 
performance feedback and strategies to promote sustainment.  
To build upon the implementation strategies in prior studies, we have partnered with the New 
England Addiction Technology  Transfer Center (ATTC), one of 14 SAMHSA funded regional centers 
charged with training front -line behavioral health treatment providers in evidence -based practice (of 
which Co -I Becker is director). The New England ATTC developed a comprehensive, theory -driven 
implementation strategy called the Science to Service Laboratory (SSL), which consists of three key 
components based on the extensive research on staff training: 1) didactic training, 2) performance 
feedback, and 3) coaching. A robust body of experim ental literature has demonstrated that the 
combination of these three specific strategies is an effective implementation approach, and is more 
effective than any of the elements in isolation.58-[ADDRESS_645179] effective when: it is delivered 
by [CONTACT_500951], includes goals and action plans, it focuses on a problem where there is 
room for improvement, and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_500930] -physicians.[ADDRESS_645180] reported 
satisfaction with the approach.63,64  Additionally, Co -I Becker and colleagues65 found that substance 
use treatment agencies that received the SSL had 3.6 times greater odds of adopting an evidence -
based substance  use intervention (i.e., contingency management) than agencies that received 
training as usual (Preliminary study 5).  The proposed study will be the first to adapt the SSL model to 
promote the implementation of a comprehensive smoking cessation interventi on and to meet the 
unique needs of CMHCs. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_500931], the SSL has been completely untested outside 
of specialty addiction settings. The proposed study will tailor the SSL to make it maximally beneficial. 
Results can easily be fed back into A TTC with great benefit.

Outreach calls. Consistent with a chronic care approach, proactive outreach will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_500952].   Outreach will follow the 5 A’s approach. The aims of the 
outreach are  to: (1) increase motivation to stop or reduce smoki ng, (2) improve self -efficacy, (3) 
facilitate participation in evidence -based treatment.  Participants will be offered mental health tailored 
tobacco cessation counseling delivered by [CONTACT_500953]. In a ddition, the case manager will discuss tobacco cessation medication options 
and coordinate with the participants’ prescriber and case manager to facilitate receipt of medication.   
Counseling.  The counseling protocol is tailored to psychiatric patients.  Up to 7 counseling  
sessions  per round of counseling will be offered  using a motivational interviewing style to enhance 
motivation  and cognitive behavioral therapy skills . Counseling will be conducted by [CONTACT_648], secure 
video visit, or in person (participant preference).  
Provider intervention  will include every provider administering the 5A’s at every visit.  Patients who 
are interested in cessation support will be referred to the tobacco treatment case manager for 
behavioral treatment and, if the provider can  prescribe, be offered a prescription for tobacco 
cessation pharmacotherapy.

medical directors.   Directors will give the study a list of staff members  who are willing to participate . Study 
staff will call and obtain verbal informed consent.  CMHC patients.   Case managers will review a list of 
potential patient participants ( identified via  chart review ).  Case managers  will give a study flyer to participants 
who qualify and  interested patients will contact [CONTACT_1758] .  Study staff will call interested  patients to schedule an 
in person interview at the community mental health center  or a phone interview .  Prior to the interview  
interview, we will obtain written  or online , informed consent and conduct the interview.  Interviews will be 
audio  recorded.  
Studies 2&3: leaders from each community mental health center have agreed to participate.  These leaders w ill 
provide deidentified administrative data describing each organization.  Providers who are interested in 
participating in the training will be recruited during provider meetings and informal emails from medical 
directors.  Prior to the training, provide rs will receive a study fact sheet and a baseline survey. Completion of 
the survey and/or attend ing the trainings and/or coaching calls will be considered consent to participate.   
Patients will be given a flyer about the study or will receive a letter intr oducing the study  with the opportunity 
to opt out.  Patients will be contact[CONTACT_426] a study staff member  to assess interest and, if interested,  complete 
written  or electronic , informed consent and the baseline survey.  
4.1.2 Study Intervention  
Study 1: There is no intervention.  This is a qualitative study only.  
Study 2: The organization will participate in an implementation intervention, 6 months in duration, that consists 
of an in -person, hands -on training workshop, performance feedback based on anonymous patient surveys  and/or 
electronic mental record data , and coaching calls.  Organizational leaders will also participate in a series of 
planning meeting s.  Study staff will work with site leadership to develop templated language for documentation 
of the 5 A’s  in the electronic health record .  Providers will be given handouts on smoking cessation resources, 
smoking cessation medications, and a tool to help guide them through the 5 A’s.  The workshop will cover the 
importance on intervening with people with serious me ntal illness about smoking in mental health treatment 
 page [ADDRESS_645182] of providers discuss ing tobacco with patients during their visits using the 
“5 A’s” to ask the patient about their tobacco use, advise tobacco users to quit, assess readiness to quit, assist 
patient in quitting by [CONTACT_500954], medication, or a referral, and arranging  for follow -up.  In addition, 
25 patients who consented to the study will receive outreach  to discuss their tobacco use and offer to help them 
obtain smoking cessation medication through their existing providers and also to provide ongoing counseling 
(up to 7 counseling sessions by [CONTACT_648], secure video, or in person ). Outreach may also be done in person in the 
context of routine clinical care if the participant prefers it.

5.1 Screening Visit  and Baseline Assessment  
Study 1: CMHC staff  will be recruited during provider meetings, and from informationa l emails from medical 
directors.   Directors will give the study a list of providers who are interested. Study staff will call and obtain 
verbal informed consent.  We will ask the case managers to review a list of potential patient participants (based 
on chart review).  CMHC Patients.  Case managers will inform the study team whether patients would be able to 
participate in stakeholder interviews.   Case managers will give out flyers to eligible patients.  Eligible patients 
will contact [CONTACT_500958] -person interview at the community mental health center , or a phone 
interview .  Written  or online , informed consent will be obtained prior to the interview.  If the patient is unable 
to come to an in person visit, we will mail the informed consent for m to the patient with a self -addressed, 
stamped envelope  or email or text  them a link to the REDCap consent form .  When we call the patient for their 
interview, study staff will go through the consent form with the patient using a script.  The patient will  take a 
quiz on what they have read.  If the patient would like to use paper consent, we will ask the m to take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_500937].  We will then ask them 
to mail the signed c onsent form back to the research team in a self -addressed, stamped envelope provided.  If the 
patient chooses to complete consent online, they will digitally sign in REDCap.    
Study 2: Studies 2&3: leaders from each community mental health center have agree d to participate.  These 
leaders will provide deidentified administrative data describing each organization.  Providers who are interested 
in participating in the training will be recruited during provider meetings and informal emails from medical

feedback based on anonymous patient surveys given once/month  and/or aggregate electronic medical record 
data, and coaching calls.  The workshop will be video recorded and will be available to prov iders to watch 
following the training if they could not attend due to scheduling, or if they want to refer back to the workshop. 
Organizational leaders will also participate in planning meeting s (study 2 & 3) and an end of study sustainment 
meeting (study 3). Study staff will work with site leadership to develop templated language for documentation 
of the 5 A’s.  Providers will be given handouts on smoking cessation resources, smoking cessation medications, 
and a tool to help guide them through the 5 A’s.  The workshop will cover the importance on intervening with 
people with serious mental illness about smoking in mental health treatment settings, available treatments, 
documentation, and how to do the 5 As.  
 
Patient intervention:  
 
Proactive outreach .  Will consist of outreach attempts with the offer of a connection to counseling.  
Outreach calls. Consistent with a chronic care approach, proactive outreach will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_500952].  In study 2 , the case manager will make one outreach call per 
participant.  These outreach attempts may be conducted via telephone , HIPAA secure video calls , or 
at an in person visit (participant preference) . Each outreach attempt  will include five call attempts per 
available telephone number. In addition, if the participant agrees to receive texts, the participant will 
receive up to 5 outreach text messages.  If the participant is in active clinical care, the tobacco 
cessation case manager can also offer to see the participant in person followin g a regularly 
scheduled appointment to discuss their smoking.  In study 3, the case manager will make 3 outreach 
attempts , each 3 months apart.  The aims of the outreach are to: (1) increase motivation to stop or 
reduce smoking, (2) improve self -efficacy, (3) facilitate participation in evidence -based treatment.  
Participants will be offered mental health tailored tobacco cessation counseling delivered by [CONTACT_500961]. In addition, the case manager will 
discuss tobacco cessation medication options and coordinate with the participants’ prescriber and 
case manager to facilitate receipt of medication.   
Counseling.  The counseling protocol is tailored to psychiatric patients.  Participants will engage in 
up to 7 counseling sessions using a motivational interviewing style to enhance motivation  and 
cognitive behavioral therapy skills . Counseling sessions will be timed based on the participant’s 
readiness to quit, such that more  sessions  will take place surrounding quit dates.   Counseling will be 
done by [CONTACT_648], secure video visit, or in person (participant preference).  
 page 9   
Provider intervention  will include every provider administering the 5A’s at diagnostic assessment 
and treatment planning visits .  Patients who are interested in cessation support will be referred to the 
tobacco treatment case manager for behavioral treatment and, if the provider can prescribe, be 
offered a prescription for tobacco cessation pharmacotherapy.  
 
5.2.1 Study procedures  and visits study 1  
Study 1: Patients will provide written  or online , informed consent  prior to the interview  and complete the 
interview in person  or by [CONTACT_648] .  CMHC staff  will be given the option of participating by [CONTACT_500962] p rovide oral consent.    Interviews will take [ADDRESS_645191] to 
enroll in smoking cessation counseling and/or get help from the case manager to reach out to their providers to 
obtain smoking cessation medication.  
Follow -up.  Three months post -baseline, patients will complete a follow -up survey  online or by [CONTACT_648].  
Participants reporting abstinence will complete  an expi[INVESTIGATOR_500938] a portable CO 
monitor  mailed to the participant, a home visit, or an in -person clinic visit .  At the end of the study, [ADDRESS_645192] sheet and baseline survey prior t o the trainings .  Completion of the 
baseline survey or attendance at the trainings will be considered consent to participate.  Providers will complete 
a recorded,  online training  via Zoom or a n in-person training regarding providing smoking cessation 
interventions to patients.  This training will be attended by [CONTACT_500963] (Sara Becker, 
Sarah Helseth) who will  edit training videos for future site use.  An IAA will be obtained before Brown 
investigators participates in research activit ies. Providers will then have the opportunity to participate in 
coaching calls  for [ADDRESS_645193] already agreed to participate.   Leaders will participate 
in a readiness meeting  at the beginning of the study  (study 2 and 3), and a sustainment visit at the end of the 
implementation period (study 3 only).   We will work with the site to create the following implementation tools: 
handouts about community smoking cessation resources, handouts about smoking cessati on medications, 
decision aids to complete the [ADDRESS_645194] data .  In patient surveys, beginning the month prior to implementation, the community 
organization will add study surveys to their pre -existing  after-visit surveys  electronically about whether their 
provider completed each of the 5 A’s (ask, advise, assess, assist, & arrange).   At the end of the study, 5 -6 
providers will be selected to complete a qualitative interview.

Enrollment.  Patients will provide written  or electronic , informed consent.  They will then complete a baseline 
survey.  At the time of the provider training , they will complete a second baseline survey.  Following the second 
baseline survey , the smoking cessation case manager will begin an outreach attempt (phone, text, or in person) .  
During the outreach , they can elect to enroll in smoking cessation counseling and/or get help from the case 
manager to reach out to their providers to obtain smoking cessat ion medication.  Outreach attempts will be 
repeated at [ADDRESS_645195] sheet and baseline survey prior to the trainings.  Completion of the baseline 
survey or attendance at the trainings or coaching calls will be considered consent to participate.  Providers will 
complete a recorded, online training via Zoom  or an in -person training regarding providing smoking cessation 
interventions to patients.  This training will be attended by [CONTACT_500963] (Sara Becker, 
Sarah Helseth) who will edit training videos for future site use. Providers will  then have the opportunity to 
participate in coaching calls  for [ADDRESS_645196] already agreed to participate.  
Leaders  will participate in a virtual or in person site visit at the beginning of the study.   5-6 employees  will 
participate in a qualitative interview.  We will  work with the site to create the following implementation tools: 
handouts about community smoking cessation resources, handouts about smoking cessation medications,

Patient Assessments.  
Demographics   We will assess patient demographics including gender, race/ethnicity, and age.   
Tobacco use history.   We will assess tobacco use history including number of cigarettes per day, 
years of smoking, use of other nicotine/tobacco products, prior use of tobacco cessation treatments 
(counseling and medication).   
Fagerstrom test for Nicotine Dependence.  the Fager strom Test for Nicotine Dependenc e is a  6-
item measure of tobacco dependence.    
The Biener Contemplation Ladder  is a single item measure of readiness to quit smoking.   
Use of tobacco cessation treatment .  Patients will be asked if they have participated i n tobacco 
cessation counseling of any kind (in -person, telephone, or group counseling), or if they have received 
or used any of the [ADDRESS_645199] assessment, and the Biener 
contemplation ladder.

Implementation measures.  
Feasibility  will be measured by [CONTACT_500964]: attend the online and in person 
trainings, complete rol e plays, attend coaching calls, and receive performance feedback.  For 
patients, feasibility will be measured by [CONTACT_500965], the 
proportion who accept proactive outreach and the proportion who complete the follow -up.   
Acceptability.   Qualitative interviews with 5 -6 patients and 5 -6 providers will be conducted at the 3 -
month follow -up (study 2) and [ADDRESS_645200] -enrollment (study 3) .  Interviews will be conducted by a 
trained research staff member . Interviews will co ntain open ended questions about treatment (for 
patients) and implementation (for providers and leaders) acceptability, burden, and suggestions for 
improvement.  Interviews will be audio recorded.   An interview guide will be submitted to the IRB prior 
to administering the interviews.  
Effectiveness.   Implementation Effectiveness  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_500966] 5As and the proportion who report using smoking cessation counseling and medication 
measured 3 -months  (study 2) or 12 months (study 3)  after the start of the implementation period 
(assessed via patient report).   
Readiness to deliver cessation treatment.   This is a [ADDRESS_645201].  Case managers  or providers  for each patient will verify if the patient is appropriate to participate in 
research (without cognitive impairment, capable of providing informed consent, has a telephone  and an 
address ). 
 page 12   
6.2 Efficacy Evaluations  
 Feasibility  will be measured by [CONTACT_500964]: attend the online and in person 
trainings, complete role plays, attend coaching calls, and receive performance feedback.  We expect 
the majority (>75%) of providers and leaders to attend the trainings and receive performance 
feedback.  For patients, feasibility will be measured by [CONTACT_500967], the proportion who accept a proactive outreach  and the proportion who complete the follow -up.  
Previous studies (preliminary st udies 1 -3) using this recruitment strategy have yielded a 30 -44% 
response rate to the enrollment invitations, 62 -71% for the proactive call, and 66 -74% for follow -up 
assessment.19,20 Results in this range  would be considered feasible.   
Acceptability.   Patients will complete the 8 -item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) during the 
follow -up assessment .  Qualitative interviews with 5 -6 patients and 5 -6 providers will be conducted at 
the 3 -month follow -up (study 2), and 15 month follow -up (study 3) .  Interviews will be conducted by a 
trained research staff member . Interviews will contain open ended questions about treatment (for 
patients) and implementation (for providers and leaders) acceptability, burd en, and suggestions for 
improvement.   
Effectiveness.   Implementation Effectiveness  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_500966] 5As and the proportion who report using smoking cessation counseling and medication 
measured 3 -months after the start of the implementation period ( study 2) and at 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_645202] baseline 2  (study 3) assessed via patient report.  Patient Effectiveness  will be measured by 
[CONTACT_81958] (CO) -confirmed [ADDRESS_645203] -interventi on (3 months 
for study 2 and 12 months  from second baseline  for study 3).  Secondary patient outcomes will 
include: 30 -day point -prevalence abstinence, the number of self -reported ≥[ADDRESS_645204] -interviews notes will be 
written at the end of each interview and reviewed by [CONTACT_348361] -investigators. Interviews will be 
transcribed and deidentified. Transcription will be completed by [CONTACT_500968].  We 
will develop analytical codes using an iterative method in which interview notes are reviewed 
to: 1) consider whether the qualitative agenda is appropriate and complete, and 2) develop an 
initial coding structure. Deductive codes will be drawn from the inter view questions (e.g., 
treatment needs); review of the interview notes will also allow the creation of inductive codes 
which capture emergent concepts from the interviews. Investigators and trained study staff  will 
code the transcripts. Each transcript will  be independently coded by [CONTACT_492823], who will meet 
to resolve discrepancies. Final codes will be entered into NVivo qualitative data analysis 
software. We will conduct a framework matrix analysis66 to identify the most effective ways to 
organize the content and logistics of implementation strategy and pi[INVESTIGATOR_500940].66,67 
Quantitative Analysis.  As a preliminary step, CMHC, provider, and patient -level 
characteristics will be summarized at baseline. Differences between CMHC’s will be tested 
using graphical methods, non - parametric, and parametric tests as appropriate (e.g., Wilcoxin 
rank-sum test for skewed data, t -tests for normally distributed continuous data & chi -squared 
tests for categorical data). Consistent with Aim 3, feasibility and acce ptability will be assessed 
as follows : feasibility  will be measured by [CONTACT_500969], complete role plays, and receive performance feedback. Implementation will 
be considered feasible if at least 75%  of providers and leaders attend the trainings and receive 
 page 13   
performance feedback. For patients, feasibility will be measured by [CONTACT_500970], the proportion who accept a proactive outreach  and the proportion who 
complet e the follow -up. The study will be considered feasible if results are in the range of those 
found in preliminary studies: 30 -44% response rate to the enrollment invitations, 62 -71% for the 
proactive call, and 66 -74% for follow -up assessment (See Preliminar y Studies Section). 
Acceptability will be assessed based on  the 8 item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) 
during the follow -up assessment , as well as qualitative interviews at the 12 -month  follow -up. 
Interviews will contain open ended questions about treatment (for patients) and implementation 
(for providers and leaders) acceptability, burden, and suggestions for improvement. The 
treatment will be considered acceptable if ≥ 80% of participants respond that they are at least 
somewhat satisfied with thei r participation. Average acceptability scores will be reported. Initial 
effectiveness  will be evaluated with respect to both implementation and patient outcomes. First, 
we will summarize CMHC -level implementation  data with respect to treatment delivery and  
utilization (e.g., proportion of patients receiving each of the 5A’s, using smoking cessation 
counseling and medication) and compare across centers. Next, baseline, 3 -, 6-, and 12 -month 
patient  cessation outcomes (7 -day PPA and number of quit attempts), w ill be summarized 
among the aggregate sample and by [CONTACT_500971]. We will explore the adjusted effects using a series 
of generalized linear mixed effects models adjusted for potential confounders, baseline values 
and clustering.68 Models allow for flexible distribution of the outcome (binary, count) and adjust 
standard errors for the clustered nature of the data (clustered by [CONTACT_500972]). Models 
will include a random effect for CMHC and will further adjust for potential confounders (including 
variables that might differ between CMHC’s). Similar models can be used to test the effects on 
secondary outcomes (e.g., cigarettes per day) during the post -implementation period (3 -, 6- and 
12-months) adjusting for baseline, and to explore the effect of implementation at the patient 
level (use of counseling and medication) and at the provider level (SSL dose) as a predictor of 
primary and secondary cessation outcomes.

 Patient intervention:  
 
 page [ADDRESS_645208] of outreach attempts with the offer of a connection to counseling.  
Outreach. Consistent with a chronic care approach, proactive outreach will be conducted by [CONTACT_500973].  In study 2, the case manager will make one outreach attempt  per 
participant.  Each outreach will include five call attempts per available telephone number  plus 5 text 
messages , participants can also be approached in person as part of routine care if the participant 
prefers . In study 3, the case manager will make 3 outreach attempts , each 3 months apart.  The aims 
of the  outreach  are to: (1) increase motivation to stop or reduce smoking, (2) improve self -efficacy, (3) 
facilitate participation in evidence -based treatment.  Participants will be offered mental health tailored 
tobacco cessation counseling delivered by [CONTACT_500974]. In addition, the case manager will discuss tobacco cessation medication options 
and coordinate with the participants’ prescriber and case manager to facilitate receipt of medication.   
Counseling.  The couns eling protocol is tailored to psychiatric patients.  Participants my participant 
in up to [ADDRESS_645209] by [CONTACT_370976], by [CONTACT_500975], or in person (participant preference).  
Provider intervention  will include every provider administering the 5A’s at diagnostic assessment 
and treatment planning visits .  Patients who are interested in cessation support will be ref erred to the 
tobacco treatment case manager for behavioral treatment and, if the provider can prescribe, be 
offered a prescription for tobacco cessation pharmacotherapy.  
 
8  SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
8.1  Clinical Adverse Events  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  
8.2  Adverse Event Reporting  
Unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others that occur during the course 
of this study and SAEs will be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB Attachment  EEE: Prompt Reporting 
Guidelines . AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized 
and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  
8.[ADDRESS_645210] a causal relationship with the treatment.  An adverse event  can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintende d sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of the test article , whether or not related to the product.  
All AEs (including SAEs) will be noted in the study records and on the case report form wi th a full description 
including the nature, date and time of onset, determination of non -serious versus serious, intensity (mild, 
moderate, severe), duration, causality, and outcome of the event.  
8.4  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence  that:  
• results in death,  
• is life-threatening,  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• results in a  persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
 page 15   
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.   
8.4.1  Relationship of SAE to study drug or other intervention  
The relationship of each SAE to the study intervention will be characterized usin g one of the following terms : 
certain, probable/likely, possible, unlikely/ unrelated, or unasses sable.  
8.5  IRB/IEC Notification of SAEs  and Other Unanticipated Problems  
The Investigator will promptly notify the IRB of all internal (occurring in subjects enrolled at this site)  
unanticipated  problems involving risks to subjects o r others , and S erious Adverse Events that are related to the 
research activity.  Reports will be submitted to the IRB in accordance with the timeline below. Externa l (at other 
sites) SAEs that are both unexpected and related to the study intervention will be reported promptly .  
Category of Prompt Report  Initial Notification  
 
Internal (occurring in subjects enrolled at this 
site), related (or more likely related than 
unrelated)  SAE   5 days  
Internal , unrelated SAE  30 days  
External  SAE and AEs need not be reported 
unless it represents an unanticipated problem  A brief summary of important AEs may be 
reported at time of continuing review  
Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risks to 
Subjects or Others  5 days  
8.5.1  Follow -up report  
If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that changes the 
investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant new or reassessed information 
(e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) will be submitted to the IRB. The investigator is will ensure  that 
all SAE are followed until either resolved or stable.  
8.[ADDRESS_645211] these providers in case of symptom exacerbation.  If a 
 page 16   
participant reports active suicidality as part of counseling sessions , the tobacco treatment case 
manager (who will be a mental health professional who is on staff at the CMHC) will conduct a suicide 
risk assessment as would be done during routine care a nd take appropriate action.  
If a participant reports any acute risk issues during follow -up contacts, the research assistant will 
be trained to conduct a risk assessment using a scripted assessment tool.  If the participant is in 
imminent danger, the RA wi ll immediately call [ADDRESS_645212]. Japuntich (or covering provider).  
In all other cases, following the RA risk assessment, [CONTACT_500983] (or covering provider) will then 
conduct her own risk assessment.  If the participant expresses suicidal thought s, but no plan or intent, 
[CONTACT_500983] will express empathy, urge the participant to talk to their mental health providers about 
their symptoms, give the participant appropriate emergency numbers and tell the patient that he or 
she should present to the E R if they are feeling unsafe.  If the participant expresses active suicidal 
intentions or plans (i.e., any recent suicidal attempts, suicidal gestures, or self -injurious behavior; any 
current plan or intent to engage in suicidal or self -injurious behavior)  to any study staff at any time 
point, [CONTACT_500983] (or covering provider) will express concern for their safety, ask the participant to 
present to the nearest ER, and, if needed, 911 will be called.  Any time the suicidality protocol is 
triggered, the pa rticipant’s mental health care team will be informed, regardless of the level of 
suicidality.  For all participants who express suicidality, [CONTACT_500983] (or covering provider) will call 
them to follow -up by [CONTACT_367810] -up as often as is needed, until  we have received confirmation 
from their care team that the team is aware of the risk and that the participant is under their care.

institution will be informed in cases when any significant action is taken as a result of an adverse event or by 
[CONTACT_500976]. Any serious adverse event (SAE), whether or not related to study intervention, will be 
reported to both the IRB and the funding institution. A summary of the SAEs that occurred during the pr evious 
year will be included in the annual progress reports to both the IRB and the funding institution.  
Data safety monitoring board (DSMB).   Because the study involves multiple clinical recruitment sites and 
the recruitment of participants with SMI, a DS MB is required. We will convene a DSMB who will consist of 4 
clinician investigators with expertise in serious mental illness and/or tobacco dependence.  At least one member 
of the DSMB will be from outside the PI’s home department.  
The purpose of the DSM B will be to ensure the safety of the participants and to make recommendations 
about whether to continue, amend, or terminate the study based on the safety data.  Due to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_228364], the DSMB will not have a large focus on efficacy.   
The DSMB will meet quarterly via teleconference throughout the study.  The board will also be convened at 
any point if unexpected safety concerns arise. The study statistician will be a non -voting member of the DSMB.  
Prior to trial launch, the DSMB will revi ew the study protocol, characteristics of the study data collection sites, 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, definition of participants (e.g., screened, enrolled, treated, drop out, lost to follow -
up), the intervention manual, rules for discontinuation of part icipation, outcome measures, and sample size.  
During enrollment, the DSMB will review reports of study admission data (number approached, enrolled, 
reasons for ineligibility, demographic characteristics, and retention data), protocol compliance (expected vs. 
actual recruitment rate, study drop -outs and reason, data quality assurance report, case report forms, protocol 
deviations/violations, missing data, subject refusal to provide data), and safety data (adverse events, serious 
adverse events).  At the end  of each meeting, the DSMB will submit a report documenting a review of study 
data and make recommendations with respect to study progress and need for modification.  This report will be 
transmitted to the IRB and to NIDA.   
 
Data.  
All data and records wil l be safeguarded according to the policies of the IRB. As reviewed above, all 
participant records and assessment data from this study will be treated as confidential, including participant 
names and the fact they are participating in the study. All electro nic data will be stored on secure, password 
protected servers. A file will be maintained that associates the subject’s name [CONTACT_398668]'s study

Potential Risks.  
Nicotine withdrawal symptoms after quitting:  There is a strong likelihood that 
most study participants who quit smoking will experience some nicotine withdrawal 
symptoms, in cluding anxiety, restlessness, anger, irritability, sadness, problems 
concentrating, appetite change and weight gain, insomnia, and decreased heart 
rate. Generally, these reactions are temporary and pose no serious health risks.  
Worsening of psychiatric s ymptoms and emergent suicidality.  Available evidence 
suggests that quitting smoking has not been associated with increases in 
psychiatric symptoms among those with mental illness and may even result in 
improvement in psychiatric symptoms.44,[ADDRESS_645220] potentially sensitive information 
about participants; if released inappropriately, participants may experience 
embarrassment or distress. The seriousness of the consequences would depend  on 
the nature of the information revealed and to whom the information was revealed. 
Given the numerous steps we take to protect participant confidentiality, we think the 
risk of a breach of confidentiality is low.  
Discomfort or distress when completing a ssessment and treatment procedures.  
Some participants may feel uncomfortable or distressed answering personal or 
private questions during assessment or treatment. In our previous studies, when 
individuals do report discomfort in these situations, it is mil d. Participants will be 
informed at the beginning of each assessment that their participation is voluntary 
and they may refuse to answer any questions that make them uncomfortable or 
withdraw from the study at any time.  
 
ADEQUACY OF PROTECTION AGAINST RISK  
 
Recruitment and Informed Consent  
Prior to proactive recruitment of participants, we will obtain approval from their 
treatment team to ensure that they are appropriate for the study and capable of 
consent. Written  or online  informed consent (including  a description of the nature, 
purpose, risks, and benefits of the study) will be obtained from participants before 
initiating study procedures. The voluntary nature of the study and the participant’s 
right to withdraw at any time will be stressed in the co nsent materials. Patients will 
be encouraged to call the study staff with any questions about the study prior to 
signing the consent form.  
 
Protections Against Risk  
 
Minimization of nicotine withdrawal symptoms after quitting:  Participants that 
decide to u se cessation medication will be told that it will reduce but not entirely 
eliminate withdrawal symptoms. Participants will be instructed to call their outpatient 
physician or psychiatrist in the case of severe withdrawal reactions. Withdrawal 
   Page 20 
symptoms typi [INVESTIGATOR_500944] 1 to 2 weeks of quitting and are not medically 
dangerous.  
Minimization of loss of confidentiality/privacy: All data and records will be 
safeguarded according to the strict privacy/confidentiality policies of The Hennepin 
Healthcare Institutional Review Board (IRB). Confidentiality will be maintained by 
[CONTACT_46766], disguising identifying information, and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_500945]. All electronic data will be 
numerically code d and stored on a limited access server in a secure research 
space. All paper forms will be stored in locked file cabinets in a locked room. Names 
of participants will be stored separately. Participant information will be accessible 
only to research staff,  who are pledged to confidentiality and complete training in 
the ethical conduct of research (i.e., both HIPAA and CITI trainings). [CONTACT_500983] 
will also personally train staff on maintenance of participant confidentiality. 
Identifying information will n ot be reported in any publication.  
Minimization of discomfort or distress when completing assessment and 
treatment procedures: We will take two specific steps to reduce the possibility of 
discomfort or distress:  
Study will be clearly explained.  A detailed explanation of the study, including 
what study participation would involve, the nature of the questions participants will 
be asked to answer, the nature of measurements, the nature of the intervention 
being tested, and the right to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty, 
will be provided to the participants, in writing (through the informed consent form). 
Participants will be encouraged to ask questions about the study. Individuals who 
are uncomfortable answering these types of questions, asses sments, or 
interventions likely will not choose to participate. Those who choose to participate 
but are very uncomfortable with the questions, assessments or interventions will be 
told that they can refuse these assessments or choose to withdraw from the s tudy.  
Staff Training.  All staff interacting with participants will be trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Japuntich to ask questions and complete assessments in a sensitive manner and 
be supportive to any participant experiencing discomfort or distress.  
Minimization of risk fr om worsening of depression and emergent suicidality . 
There is no evidence indicating that participation in this trial will worsen depression 
or cause suicidality. In fact, other studies have found that quitting smoking is 
associated with improvements in ps ychiatric symptoms.44,[ADDRESS_645221] these providers in case of symptom 
exacerbati on.  If a participant reports active suicidality as part of counseling calls, 
the tobacco treatment case manager (who will be a licensed mental health 
   Page 21 
professional who is on staff at the CMHC) will conduct a suicide risk assessment as 
would be done during routine care and take appropriate action.  
If a participant reports any acute risk issues during follow -up contacts, the 
research assistant will be trained to conduct a risk assessment using a scripted 
assessment tool.  If the participant is in imminent dan ger, the RA will immediately 
call [ADDRESS_645222]. Japuntich (or covering provider).  In all other cases, 
following the RA risk assessment, [CONTACT_500983] (or covering provider) will then 
conduct her own risk assessment.  If the participant expresses su icidal thoughts, 
but no plan or intent, [CONTACT_500983] will express empathy, urge the participant to talk 
to their mental health providers about their symptoms, give the participant 
appropriate emergency numbers and tell the patient that he or she should pr esent 
to the ER if they are feeling unsafe.  If the participant expresses active suicidal 
intentions or plans (i.e., any recent suicidal attempts, suicidal gestures, or self -
injurious behavior; any current plan or intent to engage in suicidal or self -injurious 
behavior) to any study staff at any time point, [CONTACT_500983] (or covering provider) 
will express concern for their safety, ask the participant to present to the nearest 
ER, and, if needed, 911 will be called.  Any time the suicidality protocol is tri ggered, 
the participant’s mental health care team will be informed, regardless of the level of 
suicidality.  For all participants who express suicidality, [CONTACT_500983] (or covering 
provider) will call them to follow -up by [CONTACT_367810] -up as often as is  needed, 
until we have received confirmation from their care team that the team is aware of 
the risk and that the participant is under their care.  
 
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_645223] an implementation strategy. The costs of participating 
in the research will be minimized through our extensive efforts to maintain 
confid entiality, reduce discomfort or distress, and minimize medical complications.  
 
9.4.4  Risk -Benefit Assessment  
Overall, it is expected that the potential benefits to participants in the proposed 
study will outweigh potential risks.  
9.5  Recruitment Strategy  
Study 1: Providers will be recruited during provider meetings, and from informational 
emails from medical directors.  Directors will give the study a list of providers who are 
interested. Study staff will call and obtain verbal informed consent.  We will ask the case 
managers to review a list of potential patient participants (based on chart review).  Case 
managers will give out flyers to eligible patients.  Eligible patients will contact [CONTACT_500977] [ADDRESS_645224] the 
interview.  
Studies 2&3: leaders from each community mental health center have agreed to participate.  
Providers who are inter ested in participating in the training will be recruited during provider 
meetings and informal emails from medical directors.  They will receive a study fact sheet 
prior to trainings. Completion of the baseline survey or attendance at the trainings or 
coaching calls will indicate consent to participate.  Patients will be given  or mailed  a flyer 
about the study  and information about how to opt out  and patients who do not opt out  will be 
contact[CONTACT_500978] e written  or 
electronic , informed consent and the baseline survey.  
9.6  Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization  
9.6.[ADDRESS_645225] the rights and 
welfare of the subjects.  
For study 2 and 3, we will ask patients to complete anonymous surveys about whether their 
provider completed the 5 A’s.  Participant s will be given a fact sheet.  Completion of the 
survey will serve as consent.   
9.6.2  Waiver of Assent  
N/A 
9.6.[ADDRESS_645226] chart 
reviews to identify p otentially eligible participants (English -speaking tobacco users).  The 
study will not obtain this list, but rather these participants will be approached by [CONTACT_500979] a flyer or mailed a letter about the study.  
9.[ADDRESS_645227] for time, effort , and inconvenience  (i.e. compensation)  
In study 1, participants will be paid $[ADDRESS_645228].  
In study 2, patient participants will be paid $20 per assessment.  There are two assessments , 
so participants will be paid a total of $40.  Participants who report abstinence at the 3 -month 
   Page 23 
assessment will  be paid an additional $[ADDRESS_645229].  In addition, 5 -6 
patients and 5 -6 providers will complete qualitative interviews, for which they will be paid 
$20.   
In study 3, patient participants will complete 5 assessments, and will be pai d $20 per 
assessment. Participants who report abstinence at the final assessment will be paid an 
additional $[ADDRESS_645230].   In addition, 5 -6 patient participants and 5 -
6 staff will complete interviews and will be paid $20.

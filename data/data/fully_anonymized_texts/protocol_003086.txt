[ADDRESS_781269] ( UTAP) blocks  
(regional anesthetic blocks)  are being employed for the care of urological surgery 
patients. Local and regional anesthesia is commonly used throughout surgical fields. 
However, ultrasound -guidance can be challenging, particularly in larger, obese pa tients. 
It is unknown how such techniques compare to laparoscopic -guided blockade, with 
respect to time to perform, learning curve, and postoperative analgesia. The transversus 
abdominis plane lies deep within the abdominal wall, potentially allowing for g reater 
ease of access from a laparoscopic approach from within than the ultrasound guided 
percutaneous approach .  
 Prior randomized studies have been completed  comparing UTAP and Placebo. In 
2012 Hosgood et al. compared UTAP and placebo (UTAP w/ saline) in  46 live -donor 
laparoscopic nephrectomy patients (24 UTAP  vs. 22 placebo ).  Pain control (measured 
using the 0 -10 VAS scale) was greater on post -operative day (POD) 1 in patients 
receiving UTAP than in controls , 19 (15) vs . 37 (20) (presented as mean ( SD)), 
respectively .1  A similar randomized study in 2014 compared UTAP and placebo (UTAP 
w/saline) in 21 hand assiste d laparoscopic nephrectomy patients  (10 UTAP  vs. 11 
placebo ). The study was initially powered for [ADDRESS_781270] of absence during the study period. Pain scores 
were recorded using the 0-10 VAS score.  Postoperatively at 24 hours ( median  (IQR)) 
UTAP patients demonstrated decreased postoperative pain than placebo patients (1 (0-2) 
vs. 4  (2-6)) on the VAS score , respectively .2  
 A larger study, done in 2016 , with 80 randomized patients undergoing 
retroperitoneal laparoscopic urologic surgery compared UTAP (40) and saline UTAP 
(40). Pain scores were assessed using the 0 -100 VAS score  scale . On POD1, UTAP  
group had lower pain scores (mean  (SD)) of 8.4  (5.9) vs. placebo 28.3 (12.2).[ADDRESS_781271] recent study, done in 2018, examined 100 randomized patients 
undergoing robotic -assisted laparoscopi c prostatectomies.  Fifty patients were given 
UTAP blocks while  the others received no block.  A Numerical Rating Scale ( assumed to 
range from 0 -10 as not otherwise specified ) was used to assess pain.  Patients receiving 
the block at 24 hours had better pa in control (mean  (SD)) (1.8 (0.82) vs . 3.57 (0.64)).4 
 While all of these studies point to potential efficacy of UTAP, no data has been 
published to date comparing laparoscopic administration of the TAP block (LTAP) to 
ultrasound guided administration. While these regional anesthetic blocks carry a 
theoretical risk of hematoma or damage to surrounding structures, none of the above 
studies report any complications with the injections.

5 1.4 Rationale  
We aim to prospectively compare Placebo  (local administration ), UTAP , and LTAP 
blocks in patients und ergoing surgery of the prostate and  kidney.  We expect to be able to 
equally efficiently administer the blocks using dire ct visualization and ultrasound 
guidance. We expect that a negative result would obviate the need for longer operative 
time by [CONTACT_592270] a positive 
result would demonstrate the increased utility of preoperative ultrasound blocks in 
managing postoperative pain.

[ADDRESS_781277]  
6.1 Pain Scale  
6.1.1  Definition  
 
Patient solicited pain scores will be assessed using the Visual Analogue Pain 
Scale (VAS -Pain). VAS is a pain rating scale where scores are based on self -
reported measures of symptoms that are recorded with a single handwritten mark 
placed at one point alo ng the length of a 10 -cm line that represents a continuum 
between the two ends of the scale —“no pain” on the left end (0 cm) of the scale 
and the “worst pain” on the right end of the scale (10 cm). Measurements from the 
starting point (left end) of the sca le to the patients' marks are recorded in 
centimeters and are interpreted as their pain  intensity . This will be administered 
by [CONTACT_592273] a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that 
represents the pain intensity.  This pain sca le is commonly used throughout the 
pain literature and takes <1 minute to complete.

IF2449510  
________________________________________________________________________  
11 All patients experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study 
drug, will be monitored until:  
 the adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the 
adverse event return to baseline;  
 any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline;  
 there is a satisfactory explanation other than the study drug for the changes 
observed; or  death.  
6.3.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient 
receiving study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of an experimental 
intervention, whether or not related to the intervention.  
6.3.2 Definition of Severity of Adverse Events  
 
All non -hematologic adverse events will be graded according to the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. 
The CTCAE v4 is available at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html  
 
If no CTCAE grading is available, the severity of an AE is graded as 
follows:  
Mild (grade 1):  the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal 
daily activities.  
Moderate (grade 2):  the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily 
activities.  
Severe (grade 3):  the event makes the patient unable to perform normal 
daily activities or significantly affects his/her clinical status.  
Life-threatening (grade 4):  the patient was at risk of death at the time of 
the event.  
Fatal (grade 5):  the event cau sed death.  
6.3.3 Serious Adverse Events  
A “serious” adverse event is defined in regulatory terminology as any 
untoward medical occurrence that:  
[IP_ADDRESS] Results in death.  
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease  
should be reported as event (SAE) itself.  
IF2449510  
________________________________________________________________________  
12 [IP_ADDRESS] Is life -threatening.  
(The patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does 
not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Requires in -patie nt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_75095] ≥ 24 hours . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
[IP_ADDRESS] Is an important medical event  
Any event that does not  meet the above criteria, but that in the judgment 
of the investigator jeopardizes the patient, may be considered for reporting 
as a serious adverse event . The event may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of 
“Serious Adverse Event“.  
For example: allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home; convulsions that may not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; development of drug abuse or drug dependency.  
6.3.4 Steps to Deter mine If an Adverse Event Requires Expedited Reporting  
Step 1 : Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4) .  
 
Step 2 : Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v4.  
 
Step 3 : Determine whether t he adverse event is related to the protocol therapy  
Attribution categories are as follows:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.  
Note : This includes all events that occur within [ADDRESS_781280] dose of 
treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must 
also be reported accordingly.  
 
Step 4 :  Determine the prior experience of the adverse event .  
Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent . An adverse event is considered unexpected, for 
expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of 
the event is not listed in:  
 the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section 
of this protocol;  
IF2449510  
________________________________________________________________________  
13  the drug package insert;  
 the current Investigator’s Brochure  
6.3.5 Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Expedited Reporting  
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9960] [ADDRESS_781281] administration 
of the study drug .  
 
 The IRB/PPHS  must be notified within 5 business days of “any 
unanticipated problems involving ri sk to subjects or others” 
(UPR /UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]) . 
The following events meet the definition of UPR  
a. Any new information that indicates a new or increased risk, 
or safety issue (e.g., interim analysis, safety monitoring 
report, publication, updated sponsor safety report), that 
indicates an unexpect ed change to the risk/benefit ratio for 
the research.  
b. An investigator brochure, package insert, or device labeling 
is revised to indicate an increase or magnitude of a 
previously known risk, or describes a new risk.  
c. Withdrawal, restriction, or modificatio n of a marketed 
approval of a drug, device, or biologic used in research 
protocol  
d. Protocol deviation or violation that harmed subjects or 
others or that indicated subjects or others might be at 
increased risk of harm.  
e. Complaint of subject that indicates subjects or others might 
be at increased risk of harm or at risk of a new harm  
f. Any breach in confidentiality that may involve risk to the 
subject or others.  
g. Any harm experienced by a subject or other individual that 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_592261].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Routine Reporting  
All other adverse events - such as those that are expected, or are 
unlikely or definitely not related to the study participation - are to be 
reported annually as p art of regular data submission.

[ADDRESS_781282] removal from the trial.  
6.5 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]  
7.0 As none of the prior trials report any complications with TAP proce dures, an acceptable 
AE rate would need to be very low i.e. <5% and include theoretical complications such as 
bleeding, or injection of anesthetic intravascularly. Most recent randomized trials3,4 do 
not report any complications with these injections. This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_592274] a biannual basis and if a TAP procedure related  serious complication occurs

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
This is a single -center, single -blinded, (stratified) randomized placebo -controlled 
three -arm non -inferiority trial with 2:2:1 allocation  ratio.  
 
Randomization:  
People who meet eligibility requirements and provide informed consent will be 
randomly allocat ed to 3 groups to receive either UTAP, LTAP or Placebo with a 
2:2:1 allocation ratio. The allocation sequence will be stratified by [CONTACT_422351] 
(prostatectomy or partial nephrectomy) using  stratified block randomization with 
randomly varying bl ock sizes. Random permuted blocks sizes within stratification 
groups will be used to minimize the chance of selection bias. Investigators will be 
blinded to the size of each block with only the study statistician responsible for 
generating the randomizatio n list knowing this information. A randomization 
service called Sealedenvelope.com available at 
https://www.sealedenvelope.com/simple -randomiser/v1/ will be used for 
allocation concealment to ensure that retrieval of the treatment group assignment 
is only revealed to appropriate team members on a real time basis after each new 
patient has been screened and consented. This service allows for allocation 
concealment that would not be possible if the entire randomization list was made 
available to team members at the beginning of the study. The security and 
integrity of the codes used by [CONTACT_592275].com follows the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) standards for electronic records and follows the 
International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practi ce (ICH GCP) 
guidelines.  
 
The following is an overview of the randomization generation and management 
process. The trial coordinator will create an administrator account with 
sealedenvelope.com. Only the email address given when setting up the trial will 
be registered as the administrator email address  and it can be used to change the 
password, delete the trial, or receive a list of all randomizations performed at any 
time. The study statistician will generate the randomization list in 
Sealedenvelope.com. Once the account for the trial has been opened and the 
randomization list generated; any designated user (designated by [CONTACT_592276]) with the single password for the trial can carry out new 
randomizations. Online randomization is achieved by [CONTACT_592277] a form 
with the trial ID and password after providing a patient ID as well as surgical type 
for stratification purposes. An email notification is then generated displaying the 
next sequential treatment group assignment from the randomiz ation list and sent 
to the email address given by [CONTACT_592278] . Data 
and randomizations held by [CONTACT_592279]2449510

16 changed or edited by [CONTACT_8333]. Sealed Envelope will not edit or delete any data he ld 
by [CONTACT_1190].  
Participants will be blinded from the type of block given. Investigators cannot be 
blinded due to the nature of the intervention ; however allocation concealment will 
be implemented by [CONTACT_592280] . 
 
Blinding:  
Participants will be blinded to group allocation throughout the study. Due to the 
nature of the intervention, it is not possible to blind the investigator to group 
allocation.  
 
 
10.[ADDRESS_781284] been debated for years, and the 
statistical methodology has been challenged. Three -arm trials including the 
experimental t reatment, an active reference treatment and a placebo are 
recommended in the guidelines of the ICH5 and EMEA/CPMP6 as a useful 
approach to the assessment of  assay sensitivity providing the trial with internal 
validation. The placebo group affords an opportunity to test for non -inferiority 
directly without use of a fixed pre -specified non -inferiority margin thereby 
[CONTACT_592281].  
 
The objectives of this trial are two -fold: 1. to v erify assay sensitivity by 
[CONTACT_592269] (the active reference) is superior to placebo at 
controlling 24 hour postoperative pain and 2. to demonstrate non -inferiority of 
LTAP (the experimental approach) to UTAP (the active reference) with respect to 
[ADDRESS_781285] the two 
hypotheses (co -primary endpoints). In the first step, to establish assay sensitivity, 
the alternative hypothesis that UTAP is superior to placebo will be tested:  
 
 H01: µUTAP ≥ µ Placebo  
 
 HA1: µUTAP < µ Placebo   
  
If and only if we reject the null hypothesis, H 01, thereby [CONTACT_592282], to demonstrate non -inferiority of 
LTAP to UTAP.  
 
In the second step, to establish non -inferiority, the alternative hypothesis that  
LTAP is non -inferior to UTAP will be tested using the ‘fractional approach’ 
IF2449510  
________________________________________________________________________  
17 introduced by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_592262] I et al (2003) where the effect estimate is based on the ratio 
of the differences in means between LTAP and placebo and UTAP and placebo7 : 
 
   H02: µLTAP−µPlacebo
µUTAP−µPlacebo≤𝜃 
 
 HA2: µLTAP−µPlacebo
µUTAP−µPlacebo>𝜃 
 
θ is a pre -specified fixed fraction of active reference effect (retention of effect). 
Koch and Tangen8 provide reasonable regions of θ for non -inferiority testing 
between 0.5 and 0.99.  
 
If the null hypothesis, H 02 is rejected for a given θ, we will claim that LTAP (the 
experimental approach) retains more than θx100% efficacy of UTAP (the active 
reference) compared with the placebo, and non -inferior ity of LTAP to UTAP will 
be declared.  
 
With a hierarchical step down closed testing procedure  (which can occur when 
one has two or more endpoints for which demonstration of an effect on each is 
needed to support regulatory approval ), the familywise type I error rate is 
controlled at the level α as there is only one way to succeed, however, the t ype II 
error rate is inflated thereby [CONTACT_592283]. To account for inflation of the type II error rate, the sample size will be 
calculated to provide an overall power (to detect both endpoints) of 80% by 
[CONTACT_592284] 90% (90%x90%=80%)9 
corresponding to β=0.[ADDRESS_781286] problem based on the ratio of (differenc es 
in) population means was published by [CONTACT_592285]. (1998).10 The null hypothesis 
H02, referred to above as our second hypothesis, can be rejected, if the  lower limit 
of Fieller’s one -sided 100 (1 -α)% confidence interval for the ratio of differences 
in means is greater than θ. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_592263]. (2003) investig ated Fieller’s confidence 
interval and derived formulas for power and hence sample size calculation. The R 
package ‘ThreeArmedTrials ’ developed by [CONTACT_592286] (2016)11 provides a 
collection of functions for  statistical inference in three -arm trials using the 
formulas derived by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_592263]. for a normally distributed outcome. For a study 
assessing non -inferiority of an experimental approach compared to an active 
reference, tools to: determine optimal sample size allocation among groups  
(UTAP, LTAP, Placebo) , compute total (and group) sample size required to detect 
a particular non-inferiority fraction θ at a particular power and alpha level, as well 
as analyze the final data set are provided. For a normally distributed endpoint the 
group mean s, varianc es as well as power, alpha, group allocation ratios and non -
inferiority fracti on θ need to be specified for computation of sample size. It is 
recommended by [CONTACT_592287] s and variance s from a random 
effects meta -analysis of the historical placebo -controlled trials comparing UTAP 
to placebo ( presented in Section 1. 1). Based on meta -analysis of the four

18 historical placebo -controlled trials with parameters listed in the table below  and 
discussed in the introduction , the estimated pooled  mean pain score s and ( total 
variance) was 3.4 (1.50) in the placebo and 1.49 (1. 77) in the UTAP groups . The 
random effects  meta -analysis was conducted with the Comprehensive Meta -
Analysis Software Version 3.3.070 (2013).12

In accordance with ICH guidelines on statistical principles for clinical trials a type 
I                 error rate of 0.025  was used for this sample size calculation.  Optimal 
sample size allocation was determined to follow a 2:2:1 ratio of 
LTAP:UTAP:Placebo. A total sample size of 235 is required with a 2:2:1 
allocation ratio (94 LTAP, 94 UTAP and 47 Placebo) to achieve 90% power to 
establish non -inferiority of LTAP to UTAP with a fixed fraction of 0.50 (LTAP 
has to achieve more than 50%  of the effect of UTAP compared to placebo  to 
claim as non -inferior) assuming means and vari ances of 1.49 (1. 77), 1.49 (1.77) 
and 3.40 (1.50) in the LTAP, UTAP and Placebo groups, respectively.  This 
sample size calculation was performed using the PowerRet function of the 
‘ThreeArmedTrials’ package with the following parameters : 
power_RET(experime nt = c(1.49,1.77), reference = c(1.49,1.77), placebo =c( 
3.4,1.5),Delta = 0.7, sig_level = 0.025, power= 0.9,allocation = c(2,2,1) 
/5,distribution = "normal")  
 
The statistical evaluation will be performed in the first st ep by a two sample t -test 
for demons trating superiority of UTAP over placebo. Group sample sizes of 94 
and 47 for UTAP and placebo groups achieve over 99% power to reject the null 
hypothesis of equal or worse means when the population VAS pain score means 
(SDs) in the UTAP and Placebo groups  are 1.50 (1.33) and 3.4 (1.22), 
respectively, with a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_781287]. The calculation was performed with PASS Version  15.   
 
10.3 Data Analyses Plans  
Analysis of Co -Primary Endpoints : 
IF2449510  
________________________________________________________________________  
19  
The distribution of VAS pain scores in each group will be examined and assessed 
for normality and homoscedasticity , visually , by [CONTACT_592288] -
probability (P -P) plots, boxplots, stem -and-leaf plots and quantile -quantile (Q -Q) 
plots, and with the Shapi [INVESTIGATOR_2152]-Wilk normality test . If necessary, a transformation of 
the data will be made to render appropriate for parametric testing. All analyses 
will be performed on patients who undergo surgery and have a 24 hour VAS pain 
score assessment.  Balance on baseline c haracteristics  (including gender, age  at 
surgery , height, weight, BMI, and operative time) among the randomized groups 
will be assessed separately  for each intervention, using the standardized 
difference. Any variable with an absolute standardized differen ce >0.52 (i.e., 1.96 
× 1/n1 + 1/n2) for either intervention will be  adjusted for in secondary 
analyses.13,[ADDRESS_781288] the two 
hypotheses (co -primary endpoints). In the first step , to establish assay sensitivity, 
the alternative hypothesis that the [ADDRESS_781289] at the 0.025 level of significance (H 01: µUTAP ≥ µ Placebo vs. 
HA1: µUTAP < µ Placebo) .  
 
If assay sensitivity is demonstrated in the first step by [CONTACT_592289], H 01, we will proceed to the second step  of testing for  non-inferiority 
of LTAP  to UTAP. To establish non -inferiority, the alternative hypothesis that 
LTAP is non -inferior to UTAP will be tested using the ‘fractional approach’ 
introduced by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_592263] (2003) where the effect estimate is based on the ratio of 
the differences in mean s between LTAP and placebo and UTAP and placebo (H02: 
µLTAP−µPlacebo
µUTAP−µPlacebo≤𝜃: vs. H A2: µLTAP−µPlacebo
µUTAP−µPlacebo>𝜃). 
θ is pre -specified as the fixed fraction of active reference effect (retention of 
effect)  of 0.50 (LTAP has to achieve more than 50% of the effect of UTAP 
compared to placebo to claim as non -inferior). The second step will be carried out 
based on  the Fieller’s one-sided 97.5% lower confidence bound for the ratio of 
µLTAP−µPlacebo  and   µUTAP−µPlacebo . If the lower bound of the 
confidence interval is greater than 50% then the null hypothesis, H 02 is rejected  
(LTAP (the experimental approach) retains more than 50% efficacy of UTAP (the 
active reference)  then non -inferiority of LTAP to UTAP will b e declared.  The 
formula for calculating  Fieller’s confidence bound is presented in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_592263] 
(2003) and will be implemented using The R package ‘ThreeArmedTrials’ 
developed by [CONTACT_592286] (2016).  
 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints : 
 
The secondary endpoint s of 24-hour cumulative post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_592264] (MED) , intraoperative time 
taken to complete the surgical block , total operating room time and surgical time  
will be summarized using median, 1st and 3rd quartiles  and minimum and 
IF2449510  
________________________________________________________________________  
20 maximum values . A Kruskal -Wallis analysis of variance wi ll be used to compare 
the cumulative MED requirement (time to complete the surgical block , total 
operating room time and surgical time ) among the three interventi on groups  with 
all pairwise comparisons made between groups using the Dwass -Steel -Critchlow -
Fligner procedure  (Dwass 1960; Steel 1960; Critchlow and Fligner 1991) .15–17 
 
The secondary endpoint of antiemetic medication use will be reported as the 
number and percentage of patients that require  antiemetic medication during their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_592265]. A Chi-Square will be used to 
compare percentages acr oss groups. A log-binomial regression model will be used 
to estimate and compare the prevalence ratios (PR) and corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) for antiemetic medication use among patients in the 
three intervention groups.   
 
The secondary endpo ints, including length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_592266]/or 
occurrence of competing events at the time of analysis. Length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_592267]. Days to return of bowel function  will be calculated 
as the number of days between the date of surgery and the date of first bowel 
movement . If the  event  is observed in all pat ients and there is no censoring at the 
time of analysis, the mean and standard deviation (if normally distributed) or 
median and IQR (if skewed) will be presented  and an analysis of variance (or 
Kruskal -Wallis analysis of variance )will be used to compare means (or 
distributions ) among groups, respectively . If the event is not o bserved in all 
patients  (censoring at time of analysis)  then the method of Kaplan -Meier will be 
used to estimate the median times to event and corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals will be constructed based on the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.[ADDRESS_781290] , then cumulative incidence functions (CIF) will be 
estimate d in a comp eting risk setting. In these analyses, discharge and first bowel 
movement will be the defining event s in each analysis while death without 
discharge or prior bowel movement  will be considered the competing event. 
Patients who are alive and have not yet been discharged or have not had return of 
bowel function  as of the data analysis cutoff will be censored. CIF comparisons 
among intervention groups will be made with  Gray’s test.19 
 
The secondary endpoint of procedure related complications including bleeding or 
injection of anesthetic intravascular  will be determined according to Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v 4.0) and presented as 
frequency at each grade. A Poisson regression model will be used to test the 
difference in adverse event rates between th e two groups. In this model, the 
numerator is the number of adverse events and the denominator (offset) is the 
natural log of the person days followed.

1.1.2 DME and Its Treatment  88 
DME is manifestation of diab etic retinopathy that produces loss of central vision.  DME is 89 
currently a leading cause of moderate vision loss in patients with diabetes.6  Without 90 
intervention, 33% of 221 eyes in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) with 91 
center -involved DME (CI- DME) experienced “moderate visual loss” (defined as a 15 or more 92 
letter score decrease in visual acuity) over a 3 year period.7  The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical 93 
Research Network ( DRCR.net ) study “Intravitreal Ranibizumab or Triamcinolone Acetonide in 94 
Combination with Laser Photocoagulation for Diabetic Macular Edema” (Protocol I) indicated 95 
that treatment for DME with intravitreous anti- VEGF ther apy (0.5 mg ranibizumab) with prompt 96 
or deferred focal/grid laser provides visual acuity outcomes at 1 year and 2 years that are 97 
superior to focal/grid laser alone or focal/grid laser combined with intravitreous corticosteroids.8  98 
Results of that study provided definitive confirmation of the important role of vascular 99 
endothelial growth factor (V EGF ) in DME and the superiority of anti-VEGF agents in the [ADDRESS_1111254] since confirmed the superiority of anti- 101 
VEGF agents to manage DME.9-11 102

baseline visual acuity of 20/50 or worse, 60% of bevacizumab treated eyes had a 10 or more 121 
letter improvement and 41% had a 15 or more letter improvement at 1 year. At 2 years, 66% of 122 
eyes with w orse baseline visual acuity had a 10 or more letter improvement and 52% had a 15 or 123 
more letter improvement.13 Thus, many eyes initially treated with bevacizumab for DME might 124 
gain enough vision with bevacizumab therapy that they might not derive greater benefit if given 125 
another anti-VEGF agent such as aflibercept.  Many clinicians initiate treatment with 126 
bevacizumab for patients with decreased visual acuity from DME (61% of PAT Survey 127 
respondents start with bevacizumab for decreased visual acuity from DME).  However, there is [ADDRESS_1111258] difference between 141 
the two drugs, many clinicians and patients are choosing to initiate treatment with bevacizumab 142 
and then switch to aflibercept depending on t he eye’s response to bevacizumab treatment.  [ADDRESS_1111259] moderate vision loss.    150

 Enrollment will be limited to a maximum of 25% of the planned sample 179 
size with any history of anti- VEGF treatment  for DME in the study eye. 180 
Once this number of eyes has been enrolled, any history of anti- VEGF 181 
treatment  for DME  in the study eye will be an exclusion criterion.  182 
o No history of major ocular surgery in the study eye within prior 4 months or 183

be randomized up until the end date, which means the recruitment goal might be exceeded.   284 
 285 Potential eligibility will be assessed as part of a routine -
 care examination.  Prior to completing 286 
any procedures or collecting any data that are not part of usual care, written informed consent 287 
will be obtained.  For patients who are considered potentially eligible for the study based on a 288 
routine-care exam, the study protocol will be discussed with the potential study participant by a 289 
study investigator and clinic coordinator. The potential study participant will be given the 290 
Informed Consent Form to read.  In addition, participants will be required to watch a short 291 
informational video about the trial and answer a few short questions to confirm understanding of 292 
the study.  Potential study participants will be encouraged to discuss the study with family 293 
members and their personal physician(s) before deciding whether to participate in the study.   294

FOLLOW -UP VISITS AND TREATMENT  538 
 539 
4.1 Visit Schedule  540 
The schedule of protocol- specified follow -up visits is as follows: [ADDRESS_1111291] Year  
543 
• V isits every 4±1 weeks (with a minimum of 21 days between visits) through 1 year  544 
 545 
Year 2  546 
• V isits every 4±1 weeks (with a minimum of 21 days between visits) as long as 547 
intravitreous injections are given  548 
• Otherwise, visits every 4 to 16 weeks ( ±1 week windows)  549 
 The first two times an injection is deferred, the subject will return in [ADDRESS_1111292] technicians will be masked to treatment group at the annual visits.  560 
Study participants will be  initially  masked to their treatment group assignment, but may find out 561 
the identity of the drug from billing documents.  The investigators and the study coordinators 562 
will not be masked to the treatment group assignment.        563 
 564 1. E- ETDRS visual acuity testing in each eye (best corrected).  565 
• A protocol refraction in the study eye is required at all protocol visits.  Refraction in the [ADDRESS_1111293] on the study eye   569 
• For a given study participant, the same machine type should be used for the duration of 570 
the study, unless circumstances do not permit (e.g., replacement of damaged machine).  If 571 
a switch is necessary, the same machine type should be used for the remainder of the 572 
study.  573 
3. Ocular exam on both eyes at the annual visits and study eye only at all other follow-up visits, 574 
including slit lamp examination, lens assessment, measurement of intraocular pressure and 575 
dilated ophthalmoscopy.   576 
4. Digital f undus photography on the study eye only. 577 
5. A blood pressure measurement will be collected at the annual visits. 578 
6. Laboratory testing of Hemoglobin A1c at annual visits only. 579 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       4-2 • HbA1c does not need to be repeated at annual visits if available in the prior [ADDRESS_1111294] DRCR.net protocol 586 
for each procedure. 587 
 588 4.3 Treatment During Follow Up  589 
The treatment groups are as follows: 590

See the DRCR.net Procedure Manual for additional details. 652 
 653 
4.3.3 Failure Criteria  654 
For study eyes in both treatment groups, when failure criteria is met, treatment is up to the 655 
investigator discretion .   656 
 657 
At or after the 24 week visit, if all  
 of the following criteria are met, the eye has met failure 658 
criteria and treatment is up to investigator discretion  659 
• O CT CSF thickness ≥ eligibility machine and gender specific threshold  660 
 Zeiss Cirrus  CSF : ≥290µm in women or ≥ 305µm in men 661

acuity loss 665 
• There has been no improvement in VA (>5 letters) or OCT ( >10% OCT CSF thickness) [ADDRESS_1111301] two injections  667 
 668 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       4-4 For eyes in the bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept group, the failure criteria cannot be applied 669 
prior to the eye switching to aflibercept and receiving 3 monthly injections of aflibercept.  670 
  671 
4.3.4 Laser for DME  672 
Treatment with focal/grid laser will not be permitted in the study eye(s) during the study unless 673 
failure criteria are met .  If the failure criteria listed in 4.3.3 is met, treatment (including laser) is 674 
up to investigator discretion. 675 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       5-1 CHAPTER 5                                                                                                    676 
MISCELLANEOUS CONSIDERATI ONS IN FOLLOW -UP 677 
 678 
5.1 Endophthalmitis  679 
Diagnosis and treatment of endophthalmitis is based on investigator’s judgment.  Obtaining [ADDRESS_1111302] or  DME in the non-study eye is at investigator discretion.  691 
 692 5.4 Diabetes Management  693 
Diabetes management is left to the study participant’s medical care provider.  694 
 695 5.5 Study Participant Withdrawal and Losses to Follow- up 696 
A study participant has the right to withdraw from the study at any time.  If s/he is considering [ADDRESS_1111303]-randomization 711 
will not be replaced.  712 
 713 5.6 Discontinuation of Study  714 
The study may be discontinued by [CONTACT_804988].net  Executive Committee (with approval of the 715 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee) prior to the preplanned completion of follow-up for all [ADDRESS_1111304] 725 
month after enrollment, and approximately every six months thereafter.  Additional phone 726 
contacts or mailings from the Coordinating Center will be made to fa cilitate the scheduling of the 727 
study participant for follow-up visits.  A study participant- oriented newsletter may  be sent twice 728 
a year.  A study logo item may be sent once a year.    729 
 730 Study participants will be provided with a summary of the study result s in a newsletter format 731 
after completion of the study by [CONTACT_512460].  732 
  733 5.8 Study Participant Reimbursement  734 
The study will be providing the study participant with a  $[ADDRESS_1111305] per 735 
completed non- annual study visit and $[ADDRESS_1111306] medical occurrence in a study participant, irrespective of 742 
whether or not the event is considered treatment- related.  An adverse event can therefore be any 743 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal lab finding), symptom or disease 744 
temporally associated with the use of the treatment, whether or not related to the treatment. This 745 
includes preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_1111307] been caused 760 
by [CONTACT_8235].  761 
 762 To ensure consistency of adverse event causality assessments, investigators should apply the 763 
following general guideline when de termining whether an adverse event is related:  [ADDRESS_1111308]’s clinical sta te, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the adverse event 769 
follows a known pattern of response to the study treatment; and/or the adverse event abates or 770 
resolves upon discontinuation of the study treatment or dose reduction and, if appli cable, 771 
reappears upon re- challenge.  772 
 773 No 
774 
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study treatment (e.g., 775 
pr
eexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 776 
medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal relationship to study treatment 777 
administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_1111309] dose of study drug).    778 
 779 The intensity of adverse events will be rated on a three-point scale:  (1) mild, (2) moderate, or (3) 780 
severe.  It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity:  thus, a severe adverse 781 
event is not necessarily serious.  For example, itching for several days may be rated as severe, 782 
but may not be clinically serious. 783 
 784 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       6-2 Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary.  785 
 786 
Definitions of relationship and intensity are listed on the DRCR.net website data entry form.   787 
 788 Adverse events that continue after the study participant’s discontinuation or completion of the [ADDRESS_1111310] occurrence that: 794 
• Results in death  795 
• Is life -threatening; (a non- life-threatening event which, had it been more severe, might have 796 
become life -threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious adverse event) 797 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 798 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability [ADDRESS_1111311] normal life functions (sight threatening)  800 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 801 
• Is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_13656] (e.g., 802 
may jeopardize the participant or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of 803 
the outcomes listed above) 804 
 805 
Unexpected adverse events are those that are not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in 806 
the cur rent Clinical Investigator’s Brochure, protocol, or informed consent form. [ADDRESS_1111312] be reported to the Coordinating Center immediately 809 
via completion of the online serious adverse event form. 810 
 811 The Coordinating Center will notify all participating investigators of any adverse event that is 812 
both serious and unexpected.  Notification will be made within 10 days after the Coordinating 813 
Center becomes aware of the event.   814 
 815 Each principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_27984]/her IRB of serious study- related 816

Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       6-3 6.5 Risks  828 
6.5.1 Potential Adverse Effects of Study Drugs  829 
[IP_ADDRESS] Aflibercept  [ADDRESS_1111314] common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving aflibercept  were [ADDRESS_1111315] occurred in <0.1% of 835 
intravitreous injections with aflibercept  including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. 836 
 837 The DA VINCI study, a phase II study evaluating aflibercept for treatment of DME, reported 838 
common adverse events that were consistent with those previously seen with intravitreous 839 
injections.  Over one year of follow-up, two cases of endophthalmitis and one case of uveitis 840 
occurred (all in aflibercept treatment groups).  Seven deaths (4.0%) occurred in the groups 841 
randomized to aflibercept  treatment as compared with 1 (2.3%) in the group treated with laser.  842 
Myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident occurred in 6 (3.4%) participants treated with 843 
aflibercept as compared with 1 (2.3%) participant treated with laser alone.
15  Percentages of 844 
study participants that experienced events meeting APTC c riteria were 5.1% (N  = 9) in the 845 
combined aflibercept groups and 4.5% ( N = 2) in the laser group.16  846 
  847 The DRCR.net Protocol T study assessed ocular and systemic adverse events in eyes with center- 848 
involved DME treated with aflibercept over 1 year.
17  In the aflibercept -treated study eyes, there 849 
were no cases of endophthalmitis and 2 cases of ocular inflammation. Non- study eyes treated 850 
with aflibercept had 1 case of endophthalmitis and 3 cases of ocular inflammation. Systemic 851 
adver se events were infrequent with only 6 APTC events (4 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 2 852 
deaths from a potential vascular cause or unknown cause, 6% of participants) over the 1 year 853 
period in the aflibercept group. 854 
 855 Additional safety data were published from phase III studies VISTA and VIVID, which included 856 
872 eyes with  DME  with central involvement that received either intravitreous aﬂibercept every 857 
4 weeks , intravitreous aflibercept every 8 weeks after 5 initial monthly doses , or macular laser 858 
photocoagulation.  Overall, the incidences of ocular and non- ocular adverse events were similar 859 
across treatment groups at 52 weeks.
18  The  incidence of APTC -defined thromboembolic events 860 
was similar across treatment groups.  There were no reported cases of endophthalmitis, and 861 
intraocular inflammation occurred in less than 1% of injections.  Through [ADDRESS_1111316] 863 
(2.4% and 1.0% in the aflibercept groups compared with 0.3% in the laser group).19   864 
 865 There may be side effects and discomforts that are not yet known.   866 
 867 [IP_ADDRESS] Bevacizumab  868 
In a meta-analysis performed by [CONTACT_8229], Inc on all clinical trial results using intravenously 869 
administered bevacizumab (usually dose 5 mg/kg every 14 days), it was found that study [ADDRESS_1111317] that intravitreally -administered bevacizumab in substantially 880 
smaller doses (1.25 or 2.5 mg) appears to have a good safety profile with regard to ocular and [ADDRESS_1111318] been reported in smaller, prospective randomized studies including 883 
the DRCR.net Protocol H or the BOLT study.21 Retrospective, observational data from larger 884 
patient groups also does not appear to indicate an increased risk of ocular or systemic events with 885 
intravitreal bevacizumab treatment. In 2006, an internet-based survey of 70 international sites 886 
from 12 countries was reported that described outcomes after 7,113 injections given to 5,228 887 
patients.  Rates were 0.21% or less for each category of doctor- reported adverse events, [ADDRESS_1111319] 1 year.  Systemic adverse events 893 
were reported in 1.5% (N = 18), including elevated blood pressure in 0.6% (7), cerebrovascular 894 
accidents in 0.5% (6), myocardial infarctions in 0.4% (5), iliac artery aneurysms in 0.2% (2), toe 895 
amputations in 0.2% (2), and deaths in 0.4% (5) of patients.  The overall mortality rate of 896 
diabetic patients in this study was low at 0.55% (3/548).  Ocular complication were reported as 897 
bacterial endophthalmitis in 0.2% (7), traction retinal detachments in 0.2% (7), uveitis in 0.1% 898 
(4), and a single case each of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and vitreous hemorrhage.  [ADDRESS_1111320] a worse safety profile 900 
than other anti-VEGF agents.  In the DRCR.net Protocol T randomized trial of 660 participants, 901 
Anti-Platelet Trialists’ Collaboration (APTC) events occurred in 5% with aflibercept, 8% with 902 
bevacizumab, and 13 % with ranibizumab (global P = 0.047; aflibercept vs. bevacizumab, P = 903 
0.34; aflibercept vs. ranibizumab, P = 0.047; ranibizumab vs. bevacizumab, P = 0.20).[ADDRESS_1111321] that intravitreal 906 
bevacizumab is well tolerated.  At one year, four of 286 participants (1.4%) in the monthly 907 
bevacizumab group had died and 11 of 300 participants (3.7%) in the bevacizumab given as 908 
needed group had died.  Arteriothrombolic events occurred at a rate of 2.1% and 2.7% in the 909 
monthly bevacizumab and as needed bevacizumab groups, respectively.  Venous thrombotic  910 
events occurred at rates of 1.4% and 0.3% in the monthly bevacizumab and as needed 911 
bevacizumab groups, respectively.  Endophthalmitis occurred after 0.07% of injections in [ADDRESS_1111322] for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_804982] (e.g., [ADDRESS_1111323] infections) and gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., hemorrhage and 917 
nausea and vomiting). Tw o year follow-up safety data from the CATT study did not reveal 918 
significant differences in rates of arterial thromboembolic events or death between bevacizumab 919 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       6-5 and ranibizumab treated participants.  Overall rates of serious adverse events, however, were 920 
higher among bevacizumab-treated patients (39.9%) than ranibizumab-treated patients (31.7%), [ADDRESS_1111324],  at 1 year in the IVAN study, fewer arteriothrombotic events or heart 923 
failure cases were seen in the bevacizumab treated group and there was no difference in the 924 
percentage of patients experiencing serious adverse events between the bevacizumab and 925 
ranibizumab treatment groupS.26   926 
 927 
As noted in the introduction, bevacizumab has been given intravitreally to several thousand 928 
patients with age -related macular degeneration or diabetic macular edema in doses generally of 929 
1.25 or 2.5 mg per injection (a fraction of the systemic dose).  There have not been consistent [ADDRESS_1111325] on the retina or other part s of the eye. 943 
 944 6.5.2 Potential Adverse Effects of Intravitreous Injection  945 
Rarely, the drugs used to anesthetize the eye before the study drug injections (proparacaine, 946 
tetracaine, or xylocaine) can cause an allergic reaction, seizures, and an irregular heartbeat .   947 
 948 Subconjunctival hemorrhage or floaters will commonly occur as a result of the intravitreous 949 
injection.  Discomfort, redness, or itching lasting for a few days is also likely. 950 
 951 Immediately following the injection, there may be elevation of intraocular pressure. It usually 952 
returns to normal spontaneously, but may need to be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_377424] a 953 
paracentesis to lower the pressure.  The likelihood of permanent loss of vision from elevated 954 
intraocular pressure is less than 1%. 955 
 956 As a result of the injection, endophthalmitis (infection in the eye) could develop.  If this occurs, it is 957 
treated  by [CONTACT_804989], but there is a risk of permanent loss of vision including 958 
blindness.  The risk of endophthalmitis is less than 1%. 959 
 960 As a result of the injection, a retinal detachment could occur.  If this occurs, surgery may be 961 
needed to repair the retina.  The surgery is usually successful at reattaching the retina.  962 
However, a retinal detachment can produce permanent loss of vision and even blindness.  The 963 
risk of retinal detachment is less than 1%.  964 
 965 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       6-6 The injection could cause a vitreous hemorrhage.  Usually the blood will resolve 966 
spontaneously, but if not, surgery may be needed to remove the blood.  Although the surgery 967 
usually successfully removes the blood, there is a small risk of permanent loss of vision and 968 
even blindness.  The risk of having a vitreous hemorrhage due to the injection is less than 1%. [ADDRESS_1111326] or fundus photographs.  The bright flashes used 977 
to take the photographs may be annoying, but are not painful and cause no damage. 978 
 979 
For fluorescein angiography, both the skin and urine are expected to turn yellow/orange for up to 980 
24 hours after the injection of fluorescein dye.  There is a small risk of discomfort or phlebitis at 981 
the site of the injection.  Patients occasionally experience lightheadness or nausea after dye 982 
injection which are usually transient and resolve after a few minutes without further intervention.  983 
An allergic reaction to the dye used to do the fluorescein angiography imaging is rare.  A rash or 984 
pruritus (itching) can develop, but true anaphylactic reactions are very rare.   985

STATISTICAL METHODS  987 
 988 
The approach to sample size and statistical analyses are summarized below.  A detailed statistical 989 
analysis plan will be written and finalized prior to any tabulation or analysis of study data.   990 
 991 7.1 Primary Outcome 992 
The sample size has been computed for the primary outcome, mean change in visual acuity over 993 
two years, measured using area under the curve (AUC).  994 
 995 7.2 Sample Size 996 
7.2.1 Outcome Pro jections  997 
Data from DRCR.net Protocol T was used to estimate visual acuity outcomes in the two groups.  998 
Based on the switch criteria, it is estimated that approximately 58% of the bevacizumab group [ADDRESS_1111327] 24 weeks of the trial, with the other half of the eyes that 1001 
switch distributed across the remai ning 18 months of the study. 1002 
 1003 Projected group means and required sample sizes were estimated for various scenarios after 1004 
switching. Figure 1 presents estimates of change in visual acuity over 2 years (AUC) assuming 1005 
that switching to aflibercept increases visual acuity  at each visit in the bevacizumab group from 1006 
1 to 9 letters  over what was observed in Protocol T. 1007 
 1008 Figure 1. Change in visual acuity with aflibercept, bevacizumab, or bevacizumab assuming that 1009

DSMC review) , 90% power, and a two -sided test of superiority with a null hypothesis of no 1017

 1023 
The final sample size was calculated with the following assumptions: 1024 
 1025 
• Mean change in visual acuity AUC  in the aflibercept group = 17.4 letters 1026 
• Mean change in visual acuity AUC  in the bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept group = 1027 
13.9 (assuming eyes that switch to aflibercept gain [ADDRESS_1111331] if 1028 
the eye had  remained on bevacizumab)  1029 
• Treatment group difference = 3.5  letters; Adjusted standard deviation = 8.7 letters 1030 
• Type I error rate = 4.9%; Power = 90% 1031 
• 15% increase for expected lost to follow-up 1032 
 1033 Based on the above assumptions, the total sample size is  312 participants  (156 per treatment 1034 
group) . 1035 
 1036 
7.3 Primary Analysis Plan  1037 
7.3.1 Principles for Analysis  1038 
 1039 
The primary analysis consists of a treatment group comparison of mean change in visual acuity 1040 
AUC  over 2 years adjusted for baseline visual acuity.  A linear mixed model with a random 1041 
intercept term  for participant  will be used to control for correlations arising from participants 1042 
contributing two study eyes to the analysis.  AUC will be calculated for each participant by [CONTACT_941] 1043 
trapezoidal rule using the following formula: 1044 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       7-3 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 =  ��𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖+𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖+1
2× (𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖+1−𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖)�𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖=[ADDRESS_1111332] units of letters rather than letter ⋅days.  This statistic can then be 1049 
interpreted as the average change in visual acuity over the time period between baseline and the 1050 
nth visit.  1051 
 1052 
All 4 -week visits through 52 weeks as well as the 104 week visit will be included in the 1053 
calculation of AUC as these are common to both treatment groups.  Since visits can occur every 1054 
4 to 16 weeks in year 2, depending upon disease progression, analysis windows will be defined 1055 
around 68 and 84 weeks for the purposes of calculating AUC.  Thus, the visits to be included for 1056 
calculation of the primary outcome are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 68, 84, and 1057 
104 weeks. 1058 
 1059 The primary analysis is an “inten t to treat analysis” that will include all randomized eyes [ADDRESS_1111333] for each group among 1070 
those not receiving any alternative treatment for DME (e.g., intravitreal corticosteroids). This [ADDRESS_1111334] will vary by [CONTACT_276493]/ethnicity.  However, both of these factors will be [ADDRESS_1111335] at the 52 1092 
and 104- week visits: 1093 
 1094 
• Mean change in visual acuity from baseline (also compared at the 24- week visit)  1095 
• Percentages  of eyes with a gain (increase) or loss (decrease) of at least [ADDRESS_1111336] 15 1096 
letter s of visual acuity from baseline 1097 
• Percentages of eyes with visual acuity 20/20 or greater, 20/40 or greater, and 20/200 or 1098 
worse  1099 
• Mean change in OCT central subfield thickness from baseline (also compared at the 24- 1100 
week visit)  1101 
• Percentage of eyes with OCT central subfield thickness below the gender -specific [ADDRESS_1111337] 1103 
• Mean change in OCT retinal volume 1104 
• Percent ages of eyes with worsening or improvement of diabetic retinopathy on fundus 1105 
photographs 1106 
• Percentage of eyes  receiving panretinal photocoagulation, vitrectomy, or occurr ence of 1107 
vitreous hemorrhage, traction retinal detachment, neovascularization of the iris, or 1108 
neovascular glaucoma from proliferative diabetic retinopathy  1109 
• Number of visits through 2 years  1110 
• Number of injections 1111 
• Percentage of eyes that met switch criteria by [CONTACT_941] 12, 24, 52, or 104- week visit s 1112 
(bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept group only) 1113 
 1114 
Binary outcomes will be analyzed using binomial regression with generalized estimation 1115 
equations ( GEE ) to control for correlations arising from participants contributing two study eyes 1116 
to the analysis.  If binomial regression fails to converge in one or more outcomes, then logistic 1117 
regression with a random intercept for participant, conditional standardization, and the delta 1118 
method (to estimate the risk difference)[ADDRESS_1111338] effectiveness ratio (ICER)  will be calculated.  Data from the clinical trial on 1128 
number of clinic visits completed, number of procedures performed (e.g., OCT, fundus 1129 
photographs), and number of aflibercept and bevacizumab treatments will be used to estimate an [ADDRESS_1111339]’s [ADDRESS_1111340] for the potential correlations arising from participants 1142 
with two study eyes; however, given the low expected frequency of adverse events, and small [ADDRESS_1111341]:  [ADDRESS_1111342]  1149 
o Vitreous hemorrhage  1150 
o Ocular i nflammation  1151 
o Intraocular pressure elevation  1152 
o Neovascular glaucoma  1153 
o Iris neovascularization  1154 
 1155 Systemic adverse events  will be reported in three groups : 1) unilateral participants randomized to 1156 
bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept, 2) unilateral participants randomized to aflibercept, and 3) 1157 
bilateral participants randomized to bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept in one eye and [ADDRESS_1111343] once per participant 1159 
will be calculated.  The percentage of participants experiencing each outcome will compared 1160 
with Fisher’ s exact test.  If the overall test has P ≤  0.05, then pairwise comparisons between 1161 
groups also will be conducted using Fisher’s exact test without further adjustment for multiple [ADDRESS_1111344]:  1165 
o Death  1166 
o Serious adverse event (at least one)  1167 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (at least one)  1168 
o Cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events according to Antiplatelet Trialists’ 1169 
Collaboration (excerpted from BMJ Jan 8, 1994): 1170 
 Non-fatal myocardial infarction  1171 
 Non-fatal stroke (counted only if symptoms lasted at least 24 hours) 1172 
 Death attributed to cardiac, cerebral, hemorrhagic, embolic, other vascular 1173 
cause (does not need to be ischemic in origin), or unknown cause 1174 
• Notes: Transient ischemic attacks, angina, and possible myocardial [ADDRESS_1111345]:  1180 
 For each MedDRA system organ class, percentage of participants with at least 1181 
one event  1182 
 1183 
A tabulation of all study eye ocular, non- study eye ocular, and systemic adverse events will be 1184 
tabulated according to treatment group as described above. 1185 
 1186 7.7 Additional Tabulations and Analyses  1187 
The following will be tabulated according to treatment group: 1188 
 1189 
1) Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics  1190 
2) Visit completion rate  1191 
3) Treatment adherence  [ADDRESS_1111346] central subfield thickness from baseline at 104 weeks will be 1198 
tested  as secondary outcomes . The Holm method will be used to provide strong control of alpha 1199 
at 0.05.
28 If the primary analysis fails to show a significant difference, then outcomes will be 1200 
described with summary statistics , model-based point es timates,  and between -group 95% 1201 
confidence intervals without P values. This approach controls the family- wise error rate at 5%.  1202 
 1203 There will be no formal adjustment for multiplicity in sensitivity, subgroup , or safety analyses . 1204 
For exploratory subgroup analyses, the number of significant results expected by [CONTACT_804990] 1205 
the number of comparisons will be noted. 1206

A Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Phase 2a Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
Immunogenicity of Seasonal Influenza Vaccine and Ad26.RSV.preF, with and without Co-
administration, in Adults Aged 60 Years and Older in Stable Health
Ad26.RSV.preF (JNJ-64400141), a replication -incompetent adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) 
containing a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) transgene that encodes for the pre-fusion conformation-
stabilized F protein (pre -F) derived from the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] ( RSV )A2 strain .
RATIONALE
Influenza and respi[INVESTIGATOR_287029], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
morbidity and mortality in the elderly . Influenza vaccines are given yearly before the start of the influenza 
season and it is likely that an RSV vaccine would be given at the same time, as both RSV and influenza 
seasons overlap . This study will examine the effect on the safety and immunogenicity of both vaccines of 
giving a seasonal influenza vaccine and Ad26.RSV.preF at the same time and at separate times to provide 
an indication of whether these va ccines can be used concomitantly.
OBJECTIVE S, ENDPOINTS, AND HYPOTHESIS
Primary Objective s
To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the concomitant administration of Ad26.RSV.pre Fand 
seasonal influenza vaccine versus the administration of seasonal influenza vaccine alone in terms of 
humoral immune response expressed by [CONTACT_667127] (GMTs) of hemagglutination 
inhibition (HI) antibody titers against all four influenza vaccine strains 28days after the 
administ ration of influenza vaccine , using a non-inferiority margin of 2 for the GMT ratio (control 
group/co- administration group)
To assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of 1x1011viral particles (vp) of Ad26.RSV.preF, 
administered intramuscularly to subjects aged ≥60 years separately or concomitantly with seasonal 
influenza vaccine
Secondary Objective s
To com pare the safety of seasonal influenza vaccine administered separately and concomitantly with 
Ad26.RSV.preF
To assess humoral immune responses to RSV after the administration of Ad26.RSV.pre F
administered separately or concomitantly with seasonal influenza vaccine
To assess humoral immune responses to influenza after the administration of seasonal influenza 
vaccine administered separately or concomitantly with Ad26.RSV.preF, in terms of geometric mean 
fold rises from baseline of HI antibody titers against the four influenza vaccine strains
Seroconversion rates against the four influenza vaccine strains defined as a post-vaccination titer 
≥1:40 in subjects with a pre-vaccination titer of <1:10, or a ≥4-fold titer increase in subjects with a
pre-vaccination titer of ≥1:10
Seroprotection rates against the four influenza vaccine strains defined as the percentage of subjects 
with a post -vaccination titer ≥1:40

Hypothesis
To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the concomitant administration of Ad26.RSV.preF and seasonal 
influenza vaccine versus the administration of seasonal influenza vaccine, 28 days after the administration 
of the seasonal influenza vaccine in terms of humoral immune response, the following hypothesis will be 
tested for each one of the four influenza vaccine strains: 
Null Hypothesis:
The GMT of HI antibody titers against one vaccine strain, 28days after concomitant administration 
of Ad26.RSV.preF and seasonal influenza vaccine is inferior by [CONTACT_2669] 2 to the GMT 28days after
the administration of seasonal influenza v accine
Alternative Hypothesis:
The GMT of HI antibody titers against one vaccine strain, 28days after concomitant administration 
of Ad26.RSV.preF and seasonal influenza vaccine is non-inferior to the GMT 28days after the 
administration of seasonal influe nza vaccine, using a non-inferiority margin of 2, for the ratio 
GMT control group /GMT co-administration group
No formal statistical testing of safety data is planned. All safety data will be analyzed descriptively by 
[INVESTIGATOR_24858].
OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN
This is a single center, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind Phase 2astudy, to be conducted in 
180 adult male and female subjects aged ≥60years of age in stable health randomized in parallel in a 1:1 
ratio to one of twogroups . Group 1 will receive 1x1011vp Ad26.RSV.preF on Day 1 administered at the 
same time as a commercially available seasonal influenza vaccine, and placebo on Day 29. Group 2 will 
receive placebo on Day 1, administered at the same time as a commercially available seasonal influenza 
vaccine, and 1x1011vp Ad26.RSV.preF on Day 29. All study vaccines will be given by [CONTACT_667128]. An internal data review committee (DRC) will be commissioned for this study.

After each vaccination, subjects will be closely observ ed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_900573]-vaccination 
to monitor for the development of any acute reactions, or longer if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093]. 
Any unsolicited, solicited local or systemic AEs will be documented by [CONTACT_3449] -site personnel following 
this observation period. Subjects will be given a thermometer, ruler and daily assessment (subject) diary 
with instructions for the proper recording of events. Each subject will record solicited local (at injection 
site) and systemic AEs and body temperatures, beginning on the evening of each study vaccine dosing 
day and on a daily basis for the following [ADDRESS_900574] diary information and confirm  
the entries at subsequent site visits .
Unsolicited AEs will be collected from ICF signature [CONTACT_10782] 28 days after the second vaccination. SAEs 
will be collected from ICF signature [CONTACT_667164] . All AEs, including any that are ongoing 28 
days after the second vaccination , will be followed until clinical resolution or stabilization. Concomitant 
medications will be collected and recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) from the time of first 
vaccination through 28 days after the second vaccination, and additionally outside of this period when 
associated with an SAE.
Blood will be collected from all subjects to assess humoral immune responses pre-vaccination on each 
dosing day, and at 28days after the second vaccination (or at the early exit visit if the subject prematurely 
terminates the study before Day 57without withdrawing consenta); cellular immune responses may be 
assessed at these timepoints in a subset co ntaining 40 randomized subjects (ie, 20 per group) .
An independent unblinded statistician and unblinded biomarker representative will present data to the 
DRC if non-inferiority of the concomitant administration of influenza vaccine with Ad26.RSV.preF 
versus the administration of influenza vaccine alone is not demonstrated, based on the immunogenicity 
analysis at [ADDRESS_900575] dose. The DRC will decide if subjects should be offered repeat influenza 
immunization (see the Planned Analyses section for more details).
The study duration will be approximately 30weeks per participant. The study comprises vaccination for 
each subject on Day [ADDRESS_900576]’s last visit by 
[CONTACT_1381] [ADDRESS_900577]:

Approved , Date: 6 December 2017Subjects should contact [CONTACT_779]
Subjects should record signs and symptoms of the RTI (including measurement of oral body 
temperature) daily using the RTI Symptoms Form until the day of symptom resolution
If feasible, subjects should take a nasal turbinate sample at home . Alternatively, subjects may go to 
the site within [ADDRESS_900578] nasal turbinate samples taken by [CONTACT_464] .
Nasal turbinate samples will be stored refrigerated at home and brought to the site within the next 3 to 4 
days. The presence of RSV infection will be assessed by [CONTACT_667129] (RT -PCR) diagnostics on the nasal turbinate samples.
Blood from any subject with a suspected RTI may be assayed by a serological assay (eg, protein G and/or 
N ELISA) to confirm RSV infection. Note: No additional blood sampling is necessary –any serological 
assay conducted to confirm RSV infection will use blood from the existing samples. Signs and symptoms 
of RTIs will also be reported as unsolicited AEs if they occur between first vaccination and 28 days 
following the second vaccination; any RTI fulfilling the criteria of an SAE would be reported as such 
during the entire study period.
SUBJECT POPULATION
Subjects willbe adult men and women, aged ≥60years on the day of signing the ICF. All subjects will be 
in good or stable heal th (on the basis of physical examination, medical history, 12 -lead electrocardiogram
(ECG) and vital signs measurement performed on Day 1 ).
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
On Day [ADDRESS_900579] will receive separateintramuscular injections of Ad26.RSV.preF or 
placebo, and of a seasonal influenza vaccine, according to the schedule shown in Table 1.
Ad26.RSV.preF (JNJ-64400141) : will be supplied at a concentration of 2x1011vp/1.0mL in single -

STATISTICAL METHODS
Sample Size Determinationa
As four seasonal influenza strains will be assessed for which non -inferiority is to be shown, 94.6% power 
is required for each individual seasonal influenza strain to ensure an overall power of at least 80%. To 
have 94.6% power for an individual influenza strain, 86 evaluable subjects/group are required. If 
approximately 5% subjects areunevaluable (due to dropout, missing data, or seasonal influenza), 90 
randomized subjects/arm will be needed.
This sample size ensures at least 80% power, assuming statistic al independence between the HI antibody  
titers for the four seasonal influenza strains. As some correlation between the response sto the four strains 
is likely, the actual overall power may be higher.
Planned Analys es
[ADDRESS_900584] dose immunogenicity analysis : at [ADDRESS_900585] the four influenza 
vaccine strains. The independent unblinded statistician and unbli nded biomarker representative will 
present data to the DRC if non-inferiority of concomitant versus separate administration is not 
demonstrated . The DRC will decide if subjects should be offered repeat influenza immunization after 
Day 5 7.
Primary analysis: 28days post-second dose safety and immunogenicity analysis. This analysis will 
be performed based on unblinded data. The goal of this analysis will be to evaluate the primary 
objective s.Theblind will be maintained at the subject/site level.
Final analy sis:6months post -second dose safety analysis. This analysis will be performed based on 
unblinded data. The goal of this analysis will be to assess safety.
Immunogenicity Analys es
The primary immunogenicity objective will be assessed by [CONTACT_70849] 95% one-sided upper 
confidence limit for the difference in log -transformed HI antibody titers for each of the four seasonal 
influenza vaccine strains between control and co-administration groups. The confidence limit will be 
calculated using Welch’s t-interval method. The confidence limit will be back -transformed (by 
[CONTACT_151698]) to a GMT ratio and compared to the non -inferiority limit of 2.
Only if the 95% one-sided upper confidence limit for the GMT ratio (Control group/Co- administration
group) of the HI antibody titers lies below 2 for each of the four vaccine strains, non-inferiority of co-
administration versus separate administration will be concluded. If one or more confidence limits for the 
GMT ratio exceed 2, non- inferiority cannot be concluded. 
As a sensitivity analysis, the primary endpoint will also be evaluated adjusting for baseline HI levels.
                                                
aSample size calculation assumes: (a) immune response is measured by [CONTACT_667132]; (b) a standard deviation of 2 at the log 2scale for HI antibody titers

actual values and the changes from baseline where a ppropriate. Descriptive statistics (geometric mean and 
95% confidence interval for ELISA ,virus neutralization and HI assays; median and quartiles for ELISpot 
and intracellular cytokine staining [ICS]) will be calculated for continuous immunologic parameters at all 
timepoints. For the humoral assays, geometric mean fold rises from baseline and corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals might additionally be calculated. For immunogenicity, baseline is considered as the 
last assessment pre-vaccination. Graphical representations of immunologic parameters will be made as 
applicable.

Approved , Date: 6 December [ZIP_CODE]. INTRODUCTION
A human adenovirus -vectored vaccine candidate which hasshown promise in preclinical animal 
models of respi[INVESTIGATOR_227899] (RSV) will be assessed in this study :
Ad26.RSV.preF (JNJ-64400141), a replication -incompetent adenovirus seroty pe 26 (Ad26) 
containing a deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) transgene that encodes for the pre-fusion 
conformation -stabilized F protein (pre -F) derived from the RSV A2 strain.
For the most comprehensive nonclinical information regarding Ad26.RSV.preF , refer to the 
latest version of the Investigator’ s Brochure for Ad26.RSV.preF .1
The term “sponsor ”used throughout this document refers to the entities listed in the Contact

1.1. Background
Background
RSV is an important cause of serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_624613] y, immunocompromised, 
and those with underl ying chronic cardiopulmonary  conditions.9Although most adults mount a 
long-lasting fullyprotectiv e immune response, waning immune responses in the elderl y might
contribute to increased susceptibility  to severe disease after RSV infection causing significant 
morbidity  and mortalit y. In long-term care facilities, RSV is estimated to infect 5 to 10% of the 
residents per year with significant rates of pneumonia (10% to 20%) and death (2% to 5%).10In 
an epi[INVESTIGATOR_624614], it was estimate d that 11,000 elderly persons die annuall y 
of RSV in the [LOCATION_002] ( US).28These data support the importance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_667111], such as the elderl y.
RSV is also considered to be the most important cause of serious acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_667112] 5 years of age: worldwide in 2005, RSV caused an estimated 
33.[ADDRESS_900590] vaccine 
candidate for young children, which consisted of formalin -inactivated RSV (FI-RSV), was 
associated with enhanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_23715] (ERD) upon infection with RSV .15Although the 
mechanisms for ERD are not fully  understood, it is thought that FI-RSV failed to induce 
adequate neutralizing antibody  titers and CD8 priming, and induced a T-helper 2 (Th2) skewed 
response .[ADDRESS_900591] been exposed to RSV, and therefore previously  primed by a  live virus 
infection, enhanced disease is not expected to be a concern in this study .6

Approved , Date: 6 December 2017Adenoviral- vectored Vaccines
It is thought that an efficacious RSV vaccine should induce high levels of neutralizing 
antibodies, CD8+T-cell responses, and Th1- type CD4+T cells .3The candidate RSV vaccine 
being evaluated in this protocol is based on the AdVac®platform which has been shown to 
promote a strong antibody  response, as well as CD8+T cell and Th1 -type CD4+T-cell responses.
The immunogenicity  profile of adenoviral vectors, with particular emphasis on Th1 responses, is 
illustrated by [CONTACT_327961]26 -vectored human 
immunodeficiency  virus (HIV) vaccine (Ad26.ENVA.01), and of adults and infants with Ad35 -
vectored tuberculosis (TB) vaccine (Ad35.TB -S). These data show predominantly  interferon 
gamma (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) production in CD4+and CD8+T 
cells.2,5,24Furthermore, in mice, Ad26 -and Ad35 -vectored vaccines with circumsporozoite (CS) 
transgene inserts (Ad26.CS.01 and Ad35.CS.01), when administered as singl e immunizations or 
in combination as a heterologous prime -boost regimen at dose levels ranging from 1×108vp 
(viral particles) to 1×1010vp, induce predominantly  CD8+T-cell responses, as well as mainly 
immunoglobulin IgG2a antibody  responses, indicative of a Th1 -biased response .25
Ad26.RSV.FA2 Clinical Data
Ad26 encoding for the wild-typeRSV FA2 transgene, Ad26.RSV.FA2, has been evaluated in 
studies VAC18192RSV1001 and VAC18192RSV1003 (N = 48 and 32, respectivel y, of which 
35 and 24subjects, respectivel y, received Ad26.RSV.FA2) in adults at doses of 5×1010vp. All 
subject visits have bee n completed in both studies.
Results indicate that there have been no safet y concerns following vaccination in either study . 
After vaccination with Ad26.RSV.FA2, local reactogenicity  comprised almost exclusively  mild 
to moderate pain of median duration [ADDRESS_900592] commonly  experienced solicited 
systemic adverse events (AEs; headache, fatigue, chills, myalgia) were also mostly  mild to 
moderate and of median duration 1 to 3 days; most unsolicited AEs and most laboratory 
abnormalities were mild to moderate in severity . No serious adverse events (SAEs) were 
reported and no AEs led to withdrawal from stud y vaccine .31
Single vaccination with 5×1010vp Ad26.RSV.FA2 raised humoral and cellular immunity . An 
increase in RSV neutraliz ing antibody  titers was observed; RSV -specific T- cell responses were 
also increased.
FA2 and preF RSV Vaccines
The candidate vaccine assessed in this study  is Ad26.RSV.preF, ie, a replication -incompetent 
Ad26 containing a DNA transgene that encodes for thepre-fusion conformation -stabilized F 
protein derived from the RSV A2 strain.
First-in-human clinical studies (VAC18192RSV1001 [first-in-human (FIH)for Ad35.RSV.FA2] 
and VAC18192RSV1003 [FIH for Ad26.RSV.FA2]) have been completed with vaccines

Approved , Date: 6 December 2017Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad35.RSV.FA2, in which Ad26 and Ad35, respectively, encode for a wild-
type RSV F protein of the RSV A2 strain (FA2).
The F protein of RSV undergoes a conformational transition from a metastable pre-fusion 
conformation to a stable post -fusion conformation. Neutralizing sensitive epi[INVESTIGATOR_624616], but recent evidence indicates that those epi[INVESTIGATOR_624617] -F protein seem to be 
more potent than those present on the post-F protein.12,13This evidence resulted in the design of 
the candidate RSV vaccine (Ad26.RSV.preF) in which the adenoviral vector encodes for a full 
length RSV F protein stabilized in the pre-F protein conformation. 
 
This change in the transgene confers more 
stability  to the pre-fusion form of the molecule before it undergoes its natural transition to the 
post-fusion form .18This change also induces higher immune responses against pre-fusion 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_624618]-fusion protein 
conformation .19,23For these reasons, it is anticipated that the Ad26.RSV.preF vaccine candidate 
will generate more neutralizing antibodies rel ative to the Ad26.RSV.FA2 vaccine.31
Ad26.RSV.preF Preclinical Data
Preclinical studies were performed in naïve and RSV pre-exposed animals. Ad26.RSV.preF is 
immunogenic in mice and cotton rats, with humoral responses that include the induction of RSV 
neutralizing antibodies. In addition, Ad26.RSV.preF was shown to elicit cellular responses in 
mice, characterized by [CONTACT_624670] F-specific CD8+ IFNγ+ T cells. Single 
immunization with Ad26.RSV.preF protects cotton rats from challenge with RSV A2 and RSV B 
strains .31
Ad26.RSV.preF Clinical Data
Ad26.RSV.preF is under evaluation in the ongoing FIH Phase 1 study  VAC18193RSV1003 in 
subjects aged ≥[ADDRESS_900593] (Day 1) of 2 intramuscular injections as follows:
Group 1 – 5×1010vp Ad26.RSV.preF on Day 1 and 1 y ear (± 1 month) later;
Group 2 – 5×1010vp Ad26.RSV.preF on Day 1 and placebo 1 year (± 1 month) later;
Group 3 – 1×1011vp Ad26.RSV.preF on Day 1 and 1 y ear (± 1 month) later;
Group 4 – 1×1011vp Ad26.RSV.preF on Day 1 and placebo 1 year (± 1 month) later;
Group 5 –placebo on Day 1 and 1 year (± 1 month) later.
Safety  and immunogenicity  data from the unblinded interim analysis [ADDRESS_900594]-Dose 1 from 
all 72 subjects who received Ad26.RSV.preF (5×1010vp or 1×1011vp) or placebo confirmed the 
immunogenicit y of thevaccine; the 1×1011vp dose of Ad26.RSV.preF was more immunogenic 
than the 5×1010vp dose. No safet y concerns were revealed; the reactogenicity  of both doses was 
comparable.

Approved , Date: 6 December 2017For study  VAC18193RSV1003, Ad26.RSV.preF was provided in a different buffer (Form ulation 
Buffer 1a) from the one to be used in the current study  (Formulation Buffer 2b). The formulation 
buffer was changed to enhance the Ad26.RSV.preF drug product stability  at 2 to 8 °C for storage 
purposes in future studies. The new formulation buffer was considered well-tolerated when 
tested in a nonclinical single dose intramuscular safety  study  in rabbits.31
Safety Data Supporting Ad26.RSV.preF Dose Selection from Other Ad26 -based Vaccines
In addition to the 2 completed studi es with Ad26.RSV.FA2 and 1 ongoing study  with 
Ad26.RSV.preF, the dose levels for Ad26.RSV.preF used in this study  are supported by 
[CONTACT_667134]26 vaccines encoding for different antigens (EnvA [in 
Ad26.ENVA.[ADDRESS_900595] HIV];4,5CS protein [in Ad26.CS.[ADDRESS_900596] malaria] ;7,24and Ebola 
glycoprotein [in Ad26.ZEBOV against Ebola virus ]21). Note that, in general, at a given dose 
level, no significant changes in the safet y profiles of Ad26 -based vaccines have been seen when 
the transgene has been changed.
In completed clinical studies, the safet y of Ad26.ENVA.01, Ad26.CS.[ADDRESS_900597] received 
5×1010vp, and found to be well-tolerated. In addition, four Phase [ADDRESS_900598] been completed in adults: [ADDRESS_900599] received Ad26.ZEBOV at 5×1010vp and 
1×1011vpwithout significant safet y issues: [ADDRESS_900600] received 1×1011vp (25 doses 
administered), and [ADDRESS_900601] received 5×1010vp. The safety  data from these Ebola 
studies showed no safety  concerns at 5×1010vp and 1×1011vp. Overall, these clinica l data are 
supportive of dosing Ad26.RSV.preF at 1×1011vp in the current stud y.

Unsolicited AEs will be collected from ICF signature [CONTACT_10782] 28 days after the second 
vaccination. SAEs will be collected from ICF signature [CONTACT_667166] . All AEs, 
including any that are ongoing 28 days after the second vaccination, will be followed until 
clinical resolution or stabilization. Concomitant medications will be collected and recorded in the 
electronic case report form (eCRF) f rom the time of first vaccination through 28 days after the 
second vaccination, and additionally  outside of this period when associated with an SAE.
Blood will be collected from all subjects to assess humoral immune responses pre -vaccination on 
each dosing day, and at 28 days after the second vaccination (or at the early exit visit if the 
subject prematurel y terminates the study  before Day 57without withdrawing consenta); cellular

Two initial FIH studies (VAC18192RSV1001, N = 48;VAC18192RSV1003, N = 32) in health y 
adults examining homologous and heterologous regimens of 5×1010vp of Ad26.RSV.FA2 and 
5×1010vp of Ad35.RSV.FA2 have been completed. Both Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad35.RS V.FA2 
were shown to be safe and immunogenic.
One subsequent FIH study  (VAC18193RSV1003, N = 72) in adults aged 60 years and older in 
stable health examining homologous regimens of 5×1010vp and 1×1011vp of Ad26.RSV.preF is 
ongoing. All [ADDRESS_900609]-Dose 1 from all 72 subjects who received 
Ad26.RSV.preF ( 5×1010vp or 1×1011vp) or placebo did not reveal an y safety  concerns.
Dose Selection
The rationale behind selection of the Ad26 vector and dose selection is described in Section 1.1.
Rationale for Vaccine Regimen Select ion
Influenza vaccines are given yearly before the start of the season and it is likely  that an RSV 
vaccine would be given at the same time. This study  will examine the effect on the 
immunogenicit y of both vaccines of giving a seasonal influenza vaccine and Ad26.RSV.preF at 
the same time and at separate times to provide an indication of whether these vaccines can be 
used concomitantly .Safety –7days post -first vaccin ation *Screening and

5. STUDY V ACCINE ALLOCA TION AND BLIND ING
Study Vaccine Allocation
If cellular immune response s are evaluated by [CONTACT_779], subjects will be assigned to two strata 
prior to randomization, depending on their consent to blood sampling for peripheral blood 
mononuclear cell (PBMC )assessment and the PBMC sampling capability  of the site. The first 
stratum will contain a maximum of 40 subjects from whom PBMC samples will be collected. 
The second stratum will contain the remaining subjects, to reach the target of a total of 180 
subjects in the study : from these subjects no PBMC samples will be collected. After a maximum 
of [ADDRESS_900622] will 
be randomized 1:1 to one of the two groups. The two strata will be randomized in parallel, 
depending on the PBMC capability  of the site.
If cellular immune responses are not evaluated by [CONTACT_779], then subjects will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_900623] dose: If randomized 
subjects are withdrawn from vaccination before the first dose is administered, additional subjects 
may be recruited to replace these subjects at the discretion of the sponsor. Any replacement 
subject will be assigned to the same group as theoriginal (discontinued) subject. The

discontinued subject [PHONE_3548] (for example subject [ADDRESS_900625] 1001).
Withdrawal of randomized subjects from vacc ination after the first dose (for reasons other 
than due to an AE): Any randomized subject who is withdrawn from the study  for reasons other 
than due to an AE after the first dose but before the second dose might be replaced at the 
discretion of the sponsor. Any replacement subject will be assigned to the same group as the 
original (discontinued) subject. The replacement subject’s randomization number will equal the 
randomization number of the discontinued subject [PHONE_10364].
Blinding
The investigator will be provided with a sealed randomization code for each subject, containing 
coded details of study  vaccine allocation . All randomization codes, whether opened or sealed, 
will be collected after the end of the subject ’s participation in the study .
Unblindingawill only occur at the time of database lock of the primary analysis. While the 
responsibility  to break the study  vaccine allocation code in emergency  situations resides solel y 
with the investigator, it is recommended that the investigator contact [CONTACT_667137], before breaking the blind. Telephone contact [CONTACT_111131] 24hours per day, 7days per week. In such cases, the 
investigator may in an emergency  determine the identi ty of the study  vaccine by [CONTACT_667138]. In the event the blind is broken, the sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. 
The date, time and reason for the unblinding must be documented in the appropriate section of 
the eCRF. The investigator is advised not to reveal the study  vaccine assignment to the study -site 
personnel or sponsor personnel.
The subjects, study -site personnel (including the vaccine administrator) and investigator will be 
blinded to study  vaccine allocation throughout the study, except for the pharmacist or qualified 
staff member with primary  responsibility  for study  vaccine preparation and dispensing. Note : 
Only  Ad26.RSV.preF administration will be blinded; Fluarix administration will not be blinded.
If the randomization code is broken by [CONTACT_373418] -site personnel, the subject 
must discontinue further study  vaccine administration and must be followed as appropriate (see 
Section 10.2 for details). If the randomization code is broken by [CONTACT_576673] y reporting 
purposes, the subject should not discontinue further study  vaccine administration and may 
remain in the study  (ifthe randomization code is still blinded to the study -site personnel and the 
subject).

of pain/tenderness is self-reported (if a subject is unable to provide self-report, other 
reporters inc lude famil y member /caregiver or health care provider).[ADDRESS_900647] be described by [CONTACT_667146].
oInjection Site Swelling/Induration
Injection site swelling is a visible enlargement of an injected limb. It may be either soft 
(typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] ) or firm (less typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]). Injection site induration is a palpable thickening, 
firmness, or hardening of softtissue, usually  has well-demarcated palpable borders, can 
be visible (raised or sunken compared to surrounding skin), is often ‘woody ’ to touch 
and has a flat shape. As differentiation between swelling and induration may be difficult 
without health care professional’s assessment, both symptoms have been combined to 
allow self-assessment by [CONTACT_748]. Both swelling and induration can best be 
described b y looking and measuring.
Note : Any other injection site events not meeting the above case definitions should be 
reported separatel y as unsolicited AEs.16,[ADDRESS_900648] temperature of

Blood from any subject with a suspected RTI may be assay ed by a serological assay  (eg, protein 
G and/or N ELISA) to confirm RSV infection. Note : No additional blood sampling is necessary  –
any serological assay  conducted to confirm RSV infection will use blood from the existing  
samples.
Signs and symptoms of RTIs will also be reported as unsolicited AEs if they occur between first 
vaccination and 28 days following the second vaccination; any RTI fulfilling the criteria of an 
SAE would be reported as such during the entire study  period. Signs and symptoms of RTIs will

Any related AE, worsening of health status or intercurrent illness that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], requires study  vaccine discontinuation
Withdrawal from the Study
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study  at any time for any reason without 
affec ting the right to treatment by [CONTACT_093]. Although the subject is not obliged to give a 
reason for withdrawing prematurel y, the investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain 
the reason(s) while full y respecting the subject’s rights.
A subject will be withdrawn from the stud y for any of the following reasons:
Repeated failure to comply  with protocol requirements
Decision b y the sponsor or the investigator to stop or cancel the stud y
Decision by [CONTACT_667149] l Review Board/ Independent Ethics 
Committee (I RB/IEC) to stop or cancel the study
Lost to follow -up
Withdrawal of consent
Death
Any unnecessary  study discontinuation should be avoided. Should a subject be withdrawn, all 
efforts should be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughl y as possible. 
Whenever a subject is withdrawn from the study , independent of the reason, a final evaluation 
should be completed for that subject and the major reason for which the subject was withdrawn 
must be stated. If a subject is lost to follow -up, every  reasonable effort must be made by [CONTACT_10748] -site personnel to contact [CONTACT_23814]/
withdrawal. The measures taken to follow -up must be documented.
When a subject withdraws before completing the study , the reason for withdrawal is to be 
documented in the eCRF and in the source document. Study  vaccine assigned to the withdrawn 
subject may not be assigned to another subject. In general, subjects who withdraw will notbe 
replaced, unless that subject was randomized but did not receive any study  vaccine . However, 
any randomized subject withdrawn from the study  for reasons other than due to an AE after the 
first dose but before the second dose might be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor.

refuse.
Withdrawal from the Use of Samples in Future Res earch
The subject may withdraw consent for use of samples for future research (refer to Section 
16.2.5 ). In such a case, samples will be destroy ed after they are no longer needed for the clinical 
study . Details of the sample retention for research are presented in the main I CF.
10.3. Contraindications to Vaccination
The following events constitute a contraindication to vaccination at that point in time. If any of 
these events occur at the scheduled time for vaccination, the subject may be vaccinated up to 
10days beyond the scheduled vaccination, or be withdrawn from further vaccination at the 
discretion of the investigator and after consultation with the sponsor:
Severe acute illness at the time of vaccination. This does not include minor illnesses such as 
diarrhea.
Fever ( body temperature ≥38.0 °C) at the time of vaccination.
Note : Other licensed vaccines should be given at least 14 days before or 14 days after study 
vaccine administration (see Section 4.3).
11. STATISTICA L METHODS
Statistical analysis will be done by [CONTACT_43758]. A general 
description of the statistical methods to be used to analy ze the immunogenicity and safet y data is 
outlined below. Specific details will be provided in the Statistical Ana lysis Plan (SAP) .
Planned anal ysesare described in Section 11.6.
The vaccine groups are labeled “CoAd” and “Control” as follows in the remainder ofthis 
section:
Group N Day 1 Day 2 9
CoAd 90 Ad26.RSV.preF (1x1011vp) + Fluarix Placebo
Control 90 Placebo + Fluarix Ad26.RSV.preF (1x1011vp)
11.1. Analysis Sets
The Full Anal ysis (FA) Setincludes all subjects who were randomized and received at least one 
dose of study  vaccine, regardless of the occurrence of protocol deviations and vaccine type 
VAC1819 3(JNJ-64400141)
Clinical Protocol Amendment VAC18193RSV2003
46
Approved , Date: 6 December 2017(seasonal influenza, Ad26.RSV.preF or placebo). Vaccination assignment will follow the as-
treated principle. All safety  and subject information anal yses will be based on the FA set. 
The Per-protocol Influenza Immunogenicit y (PPII) Setwill include all subjects who were 
randomized and received the first vaccination for whom immunogenicity  data are available, 
excluding subject samples with major protocol deviations expecting to impact the 
immunogenicit y outcomes.
In addition, the following samples will not be included in the PPII set:
For subjects who experience a seasonal influenza infection (based on RT-PCR, or other 
sources), samples taken after the natural infection will not be taken into account in the 
assessment of the immunogenicity  of the seasonal influenza vaccine
The analysis of primary  immunogenicit y endpoint will be based on the PPII set. The analysis of 
all secondary  and exploratory  immunogenicit y endpoints related to influenza will also be based 
on the PPII set.Depending on the number of samples excluded, a post-hoc exploratory  analysis 
might be performed, including the excluded samples. To visualize these excluded samples, 
subject profiles from several assays might be repeated, indicating the excluded samples.
The Per-protocol RSV Immunogenicit y (PPRI) Setwill include all randomized and fully 
vaccinated subjects (all three vaccinations, ie, seasonal influenza, Ad26.RSV.preF and placebo) 
for whom immunogenicity  data are available, excluding subject samples with major protocol 
deviations expecting to impact the immunogenicity outcomes .
In addition, the following samples will not be included in the PP RI set:
For subjects who experience a natural RSV infection (based on RT-PCR, or other sources), 
samples taken after the natural infection will not be taken into account in the assessment of 
the immunogenicit y of Ad26.RSV.preF
The analy sis of allsecondary  and exploratory  immunogenicit y endpoints related to RSV will 
also be based on the PPRI set.Depending on the number of samples excluded, a post-hoc 
exploratory  analysis might be performed, including the excluded samples. To visualize these 
exclu ded samples, subject profiles from several assay s might be repeated, indicating the 
excluded samples.
11.2. Sample Size Determination
Sample size calculations are performed under the following assumptions:
immune response is measured b y HI antibod ytiters against the four influenza vaccine strains
a standard deviation of 2 at the log 2scale for HI  antibody  titers.
VAC1819 3(JNJ-64400141)
Clinical Protocol Amendment VAC18193RSV2003
47
Approved , Date: 6 December 2017As four seasonal influenza strains will be assessed for which non-inferiority  is to be shown, 
94.6% power is required for each individual seasonal influenza strain to ensure an overall power 
of at least 80%. To have 94.6% power for anindividual influenza strain, 86 evaluable 
subjects/group are required . If approximately  5% subjects areunevaluable (due to dropout, 
missing data, or seasonal influenza), 90 randomized subjects/arm will be needed .
This sample size ensures at least 80% power, assuming statistical independence between the HI 
antibody titers for the four seasonal influenza strains. As some correlation between the response s
to the four strains is likely ,the actual overall power may  be higher.
11.3. Subject Information
For all subjects, demographic characteristics ( eg, age, height, weight, body  mass index [BMI], 
race, and gender), and other baseline characteristics ( eg,physical examinati on, medical history , 
and concomitant diseases) will be tabulated and summarized with descriptive statistics.
11.4. Immunogenicity  Analyses
The primary immunogenicity objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiorit y of the 
concomitant administration of Ad26.RSV.pr eF and seasonal influenza vaccine versus the 
administration of seasonal influenza vaccine alone in terms of humoral immune response 
expressed by [CONTACT_667150] 28days 
after the administ ration of influenza vaccine , using a non-inferiority  margin of 2 for the GMT 
ratio (Control group/CoAd group).
Theprimary  immunogenicity  objective will be assessed by [CONTACT_70849] 95% one-sided upper 
confidence limit for the difference in log-transformed HI antibody titers for each of the four 
seasonal influenza vaccine strains between Control and CoAd groups. The confidence limit will 
be calculated using Welch’s t-interval method. The confidence limit will be back -transformed 
(by [CONTACT_151698]) to a GMT ratio and compared to the non -inferiorit y limit of 2.
Only  if the 95% one-sided upper confidence limit for the GMT ratio (Control group/CoAd 
group) of the HI antibody  titers lies below 2 for each of the four vaccine strains, non-inferiority 
of co-administration versus separate administration will be concluded. If one or more confidence 
limits for the GMT ratio exceed 2, non -inferiority  cannot be concluded. 
As a sensitivity  analysis, the primary  endpoint will also be evaluated adjusting for baseline HI 
levels.
The secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints are listed in Section 2.1.
Continuous secondary  and exploratory  variables will be summarized with des criptive statistics of 
the actual values and the changes from baseline where appropriate. Descriptive statistics 
(geometric mean and 95% confidence interval for ELISA , virus neutralization and HI assay s; 
median and quartiles for ELISpot and intracellular c ytokine staining [ICS]) will be calculated for 
continuous immunologic parameters at all timepoints. For the humoral assay s, geometric mean

calculated. For immunogenic ity, baseline is considered as the last assessment pre-vaccination. 
Graphical representations of immunologic parameters will be made as applicable.
No formal non-inferiority  assessments for the secondary  immunological parameters for seasonal 
influenza and RSV will be performed, but upper confidence limits for GMT ratios, as described 
for the primary  endpoint, may be calculated and assessed for relevance by [CONTACT_667151]-inferiorit y limit of 2 as used in the primary analysis.
Similarly , the differenc e in proportions of seroconvert edand seroprotected subjects between 
Control and CoAd groups can be estimated together with the 95% one-sided confidence limit 
(calculated using Wilson ’s score method) and compared to a 10% non -inferiority  limit. Note that 
the study  is only powered for the four primary  comparisons and does not have sufficient power 
to show non -inferiority  of co -administration compared to control for all immunogenicit y markers 
for seasonal influenza and RSV. Consequently , by [CONTACT_667152]-
inferiority  for one or more secondary  endpoints even in the absence of interference between 
seasonal influenza and RSV vaccine administrations.
For categorical variables, frequency  tables will be presented. Difference in proportions and
corresponding confidence intervals may  be calculated where appropriate. 
The primary  immunogenicity  endpoint will be based on the PPII set. The analysis set for the 
secondary  and exploratory  immunogenicity  responses related to influenza will be the PPII set, 
and those related to RSV will be the PPRI . As a sensitivity  analysis, key tables may also be 
based on the FA set. Depending on their occurrence, the effect of natural infections might be 
further explored .

11.7. Data Review Committee
Data Review Committee
Aninternal DRC will be commissioned for this study , comprised of sponsor personnel not 
directly  involved in the conduct of thestudy ,who have expertise in clinical study  conduct and 
vaccines. It will consist of at least one medical expert [INVESTIGATOR_154991].
The DRC will convene if an effect is seen on immune responses to the seasonal influenza 
vaccine with concomitant administration based on the immunogenicity  analysisat 28days after 
the first dose. An independent unblinded statistician and unblinded biomar ker representative will 
present data to the DRC if there is an effect on immune responses to the seasonal influenza 
vaccine when administered concomitantl y with Ad26.RSV.preF . The DRC will decide if subjects 
should be offered repeat influenza immunization.
The DRC will also convene to discuss any significant or unexpected safety  issues. The principal 
investigator (PI)and study  responsible physician (SRP)will inform the DRC of any AE of 
concern.
After safet y review s, the DRC will make recommendations regar ding the continuation of the 
study . The conclusions of the DRC will be communicated to the investigators, the IRB/IEC and 
the national regulatory  authorities as appropriate. Details will be provided in a separate DRC 
charter.
If deemed necessary  for safet yreview, the DRC may request the randomi zation codes and 
review unblinded data, if applicable.
11.8. Study Vaccination Pausing Rules
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_667120]. If study  vaccination is 
considered to raise significant safety concerns, further vaccination of subjects will be suspended 
until DRC review is carried out and subsequent communication between the sponsor and the 
investigator takes place.
The occurrence of any of the following events will lead to suspension of further study 
vaccination, and trigger a meeting of the DRC to discuss study  suspension, adaptation or 
discontinuation of further vaccination :
1.One or more subjects experience an SAE or other potentially  life-threatening (Grade 4) 
event that is determined t o be related to stud y vaccine; OR
2.One or more subjects experience anaph ylaxis clearl y not attributable to other causes than 
vaccination with study  vaccine; OR

determined to be related to study  vaccine, that persists for 72 hours or longer ; OR
5.Death of a subject , regardless of causalit y.
After the first DRC meeting triggered by [CONTACT_172719] a given pausing rule, the DRC will 
convene thereafter for each additional subject meeting that pausing rule.
The DRC will review blinded safet y data first, but is entitle d to and has the right to require 
submission of unblinded data if deemed necessary.
Resumption of vaccinations will start only upon receipt by [CONTACT_667153]. These communications from the DRC will be forwarded by [CONTACT_421905]/IEC and by  [CONTACT_233849] .
To enable prompt response to a situation that would trigger pausing rules 3, [ADDRESS_900662] operating procedures in 
conformity  with regulatory  requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safet y 
information; all clinical studies conducted by [CONTACT_43765].
Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs or SAEs . Open -ended and non-
leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. 
For some studies, subjects are not alway s able to provide valid verbal responses to open -ended 
questions. I n these circumstances, another method of detecting these events is specified .
Solicited Adverse Events
Solicited AEs are pre-defined local (at the Ad26.RSV.preF [or placebo] andseasonal influenza 
vaccine injection sites) and systemic events for which subject s arespecifically  questioned and 
which are noted b y subjects in their diary  (see Section 9.1.1).
Unsolicited Adverse Events
Unsolicited AEs are all AEs for which subject s arespecifically  not questioned in the subject 
diary .

medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related tothat 
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product (Definition per International 
Conference on Harmonisation [I CH]) .
This includes any  occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency  from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory  test 
abnormalities.
Note : The sponsor collects unsolicited AEs starting from ICF signature [INVESTIGATOR_8178] [ADDRESS_900664]-
vaccination (refer to Section 12.3.[ADDRESS_900665] AErecording). SAEs will becollected from 
ICF signature [INVESTIGATOR_44199].RTIs, preferabl y as a diagnosis, will be reported on 
the AE page of the eCRF if they occur between first vaccination and 28 days following the 
second vaccination; any RTI fulfilling the criteria of an SAE would be reported as such during 
the entire stu dy period.
Serious Adverse Event
AnSAE based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use is an y untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening
(The subject was at risk of death atthe time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe)
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapac ity
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agent via a medicinal product
Is Medicall y Important*

These should usually  be considered serious.
If a serious and unexpected AE occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal 
relationship between study  vaccine and the event (eg, death from anaphy laxis), the event must be 
reported as a suspecte d unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) by [CONTACT_667154]/IEC according to regulatory  and local 
requirements.
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information
An AEis considered unlisted if the nature or severit y is not consistent with the applicable 
product reference safet y information. For Ad26.RSV.preF , the expectedness of an AEwill be 
determined b y whether or not it is listed in the Investigator’s Brochure.1
For Fluarix , the expectedness of an AE will be determined by [CONTACT_667155].
Adverse Event Associated With the Use of the Vaccine
An AEis considered associated with the use of study vaccine if the attribution is related by [CONTACT_624700] 12.1.2 .
12.1.2. Attribution Definitions
Every  effort should be made by  [CONTACT_111166], ie,to administration of study  vaccine or to alternati ve causes ( eg,natural history  of 
the underl ying diseases, concomitant therap y). This applies to all AEs, whether serious or non-
serious.
Causality  of AEs should be assessed b y the investigator based on the following:
Related : there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_177872] a relationship between study vaccine and the AE 
(without determining the extent of probability ); there is a reasonable possibility  that study  
vaccine contributed to the AE.
Unrelated : there is no suspi[INVESTIGATOR_177872] a relationship between study  vaccine and the AE; 
there are other more likely  causes and administration of study  vaccine is not suspected to have 
contributed to the AE.
By [CONTACT_108], all solicited AEs at the injection site (local) will be considered related to study  
vaccine administration.
12.1.3. Severity Criteria
All AEs will be coded for severit y using the toxicity  grading table in Attachment 1.For AEs not

16.1. Study -Specific Design Considerations
Potential subjects will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study  and, during the 
study , subjects will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue 
participation. They  will be told that their consent to partici pate in the study  is voluntary  and may  be 
withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalt y or loss of benefits to which they 
would otherwise be entitled. Only subjects who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, and 
potential AEs of the study, and provide their consent voluntaril y will be enrolled.
The total blood volume drawn from each subject will not exceed the US Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS) Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), and FDA 
guidelines of 550 mL in any  eight- week period.29,30
Risks Related to Vaccines
Subjects may exhibit local signs and symptoms associated with vaccina tion, including erythema, 
swelling/induration, and pain/tenderness. These local reactions will be monitored, but are 
generall y short -term and do not require treatment.
Subjects may  exhibit general signs and sy mptoms associated with administration of a vacc ine, or 
vaccination with placebo, including fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills and nausea . 
These side effects will be monitored, but are generally  short -term and do not require treatment.
Subjects may have an allergic reaction to the vaccinatio n. An allergic reaction may cause a rash, 
hives or even difficulty  breathing. Severe reactions, including anaphy laxis, are rare but can occur

Risks Related to Adenoviral -vectored Vaccines
Safety  data available from 10 completed clinical studies in adults with other Ad26 -vectored 
vaccine candidates, in which Ad26 with different inserts has been evaluated at dose levels 
ranging from 1×109vp to 1×1011vp, indicate that no safety  concerns would be anticipated from 
vaccination with Ad26.RSV.preF at doses up to and including 1×1011vp.
Local AEs (moderate injection site pain and tenderness, and moderate to severe redness at the 
injection site) and systemic AEs (headache, chills, joint pain, muscle pain, tiredness/generall y 
not feeling well/fatigue and fever) have been reported after vaccination with Ad26 -vectored 
vaccines. In a few subjects, transient laboratory  abnormalities have been seen, including change s 
in neutrophils. Laboratory changes including decreased hemoglobin, decreased platelets, and 
moderate elevations in liver transaminases were observed that were not associated with any 
clinical findings and appear to be transient based on no reported persi stent abnormalities in any 
of the subjects.
For further details on thesafet y profiles of other Ad26 -vectored vaccine candidates, see the 
Ad26.RSV.preF Investigator’s Brochure.[ADDRESS_900677] common ( ≥10%) local AE after Fluarix Quadrivalent administration was pain 
(36%); the most common systemic AEs were muscle aches (16%), headache (16%), and fatigue 
(16%).
Syncope can occur in association with administration of Fluarix Quadrivalent. In the event of 
syncope, procedures should be in place to avoid falling injury  and to restore cerebral perfusion.
For further details, see the Fluarix Package Insert.
Risks from Blood Draws
Blood drawing may cause pain/ tenderness, bruising, bleeding, lightheadedness, dizziness, 
vasovagal response, and, rarel y, infection at the site where the blood is taken .
Potential Benefits
There is no direct medical benefit to the subject for participation in this clinical study . Although 
study  subjects may benefit from clinical testing and physical examination, they may receive no 
direct benefit from participation. Others may benefit from knowledge gained in this study  that 
may aid in the development of an RSV vaccine.

applicable.
The author of an entry  in the source documents should be identifiable.
Specific details required as source data for the study  and source data collection methods will be 
reviewed with the investigator before the study  and will be described in the monitoring 
guidelines (or other equivalent document).
The subject diary  used to collect information regarding solicited events after vaccination will be 
considered source data . At Visits 3and 5, information from the subject diary  will be reviewed by  
[CONTACT_093]; diary  information will be transcribed by [CONTACT_667159].
An eSource system may be utilized, which contains data traditionally  maintained in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_90761] (eg, electronic source documents) as well as the clinical 
study -specific data fields as determined by [CONTACT_760]. This data is electronically extracted for 
use by [CONTACT_456]. If eSource is utilized, references made to the eCRF in the protocol include 
the eSource system but information collected through eSource may not be limited to that found 
in the eCRF .
17.5. Case Report Form Co mpletion
Case report forms are prepared and provided by  [CONTACT_66888].
All eCRF entries, corrections, and alterations must be made by [CONTACT_170191] -site personnel. The investigator must verify  thatall data entries in the eCRF are accurate

eCRF in English. The eCRF must be completed as soon as possible after a subject visit and the 
forms should be available for review at the next scheduled monitoring visit.
If necessary , queries will be generated in the eDC tool. If corrections to aneCRF are needed 
after the initial entry  into the eCRF , this can be done in either of t he following ways:
Investigator and study-site personnel can make corrections in the eDC tool at their own 
initiative or as a response to an auto query  (generated by  [CONTACT_66832]) .
Sponsor or sponsor delegate can generate a query  for resolution by [CONTACT_23858] -site personnel.
17.6. Data Quality  Assurance/Quality  Control
Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy  and reliability  of data include the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate study  sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and 
study -sitepersonnel before the study ,and periodic monitoring visits by [CONTACT_456]. Written 
instructions will be provided for collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples.
Guidelines for eCRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study -sitepersonnel before 
the start of the study .The sponsor will review eCRF for accuracy  and completeness during on-
site monitoring visits and after transmission to the sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved 
with the investigator or de signee, as appropriate. After upload of the data into the study database 
they will be verified for accuracy  and consistency  with the data sources.
17.7. Record Retention
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all eCRF
and all source documents that support the data collected from each subject, as well as all study  
documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a 
Clinical Trial, and all study  documents as specified by [CONTACT_23859](s). 
The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents.
Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or until at least 2years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be 
retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_43785]. It is the responsibility  of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.

documents before having obtained written approval from the sponsor .
If it becomes necessary  for the sponsor or the appropriate regulat ory authority  to review any 
documentation relating to this study , the investigator /institution must permit access to such 
reports.
17.8. Monitoring
The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequentl y as necessary . The monitor will 
record dates of th e visits in a study -site visit log that will be kept at the study  site. The first post -
initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the 
monitor will compar e the data entered into the eCRF with the source documents
(eg,hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic/phy sician ’s office medical records) . The nature and location of all source 
documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data required to complete the 
eCRF are known to the sponsor and study -site personnel and are accessible for verification by 
[CONTACT_43786] -site contact. If electronic records are maintained at the study site, the method 
of verification must be discussed with the study -site personnel .
Direct access to source document s(medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of 
verify ing that the recorded data are consistent with the original source data. Findings from this 
review will be discussed with the study -site personnel . The sponsor expects that, during 
monitoring visits, the relevant study-site personnel will be available, the source document swill 
be accessible, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related 
documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to 
provide fee dback on the study conduct.
17.9. Study Completion/Termination
17.9.1. Study Completion /End of Study
The end of the study  will be the last subject’s last visit 6after the second vaccination . The study  
is considered completed with the last visit for the last subject participating in the study . The final 
data from the study site will be sent to the sponsor (or designee) after completion of the final 
subject visit at that study  site, in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement.
17.9.2. Stud y Termination
The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study  at any time for any 
reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor .Study sites will be closed upon study  completion. A
study site is considered closed when all requi red documents and study  supplies have been 
collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.

Approved , Date: 6 December 2017The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.
Reasons for the earlyclosure of astudy site by [CONTACT_11004]:
Failure of the investigator to comply  with the protocol, the requirements of the IEC/IRB or 
local health authorities, the sponsor ’s procedures, or GCP guidelines
Inadequate recruitment of subjects by  [CONTACT_093]
Discontinuation of further study  vaccine development
17.10. On-Site A udits
Representatives of the sponsor ’s clinical quality  assurance department may visit the study  site at 
any time during or after completion of the study  to conduct an audit of the study  in compliance 
with regulatory  guidelines and company  policy . These audits will require access to all study 
records, including source documents, for inspection. Subjec t privacy  must, however, be 
respected. The investigator and study -site personnel are responsible for being present and 
available forconsultation during routinely  scheduled study -site audit visits conducted by [CONTACT_170192].
Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by [CONTACT_23865], either as 
part of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study  in support of a 
regulatory  submission. The investigator should immediately  notify  the sponsor if he or shehas
been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y a regulatory agency  concerning an upcoming inspection.
17.11. Use of Information and Publication
All information, including but not limited to information regarding Ad26.RSV.preF or the 
sponsor ’s operations (eg,patent application, formulas, manufacturing processes, basic scientific 
data, prior clinical data, formulation information) supplied by [CONTACT_66894], and any data generated as a result of this study , areconsidered 
confidential and remain the sole property  of the sponsor. The investigator agrees to maintain this 
information in confidence and use this information only to accomplish this study , and will not 
use it for other purposes without the sponsor ’s prior written consent.
The investigator understands that the information developed in the study will be used by [CONTACT_111181]26.RSV.preF , and thus may be 
disclosed as required to other clinical investigators orregulatory  agencies. To permit the 
information derived from the clinical studies to be used, the investigator is obligated to provide 
the sponsor with all data obtained in the study .
The results of the study  will be reported in a Clinical Study  Report generated by [CONTACT_624708]-protocol . Recruitment

publi cation of results. Any work created in connection with performance of the study  and 
contained in the data that can benefit from copyright protection (except any publication by [CONTACT_23868]) shall be the propert y of the sponsor as author and owner of 
copy right in such work.
Consistent with Good Publication Practices and International Committee of Medical Journal 
Editors guidelines, t he sponsor shall have the right to publish such primary  (multi- center ) data 
and information without approval from the investigator. The investigator has the right to publish 
study  site-specific data after the primary  data are published. If an investigator wishes to publish 
information from the study ,a copy  of the manuscript must be provided to the sponsor for review 
at least 60days before submission for publication or presentation. Expedited reviews will be 
arranged for abstracts, poster presentations, or other materials. If requested by [CONTACT_170196], the investigator will withhold such publica tion for up to an additional 60days to allow 
for filing of a patent application. In the event that issues arise regarding scientific integrity  or 
regulatory  compliance, the sponsor will review these issues with the investigator. The sponsor 
will not manda te modifications to scientific content and does not have the right to suppress 
information. For multi- center study  designs and substudy  approaches, secondary  results 
generall y should not be published before the primary  endpoints of a study  have been published. 
Similarly , investigators will recognize the integrity  of a multi- center study by [CONTACT_307513], within 12months of the availabilit y of the 
final data (tables, listings, graphs), or the sponsor confirms there will be no multi- center study  
publication. Authorship of publications resulting from this study  will be based on the guidelines 
on authorship, such as those described in the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted 
to Biomedical Journals, which state that the named authors must have made a significant 
contribution to the design of the study  or analy sis and interpretation of the data, provided critical 
review of the paper, and given final approval of the final version.
Registration of Clinical Studies and Disclosure of Results
The sponsor will register and disclose the existence of and the results of clinical studies as 
required b y law.

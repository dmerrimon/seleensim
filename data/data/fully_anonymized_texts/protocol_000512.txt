effective for inducing and maintaining 
glucocorticoid- free remission in male or 
female patients aged 18 to 75 with biopsy proven, active, glucocorticoid-dependent 
sarcoidosis  
SECONDARY OBJECTIVE (S) To determine the number of patients in 
glucocorticoid- free remission and the change 
in prednisone dose compared to baseline at Week 16, after the open- label period (Period 
1) of the study.  Additional secondary objectives at both Week 16 and Week 28 are to demonstrate that sarilumab treatment is effective for reducing disease manifestation -
specific metrics, for improving laboratory parameters, and f or reducing cumulative 
prednisone dose.  An important secondary 
objective is to demonstrate safety in this 
patient population.  
TREATMENT SUMMARY  During Period 1 of this study, fifteen 
patients will receive sarilumab 200mg subcutaneously every two weeks in an open-
label fashion.  Subjects will continue their background disease modifying anti -
rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_791127] (prednisone ≥ 10 mg and ≤ 60 mg daily or alternate glucocorticoid equivalent is required for study entry).  During the screening period, 
all patients will change their glucocorticoid to prednisone with stable dosing for at least 14 days before their baseline visit.  If a patient is on a prednisone dose between 40 
mg daily and 60 mg daily, the dose w ill be 
 
Protocol Version 3  5  19May2020  reduced to 40 mg daily by [CONTACT_199487] 3 
at the clinician’s discretion.  Starting at week 
4, all patients will begin a scheduled prednisone taper that will take place from week 4 until week 16.   
 Patients will be required to adhere to this taper ing protocol.  If a violation in the 
tapering schedule occurs, the patient will be deemed a nonresponder.  Patients will be required to fill out a daily steroid diary to clearly document their daily prednisone intake . All attempts will be made to perform 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_791128] . 
 
During Period 2 of the study (starting at Week 16), the patients that responded in Period 1 will be randomized to withdraw from sarilumab.  Patients will be assigned in a blinded, 1:1 fashion to receive either sarilumab 200mg subcutaneously every two 
weeks or matching placebo.   
SAMPLE SIZE  15 patients  
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  The sample size for Period 1 of the trial of 
15 patients was calculated based on the 
assumption that 80% of the patients will 
respond to open- label sarilumab, allowing 
for [ADDRESS_1090559] e size of 12 for Period 2 was 
calculated based on the assumption that 85% of the placebo group (roughly 5 out of 6) will flare (i.e.,  require reinitiation of 
prednisone) over the subsequent 12 weeks compared to 15% (roughly 1 out of 6) in the sarilumab gro up.  This relative hazard of 
0.20 gives a power of 80% with an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_1090560]

Protocol Version 3  10  19May2020  1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1. Primary Objective   
The primary objective of this study is to determine if sarilumab treatment is effective for inducing 
and maintaining glucocorticoid- free remission in male or female patients aged 18 to 75 with biopsy 
proven, active, glucocorticoid- dependent sarcoidosis aff ecting  any organ other than the heart or the 
central nervous system.    
 
1.2. Secondary Objectives   
Secondary objectives of this study are to determine the number of patients in glucocorticoid -free 
remission and the change in prednisone dose compared to baseline at Week 16, after the open- label 
period (Period 1) of the study.  Additional secondary objectives at both Week 16 and Week 28 are to demonstrate that sarilumab treatment is effective for reducing disease manifestation -specific 
metrics, for improving laboratory parameters, and for reducing cumulative prednisone dose.  An important secondary objective is to demonstrate safety in this patient population.  
 2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Sarcoidosis Sarcoidosis is a rare  disease, but one that  carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality  with a 5 and 
10-year mortality rate of 4 and 9% [1] .  The prevalence is estimated at 10 -20 per 100,000 of the 
general population, with roughly 50,000 people affected in the [LOCATION_002] [2] .  The incidence 
varies by [CONTACT_791131]; the disease is roughly four times more common in blacks.  Sarcoidosis typi[INVESTIGATOR_791129] 20 and 60 and a higher mortality exists in patients older than 55, non- Hispanic African Americans, and women [1].  The lungs are affected in 
the vast majority of patients (~90%), leading to fatigue, dyspnea, and often pulmonary fibrosis which can result in death.  When the liver is affected, it can cause hepatic failure requiring transplantation.  Ocular inflammation can permanently damage the eye, skin rashes are disfiguring, enlarged lymph nodes and glands can be painful, and inflammatory arthritis can be debilitating.   Sarcoidosis is often  chronic, requiring long-term immunosuppression.  There are no established 
guidelines for the treatment of sarcoidosis, but the mainstay therapy is glucocorticoids.  It is well 
established that prolonged use of glucocorticoids has a number of harmful effects, including glucose intolerance, osteoporosis, weight gain, hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], infection, insomnia, cataracts, gastrointestinal perforation, and mood changes [3 -5].  Thus, it is essential for patients 
who do not respond to glucocorticoids to be treated with additional agents in hopes of minimizing exposure to steroids.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], a disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD), such as methotrexate or azathioprine, is added to prednisone.  When this fails, and for severe manifestations, more potent drugs are used such as cyclophosphamide or a biologic drug such as a TNF -inhibitor.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_353750], many patients have ongoing sarcoidosis symptoms and 
organ injury.   
2.2 Sarilumab  
Sarilumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) kappa 
isotype directed against the interleukin -6 receptor α -subunit (IL- 6Rα). Sarilumab binds to human 
 
Protocol Version 3  11  19May2020  IL-6Rα and has been demonstrated to block interleukin -6 (IL -6) mediated signaling. Sarilumab, 
formulated for subcutaneous (SC) injection at doses of 150 and 200 mg every 2 weeks (q2w), was 
approved for the treatment of RA in Canada on 12 January 2017, the [LOCATION_002] (US) on 22 May 2017, European Union (EU), Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein on 23 June 2017, and Japan on 27 Septembe r 2017. Sarilumab is also in Phase 2 development for the treatment of polyarticular -course 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA) in pediatric patients.  
 As of 12 January 2018, the global sarilumab RA clinical development program consisted of 10 Phase 1clin ical pharmacology studies and 9 Phase 2/3 studies. 
 Phase 1 studies:  
Of the 10 Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies, 8 studies were conducted in patients with RA receiving methotrexate (MTX) and 1  study was conducted in healthy subjects. All but 
2 of these studies (TDR10805/6R88- RA-0802 and INT12684) were single dose studies. 
 Phase 2/3 studies in RA:  Of the [ADDRESS_1090563] been completed (EFC11072/ SARIL -RA-MOBILITY, EFC10832/SARIL- RA-TARGET,  
SFY13370/SARIL- RA-ASCERTAIN, EFC13752/ SARIL -RA-ONE, MSC12665/SARIL- RA-
EASY); 2 were prematurely terminated (ACT11575 and EFC11574/SARIL- RA-COMPARE) due 
to the operational feasibility and lack of ability to prov ide a timely result versus the plan but not due 
to any safety issue; and 2 studies are ongoing: the open-label extension part of EFC14092/SARIL-RA-MONARCH (double -blind part of this study has been completed) and the uncontrolled 
extension Phase 3 study LTS11210 (SARIL- RA-EXTEND) that enrolled patients from studies 
EFC11072, EFC10832, EFC13752, SFY13370, and ACT11575.  
 The global RA program has enrolled patients with RA from over 40 countries worldwide, who required alternatives to oral disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF -α) antagonists because of inadequate control of disease activity or intolerance to 
these agents. This program entered Phase 2/3 with an operationally seamless study, EFC11072, consisting of a combined dose-ranging (Phase 2) part and a confirmatory (Phase 3) part, which was conducted in patients with active RA who were inadequate responders to MTX therapy.  In the dose-ranging part of the study (EFC11072/Part A), 5 dose regimens (100 mg q2w, 150 mg q2w, 200 mg q2w, 100 mg every week [qw], and 150 mg qw) and placebo were tested in 306 randomized patients. The demographic and disease characteristics at baseline were similar  
across all treatment groups.  
 Based on an in- depth analysis of the Phase 2 study results, the 150 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w 
doses were selected for evaluation in 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 trials in RA (EFC11072 Part B and EFC10832) where sarilumab was tested as a combination therapy with a conventional DMARD.  In the Phase 3 confirmatory part of EFC11072 (Part B), both sarilumab dose groups showed clinically relevant and statistically significant (p<0.0001) improvements compared with placebo in all 3 co-primary endpoints: improvement in signs and symptoms of RA at 24 weeks (as defined by 20% improvement on American College of Rheumatology [ACR] definition of improvement 
 
Protocol Version 3  12  19May2020  criteria [ACR20]), improvement in physical function (as assessed by [CONTACT_791132] [HAQ-DI]) at Week 16 and inhibition of progression of structural 
damage at Week 52. Study EFC11072 Part B, Cohort 2 (where patients were randomized to either 
placebo or one of 2 selected doses: 150 mg q2w or 200 mg q2w) demonstrated that sarilumab 200 mg q2w and 150 mg q2w inhibited the 1- year rate of radiographic progression by 91% and 68% 
relative to placebo, respectively.  In addition to study EFC11072, efficacy of sarilumab was demonstrated in study EFC10832, conducted in patients who had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF- α 
antagonists. For the primary endpoints of ACR20 at Week 24 and HAQ- DI at Week 12,  significant 
improvement was observed in patients treated with sarilumab 200 mg q2w and 150 mg q2w compared with placebo, showing that patients who previously had an inadequate response or intolerance to TNF- α antagonists responded to treatment with sarilumab.   
 Although demonstration of efficacy was not the primary objective for the other Phase 3 clinical trials in RA where sarilumab was administered either as monotherapy (EFC13752,  EFC14092) or 
with concomitant DMARD therapy (SFY13370 and MSC12665), clinical efficacy profiles in these studies were consistent with results from the active -controlled Phase 3 studies in the global program 
(EFC11072 Part B, and EFC10832).   Patients who completed studies EFC11072, EFC10832, EFC13752, and SFY13370 had the option to enroll in the ongoing long-term extension study LTS11210 at the highest tested dose (200 mg q2w). In this study, the efficacy of sarilumab administered concomitantly with DMARDs  was 
sustained for the duration of the available follow -up period: approximately 3.8 years and 2.1 years 
for patients initially randomized in EFC11072 Part B and EFC10832, respectively. The persistence 
of efficacy was consistent across all the domains of treatment of RA, namely signs and symptoms, 
structural damage, and physical function.  Safety: For the patients treated with sarilumab and concomitant DMARD, a higher incidence of treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and TEAEs leading  
to discontinuation were observed in the sarilumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group. The incidence of TEAEs leading to death was similar in sarilumab and placebo groups.  In the placebo-controlled population, compared to the placebo group, higher incidences of TEAEs, SAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation were observed in sarilumab 200 mg q2w or 150 mg q2w + DMARD treatment groups relative to the placebo + DMARD group. These differences were generally attributable  to higher rates of the AESIs associated with IL -6 
blockade, specifically infections and laboratory abnormalities (including decrease in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count, increase in transaminase and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]) in the sarilumab + DMARD groups.  
 The observations with regards to adverse event (AE) and laboratory parameters with long -term 
administration were  consistent with what was observed in the placebo -controlled population, and 
no safety findings were identified as attributable to long- term administration.  
 
 
Protocol Version 3  13  19May2020  Other diseases:  
Sarilumab was studied in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients in the DRI11073 study. Patients  
who completed the DRI11073 study had the possibility of enrolling in the LTS11298 long- term 
safety study if appropriate. The DRI11073 study failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy and the 
clinical development in this indication has been terminated. Consequently the LTS11298 study was prematurely discontinued. Overall, the safety observations from these studies conducted in  
patients with AS were consistent with has been observed in patients with RA.  
 Sarilumab was also evaluated in a randomized d ouble-blind Phase 2 study of patients with 
noninfectious uveitis (NIU) (ACT13480/SARIL- NIU-SATURN). Although the primary efficacy 
endpoint of a 2 step reduction in vitreous haze (VH) or reduction in steroid dose was not met, significant improvements were o bserved for key secondary endpoints such as change from 
baseline in adjudicated VH at Week 16, change from baseline in best- corrected visual acuity  
(BCVA) at Week 16, and change from baseline central retinal thickness (CRT) at Week 16. Furthermore, changes in adjudicated VH, BCVA, and CRT were maintained at Week 52. No new safety signals have been detected with sarilumab use in NIU compared with other indications. The AEs and laboratory changes were consistent with results observed in studies with sarilumab  in RA 
patients and with IL -6 inhibition.  
 The FDA has approved sarilumab  for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.  It is not FDA approved 
for the treatment of sarcoidosis, however this clinical investigation is exempt from an IND as it meets the following requirements:  
- Sarliumab is lawfully marketed in the [LOCATION_002]  
- The investigation is not intended to be reported to the FDA as a well-controlled study in 
support of a new indication and there is no intent to use it to support any other significant 
change in the labeling of the drug 
- The investigation is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the 
drug 
- The investigation does not involve a route of administration, dose, patient population, or 
other factor that significan tly increases the risk associated with the drug  
- The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements for review by [CONTACT_791133] 
- The investigation is not intended to promote or commercialize the drug 
 
2.3 Rationale 
Sarcoidosis is a chronic illness , requiring long-term immunosuppression.  There are no established 
guidelines for the treatment of sarcoidosis, but the mainstay therapy is glucocorticoids.  It is well 
established that prolonged use of glucocorticoids has a number of harmful effects, including glucose intolerance, osteoporosis, weight gain, hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], infection, insomnia, cataracts, gastrointestinal perforation, and mood cha nges [3 -5].  Thus, it is essential for patients 
who do not respond to glucocorticoids to be treated with additional agents in hopes of minimizing exposure to steroids.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], a disease modifying anti- rheum atic drug (DMARD), such as 
methotrexate or azathioprine, is added to prednisone.  When this fails, and for severe manifestations, more potent drugs are used such as cyclophosphamide or a biologic drug such as a TNF -inhibitor.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_353750], many  patients have ongoing sarcoidosis symptoms and 
organ injury.  
 
Protocol Version 3  14  19May2020   
Interleukin -6 (IL -6) is elevated in the blood and bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid of patients with 
sarcoidosis [6, 7].  This inflammatory cytokine leads to B cell differentiation into antibody-
secreting cells.  Patients with sarcoidosis have elev ated blood levels of immunoglobulins, consistent 
with B cell hyperactivation [7] .  In addition, thes e activated B cells can serve as highly affinity -
matured antigen presenting cells for T cells.  IL -6 also stimulates T cells directly and specifically 
induces Th17 T cell development.  Th17 cells are elevated in sarcoidosis and likely contribute to 
disease pathogenesis through secretion of IL- 17 and interferon- gamma (IFN -γ) [8-10].  IL-6 
additionally inhibits Treg differentiation, thereby [CONTACT_791134] T cell response [11]. 
 Sarilumab binds the IL -6 receptor and prevents its activity.  It has been studied extensively in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and has been shown to improve disease activity, radiographic findings, and markers of inflammation [12-15].  Given sarilumab’s efficacy and favorable safety profile, it is 
now FDA- approved for the treatment of RA.  Sarilumab has never been tested in sarcoidosis 
patients, and we believe it will have similar efficacy when given to this patient population.   There 
are limited options in the management of sarcoidosis, and determining whether novel approaches such as sarilumab are useful for improving patients’ quality of life and for decreasing morbidity and mortality is critical.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1090564] 
period of this trial, Period 1, is single -arm and open- label, in which all patients will receive 
sarilumab.  The second period, Period 2, is a two- arm, randomized withdrawal study in which half 
of the patients will receive sarilu mab and half will receive matching placebo.  Period 2 will be 
double blind.  The primary outcome of the study is designed to evaluate efficacy of sarilumab in the treatment of sarcoidosis.  
 
2.5 Correlative Studies Background  
A plasma sample (5 ml) will be collected for future biomarker analysis at Baseline, Week 16, and 
Week 28.  This will be used to study cytokines including IL-6 levels.  Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells will also be collected at Baseline, Week 16, and Week 28.  These will be used to characterize the immune response before and after treatment.

At Screening, vital signs will be obtained, a physical examination performed, and complete medical 
history obtained.  Routine clinical laboratory tests  (including a chemistry panel, complete blood 
count, urinalysis, spot urine protein and creatinine, C- reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR), urine pregnancy test), sarcoidosis- related laboratory tests  (including 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), total immunoglobulins (IgG), urine calcium, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, and safety laboratory tests  (including serum pregnancy test for females, HIV test, 
hepatitis B test, hepatitis C test, and quantiferon test for tuberculosis) will be performed.  An electrocardiogram and chest x- ray will also be obtained.  At Baseline and Week 16, routine clinical 
laboratory tests and sarcoidosis -related laboratory tests will be repeated, and in addition the 
following tests will be performed at Baseline (and only repeated at Week 16 if abnormal at 
Baseline): pulmonary function tests, chest computed tomography, creatinine kinase (CK), aldolase , 
and lactose dehydrogenase (LDH).  At Week 28, routine clinical laboratory tests and sarcoidosis-related laboratory tests will be repeated.  At visits [ADDRESS_1090569], global patient VAS, global physician VAS, HAQ, and FACIT -F will be assessed.  Also at Baseline, Week 16, and Week 28, eight green 
 
Protocol Version 3  17  19May2020  top tubes will be collected and processed for plasma  and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which 
will be stored at -80°C for future research. 
 
During Period 1 (Baseline through Week 16), all subjects will receive 200mg of sarilumab 
subcutaneously every two weeks.  During Period 2 (Week 16 through Week 28), half of the subjects who responded in Period 1 will receive 200mg of sarilumab subcutaneously every two weeks and half of the subjects will receive matching placebo in a double-blinded fashion. 
 
4.1 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
Patients will be allowed to continue background DMARDs including methotrexate, leflunomide, 
azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and/or anti- malarials.  These are standard drugs used in the 
treatment of sarcoidosis.  The regimen must be stable for ≥ 28 days prior to baseline and remain stable during follow- up.  Patients will also be on ≥ 10 mg and ≤ [ADDRESS_1090570] pain and/or bruising at the place  on his/her arm where blood is taken.  Blood clots may form and infections may 
occur, but these events are rare. He or she may feel faint or lightheaded.   They will also have an 
electrocardiogram.  There may be minor discomfort and/or skin irritation at th e site where the 
electrodes (sticky pads) are placed on the skin for the recording of the ECG.  They will also have a chest x -ray.  Radiation exposure from a chest x-ray is equivalent to the amount of radiation 
exposure one would experience from 10 days of natural radiation (such as sunlight).  They will also 
have a non-contrast chest computed tomography.  Radiation exposure from a computed tomography of the chest is equivalent to roughly [ADDRESS_1090571] common side effects of this dye are nausea and vomiting; however, occasional allergic reactions, fainting, breathing difficulties, or shock may occur. The dye may stain your skin and urine; which may last approximately for [ADDRESS_1090572], which will meet every 6 months.    
5. INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT/DEVICE/PROCEDURE INFORMATION  
 5.1  Sarilumab  
Sarilumab (SAR153191), also designated as REGN88, is co-developed by [CONTACT_791139]. 
Sarilumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody of the IgG kappa isotype directed against the alpha subunit of the IL- 6 receptor (IL -6Rα). Sarilumab i s a potent and specific inhibitor of IL -6 
mediated signaling. By [CONTACT_791140]- 6Rα with high affinity, sarilumab blocks the binding of IL -6 
and interrupts the cytokine- mediated signaling cascade. Interleukin -6 is a key element in the 
etiology of rheumatic conditions and inhibition of its signaling is a critical part of the mechanism of action of sarilumab.  
 For complete information on mechanism of action, summaries of animal and clinical studies, non -
clinical and clinical pharmacokinetics, major route of el imination, safety profile, please see the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
5.1.1  Summary of nonclinical studies  
Sarilumab has been evaluated in a series of in vitro experiments to quantify the affinity of the  
antibody for IL -6Rα and the ability to block the binding and signaling of IL -6. In addition, the 
role of the Fc effector function in the mechanism of action of the antibody was evaluated in vitro. 
The equilibrium binding affinity (KD) of sarilumab to human IL -6Rα was determined by [CONTACT_791141] ( SPR) Biacore to be approximately [ADDRESS_1090573], no binding of sarilumab to murine IL- 6Rα was observed, suggesting that rodents are not a 
useful model system for pharmacology or toxicology studies.  In vitro, sarilumab completely blocked the binding of a 200 nM concentration of human IL- 6 to human IL -6Rα, as demonstrated 
by [CONTACT_145129] -Biacore; in a competition enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay, sarilumab blocked binding 
of a [ADDRESS_1090574] rate that sarilumab blocks IL -6-dependent signal transducer 
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation in the HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cell line, and blocks trans -signaling induced by a combination of IL-6 and soluble IL- 6Rα in an engineered 
human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cell line that overexpresses gp130 but does not express IL-6Rα. No detectable Fc effector function activity was associated with sarilumab, as determined in 
vitro in cell- based assays for antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity and complement-
 
Protocol Version 3  19  19May2020  dependent cytotoxicity. In total, these in vitro data are consistent with sarilumab exerting its actions 
through blockade of the IL- 6/IL-6Rα interaction.  
 Sarilumab does not bind to mouse IL- 6R; therefore, the surrogate REGN844 a ntibody (an IL-6R 
antibody that cross reacts with mouse receptor) was used for the murine model experiments. In  
vitro, REGN844 binds specifically to mouse IL- 6Rα with high affinity and inhibits IL -6 stimulated 
mouse B-cell proliferation. A study with sarilumab was performed in double- humanized (IL -6hu/hu 
IL-6Rαhu/hu) mice expressing human IL -6 and the human ectodoma in of IL -6Rα instead of the 
equivalent mouse gene products. In double -humanized IL -6/IL-6Rα mice, sarilumab prevents 
turpentine -induced elevation of serum amyloid A (SAA), a key biomarker of the acute phase 
inflammatory response. For studies in wild type mice, REGN844 was tested. In concordance with the PD activity of sarilumab in double -humanized mice, REGN844 prevents turpentine-induced 
elevation of SAA and mitigated disease incidence, severity and bone erosion in a collagen induced arthritis model.  
 
5.1.2  Summary of clinical studies  
 
As of 12 January 2018, the global sarilumab RA clinical development program consisted of 10 Phase 1clinical pharmacology studies and 9 Phase 2/3 studies.  Phase 1 studies:  
Of the 10 Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies, 8 studies were conducted in patients with RA receiving methotrexate (MTX) and 1 study was conducted in healthy subjects. All but 2 of these studies (TDR10805/6R88- RA-0802 and INT12684) were single dose studies. 
 Phase 2/3 studies in RA:  Of the [ADDRESS_1090575] been completed (EFC11072/SARIL- RA-MOBILITY, EFC10832/SARIL- RA-TARGET,  
SFY13370/SARIL- RA-ASCERTAIN, EFC13752/ SARIL -RA-ONE, MSC12665/SARIL- RA-
EASY); 2 were pre maturely terminated (ACT11575 and EFC11574/SARIL- RA-COMPARE) due 
to the operational feasibility and lack of ability to provide a timely result versus the plan but not due to any safety issue; and 2 studies are ongoing: the open- label extension part of EFC1 4092/SARIL-
RA-MONARCH (double -blind part of this study has been completed) and the uncontrolled 
extension Phase 3 study LTS11210 (SARIL- RA-EXTEND) that enrolled patients from studies 
EFC11072, EFC10832, EFC13752, SFY13370, and ACT11575.  
 The global RA program has enrolled patients with RA from over 40 countries worldwide, who required alternatives to oral disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF -α) antagonists because of inadequate control of disease activity or i ntolerance to 
these agents. This program entered Phase 2/3 with an operationally seamless study, EFC11072, consisting of a combined dose-ranging (Phase 2) part and a confirmatory (Phase 3) part, which was conducted in patients with active RA who were inade quate responders to MTX therapy. 
 In the dose-ranging part of the study (EFC11072/Part A), 5 dose regimens (100 mg q2w, 150 mg q2w, 200 mg q2w, 100 mg every week [qw], and 150 mg qw) and placebo were tested in 306 randomized patients. The demographic and d isease characteristics at baseline were similar  
 
Protocol Version 3  20  19May2020  across all treatment groups.  
 
Based on an in-depth analysis of the Phase 2 study results, the 150 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w doses were selected for evaluation in 2  pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 trials in RA (EFC11072 Part B and 
EFC10832) where sarilumab was tested as a combination therapy with a conventional DMARD.  In the Phase 3 confirmatory part of EFC11072 (Part B), both sarilumab dose groups showed clinically relevant and st atistically significant (p<0.0001) improvements compared with placebo  
in all 3 co-primary endpoints: improvement in signs and symptoms of RA at 24 weeks (as defined by 20% improvement on American College of Rheumatology [ACR] definition of improvement criteria [ACR20]), improvement in physical function (as assessed by [CONTACT_791142] [HAQ-DI]) at Week 16 and inhibition of progression of structural damage at Week 52. Study EFC11072 Part B, Cohort 2 (where patients were randomized to either placebo or one of 2 selected doses: 150 mg q2w or 200 mg q2w) demonstrated that sarilumab 200 mg q2w and 150 mg q2w inhibited the 1-year rate of radiographic progression by 91% and 68% relative to placebo, respectively.  In addition to study EFC11072, efficacy of sarilumab was demonstrated in study EFC10832, conducted in patients who had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF- α 
antagonists. For the primary endpoints of ACR20 at Week 24 and HAQ- DI at Week 12, significant 
improvement was observed in patients treated with sarilumab 200 mg q2w and 150 mg q2w compared with placebo, showing that patients who previously had an inadequate response or intolerance to TNF- α antagonists responded to treatment with sarilumab.  
 Although demonstration of efficacy was not the primary objective for the other Phase 3 clinical 
trials in RA where sarilumab was administered either as monotherapy (EFC13752, EFC14092) or 
with concomitant DMARD therapy (SFY13370 and MSC12665), clinical efficacy prof iles in these 
studies were consistent with results from the active -controlled Phase 3 studies in the global program 
(EFC11072 Part B, and EFC10832).   Patients who completed studies EFC11072, EFC10832, EFC13752, and SFY13370 had the option to enroll in the  ongoing long-term extension study LTS11210 at the highest tested dose (200 mg 
q2w). In this study, the efficacy of sarilumab administered concomitantly with DMARDs was sustained for the duration of the available follow -up period: approximately 3.8 years and 2.1 years 
for patients initially randomized in EFC11072 Part B and EFC10832, respectively. The persistence of efficacy was consistent across all the domains of treatment of RA, namely signs and symptoms, structural damage, and physical function.  Safety: For the patients treated with sarilumab and concomitant DMARD, a higher incidence of treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and TEAEs leading  
to discontinuation were observed in the sarilumab treatment groups compared t o the placebo  
group. The incidence of TEAEs leading to death was similar in sarilumab and placebo groups.  In the placebo-controlled population, compared to the placebo group, higher incidences of 
 
Protocol Version 3  21  19May2020  TEAEs, SAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation were observed in sarilumab 200 mg q2w or 
150 mg q2w + DMARD treatment groups relative to the placebo + DMARD group. These differences were generally attributable to higher rates of the AESIs associated with IL -6 
blockade, specifically infections and laboratory abnormalities (including decrease in absolute  
neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count, increase in transaminase and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]) in the sarilumab + DMARD groups.  The observations with regards to adverse event (AE) and laboratory parameters with long -term 
administration were consistent with what was observed in the placebo -controlled population, and 
no safety findings were identified as attributable to long- term administration.  
 Other diseases:  
Sarilumab was studied in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients in the DRI11073 study. Patients who completed the DRI11073 study had the possibility of enrolling in the LTS11298 long- term 
safety study if appropriate. The DRI11073 study failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy and the clinical development in this indication has been terminated. Consequently the LTS11298 study was prematurely discontinued. Overall, the safety observations from these studies conducted in  
patients with AS were consistent with has been observed in patients with RA.  
 Sarilumab was also evaluated in a randomized double-blind Phase 2 study of patients with noninfectious uveitis (NIU) (ACT13480/SARIL- NIU-SATURN). Although the primary efficacy 
endpoint of a 2 step reduction in vitreous haze (VH) or reduction in steroid dose was not met, significant improvements were observed for key secondary endpoints such as change from baseline in adjudicated VH at Week 16, change from baseline in best- corrected visual acuity  
(BCVA) at Week 16, and change from baseline central retinal thickness (CRT) at Week 16. 
Furthermore, changes in adjudicated VH, BCVA, and CRT were maintained at Week 52. No new 
safety signals have been detected with sarilumab use in NIU compared with other indications. The AEs and laboratory changes were consistent with results observed in stu dies with sarilumab in RA 
patients and with IL -6 inhibition.  
 5.1.3 Intervention  
 In Period 1, patients will all receive sarilumab in an open -label fashion.  They will be provided with 
prefilled syringes containing 1.14 mL of sarilumab (equally 200mg), whi ch they will administer 
subcutaneously every two weeks.  This dose was chosen based on studies in rheumatoid arthritis that showed efficacy at this dose, and this is the FDA approved dose for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.   In Period [ADDRESS_1090576] Health Care, Attention: Investigational Drug Service, [ADDRESS_1090577], CA [ZIP_CODE].  Phone: [PHONE_16468].  
5.4 Agent Accountability  
All investigational drug supplies will be kept in appropriate, secure area (a locked refrigerator  in  
the locked pharmacy  room) under the responsibility of the Stanford Investigational Pharmacy  and 
will be stored separately from other medication and in the original carton as per specification 
mentioned on the label.  
 
6. DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
Sarilumab will be provided as a subcutaneous injection of 200 mg every two weeks.  There will be 
no dosage modifications.   
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES  
7.1 Potential Adverse Events 
The adverse drug reactions in Phase 3 trials (i.e., events potentially associated with sarilumab administration) are upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], nasopharyngitis, oral herpes urinary tract infection, neutropenia, leukope nia, thrombocytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, injection site 
erythema, injection site rash, rash, urticaria, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and increased ALT.  
 Based on the preclinical and clinical studies of sarilumab as well as the safety profile o f another 
IL-6 inhibitor (tocilizumab) and other biological DMARDs, hypersensitivity reactions, serious  
infections, and neutropenia, are an important identified risk with sarilumab administration. Important potential risks are thrombocytopenia and the pote ntial risk of bleeding, clinically  
evident hepatic injury, an impact on CV outcome (MACE) secondary to LDL elevation, GI perforations, and malignancy.  
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting

Protocol Version 3  25  19May2020  10. MEASUREMENTS  
 
10.1  Primary and Secondary Outcome measures  
Primary endpoint: The primary endpoint is the flare -free survival of sarilumab -treated patients 
compared to placebo -treated controls in the double-blind randomized withdrawal period (Period 2) 
from Week [ADDRESS_1090583] flared if they receive rescue 
medication including increased glucocorticoids, or if they discontinue the study treatment in order to start a different therapy.  
 Secondary endpoints: The following secondary endpoints will all be assessed at Week 16 and Week 28 compared to baseline as a paired analysis: the change in the extrapulmonary physician organ severity tool (ePOST) score (17 organs rated 0 -6, for a total score range of 0 -102) [16], the change 
in global score of sarcoidosis using a visual analogue scale (VAS) by [CONTACT_580678] (distance in mm measured on a 10 cm line), the change in FACIT- F score (fatigue scale ranging 
from 0 -52 with higher score meaning less fatigue), the change in the Health Assessment 
Questionnaire (HAQ), the change in prednisone dose, the change in serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, serum calcium, urine calcium, and serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25- OH-vit D), the change in pulmonary function tests (FVC, FEV1, and 
DLCO) , the change in ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase, the change in serum creatinine and 
urine protein levels, the change in the Sarcoidosis Activity and Severity Index for cutaneous sarcoidosis (7 parameters scored 0 -4 for a total score range of 0 -28) [17] , the change in CK, 
aldolase, and LDH, and the change in size of sarcoidosis lesions (i.e. enlarged lymph nodes, hepatic nodules, pulmonary nodul es) by [CONTACT_483446] .  For patients with known or suspected ocular 
involvement, the secondary endpoint of change in ophthalmology global assessment of ocular sarcoidosis using a visual analogue scale (VAS) (distance in mm measured on a 10 cm line) [18]  
will be assessed, as well as the change in any one or more of the following parameters: best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit lamp examination (including grading of anterior chamb er 
cells), tonometry, dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy (including grading of vitreous cells and haze), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography, color fundus photography, and fluorescein angiography.
   
 From Week 16 to Week 28, time to flare will be compared between sarilumab -treated patients and 
placebo -treated controls as well as the proportion of patients in glucocorticoid- free remission at 
Week 28 between the two groups as additional secondary endpoints.    Safety will be assessed by  [CONTACT_791143].  
 
11. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Institutional Review of Protocol  
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related to the study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_55790] .  Any changes made to the protocol will be submitted as a modification and will be 
approved by [CONTACT_14226].  The Protocol Director will disseminate the protocol amendment information to all participating investigators.  
 
Protocol Version 3  26  19May2020   
11.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
We will form  a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) consisting of two experience 
rheumatology clinicians at Stanford University.  The DSMC will audit study -related activities to 
determine whether the study has been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard 
operating procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practi ce (GCP).  This may include 
review of the following types of documents participating in the study: regulatory binders, case report forms, eligibility checklists, and source documents.  In addition, the DSMC will regularly 
review serious adverse events and protocol deviations associated with the research to ensure the protection of human subjects.  Results of the DSMC audit will be communicated to the IRB and the appropriate regulatory authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as needed.  
11.3 Data Management Plan 
The Protocol Director and his team  will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate participant 
case histories with observations and data pertinent to the study.  Study specific Case Report Forms 
(CRFs) will document t reatment outcomes for data analysis.   Case report forms will be developed 
as paper forms and  will be kept in a locked office, only accessible to the research team.  
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.[ADDRESS_1090584] deviation, median, minimum and maximum for quantitative values and counts and percents for qualitative variables.  
 The primary efficacy analysis of flare -free survival in Period 2 from Week 16 to Week 28 will use 
the intention -to-treat (ITT) population and will be assessed with Kaplan -Meier methods.  Patients 
will be considered to have flared in Period [ADDRESS_1090585] (BOCF) for those patients deemed non-responders.   
 
 
Protocol Version [ADDRESS_1090586].  The proportion of 
patients in glucocorticoid -free remission at week 28 in sarilumab -treated patients compared to 
placebo controls will be analyzed using a Fisher’s exact test.  The remaining secondary endpoint 
variables will be treated as continuous and the values at Week 28 will be compared to Week 16 and to Baseline values using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.  We will not perform any corrections for 
multiple hypothesis testing due to the exploratory nature of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_791130].  
 12.2    Randomization  In Period 2 of the study, patients will be randomized to sarilumab or matching placebo.  This will be done by [CONTACT_791144] .  This will be done using a computer -generated 
random number.  An odd number will be assigned to sarilumab and an even number will be assigned to placebo.  Only Angelica will be aware of the assignment and she will communicate this directly to 
the pharmacy.  The investigators and patients will remain blinded.  
 
12.3  Sample Size  
The sample size for Period 1 of the trial of 15 patients was calculate d based on the assumption that 
80% of the patients will respond to open- label sarilumab, allowing for 12 patients to enroll in the 
randomized withdrawal Period 2 of the study.  The sample size of 12 for Period 2 was calculated 
based on the assumption that 85% of the placebo group (roughly 5 out of 6) will flare (i.e. require reinitiation of prednisone) over the subsequent 12 weeks compared to 15% (roughly 1 out of 6) in the sarilumab group.  This relative hazard of 0.20 gives a power of 80% with an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_1090587] [19].  In that study, 21 out of 21 patients (100%) had a complete 
response in Period 1 and were subsequently randomized to withdrawal during Period 2.  In Period 2, 9 out of 10 (90%) patients receiving placebo had disease recurrence compared to 2 out of 11 patients (18%) receiving Anakinra.  Although this is a different disease with a drug targeting a different inflammatory cytokine, there is precedent for a dramatic response in diseases like sarcoidosis using drugs like sari lumab.

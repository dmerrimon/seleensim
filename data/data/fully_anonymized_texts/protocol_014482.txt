 3 1.0 Background 
Obesity is on the rise globally and is linked to cardiometabolic disease and inflammation.  
Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, with odds 
ratio for a pooled cardiometabolic outcome of 4.5 for class I obesity (body mass index (BMI) 
30.0- 34.9 kg/m2) and 14.5 for class II/III obesity (BMI ≥35.0 kg/m2).1 Obesity is also associated 
with chronic systemic and adipose tissue (AT) inflammation.2-4 Inflammation has been linked 
with atherosclerosis and CVD development in a multi -factorial process involving endothelial cell 
activation, expression of adhesion molecules and recruitment of monocytes into the 
vasculature.5 Differentiation of these cells into macrophages and foam cells propagates the local 
inflammatory response and leads to development and progression of atherosclerotic plaques.6 
Thus, low -grade inflammation is  thought to be a critical link between obesity and CVD 
development.7 
Macrophages and T cells are important in maintaining AT homeostasis and are dysregulated in obesity, contributing to systemic inflammation.  A change from lean to 
obese AT is accompanied by a change in macrophage profile from homeostatic interleukin (IL) -
10-producing to inflammatory IL -6 and tumor necros is factor (TNF) α- producing phenotype.
2 
Furthermore, lean AT is characterized by [CONTACT_14181] -inflammatory IL- 10-producing invariant natural 
killer T cells (iNKTs), IL -5-and IL- 13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), gamma-
delta T cells (γδT), and regulatory T cells (Tregs). With obesity, there is hypoxia associated with 
adipocyte hypertrophy and decreased blood supply leading to infiltration of pro- inflammatory 
CD8+ T cells, a decrease in iNKT, ILC2, and Tregs, and an increase in pro -inflammatory 
interferon (IFN)γ - and IL- 17-producing T -helper (Th) [ADDRESS_566042] architecture is needed to evaluate human AT macrophages as proposed in this study ( Aim 1b ).  
Adipose depots contribute differentially to cardiometabolic disease in obesity.  Visceral 
adipose tissue (VAT) that lines abdominal organs is approximately 10% of the fat in the hum an 
body, and VAT accumulation is a major risk factor for CVD and type 2 diabetes.
11 Subcutaneous 
adipose tissue (SAT) that is beneath the skin is approximately 85% of the fat in the body. While some studies have demonstrated independent contributions of both VAT and SAT to insulin 
resistance,
[ADDRESS_566043] evidence that preferential accumulation of SAT during weight gain is associated with improved metabolic parameters, acting as a “metabolically safe” depot for excess fat 
deposition.
9,16 While both VAT and SAT likely contribute to chronic inflammation of obesity, 
many of the cellular inflammatory features of obesity are more pronounced in VAT, including accumulation of  pro-inflammatory macrophages,
17-19 Th1 and Th17 cells.20 Studying VAT poses 
a special challenge in humans, as it is only accessible during abdominal surgery. SAT is more 
easily accessible either by [CONTACT_445038]. Our study allows investigation of the 
inflammatory milieu in both VAT and SAT in relation to endothelial function, enabling us to better 
assess the contribution of each adipose depot to surrogate markers of CVD.  
7/12/[ADDRESS_566044] had mixed success.21 A randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) of colchicine in patients with stable coronary disease found a 67% 
reduction of cardiovascular (CV) events.22 Positive results were also reported with 
hydroxychloroquine in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,23 while methotrexate had mixed 
results.24,25 Finally, IL -1β antibody treatment in those with a prior myocardial infarction and high-
sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP) above 2mg/L resulted in 15% reduction in CV events.[ADDRESS_566045] -of-care in the management of obese 
individuals at risk for or with established CVD. Thus, there remains a significant need for specific, targeted drugs that will reverse obesity -associated inflammation and prevent adverse 
cardiometabolic outcomes.  
SGLT2 inhibitors lower blood sugar and reduce major adverse CV outcomes.  Sodium 
glucose co- transporter 2 (SGLT2) is a membrane protein found largely in the kidneys that is 
responsible for re- absorption of 90- 97% of filtered glucose. SGLT2 inhibitors cause glucose 
excretion in the urine, reduce hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and induce weight loss of 2 -3 kilograms 
(kg).
27 In the EMPA -REG OUTCOME study, the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin significantly 
decreased major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in diabetic patients with established CVD.
28 Subsequent large CV outcome trials (CANVAS, DECLARE -TIMI 58, and CREDENCE) 
have now established a class effect for SGLT2 inhibitors in secondary prevention for MACE and primary and secondary prevention for heart failure and chronic kidney disease.
29-33 Both the 
American Diabetes Association and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines now recommend consideration of an SGLT2 inhibitor in those at risk for CVD.
34,35  
SGLT2 inhibitors’ mechanism(s) of CV benefit are unclear. Trials testing strict glucose control or 
similar degrees of weight loss have failed to show equivalent CV benefits, suggesting SGLT2 inhibition has independent effects on CV health.  In addition, in the DAPA -HF study, patients with 
heart failure benefited from SGLT2 inhibition regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes, with decreased worsening heart failure or death from CV causes.
[ADDRESS_566046] been shown to improve indices of NAFLD. Non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of disease s that ranges from simple steatosis to non- alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH), an inflammatory condition characterized by  [CONTACT_445039]. Obesity and insulin resistance are major risk factors for 
development of NAFLD, and those with NAFLD have increased prevalence of comorbid 
CVD.37,[ADDRESS_566047]  is mediated 
by [CONTACT_445040].  
  
7/12/22  
 7 of diabetics decreased hsCRP, which correlated with improvements in insulin resistance.45 Of 
note, while some of the anti -inflammatory effects of SGLT2 may be modulated by [CONTACT_445041] -term studies, it is unlikely that the small degree of weight loss of 2- 3kg is 
sufficient to explain all the anti -inflammatory findings.  In a study by [CONTACT_445042]., a careful 
evaluation of systemic and AT inflammation was performed after increasing degrees of weight 
loss in obese participants. This group found no improvement in inflammation after 5- 11% weight 
loss, with trends in improvement starting to appear at 16% weight loss although not statistically 
significant.[ADDRESS_566048] improved inflammation as demonstrated by [CONTACT_445043] -

7/12/[ADDRESS_566052] that 
SGLT2 inhibition will improve NAFLD indi ces and TE -CAP imaging as measured in Aim 3 , and 
that the relative change in AT inflammation will be associated with improvements in hepatic 
steatosis.  
Methods:  
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test:  Afte r an overnight fast, subjects will be given 75- g glucose by 
[CONTACT_1966]. We will draw blood at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after administration of glucose for measurement of plasma glucose, insulin, and C -peptide.  
Vascular endothelial function (FMD):  M
 easurement of endothelium -dependent and endothelium-
independent vasodilation will be performed using methods employed in multiple prior studies by [CONTACT_37152].
67-[ADDRESS_566053] period, endothelium -independent vasodilation will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_445044] (0.4 mg). Acquisition and analysis of the stored images will be 
performed using software designed for this purpose by [CONTACT_445045]. The 
vessel wall lumen interface will be determined by [CONTACT_445046] e-based edge detection following 
identification of the region of the anterior and posterior walls by [CONTACT_093]. The maximum 
diameter of the vessel will be determined and the percent change in diameter calculated. We 
have found that this technique yields an inter -observer variability of 0.05±0.16% and intra-
observer variability of 0±0.15%.  
Subcutaneous adipose harvest by [CONTACT_445047]: SAT will
  be obtained from the periumbilical area 
using a Tulip CellFriendlyTM GEMS closed syringe system for lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Approximately 5- 10 
g of tissue is removed (~5.5- 11 cc at a specific gravity of 0.918 for human fat). Immune cell 
extraction from the stromal vascular fraction will be performed using a gentleMACSTM 
Dissociator from Miltenyi Biotec followed by [CONTACT_445048], mononuclear cell 
separation with Ficoll -Paque and cryopreservation for flow cytometry/sorting.  
PBMC  harvest:  PBMC s will be obtained through the peripheral IV into [ADDRESS_566054]:  Endothelial cell harvest will be performed by [CONTACT_15728] a 0.018” sterile 
J- wire (Arrow International, PA) back and forth two to six cm beyond the tip of a venous catheter 
placed in a cubital vein. Approximately 1000 -1500 ECs can be isolated after four passes of the 
wire. Cell viability is >90% with >90% staining positive for expected EC markers (nitric oxide 
synthase, vWF) without contamination by [CONTACT_445049].  
TE-CAP:  Liver elastography will be assessed using the FibroScan system by [CONTACT_445050] . All 
7/12/[ADDRESS_566055] 
4 hours before the procedure . The participant’s  abdom en will be exposed and will be placed 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_445032] . A water -
soluble gel will be applied to the participant’s  abdomen and a FibroScan probe will be placed 
over the intercostal space over the liver . Final results will be expressed as the median of 10 
successful measurements.  Success will be defined as 10 captures with an interquartile range 
lower than 30% of the m edian kPa (fibrosis) and dB/m (steatosis).  Patients with significant 
fibrosis  defined as >8.[ADDRESS_566056] for further evaluation . 
 
Laboratory Analyses : 
Clinical assays will be run in Vanderbilt CLIA -approved laboratories.  Blood drawn for research 
assays will be centrifuged immediately at 4oC for [ADDRESS_566057] two aliquots, labeled, logged and stored separately at -80oC until sampling.  
Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  DNA will be extracted from whole blood using the AutoPure LS extraction system 
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, [LOCATION_003]). Samples will be stored for future exploratory analys es.

immediately if they develop symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malaise or 
shortness of breath so they can be evaluated. We will exclude those at increased risk for 
ketoacidosis including pancreatic insulin deficiency from any cause, caloric restriction and alcohol abuse.  
9. Empagliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction. We will screen patients for risk of 
symptomatic hypotension, which is more likely in presence of renal impairment, elderly, patients with low systolic blood pressure, and those on diuretics. Adverse reactions 
related to volume depletion occur in 0.3% of those on placebo and 0.3% of those on 
empagliflozin in pooled studies.  
7/12/[ADDRESS_566059] infections (17% on empagliflozin versus 16.6% on placebo in females, and 4.1% on empagliflozin versus 3.2% on 
placebo in males). We will exclude those with history of recurrent UTIs.  
12. Rare cases of urosepsis and pyelonephritis have been reported in post -marketing 
analysis.  
13. Empaglifloz in increases the risk for genital mycotic infections, especially in those with 
history of chronic or recurrent infections. In females the rate is 6.4% in empagliflozin as compared with 1.5% in placebo, and in males 1.6% with empagliflozin as compared with 
0.4% in placebo. We will exclude uncircumcised men or men with history of balanitis, 
and women with history of severe vulvovaginitis or recurrent vulvovaginitis (>3) per year.  
14. Empagliflozin causes an increase in urination (0.8% in empagliflozin versus 0.4%  in 
placebo) and increase in thirst.  
15. Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum has been identified in post -marketing surveillance in 
patient with diabetes.  
16. Hypoglycemia can be observed with concomitant use of insulin and insulin secretagogues. We will study non-diabetic patients who are not on any medications.  
17. Empagliflozin can increase LDL- C.  
18. There may be unknown or unanticipated adverse effects.  
 
 
8.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to  
Participants or Others  
 A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will provide objective review of human safety 
and data quality. Committee members will be Dr. C. Michael Stein, Adriana Hung, and Tebeb 
Gebretsadik . [CONTACT_192093]  will chair the committee. All members hold a primary appointment outside 
the Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism . 
The DSMC will also receive quarterly reports of enrollment, protocol adherence, data quality, 
and adverse events (AE)s. The DSMC will review all serious AEs (SAEs), suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]RS), and serious adverse drug reactions 
(SADRs). Any SAE, S[LOCATION_003]R, or SADR will be reported to the DSMC, IRB , and FDA , if 
appropriate , as soon as possible, but not mor e than 7 days from the investigator ’s notification  of 
the event. Any pregnancy occurring during the trial would be reported similarly.  
Subjects will be questioned about AEs at each study visit. Any untoward medical event will be classified as an AE, regardless of its causal relationship with the study. Relationship to a study 
medication will be assessed as probably, possible or unlikely based on the [LOCATION_002] Package Insert for the drug. An AE will be classified as serious if it a) results in death, b)  is life -
threatening, c) requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], d) results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, e) is a congenital anomaly or birth 
defect. Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_445033]. The 
DSMC may choose to become unblinded; however, it is expected that such unblinding would 
not occur without reasonable concern related either to patient safety or to data validity.  
Non-serious AEs and instances of noncompliance with the protocol will be reported at  
the time of annual review.

 1  BACKGROUND INFORMATION    
1.1 Introduction  
 
Rotator cuff tears (RCTs) are amongst the most common orthopaedic condition in adults.  The 
incidence of rotator cuff tears increases in frequency with age (Lehman, 1995) and is often 
associated with degeneration of the tendons (Matava, 2005).  Full thickness tears of the rotator 
cuff are among the most commo n sources of pain and dysfunction in the shoulder (Bunker, 
2002).  Approximately 18 million Americans self -reported shoulder pain in 2005.  By 2030, over 
20% of the US population will be over 65, with that the prevalence of rotator cuff disorders are 
expec ted to increase over the next two decades (AAOS, 20 13).   
RCTs are classified by [CONTACT_804397] (Matthews, 2006), the presence of tendon retraction, 
chronicity of the injury (Coleman, 2003; Liu, 2011) and the amount of muscle atrophy and 
degree of fa tty degeneration (Harryman, 1991; Goutallier, 2007; Encalada -Diaz, 2011).  Tears 
may range in severity from partial to massive.  
Massive tears, commonly defined as a tear is greater than 5 centimeters in diameter (Cofield, 
1985) are frequently associated w ith pain, weakness, and functional disability (Jost, 2006; 
Gartsman, 1997).  Furthermore, these massive tears have demonstrated unfavorable outcomes 
following conservative care, necessitating surgical intervention.  
Although technically challenging, complet e primary repair of the massive tear may be achieved 
through open or arthroscopic procedures (Mellado, 2005). When a patient has pain and weakness 
in the setting of a massive tear which may not be amenable to complete repair, there are a variety 
of potenti al treatment options (Elhassan, 2008).  These options may include conservative 
management (e.g., physical therapy) (Walch, 2005), simple decompression and debridement with 
or without biceps tenotomy (or tenodesis), subscapular nerve release, biologic augme ntation, 
tendon transfer, partial repair, and reconstruction with hemiarthroplasty or reverse shoulder 
arthroplasty (Encalada -Diaz, 2011; Moser, 2007; Aurora, 2007; Goldberg, 2008; Cuff, 2008; 
Berth, 2010). A thorough history and physical examination are i mportant to establish the 
diagnosis and determine the most appropriate treatment.  The treatment algorithm is largely

 based on the patient’s level of function, age, comorbidities, size and quality of remaining rotator 
cuff (Tonino, 2009).  
Arthroscopic part ial repair, as advocated by [CONTACT_804398]. (Burkhart, 1997) attempts to restore 
function and provide pain reduction.  This approach involves surgical repair utilizing anchors or 
suture placement and requires a protracted period of recovery in order to pro tect the repair.  
Biomechanical studies have supported such partial repair approaches (Hsu, 2011; Burkhart, 
1997).  
Nevertheless, repair of massive tears is often followed by [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -tears, additional muscular 
degeneration, and diminished clinical results over time (Galatz, 2004). Given this, there remains 
a need to evaluate potential alternatives which may prove effective in the treatment of full 
thickness massive rotator cuff tears.  
The study device, the InSpace™ device, is an inflatable  biodegradable balloon that is deployed 
arthroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_804384], acting as a spacer, in patients with full thickness 
massive RCTs.  The temporary lowering of the humeral head during spacer inflation may 
additionally provide improved balance between the subsca pularis anteriorly and the infraspi[INVESTIGATOR_804385], permitting better deltoid activation and compensation. The use of the InSpace device 
may be a simple and less invasive alternative that has the potential to provide comparable safety 
and effectiveness p rofile to the current, well -established technique of arthroscopic partial repair.  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the InSpace device as a 
primary surgical treatment for full thickness massive rotator cuff tears. Sec ondary aims include 
evaluating additional clinical outcomes  and imaging .

The InSpace  device  is folded inside the outer protecting sheath of the D eployer  (Figure 1 ).  
Through an arthroscopic procedure , following standard debridement/ ASD of the  shoulder,  the 
Deployer is placed in-situ and the InSpace device  is positioned in the sub -acromial  space 
between th e humeral  head and the acromion.  The InSpace  device  is inflated  with a physiological 
solution (i.e. , saline)  and sealed with the p lug attached to the tip of the internal inflation tube .  In 
this position,  the InSpace  device  fills the space created by [CONTACT_804400]  (Figure 3 ).              
The InSpace device  degrades within 12 months, a period that may conform  well to the 
rehabilitation timeframe following a rotator cuff arthroscopic procedure.

(2) An e xternal stainless steel  overmold tube with plug, mounted on an internal stainless steel 
inflation needle . This component is intended for InSpace device  insertion, inflati on and sealing 
(Figure s 1 and 2 ). 
(3) A protecting sheath tube that provides the InSpace device  external protection  while  
performing the  arthroscopic placement of the InSpace device in the sub -acromial space . 
1.4 Regulatory Status  and Human Clinical Data  
The InSpace system was CE ( Conformité Européenne,  2011) marked in July 2010 and is 
available for distribution throughout Europe.  Since its approval , over two thousand  (2000) of  the 
InSpace  devices were  implanted into patients diagnosed with RCT .  
Within these implantation s the company received 19 (~1%) complaints of medical events  which 
included  events such as deterioration in shoulder pain, device dis placement , inflammatory 
reaction to the device, and suspected infection.   Although not necessarily related to the device, 
twelve (12)  of these events (0.75%  95% exact bi nomial CI; [0.39% - 1.17%])  required device 
explantation, and  nine (9) events (0.56%  95% exact binomial CI; [0.26% - 1.07%]) were 
associated with suspected infection. No events associated with deep joint infections were 
reported. All subjects that underwen t explantation of the device were fully recovered following 
the procedure with no further complications .

 Additional d ata has been collected in a single center study ex ecuted in Slovenia  that 
enrolled  24 subjects. Eligible subjects were diagnosed  with rotator cuff tears ( Senekovic  et 
al. 2013) . The subjects were divided to two groups – scheduled for repair or un -repairable. 
This study cited no serious adverse device effects (SADE) . Significant improvement s in 
subjective pain scores commencing at [ADDRESS_1110163] synovitis based on  
Magnetic Resonance ( MR) Imaging.  This was considered non -clinically significant and no 
bone  formation were observed at the [ADDRESS_1110164] -operative follow -up.  
Of 15 subjects who completed the 5 years assessment 86,6% (13/15) maintained an 
improvement of at least [ADDRESS_1110165] implantation.  
Throughout the study the subjects exhibited an improvement from a Total Constant S core 
of 36 at baseline to 64.3 at one year follow up.   
There were two Serious Adverse Device Effects  (SADEs) during the course of this study. 
One event resulted in the subject ’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_804386]’s advanced age (8 1) and concomitant Diabetes and the other required device 
explanation.  Both events were resolved, one following conservative treatment and the  
other following an additional arthroscopic procedure.  
As the expected range for SADEs following the use of implants in orthopedic surgeries 
ranges from 4% to 19% (Freehill , 2003 ], the SADE rate presented in this study,  which is 
3.45% (95% exact confidence  interval: [0.42% -11.99%]) indicates an acceptable risk for 
the implantation and use of the InSpaceTM device.  
There were no unexpected adverse events in this study. All adverse events in the study 
were classified as either mild or moderate with no events classified as severe. Most of 
these events resolved within a few days of initiation, with either conservative treatment: 
medications (mainly analgesics) or observation only.

 Adverse Device Effects (ADEs) following implantable orthopedic devices in the sho ulder 
are not uncommon and have been reported in up to 47% of the cases ( Böstman,  2000, 
Mulieri, 2010 ]. In this study, 15 out of the 58 subjects (25.8 6%) reported a total of 20 
ADEs  thus the ADE rate is 34.48% (95% exact confidence interval: [22.49% -48.12% ]). 
This rate was found to be clinically acceptable for a new implantable device, given the low 
rates of serious, device -related events.  
Following the  results of these two studies as well as the experience that was gained in the 
commercial use of over than  2000 implantations in Europe,  it can be concluded that the use 
of the Ortho -Space’s InSpace™ device in subjects with rotator cuff tears is a safe and 
effective treatment option associated with early improvement in the TCS and its related 
sub-scores.   
1.[ADDRESS_1110166] diagnostic arthroscopy, the InSpace device  is positioned , using its 
deployment system , in the sub -acromial space between the humeral  head and the acromion . 
Once the deployer tube is placed in -situ the InSpace device  is exposed by [CONTACT_804401] (which provides the InSpace device  external protection to allow 
arthroscopic  placement)  and exposing the folded InSpace device . Following removal of the 
protecting sheath the InSpace device  is inflated with a physiological solution  (i.e. saline)  
and sealed.  In this position, the InSpace  device  fills the space created by [CONTACT_804402] l of the 
bursa thus allowing smooth gliding without friction of the humeral head against the 
acromion.  
The InSpace device  is designed to reduce pain  associated with the full thickness MRCT s.  
Because pain associated with  a full thickness MRCT may cause abn ormal motion, l imit 
function  and required  rehabilitation , quality of life may be greatly impacted.  Breaking the 
pain cycle is intended to allow patients the potential opportuni ty of temporary pain relief,  a 
return to more normal shoulder function,  and reduce the need for more invasive procedures

lifestyle, emotions).  
• American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES): a subject self -report 
questionnaire and Investigator assessment questionnaire.  The subject portion 
collects information on pain (i.e., 5 question s plus a VAS), instability (using a 
VAS) and activities of daily living (i.e., 10 questions) . The MCID for the ASES has 
been determined to be 6.4 points, which is the value that is associated with the 
patient’s perception of meaningful change (Michener LA,  2002) .  The Investigator 
assessment portion documents ROM, signs, strength, and instability.  
• Constant -Murley Shoulder Outcome Score: performed by [CONTACT_804405], external 
rotation and i nternal rotation, and power score.  
•  EuroQOL five dimensions questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L): a subject self-report

mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/ depressio n). It also 
includes  a numerical  visual analogue scale (EQ -VAS).  
• Visual Analogue Scale (VAS): a subject self -report questionnaire to measure pain . 
The patient marks o n the line the point that they feel represents their perception of 
their current state.   The amount of pain that a patient feels ranges across a 
continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain.

 4.2 Description of Study Endpoints  
4.2.1 Primary Composite Endpoint  
The primary  composite endpoint has four components as follows:  
• WORC improvement of 275 points by [CONTACT_10585] 6 from pre -operative baseline 
and maintained at  Month 12  
• ASES  improvement of 6.4 points by [CONTACT_10585] 6 from pre -operative baseline 
and maintained at  Month 12  
• No subsequent secondary surgical interventions (SSSI) in the index 
shoulder through Mont h 12 
• Absence of Serious Adverse Device Effects (SADEs), through Month [ADDRESS_1110195] component of the composite endpoint is a clinical measure.  WORC  is a validated 
and re liable disease -specific quality of life index that assesses multiple domains with 
twen ty-one (21) questions from five ( 5) domains that are scored with use of a 100 -mm 
VAS. The total score ranges from 0 to 2100, with higher scores indicating a worse 
outcome . Results from Kirkley et al. (2003) and Ekeberg et al. (2010)  have established a  
minimal important change of less or equal to 275 WORC points .  In this study , we use the 
mean difference for a component of the composite endpoint with success declared when a 
275-point improvement from pre -operative baseline is achieved by [CONTACT_10585] 6 and maintain ed 
at Month 12.   
The second component is an improvement in pain and function.  The American Shoulder 
and Elbow Surgeons Assessment Form (ASES) was developed as a standardized 
assessment of shoulder function  (Richards RR, 1994) .  The ASES patient self -reported 
section, consists of 2 dimensions: pain and activities of daily living (function).  The pain 
score is determined from a single pain question, and the function score from the sum of 10 
questions specific to activities of daily living. In this study, for a component of the 
composite endpoint we use the mean difference with success declared if a  6.4-point 
improvement  in the ASES computed score  from pre -operative baseline is achieved by 
[CONTACT_10585] 6 and maintained at  Month 12 .  This aligns with the ASES  MCID determined by  
[CONTACT_804406]. (2002).     
Ortho -Space Ltd: CLD -OR-[ADDRESS_1110196] component is the absence of any subsequent secondary surgical interventions 
(SSSI) in the index shoulder through Month 12. 
The fourth component is the Absence of Serious Adverse Device Effects (SADEs), 
throug h Month 12 . 
 
4.2.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Clinical Endpoints:  
• Composite endpoint component -level success for WORC  compared to baseline  
• Composite endpoint component -level success for ASES compared to baseline  
• Change in Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Ind ex (WORC) questionnaire scores from 
baseline . Mean and percent changes as well as the corresponding standard 
deviations will be calculated.  
• Change in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) from baseline . Mean 
changes and standard deviations will be ca lculated.  
• Change in Constant -Murley Shoulder Outcome Score from baseline .  Mean 
changes and standard deviations will be calculated.  
• Change in EuroQOL five dimensions questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L) from baseline . 
Mean changes and standard deviations will be calcu lated.  
• Change in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores from baseline . Mean changes and 
standard deviations will be calculated.  
• Change in Range of Motion (ROM) from baseline . Mean changes and standard 
deviations will be calculated.  
• Composite endpoint success at Month 24  
o Imaging endpoints will include reading of MRI scans conducted at : 
o Week [ADDRESS_1110197] treatment to assess  (Group I: InSpace device [includes only 
subjects enrolled under Protocol V3.0, May 1, 201 7]): 
▪ device location in the sub -acromial space  
o Month [ADDRESS_1110198] treatment  to assess  (all randomized subjects) : 
▪ the device residuals ( Group I – InSpace only )  
▪ the shoulder joint and surrounding tissue condition (Group I: 
InSpace device and Group II: Partial Repair)   
 
Ortho -Space Ltd: CLD -OR-[ADDRESS_1110199] year after surgery, the radiological assessment of the rotator cuff will serve as a 
supportive marker to establish the efficacy for the study success (based on the clinical 
evaluation of the index shoulder).  
Shoulder  MRI will be conducted per imaging acquisition guidance (Appendix C) in the 
following visits:  
• Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline): All Subjects (Both Arms): Pre -operative baseline 
MRI scan within 9 months of enrollment . 
• Visit 7 (12 Month Follow -Up): All Subjects (Both Arms):  
Group I: InSpace device

• to assess the shoulder joint and surrounding tissue condition at [ADDRESS_1110201] 
implantation.    
Group II: Partial Repair  
• to assess the shoulder joint and s urrounding tissue condition at [ADDRESS_1110202] 
implantation.    
Additionally, at Week 6 all study treatment arm subjects  (Group I: InSpace device 
[includes only subjects enrolled under Protocol V3.0, May 1, 2017]) will receive an MRI 
to assess  the device lo cation in the sub -acromial space.  
Shoulder MRI will be conducted per imaging acquisition guidance (Appendix H) in the 
following visit:

 In addition, at any stage during th e follow up period, if deemed necessary by t he 
Investigator , (due to clinical symptoms such as suspected infection, suspected device 
displacement associated with deterioration in shoulder function  or symptomatic re-tear of 
the repaired rotator cuff) should er radiography (X -Ray) , ultrasound or MRI may be

percent for InSpace vs. Partial Repair Control  while the alternative hypothesis is that there 
is less than a 10% disadvantage for InSpace (PT) vs. Partial Repair Control  (PC). 
 H0:  P T – PC ≤ -10%  
versus 
 HA:  P T – PC > -10%.  
The non -inferiority design allows a penalty -free test for superiority in the event that non -
inferiority is established (one -sided p ≤0.025).  Non -inferiority will rule out the 10% non -
inferiority margin favoring InSpace while superiority will need to rule out a 0% margin 
favoring InSpace.  
This sequential hypothesis testing has the Type I error rates for both the non -inferiority and 
superiority controlled at one -sided 2.5% Type 1 error with superiority to be tested after 
non-inferiority as:    
H0: PT ≤ P C   
versus    
HA: PT > PC,

A total of 18 4 subjects (92 subjects per group) will be randomized to ensure that at least 
166 subjects (83  subjects per group) complete the study ; it is assumed that 10% will be 
exclud ed.  The hypothesis testing will be one -sided with 2.5% Type I error to test non -

 4.8 Interim Analysis (IA)  
An Interim Analysis (IA) will be conducted when approximately 80 per-protocol  subjects 
(~40 per treatment group) have been randomized and completed the Month [ADDRESS_1110206] operating procedure (SOP) that has a 
well-established firewall to protect the integrity of the study , and the Type I Error rate will be 
adjusted to maintain the Trial -wise Error rate . The IA will be performed by [CONTACT_804408], who is not otherwise associated with the conduct of this study . The IA will be 
conducted under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_804389] (DSMB).  
The objectives of this  initial  IA are to apply a promising zone methodology  to make the 
following decisions : 
• Re-assess s ample size to evaluate the sample size estimations, which will serve in the  
planning of the remaining study . An unblinded  statistician will conduct the power 
analyses.  
• Assess futility of continuing the study  based on the interim data.  
The study will not be stopped for superiority.  
 
4.8.1 Procedures for Interim Analysis  
• Cutoff dates for collection of CRFs, data cleaning, database lock and analysis is 
establi shed based on an estimated target date of the  80th treated subject per protocol 
completing the Month [ADDRESS_1110207] treatment follow up.    
• All data received by [CONTACT_679668], validated, queries generated and 
resolved or pending queries documented.   
• The database is locked for the IA.  
• The locked database is saved in a drive to which only the unblinded statistician 
responsible for the IA has access.  
Using this data, the unblinded statistician will prepare safety summaries and calculate the 
follow ing m etrics for the primary end point:

 2. The dropout rate at the time of the IA . 
3. The Conditional Power (CP) Analysis of the study  at the time of the IA (Chen, 
2004). (The method for this calculation is provided i n the paragraph below).  
4. The revised sample size requirement based on this IA (The rule and method for 
sample size recalculation and p -value adjustment are provided below).  
4.8.2 Conditional Power Calculation  
The CP will be calculated according to the below formu la (Chen, 2004) using the Month 
12 success  percent s for the study treatment group to control treatment groups   
CP (f1,z1) = Φ { z 1 / 
    –   zα  / 
  } 
Where:  
• CP(f 1,z1)  is the conditional power at the IA  
• Φ{.} is the cumulative distribution function of a standard Normal distribution 
(μ=0, σ2 = 1)  
• f1 is the fraction of patients enrolled and used in t he IA before decision of 
increasing the sample size  
• zα is the upper α bound  for standard Normal distribution  
• z1 is the standardized Normal, since the primary endpoint is based on 
proportions the z -score will be obtained from the following formula:  
z1 = ((pt – pc - δ)/√(( pt(1-pt)/nt) + (pc(1-pc)/nc))  
Where:  
o pt = the Composite success percent at Month 12 for the subjects in the study 
treatment group     
o pc = the Composite success percent at Month 12 for the subjects in the control 
treatment group   
o pt(1-pt) = the standard deviation for the subjects in the study treatment 
group  
o pc(1-pc) = the standard deviation for the  subjects in the c ontrol  
treatment  group  
o nt = the number of subjects in the study treatment  group  used in the IA  
o nc = the number of subjects in the c ontrol  treatment  group used in the IA  
o t = the InSpace  group  
o c = the Control group  
The resulting CP will be used to determine whether the sample size needs to be 
increased or remain unchanged.

 4.8.3 Rules and Method for Increasing Sample Size  
Rules:   
• If the conditional power at the time of the interim analysis is < 10 % then  the study 
will be terminated for futility .  
• If the conditional power is >=  10% but <36% , then the sample  size will not be 
increased and the study  will continue based on the original samp le size.  
• If the conditional power is >= 36% and less than 80% , then the sample size will be 
adjusted to retain the original power of 80% or doubling the sample size, whichever 
is the smallest.  
• If the conditional power is >=  80%, then  the study will conti nue as is.   
The sample size may also be adjusted to reflect the Partial Repair control success percent.  
 
If the dropout rate is >10% for reasons other than safety or effectiveness, then the sample 
size will be increased accordingly to ensure that the PP a ccrual target is met.  
Regardless of the size of the CP, the study  sample size will not be reduced.  
 
Data Provided to DSMB :  
The DSMB  will receive a statistical report, the details on the content of the  report is 
described in the DSMB  charter.

Information Provided to Sponsor by [CONTACT_804409] (DSMB) : 
The DSMB  will make recommendations to  the S ponsor on the futility and sample size 
adjustment and any safety concerns.  
Type I Err or Rate Adjustment:   
The overall Type I error rate will be one -sided 2.5%, which is equivalent to two -sided 5%. 
There will be no Type I error rate adjustment as there is no intention to stop the study for 
efficacy benefit. In addition, the sample size is p lanned to be increased when the interim 
conditional power is promi sing and this will protect the Type 1 error  (Mehta, Pocock – 
2000).

 Given that this is a non -inferiority analysis, t he PP analysis popula tion will be used as the 
primary analysis population  supportive of non -inferiority and will also be used to generate 
all other effectiveness endpoints in support of non -inferiority and to confirm superiority.   
4.11.3  Safety Population  
The Safety population is def ined as all randomized subjects who underwent the study 
surgical procedure ( i.e., InSpace device  or Partial Repair ). This population will be used for 
the analysis of safety parameters.  
4.11.4  Covariates  
For efficacy analyses, gender will be used as a covariate in  the primary endpoint analysis 
models  while gender and the baseline covariate will be used as covariates in secondary 
effectiveness endpoint analyses .

non-inferiority testing to achieve an extended claim in the following pre -defined order 
using the non -inferiority margins specified in the SAP :   
• Mean WORC change from pre -operative baseline is non -inferior at Week 6 and 
maintained at Month 12 for the InSpace device.  
• Mean ASES change from pre -operative baseline is non -inferior at Week 6 and 
maintained at Month 12 for the InSpace device.  
Superiority will also be tested if non -inferiority is proven penalty -free per claim using one -
sided p <0.025 since the alternative hypothesis of superiority is a subset of the alternative 
hypothesis of non -inferiority.  Thus, each endpoint, for which non -inferiority is

superiority for a specific endpoint will not terminate the sequential testing plan.  
There are no further multiple comparisons involving time or endpoints to i mpact the 
overall Type I error.  
4.12 Statistical Methods  
A SAP  will be developed and approved before the interim analysis database is locked. The 
SAP will present the detailed statistical methodology to be used in analyzing the efficacy  
and safety data from th is study .  
All the eff ectiveness  endpoints will be analyzed  using both the ITT (primary for 
superiority and secondary  for non -inferiority ) and PP  (primary  for non -inferiority and 
secondary for superiority ) populations .  The PP population will be  primary to test non-
inferiority while the  ITT population will be primary to test superiority.  The ITT 
population analyses will not be performed if less than 5% of the ITT population  is 
excluded  or did not use the randomized treatment . The ITT analysis will be perf ormed 
using the randomized treatment assigned  while t he PP analyses will be performed using the 
actual t reatment  used.  All safety analysis will be conducted using the safety population  
according to the actual study treatment .  
All primary and secondary endpoint s will be tested  using one -sided 97.5% confidence 
interval s.  All primary and secondary analyses will be repeated for the ITT population.  
All data collected will be summarized according to the variable type:  
• Continuous data summaries  comparing treat ment groups  will include:  
o Number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, and minimum and 
maximum values.   
o Unpaired t -tests for the mean changes from baseline for each secondary 
outcome at each nominal visit.  
o Generalized Estimating Equation (G EE) analysis (SAS PROC MIXED) 
analysis including the respective baseline covariate, age, gender, treatment, 
visit, and visit -treatment interaction .

Demographic and baseline characteristic data will be summarized descrip tively and/or 
presented as a by -subject listing for the Safety population  and Per Protocol populations . 
4.12.3  Protocol Deviations  
The deviations occurring during the clinical study will be summarized and/or presented as 
a by-subject listing.  
4.12.4  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medic ations will be summarized separately for the Safety and Per Protocol 
population s. All prior and concomitant medications recorded in the case report form will 
be coded to the drug substance level ( i.e., generic term)  using the most recent version of 
WHO Dru g. Descriptive summaries, by [CONTACT_1570], will be prepared using the coded 
term. All prior , continuing,  and new medications recorded in the case report form will be 
listed.   
4.12.5  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
The primary analysis will be a logistic regression model for Month 12 success with age, 
gender, and treatment as the model covariates for the PP and ITT  population s using the 
composite endpoint.  The method of Firth (Firth, 2013)  will be used to compute unbiased 
percent estimates of the composite endpoint for each treatment group from the logistic 
regression model odds ratio estimate . 
The same approach will be used for the Month 24 analysis using the PP  and ITT  
population s.

 4.12.6  Secondary Endpoint  Analyses  
Endpoint -specific Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE ) models ( SAS PROC MIXED)  
will be used to further evaluate the  secondary endpoints for non -inferiority and superiority 
using the PP and ITT population s. The non-inferiority margins (δ) will be prospectively 
defined in the AP.  The method will be  provided in detail in the SAP for the study.  
Additionally, the c omposite endpoint at Months 12 and 24 except  requiring: (1) no 
subsequent secondary surgical interventions ( SSSI) in the index shoulder, and (2) no 
Serious Adverse Device Effects (SADEs) will be performed with multiple time point 
iterations determining when WORC and ASES clinical improvements threshold are 
achieved. Th e method will be  provided in detail  in the S tatistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for 
the study.  
4.12.7  Other Outcome Analyses  
The following descriptive analyses will further support publications comparing the 
InSpace device with Partial Repair control as per the original SAP. Unpaired t -tests and 
one-sided 97.5%  confidence intervals will be computed at Weeks 6 and 12 as well as at 
Months 6, 12, and 24 for the PP and ITT population s: 
• Change from baseline in the mean and mean percent WORC scores  
• Change from baseline in the mean and mean percent American Shoulder an d

▪ TEAEs by [CONTACT_367814].  
Related AEs (ADEs) will also be presented .  In addition, separate summaries of SAEs  and 
SADEs will also be presented.  
The total number of subjects with at least one AE/ADE and the number of AEs/ADEs will 
be derived.  If more than one AE/ADE with the same preferred term occurs within a 
subject during the study period, they will be counted only once for that subject using the 
worst reported severity and causal relationship to the intervention. AEs/ADEs will al so be 
tabulated versus worst severity and worst relationship to the intervention.  
Symptoms recorded before administration of intervention will only be presented in listings.

 5 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
5.1 Definitions   
5.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE can be any unfavorable  and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a study device, whether or not considered related to the study 
device.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expected Adverse Events  
Expected Adverse Events include:  
• Post-operative fever  
• Hematoma  
• Localized pain  
• Increase in shoulder pain  
• Sensation decrease at incision site  
• Inflammation

5.1.[ADDRESS_1110215]  
ADEs are AEs caused by [CONTACT_68878].  
5.1.3 Serious Adverse Events  
Events are classif ied as serious if they meet any of the following criteria (in accordance 
with the recommendations of ICH [Federal Register, October 7, 1997, Vol. 62, No. 194, pp 
[ZIP_CODE] -45]):  
• Results in death,  
• Is life -threatening (NOTE:  the term “life -threatening” in the d efinition of 
“serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe),

 Additionally, events are classified as serious if they meet any of the following criteria:  
• Requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment/damage, or  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse device effect 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above.  
5.1.[ADDRESS_1110216]  ([LOCATION_002])  
An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect is described as any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety  or any life -threatening problem or death caused by [CONTACT_1282] a 
device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementa ry 
plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device 
that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects (21 CFR 812.3(s)).  
5.1.5    Reportable Incident (Canada)  
According to the Canadian Medical Devices Regulations  (Sections 59 and 81), a reportable 
incident is any incident that:  
(a) is related to a failure of the device or a deterioration in its effectiveness, or any 
inadequacy in its labeling or in its the directions for use; and  
(b) has led to the death or a seri ous deterioration in the state of health of a patient, 
user or other person, or could do so were it to recur.

clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it 
Ortho -Space Ltd: CLD -OR-[ADDRESS_1110218] to follow -up, through the end of the study, or until it has been determined 
that the  study intervention or participation is not the cause (whichever timing occurs first). 
Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) that occurs until thirty (30) days after the study and is 
considered to be related to the study device or study participation should be r ecorded and 
reported immediately.  
5.[ADDRESS_1110219] be reported is defined as from the initiation of 
any study treatment or randomization through the end of the study intervention follow -up.  
5.3.2 Reporting Adverse Events  
Any AE (clinical sign, symptom, or disease) temporally associated with the use of this 
study device, whether or not considered related to the study device, shall be documented 
on the AE CRF, except those physical assessment finding s that are considered to be 
clinically insignificant.  
All AEs meeting the above noted criteria reported by [CONTACT_804415]. The description of the event (confirmed diagnosis, 
if available), date of o nset, date of resolution, severity and relationship to study device, 
action taken, outcome, and seriousness will be reported.  
The Investigator will evaluate all AEs as follows:  
• CTCAE Grade (Intensity) Assessment  
The guidelines outlined in CTCAE v4.03 will  be used for assessing the intensity of the 
event. The general guidelines for assessing the AE grade appear below.  Full guidelines 
may be obtained at http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE .

(ADL)*.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48622]; disabling; limiting self care ADL†.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequenc es; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE.‡  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, 
etc. 
†Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding se lf, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.  
‡Unlike the AE outcome assessment (see Section 13.3.2), a subject may have more than one Grade 5 event.  
-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), v4.03: June 14, 2010  
 
 
• Causality Assessment  
AEs will be assigned a relationship (causality) to the study treatment  or surgical 
procedure .  The Investigator will be responsible for determining the relationship 
between an AE and the study treatment /surgical procedure .  The type of event, 
organ system affected, and timing of onset of the event will be factors in assessing 
the likelihood that an AE is r elated to the study treatment /surgical procedure . 
Relationship of AEs to study treatment will be classified as follows:  
o Not Related : Any reacti on that does not follow a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the study device AND that is likely to have 
been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject.  
o Related : A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study device  or control surgical procedure  AND that 
follows a known response pattern to the suspected device /surgical 
procedure .

 The action taken in terms of tr eatment provided will be as either: none, medication 
administered, therapy administered, surgery, study treatment unblinded, or other (with a 
specification).  
• Outcome Assessment  
The outcome of the event will be assessed as either: resolved, resolved with se quelae, 
ongoing, lost to follow -up or death.  Only one AE per subject is allowed to have an 
outcome assessment as “death.”  If there are multiple causes of death for a given subject, 
only the primary cause of death will have an outcome of death.  
5.3.[ADDRESS_1110220] notify the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor, within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the event and send the completed Serious Adverse 
Event/Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (SAE/UADE ) Report to the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor within 48 hours. In addition, all IRB/REB reporting requirements will be 
followed.

report to the Sponsor‘s Medical Monitor and to the IRB/REB (as applicable) that has 
reviewed and continues to review the study.  
• Pre-exist ing Condition:  
A pre -existing condition, other than the condition being treated, is one that is 
present at the start of the study. A pre -existing condition is recorded as an AE if 
the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during t he 
study.  
• General Physical Assessment Findings:  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a 
preexisting condition. At the end of the study, any new clinically significant 
findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of a  SAE must be recorded and 
documented as a SAE.   
• Post-study Serious Adverse Event:

5.8.2 Risks of Study Device  
Anticipated study device -related risks are identified belo w: 
• Tissue response to the implant  
• Re-operation of the index shoulder   
• Device displacement from the sub -acromial space  
• Prolonged surgery time due to device breakage or malfunction  
5.8.3 Benefits of Study Device  
Potential benefits of the study device include:  
• Redu ction of shoulder pain 
• Improved quality of life  
• Ability to return to activities of daily life  following short rehabilitation.  
Ortho -Space Ltd: CLD -OR-[ADDRESS_1110228] (PI[INVESTIGATOR_15654] 2000).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization 
informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this 
study  
• Who will have access to that informat ion and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
Only authorized personnel, the Sponsor or its designee, and applicable regulatory bodies 
will have access to these c onfidential files. All data used in the analysis, reporting, and 
publication of this study will be maintained without identifiable reference to the subject.  
The HIPAA (Health Insurance Porta bility and Accountability Act) a uthorization adds to 
protections already provided by [CONTACT_804420] a separate document. The HIPAA document informs the subject that they 
can withdraw authorization to use data or samples not already submitted to the Sponsor or 
its designee and that the request must be in writing. If the subject allows samples to be 
used after withdrawal from the study, this permission may be withdrawn at a later date. 
The HIPAA authorization specifies who may review confidential medical information a nd 
to whom test results will be submitted. It also describes that test results obtained solely for 
research will not be part of a subject’s medical record.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorizat ion to collect or use PHI, the I nvestigator, by 
[CONTACT_804421], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of 
subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, 
attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the 
subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.

 6.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a study necessary for the reconstruction and evaluati on of the study. Source 
data are contained in source documents. Examples of source documents include, but are 
not limited to:  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, 
subject’s diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy d ispensing records, recorded data from 
automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_71975], subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, laboratories, and medico -
technical departments involved in t he study.  
The following data may be recorded directly in the CRF, which will then be considered as 
source data:  
• WORC  
• VAS  
• ASES  
• EQ-5D-5L 
• VAS  
• Imaging observations  
6.[ADDRESS_1110229]’s medical record. 
The CRF must be kept current to reflect subject status during the course of the study. Only 
a subject screening number will be used to identify the subject . The Investigator must keep 
a separate log of subject names and medical record numbers (or other personal identifiers). 
After obtaining written source document information from each subject at each visit, the 
study site will enter the data into the CRF (p aper or electronic). The monitor is responsible 
for performing on -site monitoring at regular intervals throughout the study to verify 
adherence to the protocol and applicable  regulations on the conduct of clinical research as 
well as to ensure completeness , accuracy, and consistency of the data entered in the CRF.  
At the study site, the monitor must have access to subject medical records, study -related 
records, and written source documentation needed to verify the entries on the CRFs. Final 
monitored and/o r audited CRFs will be available at all times, unless specified in writing to 
the Sponsor. These CRFs must be reviewed and verified for accuracy by [CONTACT_804422] -Space Ltd: CLD -OR-010

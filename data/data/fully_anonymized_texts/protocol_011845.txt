Primary Aim  
• What is the acceptability and feasibility of virtual instruction for home data collection using 
an A1c point of care device?  
 
Design and Methods  
• Observational Study  
• Parents enrolled in a home visiting program  (at least 18 years of age; English or Spanish 
speaking) were contact[CONTACT_81299].   Those that consented were sent AIc point of 
care device.  Research staff completed a virtual meeting with participants to use the A1c 
device.  Participants completed a short survey that included questions regarding their 
satisfaction with using the device.  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
Descriptive statistics were only applied to assess feasibility and accessibility .  
 
Backgrou nd and Significance  
Diabetes and cardiometabolic  disease  are increasing  in people  of child bearing age at alarming 
proportions . There is a  critical need to develop and test effective strategies  to mitigate  these 
disease s. However, ba rriers to in-person data collection limit opportunities for participation  in 
research that tests  lifestyle interventions, particularly for parents due to barriers such as time and 
transportation . With the recent widespread use of v irtual technology  (e.g., live 
video conferencing ) there is an opportunity to conduct research assessments virtually , potentially 
mitigating time and transportation constraints to participatio n.

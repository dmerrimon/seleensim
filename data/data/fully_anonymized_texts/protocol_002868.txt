1. OBJECTIVES 
 
 
1.1 Study Design 
 
This is a phase II study with a safety lead in of the combination of the recommended phase II 
doses of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD ) and pembrolizumab for the treatment of 
platinum resistant recurren t ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_877254].   
 
1.2 Primary Objectives 
    
1.2.1 To assess the clinical benefit (complete res ponse + partial response or stable disease > 24 
weeks) of the combination of PLD and pembrolizumab in patients with platinum resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.  Initially, a six patient sa fety lead in will be performed of these [ADDRESS_1225848] 6 patients has evidence of dose limiting toxicities, 
an additional 20 patients will be added to complete the phase II study.   
 
1.3 Secondary Objectives
 
 
1.3.1 To gain an estimate of toxicities for thes e agents when combined to treat platinum 
resistant recurrent ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_877255]   
 1.3.2 To gain an estimate of preliminary response rate for these agents when combined for the 
treatment of platinum resistan t ovarian cancer, progression free su rvival (PFS), overall survival 
(OS), time to progression (TTP),  and duration of response.   
 1.3.3 To perform exploratory tran slational studies on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor 
that include nanostring as well as PDL1  and exploratory immune markers.

BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 Study Disease:  Ovarian Cancer 
 
Ovarian cancer is a lethal cancer that affects women globally, is diagnosed at an advanced stage 
in most patients and has no effective screening tests for early detection (1-3).  The worldwide 
incidence of this cancer is 225,500 diagnoses  per year; in the [LOCATION_002] in 2015, 
approximately 21,980 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer (1, 2).  Global mortality of 
this cancer remains high with 140,[ADDRESS_1225849] decade (1, 
2).    Treatment strategies that have led to an overall survival (OS)  improvement for newly diagnosed 
patients have included the addition of paclitaxel to platinum, the use of intraperitoneal cisplatin in patients with optimally cytoreduced can cer (<1 cm of residua l cancer after upfront 
 DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-257  
 Protocol Version Date: August 29, 2018 
 
6 
 cytoreductive surgery), and incor poration of weekly paclitaxel vers us every 3 week paclitaxel as 
part of upfront treatment for ovarian cancer (4 -6).  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has emerged as a 
treatment alternative es pecially in patients who are unabl e to undergo upfront cytoreductive 
surgery because of the extent of cancer or those patients who are too ill or frail to undergo 
upfront cytoreductive surgery (7, 8).  Anti-angiogenics, specifical ly bevacizumab, were the first 
biologic to be tested in ovarian cancer but to da te addition of bevacizumab in randomized trials 
has demonstrated progression free survival (PFS)  benefit, but no OS benefit (9-11).    
 Unfortunately, most patients will recur after be ing diagnosed with advanc ed ovarian cancer; for 
patients with platinum-sensitive recurrence (defined as cancer recurring ≥[ADDRESS_1225850] 
platinum), additional platinum-based therapy is  given.  For patients with recurrent platinum 
resistant cancer (defined as can cer recurring <[ADDRESS_1225851] platinum), single agent 
chemotherapy is administered.  New agents a nd rationale combinati ons of biologics and 
chemotherapy are needed to improve outcomes in women with recurrent ovarian cancer, such as 
chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy agents.   The first [ADDRESS_1225852] approval 
in 2006 (carboplatin and gemcitabine for platinum  sensitive recurrence) were approved by [CONTACT_5212] (FDA) in 2014:  be vacizumab in combination with chemotherapy 
in patients with platinum resistant ovarian ca ncer and the oral PARP inhibitor olaparib for 
women with a g BRCA  mutation, recurrent ovaria n cancer and who have rece ived at least [ADDRESS_1225853] response rates 
that are 10% or less.  Pegylated liposomal doxorub icin (PLD) is a standard  of care treatment for 
recurrent ovarian cancer (12-14).    
2.2 Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (PLD) 
 
PLD is approved in the U.S., Canada, and Eu rope for use in ovarian cancer following 
progression of cancer after platinum-based chem otherapy and represents  a standard of care 
treatment for women with relapsed ovarian cancer (15).  PLD has demonstrated anti-cancer activity in both phase II and III studies; phase III studies have 
compared PLD to topotecan as well as other ag ents.  Response rates for platinum resistant 
recurrent ovarian cancer are appr oximately 10%.  Progression-free survival (PFS) for PLD in 
patients with recurrent ovarian cancer is approxima tely 3-4 months (12-14).  Known toxicities of 
PLD include:  hand-foot syndrome, mucos itis, cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression, liver 
impairment, and infusion-related reactions.  S ee the PLD Package Insert for other reported

 transformation has been known for decades.  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies.  In particul ar, the presence of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector 
T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long-term 
survival in many solid tumors. 
The PD-[ADDRESS_1225854] hijacked by [CONTACT_13207].  The normal function of PD-1, expre ssed on the cell surface of activated T-cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwan ted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions.  PD-1 (enc oded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily member related 
to CD28 and CTLA-4 which has been shown to  negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling 
upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD-L 2).  The structure of murine PD-1 has been 
resolved.  PD-1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig 
Variable-type (V-type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is 
responsible for the binding of si gnaling molecules.  The cytoplas mic tail of PD-1 contains 2 
tyrosine-based signaling motifs, an immunorecepto r tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and 
an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T-cell stimulation, PD-[ADDRESS_1225855] from that of CTLA-4 as both molecules 
regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_492834].  PD-1 was shown to be expressed on activated 
lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+  T-cells, B-cells, T regs and Natural Killer 
cells.  Expression has also been shown dur ing thymic development on CD4-CD8- (double 
negative) T-cells as well as subsets of macropha ges and dendritic cells.  The ligands for PD-1 
(PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constituti vely expressed or can be induced  in a variety of cell types, 
including non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors.  Both ligands are type I 
transmembrane receptors containing both IgV- an d IgC-like domains in the extracellular region 
and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no k nown signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD-[ADDRESS_1225856]  notably on vascular 
endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only det ectably expressed on antigen-presenting cells 
found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory  environments.  PD-L2 is thought to control 
immune T-cell activation in lymphoid organs, wh ereas PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T-
cell function in peripheral tissu es.  Although healthy organs expr ess little (if any) PD-L1, a 
variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T-cell inhibitor.  PD-1 
has been suggested to regulate tumor-specific T-cell expansion in participants with melanoma 
(MEL).  This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 path way plays a critical role in tumor immune 
evasion and should be consider ed as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. 
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly select ive humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block th e interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-
L1 and PD-L2.  KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in the [LOCATION_002] 
for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma  and disease progression 
following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_77972], if BRAF V600 mu tation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.

 2.4 Rationale 
 
2.4.1 Rationale for testing PLD and pembro lizimab in recurrent ovarian cancer 
 The rationale to combine the anti-PD1 monocl onal antibody pembrolizumab with chemotherapy 
to treat ovarian cancer in cludes the following;   
 1) PDL1 is overexpressed in ovarian cancer and PD1 is overexpressed in TILs. The presence of 
TILs in advanced stage ovarian carcinomas pred icts for a better overall outcome with improved 
PFS and OS compared to those cancers which lack TI Ls (1,2).  Increased frequency of Treg cells 
in patients with ovarian cancer can predict a poorer survival.   
 
2) Anti-cancer synergy has been demonstrated with anti-PD1 antibodies and chemotherapy (16-
18).   Several clinical trials are open using both chemotherapy and imm unotherapy agents.    
 3)  Reduction in tumor burden through chemothe rapy can potentiate an immune response, thus 
the rationale exists to combine a chemotherapy agen t such as PLD with a PD1 inhibitor (16-18).   
 2.4.2  Rationale for flat dose of pembrolizumab  An open-label Phase I trial (Proto col 001) is being conducted to eval uate the safety and clinical 
activity of single agent MK-3475.  The dose escalation portion of  this trial evaluated three dose 
levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in participants with advanced solid tumors.  All thr ee dose levels were well tolerate d and no dose-limiting toxicities 
were observed.  This first in human study of MK-3475 showed evidence of target engagement 
and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 
mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has been identified to date .  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose tested in 
PN001, will be the dose and schedule ut ilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test 
for initial tumor activity.  Recent data from ot her clinical studies within the MK-3475 program 
has shown that a lower dose of MK-3475 and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for 
target engagement and clinical activity.  PK data analysis of MK-3475 administered Q2 W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, 
limited volume of distribution, and a long half-lif e (refer to IB).  Pharmacodynamic data (IL-2 
release assay) suggest ed that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  This early PK 
and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing 
schedule.    A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been pe rformed using serum concentration time data 
from [ADDRESS_1225857]  a wide therapeutic range based on the 
melanoma indication.  The differences in exposur e for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 
2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based regimen are anticip ated to remain well w ithin the established

9 
 exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK-3475 in th e melanoma indication. The exposure margins 
are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5- fold higher dose and exposure). The population 
PK evaluation revealed that there was no signi ficant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In 
addition, exposure was similar between the NSCL C and melanoma indications. Therefore, there 
are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings. 
 The rationale for further explor ation of 2 mg/kg and comparable  doses of pembrolizumab in 
solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 
mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melano ma patients, 2) the flat exposure-response relationships of 
pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg 
Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burde n or indication on dist ribution behavior of 
pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_517942]) and 4) the assumption that the 
dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type. 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on 
simulations performed using the population PK m odel of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed 
dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those 
obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in 
the exposure range established in melanoma as a ssociated with maximal efficacy response and 3) 
will maintain individual patients exposure in th e exposure range established in melanoma that 
are well tolerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen simplifies the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to 
reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosin g scheme will also reduce complexity in the 
logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage. 
2.5 Correlative Studies Background
 
FFPE will be collected for exploratory immune  markers as tested by [CONTACT_246115] 
(IHC) staining of specific markers and PDL1 expression to be done at [COMPANY_006].      
 1)  Formalin fixed-paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumo r slices will be prepared and H&E stained for 
assessment of TIL in tumor samples. To  identify different immune cell populations 
(effector/memory/ CD8 cells, T re gulatory cells, dendri tic cells, tumor associated macrophages, 
NK cells, TEM) IHC staining will be performe d on FFPE tumor slices using the following 
antibodies:   CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, FoxP3, Indoleamine 2,3 deoxygenase-1 (IDO), CD11c, 
CD83, CD86, CD56, CD14, and CD16.   Also included will be recen tly developed IHC staining 
on FFPE samples for PD-L1, PD-L2, TIM-3 a nd LAG-3 through the center for Immuno-
oncology Pathology Core at the Dana-Farber Cancer  Institute (Scott Rodig, M.D., Ph.D. Core 
Director).    2)  PDL1 IHC staining at [COMPANY_006]:   [COMPANY_006] has asked that tumor sa mples also be sent to their 
facility for PDL1 staining using their tec hnique and staining.  Qual Tek has developed and 
validated a PD-L1 IHC assay using [COMPANY_006]'s propri etary 22C3 antibody.  This assay has served as 
the prototype companion diagnostic assay and has been used by [CONTACT_877293], including those for prospective enrollment in ot her clinical trials.  The PD-L1 
IHC assay has been validated and te sted in over 20 different tumor indications in various clinical

5.3 Agent Administration 
 
5.3.1 Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (PLD):  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Administration  
PLD is administered intravenously, and the first dose of PLD should be administered at a range 
of [ADDRESS_1225884] ration of the drug over one hour.  The infusion line 
should not be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_877257].   [IP_ADDRESS]  Dosing  
The dose used in this study will be 40 mg/m 2 IV once every 4 weeks.  The drug may be 
administered +3 days from the scheduled next infusion because of vacations, weather, holidays, 
etc.  The dose should be calculated using the wei ght and height on the day of infusion, and actual 
body weight should be used as per the package insert.    
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Drug, Tubing and Filtration 
PLD should not be used with in-line filters.  Pl ease see the PLD package insert for additional 
details, and PLD should be admini stered per the FDA package insert  and institutional policies.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hydration 
There is no required hydration. Any hydration will be determined  by [CONTACT_12707]. 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Special Equipment 
No special equipment is needed for PLD infusion.   [IP_ADDRESS]  Observation period 
There is no stated leng th of observation for PLD, and s hould be determined by [CONTACT_124133].

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Infusion Reactions 
Infusion reactions are described with PLD.  Th e PLD package insert and standard institutional 
policy should be followed for management of th ese reactions. Desensitization procedures are 
permitted in participants who e xperience an allergic reaction to PLD. Patients who have an 
allergic reaction to PLD are allowed to conti nue on the protocol after a discussion with the 
Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a consultation with allergy. A de sensitization procedure administers the total 
planned dose of PLD over a longer period of time under the guidance of the Investigator and 
Allergist. The duration of the infusion of PLD ma y vary with each patient’s specific symptoms.   
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Order of Administration 
If PLD and pembrolizumab infusions do occur on the same day, pembrolizumab should be given 
first, followed by [CONTACT_869686].    [IP_ADDRESS]  Caregiver Precautions 
There are no specific caregiver precautions.  Patients may develop, after PLD infusion, a 
reddish-orange color to their urin e and other body fluids.  This non-toxic reaction is due to the 
color of the PLD product and will dissi pate as the drug is eliminated.   
 
5.3.2 Pembrolizumab :
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Administration and Dosing  
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as  a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks. The 
drug may be administered +3 days from the scheduled next infusion because of vacations, 
weather, holidays, etc.   Sites s hould make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 
30 minutes as possible.  However, given the vari ability of infusion pumps from site to site, a 
window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitte d (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 
min).  [IP_ADDRESS] Drug, Tubing and Filtration No special IV tubing and/or  filtration are necessary.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Hydration There is no required hydration. Any hydration will be determined by [CONTACT_877296].    [IP_ADDRESS] Observation period Per package insert for pembrolizumab.    [IP_ADDRESS] Protocol specif ic procedures

 5.5 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines 
 
5.5.1 Concomitant Medications/Vaccina tions (allowed & prohibited)  
 
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohib ited in the exclusion cr iteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If  there is a clinical indication for on e of these or other medications or 
vaccinations specifically prohibited during the tr ial, discontinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required.  The investigator sh ould discuss any questions regarding this with 
the Overall Principal Investigator, who will then c ontact the [COMPANY_006] Clinical team as needed.  The 
final decision on any supportive therapy or v accination rests with the Overall Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the part icipant's primary physician.  
 5.5.2  Acceptable Concomitant Medications 
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a participant’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigat or in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_12983].  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) 
including all prescription, over-the -counter (OTC), herbal supple ments, and IV medications and 
fluids.  If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of  drug dosage, frequency, route, 
and date may also be included on the CRF. 
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_1225887] dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs and

Participants who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator, require th e use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical manage ment should be removed from the trial.   
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medica tions which are prohibited in this trial. 
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_110504]-Treatment Follow-up Phase. 
5.6 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Protocol Therapy 
 
Duration of therapy will depend on individual re sponse, evidence of disease progression and 
tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue 
until one of the following criteria applies:  
 Disease progression 
 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
 
 Unacceptable adverse event(s) 
 
 Participant decides to withdraw  from the protocol therapy 
 
 General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating investigator 
 
 Participant has completed 35 treatments (approximately 2 years) with 
pembrolizumab (Note: participant may continue on study receiving only PLD at 
the discretion of the treating investigator) 
  Participants will be removed from the protocol th erapy when any of these criteria apply.  The 
reason for removal from protocol therapy, and th e date the participant was removed, must be 
documented in the case report form (CRF). Altern ative care options will be discussed with the 
participant.  Regarding length of duration of treatment of PLD, i nvestigator should follow the FDA package 
insert for PLD.   Before participants continue on PLD for more th an [ADDRESS_1225889] confer

until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.   
5.8 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Study 
 
Participants will be removed from study wh en any of the following criteria apply: 
 Lost to follow-up 
 Withdrawal of consent for data submission 
 Death 
 The reason for taking a participant off study, and th e date the participant was removed, must be 
documented in the case report form (CRF).  For Centralized Subject Registra tions, the research team submits a completed Off Treatment/Off 
Study form to ODQ when a participant comes off study. This form can be found on the ODQ website or obtained from the ODQ registration staff. Other investigative s ites will inform the 
Project Manager as soon as a pa rticipant is taken off study. The Pr oject Manager will then make 
the relevant updates in OnCore.  For Decentralized Subject Registrations, the research team update s the relevant Off 
Treatment/Off Study information in OnCore.

should be documented in the patient's study record.  
6.3 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care 
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_1225898] guidance doc ument (Appendix B). Where appropr iate, these guidelines include 
the use of oral or intravenous  treatment with corticosteroid s as well as additional anti-
inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve w ith administration of corticosteroids.   Note 
that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the 
steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, atte mpts should be made to rule out other causes 
such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which mi ght require additional 
supportive care. The treatment guidelines are inte nded to be applied when the investigator 
determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.   Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator is instructed to follow the ECI reporting guidan ce but does not need to follow the treatment 
guidance (as outlined in the ECI guidance documen t). Refer to Section 6 for dose modification.  
 It may be necessary to perform conditional proc edures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the event. Suggested conditional procedures, as appropriate, 
can be found in the ECI guidance document. 
 
 Pneumonitis :  
 For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms 
improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued 
over no less than 4 weeks. 
 For Grade 3-4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  
Administer additional anti-infla mmatory measures, as needed. 
 Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportuni stic infections in the case of 
prolonged steroid administration. 
 
 Diarrhea/Colitis :  
Participants should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of 
enterocolitis (such as diarrh ea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or 
without fever) and of bowel perforation (s uch as peritoneal si gns and ileus).   
 
 All participants who experience diarrh ea/colitis should be advised to drink 
liberal quantities of clear fluids.  If  sufficient oral fl uid intake is not 
feasible, fluid and electrolytes should  be substituted vi a IV infusion.  For 
 DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-257  
 Protocol Version Date: August 29, 2018 
 
27 
 Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, consider  GI consultation and endoscopy to 
confirm or rule out colitis. 
 For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis  that persists greater than 3 days, administer 
oral corticosteroids.  
 For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis  that persists > 1 week, treat with 
intravenous steroids followed by [CONTACT_78018].   
 When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
  
 Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset,  including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) 
or ≥ Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or 
metabolic acidosis (DKA) 
 
 For T1DM  or Grade 3-4  Hyperglycemia 
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes 
mellitus and for Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or ketonuria.  
 Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine 
ketones, glycosylated he moglobin, and C-peptide.  
 
 Hypophysitis : 
 
 For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve 
to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper s hould be started and continued over no 
less than 4 weeks. Replacement of a ppropriate hormones may be required 
as the steroid dose is tapered. 
 For Grade 3-4  events, treat with an initial  dose of IV corticosteroids 
followed by [CONTACT_78019]. When  symptoms improve to Grade 1 or 
less, steroid taper should be star ted and continued over no less than 4 
weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the 
steroid dose is tapered. 
 
 Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism :  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time  during treatment. Monitor patients for 
changes in thyroid function (at the st art of treatment, periodically during 
treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and 
symptoms of thyroid disorders.  
o Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2-4  hypothyroidism): 
 In hyperthyroidism, non-selective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) 
are suggested as initial therapy. 
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone  replacement therapy, with 
levothyroxine or liothyr oinine, is indicated pe r standard of care. 
o Grade 3-4  hyperthyroidism  
 DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-257  
 Protocol Version Date: August 29, 2018

  Treat with an initial dose of IV  corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_79918]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 
weeks. Replacement of appropriate  hormones may be required as 
the steroid dose is tapered. 
 
 Hepatic : 
 For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until 
returned to baseline va lues (consider weekly). 
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids 
 For Grade 3-4  events, treat with intravenous  corticosteroids for 24 to 48 
hours.  
 When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroi d taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
 
 Renal Failure or Nephritis : 
 For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids. 
 For Grade 3-4  events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. 
 When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
Management of Infusion Reactions : Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly 
after drug infusion and generally resolve complete ly within 24 hours of completion of infusion.

7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of reported and/or  potential AEs (Section 7.1) a nd the characteristics of an 
observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine whet her the event requires expedited reporting in 
addition to routine reporting. For Events of Clinical Interests (ECIs) please see Appendix B 
for reporting guidelines to [COMPANY_006]. 
 
7.1. Expected Toxicities 
 7.1.[ADDRESS_1225899] common adverse reactions observed with DOXIL are asthenia, fatigue, fever, 
nausea, stomatitis, vomiting, diarrhea, constipati on, anorexia, hand-foot syndrome, rash and 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia.  Other more rare t oxicities include: 
1)  Cardiac toxicity:  Special at tention must be given to the ri sk of myocardial damage from 
cumulative doses of doxorubicin HCl. Acute left ventricular failure may occur with doxorubicin, 
particularly in patients who have received a total cumulative dosage of doxorubicin exceeding 
the currently recommended limit of 550 mg/m
2. Lower (400 mg/m 2) doses appear to cause heart 
failure in patients who have rece ived radiotherapy to the medias tinal area or concomitant therapy 
with other potentially cardiotoxic agents such  as cyclophosphamide.   Prior use of other 
anthracyclines or anthracenodione s should be included in calculations of total cumulative 
dosage. Congestive heart failure or cardiomyopat hy may be encountered af ter discontinuation of 
anthracycline therapy. Patients w ith a history of cardiovascular disease should be administered 
 DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-257  
 Protocol Version Date: August 29, [ADDRESS_1225900] the risk of myocardial injury. 
 2)  Infusion reactions:   Acute in fusion-related reactions were repor ted in 7.1% of patients treated 
with DOXIL in the randomized ovarian cancer st udy. These reactions were characterized by [CONTACT_877298]: flushing, shortness of breath, facial swelling, headache, 
chills, chest pain, back pain, tightness in the ches t and throat, fever, tach ycardia, pruritus, rash, 
cyanosis, syncope, bronchospasm, asthma, apnea, and hypotension.   In most patients, these reactions resolve over the course of several hours to a day once the 
infusion is terminated. Serious and sometimes life- threatening or fatal allergic/anaphylactoid-like 
infusion reactions have been repo rted. Medications to treat such reactions, as well as emergency 
equipment, should be available for immediate use.  The majority of infusion-related events occurred during the first infusion. Similar reactions have 
not been reported with conven tional doxorubicin and they presumab ly represent a reaction to the 
DOXIL liposomes or one of its surface components.   The initial rate of  infusion should be 1 
mg/min to help minimize the risk of infusion reactions.  3)  Radiation recall:  can rarely occur. 
 
4)  Fetal mortality:  Most of our patients will not be child-bearing and if they are, eligibility 
requirements require use of contraception.   7.1.2 Pembrolizumab :  
 
The most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients) include: Fatigue, cough, 
nausea, pruritus, rash, decreased appetite , constipation, arthra lgia, and diarrhea. 
 Immune-mediated adverse reac tions include the following: 
 Immune-mediated pneumonitis 
 Immune-mediated colitis 
 Immune-mediated hepatitis 
 Immune-mediated hypophysitis 
 Immune-mediated nephritis 
 Immune-mediated hyperthyr oidism and hypothyroidism 
 Embryofetal toxicity 
 
Other more rare t oxicities include: 
1)  Immune-mediated adverse reac tions occurred in less than 1%  of patients, and include the

 8. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION 
 
8.1 Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin 
 
8.1.1 Description 
 
Per the package insert:   PLD or DOXIL (doxorubicin HCl lipos ome injection) is doxorubicin 
hydrochloride (HCl) encapsulated in STEALTH ® liposomes for intravenous  administration (PLD 
package insert).  Doxorubicin is  an anthracycline topoisomera se inhibitor isolated from 
Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius .  Doxorubicin HCl, which is the established name [INVESTIGATOR_8178] 
(8S,10S)-10-[(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy- α-L-lyxo-hexopyranosyl) oxy]-8-glycolyl-7,8,9,10-
tetrahydro-6,8,11-trihydroxy-1-methoxy-5,12-napht hacenedione hydrochloride. The active 
ingredient of DOXIL is doxorubi cin HCl. The mechanism of action of doxorubicin HCl is 
thought to be related to its abil ity to bind DNA and inhibit nucleic acid synthesis. Cell structure 
studies have demonstrated rapid cell penetr ation and perinuclear chromatin binding, rapid 
inhibition of mitotic activity and nucleic acid synthesis, and inducti on of mutagenesis and 
chromosomal aberrations.  PLD is doxorubicin HCl encapsulated in long-circulating STEALTH
® liposomes.   Liposomes 
are microscopic vesicles composed of a phospholip id bilayer that are ca pable of encapsulating 
active drugs. The STEALTH ® liposomes of DOXIL are formulated with surface-bound 
methoxypolyethylene glycol (MPEG) , a process often referred to  as pegylation, to protect 
liposomes from detection by [CONTACT_877300] (MPS) and to increase blood 
circulation time.   STEALTH ® liposomes have a half-life of approximately [ADDRESS_1225906] 
90% of the drug (the assay used cannot quant ify less than 5-10% free doxorubicin) remains 
liposome-encapsulated during circulation. It is hypot hesized that because of their small size (ca. 
100 nm) and persistence in the ci rculation, the pegylated DOXIL lipos omes are able to penetrate 
the altered and often compromi sed vasculature of tumors.  
 
8.1.2 Form 
PLD is a sterile, translucent, red liposomal disp ersion for IV administration. PLD is supplied at a 
concentration of 2 mg/mL in 10-mL or 30-mL si ngle-use vials. PLD doses up to [ADDRESS_1225907] be 
diluted in 250 mL of 5% dextro se injection, USP, prior to in fusion. PLD doses exceeding [ADDRESS_1225908] be diluted in 500 mL of 5% dextrose inje ction, USP, prior to infusion. Diluted PLD should 
be refrigerated at 2°Cto 8°C (36°Fto 46°F). Each  vial and carton will contain a label, either 
single-panel or booklet , affixed to the vial or carton. PLD sh ould not be administered using an 
in-line filter. 
 8.1.3 Storage and Stability 
PLD should be stored as per In stitutional pharmacy guidelines and the FDA package insert for 
PLD.  Per the package insert, unopened vials of  PLD should be refrigerated between 2 and 8 
degrees C and should not be frozen.   
 8.1.4 Compatibility 
There are no known compatib ility effects between PLD and pembolizumab.

 8.1.5 Handling 
Qualified personnel, familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to themselves and 
the environment, should undertake the preparat ion, handling, and safe disposal of the 
chemotherapeutic agent in a self-con tained and protective environment.  
 
8.1.6 Availability 
PLD is available per Institutional pharmacy guide lines since this is an FDA-approved agent for 
recurrent ovarian cancer.   
 8.1.7 Preparation 
PLD should be prepared as per Institutional pharmacy guidelines and the FDA package insert for 
PLD.   
 8.1.8 Administration 
PLD should be administered as per Institutional pharmacy guidelines and the FDA package 
insert for PLD.  PLD should not be administered  as an IV push or bolus. Infusion reactions may

infusion. Each vial contains 100 mg of pembro lizumab in 4 mL of solution. Each 1 mL of 
solution contains 25 mg of pembrolizumab a nd is formulated in: L-histidine (1.55 mg), 
polysorbate 80 (0.2 mg), sucrose (70 mg), and Water for Injection, USP. 
 
8.2.3 Compatibility  
There are no known compatib ility effects between PLD and pembolizumab.   
 
8.2.4 Handling 
Qualified personnel, familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to themselves and 
the environment, should undertake the preparat ion, handling, and safe disposal of the 
chemotherapeutic agent in a self-con tained and protective environment.  
 Store vials under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36° F to 46°F) and should be protected from light.  
Note: vials should be stored in the original box to  ensure the drug product is  protected from light.  
The vials should not be shaken.   MK-3475 infusion solutions should be prepared  in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, 
USP (normal saline) and the final concentration of MK-3475 in the infusi on solutions should be 
between 1.0 mg/mL and 10.0 mg/mL. If rounding is  necessary, round up to one decimal place.   
Availability  Pembrolizumab w ill be provided by [CONTACT_877301].       Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) solutions may be stor ed at room temperature for a cumulative time 
of up to [ADDRESS_1225911] solution in vials,  room temperature storage of 
admixture solutions in the IV bags and the dur ation of infusion. (Please note this [ADDRESS_1225912] stopper is pi[INVESTIGATOR_877263].) 
 In addition, reconstituted vials and/or IV bags may be stored  under refrigeration at 2 °C to 8 °C 
(36 °F to 46 °F), total cumulative storage time at room temperature and refrigeration should not 
exceed 24 hours. If refrigerated, allow the vials and/or IV bags to come to room temperature

 8.2.5 Administration 
Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) infusions should be admi nistered in 30 minutes, with a window of -5 
and +10 minutes, using an infusion pump. A centr al catheter is not re quired for infusion; 
however if a participant has a cen tral venous catheter in place, it is recommended that it be used 
for the infusion.  The following infusion set materials are compatible with MK-3475: 
 PVC Infusion set that is plasticized using DEHP 
 PVC and tri-(2-ethylhexyl) trimellitate (TOTM) infusion set 
 Polyethylene lined PVC infusion set 
 PVC Infusion set that is plasticized us ing Di-2-ethylhexyl Terephthalate (DEHT) 
 Polyurethane set 
 
* Contact [CONTACT_877302].  
 A sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding 0.2 to 5 μm in-line filter made of polyethersulfone 
(PES) must be used during administration to rem ove any adventitious par ticles. If the infusion 
set does not contain a 0.2 to 5 μm in-line filter, it is recommended to use a 0.2 to 5 μm add-on 
filter which may contain an extension line (the mate rials of the extension line and filter should be 
as mentioned above).  Attach the infusion line to the pump and prime th e line, either with normal saline (at least 25 
mL) or with infusion solution as per local SOP,  before starting the infusion.  Infuse MK-3475 
over approximately 30 minutes wi th a window of -5 and +10 mi nutes, through a peripheral line 
or indwelling catheter.  Maximum rate of infusion should not exceed 6.7 mL/min. through a 
peripheral line or indwel ling catheter. Use 30 mL normal saline to flush the infusion line at the 
end of infusion. If institutional guidelines to no t allow the flushing of the infusion line at the 
completion of the infusion, the specific volume of  drug/diluent solution should be prepared that 
is required to make up for the volume of the dosing solution lost in the infusion line.

burden or even the appearance of new lesions. Patients with in itial PD will be allowed to stay on trial with a repeat scan 
in [ADDRESS_1225921] – Solid Tumors 
 
For the purposes of this study, par ticipants should be re-evaluated  for response every 8 weeks (± 
1 week).    Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_453672] (R ECIST) guideline (version 1.1) 
[Eur J Ca  45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest di ameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the 
RECIST criteria.  
11.1.1  Definitions 
 
 Evaluable for Target Disease response.  Only those participants who have 
measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of 
therapy, and have had their disease re-eva luated will be considered evaluable for 
target disease response.  These participants will have  their response classified 
according to the definitions stated below.   (Note:  Participants who exhibit 
objective disease progression pr ior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered 
evaluable.) 
 
 Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response.  Participants who have lesions present 
at baseline that are evaluable but do not  meet the definitions of measurable 
disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-
evaluated will be considered evaluable for non-target disease.  The response 
assessment is based on the presence, abse nce, or unequivocal progression of the 
lesions.  
 DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-257  
 Protocol Version Date: August 29, 2018 
 
40 
  
11.1.2  Disease Parameters 
 
 Measurable disease.  Measurable lesi ons are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimens ion (longest diameter to be recorded) as 
≥ [ADDRESS_1225922] x-ray or ≥[ADDRESS_1225923] be  recorded in millimeters (or decimal 
fractions of centimeters). 
 
 Malignant lymph nodes.  To be cons idered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_1225924] 
scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At 
baseline and in follow-up, only the shor t axis will be measured and followed. 
 
 Non-measurable disease.  A ll other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 
mm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all considered non-measurable. 
 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the crite ria for radiographically defined simple 
cysts should not be considered as mali gnant lesions (neither measurable nor non-
measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the de finition of measurability described above. 
However, if non-cystic lesions are presen t in the same participant, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions. 
 
 Target lesions.  All measurable lesion s up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
and 5 lesions in total, repr esentative of all involved or gans, should be identified as 
target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (les ions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but  in addition should be those that lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated m easurements. It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend it self to reproducible measurement in 
which circumstance the next largest lesi on which can be measured reproducibly 
should be selected. A sum of the diamet ers (longest for non-nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesi ons will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes ar e to be included in the sum, then only 
the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as 
reference to further characterize any object ive tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
 
 Non-target lesions.  All other lesion s (or sites of disease) including any 
 DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-257  
 Protocol Version Date: August 29, 2018 
 
41 
 measurable lesions over and above the 5 ta rget lesions should be identified as 
non-target lesions  and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of 
these lesions are not requir ed, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases 
unequivocal progression of each s hould be noted throughout follow up.  
  
11.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers, 
or a digital measurement tool.  All baseline ev aluations should be performed as closely as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and ne ver more than 4 weeks before the beginning 
of the treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at ba seline and during follow-up. Imaging-based 
evaluation is preferre d to evaluation by [CONTACT_453674](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
 Clinical lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be cons idered measurable when they 
are superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm in 
diameter as assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin 
lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_164943], including a ruler to estimate the 
size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
 Chest x-ray.   Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when 
they are clearly defined and surround ed by [CONTACT_6776]; however, CT is 
preferable.  
 
 Conventional CT and MRI. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on 
CT scan based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or less. If CT scans 
have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion 
should be twice the slice th ickness. MRI is also accepta ble in certain situations 
(e.g. for body scans).   
 
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MR I has excellent contrast, spatial, and 
temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables 
involved in MRI, which greatly impact  image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and 
measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with 
CT, if an MRI is performed, the tec hnical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for th e evaluation of the type and site of 
disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the le sions should be measured/assessed on the 
same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to 
prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence pa rameters for all scanners, body parts, 
and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of  scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as  closely as possible to prior scans.  
 DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-257  
 Protocol Version Date: August 29, 2018 
 
42 
 Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if 
possible. 
 
 FDG-PET. While FDG-PET response asse ssments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporat e the use of FDG-PET scanning to 
complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' 
disease).  New lesions on the basis of  FDG-PET imaging can be identified 
according to the following algorithm:  
o Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a 
sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
o No FDG-PET at baseline and a positiv e FDG-PET at follow-up:  If the 
positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is tr uly progression occurring at that site 
(if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET 
scan).  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not pr ogressing on the basis of the anatomic 
images, this is not PD. 
o FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar 
to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarri ng.  The use of FDG-PET in this 
circumstance should be prospectivel y described in the protocol and 
supported by [CONTACT_4623]-specific medical  literature for the indication.  
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false 
positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
 
 PET-CT. At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a 
combined PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with 
RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of id entical diagnostic qual ity to a diagnostic 
CT (with IV and oral contrast), then th e CT portion of the PET-CT can be used 
for RECIST measurements and can be us ed interchangeably with conventional 
CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions  over time.  Note, however, that the 
PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator 
if it is not routinely or  serially performed.   
 
 Tumor markers. Tumor markers alone ca nnot be used to assess response. If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
participant to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for 
both CA-125 response (in recurrent ov arian cancer) and PSA response (in 
recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [ JNCI  96:487-488, 2004; J Clin 
 DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-257  
 Protocol Version Date: August 29, 2018 
 
43 
 Oncol  17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148-1159, 2008].  In addition, the 
Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has deve loped CA-[ADDRESS_1225925]-line trials in 
ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534-1535, 2000]. 
 
 Cytology, Histology. These techniques can be used to differentiate between 
partial responses (PR) and complete  responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual 
lesions in tumor types, such as germ  cell tumors, where known residual benign 
tumors can remain). 
 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplas tic origin of any effusion that appears 
or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for 
response or stable disease is mandatory to  differentiate between response or stable 
disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the tr eatment) and progressive 
disease. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
 Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of  all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target)  must have reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm. 
 
 Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% d ecrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as refere nce the baseline sum diameters. 
 
 Progressive Disease (PD):  At  least a 20% increase in th e sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference th e smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on st udy).  In addition to the relative increase 
of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
(Note:  the appearance of one or mo re new lesions is also considered 
progressions). 
 
Immunotherapeutic agents such as pemb rolizumab may produce antitumor effects 
by [CONTACT_134981]-specifi c immune responses. The response 
patterns seen with such an approach ma y extend beyond the typi[INVESTIGATOR_877265] c agents and can manifest a clinical response after an 
initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions.  
 Patients with initial PD will be allowed to  stay on trial with a repeat scan in 4 
weeks. If repeat imaging confirms PD , patients will be discontinued from study 
therapy. 
 
 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient sh rinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while 
on study. 
 
 DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-257  
 Protocol Version Date: August 29, 2018 
 
44 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 
 Complete Response (CR):  Disappear ance of all non-targ et lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological 
in size (<10 mm short axis). 
 
 Note:  If tumor markers ar e initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be consider ed in complete clinical response. 
 
 Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or  more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
 
 Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump target lesion st atus.  It must be representative of 
overall disease status change, not  a single lesion increase.     
 Although a clear progre ssion of “non-target” lesions onl y is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_182580] d prevail in such circumstances, and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal 
Investigator). 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of New Lesions 
 The finding of a new lesion should be unequi vocal (i.e. not due to difference in 
scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something 
other than tumor (for exampl e, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or 
flare of pre-existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow-up scan in an 
anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will 
indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal  (because of small size etc.), follow-up 
evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirmed, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion 
was discovered.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 The best overall response is th e best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

 ‘Non-CR/non-PD’ is preferred over ‘stable dise ase’ for non-target disease since SD is 
increasingly used as an endpoint for assessmen t of efficacy in some trials so to assign 
this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised 
 
11.1.4  Duration of Response 
 
 Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or pr ogressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, or death due to  any cause. Participants without events 
reported are censored at the last disease evaluation). 
 
 DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-257  
 Protocol Version Date: August 29, 2018 
 
46 
  Duration of overall complete response: The duration of overall CR is measured 
from the time measurement criteria are fi rst met for CR until the first date that 
progressive disease is objectively do cumented, or death due to any cause. 
Participants without events reported ar e censored at the last  disease evaluation.
  
 Duration of stable disease:  Stable dis ease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since th e treatment started, including the baseline 
measurements.  
 
11.1.5  Progression-Free Survival, Overall Survival and Time to Progression: 
 
 Overall Survival: Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization 
(or registration) to death due to any cause,  or censored at date last known alive. 
 
 Progression-Free Survival: Prog ression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time 
from randomization (or registration) to th e earlier of progression or death due to 
any cause. Participants aliv e without disease progression are censored at date of 
last disease evaluation. 
 
 Time to Progression: Time to Progre ssion (TTP) is defined as the time from 
randomization (or registration) to progressi on, or censored at date of last disease 
evaluation for those wit hout progression reported.

 The Overall PI/Coordinating Center is re sponsible for distributing all IND Action 
Letters or Safety Reports to all particip ating institutions fo r submission to their 
individual IRBs for action as required. 
 
 Mechanisms will be in place to ensure qua lity assurance, protocol compliance, 
and adverse event reporting at each site. 
 
 Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order the 
study agent(s) directly from supplier.  A pa rticipating site may order the agent(s) 
only after the initial IRB approval for the site has been forwarded to the Coordinating Center. 
 
 
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
This is a non-randomized single-arm phase II stu dy designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) and pe mbrolizumab for the treatment of platinum 
resistant recurrent ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_877266]. A six patient safety lead will be 
performed of these [ADDRESS_1225928] 6 patients develop a DLT, the dose of PLD will be reduced to 30 mg/m2. If no more than [ADDRESS_1225929] 6 patients has evidence of dose limiting toxicities, the dose level will be considered th e maximum tolerated dose (MTD), an additional 20 
patients will be enrolled to complete the phase II study.

Primary efficacy endpoint: 
• Clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + SD ≥ 24 weeks) 
 Secondary endpoints include: 
 Toxicity by [CONTACT_30828] 4.0 
 Objective response by [CONTACT_393] 1.1.  
 Progression-free survival 
 Overall survival 
 Time to progression 
 Duration of response  
 
Patients who withdraw study consent before r eceiving any study treatment will be replaced. 
Patients who are receive study treatment, but who go off-treatment or off-study in cycle [ADDRESS_1225930] ive response and prolongment of progression –free 
intervals are enhanced when chemotherapy a nd immune checkpoint bloc kade inhibitors are 
combined, the primary endpoint of this study is clini cal benefit rate, using an  interval of at least 
24 weeks of stable disease.  Pujade-Lauraine et al reported a 12% objective response rate in 
control arm to the AURELIA of single-agent chemotherapy for platinum-resistant ovarian 
cancer; the probability of being progression-free at 6 months was approximately 20%.    Therefore, a true clinical benefit rate of 25% or less would not be of clinical interest, and is the 
null hypothesis to a binomial test for a single-stage A’Hern design.   A true clinical benefit rate 
of 50% would be considered a c linically meaningful level of response. Sample size was chosen 
to have high power ( ≥90%) to declare the combination effectiv e at this rate, while controlling the 
one-sided Type I error at no more than  10% under the null (exact alpha = 0.091)

response as well as estimates of PFS and OS at landmark time points.  
 All secondary endpoints will be reporte d with 95% confidence intervals. 
 
14. PUBLICATION PLAN

Based on the literature review [1-11], and considerati on of mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, potential 
immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are the primary Ev ent of Clinical Interest (ECI). Immune-related AEs 
are adverse events associated with the treatment of patie nts with immunotherapy treatments that appear to be 
associated with the immune therapy’ s mechanism of action. Based on these potential irAEs, the sponsor has 
defined a list of specific adverse event terms (ECIs) that are selected adverse experiences that must be 
reported to [COMPANY_006] within 24 hours to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 
[PHONE_1840]) from the time the Investigator/physician is awar e of such an occurrence, regardless of whether 
or not the investigator/physician considers the event to  be related to study drug( s). In addition, these ECIs 
require additional detailed information to be collected  and entered in the stud y database. ECIs may be 
identified through spontaneous patient report and / or upon review of subject data. Table [ADDRESS_1225937] is not comprehensive for all potential immune-related 
events, it is possible that AEs other than those listed in this document may be observed in patients receiving 
pembrolizumab. Therefore any  Grade  3  or  higher  event  that  the  investigator/physician considers  to  be 
immune-related should be reported as an ECI regardless of whether the specific event term is in Table 1 and 
reported to [COMPANY_006] within 24 hours to [COMPANY_006] Glob al Safety (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 
993-1220) from the time the Investigator/physician is aware of such an occurrence. Adverse events that are 
both an SAE and an ECI should be reported one time as an SAE only, however the event must be 
appropriately identified as an ECI as well in in the database.

Version 5.0 8 
  
Each of the events above is descr ibed within this guidance document, along with site requirements for 
reporting these events to the Sponsor.  The information collected should be entered into the narrative field(s) 
of the Adverse Event module in the database (please note, if narrative entry into the database is not available, 
please use the narrative text box on the 1727/AER Form).   If additional Medical History or Concomitant 
Medications are reported, the Medical History and C oncomitant Medication modules in the database must be 
updated. 
 
In addition, the guidelines include recommendations on the management of these ECIs. These guidelines are 
intended to be applied when the physic ian determines the events to be rela ted to pembrolizumab. Note: if after 
the evaluation the event is determined not to be related,  the physician is instructed  to follow the ECI reporting 
guidance but does not need to follow the treatment gui dance (below). Therefore, these recommendations 
should be seen as guidelines and the treating physician should exercise individual clinical judgment based on 
the patient.  For any question of dose modification or other treatment options, the specific language in the 
protocol should be followed.  Any questions pertaining to the collection of this information or management of 
ECIs should be directed to your local Sponsor contact. 
 
Dose Modification/Discontinuation  
 
The treatment guidance provides specific direction when  to hold and/or discontinue pembrolizumab for each 
immune related adverse event.  Of note, when the guid ance states to “discontinue” pembrolizumab this is the 
permanent discontinuation of treatment with pemb rolizumab. “Hold” means to stop treating with 
pembrolizumab but resumption of treatment may be considered assuming the patient meets the criteria for resumption of treatment. 
 
 
2. ECI REPORTING GUIDELINES  
ECIs are selected non-serious and serious adver se experiences that must be reported to [COMPANY_006]  within 24 hours 
regardless of attribution to study treatment.  The AEs lis ted in this document and any event that meets the ECI 
criteria (as noted) in Table 1 or in the respective protoc ol (event term and Grade) must be reported regardless 
of physician-determined causality w ith study medication and whether or not  considered immune-related by [CONTACT_24201] (unless otherwise specified).   Physicians/stu dy coordinators/designated s ite personnel are required 
to record these experiences as ECIs on the Adverse Experience electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) (or on 
paper) and to provide supplemental information (s uch as medical history, concomitant medications, 
investigations, etc.) about the event. 
 
–    Please refer to the Data Entry Guidelin es (DEGs) for your pr otocol (Section 12.1). 
–    Please refer to protocol for details on reporting timelines and repo rting of Overdose and Drug Induced 
Liver Injury (DILI) (Section 7.0).  
 
3. ECI CATEGORIES AND TERMS  
This section describes the ECI  categories and  outlin es subject management guidelines when an  ECI  is 
reported.
Pembrolizu mab Event of Clinical Interest Gui dance Docu ment
Final 18-Dec-2014 
Version 5.0 9 
  
 
3.1 Pneumonitis  
  
The following AE terms, if considered ≥ Grade 2, are considered ECIs and should be reported to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of the event: 
 
–    Pneumonitis 
–    Interstitial lung disease 
–    Acute interstitial pneumonitis 
 
If symptoms indicate possible new or worsening cardiac abnormalities additional testing and/or a cardiology 
consultation should be considered. 
 
All attempts should be made to rule out other causes su ch as metastatic disease, bacterial or viral infection .  It 
is important that patients with a suspected diagnosis of pneumonitis be managed as per the guidance 
below until treatment-related pneumonitis is excluded. Treatment of both a potential infectious etiology 
and pneumonitis in parallel may be warranted. Man agement of the treatment of suspected pneumonitis 
with steroid treatment should not be delayed for a therapeutic trial of antibiotics.   If an alternative 
diagnosis is established, the patient does not require  management as below; however the AE should be 
reported regardless of etiology. 
 
Course of Action  
 
Grade 2 events: 
–    Report as ECI –    Hold pembrolizumab. –    Consider pulmonary consultati on with bronchoscopy and biopsy/BAL. 
–    Consider ID consult 
–    Conduct an in person evaluation approximately twice per week 
–    Consider frequent Chest X-ray as part of monitoring 
– Treat with systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent.  When 
symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 
weeks. 
– Permanently discontinue for inability to reduce cortic osteroid dose to 10 mg or less of prednisone or 
equivalent per day within 12 weeks. 
– Second epi[INVESTIGATOR_55517] – discontinue pe mbrolizumab if upon re-challenge the patient 
develops 
a second epi[INVESTIGATOR_119988] 2 or higher pneumonitis. 
 
Grade 3 and 4 events: 
–    Report as ECI 
–    Discontinue pembrolizumab. 
–    Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28068] –    Bronchoscopy with biopsy and/or BAL is recommended. – Immediately  treat  with  intravenous  steroids  (methylprednisolone 125  mg  IV).  When  symptoms

Introduction  
 
Here we describe the collection  of sectioned  slides from tumor samples for the purpose of 
immunohistochemical  (IHC) analysis. Sectioned  slides from formalin‐fixed, paraffin‐embedded  
(FFPE) samples will be stained for the biomarker(s)  of interest, and then evaluated  by a 
pathologist  for review of biomarker  staining expression  levels. 
 
Protocol Requirements   
 
1. For patient samples, the provided positively  charged ProbeOn Plus slides (Fisher 
ProbeOn Plus Catalog Number 22‐230‐900) are strongly recommended  for tissue 
sections. If a sample has existing sections already cut, slide measurements  should be 
75mm x 25mm x 1mm (other slide sizes may not be able to be accommodated  ‐ please 
contact [CONTACT_877305]).  
 
2. Tumor tissue for biomarker  analysis should be provided as five (5) unstained  slides cut 
from an FFPE tissue block. Three (3) sectioned  slides per sample are necessary  for H&E, 
PD‐L1, and isotype control staining. The 4th and 5th sections are for a repeat staining if 
needed.  
a. Existing H&E slides may be provided along with 2 unstained  slides if less tissue is 
available (assumes  H&E stained section is fairly close to section level of 
unstained  slides sent for analysis). A PD‐L1 and isotype control stain will be 
performed.  Isotype control will only be run if first section staining for PD‐L1 is 
successful  otherwise  a second attempt will be made for PD‐L1 staining. 
b. If no H&E is available and only 2 unstained  sections are sent, then an H&E and a 
PD‐L1 stain will be performed.   
3. If additional  markers beyond PD‐L1 are requested  to be tested as per the service 
contract established  between QualTek and the Investigator  Site, 2 additional  sections 
per marker are the minimum  to allow staining for the additional  marker and the isotype 
control, however 4 sections will allow for repeat staining if needed. 
4. Samples may be held as blocks indefinitely  at the site and then cut in batches. Slides 
should be shipped to QualTek as immediately  as possible after sectioning.   
5. As per [COMPANY_006] protocol requirements,  sectioned  slides should be shipped cold (2‐8°C) 
and in the dark using the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_877275] 8‐9. Be advised 
that slides received that do not meet these conditions  may affect PD‐L1 staining. 
6. Sectioned  slides provided should contain tumor specimen  sufficient  for pathology  
review and analysis of the tumor sample. If available,  greater than 50% tumor content is 
 
[ADDRESS_1225963] five viable, PD‐L1‐
staining neoplastic  cells are necessary  to be scored by [CONTACT_877306].  
 
7. Non‐acceptable  sample types for IHC analysis include brushing,  bone metastases,  lavage 
specimen,  frozen sample, plastic embedded  sample, or formalin fixed sample that was 
frozen at any point.  
 
8. Needle core biopsies or endo‐bronchial  ultrasound  (EBUS) preps that are formalin‐fixed 
and paraffin‐embedded  are acceptable.  Fine‐needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]  (FNA) or cell pellet from 
pleural effusion samples that are formalin‐fixed and paraffin‐embedded  will be 
accepted for testing with the following  caveats: 
 
a. The PD‐L1 IHC assay is not validated  for FNA or cell pellet from pleural effusion 
samples. However,  on a research basis QualTek has successfully  PD‐L1 stained 
FNA samples. 
b. The scoring parameter  for assessing  stromal interface (presence/  absence) will 
not be provided for FNAs or cell pellets from pleural effusion due to the nature 
of the sample. 
 
 
57 Sectioning  of Tissue onto ProbeOn Plus Slides from Formalin‐Fixed, Paraffin‐
Embedded  (FFPE) Block(s)  
1. Prepare freshly‐cut serial sections at 4 micron thickness  onto the provided Fisher 
ProbeOn Plus Slides, Cat Number 22‐230‐900. Sections must be placed on the 
painted/textured  side of the slide. 
 No adhesives  should be used in the water bath since the slides are positively ‐
charged.  
2. Ensure that the sample has the institutional  block ID clearly marked on 
each slide as well as the slide section levels, if possible. 
 Ensure that the block ID is referenced  on the manifest 
 Note that the sample must be labeled with 2 patient identifiers  
(Refer to the label provided for the slide holder)  
3. When placing the sections onto the slides, ensure that the tissue is 
towards the bottom third of the slide as pi[INVESTIGATOR_877276]. 
 Ensure tissue sections are oriented the same direction on all slides. 
 No adhesive labels directly on slides. Slide / patient identifiers  must be hand 
written with indelible / chemical proof ink. 
 Number the slides sequentially  (serially), one section per slide. 
4. DO NOT OVEN DRY SLIDES. Air dry until completely  dry (12‐24 hours). 
5. Complete  an electronic  Sample Manifest for each shipment  (Excel Spreadsheet  provided 
by [CONTACT_877307]).  
 Email the completed  electronic  manifest prior to shipment  to:

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Multi- Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
(DF/HCC DSMP) outlines the procedures for conducting a DF/HCC Mu lti-Center research 
protocol. The DF/HCC DSMP serves as a refe rence for any sites external to DF/HCC that 
are participating in a DF/HCC clinical trial. 
 
1.1 Purpose 
 
To establish standards that will ensure that  a Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Multi-
Center protocol will comply with Federal Regulations, Health Insu rance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements and applicable DF/HCC Standard Operating 
Procedures .        
 
1.2 Multi-Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan Definitions 
 
DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol :  A research protocol in which one  or more outside 
institutions are collaborating with Dana-Farbe r/Harvard Cancer Center where  a DF/HCC 
investigator is the sponsor. DF /HCC includes Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care (DF/PCC) 
Network Clinical Trial Affiliates.  
 Lead Institution:  One of the  Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center consortium members 
(Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BCH), Brigham 
and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BWH) responsible  for the coordination, development, 
submission, and approval of a protocol as we ll as its subsequent amendments per the 
DFCI IRB and applicable regulatory guide lines (CTEP, Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA), Office of Biotechnology Activities (OBA) et c.).  The Lead Institution is typi[INVESTIGATOR_345892]/HCC Sponsor. The Lead In stitution also typi[INVESTIGATOR_403441] /HCC Multi-Center Protocol.   
 DF/HCC Sponsor:  The person sponsoring the submitted Multi-Center protocol who 
takes responsibility for initia tion, management and conduct of the protocol at all research 
locations. In applicable protocols, the DF/H CC Sponsor will serve as  the single liaison 
with any regulatory agencies (i.e. FDA, etc.). The DF/HCC Sponsor has ultimate authority over the protocol and is responsible for the conduct of the study at DF/HCC and all 
Participating Institutions. In most cases the DF/HCC Sponsor is the same person as the 
DF/HCC Overall Principal Investigator; however , both roles can be filled by [CONTACT_163915].  
 
Participating Institution:  An institution that is outside the DF/HCC and DF/PCC 
consortium that is collabor ating with DF/HCC on a protoc ol where the sponsor is a 
DF/HCC Investigator.  The Participating Institution ac knowledges the DF/HCC Sponsor 
as having the ultimate authorit y and responsibility for the overa ll conduct of the study.    
Coordinating Center: The entity (i.e. Lead Institution, Medical Monitor, Contract 
Research Organization (CRO), etc) that provides administra tive support to the DF/HCC 
Sponsor in order that he/she may fulfill th e responsibilities outlined in the protocol 
 
66 document and DSMP, and as specified in app licable regulatory gui delines (i.e. CTEP 
Multi-Center Guidelines). In general, the L ead Institution is the Coordinating Center for 
the DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol.  
 
DF/HCC Office of Data Quality (ODQ): A group within DF/HCC responsible ensuring 
high-quality standards are used for data collection and the ongoing management of clinical trials, auditing, and data and safety monito ring. ODQ also coordinate s quality assurance 
efforts related to multi-center clinical research.  DF/HCC Clinical Trials Research Informatics Office (CTRIO):  A group within 
DF/HCC responsible for providing a compre hensive data management platform for 
managing clinical trial data.

3. DF/HCC REQUIREMENTS FOR MULTI-CENTER PROTOCOLS 
The following section will clarify DF/HCC Require ments and further detail the expectations 
for participating in a DF/HCC Multi-Center protocol.  
 
3.1 Protocol Distribution 
 
The Coordinating Center will distribute the final DFCI IR B approved protocol and any 
subsequent amended protocols to al l Participating Institutions.    
 
3.2 Protocol Revisions and Closures 
 
The Participating Institutions will receive not ification of protocol revisions and closures 
from the Coordinating Center.  It is the individual Participa ting Institution’s responsibility 
to notify its IRB of these revisions. 
 
 Non life-threatening revisions:  Participating Institutions will receive written 
notification of protocol re visions regarding non life-th reatening events from the 
Coordinating Center. Non-life-threaten ing protocol revisions must be IRB 
approved and implemented within 90 days from receipt of the notification. 
 
 Revisions for life-threatening causes:  Participating Institu tions will receive 
immediate notification from the Coordinati ng Center concerning protocol revisions 
required to protect lives w ith follow-up by [CONTACT_6791], mail, e-mail, etc.  Life-threatening 
protocol revisions will be implemente d immediately followed by [CONTACT_57947]. 
 
 Protocol closures and temporary holds:  Participating Institutions will receive 
notification of protocol closures and temporary hol ds from the Coordinating 
Center. Closures and holds  will be effective imme diately.  In addition, the 
 
69 Coordinating Center, will update the Par ticipating Institutions on an ongoing basis 
about protocol accrual data so that they will be aw are of imminent protocol 
closures. 
 
3.3 Informed Consent Requirements 
 
The DF/HCC approved informed consent doc ument will serve as a template for the 
informed consent for Participating Institutions. The Participating Institution consent form must follow the consent template as closely as  possible and should adhe re to specifications 
outlined in the DF/HCC Guidance Document on Model Consent Language for PI-Initiated 
Multi-Center Protocols.  This document will be  provided separately to each Participating 
Institution upon request.  Participating Institutions are to send their version of the informed consent document and HIPAA authorization, if a separate document , to the Coordinating Center for review and 
approval prior to submission to their local I RB. The approved consent form must also be 
submitted to the Coordinating Center after approval by [CONTACT_57948].  The Principal Investigator (PI)  at each Participating Instit ution will iden tify the physician 
members of the study team who will be obtai ning consent and signing the consent form 
for therapeutic protocols. Participating inst itutions must follow the DF/HCC requirement 
that only attending physicians obtain in formed consent and re-consent for all 
interventional drug, biologic,  or device research.   
 
3.[ADDRESS_1225969] be on file with the Coordinating Center: 
 Initial approval letter of the Participating Institution's IRB.  
 Copy of the Informed Consent Form(s) approved by [CONTACT_57949]’s 
IRB.  
 Participating Institution’s I RB approval for all amendments. 
 Annual approval letters by [CONTACT_403480]'s IRB. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_1225970] ( HIPPA). Any 
 
70 information, related to the physical or mental health of an individua l is called Protected 
Health Information (PHI). HIPAA outlines how and under what circumstances PHI can be 
used or disclosed.  
 In order for covered entities to use or disclo se protected health in formation during the 
course of a study, the study participant must sign an authorization statement.  This 
authorization statement may or may not be separate from the informed consent document.  
The Coordinating Center, with the approval fr om the DFCI IRB, will provide a consent 
template, with information regarding authorizat ion for the disclosure of protected health 
information.   The DF/HCC Sponsor will use all efforts to limit its use of protected health information in 
its trials. However, because of the nature of these trials, certain protected health 
information must be collected. DF/HCC has c hosen to use authorizations, signed by [CONTACT_163917], rather than lim ited data sets with data use agreements. 
 
3.6.1  DF/HCC Multi-Center Prot ocol Confidentiality 
 
All documents, investigative reports, or inform ation relating to the participant are strictly 
confidential. Whenever reasona bly feasible, any participant specific reports (i.e. Pathology 
Reports, MRI Reports, Operative Reports, et c.) submitted to the Coordinating Center 
should be de-identified. It is recommended that the assigne d protocol case number (as 
described below) be used for all participant specific documents. Participant initials may be included or retained for cross verification of identification.  
 
3.7 DF/HCC Multi-Center Protoc ol Registration Policy 
 
3.7.[ADDRESS_1225971] be registered with the DF /HCC CTMS before the initiation of treatment 
or other protocol-specific interventions. Treatment a nd other protocol-specific 
interventions may not be initiated until the Pa rticipating Institution receives confirmation 
of the participant’s registration from the Coordinating Center. The DF/HCC Sponsor and 
DFCI IRB must be notified of a ny violations to this policy. 
 
3.7.3  Eligibility Exceptions 
 
No exceptions to the eligibility requirements  for a protocol wit hout DFCI IRB approval 
will be permitted. All Participating Institutions  are required to fully comply with this 
requirement. The process for requesting an eligibility exception is defined below. 
 
3.8 DF/HCC Protocol Case Number 
 
At the time of registration, the following identifiers are required  for all subjec ts: initials, 
date of birth, gender, race and ethnicity. Once  eligibility has been established and the 
 
[ADDRESS_1225972].   
 
3.8.1 Protocol Deviations, Exceptions and Violations 
 
Federal Regulations require an IRB to review proposed change s in a research activity to 
ensure that researchers do not initiate cha nges in approved research without IRB review 
and approval, except when necessary to el iminate apparent immediate hazards to the 
participant. DF/HCC requires all departures fr om the defined procedures set forth in the 
IRB approved protocol to be reported to the DF/HCC Sponsor, who in turn is responsible 
for reporting to the DFCI IRB.   For reporting purposes, DF/HCC uses the terms “violation”, “deviation” and “exception” 
to describe departures from a protocol. All Participating Inst itutions must adhere to these 
requirements for reporting to the DF/HCC Sp onsor and will follow their institutional 
policy for reporting to their local IRB. 
 
3.8.2  Definitions 
 
Protocol Deviation: Any departure from th e defined procedures set forth in the IRB-
approved protocol which is prospectively approved  prior to its implementation. 
 Protocol Exception:  Any protoc ol deviation that relates to the eligibility criteria, e.g. 
enrollment of a participant who does not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
   
Protocol Violation: Any prot ocol departure that was not prospectively approved  by [CONTACT_221855].   
 
3.8.3  Reporting Procedures 
 
DF/HCC Sponsor: is responsible for ensuring that clear docume ntation is available in the 
medical record and/or regulatory documents to describe all protocol exceptions, deviations 
and violations. The DF/HCC Sponsor will al so be responsible fo r ensuring that all 
protocol violations/deviati ons are promptly reported per DFCI IRB guidelines.  
 Participating Institutions: Protocol deviations  require prospective approval from the DFCI 
IRB. The Participating Institution must subm it the deviation request to the Coordinating 
Center who will then submit the deviation request to the DFCI IRB. Upon DFCI IRB 
approval the deviation is submitted to the Par ticipating Institution IRB, per institutional 
policy. A copy of the Participating Institut ion’s IRB report and determination will be 
forwarded to the Coordinating Center with in [ADDRESS_1225973] be sent to the Coordinating Ce nter in a timely manner. The 
Coordinating Center will provide training for the requirements for the reporting of violations.  
 
72  
Coordinating Center:  Upon receipt of the viol ation/deviation report fr om the Participating 
Institution, the Coordinating Center will s ubmit the report to the DF/HCC Sponsor for 
review. Subsequently, the Participating Institu tion’s IRB violation/deviation report will be 
submitted to the DFCI IRB for review per DFCI IRB reporting guidelines. DF/HCC will 
forward all violation reports to CTEP via an  internal DF/HCC process, as applicable. 
 
3.9 Safety Assessments and Toxicity Monitoring 
 
The study teams at all particip ating institutions ar e responsible for protecting the safety, 
rights and well-being of study par ticipants. Recording and repor ting of adverse events that 
occur during the course of a study help ensure the continuing safety of study participants.  
 All participants receiving investigational ag ents and/or other prot ocol mandated therapy 
will be evaluated for safety. The safety parameters include all laboratory tests and hematological abnormalities, physical examin ation findings, and spont aneous reports of 
adverse events reported by [CONTACT_4317].  A ll toxicities encountered during the study will 
be evaluated according to the NCI criteria sp ecified in the protocol. Life-threatening 
toxicities must be reported immediately to the DF/HCC Sponsor via the Coordinating 
Center.  
 
Additional safety assessments and toxicity monitoring will be outlined in the protocol. 
 
3.9.1 Guidelines for Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
 
Guidelines for reporting Adverse Events (A Es) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are 
detailed in protocol section [ADDRESS_1225974] report the SAEs to the DF/HCC Sponsor and the 
Coordinating Center following the DF CI IRB Adverse Even t Reporting Policy.  
 
The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of all Participating Institution Adverse Event reports and be responsible  for communicating to all participating 
investigators, any observations reportable under the DFCI IRB Repor ting Requirements.  
Participating Institutions will review and submit to their IRB according to their institutional policies and procedures 
 
 
3.9.2 Guidelines for Processing IND Safety Reports  
 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all IND Safety  Reports and ensure that all IND Safety 
Reports are distributed to the Participating Institutions. Participating Institutions will 
review/submit to their IRB according to their institutional policies and procedures.   
  
 
73 3.10 Data Management 
DF/HCC CTRIO develops case report forms ( CRF/eCRFs), for use w ith the protocol.  
These forms are designed to collect data for each study. DF/HCC CTRIO provides a web 
based training for all eCRF users. 
   
3.10.1  Data Forms Review 
 
Data submissions are monitored for timelin ess and completeness of submission. If study 
forms are received with missing or questionable data, the submitting institution will receive a written or electr onic query from the DF/HCC Office of Data Quality, 
Coordinating Center , or designee.  
 Responses to all queries should be complete d and submitted within 14 calendar days.   
 Responses may be returned on the written query  or on an amended paper case report form, 
or in the case of electronic queries, within the electronic data capture (eDC) system. In the 
case of a written query for data submitted on a paper case report form, the query must be attached to the specific data be ing re-submitted in response.   
 If study forms are not submitted on schedule, the Participating Institution will periodically 
receive a Missing Form Report from the Coor dinating Center noting the missing forms.  
 
4. REQUISITIONING INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG 
  
The ordering of investigational agent is  specified in the protocol section 8. 
 
Participating Institutions should order their ow n agent regardless of the supplier. (i.e., NCI 
or a pharmaceutical company.)   If the agent is commercially available, check with the local Director of Pharmacy and/or 
the Research Pharmacy to ensure that the ag ent is in stock. If the agent is not stocked, 
ensure that the agent can be ordered once th e protocol is approve d by [CONTACT_1036].  
 If the agent is investigational, ensure that th e pharmacy will be able to receive and store the 
agent according to state and federal requirement s. The local IRB should be kept informed 
of who will supply the agent (i.e., NCI or  a pharmaceutical company) so that any 
regulatory responsibilities can be met in a timely fashion.  
 
5. MONITORING: QUALITY CONTROL 
 
The quality control process for a clinical trial requires verification of protocol compliance and data accuracy. The Coordi nating Center, with the aid of the DF/HCC Office of Data 
Quality, provides quality contro l oversight for the protocol. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1225975] to 
on-site monitoring conducted by [CONTACT_5081].  
 The Coordinating Center will implement ongoi ng monitoring activities to ensure that 
Participating Institutions are complying with regulatory and protocol requirements, data quality, and participant safety. At a minimum,  the DF/HCC Lead Institute, or designee, 
will monitor each participating site twice a ye ar while patients are receiving treatment. 
Should a Participating Institution be monitore d once and then not accrue any additional 
patients or participant visits, then a s econd monitoring visit may not be necessary. 
Additional monitoring practices  may include but are not lim ited to; source verification, 
review and analysis of the following: eligibil ity requirements of all participants, informed 
consent procedures, adverse events a nd all associated doc umentation, study drug 
administration/treatment, regulatory files, prot ocol departures, pharmacy records, response 
assessments, and data management. 
 
Participating institutions will be required to participate in Coordinating Center initiated 
teleconferences, as scheduled. Th e Coordinating Center will ke ep in close touch with the 
Participating Institutions via email and phone . Source documents from Participating 
Institutions, will be collect ed at specific data points th at support the primary and or 
secondary endpoints.  
 On-Site Monitoring: On-site monitoring will occur on an  as-needed basis. Participating 
Institutions will be required to  provide access to participants’ complete medical record and 
source documents for source documentation ve rification during the on-site visit. In 
addition, upon request from a monitor or audito r, Participating Institutions should provide 
access to regulatory documents, pharmacy records,  local policies related to the conduct of 
research, and any other trial-re lated documentation maintained by [CONTACT_16529]. If 
there are concerns for protocol compliance, issues that impact subject safety or the 
integrity of the study are found, or trends id entified based on areas of need, additional 
monitoring visits may be scheduled. On site monitoring visits can be supplemented with 
virtual monitoring assessments, provided th at the minimum monitoring frequencies are 
adhered to.  Remote Monitoring: The Coordinating Center will request source documentation from 
Participating Institutions as needed to co mplete monitoring activities. Participating 
Institutions will be asked to forward de-ident ified copi[INVESTIGATOR_57912]’ medical record 
and source documents to the Coordinating Center to aid in source documentation 
verification.  
 
5.2 Monitoring Reports 
 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review  all monitoring reports to ensure protocol compliance. 
The DF/HCC Sponsor may increas e the monitoring activities at Participating Institutions 
that are unable to comply with the protocol , DF/HCC Sponsor requirements or federal and 
local regulations.  
 
 
75 5.3 Accrual Monitoring 
 
Prior to extending a protocol to an external  site, the DF/HCC Sponsor will establish 
accrual requirements for each participating inst itution. Accrual will be monitored for each 
participating institution by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Sponsor  or designee. Sites that are not meeting 
their accrual expectations may be subject to termination. 
 
6. AUDITING: QUALITY ASSURANCE 
 
Auditing is a method of Quality Assurance an d involves the systematic and independent 
examination of all trial related activities a nd documents.  Audits determine if evaluated 
activities were appropriately conducted and whether data was generated, recorded and 
analyzed, and accurately repor ted per the protocol, applicable Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs), and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). 
 
 
6.1 DF/HCC Internal Audits 
  
 All Participating Institutions are subject to  audit by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Offi ce of Data Quality 
(ODQ). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], approximately 3-[ADDRESS_1225976] participant safety or the integrity of the study are found, 
more participant records may be audited.  
 
6.2 Audit Notifications 
 
It is the Participating Institution’s responsibil ity to notify the Coordinating Center of all 
scheduled audit dates (interna l or NCI) and re-audit dates (if applicable), which involve 
this protocol. All institutions will forward a c opy of final audit and/ or re-audit reports and 
corrective action plans (if applicable) to th e Coordinating Center, within 12 weeks after 
the audit date.  
 
6.3 Audit Reports  
 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review  all final audit reports and corrective action plans, if 
applicable. The Coordinating Center, must forward any reports to  the DF/HCC ODQ per 
DF/HCC policy for review by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Audit Committee. For unacceptable audits, the DF/HCC Audit Committee would forward the fina l audit report and co rrective action plan 
to the DFCI IRB as applicable. 
 
6.4 Participating Institution Performance 
 
The DF/HCC Sponsor and DFCI IRB is charge d with considering th e totality of an 
institution’s performance in considering institutional participation in the protocol.

Institutional  Conflict of Interest Information  Sheet 
A Phase II Study of Pembrolizumab  combined  with pegylated  liposomal  doxorubicin  (PLD) for 
recurrent  platinum  resistant ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_877290] #16‐257 
 
You are invited to take part in a clinical trial, a type of research study.  This research study is studying a 
targeted therapy as a possible treatment  for this diagnosis.   [COMPANY_006] is supporting  this research study by 
[CONTACT_877309], Pembrolizumab.   You are receiving this Information  Sheet because Dana‐
Farber Cancer Institute has a financial interest in Pembrolizumab,  which may be affected by [CONTACT_877310].  This is known as a potential “institutional  conflict of interest.”   
 
Pembrolizumab  is considered  an investigational  drug in this research,  which means that the intervention  
is being studied and has not been approved  for your type of cancer by [CONTACT_268747] (U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration).  It is possible that, as the result of this clinical trial and other clinical trials involving this 
drug that may follow, this investigational  drug could be approved  by [CONTACT_268747], and become widely 
available for sale. Specifically,  the drug being investigated  involves a technology  that was discovered  
through research conducted  at DFCI.  As a result, a concern exists that DFCI could be biased because it 
stands to benefit financially  from the outcome of clinical trials involving this drug.   
Dana‐Farber Cancer Institute (“DFCI”) is committed  to ensuring that all of its research and clinical 
activities are conducted  with integrity.  As part of this commitment,  DFCI fully discloses the existence  of 
all actual or potential conflicts of interest to research participants,  sponsors,  and regulatory  bodies. Also, 
we have made sure that appropriate  steps have been taken to ensure the safety of research participants  
and the reliability  of research results.   
First, DFCI will disclose the existence  and nature of its financial interest to all research participants.  
Second, DFCI will disclose the existence  and nature of its financial interest to all research collaborators  
and in all public presentations  and publications  of data related to this research.  
Finally, and most importantly,  we want to be certain that all research participants  are fully informed  
about the financial interest, and are able to consider this information  in deciding whether to participate  
in this trial. To that end, if you have additional  questions  about DFCI’s financial interests and their 
potential impact upon this clinical trial, or any of the steps taken by [CONTACT_877311],  please contact:

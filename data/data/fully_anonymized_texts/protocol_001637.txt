Amendment 9 , dated January 9,  2020  
DOC -0000876, Rev 11    2 BACKGROUND  
End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) has become a major public health problem and is associated with 
considerable co -morbidity and mortality.  Currently, routine hemodialysis is the most prevalent treatment 
for ESRD and it is typi[INVESTIGATOR_890870] a dialysis outpatient facility.[ADDRESS_1247193] patients, providers and 
caregiv ers.  
In recent years a significant body of evidence has emerged establishing the clinical, social and economic 
benefits of more frequent dialysis.2,3,4,5,6 Frequent dialysis is challenging in a clinic -based delivery model 
due to a variety of reasons (e.g. travel three times/week), which has led to a growing interest within the 
dialysis community to shift hemodialysis therapy to persons’ homes.  In -Home treatment allows for more 
frequent dialysis sessions, which more closely mimics the natural function  of the kidneys.  
Additionally, home hemodialysis (HHD) also offers numerous medical advantages over conventional In -
Center hemodialysis.  Studies have demonstrated improved blood pressure control, reductions in use of 
hypertension medication7 and improvem ents in left ventricular function.[ADDRESS_1247194] met by [CONTACT_35710].  
A continuum of renal replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_890871] s to better home 
hemodialysis technologies are in development, but many of the technologies are unproven or will take 
many years to mature. The Outset philosophy has been to couple the proven mechanisms of today’s In -
Center hemodialysis with targeted techn ology innovation that will bring the benefits of frequent 
hemodialysis to more patients.

To evaluate the Tablo  Hemodialysis System when used In -Center by [CONTACT_890886] -Home by 
[CONTACT_890887] . 
3.1 Device and Study Rationale  
The Tablo™ Hemodialysis System  (System ) makes hemodialysis more accessible to ESRD Subject s through 
meaningful improvements in usabi lity.   
4 DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The Tablo ™ Hemodialysis System is a self -contained hemodialysis system (Hemodialysis  System or 
System), intended for acute and chronic d ialysis therapy with or without ultrafiltration , in an acute or 
chronic care facility . The System is modular in design and contains two components: 1) the Tablo ™ 
Console (Console), a single module consisting of multiple fluidic systems that perform the activities of a 
Water Purification System (WPS) and a conventional Dialysis Delivery Sys tem (DDS), and 2) the Tablo ™ 
Cartridge (Cartridge), consisting of a single -use blood tubing set attached to an Or ganizer. A disposable 
Cartridge is inserted onto the front panel of the Console  for each dialysis treatment . 
 
4.1 Tablo ™ Hemodialysis System Overvi ew 
Incoming water is pretreated in the  Sediment and Carbon Filtration subsystem  a. This pre -treated water 
then passes through the Reverse Osmosis (RO) system where polyamide thin -film composite membranes 
purify the incoming  water. This process reduces the levels of chemical and microbial contaminants, 
producing water for dialysis meeting AAMI/ANSI/ISO [ZIP_CODE] limits. After cycling through the WPS, the 
purified water enters the Dialysis Delivery System.  
 
The Dialysis Delivery S ystem de -aerates the treated water, then proportions and mixes in acid and 
bicarbonate concentrates. The resulting dialysate fluid passes through an ultrafilter  to assure the dialysate 
meets the AAMI/ANSI/ISO [ADDRESS_1247198] -treatment heat disinfection, a chemical disinfection cycle is performed periodically. 
During this cycle, a peracetic acid type of disinfectant (e.g. Peracidin) disinfects the fluid path. After the 
chemical disinfection, the fluid path is rinsed until no detectable residual peracetic acid is present (as

Study# 2014 -01 
Amendment 9 , dated January 9,  2020  
DOC -0000876, Rev 11    determined by [CONTACT_890888]). After rinsing the chemical disinfectant, another heat 
disinfection cycle is performed as previously described.  The complete disinfection cycle concludes when 
the Console shuts down and any remaining water cools. Prior to the ne xt treatment, the user is prompted 
by [CONTACT_890889] a water test to ensure no residual disinfectant remains.  
 
4.3 Proposed Indications For Use  
The Tablo ™ System is indicated for use in patients with acute and/or chronic renal failure, with or w ithout 
ultrafiltration , in an acute or chronic care facility .  Treatments must be administered under physician's 
prescription, with a trained individual available as needed who is considered competent in the use of the 
device by [CONTACT_87982]. The Tablo ™ System is also indicated for use in the home.   
4.[ADDRESS_1247199] s connected directly to the Tablo ™ Hemodialysis Console  will capture  individual treatment 
details.   Treatment data capture d will include , but is not limited to,  prescription details, blood pressure 
readings, heparin infusion data (from the heparin pump ), changes to treatment parameters, total fluid 
removed during treatment, and alarms and errors.  This data may also be collect ed via wireless 
capabilities.  
Note : If a heparin bolus is prescribed for the S ubject to be administered prior to the initiation  of 
treatment, the dosage amount will not be saved to the USB drive and will need to be manually recorded 
in the Subject ’s medical record and transcribed to the case report form.  
4.4.2 Device Set -up 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Initial Device Set -up 
The Tablo Console  must be connected to an incoming water source, an outgoing drain line, and an 
electrical outlet.  Additional in structions on the Console  set-up can be found in the User Manual .

If an initial heparin bolus is prescribed for treatment with the Tablo ™ Hemodialysis System, then a heparin 
dose will be manually delivered to the Subject  with a syringe prior to commencement of treatment.  
Heparin dosing during dialysis treatment may be delivered manually or automatically using the heparin 
pump .   Heparin therapy during dialysis treatment will be prescribed according to institutional practices 
and at the discretion of the Investigator .  To optimize therapy, it is suggested that Subjects receive a 
heparin bolus of 30 units/kg at the start of treatment, followed by 15 units/kg hourly.  For arterial, 
venous, fistula or graft Subjects  heparin administration should be discontinued 30 min utes  before the end 
of treatment.

DOC -0000876, Rev 11    [IP_ADDRESS]  System Interfaces  
The user  will interact with multiple system interfaces when using the  Tablo ™ Console .  All interfaces 
described are through the Tablo touchscreen.  A summary of each interface is described below:  
1. Pre-Treatment Mode  (Set-Up) - The user interface employs a checklist approach to guide users 
through the sequence of steps in “pre -treatment mode”, including (1) connection of the 
concentrate containers, Tablo™ Cartridge , dialyzer, saline, and heparin , (2) verification of the 
Subject  prescription settings, (3) Subject  pre-treatment vitals, (4) system priming, (5) water 
chlorine test, and (6) Subject  vascular access.  Preparation for treatment via this mode can be 
accessed in the user interface via the Home Screen “Get Started” button.  
2. Treatment Mode  (During Dialysis) - Treatment mode covers the dialysis therapy process from 
initial blood flow from the Subject  to the extracorporeal circuit through to final blood return to 
the Subject  after treatment completion.  The user interface employ s a single main treatment 
progress screen which monitors blood pressure and pulse measurements, saline bolus delivery, 
fluid removal (ultrafiltration) and blood pump cessation, and changes to treatment settings.  
Additionally, the main treatment screen tra cks treatment time.  A secondary user interface 
screen monitors additional treatment information like arterial and venous pressure readings and 
a log of blood pressure and pulse readings.  The treatment mode user interface also includes 
confirmation screen s for delivering a saline bolus, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_890872], and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_890873].  Additionally, the user interface guides the user to save changes to treatment settings and 
to replace a saline bag . 
3. Post -Treatment Mode  - The user interface also employs  a checklist approach to guide users 
through the sequence of steps in “post -treatment mode”, including (1) disconnection of the 
Subject  blood lines, (2) access site closure, (3) Subject  post -treatment vitals, and (4) 
disconnection and disposal of the conce ntrate containers, Tablo Cartridge , dialyzer, saline, and 
heparin from the Tablo ™ Console .  The Tablo ™ Console  can be programmed to automatically 
begin a heat disinfect ion cycle.  
4. Maintenance Mode  - The user interface employs a checklist approach to guide users through the 
sequence of steps for periodic maintenance activities, including (1) heat disinfection, (2) chemical 
disinfection with a water test, (3) carbon filter replacement, (4) sediment filter replacement, and 
(5) ultrafilter replacement.  T he user interface is designed to automatically remind users when a 
maintenance activity is required.  Additionally, the maintenance functions can be accessed in the 
user interface via the Home Screen “Maintenance” button.  
5 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
5.1 Evaluation of Efficacy   
The primary effectiveness endpoint is the delivery of a standardized weekly Kt/V of greater than or equal 
to 2.1.  The standardized weekly Kt/V value will be computed by [CONTACT_890891]/recorded by [CONTACT_890892] s (CRFs). 
This analysis will be based on the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population (section 11.1.1 ) with a supportive 
analysis for the Per -Protocol (PP) population (section 11.1.2 ).

3. Blood Loss :  blood loss resulting in hemodynamic compromise that leads to death, 
transfusion or fluid resuscitation with greater than 1 liter of crystalloid IV fluids.  
4. Hemolytic Reaction :  hemolytic reaction s due to disinfectant exposure, dialysate 
temperature, mechanical failure or other device related causes.  
5. Infection : any infection related to catheter, its tunnel or exit site, AV fistula, or AV graft.  
6. Intra -Dialysis Event : a significant clinical event such as loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, 
or seizure caused by [CONTACT_890884].  
7. Vascular Access Complication : defined as AVF or AVG clotting during the dialysis procedure, 
bleeding for more than [ADDRESS_1247236] -dialysis for 3 consecutive sessions, difficulty with 
vascular access resulting in inability to initiate or complete dialysis treatments or 
complications related to hemodialysis catheters  (not including reduced blood flow in 
catheter or TPA  or catheter exchange).  
8. Pyrogenic Reaction : onset of objective chills (visible rigors) and fever (oral temperature 
greater than or equal to 37.5 degrees Celsius) in a Subject who was afebrile and who had no 
recorded signs or symptoms of infection before treatment.  
9.2 Recording Advers e Events  
9.2.1 Adverse Event Categorization  
Reported Adverse Events will be categorized into one of the following two categories:  
1. Primary Safety Endpoint :  This category includes the 8 pre-specified  adverse events that will be 
analyzed as the Primary Safety Endpoint for the study.  
2. Other Adverse Events : This category includes all reported adverse even ts that meet the definition 
in Section 9. 
The proposed categorization will serve to focus reporting, adjudicating, and analysis efforts to those 
categories most relevant for demonstrating the investigational device’s relevant safety profile.  
It is th e intention of the Sponsor  that AE’s be collected in a uniform manner over the course of the study 
(independent of study arm) through the use of a Subject questionnaire.  The Subject will be asked to 
complete a questionnaire regarding signs and symptoms ex perienced during each treatment.  During 
regularly scheduled clinical follow -up visits during the trial, study staff will review the signs and symptoms 
noted by [CONTACT_890905] , as needed,  on how they are documented .  The study staff 
will determine whether subject reported signs and symptoms meet the definition of an AE as specified in 
Section 9.  This approach attempts to eliminate  any potential observed differences in AE rates between 
the study arms that are solely due to reporting sources or techniques.  
Prior to analysis, all adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA). Based on these coded terms, treatment emergent AEs will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_25991], by [CONTACT_926], relation to procedure and relation to device.

Study# [ADDRESS_1247237] treatment during Treatment period 1 with the Tablo ™ Hemodialysis System , any 
new event/experience that was not present at baseline, or worsening of an event present at baseline, is 
considered an adverse event.  Recorded Adverse Events will include, but are not limited to:  
• infections (other than those defined in the Primary Sa fety Endpoint),  
• hypotension,  
Note:  Unchanged, chronic conditions are not adverse events and should not be recorded on the adverse 
event page of the CRF.   
Note:   Laboratory values that are abnormal will not be considered as adverse events unless medical 
intervention is required.  Clinical laboratory data will be monitored and values  that are outside of the 
normal ranges will be separately summarized by [CONTACT_890906] (In -Center and In -
Home).   During the In -Center treatment period, summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, 
range, n) on laboratory values collected will be computed on the raw data.   During the In -Home treatment 
period, summary statistics (mean, standard deviation , median, range, n) on laboratory values collected 
will be computed on the raw data.   Individual tables will be created for each laboratory panel and 
quantitative parameter combination.   In addition, a summary table will be created for each laboratory 
pane l (hematology and chemistry) to display the number and percentage of subjects who have results 
that fall out of the normal ranges for each laboratory parameter by [CONTACT_890907]  [ADDRESS_1247238]’s last study treatment the medical care plan for the Subject 
will be described  and documented . 
9.2.3 Determination of the Relationship  
Determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational device caused or 
contributed to an AE is to be determined by [CONTACT_890908], 
related or unknown.  Determination should be based on  assessment of temporal relationships, biologic 
plausibility, association (or lack of association) with underlying disease, and presence (or absence) of a 
more -likely cause.  
Definitions for determination of the relationship include:  
Not Related:   Exposure to the investigational device  has not occurred, or the occurrence of the adverse 
event is not reasonably related in time, or the adverse event is considered unlikely to be related to the 
use of the investigational device (biologically implausibl e). 
Related:   Exposure to the investigational device  and the adverse event are reasonably related in time and 
the investigational device  is more likely than other causes to be responsible for the adverse event, or is 
the most likely cause of the adverse ev ent.

If any adv erse event is considered related to the use of the investigational device , that event will be 
followed until resolution or until the Investigator  determines the event to be chronic or stable.  
9.2.4 Determination of Adverse Events (Clinical Events Committee, CEC ) 
In order to ensure that events reported as AEs meet clinically recognized and accepted standards and are 
reported in a uniform manner across sites, AEs that have been assessed by [CONTACT_1377] 
[INVESTIGATOR_890875], severe in nature, and /or meets the definition of one the primary safety endpoint 
events, will be reviewed and adjudicated by a CEC.  Adjudication of reported adverse events will be 
performed by a multi -physician panel.  Adjudication will be done against the standard of whether  a 
reasonable attending nephrologist would attribute the AE to one of the causes listed as part of the 
Primary Safety Endpoint above.  In the case of disagreement by [CONTACT_562277], determination will 
be made by [CONTACT_184472].  The CEC also will co nfirm those reported events indicated as such, do indeed 
meet the Safety Endpoint criteria.  In addition, the CEC will periodically review all AEs, including those that 
are not included as a primary endpoint, to assess overall study safety.

11 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
The Statistical Anal ysis Plan (SAP) for the s tudy will describe the data sets to be analyzed, the methods of 
analysis, and the specific analyses to be conducted in support of the study’s primary e ndpoints.   Those key 
elements are outlined below.  
11.[ADDRESS_1247243] treatment period  will be conside red enrolled and will be included in the Intent -to-Treat 
Population (ITT). The primary effectiveness endpoint analysis will be based on the ITT population with a 
supportive analysis for the Per -Protocol population (PP).    
11.1.1  Intent to Treat Population (ITT)  
The ITT population will consist of all Subject s who are enrolled in the study.   The primary analysis set will 
be the ITT analysis set with no missing value imputation with a sensitivity analysis performed on the ITT 
with missing value imputation population.    
11.1.2  Per Protocol Population (PP)  
The PP population will consist of all Subject s who are enrolled in the study, have successfully completed at 
least 75% of their dialysis treatments, have at least one valid value of the primary effectiveness variable 
and have no major protocol deviations while enrolled in the study.  A successfully completed dialysis 
treatment is defined as one completed as prescribed by  [CONTACT_099].   A major protocol deviation is 
defined as any protocol deviation that affects  the soundness of the data or a Subject ’s rights .  Subject s to 
be excluded from the PP analysis set , and the reasons for their exclusion , will be determined and 
documented prior to statistical analysis.  These decisions will not be outcome -data driven.  
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted on ITT and PP populations.   
11.[ADDRESS_1247244] s who  are enrolled in the study.  All safety analyses will be 
conducted on the safety population.   
11.3 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The study is based on the primary endpoints for effectiveness and interval estimates of the safety of the 
device.  The study will be considered a success from a statistical standpoint if :  
1. Both primary analysis variables pass their respective hypotheses, i.e., H a0 and H b0 below are 
rejected in favor of H a1 and H b1, respectively,  
2. The rate of pre -specified adverse events per dialysis i nterval  is estimated to  be within the 
specified error of estimation for each treatment period.

Amendment 9 , dated January 9,  2020  
DOC -0000876, Rev 11    11.4 Analysis of Weekly Standardized Kt/V  
The following hypotheses will be tested at a one -sided α=0.025 level of significance:  
Ha0: µIC ≤2.1  vs. H a1: µIC>2.1  
and 
Hb0: µIH ≤2.1  vs. H b1: µIH>2.1  
where µ IC is the treatment period mean weekly standardized Kt/V value for the In-Center  arm and µ IH is 
the treatment period mean weekly standardized Kt/V value for the In-Home  arm.  This hypothesis will be 
tested using the Le ast Square Mean for the respective treatment period from a repeated measures 
analysis of variance (RMANOVA) containing terms for Subject , arm and time points (weeks) and using an 
AR(1) covariance structure.  
 
The weekly standardized Kt/V value will be calc ulated using the Leypoldt (Seminar in Dialysis, 17(2); 
March -April 2004) formula of:  
Standard Kt/V (stdKt/V) = 168*(1 -exp( -Kt/V))/t/((1 -exp( - t/V))/(Kt/V)+168/(N*t) -1) 
Where: N=number of treatments / week; t= treatment time in hours  
 
Summary statistics (m ean, sample size , standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median) will be 
computed on the weekly standardized Kt/V values for each treatment period.  
11.5 Analysis of Secondary Endpoint   
The analysis of the secondary endpoint of ultrafiltration rate (UFR) will be conducted on ITT and PP 
populations.  The UFR will be calculated using the following method:  
UF Rate = (Fluid Removal Goal + Rinse Back Volume) / Treatment Duration  
 
Where,  
Fluid Removal Goal = Today’s Weight – Prescribed Estimated Dry Weigh t  
 
And,  
Rinse Back Volume = The volume of saline, 300mL, returned to the patient at the end of treatment.

Amendment 9 , dated January 9,  2020  
DOC -0000876, Rev 11    For each treatment period, a 95% confidence interval will be computed on the pre -specified adverse 
event rate per dialysis interval .  This confidence interval will be computed using the L east Square Mean 
for the respective treatment period from a generalized linear model containing terms for Subject , arm 
and time points (i.e., a repeated measures analysis using GEE) using a Poisson link function and AR(1) 
covariance structure .  
Summary statistics (mean, sample size , standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median) will be 
computed on the number of pre -specified adverse events per dialysis interval  for each treatment period.  
The same summary statistics will be calculated by [CONTACT_890894] -specified adverse 
events per 100 dialysis treatments.  
11.7 Interim Analysis  
No formal statistical interim analyses will be conducted during this  study.   
11.8 Sample Size Analysis  
The estimated  sample size for the trial was based on the safety endpoint and yields an estimate of the 
rate of pre -specified adverse events per 100 dialysis treatments in each treatment period ( In-Center  and 
In-Home  use), to a margin of error of less than 1 event per 100 treatments.  With a two -sided =0.05, in 
order to construct a 95% confidence interval on the rate of pre -specified adverse events per 100 dialysis 
treatments with half -width less than 1 event per 100 treatment s, the sample size required would be n=[ADDRESS_1247246] s with 4 dialysis intervals  per week for a minimum of 8 weeks  (i.e., 30 subjects with a minimum of 
32 treatments) .  The sample size calculation was based on an asymptotic normal theory one sample test 
using variance estimates that included covariance terms for repeated measurements (4 dialysis intervals  
per week for 8 weeks) on each Subject  with a block diagonal first order autoregressive (AR(1)) covariance 
structure. This sample size calculation assumed a st andard deviation of 0.[ADDRESS_1247247]  correlation of pre -specified AE counts of =.50.

12.3 Case Report Forms  (CRF) and Device Da ta Storage  
Prescription details, blood pressure readings, heparin infusion data, changes to treatment parameters, 
and total fluid removed during treatment will be captured on a Subject  specific USB flash drive . Additional 
study information will be collected on standardized CRFs. Site numbers, Subject  numbers and Subject 
initials will be used to track Subject  information throughout the study.  
12.4 Device Accountability  
The Investigator  shall maintain adequate records of the receipt , use, and disposition  of the Investigational 
Device.  
12.5 Missing Data  
All missing values within the treatment period will be imputed using a multiple imputation procedure 
(Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method).  Parameter estimates and inferences for each treatment 
period will be based on the multiple imputations as described in Little and Rubin (2002).   For subjects who 
did not finish the study but have accumulated partial data for the primary effectiveness endpoint, missing 
data for Kt /V will be imputed by [CONTACT_890915]’s non -missing Kt/V responses.   
 
For all other endpoints, missing value imputation will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

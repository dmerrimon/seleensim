Protocol Title : A Multicenter, Open-label, Efficacy and Safety Study of Pegloticase in Patients Wit h 
Uncontrolled Gout Who Have Undergone Kidney Transplantation  
Protocol Number: HZNP-KRY- 406 Phase: 4 
Protocol Version: 3.0, Amendment [ADDRESS_193715] Drugs: Pegloticase  Indication : Chronic gout refractory to conventional 
therapy in adult patients  
Number subjects and Number and Country of Study Sites: Twenty subjects at approximately 15 study 
centers in the [LOCATION_002]  
Objectives: 
The overall objective of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety o f pegloticase in kidney transplant subjects 
with uncontrolled gout refractory to conventional urate lowering therapy. 
Primary Objective: 
To evaluate the effect of pegloticase on the response rate of sustained serum u ric acid (sUA) reduction to sUA 
<6 mg/dL during Month 6 of treatment  
Secondary Objectives: 
 To evaluate the effect of pegloticase on the response rate of sustained serum ur ic acid reduction to sUA <5 
mg/dL during Month 6 of treatment; 
 To evaluate the effect of pegloticase on pain assessed by [CONTACT_166795] (HAQ) pain 
score; and 
 To evaluate the effect of pegloticase on disability assessed by [CONTACT_166796] Q uestionnaire - 
Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score. 
Exploratory Objectives: 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pegloticase and the profile of anti- mono methoxy-poly(ethylene 
glycol) (PEG) and anti-uricase IgG antibodies; and  
 To evaluate the safety and efficacy 3 months after the end of treat ment with pegloticase  
Safety Objectives: 
To assess the overall adverse event (AE)/serious AE (SAE) profile including AEs of special interest (AESI) 
(infusion reactions [IRs], anaphylaxis, gout flares and cardiovascular [C V] events), laboratory tests, vital signs 
and physical exam, and incidence of biopsy-confirmed renal rejection.  
Study Design: 
This is a Phase 4, multi-site, open-label, efficacy and safety study of peg loticase in adult subjects with 
uncontrolled gout who have undergone kidney transplantation. Twenty  subjects will be enrolled. 
The study design will include: 1) a Screening Period, lasting up to 35 day s; 2) a 24-week treatment period 
which includes an End- of-Study (Week 24)/Early Termination Visit; 3) a safety follow-up phon e/email Visit 
[ADDRESS_193716] infusion; and 4) a 3-month post-treatment follow up visit. 
During the Screening Period, eligibility will be confirmed. 
Samples for measurement of sUA levels will be collected at the Screening Visit, prior to each infusion, 15- 60

for sUA levels will be collected at non-infusion Visits at Weeks 21 and 23 . 
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion cr iteria during Screening will be 
enrolled at the Day 1 Visit to receive pegloticase 8 mg administered IV every 2 weeks fr om Day 1 through 
Week 22, inclusive. During this 24-week treatment phase, subjects who  meet the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] (pre-dose sUA 
level >6 mg/dL at 2 consecutive study visits beginning with the Week 2  Visit, see Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_166772]) or discontinue treatment for any other reason will complete the End- of-Pegloticase-Infusions Visit 
procedures within 2 weeks and be encouraged to continue to participate in all v isits through the end of the 
study. Subjects will return for regularly scheduled visits and will comp lete all study visit procedures with the 
exception of the pegloticase infusion and IR prophylaxis. After the Week  24 Visit (or End- of-Pegloticase-
Infusions Visit [if applicable]), subjects should resume regular care for  gout per the judgment of the treating 
physician, including resumption of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) upo n pegloticase discontinuation, if 
appropriate. Subjects will have a 3-Month Follow-up visit to assess clinical status , including sUA levels. 
On days of scheduled infusions, pegloticase will be administered after all pre- dose visit assessments have 
been completed. The date and start and stop time of infusion will be recorde d. The date of the first dose o f 
pegloticase is defined as Day 1. All subsequent doses and study visits will be sch eduled based on the Day [ADDRESS_193717] gout flare prophylaxis (colchicine at initial dose of 0.3 to 0.6 mg/day if tolerated and low-dose 
prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day; for subjects already taking chronic corticos teroids, only colchicine 0.3 to 0.6 
mg/day should be added. In subjects with eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73m2, the dose of colchicine should not be 
more than 0.3 mg/day. In subjects taking cyclosporine, only lo w dose prednisone (and not colchicine) should 
be used for ≥ [ADDRESS_193718] infusion. Gout flare prophylax is should continue for the duration of the 
24-week treatment period. Subjects should be monitored closely for sympto ms of colchicine excess during 
the study. Reductions in dose, dose frequency or discontinuation of  colchicine are permitted if not tolerated. 
For Infusion Reaction (IR) prophylaxis, fexofenadine (60 or 180  mg orally) will be taken the day before each 
infusion; fexofenadine (60 or 180 mg orally) and acetaminophen (1000 mg orally) will be taken in the 
morning before each infusion. In addition, methylprednisolone (12 5 mg IV from Day 1 to Week 10 and 80 
mg IV from Week 12 until the end of treatment) is recommended to b e administered over an infusion duration 
between 10 and 30 minutes, immediately prior to each pegloticase infusion . Alternate IV corticosteroid 
regimen may be substituted for methylprednisolone at the discretion of  the Investigator. The dose of 
fexofenadine should be 60 mg orally in subjects with decreased renal function and 180 mg orally in subjects 
with normal renal function (eGFR >90 mL/min/1.73m2). 
Serum samples for PK analysis of pegloticase will be collected approximately 15 minutes to 2 hours after the 
end of infusion on Day 1, prior to the infusion and approximately 15 minutes to 2 hours after the end of 
infusion at Weeks 2, 6, 14 and 22. An additional PK sample will be collecte d at the Week 21 non-infusion 
visit, 
End- of-Pegloticase-Infusions Visit (if applicable) and End- of-Study/Early Termination Visit. 
Serum samples for evaluation of anti-PEG and anti-uricase immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies will be 
collected prior to the infusion on Day 1 and prior to the infusions at the Weeks 2, 6, 14 and 22. An additional 
sample will be collected at the End- of-Pegloticase-Infusions Visit (if applicable), End- of-Study/Early 
Termination Visit and the 
3-month follow up visit. In the event of an AE suspected to be an infus ion reaction, a sample will be collected 
at that time or at the subsequent visit for future evaluation of antibodies. 
Safety assessments, including monitoring and recording of all AEs, whether or not drug-related, measurement 
of vital signs, physical examinations, monitoring of hematology and b lood chemistry and acute renal 
rejection, will be performed. 
An independent adjudication committee will review reported events of infusion reactions, cardiovascular 
events and anaphylaxis. 
An overview of the study design is presented in the schematic below.

The PK of pegloticase and evaluation of anti-PEG and anti-uricase IgG antibodies w ill be assessed at specified 
time points. 
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of all AEs, wh ether or not drug-related, 
measurement of vital signs, physical examinations, and monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry and 
acute renal rejection.  
Hand Held  Uric Acid Measurement Device: 
Devices may be provided to measure subject uric acid levels in real time . 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]: 
Individual Subject Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_166774]: 
During the study, all subjects with pre-infusion sUA levels >6 mg/d L at 2 consecutive study visits beginning 
with the Week 2 Visit will be discontinued from pegloticase treatment.  
Statistical Analyses: 
Primary Endpoint: 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of Month 6 (Weeks 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24) responders, defined 
as subjects achieving and maintaining sUA <6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Month 6. 
Secondary Endpoints: 
The secondary endpoints are: 
 The proportion of 5 mg/dL responders during Month 6 (Weeks 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24), defined as 
subjects achieving and maintaining sUA <5 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Month 6; 
 The change from baseline in mean HAQ pain score to Week 24; and 
 The change from baseline in mean HAQ-DI score to 
Week 24.

Pharmacokinetic and Anti-drug Antibody Endpoints: 
 Serum concentrations of pegloticase; and 
 Profile of anti-PEG and anti-uricase IgG antibodies.  
Safety Endpoints: 
The safety endpoints include the following: 
 Overall AE/SAE profile; 
o  Incidences of AESI: IRs, anaphylaxis, gout flares, cardiovascular events;  
 Laboratory tests; 
 Vital signs and physical examination; and  
 Incidence of renal rejection (biopsy proven).  
Statistical Analysis of Efficacy Parameters 
The efficacy analysis will be performed using the modified intention- to-treat (mITT) population, defined as 
all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of pegloticase. The proportion of Month 6 responders will 
be summarized, along with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the propor tion. The proportion of 5 mg/dL 
responders during Month [ADDRESS_193725] had sUA level >6 m g/dL at 2 consecutive study visits 
beginning with the Week 2 Visit through Week 24 (for the primary endpoint) and through Week 14 (for 
exploratory endpoints). In addition, a subject who withdraws from  study treatment for any reason after the first 
dose of pegloticase and prior to Month 6 (for the primary endpoint) or  Month 3 (for exploratory endpoints) 
will be considered a non-responder if sUA values are not collected at the plan ned time points. 
The proportion of subjects with resolution of ≥ 1 tophus (100% d ecrease in the area of at least 1 tophus) at Week 
24 will be summarized along with the corresponding 95% CI. HAQ scores (Disability  Index [DI], pain, and 
health), sUA, urate volume, tophi size, bone erosion, SBP, DBP, MAP, ph ysician global assessment, eGFR, and 
UACR will be summarized at each visit with descriptive statistics. Changes from baselin e will be summarized 
along with 95% CIs. 
Special consideration may be given to subjects who discontinue the study  or miss visits due to reasons related to 
the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Sample Size Estimate: 
A sample size of 20 subjects is planned for this study. The primary  efficacy endpoint, the proportion of subjects 
achieving and maintaining sUA <6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Mo nth 6, will be demonstrated to 
be statistically greater than 43.5% (proportion of responders during Month  6 in Phase 3 studies), if at least 14/20 
(70%) responders are observed. In that case, the lower bound of a 95% co nfidence interval for the proportion of 
responders will be about 46%.

Footnotes: 
1. The Screening Visit can occur up to 35 days prior to the Day 1 Visit. 
2. Subjects will be enrolled at the Day 1 Visit to receive pegloticase 8 mg administered IV ever y 2 weeks from Day 1 through Week 22, inclusive. During 
this 24-week treatment phase, subjects who meet the sUA based stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_166775]- of-
Pegloticase-Infusions Visit procedures within 2 weeks and be encouraged to co ntinue to participate in all visits through the end of the study. Subjects 
will return for regularly scheduled visits and will complete all study visit pro cedures with the exception of the pegloticase infusion and IR prophylax is. 
After the Week 24 Visit (or End- of-Pegloticase-Infusions Visit [if applicable]), subjects should resume regu lar care for gout per the judgment of the 
treating physician, including resumption of urate-lowering therapy (ULT)  upon pegloticase discontinuation, if appropriate. Subjects will have a 3-
month Follow-up visit to assess clinical status, including sUA levels. 
3. Subjects who end treatment due to the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_166776]- of-Pegloticase-Infusions Visit within [ADDRESS_193726] 
infusion. Subjects should remain on study. See Section [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_193727] a follow up visit 3 months following the End- of-Pegloticase Infusions Visit or Week 24/End- of-Study/Early Termination Visit. If the 
subject ends treatment early but remains in the study and the 3-mo nth Post Treatment Follow-up Visit occurs prior to Week 24, the 3-month  Post Treatment 
Follow-up Visit will be adjusted accordingly based on the timing of the last treatment. 
5. The Investigator or designee will collect a complete gout history and other relevant medical/surgical history. 
6. Medication history (i.e., prior medications) will include gout medications, startin g at the time of diagnosis and up to (but not including) the Day 1 Vis it; 
substance use history; and all other medications up to (but not including) th e Day 1 Visit. Prior concomitant medications (not including gout medications) 
will be collected for 1 year prior to Screening. 
7. A complete physical examination will be performed at the Screening Visit and will incl ude assessments of head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT), 
heart, lungs, abdomen, skin, extremities, neurological status and muscu loskeletal system, and for presence of tophi, as well as gout history and sympto m 
severity. A targeted physical examination (for joint and skin evaluation an d assessment of AEs) will be conducted based on potential risk for or occur rence 
of AEs at Day 1, and prior to administration of infusion at Weeks 4 , 8, 12, 16, and 20, the End- of-Pegloticase-Infusions Visit (if applicable), Week 24/End-
of-Study/Early Termination Visit and 3-month Post-Treatment Follow Up Visit; at a  minimum this should include heart, lungs, and abdomen. Cli nically 
significant findings from the targeted physical examinations will be recorded as AEs.  
8. BP, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature, and heart rate will be measured at every visit, BE FORE study drug infusion and any scheduled blood draws. Heart ra te 
and BP measurements should be taken after the subject has been in a sit ting position and in a rested and calm state with proper positioning inclu ding back 
support, feet flat on the floor, for at least 5 minutes (See Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for detailed BP measurement procedures). Subject’s arm should be suppor ted at 
heart level; and the cuff placed on the bare arm. A large cuff should be used as needed to fit the upper arm and the same arm is to be used con sistently at 
each study visit. The Korotkoff phase V will be used to determine DBP. The cu ff deflation rate should be 2 mmHg per second.

16. For all subjects, serum samples for pegloticase PK analysis will be collected approximately 15 minutes to 2 hours after the end of infusion on Day 1; 
prior to infusion and approximately 15 minutes to 2 hours after  the end of the infusion at Weeks 2, 6, 14, and 22.  An additional PK sample will be 
collected at Week 21, the End- of-Pegloticase-Infusions Visit (if applicable) and the Week 24/End- of-Study/Early Termination Visit. 
17. Serum samples for measurement of sUA levels will be collected at the Screening Visit, within 48 hours prior to each pegloticase infusion and after the 
end of each pegloticase infusion prior to discharge from the site. Additional serum samples for sUA levels will be collected at n on-infusion Visits at 
Weeks 21 and 23 and the End- of-Pegloticase-Infusions Visit (if applicable), the Week 24/End- of-Study/Early Termination Visit, and the 3-month 
Follow-up Visit. For subjects whose previous visit’s pre-infusion sU A value is > 6 mg/dL, two separate samples/tubes of blood should be co llected 
within 48 hours prior to the pegloticase infusion (except on Day 1 whe n only 1 pre-infusion sample is required for the central laboratory); o ne 
sample/tube will be assessed by [CONTACT_779]’s local laboratory for pre-infusion  sUA results for on-study subject management. If a local laborato ry sample is 
drawn (within 48 hours prior to the pegloticase infusion), a sample for the central laboratory will be drawn prior to the pegloticase infusion on the day 
of the visit. The second sample/tube will be sent to the central laboratory for an alysis and recording in the database. Hand held uric acid measurement 
devices  may be provided to measure subject uric acid levels in real time . If hand held devices are provided, blood uric acid levels prior to each 
pegloticase infusion and after the end of each pegloticase infusion prior to  discharge from the site at the selected visits will recorded in database, but 
NOT to be used to manage pegloticase treatment. See the Laboratory Manual for instr uctions for alternate scenarios. 
18. Serum samples for evaluation of anti-PEG antibodies and anti-uricase IgG antibod ies will be collected prior to the infusion on Day 1 and at Weeks 2, 
6, 14, and 22. An additional sample will be collected at each of the End- of-Pegloticase-Infusions Visit (if applicable), the Week 24/End- of-Study/Early 
Termination Visit, and the 3-month Study Follow Up Visit. In the event of an AE suspected to be an infusion reaction, a serum sample will be 
collected in a serum separating tube at that time or at the subsequent visit for fut ure evaluation of pegloticase antibodies. 
19. For women of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test will be perfo rmed at the Screening Visit and at the Week 24/End- of-Study/Early 
Termination Visit. A urine pregnancy test will be performed at all other indicated  visits. 
20. Blood samples will be collected from consenting subjects for serum and f or peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation for potential 
analysis of inflammatory biomarkers, markers related transplant outcome, gout or gout co-morbidities in response to pegloticase or other potential 
treatment for gout. Subjects who consent to the optional blood draw fo r analysis of biomarkers but screen fail will be requested to return 24 weeks  
+/- [ADDRESS_193728] treatment goals at Screening, the End- of-Pegloticase-Infusions Visit (if 
applicable) and the Week 24/End- of-Study/Early Termination Visit. 
22. Blood and urine samples will be collected prior to pegloticase infusion on Day 1  and at the Week 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, and 22 Visits, the End  of 
Pegloticase Infusions Visit (if applicable), the Week 24/End of Study/Early Termin ation Visit, and the [ADDRESS_193729] Treatment Follow-up Visit. In 
addition, blood and urine samples will be collected after the end of pegloticase infusio ns prior to discharge from the site at on Day 1, Week 2, 6, 14 
and 22 Visits. The urine collected is aliquoted into separate tubes, one of which will be used by [CONTACT_166802]/creatinine ratio.

Guideline for GCP or with local law if it affords greater protection to the subject. The Investigator 
will additionally ensure adherence to the basic principles of GCP, as outlined in the current version of 
21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), subchapter D, part 312, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and 
Investigators,” part 50, “Protection of Human Subjects,” and part 56, “Institutional Review Boards.” 
5.[ADDRESS_193733] Information and Consent 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator or a person designated by [CONTACT_737] (if acceptable by 
[CONTACT_427]) to obtain a signed ICF from each subject prior to participating in this study after 
adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study. 
The Investigator or designee must also explain that the subjects are completely free to refuse to enter 
the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for any reason. 
The ICF and any other written information provided to subjects will be revised whenever important 
new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent, or there is an 
amendment to the protocol that necessitates a change to the content of the subject information and/or 
the written ICF. The Investigator will inform the subject of changes in a timely manner and will ask 
the subject to confirm his/her participation in the study by [CONTACT_166806]. Any revised 
written ICF and written information must receive the IRB`s approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_166777].

7 INTRODUCTION 
7.1 Background 
7.1.1 Gout 
Gout affects approximately 4% of the [LOCATION_002] population, is the most common form of 
inflammatory arthritis in men, and is associated with decreased quality of life ( Saag and Choi, 2006; 
Singh and Strand, 2008; Zhu et al., 2011; Sattui et al., 2014). The frequency of gout is increasing 
worldwide, with prevalence rates estimated to be as high as 7% in older men ( Mikuls et al., 2005; 
Saag and Choi, 2006; Roddy and Doherty, 2010). While the exact prevalence is unknown, as many as 
200,000 persons in the [LOCATION_002] experience chronic symptoms of gout, which is sometimes 
referred to as chronic refractory gout, despi[INVESTIGATOR_166778]-lowering therapy. This condition is 
characterized by [CONTACT_166807] a failure to control/maintain serum uric acid 
(sUA) <6 mg/dL with conventional xanthine oxidase inhibitors (i.e., allopurinol and febuxostat) and 
uricosuric agents (i.e., probenecid) ( Brook et al., 2010; Wertheimer et al., 2013; Khanna et al., 2016). 
These patients often have significant, disabling urate deposits in soft tissues and bone known as tophi. 
Gout and hyperuricemia (defined as a serum uric acid level >6.0 mg/dL [Kidney Disease: Improving 
Global Outcomes { KDIGO } Guidelines, 2009]) are major problems in the population of kidney 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The prevalence rate of 13.1% for gout in the kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_166779] 12-fold higher than the prevalence rate for gout in the general non 
transplanted US population (p <0.0001) ( Brigham et al., 2018).  Potential contributors to greater 
disease severity in gout patients with kidney transplants are reduced urate excretion due to renal 
impairment and reduced utilization of key urate lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_166780]. It is 
also possible that increased gout severity leads to greater risk of renal failure and hence, the need for 
transplantation, consistent with evidence of hyperuricemia and gout as risk factors for chronic kidney 
disease and end-stage renal disease ( Radeck et al., 2018). Managing gout in kidney transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_166781] ( Stamp et al., 2005). Some 
immunosuppressive drugs increase uric acid and many conventional urate lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_166782]. 
7.1.2 Pegloticase 
 
 
 
 
 
Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC  KRYSTEXXA IND: 010122 
Date: 22 JUN 2020  Protocol: HZNP-KRY- [ADDRESS_193735]. The primary endpoint was defined as plasma uric acid (pUA) (highly correlated 
to serum uric acid) reduction to below 6 mg/dL for 80% of the time in Months 3 and 6 combined. The 
pooled response rate for pegloticase 8 mg every two weeks was 42%, versus a placebo response rate 
of 0%. There was also a greater reduction in complete resolution of ≥ [ADDRESS_193736] of pegloticase treatment in the reduction of the number of tender 
and swollen joints. In subsequent open-label extension studies, pegloticase led to continued control of 
pUA, reduction in gout flares, and continued resolution of tophi, suggesting continuing benefit with 
extended pegloticase treatment beyond the initial 6 months of therapy, particularly in subjects who 
met responder criteria in the placebo-controlled trials. 
In the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491], deaths, AEs, SAEs, as well as laboratory abnormalities were generally 
equally distributed across placebo and pegloticase treatment groups, with the clear exception of gout 
flares and infusion reactions (IRs).  Pegloticase-treated subjects exhibited a higher rate of gout flares 
during Months 1-[ADDRESS_193737] hypersensitivity including 
administration of corticosteroids, antihistamine, and acetaminophen in advance of each pegloticase 
infusion, IRs were seen in 22/85 (26%) of subjects receiving the [ADDRESS_193738]-hoc review applying the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/ 
Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria ( Sampson et al., 2006), it was 
determined that across the Phase 2 and Phase 3 program, anaphylaxis occurred in 6.5% of subjects 
treated with pegloticase dosed every [ADDRESS_193739] and 
incidence of IRs was appreciated. Only 2% of subjects with anti-pegloticase antibody titers exceeding 
1:2430 maintained a urate-lowering response to pegloticase compared with 63% of subjects who were 
treated for at least 2 months without developi[INVESTIGATOR_166783]-titer antibodies (p <0.001) ( Sundy et al., 2011). 
The incidence of IRs was higher among subjects who developed high-titer antibodies compared with 
those who had titers that did not exceed 1:2430 (60% vs. 19%; p <0.001) ( Sundy et al., 2011). In 
addition, most IRs occurred when sUA levels were greater than 6 mg/dL. Retrospective analyses 
showed that the loss of urate-lowering efficacy, as reflected by [CONTACT_166808] 6 mg/dL, 
preceded a patient’s first IR, whenever it occurred, in 20 (91%) of [ADDRESS_193740]-hoc analysis of the biweekly pegloticase 
dosing group in the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) illustrated the impact of several possible

7.2 Rationale for this Study 
During the pre-marketing Phase 3 studies for pegloticase, subjects with organ transplant were 
excluded from participation; however, subjects with renal impairment were included, and showed 
comparable safety and efficacy as the general study population. Kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_166786], even when urate excretion is impaired. In addition, immunosuppressive agents to prevent 
rejections have the potential to thwart the formation of ADA against pegloticase, thereby [CONTACT_166809]. 
This study will test safety and effectiveness of pegloticase 8 mg administered intravenously every 2 
weeks in kidney transplant subjects with chronic gout refractory to conventional urate lowering 
therapy (ULT). Prospective use of sUA stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], with pegloticase treatment cessation (but study 
continuation) when a subject has a pre-infusion sUA level >6 mg/dL on two consecutive study visits, 
will also help confirm the value of this approach to reduce IR risk.

8 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The overall objective of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of pegloticase in kidney 
transplant subjects with uncontrolled gout refractory to conventional urate lowering therapy. 
 
Primary Objective: 
To evaluate the effect of pegloticase on the response rate of sustained serum uric acid (sUA)  
reduction to sUA <6 mg/dL during Month 6 of treatment. 
 
Secondary Objectives: 
 To evaluate the effect of pegloticase on the response rate of sustained serum uric acid reduction 
to sUA <5 mg/dL during Month 6 of treatment; 
 To evaluate the effect of pegloticase on pain assessed by [CONTACT_146254] 
(HAQ) pain score; and 
 To evaluate the effect of pegloticase on disability assessed by [CONTACT_166810] - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score. 
 
Exploratory Objectives: 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pegloticase and the profile of anti-methoxy- 
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and anti-uricase IgG antibodies; and 
 To evaluate the safety and efficacy 3 months after the end of treatment with pegloticase. 
 
Safety and Tolerability Objectives: 
To assess the overall adverse event (AE)/serious AE (SAE) profile including AEs of special in terest (AESI) 
(infusion reactions [IRs], anaphylaxis, gout flares and cardiovascular [CV] events), l aboratory tests, vital 
signs and physical exam, and incidence of biopsy confirmed renal rejection.

Date: 22 JUN 2020  Protocol: HZNP-KRY- [ADDRESS_193741] undergone kidney transplantation. Twenty subjects will be enrolled.  
The study design will include: 1) a Screening Period, lasting up to 35 days; 2) a 24-week treatment 
period which includes an End-of-Study (Week 24)/Early Termination Visit; 3) a safety follow-up 
phone/email Visit [ADDRESS_193742] infusion; and 4) a 3-month post-treatment follow up visit.  
During the Screening Period, eligibility will be confirmed. 
Samples for measurement of sUA levels will be collected at the Screening Visit, prior to each 
infusion, 15-60 minutes after the end of each infusion and at the Week 24/End-of-Study/Early 
Termination Visit. Additional samples for sUA levels will be collected at non-infusion Visits at 
Weeks 21 and 23.  
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of exclusion criteria during Screening will be 
enrolled at the Day 1 Visit to receive pegloticase 8 mg administered IV every 2 weeks from Day 1 
through Week 22, inclusive. During this 24-week treatment phase, subjects who meet the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10035] (based on elevated sUA levels, see Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_166787] [IP_ADDRESS] ) or discontinue treatment for 
any other reason will complete the End-of-Pegloticase-Infusions Visit procedures within 2 weeks and 
be encouraged to continue to participate in all visits through the end of the study. Subjects will return 
for regularly scheduled visits and will complete all study visit procedures with the exception of the 
pegloticase infusion and IR prophylaxis. After the Week 24/End-of-Study/Early Termination Visit (or 
End-of-Pegloticase-Infusions Visit [if applicable]), subjects should resume regular care for gout per 
the judgment of the treating physician, including resumption of ULT upon pegloticase 
discontinuation, if appropriate. 
Subjects will have a 3-month Follow-up visit to assess clinical status, including sUA levels. 
On days of scheduled infusions, pegloticase will be administered after all pre-dose study visit 
assessments have been completed. The date and start and stop times of infusion will be recorded. The 
date of the first dose of pegloticase is defined as Day 1. All subsequent doses and study visits will be 
scheduled based on the Day [ADDRESS_193743] gout flare prophylaxis (i.e., colchicine initial dose 0.3 to 0.6 mg/day if tolerated and 
low-dose prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day); for subjects already taking chronic corticosteroids, colchicine 0.3 
to 0.6 mg/day should be added. In subjects with eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73m2, the dose of colchicine 
should not be more than 0.3 mg/day. In subjects taking cyclosporine, only low dose prednisone (and 
not colchicine) should be used for ≥ [ADDRESS_193744] infusion. Gout flare prophylaxis should 
continue for the duration of the 24-week treatment period. Subjects should be monitored closely for

discontinuation of colchicine are permitted if not tolerated.  
For IR prophylaxis, fexofenadine (60 or 180 mg orally) will be taken the day before each infusion; 
fexofenadine (60 or 180 mg orally) and acetaminophen (1000 mg orally) will be taken the morning of 
each infusion . In addition, methylprednisolone (125 mg IV from Day 1 to Week 10 and 80 mg IV 
from Week 12 until the end of treatment) is recommended to be administered over an infusion 
duration between 10 and 30 minutes, immediately prior to each pegloticase infusion. Alternate IV 
corticosteroid regimen may be substituted for methylprednisolone at the discretion of the Investigator. 
The dose of fexofenadine should be 60 mg orally unless in subjects with decreased renal function and 
180 mg orally in subjects with normal renal function (eGFR>90 mL /min/1.73m2). 
Serum samples for PK analysis of pegloticase will be collected approximately 15 minutes to 2 hours 
after the end of infusion on Day 1, prior to the infusion and approximately 15 minutes to 2 hours after 
the end of infusion at Weeks 2, 6, 14 and 22. An additional PK sample will be collected at the Week 
21 Visit, End-of-Pegloticase-Infusions Visit (if applicable) and Week 24/End of Study/Early 
Termination Visit.  
Serum samples for evaluation of anti-PEG and anti-uricase IgG antibodies will be collected prior to 
the infusion on Day 1 and prior to the infusions at the Weeks 2, 6, 14 and 22. An additional sample 
will be collected at each of the End-of-Pegloticase-Infusions Visit (if applicable), 
Week 24/End-of-Study /Early Termination Visit and the 3-month follow up visit. In the event of an 
AE suspected to be an IR, a sample will be collected at that time or at the subsequent visit for future 
evaluation of ADAs.  
Safety assessments, including monitoring and recording of all AEs, whether or not drug-related, 
measurement of vital signs, physical examinations, and monitoring of hematology and blood 
chemistry and acute renal rejection, will be performed.  
An independent external adjudication committee will review reported events of IRs, major CV events 
and anaphylaxis.  
An overview of the study design is presented in the schematic below, and details of study activities 
are provided in Section 2.1.

Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC  KRYSTEXXA IND: 010122 
Date: 22 JUN 2020  Protocol: HZNP-KRY- [ADDRESS_193750] incidence of an IR that does not meet the criteria of anaphylaxis (see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.5 ) or does not meet serious criteria, the Investigator may elect to initiate the next infusion at 
a slower rate. All changes to infusion rate or dilution, and drugs given for prophylaxis or treatment, 
are to be recorded in the medical record and in the eCRF.  
9.4.7 Method of Assigning Subjects to Pegloticase 
Medidata Randomization and Trial Supply Management (RTSM) will be used to assign subjects 
specific pegloticase kit numbers. 
Specific procedures for accessing and assigning study drug through Medidata are contained in the 
study procedures manual.  
9.4.8 Blinding 
Because all subjects will receive pegloticase, this study drug will be administered without blinding 
and all subjects, Investigators and site personnel will know that all subjects are receiving pegloticase.  
9.4.9 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
Medication history (i.e., prior medications) will include all prior gout medications, starting at the time 
of diagnosis and up to the Screening Visit, and all other medications taken from 1 year prior to the 
Screening Visit.  
Concomitant medications are defined as drug or biological products other than the study drugs (or 
prior gout medications) taken by a subject from Screening through the Post-Treatment Follow-up 
Visits. This includes other prescription medications (including preventive vaccines), over the counter 
medications, herbal medications, vitamins, and food supplements.  
Information about prior and concomitant medications, including those used for any duration to treat 
an AE, will be collected on source documents and the appropriate eCRFs at each visit. The generic 
name [CONTACT_11889], indication, dose, unit, frequency, route of administration, and start and stop 
dates will be recorded.  
Subjects will be directed to discontinue current ULT prior to initiation of pegloticase therapy as per 
the current package insert. Other medications used at the time of study initiation may be continued at 
the discretion of the Investigator.  
9.4.10  Restricted Medications 
Subjects should not receive the following medications from the time of Screening through the end of 
pegloticase treatment: 
 Oral ULTs including allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid, lesinurad, or other ULT for gout; 
Re-introduction of oral ULTs should not start until after the End of Pegloticase Visit (or End 
of Study) laboratory tests are collected.

  Version 3.0 
 
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON THERAPEUTICS  IRELAND DAC  Page 59 of 103 overall response is Complete Response). If any single tophus shows progression, or if a new tophus 
appears during the study, the overall response for that subject will be Progressive Disease, regardless 
of the response of any other tophi.  
9.5.2 Quality of Life Assessment 
 
The HAQ (Appendix 17.2) including the HAQ-DI, pain and health scales, will be administered at 
Screening and prior to the pegloticase infusion at the Day 1 Visit, the Week 6 and 14 Visit, the End-
of-Pegloticase-Infusions Visit (if applicable), the Week 24/End-of-Study/Early Termination Visit, and 
the 3-month Post-Treatment Follow-up Visit (Section 2.1). 
The HAQ-DI is a self-report functional status instrument that can be filled out by a subject in less than 
[ADDRESS_193751] week by [CONTACT_7939] 
a total of 20 questions covering 8 domains of function: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, 
walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. There are at least [ADDRESS_193752] 
score for each of the 8 domains is summed (range from 0 to 24) and divided by [ADDRESS_193753] 6 domains ( Bruce and Fries, 2003).  
The HAQ pain scale consists of a doubly-anchored, horizontal visual analog scale (VAS), that is 
scored from 0 (no pain) to 100 (severe pain). Subjects are asked to rate the severity of the pain they 
have had because of illness in the past week by [CONTACT_1299] a vertical mark on the VAS.  
 
 
 
9.5.3 Pharmacokinetic and Anti- drug Antibody Measurements 
Serum samples for PK analysis of pegloticase will be collected after the end of infusion on Day 1 
(prior to discharge); prior to the pegloticase infusion and after the end of the infusion (prior to 
discharge) at Weeks 2, 6, 14, and 22. Additional PK samples will be collected at the Week 21 Visit, 
the End-of-Pegloticase-Infusions Visit (if applicable), and the Week 24/End-of-Study/Early 
Termination Visit. 
Serum samples for evaluation of anti-PEG and anti-uricase IgG antibodies will be collected prior to 
the pegloticase infusion on Day 1 and at the Week 2, 6, 14, 22 Visits, the End-of-Pegloticase-
Infusions Visit (if applicable), the Week 24/End-of-Study/Early Termination Visit, and the 3-month 
Post-Treatment Follow-up Visit.  
Each sample collection date and time will be recorded in source documents and the eCRF.

Date: 22 JUN 2020  Protocol: HZNP-KRY- [ADDRESS_193754] results will also be classified relative to the normal reference range (normal, low, or 
high). 
Vital signs, including BP, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature, and heart rate, will be summarized by [CONTACT_166811].  
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized and/or included in the data listings. 
9.6.[ADDRESS_193755] completed the study.  
9.6.9 Sample Size and Power Considerations 
A sample size of 20 subjects is planned for this study. The primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion 
of subjects achieving and maintaining sUA <6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Month 6, 
will be demonstrated to be statistically greater than 43.5% (proportion of responders during Month 6 
in the Phase 3 studies), if at least 14/20 (70%) responders are observed. In that case, the lower bound 
of a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of responders will be about 46%.  
Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC  KRYSTEXXA IND: 010122 
Date: 22 JUN 2020  Protocol: HZNP-KRY- [ADDRESS_193756] be documented in the eCRF. In the 
event of a major protocol deviation, the Investigator and Sponsor’s Medical Monitor will determine 
whether the subject should continue to participate in the study.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to report fully to regulatory authorities all results of 
administration of investigational drugs to humans. No investigational procedures other than those 
described in this protocol will be undertaken on the enrolled subjects without the agreement of the 
IRB and Sponsor.  
[ADDRESS_193757] of the 
study and to ensure that study data can be subsequently verified. These documents should be 
classified in 2 separate categories: (1) Investigator study file and (2) subject clinical source documents 
that corroborate data collected in the eCRFs. Subject clinical source documents would include, as 
applicable, original hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic subject records; physicians’ and nurses’ notes; appointment book; 
original laboratory, ECG, electroencephalogram, radiology, pathology, and special assessment 
reports; dispensing records; signed ICFs; consultant letters; and subject screening and enrollment 
logs.  
In order to comply with regulatory requirements, it is the policy of the Sponsor that, at a minimum, 
the following be documented in source documents at the study center: 
 Medical history/physical condition and diagnosis of the subject before involvement in the 
study sufficient to verify that the subject meets protocol entry criteria; 
 Study number, assigned subject number, and verification that written informed consent was 
obtained (each recorded in dated and signed progress notes); 
 Progress notes for each subject visit (each dated and signed); 
 Records of each study visit including each study assessment and the identity of the 
staff member performing the assessment; 
 Study drug dispensing and return; 
 Review by [CONTACT_166812] [ADDRESS_193758] results; 
 AEs (start and stop date, description, action taken, and resolution); 
 Investigator or sub-investigator’s signed assessment of AEs; 
 Concomitant medications (start and stop dates, reason for use); and 
 Condition of subject upon completion of, or premature withdrawal from, the study.

procedure of the Data Management System. Final eCRFs will be provided to the Investigator and 
Sponsor by [CONTACT_29018].  
12 STUDY MONITORING 
The Investigator will ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with all regulations governing 
the protection of human subjects. The Investigator will adhere to the basic principles of GCP as 
outlined in Title 21 of the CFR, Part 312, Subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators,” 
21 CFR, Part 50, “Protection of Human Subjects”; 21 CFR, Part 56, “Institutional Review Boards”; 
21 CFR, Part 54 “Financial Disclosure by [CONTACT_6230]”; and the ICH guideline entitled 
“Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance.” Additionally, this study will be conducted in 
compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with all local laws and regulations.  
The Investigator will ensure that all work and services described in, or associated with, this protocol 
are conducted in accordance with the investigational plan, applicable regulations, and the highest 
standards of medical and clinical research practice. The Investigator will provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_166789]’s Brochure to all Sub-Investigators, pharmacists, and other staff responsible 
for study conduct.  
All aspects of the study will be monitored by [CONTACT_166813]. The 
Sponsor will ensure that the study is monitored adequately in accordance with GCP guidelines.  
Prior to initiation of the study, the Sponsor’s representatives will review with study center personnel 
information regarding the investigational drug, protocol requirements, monitoring requirements, and 
reporting of SAEs.  
At intervals during the study, as well as after the completion of subject enrollment, the study center 
will be monitored by [CONTACT_166814]. During these visits, the monitor will 
discuss study progress, verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and 
accuracy of the data being entered on the eCRF (source data verification); oversee the resolution of 
outstanding data discrepancies, and check on various aspects of study conduct (e.g., drug 
accountability, sample storage). The Investigator agrees to allow monitors access to the clinical 
supplies, dispensing and storage areas, and clinical records of the study subjects, and, if requested, 
agrees to assist the monitors. The Investigator must cooperate with the monitors to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.

Date: 22 JUN 2020  Protocol: HZNP-KRY- [ADDRESS_193760] and advised as to the nature of the audit. 
Representatives of the [LOCATION_002] FDA and/or representatives of other regulatory authorities may 
also conduct an inspection of the study at the investigative site. If informed of such an inspection, the 
Investigator should notify the Sponsor immediately.  
Every effort will be made to maintain the anonymity and confidentiality of subjects participating in 
this clinical study. However, because of the investigational nature of this treatment, the Investigator 
agrees to allow representatives of the Sponsor, its designated agents, and authorized employees of the 
appropriate regulatory agencies to inspect the facilities used in this study and to have direct access to 
inspect, for purposes of verification, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166790]. A statement to this effect should be included in the ICF. 
13 DATA MANAGEMENT 
Data will be entered into a clinical database, as specified in the Data Management Plan. Quality 
control and data validation procedures will be applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of the 
clinical database. Data will be reviewed and checked for omissions, apparent errors, and values 
requiring further clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring 
clarification will be communicated to the investigational site for resolution. Only authorized 
personnel will make corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections will be documented in an 
audit trail.  
The coding of an AE, medical history and concomitant medication terms will be performed by [CONTACT_166815]. Concomitant medications 
will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHODrug) and AE/medical 
history/surgery/non-drug therapy terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA).  
14 RETENTION OF RECORDS 
No study documents at the study site should be destroyed without prior written agreement between 
the Sponsor and the Investigator. All subjects’ medical records, the Investigator’s copy of the eCRF, 
other supporting data, records of drug dispensing and accountability, signed ICFs, IRB 
correspondence, and correspondence with the Sponsor must be kept by [CONTACT_12103] 2 
years and/or as required by [CONTACT_166816] a marketing 
application in an ICH region (including the [LOCATION_002]) and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in any other ICH region. If an application is not filed or not 
approved for the indication under study, all study-related files must be retained for at least [ADDRESS_193761] 
retention. In that event, the records generally will be retained at the institution at which the study was 
conducted.
